PREFACE 

The Smithsonian Institution was established in 1846 as the result of 
the bequest of James Smithson, an English scientist. He bequeathed 
his entire fortune to the United States of America for the purpose 
of founding "an establishment for the increase and diffusion of 
knowledge among men." For the increase of knowledge, the Insti- 
tution is continuously engaged in research in many branches of science, 
as well as scientific expeditions to all parts of the world; the diffusion 
of knowledge is accomplished principally by the extensive exhibits 
in its museums, its art galleries, and its zoological park, and by several 
series of publications which are distributed throughout the world. 

Probably the best known of these series is the Annual Report of the 
Board of Regents, usually called the Smithsonian Annual Report. A 
Report has been published every year since 1846, and starting with 
1849 a General Appendix was included in each volume for the purpose 
of disseminating information on important and interesting scientific 
investigations. The "Advertisement" introducing the General Ap- 
pendix to each volume states its function as follows: 

The object of the General Appendix to the Annual Report of the Smithsonian 
Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific discovery in particular 
directions; reports of investigations made by staff members and collaborators 
of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character or on special topics that 
are of interest or value to the numerous correspondents of the Institution. 

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian 
Institution from a very early date to enrich the annual report required of them by 
law with memoirs illustrating the more remarkable and important developments 
in physical and biological discovery, as well as showing the general character 
of the operations of the Institution; and, during the greater part of its history, this 
purpose has been carried out largely by the publication of such papers as would 
possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress. 

In 1880, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual summary of 
progress which for 30 years previously had been issued by well-known private 
publishing firms, the Secretary had a series of abstracts prepared by competent 
collaborators, showing concisely the prominent features of recent scientific prog- 
ress in astronomy, geology, meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, 
zoology, and anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not 
altogether satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888. 

In the report of 1889, a return was made to the earlier method of presenting 
a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original) embracing a 
considerable range of scientific investigation and discussion. This method has 
been continued to the present time.

IV ANNUAL REPORTS, SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION 

The Smithsonian Reports are distributed by the Institution to 3,600 
libraries in the United States and 1,700 libraries abroad. Although 
each volume includes an index, access to the valuable scientific infor- 
mation in the Reports has been limited by the lack of a general index 
to the series as a whole. With this thought in mind, Miss Ruth M. 
Stemple of the Florida State University Library (now at the West 
Virginia University Library) undertook on her own initiative to pre- 
pare such an index. The manuscript was reviewed and somewhat am- 
plified by the Editorial and Publications Division of the Smithsonian. 

The index is by authors and subjects, the subjects being sufficiendy 
cross-indexed, it is believed, to enable users to locate any desired 
subject of interest to them. 

The subjects treated in Smithsonian Report articles cover almost 
the entire gamut of scientific disciplines. If any subjects predominate, 
they would be in the general fields of biology, geology, and anthro- 
pology — fields with which the Smithsonian has been prominently 
identified during its more than a century of scientific endeavor. 
However, articles dealing with all other sciences will be found in the 
Reports, including astronomy, physics, chemistry, meteorology, 
medicine, and engineering. 

Many of the earlier Reports contain articles of great historical inter- 
est as recording scientific discoveries which have exerted vast influence 
on the lives of all of us up to the present time. For example, W. C. 
Roentgen records in the 1897 Report his discovery of the penetrating 
radiation which he called X-rays. In the Report for 191 1 we read 
Marconi's own account of his successful transmission of messages over 
distances by "wireless." The beginnings of practical human flight are 
recorded by Wilbur Wright in the 1902 Report and Orville Wright 
in that for 1914. 

Scientific breakthroughs that led to spectacular developments are 
exemplified by Ernest Rutherford's article in the 1938 Report record- 
ing the successful transmutation of one element into another; by 
Karl K. Darrow's 1940 account of the first achievement of nuclear 
fission; and by Wendell M. Stanley's attempt to relate viruses to cancer, 
genes, and life in the Report for 1957. 

Outstanding current activities in various fields of science are repre- 
sented in the 1959 Report by Capt. E. B. Roberts's account of the vast 
scientific results of the recent International Geophysical Year, and by 
Ralph S. Solecki's description of the skeletons of three Neanderthal 
adults, who lived from 46,000 to 64,000 years ago, found in Shanidar 
Cave in northern Iraq; in the i960 Report by the article "Exploring 
the Solar System by Radar," by Paul E. Green, Jr., and Gordon H. 



AUTHOR-SUBJECT INDEX, 1849-1961 

Pettengill, and E. M. McCormick's description of the marvelous 
operations of modern digital computers. 

The entire series of Reports include some 3,000 articles, many of 
them written by world leaders in the various branches of science. 
It is the hope of the Smithsonian Institution that the present author- 
subject index will lead to a wider acquaintance with the diversified 
scientific source material in Smithsonian Annual Reports covering 
113 years.

Secretary, Smithsonian Institution.

Editor's Note: The user of this index should keep in mind that its prime purpose is to point to 
what subjects have been published upon in the Smithsonian Reports so far as indicated in the tides 
of the papers, and to list the authors and titles of the various articles. It is not an index to the 
detailed contents of the articles, as this would require a work of many times this size. It has 
been the aim in preparing the index to keep the classification as simple as possible and to avoid 
multiple listings under overlapping entries. Subject entries are not mutually exclusive; for example, 
under Anthropology one will not find brought together all the references to the subdivisions of 
Anthropology, such as Ethnology, Archeology, Indian Languages, etc. The tide of the paper is 
usually the guide line. Many of the larger subjects, such as Anthropology, Antiquities, Archeology, 
and Birds, are subdivided mainly by geographical locality. Cross references have been inserted only 
where deemed most helpful. Occasionally absolute uniformity of treatment has been sacrificed 
for the sake of brevity and expediency. To aid in the use of the index, the names of authors of 
articles are printed in capitals and lower case; subjects in capitals and small capitals.
