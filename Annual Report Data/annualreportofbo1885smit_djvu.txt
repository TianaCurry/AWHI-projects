JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF 
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. 


Washington, B. G., January 21, 1885. 

The annual meeting of .the Board of Eegents of the Smithsonian 
Institution was held this day at half past 10 o’clock A. m. 

Present: Hon. G. F. Edmunds, Hon. J. S. Morrill, Hon. S. B. 
Maxet, Hon. O. E. Singleton, Hon. W. L. Wilson, Hon. W. W. 
Phelps, Eev. Dr. John Maclean, Eev. Dr. Noah Porter, Dr. 
Henry Copp^ie, Dr. James C. Welling, and the Secretary, Professor 
Baird. 

Excuses for non-attendance were read from Chief-Justice Waite, 
Prof. Asa Gray, and Hon. N. P, Hill. 

In the absence of the Chancellor, on motion of Mr. Phelps, Dr. Por- 
ter was called to the chair. 

The .journal of the Board was read and approved. 

The Secretary stated that the Eev. Dr. Noah Porter had been 
re-elected a Eegent for six years by the joint resolution of Congress, 
approved JVIarch 3, 1884. 

The Secretary presented to the Board the following letter: 

Prof. Spencer F. Baird, 

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution : 

Dear Sir : The state of my health renders it necessary to tender my 
resignation as a member of the Board of Eegents of the Smithsonian 
Institution. 

In signifying my resignation it is with no ordinary feelings I recall 
the years I have been connected with the Board and the distinguished 
men with whom it has been my privilege and honor to bo associated-. 
Not only the present members whom I so highly respect and esteem, 
but a long list of honored names of former members now deceased, re- 
cur to me, the last of which is that of Professor Joseph Henry, and 
while Ja:vies Smithson will be known to the world and remembered 
as the founder of the Institution, Joseph Henry will be regarded as 
having been raised up by a signal Providence, the true interpreter of 
his will, the able organizer of the Institution, and wise controller of its 
finances.

JOURNAL OF THE BOARD. 


ill 

May the Smithsonian Institution, so auspiciously established and ex- 
tensively known, continue, under your wise administration, an estab- 
lishment distinct and specific^ for the “ increase and diffusion of knowl- 
edge among men.” 

With great respect, your friend and servant, 

Peter Paeetir. 

2 Lafayette Square, 

Washington, J). G., April 7, 1884. 


The Secretary informed the Board that Congress had filled the va. 
cancy occasioned by the resignation of Dr. Parker by the election of

ington, D. C., for six years from May 13, 1884. 

On motion of Dr. Maclean it was — 

Resolved, That the Board of Eegents has heard with regret of the 
resignation of Dr. Peter Parker, and hereby exjiresses the high appre- 
ciation of the valuable and efficient services he has rendered the insti- 
tution for the past seventeen years as a Eegent and as Chairman of its 
Executive Committee. 

The Secretary stated that in accordance with the rules of the Board

Uuder tiie provisions of this act the Chancellor had taken the fol- 
lowing action : 

Lyme, Conn., July 2, 1884. 

By virtue of the authority conferred on me by- the act of May 13, 
1884, “ to provide for the appointment of an Acting Secretary of the 
Smithsonian Institution,” I hereby designate and appoint Mr. William 
J. Khees to act as Secretary of the Institution when there shall be a 
vacancy in that office, and whenever the Secretary shall be unable from 
illness, absence, or other cause to perform the duties of his office. 

M. E. Waite, 

Chancellor of the Smithsonian Institiition. 

Dr. Maclean presented the annual report of the Executive Commit- 
tee, which was read. 

On motion of Dr. Coppee it was — 

Resolved, That the report of the Executive Committee be accepted, 
and that the income for the year 1885 be appropriated for the service 
of the Institution upon the basis of the above report, to be expended 
by the Secretary with full discretion as to the items, subject to the 
approval of the Executive Committee. 

The Secretary presented the following communication he had received 
since the last meeting of the Board : 

June 2, 1884. 

Spencer F. Baird, 

Secretary Smithsonian Institution, 

Washington, I). C. : 

Sir : I intend to make a bequest for the advancement of science — 
that is, of physical science- For many reasons I would like to make 
the bequest in favor of the Smithsonian Institution ; but there is one 
difficulty which must be cleared up before I can decide. If money were 
left by will to the Smithsonian Institution would it defend the will 
against the claims of any and all persons who should contest the will 
and take legal steps to set it aside ? Has it authority by law ; has it 
funds that it would be authorized to use for the purpose of defending a 
will in its favor "I As I have no children the will would be less likely 
to be contested, but there are others who might attempt to set it aside. 
For this reason what I wish above all to be assured of, is that any legacy 
that 1 leave for the purpose named will not be given up without making 
a light of it if needful. Please explain this point. 

I wish you to send me a form of words, the very words themselves, 
in which a bequest should be made so that there could be no pretense 
of setting it aside for vagueness; and that will carry out my intentions, 
which I will explain : 

The chief part I would desire to bequeath to the Institution would be 
for the “increase and difi'usion of knowledge among men,” and beside 
would wish to have the Institution invest say $300 (is that too insig- 
nificant for the i)urpose‘?) and use the income thereof for conferring a 
gold medal either annually or biennially (which would be the better?) 
on the person who had made the most important discovery in physical 
science during the year, or two years, ending, say a year before the 
date of ccnferring the medal. For example, the Eegents would have 
to decide, say in the month of December, 1883, who made the most 
important discovery in x)Iiysical science during the year, or two years, 
ending December 31 , 1882. If you have my meaning put it in language 
that will make it perfectly clear without multiplying words. 


XIV 


JOURNAL OF THE BOARD. 


The medal not for any patented invention, like the electric light, for 
example, but especially and only for such discoveries as Pasteur on in- 
fection, fermentation, &c., and G. Darwin’s on tidal action. Eegents 
to be sole judges as to what is meant by physical science and most im- 
portant discoveries therein. 

The reason wliy I would like to have not only suggestions and ex- 
planations but the full “I will and bequest to” is also because I don’t 
know whether to say the Regents shall do this or that, or whether to 
say a majority or quorum of them shall do it in order to make it both 
strictly legal and also practicable; also, whether or not it is necessary 
to say how the Eegents shall invest the money. I suppose a copy of 
that part of Hamilton’s or Huebus’ (Habel*?) will would answer for the 
part relating to the “increase and diffusion,” &c. As for the medal I 
believe no fund has been left to institutions for that purpose, and I 
should like to have your opinion on it. 

Please return this letter with your answer, which I would like you to 
let me have as soon as you can; taking, however, all the time you need 
to make it so full and explicit that no further correspondence will be 
necessary at this stage. I mean business if your answer is satisfactory. 
For the present I desire this affair to be treated as confidential, or if 
necessary to mention to other parties, withhold the name. 

There is one thing I had rather do than make a bequest in favor of 
the Institution, namely, pay over a certain sum, say $2,000 or $2,500, 
in trust to the Eegents ; provided I cpuld receive the income during 
life, th6 Institution to have the sole use and possession of the same 
after my death. Would the Institution be authorized to accejjt a sum 
of money on such terms? 

Respectfully, 

# # # 

After full discussion of the subject it was, on motion of Mr. Edmunds — 

Resolved, That the communication be referred to the Executive Com- 
mittee with full power to act in relation to it. 

The Secretary, Professor Baird, presented his annual report of the 
operations of the Institution for the year 1884, which was read in part. 

On motion of Dr. i\Iaclean, the Secretary was instructed to transmit 
the report to Congress. 

On motion of Mr. Edmunds, it was — 

Resolved (1), That the fiscal year of the Institution shall hereafter ter- 
minate on the 30th day of June in each year. 

(2) That the Secretary shall hereafter prepare and cause to be printed 
and sent to each member of the Board on or before the first day of De- 
cember in each year, his annual report. 

(3) That the annual meeting of the Board of Eegents shall hereafter 
be held on the second Wednesday in January in each year. 

The Board then adjourned sine die.

REPOET OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. 


The committee has examined the vouchers for payments made from 
the Smithson income during the six months ending 30th June, 1885, all 
of which bear the approval of the Secretary of the Institution, and a 
certificate that the materials and services charged were applied to the 
purposes of the Institution. 

The committee has also examined the accounts of the National Mu- 
seum and find that the balances above given correspond with the cer- 
tificates of the disbursing officers of the Interior and Treasury Depart- 
ments. 

The quarterly accounts-current, the vouchers, and journals have been 
examined and found correct. 

Eespectfully submitted.

REPORT OF PROFESSOR BAIRD, 

SECRETAEY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, FOR 1885. 


To the Board of Regents : 

Gentlemen: In accordance with the resolution of the Board at the 
last meeting directing that the fiscal year, instead of extending from 
January to December, shall correspond with the Government fiscal year, 
and extend from July to the following June, inclusive, the present re- 
port will include the history of the operations of the Institution for the 
first half of 1885 only. The same restrictions in regard to time will 
apply to the reports of the National Museum, the Bureau of Ethnology, 
and the system of International Exchanges which have been placed by 
Congress under the direction of the Institution. As heretofore, there 
will also be some account of the operations of the United States Fish 
Commission, and those of the Geological Survey, which, although not 
controlled in any way by the Institution, are so closely affiliated with it 
as to render proper some notice of them. 

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. 

INTRODUCTORY. 

The general routine work of the Institution continues to be much the 
same as in previous years, and while no specially new features have 
been introduced, considerable extension has been made in some depart- 
ments, and increased precision and efficiency in all. In the way of 
extra duty the principal occasion has been the International Exposition 
at New Orleans, where the Institution (by requirement of law) made a 
very extensive display. 

The new work on the eastern portion of the Smithsonian building has 
been entirely finished, and much progress made in renovating the cen- 
tral portion. 

A considerable number of valuable publications have appeared, and 
others are in press. 

The work of the Museum continues to increase in magnitude, much 
material having been received from the New Orleans Exposition. 

THE BOARD OF REGENTS. 

It is with great regret that I announce the termination of service on 
the Board, of General William T. Sherman, his term having expired and 
H. Mis. 15 1

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 


his removal from Washington to Saint Louis, Mo., rendering him ineli- 
gible for re-election, the law of organization requiring two members 
of the Board to be citizens of the District of Columbia. Dr. Welling, 
president of Columbian Dniversity, is the only member from this city at 
present, he having been elected by Congress at its last session a Eegent 
for six years, until May 13, 1890. 

The term of service of an unusually large number of Regents , will 
expire during the winter of 1885-1886. As “members at large,” Rev. 
Dr. John Maclean, of New Jersey, Prof. Asa Gray, of Massachusetts, 
and Dr. Henry Copp6e, of Pennsylvania, wiU cease to be members on 
the 19th of December next; and as the Porty-ninth Congress will com- 
mence its session in the same month, it will become the duty of the 
Speaker to appoint three Regents from the House of Representatives. 

The term of Hon.N. P. Hill, of Colorado, as Senatorial Regent, expired 
on the 3d of March, 1885, and on March 25, 1885, the Vice President, 
Mr. Hendricks, appointed Hon. Shelby M. Cullom, of Illinois, as Regent 
during his term of service as United States Senator. The Vice-Presi- 
dent on the same date also re appointed Hon. J. S. Morrill, of Vermont, 
for a new term of six years. 

Until the next meeting of the Board of Regents, in January, 1886, the 
vacancy existing in the Executive Committee by the expiration of the 
term of General Sherman was filled by the appointment of Dr. Henry 
Copp6e ad interim, by the remaining members of the committee. 

The Board at its last meeting adopted an important resolution, order- 
ing that the fiscal year of the Institution shall terminate on the 30th of 
June of each year. This changes the practice of the Institution siuce 
its organization, and will occasion some difficulty in arranging tables 
of comparison of receipts and expenditures for annual periods. The 
reason for the change is that the fiscal year of the Government termi- 
nates in June, and as the appropriations made by Congress for the 
Museum, the exchange system, ethnological researches, &c., are for this 
period, it was thought advisable for the accounts of the Institution to 
conform to those of the General Government. The accounts of the In- 
stitution have therefore been given in this report only for the six 
months terminating on the 30th of June, 1885. 

Change in the time of printing the Report . — It was also ordered by the 
Board that “the Secretary shall hereafter prepare and cause to be 
printed and sent to each member of the Board, on or before the 1st day 
of December in each year, his annual report.” 

Difficulty has always been experienced in the early printing of the 
Annual Report of the Institution. The organic act, August 10, 1846, 
provides that “the Board” of Regents “shall submit to Congress, at 
each session thereof, a report of the operations, expenditures, and con- 
dition of the Institution.* In accordance with this law the Board has 
annually submitted to Congress a report of the operations of the Insti- 
tution, which has been ordered to be printed and a number of extra 

* Revised Statutes, Title LXXIII, Section 5593, "

copies granted for its use and distributioJIi. The Public Printer how- 
ever has not felt authorized to put any part of the report in typo before 
the adoption by Congress of a special resolution to print the extra 
copies referred to, and as there has frequently been great delay in the 
passage of the concurrent resolution, many months have frequently 
elapsed between the annual meeting of the Board and the printing of 
the report. 

The best illustration of this delay is furnished by reference to the 
report of the Institution for the year 1883, which, although submitted 
to Congress on the 21st of January, 1884, was actually not ordered to 
be printed till July, 1884, and not delivered to the members and to the 
Institution until August, 1885. 

To remedy this evil and to secure prompt publication, the Eegents 
adopted the resolution referred to above at its last meeting, and by the 
efforts of the members of the Board in the Senate and House of Eep- 
resentatives secured the passage of the following joint resolution by 
Congress, Eo. 18, approved by the President of the United States 
March 3, 1885 : 

^'■Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That the annual reports of 
the Smithsonian Institution shall be hereafter printed at the Govern- 
ment Printing Office, in the same manner as the annual reports of the 
heads of Departments are now printed, for submission in print to the 
two Houses of Congress.” 

The intent of this act is to instruct the Public Printer to print the 
Annual Eeport of the Eegents whenever copy shall be furnished, so 
that the whole report may be presented to Congress in printed form at 
the commencement of each session. 

The statute under which the reports of Departments are printed is 
as follows: 

“The head of each Department, except the Department of Justice, 
shall furnish to the Congressional Printer copies of the documents 
usually accomi>anying his annual report, on or before the first day of 
November in each year, and a copy of his annual report on or before 
the third Monday of November in each year.* 

“It is further provided that of the documents accompanying the an- 
nual reports of the Executive Departments one thousand copies shall 
be printed and bound for the use of the members of the Senate, and 
two thousand copies for the use of the members of the House of Eepre- 
sentatives, in addition to the usual number for Congress, 1,900 copies.”! 

While the printing of the report is now secured without a special 
order at each session of Congress, it will still be necessary to have a 
concurrent resolution every year for the printing of extra copies for the 
use of the Institution. 

FINANCES. 

The financial condition of the Institution continues to be satisfactory. 
The Smithson fund remains the same as at the date of the last report,

EEPORT OF THE SECKETAKY. 


$703,000, deposited forever in the United States Treasury, from wliicli is 
received an annual interest of 6 per cent. This interest is paid on the 
1st of January and 1st of July, and the money immediately placed in 
the hands of the Treasurer of the United States, who keeps a special 
account of it. All payments are made by checks on this officer, signed 
by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. A monthly statement 
is rendered by the Treasurer of all checks paid and of tL c balances. This 
is compared with the books kept by the accountant of the Institution. 
A quarterly examination is made by the Executive Committee of the 
Eegents of all the financial transactions of the Institution. The mem- 
bers of the committee sign a certificate, of which the annexed is a copy : 

CERTIFICATE. 

Washington, D. C., , — , 18 — . 

The nndersigned members of the execntive committee of the Board of Regents of 
the Smithsonian Institution have examined the account for for the end- 
ing , 18 — , the receipts amounting to dollars, and the expenditures to 

dollars, leaving a balance of dollars, as entered in the journal, pages 

to , inclusive ; and certify the same to he correct. For each disbursement 

there is a voucher approved by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, and cer- 
tified by an agent of the Institution that the articles or services charged therein were 
required and furnished on account of the objects specified, and that the same were 
necessary and the charges reasonable. 

The balance above stated corresponds with the certificate of the Department 

of 18—. 


Executive Committee. 

The change of the fiscal year of the Institution, to terminate on the 
30th of June instead of the 31st of December, renders it necessary to 
state in this report the receipts and expenditures for six months only, 


viz, from January 1 to July 1, 1885: 

Cash on hand January 1, 1885 $26, 380 84 

Expenditures : 

Building, furniture, and fixtures $552 15

Total on hand July 1, 1885 $23, 746 82 


The appropriations made by Congress for the system of Exchanges,

researclies by Mr. J. D. McChesuey, disbursing officer of the United 
States Geological Survey ; those for the preservation of Government 
collections, furniture, and fixtures, and other objects for the National 
Museum, by Mr. George W. Evans, disbursing clerk of the Interior 
Department. 

The vouchers for all these expenditures are critically examined by 
the proper Auditor and the Comptroller of the Treasury, and have been 
formally passed by those officials. 

Every payment for the Institution and its dependencies is made by 
bonded officers of the Government. 

BUILDINGS. 

The Smithsonian Building . — As stated in previous reports, two appro- 
I)riations were made by Congress for fire-proofing the eastern portion of 
the Smithsonian building and increasing its accommodations for doing 
the Government work connected with the Museum, the International 
Exchanges, &c. The whole has now been completed in a thoroughly 
fire proof manner, with twice the original number of available office 
rooms, and with every facility for doing the work mentioned in the best 
possible manner. 

The rest of the Smithsonian building is in an unsightly and dilapi- 
dated condition, and will before long require extensive repairs in the 
way of a new ceiling to the second-story room, and the re-arrangement 
of cases in the first floor, &c. ; an undertaking which, as being strictly 
in the interest of the National Museum, will warrant the asking Con- 
gress for the necessary appropriation. 

The exterior of the central portion of the building was in a very bad 
condition, requiring repainting, reglazing, &c., and this work has been 
undertaken and practically completed at a moderate expense, greatly 
improving its appearance. 

Rational Museum Building . — This building is apparently in excellent 
condition, and has required comparatively little in the way of repairs. 
An appropriation was made in 1884 for a concrete walk along the south- 
ern and eastern sides of the building, and was expended so as to furnish 
a much -needed improvement in the facilities of access. 

Armory Building . — This building, which has been assigned by law for 
the purposes of the Smithsonian Institution and the United States Fish 
Commission, is occupied partly for the storage of collections and partly 
for the active work of the Commission. It now constitutes what is 
known as the central hatching station of the Commission, where the 
work of i)ropagation of food fishes is conducted on a very extensive 
scale. It is also the depot from which shipments of fish are made from 
Washington to all parts of the country, and for this purpose has a 
branch track of the Baltimore and Potomac Eailroad, by means of which 
the cars are brought alongside of the building and receive and deliver 
their loads.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 


The Brick Workshop. — This building contiuues to be used for the same 
purposes as in previous years, a part of it being occupied as a stable, 
while the greater portion is used for the preparation and mounting of 
birds, modelling in plastef and papier-mach§, in painting the casts of 
specimens, &c. 

Temporary Workshop. — Eeference has been made to a large shed or 
annex, built at the expense of the appropriation for the New Orleans 
Exposition, and used in the preparation of exhibits for the same, and 
also for storage of the articles received therefrom, and their special 
preparation for exhibition. It was also intended to receive the collec- 
tions as returned until they could be properly assigned to their places 
or otherwise disposed of. An appropriation was however made by Con- 
gress at its last session to meet the cost of restoring the collections sent 
to New Orleans to their original condition, very serious damage having 
occurred in consequence of the dampness and other agencies. This 
has made it necessary to retain the building for the present. As soon 
as arrangements can be made to receive what is now stored therein, it 
will be taken down and the ground cleared of what is a serious incum- 
brance. 

Army Medical Museum Building. — For several years the authorities of 
the Army Medical Museum have been endeavoring to secure an appro- 
priation for the erection of a flire-proof building for the accommodation 
of the library of the Museum and the offices of the Bureau, so as to ob- 
viate any possible danger of loss by fire of important archives and ma- 
terial. An appropriation of $200,000 was finally made by Congress ; 
and the Secretary of War, the Architect of the Capitol, and the Secre- 
tary of the Smithsonian Institution were authorized to select a site 
in the vicinity of the National Museum for the accommodation of the 
aforesaid building. The committee met and selected the southeast 
corner of the Smithsonian reservation, extending along Seventh street 
170 feet and South B street 260 feet. As the expenditure was contin- 
gent upon the adequacy of the aj)propriation to construct the building 
in question, the plans were prepared and submitted for estimate to a 
number of bidders, whose offers were as follows :

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

It thus appearing that the appropriation was adequate to the demand, 
a contract was entered into with Messrs. Bright, Humphrey & Co., and 
the work ordered by the Secretary of War to be prosecuted with the 
utmost possible diligence. 

Necessity of new buildings for the National Museum. — An application 
was made to Congress a year or two ago for an appropriation with 
which to commence the construction of a second building for museum 
purposes, and also to accommodate the offices of the United States Geo- 
logical Survey, an establishment which in its close affiliation to the 
work of the Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum would 
be appropriately quartered in connection therewith. This application 
however was not granted ; but the need is now much greater than be- 
fore, as there is enough material in the way of valuable specimens of 
economical interest to fill a second building the size of the present one. 
This unexhibited surplus is now stored in several buildings, some in 
Washington and some elsewhere, and consists of important illustra- 
tions of the economical geology, metallurgy, and other resources of the 
United States. In addition to what has been on hand for some time, 
very large collections were presented to the Government at the New 
Orleans Exhibition, which embraced a great deal of intrinsic value as 
well as of popular and scientific interest. It is earnestly to be hoped 
that this requirement will be met by Congress by the speedy appropri- 
ation of an amount suitable for the purpose. 

For the safety of the general collections of the National Museum a. 
separate building is also very much needed for the accommodation of 
the alcoholic specimens, such as are now provided by most first-class 
museums. Although the present building is practically fire-proof, yet 
should a fire be started in the vicinity of these specimens it is probable 
that much damage would be done by the ignition of the many thou- 
sands of gallons of alcohol, and the destruction of the specimens and of 
the jars in which they are contained. 

EXPLORATIONS. 

As the present report, in view of the change of the fiscal year of 
the Smithsonian Institution, covers only the period from January 1 to 
June 30, 1885, the account of explorations will necessarily be much 
shorter than usual, especially as such work frequently does not begin 
until midsummer. The completion of the history of 1885 must there- 
fore be deferred until the next report. 

Greenland, Labrador, and the British Provinces. — Eeference has been 
made in a previous report to the return of the Greely expedition and to 
the general results accomplished. Specimens illustrating the botany of 
the region in the vicinity of Lady Franklin Bay have been sent to the 
National Museum by Lieutenant Greely.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 


Mr. Lucien M. Turner has been engaged in preparing his report upon 
the natural history and meteorology of the region about Fort Chimo, 
XJngava Bay, Northern Labrador, where he spent several years, as stated 
in the last report. As he completes his investigations of the various 
collections, they are turned over to the National Museum, and represent 
very important additions to its treasures. The report will be made to 
the U. S. signal officer. 

Important material, especially in geology and palaeontology, has been 
received from the Geological Survey of Canada. 

Alaska. — There has been an unusual amount of activity in the inves 
tigation of the geography and natural history of Alaska, especially the 
northern portion. Lieut. George M. Stoney, of the United States 
Navy, with a force of naval officers and men, has been engaged in con- 
tinuing the explorations made by him in 1884, and already reported 
upon. The revenue cutter Corwin also again visited the Arctic Ocean, 
and parties were sent up the Kowak and other rivers emptying into 
Kotzebue Sound. Mr. Charles H. Townsend, an accomplished collector, 
accompanied the vessel and made many interesting gatherings in nat- 
ural history. Mr. Henry D. Woolfe, agent of the Pacific Steam Whal- 
ing Company, stationed at Cape Lisburne, in the Arctic Ocean, has also 
collected numerous specimens, including shells and marine invertebrates. 
A few of these have been sent in, but the greater part of the collection 
has yet to come. 

Mr. John J. McLean, signal observer at Sitka, has continued his 
transmissions of rare and interesting archaeological material, while Mr. 
W. J. Fisher, at Kodiak, has forwarded additional series of ethnological 
objects, birds, &c. Mr. Johnson, Signal Service observer at Nushagak, 
has transmitted some desirable specimens of birds. 

Washington Territory and the west coast of the United States. — Mr. 
James G. Swan, of Port Townsend, has furnished a number of interest 
ing ethnological specimens, obtained from the Indians of Puget Sound, 
and Ensign A. P. Niblack, U. S. N., attached to the United States Coast 
Survey steamer Carlile P. Patterson, while proceeding in that vessel from 
San Francisco around Cape Horn and thence to Alaska, gathered many 
notes upon the natural history and ethnology of the country, and trans- 
mitted them to the Smithsonian Institution, with quite a number of 
specimens. 

East coast of the United States and Gulf of Mexico. — During the first half 
of the year 1885 the steamer Albatross, of the United States Fish Com- 
mission, continued its important exploration into the fisheries and the 
natural history and physical condition of the waters adjacent to the 
coast of the United States. The winter and early spring were spent in 
the Gulf of Mexico in search of new fishing grounds for valuable fish, 
and in June was commenced a similar work on the banks of Newfound- 


REPORT OF . THE SECRETARY.

land and the other fishing banks still nearer to the coast of New Eng- 
land. The result of these explorations, when published, will be found 
to be of much practical benefit and will add greatly to our information. 

New Mexico and Arizona. — Mr. E. W. Nelson has continued his work 
in connection with the archaeology and natural history of Arizona, and 
has sent in a large number of boxes of valuable collections. 

Dr. E. W. Shufeldt, at Fort Wingate, N. Mex., has also supplied 
much interesting material. 

Dr. F. W. Taylor has sent some rare minerals and fossils from the 
vicinity of Lake VaUey. 

Mexico and Lower California. — Mr. L. H. Aym6, to whom reference 
has been made in previous reports, has continued his explorations and 
investigations into the natural history and ethnology of Western Mexico, 
and has contributed much material to the National Museum. 

Professor Dug^s, of Guanajato, has also sent in a number of interest- 
ing specimens for identification. 

Dr. Edward Palmer was sent to make explorations into the ethnology 
of the regions in the vicinity of Chihuahua, and was enabled by the 
courtesy of Mr. A. E. Shepherd to acquire many interesting articles in 
the neighborhood of Batopilas. 

The investigations of Mr. Charles H. Townsend in regard to the oc- 
currence of the great seal, known as the sea-elephant, were crowned 
with success, some eight or ten specimens having been obtained and 
forwarded to the National Museum. It is confidently asserted that these 
represent the last of the race and that we may fairly consider the species 
as extinct on our coast. 

Central and South America. — Prof. Miles Eock, who was appointed by 
the Government of Guatemala as astronomer in the boundary survey 
between Guatemala and Mexico, kindly offered his services to make 
photographs and collections of any interesting objects he might find, 
and has already fulfilled his promise by the transmission of a large 
amount of material, including photographs, specimens of birds, and ob- 
jects of archaeology. 

Mr. J. C. Zeledon, of Costa Eica, has also continued the transmissions 
begun by him many years ago, and has supplied the National Museum 
with an almost complete collection of the vertebrate animals of that 
country. 

Dr. W. H. Jones, of the United States Navy, was very successful in 
archaeological research on the coast of Peru and Chili, and the specimens 
received from him are among the most highly prized of the articles in 
the National Museum. 

Mr. George Kiefer, of Lima, has also made contributions of the same 
character. 

Europe. — Mr. Thomas Wilson, late consul at Nice, France, has been 
busy during the greater part of his official term as consul, first at Nantes 


10 


REPOET OF THE SECRETARY. 


and then at Nice, in France, in explorations into the remains of prehis- 
toric man, and has presented a very large collection, the unpacking of 
Avhich only awaits his return to this country. It is believed that this 
collection, filling a large number of boxes, will prove to be one of the 
richest and most complete of its kind ever sent to the United States. 

The results of minor researches of more or less productiveness, will 
be detailed in the accompanying report of the'National Museum. 

PUBLICATIONS. 

In view of the fact that the Annual Eeport of the Institution is yearly 
presented to a number of readers for the first time, it seems proper to 
repeat frequently the general statement that the publications prepared 
by it embrace three different classes. These are: 

First, a quarto series of volumes of irregular issue entitled “ Smith- 
sonian Contributions to Knowledge,” which consist of original memoirs 
furnishing additions to scientific information, corresponding somewhat 
with the Transactions of learned societies, though generally form- 
ing more elaborate treatises than such publications. As a rule these 
contributions to positive knowledge are based on experiments, obser- 
vations, or material, carefully undertaken or gathered by the Institu- 
tion, or they are the results of investigations originated or encouraged 
and assisted by its means. 

The second class of publications is an octavo series of volumes en- 
titled “ Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections,” which also include 
the presentation of a large amount of new truths developed by origi- 
nal research, but which contain in addition useful summaries, essays on 
improvements in classification — in zoology, botany, and other depart- 
ments of science, and new and extended tables of physical, chemical, 
and other natural constants ; all of which possess great value in aiding 
the labors of scientific specialists in many directions, and at the same 
time are calculated to encourage inquiring minds to prosecute particu- 
lar lines of investigation, as well as to afford facilities to such students. 

The third class of publications is an octavo series of “ Smithsonian 
Eeports,” presented annually to Congress, which include, in addition to 
the usual record and statement of operations for the year, a consider- 
able amount of carefully prepared matter on various scientific topics 
intended for the general reader. 

Distribution . — These publications are liberally distributed for the dif- 
fusion of knowledge, but from the absolute impossibility of producing 
editions large enough to supply all intelligent inquirers who might be 
interested in their perusal, the distribution is now confined: 1st, to those 
learned societies of the first class which give to the Institution in return 
complete sets of their own publications ; 2d, to colleges of the first 
class furnishing catalogues of their libraries and students, and pub- 
lications relative to their organization and history ; 3d, to public libra-

vies in this country having 25,000 volumes; 4th, they are presented in 
some cases to still smaller libraries, especially if no other copies of the 
Smithsonian publications are given in the same place, and a large dis- 
trict would be otherwise unsupplied. To institutions devoted exclu- 
sively to the promotion of particular branches of knowledge, such of its 
publications are given as relate to their special objects. 

Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge . — A work on “Prehistoric 
Pishing in Europe and North America,” by Dr. Charles Eau, men- 
tioned in my last report (that for 1884) as being in type and nearly 
ready for the press, was printed and published early in the year, and 
has since been distributed in accordance with the general practice 
adopted. This work forms a volume of 342 pages (including the index), 
with 18 pages of introductory matter, in all 360 pages, and is illus- 
trated with 406 figures. Part I, occupying nearly one-third of the 
memoir, is devoted to the archaeological relics of Europe, giving a con- 
cise though comprehensive survey of whatever is supposed to relate to 
fishing, under the three epochs of the palaeolithic age, the neolithic 
age, and the bronze age. Part II is occupied with the archaeological 
fishing relics of North America, under the general headings of “ Pish- 
ing Implements and Utensils,” “Boats and Appurtenances,” “Prehis- 
toric Structures connected with Fishing,” “Aboriginal Eepresentations 
of Fishes, Aquatic Mammals, &c.,” and, lastly, “Artificial Shell-Depos- 
its.” This descriptive summary is supplemented by an interesting col- 
lection of extracts compiled from various writings of the sixteenth, sev- 
enteenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, in which reference is 
made to aboriginal fishing in North America. 

During the past year two volumes of the Contributions to Knowledge 
have been made up from outstanding memoirs. 

Volume XXIY comprises: Article i, “Eesults of Meteorological Ob- 
servations made at Providence, E. I., extending over a period of forty- 
five years, from December, 1831, to December, 1876.” By Prof. Alexis 
Caswell, of Brown University, Providence, E. I. Published in 1882 
(an account of which was given in the Annual Eeport for that year). 
Article ii, “ Tables and Eesults of the Precipitation in Eain and Snow 
in the United States, and at some stations in adjacent parts of North 
America and in Central and South America. Collected by the Smith- 
sonian Institution, and discussed under the direction of Joseph Henry 
and Spencer F. Baird, Secretaries.” By Charles A. Schott. Second 
edition published in 1881 (an account of which was given in the An- 
nual Eeport for that year). The whole forms a volume of 311 pages, 
illustrated with 8 diagrams in the text, and accompanied by 5 plates 
and 5 large folding maps of the United States, showing the curves of 
equal precipitation for each of the four seasons and also for the year. 

Volume XXV comprises: Article i, “Prehistoric Fishing in Europe 
and North America.” By Dr. Charles Eau (just previously described).

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 


13 


A quarter of a century has passed since the publication of the third 
edition of this valuable and elaborate work. The first edition of the 
Tables was published by the Institution in 1852, comprising 212 pages. 
Five years later (in 1857) a second edition was published, with careful 
revision by the author, and the various series of tables were so en- 
larged as to extend the work to over 600 pages. The third edition was 
published in 1859, with still further amendments. 

To this volume Dr. Guyot, with untiring industry, has been making 
constant additions ; and the present issue, projected by him in 1879 (from 
various delays occasioned by pressing professional occupations, as well 
as by illness and death in his family), was about four years in passing 
through the press. Just before completing the last few tables, the esti- 
mable and distinguished author departed this life, February 8, 1884, in 
the seventy-seventh year of his age. The completion of the work was 
intrusted to his able assistant, Prof. William Libbey, jr., who has judi- 
ciously executed his duties as the final editor of the work. The tables 
are arranged in seven series. The first series (comprising 15 tables), 
therm ometrical comparisons and conversions; the second series (of 33 
tables), hygrometrical computations; the third series (of 27 tables), 
barometrical; the fourth series (of 27 tables), hypsometrical; the fifth 
series, geographical tables, including 40 of measures of length (for 
heights, &c.), 10 of itinerary measures, and 10 of square measures of 
geographical surface; the sixth series (of 99 tables) for corrections of 
variations of temperature, &c., at different parts of the earth; and the 
seventh series comprising 9 miscellaneous tables. The whole forms an 
octavo volume (including 25 introductory pages) of 763 pages.

The Scientijie Writings of Joseph Henry . — Good progress has been 
made in the collation and printing of the collected scientific writings of 
Professor Henry ; 600 octavo pages, or more than half the entire work, 
having now (July 1) been set up in type, corrected, and stereotyped. It 
is estimated that the entire work will comprise 1050 pages ; and it is 
hoped that the whole will be stereotyped and printed off by the close 
of the present year. 

Bulletins of the National Museum . — These form a series (as heretofore 
explained) designed to supply a prompt publication of original descrip- 
tions of specimens received by the National Museum, and of other al- 
lied matter. While these are primarily printed under the direction of 
the honorable Secretary of the Interior, a supplementary edition is ])ub- 
lished from the stereotype plates by the Institution for the benefit of 
its correspondents, and they are included in its “ Miscellaneous Collec- 
tions.” 

Bulletin No. 2^ comprises “ Descriptive Catalogues of the Collections 
sent from the United States to the International Fisheries Exhibition, 
London, 1883; constituting a Eeport upon the American Section,” ])re-

ard Clark ; and a catalogue of the fish-cultural exhibit, by E. Edward 
Earll ; the whole forming (with introductory matter and general index) 
an octavo volume of 1333 pages. 

Report on the Reptiles and BatracMans of North America. — The Smith- 
sonian Institution may claim the credit of having done more than any 
other organization or any individual in furnishing to the students and 
naturalists of the country convenient and effective text-books for the 
determination of the natural history of the United States and North 
America. In proof of this itis sufficient to point to what has been done 
in the way of systematic treatises on mammals, birds, fishes, certain 
groups of mollusks, &c. 

Although a number of monographs of reptiles have been published 
more or less directly under its auspices, such as that of the serpents 
and other groups, there is still lacking a compact manual of both the 
reptilia and batrachia ; and arrangements were accordingly made with 
Professor Cope, of Philadelphia, to supply this want. This gentleman is 
, well known for hisprofessional acquaintance x^ith these groups as studied 
by him in the collections in the Museum of the Academy of Natural Sci- 
ences of Philadelphia, the National Museum of Washington, and else- 
where. An agreement was therefore made with him for the preparation 
of a much-needed manual on the reptiles and batrachians of North Amer- 
ica ; a year’s time being allowed, at a suitable compensation, for the final 
and critical examination of the collections of the National Museum and 
the preparation of the report. In this way the entire field of the ver- 
tebrates of North America will have been completely covered.

The Smithsonian Annual Report . — The third class of publications con- 
sists of Annual Eeports of the Board of Eegents of the Smithsonian 
Institution, presented to Congress, and printed by authority of that body. 
The Eeport of 1883 was not issued till 1885. It contains the report of 
the Secretary of the Institution for the year, supplemented by the cor- 
respondence relative to the transfer of astronomical announcements by 
telegraph to Harvard College Observatory; the report on the operations 
of the Smithsonian system of international and domestic exchanges ; 
and the report of the Assistant Director of the National Museum on 
the condition of that department, together with a general Appendix, 
embracing a record of scientific progress for the year, — in astronomy, by 
Edward S. Holden ; geology, by T. Sterry Hunt ; geography, by F. M. 
Green; meteorology, by Cleveland Abbe; physics, by George F. Barker ;

Nutting, and J. Owen Dorsey. The Eeport forms an octavo volume of 
997 pages (including introductory matter and index), illustrated with 
33 figures and sketch-maps and 1 plate. 

The “Annual Eeport of the Board of Eegents of the Smithsonian In- 
stitution, for the year 1884,” forming an 8vo. volume of 943 pages (in- 
cluding introductory matter and index), has been most unfortunately 
delayed, and is not yet published. 

Publications of the Bureau of Ethnology . — To the three preceding classes 
of established jiublications (one of quarto size, and two of ordinary oc- 
tavo size), a fourth class, of imperial octavo size, embracing the publi- 
cations of the Bureau of Ethnology, under the direction of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, may now properly be added. Of this series two vol- 
umes have already appeared. 

The “First Annual Eeport of the Bureau of Ethnology, to the Smith- 
sonian Institution,” by J. W. Powell, Director, though published two 
years ago, was not noticed in the last report of the Secretary. This 
work contains papers by J. W. Powell (in addition to his report proper),

matter and index), and is illustrated with 60 figures in the text, 2 maps, 
and 173 plates, of which 12 are colored. The plates contain about 750 
separate figures. 

INTEENATIONAE EXCHANGES. 

One of the most important factors in the “diffusion of knowledge 
among men” is found in the system of international exchange carried 
on by the Smithsonian Institution. Originally only intended for the dis- 
tribution of its own publications, the Institution by degrees extended 
its usefulness and privileges to learned societies and individuals of both 
hemispheres, and at present this exchange service forms the medium 
of scientific intercourse between about 700 home institutions and 4,000 
establishments distributed over all parts of the inhabited globe. 

The gradual development of this service has resulted in a large in- 
crease both in the work to be performed and in the number of employes. 
The management of this branch has, since the year 1880, been in charge 
of Mr. George H. Boehmer, and to his detailed report, hereto appended, 
I refer for more minute information. 

Statistics . — Tbe increase in the number of parcels received will best be 
illustrated by the following comparison of the first six months of 1885 
with the full years of 1882, 1883, and 1884:

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 


19 


The transmissions of exchanges have been in direct ratio to the 
increase in the receipts, being for the first six months of 1885 : 

(1) Foreign exchanges: 345 boxes, representing a bulk of 2,415 cubic 
feet, with a weight of 82,800 pounds, against 276 boxes during the same 
period of 1884. 

(2) Domestic exchanges : 5,138 packages, this being a little above the 
half of the total number sent out during the year 1884. 

(3) Government exchanges: 38 boxes, representing a bulk of 266 cubic 
feet, with a weight of 10,500 pounds. 

Congressional. Aid. — The Smithsonian Institution continues to receive 
the usual Congressional appropriation of $10,000 to carry out the op- 
erations of the exchange service. The Library of Congress is the prin- 
cipal beneficiary of the exchanges, large numbers of books and parcels 
being annually received for that institution. 

Transportation Companies. — A very important contribution toward the 
expenses of the exchange service consists in the granting of free freight 
on the exchange parcels or boxes by the following transportation com- 
panies and firms, for which liberality acknowledgments are hereby grate- 
fully rendered :

The concessions of reduced freight on the part of the Pennsylvania

well as by the line of freight steamers between Washington and New 
York, have been continued. 

The thanks of the Institution are also due to the foreign ministers and 
consuls of the various Governments for their assistance in taking charge 
of the transmission of .boxes to the countries which they respectively 
represent. 

Government Exchanges . — By enactment of Congress of March 2, 1867, 
the Institution was appointed the agent of the United States in an ex- 
change of ofiQcial public documents with foreign Governments. As pro- 
vided for by Congress, 50 copies of all official publications, whether ema- 
nating from Congress or any Department or Bureau of the Government, 
whether printed at the Congressional Printing Office or elsewhere, must 
be delivered to the Library of Congress for distribution by the Smith- 
sonian Institution and to such foreign Governments as are willing to 
furnish to the Library of Congress a corresponding return from their 
publications. The conditions of this exchange having been accepted 
by 38 Governments — of which 19 are European — one box (the 23d of the 
series since the establishment of this exchange) of United States pub- 
lications was sent to each of these Governments in April, 1885. 

The returns having for some years fallen considerably short of ex. 
pectations, Mr. George H. Boehmer, in charge of the exchange office, 
was detailed, at the request of the Librarian of Congress, and with the 
sanction of the chairman of the Joint Committee on the Library, to 
visit Europe for the purpose of arranging for better and fuller returns 
on the part of those Governments exchanging with the United States. 
For detailed information of the progress of his mission, success ob- 
tained, and suggestions relative to the service, I would refer to the re- 
port on the subject contained in the section ‘‘ Government exchange 
division” of his report on the operations of the exchange office, hereto 
appended. 

Mr. Boehmer left on his mission on the 24th of July, 1884, and re- 
turned on the 20th .of February, 1885, during which time he visited con- 
secutively nearly all the European states, obtaining satisfactory re- 
sults and securing large and valuable additions for the library, consist- 
ing mostly of parliamentary papers and compilations of the laws of the 
various Governments. 

One of the principal obstacles preventing the establishment of per- 


REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 


21 


manently satisfactory measures on the part of the European Govern- 
ments, and which can perhaps be obviated by a personal representation 
in Europe, is caused by the entirely different understanding of the ex- 
change question in those countries, resulting from the exchange conven- 
tions of Paris in 1875 and 1880, and Brussels in 1883, and by the absence 
of sufficient legislation by them for securing copies of official publica- 
tions for exchange purposes. 

The governmental bureaus of most of the European states issue their 
publications through the medium of publishing houses, receiving from 
these about 50 per cent, from the sales of the books. Copies for gra- 
tuitous distribution, therefore, are not issued, but the books represent 
a trade value which is accepted by the exchange Commissions (estab- 
lished on the basis adopted at the Paris Conveution of 1875), who are 
allowed only to exchange value for value. 

The publications of the United States, being issued at the public ex- 
pense, and not considered as purchased (although they are quoted at 
very high prices in the book trade, and especially abroad), it becomes 
under these circumstances difficult to obtain in Europe satisfactory 
returns. It is therefore suggested by Mr. Boehmer that in future 
trausactious the market value, as given by the foreign book trade, be 
accepted, which would enable our Government to obtain more satisfac- 
tory returus. 

Preliminary arrangements have been effected with the Imperial Gov- 
ernment of Austria for a complete exchange of all the official and sci- 
entific publicatioDs of the two Governments. 

The Government of Uruguay has also forwarded to the Smithsonian 
Institution, through the United States Department of State, proposi- 
tions relative to a full and permanent exchange of official public docu- 
ments.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 


CO-OPERATIVE RELATIONS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. 

Duplicate Collection of Building Stones for the American Museum of Nat- 
ural History, New York. — Among the various important subjects of in- 
quiry on the part of the census organisation of 1880, was one into the 
statistics of the quarries in the United States used to furnish building 
stones for building and ornamental purposes, and an arrangement was 
made by General Walker with Dr. G. W. Hawes, curator of mineralogy 
and lithology of the National Museum, to collect the necessary material, 
and to prepare a complete report on the subject, this to be done at the 
expense of the United States. General Walker also authorized an ar- 
rangement by which, on payment of all the costs, Mr. Morris K. Jesup 
was to have a duplicate collection, with a view to its presentation to the 
American Museum of Natural History. Estimating the cost of acquisi- 
tion of the specimens and their preparation, including a microscopical 
section of each specimen, at $3.50 each, and the number of specimens 
to be treated at one thousand, the sum of $3,500 was placed at the com- 
mand of Dr. Hawes for the purpose in question. The work upon this 
series was prosecuted with much vigor until interrupted by the death 
of Dr. Hawes. During the present year however, the work was re- 
newed, and the necessary means being furnished by Mr. Jesup, extra 
workmen were employed upon his collection, which will probably be 
ready for delivery in the course of the year 1885. By thus duplicat- 
ing the collection without expense to the Smithsonian Institution or 
the National Museum, the opportunity of study and comparison will be, 
of course, greatly extended. 

Bureau of Education. — In accordance with the general policy of the 
Institution to do nothing with its funds which can equally well be done 
by other means, and to co-operate with other bureaus and departments 
of the Government, the Institution turned over to the Commissioner of 
Education 3,326 catalogues, announcements and reports of colleges and 
educational institutions, together with 401 letters, and 1,978 card-slips, 
containing an alphabetical list of the entire series. 

The Diplomatic Review. — In March, 1883, the conductors of “The 
Diplomatic Eeview” of England sent to the Smithsonian Institution an 
offer of the Eeview to any library that would undertake to bind it. 

By some strange mishap the letter containing this very liberal offer 
went astray, and no attention was paid to it. In October, 1884, the 
offer was renewed by Mr. 0. D. Collet, the letter being accompanied by 
a list of libraries to which the Eeview had been sent direct. This letter 
was the initiatory step of a correspondence, which will eventually result 
in the distribution of several hundred sets of the Diplomatic Eeview, as 
full as the conductors thereof can furnish. 

The Diplomatic Eeview commenced in 1855, and carried on to the end 
of 1865, under the title of the Free Press, is a continuation of the first 


REPOET OF THE SECRETARY. 


23 


and second series of the Portfolio^ in which, nearly half a century ago, 
the late Mr. William Pollard Urquhart began h’s series of articles on 
the political history of Europe. In the pages of the Diplomatic Review 
will be found Eussian secret dispatches, together with other rare and 
interesting documents on the history of Europe from the time of the 
Protocol of April 4, 1826, for the “Pacification of Greece,” to the end of 
the Servian war, in 1876. Besides these scarce documents, the Diplo- 
matic Review contains many original works of Mr. Urquhart, and a mass 
of the transactions of the Foreign Affairs Committees of Workingmen 
formed by him at the time of the Crimean war. 

Among these papers the following may be mentioned: Will of Peter 
the Great, brought to Paris by the Chevalier d’Eon in 1757 ; Dangerto 
the Political Balance of Europe, by Gustavus III, King of Sweden, 
1791; Protocol of a Conference at Constantinople between the British 
Ambassador and the Divan on the Connexion of Eussia with the Greek 
Eevolt, 1822; Memoir of Count Bernstorff to the King of Prussia on 
the means of annexing the Minor German States, 1831, &c. 

On the 18th of April, 1885, in pursuance of the above-mentioned 
notice, a printed circular was sent to over 400 of the principal libraries, 
educational institutions, and kindred establishments, to the following 
effect : 

This Institution is informed by the Conductors of The Diplomatic Review of England, 
that “ a set of the twenty-five volumes of the Review, stitched and wrapped in seven 
hooks,” will be presented to your library “on the condition of your binding them, so 
that they may be safely preserved for’ reference.” 

The Diplomatic Review extends from the 13th of October, 1855, to the 3d of Jan- 
uary, 1877, and contains rare and interesting documents relative to the history of 
Europe from 1826 to 1870. It is proper to notify you that the successive volumes were 
printed in different sizes : 

Book I is in folio, and comprises two volumes. 

Books II, III, and IV, are quarto, comprising sixteen volumes. 

Books V, VI, and VII, are octavo, comprising seven volumes, and supplement. 

Please notify this Institution whether this offer is accepted by your library ; or, if 
you have already received a set, whether you desire another on the same terms. 

Eeplies to the above were received as follows : 236 accepted the en- 
tire set; 8 desired portions to complete partial sets previously received, 
and 43 declined, generally on tbe ground tbat the character of the in- 
formation contained in the Eeview did not come within the scope of 
the library. Quite a number of libraries have not noticed the circular 
or the offer contained. 

A list was prepared, and sent to Mr. C. D. Collet, of those libraries 
which accepted, and inasmuch as the sets were all declared to be more 
or less incomplete, preference was given to the more important libra- 
ries, in order that the volumes might reach the greatest number of 
readers. 

Newfoundland Postage on Exchanges. — An arrangement has been made 
with the postmaster-general of Newfoundland by which all matter re- 


24 


REPOET OF THE SECRETARY. 


laticg to the exchange system shall be passed through the mails under 
frank of the Smithsonian Institution, the chief clerk of which certifies 
to the contents of each package. 

Zoological Specimens for the Museum, contributed by Menageries. — For a 
number of years the Institution has been indebted to the proprietors of 
the menageries of the country for the contribution of animals dying 
from disease or otherwise while in their charge, the principal establish- 
ments in this connection being those of Messrs. Barnum, Bailey, and 
Hutchinson; Mr. Adam Forepaugh; the Central Park Menagerie, in 
charge of Mr. W. A. Conklin; and the Zoological Gardens at Philadel- 
phia, under the direction of Mr. A. E. Brown. 

From time to time specimens have been received in this way, and thus 
a large number of highly-prized additions have been made. The addi- 
tional advantage of having them in the flesh in more or less perfect con- 
dition, enables them to be mounted under the best possible auspices. 

In order to make some return to the contributors, the Institution 
offered to have post-mortem examinations instituted of specimens re- 
ceived, and the cause of death or disease reported to the senders. For 
this purpose, the co-operation of the Army Medical Museum was in- 
voked and was cheerfully rendered, and an examination of each subject 
received is usually made under the direction of Dr. John S. Billings. 

The National Museum reserves the skins and skeletons, while the 
Army Medical Museum makes any preparations of the viscera, &c., 
that may be desired by it. 

NECROLOGY. 

From among those connected with the Institution, I have but one 
death to record. 

Edward Foreman, M. D., was born in Baltimore, October 29, 1808. 
After reaching manhood, he was for 12 years an assistant professor in 
the University of Pennsylvania. In 1848, he was appointed an assist- 
ant in the Smithsonian Institution by Professor Henry. He was en- 
gaged in organizing the meteorological system established by the In- 
stitution, and rendered efficient service in this department ; and also 
in conducting the correspondence and arranging the details of the 
scientific lectures. In 1852 he accepted the position of chief examiner 
in the Patent Office, which he retained for eight years. In 1874 he re- 
turned to the Smithsonian Institution as an assistant in the ethnologi- 
cal division of the National Museum. His death occurred April 14, 
1885, at his residence in this city. 

MISCELLANEOUS. 

The Tyndall Trust Fund. — It will be remembered that when Prof. 
John TyndaU of the Eoyal Institution of Great Britain, at the sohcita- 
tion of scientific friends in this country, made a visit to it in the latter 


REPORT OF. THE SECRETARY. 


25 


part ol' 1872, for the purpose of delivering in a few of our principal cities 
courses of lectures on physical science, he very generously presented 
the entire net proceeds of his lectures to trustees for the purpose of pro- 
moting science in this country. These popular lecturfes, eloquently pre- 
sented and admirably illustrated experimentally, were attended by large 
and appreciative audiences in Boston, New Haven, New York, Brook- 
lyn, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington. 

Professor Tyndall’s trust deed, executed in New York, February 7, 
1873, just before his departure for England, was forwarded with a 
friendly personal letter of the same date, to Professor Henry of this In- 
stitution, and was published in full in the Smithsonian Eeport of 1872, 
pages 104-106. By this grant it was found that he assigned to our peo- 
ple the liberal fund of $13,033, in the following gracious terms, — omitting 
here all but the more essential passages : 

“As an evidence of my good-will toward the people of the United 
States, I desire to devote this sum of $13,033 to the advancement of 
theoretic science and the promotion of original research, especially in 
the department of physics, in the United States. 

“To accomplish this object I hereby appoint Prof. Joseph Henry, Sec- 
retary of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington City, D. C., Dr. E. 
L. Youmans, of New York, and General Hector Tyndale, of Philadelphia, 
to act as a board of trustees to take charge of the above sum — to care- 
fully invest it in permanent securities; and I further direct that the 
said board shall, for the present, appropriate the interest of the fund 
in supporting or in assisting to support, at such European universities 
as they may consider most desirable, two American pupils who may 
evince decided talents in physics, and who may express a determina- 
tion to devote their lives to this work. My desire would be that each 
pupil should spend four years at a German university — three of those 
years to be devoted to the acquisition of knowledge, and the fourth to 
original investigation. 

“ If however in the progress of science in the United States, it should 
at any time appear to the said board that the end herein proposed 
would be better subserved by granting aid to students, or for some 
special researches in this country, the board is authorized to make the 
appropriations from the income of the fund for such purposes, 

“ I further direct that vacancies which may occur in said board, by 
death or otherwise, shall be filled by the president of the National 
Academy of Sciences.” 

Even with the wise and far-seeing provision for discretion of judg- 
ment vested in the trustees by the donor, they experienced much 
greater difficulty in satisfactorily carrying into effect the enlightened 
purpose of the grant than could have been anticipated. One promising 
student, in the uncertainty of devoting his life to the career of scientific 
research contemplated, very honorably returned to the trustees the sum 
advanced to him. Another, after hesitating as to the condition of re- 
maining for four years in a German or other European university, 
finally declined to avail himself of the opportunity afforded him. It 
thus resulted, from the conscientious administration of the trust, and 
the earnest desire of the trustees to execute the expressed wishes of 


26 


REPOET OF THE SECRETARY. 


Professor Tyndall, that but a small portion of the income of the fund 
has been expended, and the original sum has been thereby augmented. 

On the death of two of the trustees — Professor Henry, at Washing- 
ton, and General H. Tyndale, at Philadelphia, — Dr. F. A. P. Barnard, of 
New York, and Prof. Joseph Lovering, of Cambridge, Mass., were duly 
appointed as their successors; and how judiciously the trustees have 
continued to husband the resources committed to them is sufficiently 
evinced by the remarkable fact that the Tyndall fund has now ac- 
cumulated, by the constant addition to it of the unappropriated income, 
from the original sum of $13,000, to $32,000. 

Under these circumstances the distinguished donor has been induced 
to modify the original conditions of the gift, so as to divide the in- 
creased principal into three separate funds (of nearly $11,000 each), and 
to give the charges thereof, respectively, to Harvard College at Cam- 
bridge, Columbia College at New York, and the University of Pennsyl- 
vania at Philadelphia, for the perpetual maintenance in each of these 
institutions of learning, of a graduate fellowship in the department of 
physics. There can be little doubt that this change of the direction 
was, under the peculiar circumstances, eminently judicious; and that 
the several endowments will constitute brilliant prizes to aspiring 
American students, and will greatly contribute to the noble purpose of 
their founder — ^^the stimulation of original research, and the advance- 
ment of physical science in the United States. 

UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Arrangement of material . — The regular work of the Museum has been 
considerably interrupted during the six months now under consideration 
by the participation of the Museum in the World’s Industrial and Cotton 
Centennial Exposition at New Orleans. Several members of the staff 
were in attendance at this exposition, in custody of the collections of the 
Museum there displayed, and in May and June ten curators and me- 
chanics were sent to New Orleans to attend to the re-packing and for- 
warding of the collections sent by the Smithsonian Institution, as well 
as to care for the numerous exhibits transferred to the Museum by for- 
eign and domestic exhibitors at the close of the exposition. The extent 
of these accessions was very considerable. One hundred and seventy-six 
thousand pounds of exhibits were sent to New Orleans. Of this amount 
138,624 pounds were sent direct, 19,814 pounds from Cincinnati, and 
17,631 pounds from Louisville, at each of which places the Smithsonian 
Institution had displayed large exhibits during the^ summer of 1884 
320,744 pounds were returned, including 51,267 pounds received from the 
State Department, whose valuable exhibit, gathered by the United States 
consuls all over the world, was transferred in bulk to the National Mu- 
seum with the understanding that a limited number of loan exhibits 
were reserved for return to their owners. Besides this amount, 74,489 


REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 


27 


pounds were acquired by gifts from Mexico and other sources. In ad- 
dition to the collections consigned directly to the Museum from Hew 
Orleans, the important collection illustrating the uses of American woods, 
gathered for the exhibit of the Agricultural Department by Mr. William 
Saunders, has, since its receipt in Washington, been delivered to the 
Museum. At the beginning of July a considerable portion of the collec- 
tions had already been received, and many of the exhibition halls of the 
Museum, which before this time had been reduced to an appearance of 
order, were becoming filled up with the unopened boxes and cases. It is 
however confidently expected that before the end of the calendar year 
the new material will be unpacked and brought under control. A 
special appropriation of $7,500 was made by Congress for the packing 
and forwarding of the new material, and for repairing and reinstalling 
the original collection. The Hew Orleans Exposition, although its in- 
fluence was perhaps less comprehensive than that at Philadelphia in 
1876, has nevertheless accomplished a great work in the South and 
West, both from commercial and educational standpoints, and in my 
judgment the money appropriated for the display of the Smithsonian 
Institution (including the United States Hational Museum and Fish 
Commission) has been productive of important results to the country. 
There can be no doubt that the Hational Museum has been the gainer 
by the undertaking, although the work of final arrangement has re- 
ceived a temporary set-back. 

The general work of the Museum has been for the most part of the 
same character as that described in my reports for the last three years, 
and in nearly every department the curator states that decided progress 
has been made in the development both of the study and the exhibition 
series of specimens. The work of case-construction has been steadUy 
carried forward, and during the coming year the collections will be more 
thoroughly classified than has hitherto been possible, by the assignment 
of definite space for each department in the exhibition halls. The gal- 
leries of the main exhibition hall in the Smithsonian building have been 
cleared of the old exhibition cases, which proved to be inadequate to 
present needs, and the space is being used temporarily for the overhaul- 
ing and arrangement of certain large collections in the departments of 
birds, mollusks, marine invertebrates, invertebrate paleontology, and 
ethnology. This step has been found absolutely necessary, since the 
space in the crowded laboratory rooms was not sufficient to admit of 
any general rearrangement. 

Museum Publications . — The various publications of the Museum have 
been, as hitherto, under the editorial supervision of Dr. Tarleton H. 
Bean. The seventh volume of the “Proceedings” was finished in Feb- 
ruary, and of the eighth volume, the printing of which was begun in 
March, 221 pages were printed prior to the 1st of July. At the present 
time four Bulletins are in the hands of the printer, Ho. 23, “Biblio- 
graphy of the Publications of Isaac Lea, LL. D., by Hewton Pratt

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 


Scudder: No. 28, “A manual of American Land Shells,” by W. G. Bin- 
ney: No. 29, “Results of Ornithological Explorations in the Comman- 
der Islands and in Kamtschatka,” by Leonhard Stejneger, and No. 30, 
“Bibliography of Publications relating to the collection of fossil inver- 
tebrates in the United States National Museum, including complete 
lists of the writings of Fielding B. Meek, Charles A. White, and Charles 
D. Walcott,” by John Belknap Marcou.* Circular 32, “Classification 
of the Materia Medica Collection of the U. S. National Museum, and 
Catalogue of Specimens,” by Dr. James M. Flint, revised and extended 
by Dr. Henry G. Beyer; and Circular 33, “Notes on the preparation of 
rough skeletons,” by Frederic A. Lucas, have also been published. 

The publication of the special report upon the fisheries of the' United 
States, in quarto, which, in addition to its descriptive, historical, and 
statistical contents, will in reality constitute a monograph of the Amer- 
ican portion of the fisheries collection in the Museum, has been going 
through the press under the supervision of the Assistant Director and 
Mr. A. H. Clark, who are rendering this service to the Fish Commission 
as volunteers. 

Museum Library . — The accessions to the Museum library, including 
books and pamphlets, have been 454. Early in the year Mr. H. W. 
Spofford was appointed assistant to Mr. F. W. True, the librarian. 

Visitors. — The total number of visitors to the National Museum dur- 
ing the first half of 1885 was 107,365, a daily average of 692f . 

Meetings in the Lecture Hall . — The lecture hall, as in previous years, 
has been used for the meetings of several societies, viz, the National 
Academy of Sciences,, the American Fisheries Society, the Biological 
Society of Washington, the Society of Naturalists of North America, 
and the Entomological Society of Washington. 

Saturday Lectures . — Twelve Saturday lectures, under the auspices of 
the Biological and Anthropological Societies of Washington, were de- 
livered in the lecture hall on successive Saturday afternoons, and were 
well attended. Many of these lectures had direct reference to the work 
of the Museum, and were illustrated by specimens from the cases. 

Museum Report . — A special report upon the Museum having been or- 
dered by Congress, the reports of the Assistant Director and curators 
for the year 1884, together with the accompanying statistics and the 
scientific papers based upon the collections in the National Museum, 
have been in a measure separated from the regular Smithsonian report, 
forming Part II of the same, and being arranged in a separate volume. 

In accordance with my custom in previous years, I shall here present 
a brief review of what has been accomplished in each department, refer- 
ring to the special Museum report for the full discussion of the additions 

* These form Parts II and III of “Bibliographies of American Naturalists,” and are 
shaped in reference to the long contemplated scheme of publishing a complete bibli- 
ographical record of all papers relating to the collections in the National Museum.

are administered by twenty-four curators, honorary curators, and act- 
ing curators, of which number at present only nine receive salaries 
from the Museum appropriation. Of the remaining fifteen, five are of- 
ficers connected with the Geological Survey ; one, an officer of the Bureau 
of Ethnology ; two, officers of the Fish Commission ; two, officers in the 
United States Army ; one, an officer in the United States Xavy ; one, 
an officer in the Agricultural Department; and one, professor of chemis- 
try in Wesleyan University; the remaining two are Museum officers,

tailed for this service by the Surgeon-General of the Navy, is in excel- 
lent condition, and tlie collection is the most extensive of its kind in 
America. The work of labelling has been finished, and during the year 
the exhibition series will be extended and rearranged. Dr. Beyer is 
prosecuting a chemical investigation of the different species of cinchona 
barks in the collection, numbering over one hundred, and has made 
some important determinations of the alkaloids of some cinchona barks 
from new regions in Guatemala and Gosta Rica. He has also carried on 
investigations upon the physiological actions of atropia, cocaine, and 
caffeine, on the circulatory apparatus, the results of which have already 
been published in the “American Journal of the Medical Sciences.” 
Other experiments on the action of atropine on the heart and of blood 
at different temperatures on the same, have been discussed in the Pro- 
ceedings of the Museum. 

In the section of foods, under the honorary euratorship of Professor 
Atwater, some progress has been made in the work of building up a 
collection illustrating the physiological action of foods and the composi- 
tion of the human body, similar to the famous collection in the Bethnal 
Green Museum, in London. Mr. Hitchcock, who is acting curator of this 
collection, has, however, devoted most of his time to the development of 
the section of text iles, which is directly under his charge. This section 
has been largely increased by donations from abroad, but especially 
through collections made by himself while preparing for the Exposition 
at New Orleans. The object of these collections is twofold, first, to af- ' 
ford an exhibit of the various textile fibers available for use in this coun- 
try and abroad, with specimens of articles made therefrom, such as cloth, 
rope, twine, mats, &c.; second, to provide a series of specimens of every 
fiber that can be used in the arts, to be used for scientific examination, 
tests of tensile strength, and especially to serve as type specimens 
for the identification of other fibers by microscopical examination. A 
number of collections which have been received are worthy of special 
mention. Among these, a particularly fine set of fibers from Brazil, 
collected by Dr. J. Carlos Berrinni, of Quissaman, who has devoted un- 
usual care and labor to the work. All the textile fibers in the Museum , 
of the Department of Agriculture were placed in Mr. Hitchcock’s charge 
during January, and from this collection some valuable specimens have 
been selected and placed on exhibition. Mr. George W. Bond, of Boston, 
has selected a large collection of native and foreign wools from samples 
belonging to the United States customs department which have been pre- 
pared for exhibition; they are not yet on exhibition, as the cases 
for their display have not been made. This collection is probably al- 
ready the best thing of the kind to be found in any museum, and when all 
the wools belonging to the Museum collections are mounted, the display 
of this textile will be, if not quite complete, at least very large and valua- 
ble. Owing to the restricted floor space in the Museum which has been 
assigned to this department, it has been impossible to make the display

of specimens as instructive and attractive as it might be. By far the 
greater part of the collection^ and some of the most interesting speci- 
mens, have been sent to the Ex[)osition at New Orleans, where this de- 
partment was well represented. A detailed account however of the 
display there made would not be of interest in this report, and the sub- 
ject may be passed over with the statement that there were sent to 
New Orleans 290 unit boxes to represent the textiles department of 
the Museum. The display is said to have been very attractive. Mr. 
Hitchcock has also been requested to take charge of the physical ap- 
paratus belonging to the Smithsonian Institution which has been trans- 
ferred to the National Museum and placed in cases-. The arrangement 
has been necessarily very unsystematic, owing to the limited space at 
his disposal, but in a general way it is classified under three heads, 
namely, apparatus for experiments on (1) sound, (2) heat and light, 
and (3) electricity. A list of the instruments in this collection (which 
is of interest as having been used by Professor Henry) is in course of 
preparation. In connection with it may be mentioned the relics of 
electrical and chemical apparatus of Dr. Joseph Priestley, which is on 
exhibition in the same place. 

The collection of historical relics has received but little attention 
during the six months, and no effort is at present being made to increase 
its extent. Perhaps no part of the Museum is more attractive to visitors 
than that in which the relics of General Washington are displayed, and 
it is believed that the section of historical relics will receive from year to 
year a constant increment of valuable memorials of the past. The heirs 
of General Eobert E. Lee have presented a claim for the recovery of 
articles of furniture removed from Arlington in 1862, and since then on 
exhibition with the Washington relics at the Patent Office and in the 
Museum. Most of these appear never to have been the property of 
General Washington. They will however be held in the Museum until 
official instructions for their delivery have been received. 

There has been little activity in connection with the section of fish- 
eries, the section of naval architecture, and the collection of musical 
instruments, all of which are however in excellent order and have 
been considerably extended, though without direct effort. 

An illustrated catalogue of the Gatlin collection of Indian paintings 
has been prepared by Mr. Thomas Donaldson, and will soon be offered 
for publication. 

Mr. J. E. Watkins, of Camden, N. J., who is one of the leading au- 
thorities in the country upon the history of railroads and steam trans- 
portation, and who is indorsed by many of the leading railroad men of 
the country, was appointed in June honorary curator of the section of 
steam transportation. It is intended, as opportunity offers, to gather 
in the Museum a collection of objects illustrating the history of Amer- 
ican railroads and steamboats, with a view to preserving permanently 
the memorials of the gi’owth of this most important interest which has 


32 


KEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 


been so closely connected with the material progress of the United 
States. Several important specimens have already been received, 
notably the “John Bull” locomotive engine, which was built in 1831 
in England by George and Eobert Stephenson for the “ Camden and Am- 
boy Bail and Tramway Company,” by which this engine was used from 
1831 to 1861. This is now stored at the Armory building, but will be 
placed on exhibition as soon as proper space can be provided. 

Department of Ethnology . — The Curator of this department. Prof. Otis 
T. Mason, having gathered the ethnological material belonging to the 
Museum during the last half of 1884, commenced in 1885 its methodical 
arrangement. The basketry, throwing-sticks, sinew-backed bows, and 
the whole series of arrows, have been studied and classified, so as to 
illustrate their distribution, tribal characteristics, and evolution. It is 
designed to continue this system in the remaining portions of the col- 
lection, with the view of better unfolding through the arts of savagery 
the origin and development of civilization. 

During the past six months the Curator made two official yisits to the 
New Orleans Exposition, for the purpose of securing for the National 
Museum Some of the material exhibited by the Departments of the Gen- 
eral Government and of foreign countries. By this means the Museum 
has obtained a large number of accessions. Material of especial value 
was also received from Eev. C. H. A. Dali, of Calcutta ; Eev. Dr. George 
W. Samson ; Mr. James Stevenson, of the Bureau of Ethnology, and 
others, which will be fully described in the Eeport on the National Mu- 
seum. 

Mr. William H. Holmes, of the Bureau of Ethnology, has continued 
the installation of aboriginal pottery, directing his efforts chiefly to la- 
belling, cataloguing, and classifying the accessions received in the sum- 
mer and fall of 1884. The very extensive collections of Pueblo material 
made for the World’s Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition in 
New Orleans, arrived too late to be made fully available for exhibition, 
but a small representative series of vessels and other objects of clay 
was forwarded to New Orleans. The collection of ancient pottery, re- 
cently obtained from Chiriqui, Panama, and partly paid for from the 
exposition funds, was also represented. The most important accessions 
have been from the explorations ot Mr. L. H. Aymd, in Mexico. It is 
hoped that a portion, at least, of the pottery court wiU be opened to 
the public by the end of the present calendar year. 

Department of Antiquities. — Dr. Charles Eau has continued his work 
iu the department of antiquities, carrying on toward completion the 
system of arrangement which he began ten years ago. He reports im- 
portant accessions from the Bureau of Ethnology ; from explorations of 
Edward Palmer in Arizona; from Oaxaca, Mexico, by L. H. Aym6; from 
Costa Eica, by J. C. Zeledon ; and from the island of Guadaloupe by L. 
Guesde. An exceedingly valuable collection of casts of the antiquities 
of Mexico and Yucatan has been deposited in the Museum by Senor 


EEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 


33 


Eufemio Abadiano, of Mexico, by whom they were made. This collec- 
tion includes full-size reproductions of several exceedingly important ob- 
jects, such as the Mexican Aztec Calendar Stone, the Sacrificial Stone, 
the Aztec Goddess of Death (Teoyoamiqui), and the wonderful reclining 
figure of Chac-Mool. This collection has been forwarded from I^Tew Or- 
leans and will soon be on exhibition, and it is hoped that by some means 
it may ultimately become the property of the Museum. It will be in- 
stalled by the side of the Lorillard collection and other Central Amer- 
ican antiquities. These two collections of casts, together with the orig- 
inals already in possession of the Museum, will entirely fill one of the 
small exhibition galleries and constitute a display of native American 
sculpture and architecture which is equalled nowhere else in the world. 

Department of Mammals . — At the beginning of the year the work of 
the mammal department, incident upon the preparation of a collection 
to be exhibited in New Orleans, having been entirely completed, the 
regular routine work was resumed. The mammal exhibition hall had 
been rendered less attractive than formerly by the removal of numerous 
large specimens for the New Orleans Exposition, and a temporary re- 
arrangement of the collections was attempted in order to make the 
vacancies less conspicuous. During the first quarter of the year thirty- 
three mounted specimens were added to the exhibition series, including 
several large forms, such as a Siberian sheep, a baboon, &c. A list of 
all the mounted mammals was made in February, and soon afterwards 
temporary labels were written and distributed among the specimens. 
Manuscript for printed labels for the entire series was also prepared. 

In April the director of the Museum ofiered a reward for the capture 
of a specimen of a spotted dolphin, said to be abundant in the Gulf of 
Mexico. A fresh specimen was soon afterwards received through Messrs. 
Warren & Stearns, of Pensacola, Fla., and proved to be of remarkable 
scientific interest. On the 9th of April three telegrams were received 
from life-saving station keepers announcing the stranding of cetaceans, 
two having reference to blackfish stranded near Cape Henry, and the 
third to a fin-back whale ashore near Truro, Mass. The most interesting 
cetacean specimens received during the half-year were a male pygmy 
sperm-whale {Kogia) and the skull of an Atlantic right- whale {Balcena 
cisarctica). 

Messrs. Barnum, Bailey, and Hutchinson, Mr. Adam Forepaugh, and 
the authorities of the Philadelphia Zoological Gardens (through Mr. A. 
E. Brown), and the Central Park Menagerie (through Mr. W. A. Conk- 
lin), have continued to send many interesting animals in the flesh. 

In June the chief taxidermist was ordered to New Orleans to super- 
intend the packing of the mammals exhibited in that city. During his 
stay he negotiated an exchange in behalf of the Museum by which three 
valuable species of quadrumana were acquired, including a specimen of 
the interesting gibbon, Hylobates concolor. The New Orleans exhibit

was not received at the Museum until after the 1st of July. (For a d<3- 
tailed account of this collection see Museum Eeport, 1884, p. 129.) 

At the beginning of the year an office and a commodious laboratory 
in the southwest pavilion of the Museum building were assigned to this 
department. The collections are thereby made more accessible than 
formerly. 

Department of Birds.— Mv. Eidgway, curator of birds, reports that by 
direction he prepared for exhibition at the New Orleans World’s Cotton 
Exposition a collection of North American game birds, numbering 163 
finely mounted specimens, and representing nearly aU the species. The 
exhibit was at first intended to be much more comprehensive, the original 
plan being to exhibit all the known species of North American birds, so 
far as they could be secured, together with typical groups to illustrate 
the avian fauna of the several zoo-geographical divisions of the earth’s 
surface. To this end more than 700 specimens were mounted on special 
contract, it being impossible to make up a suitable collection from the 
birds already mounted. The collection had been nearly completed on the 
original plan when it became necessary, on account of the limited space 
available, to make the great reduction which ensued. This collection 
was installed by Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, assistant curator, who for the 
purpose left Washington January 3, and returned on the 16th of the 
month. Dr. Stejneger reports that “ in regard to completeness, perfec- 
tion of mounting and preservation, scientific exactness, and popular in- 
structiveness,” this collection “ was superior to any other ornithological 
exhibit at the exposition.” The collection filled two double Museum 
cases, fitted with two rows of terraced shelves, the exhibition surface 
amounting to a little over 600 square feet. Each specimen was mounted 
on a stand of polished black walput, and provided with a printed label 
on which were printed in large, clear type both the scientific and popular 
names. The curator also calls attention to the “ American Ornitholo- 
gists’ Union,” which was formed at the urgent request of the various 
ornithological interests of the country for the main purpose of harmon- 
izing existing differences in the nomenclature of North American birds, 
and thereby removing the most serious obstacle to the study of ornithol- 
ogy. At the meeting of organization in New York City a “ committee on 
classification and nomenclature” was formed, of which the curator of the 
department of birds of the United States National Museum was made a 
member •, and this committee, in pursuance of a call from the chairman, 
held a meeting in Washington, from the 15th to the 23d of April, inclu- 
sive, in the office of this department, the collections of which were ap- 
pealed to in all cases where there was a difference of opinion among mem- 
bers of the committee, and many jjerplexing problems were settled to the 
satisfaction of the committee as a whole. The importance to ornithol- 
ogy of this meeting, together with one held the previous year in the office 
of this department, can scarcely be overstated, the whole subject of zo- 
ological nomenclature having been exhaustively reviewed and a care- 


EEPOKT OF -THE SECRETAEY. 


35 


fully prepared code adopted, in which the satisfactory rules of the exist- 
ing codes were adopted and their unwieldy provisions rejected. This 
new code has been the guide of the committee in the preparation of a 
new list of North American birds, and will, without much doubt, be 
adopted by zoologists generally. The curator having been charged by 
the above-mentioned committee with the determination of names of 
North American birds according to the new code of nomenclature, this 
duty has been carefully performed, and the copy for the new list put in 
the hands of the president of the union. At this date the list is being 
printed. The naturalists of the United States Fish Commission steamer 
Albatross having made an extensive collection of birds on the almost 
unknown island of, Cozumel, off the coast of Yucatan, it became the 
duty of the curator, as a part of his official work, to determine the spe- 
cies and describe those which proved new to science. The latter were 
no less than nineteen in number, of which the greater part have already 
been published, while the remainder are described in a full report upon 
the collection now being printed as a part of Volume VIII of the “Pro- 
ceedings of the National Museum.” The offer of the mounted birds — 
which had for some years been on exhibition in the museum of the De- 
partment of Agriculture, having been accepted by the National Museum, 
the transfer of the specimens to the Smithsonian building was effected 
duringthe month of May. This collection, numbering 712 specimens, con- 
sisted largely of common North American birds, the mounting of which 
was not up to the standard required for exhibition in the Museum col- 
lection. Being however suitable for purely educational purposes, this 
surplus stock is at present being made up into sets for distribution to 
schools or other public educational establishments which may require 
such material. The remainder of the collection, consisting of a very 
good series of the different varieties of the domesticated fowl and a 
smaller number of specimens of exotic Phasianidae, has been properly 
arranged for exhibition in the Museum cases. Mr. Eidgway reports the 
accession of 3,681 specimens of birds and 185 specimens of nests and 
eggs. 

Department of Fishes. — Dr, Tarleton H. Bean, curator of the department 
of fishes, reports 297 entries on the catalogue. The niost important collec- 
tions were made, as usual, by the vessels of the United States Fish Com- 
mission. The Albatross collections which are discussed in the Museum 
report are very large and important. The curator was aboard this 
steamer from the 3d of January to the 20th of February, during her work 
off the southern coast, and in the West Indies, Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf 
of Mexico, up to the time of her arrival at New Orleans. He was sent out 
to make observations upon the living specimens of the deep-sea fishes 
and upon the southward range of the east coast food-fishes. During the 
week spent at the island of Cozumel he had opportunity, incidentally, 
of aiding Mr, Benedict in securing a large series of the birds of thq^t 


36 


KEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 


island, while the seining for fishes along the shore yielded 57 species. 
At New Orleans a short time was spent in attaching descriptive labels 
to casts of fishes in the Exposition. 

Department of Comparative Anatomy. — This department is under the 
care of Mr. E. W. True, curator of mammals. Early in the year a number 
of exhibition cases were set up in the east south range, and in the latter 
part of February a provisional arrangement of the exhibition series of 
vertebrate skeletons was effected. A month later the entire collection of 
bird skeletons was brought from the Smithsonian building and stored in 
the range. An arrangement was made with the authorities of the Army 
Medical Museum for the exchange of a collection of human skulls for 
skeletons and skulls of North American vertebrates, and in April the 
first in stallment, consisting of about 500 skulls and 350 skeletons of 
North American vertebrates, was transferred to the United States Na- 
tional Museum. An agreement was also entered into between the Army 
Medical Museum and the National Museum to undertake post-mortem 
examination of animals in the flesh received by the Institution, and of 
which the donors desired to know the cause of death. A series of casts 
of bones of Dinoceras, presented by Prof. O. C. Marsh, was also placed 
on exhibition. The osteological preparator and his assistant were con- 
stantly engaged in cleaning skeletons and mounting them for exhibi- 
tion. One of the most interesting of the recently exhibited skeletons is 
that of jRhytina gigas, obtained in Bering Island by Dr. L. Stejneger for 
the Institution. Some progress has been made in the preparation of a 
series of specimens illustrative of the modifications of the limbs and 
other portions of the skeletons in the different classes of vertebrates. 
Experiments in special cases for the exhibition of this and other simi- 
lar series have proved very successful. But little Avork has been done 
in connection with the reserve series except for the pur];)ose of deter- 
mining whether the specimens were in good order. 

Department of Molluslcs . — This department has been making extra- 
ordinary progress under the charge of Mr. William H. Dali, assisted by 
Dr. E. E. C. Stearns. Mr. Dali reports that the department under his 
charge has been making steady advance in its administration upon the 
mass of accumulations of the last ten years, and, except in regard to the 
New Orleans exhibit, has little more to ofter than a record of such un- 
eventful work which is indispensable for making the collections useful 
for the paleontologist or the conchologist who may desire to consult it. 
The most interesting accession was a small lot of Japanese shells con- 
tributed by Mr. Uchimura, which contains several great rarities. The 
preparation of material for the New Orleans Exposition, which absorbed 
several months’ time prior to the beginning of the year, was completed 
under the direction of Dr. Stearns, so that the boxes containing the 
specimens and the cases required for their display reached their desti- 
nation and were ready for arrangement early in January. About the 
middle of the month Dr. Stearns proceeded to New Orleans and j’e-

mained there until the installation of this exhibit was completed. The 
exhibit in this division of natural history probably surpassed, in extent 
and general excellence, any previously made at any great Exhibition. 
It was arranged in 21 table-cases, the specimens being placed in inside 
trays and labelled. The general system followed was a geographical 
one, and presented a characteristic representation of the more con- 
spicuous and interesting forms of the various zoological geographical 
provinces. The exhibit included several cases of the fresh- water mus- 
sels of the Mississippi drainage area, which is remarkable for the great 
number and beauty of the shells; also the rare and peculiar forms be- 
longing to this group from other parts of the world. The land and pond 
snails of the Mississippi basin were each represented by a separate case. 
The marine shells of the Atlantic coast of America from the Arctic Sea 
to the Caribbean, and the sea-shells of the Pacific coast from Bering Sea 
to Panama, were also shown, including the principal species inhabiting 
the tidal areas of Puget Sound to the north and the Gulf of California 
to the south. Other cases contained selected specimens from the Indo- 
Pacific region, such as live in the warm waters of the great coral areas 
of the tropical and semi-tropical seas between the shores of Western 
America and Eastern Asia. Four cases were devoted to the edible 
moUusca of the United States. Two of these contained clams, cockles, 
&c., of the Atlantic seaboard, and two cases were devoted to similar 
forms peculiar to the coast of Western North America from Alaska to 
San Diego, Cal. The systematic and critical selection of the foregoing 
involved a great deal of work and the overhauling of a large quantity 
of material, the accumulation of many years. This labor was however 
incidentally advantageous to the Museum, as a considerable portion of 
the work consisted in the examination and partial preparation of mol- 
luscan material, hereafter to be incorporated in the national collection, 
and of very great importance for reference in connection with the study 
of fossil forms of the Quaternary or even of the Tertiary age. Unlike 
the results to some other departments of the Museum, the Exposition 
contributed little or nothing to this section, and indeed the Museum 
was the only contributor of an important molluscan exhibit. 

Department of Insects. — Prof. C. V. Riley continues to perform the 
duties of curator without assistance ; but arrangements have been made 
for the appointment of a paid assistant curator for the next fiscal year. 
Professor Riley reports a number of important accessions, including a 
large collection of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera sent from Sikkim by the 
Rev. C. H. A. Dali, of Calcutta. A varied collection of insects was se- 
cured by the United States Fish Commission steamer Albatross from 
the West Indian region, and an important general collection of alco- 
holic material was received from Dr. R. W. Shufeldt, U. S. A., stationed 
at F ort W in gate, N ew Mexico. Th e most valuable addition to the collec 
tion during these six months, from a classificatory standpoint, however, 
was the dipterological collection of Mr. Edward Burgess, treasurer of the 


38 


REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 


Boston Society of Natural History, which was obtained by purchase; 
while the most valuable, from a popular and economic view, is the ex- 
hibit collection jirepared for the New Orleans Exposition. This has 
been returned with little injury, and is only awaiting space for perma- 
nent exhibition in the Museum. It is made up of the following material, 
arranged in cases made on the same unit plan as those of the Museum : 

(1) Insects injurious to Agriculture. — Arranged according to the partic- 
ular plant and the particular part of the plant affected, and containing, as 
far as possible, the different states of growth of the insect, its enemies 
and parasites, d statement of the remedies or preventives available, and 
a reference to the chief articles where full information can be found upon 
it. These references are principally to Government and State reports, 
to which the farmer will most likely have access. 

(2) Insecticide Substances. — In the catalogue of this collection the aim 
has been to add, as briefly as possible, a statement of the method of 
using such substances, so that whenever in the first section a particular 
substance is recommended for a particular insect, the reader can turn 
to this second section for further details. 

(3) Insecticide Machinery and Contrivances for Destroying Insects. — In 
the catalogue of this section there is also added such information as 
will add to the instructive value of the exhibit, and a large proportion 
of the more useful contrivances are such as have been designed and 
perfected in the work of the entomological division, or of the United 
States Entomological Commission during the past five years. 

(4) Bee-culture. — This collection is designed to show all the more val- 
uable methods and contrivances now in use among the advanced apia- 
rians. 

(5) Silk-culture. — In this collection the aim has been to make the exhibit 
instructive rather than full in detail. The collection includes, in addi- 
tion to the foregoing, a number of framed plates, both colored and plain, 
which have been prepared in the work of the division ; and a number of 
Prof. Eiley’s enlarged colored diagrams of some of the more important 
injurious insects were also used. A catalogue of this exhibit has been 
published under the direction of the Department of Agriculture, giving 
a fuU and detailed statement of its contents. 

The routine work of the department has consisted in answering let- 
ters and in acknowledging and determining accessions. A good deal 
of work has also been done in the proper arrangement and classifying 
of material, particularly in theMicro Lepidopteraand in the Lepidoptera 
generally. In this work Professor Eiley was assisted by Mr. Albert 
Koebele, who was detailed from the Department of Agriculture for the 
purpose. 

The researches in entomology have been made chiefly in connection 
with Prof. Eiley’s work for the Department of Agriculture; and some 
of the results have been published in the bulletins and publications of 
said Department. 


REPOET OF ^HE SECRETARY.

Department of Marine Invertebrates. — Mr. Eichard Eathbun, curator, 
reports that the most important addition to this department was made 
by the United States Fish Commission steamer Albatross in April, on 
her return from a three months’ cruise in the Gulf of Mexico, mainly 
spent in investigating the grouper and red-snapper fishing grounds off 
our southern coast. The collection turned over to the Museum was 
much larger and contained many more novelties than that made by 
the Albatross in the same region and the Caribbean Sea the previous 
year, and the unassorted materials filled nearly 1,000 packages of all 
sizes. Of most interest was a series of several hundred specimens of 
sea-lilies, mostly collected off Havana, Cuba, and representing the 
various stages of growth of two species of Pentacrinus and of one of 
Rhizocrinus. Over 30 species of Echini, or sea-urchins, were also con- 
tained in the collection, and other divisions of the Echinodermata, as 
well as the Ccelenterata, Crustacea, and Mollusca, were very fully rep- 
resented. The bathymetrical range covered by these explorations ex- 
tended from the shore level to a depth of 1,467 fathoms. Prof. A. 
E. Verrill, of New Haven, has transferred to the Museum over 1,000 
packages of identified specimens resulting from the explorations of 
the Fish Commission in former years. Mr. Henry Hemphill continued 
his collecting on the Florida coast, begun the previous winter, until 
jVlarch of this year, and has contributed several cases of specimens 
l)elonging to many groups. The other principal accessions have been 
a fine series of the sea-urchins and star-fishes of the west coast of 
Mexico from Mr. A. Forrer, numerous specimens of Pacific corals and 
echinoderms from Dr. E. E. C. Stearns, and the collection of marine 
invertebrates made by Lieut. George M. Stoney, U. S. N., in Alaska, 
in 1884. Much progress has been made in the determination and cat- 
aloguing of specimens. Prof. Walter Faxon has completed his studies 
of the collection of cray-fishes, which is now the second in the United 
States in size and number of species, being exceeded only by that 
at the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge. It contains 46 
North American species. The collection of echini, which holds the 
same relative rank, has also been almost completely identified, and other 
groups are being rapidly worked over. In June the west hall of the 
Smithsonian building, devoted to the exhibition of marine invertebrates, 
was opened to the public, and although the collections now displayed 
fill only the wall cases surrounding the room, they present a very credit- 
able appearance, and all the groups belonging to this department are 
represented to a greater or less extent. The dried collections not on 
display have been mostly transferred to the northwest gallery of the 
main hall, which will also serve as a general work-room for the depart- 
ment. Soon after the middle of June the curator and his assistants 
left for Wood’s Holl, Mass., to take part in the summer explorations of 
the United States Fish Commission.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 


Department of Invertehraie Fossils {Paleozoic).— Mr. Charles D. Wal- 
cott, honorary curator of this department, reports that his principal 
work has consisted in identifying and labelling a collection of Carbon- 
iferous fossils which were in the old Smithsonian collection. This work 
is now well advanced, and will soon be completed as far as identifying 
the species from the old records can be done. In the laboratory the 
time of the curator has been chiefly devoted to the preparation and 
study of the Cambrian faunas of North America. This has been done 
in connection with his work for the Geological Survey. A large num- 
ber of types and a great quantity of specimens of described species 
will be added to the Museum collections as a result of this work. A 
number of minor accessions have been received from various persons 
throughout the country. A large addition was made to the collection 
in the latter part of 1884, a full discussion of which was presented in 
the report for that year, and another valuable contribution from the 
Geological Survey will probably be made in the latter part of the pres- 
ent year. 

Department of Invertebrate Fossils {Meso-cenozoie). — Dr. Charles A. 
White, the honorary curator of this department, states that a number 
of important accessions have been received during the first six months 
of this year, and that some of them constitute new additions to the col- 
lection. Descriptions of these have been published in the various bul- 
letins of the United States Geological Survey. The work of preparing 
the collections of the Museum has been in progress, and the installation 
of types has been commenced. Since the beginning of the year con- 
siderable space has been assigned to this department in the gallery of 
the Smithsonian Institution, and the work of preparing materials for 
exhibition has steadily progressed. The space in the southeast court 
of the Museum building is occupied by specimens belonging to this de- 
partment which have been turned over by the Geological Survey to 
the Museum, and in this court the collections are prepared for instal- 
lation. 

Departments of Fossil and Recent Plants . — Prof. Lester F. Ward, cura- 
tor, reports that the work of his department was exclusively confined 
to fossil plants until near the close of the year 1884, and no collections 
of recent plants were received until February last, when rooms were 
assigned to him for the purpose, and the large Joad collection from 
Kew was placed in his charge. With this Professor Ward joined his 
own collection, consisting of nearly 5,000 species. The two collections 
combined form a nucleus of not less than 14,000 species, including 
twice as many herbarium specimens for a future herbarium. He sub- 
mits the following suggestion: 

“All botanical collections have for many years been turned over to 
the Department of Agriculture, to be cared for by the botanist of that 
Department. When in 1881 I was requested to take charge of the 
fossil plants of the National Museum, and consented to do so, I per- 


REPORT OF -THE SECRETARY.

ceived at once the great inconvenience which this arrangement would 
cause to the department of fossil plants. The collections of fossil plants 
were largely undetermined, and required to be studied and identified. 
Most of them were from recent formations, and represented types of veg- 
etation still living, requiring constant comparison with the recent forms 
to be seen in herbaria. Even the installation and care of those that were 
named necessitated such comparison, and the difficulties of this nature 
that were encountered were very great. It was rarely possible to carry 
the fossils to the Department of Agriculture, and as it was usually 
necessary to search through large families of plants, the temporary 
transportation of the botanical specimens was still more impracticable. 
I therefore early began to urge the establishment at the Museum of a 
permanent collection of the plants still growing in America and other 
countries where the analogues of fossil plants were likely to occur. 
While I am highly gratified at the progress in this direction already 
made, as reported above, it must however be evident that only a begin- 
ning has thus far been made, and that the present collection of living 
plants is still very inadequate. The Joad collection represents chiefly 
the flora of Southern Europe, which is widely different from all Tertiary 
floras, and especially so from the Cretaceous and Tertiary floras of North 
America. The collections that I have made are exclusively American, 
and, so far as they go, are valuable aids to the study of American fossil 
plants, but they are, of course, too limited in extent to be trusted in 
critical cases. The parts of the world next after those in North Ameri- 
ca with which our fossil floras most closely agree, are Eastern Asia, the 
East Indies, Australia, and South Africa, and from all these vast re- 
gions scarcely any representatives are to be found in the present her- 
barium of the National Museum. It is therefore highly desirable, as a 
necessary adjunct to the department of fossil plants, and aside from 
the still greater desideratum of establishing a truly national herbarium 
at the Museum, that all reasonable efforts be made to enlarge and en- 
rich the botanical collections.” 

The technical botanical work of the department has been intrusted to 
Mr. Frank H. Knowlton, who in addition to identifying and installing 
the material, has devoted much time to bibliographical research, aud to 
the development of the sectional library. Yery large collections have 
been made by Mr. A. L. Schott during the spring and summer months 
from the parks and gardens of the city. These collections are designed 
primarily to aid in the preparation of a catalogue of the ornamental plants 
of Washington, but while serving this purpose, they are at the same time 
valuable accessions to the herbarium and highly useful in connection 
with the study of fossil plants. In collecting and preserving these speci- 
mens Mr. Schott has shown great industry and skill. In addition to 
this work Mr. Schott has undertaken the preparation of a check-list of 
genera from the “Genera PI antarum” of Bcntham and Hooker, of which 
about half the manuscript was completed at the end of June. The time 
of the curator was almost exclusively spent in the study and determina- 
tion of fossil plants collected by himself, and over one hundred species, 
many of which are new, were identified and will be duly iucori)orated 
in the Museum collections.

EEPOET OF THE SECEETAEY. 


Department of Minerals . — This department has been under the charge 
of Prof. F. W. Clarke, assisted by Mr. William S. Yeates. There have 
been made during the first half of the year 534 entries, representing 
2,137 specimens, all of which are new accessions, except 138 specimens 
which were found in the old collections without evidence of having been 
previously catalogued. Eighteen sets of minerals have been sent out 
as exchanges, comprising about 1,200 specimens, and much valuable 
material has been obtained in return. This department was represented 
at New Orleans by collections of the minerals from which are obtained 
gems and ornamental stones, and also by a collection of cut and polished 
stones. These collections attracted the general attention of connois- 
seurs and visitors at the Exposition. The minerals were classified after 
Dana’s system, and were arranged in seven flat-top table-cases. The 
gems were displayed in two cases, the specimens being mounted on 
white and black velvet pads. This de])artment did not secure a large 
amount of new material from the New Orleans Exx)osition, most of the 
mineral collections on exhibition belonging to private individuals, to 
whom the agents were responsible for the safe return of their specimens* 
One-half of the southwest court has been assigned to this department 
as its exhibition space, and the collections have been removed thither. 

Department of Lithology and Physical Geology . — The curator, Mr. 
George P. Merrill, was on duty at the New Orleans Exposition at the 
beginning of the year, but has nevertheless accomplished very satis- 
factory results in the work of reinstalling the collections upon the ex- 
tended floor-space recently assigned to this department. The opening 
of the year found the affairs of this department in a quiescent though 
somewhat confused state, owing to the fact that since the preceding 
July the entire energies of the working force had been devoted to the 
preparation of the exhibit designed for the New Orleans Exposition, 
and the regular work of the Museum had consequently fallen behind. 
The special exhibit was completed late in December and the extra 
hands discharged. This exhibit consisted of (1) a collection of 358 
specimens of building and ornamental stones of the IJnited States in 
the form of four -inch cubes; (2) a collection of some 12 specimens of 
foreign and native marbles in the form of polished slabs; (3) a collec- 
tion of 150 specimens of rock-forming minerals; (4) a collection called 
a “structural series,” intended to represent all the common forms of 
rock structure and texture; (5) a collection of 198 specimens of rock 
illustrating the geology and lithology of the Comstock lode and Wa- 
shoe district, Nevada ; and (6) a lithological collection comprising 500 
specimens of various rocks; this last together with numbers 3 and 4 
forming a part of the regular educational series of the Museum. As 
these collections were all fully described in the report of this depart- 
ment for 1884, no further reference to them in this iJlace is necessary. 
The large quantity of building-stone and other material occupying 
the space, in the southwest court, was removed and stored temporarily

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

in a shed outside the eastern entrance to the Museum, the court being 
thus available for exhibition purposes. By a reassignment of exhibi- 
tion space, the exhibition area of this department was made to include 
the whole of the west-south range, instead of a portion of this range 
and a portion of the court, as heretofore. The new arrangement is 
vastly preferable both on account of the better light thus obtained and 
of greater convenience in arranging and classifying the exhibit. In May 
the force of the department was again increased by the addition of one 
aid, one clerk, and three stone-cutters, and the preparation of a collec- 
tion of building-stones commenced for the American Museum of IsTatural 
History in New York. This collection will, when complete, comprise not 
less than one thousand specimens, and an equal number of thin sections 
for microscopical study. This work was still in progress at the end of 
June. The number of entries in the department catalogue during the 
six months has been 486, comprising some 700 specimens. These will 
be fully described in the Museum report for the first half of 1885. Con- 
siderable time has been devoted to the preparation of the various ex- 
hibition series, particularly those included under lithology, and histori- 
cal, dynamical, and structural geology. The last three are as yet far 
frOm completion, and at the ijresent rate of progress, which is neces- 
sarily very limited, must so continue for several years. On this point 
Mr. Merrill comments as follows: 

“I may, perhaps, be pardoned for mentioning here the fact that from 
past experience, 1 am convinced that the only satisfactory way in which 
these last-named branches of my department can be built up, is to 
allow the curator, or some experienced pei'son, a certain sum of money 
to be expended either in the ])urchase of collections under his direct 
suiiervision, or of especially desirable material. A very considerable 
portion of the material now necessary for this purpose is of such a 
nature — principally on account of the bulk and weight of the speci- 
mens — as to be beyond the scope of the ordinary collector, and in too 
little demand to be found in many of the natural-history stores. 1 
might mention such examples as fault structure, examples of folds, 
contortion, false bedding, &c., which can scarcely be obtained by other 
than the means suggested.” 

Department of Metallurgy and Economic Geology . — At the opening of 
the year the curator, Mr. F. P. Dewey, was still detained at New Or- 
leans, arranging the collection which had been sent from his depart- 
ment to the Exposition, and he did not return to Washington till the 
middle of January. The design of the special exhibit of this department 
was to show, as far as the time and means at his disposal would per- 
mit, the prominent occurrences of each metal, the methods of extract 
ing the metals from their ores, and the utilization of the metals. To 
these were added a few illustrations of non-metallic ores and their 
utilization, including a very extensive and valuable illustration of the 
coal industry. Most of the ore material was selected from the Museum 
collection, and only a very few new collections were made. These lat- 
ter were taken upon a systematic plan representing the mine as a unit 


44 


REPOET OF THE SECRETARY. 


rather than to gather a few specimens selected at random, as is usually 
done. In following the plan, specimens were taken to represent sections 
across and up and down the vein, and to show an average of the product 
of the vein, while to these were added the walls and other interesting 
material. In representing the extraction and utilization of the metals, 
the plan adopted was to begin with the ore as it leaves the mine, and to 
follow it through the various steps in all the operations to the production 
of the finished article, showing, when iiossible, every material entering into 
each operation, as well as every product of each operation. In the case of 
coal, the collections were based largely on the ethnological aspects of the 
question, and thus included many specimens aside from those of an eco- 
nomic or geological value. Throughout the new collections of the depart- 
ment special attention has been paid to gathering as full and complete a de- 
scription of everything shown as possible, while the pictorial side of the 
question has been treated very elaborately and includes some views of the 
interior of a coal mine taken by electric light, the first views of the kind 
ever produced. These collections form a basis for a full and complete rep- 
resentation of the mineral resources of the country, and it is hoped that 
they will increase until they shall have attained their highest educa- 
tional value. They have been fully described in Museum Circular No. 
31. The regular force of the department having been reduced to a 
scientific assistant and a laborer, the work of preparing the collections 
in the Museum' has been at a comparative stand still during the first 
half of the year. The laboratory of this department has been moved to 
the second fl^oor of the southwest pavilion, and the work room on the 
floor of the Museum has been cleaned out and space prepared for ex- 
hibition purposes, so that now the entire work of preparing material for 
exhibition has been concentrated into one place. The work of investi- 
gating the New Orleans material has been carried on as far as practi- 
cable, and, with the assistance of Mr. Allen, a number of very valuable 
analyses have been made. A large number of accessions have been re- 
ceived, among which may be specially mentioned a collection from the 
Argo works, presented by Hon. N. P. Hill, a series donated by the 
Copper Queen Company, and a series of apatite from many localities, 
presented by Pickford & Winkfleld, of London, England. In the middle 
of May the curator returned to New Orleans to pack up the collection 
and to solicit contributions for increasing the value of the permanent 
collections. No attemiit was made to obtain large, entire collections 
without regard to their value to the Museum, requests being made 
for material of only two classes, i. e., that of intrinsic value, and such 
as would fill gaps in our permanent collections. This effort was so 
successful that much very valuable material was obtained and some 
of the most important gaps were filled. Among the former should 
be especially noticed the important and interesting collection received 
from Mexico, and among the latter the valuable series of iron ores from 
the Menominee region in Michigan. After the return of the curator to

Wasliing'tou in June, the collection presented to the Museum by the 
American Institute of Mining Engineers, and which has for some years 
been stored in Philadelphia, under the care of Mr. Thomas Donaldson, 
commenced to arrive and claimed his attention during the remainder of 
the fiscal year. 


BUEEATJ OF ETHNOLOGY. 

For continuing the prosecution of ethnological researches among the 
North American Indians during the year 1885, under the general super- 
vision of the Smithsonian Institution, an appropriation of $40,000 was 
m ade by Congress. The charge of this interesting work — so valuable for 
the advancement of anthropological knowledge — still remains under the 
efBcient direction of Maj. J. W. Powell. 

The explorations in this field for the collection of information and 
material, being mainly conducted during the summer months, the re- 
sults cannot be collated and discussed till late in the fall. And as the 
present report is brought down only to the 1st of July, a notice of the 
operations of this Bureau for the year 1885 must necessarily be post- 
poned until the next annual report. 

UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SUEVET. 

While this important branch of the public service is in its organiza- 
tiou entirely independent of the Smithsonian Institution, yet its inti- 
mate relations to the latter, not only in the advancement of original 
scientific research, but particularly in the valuable contributions made 
by it to the stores of the National Museum, have seemed to justify an 
annual summary of its general operations. Maj. J. W. Powell continues 
to administer in a highly satisfactory manner the responsible duties of 
his position as Director of the Survey. 

In this department also, as in that last referred to, the field work is 
still in progress at the closing of this report. And hence, for the rea- 
son assigned, no details of the work and its results can here be given. 
The character of the geological operations for the year will be concisely 
presented in the report of 1885-’86. 

THE UNITED STATES FISH COMMISSION. 

The work of the Commission has been prosecuted on about the same 
scale as during the year 1884, the usual attention being paid to the pro- 
duction of trout, salmon, whiteflsh, and other species, and to the gen- 
eral investigations into the fisheries of the country.

ful in her mission, attracting much attention at the exhibition, and 
making many important explorations. Included in these was a short 
visit to Cozumel, an island off the coast of Yucatan, where many new 
species of vertebrate animals were secured. 

The investigations made at Wood’s Holl will be detailed in the next 
report, as the work was begun after June 30, which represents the limit 
of the present report.

EEPOET ON SMITHSONIAN EXCHANGES, JANHAEY 1 TO 

JUNE 30, 1885. 

By George H. Boehmer. 

OFFICE WORK. 

On my return from an official mission to Europe as special agent for 
the international exchange of official public documents of the United 
States Government with foreign powers, to which position I had been 
appointed by v ourself, and at the lequest of Mr. Spofford, the Libra- 
rian of Congress, ou July 22, 1884, I resumed charge of the Exchange 
Office on IMarch 1, 1885. One of my first duties was the preparation of 
reports to (1) the Smithsonian Institution, as the agent of exchange of 
the United States Government, and (2) to the Library of Congress, as 
the beneficiary under the Congressional act establishing this system of 
exchange. The latter report is a manuscript of 620 pages of (42-liue) 
foolscap paper, and will in all probability be presented to Congress by 
the Librarian of Congress through the Joint Committee on the Library. 
The report to the Smithsonian Institution is a manuscript of over 500 
l»agcs foolscai>, and comprises: {a) Letter of transmittal; (b) historical 
sketch of international exchanges ; (c) journal; (d) correspondence ; (e) 
bibliographical list of official and scientific publications made by the 
Government departments and scientific and learned societies located in 
Berlin, Germany. This list is as complete as could be collected during 
the comparatively short sojourn in that city. Of this report only the 
letter of transmittal, exhibiting a r^sumd in a condensed form of the 
work performed, success attained, and certain observations made abroad, 
will be given in the present statement, under the heading “Government 
Exchange Division.” 

Special attention had been given in all the countries visited to the 
collecting of leliable information and material to aid in the correction 
of the “list of foreign corresi)ondents.” In this endeavor I met with 
the most generous assi.stance ou the i)art of all officials to whom I made 
known my wishes, and a full list of the co-operators in this enterprise 
will be ijresented in the new and revised list prepared from the mate- 
rial collected and now ready for publication. This new list comprises 
over 4,000 titles, while the last one published by the Institution had 
only 2,001. 

The regular office work has received proper attention, and the first 
six months of the present year close with a record never attained 
before.

REPORT ON EXCHANGES. 


The Record Division . — The duties of this ofBce have beeome so numer- 
ous, that au additional assistant was this year allowed. The work of 
this division now embraces all the records and card catalogues under 
the system adopted on the 1st of January, 1885. Under this system 
all exchanges, whether incoming or outgoing, foreign or domestic, after 
verifying the correctness of the sending, are entered on a blotter — this 
work being done by the assistants in the foreign and domestic exchange 
division, respectively ; these blotters are then transcribed by (he clerks 
of the record division in the day-book, from which the ledger, repre- 
sented by a card catalogue, is posted. In addition to these duties, it 
devolves on the clerks of this division to prepare the invoices for the 
outgoing exchanges, and to credit on the ledger the acknowledgments 
sent by recipients of exchanges, and to record and file letters, bills of 
lading, &c. 

The following statement exhibits the work done in this division dur- 
ing the first six months:

The Foreign Exchange Division . — Since January 1, 1885, 39,921 packages 
have been received in this division and 383 boxes sent, including the 
Government exchanges. A comparative statement of boxes sent dur- 
ing corresponding periods of former years present the following results :

The year 1884 exhibited an extraordinary increase in the transmis- 
sions, which was largely due to an arrangement for exchanges on the 
part of the United States Patent Office with foreign Governments by 
which 02 large cases were sent abroad through the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution in. June of th.at year. But notwithstanding this unusual send- 
ing, the last six months show an increase of 33 boxes over the simil.;r 
period of 1881. A detailed list will be presented in the statistics of 
exchanges. 

Owing to the large addition in the work required under the present 
system of preparing blotters, &c., and in consideration of the regular 
increase both in incoming and outgoing exchanges, two (temporary) 
assistants have been employed. ,

While now, as compared with 1884, the number of packages distrib- 
uted does not apparently present any marked increase, it must be re- 
membered that until the end of August, 1884, all books for the Smith- 
sonian Institution, whether received by mail or otherwise, were entered 
on the exchange record; but since then the books for the Smithsonian 
Institution, coming by mail, were sent direct to the Smithsonian Li- 
brary without passing through the exchanges. Thus, while the num- 
ber ofentries on the exchange records has apparently remained the same, 
an increase has in reality taken place, the extent of which is represented 
by the number of packages sent direct to the Smithsonian Library. 

VISIT TO EUROPE. 

The Government Exchange Division . — On the 22d of July, 1884, hav- 
ing been appointed as special European agent of the Library of Con- 
gress for exchanging the official publications of the United States Gov- 
ernment for like publications of foreign Governments, in accordance 
with the Congressional acts of March 2, 1867, and July 2, 1868, I ven- 
ture to here present, as a concise statement of the business accom- 
plished, a reproduction of the letter transmitting the formal report: 

“ Obediently to the instructions received, and provided with letters 
of credence (1) from yourself to the correspondents of the Institution 
abroad, (2) from Mr. Spofford, on behalf of the Library of Congress to 
the officers in charge of Government exchanges in Europe, and (3) 
from the Department of State to the officers of the diplomatic and 
consular corps of the United States in Europe, I left on my mission on 
the 24th of July, 1884, and successively visited the executive depart- 
ments of the following countries : Germany, Prussia, Saxony, Denmark, 
Norway, Sweden, Finland, Itussia, Austria, Hungary, Roumania, Ba- 
varia, Switzerland, Wurtem berg, Belgium, Holland, England, Italy, and 
France (several of them repeatedly), obtaining immediate results far 
above all expectations, and securing the promise of further valuable 
returns. In most of the countries visited even the promise of two com- 
plete sets of official publications has been secured, while the Govern- 
ment of the United States furnishes only one single copy to each of the 
exchanging states. Austria has been added to the list of exchanging 
Governments, and Germany and Prussia are also expected to be repre- 
sented in a decided majority of their resi)ective publications. 

“One of the paragraphs of instruction, specifying the kind of docu-

ments especially desired by the Librarian of Congress, mentions, among 
others — 

“ {a) Complete sets of the laws of each country. 

“(Z^) Jonruals, &c., of parliamentary bodies. 

“(c) Historical publications. 

“In compliance with this paragraph I desire to state that on the part 
of all the Governments visited the promise has been cheerfully given 
(including even that of Germany and Prussia), and a number of them 
have already redeemed their promise. Large collections have been re- 
ceived from the Governments of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Hungary, 
Saxony, Wurtemberg, Bavaria, Holland, Italy, France, and Switzer- 
land, while in furnishing collections of laws those of Wurtemberg and 
Bavaria stand pre-eminent, the collection from the former extending 
from the year 1289 to the present day. This is not a Government pub- 
lication, but a private enterprise. The comijlete work had to be pur- 
chased by the Government of Wurtemberg, and is now being presented 
to the Government of the United States in appreciation of the many 
and valuable documents presented under the Congressional act of Gov- 
ernment documents exchange, while the collection from Bavaria com- 
prises several hundred volumes. As regards historical publications the 
Government of Switzerland stands pre-eminent in her promise to sup- 
ply as complete a collection as can be obtained — a library in itself — 
of the historical works of that Bepublic, while the Governments of 
Saxony and Italy have already furnished some very valuable tvorks. 
Of other official publications a collection of 4,500 volumes of “ Proc5s- 
verbaux des conseils g6n6raux des Ddpartements Fran 9 ais,” received 
from the French Government, may be named, while the offer of the 
English Government of supplying the parliamentary papers from the 
year 1817 to the end of 1881 also deserves mention. 

“At first I met with great difficulties and vexations in carrying out the 
designated plan of operations, mainly owing to the facts that all the 
intercourse had been in a very indirect way of correspondence, and 
tha,t an agent of exchange had never visited the respective Govern- 
ments, among whom some very singular ideas prevailed as to the true 
position of the Library of Congress as regards this exchange, as well as 
to its relative position to the GoA^ernment of the United States and the 
bodies representing the Government in its various branches, and in 
consequence of which some very serious misapprehensions and miscon- 
structions as regards the purpose of this exchange had occurred. 

“Another disadvantage which soon became painfully noticeable has 
its origin in the entirely different organization and construction of the 
exchange service of the European countries as compared with our own 
system. 

“While the United States Congress makes a liberal provision for the 
printing and gratuitous distribution of all official publications, from the 
most inexpensive to the most costly production, in European countries 
fLe respective governmental bureaus aud departments relieve them-

selves of any and all annoyances and cost attending the printing and 
publishing of their various issues by giving the manuscript in com- 
mission to some enterprising and reliable publishing house. Thus the 
■work is at once thrown in the book trade and represents a commercial 
value, and copies can only be supplied through the firm holding the 
work on commission. The department may receive probably some 50 
per cent, of the proceeds of the sales, which income greatly lessens the 
cost of preparing the manuscript. The respective departments can 
obtain copies only by purchase, and no legislation existing in those 
countries like our Congressional act authorizing the exchange of official 
documents, the one bureau, having undertaken the collecting and pro- 
viding for the exchange with other Governments, has a very difficult 
task in obtaining from the other departments the works required for 
the purpose. It has no right to demand, but it is always the suppli- 
cant for a favor, since such only it can be considered. 

“Furthermore, the bureaus of exchange established (on the basis 
adopted by the Paris convention in 1875) in a number of European 
states are greatly restricted in their modus operandi by well-defined 
laws, which prescribe distinctly that the official publications obtained 
in the manner above described, and purchased from funds exclusively 
allowed for the purpose, can be exchanged only for works of the same 
(commercial) value. This, however, is a difficult matter in the case of 
the United States publications, which represent no commercial value, 
although they command very high figures in the book trade. I beg leave 
here to quote from an English catalogue the prices of some of the more 
important United States publications — the figures reduced to American 
currency :

KEPORT ON EXCHANGES. 


‘‘ Herein, and in the misconceptions above stated, we may find an 
explanation of the scant returns the Government of the United States 
has received and of the incompleteness of the series furnished; and 
though, through the kind and hearty co operation of our diplomatic and 
consular ofiScers, 1 finally succeeded in placing, for a time at least, the ex- 
changes on a sound basis, allow me to suggest that the means of securing 
for the Government of the United States full returns for the liberal i)ro- 
visions made for the exchange, and of reaping the benefit of the prom- 
ises obtained from the European Governments in the execution of my 
mission, can only be found in the establishment of a permanent agency 
in Europe, a precedent for which we find in the Congressional act of 
June 26, 1848, wherein Congress charged the Library Committee with 
the nomination of an agent to conduct the operations of the exchange 
between France and the United States, which ought to be intrusted to 
a person entirely familiar with the business and its requirements, who 
is to keep himself always informed as to the quality and quantity of 
the publications made by the European Governments, and who should 
be capable of judging and selecting from the works thus offered such 
as would compensate the Government of the United States in the fullest 
measure in an exchange, value for value, the value of the United States 
publications being accepted as they are quoted in the book trade, for 
the works sent abroad, in compliance with the Congressional acts es- 
tablishing this exchange.” 

EXTENSION OF THE SYSTEM OF EXCHANGES. 

With two Governments preliminary arrangements have been made 
for an exchange of official publications, the extent of which however 
has not yet been fully decided on. These Governments are those of the 
Eepublic of Uruguay and of the Empire of Austria. The correspondence 
relating to these arrangements is here given : 

EXCHANGE WITH URUGUAY. 

From Department of State, Washington, December ZO, 1884, to Prof. S. F. 

Baird, Smithsonian Institution. 

Dear Sir : I inclose a copy of a note from the Charge d’ Affaires ad 
interim of Uruguay here, touching the wish of his Government to form (or 
accede to) conventions with other Governments, with a view to provid- 
ing for exchanges of publications ; also the printed paper which accom- 
panies the same, and which it is desired to have returned, with your 
comments on the proposition of the Uruguayan Government. 

I am, &c., 

Fred’k T. Frelinghuysen. 


REPORT ON EXCHANGES. 53 

Inclosure from legation of Uruguay, Netc YorJc, December 14, 1884, to 
the Secretary of State, Washington. 

Sir : I have the honor to address your excellencj’ for the purpose of 
bringing to your notice, by means of the copy herewith inclosed, the 
invitation which the Government of the Republic that I represent has 
the high honor to address to you, for the purposes stated in the note. It 
extends this invitation feeling every confidence in the lofty American 
spirit and the good will of the United States Government. 

I transcribe to your excellency, in full, the note whereby I am in- 
structed to bring to the notice of your Government this invitation; it 
reads as follows : 

“ Montevideo, October 29, 1884. 

“ Mr. Charge d’affaires : 

“ I send you a printed copy of the law recently passed by the honor- 
able general assembly of the Republic providing for the establishment, 
in the national library, of a bureau which is to be called ‘ The Central 
Bureau of International Exchanges of Publications.’ 

“ In pursuance of the provisions of article 8 of the reglementary de- 
cree of that law, you will be pleased to invite the Government to which 
you are accredited, in the name of the Republic, to conclude a conven- 
tion for the exchange of publications on various subjects. Two objects 
are had in view by the Government in pursuing this course, viz, to 
draw still closer the cordial relations which exist between this Republic 
and that of the United States of America, and to encourage, by facilitat- 
ing them as far as possible, the knowledge and study of literary, scien- 
tific, and other questions among the nations of America, whose advances 
in progress and civilization must speedily place them on a footing with 
the most progressive nations of Europe. Your superior enlightenment 
renders it unnecessary for me to advance any arguments in order to show 
theimportance of the proposed convention, or the advantages which must 
accrue from it to the nations adopting it. If, as is to be hoped, the 
United States Government agrees to conclude the arrangement in ques- 
tion, it may be done on the basis of that which already exists between 
this Republic and Chili, or of that concluded by Belgium with various 
other nations, which you will find in the inclosed printed documents, if 
the United States Government does not consider that certain modifica- 
tions are necessary, which the Government of this Republic is prepared 
to consider. You will be pleased to request that Government to send 
you a rejdy in regard to this matter. 

“ Manuel Herrera y Oder.” 

In bringing the foregoing note to your knowledge, and inclosing the 
printed coi)y of the contentions to which it refers, permit me to hope 
that the cabinet of which your excellency is so distinguished a mem- 
ber will not consider the plan which I hereby have the honor to submit

as impracticable, since it will tend to render better known in our country 
the practical details of the institutions of this, together with its ad- 
vances, which so greatly stimulate our own, while the constant perusal 
of the publications of our Republic will show the eagerness with which 
American countries of Spanish extraction are seeking, in spite of well- 
known obstacles, to secure for themselves a permanent position among 
the nations of the modern world.

Article 2. The director of the library, through the intermediary of 
the office created by the preceding article, will proceed to effect the ex- 
change of official publications, and of the literary and scientific works

Department of State, Montevideo, July 24, 1884. 

DECREE. 

In conformity with the provisions of article 3 of the law of May 27, 
1884, the Executive of the Republic decrees : 

Article 1. After the office of International Exchanges of Publications 
referred to in the preceding law has been established and organized, 
the director of the national library will, with the view to the better 
service of said office, prepare regulations for the same, which he will 
in due time submit to the Government for its approval. 

Article 2. The above-mentioned functionary will on the 31st Decem- 
ber of each year present to this ministry a report showing the progress, 
the needs, and the increase of said office, which document, when pub- 
lished, shall be transmitted to all institutions which exchange publica- 
tions with the national library. 

Article 3. All the departments and their bureaus will transmit to the 
office of International Exchanges of Publications 25 copies of all the 
documents published by them. 

Article 4. The director of the national library will acquire for the 
office to which this decree relates, all such publications as will, in his 
opinion, tend to contribute to the reputation of the Republic in foreign 
parts, with the view that this office may distribute them. The provis- 
ions of this arfcle, however, shall not interfere with any donations 
which may be made to the office of exchanges. 

Article 5. All agents of the Republic in foreign 'countries will aid the 
director of the library, whenever he calls on them for such aid ; and 
if such obligation involves any expenditure, the agents shall, before 
taking any action, inform the director of the amount needed, so that he 
may either allow the expenditure or refuse it, according to the amount 
of funds at his disposal for tho purpose. 

Article 6. Any conventions which may be concluded in the future 
shall be formulated according to the test of the convention concluded 
between the charg6 d’ affaires of Uruguay in Ghili and the Govern- 
ment of Chili on the 6th June, 1873, and whenever this is impossi- 
ble, according to the project of a convention prepared at Brussels on 
the 26th August, 1880.* 

Article 7. In view of the fact that any delay in the conclusion of con- 
ventions may prove j) rejudicial to the Republic and the national li- 
brary, the director of that institution will propose to the Department 
of State the establishment of an exchange of publications with all those 
nations with whom, in his opinion, such an exchange should be estab- 
lished, determining at the same 4ime what publications should be 
exchanged. And if the Department of State approves of the propo-

sition, it will transmit it to tlie Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which im 
mediately, and without any legislation on the subject, will proceed to 
arrange the necessary convention, reporting its action to the Depart- 
ment of State. 

Article 8. There shall be forwarded to all the Governments of Amer- 
ica, through the intermediary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a circular 
giving the provisions of the law in question and of this decree, in\iting 
them at the same time to enjoy the benefits which will result from such 
an exchange for all nations which accept it. 

Article 9. The above shall be published and inserted in the code of 
laws.

Exchange of publications between Uruguay and Chili. 

Met at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the sixth day of June, one 
thousand eight hundred and seventy-three, Don JoseC. Arrieta, charge 
d’affaires of the Eepublic of Uruguay, and Don Adolfo Ibanez, minister 
of foreign affairs of Chili, for the purpose of concluding a convention 
for the regular and permanent exchange between the two Eepublics of 
the literary and scientific productions of their citizens, which will 
strengthen the bonds of sympathy which unite the two countries, and 
agreed upon the following articles: 

Article 1. The Government of Uruguay and of Chili will send to each 
other, as soon as possible, two copies of all the publications which they 
have had printed in accordance with the provisions of the law in their 
respective territories, excepting productions of purely private interest 
or whose contents do not entitle them to be considered as scientific or 
literary publications. 

Article 2. The same obligation will be in force even if the publica- 
tions in question have not been published in either of the two countries, 
but have been published at the expense of either of the two Govern- 
ments, or by their aid or subvention. 

Article 3. As soon as one of the two Governments has received the 
publications sent by the other, it will acknowledge their receipt in the 
official journal, giving the place where they have been published and 
the place whence they were sent, with the view to bring them to the 
notice of those who desire to obtain them. 

Article 4. The provisions of the above three articles will apply to geo- 
graphical maps and other works of that character. 

Article 5. Each Government will also procure and send to the other 
two copies of works published by 'citizens of their respective countries 
residing abroad; but this obligation will cease as regards the Govern- 
ment of Uruguay if a citizen of Uruguay i)ublishes a work in Chili, and 
as regards the Govefument of Chili if a Chilian citizen publishes a 
work in Uruguay.

57 


Article 6. Eacli of the two Governments will form a collection as com- 
plete as possible of all the works published within its territory, or out- 
side of it, if the provisions of article 2 apply to them ; and will trans- 
mit this collection to the other at as early a date as possible. This col- 
lection should especially comprise works treating of the history, geog- 
raphy, industries, statistics, and legislation of the country. 

Article 7. Publications shall be transmitted in the month of January 
of every year; in Uruguay through the intermediary of the Chilian 
legation, and in Chili through the intermediary of the Uruguayan le- 
gation, or direct between the two Governments whenever there are no 
legations. 

Article 8. The present convention will go into effect this day, and 
will continue in force, until either of the two Governments shall desire 
its discontinuance, and shall so advise the other. 

At the close of this conference the charge d’affaires of Uruguay and 
•the Chilian minister of foreign relations have signed this document in 
duplicate copy, and affixed thereto their respective seals.

From the' Smithsonian Institution, January 31, 1885, to Hon. F. T. Fre- 
linghuysen, Secretary of State. 

Sir: In acknowledging the receipt of your letter of the 30th of 
December last, inclosing a copy of a note from the Charg6 d’affaires 
of Uruguay in reference to an exchange of publications between that 
Government and the Government of the United States, I beg to say 
that an answer was necessarily deferred until a translation could be 
made of the Spanish document accompanying your communication, the 
original of which is herewith returned. 

It is not my jirovince to offer suggestions to the Government of Uru- 
guay regarding a general system of exchanges with the various Gov- 
ernments of the world ; but so far as the United States is concerned, I 
can say that it will give the Smithsonian Institution much pleasure to 
make the necessary arrangements for an interchange of official publica- 
tions of the two countries, the Institution sending to Uruguay at least 
once a year, and perhaps twice, all the publications of the Government 
of the United States, whether printed by order of Congress or any of 
the Departments — these, of course, in return for an equally exhaustive 
and comprehensive transmission on the part of the Government of Uru- 
guay, all the returns received to be placed in the Library of Congress. 

The Smithsonian Institution cannot undertake to secure publications 
generally of the scientific and literary establishments of the United 
States, but it will be happy to do all in its power in this respect. It 
is, however, willing to send its own works — the Smithsonian Contribu- 
tions to Knowledge, the Miscellaneous Collections, and the Annual 


58 


REPORT ON EXCHANGES. 


Eeports, which embody a large percentage of American scientific litera- 
ture. 

In return for this special and separate sending it would expect for 
its own library copies of any works on scientific subjects published by 
the Government of Uruguay. 

In reference to the best, or most convenient, method of conducting 
an exchange of publications between the two countries in question, I 
beg to say that where distant communication by sea is involved, as is 
the case in the present instance, we find it most convenient to deliver 
all packages, free of freight, to the consul in Uew York of the country 
addressed, and to have the returns transmitted free of cost to the 
American consul at the port of shipment. 

This course is pursued for the reason that any question of ocean ex- 
penses can be more readily settled on delivery of the packages. Al- 
though differing somewhat from that agreed upon at Brussels, this ar- 
rangement has been acceded to by all the European correspondents of 
the Smithsonian Institution. Of course it would not be impossible to 
make deliveries at Montevideo, if that be the proper port of entry, but 
there would necessarily be petty charges that even in that case it would 
be difficult to arrange for. 

I inclose for the information of the charge d’affaires of Uruguay 
some of the publications of the Smithsonian Institution bearing upon 
the subject of exchanges, and which possibly may contain some in- 
formation that will interest him. 

A first transmission can be made by our sending as complete a series 
of the documents of the United States Government as can now be sup- 
plied. This will consist of publications for a number of years, and will 
include several hundred volumes, occupying 13 cases. And we shall 
be pleased to receive information as to the exact address for the con- 
signment, both in this country and Uruguay. 

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant, 

Spencer F. Baird. 


EXCHANGES WITH AUSTRIA. 

From the Department of State, Washington, D. C., February 11, 1885, to 
Prof. Spencer F. Baird, Secretary Smithsonian Institution. 

Sir : As suggested by dispatch No. 50 of the 21st ultimo, from Vienna, 
I inclose a copy of the same and of the list of official works of the 
Austro-Hungarian Government for exchange, to which it refers; and 1 
also inclose, for the better understanding of dispatch No. 50, copies of 
two previous dispatches on the exchange of Government publications 
with Austria-Hungary. 

I am, &c.,

Sir : I have the honor to report that Mr. George H. Boehmer, chief 
of Exchange Bureau for the Smithsonian Institution and the Congres- 
sional Library, having special reference to Government publications, 
recently visited Vienna with a view of securing such exchange between 
Austria-Hungary, and the Bureau above named, of which he is chief. 

In conformity with your general instruction to diplomatic agents of 
the United States abroad, of which Mr. Boehmer was the bearer, I as- 
sisted him in procuring interviews with representatives of the Austro- 
Hungarian Government, who are authorized to treat upon the object of 
his mission, for this purpose securing audience on the 9th instant with 
Count Szogy^nyi, chief of section of Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on 
which occasion the subject-matter was fully discussed, and the methods 
to be adopted in the proposed exchange freely canvassed. 

Count Szdgyenyi expressed much interest in the matter, and appointed 
a meeting for the next day with Mr. Boehmer, to give it further con- 
sideration. Mr. Boehmer was subsequently placed in communication 
with other departments of the Government to arrange details, and the 
result as reported to me by him was in every respect satisfactory. The 
publications will now be sent forward regularly from each capital, the 
one to the other, in the exchange of Government publications. 

The details of the agreement entered into will be reported by Mr. 
Boehmer to the Congressional Librarian.

I also inclose translation of a communication from Count Szogydnyi, 
dated October 20, in reply to my note as above, showing the progress 
thus far made in the n»atter.

From Hon, John M. Francis, ambassarlor, United States legation, Vienna, 
October 9, 1884, to his excellency the Count Szogyeny i, chief of section 
of Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 

Your Excellency : I haxe the honor to inclose herewith a copy of a 
communication this clay received by me from Mr. George H. Boehmer, 
delegate of the Library of Congress of the United States, treating of 
the subject of a proposed exchange of official documents between the 
Government of the United States and Austria-Hungary. 

I beg leave to inform your excellency that I have received instruc- 
tions from my Government to aid as far as may be convenient in draw- 
ing the attention of His Imperial Majesty’s Government to the subject 
matter referred to, with the hope that the exchange of Government 
publications as proposed may be favorably regarded by His Majesty’s 
Government to the end that the desired object be assured. 

I avail myself of this occasion to renew to your excellency the as- 
surance of my distinguished consideration. 

From George H. Boehmer, Vienna, Austria, October 9, 1884, to his ex- 
cellency Mr. John M. Francis, envoy extraordinary and minister pleni- 
potentiary of the United States of America, Vienna. 

Sir : In the year 1867, the Congress of the United States passed a 
law authorizing the exchange, under the direction of the Smithsonian 
Institution, of a certain number of all the United States official docu- 
ments for the corresponding publications of other Governments through- 
out the world, the returns to be placed in the National (Copgressional) 
Library. 

The object of this law was to procure for the use of the Congress of 
the United States a complete series of the publications of other Gov- 
ernments. 

A circular letter was therefore issued by the Smithsonian Institution, 
asking the advice of the various Governments as to the best method of 
accomplishing the object. 

It was important to ascertain what Governments were willing to 
enter into the proposed exchange, and whether any one person or branch 
of the Government or public library in each country would undertake 
to collect all the national publications and transmit them to Washing- 
ton. Information was also desired as to the titles and character of the 
regular official publications of each country, and their average number 
and extent in each year, as well as the names of the different sources 
from which they emanate. 

On the 30th of October, 1875, a circular was sent by Professor Henry, 
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, with a letter to the foreign 
ministers at Washington,* and among them to the ambassador of His 
Majesty the Emperor of Austria. 

* [This circular and letter were published iu the Smithsonian Report for 1881, pp. 
768, 769.] 


REPORT ON EXCHANGES. 


61 


In accordance with instructions received in respect to the letter re- 
ferred to, the first two boxes of documents were sent to Vienna, and are 
now dei^osited in the Imperial Eoyal Library., Subsequent transmis- 
sions, however, were refused by the imperial legation at Washington 
as being too bulky. 

It is now desired by the Congress of the United States of America 
to resume relations of exchanges with the Empire of Austria, this 
being the only Government required to complete the exchange serv- 
ice with the United States of all the European monarchies, and in this 
connection I beg to remark that the Smithsonian Institution, as the 
authorized agent of the Government, has now ready for transmission, 
(in addition to the boxes of documents already received into the Impe- 
rial Eoyal Library), eighteen (18) boxes, each of about six cubic feet, 
containing several thousand volumes, and to which about two boxes 
will be added each year. This entire accumulation would, upon ac- 
ceptance of the terms and conditions of the exchange on the part of 
His Imperial Majesty’s Government, be delivered at once and free of 
cost to any agent the Imperial Government might be pleased to appoint 
at any seaport of the United States, while the returns on the part of 
His Imperial Majesty’s Government should be placed, free of cost, in 
the hands of Dr. Felix Fltigel, 49 Sidonien Strasse, Leipsic, the agent 
of the Smithsonian Institution for Europe. The boxes or parcels thus 
sent should be marked, “ To the Smithsonian Institution, for the Library 
of Congress,” and both these establishments be informed of the sending 
by letter, together with a list of the documents sent. 

In obedience to instructions I have the honor to submit this proposal 
of exchange to you, and to request your excellency to lay the same 
before the proper authorities of His Imperial Majesty’s Government 
and to kindly advise me of anj- action taken or any results derived 
from this application. 

From his excellency the Count Szogyenyi, chief of section of Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs^ to Hon. John M. Francis, ambassador, Vienna, Octo- 
ber 20, 1884. 

Sib : In conformity with the desire expressed in the esteemed note 
of the 9th instant, E. O. No. 8, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has made 
known to the respective imperial and royal central stations the mis- 
sion of Mr. Boehmer, chief of Congressional Bureau of the United 
States for International Exchange, who proposed making an agreement 
whereby a regular exchange of official publications may be established 
between the Governments of Austria-Hungary and the United States. 

The Imperial Eoyal Ministry of the Interior has already expressed its 
approval of such an agreement as far as its department is concerned, 
and observes in this connection that it deems it most advisable to con- 
fine itself to the regular communication of the reports of the sessions of 
the Austrian Parliament and of the official paper known as the Legal

Advertiser (Eeichs Gesetzblatt), which publishes all the general laws 
enacted, believing that reports of the sessions of the several ijrovincial 
diets and the different provincial laws and regulations would be of but 
a secondary interest to the United States Government. 

The undersigned will not fail to communicate to the Hon. J. M. Fran- 
cis, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United 
States of America, all further information bearing upon this question, 
and avails himself of this opportunity to tender a renewed assurance of 
his high esteem. 

From Hon. John M. Francis^ ambassador ^ United States legation, Vienna, 
January 21, 1885, to Hon. Frederick T. Frelinghuysen, Secretary of 
State, Washington, D. C. 

Sir: I have the honor to inclose herewith translation of a note from 
Baron Pasetti, chief of section Ministry of Foreign Afiairs, dated Janu- 
ary 16, 1885, in regard to the exchange of Government publications be- 
tween the Government of the United States and that of Austria, as fully 
set forth in my No. 20 of October 24, 1884. 

Baron Pasetti’s note, with accompanying inclosure of a list of official 
works from the imperial royal department of public instruction, ex- 
plains or suggests the basis of the proposed international exchange, 
which has the approval of Mr. Boehmer, agent for the Congressional 
Library and Smithsonian Institution, who recently conferred with the 
proper Government officials here on this subject. 

Mr. Boehmer now requests that a copy of the inclosed communication 
from Baron Pasetti and the accomiianying list of official works referred 
to be transmitted by the department to the directors of the Smithsonian 
Institution. 

From Baron Pasetti, minister of foreign affairs, Vienria, January 16, 
1885, to Hon. John M. Francis envoy extraordinary and minister pleni- 
potentiary of the United States. 

Sir : On the 20th of October last, under Nos. the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs had the honor of informing Hon. John M. Francis, en- 
voy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United States 
of America, that the Imperial Eoyal Ministry of the Interior had con- 
sented to an establishment of a regular excaange of official publica- 
tions with the United States Government. 

In the mean time a note has been received by the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs from the Imperial Eoyal Ministry of Instruction, wherein the 
latter makes known its views on the above question. 

The last named ministry says that the exchange of official publica- 
tions and of periodicals published by scientific institutes in Austria has 
Ijeen uniformly pursued for some time. Jsumerous copies are forwarded

annually in every direction, andtlie volumes sent in return by institutes 
abroad are promptly and regularly received. This direct mode of ex- 
change between the respective corporations, institutes, &c., facilitates 
not only the requirements in the most speedy and simple manner, but 
tends also to reduce the expenses of transmission to the lowest possible 
rate. The Imperial Eoyal Ministryof Instruction would nevertheless be 
ready to accept the proposal made by the American Government as far 
as its department is concerned on condition that the exchange be not 
extended to all publications made, but be confined to such as would 
upon investigation be found to be the most acceptable and needed by 
both parties, and that the number of copies to be sent would also be 
made dependent upon this rule. With this view the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs begs to inclose herewith to the North American envoy a list 
compiled by the Ministry of Instruction, giving the publications periodi- 
cally appearing under its direction, and requests that it be transmitted, 
and that the number and the titles of the copies desired on the part of 
America be pointed out. 

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs addresses itself at the same time to 
the other departments interested in the exchange in question, request- 
ing them to make known their views on the subject, and to send in simi- 
lar lists of periodicals published under their direction. 

As far as the publications are concerned which have been offered by 
America, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will first inform the different 
'departments of the receipt of the work published by Mr. Boehmer, en- 
titled “ History of the Smithsonian Exchanges,” of which the author 
had the kindness of placing several copies at the disposal of the Imperial 
Eoyal Government, in connection with which it must be observed that 
the list of official American publications the work contains only reaches 
as far back as the year 1881 , which will probably make a supplement 
necessary. 

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs begs to observe here that the Ministry 
of Instruction regards it as a matter of course that this proposed new 
arrangement will in no way affect or alter the exchange of publications 
kept up for a number of years heretofore with the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion. / , 

Finally, the ministry wishes to say that in case an agreement is made 
the publications intended for Austria be forwarded by the American 
Government to Vienna, carriage paid, and that the Austrian consign- 
ments be sent, carriage paid, to be delivered either at Leipsic or at 
Washington, according to the desire of the American Government. 

While the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has the honor of conveying 
this intelligence to the knowledge of the honorable North American 
envoy, the undersigned embraces the opportunity to renew the assur- 
ance of his profound consideration.

LIST OF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS. 


By GtBOKGE H. Bobhmee. 


One of the instructions furnished on occasion of an official visit 
to Europe, in July, 1884, on business connected with the exchange

ernments, provided for the collecting of accurate and sufficient data 
to be employed in correcting the “List of Foreign Correspondents of

establishment; and, as a result of the attention given by the compiler

fully preserved, shall be accessible at all times to students and others 
who may desire to consult them, and be returned to the Institution in 
case the establishments to which they are presented at any time cease 
to exist. 

The following are the rules for the distribution of the Smithsonian 
publications. To enable institutions as well as individuals, not coming 
within their provisions, to procure copies of such as may be desired, they 
are sold at a price which is intended merely to cover the actual cost of 
their publication. 

Full sets can no longer be furnished, as some of the volumes are out 
of print.

Prof. Spencee F. Bated,

“His Majesty Oscar II wishing to give a fresh proof of his interest 
in the advancement of mathematical science, an interest already mani- 
fested by his graciously encouraging the publication of the journal 
Acta Mathematica, which is placed under his august protection, has 
resolved to award a prize, on the 21st of January, 1889, the sixtieth 
anniversary of his birthday, to an important discovery in the field of 
higher mathematical analysis. This prize wiU consist in a gold medal 
of the eighteenth size bearing His Majesty’s image and having a value 
of a thousand francs, together with a sum of two thousand five hun- 
dred crowns (1 crown equal to about 1 franc 40 centimes). 

“His Majesty has been pleased to intrust the task of carrying out 
His intentions to a commission of three members, Mr. Carl Weierstrass 
in Berlin, Mr. Charles Hermite in Paris, and the chief editor of this 
journal, Mr. Gosta Mittag Leffler in Stockholm. The commissioners 
having presented a report of their work to His Majesty, he has gra- 
ciously signified his approval of the following final propositions of theirs: 

“Having taken into consideration the questions which from different 
points of view equally engage the attention of analysts, and the solu- 
tion of which would be of the greatest interest for the progress of 
science, the commission respectfully proposes to His Majesty to award 
the prize to the best memoir on one of the following subjects : 

“1. A system being given of a number whatever of particles attract- 
ing one another mutually according to Newton’s law, it is proposed, on 
the assumption that there never takes place an impact of two particles, 
to expand the co-ordinates of each particle in a series proceeding accord 
ing to some known functions of time and converging uniformly for any 
space of time. 

“It seems that this problem, the solution of which will considerably 
enlarge our knowledge with regard to the system of the universe, might 
be solved by means of the analytical resources at our present disposi- 
tion ; this may at least be fairly supposed, because shortly before his 
death Lejeune-Dirichlet communicated to a friend of his, a mathema- 
tician, that he had discovered a method of integrating the differential 
equations of mechanics, and that he had succeeded, by applying this 
method, to demonstrate the stability of our planetary system in an ab-

solutely strict manner. Unfortunately we know nothing about this 
method, except that the starting point for its discovery seems to have 
been the theory of infinitely small oscillations.* It may however be 
supposed almost with certainty that this method was not based on long 
and complicated calculations, but on the development of a simple fund- 
amental idea, which one may reasonably hope to find again by means 
of earnest and persevering study. 

“However, in case no one should succeed to solve the proposed prob- 
lem within the period of the competition, the prize might be awarded 
to a work in which some other problem of mechanics is treated in the 
indicated manner and completely solved. 

“2. Mr. Fuchs has demonstrated iu several of his memoirst that 
there exist uniform functions of two variables which, by their mode of 
generation, are connected with the ultra elliptical functions, but are 
more general than these, and which would probably acquire great im- 
portance for analysis, if their theory were further developed. 

“It is proposed to obtain, in an explicit form, those functions whose 
existence has been proved by Mr. Fuchs, in a sufficiently general case, 
so as to allow of an insight into and study of their most essential 
properties. 

“ 3. A study of the functions defined by a sufficiently general differ- 
ential equation of the first order, the first member of which is a rational 
integral function with respect to the variable, the function, and its first 
differential coefficient. 

“Mr. Briot and Mr. Bouquet have opened the way for such a study 
by their memoir on this subject (Journal de I’^cole polytechnique, cahier 
36, pp. 133-198). But the mathematicians acquainted with the results 
attained by these authors know also that their work has not by far ex- 
hausted the difficult and important subject which they have first treated. 
It seems iirobable that, if fresh inquiries were to be undertaken iu the 
same direction, they might lead to theorems of high interest for analysis. 

“ 4. It is well known how much light has been thrown on the general 
theory of algebraic equations by the study of the special functions to 
which the division of the circle into equal parts and the division of the

1 argument of the elliptic functions by a whole number lead up. That 
remarkable transcendant which is obtained by expressing the module 
of an elliptic function by the quotient of the periods leads likewise 
to the modulary equations that have been the origin of entirely new 
notions and highly important results, as the solution of equations of 
the fifth degree. But this transcendant is but the first term, a par- 
ticular case and that the simplest one of an infinite series of new 
functions introduced into science by Mr. Poincar6 under the name of 
‘fonctions fuchsiennes’ and successfully applied by him to the integra- 
tion of lineary differential equations of any order. These functions, 
which accordingly have a role of manifest importance in analysis, have 
not as yet been considered from an algebraical point of view as the 
transcendant of the theory of elliptic functions of which they are the 
generalization. 

“ It is proposed to fill up this gap and to arrive at new equations 
analogous to the modulary equations by studying, though it were only 
in a particular case, the formation and properties of the algebraic rela- 
tions that connect two ‘ fonctions fuchsiennes’ when they have a group 
in common. 

‘‘ In case none of the memoirs tendered for competition on any of the 
subjects proposed above should be deemed worthy of the prize, this 
may be adjudged to a memoir sent in for competition that contains a 
complete solution of an important question of the theory of functions 
other than those proposed by the commission. 

“ The memoirs offered for competition should be furnished with an 
epigraph, and, besides, with the author’s name and place of residence 
in a sealed cover, and directed to the chief editor of the Acta Mathe- 
matica before the first of June, 1888. 

“ The memoir to which His Majesty shall be pleased to award the 
prize as well as that or those memoirs which may be considered by the 
I commission worthy of an honorary mention, will be inserted in the 
Acta Mathematica, nor can any of them be previously published. 

“The memoirs may be written in any language that the author 
( chooses, but as the members of the commission belong to three differ- 
^ ent nations the author ought to subjoin a French translation to his 
original memoir, in case it is not written in French. If such a trans- 
lation is not subjoined, the author must allow the commission to have 
one made for their own use. 

“The Editors of the Acta Mathematica.” 


I hope you will take an interest in this communication, and am, sir, 
yours, very respectfully.

University, Chief Editor of the Acta Mathematica.

ADVERTISEMENT. 


The object of the General Appendix is to furnish summaries of 
scieutiflc discovery in particular directions ; occasional reports of the 
investigations made by collaborators of the Institution; memoirs of a 
general character or on special topics, whether original and prepared 
expressly for the purpose, or selected from foreign journals and pro- 
ceedings; and briefly to present (as fully as space will permit) such 
papers not published in the “Smithsonian Contributions” or in the 
“Miscellaneous Collections” as may be supposed to be of interest or 
value to the numerous correspondents of the Institution.

RECORD OF SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS FOR 1885. 


INTRODUCTION. 

While it has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the 
Smithsonian Institution, from a very early date in its history, to enrich 
the annual report, required of them by law, with scientific memoirs 
illustrating the more remarkable and important developments in phys- 
ical and biological discovery, as well as showing the general character 
of the operations of the Institution, this purpose was not carried out 
on any very systematic plan until the year 1880. Believing however 
that an annual report or summary of the recent advances made in the 
leading departments of scientific inquiry would supply a want very 
generally felt, and would be favorably received by all those interested 
in the diffusion of knowledge, the Secretary had prepared for the re- 
port of 1880, by competent collaborators, a series of abstracts showing^ 
concisely the prominent features of recent scientific progress in astron- 
omy, geology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and 
anthropology. 

The same general programme has been followed in the subsequent 
reports, \f ith the inclusion of geography and meteorology in the list of 
subjects. The contributors to this record for the present year, and 
their seX^eral departments or topics, remain substantially the same as 
in previous reports, though with some omissions, much to be regretted. 

Prof. Edward S. Holden had prepared as usual the summary of astro- 
nomical progress for 1885, but having accepted the presidency of the 
University of California, with the directorship of the Lick Observatory 
on Mount Hamilton, in the contusion of moving from his late position 
at Madison, Wis., unfortunately mislaid his manuscript. At his re- 
quest Mr. William C. Winlock, of the Naval Observatory at Washing- 
ton, undertook, on short notice, to supply the deficiency. This he has- 
satisfactorily accomplished. 

Dr. T. Sterry Hunt, owing to the pressure of his important duties,, 
has again been prevented from supplying the expected summary of 
progress in geology. 

Commander Francis M. Green (U. S. N.), having been ordered to sea- 
duty on a three-years’ cruise, has also been prevented from furnishing 
his accustomed rSsume of advances in geographical knowledge. This- 
chapter has for the present been supplied by Mr. J. King Goodrich. 

341 


342 


SCIENTIFIC RECCED FOR 1885. 


Prof. Cleveland Abbe has, unfortunately, been unable to furnish his 
usual survey of the advances made in the department of meteorology, 
and the time did not permit an attempt to obtain a substitute in this 
important field. 

Prof. William G. Farlow’s record of progress in botany, omitted from 
the last report, is, from unforeseen circumstances, again omitted from 
this. 

With every effort to secure prompt attention to all the more impor- 
tant details of such a work, various unexpected delays frequently ren- 
der it impracticable to obtain all the desired reports in each department 
within the time prescribed. In such cases it is designed, if possible, to 
bring up deficiencies and supply them in subsequent reports. 

The value of this annual record of progress would be much enhanced 
by an enlargement of its scope, and the inclusion, not only of such 
branches as mathematics, physiology, pathology, and medicine, micros- 
copy, &c., but also of the more practical topics of agriculture and hor- 
ticultural economy, engineering, mechanics, and technology in general; 
but the space required for such larger digest seems scarcely available in 
the present channel. 

It is hardly necessary to remark that in a summary of the annual 
progress of scientific discovery so condensed as the present, the wants 
of the specialist in any branch can be but imperfectly supplied; and 
very many items and details of great value to him must be entirely 
omitted. While the student in a special field of knowledge may occa- 
sionally receive hints that will be found of interest, he will naturally 
be led to consult for fuller information the original journals and special 
periodicals from which these brief notices or abstracts have been com- 
piled. 

The plan of devoting some 350 pages of the annual report to such a 
compilation is not designed to preclude the introduction into the “Gen- 
eral Appendix,” as heretofore, of special monographs or discussions 
that may prove interesting to the scientific student.

ASTRONOMY. 


By William C. Winlock, 

Assistant Astronomer, United States Naval Ohservatory. 


The following record of the progress of Astronomy during the year 
1885 is in continuation of the records of past years, and it is given in 
essentially the same form. The annual review of astronomy has pre- 
viously been prepared by Prof. Edward S. Holden, formerly director of 
the Washburn Observatory, Madison, Wis.; and the manuscript of the 
review for 1885 was entirely prepared by him in October and November 
of that year. Very unfortunately all but a small portion of this manu- 
script was lost in transferring Professor Holden’s library from Madison 
to California, and Professor Holden, unable, on account of pressing of- 
ficial duties, to repair the loss, has asked me to make up the deficiency. 
This I have attempted to do, but wish to record the circumstances here, 
in order that I may plead the brief time available as an excuse for any 
shortcomings that may be found. 

This record is primarily intended for the large and increasing class of 
those who have a general rather than a special interest in the progress 
of Astronomy, but it may be of use to professional astronomers also, as a 
convenient collection of reviews and notes. Abstracts of some of the 
most important papers are given, while other papers can appear by title 
only. As in previous years free use has been made of reviews, &c., in 
all accessible periodicals, particularly of those in The Ohservatory, Bul- 
letin Astronomique, Nature, The Athenceum, and Science, and it is hoped 
that where specific reference to the source of information has been im- 
practicable, this general acknowledgment will be accepted.

COSMOGONY. 

Faye: Sur V Or igine du Monde. Thiories cosmogoniques des Anoiena et 
des Modernes. Paris: Qauthier-Villars, 8vo . — Cosmic hypoth- 

eses vary from time to time: they have their history, in which they re- 
flect the progress of human intelligence. At first closely connected with 
religious ideas, they have little by little lost their sacred character, and 
have become simple questions of celestial mechanics and general physics.

SCIENTIFIC EEC(>RD FOE 1885. 


It cannot be denied, moreover, that they offer a broad field for the dis- 
coveries and theories that from time to time transform and, as it were, 
renew science. The mechanical theory of heat and spectrum analysis 
have inaugurated a new era for speculations concerning the origin of 
the world and the constitution of the universe, by furnishing to theo- 
retical reasoning a basis incomparably more sure than that possessed 
at the time of Laplace. It is quite natural, therefore, that scholars 
should again turn their attention to the chaos from which the stars 
were born, and that, with the aid of the knowledge gained during the 
last century, they should undertake to submit the current cosmical 
theories to searching examination. 

M. Faye’s book upon this subject will be welcomed, as it comes at a 
moment when attention is everywhere beginning to turn to these ob- 
scure and sublime questions. A large part of the book is devoted to 
the history of cosmogonies, beginning with that of Moses ; and every 
reader will be pleased that M. Faye has taken pains to give always the 
original text, accompanying it by comments and remarks. The book 
contains extracts from Genesis, Plato’s Timceus, Aristotle’s Heavens,. 
Cicero’s De Republica, the poem of Lucrece, Descartes’ World, Newton’s 
Principia, Kant’s Allgemeine Hatur- OescMcMe und Theorie des Himmels- 
and Beweisgrund zu einer Demonstration des Daseins Gottes, Laplace’s. 
Exposition du Systeme du Monde, and from M. Hirn’s Analyse eUmen- 
taire de V Univers. After this historical exposition of ancient and mod- 
ern cosmical ideas M. Faye proceeds to consider in his turn the prob- 
lem of the formation of the universe and of the solar system. 

“ M. Faye regards Laplace’s celebrated cosmic hypothesis, which is 
still accepted in treatises on astronomy, as quite opposed to science in 
its present state 5 he says that it cannot be reconciled with the retro- 
grade motions of the satellites of Uranus and Neptune, nor with the 
rapid revolutions of Mars’ satellites, nor with our notions of the rings 
of Saturn. M. Faye proposes to replace this hypothesis by another one 
more conformable to existing ideas, taking its point of departure in 
Descartes’ vortices.” {Bull. Astron., February, 1885.) 

“Prof. G. H. Darwin has contributed to Nature (Vol. 31, p. 506) an 
interesting and valuable criticism of M. Faye’s theory of the evolution 
of the solar system as explained in his paper in the ^‘•Annuaire du Bu- 
reau des Longitudes for 1885, and also in his work entitied ^^Sur VOrigine 
du Monde.'’’’ The best general idea of the line of speculation adopted by 
M. Faye may be given by saying that it is a theory of evolution from; 
meteorites, instead of from the nebulous matter which gives its name 
to Laplace’s theory. In the primitive condition, the universe consisted 
of matter scattered in chaotic confusion. Currents were generated in 
the midst of this chaos under the influence of mutual gravitation ; and 
in consequence of these movements, shreds of matter became detached 
and moved with rapid li near and slow gyratory motion. The solar sys- 
tem is taken to have originated from a shred which aggregated inta

a spheroidal shape and consisted, at the epoch when we began to watch 
it, largely of separate meteorites. It is at first supposed that the sphe- 
roidal aggregate consists of matter pretty nearly equally distributed, 
and later a nucleus is formed. If r be the distance of any jjoint from the 

center, the force is central and follows the law ar H where, in the 
' ^ ,6 

beginning of the evolutionary process, h is very small, and later a be- 
comes small. Initially, then, w’hen the force is simply as the distance, 
each meteorite moves in an ellipse about the center, and the periodic 
time of all is the same, whatever their eccentricity of orbit. In con- 
sequence of collisions, a central nucleus is soon formed ; as this in- 
creases, the a in our formula for the force diminishes and the 6 increases, 
but orbits which are circular still retain that form, notwithstanding 
the progressive change in the law of force. At the same time that the 
nucleus is being formed, a series of flat and nearly circular rings arise 
around it, those near to the nucleus attaining a definite shape sooner 
than the remote ones. It is not adequately explained why the mat- 
ter should be sifted, and should arrange itself in rings at definite in- 
tervals around the nucleus, still less is any light thrown on the law 
of Titius concerning the distances of the planets from the sun. Con- 
sidering now the case of the first ring, M. Faye supposes that slight 
differences ot angular velocity, mutual attraction, and collisions grad- 
ually cause the aggregation of all the matter in the ring around some 
center in its line. When the nucleus is small, the rings moved as a 
rigid whole, and the linear velocity of the outer meteorites was greater 
than that of the inner ones; therefore when the planetary aggregate is 
formed, it will be found rotating with direct motion about an axis nearly 
perpendicular to the plane of its orbit. As we proceed from the first 
ring outwards, in each successive case the tendency to direct motion is 
weaker, because the increase of the solar nucleus by absorption of me- 
teorites has prevented so large an excess of linear velocity of the outer 
meteorites over those of the inner ones as in the first case. By degrees, 
therefore, we come to planets in which the meteorites move nearly ac- 
cording to Kepler’s laws, and here the resulting planet has a retrograde 
rotation. Each planetary agglomeration in its turn forms a miniature 
solar system, and generates satellites by the same process as that in 
which the planets were formed. After having thus sketched M. Faye’s 
theory in its main outlines. Professor Darwin points out that no refer- 
ence is made to the possible eff’ect of tides in the evolution of the solar 
system, a part of the subject which has been so ably worked but by 
Professor Darwin himself. He has shown that the hypothesis that tidal 
friction has had free play in the past leads to a remarkable quantitative 
co-ordination of the several elements of the earth’s rotation and of the 
moon’s orbital motion, and points to the genesis of the moon close to 
the present surface of the earth. The rapid orbital motion of the inner 
satellite of Mars confirms in a remarkable way the truth of the hy-

pothesis. It also throws light on the cause of the observed distribu- 
tion of satellites in the solar system. It is, in Professor Darwin’s opin- 
ion, a factor which cannot be left out of account, and has a bearing 
on theories of evolution which cannot be neglected. Professor Darwin’s 
paper concludes with a summary of the advantages and disadvantages 
of M. Faye’s scheme. The conception of the growth of planetary bodies 
by the aggregation of meteorites is a good one, and perhaps more prob- 
able than the hypothesis that the whole solar system was gaseous. The 
internal annulation of the meteorites is left unexplained, and this com- 
pares very unfavorably with Laplace’s system, where the annulation is 
the very thing explained. The difference of orbital motion of the inner 
and outer meteorites of a ring, the development of that difference as time 
progresses, and the consequence of direct and retrograde rotation at dif. 
ferent distances from the sun, is an excellent idea. But it is necessary 
to this idea that the inner planets should have been formed first,* and 
we are met directly by the fact that the single surviving ring, that of 
Saturn, is nearer to the planet than are the satellites, and we should be 
driven to the startling conclusion that Saturn’s ring is the oldest feature 
of his system. The actual distribution of satellites in the solar system 
is at variance with M. Faye’s theory, for as, according to him, the internal 
planets were generated from rings whose motion was such as would give 
greater moment of momentum to the planetary agglomeration than would 
the external ones, the number of satellites should be greater the greater 
the amount of rotation in the primitive agglomeration of meteorites, and 
thus the nearer planets should be richer in satellites than the remote 
ones. On the whole, then, there are great difficulties in the acceptance 
of M. Faye’s scheme, notwithstanding its excellences; but science is un- 
doubtedly the gainer bj' such suggestive theories.” {Observatory. ) 

For further discussion of these interesting questions we must refer 
the reader to the valuable articles of MM. Eadau and Wolf in Volumes 
I and II of the Bulletin Astronomique^ and to a paper by Prof. Daniel 
Kirkwood, read before the American Philosophical Society (November 
21, 1884) and published in the April number of the Sidereal Messenger. 
We are glad to learn that M. Wolf intends to elaborate his discussion 
still further, and that it will be brought out in book form by the pub- 
lishing house of Gauthier-Villars. 

NEBULA. 

New nebulce. — M. Stephan has published in the Astronomische Nach- 
richten^ No, 2661, positions and descriptions of 100 nebulae discovered 
at Marseilles in the years 1883-’85, in addition to the large number pre- 
viously detected at that observatory. Not the least notable character- 

* In fact, according to M. Faye, the earth is older than the sun. “ If it were other- 
wise, the whole appearance of the sky would be changed ; the stars would rise in the 
west and set in the east; the moon would have a retrograde motion like the satellites 
of Uranus and Neptune.” (Sur VOrigine du Monde, p. 192.)

istic of M. Stephan’s catalogues is the precision of the Places given in 
them. He mentions that on October 1 and 2, 1882, neither the nebula 
Dreyer-Schultz 6085 nor h 12 was visible in the position assigned by 
the discoverers. 

Professor Swift gives in the Astronomische NacJirichten two catalogues 
of nebulae discovered in 1883-’85 with the 16-inch refractor of the War- 
ner Observatory. Each catalogue contains 100 nebulae and gives approx- 
imate positions for 1885-0, with descriptive notes. All of these nebulae 
belong to the fainter classes, and the increased difficulties in dealing 
with such objects since the appearance of our “ red sunsets” have been 
remarked by Professor Swift, as well as by other observers. Professor 
Swift has a list of some 150 more nebulae, which will require further 
study before publication. 

Several shorter lists of nebulae, found by Tempel, Barnard, and others, 
generally in the search for comets, wdl be found in the various astro- 
nomical journals. 

General catalogiie of nebulce. — Apropos of Dr. Holetschek’s letter 
{Astron. N'aehr., No. 2664) concerning the regular publication of sup- 
plementary catalogues of new nebulae, double stars, red stars, &c., Dr. 
Dreyer announces that he is preparing a second supplement to Sir John 
Herschel’s Catalogue of Nebulae. 

Discovery of a new nebula in the Pleiades by photography. — Probably 
the most notable achievement in celestial photography during the year 
has been the discovery by MM. Paul and Prosper Henry, at the Paris 
Ob.servatory, of a new nebula in the group of the Pleiades. It was first 
photographed on November 16, 1885, and, though it was again photo- 
graphed on December 8 and 9, MM. Henry have as yet been unable to 
detect it by direct telescopic observation. The nebula is about 3’ in ex- 
tent, and “ tres- intense.^’’ It presents a well-marked spiral form, and 
seems partially to surround the star Maia. 

Professor Pickering writes, under date of January 21, 1886, to the 
editor of the Nachrichten in regard to this interesting discovery, as fol- 
lows : 

“ The announcement of this nebula in the A. W., vol. 113, p. 239, re- 
called the circumstance that certain irregularities had been noticed in a 
photograph of the Pleiades, taken on November 3, 1885, at the observa- 
tory of Harvard College, with an exposure of sixty-five minutes. This 
photograph was exhibited at the Albany meeting of the National Acad- 
emy of Sciences, November 10, where the irregularities above mentioned 
received some attention. They were supposed to be due merely to defects 
in the photographic process ; but upon re-examination it appears that one 
of them corresponds so closely to what is described by MM. Paul and 
Prosper Henry that there can be no doubt in regard to its origin. It 
must represent light photographically perceptible in the vicinity of 
the star Maia, as stated by its discoverers. - - - The explanation 


348

thus afforded of one of the markings on the Cambridge photograph 
makes the others of more interest than seemed at first to belong to them. 
There are indicationsof nebulous light about Merope; four short parallel 
streaks directly to the south following side are particularly noticeable, 
and a faint prolongation of diffuse light may be suspected towards the 
south, in agreement with the descriptions usually given of the visible 
nebula in that region. There is also a faint narrow streak of light pro- 
jecting from Electra on the following side. All the bright stars are 
surrounded by concentric bands, obviously due to effects of reflection 
from the back of the plate and from the inner surfaces of the lenses. 
These bands interfere to some extent with the appearances of nebulous 
light above described, and are most conspicuous around Alcyone, as 
would be exj)ected from the brightness of that star. No nebulous light 
is noticeable about Alcyone, Atlas, Pleione, or Taygeta.” 

Professor Struve announces that he has seen the nebula about Maia 
very distinctly with the great 30 inch Refractor of the Pulkowa Ob- 
servatory. We learn also from later reports that the nebula has been 
seen and sketched at the Nice Observatory. 

Photographic study of the nebula of Orion. — Prof. E. C. Pickering has 
made a comparison of the results of photographic and eye observations 
of this region, comparing the star magnitudes as given by the photo- 
graphs of Dr. Draper and Mr. Common, with the catalogue of Profes- 
sor Bond. His results will be found carefully tabulated in the twen- 
tieth volume of the Proceedings of the American Academy. One of the 
most important applications of the determination of photographic mag- 
nitudes is to the measurement of the colors of the stars. The rays af- 
fecting the photographic plate have in general a less wave length than 
those to which the eye is most sensitive. It therefore follows that a 
reddish star, that is, one in which the rays of great wave length pre 
dominate, will appear relatively too faint in the photograph. A bluish 
star is similarly indicated by a large negative residual (on comparison 
with eye estimates). These residuals form a convenient measure of the 
colors of the stars ; and Professor Pickering gives a list of ten red stars, 
thus indicated on the plate, varying from lO-T to 13-9 magnitude, ac- 
cording to Bond, and ten blue stars, varying from 12-3 to 15‘6 magni- 
tude. “The faintest stars visible in the photograph have a photo- 
graphic magnitude of about 15-0.” 

Variability of a nebula. — “ The nebula near the star C Tauri seems to 
present an interesting instance of variability of light. This nebula 
was observed by Chacornac at Paris on the 19th of October, 1885, sur- 
rounding a star of the 11th magnitude, which had repeatedly been ob- 
served in 1854, and also at Markree in January, 1850, without any nebu- 
losity being noticed. In January, 1856, Chacornac found this very 
bright and conspicuous, resembling in its appearance a transparent 
cloud, reflecting the light of C Tauri. But in November, 1862, he could

discern no trace of the nebulosity ; and D’ Arrest also failed to see it 
when observing the star with the Copenhagen refractor on the 25th of 
January, 1865. Nor has it since been seen until quite recently, when 
it was noticed by Mr. K. Tarrant, using a 10-inch ‘With’ reflector, at 
Pinner, Middlesex. D’Arrest had noticed a small star of less than the 
12th magnitude, a little preceding the 11th magnitude star previously 
mentioned, and nearly on the same parallel with it. When the nebula 
was first seen by Mr. Tarrant (on the 14th of March, 1885), it was 
lengthened in the direction of a circle of declination, and this faint star 
was at its following edge. The first known instance of this kind was 
that of the nebula near s Tauri, discovered by Mr. Hind in 1852, sus- 
pected to be variable from not having been se^n before, and afterwards 
proved to be so, becoming invisible even with very powerful telescopes, 
and subsequently reappearing.” {Athenceum.) 

ASTRONOMICAL CONSTANTS, ETC. 


A new determination of the nutation constant. — ‘‘Dr. L. de Ball has 
employed for this determination the right ascensions of three polar 
stars (or and <5 IJrsae Minoris and 51 Cephei), observed at Pulkowa by 
Herr W agner, part of which have already been emploj’^ed by Herr Ny- 
r^n in his researches concerning the constant of aberration.” {Bulletin 
Astron., i, p. 202.) Although these observations, which were made be- 
tween 1861 and 1872, embrace only a little more than half a complete 
period of nutation, their precision is such as to justify Dr. de Ball’s 
attempt. He has had at his disposal 934 eye and-ear observations and 
933 chronograph observations. The mean error of an observation is 
nearly the same for the two methods. By introducing as unknown 
quantities the corrections to the mean right ascensions of the three 
stars to the nutation constant (Peters) and to the aberration constant 
(Struve), and also the parallaxes of the stars under consideration. Dr. 


de Ball has attained the following results :

“ The individual values of Ja, computed by Dr. de Ball, differ quite 
widely in some cases from the values obtained by Herr Nyrdn from the 
same observations, and it seems impossible to discover the cause of 
these differences. It is without doubt necessary to take into considera- 
tion the influence which the motion of the solar system might exert upon 
the aberration in the case of stars near the pole, as has been shown by 
Dr. Seeliger.” [Bull. Astron., July, 1885.) 

The secular nutation of the earWs axis. — “ M. Folie, having deduced a 
periodic formula for the secular variations in obliquity and in longitude, 
applies the designation ‘secular natation of the earth’s axis’ to these 
variations. Defining the normal equator as a plane, the inclination of 
which to the ecliptic of a certain epoch is equal to the mean obliquity 
of that epoch, and the intersection of which with this latter plane passes 
at each instant through the mean equinox of that instant, he concludes 
that, in virtue of the secular nutation of the earth’s axis, the mean pole 
describes around the normal pole, considered as fixed, an ellipse the 
major axis of which, directed towards the pole of the fixed ecliptic (i. e , 
the mean ecliptic of the epoch), is sensible during several centuries. 
The period of the secular nutation is about 30,000 years, differing little 
from that of the precession on account of the slow motion of the node 
of the ecliptic, which is only ^"-1 per annum. Assuming a uniform 
value of 50" for the secular diminution of the obliquity, M. Folie com- 
pares the results obtained from his formula with ancient observations 
of the obliquity, and is thus led to announce that the empirical expres- 
sion £i=0"-476-|-0"-000018t for the annual diminution (where t is the 
number of years from 1850) satisfies very closely the observations from 
—250 to -(-1487. This expression, however, gives a considerably greater 
variation to the secular diminution of the obliquity than that wliich re- 
sults from Leverrier’s researches.” (Nature.) 

Precession tables. — In the Monthly Notices for December there will be 
found tables by Mr. Eambaut for the reduction of Bessel’s precessions 
to those of Struve. 

Astronomical refraction. — M. Loewy has recently communicated to 
the Academic des Sciences an account of a method which he considers 
to be especially adapted for determining the constant and other ele- 
ments of refraction. The principle of the method is this : A glass 
prism with silvered faces, forming a double mirror, is placed in front 
of the object glass of an equatorial. By means of this arrangement 
the images of two stars which are widely se])arated in the 8k> can be 
brought close together in the focal plane of the telescope ; tlius one 
star may be at the zenith and the other on the horizon, in which case 
the measured distance between the images will be largely aftected by 
refraction. After an interval of three or four hours, when the stars are 
at an equal height above the horizon, and when, therefore, the eflect of 


ASTEONOMT. 


351 


refraction is a minimum, the distance between the images is again 
measured. The comparison of these two observations gives the means 
of determining the amount of the refraction with great accuracy. It is 
of course necessary for the success of the method that the measures 
should be absolutely independent of every possible displacement of the 
apparatus in the interval between the observations. This result is ob- 
tained by placing the double mirror in such a position that the planes 
of reflection for the two stars coincide, as M. Lcewy finds that under, 
these circumstances, whatever small displacements the mirror may un- 
dergo, the distance between the images in the field of the telescope, 
measured in the plane of reflection, or the projection of this distance on 
the trace of the plane of reflection in the field, remains invariable. M. 
Lcewy claims for this method that, on account of its simplicity and the 
ease with which it can be put in practice, it completely solves the prob- 
lem to which he applies it. A few experiments ought to show whether 
it is capable of affording results sufficiently accurate to make the method 
of practical value. [Observatory.) 

STAB CATALOGUES, ETC. 

Glasgow catalogue. — “The Glasgow Catalogue,* recently published 
by Mr. Eobert Grant, is the subject of a very detailed review by Dr. 
Auwers in the Vierteljahrsschrift for 1884. The catalogue depends 
upon observations made since 1860 by the Ertel meridian circle, and 
comprehends, besides some hundreds of bright stars selected from the 
B. A. C., more than 6,000 telescopic stars from Weisse’s first cata- 
logue. The stability of the instrument has been satisfactory, although 
not comparable with that of the Greenwich circle. The process of re- 
duction employed by Mr. Grant is not entirely beyond criticism. Dr. 
Auwers has undertaken a minute comparison of this catalogue with 
that of the Astronomische Oesellschaft in order to determine the relative 
precision of Mr. Grant’s positions. He finds the mean error of these 
positions to be ± 0®-06 and ± 0"'9 for the unit of weight (which depends 
upon the number of observations). This mean error being 0®'04 and 
0"-6 for the best catalogues, Dr. Auwers thinks the relative weight, one- 
half, may be attributed to the Glasgow positions.” [Bull. Astron., 
March, 1885.) 

Cordoba Zone catalogue. — “ In a notice in the Observatory for January, 
1885, devoted to Dr. Gould’s zones, Mr. Downing shows the high value 
of this great work, which it has required no less than thirteen years to 
bring to completion. We already owe to Dr. Gould the Uranometria 
Argentina, which the Eoyal Astronomical Society honored in 1883 with 
its gold medal. The publication of a general catalogue is looked for 
soon, and this, with the catalogues of the Cape and Melbourne, will 
measure the extent of our knowledge of the southern heavens.

“ The zone observations were commenced in 1872. The total number 
of observations is more than 105,000 for 73,160 stars, between — 23° and 
— 80° of declination, the lowest magnitude being the 10th. The Kepsold 
meridian circle is revereible; the objective has an aperture of 122““, 
and a focal length of 1“463 ; the divided circle has a diameter of 0“-716, 
and the readings were made by means of four microscopes. In the 
zone observations it was the rule to observe the transits over three 
.threads, and to read but one microscope. The right ascensions depend 
u}>on the positions of Dr. Gould’s fundamental stars, published by the 
Coast Survey, and nadir observations have been made concurrently with 
observations of polar distance. The mean error in right ascension is 
0®'062, and in declination 0"-97. The observations were made under the 
best conditions, and no pains have been spared in determining accurately 
the instrumental errors and in verifying the reductions.” {Bull. Astron., 
February, 1885.) 

The stereotype plates of this catalogue have been placed in the cus- 
tody of the Astronomische Gesellschaft. We make the following ex- 
tract from a letter of Dr. Gould’s in regard to the matter: “ The recently 
published catalogue, formed from the Cordoba Zones, was printed from 
stereotype ])lates, in order that any errors discovered up to the last 
moment might be corrected before the work should be actually printed. 
The itlan has proved successful, and 1 believe the catalogue to be more 
than usually correct ; nevertheless, a considerable number of errors 
have been detected since it was printed, and a list of these will soon be 
sent to the Astronomische Nachriehten. I have now been charged by 
the Argentine Government with the agreeable duty of causing the re- 
cently detected errors to be corrected upon the stereotype plates, and 
offering these to the Astronomische Gesellschaft, for its acceptance, in 
case the gift should not be considered too burdensome. - - - It is 
of course understood that the gift of the plates carries with it the fullest 
authority for the Astronomische Gesellschaft to use them for printing a 
new edition whenever it may see fit.” 

Catalogue of 1,001 southern stars. — Volume 3 of the Publications of 
the Washburn Observatory contains a catalogue of 1,001 stars between 
18° and 29° 39' of south declination, formed by Eev. Father Hagen 
and Professor Holden from a series of 2,101 observations made by Pro- 
fessor Tacchini with the Pistor and Martins meridian circle at Palermo 
in the years 1867, 1868, 1869. The observations were originally pub- 
lished in the Bullettino Meteorologico del B. Osservatorio di Palermo 
from April, 1867, to July, 1869, where the apparent place and epoch are 
given, and Professor Holden says that the existence of this valuable 
material became known to him through the admirable Vade-Mecum of 
M. Houzeau. The stars observed are from the 6th to the 9th magnitude, 
and the magnitudes appear to have been very carefully noted, while it 
is remarked that the positions are excellent. They are reduced to the 
year 1 850*0, but the mean epoch of observation of each star is appended.

Professor Holden and Father Hagen have also derived the places of 
437 southern stars for ISoO.O from Washington transit-circle observations, 
and these x)laces have been compared with positions given in the Cape 
Catalogue for 1880, the Cordoba Zones, and Yaruall’s Catalogue. The 
comparisons are printed in the volume referred to above, and will be of 
value in deducing the relations of the various systems adopted. 

The ^’•anonymous'’'’ stars of YarnalVs Catalogue * — Prof. E. Millosevich 
has published a useful contribution to exact astronomy in his paper, 
Salle Stelle horeali fino «— 1° inclusivo dette Anonymous’’ del Catalogo di 
Tarnall (Washington, 1878). It appears that between the limits +90° 
and— 1° declination, TarnalPs Catalogue contains 732 stars which are 
designated as anonymous. Professor Millosevich has carefully gone 
through these, comparing them with the DM., or with the catalogues 
of Weisse, Eiimker, Struve, Lalande, or Oeltzen’s Argelander, and has 
succeeded in almost every case (sometimes by making conjectural cor- 
rections to Yarnall’s places) in identifying the star in the Washington 
Catalogue. The paper also contains a comparison of the estimates of 
magnitude made by the Washington observers and by Argelander in 
the case of these anonymous stars. After applying a systematic cor- 
rection of -t-0'3 of a magnitude to Yarnall, Professor Millosevich finds 
that there are 33 stars which differ by 0-9 of a magnitude or more in 
the two catalogues, and gives a list of these with their places for 1860'0, 
as there is a strong presumption that they will prove to be variables. 
Taken in conjunction with Holden’s List of Errata in Yarnall {Astron. 
Nachr., 17o. 2561), Professor Millosevich’s paper is a useful addendum 
to the Washington Catalogue for 1860.” {Observatory.) 

Professor Frisby, of the Naval Observatory, i^ now at work upon a 
third edition of YarnalVs Catalogue, in which it is intended to correct all 
the errors thus far detected. 

Harvard College catalogue of 1,213 stars /br 1875. — “This catalogue 
contains the results of observations made during the years 1870 to 1879 
with the meridian circle of the Harvard College Observatory, the stars 
observed being chiefly those required for the revision of the Burch- 
musterung for the .''-one between the parallels of declination 4-50° and 
-j-55o. The star places employed as points of reference were taken 
from the list given in Publication xiv of the Astron. Oesellschaft. The 
right ascensions and declinations published in the catalogue are de- 
rived from a discussion of the results obtained during the whole period 
covered by the observations. They are given in their present form for 
the purpose of making them immediately available in advance of the 
publication of the volume which is to furnish the details of the investi- 
gation, viz, volume xv of the Annals. The observations were nearly 
all made by Professor Kogers, who has also had charge of their reduc- 
tion and publication, — a statement which is a sufficient guarantee for

the accuracy of the observations, and for the thoroughness of the re- 
ductions.” {Observatory.) 

Cape observations . — Dr. Gill has published, in one volume, the Cape 
Meridian Observations 1879-’81. During these years the Cape transit 
circle was employed in observing, in conjunction with Leyden, d list of 
fundamental stars required in the meridian observation of the stars 
between declination — 1° and — 20°, contained in Schonfeld’s extension 
of the Burehmusterung. In addition to these, two further lists of stars 
were observed, one of which had large Z. D. at the Cape and small Z. D. 
at Leyden, the stars of the other list culminating near the zenith of the 
Cape and at small altitudes at Leyden. There were also observed dur- 
ing these years stars which were employed in the longitude operations 
connecting Aden and the Cape. {Observatory.) 

Cape catalogue for 1850. — Dr. Gill has also recently published (no date 
of publication) a catalogue of 4,810 stars, theresults of observations made 
at the Eoyal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope, from 1849 to 1852, under 
the direction of Sir Thomas Maclear. The right ascensions were ob- 
served with Dollond’s transit, which was mounted in 1828, immedi- 
ately after the erection of the observatory buildings. The north polar 
distance observations were made with the mural circle, which was 
mounted in 1829. “ ISTo proper motions are given in the catalogue, and 

none have been applied to the star places. The catalogue therefore 
represents the places of the stars at the epoch of observation, but re- 
duced to the equinox 1850-0.” For the purpose of determining sys- 
tematic errors a comparison is given with the Cape catalogue for 1880, 
the separate results being given in a column marked “ Cape 1880, minus 
Cape 1850.” , 

Fundamental stars . — At the meeting of the Eoyal Astronomical So- 
ciety on March 13, 1885, “Mr. Downing read a i)aper on the star iilaces 
given in the Nautical Almanac. The star places in the Nautical Alma- 
nac for 1884 were derived from the Nine-Year Catalogue, while in 1883 
and preceding years the Seven-Year Catalogue was employed. Mr. 
Downing has deduced the systematic discordances resulting from the 
change of catalogues. In considering the E. A.’s he found for 24 stars 
discordances greater than 0®-05, their mean discordance being 0®-064, 
which seems to indicate inaccuracies in the proper motions employed. 
If Dr. Auwers’s results for these stars’ proper motions are substituted 
for those of Main and Stone, the mean discordance is reduced to 0®-042. 
It seems, then, desirable to adopt the proper motions that are the re- 
sult of Dr. Auwers’s researches. In one of the last volumes of the Ber- 
liner Jalirbueh, Dr. Auwers has made a comparative study of the po- 
sitions of fundamental stars contained in the principal ephemerides, in 
particular the Nautical Almanac. He shows in this article that a suffi- 
ciently accurate allowance for the proper motions has not always been 
made.

“Mr. Downing read a second paper upon the K. A.’s of the Cape cata- 
logues of 1850 and 1880. He has compared the E. A.’s of the catalogue 
of 1850 with those of the catalogue of 1840, those of the catalogue of 
1880 with the Melbourne catalogue for 1870, and with the Cape cata- 
logue for 1860. The results of the Cape for 1850 and 1880 have thus 
been referred to the mean of three other catalogues (Melbourne, 1870; 
Cape, 1840 and 1860). Mr. Downing’s conclusion is that the discord- 
ances between the two Cape catalogues for 1850 and 1880 should not be 
laid to the account of the latter catalogue. There is an error of 0®T 
at 140° polar distance.” {Bull. Astron., May, 1885.) 

New methods of determining the co-ordinates of polars without the 
necessity of hnowing the instrumental constants. — According to the usual 
method the instrumental constants are determined by supposing the 
co ordinates of one or two polars to be known ; these co-ordinates are 
corrected from time to time by the combination of all the available 
pairs of observations separated from each other by twelve hours; these 
pairs of observations are, however, rather rare. If the star observed is 
situated very near the pole, the circle that it describes in its diurnal 
inotiort will be entirely comprised within the field of the telescope, and 
evidently observations of the star’s position, separated by four hours, 
for example, may take the place of those separated by twelve hours. 

M. Loewy gives formul®, by whose aid two observations separated 
by an interval of four hours may be taken, and certain geometrical con- 
ditions indicated by his theory being complied with the whole effect of 
the instrumental errors may be eliminated. The co-ordinates of polars 
may be thus determined with a high degree of precision and quite in- 
dependently of the level, azimuth, and collimation errors, as well as of 
the flexure and division errors.. {Bull. Astron., August, 1885.) 

Inaccuracies due to the use of the usual formulce in the reduction of 
polar stars. A method of observing polars at any distance from the meri- 
dian. — “ It is sometimes convenient to observe circumpolar stars when 
off the meridian; the ordinary reduction may then. lead to erroneous 
results. M. Loewy introduces a simple corrective term, by employing 
which the desired accuracy may be attained ; the computation is facili- 
tated by a numerical table annexed to the mem oir.” {Bu ll. Astron., April, 
1885.) 

Star -charts. — In the Vierteljahrsschrift for 1884 Herr Palisa, in speak- 
ing of the publication of Dr. O. H. F. Peters’s celestial charts, enters into 
sorue interesting details concerning the different processes employed in 
the construction of charts to be used in searching for minor planets. 
He speaks briefly of the very appreciable differences between Dr. 
Peters’s estimates of magnitude and those of other observers when the 
stars under consideration are below the tenth magnitude. Thus Dr. 
Peters’s eleventh magnitude stars are called twelfth and thirteenth mag-

uitude by Herr Palisa. Herr Palisa made bis estimates with a 12 inch 
telescope, Dr. Peters with a 13.5-iucb. Herr Palisa adds that, after 
having used a 6 inch telescope at Pola for a long time, he found himself 
quite unable to estimate magnitudes with his 12 inch for as much as a 
year after beginning to use it, the differences of intensity between the 
tenth and thirteenth magnitudes seeming much less sensible than with 
the 6 inch. Dr. Peters’s twenty charts that are already published are 
remarkably accurate, according to the careful revision of them made by 
Herr Palisa. {Bull. Astron., March, 1885.) 

Scintillation of stars . — The instrument employed daily by M. Mon- 
tigny consists of a telescope of 0“-077 aperture, which contains, in front 
of the focus, a circular piece of glass, capable of being turned more or 
less rapidly about an axis parallel to the optical axis of the telescope; 
the glass plate, when slightly inclined toward the optical axis, causes 
the luminous rays to deviate laterally, and when it is very rapidly re- 
volved a luminous circumference appears interrupted by colored arcs, 
which correspond to the changes of color. The number of these arcs, 
which is determined by means of a micrometer especially adapted for 
the purpose, in which are two cross-threads comprising an aliquot part 
of the circumference, divided by the number of revolutions made by the 
plate in one second, gives the number of changes per second of the 
star’s color. 

Dufour seems to have been the first to make a regular series of obser- 
vations of the changes of color in stars. Without any especial instru- 
ment, simply comparing the stars among themselves (as is often done 
for variable stars) Dufour came to the following conclusions : 

(1) Eed stars scintillate less than white stars. 

(2) Excepting near the horizon the scintillation is proportional to 
the product obtained by multiplying the thickness of the air traversed 
by the luminous ray by the astronomical refraction of the altitude under 
consideration. 

(3) Aside from the influence of color there are essential differences in 
the scintillation of different stars, which seem to depend upon the stars 
themselves. 

The second law is important, as it permits of reducing all observa- 
tions to the same zenith distance (the angle of 60° has been adopted). 

M. Montigny has confirmed the results of the Swiss investigator by 
means of his scintillometer, and has further shown on what the scintil- 
lation of stars may depend. According to the work of Secchi, Huggins, 
and Miller, the stars are arranged in two great classes : White or blue 
stars, like Sirius, whose spectra show, in particular, hydrogen bands; 
yellow stars, like the sun, with spectra containing numerous flue lines 
(magnesium, sodium, &c.). In grouping his observations M. Montigny 
afiirms that both for Dufour and himself: 

“ The stars whose spectra are characterized by dark bands and black 
lines scintillate l^ss than stars whose spectra are composed of numer- 


ASTKONOMY. 357 

OU8 fine lines and much less than those whose spectra present some 
principal rays.” 

Collecting his observations, M. Montigny has formed a Catalogue de 
Scintillation des princif ales ^Jtoiles of the northern heavens. 

The most original part of M Montigny’s researches concerns the in 
flnence of the state of the atmosphere, of terrestrial magnetism, and 
of aurorae upon scintillation. Without entering into details, we would 
speak of the fact that the author has taken note of some of the charac- 
teristics of the luminous curve of the scintillometer ; besides the in- 
tensity already defined, he now observes the aspect of the circular area, 
which appears sometimes regular (in clear weather), sometimes diftuse, 
curved or broken (during a rain) ; he also observes the different colors 
seen in the scintillometer, which are quite t)right with a clear sky. M. 
Montigny’s article closes as follows : 

“ That which exercises the most marked influence upon scintillation 
and most modifies its characteristics is the presence in the atmosphere 
of a greater or less quantity of water, whether disseminated in the 
form of vapor or falling in the form of rain or snow.” 

M. Montigny is of the opinion that the continued study of scintilla- 
tion will furnish useful data for weather predictions. {Bull. Astron., 
August, 1885.) 

STELLAE PAEALLAX. 

Heliometer determinations of stellar parallax in the southern hemisphere, 
by David Gill and W. L. Elhin {Mem. B. A. S., Vol. 48, Part i, 194 
pages). — The heliometer has an aperture of 4 inches, and is fully de- 
scribed in the Dun Echt Publications, vol. n. The only modification 
made by Dr. Gill to this instrument, — which he had already employed 
in 1874 at Mauritius, at the time of the opposition of Juno, and in 1877 
on bis expedition to Ascension Island at the time of the opposition of 
Mars, — was in the rotation of the tube in its cradle. 

The plan adojited may be explained in a few words. To refer the star 
that is being investigated to neighboring stars situated symmetrically 
with reference to the first star, near the major axis of the parallactic 
ellipse and differing little in magnitude; to reduce the brightness of the 
star to be investigated sufBciently for its image to be comparable with 
those of the comparison stars, by means of wire screens ; finally, to sub- 
stitute differential measures for absolute ones, grouping the successive 
observations in such a way as to obtain the distances of the principal 
star from the two other stars at the same instant, and consequently so 
as to obtain the relation of the difference of the distances to their sum 
without bringing in the absolute value of the scale. 

It seems probable that systematic errors will be thus almost entirely 
avoided, especially if several observers combi ue their results. Let us 
consider the operations in detail, taking a Ceutauri as an example. 

There was an unusual difficulty in this case, a Oentauri being a double 


358 


SCIENTIFIC EECOED FOE 1885. 


Star, The screen employed reduced to the magnitude 8J, and rendered 
it impossible to distinguish o-j, but at the same time the measures of 
distances from stars fainter than 7‘5 magnitude could not be so well 
made with a 4-inch heliometer. However, the 16 measures forming a 
complete observation are always made as follows: Each distance is 
measured twice for the sake of eliminating the constant error of the in- 
dex, commencing with one of the stars, say a, then passing to /?, turn- 
ing the tube 180° in its cradle, taking again and then a to complete 
the series. The sum and difi'erence of the distances of a 2 . Oentauri from 
the first pair of stars chosen by Mr. Gill have the following parallactic 
factors : 

or + /3, 0-011 R cos (©— 960-0), 

or - /?, 1-881 R cos (0—3470-3); 

R and © indicating the radius vector and the sun’s longitude ; the max- 
ima and minima of the parallax for or — /3 occur upon March 7 and Sep- 
tember 10. 

We may pass over all that refers to the various corrections, the errors 
of the screw, refraction, the proper motion of or Oentauri and aberra- 
tion ; it will suffice to say that in adopting for the sum ot the distances a 
mean value derived from all the observations, the distances and their 
differences were reduced to a normal scale, and the only question now is 
whether these differences are not affected by systematic errors inherent 
in the observer. It might be, for example, that the observer would in- 
sensibly change his method of proceeding, thus introducing a term pro- 
portional to the time, but the personal error might also depend upon the 
hour angle if one observed to the east or to the west of the meridian, 
and at a greater or less distance from it, and in passing from one posi- 
tion to another a discontinuity might occur.* Mr, Gill used a reversing 
prism for Mars in 1877 for the sake of eliminating this last cause of 
error,t and he regrets not having continued its use, and avoiding thus, 
as he says, so much labor. The observations commenced July 6, 1881, 
and were continued regularly until April, 1882, when the existence of a 
systematic error depending upon the hour angle became evident. After 
this the conditions under which the observations were made were care- 
fully noted, and it was possible to recall the conditions of the greater 
part of the i)receding observations. 

There are four series of observations for a Oentauri — two by Mr. Gill, 
and two by Mr. Elkin — with four pairs of comparison stars. One of the 
first facts to be proved is the impossibility of treating the observations 
of each series as a whole. Mr Gill’s diagrams prove this, as do also 
Mr, Elkin’s numbers (giving his observations equal weights, Mr. Elkin 

* It is known that observations of the nadir and measures of the declination of a 
star when between two threads are influenced by the position of the observer. 

t Dr. Seeliger has also recently recommended the use of such a prism (Bull. Astran., i, 
p. 450). We believe that one has been employed at the observatory of Leyden for a 
long time.

fouud from his two series the values 0''-65 and 0''-55 instead of 0"‘75). 
It seems best, then, to represent the influence of the systematic error 
by a trigonometric series depending upon the angle formed by the di- 
rection of the measures with the vertical, or more simply to admit for 
each position of the eye a constant error, varying slightly with the hour 
angle. iMr. Elkin proceeds thus, and his idea seems very rational. It 
is possible that Mr. Gill’s second series of observations might be repre- 
sented in the same way without introducing any hypothesis concerning 
the orbital motion of a Centauri. 

After having given an idea of the delicate questions which Mr. Gill 
and Mr. Elkin have had to solve, it remains to present the results ob- 
tained :

It is known that the observatory at the Cape will possess in two years 
from now a 7-inch heliometer, while Mr. Elkin has at his disposal, 
at Yale College, the most beautiful heliometer known to-day (6 inches 
aperture). It is quite possible that within ten years stellar astronomy 
may be enriched by discoveries of the greatest value. (O. Callandreau, 
in Bull. Astron., January, 1885.) 

Parallax of 4^0 Bridani. — Professor Hall publishes in No. 2682 of 
the Astronomische Naehrichten the results of observations made in 1883 
and 1884 to determine the annual parallax of the star 40 Eridani. 
The principal star of this system has a proper motion of 4" a year ; and, 
at a distance of 82", there is a double companion, which has the same 
proper motion, while nearly between them is a small star which does 
not move. Professor Hall finds for the parallax of 40 Eridani, 7r = 
0"-223i0"'0208, a result rather smaller than might have been ex- 
pected, but one which he considers worthy of considerable confidence. 

Parallax of 2 2398 (P. M. 2164). — Dr. Lamp, of Kiel, has inves- 
tigated* the annual parallax of this double star, the components of 
which are 8*2 and 8-7 magnitude, according to W. Struve, and for the 
epoch 1832-17, distance 12"-420, and position-angle 1340-37. Later meas- 
ures by Madler,Dembowski, and Engelmann show a change of relative

position, but of such small amount as to defeat any attempt at the de- 
termination of an orbit. The stars have a common proper motion of 
about — 0®’1726 in right ascension and -f 1"'8955 in declination, and this 
peculiarity led to the suspicion of a measurable parallax. The com- 
parison stars used by Dr. Lamp were DM. -fo9o, 1913, and 1919, of 9-4 
and 7-8 magnitude, respectively, and the mean result obtained is 

n = 0"-34 rt0''-034 

The position for 1885 is E. A. = 18**41“-5 ; Decl. = -f- 59° 27'. 

DOUBLE STABS. 

The orbit o/61 Cygni. — Prof. C. F. W. Peters, of Kiel, has published in 
Nos. 2708-9 of the Astronomische Nachrichten an elaborate determination 
of the orbit of the double star 61 Gygni. This, as he remarks, had not 
hitherto been satisfactorly accomplished, although very numerous obser. 
vations have been made, extending over an interval of more than one 
hundred and thirty years, principally on account of the peculiarity that 
the apparent path of the companion star is very nearly rectilinear in 
direction and uniform in amount, seeming to indicate that the apitarent 
motion of the double star is common to both components, and that 
there is no perceptible motion of one with reference to the other. - - - 
The most recent investigation is that of Prof. O. Struve, published in 
the twenty-seventh volume of the Memoirs of the Imperial Academy of 
St. Petersburg, in 1880, which, founded on the observations (carefr.lly 
cleared from systematic errors) made atDorpat and Pulkowa in the fifty 
years from 1828 to 1878, represented them by a circular orbit. This, 
however, proceeded, as Professor Peters points out, on the inadmissible 
assumption that the angular velocity of the star, with regard to the 
center of the circle, was uniform. Before comm^cing the present in- 
vestigation, he reduced all the available observations to a common 
epoch (the beginning of 1850). It soon appeared that it was not pos- 
sible, on account of the Amry small curvature of the path, to obtain an 
elliptic orbit by the application of the ordinary methods. Professor 
Peters therefore determined in the first place the circular orbit which 
should best represent the observations, and proceeded afterwards to 
deduce an elliptical one. The eccentricity of this ellipse is 0T7, corre- 
sponding to an eccentric angle of 10°, and the semi-major axis 29"-48. 
The period of the companion star in the elliptic orbit thus calculated 
amounts to 782-6 years. If the path be accepted as thus calculated by 
Professor Peters, it becomes possible to determine an approximate 
value of the sum of the masses of the components. This he finds to be 
0-826 or 0-266, in terms of the sun’s mass according as 0"-37 or 0"-54 be 
taken as the parallax of the star. As a mean, therefore, the sum of the 
masses would be equal to about half the mass of the sun, whilst the 
mean distance of the two stars from each other would be about seventy 
times that of the earth, or two and one-third times that of Neptune,

from the sun. It is not possible as yet to draw any conclusion with re- 
gard to the distribution of the whole mass between the components, 
or of the position of the center of gravity of the system. Peters has 
computed from his elements- the following ephemeris :

Double star measures. — INos. 2662-63 and 2677-78 of the Astronomische 


NacliricMen contain a series of measures of double stars made by Herr 
E. Engelmann during the years 1882-’84, preceded by a comparison of 
the differences between the observer’s positions and distances of a num- 


ber of stars, with those measured by Dembowski and Asaph Hall, and 
by other particulars bearing upon his own results. For several of the 


more interesting binaries the following epochs are given :

Another important series of double-star measures will be found in 
Astronomische Nachrichten, 2684-85. They are communicated by M. 
Perrotin, of the Nice Observatory, and are in continuation of the obser 
vations published in Nos. 2529 and 2559-60. 

The series of micrometrical measures of double stars made at the 
Temple Observatory, Eugby, is continued in a “Fourth catalogue,” 
published in volume 48 of the Memoirs of the Eoyal Astronomical So- 
ciety. 

A cause of systematic errors in meas ures of double stars. — M. Bigourdan 
(Bull. Astron., i, 439) has recently pointed out a possible cause of system- 
atic error in observing position angles. In the case of the Secretan 
equatorial of 0™-305 aperture of the Paris Observatory, he finds that 
tbe diffraction-rings surrounding the images of the brighter stars are 
discontinuous ; so that when the objective is turned through 180° round 
its optical axis, as in observing east and west of the meridian, there is 
sufficient difference in the relative appearance of the components of a 
double star to cause systematic errors in the observed position-angles. 
And, in fact, from a series of experiments which M. Bigourdan has car- 
ried out with this instrument, he finds that there are considerable dif- 
ferences in the position-angles measured under the same conditions by 
the same observer, and within a few minutes of each other; so that the 
line joining the stars makes much the same angle with the line joining 
the eyes (always horizontal) in the two cases, one being east of thepier 
and the other west. M. Bigourdan points out that the errors cannot be 
eliminated by determination of personal errors from observations of arti- 


362 


SCIENTIFIC RECCED FOR 1885. 


flcial stars, since in these latter measures the stars alone are moved, 
and not the objective.. It would be desirable, then, for observers who 
possess telescopes mounted in what is geherally known as the “ German” 
manner, and having such a defect as is described by M, Bigourdan, to 
have the tube of the telescope made movable round its optical axis, 
and to form each measure of position-angle from the mean of six made 
in six positions of the objective differing by 60°. As this would be 
practically impossible in the case of large instruments, M. Bigourdan 
suggests that observers, commencing a series of observations of double 
stars with telescopes of any considerable size, should turn the objective 
through C0° at the commencement of each year and re measure the same 
pairs as in the preceding year, and to continue this process until each 
pair has been measured in the six positions of the objective. {Observa- 
tory, Maxch, 1885.) 

Procyon . — In the Vierteljahrsschrift for 1884, Herr Seeliger reviews a 
work on Procyon by L. Struve. The work is a discussion of two series 
of observations of Procyon made at Pulkowa since 1851, and has ap- 
appeared in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences at St. Petersburg. 
It is hard to tell whether these observations confirm Dr. Auwers’ result 
(a circular orbit with a radius of l^'-OO) ; they appear, on the whole, to 
indicate motioms of a smaller amplitude. 

/? Cygni, Albireo . — The December number of PAstronomie contains 
an article on this star in which a singular mistake occurs. /? Cygni is 
Flamsteed’s 6 Cygni, and M. Flammarion has been misled by this cir- 
cumstance into identifying it with Bode’s G Cygni, which latter star 
Professor Ball observed for annual parallax a year or two back, and 
found for it a value of about half a second. The star observed by Pro- 
fessor Ball is called 6 (B) Cygni, as being the second of the pair, 6 
Cygni being a double star. {Observatory.) 

VARIABLE, NEW, OR TEMPORARY STARS. 

Gore's catalogue of suspected variables. * — This catalogue may be re- 
garded as complemental to the Catalogue of Known Variable Stars, by 
the same author, which was read before the Eoyal Irish Academy, Jan-

stars in which some change of magnitude is suspected. The stars are 
tabulated in order of Right Ascension for the epoch 1880'0, and in sep- 
arate columns are to be found particulars of the supposed change of 
magnitude and the authority on which the supposed change rests. In 
the notes and observations, by which the catalogue is followed, are 
given i)articulars of the history of each star, together with observations 
by the author of such stars as have received attention from him. The

work is accompanied by a map showing the distribution of known and 
suspected variable stars. 

A catalogue of this .character forms a valuable working catalogue for 
the observer’s use. By further .observation suspected variation will in 
some cases be proved to be real, and the stars claim a place in a cata- 
logue of known variables. A claim of this kind might indeed already 
be made in the case of Nos. 234, 455, and 635 of Mr. Gore’s list. It may 
just be mentioned in passing that the place of No. 234, U Canis Minoris 
is incompletely given in the catalogue. Its more exact place for 1880 
is E. A. 7’‘34'“ 49®; Deck, + 8° 39''5. There are other cases in which, 
though the period is as yet indeterminate, the fact of variation and its 
amount may be stated with some confidence. On the other hand, fur- 
ther observation may tend to throw a doubt on the suspicion of change 
in the case of other stars, and, as our author observes, “ these must of 
course be removed from future catalogues.” In the notes to No. 287, of 
his catalogue, a Hydrse, Mr. Gore quotes remarks by Sir John Herschel, 
Dr. Schmidt, and Dr. Gould to the effect that the supposed variability 
of this star may possibly be due to the influence of its ruddy color on the 
estimates of its brightness. Is it not possible that the effect of color on 
estimates of magnitude, as respects different observers, or the same ob- 
.server at different times, has hardly received so much attention as it de- 
.serves? 

Large as is the number of stars included in Mr. Gore’s catalogue, 
further additions might be made to it. Comparing it, for instance, 
with the tables of suspected variables, extracted from Mr. Chandler’s 
unpublished catalogue, by Professor Pickering, and printed in his 
“ Recent observations of variable stars ” in the Proceedings of the 
American Academy, we find some thirty stars which are not included 
in Mr. Gore’s list, and it is probable that others might be found in 
other quarters also. Indeed, the experience of most variable star ob- 
servers would probably suggest the view that cases of slight but dis- 
tinctly recognizable light variation are relatively numerous. 

A word in regard to No. 445 in the catalogue may possibly help to 
avert the chance of a little confusion in the future. This star was en- 
tered as U Bootis in Professor Schbnfield’s first catalogue of variable 
stars, but was rejected by him in his Ziceiter Catalog. There is 
another star called U Bootis by Mr. Baxendell, in a i)aper in the Man- 
chester Lit. and Phil. Soc. Proceedings, vol. 21, No. 11, the place of which, 
brought up to 1880, is R. A. 14^ 48“ 47®; Deck -j- 18° 10’-9. This star 
lias a period of 175’5 days, with a range of magnitude from about 13-5 
at minimum to about 9’2 at maximum. 

In conclusion we commend to the attention of all who are interested 
in the subject of variable stars a work the i>reparation of which must 
have entailed on the author a considerable amount of labor both as

SCIENTIFIC EECOKD FOE 1885. 


New variable in Vulpecula. — Mr. Edwin F. Sawyer has found* that 
the star D M. + 27°, 3890 is an interesting variable of the Aquilse 
type. From a preliminary reduction of the few observations thus far 
obtained a light curve has been formed, indicating strongly that the 
period will not vary much from 4^ days. The approximate limits of 
fluctuation are from 5’5 to 6’7 mag. The star is not in Argelander’s 
Uranometria Nova; in Heis it is 6’0; in Harvard Photometry and the 
Purchmusterung 6*1. It is close to the star 32 Vulpeculte, which has 
been suspected of variability. The position of the new variable for 
1885-0 is: E. A. 20^ 45“ 19®-4; Decl. + 270 42'-3. 

New variable in Cetus. — Mr. Sawyer also reports t a new variable in the 
constellation Cetus. The star was first observed on December 16, 1884, 
and noted as 7th magnitude. On January 10, 1885, it had decreased 
about a magnitude in brightness, and by February 10 it was barely 
visible in a field-glass, or it was of about 9-0 magnitude. An observa- 
tion on March 5, by Mr. Sawyer and Mr. Chandler, with a 6-inch equa- 
torial, made the star of lOJ magnitude. The position for 1855-0 is : 
E. A. 2’' 26“ 45®; Decl. — 13° 47', and the star appears to be identical 
with S. DM. — 13°, 479. {Astron Naohr., 2691.) 

Variability of D M. — 1°,3553. — Dr. Valentiner, director of the Karls- 
ruhe Observatory, has detected a slight variation, of about 0-5 magni- 
tude, in the brightness of this star. 

Variable in Ursa Minor. — Dr. Safarik has carefully observed a star 
given in Professor Pickering’s second list of stars with remarkable spec- 
tra and there noted as variable; and he has found a mean period of 337 
days with the epoch of max. 1883 August 1, epoch of min. 1883 Novem- 
ber 26. The star is red, and gives a banded spectrum. Professor Sa- 
farik has designated it “E Urs® Minoris,” as the first variable known 
to him in the constellation Ursa Minor. 

Observations of variable stars in 1884. — In the Proc. Amer. Aead., vol. 
XX, p. 393, Professor Pickering gives a concise but clear view of the 
progress of observations, in Europe as well as in America, of this inter- 
esting class of objects during the year 1884. The following observers 
have co-operated with Harvard College in this important branch of as- 
tronomical research, viz. Backhouse and Knott in England ; Dun6r, 
Hartwig, Safarik, and Wilsing on the continent of Europe; Eadie, Ha- 
gen, Parkhurst, and Sawyer in the United States. Professor Pickering 
gives a list of about 150 variables which have been observed during the 
year, with the number of nights on which each star was observed by the 
astronomer whose designation is attached to the number. It is hoped 
that observers of variable stars will continue to furnish accounts of their 
work during each year as soon as possible after its close. It is desira- 
ble that these accounts should be received at the Harvard College Ob- 
servatory as early as February 1 of the following year. [Observatory.)

The netc star in the great nehula of Andromeda . — The astronomical 
event that attracted the most widespread attention in the year 1885, or 
perhaps in several years, was the telegraphic announcement, on August 
31, by Dr. Hartwig, of the Dor^jat Observatory, of his discovery, on the 
previous evening, of a new star in the great nebula of Andromeda. 

The following account of this ‘•‘•Nova Andromedae” is taken from a 
paper *read by Prof. Asaph Hall, at the meeting of the Philosophical 
Society of Washington, on Pebruary 13, 1886. Further details of the 
observations must be deferred to another report. 

Dr. Hartwig “ had suspected some change in the nebula as early as the 
20th of August, but bad weather and a lack of instrumental means for 
making the matter certain deferred the announcement until the 31st. 
From the various estimates at that time the star was probably a little 
brighter than the 7th magnitude, or just below the limit of visibility 
to the naked eye. The announcement, of course, turned a host of ob- 
servers to the new star, and many erroneous estimates and statements 
were made. Some observers estimated the brightness far too great, 
and several, on account of errors in the observations, announced that 
the new star was moving with an enormous velocity. It required the 
lapse of a few weeks to clear away and correct all this error. 

“After Dr. Hartwig’s announcement it appeared that several others 
had seen the new star, but for some reason, perhaps want of familiarity 
with this nebula and lack of confidence that a new star had really appeared, 
they did not make a public announcement. Thus the Baroness Pod- 
maniczky, of Eastern Hungary, saw the new star on August 22 or 23 
with a 3J-inch comet-seeker, and called the attention of a visitor to it, 
but they do not seem to have been certain that the object was new. This 
lady looked at the nebula on August 13, and did not see the new star. 
Mr. H. S. Moore, of McKinney, Tex., saw the new star on August 30. 
The circumstances indicate that this is a hona fide observation. A really 
independent discovery was made by Freiherr von Spiessen, of Winkel, 
in Eheingau, who found the new star on August 30. - - - Mr. Isaac 

W. Ward, of Belfast, Ireland, claims that he saw the new star on August 
19, when it was of the magnitude. Finally, Prof. Ludoric Grelly, of 
Eouen, says that he saw the new star on the 17 th of August, and showed 
it to several friends and visitors. On the other hand, Mr. Tempel, of 
Florence, Italy, who has done much work on nebulae, and who is well 
acquainted with the great nebula of Andromeda, says that he is con- 
fident that there was no star in the place of the new one which was 
easily visible in his telescope on the 15th and 16th of August. This 
testimony is important and serves to fix the time of the appearance of the 
nova., or at least the time it became an easy object in telescopes, within 
very narrow limits. This time must have been between the 16th and 
20th of August, 1885. It is probable that the star increased rapidly in 
brightness, since on August 31 it was of the 7th magnitude. It never,

I think, became much brighter, though statements were made early iu 
September that it was of the 2d or 3d magnitude and easily visible to 
the naked eye. Its diminution of brightness began about August 31, 
and has gone on pretty steadily until the present time [February, 
1886]. - - - 

“ At first the position of the new star was confounded with that of the 
bright point of the nebula, and as this mistake added interest to the dis- 
covery it was some time before it could be generally corrected. - - - 
The assumption of any intimate physical connection of the new star with 
the nebula has been given up by Vogel, of Potsdam, and Hasselberg, of 
Pulkowa, who have examined its spectrum. Within the limits of this 
nebula there can be counted from fifteen hundred to two thousand tele- 
scopic stars, and one of these has proved to belong to the class of tempo- 
rary stars, so called, of which we have records of from 20 to 30. What 
causes these stars suddenly to flame out and then to fade gradually away 
we do not know, and, so far as I know, there is hardly a plausible theory. 

“ I firstsaw the new star on September 6, when its magnitude seemed 
to me 7J, and the star had a decidedly ruddy tinge. This color lasted 
but a few weeks, and as the star grew fainter it became of a white 
color. My observations have been continued until February 7 of the 
present year, and probably the star will be visible in the 26-inch refract- 
or after the present moon has passed. It is now very near the limit of 
visibility in our telescope, or of nearly the 16th magnitude. The passage 
from the 7th magnitude to the 16th corresponds to a very great change 
of brightness, since it is the passage from the limit of visibility to the 
naked eye to that in a 26-iuch telescope. Several hypotheses were pro- 
posed to account for this wonderful star, and one that seemed to me quite 
ingenious is that of Mr. Monck, of Ireland, who assumed that this star is 
one of the swiftly-moving ones that in rushing through the nebula had 
been set on fire, like a meteor in our atmosphere. Led by some such 
suggestion, and also by that of Professor Peters that it would be inter- 
esting to test the parallax of such a star, on September 29 I began some 
measures of the new star by referring it by means of polar co-ordinates 
to a known star of the 11th magnitude, distant from it a little less than 
2k - - - I do not think my measures show any proof of a parallax, 

though they indicate, perhaps, a diminution of the distance, and even 
this may be sufiiciently accounted for by variations in the light and 
color of the new star, since such variations would be likely to affect the 
measures. - - - 

“ The great nebula of Andromeda is easily visible to the naked eye, 
and doubtless it was known to the astronomers of very ancient times. 
Those astronomers watched the heavens with unaided vision much 
more carefully than do modern astronomers, and they were far better 
acquainted with the constellations. The old astronomers had a theory 
that this nebula was variable both in form and brightness. They had 
poor means of judging of its form, but it is possible that their esti-

mate of briglituess may be more trustworthy, and that our new star may 
be an old variable which has api)eared before, causing the nebula ap- 
parently to vary in brightness.” - - - 

The neic star near x' Orionis.~Mx. J. E. Gore, of Beltra, Ballysadare, 
Ireland, discovered on December 13 a reddish star of about the Cth 
magnitude, following x' (51) Orionis by about a minute and a half of 
time, nearly in the same parallel. Drs. Copeland and Becker observed 
it at Dun Echt on the 16th, and found it to be of the magnitude and 
of an orange-red color. They remark : “ It has a very beautiful banded 
spectrum of the third type, seven dark bands being readily distin- 
guished with the ijrism; the bright intervals seem full of bright lines, 
especially in the green and blue.” M. C. Wolf has also examined the 
spectrum of this remarkable star at the Paris Observatory ; he finds it 
to be of a totally different character from those of the stars which un- 
derwent such great outbursts of brilliancy in the constellations Corona 
and Cygnusin the years 1866 and 1876, respectively, and presenting, in 
fact, a great similarity to the spectrum of that extraordinarily variable 
star known as Mira or o Ceti. 

SPECTEA OE STAES. 

Stars with spectra of the third type . — ‘‘Professor Duner has published 
an important catalogue of stars having banded spectra. Following 
Professor Yogel’s classification, he prefers to regard the spectra with 
bands fading away towards the violet as a subdivision of the same type 
as those in which the bands fade away towards the red, rather than, 
with Secchi, to make them into a separate class. Duner’s type III a, 
therefore, corresp<jnds to Secchi’s third type, and his III h to Secchi’s 
fourth type. Professor Duner’s purpose in forming this catalogue is to 
supply the means for future observers to detect changes in these Sj)ectra, 
should any such occur, for, as he points out, these stars are probably in 
a very advanced state of development, and we may therefore, perhaps, 
hope to discover some day changes in their spectra, which, carefully 
studied, may lead to important results as to the nature of suns. They 
are the more interesting, also, because variable stars of long period 
usually belong to this class. 

“With this view Professor Dnndr has carefully examined all the known 
objects of this type which are visible in his latitude, and for which the 
oi>tical means at his command were sufficient, and he has catalogued 
297 stars of type III a — that is, with bands shading off towards the red — 
and 55 of type III b, with bands shading off in the opposite direction. 
An important section follows, giving a list of stars which different as 
tronomers have regarded as belonging to the third class, but which 
Dun6r cannot so classify. Only in a very few instances, however, is 
there any good reason to suspect a change in the s|)ectrum. In the 
great majority Secchi, whose observations supply most of these cases of 


368

discrepaucy, had himself at oue time or another registered the star as 
being of the second type, i. e., without bands, or else had especially re- 
marked on the extreme feebleness of the bands which he thought he 
saw. There are, however, three stars observed by D’ Arrest for which 
the evidence of change seems stronger, viz, Lai. 24034, D M. + 60°, 
1461, and D M. + 36°, 2772. Professor Dun6r has also failed to find 
Schjellerup 249, which is, perhaps, a long period variable, and he draws 
special attention to R Andromedm, a star the spectrum of which, 
though of type III a, presents some very marked peculiarities. Great 
care has been taken in the determination of the position of the bands in 
the different spectra. It is clear, as many spectroscopists have already 
observed, that the bands of type III a occupy the same positions in all 
the spectra of the type, and the same is true for the bands of type III 
h. With regard to the former class, the sharp dark edges on the more 
refrangible sides of the bands generally coincide with strong metallic 
lines. Thus one of the most prominent bands is terminated by the 6 
lines of magnesium. The nature of the connection between the bands 
and these metallic lines is not at all clear at present, the symmetrical ar- 
rangement of the bands seeming to suggest that they are due to some 
one substance rather than to several. The three principal bands of the 
spectra of the other type Professor Dan6r considers to be unmistakably 
those of a carbon compound, and to correspond to the bright bands so 
familiar in the spectra of comets. The determinations of tbe wave- 
lengths of the bands in spectra of this type are necessarily not quite so 
accurate as those of the bands in spectra of type III a, but if Professor 
D undr’s measures are accepted, this most important correspondence 
may be considered fully established. But apart from the value of these 
measures. Professor Dundr’s catalogue, with the full,^and clear descrip- 
tions he has appended to every star, will be of the utmost service to 
future observers of these interesting and beautiful objects.” {Observa- 
tory, November, 1885.) 

Bright lines in stellar spectra . — “ Mr. O. T. Sherman has continued his 
researches on the spectra of y Oassiopeim and /? Lyrrn, and announces in 
the American Journal of Science for December the discovery of no fewer 
than fifteen bright lines in the spectrum of the former star and seventeen 
in that of the latter. Tbe lines seen in y Cassiopeise are as follows : Ho', 
A 6356, 6160, D3, A 5840, 5557-6, 5422, 5309-8, 5167-5, 4990, H/S, A 4623, 
Hy, A 4180, and Hd, bright lines; and A 6280, 5760, 5020, 4920, 4673-5, 
and 3993, dark lines. The bright lines agree closely in position with 
the principal lines observed by Professor Young in the spectrum of the 
chromosphere. Mr. Sherman has also examined a large number of 
other stars, and Hn each case many or few bright lines have been seen, 
lines, so far as I know, formerly unsuspected.’ It is clear, if Mr. Sher- 
man’s observations can be satisfactorily confirmed, that we have here 
a most important discovery ; but, looking to the fact that these stars

have probably been frequently observed by experienced spectroscopists 
without any bright lines being detected in them, whilst a false appear- 
ance of bright lines is readily produced in stellar spectra under certain 
circumstances, it would appear -hazardous to accept Mr. Sherman’s re- 
sult without further evidence.” {Nature, December 17, 1885.) 

Periodic variations in the spectrum of fi Herr von Gothard re- 

ported last year {Bull. Astron., i, p. 211) the appearance of the brilliant 
lines, which had not been seen for some time, in the spectra of y Cassi- 
opeise and /? Lyrse. During the year he has been able to prove the 
periodic variability of the line D3 in the spectrum of ft Lyrse. The period 
seems to be very short, and is probably about 7 days. The hydrogen 
lines vary also, but their variation is less pronounced. The spectrum of 
y Cassiopeiae also offers some indications of analogous variations. 

PROPER MOTION OF STARS. 

Stars in rapid motion.— The small value of the parallax of 40 0 ^ Eridani 
{Science, vi, 358), combined with its large proper motion (4"-10), brings 
it into i)romiuence as the third or fourth of the stars moving rapidly 
across our line of sight. Since a list of these stars seldom appears in 
works on popular astronomy, we give below the proper motions y, the 
parallaxes tt, and the resulting velocities v, in miles per second across our 
line of sight, of the eight stars which head the list in the order of veloci- 
ties. The method of deriving the velocities is of course very simple. 
If a star’s annual proper motion equals its parallax, it moves across our 
line of sight each year a distance equal to the semi major axis of the 
earth’s orbit. (How much it moves to or from us can only be told by 
the spectroscope.) Therefore, since this motion increases directly as y, 
and inversely as ar, we have for the annual motion across the line of 
sight — 

vt = ai^ 

7t 

or, calling a 92.5 million miles, and t the number of seconds in a year, 
we have for the velocity in miles per second — 

^; = 2'93i^ 
n 

Of courlse, the proper motions below are much more accurately known 
than the parallaxes, and where the latter are small the values of v are 
correspondingly uncertain. The authorities for the adopted values of n 
are given in the column following them. In the case of 40 Eridani, 
vie have weighted Gill and Hall 2 and 1 respectively, as the former de- 
termination was made under much the more favorable conditions, and 
rests upon two comparison stars. The latest values of Hall and Ball 
for 61 Cygni are practically identical. The probable errors of all the 
values of n are generally less than 0"-02.

The first will be recognized as Newcomb’s “ runaway star,” so graph- 
ically described in his Popular Astronomy; but it will be seen that the 
others have velocities which are at least comparable with that of Groom- 
bridge 1830, and indicate momenta that represent vast amounts of 
energy. The discovery of huge suns like our own rushing through 
space with these great velocities is a matter of more than usual interest 
just now, from the fact that Mr. Denning’s claimed discovery of fixed 
meteor -radiants has raised the question as to the possible existence of 
broad swiftly flying streams of meteorites in interstellar space, moving 
with velocities entirely beyond the control of our ‘sun, and so broad 
that it takes the solar system some years to pass through them. (An 
annual parallax of 1° in a meteor-radiant corresponds to a velocity of 
over 1,000 miles per second for the meteor stream.) The idea of such 
streams moving with such velocities is a startling one, and, if shown to 
be true, gives a very vivid idea of the forces acting, or which have 
acted, in stellar space. It seems at first highly imiorobable that such 
can be the case, but with the hard facts of Groombridge 1830 and these 
other swiftly flying suns staring us in the face, the idea is worth con- 
sidering, at any rate. If these suns are the products of condensation 
due to central attraction, so that the luminous energy by which they 
reveal themselves to us was once energy of translation, it is no violent 
assumption to suppose that some of their constituent parts were once 
moving with much greater velocities than that of the present whole. 
In fact, the man who should claim as a possibility that space contains 
broad belts of small particles moving with velocities which are the result- 
ant of all the forces acting on them since primeval chaos, and which have 
not yet been gathered into the control of any of the stellar systems among 
which they are sweeping, would find much to confirm his ideas in these 
giant swiftly flying suns. The question is certainly of sufficient interest 
and importance to call for a thorough overhauling of the present methods 
of determining meteor-radiants, for i^robably most astronomers would 
to day be disposed to deny in toto the existence of the greater part of 
these so-called radiant-points.” (H. M. Paul, Science, November 27, 1885.) 

Star with large proper motion in Sculptor. — Dr. Gould has noticed a 
case of large proper motion in a star in Sculptor, barely of the 8th mag-

iiitude (E. A.=23‘‘ 58“, Decl. = — 37° 58'). It appears to have a proper 
motion of + 0»-482 and — 2"*45, or 6"-21 in the arc of a great circle. 
This motion is only less than that of Groombridge 1830 (7"’03), and that 
of Lacaille 9352 (6" -96), which precedes the star in question by 1** and is 
upon nearly the same parallel. The star is numbered 1584 in Hour xxiii 
of the Cordoba Zone-Catalogue. 

Proper motion of Lalande 16616. — Professor Prisby has found* a proper 
motion of— 0®'00920 zt 0®-0013,in right ascension and — 0"’3619 =t 0"-0048 
in declination for this star, from observations of Lalande, Argelander, 
Robinson, and Washington transit-circle observations in the years 1851 
and 1882. 

A large proper motion has been detected by Herr Berberich in 11 le 
star Weisse X 1021 ; and Professor Porter has called attention to proi)er 
motions in the stars Lalande 20959 and 24423. 

Proper motions in the Pleiades. — Professor Pritchard has published in 
the forty eighth volume of the Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical So- 
ciety a paper of some 50 pages, “ On the relative proper motions of 
forty stars in the Pleiades, determined from micrometric and merid 
ional observations.” 

Motions of stars in the Ime of sight. — “ For the past ten years the Royal 
Observatory of Greenwich has been assiduously observing the spectra 
of more than 50 of the brightest stars, for the purpose of determin 
ing the velocity of their motions toward or from the earth in the ‘ line 
of sight’ — the line joining the earth and star. The reports of tbe 
astronomer royal have given the annual results, but no general exhibi- 
tion of the present state of the question has been made until lately, 
when Mr. Maunder, the observer, has collected them in an interesting 
paper in the Observatory. Mr. Maunder points out, in the first place, 
that the conclusions which are drawn are worthy of confidence in spite 
of the extremely small displacements of the spectral lines upon which 
they depend. The entirely independent researches at Greenwich and 
those of Dr. Huggins and Dr. Vogel mutually confirm each other; and, 
moreover, if the method is applied to the measurement of the difference 
between the velocity of approach of the two limbs (edges) of the sun or 
Jupiter, the results are consistent with what we know of the rotation- 
times of these two bodies. We can compute exactly how fast one limb 
of the sun is approaching us, and how fast the opposite limb is moving 
away; and these same quantities can be determined bj" the spectro- 
scopic methods with substantially the same results. Hence the spec- 
troscopic determinations of the velocity of a body in the line of siglit 
may be fairly said to belong to exact astronomy. The directions and 
the velocities for some fifty stars have been thus determined at Green- 
wich by measures extending over several years. Velocities of thirty 
to forty miles per second are not uncommon. A velocity of less than, 
ten miles corresponds to such a small displacement that its determina-

a 7 2 

tion becomes difficult. Tbe case of Sirius is an interesting one, from 
the fact that its motion has changed from a recession of 21 miles per 
second in 1875-’76 to an approach of 21 miles per second in 1884. The 
proof is very clear, the separate years giving: 


1876 21 miles per second; recession 

1877 23 miles per second; recession 

1879 15 miles per second; recession 

1880 11 miles per second; recession 

1881 ; 2 miles per second ; recession 

1882 . 5 miles per second ; approach 

1883 19 miles per second ; approach 

1884. 21 miles per second; approach 


But the interest of this research is not in accumulating data as to the 
motion of individual stars, however important this may be. The real 
point is, what light does this method throw upon the theory that the 
sun, with the whole solar system, is moving toward the constellation 
Hercules at a rate of some 590,000,000 miles per annum ? Attempts 
* have been previously made to show that the spectroscopic data conlirm 
the theory, which, indeed, has a fairly Arm basis on other grounds. 
Mr. Maunder declares that these attempts are premature, and that the 
spectroscopic data are as yet insufficient. So far as they go, they rather 
indicate a motion toward a Aquarii. ‘Still, if the sun’s speed be 
small compared with the average speed of the stars observed, there is 
nothing in the observations incompatible with the generally accepted 
direction.’ Mr. Maunder points out the fact that Greenwich Observa- 
tory is the only observatory prosecuting these researches, which demand 
a refined spectroscope, a large telescope, and a very clear and quiet 
atmosphere — conditions all lacking at the Eoyal Observatory. He ex- 
presses the hope that the observatories of Nice and Melbourne may de- 
vote their large telescopes to this work. In America we have several 
large refractors admirably suited for the work, and it is to be hoped 
that some of them may be exclusively devoted to it.” (Nation, June 
11, 1885.) 

PHOTOMETRY. 

Standards of stellar magnitudes . — The third report of the American 
committee on standards of stellar magnitudes states that the zones fol- 
lowing the twenty-four selected equatorial stars have received a second 
careful revision with the Princeton 23-inch, which should make them 
include all stars down to about 16-0 magnitude, and that a revision will 
probably be made with the Washington 26 -inch. Pour of the charts have 
been distributed to all observatories having large telescopes, with re- 
quests for all visible additions which will furnish comparisons of the pen- 
etrating power of different kinds of telescopes. Certain selected stand- 
ards in each zone, about 0-5 magnitude apart, have been measured at the 
Harvard College Observatory with photometer I, and the two brightest, 
if not too faint, with the meridian -photometer. A catalogue of these

Harvard Photometry. — M. Th.Wolff, of the Bonn Observatory, reviews at 
considerable length (40 pages) the last volume oit\\e>Annah of the Harvard 
College Observatory, -which contains the photometric investigations of Pro- 
fessor Pickering and his assistants. M. Wolff has submitted the work 
of the American astronomers to a minute examination and has estab- 
lished very interesting relations between the results of the Harvard Col- 
lege meridian photometer and the results of his own work with a Zoell- 
uer photometer. With the latter photometer the observed star is com- 
pared with an artificial star, while with the meridian photometer the 
observed star is compared with Polaris. The two images, one formed by 
the ordinary and the other by the extraordinary ray of the respective 
stars, meet in a double image prism and are observed across a Nicol 
prism. As a check on the work, Polaris was often compared with itself. 
The magnitudes obtained vary from 1’4 to 2'7, the mean of 630 deter- 
minations being 1‘90 instead of 2-0, the magnitude adopted for Polaris.* 
This discerpancy is inexplicable. The mean of the differences between 
Professor Pickering’s catalogue and M. WoM’s two catalogues is ± 
OTl magnitudes, or for the logarithm of the intensity ± 0-044. It is a 
matter for regret that Professor Pickering did not publish the rela- 
tive intensities that were the direct results of observation, but pre- 
ferred to give the magnitudes computed by Pogson’s formula, with the 
constant 0-4. M. Wolff’ very justly remarks that this constant, deter- 
mined by the observation of telescopic .stars, cannot apply to stars of 
the first six classes; he finds that to establish an agreement with Ar- 
gelander this constant must be reduced to 0-37, or even to 0-33. Pro- 
fessor Pickering has endeavored to make his work agree with Arge- 
lander’s by adding -f 0-27 to all his results; but this reduction has 
altered the discrepancies without doing away with them. By reducing 
the numbers published by Professor Pickering back to the logarithms of 
intensity from which they were derived, and comparing these results 
with his own, M. Wolff finds the following mean result : 

W- Wo = 0-84 (P- Po), 

which would indicate the existence of an unexpectedly large personal 
equation. {Bull. Astron., August, 1885.)

aud freedom from liability of derangement. In addition to these qual- 
ities, Professor Pritchard has been careful, in his use of it, to free it 
from systematic errors arising from the continual use of the same part 
of the wedge for the same star. Not only has the coefficient of absorp- 
tion been seijarately determined for every point of the wedge, but the 
system of observation adopted has involved the employment of four dif- 
ferent apertures of telescope in conjunction with two wedges, aud by 
two different observers. Each determination of magnitude, therefore, 
is the mean of twenty observations, a set of five observations being taken 
with each of what are practically four different instruments. When to 
this is added the circumstance that the determinations of magnitude are 
differential only, and that therefore three complete sets of extinctions 
were made of the standard star Polaris every evening, aud that for the 
better determination of the atmospheric absorption and of the magni- 
tudes of southern stars a considerable portion of the observations were 
made at Cairo, it becomes evident that the work of determining the 
magnitudes of nearly 3,000 stars which Professor Pritchard, with his 
assistants, Messrs. Plummer aud Jenkins, has here accomplished, is one 
of very considerable dimensions indeed. 

“The convenience of Professor Pritchard’s photometer, and the magni 
tilde of the work he has undertaken with it, stand beyond dispute; but 
the delicacy of the wedge is another question. And here we are met 
with the circumstance that the observations seem to show little or no 
evidence of any effect due to changes in the sensitiveness of the ob- 
server’s eye, to personality, to moonlight, and only to a small extent to 
color in the star observed ; and this unexpected and remarkable result 
has called forth not a little criticism, for as the construction of this 
photometer is not such as to lead us to expect that it would be wholly 
free from errors of these kinds, a doubt seems to be thrown upon its 
sensitiveness. Professor Pritchard has replied to these criticisms in 
the frankest manner, showing that they had not escaped his notice; 
but whether he has quite refuted them is a point which we may, how- 
ever, well think still sub judice. Probably the wise arrangement by 
which an ordinarj^ evening’s work is confined to three hours or less 
will largely explain the absence of deviations due to the first-named 
cause, and with regard to the third it is most likely that observations on 
bright moonlight nights or of stars near the moon have been gener- 
ally avoided. The observations of Polaris which Professor Pritchard 
has brought forward in this connection scarcely touch the real diffi- 
culty. The substantial accuracy of the Oxford star magnitudes is, how- 
ever, shown by the close agreement which they bear to determinations 
made at other observatories and by widely different methods, and it is 
possible that the future may show that the exceedingly small devia- 
tions of the individual observations are a true index of the minuteness 
of their errors.” (E. W. Maunder, Observatory.)

Photometric observations at Potsdam . — Professor Safarik lias made 
quite au extended analysis of Dr. Muller’s Photometric Researches, wliich 
have appeared in the Publications of the Potsdam Observatory (1883). 
These researches have been carried on since 1877, their object being the 
study of atmospheric extinction and of the relative brightness of the 
planets and of a series of variable stars. The instrument employed 
by Dr. Muller is a Zoelluer photometer, with an aperture of 0’037 me- 
ter. The aperture of the objective maybe reduced by diaphragms; 
it seems, however, that the effect of the diaphragms does not always 
correspond to the expectations based upon the diminution of tlie aper- 
ture. Professor Safarik thinks the cause of this disagreement must be 
sought in the employment of a magnifying power that is much too low, 
so that the resulting ocular ring is larger than the aperture of the pupil 
of the eye. This photometer is not suitable for colorimetric researches. 

Dr. Miiller’s observations relative to atmospheric extinction have 
consisted in comparing the five following stars, which can be observed 
at widely different zenith distances, with Polaris : a Cygni, rj Drs® 
Majoris, d Persei, a Aurig®, and a Tauri. Curves have been traced rep- 
resenting the logarithmic intensities as a function of the zenith distance. 
These curves show no indication of variability for the six stars in ques- 
tion, unless it be in the case of a Tauri. It is a curious fact that the 
white stars do not become quite as much fainter in the neighborhood of 
the horizon as the red stars do. This is probably due to some physiolog- 
ical cause. We give here some of the values finally adopted for reduc- 
tion to the zenith (the numbers given are the logarithms) :

Four units in the first decimal place being equivalent to one magni- 
tude, we see that for Z. D.=80°, 86°, 88°, the reduction represents 1, 2, 
and 3 magnitudes lespectively. Dr. Milller’s carves offer as a whole a 
very satisfactory agreement with those of Seidel, in spite of the differ- 
ence of climate between Potsdam and Munich, and in si)ite of the dif- 
terent processes employed in the two observations. Dr. Muller finds the 
mean value 0-8250 for the fraction of a star’s light that comes through 
our atmosphere when the star is seen in the zenith ; the atmosphere 
then absorbs a little more than Jr of the light. The coefficient of extinc- 
tion should thus be 0-8250 (0-21 magnitude); Seidel found it to be equal 
to 0-100 (0-25 magnitude). Professor Safarik speaks in conclusion of 
the recent work done by Wolf, and Langley.” {Bull, Astron., Septem- 
ber, 1885.)

SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1885. 


Photometry of the Pleiades. — “A valuable memoir {Memoires de VAca- 
demie Imperiale des Sciences de St. Petersbourg, VII «ene, tome xxxii, 
No. 6), by Herr Ed. Lindemann, of Pulkowa, ‘ On the magnitudes of Bes- 
sel’s stars in the Pleiades,’ has recently reached us. A special point of 
interest lies in the fact that Professors Pickering and Pritchard have like- 
wise determined the brightness of many of these stars with their respect- 
ive i)hotometers, each assuming the magnitude of Merope,to which the 
other stars of the group are referred, as 4-22. Herr Lindemann has also 
adopted the same magnitude for Merope, which he has used as his stand- 
ard star. He also employed, as reference stars, Celmno and Anon. 32, the 
magnitudes of which he had determined to be 5’27 and 6'51, respectively. 
The stars, fifty-two in number, were each observed on two separate 
nights, only one star of the fifty-three observed by Bessel proving too 
faint for Herr Lindemann’s telescope of five inches aperture. Compar- 
ing his own results with those of Professors Pickering and Pritchard, 
Herr Lindemann finds, on the whole, a very gratifying agreement; 
twenty-five stars observed by Professor Pickering showing a mean ex- 
cess over the Pulkowa observations of 0-04 of a magnitude, and thirty- 
three stars observed by Professor Pritchard giving a mean excess of 
0*05. Professor Pritchard’s later observations give a yet smaller differ- 
ence, viz, O'Ol of a magnitude. When it is remembered that the three 
photometers employed— Herr Lindemann using aZoellner photometer — 
differed entirely in principle, construction, and method of employment, 
this close agreement would seem to indicate that each may be relied 
upon with very considerable confidence when the differences of stellar 
magnitude determined by their means are not very great. The stars 
Nos. 1, 4, 21, 31, and 33 would appear to be variable, and possibly two 
others likewise. Pogson’s scale has been employed for the conversion 
of the logarithm of the light of the star into magnitude.” {Nature^ De- 
cember 17, 1.885.) 

Professor Pickering in the Proceedings of the American Society for Psy- 
chical Research has tried to find out from the discussion of a large num- 
ber of observations, whether the knowledge of a catalogue magnitude 
of a star on the part of a recorder exerts through the medium of “ thought- 
transference” any influence upon the independence of the observer’s 
estimate. His conclusion is in the negative. 

ASTRONOMICAL PHOTOGRAPHY. 

Photographic map of the heavens made., with the aid of two objectives, 
by Paul and Prosper Henry. — In their first attempts at stellar photo- 
graphy the Messrs. Henry had especially in view the discovery of some 
rapid means for the construction of their ecliptic charts. As these first 
attempts gave excellent results, M. Mouchez had apparatus constructed 
that was especially adapted to stellar photography ; the mechanical 
part is due to Gautier, the optical part being the work of the Messrs. 
Henry, This new instrument consists of two telescopes in juxtaposi-

tion, each having about the same focal length (3'60 meters), and aper- 
tures of 0*24 meter and 0-34 meter respectively. The latter telescope, 
which serves for the photography, is rendered achromatic for chemical 
rays; the other telescope is used as a pointer in keeping the image of 
the star at exactly the same point of the photographic plate for the 
requisite length of time; the field is about 3°. The Messrs. Henry 
have recently succeeded in obtaining, with an exposure of one hour, a 
very beautiful proof, which has been presented to the Academy by M. 
Mouchez. It represents an expanse of about 5° and shows 2,790 stars 
between the 5th and 14th magnitudes. Such a chart as this one, ob- 
tained in one hour, would have certainly required a number of months 
to prepare by ordinary methods.” {Bull. Astron., June, 1885.) 

Fhotograpliic charts of regions of the Milky Way, hy Paul and Prosper 
Henry., of the Paris Observatory . — “About 5,000 stars between the 
6th and 15th magnitudes can be counted on the plate presented to the 
Academy by M. Mouchez. The plate shows an area of 2° 15' of right 
ascension by 3° of declination, and was obtained by the new photo- 
graphic apparatus described in vol. ii, p. 289, of the Bulletin Astro- 
nomique. In order to avoid confounding flaws in the plate with stars 
three successive exposures of an hour each were made, the telescope 
being moved 5" each time, so that each star is rejiresented by three 
points forming an equilateral triangle, the sides being 5" in length. 

“M. Mouchez estimates that 6,000 similar plates would be required to 
represent the whole sky, and that these would form 1,500 charts of the 
size of the ecliptic charts of the Paris Observatory.” {Bull. Astron., 
August, 1885.) 

Photograph of the star cluster of Perseus . — “ During September, 1884, 
Dr. Lohse took advantage of exceptionally clear nights to attempt some 
star photographs, using the ll-inch refractor belonging to the Potsdam 
Observatory. An exposure of 45 minutes generally sufficed for obtain- 
ing photographs of stars as faint as 10th to 11th magnitude. The finder 
of the telescope was employed as a pointer in correcting the errors due 
to the driving clock; but it would have been better to point the telescope 
directly by means of an eye-piece inserted in the photographic cham- 
ber. Such an arrangement has been invented by Mr. Common. Two 
successive positions of the most brilliant star of the group have always 
been rejiroduced for the purpose of fixing upon the plate the position of 
the apparent parallel. The sensitive plates were furnished by Wratten 
and Wainwright of London. The images were developed by a concen- 
trated solution of oxalate of iron, to which was added potassium bro- 
mide. The development can be hastened by plunging the plates for 
about two minutes into a very weak solution of nitrate of chrysaniline. 

Dr. Lohse has succeeded in this way in photographing a certain num- 
ber of star clusters, and in particular the cluster ^ Persei, which Dr. H. 
C. Vogel studied in 1878. A negative obtained September 24 served 
to identify the stars by micrometer measures, and one obtained Sep-

tember 26 served to determine the magnitudes. The plates showed 
57 stars between the Cth and 11th magnitudes. It is certain that the 
photographic determination of the relative positions of so many stars 
represents a very considerable economy of time, and also guards against 
personal errors. As for the errors of the photograph, they can always 
be detected by the simultaneous reproduction of a squared reticle. Five 
successive exposures of 1™, 4™, 9“’, IG'", 25“, respectively, were made for 
the purpose of determining the magnitudes, the telescope being each 
time moved in declination. Five series of images, each more ntimerous 
than the last, were thus obtained. The photo chemical effect is known 
to be proportional to the intensity of the light and to the lime of the 
exposure; in cases of equally distinct images, therefore, the brightness 
of the stars must be inversely proportional to the time of exposure. 
Dr. Lohse has proceeded upon this principle in determining the rela- 
tive magnitudes of the stars in the cluster of x Persei, employing Dr. 
Vogel’s actinometric data. (It seems tlpat the photographic intensities 
of two successive magnitudes are in the ratio of 1 : 3, while the ratio of 
intensities as seen with the eye is that of 1 : 2-5. ) Photographic magni- 
tudes generally agree well enough with optical magnitudes; still there 
are some exceptions : thus a red star called 8 5 by Dr. Vogel is marked 
10-5 by Dr. Lohse. It would be interesting to apply the same process 
to the actinometric study of variable stars. 

We must not neglect to speak here of the fact that MM. Henry have 
obtained a very beautiful photograph of the star cluster of Perseus 
at the Paris Observatory. They succeeded in locating 509 stars be- 
tween the Gth and 13th magnitudes included within 1° of right ascen- 
sion and l°-5 of declination.” {Bull. Astron., March, 1885.) 

Stellar photography at Har vard College Observatory . — By the aid of the 
Bache fund an important investigation has been undertaken in stellar 
photography. It is found that stars as faint as the Gth magnitude, in 
any part of the sky, can be readily photographed, even without clock- 
work; while near the pole, where the diurnal motion is slower, stars 
as faint as the 14th magnitude may be photographed in like manner. 
These results have much value as a means of determining the relative 
positions and brightness of different stars. Charts of regions five de- 
grees square can also be photographically prepared and enlarged by 
photolithography to the scale of the maps drawn by Cbacornac and 
Peters. The spectra of stars hq;ve all been photographed with much 
success. Stars as faint as the 8th magnitude give photographic spec- 
tra in the jraper prints, from which the lines can be distinctly seen. Mr. 
W. H. Pickering has rendered important aid in this investigation. A 
part of his researches upon the possibility of photographing the solar 
corona, except during an eclipse, was conducted at the Observatory and 
the results published in Science. 

The first stellar iihotographs ever taken were those of a Lyrae, by the 
elder Bond, at the Harvard Observatory, in 1850. In 1857 his sou car-

lied similar investigations much further. At first, however, they were 
unable to obtain clear images of stars of the 2d magnitude, while 
now it is possible to print those of the 14th, or, in other words, to 
transfer to paper an image produced by an object only a hundred-thou- 
sandth part as bright as formerly. Professor Pickering’s researches 
have been carried on with an instrument that he has devised himself, 
in which a Voigtlander portrait lens of 8 inches aperture and 44 inches 
focus has been reground and mounted equatorially. It is driven by 
clockwork, having a Bond spring-governor, controlled electrically by a 
sidereal clock. 

We have already referred (under Nebul®) to the fact that Professor 
Pickering has found upon one of his plates a trace of the nebulae around 
Maia, discovered by the Henrys at Paris. 

Stellar photography at the Cape Observatory . — Upwards of one hundred 
successful photographs have been obtained towards the completion of a 
photographic Durchmusterung of the southern heavens. Each photo- 
graph covers a square of 6° on the side, and shows all stars similar in mag- 
nitude to those of Argelander’s Durchmusterung. The lens employed 
is a “rapid rectilinear lens,” composed of two combinations, having an 
aperture of 6 inches and a focal length of about 62 inches. The exposure 
of each plate is one hour, and the plates are the most sensitive “Paget 
dry plates,” specially made for that purpose. Mr. Finlay, of the Cape 
Observatory, statedatameetingoftheLiverpool Astronomical Society, on 
October 13, 1885, that a 9-inch lens had been ordered and would soon be 
ready. It is proposed to divide the whole southern hemisphere into sixty 
squares, each one overlapping another adjoining it. Two plates are taken 
of each picture, so as to avoid any mistake. The work will take from 
three to four years, and will comprise 1,000 pictures. i\Ir. C. Ray Woods 
has been put in charge of this work, and he intends to continue at the 
Cape the work of photograx)hing the corona, which he lately undertook, 
under Dr. Huggins’ (Jirection, in Switzerland.

sel’s ideas concerning the existence of a repulsive force, has succeeded 
in developing a complete theory concerning the tails of comets; a theory 
which accounts very satisfactorily for most of the observed phenomena. 
M. Bredichin applies the name .syndyname to the parabolic curve in which 
the particles of the tail that have successively left the nucleus under the 
influence of a given repulsive force p, are disposed at the moment of 
observation. The synchrone is the curve in which occur the particles 
that have left the nucleus at the same time under the influence of sev- 
eral forces p, p', ... .

SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1885. 


“The synchronic lines are limited and intersected by the syndynames 
of the edges of the tail. In the case of the Donati comet, Norton found 
these lines to be nearly straight, passing near the nucleus. According 
to Bredichin, the synchrones are rather circles of great radius, the ra- 
dius for each comet increasing and diminishing with the radius vector. 
When the emission of matter is intermittent, the synchronic circles 
signalize the maxima by clear bands converging toward the nucleus. 
The clear bands are really hollow conoids, more or less flattened in the 
direction of the plane of the orbit. 

“In the two memoirs before us, which are taken from the Annals of the 
IVloscow Observatory, M. Bredichin successfully applies his theory to dif- 
ferent comets, of which we iiossess suflflciently accurate drawings, and 
especially to the comet of 1744 and to the Pons-Brooks comet (1884). 
They also contain a reproduction of the refutation of the criticisms of 
]\I. Marcuse.” (Eadau, Bull. Astron., September, 1885.) 

Computation of comet orbits. — In the twentieth volume of the Viertel- 
jalirsschrift der Astronomisclien Gesellschaft (pp. 287-312) will be found 
in full Professor Weiss’s exceedingly interesting report on the present 
state of the computations of the orbits of comets, presented at the meet- 
ing of the Gesellschaft on the 19th of August, 1885. Nature contains 
the following report of this communication : 

“Of the twelve periodical comets returned at different times to their 
perihelion, eight had again been regularly determined by the same cal- 
culators. Of the remaining four, three were removed from our present 
care : Biela’s, which, as was known, had been lost to observation, and the 
comets of Halley and Pons-Brooks, whose next perihelion lay too remote 
in the future. There was consequently but one periodical comet (Bror- 
sen’s) to be taken account of. As to the remaining non returning comets, 
of the 168 which had appeared in this century, forty-one were to be re- 
garded as settled ; twenty-three had their orbits pretty well determined. 
In the case of fifty-eight comets a new calculation 6f the orbit was desir- 
able for various reasons, and in all forty-six had yet to be calculated de- 
finitely. There was, therefore, a wide field of labor open. Professor 
Weiss accordingly sought to commend to the society the establishment 
of a common calculation bureau on the settlement of the questions at 
issue, while the exact detailed treatment of a particular comet should 
in future, as hitherto, be left to the initiative of a single calculator. In 
the discussion following this address, Staatsrath Struve argued against 
the founding of such a bureau on the ground that the comets were of 
too peculiar a nature to accommodate themselves to the methodic treat- 
ment of a calculation bureau.”

(88; 1099-1162.) — It will be remembered that at the time of the total 
eclipseof May 17, 1882, the French, English, and Italian astronomers who 
met at Sohag, Egypt, observed the presence of. a comet near the sun ;

it was photographed by Tacchini and Schuster, and a drawing made 
of its tail by Tr^pied; but the comet was not seen again. It was this 
incident that induced Herr Holetschek to determine the conditions 
that must be fulfilled by the orbit of a comet that remains concealed 
by the sun’s rays during the time that its absolute brightness (deter- 


mined simply by the formula J= 


rV 


is sufficient to admit of its dis- 


covery. 

Herr Holetschek judges from the examples furnished by the comets 
of the last ten years that the magnitude of a comet remaining invisible 
at its perihelion cannot be greater than from 0-06 to 0'12 for an elon- 
gation approaching 15°, certainly not for one of 22-5° (the calculation 
was made for these two elongations). In order that it may remain vis- 
ible in the two branches of its orbit, its orbit must ofter a certain sym- 
metry in reference to the earth’s radius vector ; the heliocentric latitude 
of the perihelion must then be sufficiently small, and the comet must be 
in conjunction with the sun at the time of its passing its perihelion. 

These results, which are not at all rigorous, suffice to show that the. 
unobserved perihelion transits of comets may not be as infrequent as 
would have been supposed. We know of periodic comets whose re- 
turns sometimes elude observation. But there are others which would 
have always remained unknown if their transit had occurred at any 
other time of the year; such, for example, is the comet of 1821 (g=0.09, 
i=106°). The Sohag comet belongs very probably in the same cate- 
gory as this last; its perihelion distance must have been very small. 
(Eadau, Bull. Astron., 1885.) 


Oalle's supplementary list of recent comets. — Dr. J. G. Galle, the emi- 
nent director of the Breslau Observatory, has communicated to the 
Nachrichten* (Nos. 2665 and 2666)t a most valuable summary of the 
orbit elements of comets from 1860 to 1864, with a similar list of newly 
computed orbits of comets earlier than 1860. Brief notes generally re- 
lating to the discovery and period of visibility of the comet, and to the 
elements given, accompany each orbit. 

Dr. Galle’s paper has been reprinted in Sirius, vol. 18, and a transla- 
tion of the portion relating to comets since 1860 has appeared in the 
Sidereal Messenger (vols. 4 and 5). The present list is supplementary to 
the catalogue given in the third edition of “ Gibers’ Methode zur Be- 
rechnuug der Cometenbahnen,” so that taken in connection with the 
latter it forms the most complete catalogue of comets that is now 
available. At the end of the year 1884 the number of different comets 
of which orbits have been computed was 302. The number of appari-

tions of comets, iucludiog tbe present recorded returns of periodic 
comets, is considerably greater : 

D’Arrest’s comet has been observed 4 times. 

Biela’s comet has been observed 6 times. 

Brorsen’s comet has been observed 5 times. 

Encke’s comet has been observed 23 times. 

Faye’s comet has been observed 6 times. 

Halley’s comet has been observed 7 times. 

Pons’s comet has been observed 2 times. 

Tempel’s (1) comet has been observed 3 times. 

Tempel’s (2) comet has been observed 2 times. 

Tempel’s (3) comet has been observe'd 2 times. 

Tuttle’s comet has been observed 3 times. 

Winnecke’s comet has been observed 4 times. 

Accordingly, 67—12=55 repeated apparitions are to be added, bring- 
ing up to 357 the total of the observed appearances of comets. In this 
summary, of course, no allowance is made for the great uncertainty of 
many of the older orbits, or for the fact that in some cases it is doubt- 
ful whether the same periodic comet has been seen. 

The comets are arranged strictly in the order of their perihelion pas- 
sage. This is a long-established system and one possessing numerous ad- 
vantages ; furthermore, it has lately been made the rule of the Asironom- 
ische Gesellschaft. The uncertainty sometimes existing in the designa- 
tion of particular comets during the year of discovery can always be 
easily removed, for the time being, by the addition of the name of the 
discoverer. Moreover, a strict adherence to this system of numbering 
comets in each year has become necessary of late, partly on account of 
the great number of comets discovered, and partly on account of the con- 
siderable increase of the known periodic comets during the last forty 
years. The actually observed returns of these comets must of course be 
arranged vs^ith the other comets. Since in many cases the periodicity has 
first been established at the second apparition, and in a few cases at the 
third, the exclusion of periodic comets from the list of apparitions of 
each year would frequently cause annoying changes in the designa- 
tions of earlier years. In the publications of the past ten years the 
periodic comets, particularly, have led to a great many differences in 
the designation of comets, an evil which is not merely of a theoretical 
nature, but, for those who often have occasion to refer to the literature 
of comets, is one which carries with it very real and practical incon- 
veniences, frequently necessitating much troublesome comparison of 
observations, or of ephemerides, to decide what comet is really referred 
to. Especially in years in which a great many comets are seen, if the 
names of the discoverers are not given, not only is there great loss of 
time, but besides this mistakes easily occur.

1583 


Comets 0/1883.* — The great comet of 1882 (1882 11), which excited 
so much interest in the latter part of the year 1882, was visible to the 
naked eye till February, 1883, and with the telescope was followed, in 
the southern hemisphere, to the middle of the year, the last accurate 
observation being on May 26, at Cordoba. The comet was seen again 
on June 1 at the same place, but was too faint to admit of a satisfactory 
determination of its position. It was then at a distance of 5-1 fi;om the 
sun and 4-4 from the earth. In addition to this comet, two others were 
visible during the year, 1883 I and 1884 I ; and a comet discovered on 
January 7, 1884, was found to have passed perihelion on December 25, 
1883, and is accordingly catalogued with the comets of the latter year. 
A comet was also reported as Comet c, 1883, on September 11, but it 
proved to be a nebula; and a second comet, with a tail 2° or 3° long, 
was reported as seen before sunrise at Tasmania on the mornings of 
December 25 and 27, 1883. ISlothing more is known of it. Two other 
comets have passed perihelion during the year, but, owing to unfavora- 
ble circumstances, have not been seen — D’ArresCs comet on January 13, 
1883, and Tempel’s comet of 1873, on iSTovember 20. 

Discovered February 23, by W. E. Brooks of 
Phelps, N. Y., and on the same day, a few hours 

later, by Swift, at Eochester. The comet had 

already passed perihelion (on February 18). Its orbit does not resem- 
ble any previously computed, nor does it show any signs of eccentricity. 
The spectrum was of the ordinary three-band type. 

This comet was discovered by Eoss, an amateur 
observer, at Elsternwick, near Melbourne, Australia, 
on January 7, 1884. The spectrum showed faintly 
the three hydro carbon lines. A careful discussion of the orbit has 
lately been made ‘by Mr. Bryant. The observations are few and not 
very satisfactory, and Mr. Bryant finally based his results on Tebbutt’s 
observations alone. Two sets of •elements were derived ; one gave a 
period of eighty-seven years, and the other ninety-four years, but both 
orbits satisfy the observations.

Comets 0/1884. — Of the five comets visible during the year, four were

has just been described as Comet 1883 II. The second discovery was 
by Barnard on July 16, and the third by Wolf, on September 17. To 
these we add Encke’s Comet, 1885 I, detected by Tempel, at Arcetri, on 
December 13, and the Pons-Brooks Comet, which passed perihelion on 
January 25. To complete the list we should mention a suspected comet 
to which some interest is attached : A faint nebulous object was found

SCIENTIFIC EECORD FOR 1885. 


by Spitaler with the 27-inch retractor of the Vienna Observatory, while 
searching for Comet 1858 HI, on the morning of May 26, 1884. A. period 
of almost unexampled bad weather followed, and on June 17 and 18 the 
of nebula was missing, Schulhof seems to think it improbable that this 
was the comet. Brorsen’s Comet, which has a period of about five and 
one-half years, was due at perihelion in September, 1884, but owing to 
its unfavorable situation it seems to have escaped observation. 

A faint telescopic comet was discovered by 
Brooks on September 1, 1883, and it soon proved 
to be a comet which had been discovered origi- 
nally by Pons, at Marseilles, on July 20, 1812 — 
alley’s Comet is another member, having a period 
of about seventy-five years and an aphelion a little beyond the orbit of 
Neptune. Schulhof and Bossert’s careful rediscussion of the observa- 
tions of 1812 had placed the return to perihelion on September 3, 1884, 
whereas perihelion passage was actually found to take place on January 
25. A closer agreement (the error was only of the whole amount) 
could hardly ha ve been expected, considering that the older observa- 
tions extended over barely two months. The corrected elements make 
the period 71-56 Julian years. As the second member of this group to 
return to perihelion, this comet had been looked for with considerable 
interest, and that interest was subsequently increased, when observa- 
tion showed the rapid changes suffered by the head in approaching the 
sun, and the curious fluctuations in the brightness of the nucleus. On 
the evening of September 22 the comet was described as a faint, round 
nebula, with a nucleus of the 12th magnitude. On September 23 the 
nucleus had become as bright as the 8th magnitude. This central mass, 
according to Schiaparelli, was not a point of light, but had an appre- 
ciable diameter, aud an irregular outline. It now diminished quite 
rapidly in brightness, and was noted as the 9th magnitude on Sep- 
tember 29. Another outburst occurred on January 1, 1884, and a care- 
ful series of photometric observations was obtained by Dr. Mueller, of 
Potsdam. The nucleus became as bright as a star of the 7th mag- 
nitude, the change in brightness amounting to more than a magnitude 
in about an hour and a half. The comet was visible to the naked eye 
from November 20 to March 3, and at its brightest, with a tail 6° 
long, it was a fairly conspicuous object in our southwestern sky. The 
spectrum on the 24th and 27th of September showed nothing unusual. 
On January 1 Vogel found a continuous spectrum of considerable inten- 
sity, in which two bright lines were suspected in the yellow. The bands 
were fainter in the nuclens than in the parts immediately surround- 
ing it. Vogel concludes from his observations that in consequence of 
the rapid condensation of the cometary matter into a bright nucleus of 
several seconds in diameter, a considerable increase in temperature 
must have taken place, by which the most refrangible band in the comet’s

spectrum increased so in intensity that it almost equaled the bright- 
ness of the middle band, in the green, and decidedly surpassed the 
band in the yeUow. 

A comet -first seen by Barnard, at Nashville, 
Tenn., on the night of July 16. During the whole 
period of its visibility (to about November 20) it 
remained an inconspicuous object. The changes in brightness, as in 
other comets recently observed, was neither uniform nor consistent 
with the law of reflected light. The comet was found to move in an 
elliptic orbit with a. period of about 5*4 years, the elements bearing a 
very close resemblance to those of De Yico’s lost comet (1844 I), though 
the two do not appear to be identical. The spectrum showed two of 
the cometary bands, the middle one and that in the red ; the third was 
only suspected. This comet perhaps belongs to the fainter class of 
those revolving in a short period, and this year was probably observed 
under somewhat favorable circumstances. Perihelion was passed on 
August 16. 

Comet 1884 III 
= Comet c 1884. 

= Wolf’s Comet. 


Discovered, by Max Wolf, at Heidelberg, on Sep 
tember 17, and independently, with the spectro- 
scope, by Copeland, at Dun Echt, on September 22. 
The last observation appears to have been by Young, at Princeton, on 
April 6, 1885. This comet, like the preceding, was moving in an ellipse 
of short period (6f years), and one of the most interesting facts in con- 
nection with it was the near approach (about 8,000,000 miles) that it 
must have made to Jupiter in May, 1875. It seems not at all improb- 
able that from the perturbations experienced at that time, it was brought 
into its present orbit. Krueger has pointed out that at the returns (con- 
sistent with a period of 6f years) in 1871 and 1878 the comet was unfa- 
vorably situated for observation. In 1864 and again in 1891 the situ- 
ation is favorable, if we can suppose that it follows the same path as 
now. During the whole period of its visibility the comet was an insig- 
nificant object physically. The spectrum as observed at Nice was con- 
tinuous, with the three cometary bands. Perihelion was passed on No- 
vember 17. 


Comets of 1885. — During the year 1885 seven comets have been under 
observation ; two were discovered by Barnard, two by Brooks, and one 
by Fabry, a student at the Paris Observatory. Two of the known pe- 
riodic comets, Enckp’s and Tuttle’s, were exi)ected to return this year 
and, both were found. Two other periodic comets, Tempel’s 1867 II, 
and Tempel-Swift 1869 III, were also expected, and were carefully 
looked for; but they were unfavorably situated, and seem to have 
passed unobserved. A suspicious object, thought to have been Tempel’s 
comet 1867 II, was observed at Geneva in March, but its identity was 
not fully established.

Encke’s comet, at this its twenty-third return, was 
found hy Tempel, at Arcetri, on December 13, 1884, 
close to the place given by Backluud’s ephemeris — a 
faint nebulous mass without any defined nucleus. By the 1st of Febru- 
ary a condensation, situated a little eccentrically, as iji 1881, was seen, 
and by the middle of February the faint trace of a tail was visible. 
Perihelion occurred on March 7. The comet showed quite a bright 
banded spectrum, while the continuous spectrum of the nucleus was 
made out only with considerable difficulty. 


Comet 1885 II :

= Barniird’8 Comet. 


A telegram was received on July 9, at Harvard 
College observatory, from Prof. L. Swift, of 
Kochester, announcing the discovery of a comet by 
Prof. E. E. Barnard on the evening of July 7, at Vanderbilt University, 
Nashville, Tenn. The position given was identical with a nebula. No. 
4301, of HerscheVs General Catalogue, and the announcement dispatches 
were delayed until the fact of the non-identity was established. The 
comet was seen at Cambridge on the night of July 9. On the 11th 
of July, as observed by Charlois, at Nice, it consisted of a nucleus 
of the 105 magnitude, surrounded by a faint, irregular nebulosity 
about 1''5 in diameter. Professor Young, observing with the 23- 
inch refractor at Princeton, describes the comet during July as about 
three quarters of a minute of arc in diameter, somewhat elongated, 
and much condensed in the center, though without any true stellar 
nucleus; no structure of jets or envelopes could be made out. There 
was, however, a faint, slightly fan-shaped tail from 2'-5 to 4' long, di- 
rected at a position angle of about 35°. Professor Young found the 
spectrum almost continuous, the usual cometary bauds being visible 
only as three slight intensifications of brightness upon the uniform 
background. A similar spectrum was observed at Nice. The comet 
appears to have been seen as late as September 2. Several sets of ele- 
ments have been computed ; the iJeculiarity of the orbit, its great peri- 
helion distance, being brought out by all. The perihelion distance, (2'5) 
is greater than in the case of any other comet hitherto computed, except- 
ing the extraordinary one of 1729, which did not approach the sun within 
four times the earth’s mean distance. A conjecture having been ex-_ 
pressed by Faye and Krueger that the orbit might be elliptic, Dr. Lamp 
computed elliptic element, and found a period of eighty-seven hundred 
years, He remarks, however, that owing to the uncertainty in the single 
observations employed, his results can hardly be considered as decisive, 
and the orbit may yet turn out parabolic. The comet passed perihelion 
in the early part of August, the several orbits thus far computed ranging 
in this element from August 1 to 9.

ber 2, describes the comet as of about the 9tb magnitude, with circular 
nebulosity 2' in diameter, some central condensation, and no tail. It 
changed very little from this during the few weeks it was visible. 
According to Dr. H. Oppenheim’s orbit, perihelion was passed on 
August 10, and the comet steadily decreased in brightness from the 
time of discovery. The, nearest approach to the earth seems to have 
been about September 25.

This comet, originally discovered by M6chain in 
1790, and rediscovered by Tuttle in 1858, was found 
at this return by Perrotin and Oharlois at the Nice 
Observatory on August 8, and was observed on each 
of the following days to August 13, by Charlois. 
Owing to the faintness of the comet and its slight 
elevation above the eastern horizon at sunrise, observation was possi- 
ble for only ten or fifteen minutes. M. Oharlois describes the comet 
as a white spot, about 2' in diameter, without any central con- 
densation. On August 10, with exceptionally good atmospheric condi- 
tions, he thought the nebulosity was elongated in the direction of the 
meridian. 

Herr Eahts, of Koenigsberg, has taken up the work of Tischler, and 
has deduced an orbit from the observations of 1853 and 1871-’72, with 
perturbations by Mercury, Venus, the Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, 
and Uranus, to July 11, 1885. He obtains a period of revolution of 
13'7C years, with perihelion passage on September 11, 1885. 


Comet 1885 V :

=Brook8’8 Comet. 


Discovered by Brooks on December 26, 1885, or 
more than three weeks after the two following 

comets. It was also, independently, discovered by 

Barnard on the evening of December 27, making the third comet 
found by Barnard in 1885, and the second by Brooks. It is described 
as circular, about 3' in diameter, equivalent to a star of the 9th mag- 
nitude, and with a strong, eccentrically placed condensation. The 
provisional elements computed by Chandler and Wendell show that the 
comet is growing fainter, having i)assed perihelion on November 29.

Discovered on December 1, 1885, by M. 
Fabry, a student at the Paris Observatory^ 
where he had been engaged for about three 
months in a search for new comets, with the equatorial coud6. At the 
time of discovery the comet presented the aiipearance of a faint round 
nebulosity (12th magnitude) about V in diameter, with a small, central, 
stellar nucleus. On December 9 it was observed to be elongated in the 
position angle of 87°. According to a calculation of its orbit made by 
M. Lebeuf, perihelion passage occurs on April 5, 1886. The distance 
from the Earth decreases till the end of April, when the theoretical 
brightness will be nearly 500 times as great as on the date of dis- 
covery.

SCIENTIFIC EECORD FOK 1885. 


This comet, the second discovered by 
Barnard during the year, was foundin the 
constellation Taurus on December 3, 1885. 
It is described bj' Tempel, on December 10, as somewhat brighter than 
Fabry’s comet, small, about equal to a nebula of class II, with a star- 
like center. Elements and ephemeris thus far published show that the 
comet is increasing in brightness, and that it does not reach perihelion 
till May, 1886. Dr. Oppenheim’s ephemeris places the maximum bril- 
liancy about May 25, nearly 400 times as bright as at discovery j but 
its proximity to the sun at this time will detract considerably from its 
splendor. 

Periodic comets due m 1886. — Of the now somewhat numerous list of 
comets of short period, two will be due at perihelion in the ensuing 
year : (1) The comet Tempel-Swift, or 1869 III, and 1880 IV, which is 
likely to return under circumstances that will render observations im- 
X>racticable, so far at least as a judgment can be formed without actual 
calculation of the perturbations ^ (2) Winnecke’s comet, last observed 
in 1875, its track in the heavens near the perihelion passage in Decem- 
ber, 1880, not allowing of the comet being seen at that return; the per- 
turbations may be very sensible during the present revolution ; neglect- 
ing their effect, the mean motion determined by Professor Oppolzer for 
1880 would bring the comet to perihelion again about August 24-5 
- - - The actual orbit of Winnecke’s comet approaches very near 
to that of the planet Jupiter in heliocentric longitude 110°, at which 
point the comet arrives seven hundred and twenty days, or 1-97 years, 
before perihelion passage ; the distance between the two orbits is then 
less than 0-06 of the earth’s mean distance from the sun. 

It is very possible, however, that the comet which may most interest 
astronomers in 1886 will be that observed in 1815, and known as Gi- 
bers’ comet, which, according to the elaborate calculations of Dr. Gin- 
zel, will again arrive at perihelion in December, 1886. The most prob- 
able date that can be inferred from the observations of 1815, and the 
computation of i)lanetary perturbations in the interval, is December 
16, but unfortunately the observations did not suffice to determine the 
mean motion in 1815 with x)recision, and consequently Ginzel found ibr 
the limits of the i)eriod of revolution 72-33 and 75-68 years; hence the 
comet may reach its perihelion many months earlier or later than the 
date given by calculation. 

Extensive sweeping ex)hemerides have been published, and it may 
not be too soon to direct attention to a search for the comet at the be- 
ginning of the next year, or as soon as the region in which its orbit is 
projected at the time can be advantageously examined. (Nature, Octo- 
ber 29, 1885.) ■ . 

METEORS, AND THE ZODIACAE LIGHT. 

Meteor shower of November 21, 1885. — On the evening of November 27 
there was a remarkable shower of meteors radiating from Andromeda, 


Comet 1886. . . (Barnard) :

= Banard’s Comet.

and presumably connected with Biela’s comet, very nearly two revo- 
lutions of which had elapsed since the previous great appearance of ^ 
these bodies in 1872. 

In Europe and Asia the star shower was very remarkable wherever 
the clouds did not prevent its being seen ; in this country it was nearly 
over before sunset, yet in the early evening the meteors were numerous 
enough to attract very general attention. It would also appear that 
showers of meteors were observed from this stream not only on the night 
of November 27, but also at some places on nights preceding and fol- 
lowing. 

An adequate discussion of the observations can only be made after 
all the reports are in. Tolerably complete summaries of the accounts 
thus far published may be found in del et Terre, vol. 6, pp. 451, 491, and 
Sirius, vol. 19, p. 33. 

“It will be very interesting to notice in 1898 how far the brilliancy 
of the display to which we may then look forward will be affected by 
the comparatively slightly altered position in its orbit of the principal 
aggregation of meteors, which would seem to be a little behind what 
would have been the place of the comet.” 

The zodiacal light . — In October, 1883, Prof. Arthur Searle presented 
to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences a very valuable paper 
on the zodiacal light, in which he had collected and reduced on a uni- 
form system the evening observations of all the principal observers. 
The principal points then brought: out were that in all probability the 
apparent changes in the latitude of the zodiacal light were due mainly, 
if not entirely, to the effect of atmospheric absorption, and that the 
method of observation by drawing outlines must be replaced by care- 
ful photometric observations if definite knowledge was to be substi- 
tuted for the vague information we now possess as to the “ Gegenschein,” 
the “ zodiacal bands,” &c. ; and Professor Searle concluded with the 
suggestion that the ordinary meteoric theory would gain greatly in 
simplicity by the substitution of meteoric dust scattered generallj’ 
throughout the solar system for the meteoric rings that have been 
usually imagined. Professor Searle has continued his investigations 
in a recent memoir, in which he corrects, for the effect of atmos- 
pheric absorption, Jones’s observations of what the latter called the 
“ stronger light,” at the elongation 60°, whether made in the morning 
or evening. The result of the inquiry is to confirm the view arrived at 
previously, that atmospheric absorption largely affects the apparent 
position of the zodiacal light, and Professor Searle again lays stress on 
the need for photometric observations. Professor Searle concludes 
that, after correcting for atmosiiheric absorption, there seems reason to 
think that the zodiacal light has had, during the present half-century, 
a more northern latitude near the longitude 180° than near the longi- 
tude 0°. He also shows, from a careful study of the distribution of the 


390 


SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1885. 


stars in the Durchmusterung, that upon the meteoric theory of the zo- 
diacal light it is to be expected that a continuous zodiacal band should 
be present ; -but the question of its actual visibility is complicated by 
the slight maxima of stellar density which are situated along those 
parts of the ecliptic most readily accessible to observation from stations 
in the northern hemisphere. An interesting result is obtained from 
an examination of the elements of the 237 asteroids first discovered, 
from which it would seem that the belt of sky occupied by the projec- 
tions of the orbits of these asteroids “presents certain peculiarities 
which correspond to those of the zodiacal light, and suggest the hy- 
pothesis that the light may be partly due to minute objects circulating 
in orbits like those of the smaller planets.” (Nature.) 

THE SUN. 

Langley^ s researches on solar heat . — “The results of the work upon 
which Professor Langley has been engaged for the last several years 
have recently been published in a complete form as Yolume xv of the 
Professional Papers of the United States Signal Service. !No work 
more thoroughly aggressive, more calculated to further the progress of 
science and to render it secure, has been undertaken during late years 
than that which Professor Langley has carried out, chiefly by means 
of his ingenious and useful instrument, the bolometer. - - - The 
first chapter contains the preliminary observations made at Allegheny, 
from which Professor Langley deduced the value of the solar constant 
as 2-84 calories, a much larger quantity than that generally accepted 
hitherto. The observations also showed him that, contrary to the gener- 
ally received opinion, absorption occurred in the visible portion of the 
spectrum, particularly in the green and blue, and that it diminished as 
the extreme infra-red was approached, and convinced him that the labor 
and expense involved in repeating the observations at the base and at 
the summit of a lofty mountain would be well repaid by the gain in 
our knowledge. 

“ In July, 1881, therefore, Professor Langley started for Mount Whit- 
ney, a lofty eminence in the Sierra Nevada of Southern California, 
over 14,000 feet in height, which seemed to combine all the needed re- 
quirements. The second chapter gives an interesting account of the 
journey to Mount Whitney. Then follow several chapters of results of 
observations and descriptions of the instruments used. Amongst these 
were a water pyrheliometer after Pouillet’s model, a mercury pyrhe- 
liometer, two globe actinometers, a ‘ solar comparator,’ and the spectro- 
bolometer. In Chapter xiv the amount of the atmosi^heric absorption 
is shown to be about 40 per cent., or double that usually supposed. 
Then follow chapters on ‘ Sky Eadiation,’ ‘Nocturnal Eadiation,’ &c. 
Chapter xxi gives a general summary of the results ; and the most 
probable value of the ‘ solar constant’is given as 3 calories. Three appen- 
dices follow, on the reduction of psychrometer observations, the deter-

mination of wave-lengths in the invisible prisma.tic spectrum, and also 
of the influence of convection currents on thermometer bulbs. The 
work is illustrated by twenty-one plates, mostly the observation curves 
of the different instruments, besides a map of the district of Mount 
Whitney, showing the proposed reservation and a view of the mountain 
camp. 

“ The principal results of Professor Langley’s work may perhaps be 
briefly summarized as follows: He has shown that the invisible spec- 
trum beyond the red extends much further than was imagined or be- 
lieved possible ; he has detected cold spaces in this spectrum analogous 
to the dark absorption bands and lines of the visible spectrum, and 
has determined their wave-lengths. He has shown that all the old 
formula for the determination of wave-lengths in the prismatic spectrum 
failed utterly when carried into the infra-red region. The amount of 
absorption exercised by the atmosphere has been proved to have been 
greatly under-estimated ; it is at least double what has been usually 
supposed, and the value of the ‘ solar constant ’ has been increased in 
consequence. Contrary to the theory hitherto universally held. Pro- 
fessor Langley has shown that the infra-red rays do not suffer the most 
absorption, but the visible rays, and especially those in the green and 
blue, the transmissibility steadily increasing towards the extreme infra- 
red. From this it follows that what we call white light is not ‘ the 
sum of all radiations,’ but that remainder of rays which has been filtered 
down to us, and the sun, could we see it as it is, would appear of a de- 
cided bluish tint. Professor Langley’s observations seem also to indi- 
cate that at a certain point far in the infra-red, transmissibility through 
the atmosphere suddenly ceases, and if would seem to follow that the 
earth heat which fails to be radiated away through the atmosphere 
must be lower than we have yet examined in any spectrum. The old 
idea of a ‘ temperature of space’ is rejected, and reasons are given for 
concluding that the heat we receive from celestial bodies, other than 
the sun, is practically nil. Finally, Professor Langley concludes that 
the temperature of the earth under direct sunshine, even though our 
atmosphere were present as now, would probably fall to 200° C. if that 
atmosphere did not possess the quality of selective absorption. To this 
catalogue of results may be added that the volume before us gives 
abundant evidence of the attention and care which Professor Langley 
has given to free his work from every source of error.” {Observatory., 
September, 1885, p. 309.)

Diameters of the sun and moon as observed with the Greenwich transit 
circle (W. G. Thackery). — The author considers the values of the diam- 
eters of the sun and moon furnished each year by the result of all the 
observations, and also the values resulting each year from the work of 
the individual observers. The following results were found for the sun, 
with which are given the results obtained by Sir G. B. Airy, in a paper 
entitled “On the Circularity of the Sun” [Monthly Notices^ vol. xxil):

The difference in the values of the horizontal diameter is rather sur- 
prising when compared to the identity of the values of the vertical di- 
ameter; but the personal equation must be taken into account in con- 
sidering the observations, the following table showing its importance :

Mr. Thackeray has also considered the observations of the moon’s 
diameter. In this case the personal equation is almost insensible, and 
the correction to the Nautical Almanac is unimportant. 

One result of the preceding discussion is to show that it would be 
proper in reducing incomplete observations of the sun (observations of 
one limb only) not to adopt a uniform value for the diameter, but to 
employ the observer’s own value. {Bull. Astron., August, 1885.) 

List of eclipses. — Dr. Theodore von Oppolzer, of Vienna, announces 
the early publication of a very extended list of the dates of solar and 
lunar eclipses which has been prepared under his direction. There will 
be eight thousand of the former and more than five thousand of the latter 
class of phenomeua, and all included between the years 1207 B. c. and 
2161 A. D. In publishing the hours of the day at which the eclipses 
will occur. Dr. Oppolzer will adopt the new reckoning of astronomical 
time recommended by the International Prime Meridian Conference at 
Washington in 1884, thus making this publication the first astronomical 
work of imijortance in which this method of counting the hours of the 
day is adopted. 

Eclipse of the sun, 1869, August 7. — The report of observations of the 
total eclipse of the sun of August 7, 1869, made by parties under the 
direction of Prof. J. H. C. Coffin, superintendent of the American Ephe- 
raeris and Nautical Almanac, has been published during the year, the 
delay in the appearance of the volume being due to the illness of Pro- 
fessor Coffin. The results of the work of Professors Young, Gould, Pick- 
ering, Morton, and others have already been known through other chan- 
nels, but many valuable details are now given for the first time. Ten 
plates accompany the work, among them some excellent engravings 
from the photographs at totality. 

Eclipse of the sun, 1885, March 16. — This was visible as a partial eclipse 
throughout the United States, and as an “ annular ” eclipse in the north- 
western part; the annulus describing a path about 75 miles wide, across 
IMontana, Idaho, and the northwestern part of California. 

A circular was sent out by the Superintendent of the Naval Observa- 
tory stating that time signals would be sent to observers along this line, 
and requesting that observations of the beginning and ending of the 
eclipse and of the annular phase should be transmitted to the observa- 
tory. Reports wBre received from sixteen observers, and many of these 
reports, together with an account of observations made at the Naval 
Observatory, embracing observations of contact, observations made with 
the transit instrument and transit circle, and results from photographs 
made with the transit of Venus photo-heliograph, are published as Ap- 
endix it to the Washington observations for 1882. 

Observations of contact were made by Professor Peters at Clinton, 
and photographs were taken at the Chicago and Lick Observatories. 
Mr. Charles H. Rockwell observed the annular phase from Delta, Cal,

SCIENTIFIC EECORD FOE 1885. 


Eclipse of the sun, 1885, September 9.— Tlie track of the line of total 
eclipse lay almost wholly in the South Pacific Ocean, the only land on 
which the total phase was observable being the shores of Cook’s Straits, 
New Zealand. The duration of totality was about two minutes at the 
point most favorably located. “ It would appear that no central eclipse 
has traversed these islands during the present century ; an examina- 
tion of the various ephemerides points to the annular eclipse-of Decem- 
ber 29, 1796, as the last whicb was there central. An annular, though 
nearly total, eclipse will take place near the north extremity of the North 
Island on January 3, 1927, while on May 30, 1965, when the sun is 
barely risen to an altitude of 5°, he will be totally eclipsed on the east 
coast of the North Island, near its north extremity, for about 2“ 20®.” 

From the reports we have seen it would appear that many of the 
parties which were organized for the purjjose of observing the expected 
phenomena were seriously interfered with by bad weather. At Taho- 
raite, a point well within the belt of totality but some 40 miles north 
of the central line, Mr. Graydon succeeded in obtaining five sketches 
during totality ; these sketches show five or sixlongrays (besides a large 
number of shorter ones) projecting from the sun’s limb, the longest ray 
being some two or three diameters of that body in length. A dark rift 
was observed in the corona, and near this rift a red flame was noticed 
by some of the bystanders to shoot out just before the end of totality. 
Photographs were obtained at Blenheim, at Masterton and at Nelson ; 
and other observations were made at Wellington, Dryertown, and Pal- 
merston. 

Eclipse of the sun, 1886, August 28-29*. — The eclipse of August 28-29, 
1886, will be total only in the torrid zone, and the path of the total 
phase will fall mainly in the open Atlantic Ocean, but at Benguela, on 
the western coast of South Africa, it will be observable at about 3 
o’clock of local time in the afternoon. It will be remembered that this 
eclipse is of rather more than ordinary interest on account of the long 
duration of totality, 4“ 41®, near Benguela. Another interesting circum- 
stance has been noticed by Dr. Herz, of Tiehna, in the fact that at 
totality two stars, 47 p Leonis and 49 Leonis, are close to the sun, the 
latter within the corona. It is suggested that by means of measure- 
ments upon these two stars, something may be learned in regard to the 
refracting power of this peculiar atmosphere of the sun. A bill is now 
pending before Congress, appropriating $10,000 to enable the Secretary 
of the Navy to fit out an expedition to observe this eclipse. 

Transit of Venus.— 'From Professor Harkness’st report to the president 
of the American Transit of Venus Commission, we make the following 
extract : ' 

At the date of my last annual report experiments were in progress 
to determine whether or not the heliostat mirrors undergo any change

of curvature when exposed to the sun’s rays. As that question is of 
vital imiiortance in the theory of the horizontal photo-heliograph, it 
was thought desirable to make the experiments both in the heat of 
summer and in the cold of winter. The work was completed on Feb- 
ruary 23, 1885. 

‘‘ Mr. Eogers is now engaged in writing an account both of the proc- 
esses employed in preparing and developing the dry collodion emulsion 
plates used with the photo-heliographs in observing the transit of Venus 
in December, 1882, and of the experiments which were executed to de- 
termine thebest method of making pyroxyline for that purpose. When- 
ever photographs are required which must sustain the test of accurate 
measurement, the collodion emulsion process offers advantages so great 
that every effort should be put forth to increase its general availability. 
Some of our recent experiments incidentally tend in that direction, and 
although primarily made to clear up obscure points relating to the tran- 
sit of Venus work, it is hoi)ed they will facilitate the application of collo- 
dion emulsion in future operations requiring the use of photo-helio- 
graphs. In these experiments pyroxyline has been made from flax, jute, 
etc., as well as from cotton, which is the form of cellulose commonly 
preferred. 

“ It will be remembered that wet bromo-iodide plates, made by the 
bath process, were used with the photo-heliographs in observing the 
transit of Venus in December, 1874, and the question naturally arises 
whether or not the negatives then obtained are strictly comparable with 
those made upon dry collodion emulsion during the transit of December, 
1882. For the definite settlenlent of that point recourse was had to 
photographs of the solar spectrum. In June, 1881, a set of such photo- 
graphs was made upon wet bromo-iodide bath plates of the kind used 
in December, 1874, and similar sets are now being made with emulsions 
as nearly as possible in the same condition with respect to age, etc., as 
those actually employed in observing the transit of December, 1882. In 
order to show clearly the progressive action of the solar rays upon the 
silver salts, each set begins with the shortest exposure capable of pro- 
ducing an easily legible impression, and extends to exposures two or 
three hundred times as great. The negatives have not yet been sub- 
jected to critical examination, but the general result seems to be that, 
while marked differences exist in the action of the spectrum upon the 
two classes of plates with the exposures given in the photo-heliographs,, 
the effective rays are of substantially the same wave-length in both. 
The transit plates of 1874 and 1882 are therefore quite comparable in 
this respect, and there is no reason to apprehend systematic differences 
between them depending upon atmospheric dispersion. The spectrum 
photographs have also established the fact that the emulsion plates have 
a degree of sensitiveness not very different from that of bath wet plates.” 

The reduction of observations for time and latitude made at the vari- 
ous United States stations in December, 1882, are now nearly completed

and to a considerable extent prepared for printing. It is expected that 
they will form Part lii of the Transit of Venus Eeports. No progress 
has been made in the reduction of the photographs during the current 
year, and it is not proposed to take them up again until after all the 
manuscript relating to time, latitude, and longitude has been prepared 
for the printer. 

The work of printing Part ii of the Transit of Venus Eeports has re- 
cently been resumed, and will probably be completed at an early date. 
This part will form a volume of about five hundred quarto pages, and 
will contain the records of all observations made at the United States 
stations for observing the transit of 1874, together with the correspond- 
ing reductions and discussions, excepting only those relating to the 
photographs. 

The French photographs of the transit of Venus. — The measurement 
of the seven hundred photographs obtained at the various French sta- 
tions during the transit of Venus, 1882, is about to be commenced. An 
office has been organized for the purpose, the necessary credit has been 
granted, and a measuring instrument belonging to the Meudon Obser- 
vatory and lent by M. Janssen, has been supplied. This will be replaced 
in January, 1886, by a smaller one by the same makers, MM. Brunner 
Fr^res. The measurements, it is expected, will be completed in fifteen 
months. 

Photographic evidence as to the constitution of sun spots. — “M. Janssen, 
remarking on some exquisite photographs of sun spots which he has ob- 
tained during the past year, calls attention to the evidence they supply 
as to the continuation of the granulation of the general solar surface, 
into the spots. A photoglyph of the great spot of 1885, June 22, for 
example, to which he particularly alludes, shows that the bright region 
wljich surrounds the penumbrse of large spots has not a different con- 
stitution from that of the photosphere in general, since it is made up in 
like manner of granular elements, usually of a spherical form. The 
marked increase in brightness of such regions the photographs show to 
be due to the granulations being more thickly clustered, brighter in 
themselves, and arranged on a brighter background. In the penumbra 
tbe granulations are still distinguishable, but they are less luminous 
and more scattered, leaving dark gaps between the rows of grains, the 
familiar striated appearance of the penumbra being due to the arrange- 
ment of the granulations in ranks and lines, like beads on a thread. 
The grains become in general smaller and duller near the nucleus, where 
they seem to dissolve. The same spot presented two very remarkable 
bridges, and a very bright isolated mass of luminous matter which 
united them. This luminous matter and the bridges were also formed 
of granular elements resembling the others. Many other photographs 
have revealed a similar structure in.penumbrse and their surroundings, 
so that it is highly probable that ‘ the luminous matter which forms the

solar surface has everywhere the same constitution.’” [Nature^ Feb- 
ruary 4, 1886.) 

Sun-spot maximum. — The exact epoch of the last sun-spot maximum, 
which for some time remained in uncertainty, has been placed by Wolf 
at 1883-9, and his result has been confirmed* by the observations of 
the past year. The previous maximum was well marked at 1870-6 and, 
with the 11-year period (more exactly 11-1 years) the next was expected 
at 1881-7 or the beginning of 1882 ; and in fact in A])ril, 1882, a “ false” 
maximum did occur, but with the finally established maximum at 1883-9 
we have a retardation of about two years. The interval from the pre- 
ceding maximum is therefore 13.3 years, and from the preceding mini- 
mum of 1879-0, 4-9 years. It is quite remarkable also that the varia- 
tiops of the magnetic needle have shown a similar anomalous fluctua- 
tion. 

The Solar Corona] {a lecture delivered at the Royal Institution, hy Dr. 
Huggins, February 20, 1884). — “After mentioning the various hypotheses 
concerning the nature of the corona (a gaseous atmosphere, tine par- 
ticles ejected by the sun and in motion around the sun caused by several 
forces, one of them being perhaps the repulsive force observed in the 
case of comets, a center of meteoric streams, etc.). Dr. Huggins speaks 
of Dr. Hastings’s new theory, according to which the corona is not a 
reality but simply a phenomenon caused by diffraction. Without dwell- 
ing upon the proof of its reality furnished by photographs made when 
there was no eclipse, and consequently no interventiou^of the moon, Mr. 
Huggins finds that the analysis of the- spectra of different parts of the 
corona and the peculiar structure seen in the photographs taken during 
eclipses contradict Dr. Hastings’s theory. If Dr. Hastings’s theory were 
correct the corona would of necessity change during the course of the 
eclipse and the photographs reveal no change. M. Janssen says : ‘ Les 
formes de la couronne ont 6t6 absolument fixes pendant toute la dur4e 
de la totality.’ 

“ The sun is doubtless surrounded by a gaseous atmosphere of a cer- 
tain extent, but there are a number of reasons why the corona should 
not be regarded as a prolongation of this atmosphere. A gas even a 
hundred or a thousand times lighter than hydrogen at the height of the 
corona would, at the sun’s surface, be heavier than metals, — a state of 
things which spectroscopic and other observations show cannot be the 
true one. The corona does not show either that rapid condensation 
towards the sun which an atmosphere would show, especially if we take 
into account the effect of perspective in increasing the brightness of 
the lower parts of the corona. Moreover, comets have been known to 
pass through the upper part of the corona without losing either matter 
or velocity.

SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1885. 


“ There can be no doubt that the corona shows us matter existing 
about the sun in the form of a fog, of which we may form some idea by 
imagining the air we breathe very much rarefied but still full of par- 
ticles rendered visible by a sun’s ray. The matter of the corona sends 
us three kinds of light : Solar light dispersed by particles of matter, 
either solid or liquid 5 light giving a continuous spectrum, showing that 
the solid or liquid particles are incandescent, and light giving spectra 
of brilliant lines, fainter and varying greatly at different parts of the 
corona and at different eclipses, which must be due to the presence of a 
luminous gas. This gas existing between the particles does not form a 
solar atmosphere in the true sense of the word (such an atmosphere has 
already been shown to be impossible), but this gas may be regarded as 
carried along by the particles ; it is due perhaps to the heat of the sun. 

“ Comets show characteristics which are not without analogy to those 
of the corona; in the case of comets we see reproduced on a small scale 
the luminous streams, the rifts and curved rays.* We do not know 
the conditions under which these cometary appearances occur, but the 
generally accepted hypothesis attributes them to electrical action, and 
especially to a repulsive force acting from the sun, and doubtless an 
electrical force, which varies with the surface, and not, like gravity, 
with the mass. A force of this nature could easily overcome the force 
of gravity, and, as we see in the tails of comets, drive very much rare- 
fied matter to immense distances. Such a rei^ulsive force, if electrical in 
its origin, must act between bodies charged with the same kind of elec- 
tricity, and according to this theory the material of which the corona is 
composed and the surface of the sun must be in the same electrical 
state ; a certain permanence of the same electrical state would seem to 
be required by the j)henomena of the tails of comets; but we are quite 
in ignorance on this subject. 

“ However this may be, it is quite in conformity with the ideas ex- 
pressed above, that the positions of greatest coronal extension should 
usually correspond with the spot zones where the solar activity is great- 
est. A careful investigation of the structure of the corona leads us to 
think also that the forces to which this complicated and variable struct- 
ure is due have tbeir seat in the sun. Matter repelled by the sun 
would participate in the rotary velocity of the photosphere, and lagging 
behind give rise to curved forms. Moreover, the force of the projection 
and the subsequent electrical repulsion might very well vary in direc- 
tion and not be always strictly radial, and this would help to explain 
the character of the corona. The relative permanency of some of the 
coronal forms during several weeks does not imply that the matter is 
immovable ; flames over the mouths of volcanoes often offer a similar 
appearance. If the forces to which the corona is due reside in the 
sun, the corona ought, of course, to revolve with it ; but if the corona is 
produced by causes extraneous to the sun, it may be otherwise.

“ We have seen that the corona probably consists of an iucandescent 
fog, which, at the same time, sends us by reflection the light of the 
photosphere. Now we must remember that there is a great difference 
in the behavior of a gas and of liquid and solid particles in the imme- 
diate vicinity of the sun. A gas need not be greatly heated even when 
near the sun by the radiated energy ; when once heated it would rap- 
idly lose its heat when above the photosphere ; but solid and liquid 
particles, whether carried up as such or having become such by con- 
densation, would absorb the sun’s heat and at the distance of the corona 
would reach a temperature but little inferior to that of the photosphere. 
The gas shown by the spectroscope to exist among the incandescent 
matter of the corona may therefore have been carried there as gas or 
may have been in part distilled from the coronal particles under the 
influence of the enormous solar radiations. There would be no discord- 
ance between this theory and the fact of the very different heights 
at which the brilliant lines in the corona have been observed. Gases 
of unequal densities, unequally repelled by a repulsive force varying as 
the surface, would be to a certain degree separated, the highest gas 
being most influenced by the repulsive force, the heaviest being most 
influenced by gravity. The relative proportions at different heights of 
the corona of the gases, whose presence is shown by the spectroscope, 
vary from time to time and depend in part upon the state of activity of 
the photosphere in such a way as to establish a probable connection with 
the spectrum of the protuberances. (Captain Abney and Professor 
Schuster have recently shown that beside the bright lines already 
known, the spectrum of the corona of 1882 gave the g'roup of the ultra- 
violet lines of hydrogen, which are characteristic of the photographic 
spectra of white stars, and other lines also.) In this view of the corona, 
therefore, we And a new example of such relations as those existing be- 
tween the phenomena of sun spots and magnetic perturbations or au- 
ror®. 

“ Many questions are left unconsidered, this among others, whether the 
light emitted by the gaseous part of the corona is due directly to the 
sun’s heat or to electrical discharges of the nature of the aurora. Fur- 
ther, what becomes of the coronal matter on the theory which has been 
suggested % Is it permanently carried away from the sun as the matter 
of the tails of comets is lost to them ? Electric repulsion can continue 
only so long as the repelled particles remain in the same electrical state. 
If the electrical state changes, the repulsion must cease, and, gravity no 
longer counteracted, the particle must fall back to the sun. In Mr. 
Wesley’s drawings of the corona, especially in those of the eclipse of 
1871, the longer rays or streamers seem not to end but to be lost in the 
fainter parts of the drawing ; but some of the shorter ones seem to turn 
and descend to the sun.* 

* Concerning the nature of the corona consult the papers of Norton, Young, and 
Langley iii the American Journal of Science, The Sun, hy Professor Young, and various 
essays by Mr. R. A. Proctor.

SCIENTIFIC RECCED FOR 1885. 


It is difficult for us living in dense air to conceive of the state of at- 
tenuation probably present in the outer parts of the corona. Mr. Crookes 
has shown by experiment that matter reduced to one-millionth part of 
the density of ordinary air is still possessed of a sufficient number of 
molecules to display a perfect corona when under the influence of an 
electric current. In any case we may hope that our present knowledge 
on the subject will be much increased by the daily photographs of the 
corona, which are about to be commenced at the Cape by Mr. Ray 
Woods under the direction of Dr. Gill.” {Bull. Astron., June, 1885.) 

Professor Young on the solar corona. — In an article on ‘‘Theories re- 
garding the sun’s corona,” in the North American Review, Professor 
Young expresses “his complete conviction that the corona is mainly 
solar.” He points out that the corona sends us three kinds of light, the 
spectroscopic evidence showing that reflected or diffused sunlight is 
present, though not the main constituent of the coronal luminosity, the 
continuous spectrum indicating the presence of incandescent particles, 
solid or liquid, whilst the bright lines show the presence of luminous 
gases. These mingled gases form what has been called the “ coronal 
atmosphere,” but in it “ there are filaments and streamers and other 
forms that are probably not gaseous, but composed of mist and dust ; 
some of them may be of meteoric origin, and some composed of matter 
ejected from the sun, while others perhaps are due to condensation of 
vapors.” The analogy of the channels in the tails of comets to the 
coronal rifts, and the evidence comets alford to a repulsive force ex- 
ercised by the sun, strike Professor Young as they do Dr. Huggins : 
“All the luminous phenomena of the corona could be accounted for by 
au atmosphere of a density millions of times below that in any vacuum- 
tube ever constructed.” 

Photographing the corona in full sunshine . — Mr. W. H. Pickering, of 
the Institute of Technology, Boston, made a series of attempts during 
the partial eclipse of March 16, 1885, to obtain a photograph of the 
corona. In this he was quite unsuccessful, for though his plates showed 
several corona-like markings, they were clearly not due to the true 
corona, as they were found in front of the moon as well as on the sun’s 
limb. From this Mr. Pickering was evidently led to conclude that the 
results which Dr. Huggins had obtained were probably of a similar 
character, and he expressed as much in a letter to Science. Dr. Huggins 
in reply pointed out that Mr. Pickering’s method was faulty and was 
calculated to produce such false images. The latter, therefore, some- 
what modified his apparatus without, however, altering the two points 
which Dr. Huggins considered most erroneous, viz, the use of an object- 
glass instead of a reflector, and the placing his drop-slit close in front 
of the object-glass instead of in its primary focus. The result has been 
that he has obtained photographs free from false coronse, but showing 
no real ones. At the same time .he has made experiments which con- 
vince him that to produce a perceptible image of a coronal rift it is 


ASTRONOMY. 


401 


necessary to be able to discriminate between degrees of illumination 
which do not differ from each other by more than one-tenth the intrinsic 
brilliancy of the full moon. He considers that the eye is more able to 
detect small differences of light than a photograph is, and states that 
the moon cannot be photographed in full daylight, even though it may 
be easily seen. His investigations also lead him to think that even in 
the clearest weather the atmospheric illumination is three hundred times 
as bright as it should be for it to be possible to obtain any image of the 
corona. To these points Dr. Huggins has replied in the Observatory 
for November. Dr. Huggins states that he has had no difficulty at all 
in photographing the moon in full sunshine, and that the observations 
of Professor Langley and others, of Mercury and Venus, which have 
been seen as black disks before they reach the sun, proves that the 
corona must have a sensible brightness as compared with the atmos- 
pheric illumination. 

He also points out that Mr. Pickering fails to obtain any trace on his 
photographs even of the detects of his own instrument. Dr. Huggins 
declines further discussion, preferring to wait the result of the work now 
being carried on by Mr.Eay Woods at the Cape Observatory. Mr. Pick- 
ering replies in Science forOctober 23, admitting the possibility of pho- 
tographing the moon in full sunshine, but contending that these very 
photographs of the moon supply an additional proof of his opinion that 
the light of the atmosphere near the sun is more than three hundred 
times too intense for it to be possible to obtain a photograph of the 
corona, since the skylight near the sun was fifty times as bright as 
that near the moon, and coronal photographs to be of any use should 
be able to record differences of illumination of only one-tenth the bright- 
ness of the full moon. 

He explains the visibility of Venus and Mercury as being caused by 
the refraction of the sun’s light through their atmospheres, the black 
disk being thus surrounded by a narrow luminous ring. [Nature.) 

Remarkable solar prominences. * — On the 26th of June, 1885, a remark- 
able prominence was noticed upon the eastern limb of the sun by M. 
Trouvelot, of theMeudon Observatory. Its measured height was about 
10''5, or about a third of the sun’s diameter, but it probably extended 
somewhat further. At a point on the sun’s limb diametrically oppo- 
site, another immense prominence was seen nearly equal in height 
to the first. A somewhat similar phenomenon — two opposite promi- 
nences — had been observed on November 22, 1884. 

On August 16, 1885, at 9^ 25™, M. Trouvelot observed a brilliant 
prominence 4' in height, which by ID' 20™ had increased to 9' 27”. With 
the increase in height, it diminished rapidly in brightness, and at IP 22™ 
had completely disappeared. 

Peculiar prominences were also remarked by M. Eicco, of the Palermo 
Observatory, September 16-19, and by M. Trouvelot on September 27.

SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1885. 


Rowland's photograph of the no^ mal solar spectrum . — This map has been 
made by Professor Eowland of the Johns Hopkins University, with one 
of his concave gratings of 21J feet radius of curvature and 6 inches di- 
ameter, and is now complete from wave-length 3680 to 5790 ; the portion 
above 3680 to the extremity of the ultra-violet, wave-length about 3100, 
is nearly ready. Negatives have also been prepared down to and includ- 
ign B, and it is possible they may be prepared for publication ; a scale of 
wave-lengths has been added. “ The error in the wave-length at no 
part exceeds go^po of the whole, and is generally caused by a slight 
displacement of the scale, which is easily corrected. The wave-lengths 
of more than 200 lines in the spectrum have been accurately determined 
to about -g-p-oVoT) piiTt, and these can serve as standards to correct any 
small error of the scale. - - - The 1474 line is widely double, as 

also 1)3 and & 4 , while JE is given so nearly double as to be recognized as 
such by all persons familiar with spectrum observation. Above the 
green the superiority increases very quickly, so that at R we have 120 
lines between H and A, while the original negatives show 150 lines. 
The photograj)hs show more at this point than the excellent map of 
Lockyer of this region.” 

THE PLANETS. 

Intra-merchrial planet. — The report* of a committee of the ifa- 
tional Academy of Sciences, to which was referred the question of the 
expediency of fitting out an expedition to the west coast of Africa for 
the purpose of observing the total eclipse of the sun on August 28-29, 
1886, contains the following remarks in regard to the hypothetical planet 
revolving within the orbit of Mercury : “ In addition to the observation 
of the sun itself, and the luminous phenomena attending it, it is desir- 
able to obtain photographic maps of all the surrounding region to the 
distance of at least ten or fifteen degrees from the sun, for the purpose 
of finally setting at rest the still mooted question of an intra-mercurial 
planet. It is true that the astronomical world is at present disposed 
generally to discredit the existence of such a body, yet the evidence on 
the subject up to this time is mainly negative, as it must always con- 
tinue to be so long as it depends upon direct vision. In a photographic 
map, taken during total eclipse of the sun, of the whole region within 
which such a planet must necessarily be confined, the object, if present, 
must present itself, and could not fail to be recognized. But for photo- 
graphic operations of this class, lenses of wide angle must be specially 
prepared, differing essentially in character from those which are em- 
ployed to take impressions of the eclipse.” 

A search for the “ supposititious Yulcan” was again made by Mr. T. 
W. Backhouse, of Sunderland, England, in March and April, 1885 — the 
period during which a transit is possible, according to Leverrier — but

with no positive result. Mr. Backhouse says : “ I consider the question 
of the existence of Vulcan can only be settled by continued and system- 
atic watching for its appearance in transit, as at the time of an eclipse 
of the sun it may be too near that luminary to be visible.” 

The Earth : Variability of terrestrial latitudes. — The question of the 
variability of terrestrial latitudes was brought anew to the attention of 
astronomers by the International Geodetic Couference at Eome iu Oc- 
tober, 1883. A plan for settling the question by observation was pro- 
posed by M. Fergola, an Italian astronomer, which was, essentially, 
that a careful series of observations should be made with prime vertical 
instrument, by two co-operating observatories difi'ering but little in 
latitude .though, perhaps, considerably in longitude. The same list of 
stars was to be used at each pair of such stations. By repeating these 
observations after an interval of fifty years or more, the question of the 
variability of latitudes would be subjected to a severe test. Theoret- 
ically, periodical changes of latitude may occur, and an examination of 
observations made at a number of Northern observatories during the 
past seventy-five years — Konigsberg, Milan, Naples, Paris, Pulkowa, 
and Washington — appears to confirm the existence of such changes. 
At Pulkowa, which furnishes the most careful series of observations, a 
diminution of the latitude of 0''‘23, equivalent to about 23 feet, is indi- 
cated between the years 1843 and 1872 ; but in all these cases the var- 
iations are small, and we must be extremely cautious in ascribing them 
to actual changes of latitude. A recent and very complete discussion 
of the latitude of the Greenwich Observatory by Mr. Christie gives no 
evidence of a secular change of latitude, and a later determination of 
the latitude of the Washington Observatory (in 1883) also furnishes no 
proof of a change. 

Prof. Asaph Hall, in a paper* read before the Philosophical Society 
of Washington, February 28, 1884, has given a discussion of the obser- 
vations tabulated by M. Fergola. His conclusion is that “ observations 
do not prove that latitudes are variable, and the evidence points rather 
to other sources of small changes that may depend on the seasons. 
Perhax>s some of these may arise from the tables of refraction which 
are in common use, and which are assumed to fit the whole earth.” 

Some preliminary steps have been taken towards putting Fergola’s 
plan in operation at the observatories of Lisbon and Washington 
(the difference of latitude being 11' 7"), but we believe no observations 
have actually been made yet. 

Efect on the earth's motion produced by small bodies passing near it . — 
Professor Newton points outt that the space through which the earth 
travels is traversed also by small bodies, or meteoroids. The impact of 
these bodies upon the earth, and the consequent increase of the earth’s 
mass, have their effect upon tlie earth’s motions, both of rotation and

revolution, and hence upon the lengths of the day and year. Professor 
Oppolzer(^6■^ro^^.,iV^ac/tr., 2573) has discussed the amouutof these actions, 
and has computed the density which the meteoroid matter must have in 
order to produce the observed and unexplained acceleration of the moon’s 
mean motion. But a body that passes near to the earth has also an 
action of like character due to the attraction of gravitation alone, and 
Professor Newton proceeds to calculate its amount. The conclusion at. 
which he arrives is that the effect upon the earth’s motion of the meteors 
that come into the earth’s atmosphere exceeds at least one hundred fold 
that of the meteors that pass by without imj^act. [Observatory.) 

Determination of longitudes in South Ameriea. — According to Science 
(vol. V, p. 151), Commander Davis has just completed his important 
telegraphic determinations of longitude on the western coast Of South 
America. The great chain connecting Washington with different points 
in South America, and then extending through Saint Vincent, Madeira, 
Lisbon and Greenwich, is now closed with but an insignificant discrep- 
ancy. 

The proposed change in the beginning of the astronomical day. — No gen- 
eral agreement has been reached by astronomers upon the sixth resolu- 
tion of the Washington Meridian Conference, which recommends that 
the astronomical and nautical days be arranged everywhere to begin at 
mean midnight. The matter was brought up at the Geneva meeting of 
the Astronomisclie Gesellschaft in 1885. (See Vrtljhrschr., 20, p. 227- 
31.) Struve, Folie, and P'echiile seemed to be the only members present 
in favor of the change, while Newcomb, Weiss, Krueger, Duu6r, Auwers, 
Tietjen, and Safarik spoke in opposition to it. Mr. Downing, of the 
Greenwich Observatory, says [Nature^ 32 : 353), “ . . . ^nd judging 

from the individual expressions of opinion ihat have been published, 
I should imagine that here, as at Geneva, the majority of real workers 
in our science (with the probable exception of those engaged in solar 
work) would be opposed to the i)roposed change.” 

In the United States, official action has been taken by the Secretary of 
the Navy, referring the question to the National Academy. The report 
(Senate Ex. Doc. No. 67, Forty-ninth Congress, first session) of a com- 
mittee of that body consisting of Pres. F. A. P. Barnard, Profs. A. Gra- 
ham Bell, J. D. Dana, S. P. Langley, Col. Theodore Lyman, Profs. E. C. 
Pickering, and C. A. Young says : “ The committee regard favorably the 
proposition of the meridian conference on this subject, and recommend 
that the change should be made as soon as sufficient concert of action 
can be secured among the leading astronomers and astronomical estab- 
lishments of the civilized world — in 1890, if practicable; if not, in 1900.” 

It would seem to be incumbent on those astronomers who have ex- 
pressed themselves in favor of the proposed change, and of the conse- 
quent interruption of astronomical chronology, to justify .strongly their 
position. It is not quite clear that this has been done, for while many 
reasons are given against the change, almost the only argument in its

favor (besides that of convenience in solar work) is, that there will be 
established a certain uniformity of time-reckoning between astronomers 
and the world at large.

Sliy-glou'S : Certain 'phenomena in meteorological optics that have oc- 
curred since the close of the year 1883. Hypothesis concerning the cause 
and origin of these phenomena. — The immediate cause of the “red sun- 
sets” seems to be the existence at a very great height in the atmosphere 
of a cloud, or rather a light mist, composed of very fine particles. This 
hypothesis would explain the twilight phenomena when the sun was 18° 
or 20° below the horizon. We need not suppose these particles to have 
had a greater altitude than 60 or 70 kilometers during the first of these 
apparitions. 

“ The red color of these lights corresponds veiy well with the absorp- 
tive power of the atmosphere which physicists observe in the sun’s 
radiations at different altitudes and astronomers in the ruddy tint pre- 
sented by the moon’s disk in total eclipses the distance traversed 
through the atmosphere by the sun’s rays before reaching this cloud 
explains sufficiently the intensity of the coloring. 

“The solar corona and the anti-solar aureole could be easily explained 
with this hypothesis if the particles held in suspension in the atmos- 
phere are supposed to offer a sensibly constant mean diameter, as the 
theoretical conditions for diffraction coronas would then be present. 

“ The next question is. What is the origin of these particles suspended 
in the atmosphere f The reply to this question is quite independent of 
the explanation of the phenomena of meteorological optics presented 
above. There have been a number of hypotheses on this subject. The 
first, seeking an explanation in the ordinary .domain of meteorological 

‘ The total eclipse of the moon October 4, 1884, did not show this red color in the 
usual degree. This is regarded by some as a proof of the existence of these clouds of 
particles, the higher regions of the atmosphere being rendered less transparent by 
their presence. 


406 


SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1885. 


influences, gives as tlie origin of these particles the formation of very 
minute ice crystals like those which appear to constitute the cirrus clouds. 
The trouble with this very simple hypotheses is that so many additional 
hypotheses are required to sustain it. For some hypothesis must be 
made as to the cause of the production of frozen clouds at an unusual 
altitude. Some reason must be assigned for their permanence during 
months and even years. And the question why optical phenomena, 
halos, mock suns, &c., which accompany the ordinary existence of ice 
crj'stals in the atmosphere do not appear permanently must be answered. 

“Although it might be possible to find explanations for all these 
points of difficulty, it is evident that the proposed hypothesis is simple 
in appearance only, and that it meets with difficulties rather than with 
confirmations in the observed facts. 

“ The second hypothesis attributes to these i^articles a cosmic origin, 
that is to say, the same origin as is assigned to meteors ; the earth is 
supposed to have passed in its orbital motion through a cloud of small 
particles, revolving, like herself, about the sun, and to have drawn after 
her all the ijarticles within her sphere of attraction. This hypothesis 
seems at first thought a very satisfactory one; the twilight lights, at 
first so brilliant, have been growing fainter. This accords with the idea 
that the particles have come from some external source, and have by 
degrees fallen, in the order of their size, to the earth’s surface. The 
explanation appears all the more plausible since true rains of dust have 
been observed in different countries. JTordenskjold made a chemical 
examination of a sample of this dust, collected in Sweden, and found 
it to contain iron and nickel, elements that are present in meteorites. 
Still, this argument is not decisive, for rains of dust, whose origin is 
certainly terrestrial, have often been observed ; as, for example, the dry 
fogs, well known in southern Europe, comi>osed of mineral dust brought 
by the wind across the Mediterranean from the desert oC Sahara. This 
dust has been collected at sea by sailors, and also on the coasts, and. 
has been found to contain silica, feldspar, and mica, elements of the 
sands of the African desert. 

“Volcanic ashes have been sometimes found in Norway, coming from 
the eruptions of Iceland volcanoes ; the microscope shows these to con- 
tain fragments of pumice and even crystals of xjyroxene. The cosmic 
origin of these particles must therefore be sustained by more direct 
proofs, if it is to be accepted. 

“ The third hypothesis connects the diffusion of these clouds of par- 
ticles with the frightful cataclysm at Java, when 50,000 persons lost 
their lives through the explosion of Krakatoa. Nearly all the arguments 
employed by the partisans of the cosmic origin apply with equal force 
to this volcanic origin. It explains why the first twilight manifestations 
appeared directly after the eruption at Java, nothing of the kind having 
been observed before ; it explains, moreover, the progressive march of 
the apparition of these lights about the center of explosion. This pro- 


ASTEONOMY. 


407 


gressive march renders the cosmic origin of these particles quite im- 
probable, for in case of a cosmic origin there seems to be no reason why 
the phenomenon should not appear nearly simultaneously at all points 
on the earth’s surface. Those “regions on the Indian Ocean forming the 
trajectory of a cyclone show in a convincing manner that the ashes of 
the Java volcano, caught up by the ordinary winds of that quarter, are 
the cause of the extraordinary sunsets in question. 

‘‘ The objection may be raised that the height of these particles is 
very great in comparison to the height to which the smoke of our Euro- 
pean volcanoes rises; but, after reading M. Verbeck’s report, these 
objections disappear before the greatness of this volcanic convulsion. 
A quantity of matter, whose volume was estimated at 150 cubic kilo- 
meters, was seen projected 18 or 20 kilometers above the crater. When 
we think that the gaseous matter that escaped at the same time must 
represent a volume some hundreds of times as great, we cease to be 
astonished at the thought of the diffuse dust reaching an altitude of 70 
or 80 kilometers. As to the suspension of these particles in the air, it 
at least does not contradict what we know of the laws of the air’s vis- 
cosity, nor of the action of winds, heat, and atmospheric electricity. 

“A more detailed discussion of the documents published on the sub- 
ject of this frightful explosion would carry us beyond the scope of this 
simple article ; enough has been said to show that these optical phe- 
nomena, of which our atmosphere has been for some eighteen months 
and is still the scene, may be referred with great probability if not cer- 
tainty to a volcanic origin.” (Cornu, in Bull. Astron.., April, 1885.) 

The Moon : Lunar heat . — At the Albany meeting of the ISTational 
Academy of Sciences in October, 1885, Professor Langley read a paper 
“ On the temperature of the surface of the moon.” 

Attempts were made in the last century by several lAiysicists to ob- 
tain indications of heat from the moon, but without success. Professor 
Forbes, in 1885, employed a lens by which the lunar heat was concen- 
trated about 6,000 times, but obtained no certain evidence of heat, be- 
ing led only to the negative conclusion, that the warming effect of the 
full moon on the surface of the earth would, at any rate, not exceed 
sWroo of a degree, Centigrade. The first satisfactory evidence of actual 
heat was obtained by Melloni in 1846, who, with a polyzonal burning 
lens, one meter in aperture, and by the aid of the newly invented ther- 
mopyle, in the clear air of Vesuvius, after due precaution against in- 
strumental error, succeeded in obtaining decisive indications of heat, 
although the amount was all but immeasurably small. Later observers 
were also able to do little more than detect evidence of the existence of 
lunar heat, and the first attainments of anything like quantitative 
measurement thereof, was reserved for Lord Posse, whose experiments 
are recorded in the proceedings of the Royal Society, commencing in 
1869. The paper now before us details the experiments by Professor 
Langley, at the Allegheny Observatory, with the instrument invented 


408

about five years ago, and deuominated the bolometer. The first of these 
were made on the evening of November 12, 1880, chiefly with the Anew of 
testing its sensitiveness, concentrating the lunar rays upon its face by 
means of the 13-inch equatorial of the observatory, and a smaller convex 
lens near its focus, when an average deflection of forty-two divisions of the 
galvanometer scale was obtained. In June, 1883, the bolometer and its 
adjuncts, having been much improvedin theinterval, measurements of the 
lunar heat were resumed with apparatus better adapted to the purpose. 
The heat radiated from the lunar surface may consist of three kinds in 
different proportions : (1) Heat coming from the interior of the moon, 
which will not vary with the phase ; (2) heat which falls from the sun on 
the moon’s surface, and is at once reflected regularly and irregularly ; 
(3) heat which, falling from the sun on the moon’s surface, is absorbed, 
raises the temperature of the surface, and is afterwards radiated as heat 
of low refrangibility. The general conclusion of Protessor Langley’s ob- 
servations is thus expressed by himself. “While we have found abun- 
dant evidence of heat from the moon, every method we have tried, or 
that has been tried by others, for determining the character of this 
heat appears to us inconclusive; and without questioning that the 
moon radiates heat earthward from its soil, we have not yet found any 
experimental means of discriminating with such certainty between this 
and reflected heat that it is not open to misinterpretation. Whether 
we do so or not in the future will probably depend on our ability to 
measure by some process which will inform us directly of the wave- 
lengths of the heat observed.” Combined with his experiments on solar 
radiation. Professor Langley’s investigations seem to point to the prob- 
ability of a gaseous envelope to the moon, too small to make its presence 
known in ordinary astronomical observations ; and it is well known that 
Mr. Neison has advocated this view from other considerations in his 
great work on the moon. {Athenceum.) 

Eclipse of the moon, 1884, October 4. — In spite of the very unfavorable 
atmospheric conditions in Central Europe, nearly forty observatories 
participated in the observation of this eclipse and were able to furnish 
valuable material, which will be made the subject of a si3ecial publica- 
tion when the positions of all the occulted stars shall have been deter- 
mined with the necessary precision. While awaiting the .termination 
of this great piece of work. Professor Struve giv^es a succinct resum<§ of 
the results due to the co-operation of so many workers in the Astro- 
nomische NacTirichten, Nos. 2640-46. 

Mars : The rotation period of Mars . — The seventh volume of the An- 
nals of the Leyden Observatory contains a very thorough and painstak- 
ing investigation by Professor Bakhuyzen of the rotation period of the 
planet Mars. In previous determinations one of two courses has usually 
beeu adopted, either to compare drawings of Huygens or Hooke with 
the most recent observations attainable, or to discuss some modern 
series which seemed to promise to compensate for its restricted range

by its greater accuracy. Professor Bakbuyzen has, however, endeav- 
ored to utilize the entire mass of observations at his disposal, so as to 
avoid the sources of error to which the other methods are liable, and 
he f>ossesses a great advantage over earlier investigators, in having ac- 
cess, not only to the numerous observations made in 1877 and 1879, but 
also to the great series of more than 200 drawings which Schroeter had 
prepared for his projected ‘‘ Areographischen Beitrage,” and which be- 
coming the property of the University of Leyden in 1876, was edited 
and published by Professor Bakhuyzen in 1881. Professor Bakhuyzen, 
in the reduction of these drawings, has adopted provisionally Schflipa- 
relli’s position for the pole of Mars~R. A. 317° 46'-0, Deck 63° 25'’4, 
mean equinox of 1833’0-— and Proctor’s rotation period — 24*^37“ 22®‘74— 
and deduces corrections to these elements from a comparison of the re- 
sults obtained by reducing the various observations at his command 
with them. His first step is, from a discussion of the drawings of Kai- 
ser, Lockyer, Lord Eosse, and Dawes, made during the oppositions of 
of 1862 and 1864, to obtain the time of transit on January 1, 1863, of 
his adopted prime meridian over the Martial meridian, which passes 
through the earth’s north pole, choosing as his prime meridian the one 
which lies 2° to the east of the center of Madler’s point a, correspond- 
ing almost exactly to Schiaparelli’s Fastigium Aryn, or to Proctor’s 
Dawes Forked Bay, he finds the time of transit over the meridian pass- 
ing through the north pole of the earth on January 1, 1863, to be 20’' 
27“ 4 4 0“, Berlin M. T. The areographic longitude of the center of 
the Oculus, the conspicuous circular spot, called by Green the Terhy Sea, 
and by Schiaparelli Lacus Solis, will be, with this prime meridian, 90°-87. 
The second section contains the determination of areographic longitudes 
of ten of the most conspicuous and easily identified markings on the 
surface of Mars as inferred by means of the above elements from the 
drawings of various observers from the time of Hooke and Huygens 
up to 1879. For the last-named year only Schiaparelli’s observations 
are used, but for 1877 there is an abundant supply, there being availa- 
ble, besides the observations of Schiaparelli, the drawings of Lohse, 
Green, Dreyer, and Niesten. Beer and Madler’s drawings afford mate- 
rial for 1830, Herschel and Schroeter give a very full series from 1777 to 
1803, and Huygens and Hooke supply a few drawings from 1659 to 
1683, from which the longitude of Madler’s /, the Kaiser or Hourglass 
Sea, Schiaparelli’s Syrtis Major, can be inferred. These logitudes are 
discussed in the third section, and a corrected .rotation period is ob- 
tained of 24’' 37'“ 22®-66 4 0®-0132, a value exceedingly close to the mean 
of the best previous determinations, which are as follows :

“ Proctor’s value is clearly too large, a comparison of the mean longi- 
tudes obtained for the Kaiser Sea with his period showing a steady de- 
crease for successive oppositions ; the only observations which stand 
conspicuously out from the rest being those of Hooke, upon which he 
had based his determination. There can be no doubt that Professor 
Bakhuyzen’s value is a distinct improvement upon the earlier ones, and 
that its uncertainty lies only in the second place of the decimals, A 
table for computing the time of transit of the prime meridian over that 
meridian of Mars which passes through the earth’s north pole, com- 
pletes the memoir. 

Professor Bakhuyzen supplies also a short note as to changes on the 
surface of Mars, The most conspicuous of all the markings on the 
planet’s surface has always been the Kaiser Sea ; but the drawings of 
Schroeter and Herschel, as Dr, Terby has already pointed out, exhibit 
a second marking near it, nearly as conspicuous, and very similar in 
shape and size. There can be no doubt that the only modern represent- 
ative of this spot is Huggins Inlet, Schiaparelli’s Cycloptim, a narrow 
streak, by no means easily observed, and now entirely unlike the Kaiser 
Sea in shape. Professor Bakhuyzen also considers that there is suffi- 
cient evidence for thinking that Schroeter on several occasions ob- 
served Schiaparelli’s Loestrygonum — one of the most difficult objects on 
the planet — which could scarcely have been tbe case had it not been 
much more conspicuous than it has been of late years. These changes. 
Professor Bakhuyzen thinks, lend a high degree of probability to the 
theory that certain districts of Mars are covered by liquid,” {Nature, 
November 12, 1885,) 

Jupiter : Mr, W, P. Denning has given in Nature (32 : 31-34, May 
14, 1885) a summary of recent observations of the markings on Jupiter, 
with resulting rotation periods, &c. The great red spot has surprised 
us by its extended duration. As early as 1882 it lost such a consider- 
able depth of tone that obliteration seemed imminent, but it has lingered 
on, until now its existence appears likely to be indefinitely prolonged, 
though under visible conditions far less imposing than at an earlier 
stage. All that at present remains of this remarkable formation is a 
dusky elliptic ring, darkest at the following end, and only well seen 
under good definition. Whether this ellipse is identical with similar 
appearances delineated by Dawes in 1857, Huggins in 1858, and Gled- 
hill in 1869, 1870, and 1871, is involved in doubt, because of the lack of 
intermediate observations. We have no definite information as to what 
became of the various objects alluded to. It is very possible that they 
severally represent an object of considerable permanency. The changes 
such as observed may have been induced by atmospheric interference. 
There is every indication that the dense vaporous envelopes of this 
planet are rapidly variable, especially in the zone included by the two 
equatorial belts, and .that the chief features undergo singular fiuctua-

tions, some of which may possibly be of periodical character. The red 
spot has now been followed since. Ib78. Dnriug the last three years it 
has given a rotation period of 9^ 66“ 39’®1, which has been steadily 
maintained throughout each opposition, subject to some minor disturb- 
ances partly due to errors of observation. The first few years of its ex- 
istence it showed an increasing retardation of motion, which lengthened 
the period from 9^ 66“ 34® to that already quoted, but, contemporarily 
with the decay of the spot in 1882, the velocity ceased to slacken, and 
the results accumulated during the past few oppositions, prove it to 
have been equable in a marked degree. 

With reference to the equatorial white spot some striking phenomena 
have been presented during the past winter. Between October 4, 1884, 
and January 13, 1886, its motion appears to have increased in an alarm- 
ing ratio. The spot continued to rush on far in advance of its computed 
plarces, and all the while exhibited a more brilliant appearance than at 
any preceding epoch since the autumn of 1880, when it first came under 
systematic observation. The form and appearance of the spot have been 
so special as to prevent any confusion in mistaking it for other white 
spots in nearly the same latitude. Between October 4 and January 13, 
1886, the rotation period was 49“ 61®-96, but the great increase in 
velocity evidently occurred towards the end of November. Between 
November 21, 1884, and January 13, 1886, the period was only 9^ 49“ 
38®-46, or 34 seconds less than the mean period of 9^^ 60“ 12®'26 shown 
by the same spot during the two preceding years. 

“ Of the new features presented during the last few months the most 
striking are : ” (1) The appearance of large, bright spots indenting 
the north edge of the great northern equatorial belt. (2) The outbreak 
of dark, reddish spots, elongated in longitude, upon the narrow belt 
which became visible in 1882, immediately outlying the great belt. One 
of the most conspipuous of these new spots is about 10,000 miles long. 
(3) The fading away of the west shoulder of the depression north of the 
red spot. 

Professor Young remarked * a peculiar white cloud of oval form par- 
tially covering the “red spot,” in March, 1886. This veil was almost 
concentric with the spot, leaving visible only a narrow ring of the red 
substance not more than to 1 " in width. The outline of the 
cloud was for the most part sensibly smooth and regular, but at the 
preceding end there was a little projection nearly cutting across the red 
ring. The white cloud was not brilliant, but was very nearly of the 
same tint as the white belt on which the red spot lies. 

At the Dearborn Observatory, Chicago, the systematic observation 
of the markings on Jupiter has been continued by Professor Hough : 
his results are given in full in his annual report for 1886, which contains 
sketches of the planet on November 7, 1884, and February 27, April 26, 
and May 16, 1886.

Saturn : The density of Saturn's ring.—^^ M.' Poincare supplies a short 
note on the stability of Saturn’s ring in the November number of the 
Bulletin Astronomique. Laplace had shown that the ring could only be 
stable if it were divided into several concentric rings revolving at dif- 
ferent speeds. M. Tisserand had confirmed this result, and had recog- 
nized that a single ring must, in order to exist, possess a much higher 
density than the planet, and had calculated the maximum breadth of 
each elementary ring in terms of its density and mean radius. M. 
Poincar6 has carried this investigation a step further, and shown that 
if the density of a ring be less than a certain amount, it will, under the 
influence of the slightest perturbation, no longer break up into a num- 
ber of narrower rings, but into a great number of satellites, and that 
if the rings be fluid and turn each as a single piece, the density of the 
inner ring must be at least •§•, and of the outer ring -5^ that of the planet. 
For a ring of very small satellites (not for a fluid ring, as M. Poincar^ 
erroneously states). Maxwell has shown the condition to be that the 
density should not exceed part of that of Saturn. 

“ We do not at present know the actual density of the ring from ob- 
servation sufficiently accurately to make therefrom any certain infer- 
ence as to its physical condition. Bessel’s determination from the 
movement of the peri-saturnium of the orbit of Titan gave the I'eciprocal 
of the mass of the ring as compared with that of Saturn as 118, which 
since the volume of the ring — adopting Bond’s value of 40 miles for its 
thickness — is about 4^ that of the planet, would make its density about 
3-4 times greater than the planet’s. Bessel’s value is, however, clearly 
too great, as he neglected the influence of the equatorial protuberance 
of Saturn on the movement of the apsides. Meyer’s determination of 
the secular variation of the line of apsides of Titan, viz c?7r=1726"'5, 
gives the recii^rocal of the mass of the ring as 26,700, but from all the 
six brighter satellites as 1,960 ; the latter value closely agreeing with 
Tisserand’s. It does not, however, seem to have been noticed that even 
the smallest value for the mass considerably exceeds the highest per- 
missible in accordance with Maxwell’s result, since that would make 
the mass of the rings only ^ 2 0^0 0 0 part of the planet’s, an amount we 
cannot hope to detect with our present resources.” {Nature^ January 
28, 1886, vol. 33: p. 303.) 

Sur la Variabilite des Anneaux de Saturne. — “Observers have as yet 
discovered no fact that could lead them to suppose the rings of Saturn to 
have as a whole a rotary motion about the planet. Now if such a motion 
exists, it is inconceivable that it should have thus far escaped observa- 
tion. But if these rings do not revolve about the planet, we cannot 
admit that they are solid, liquid, or even gaseous, for it is evident that 
such frail structures could not resist the force exercised upon them by 
the constantly variable attraction in the direction of the satellites. If 
it is true that without rotation the rings could be neither solid, liquid, 
nor gaseous, we must seek some explanation that shall satisfy the neces-

sary conditions. The rings must move about the planet without there 
being revolution properly so called of the rings ; they must be solid 
without being rigid. There seems to be no way of satisfying these con- 
ditions and at the same time easily explaining all the observed phenom- 
ena other than the hypothesis conceived by Cassini II and recently de- 
veloped by Proctor and Clerk -Maxwell, which supposes the rings to be 
formed of disconnected material of thousands of little independent bod- 
ies, asteroids, circling around the planet in independent and concentric 
orbits not exactly in the same plane, and completing their revolutions 
in different times. It is evident that all the combinations necessary for 
explaining the observed phenomena would be possible in such a system; 
these bodies would explain certain phenomena in proportion as they are 
more or less numerous, more or less separated by space, more or less 
rare, &c. If we suppose (what is a very probable thing) that these 
bodies possess different reflective powers, we can conceive of all sorts 
of combinations of light, from the brilliant rings to the dark-gray bands, 
In short this hypothesis appears to be entirely sufficient to explain the 
rings of Saturn and their variability.” (Trouvelot in Bull. Astron.j 
January, 1885.) 

The orbit of Tethys . — ‘‘Herr Karl Bohlin has recently communicated 
to the Swedish Academy of Sciences an interesting discussion of the 
elements of the orbit of J'ethys. The observations discussed are those 
of Sir William Herschel, 1789, reduced by Lament; Lament, 1836; Sir 
J. Herschel, 1835- 37 ; the Bonds, 1848-52; Secchi,1856; Captain Jacob, 
1857-’58; Kewcomb and Holden, 1874-’75, and Meyer, 1880-’81. The 
elements are calculated for each period of observation, without taking 
account of perturbations. Herr Bohlin, then specially treating the 
mean longitude of the epoch, and adopting 190O-69812 as the value of 
the mean motion, draws up tables of the differences between observa- 
tion and calculation, and attenrps to represent them by an empirical 
formula. The corrected value of the mean motion is 190°.698169, almost 
identical with that found previously by M. Baillaud. Herr Bohlin finds 
that the annual motion of the peri-saturnium amounts to 33°. M. Bail- 
laud’s results and M. Tisserand’s investigations had given the value as 
70°. The eccentricity is found as 0-00803 ±0-00077.” {Nature, January 
28, 1886.) 

The orbit of lapetus.— An elaborate paper on the orbit of lapetus, the 
outermost satellite of Saturn, by Prof. Asaph Hall, forms Appendix l, a 
quarto pamphlet of 82 pages, recently published, to the Washington 
Observations for 1882. lapetus was discovered on the 25th of October, 
1671, by Cassini with a telescope of 17 feet focal length. Titan, the 
brightest of the satellites of Saturn, was discovered by Huyghens on the 
25th of March, 1655, and Huyghens was deterred, apparently, from fur- 
ther search by his belief that the solar system was now complete, this 
discovery making the number of satellites equal to the n u mber of planets 


414 


SCIENTIFIC RECCED FOR 1885. 


and making six* of each, which was universally admitted to be a 
“perfect” number. Curious variations in the brightness of the new 
satellite were noticed by Cassini, and his observations have been con- 
firmed by subsequent observers. The explanation seems to be that op- 
posite sides of the satellite have different reflecting powers, and that 
the satellite, in revolving around Saturn, keeps the same face always 
turned towards the planet. In this latter respect we have an analogous 
case in our moon. Professor Pickering gives the magnitude of lapetus, 
from photometric measures, 11-82, and the mean diameter 486 miles. 

The observations now published were, for the most part, made by Pro- 
fessor Uall himself with the 26-inch equatorial of the Naval Observa- 
tory, in the years 1875-’S4; a few were made by Professor Newcomb in 
1874. In regard to the examination of the observations for lai ge re- 
siduals, Professor Hall remarks : “ In this work no observation has been 
rejected. When observations have been honestly made, I dislike to 
enter on the luocess of culling them. By rejecting the large residuals 
the work is made to axtpear more accurate than it really is, and thus 
we fail to get the right estimate of its quality.” 

The adopted mean distance of lapetus from Saturn, determined by two 
diflerent methods of observing, (one by differences of right ascension and 
declination* and the other by angles of position and distances,) which 
give very accordant results, is 515-''5195 ± 0-''02645 ; and the time for 
one revolution around the planet seventy-nine flays, se\-en hours, fifty- 
six minutes, forty seconds. Prom this periodic time of the satellite 
and its mean distance, the mass of Saturn expressed as a fraction of 
the sun’s mass is a-Zg-y, or about 93-2 times the mass of the earth. Pro- 
fessor Hall’s paper concludes with some useful tables of the satellite’s 
motion. • 

Uranus .- The satellites of Uranus. — In Appendix i to the Washington 
Observations for 1881 Prof. Asaph Hall has i)ublished the results of 
his investigations of the orbits of Uranus, “ Oheron ” and “ Titania.” 
“The satellites of Uranus were amongst the first objects observed with 
the 26 inch refractor of the Naval Observatory, after it was mounted in 
November. 1873. The first series during the oppositions of 1874 and 
1875 were discussed by Professor Newcomb, with the view to the de- 
termination of the mass of the planet, and the formation of tables of 
the motions of the satellites, which were published in the Washington 
Observations for 1873. Eemarking that as the earth would be nearl}^ 
in the plane of the orbits in the year 1882, and observations made about 

* Professor Hall has called my attention to a slight error in Grant’s rendering of 
Huyghens’ remark f History of Physical Astronomy, p. 268). The discovery of Titan 
made the number of planets and satellites, each equal to six, and six (not twelve, as 
Grant puts it) was regarded as a perfect” number : - utrique illo, quern 

perfectum dicimus, numero continentur - - - ” Huygenii Opera Varia, vol. 2, p. 
530), a perfect number being one that is equal to the sum of all its divisors including 
unity,

that year would probably afford a good determination of the position 
of this plane, Professor Hall commenced a new series in March, 1881, 
which was continued through the four oppositions to the end of May, 
1884 ; these observations were made with magnifiers of 606 and 888 ; in 
fair conditions of the atmosphere the outer satellites are stated to be 
easily observable with the Washington instrument. A comparison of 
the measures with Professor IsTewcomb’s tables showed that these tables 
required but small corrections, which were found by equations of con- 
ditions in the usual manner. It should be mentioned that the tables 
were founded mainly upon Professor Newcomb’s own measures ; these 
by Professor Hall in the year 1875 and 1876 are included in his recent 
discussion. 

For the position of the nodes and inclination of the orbits of the satel- 
lites, Professor Hall finds — 

N=165o-81+0o-0142t 
1= 75o-30-0o-0014t 

t being the number of years from 1883.0. 

“ The mean value of the mass of Uranus by the observations of Oberon 
is those of Titania or, combining the values with 

their respective weights, the final result is ■ 2 2 ^ 8 2 ’ value, though 

somewhat smaller than those previously Obtained, Professor Hall thinks, 
is as good as he could obtain with the filar micrometer of the large re- 
fractor, and he does not consider that there would be much gained by a 
continuation of the measures. He mentions that during the oppositions 
of the planet from 1881 to 1884, which were especially favorable for the 
search after new sateliites, he made careful examination on several good 
nights along the orbit plane of the known satellites without finding any 
new ones. The orbits of Oberon and Titania appear to be sensibly cir- 
cular.” {Nature.) 

Neptune : The satellite of Neptune . — Appendix ii to the Washington 
Observations for 1881 contains Professor Hall’s discussion of the obser- 
vations of this satellite, which were made by Professor Holden and him- 
self with the 26-inch Washington refractor: the discussion includes also 
observations made by Lassell and Marth at Malta in 1863 and 1864. Oor- 
re^ctions (which come out quite small) are given for Newcomb’s elements 
of the orbit, published in Appendix i to Washington Observations for 
1873. Comparing the observations of 1881 to 1884 with those of Lassell 
and Marth, the periodic time is found to be 5’876839 mean solar days. 
Lassell’s period of the satellite, which has been adopted by Newcomb, 
appears to be slightly erroneous. The question of the eccentricity of 
the orbit may be more advantageously attacked some ten or twenty 
years hence, when the apparent ellijise has become more nearly circular, 
and when there will be a better opportunity to determine this element.

SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1885. 


The values of the mass of ITeptune from Hall’s measures at different 
oppositions, and from those of Lassell and Marth aud of Holden, differ 
sensibly. The mean result from Hall’s own observations is he 

remarks that his distances are generally smaller than those of other 
observers, and believes that in order to eliminate the effect of such per- 
sonal equation from the determination of the mass of a planet, the only 
way will be to increase the number of observers and to take a mean of 
the results. On favorable nights examinations of the region about 
Neptune were made, but no other satellite was detected. 

Photometric observations of Ne^ptune . — A series of observations of the 
planet’s magnitude was carried on with the meridian photometer at 
Harvard College Observatory from December 16, 1884, to January 21, 
1885 ; the resulting magnitude for mean opposition is 7‘63. Professor 
Pickering regards it as improbable that there is any variation in the 
light of Neptune of a strictly periodic character. 

The Trans-Neptunian Planet. — In the twentieth volume of the 
American Journal of Science, page 225 et seq., Prof. D. P. Todd, now of 
Amherst College, gave an account of his search, theoretical and prac- 
tical, for the trans-Neptunian planet, made from November, 1877, to 
March, 1878, with the 26-iuch refractor of the Washington Observatory. 
Professor Todd has now published* the full details of his telescojnc 
work, giving a list of all ‘ ‘ suspected objects,” and transcribing his note- 
book entire. 

It was expected that the planet would readily be recognized by the 
contrast of its disc and light with the appearance of an average star 
of about the thirteenth magnitude, and only approximate positions of 
“suspected objects” are given, — generally by me^s of diagrams repre- 
senting the configuration of stars seen in the large telescope and in the 
field of the 5-inch finder. It would lighten considerably the labors of 
any one who may go over this ground iu the future, if Professor Todd 
had summarized his observations in some way, by establishing the 
identity or non-identity of nebulous objects which he has noted, as 
probably to be found in Herschel’s General Catalogue, and by giving a 
list of such objects as he was still, at the end of his work, inclined to 
look upon with some suspicion. 

Although this search was unsuccessful. Professor Todd regards the 
evidence of the existence of “t/ic trans-Neptune planet” as weU founded, 
and he expresses the hope that the search may be continued with the 
imiHOved methods of astronomical photography. 

The Minor Planets. — During the year 1885 the number of minor 
planets has been increased by nine, bringing the whole number now 
known up to 253. The discoveries of 1885 were as follows :

The increasing difficulties in this branch of astronomical discovery 
are forcibly suggested by the fact that four of these bodies were first 
taken for planets already known and their non-identity was only estab- 
lished by later observations. 

Number 253 was discovered while searching for Erigone, and raises 
the whole number of those found by Palisa to fifty. Use is the forty- 
third discovered by Professor Peters. 

Of the minor planets discovered in 1884, number 237 has received the 
name of Coelestina (erroneously given as Hypatia in last year’s report), 
Number 238 that of Hypatia, 239 Adrastea, 243 Ida, and 244 Sita. Up 
to February, 1885, there were still 18 which had been observed at only 
one opposition, excepting, of course, those discovered during the year 
preceding. 

Ephemerides of the small planets for 1886 will be found in the Ber- 
liner Astronomisches Jalirbuch for 1888. There are approximate places 
for every twentieth day, of 247 out of the 253 now known, with accu- 
rately calculated opposition ephemerides for 19 of these. The elements 
of these first 247 are also, given. 

MM. Gallandreau find Fabry give in the Bulletin Astronomique a set 
of tables which will be found very useful in computing approximate 
ephemerides for these small bodies, when the eccentricity of the orbit 
does not exceed 0-407 (=sin 24°). 

A series of photometric observations of Ceres and Pallas made in 
April and May, 1885, at Harvard College Observatory gave Ceres =7-71 
magnitude with a probable error from nine observations of 0-05; Pallas 
=8-55 magnitude with a probable error of 0-02 from ten observations. 
Twenty -two observations of Vesta were made in 1880-’82, giving the 
result 6-47 as the magnitude of the plant for mean opposition, and the 
I)robable error 0-04. Corresponding magnitudes for a distance of unity 
from the sun and from the observer for these three bodies would be 4-27, 
5-10, and 3-93, respectively. 

Mr. A. iN. Skinner, of the United States Naval Observatory, has 
kindly furnished the following complete list of the minor planets. The 
first list gives the number, name, date of discovery, and the name of 
the discoverer: the subscript figure to the name of the discoverer is the 
discoverer’s number. The second list is an alphabetical index of the 
first 252 minor planets.

REPORTS OP OBSERVATORIES. 


The following account of the recent activity of astronomical ob- 
servatories has been derived from the “ Jahresberichte der Sternwarte 
fiir 1884,” in the Vierteljahrsschrift der Astronomischen GeseUscJiaftj vol- 
ume 20 (a condensed translation of this appeared in the Sidereal Mes- 
senger, September, 1885), and from the reports of observatories for 1885 
that have been published up to the present date (April, 1885): the re- 


ASTRONOMY.

j)oits of English observatories are largely obtained from the Monthly 
Notices. Sirius xix : 14-18, 64-66.) contains brief descriptions, &c., of 
Austro-Hungarian observatories. 

Armagh . — The building for the new 10-inch Grubb equatorial (10 feet 
focal length) was erected in July last. The dome moves on 6 canted” 
wheels and is covered with papier-mache riveted to the iron frame- 
work and stitched together with copper wire. The declination circle 
can be read from the eye end, and both it and the right ascension circle 
can be illuminated by small incandescent lamps worked by a two-cell 
bichromate battery. 

Bamberg Observatory. — Dr. Hartwig, recently of the Strassburg and 
Dorpat observatories, has been appointed director (January, 1886), and 
is busy with the preliminary arrangements for erecting the buildings. 

Berlin (1884). — The large meridian circle has been dismounted and 
has received important mechanical improvements. The observations 
on the southern half of the Berlin Zone were temporarily stopped dur- 
ing the year. Dr. Kuestner has begun a series of observations with 
the object of determining the constant of aberration by measures of the 
difference of zenith distances of pairs of stars in the same E. A. and 
equal and opposite Z. D. The work is to be finished in 1885. Dr. 
Knorre has made a large number of observations with the 9'6-inch 
equatorial for the positions of asteroids, comets, and faint stars. The 
planet Hypatia was found by him July 1, 1884. Dr, Battermann is 
regularlj'^ observing occultations, both immersions and emersions. Dr. 
Marcuse has charge of the heliometer, and has made thirty-three de- 
terminations of the solar diameter, &c. Vol. v of the Berlin observa- 
tions has been published during the year, 

German Transit of Venus Commission (1884). The report of Dr. 
Auwers on the work of the computing bureau relates first to the obser- 
vations. These are of three kinds: (1) Observations before the expe- 
ditions, lor practice, and for the investigation of special points ; (‘2) 
observations at the stations ; and (3) observations made after the re- 
turn of the parties. A list of the heliometer measures of each observer 
comprised in these classes is given separately, and a summary, from 
which it appears that the total number of complete measures with the 


four heliometers was :

the examination of some seven hundred and fifty places in the sky to 
solve doubts. In December, 1883, the charting of the stars on the maps 
was again begun and finally completed in March, 1885. The catalogue 
will contain 133,658 stars between — 2° and — 23°; 692 more are given 
north of these limits and 479 south. 

Bordeaux . — This observatory, founded in 1871, has just now {Comptes 
Eendus, 101 : 690, 1885), published its first volume of Annales, con- 
taining a minute description of the instruments (a meridian circle of 
0T9™ aperture, tw'o equatorials of 0-22 and 0’39“, and three clocks), and, 
also, a determination of the longitude of the observatory. An impor- 
tant piece of work has been undertaken by the director, M. Eayet, in 
the re -observation of the 23,000 stars in Argelander’s southern zones, 
between — 15° and — 31° of declination. The latitude is given as 
+44° 50' 7"'23. (Science.) 

Boswell Observatory, of Doane College, Crete, Eebr., is due to the 
liberality of the late Charles Boswell, of West Hartford, Conn. The 
observatory possesses a full set of meteorological instruments in addi- 
tion to its astronomical equipment, and is a signal-service station, co- 
operating with the United States Signal Service at Washington. A 
time-ball is dropped daily at noon. 

Brussels. — The transit and mural are used to observe moon culminat- 
ing stars. A general catalogue of the stars observed at Brussels in the 
years 1857-’78, reduced to 1865, will be printed during 1885. M. F. 
Folie, administrating inspector of the University of Liege, has been ap- 
pointed director. Since the resignation of M. Houzeau, the direction 
has been in the hands of a committee of three, MM. Stas, Liagre, and 
Mailly. 

Buclitel College Observatory, Alcron, Ohio . — Approximate latitude, +41° 
3' ; approximate longitude, 5^ 26“ west of Greenwich. The observatory 
was erected in the summer of 1885, and the instruments set up about 
March 1, 1886. The following instruments are in use : 

Transit circle of 3 inches aperture, by Fauth & Co., of Washington. 
The circles are 16 inches in diameter, one being coarsely divided on the 
edge and serving as a finder, the other being divided on silver to five- 
minute spaces and reading by two micrometer-microscopes to single sec- 
onds. The telescope is provided with right ascension and declination 
micrometers. A fine level is attached, so that the instrument can be 
used as a zenith telescope ; reversing apparatus, plain and diagonal 
eye-pieces accompany the instrument. 

Sidereal clock, by E. Howard & Co., of Boston. This clock is provided 
with electrical attachments for operating the chronograph. Chrono- 
graph, by Fauth & Co. Mean time clock, by Fauth & Co. This clock 
is provided with Gardner’s electrical attachments for operating chrono- 
graph, dropping timeball, and correcting a system of controlled clocks.

Equatorial telescope of inches aperture, by Pike & Sons. 

Sextant, by Fauth & Co. 

The observatory was built as a working observatory for the college 
students in astronomy, and it will be chiefly devoted to this purpose. 
Besides this, the work for the following year will be, (1) to furnish the 
city and surrounding towns with correct time signals ; (2) to determine 
the latitude and longitude ; (3) to observe all occultations of stars that 
are visible here. 

Cambridge {England) Observatory. — The total number of observations 
made with the transit circle during the year was 3,253, including 2,442 
observations of zone stars made on one hundred nights. The observa- 
tions of clock stars and those of Polaris are completely reduced, and 
the mean places for January 1 obtained up to the end of 1884. The true 
apparent places of aU other stars observed in 1884 are also obtained, 
both in E. A. and N. P. D. 

Christiania. — An equatorial of 360“'™ aperture and 6-8™ focal length 
has been erected by Herr H. G. Olsen. {Sirius.) 

Cincinnati Observatory. — No. 8 of the publications of this observatory, 
»!ontaining the observations of comets in 3883, has appeared during the 
pa.st year (1885). “It is noteworthy as presenting a pretty complete 
report on the phenomena of Pons’ periodical comet of 1812 at its reap- 
pearance. The features of the tail were particularly studied, and the 
discussion of the observations, based upon the theory of Dr. Bredichin, 
has been found to add confirmation to that theory.” These observations 
were made by Mr. H. C. Wilson while in temporary charge. The ob- 
servatory is now under the direction of Prof. J. G. Porter. 

Constantinople. — It is reported that the Sultan has ordered the erec- 
tion of an astronomical and meteorological observatory at Constantinople. 

Cordoba Observatory. — Dr. B. A. Gould returned to the United States 
in April, 1885. He has been succeeded as director of the Cordoba Ob- 
servatory by his first assistant. Dr. John M. Thome. Dr. Gould has 
published as the final definitive i)Osition of the Cordoba meridian cir- 
cle ; Latitude, —31° 25' 15"'4G ; longitude, 4^ 16™ 48®-2 west of Greenwich. 

Dearborn Observatory. — Professor Hough’s report for the year ending 
May 20, 1885, states that the meridian circle has been used for deter- 
mination of time, which is furnished daily to the city of Chicago. A 
full description is given of a printing chronograph. The work with 
the great equatorial has been confined mainly to difficult double stars 
and the planet Jupiter. Four sketches of Jupiter accompany the re- 
port. The partial eclipse of the sun of March 16 was observed for last 
contact, and a number of dry-plate negatives were obtained. 

Denmore Observatory (1885). — Mr. W. H. Numsen has erected a small 
private observatory near the city of Baltimore, and his 4-inch Cooke 
equatorial has been devoted to the study of the physical features of

Dresden (1884) (private observatory of Baron Eugelhardt), — two hun- 
dred and forty-two observations of the positions of comets, planets, and 
nebulae (198) have been made with the 12-inch equatorial, besides minor 
observations, 

Dun-Eclit Observatory (1885), — Lord Grawford has published Vol, in,

vations on stellar parallax, Thelist of southern starsmentionedinformer 
reports, observed with the meridian circle, has been supplemented by a 
list of proper motion stars, 

Dusseldorf (1884). — Professor Luther discovered planet 241, Ger- 
mania, during the year on his Berlin chart for 0 hours. Since 1847, 
150 planets have been observed 1,233 times at Dusseldorff with the 
6-inch telescope,

Franlcfort-on-the-Main {1S84:) (private observatory of Herr Eppstein), — 
The star gauges were continued on sixty-two nights, in 682 places, 
2,714 fields, containing 25,875 stars. 

Sun-spots are also regularly observed here, 

Geneva (1884), — The large equatorial has been provided with a spec- 
troscope, Besides the regular observations relating to meteorology 
and to chronometers, observations of comets and of the satellites of 
Saturn have been made, 

Glasgow . — Astronomical observations during 1885 have been neces- 
sarily confined to observations of a select list of stars with the transit 
circle. The meteorological department has finally been put upon a sat- 
isfactory footing, 

Gotha (1884), — The computations of the zone 20° to 25° of the A, G.

and ordinary observations of clock stars shows sensible differences in 
the case of some observers, who, perhaps, have not settled down to a 
fixed habit of observing “reversed” stars. For determining absolute 
personal equations in observations of stars and of limbs of the sun, moon, 
or planets, a personal equation apparatus consisting of a vertical plate, 
with a circular aperture 6 inches in diameter to represent the sun or 
moon and several small pinholes to represent stars, is placed in the 
focus of an object-glass of about 7 inches aperture and 50 feet focal length 
(which is attached to the dew-cap of the transit circle when horizontal 
and pointing north), and is carried smoothly by clock-work. The times 
of transit of the artificial objects are observed over the wires of the 
transit circle, and are also automatically recorded on the^ chronograph. 

The sun, moon, planets, and fundamental sta.rs have been observed 
regularly. The annual catalogue for 1884 contains about 1,370 stars. 

The altazimuth has been used in observing the moon from last quarter 
to first quarter in each lunation. 

For the determination of motions of stars in the line of sight 569 meas- 
ures have been made of the displacement of the F line in the spectra of 
47 stars, and 72 measures of the 6 lines in 14 stars. The observations 
of the last twelve months confirm the change in the motion of Sirius, 
which now appears to be approaching the sun at the rate of about 20 
miles a second. 

Photographs of the sun were taken on one hundred and seventy-three 
days. On only two days was the sun’s disk observed to be free from 
spots. 

In conclusion, Mr. Christie strongly urges an appropriation for an 
object-glass of 28 inches aperture and 28 feet focal length, to be placed 
upon the southeast equatorial mounting, in place of the present object- 
ive of less than half that aperture. This increased optical power is 
especially desired for prosecuting the spectroscopic work. 

We understand that the necessary sum has been granted, and that 
Mr. Grubb is already at work upon the glass. 

Orignon (1884) has made various observations on solar spots, com- 
ets, meteors, lunar eclipses, spots on Venus and Mars, &c., for which 
observations, and the conclusions drawn from them, reference must be 
made to the original report. 

Harrow (Lieutenant-Colonel Tupman’s observatory). — The meridian 
circle has been employed in determining the latitude and longitude of 
the observatory, and in observing right ascensions of the moon. The 
approximate latitude found is -|-51° 34' 47", and the approximate longi- 
tude, from transporting chronometers, 1“ 19®-9 west of Greenwich. The 
equatorial reflector has been chiefly used for observations of comets. 

Harvard College Observatory . — Professor Pickering’s report was pre- 
sented to the visiting committee December 3, 1885. The death of Mr. 
Robert Treat Paine has deprived the observatory of the immediate aid

SCIENTIFIC EECOED FOR 1885. 


and advice of one of its most cordial friends, who had been a member 
of the visiting committee from the time of its original organization, forty 
years ago. Mr. Paine has perpetuated his services to his favorite science 
by the bequest to the observatory of his entire fortune, amounting to 
more than a quarter of a ^million of dollars. Upon the settlement of 
the estate, one-half of this sum will become immediately available. 

The devotion of the observatory mainly to photometry continues, and 
the large equatorial has been occupied in observations of the eclipses of 
Jupiter’s satellites, faint stars selected as standards of magnitude, com- 
parison stars for variables, and of the temporary star in the nebula of 
Andromeda. Mr. Chandler has continued his observations with the 
new instrument of his invention called the almueantar, which in his 
hands exhibits, Professor Pickering says, a surprising efficiency and 
accuracy. The meridian photometer shows a large increase of work 
over previous years, the number of separate settings^ somewhat exceed- 
ing 50,000. The list of objects observed has been somewhat extended, 
and the accordance of the results continues satisfactory. The height 
and velocity of clouds have been the subject of study with Mr. W. M. 
Davis, about three hundred series of measures being obtained at a pair 
of stations connected by telephone. The measured altitudes varied 
from 2,000 to 25,000 feet. The observatory r emains the American center 
of telegraphic distribution of important astronomical announcements, i 
the discovery of nine small planets, five comets, and one new star being 
promulgated during the year. By the aid of the Bache fund of the 
National Academy of Sciences, an important investigation in stellar 
photography has been undertaken. Many irhotographs of the trails left 
by stars have been taken with the camera stationary ; and an equatorial 
star no brighter than the sixth magnitude leaves its mark in this way, 
while stars much fainter near the pole will leave an impression, since 
their motion is slow. Stars as faint as the fourteenth magnitude have 
thus been photographed without clock-work to move the instrument. 
The trails of the faint polar stars are very well defined and minute, and 
afford an excellent measure of stellar brightness, besides furnishing the 
means of determining the stars’ positions with great accuracy. Also, I 
tbe attempt has been made to prepare star charts by photography ; but 
the most striking results have been obtained with stellar spectra. By 
means of a large prism mounted in front of the lens, photographs of 
spectra have been obtained of stars as faint as the eighth magnitude, 
in which lines are shown with sufficient distinctness to be clearly seeu 
in a paper positive. As all the stars in a large region are thus obtained ' 

with one exposure, more than a hundred spectra have been secured on , 

a single plate. 

The work done with the meridian circle by Professor Rogers has 
largely consisted in the determination of the graduation of the instru- | 
ment. The work performed for this purpose is equivalent to the read- 
ing of a microscope forty thousand times. A second revision of the zone

observations between the declinations +50° and 4-55° is nearly com- 
pleted, and the observation of a catalogue of circumpolar stars has made 
good progress. Many shorter series of observations have also been 
made. The reductions are far advanced, and material for several vol- 
umes is nearly ready for the press. 

An abstract of Mr. Chandler’s investigation of the latitude of the 
Havard Observatory in giveu below : 

During the past winter a number of stars situated between +5° and— 5° 
of declination were observed with the almucantar (see Bulletin Astrono- 
mique i, p. 37), for the purpose of a new determination of the latitude of 
the observatory. The observations of this winter, confirmed by a new 
discussion of former determinations, indicate that the latitude of the 
dome of the Havard College Observatory, as given in the American 
Epliemeris (42° 22' 48"-3), or in the Connaissance des Temps (48"*1), is 
much too large. The more correct value, according to Mr. Chandler, 
is 42° 22' 47"-6. 

For the latitude in question, there are on hand Professor Peirce’s 
determination, based upon a long series of observations by the Messrs. 
Bond (1844-’45, prime vertical transits); Dr. Gould’s determination 
(1855, zenith telescope) ; a series of observations by Professor Eogers 
(1864, prime vertical transits) not yet published; and, finally, two series 
obtained by Mr. Chandler in 1883, with a small almucantar and with 
a portable transit instrument. We give here the collected results of 
these different determinations, which are quite sensibly modified by 
reduction to the system of Dr. Auwer’s fundamental catalogue. The 
results of 1844, which depend upon five stars only, are much more ac- 
cordant with the other results if the observations of /S Persei be omitted 
in the reduction, /3 Persei giving a latitude 1"*5 less than the general 
mean. Mr. Chandler thinks that this star’s proper’ motion in declina- 
tion as adopted by Dr. Auwers (+0"-01) should be corrected by 
(_0"-03i.

Scientific record for 1885. 


Meriny. — Vol. ii will be published jn 1885. Spectrum observations 
of /? Lyrse have confirmed the variability of the spectrum of this star. 
Many other spectroscopic observations of stars, planets, and comets 
have been made. 

Hong-Kong. — Largely devoted to meteorological observations, weather 
reports, &c. The new time-ball was dropped daily at 1 P. M., Sundays 
and holidays excepted. Observations of the moon and of Jupiter’s sat- 
ellites have been obtained. 

Karlsruhe (1884). — The principal work of the observatory is the de- 
termination of the positions of southern stars to 8th magnitude, inclusive, 
lu the zone 0° to —4°, 5,000 observations have been made, and the zone 
■—4° to —7° has been commenced. The single positions have probable 
errors of 4:0®'028 and ±0’'*39. The 6-inch refractor has been re- 
mounted. 

Kew. — Sketches of sun-spots have been made on one hundred and 
seventy-six days, in order to continue Schwabe’s enumeration. The 
rating of time-pieces and the examination of sextants, meteorological 
instruments, &c., is continued. 

Kiel (1884). — The equatorial has been used to observe 2 2164 for par- 
allax, by Dr. Lamp. INew comets were regularly observed. The me- 
ridian circle is used to determine the positions of stars between 79° and 
82° north. The zone catalogue (55° to 65°) is in preparation. 

Leipzig (1884). — A 6-inch heliometer by Eepsold is in process of con- 
struction and will be delivered at the end of 1886. A universal instru- 
ment has been ordered, with which a long series for latitude will be 
commenced. Ten thousand five hundred and forty-one observations 
(123 zones) of zone stars have been made in the new zone (-1-5° to -f-10°) 
and the reductions for the old zone (-1-10° to -1-36°) are in progress. 

Leipzig (1884) (private observatory of Dr. Engelmann). — Two thou- 
sand six hundred observations of 430 double stars have been made, 
mostly of Struve’s doubles. An investigation of the constant errors is 
in progress. It appears that the difference in the magnitude of the com- 
pouents influenced the constant errors in a marked degree. Otto Struve’s 
list of double stars for comparison has been observed ; about 500 meas- 
ures have been obtained. 

Leyton (Mr. Barclay’s observatory). — Double-star observations and 
observations of the phenomena of the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn 
are continued. 

Lich Observatory. — All the buildings for the observatory proper are 
now completed except the dome for the large equatorial. A suitable 
dwelling house has been erected ; others will be required. All the princi- 
pal instruments of the observatory but one have been designed, ordered, 
constructed, inspected, and are now suitably mounted, so that observa- 
tions could be at once begun. This instrumental equipment consists 
of a 12-inch Clark equatorial ; a Eepsold meridian circle of essentially

the same design as the Strasburg instrument, having an object glass 
of 6 inches aperture, witli collimators of the same size (these three ob- 
jectives by Alvan Clark & Sons) ; a 4-inch transit instrument by Fauth; 
a 6-inch equatorial; a 4 inch comet-seeker by Clark; a 2-inch Eepsold 
vertical circle ; a photo -heliograph ; a measuring engine by Stackpole, 
reading either rectangular or polar co-ordinates. There are five clocks, 
by Dent, Frodsham, Hohwii, and Howard, and four chronometers by 
Kegus. A system of electrical connections unites all the clocks and 
observing rooms. A most wise provision is a workshop with a com- 
plete outfit of tools and lathes. An extensive library is in process of 
formation and has already necessitated an outlay of about $5,000, 

The contract for the object glass of the great refractor, which is to 
have an aperture of 36 inches and a focal length of 60 feet, was placed 
with the Messrs. Clark nearly five years ago. Two years later they re- 
ceived from the glass-maker, M. Fell, of Paris, a disk of flint-glass of the 
required perfection, and 38 inches in diameter. After repeated unsuc- 
cessful attempts a satisfactory piece of crown-glass was cast in 1885, 
and sent to the Clarks, and about October the work of figuring was 
begun, and is now being pushed rapidly forward. The Clarks hope to 
have the objective finished in the autumn of 1886. It has not yet been 
decided, we believe, who is to make the elaborate mounting for the tel- 
escope, or the dome of about 70 feet diameter, which is to cover it. 

‘‘With regard to the prospective capabilities of the great telescope 
when placed in so favorable an atmosphere, it is stated that it is not 
unreasonable to suppose that on the best nights the maximum magnify- 
iug power (about 3,500) may be advantageously employed. Making 
due allowance for the unfavorable effects of the earth’s atmosphere, 
the observer might, under these circumstances, expect to see the moon 
much the same as he would without the telescope, if it were only 100 
miles away. It might be possible then to make out details of objects, 
even although they were no larger than some of the larger edifices on 
the earth.” 

Prof. Edward S. Holden, director of the Washburn Observatory, Madi- 
son, was appointed January 1, 1886, to the double position of director 
of the Lick Observatory and president of the University of California, 
to which latter institution the observatory when completed will be at- 
tached. Professor Holden, as consulting astronomer, has virtually had 
the direction of the work for some time past, visiting Mount Hamilton 
in 1881 and again in 1883 and 1884. 

The first volume of the i)ublications of the Lick Observatory is now 
in course of preparation, under the direction of the Lick trustees, byCapt. 
Richard S. Floyd and Professor Holden. 

Liverpool Observatory. — Time-service and chronometer tests are con- 
tinued as in previous years. The late Mr. John Hartnup was succeeded 
as director by his son, who bears the same name.

SCIENTIFIC KECORD,rOE 1885. 


Lund (1884).— Dr. Dun6r continues liis observations of tbe spectra 
of stars, measures of double stars, and positions of the comets. The 
longitude observations of Dr. Duner and Professor Thiele in 1879, lately 
reduced, make the Lund Observatory 2“ 26®-38 ± 0®'04 east of the ob- 
servatory of Copenhagen. 

McCormick Observatory . — TheLeander McCormick Observatory, of the 
University of Virginia, was formally opened by public ceremony on the 
13th of April, 1885. An address on “The instruments and work of As- 
tronomy,” was made by Professor Hall, of the United States Naval Ob- 
servatory. 

The 66®“ (25-98 inches) equatorial of the observatory is chiefly em- 
ployed at present in observations of nebulae. During the progress of 
this work something over two hundred new nebulae have thus far been de- 
tected by Professor Stone and his assistant, Mr. Leavenworth. Draw- 
ings of about the same number of nebulae (some old and some new) 
have also been made. Professor Stone designs making a special study 
of the nebula of Orion. 

McKim Observatory. — The McKim Observatory was opened in Sep- 
tember, 1885, as a department of De Pauw University. It is located 
in the suburbs of the university town, Gree'ncastle, Ind., in west longi- 
tude from Greenwich 86° 37^', north latitude 39° 37^ The building 
and the full instrumental experiment which it is designed to have are 
the gift of Mr. Eobert McKim, of Madison, Ind. This gentleman has 
for a number of years had a 6-inch glass mounted near his residence, 
so that the observatory he has just presented to De Pauw University 
might almost be called the second McKim Observatory. 

The equatorial has a clear ai)erture of 9-53 inches ; the dome is of 
iron, and is 17 feet in diameter. Both telescope and dome are by 
Warner and Swasey, of Cleveland. For clock errors an almucantar is 
to be used. The buildiug and instruments have cost $8,000, and about 
$2,000 more will be expended. Dr. T. P. John is the director. 

Madras . — From the report for 1883 we learn that 2,453 observations 
were made with the meridian circle during the year,' making a total of 
50,878 Only a few hundred more are required to finish the catalogue 
of over 5,000 stars. The publications are badly behindhand. 

Melbourne . — Mr. Ellery’s nineteenth annual report states that the 
new transit circle of 8 inches aperture was received in May, 1884, and 
mounted early in July. It is proposed to send the two specula of the 
great reflector, one after the other, to England to be repolished. A 
number of stars selected by Auwers was observed with the old transit 
circle to assist in the formation of a fundamental catalogue of southern 
stars. 

Mexico Observatory . — Prof. H. S. Pritchett, director of the observa- 
tory of the Washington University at Saint Louis, kindly communicates 
the results of a longitude campaign between his observatory and the Ob-

servatorio Nacional de Mexico, Sr. A. Aiiguiano, director. A prelimi- 
nary discussion gives 35“ 57®.25 as the difference of longitude, or 6^ 36“ 
46®.41 west of Greenwich as the resulting longitude of the transit-circle 
piers of the Mexican observatory. This differs 5®.0 from the old value 
determined by moon-culminations. The circuit was 2,583 miles long, 
with five repeaters, and the armature time was quite constant, averag- 
ing 0®.38. The outfit of the Mexican Ifational Observatory includes a 
15-iuch equatorial by Grubb, and an S-inch meridian circle and a 6-inch 
transit, both by Troughton and Simms. The personnel consists of the 
director (Sr. Anguiano) and five assistants. {Science, November 6, 
1885.) 

Milan (1884). — The 8-inch refractor has been used for measurements of 
255 double stars and for observations of comets. The measures of the 
ellipticity of Uranus cannot yet be considered free from all objections. 
The observations on Mars seem to confirm previous results as to the 
duplication of canals, &c. 

The large dome for the 18 inch refactor is nearly completed. 

Munich (1884). — The 10-inch equatorial is now remounted and theEep- 
sold micrometer has been studied. It will be principally used to de- 
termine the parallaxes of LI. 28298, 26 Draconis, Gr. 2875, Br. 3077. 

The Munich zones contain 34,000 stars, of which 9,800 require reob- 
servation. This will be accomplished in zones 6° broad. The old Mun- 
ich zones are recomputed and a catalogue (for 1880) is in preparation. 

Natal Observatory (1884). — Fifty-nine transits of the moon’s limb and 
50 transits of the nearly central crater Murchison A have been obtained 
with the transit circle. These ob.servatious furnish data for calculating 
the variation in the irradiation at the edge of the moon and of the ef- 
fect of the known irregularities on the limb. Arkley Observatory, 
England, co-operates in this work. An appendix to the report con- 
tains observations of comets Pons and Barnard. 

Nice . — The observatory and its extensive grounds occupy the sum- 
mit of a hill known as Mont Gras, some 1,200 feet above sea level and 
distant from the Mediterranean about 3 or 4 miles. We notice that it 
is arranged on the plan of detached buildings, a plan that has been fol- 
lowed in the construction of most large observatories of recent date. 
On the southern slope of the hill are the dwelling houses for the ob- 
servers, library, computing rooms, &c., and higher up are the various 
buildings that contain the instruments. A 15-inch equatorial, 6-iuch 
meridian circle, and 3 inch transit are already in use. The great steel 
dome, 72 feet in diameter, is finished and has been found to work sat- 
isfactorily. The peculiarity in the construction of this dome — the work 
of the celebrated engineer Eiflel, of Paris — is that the greater part 
of its weight is taken by a circular float which revolves in an annular 
tank filled with a solution of chloride of magnesium in water. This so- 
lution has a density of 1*25, and is able tp resist a temperature of 40^^

centigrade below zero. Eunning wheels are used as guides and to take 
such a share of the superimposed weight only as may be necessary to 
secure perfect steadiness in rotation. It is evident that by adding to 
the water in the tank the weight on the wheels can be either entirely 
or partially relieved, and by abstracting from it, any desired pressure 
can be placed upon these wheels. The shutter is made in two leaves, 
and opens right and left with a rain-tight joint in the center; the open- 
ing is about 10 feet. For a complete description of the dome, with illus- 
trations, we must refer to U Astronomic, 4 : 206-12; Observatory, 8 : 290; 
and Nature, 32 : 62, 297. 

M. Faye announces that the objective of 30 inches clear aperture has 
been finished by the Henry brothers, and has been sent to Gautier, who 
has charge of the construction of the great equatorial ; it is hoped the 
instrument will be mounted in April, 1886. 

O' Oy alia. — Sixteen hundred and ten observations for the spectroscopic 
Durchmusterung of the southern sky have been made. Color observa- 
tions with the Zoelluer photometer are also continued, as well as various 
other photometric and spectroscopic series. 

Oxford University Observatory. — The director’s annual report was read 
on June 3, 1885. A subsidiary observatory, for instruction, has been 
built. Professor Pritchard has i)ublished fP memoir on the evidences 
of mutual gravitation among the components of the Pleiades. The com- 
ifietion is announced of the phometric survey of all stars visible to the 
naked eye from the pole to — 10°. 

Paris . — Bear- Admiral Mouchez has issued his report on the work of 
this establishment during the year 1884. The completion of the reob- 
servation of Lalande’s stars has led to a new disposition of the meridian 
instruments, one of which, on the proposal of M. Lcewy, is now occupied 
with the determination of a number of circumpolar stars on his new 
method ; the great meridian circle and the circle of Gambey are still 
employed for observations of the minor planets and of comparison stars 
for planets, comets, and nebulae observed with the equatorials. The 
great telescope of 0™’74 is still unmounted, no suitable position being 
available in the present state of the grounds of the observatory. M. 
Mouchez mentions having received communications from the authorities 
in Algeria, referring to the possibility of obtaining from the local budget 
the greater part of the sum that would be required to mount the instru- 
ment at the observatory of Algiers on the summit of the Boudjareah, 
an exceptionally favorable situation, which might be visited by the as- 
tronomers of the Paris Observatory for special observations, but the 
council of the latter institution have not availed themselves of the prop- 
osition, in the hope that the equatorial may yet be erected at Paris. 
Amongst the observations made with the instruments in the west tower 
and the Henry equatorial are many of the satellites of TJranus and 
Ifeptune, the companion of Sirius, the belts of Uranus, nebnl®, and

double stars. MM. Henry have been occupied with astronomical pho- 
tography during the year, and, as is well known, with great success j 
various clusters of stars have been photographed, and M. Mouchez ap- 
pends to his report a reproduction by heliogravure of a plate of the 
great clusters in Perseus. A trace of the motion of the minor planet 
Pallas was shown after an exposure of thirty-five minutes. The im- 
portant results obtained by MM. Henry in photographing very small 
stars in those crowded parts of the heavens where the galaxy crosses 
the ecliptic have been already referred to. - - - Steady progress 
has been made, both with the calculations and printing of the Paris 
Catalogue of Stars, and it is expected that the first volume of both series 
(star positions as observed, and catalogue) will be completed by the 
end of the year. Y ol. 18 of the MSmoires is finished. The report further 
details the personal work of the members of the observatory staff. 
Amongst the additions to the museum is a portrait of Pons, presented 
by M. Tempel. 

The report for the year 1884 is preceded by one which enters spe- 
cially into the present condition of a scheme for removing the principal 
instruments in the observatory to a site where not only greater steadi- 
ness can be secured in their mounting, but where the objections of be- 
ing surrounded by a gveat city will not exist. It appears that the 
Academy of Sciences have not, so far, favored this scheme. M. Mouchez 
states very clearly his view of the question. {Nature.) 

Potsdam . — Eesearches are in progress on a new determination of the 
wave-lengths of a large number (300) of the Praunhofer lines ; on the 
influence of temperature on the refraction and dispersion indices of 
fixed substances; on the reflective power of various substances; on 
the absorption-spectra of such substances as are used in photography, 
&c. 

Jupiter and Mars were regularly observed and the nebulae observa- 
tions are concluded. 

The photometric measures embraced long series of determinations of 
the brightness of the major planets and of seven of the asteroids. 
Many variable and red stars were also measured. Determinations of 
the brightness of stars by i^hotography have also been made, and a 
number of photographs of clusters have been taken. 

“The first part of the fourth volume of the publications of this obser- 
vatory, which was published in the latter part of last year [1885] con- 
tains three papers. The first of these is by Professor Vogel, and con- 
tains the observations which he made with the great Vienna reflector 
in 1883 for the purpose of testing the lierformance of the great object- 
glass. Professor Vogel’s final verdict is altogether favorable. ‘The 
Vienna objective,’ he says, ‘leaves nothing to be desired as regards the 
preci.sion of the images,’ and he speaks of using with advantage a power 
even of 1,500 upon planetary markings, a statement which is illustrated 
by a sketch of part of Saturn’s ring as seen with that magnifying i)ower.

His principal observations were, however, spectroscopic. Professor 
Vogel utilizing the groat light-gathering power of the Vienna equatorial 
for a detailed examination of the remarkable spectra shown by several 
faint stars, classified by him under Types II h and III h. - - ■ The 
paper also contains a number of observations of nebulae, principally 
planetary, and is illustrated by four lithographic plates. The second 
paper contains meteorological observations made in the years 1881 to 
1883, and the third is a very careful investigation by Dr. G. Muller of the 
influence of temperature on the refraction of light through prisms of 
various kinds of glass, of Iceland spar and rock crystal.” {Nature.) 

Prague (private observatory of Professor Safarik). — Fourteen hun 
dred and eighty-two observations of 92 stars were made in 121 observ- 
ing nights. 

Pulliowa Observatory . — “ We have received M. Struve’s annual re- 
port, presented May 25, 1885, on the work of the observatory during 
the year. The great 30-inch refractor had not yet been brought regu- 
larly into use; but at the time of writing the report observations with 
it were to be eommenced immediately. The observations with the 15- 
inch equatorial, which for the last forty-five years have been M. O. 
Struve’s own special work, are now undertaken by his son, Hermann 
Sturve, as he himself has been too much occupied with other work, as 
well as having been incapacitated by a long illness. Micrometrical 
pleasures (98 in all) of the relative positions of lapetus and Titan, 
Titan and Ehea, and Ehea and Dione have been made during the year. 
It is hoped that these measures, in combination with those made in 
former years, will furnish very accurate elements of the orbits of these 
satellites. Dr. Hermann Struve has also made observations for determi- 
nation of the parallaxes of 10 stars, as well as determinations of the 
positions of Encke’s and WolPs comets. The relative positions of 116 
faint stars, which were occulted by the moon during the total eclipse of 
October 4, 1 884, have also been determined with this instrument. Ob- 
servations with the great transit instrument have been continued by 
Wagner, with Wittram as his assistant. The observations (2,.348 in 
number) have chiefly been of the Pulkowa Eauptsterne. With the ver- 
tical circle ISTyr^u has zealously pursued his work of determining the 
declinations of the Eauptsterne. Of the 895 observations made 
during the year, no fewer than 832 were made in both positions of the 
instrument. In addition to these, 103 observations of the sun were ob- 
tained. Eomberg, observing with the meridian circle, has obtained 
1,236 observations in both elements of different stars taken from, (1), the 
Abo Catalogue; (2), the Pulkowa Catalogue of Double Stars; (3), stars 
used for comet observations; (4), stars used for determining the scale of 
the heliometer. With the 4-inch Eepsold heliometer Backlund has ob- 
tained thirty-two measures of distances and thirty measures of position- 
angles of Jjipiter’s satellites, Lindemanu has investigated the varia-

tion of light of Y Cygui with the Zollner photometer {Observatory, No. 
104, p. 435), and also has observed some other stars, the variability 
of which has been suspected. Hasselberg’s spectroscopic researches 
have been limited to the chemical elements, nitrogen and hydrogen, 
which, however, are not yet finished. Photographs of the sun have 
been regularly taken throughout the year, for which work gelatine 
plates have been found specially conveneint. During the year 220 
photographs have been obtained on 173 days. Eeferring to the work 
carried on at the Marine Observatory at Nicolajew, M. Struve remarks 
that the director has found at Datum an extraordinary deviation of the 
plumb-line, amounting to 49"'6 in longitude=37"*l of a great circle in 
the direction of the prime vertical. In latitude the deviation is 16". 
That no volume of Pulkowa observations has been published during 
the year is owing chiefly to the long iUness and multitudinous occupa- 
tions of the director. The following volumes, however, are iu active 
preparation: Volume Yiil, which contains the star catalogue compiled 
from the meridian observations, 1839 to 1869; volume x, containing 
the continuation of O. Struve’s measures of double stars; volume xii, 
containing the fundamental determinations of E. A. for 1865.0 ; and 
volumes xttt and xiv, containing the fundamental determinations of 
declination for the same epoch. The work of the geographical and 
geodetical bureau, under Dollen’s superintendence, has also been carried 
on as usual during the year.” {Observatory.) 

RadcUffe Observatory, Oxford . — With the transit circle 3,500 observa- 
tions of transits have been made, and 3,440 circle observations. The 
volume for 1882 has been printed ; that for 1883 is nearly ready for 
press ; the observations for 1884 are completely reduced ; those for 1885 
are nearly reduced to the end of the year. 

Rome . — A new observatory is being built under the direction of Father 
Ferrari, S. J., formerly assistant, and successor of Father Secchi, in the 
observatory of the Eoman College. The observatory is now in posses- 
sion of a 4-inch equatorial by Merz, and is to have a 10-inch by the 
same maker. {8id. Mess., 4 : 313.) 

Rosse {Earl of). Birr Castle, Parsonstown. — Attention has been given 
to i)hotometry and the measurement of lunar heat. The driving-clock 
of the 6-foot reflector is now run bj'^ water power. 

San Jos6, Cal . — The recently completed observatory for the Univer- 
sity of the Pacific, at San Jos6, has a 6-inch Clark equatorial, and a 
Fauth transit instrument. The dome is 12 feet in diameter inside, 
covered with galvanized iron, and requires 15 pounds to turn it. The 
building and instruments are the gift of Capt. Charles Goodall, of San 
Francisco, and Daniel Jacks, of Monterey. The observatory is under 
the charge of Prof. J. C. George. 

Smith Observatory. — W e are very glad to learn that the reported clos- 
ing of the Smith Observatory of Beloit College on account of lack of

funds is incorrect. Mr. Tatlock has been succeeded as director by Mr, 
Charles A. Bacon. New arrangements have been made for both me- 
teorological and astronomical observations, and special attention will 
be given to solar and spectroscopic work. 

Stonylmrst College Observatory. — Magnetic and meteorological obser- 
vations have been made in 1884, as during the past fifteen years. On 
257 days drawings of the sun were made; the entire chromosphere was 
measured on 88 days, and spectra of spots were obtained on 36 days. 
“ The glow encircling the sun during the day has never been entirely 
absent, though it varied in intensity from time to time.” 

Strassburg .* — Dr. W. Schur has published his report of the work 
done at the observatory during the last year. The instruments in use 
at Strassburg are, (1) the meridian circle; (2) the altazimuth; (3) the 
great 18-inch refractor; (4) heliometer, and (5) the 6-inch refractor. 
It would appear, however, that to work these numerous and excellent 
instruments Dr. Schur has only two assistants. The meridian circle 
has been chiefly employed in observing stars for the southern zones of 
the Astronomische Gesellschaft, as well as in determining positions of 
the sun, moon, and large planets and miscellaneous stars, comet-stars, 
&c. Determinations have also been made of the errors of division of 
the circle and of the form of the pivots. With the altazimuth, to which 
Herr Schur appears to have devoted a considerable amount of time and 
attention, observations of the moon have been commenced. The great 
refractor has been used for observing comets, and a re-examination of 
the micrometer-screw shows the necessity of a correction to the results 
which have been already published. With the heliometer a number of 
measures of the sun’s diameter have been made ; whilst the 6 inch re- 
fractor has been employed in making a series of measures for the deter- 
mination of the parallax of Aurigae. The amount of work performed 
by Dr. Schur and his assistants is very creditable to them ; but at the 
same time we are constrained to remark that it is a misfortune that an 
observatory which is so well provided with instruments should not have 
a larger observing staff, in order that the various instruments might 
be worked adequately and to the best advantage. ( Observatory^ October, 
1885.) 

Tasclikent . — The main object of the observatory is to co-operate in the 
surveys and exjjlorations of Turkestan. Four latitudes and longitudes 
were determined in 1884. Comets, asteroids, and solar-spots have been 
observed also. 

Temple Observatory., Bugby . — The Spectroscopic measurement of the 
motions of stars in the line of sight has been continued, and a new in- 
strument with prisms of bisulphide of carbon — intended for this work — 
is nearly completed. Double stars measures have been made as in 


Aatron. Nachr., No. 2675.

former years, and a catalogue of 900 sets of measures lias been published 
in the Memoirs of the Eoyal Astronomical Society. 

United States Naval Observatory . — The report of the Superintendent 
bears the date of October 5, 1885. Eear- Admiral S. R. Franklin, TJ. S. 
l^avy, was detached March 31 and ordered to the command of the 
European squadron. From that date to the 1st of June Commander 
A. D. Brown acted as Superintendent, when he was relieved by Commo- 
dore George E. Belknap. 

The 26-inch equatorial, in charge of Professor Hall, has been em- 
ployed on satellites and double stars. The dome, 43 feet in diameter, 
is now revolved with great ease by means of a 4 horse-power gas engine. 
The observations of the satellite of Neptune and those of the two outer 
satellites of Uranus have been discussed and the results published. 
The observations of lapetus have been published since the report 
closed. 

The transit circle has been employed in the same class of work as in 
the preceding years. Since the last report 5,520 observations have been 
made. Of these, 90 were of the sun, 70 of the moon, 156 of the major 
planets, and 64 of the minor planets. 

The 9-6-inch equatorial : Professor Frisby was placed in charge April 
2, 1885. The work of the instrument has been confined to : (1) Obser- 
vations of comets, six of which have been systematically observed during 
the year. These observations have all been reduced to date, and pub- 
lished in various astronomical journals in this country and Europe. (2) 
Observations of asteroids, principally of such as could not be observed 
with the transit circle on account of their faintness or their position; 
thirty-five regular observations of asteroids were made, and twenty-one 
approximate positions of other asteroids obtained, so that they could 
readily be observed with the transit circle. (3) Occultations of stars by 
the moon, whenever practicable. (4) Doubtful observations of stars and 
asteroids made with other instruments were looked up and decided, 
this being probably one of the most important uses of the equatorial. 
A few observations have been made of the variable star in the nebula 
of Andromeda, which show that the star is decreasing in brightness. 
Assistant Astronomer Winlock has made several observations of 
comets, with drawings of their physical peculiarities and "changes of 
appearance. 

The prime vertical instrument : The work of reducing the observa- 
tions made in 1883-’84 by Lieut. C. G. Bowman and Ensign H. Taylor, 
U. S. Navy, for the determination of the constant of aberration, has 
been pursued. In July of last year a communication was received from 
the president of the International Geodetic Conference, asking the co- 
operation of this Observatory with the Eoyal Observatory at Lisbon in 
the determination of the problem of the change of latitudes, the obser- 
vations to be taken with the prime vertical instruments of the two 
observatories. Communication was opened and correspondence is still

SCIENTIFIC EECORD FOR 1885. 


in progress with the director of the observatory at Lisbon, and prepara- 
tions have been made to undertake the work here very soon after it is 
known that it will be begun at Lisbon. 

Meridian transit instrument : The work has consisted principally of 
daily observations and reductions for clock corrections in connection 
with the time service. 

Time service : During the past year the demands upon the time serv- 
ice have greatly increased. In Washington, the number of clocks of 
the Gardner system in the various public offices has increased from 20 
to 84. The total number of time-balls now dropped by the Observatory 
signal is eight, at the following points : Philadelphia, Baltimore, Kew 
Orleans, at branch hydrographic offices ; I^ew York, Western Union 
building; Navy Department, Washington; navy-yard Washington; 
Hampton Eoads ; Savannah. A ninth will soon be added at the tor- 
pedo station in Newport. 

The branch observatory at Mare Island, which is fitted with a dupli- 
cate of the transmitting apparatus of this Observatory, has been con- 
nected with the mainland by a cable, and time signals are transmitted 
daily along the Pacific coast. A time-ball has been erected on the 
island for the benefit of the Vallejo shipping, and is dropped daily at 
noon of the one hundred and twentieth meridian. The Hydrographic 
Office time-ball at San Francisco is also dropped at the same instant by 
signal from the Mare Island Observatory. 

Photography : In the programme of work proposed for the current 
year it was stated that the work of taking sun photographs daily would 
be inaugurated as soon as practicable. The work of the Transit of Ve- 
nus Commission has up to this time prevented any regular system being 
adopted. 

During the year the names of 1,408 visitors have been recorded, and 
1,137 permits were issued for night visitors, for whose accommodation 
the small equatorial is set apart. 

The records kept by the several observers and watchmen show that 
only about one night in eight is good for observing, while an exception- 
ally good night for astronomical work cannot be reckoned upon much 
oftener than once a month. 

The Conrmodore renews the recommendations of his predecessors that 
the Observatory be removed* to the new site purchased in 1880, and that 
a board of visitors be appointed to visit the institution annually. 

A special report of Professor Harkness is added, giving the progress 
of the work of the Transit ot Venus Commission. 

Upsala . — The unpublished observations of nebulae and clusters up to 
1880 are now prepared for the press. With the Zoellner photometer it 
is proposed to determine the magnitudes of the comparison stars used 
by Argelauder, Schoenfeld, aud Oudemanns for variables. 

'*A committee of the National Academy of Science has, at the request of the Secre- 
tary of the Navy, given careful consideration to this question. Their rei)ort may be 
found in Senate Executive Document No. 07, 49t/i. Congress, \st session. 


ASTEONOMY. 


439 


Warner Observatory . — The 16-inch refractor has been used for the 
past three years mainly in the search for new nebulae. A catalogue of 
some 200 faint nebulae has been published. 

Washburn Observatory . — “ The third volume of the ^ Publications of 
the Washburn Observatory,’ lately issued, gives the results of the work 
of 1884. About 1,800 observations were made with the Eepsold meri- 
dian-circle upon the Gesellschaft southern fundamental stars and the 
Leyden Cape of Good Hope refraction-stars. The instrumental con- 
stants are given for each observing day, and an investigation of the 
zenith-distance micrometer-screw and of the horizontal flexure of the 
instrument. In the cold winter weather of Wisconsin the micrometer- 
springs turned out too weak to pull the slides, and had to be replaced with 
stiffer ones. The probable error of a single declination is now reduced 
to 0"*4, a great improvement over that noted in vol. ii. ; and a correc- 
tion of +0"-30 ±0"'026 to the constant of the ‘ Pulkowa refractions? 
seems to be called for by the observations of 1884 to suit the atmosphere 
over Madison. Professor Holden expresses his continued satisfaction 
with the Eepsold meridian-circle, and appears to be making a very 
thorough study of it ; and in this his example might well be followed 
with profit by some of our older established observatories. Two deter- 
minations of the latitude by Mr. G. 0. Comstock are giveu — one from 
Professor Holden’s and his own observations with the zenith-telescope, 
the other from his own with the prime- vertical transit, using both re- 
flected and direct observations ; the declinations in both cases being 
those of Auwers’ system. They come out respectively -t-43o 4' 36"-97 ± 
0''-07 and -f43o 4' 36"’99±0"-06, remarkably accordant results. The 
fifth part of the volume is a ‘ Catalogue of 1,001 southern stars for 1850 0 
from observations by Signor P. Tacchini, at Palermo, in the years 1867, 
1868, 1869,’ by Eev. Father Hagen, S. J., and Edward S. Holden. The 
original observations had never been reduced to mean place, but being 
good ones and in a part of the sky where needed, we have here the 
anomaly of European work reduced and published in this country; and 
Father Hagen and Professor Holden are to be highly commended for 
making it available, while its comparison with Oeltzen’s Argelander 
(south) and the Washington zones served to detect many errors in these 
catalogues. The sixth part gives the observations of 437 southern 
stars made with the Washington transit-circle, and also the position of 
the same stars (whenever occurring) from the catalogues of Yarnall, 
Gould’s zones, and Stone, all the positions being reduced to 1850.0 by 
Father Hagen. This is the first opportunity for easy comparison on a 
large scale between these four systems of southern declinations, and 
the comparison develops the following important diflferences of north 
polar-distance : — 

Washington— Yarnall =-l-l"'12 (from 220 stars). 

Washington— Gould (Z. C.) = -l-l"-96 (from 215 stars). 

Washington— Stone =-|-l"-00 (from 238 stars).

SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1885. 


- - - “ The volume closes with a count of the Durchmusterung 
stars between — 2° and -f 13°, a determination of the constants of some 
of the other instruments, meteorological observations for 1884, a sum- 
mary of the same as taken at Madioon continuously from 1853 to 1884, 
and is throughout a highly creditable publication.” - - - {Science, 
November 20, 1885.) 

Willets Point Observatory. — The astronomical observations made dur- 
ing 1885 were of the same nature as those described at some length for 
the preceding year in the “Account of the Progress in Astronomy in 
1884.” The observatory is established for training engineer officers in 
the applications of practical astronomy to geodesy. The course of in- 
struction, as well as the arrangement of the observatory liuilding and 
its equipment (described and illustrated with a plan of the observatory 
in General order No. 3, series of 1881, and Printed order No. 3, series of 
1882), may well be taken as a model in this branch of astronomy. A 
large number of latitude observations made by different observers from 
1880 to 1884, and apparently showing a steady decrease in the latitude 
of the post, has been submitted to a critical discussion by Miss Alice 
Lamb, of the Washburn Observatory. By selecting the best determined 
stars, and by rejecting the observations with one of the instruments, 
and the work of some observers, whose probable errors are about twice 
as large as the probable errors of those whose work is retained, she 
concludes that there is strong reason to attribute the systematic change 
to errors of observation rather than to a real diminution of the latitude. 

Yale College Observatory, — The following is a brief statement of the 
work accomplished or in progress under the direction of Dr. W. L. 
Elkins, who has charge of the heliometer, the only instrument of that 
class, we believe, in operation in this country. 

The principal object of research has been the triangulatiou of the 
Pleiades, to which work the instrument was devoted from September, 
1884, to March, 1885. It was originally intended to confine the investi- 
gation to the stars measured at Konigsberg; the scheme has been ex- 
tended, however, to include all the stars in the Bonn Durchmusterung, 
within certain limits, down to the magnitude 9-2, making sixty-nine stars 
in all. The reductions are in a forward state. 

Other observations are reported : 

Measures of the Moon from neighboring stars, diameters of the Moon, 
diameters of Venus, and the outer ring of Saturn, and a series of ob- 
servations of Titan referred to its primary, which is being continued by 
Mr. A. Hall, jr. 

There have been various additions made to the working appliances 
of the instrument. The oil-lamps illuminating the scales and circles 
have been replaced by half-candle incandescent lamps. The most im- 
portant addition is, however, the registering micrometer, which Messrs. 
Eepsold have made for reading the scales. The principle consists in

impressing on a Morse fillet the figures and divisions of the micrometer 
head along with those of a fixed index. 

The instrument is now being devoted to systematic investigations in 
stellar parallax, and work is progressing, which will furnish, it is hoped, 
reliable values of the parallaxes of the ten stars of the 1st magnitude 
in the Northern Hemisphere referred to neighboring stars of about the 
8th magnitude. 

Zurich . — The sun-spots are assiduously observed here. The maximum 
occurred in December, 1883, to January, 1884. 

ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS. 

Wire-gauze screens as photometers . — “ Of late years the use of wire- 
gauze screens, one or more in number, over objectives has come into 
use for several purposes. Over one of the halves of a heliometer-objec- 
tive they are used to reduce the image of a bright star to approximate 
equality with that of a fainter star from the other half, an essential con- 
dition for the most accurate superposition of the two images. With a 
meridian circle they are used to reduce the brighter stars to an approx- 
imate equality with the faintest that can be observed with satisfactory 
precision, or to investigate the difference of personal equation for dif- 
ferent magnitudes by taking different tallies of transit- wires, with screen 
off and on, at the same transit. In the latter case Professor Holden 
points out the necessity {Astron. Nachr. 2690) of changing the illumina- 
tion of the field with the change of screen, so that each magnitude may 
show against its customary degree of color or brilliancy of background. 
Such screens may also be used for photometric purposes when once 
their coefficients of transmission have been determined. Those having 
occasion to use them in this way will do well to consult a paper by Pro- 
fe.'^sor Langley {Amer. Journ. Sc., xxx, 210) on this subject. In this it 
is shown that the effective transmission coefficients are decidedly dif- 
ferent according as the luminous image is an extended surface or prac- 
tically a point like a star. In the latter case there is a central image 
surrounded by a system of diffraction images, into which a large part 
of the light goes ; so much so, that Professor Langley found that a screen 
(of which one and two thicknesses transmitted -47 and *21 respectively 
of the full light upon a surface) gave only -18 and *02 for one and two 
thicknesses, respectively, when measured by the brilliancy of the cen- 
tral image of a small pin-hole as a source of light.” {Science.) 

The defining power of telescopes . — Quite a warm discussion has been 
going on in the columns of the Observatory and Sidereal Messenger on 
the relative merits of small and large telescopes for the study of plan- 
etary detail. The controversy seems to have arisen from a statement 
by Mr. Denning to the effect that “apertures of from 6 to 8 inches seem 
able to compete with the most powerful instruments ever constructed.” 
The true state of the case appears to be given in a note by Professor

SCIENTIFIC EECOED FOE 1885. 


Young {Observatory, Vin: 173, May, 1886): On the whole, I find also 

true what Mr. Clark told me would be the case on first mounting our 
23-inch instrument, that I can almost always see icith the 23 inch everything 
I can See with the 9^-ineh, under the same atmospheric conditions, and see 
it better ; — if the seeing is bad, only a little better, — if good, immensely 
better. The only exceptions are in the case of objects which require a 
very low power, lower than any that can be obtained with the eye-pieces 
of the large telescope.” 

The great Pulkowa refractor. — “M. Struve was chiefly occupied during 
the year with work incidental to the installation of the great 30-inch 
refractor. It was anticipated that by September, 1884, things would 
be in such a state that it would be possible to begin to observe with 
this gigantic instrument; but, owing to various delays, chiefly connected 
with the construction of the dome, it was not until the end of Septem- 
ber that the Eepsolds could be invited to come to Pulkowa to superin- 
tend the work of erecting the telescope; this was accomplished very 
successfully by them in about three weeks. And M. Struve expresses 
himself as greatly pleased with the ease with which the telescope can 
be set, with the equality of the illumination on all its parts from a sin- 
gle lamp, with the accuracy with which the driving-clock performs, and 
with the facilities for altering the telescope into a powerful spectroscope; 
so that this great instrument may be regarded as the successful out- 
come of the highest skill of modern art in this department. Further 
work on the dome was interrupted by the approach of winter. - - - 
At present the dome is moved by hand ; it is hoped, however, that this 
may eventually be done by electricity, and that a motive power will 
thus be obtained sufficient to overcome the hindrances to the rotation 
of the dome arising from snow and frost. From investigations made 
by H. Struve it appears that the position of the polar axis is correct to 
a fraction of a minute, that the change in focal length of the instrument 
during the winter is but trifling, and that, notwithstanding the great 
weight of the object-glass and of the eye-end, the flexure of the tele- 
scope is so small as to be practically insensible. M. Struve proposes to 
use the great refractor for observing such double-stars as are beyond 
the reach of the 15-inch equatorial, and to undertake observations of 
certain interesting nebulae, as well as spectroscopic researches on stars 
in cases where the great optical power of the instrument will make the 
observations of special value.” {Observatory.) 

“ Science ” (vi : 306) publishes a letter from Dr. Otto Struve to Alvan 
Clark & Sons, from which we make the following extract : “lam asked 
by the Covernment to inform you that, in acknowledgment of the ex- 
cellent performances of the great object-glass furnished for Pulkowa 
by your firm. His Majesty the Emperor has been graciously pleased to 
confer upon you the golden honorary medal of the empire. The value 
of this gift is enhanced by the circumstance that this medal is given

very rarely and only for quite extraordinary merits. You iind Eepsold 
are the first who will receive it from the present Emperor, Alexander 
III.” - - - 

“You will be pleased to hear that with the 30-inch refractor in good 
nights all the most difficult double-stars discovered by Burnham with 
the Washington refractor can be easily measured.” 

Illumination by means of the electric light. — In regard to the applica- 
tion of electricity to illuminating the microscopes and field of view of 
a large fixed instrument, Dr. Gill, of the Cape Observatory, says: 
“Electric illumination by small incandescent lamps has been applied 
with complete success to the microscopes and field of the great theodo- 
lite with which the azimuth observations are made. The electricity is 
supplied to the lamps from a storage battery, which is charged dur- 
ing daytime two or three times a week by a small Grove battery. The 
success of the experiment has been complete. The whole arrangement 
is so simple, clean, and convenient, and the advantages to accuracy of 
observation by perfect uniformity of light, freedom from flicker, glare, 
and heat can only be fully appreciated after trial.” 

Method of supporting a mercury trough for reflection observations. * — 
“ The observation of the nadir has hitherto been almost impossible at 
the Paris Observatory, owing to the disturbance of the mercury caused 
by the traffic in the neighboring streets. Lately, however, M. Gautier 
has devised a very simple arrangement by which this is obviated. The 
new apparatus consists of two cylindrical basins placed one above the 
other, the lower one, which contains the supply of mercury, having a 
slightly larger diameter than the upper. The bottom of the lower basin 
is pierced at its center to admit a screw which projects in a vertical di- 
rection into the inside and is fixed in that position. A cylinder, fixed 
as an axis to the bottom of the smaller basin, is tapped to fit the pro- 
jecting screw, and thus, by turning this basin round its axis, it can be 
raised or lowered in the larger vessel so as to obtain a supply of mer- 
cury in it (by means of an opening provided for the purpose) sufficient 
for observation, whilst the oscillations of the ground. Admiral Mouchez 
states in the paper before us, are completely counteracted by the ‘ demi- 
flottage’ of the second basin.” {Observatory.) 

Hough’’ 8 printing chronograph. — At the Ann Arbor meeting of the Ameri - 
can Association, Professor Hough read a paper on the printing chrono- 
graph that he has invented. He has given a description of the instru- 
ment in his report as director of the Dearborn Observatory for 1885. The 
instrument is designed to print on a fillet of paper, minutes, seconds, atjd 
hundredths of seconds, indicated by the clock which controls it, at any 
iustant-that an observing key is closed by the observer’s finger. The 
impression is made from the surface of three continuously running type 
wheels, the swiftest of which revolves once per second. The recent im-

provements consist in engraved type on the face of the wheels in place 
of the rubber ones used at first, and Of the substitution of a direct blow 
by an electro-magnet upon the type-wheel fillet, thus making the appa- 
ratus much more light and compact than the old form. The mean of 
the seconds and hundredths may be taken directly on the fillet without 
transference to books. Professor Hough states that the instrument has 
proved perfectly reliable. 

Flexure of transit instruments . — At the same meeting of the American 
Association a paper was presented by Professor Harkness on the gen- 
eral subject of the flexure of transit instruments. Professor Harkness’s 
thorough investigation of this subject has just been published as Ap- 
pendix III to the ^‘Washington Observations” for 1882. 

Optical worTis of Feil & Mantois. — We learn from F Astronomic that 
M. Charles Feil has, after some years’ absence, returned to the active 
management of his celebrated manufactory of optical glass in Paris, the 
new firm being “Feil pere et Mantois.” M. Feil is grandson of M. Gui- 
naud,the founder of the house in 1827. The new firm succeeded in ob- 
taining a crown disk of the requisite size for the Lick 36-inch glass, 
having already furnished to MM. Henry the disk for the 30-inch objec- 
tive for the ilice Observatory. 

Micrometer. — Mr. Chandler contributes to volume 11 of the Memoirs 
of the American Academy a valuable paper on the “Square-bar mi- 
crometer. ” 

MISCELLANEOUS. 

Astronomical prizes . — The Lalande prize of the Paris Academic des 
Sciences has been decreed to M. Thollon for his great map of the solar 
spectrum. This map, which has so far demanded four years of uninter- 
rupted work, extends from A to h, and contains 3,200 lines, 900 of which 
M. Thollon has been able to identify as of telluric origin. The Damoi- 
seau prize is reserved, no memoir having been ofi'ered for it. The sub- 
ject proposed is the same as in former years — a revision of the theory 
of the satellites of Jupiter, a discussion of observations with special 
reference to the direct determination of the velocity of light, and 
lastly, the construction of particular tables for each satellite. The 
Yalz prize has been awarded to Dr. Sporer for his researches on sun 
spots, his discovery of the striking relationship between the distribu- 
tion of the spots in latitude and the epochs of their maxima and minima 
receiving special notice. {Fature.) 

The award of the Draper medal, made for the first time, was most 
appropriately bestowed on Prof. S. P. Langley, of Allegheny, for his re- 
searches and discoveries in solar radiation. 

The Warner prizes awarded in 1885 were two, of $200 each, to Mr. 
E. E. Barnard, for the discovery of Comet 1885 II, and Comet e 1885, 
and two, of $200 each, to Mr. W. R. Brooks, for the discovery of Comets 
1885 III, and 1885 Y. Mr. Warner has just given four prizes, aggre-

gating $450, for essays on the remarkable “red sunsets” which have been 
prevalent during the past few years, and medals have been awarded 
to a number of other competitors. The total amount that has been 
awarded by Mr. Warner for astronomical prizes since 1880, including a 
small amount for the expenses of judges, is $3,750. The Warner comet 
prize is continued from March 1, 1886, to March 1, 1887. It is reduced to 
$100, but is open to the world. 

On the apparent increase of size of the su7i, moon, and constellations 
when seen at the horizon. {From the Bulletin de VAcademie royale 
fie Belgique .) — “The apparent increase of the diameter of the sun 
or moon is ordinarily attributed to the elliptical form of the celes- 
tial sphere. According to the author this explanation was given as 
early as the eleventh century in the Optics of Alhazen. But by experi- 
ments, comparing in a dark room the distances of two electric sparks 
at the height of the eye and near the ceiling, M. Stroobant was led to 
the conclusion that any object seen in the zenith appears only eight- 
tenths as large as when seen at the horizon. But there is another fac- 
tor which should be taken into account, that is, the variable brightness 
of the star. The author thinks that a special study should be made of 
these very interesting physiological phenomena.” {Bull. Astron., April, 
1885.) 

Sammlung populaerer Astronomische Mittheilungen. — The eminent di- 
rector of the Berlin Observatory HerrFoerster, has collected in this vol- 
ume a series of scientific notices of a popular character, which have ap- 
peared since 1880 in successive volumes of the oflScial calendar {Nomnal- 
Kalender). It contains a clear exposition of the state of our knowledge 
of the fixed stars, their distances, and their distribution in space ; an 
article upon the limits of our perceptions of celestial objects ; some in- 
teresting remarks upon the auroras, the zodiacal light, and the recent 
comets. In reviewing these notices, we are struck with the multiplicity 
and the importance of the problems offered us by modern astronomy, 
and are tempted to ask, with Herr Foerster, if the number of those at 
work at these problems is not becoming too small for the task. 

An index to astronomical literature. — The need of some systematic 
index to the current literature of astronomy (to say nothing of the 
desired extension of the Eoyal Society’s catalogue, or the completion 
of Houzeau’s work) is more strongly felt year by year ; and the difficulty 
is aggravated by the poor and insufllcient indexes furnished with most 
astronomical publications. General periodical literature is provided for 
by Poole’s Index, which is kept up to date by the Co-operative Index 
to Periodicals ; and a committee of the American Association on index- 
ing chemical literature reports each year favorable progress. It seems 
highly desirable that some similar co-operation should be organized 
among astronomers,

In consequence of the early publication of this sumiuary it has been 
impossible to make it as full as the author had intended, especially with 
respect to foreign publications. .In its preparation the following have 
been carefully examined, viz : Science, vols. v, Vi ; Nature, vols. xxxt,

ography may be regarded as complete, and all important articles are 
noticed in the summary. Other periodicals and books have been con- 
sulted as opportunity offered, but without a full examination. The 
bibliography attached to the present summary also contains some titles 
which properly should have been included in that of last year, but which 
had not then come to the author’s notice ; and in like manner omissions 
ill the present list will be supplied, so far as possible, in a future issue.

SCIENTIFIC RECOKD FOR 1885. 


VULCANOLOGY. 

The volcanic activity during 3885 continued to be of a very moderate 
character, as had been the case in 3.884, and again the East Indies ap- 
pears to have been the scene of its most violent development. 

In April, 1885, the state of Krakatoa caused some anxiety, as subter- 
ranean sounds were heard in the neighborhood day after day, but no 
outbreak occurred. {Nature^ xxxii : 161.) 

On April 17 and 18 a violent eruption of Smeru, the largest and most 
active volcano in Java, occurred, by which the side of the mountain for 
one-third of the way down was described as burst open and emitting 
lava and mud. {XaturCj xxxii : 101.) 

Several other Javanese volcanoes also manifested signs of activity, 
which was again further reported as recurring in June and July, es- 
pecially by another eruption of Smeru on July 8 and 9. Accounts of 
these eruptions are meager and vague, but they a^jparently involved 
the destruction of many coffee plantations, and some loss of life. {Na- 
ture, XXXII: 403 ; La Nature, ll: 102.) 

On May 2, 1885, lava began to flow from a rent in the side of the cone 
of eruption of Vesuvius, and continued for some days. According to 
Johnston Lavis, who visited the spot, this outburst of lava did not in- 
dicate any great increase of volcanic activity, but was simply the break- 
ing through the cone of a dike which had been in process of slow forma- 
tion during several years, being thus a repetition of what happened in 
December, 1881., {Nature, xxxii: 55, 108.) The lava came near the 
station of the mountain railway, but did not damage the road, although 
its use was interrupted for a time. {La Nature, i: 398.) . 

On the morning of July 23, 1885, an eruption of Cotoi)axi occurred, 
with considerable emission of lava, which caused some damage and loss 
of life, but it is not yet known how great. {Nature, xxxii : 375, 428.) 

Grewingk, the volcano at Bogoslofif Island, was seen by Lieutenant 
Stoney’s exploring party in the summer of 1885. It was emitting less 
smoke than in the previous year, but no other important change was 
noticed. {Science, Yi: 279.) 

Advices from Alaska in the summer also report the volcano of Gher- 
nabura, or St. Augustin, in Cook’s Inlet, as still pouring out smoke 
and steam from innumerable fissures. {Science, vi: 95.) 

The New Zealand Herald, of November 3, 1885, contained an account 
of a new volcano which has appeared iu. the Pacific Ocean. It burst 
forth on October 12 or 13, 1885, about fourteen or fifteen miles north- 
northwest of the island of Honga Tonga in the Friendly Group. It was 
visited on October 14 by a party from Tonga, and was found to have 
formed an island two or three miles long and some sixty feet high. As 
it was ill continuous eruption, of course a close examination was im- 
possible, The position of this new volcano is in latitude 20° 2P south, 
longitude 175° 28' west. {Science, vii: 69.)

The first part of Verbeek’s Eeport on the Krakatoa eruption, issued 
by the Dutch East Indian Government (Batavia, 1884), dealt with the 
prior history of the island and the events of the catastrophe itself, leavi iig- 
to the second part the scientific results of the investigation. The edi- 
tor examined 1,300 reports of eye-witnesses, and has endeavored from 
them to construct a chronological statement of the events preceding and 
accompanying the eruption. {Nature^ xxxi: 279.) The second part 
has now been completed, and has fully realized the expectations raised 
by the publication of the first part. It contains twenty-five colored draw- 
ings and forty-three maps, and reflects the greatest credit not only on the 
author, but on the Dutch Indian Government which sent him to study 
the causes and effects of this catastrophe, and which so efficiently aided 
him in the work. A few of his conclusions may be mentioned here. 
Kiakatoa lies at the intersection of three fissures in the earth’s crust, 
and the earthquake of September 1, 1880, which damaged the light house 
on Java’s First Point, probably affected the Sunda fissure and facilitated 
the entrance of greater quantities of water to the volcanic furnace be- 
neath. Here may be found the remote cause of the outburst of 1883. 
The geology of Krakatoa is presented by two maps and four sections 
showing different, stages of its development, the formation of the peak 
Kakata by a lateral eruption, the addition of the two parasitic cones of 
Danan and Perbvewatan, and finally their destruction by the explosion 
of 1883. The first three stages antedate any authentic records. In the 
last stage Perbvewatan became active in May, 1883, Danan joined it in 
June, and in August both these with half of Eakata were destroyed and 
are now covered by the sea. Portions of the pumice from the eruption 
were carried westward to the coast of Africa. Another ijortion, after 
floating for mouths in the straits, was, in 1884, driven eastward, and in 
1885 was encountered in the Pacific Ocean near the Caroline Islands. 
{Nature^ xxxi; 288.) The author expected that this might reach the 
west coast of America early in 1886. The distance to which the explo- 
sions were heard is illustrated by a map, and the curious fact that certain 
detonations were heard at distant places and not noticed at nearer ones 
is attributed to the presence of a dense ash cloud surrounding the peak 
and checking the transmission of sound through the lower atmosphere. 
About seventy images are devoted to a discussion of the atmospheric wave 
which made the circuit of the globe. With the aid of accurate barograms 
from Sydney, K. S. W., and from Batavia he was able to calculate the 
hour of the greatest explosion and origin of the wave as 10 hours 2 min- 
utes a. m., Krakatoa time. Forty places are named where the passage 
of the air-wave was recorded by barometers. Treating of changes in 
the sea bottom, he says the northern part of Krakatoa is now covered 
by the sea to a depth of 200 to 300 meters, and within the ring of islands 
which are fragments of the old crater-ring an area of 41 square kilom- 
eters has subsided. Outside these islands also the sea is deeper than 
formerly over an area of 34 square kilometers, so that in all there has 


474 


SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1885. 


been a subsidence of about 75 square kilometers. There has been no 
elevation of the sea bottom other than that caused by the fallen mate- 
rials ejected from the volcano. After a discussion of the great sea- 
waves which caused so much devastation, and the greatest of which 
started at 10 hours 2 minutes a. m., the time of the greatest explosion, 
a chapter is devoted to other volcanic phenomena taking place during 
the Krakatoa eruption, within or beyond the Indian Archipelago, even 
to the antipodes, especially other volcanoes in Sumatra and Java and 
earthquakes in Australia. In conclusion the author maintains the doc- 
trine that part of our globe is still in a molten state, and disputes the 
theory that the heat of the volcano is entirely due to chemical action. 
{Nature, xxxii ; 601.) A review of Yerbeek’s work by E. Metzger, is 
published in Petermann’s Mittheilungen, 1886, Hft. i. 

In a series of articles in La Nature M. Breon gives a very interesting 
account of the visit made by M. Oorthals and himself to the Strait of 
Sunda and Krakatoa in May, 1884, being sent out by the French min- 
ister of public instruction. The apparent division of the small island 
Dwars-iu-den-Weg into four fragments was found to consist simply in 
the denudation of the low parts of the island of their verdure by 
the great sea-wave, while the higher portions escaped. At the head of 
Lampong Bay they found Telok Betong entirely destroyed, and the 
place where it stood now occupied by a marsh. Passing up the course 
of the small river which empties into this bay, they found the steamer 
Barrow stranded across the stream and surrounded by a luxuriant 
growth of tropical vegetation. The island of Sebesie was covered with 
ashes to a depth of ten meters, and every one of its 2,000 inhabitants 
perished. In one place the visitors came upon the remains of a village 
where were found the skeletons of fifty victims of the catastrophe. The 
ephemeral islands of Steers and Oalmeyer had already disappeared be- 
neath the waves, having endured less than a year. Coming to Kra- 
katoa its condition is described. The frequent fall of stones down its 
sides, simulating renewed volcanic activity, was attributed to the in- 
fluence of solar heat causing unequal expansion. The phenomenon 
w'as at its maximum when the mountain was exposed to the direct rays 
of the sun, and almost ceased during the night. They landed upon 
Krakatoa, and also upon Yerlaten and Lang islands, and although nine 
months had elapsed, the recent deposits still exhibited an elevated 
temperature in places. The account of their visit closes with a resume 
of the geological characteristics of Krakatoa. It is illustrated by a 
number of views reproduced from photographs. A condensed account 
of the above is reproduced in Science (vi: 291). 

Professor Forel admits as not impossible that the Krakatoa explosion 
was the origin of certain subterranean noises heard on August 28, 1883, 
at the island of Caiman Brae, in the Lesser Antilles, situated near the 
antipodes of Krakatoa. Observers compared the noise to that of a dis- 
tant cannonade. It agreed tolerably well in time with the Krakatoa 


VULCANOLOGY AND SEISMOLOGY.

explosion, and there was no other volcanic eruption to which it could 
be attributed, its connection with the known eruptions of Ometepec or 
of Cotopaxi or with some otherwise unnoticed submarine eruption being- 
considered and rejected. {Nature, xxxi: 483 ; La Nature, i: 362.) 

Mr. Henry Cecil suggests that if the synchronism of these noises at 
Caiman Brae and Bjakatoa is admitted it does not follow that the noise 
was propagated from Ea-akatoa through the globe. Both may have 
originated from a disturbance taking place deep within the earth. 
{Nature xxx t: 506.) Similar subterranean detonations were reported 
as heard on August 27 and 28 in San Domingo, in San Salvador, and at 
Antioquia, in Colombia. {Compt. Bend., C: 1314, 1315.) 

Dr. Fr. Schneider, of Soerabaya, has discussed {Jahrb. K. K. Geol. 
Eeichsanst. TTien, 1885) the volcanic condition of the Sunda Islands and 
the Moluccas, and thinks that the importance of the Krakatoa eruption 
has been greatly overestimated. Whether in the extent of its earth- 
quake circle, the amount of ashes thrown out, or the distance to which 
the ashes were thrown, it has been much surpassed by other volcanoes 
of Java, notably by the eruption of Temboro in 1815. After discussing 
the probable mode of formation of Java by the junction of three islands 
once separate, he describes in some detail the position and relations of 
the principal Javan volcanoes, especially in relation to the earthquakes 
recorded in their several districts. 

Prof. J. Kiessling, of Hamburg, and F. A. Forel have both published 
valuable, papers on the reddish corona about the sun. Both writers 
conclude that there is no question of the connection of the ring with the 
famous sunset glows and of the origin of both of these phenomena in 
the dust cloud thrown out from Krakatoa. {Science, vi : 159.) 

J. Denza and also A. Boillot, commenting before the Paris Academy on 
the reappearance of the sunglows in the summer of 1885, think they are 
not due to Krakatoa dust but 'to vapor of water. {Compt. Bend., ci: 
1032.) 

In Nature there is figured and described some of the apparatus by 
means of which Professor Kiessling produced artificially effects similar 
to the cloud glows. It consists essentially of a glass globe through 
which a beam of light from a heliostat may be passed and within which 
The desired condition of suspended dust or vapor may be produced. 
{Nature, xxxi: 439.) 

C. E. Dutton describes, from personal observation, the appearance 
l»re8euted in the summer of 1885, by Feather Lake, Plumas County, 
California. This was thought to have been the scene of the most recent 
volcanic eruption within the limits of the United States, stated by J. 
B. Trask to have occurred in 1850. The lava emitted forms a field about 
three and a quarter miles long by one mile wide, with an average thick- 
ness of over 100 feet. The cone of scorise and lapilli covering the vent 
is 600 feet high and of extremely i)erfect form, showing as yet no rain 
channels even. For a si)ace of four or five hundred yards from it the 


476 


SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1885. 


trees were all killed and their fallen and partly decayed trunks are still 
lying on the ground. All appearances confirm the date assigned by 
Trask, although at that time it was not probably seen by any persons 
but the Indians. {Science, vi: 40.) 

George Davidson adds to this accounts of smoke seen from a distance 
to issue from Mount Baker in 1854, 1858, and 1870, and seeming to in- 
dicate eruptions of that mountain, but the locality has not been visited 
and no details of them are known. It is not impossible that still other 
evidences of recent volcanic activity may be found in those sections of 
our country as they come to be more fully explored. {Science, vi: 262.) 

In the narrative (vol. i) of the Challenger Expedition the volcano of 
Camiguin Island, which burst forth in 1871, is described and a plate 
given, which is reproduced in Nature, xxxii : 250. 

An English Parliamentary blue book (Corea, No. 3, 1885) contains 
a description by Mr. Carles, the vice-consul at Seoul, of a vast lava field 
in Corea, which is said to exceed even those in Iceland. {Nature, xxxtt : 
403.) 

In a memoir of 137 pages printed in the Fouvth Annual Report of the 
United States Geological Survey, Captain Dutton gives a detailed ac- 
count of his visit to and examination of the volcanoes of the Sandwich 
Islands in 1882, aud applies the results to a discussion of the volcanic 
problem. He examines the various theories suggested by different writers 
to account for the production of volcanoes, and considers what new light 
is thrown upon each by his observations, but does not pronounce de- 
cidedly in favor of any one of the theories stated. 

At a meeting of the British Royal Society (April 16, 1885), Prof. 
Joseph Prestwich presented an interesting paper “On the agency of 
water in Volcanic Eruptions” and other related topics. Admitting as 
an established fact that the vapor of water plays an important part in 
many volcanic eruptions, it still remaii>s an open question whether its 
agency is to be regarded as primary or secondary, and how it may have 
reached that part of the earth’s crust where its force must be exerted to 
produce an eruption. The author reviews the opinions of Daubeny Mal- 
let and Poulett Scrope, especially of the latter as the explanation most 
generally accepted by geologists. This holds that the outflow of lava 
is caused by the expansion of volumes of steam generated in the molten 
mass beneath the eruptive orifice. The author questions the possibility 
of water penetrating tlie solid crust of the earth to a sufiicient depth to 
reach a molten magma within, finding a main difficulty in thermo-dy- 
namic considerations connected with the excessive pressure which must 
result at comparatively moderate depths and temperatures. But the 
most weighty objection to the theory is found in the absence of any dis- 
tinct relation between the discharge of lava and that of vapor. There 
are numerous instances in the history of Etna, of Santorin, and especi- 
aUy of Mauna Loa where vast discharges of lava have occurred, not 
only' without steam explosions, but with almost the quiet of a water spring. 


VULCANOLOGY AND SEISMOLOGY. 


477 


On the other hand, paroxysmal eruptions often begin with a violent 
burst, followed by a series of explosions, with but little extrusion of lava, 
and sometimes with absolutely none at all, only scoriae being emitted, 
as at Cosagnina and Krakatoa. The author would account for the pres- 
ence of great quantities of water in some eruptions by the admission of 
the surface waters, or sometimes of sea water, to the volcanic duct dur- 
ing the eruption itself, and gives diagrams of the altered water levels 
about a volcano dirring an eruption to show the possibility of such ad- 
missions. Concluding, then, that water plays only a secondary part in 
originating volcanic phenomena, he is inclined to recur to the old hy- 
pothesis of a comparatively thin, flexible earth-crust resting upon a 
molten substratum; but instead of adopting anew the theory of a fluid 
interior to the earth, which iihysical reasoning has shown to be untenable, 
he thinks the phenomena are best accounted for by the supposition of a 
thin crust, resting on a viscid layer also of no great thickness, and wrap- 
l)ing round a solid nucleus. He concludes that the viscid magma thus 
compressed between two solid layers by the secular contraction of the 
globe is extruded where it may find or make an opening. And while 
the extravasation of lava is due to these causes, the presence of vapor 
is due only to the surface and underground waters with which the lava 
comes in contact as it rises through thefvolcanic duct. {N'ature, xxxi : 
.592.) 

Similar opinions as to the part played by water in volcanic outbursts, 
and the source from which the water is derived, were expressed before 
the Geological Society by H. J. Johnston-Lavis. {Nature, xxxil: 69.) 

The discussion of the theoretical form of volcanic cones, begun by Pro- 
fessor Milne in 1878 and 1879 ( Oeol. Mag.), is renewed and carried on by 
George F. Becker. (Am. Jour. Sci., xxx : 283.) Milne had regarded the 
problem as being that of the f<:>rm assumed by loose materials, cinders, 
ashes, etc., and concludes that it would be that generated by the revolu- 
tion of a logarithmic curve round its asymiJtote. But Becker regards the 
mountain as essentially a continuous mass, and deduces the equation of 
the curve, which by its revolution will generate the finite unloaded column 

— X 

of “ least variable resistance,” for which he finds ^ . This 

c 2 

is a special case of the equation = a + B which he has elsewhere 
shown to characterize the arrangement of sheets of rock in a complex 
fault, and which belongs also to several other physical phenomena. On 
comparing graphically this theoretical curve with actual outlines drawn 
from photographs of volcanic cones, as with Fusiyama and Kumagatake 
in .Japan, and Hood and Popocatapetl in America, the similarity of the 
several outlines is at once evident. 

Velain’s book “Les Volcans” is briefly reviewed by Captain Dutton, 
stating the contents of the several chapters, with comments thereon.

SCIENTIFIC EECORD FOR 1885. 


On February 16, 1885, the French Academy of Sciences appointed a 
committee to consider communications regarding volcanic and seismic 
phenomena. The members of this committee are MM. Daubrde, Jamin, 
Hbbert, Fouqud, and A. Gaudry. {Compt. Rend., o : 438.) 

SEISMOLOGY. 

The earthquake of January 2, 1886, in Maryland and West Virginia 
was studied by Professor Eockwood, and the results were published in 
Science (v : 129), with a map of the area affected. It was most severe in 
the southern part of Frederick County, Maryland, and affected an area 
of about 2,600 square miles, whose center was somewhat south of Lees- 
burg, Va. 

On May 13, 1885, and following days, a destructive earthquake oc 
curred in Cashmere, and the series of shocks was renewed at intervals 
for at least a month thereafter. Many villages were destroyed, with 
the formation of crevasses and landslides, and the loss of life reached 
3,081 persons, besides 25,000 sheep and goats and 8,000 cattle. The 
number of dwellings destroyed was estimated at 75,000. The Indian 
Government sent a geological surveyor to report on the scientific 
aspects of this catastrophe. {JSTature, xxxii : 207.) 

The earthquake which has atVacted the most attention during the 
past year occurred in the provinces of Granada and Malaga in Southern 
Spain. It was made the subject of special investigation by commis- 
sions appointed by the Spanish Government and by the French Acad- 
emy of Sciences. The first and most violent shock occurred on the 
evening of December 25, 1884, but the shocks were repeated at frequent 
intervals through the remaining days of December, and through Janu- 
ary, 1885, and even in March and April they were still felt occasionally. 
The connection of this earthquake with the disturbed geological charac- 
ter of the Peninsula was discussed in various places by J. Macpherson, 
A. F. Nogubs, and others, and most interesting results were reached, 
but they cannot be stated with sufficient brevity for insertion here. 
(See Comptes Rendus, La Nature, Nature, &g.) 

The commission appointed by the Spanish Government, as above 
mentioned, made a preliminary report of their labors and conclusions up 
to March 7, 1885. [Bibliography, No. 21.) It forms a pamphlet of 107 
pages octavo, accompanied by two reproductions of photographs of the 
destruction caused by the shock. It deals quiie fully with the matter 
in hand, and states conclusions which, though often only negative, are 
yet of interest. Beginning with a statement of the theories x>ropo8ed 
by various writers to account lor earthquakes, it proceeds to give a de- 
scription of the orography and hydrography of the two provinces of 
Granada and Malaga, and then devotes twenty-one images to the geology 
of the same district, describing in detail the rock formation, with the 
location and direction of its principal fault-lines. The area affected by

and Segovia, toward the west by Cdceres and Huelva, toward the east 
by Valencia and Marcia, and on the south by the Mediterranean; but 
the tremor of the earth was also indicated by instruments even so far 
distant as Rome and Brussels and Wilhelmshaven. {Nature^ xxxi : 491.) 
Examination of the direction of the cracks in the ground and in build- 
ings, as well as of the curves of intensity estimated according to the 
Rossi-Forel scale, leads to the conclusion that the focus is to be found 
in the valley of Zaffaraya, where the greatest damage was caused. The 
latter half of the report is occupied with the physical, magnetic, barom- 
etric, and other phenomena attending the earthquake. The number of 
buildings injured in the two provinces is stated at 17,178, of which 4,399 
are classed as totally destroyed. The injured persons numbered 746 
dead, and 1,485 wounded. In discussing the cause of this earthquake 
the commission accepts the Italian theories, attributing earthquakes to 
the tension of the vapor of water in the subjacent strata. The valley 
of Zaffaraya, indicated above as the probable focus, is a locality where 
much water gathers and easily penetrates beneath the surface, and to 
the vapor of high tension produced from the water here collected in 
deep lying strata are attributed the forces which gave rise to the present 
earthquake. The commission consisted of M. E. de Castro, J. P. Lasala, 
Daniel de Cortdzar, and J. Gonzalo y Tarin. 

On March 2, M. Fouqu^ gave to the French Academy a preliminary 
report on the exploration which the committee under his charge had 
made of the phenomena of the Spanish earthquakes. The committee 
consisted of MM. Fouqu6, Ldvy, Bertrand, Barrois, Offret, Kilian, 
and Bergeron, and was accompanied by M. Breon. This first commu- 
nication speaks only of their journey, the facilities afforded by the Span- 
ish authorities, and certain phenomena observed, reserving the discus- 
sion of theoretical questions to another time. {Compt. Bend.,G: 598.) 

The full reports of the French committee may be found in Comptes 
Rendus Tome c, and besides a general consideration of the phenomena 
and their cause, they include two special reports on the geology of the 
district by members detailed for that purpose. In the general con- 
clusions reached they agree with the Spanish commission, and fix the 
centrum in an elliptical area surrounding Zafiaraya ; but in regard to 
the cause of the disturbance M. Fonqud rejects the theory which at- 
tributes it to the local tension of water vapor, and would refer it rather 
to the general volcanic forces within the globe. 

The Meteorologische Zeitschrift for February, 1885, contained a notice 
by Dr. Eschenhagen on the effect which was apparently produced by 
the Andalusian earthquakes on the magnetic apparatus at Wilhelms- 
liaveii. The effect seems to have been not at all of a magnetic charac- 
ter, but purely mechanical, the delicately suspended magnets acting as 
the pendulum of a seismoscope. Attempts to draw from the observed 
times .some inference as to the rate of propagation of the disturbance

were deprived of value by tbe uncertainty of time at tbe origin in An- 
dalusia. [Nature, xxxi: 491.) 

C. W. 0. Fuchs, in his twentieth annual report [Min. u. Peirog. MittJieil., 
1885) notes the dearth of volcanic phenomena in 1884, there being noth- 
ing worthy of mention except the slightactivity of Vesuvius and Etna, 
and of St. Augustin in Alaska, which are all disposed of in a single 
page, and then describes the earthquakes of the year. His report men- 
tions 123 shocks, distributed in time as follows : winter, 57 (December, 
19; January, 28; February, 10) ; spring, 24 (March 13; April, 7 ; May, 4); 
summer, 21 (June, 5; July, 9; August, 7) ; autumn, 21 (September, 8; 
October, 1 ; November, 12). On fourteen days two or more places were 
affected, and twelve localities were shaken on two or more dates. This 
report mentions only four American earthquakes (March 25, August 10, 
September 18, 20), Professor liockwood’s report for the year not having 
been received by Dr. Fuchs before this was printed. Those earthquakes 
deserving individual mention are: March 24, 1884, in Upper and Cen- 
tral Slavonia, where, in Diakovar and other places, numerous buildings 
suffered injury ; April 22, in England; May 13, in Crevassa, where a 
church and other buildings were destroyed; May 19, on the Persian 
Gulf, in which 200 persons fell victims by the overthrow of their houses ; 
August 10, in the Eastern United States; and the Spanish earthquakes 
in December. In regard to the earthquakes in Spain, Dr. Fuchs dis- 
cusses at some length their relation to the geological structure of the 
Peninsula, concluding that the centrum was not a point, but a line par- 
allel to the Sierras Tejeda and Alraijara. He differs from those writers 
who call these earthquakes the most important iu Europe, thinkingthat 
of the earthquakes which have occurred during the last ten years, those 
of Eelluno, 1873, of Agram, 1880, and of Chios, 1881, are of equal im- 
portance. An appendix mentions Verbeek’s book on Krakatoa, and 
adds to his own previous reports 170 earthquake dates, 80 for 1882, 90 
for 1883. These, however, do not indicate so many hitherto unreported 
earthquakes, as many of them refer to continuous series of light shak- 
ings, and others give additional details regarding earthquakes already 
mentioned in his reports for those years. 

In his Fourteenth Notes on American Earthquakes [Am. Jour. Sci., 
XXIX : 425), Professor Eockwood has collected the records of earthquakes 
for 1884. The list contains 54 items, classified geographically as follows: 
Canadian Provinces, 5; New England, 9; Atlantic States, 5; Missis- 
sippi Valley, 7; PacificCoast, 21; Westlndies,2; Central America and 
Colombia, 3; Peru, 2; Uruguay,!. By seasons they were: winter, 12 
(December, 2; January, 8; February,2); spring, 15 (March, 8; April,7; 
May,0); summer, 8 (June, 4; July,0; August, 4); autumn, 19 (Septem- 
ber, 4; October, 5; November, 10); Bf)ring and summer together, 23; 
autumn a nd winter together, 31, Most of the shocks were light. The only 
ones of destructive importance were : November 5 and G, on the Isthmus 
of Panama and in Colombia, when the damages were estimated from

$250,000 to $400,000, and thecliurch of San Pedro at Cali was wrecked j 
November 22, at Lima, Peru, where many houses were injured, and August 
10, in the Eastern and Middle States, when walls were cracked and chim- 
neys overthrown. Two earthquakes of the year were made the subject 
of special study, and maps of the regions affected are given, showing the 
isoseismals, so far as material for drawing them was at hand. In the 
earthquake of August 10 the area of greater intensity is nearly ellip- 
tical, extending from Hartford, Conn., to West Chester, Pa., and the 
conclusion reached is that this earthquake was due to some rnpture of 
the strata underlying the immediate vicinity of New York City. On 
September 19 an earthquake occurred in Ohio and Indiana, affecting 
an approximately circular area with a diameter of about 400 miles. 
The isoseismals are much more regular in this earthquake than in that 
of August 10, and its cause is referred to the geological anticlinal 
known as the Cincinnati arch, which crosses 'the western part of Ohio 
from south to north. 

M. C. DetaiUe has also published {IP Astronomic, 1886, p. 183) a list of 
earthquakes felt in 1884. It gives 165 dates, and is especially rich for 
South American regions, including very careful reports from Valparaiso. 
It gives reports of 32 shocks at Valparaiso, none of which are contained 
in Eockwood’s nor in Fuchs’ lists. In regard to the earthquakes of 
North America it is much less complete and often inaccurate. 

The catalogue of earthquakes recorded by the Palmier! seismograph 
at the Imperial Meteorological Observatory in Tokio is contained in 
vol. vin of the Transactions of the Seismological Society of Japan. 
It includes 109 shocks (Nos. 498-606) on dates between July 28, 1883, 
and April 25, 1885. For most of them the force and direction is given 
in Palmieri’s scale, with the duration, but without other information. 

The following was compiled from the records of the Meteorological 
Observatory in Tokio. It gives the total number of earthquakes re- 
corded in the several months during the ten years ending December 
10, 1884, as follows : January, 53 ; February, 50 ; March, 73 ; April, 43 ; 
May, 51 ; June, 40 ; July, 36; August, 27 ; September, 15 ; October, 47; 
November, 51 ; December, 60. The average per month for the ten years 
is 45 ; that for the six winter months (October to March) is 56, and that 
for the six summer months is 35, or about 40 per cent, less, which gives 
some support to the notion that earthquakes are more frequent in winter 
than in summer. {Nature, xxxi: 322.) 

The system of seismic observation established in Italy under tbe di- 
rection of M. E. de Eossi includes twenty-eight stations already in op- 
eration and reporting to the Central Geodynamic Observatory at Eome. 
All are provided with delicate instruments, and study not only the sen- 
sible earthquakes, but also, and more particularly, those minute move- 
ments of the ground which are only recorded by the seismograph. 
These movements are already distinguished into two classes: (1) those 
characterized by a very rapid vibration ; (2) those exhibiting a very

slow wave-like motion. {Compt. Bend., c : 758.) The work of this obser- 
vatory is also described in La Nature (i: 863), and illustrated by speci- 
mens of the daily maps issued by the observatory. The maps given are 
those illustrating the phenomena of the earthquake which occurred near 
Modena on February 26, 1885. 

The work of the Swiss Seismological Commission, from its appoint- 
ment in 1879, is summarized by W. M. Davis in Science (v: 196). Among 
other things there will be found here the statement of the scale of 
intensity adopted by the Italian and Swiss observers, and commonly 
known as the Eossi-Forel scale. In forming a number to represent 
the “value” of an earthquake, it is necessary to combine with the 
intensity-scale number others to represent the area affected and the 
number of accessory shocks. For Switzerland the areas are grouped 
by diameters of 5, 50, 100, and 150 kilometers, and the weak, medium, 
and strong shocks are reckoned separately (n, n', n''); then the adopted 
value is V= (intensity scale x area scale) -f n -f 2n' -f- 3n''. Professor 
Davis thinks this formula would be improved by squaring the intensity 
number to offset the much greater intervals between the upper numbers 
of that scale. {Science^ v: 197.) 

The third report of the Swiss Seismological Commission, by Forel, 
covers the years 1883 and 1883. It gives a detailed list of the earth- 
quakes observed during the two years, with the accessory shocks. The 
intensity of each earthquake is marked according to the Eossi-Forel 
scale, and its “value” computed by the formula mentioned above. These 
numbers are tabulated and compared with the mean of the two years 
1880 and 1881, and with the separate numbers for those years. From 
the results the author infers that there was a maximum of seismic 
activity in Switzerland in 1881, which a comparison of the monthly 
values shows to have been in November of that year, and that in 1882 
and 1883 the activity was notably diminished. This was especially so 
in the latter year, in which no earthquake “value” reached even the 
average value for 1881, and the mean “value” for 1883 scarcely exceeded 
one-third of the mean value for 1881. {Arch, des ScL, Phys., et Nat, xm : 
377.) 

M. Montessus, in transmitting to the French Academy his work on 
Central American Earthquakes, published in San Salvador, states, that 
he entered upon the work and collected a large amount of material 
with the purpose of formulating, if possible, the rules by which the in- 
habitants, apparently from meteorological considerations, announce in 
advance the occurrence of an earthquake. He was, however, soon con- 
vinced that the connection between earthquakes and meteorological 
phenomena, if any, is not yet sufficiently understood to base predictions 
upon it, although a hope is expressed that the further study of material 
collected^ may give some results. {Compt. Bend., c: 1312.)

shocks are felt more severely at the surface of the earth than in mines,

J. Le Conte suggests that a reason for it may be found in a principle 
of wave motion published by Airy in 1849. A normal sea wave strik- 
ing against a waU will be reflected, but if a “broken- headed” wave or 
breaker strike such a wall the normal part only will be reflected, while 
the broken part, if it strikes perpendicularly, will be destroyed, or if it 
strike at a small angle, will then run along as a. strong wave clinging 
to the surface of the wall. He regards the surface of the earth as a 
reflector for earthquake waves, and notes that the waves themselves 
are pre-eminently broken waves, and hence ought to follow the above 
law. [Scimce, Vi: 540.) 

A fourteen-page note on the East Anglian earthquake of April 22, 
1884, with two maps, occupied nearly the whole of Symon’s Meteorologi- 
cal Magazine for May, 1884. A full report on the same earthquake by 
R. Meldola and William White, illustrated by numerous photographs, 
was read before the Essex Field Club in March 1885 {Nature, xxxi : 
395). It forms a book of 225 pages and deals very fully with the cir- 
cumstances of the earthquake. It is divided into eight sections, of 
which the first is historical, giving a catalogue of sixty previous British 
earthquakes from A. D. 103 to 1881 ; the second describes the method 
of securing information, and the third and fourth are devoted to the 
phenomena of the shock. In summarizing this portion it is- stated that 
“the main axis of disturbance extends on each side of a line about five 
miles in length, having a direction northeast and southwest from 
Wivenhoe to Pelton.” In other portions of the report the geological 
relations are considered, the effect of the shock on the underground 
waters, and the correspondence in direction of the seismic axis with fault- 
lines and with the coast-line of Essex. In speculating on the cause of 
the earthquake the authors only venture to suggest “ a sudden rupture 
of deep-seated rocks under a. state of strain”; and add — “the precise for- 
mation in which this rupture occurred cannot even be conjectured.” 
{Nature, xxxiii: 265.) 

Dr. H. J. Johnston-Lavis announced the approaching publication, by 
subscription, of a “ Monograph of the Earthquakes of Ischia,” a memoir 
dealing with the seismic disturbances in that island within historic 
times, with special observations on those of 1881 and 1884. {Nature, 
XXXI : 563.) 

Before the Seismological Society of Japan, Professor Koto read a 
paper on “ Movements of the Earth’s Crust,” observed in Japan, con- 
cluding that the south and east coasts are gradually rising, while the 
north and west coasts are subsiding. This phenomenon is no doubt 
connected with the greater seismic activity along the eastern sea- 
board, shown by the fact that almost all of the earthquakes felt at 
Tokio come from the east and southeast. At the same meeting, K. 
Sekiya, who is in charge of the Seismological Observatory of the Uni- 
versity of Tokio, described in detail the earthquake of October 15, 1884, 
which affected an area of 24,728 square miles, and noted its similarity 
to that of February 22, 1880, both originating on the east side of the

Bay of Teclo, and both affecting the same area. {Nature, XXXI : 5l5.) 
Commenting upon this same earthquake, Prof. J. A. Ewing, of Dundee, 
notes that the instrumental record shows an actual motion of the ground 
of 4.3 centimeters, an amount which is in most striking contrast with 
the 6 to 7 millimeters that previous experience in Japan had led him to 
regard as the extreme amount of displacement in ordinary'Tedo earth- 
quakes; {Nature, xxxi : 581.) 

Early in 1885 Professor Ewing received a grant of £100 from the 
Government grant committee with which to institute observations of 
earth movements at Ben Nevis. He proposes to set up apparatus with 
which to look for earth tremors, and also for slow changes of level of 
the ground. {Nature, xxxi : 298.) 

The French Academy of Sciences has proposed as the subject for the 
Vaillant prize the following: “To study the influence which may be 
exerted on earthquakes by the geological state of a country, by the ac- 
tion of water or of other physical causes.” The memoirs competing 
for this prize are to be delivered before June 1, 1886. {Compt. Bend., ci : 
1413.) 

A second conference of persons interested in seismology was called by 
the Director of the United States Geological Survey, and met in Wash- 
ington on November 25, 1885. The conference was presided over by 
Captain Dutton, of the Geological Survey, and included Mr. Hayden, of 
the Survey, Professors Paul, of the Naval Observatory, Mendenhall and 
Marvin, of the Signal Service, Davis, of Cambridge, and Eockwood, of 
Princeton. It was agreed that the most important advance in the study 
of seismic phenomena was to be reached through a distribution of seis- 
moscopes, with sufdciently accurate clocks, over certain areas in the 
United States which have been shown to be most subject to such dis- 
turbances. At the same time the organizatiDn of a large corps of non- 
iiistrumental observers was thought desirable. The work of bibliogra- 
phy was reported to be in a good state of progress, and several seismo- 
scopic instruments were exhibited. {Science, vi: 491.) 

SEISMOMETBT. 

In a long paper printed in the eighth volume of the Transactions 
of the Seismological Society of Japan, Professor Milne has gathered a 
detailed description of ten series of experiments carried on at different 
times from 1881 to 1884, for the purpose of investigating phenomena con- 
nected with earth vibrations. The experiments were all performed in 
or near the city of Tokio, and consisted in originating artificial earth 
vibrations, usually by dropping.a heavy weight or exploding dynamite, 
and then studying the circumstances of their propagation by means 
of the various seismographs devised by himself or Professor Ewing 
or Professor Gray. Some of these experiments have been already de- 
scribed elsewhere by the author {Lend. Phil. Mag.). The paper is closed 
by a statement in six pages of fifty-seven general results, among which 
are these: The first effect upon a seismograph with a single index is an

impulse in a normal direction, and similarly a bracket seismograph ar- 
ranged to indicate normal motion begins its indications before a similar 
instrument indicating transverse motion, implying that the normal 
wave travels more rapidly than the transverse. Near to the origin the 
normal motion is first outwards, then inwards, and the motion inwards 
is greater and more rapid than the motion outwards ; while at a dis- 
tance from the origin the first motion may be inwards, and the two 
phases are practically of equal amplitude. Eoughly speaking, the am- 
plitude of normal motion is inversely as the distance from the origin. 
The laws of transverse motion are practically the same as those of nor- 
mal motion, but less pronounced. Near to the origin the amplitude of 
the transverse motion is less, but the period greater than that of the 
normal motion. The velocity of transmission varies from 200 to 600 feet, 
which is much less than the velocities obtained by Mallet and Abbot. 

On October 10, 1885, Flood Eock in Hell Gate was blown up by dyna- 
mite. The preparations for this event had been going on for ten years, 
and involved the excavation of galleries beneath the rock and the storing 
therein of nearly 300,000 pounds of explosives. It was expected that 
such an explosion would cause vibrations of the earth similar to an earth- 
quake, and as the day for its occurrence approached preparations for 
studying the propagation of this vibration were made both by the offi- 
cers of the Engineers, under whose direction the work was done, and by 
volunteers from the Seismological Conference in Washington, who went 
to New York for the purpose, and established their instruments at such 
points in the neighborhood as were found available. Directors of astro- 
nomical observatories near New York were also requested by them to 
co-operate by watching for the arrival of the earth wave. {Science, vi: 
315.) Unfortunately the firing of the mine was slightly delayed, and 
did not take place until about fourteen minutes after the hour announced. 
This delay interfered seriously with the observations of the volunteer 
observers, a considerable number of whom gave up the watch before the 
explosion occurred, either supposing that the vibration had failed to 
reach them or being deceived by some local tremor. It was, however, 
caught at Princeton, N. J., and at Harvard College. The observations 
obtained by the volunteers were quite discordant, but indicate a much 
higher velocity than was obtained by Mallet, or by General Abbot from 
the Hallett’s Point explosion in 1876. General Abbot had arranged a 
series of observers to Patchogue, L. I., in one direction, and to West 
Point in another, who were in telegraphic communication with the firing 
jioint at Astoria. {Science, vi : 431.) His results, although also discord- 
ant, give velocities much higher than those deduced from natural earth- 
quakes. {Science, vil: 25.) 

An instrument for the automatic registration of earth-tremors and 
earth-ti])s is described by John Milne {Nature, xxxii : 259). Its essen- 
tial parts are a pendulum one meter long, suspended from a tripod about 
5 feet high, and acting upon the short upper arm of a light balanced 


486 


SCIENTIFIC EECOED FOE 1885. 


lever, whose long arm touches a strip of paper covered with a film of 
iodized starch. This paper is carried by clock-work beneath the point, 
and every five minutes the clock sends a galvanic current through the 
pointer and leaves a dot upon the starch film. On examining the rec- 
ords thus made he finds (1) sometimes for days the poinfers are station- 
ary ; (2) sometimes they are in a state of tremor, which may continue 
for ten or twelve hours, and the sparks mark the paper at many points 
in a band several millimeters wide; (3) sometimes the pointer will slowly 
wander from the straight line and then return, but the author is not yet 
certain whether this last is due to a slow earth tip or to local causes. 
The delicate instrumental observations proposed to be made in the 
Takashima mine were found impracticable, and it was then proposed to 
remove the instruments elsewhere. 

K. Sekiya has described a form of Ewing’s duplex pendulum seis- 
mometer, which it is stated can be made at a cost of only about $G, and 
which gives indications agreeing very well with those obtained from the 
more elaborate instrument. {Trans. Seis. 8oc. of Japan., vili: 83.) 

Dr. F. Du Bois haS translated from a paper received from F. Faura, 
of Manila, a descrii)tion of the Cecchi seismograph constructed for the 
observatory there. The apparatus is attached to the perpendicular face 
of a marble slab, and consists of a clock, a vertical pendulum, several 
weights suspended by springs, and a moving sheet of smoked paper. 
The whole is so arranged by a combination of levers and strings that 
any motion, either horizontal or vertical, will start the clock and will 
put in motion the smoked paper, on which the vertical pendulum re- 
cords its vibrations, as does also a spring-suspended weight. The 
arrangement is complicated, needs a number of delicate adjustments, 
must necessarily be expensive, and finally must be entirely reset through- 
out after every shock. {Trans. Seis. Soc. of Japan, viil : 90.) 

A novel seismograph is described by M. Cordenons in La Nature i: 
237. It is intended to record the vertical and horizontal shocks, 
their duration, and the time of the initial shock. It consists of two 
horizontal pendulums to mark vertical motions, and four iuverted pen- 
dulums, each of which last is free to fall only in one direction, the four 
motions being directed along the four sides of a square, so that only 
that one will fall which is in the direction of the earth’s motion. The 
fall of any one of the pendulums suffices by a system of cords to release 
a clock pendulum previously fastened out of the perpendicular, and so 
to start the clock. When once the arrival of an earthquake shock has 
been signaled by the motion of some pendulum, no further record is 
possible until the instrument is reset. It is therefore a seismoscope 
rather than a seismograph. 

W. Werner has given to German readers a good account of the re- 
cent appliances for the instrumental observation of earthquakes, the 
material for which is mostly drawn from Ewing’s memoir on Earthquake 
Measurement. {Zeitsehr.fiir InstrumentenTcunde, v: 217,308.)

VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS AND EARTHQUAKES IN ICELAND 
WITHIN HISTORIC TIMES * 


Translated by Geoege H. Boehmee. 


Very little account is taken in the Icelandic sagas of nature and its 
phenomena, yet already at an early day the volcanoes of Iceland have 
been mentioned. The “speculum regale,” written in Norway in 1230- 
1250, dwells on volcanoes and hot springs in Iceland, and advances some 
superstitious ideas as to their origin. “ The Icelandic Annals ” quote 
volcanic eruptions and violent earthquakes, but without entering into 
details; and a large amount of information on this subject exists only 
in manuscript. 

The first mention by foreign authors of the volcanoes of Iceland are 
found in the “Topographia Hiberniae,” by Giraldus Cambrensis (1187), 
and in “Chrbnicon de Lanercost” (1275), while the earliest descriptions 
of the island were given in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. In 
these the most absurd ideas regarding Iceland and other northern coun- 
tries are advanced, and unlimited fancies and superstitions are displayed 
as regards the Hecla. At about the middle of the sixteenth century 
the brothers Johannes Magnus and Claus Magnus wrote about Iceland, 
and at about the year 1600 Georg Peerson and BlefJcenius published some 
volumes on the same island, in which they distinguish themselves by 
their ridiculous accounts and illusions. They were reported by the 
Icelandic scientist, Arngrimr Jonsson (1568-1648), who, in several works, 
endeavored to give the foreigners a correct idea of the country. But 
it is only since the middle of the eighteenth century, and only by the 
efibrts of Thormodhr Torfason (-1-1719) and Arni Magnusson (-1-1730) 
that the north has commenced to take an interest in the language and 
the history of Iceland. Ole Worm was the first, in Denmark, to write 
something on the remarkable nature of that country. Nevertheless the 
knowledge of it was but very imperfect until the middle of the eighteenth 
century. In 1746, Johan Anderson, burgomaster of Hamburg, published 
a volume on Iceland, in which he corrected many inaccurate ideas, and 
which was followed by the publication, in 1752, of Niels Horrebow’s ex- 
cellent work “TUforladelige Efterretninger om Island.” But no work 
has ever served a better purpose than the “ Reise igjennem Island,” 
Soro, 1772, by Eggert Olafssou and Bijarni Poisson; it has been trans-

lated into French and German, and notwithstanding its antiquity, it is 
still the best source of knowledge of this country. At the close of the 
last century the island was visited by several naturalists, among whom 
we mention N. Mohr and Sveinn Poisson, of whom the latter has left 
some still unpublished works on the volcanoes and glaciers of Iceland. 

The geology of Iceland was not thoroughly studied until the com- 
mencement of the nineteenth century. Among those who devoted 
themselves to this subject we must mention G. S. Mackenzie (1810), C. 
Krug von Mdda (1833), and Eugene Eobert, who, in 1835-’36, was a mem- 
ber of de Gaimard’s expedition. Steenstrup, Hallgrimsson, and Schythe 
visited Iceland in 1839-’40, during which j)eriod Steenstrup investigated 
the fossil plants of the miocene period, which later were described by 
Oswald Heer in his “ Flqra fossilis arctica.” Bjorn Gunnlaugsson also 
contributed considerably to the knowledge of the country by construct- 
ing, during the years 1831-1843, a maj) of the island. In 184G, the year 
following the last eruption of Hecla, the island was visited by three 
celebrated scientists, E. Bunsen, Des Oloizeaux, and Sartorius v.Walters- 
hausen, and during their sojourn they achieved considerable scientific 
results. Th. Kjerulf visited the island in 1850 and G. G. Winkler in 
18.')8. The geologist, F. Zirkel, w'ho explored the island in 1860, fur- 
nished very valuable contributions to the knowledge of the rocks of Ice- 
land. The “ Eeise nach Island,” by Preyer and Zirkel, is one of the best 
descriptions known. Paijkull (1867) constructed the first geological 
map of Iceland, and F. Jonstrup, during his two visits in 1871 and 1876, 
studied several volcanoes and sulphur and coal beds. 

Hallddr Jakobsson (1734-1810) was the first to occupy himself with 
the history of the Icelandic volcanoes, but his work has not been of 
much utility, on account of the frequent inaccuracies in the location of 
volcanoes and the dates of their eruptions. G. Garlieb was engaged 
in similar studies, but his work, too, contains many inaccuracies. Eu- 
gene Eobert, Sabine Baring-Gould, and Zirkel have partly fallen into the 
same mistakes as the preceding authors. The information having 
mostly been obtained in an indirect way, it is not to be wondered at 
that the results are faulty. The Icelandic poet and naturalist, Jonas 
Hallgrimsson, was the first to give a true account of the history of the 
Icelandic volcanoes, but his memoir only exists in manuscript. Many 
Icelanders have given accounts of various volcanic eruptions during the 
past century, but the greater part of these observations are still unpub- 
lished, and are preserved in libraries or otherwise. As regards the 
eruptions of the nineteenth century, J. G. Schythe has given an excel- 
lent account of that of Hecla in 1845, and F. Jonstrup has described 
the volcanoes of Dyngjufjall, Sveinagj4, and M;f’vatn. 

Notwithstanding the many celebrated scientists who have visited 
Iceland, its geology is at present but little known, but this finds an 
explanation in the extent of the country, in the many difficulties which 
present themselves to the traveler, and the limited time at their com- 
mand.

LOCATION OF THE ACTIVE VOLCANOES. 

The interior of Iceland forms a plaiteau of about 630 meters in height, 
which, towards the north, northwest, and east, is cut up iuto a large 
number of fjords and valleys; it slopes gently towards the north- 
northeast (with a mean inclination of 0° 23' 52" between Vatnajokull 
and the promontory of Tjornes) ; and toward the southwest (with an 
inclination of 0° 13' 1" between the plateau of Sprengisandr and the 
mouth of the Thjdrs^) ; while the steepest slopes are on the east and 
northwest sides, where they form abrupt cliffs facing the sea. The 
most elevated portions are covered with glaciers, which occupy a 
superficial surface of 14,000 square kilometers ; the currents of lava 
covering 7,400, of which 3,400 result from the Od^dahraun. Two 
chains of volcanic mountains, the Eeykjanes and the Snaefellsnes, ex- 
tend on both sides of the Gulf of Faxe easterly across the plateau. 
The formation of the east and northwest portions of the island is 
mostly trap, while that of the central portion is soft gravel, with banks 
of palagonite, a formation in which the volcanic phenomena seem to 
be prevalent. Volcanic eruptions appear to be confined to two locali- 
ties, one in the south of the island, running southwest to northeast, 
and the other in the north, running from south to north. Eruptions 
of trachyte have occurred in the eastern portion of the island. Glacial 
and alluvial deposits cover large spaces. There are a large number 
of extinct volcanoes; but we shall confine ourselves to those which 
have been active within historic times. 

We may distinguish eight groups of active volcanoes in Iceland : 

(1) Group of Snaefellsnes {JEXdhovg). 

(2) Group of the Hecla (Hecla, Eandhukambar). 

(3) Group of EeyTcjanes (Thurrhrhraun, Trolladyngja, Eldeyjar). 

(4) Group of Katla (Katla, Eyjafjallajokull*). 

(5) Group of Varmdrdalr. 

(6) Group of the volcanoes soiith of the VatnajoTcull (Oraefajokull, 
Skeidhardijokull, Grimsvatn, Sidhujokull). 

(7) Group of the volcanoes of Odddahraun (Kverkfjall, D^*ngjufjall, 
Sveinagjd). 

(8) Group of the volcanoes of Myvatn (Krafla, Leirhnffkr, Hrossa- 
dalr, Bjamarflag, Daltjall). 

(1) Group of Snaefellsnes. — The only active volcano in this group is 
the Eldhorg (64° 47' Lat. N., 34° 54' Long. W. of Copenhagen), which 
at about the year 950 threw out from a crater of 200 meters in diameter 
and 63 meters depth a current of lava 11,300 meters long by 3,770 meters 
wide. 

(2) Group of the Hecla. — The Hecla (63° 59' N. Lat. and 32° 19' Long. 

• Jokull is the Icelandic ■word for glacier. Eyjafjallajokull, for iut'tance, signifies 
the glacier of Eyjafjall, hut at the same time serves to designate the volcano or 
mountain of that name.

SCIENTIFIC EECORD FOR 1885. 


W. of Copenbagen) is the most celebrated of the Icelandic volcanoes. 
It has been studied by Schythe and Kjerulf. It is located on a chain 
of 23,000 meters in length, rises in three or four terraces to a height of 
1,556 meters, and is surrounded by large lava beds of 680 square kilo- 
meters in extent. A little below the summit are craters which, in 1845, 
were formed in a crevice running southwest to northeast. Parallel 
with the Hecla emerge from the lava five ridges of soft gravel stone, 
all running, partly disconnected, from southwest to northeast; in the 
midst the Hecla rises on a base of 630 meters. The largest streams of 
lava are found on the east slope of the Hecla, on which side the base 
also is more elevated than on the west side. Several series of craters 
appear around the Hecla, and at the foot of the chains of soft gravel 
stone. At Torfajokull, to the east of the Hecla, the remarkable trachyte 
lava current of Hrafntinnuhraun* is met with. The Hecla has had 
eighteen eruptions within historic times. 

The BandhuTcambar (64° 12' N. Lat., 32° ^5' Long. W. of Copenhagen) 
is a volcano extending, like the Hecla, in a direction southwest to north- 
east. Only one eruption (in 1343) is known to have occurred, whereby _ 
a formerly very fertile valley became covered with ashes and pumice 
stone. 

(3) Group of BeyTcjanes . — The peninsula of Eeykjanes should be con- 
sidered a continuation of the Hecla. It is composed of stratified 
masses ; gravel, alternating with trap-rock, forming plateaus of about 
125 meters in height, completely covered with lava, from which rise, in 
a direction from southwest to northeast, a series of volcanoes and cones 
of scoria, reaching to a height of 630 meters, containing several hot 
springs and solfatares. Here, in 1^. Lat. 64° and W. Long. 33° 55', one 
meets with the lava stream of Thurrdrhraun, dating from the year 1000. 
It started from two craters situated in the northwest portion of the 
Hellisheidhi and extended to a distance of 15 kilometers. In its south- 
east portion, 4 kilometers long, it has an inclination of only 1° 50', but 
it then descends with an inclination of 24° to 30°, and from a height 
of 140 meters into the plain of Olfus. Nearly in the middle of the 
peninsula, in 63° 56' N. Lat. and 34° 14' Long. W. of Copenhagen, 
there rises to the northwest of the solfatare of Krisuvik the volcano 
of Trbllad'^ngja. The Icelandic annals mention six eruptions of the 
Trolladyngja, which have been credited to the volcano of Odadha- 
hraun of the same group, but which, according to the investigations of 
Jonas Hallgrimsson, appear to be those of the Eeykjanes. On the 
southwest point of Eeykjanes are several hot si)rings, and in the same 
direction, about llj kilometers from the coast, a series of volcanic 
islands, known under the name of Fugles Kjaer or Eldegar, in the 
neighborhood of which several submarine eruptions, have occurred. 

(4) Group of Katla . — Upon the grand glaciers of Myrdalsjokull (1,320 
square kilometers), separating the district of Skaptafell (Skaptafells- 

* Hrauu designates in Icelandic a current of lava. 


VULCANISM, ETC., IN ICELAND. 


499 


syssel) from that of Eaiig4rvalla, are located two centers of eruption, 
the Ey-jafjallajokull and the Katla. The neighborhood of this group 
consists of sandy deserts and bowlders, which have their origin in the 
glacial movement and in volcanic eruptions. The configuration of 
several districts have in this manner been entirely changed within his- 
toric times. The combined power of the glacial movement and of the 
volcanoes is plainly seen in many instances. At one jdace where for- 
merly quite a considerable fjord existed, there is at present a desert, and 
several small mountains which formerly rose from the coast are at 
present quite a distance away from the sea. The Eyjalfjallajbkull 
(63° 37' 1^. Lat. and W. Long. 32° 16' 18"), to the west, is a truncated 
cone of 1,706 meters in height. The principal crater has tumbled in 
and is filled up with ice. The eruption of 1821 took place from a crevice 
of about 50 meters, on the northwest slope of the mountain. The Katla 
(63° 37' K. Lat., 31° 35' W. Long, is a deep crater, situated in the east- 
ern portion of the M^rdalsjokull, and ordinarily filled with ice. It has 
several times been attempted to closely examine this volcano, but always 
in vain. 

From the Katla, descending to the base of the glacier, extend two 
valleys, the one in a southeasterly direction, towards the M^rdalssandr, 
beyond the isolated mountain Hafrsey, the other one in a southwesterly 
direction, towards the Solheimasandr. The greater part of the water- 
courses issuing from the glaciers at the time of the eruptions descend 
through the valley to the southeast ; still some few find their way 
through the southwesterly valley. The eruptions which in the annals 
have been ascribed to the M;^'rdalsjokull, Midhdalsjokull, Hefdhajokull, 
Selheimajokull, and Katla, should all be credited to the Katla, since 
all these names have been given to the same volcano. Several districts 
and a large number of farms have been destroyed by the eruptions of 
the Katla. Neither the Katla nor the other ice-covered volcanoes in the 
south of Iceland have ever emitted any lava. This, next to the Hecla, 
is the most active volcano, twelve or thirteen eruptions having been 
recorded within historic times. 

(5) Group of Varmdrdalr . — The most violent eruptions ever recorded 
in Iceland within historic times occurred iu 1783, to the northeast of 
the glacier of Myrdalr, in the neighborhood of the sources of the 
SkaptA These eruptions issued from a large number of craters, situ- 
ated to the southwest, north, and east of Mont Laki (64° 2' N. Lat.), and 
throughout a valley named Varmdrdalr, and not from the Skaptarjo- 
kull, as mentioned in most geological manuals, although it is not implied 
that on other occasions eruptions have not taken place from craters iu 
that region of glaciers. The craters which occupy our attention in the 
present case are but imperfectly known. Magnus Stephensen (1784) and 
Sveinn Pdllson (1794) examined several of them superficially. Those of 
the valley of Varmdrdalr extend throughout a length of about 15 kilom- 
eters. The currents of lava whieh were formed are the most extensive 


500 


SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1885. 


ever j^roduced in the world in any single eruption within histoi ic times. 
They cover a track of 397i square kilometers, and in several places are 
from 167 to 188 meters thick. The lava spread towards the south in 
two branches, the westerly one, 83 kilometers long, into the bed of 
the Skaptd, and the easterly one, 38 kilometers long, into that of the 
Hoerf^sfljot. According to Lyell its volume is considerably larger 
than that of Mont Blanc; its mean inclination, according to Elie de 
Beaumont, is 0° 30' ; but in the absence of exact measurements these 
figures can be relied on only approximately. 

(6) Group of volcanoes south of the Vatnajokull. — On the south side of 
the Vatnajokull, in an unknown desert, are several volcanoes, but none 
of them have as yet been examined, and even their exact location is not 
known, with the exception of the highest mountain in Iceland, the 
Orafajdliull, or Hnappafellsjdkull (64° 0' 48" N. Lat. and 29° 20' 10" 
Long, west of Copenhagen), which rises like a promontory on the south 
brink of the Vatnajokull to a height of 1,960 meters. Formerly human 
habitations extended to the foot of the glacier, but these regious have 
been completely devastated by the eruption of 1349. Pdlsson ascended 
the Orsefajdkull in 1793. From all sides extend large glaciers down to 
the low lands. To the west of the Orsefajbkull is the glacier of Skei- 
dhardrjdkull, and still farther to the west that of SidhujokuU; between 
these is the lake of Grimsvdtn. The annals mention several eruptions 
in this region, but exact data are wanting. 

(7) Group of volcanoes of Odddhahraun. — To the north of the Vatua- 
jdkull is the grand lava current of Odddhahraun, covering a surface of 
3,400 square kilometers, and on which a considerable number of craters 
and volcanoes are located, the greater part of which are still unexplored. 
The height of the Odddahraun, above the sea, at the foot of the Vatuajd- 
kull, is 942 meters, but on the inner side only 471 meters. To the north 
of the Vatnajokull, in W. Long. 29° 30', is the volcano Kverkfjall, from 
which eruptions took place in 1717 and 1873, and likely quite frequently 
within historic times. To the northwest of the Kverkfjall rises, at an 
elevation of 1,400 meters above the sea level, the volcanic group of 
D'^ngjvfjall, explored by F. Jonstrup in 1876. These mountains encircle 
the valley of Askja, which has a surface of about 57 square kilometers, 
and an altitude of 1,100 to 1,200 meters. The ground is covered with 
lava beds having, in the east, towards the opening of the valley, an in- 
clination of 1° 26'. In the southeast angle of Askja an abyss of 230 
meters depth has formed, in the middle of which is found a circular 
lake of 1,200 meters in diameter, with a water temperature, in 1876, of 
22° C. On the sides of this pit are craters which erupted in 1875. 

To the north of the Dyngjufjall mountains, to the west of Jokulsd i 
Axarfirdhi, in a flat and sterile plain, named 21'^vatnsdraefi, in which 
there are some ancient craters, an eruption took place in 1875 in the 
crevice of Sveinagjd, in the midst of a grassy plain, whereby a current of 
lava was created, 23,000 meters long and 1,900 meters wide, the volume

of which, according to F. Jonstrup, represents 310,000,000 of cuhic 
meters. Th#* craters are divided into, three groups, of which the south- 
erly is 475 meters, and the northerly 422 meters above sea level. The 
highest crater extended in 1876 to 34 meters above the plain. 

(8) Group of the volcanoes of Myvatn. — The surroundings of the lake 
My vatn constitute a very remarkable volcanic region ; it is nearly entirely 
covered with lava beds strewn over with craters, which give it the ap- 
pearance of a lunar landscape. To the east of the farm of Reylcjahlidh 
stretches out a long chain which terminates in the volcano of Leirhnulcr, 
in the neighborhood of which the grand eruptions of 1724-1730 took 
place. Into the same period fall other eruptions, issuing from the 
Krafla, to the east of the Leirhuukr, from the Hrossadalr, the Bjarnar- 
flag, and from another crater in the vicinity of the BeyTcjahUdliarsel, on 
the east slope of the chain of Balfjall, craters all within a short dis- 
tance from each other and in a right line south of the Leirhnukr. 
Several extensive solfatares occur in the vicinity, especially at Nama- 
fjall. The annals mention besides, still without indicating the locality, 
several eruptions, the greater part of which undoubtedly have taken 
place in the unknown regions which surround the Vatnajbkull. 

The various lists indicate quite a number of volcanic eruptions in 
sections, in which, according to the annals, such phenomena have not 
occurred within historic times. Likewise one might discard the fol- 
lowing localities as places of eruption : Asmundarnupr, Thoreyjarnuj)!-, 
Hofsjokull, Balvjokull, Theistareykir, Fremri Namar, Hverljall, Sand- 
fellsjokull, Mosfell, Herdhubreidh, Skapt^rjokull, Breidhamerkrjokull, 
Thorsmork, and Torfajokull. It is true, there are craters in some of 
these localities, but there is not one historical proof of their eruptions. 
The foreign publications repeat many errors relative to the situations 
of the volcanoes of Iceland, caused by the imperfect knowledge which 
their authors possessed of the topography of this country.

900 (approximately). Eruption of the Katla. The entire region from 
the Eyjar4 and the Hdlmsd to the river K^lm, north of the Alptaver, 
and the district of Dynskdgahverfi were completely devastated. At 
about the same time the sandy plain of Solheima appears to have been 
subjected to the action of water and ice, whereby the course now called 
Jokulsa a Sdlheimasamli seems to have been formed. Several lists 
multiply this eruption, dating them in 894 and 934, bat there is no cer- 
tainty as to the correctness of these dates. 

950 (approximately). Eruption of the JEldborg and formation of the 
lava current of Borgarhraun. The farm of Hripr formerly stood on 
the site of the present crater.

1240. Fifth submarine eruption to the southwest of Beylcjanes. Ac- 
cording to Gisli Oddsson half of the peninsula was destroyed. 

1245. Second eruption of the Katla. Torrents of water were thrown 
upon the plains of Solheima and the fields were covered with cinders 
to a thickness of 16 centimeters. 

1260. Violent earthquake shocks in the north of Iceland. 

1262. Third eruption of the Katla. The volcano hurled out a mass 
of water, ice, and stones,* which, it is said, raised the Solheimasandr 
38 meters. (?) 

1294. Fifth eruption of the Hecla, accompanied by violent earth- 
quakes and formation of crevices. The water in the wells assumed a 
milky white color and the Eangd changed its course. The rivers were 
covered with dross, which the currents carried as far as the Faroe 
Islands. Several hot springs disappeared on this occasion, while others 
were formed. 

1300. Sixth eruption of the Hecla, on the 10th of July. This was one 
of the most violent actions of this volcano. The cinders thrown out 
were carried by the prevailing southwest winds to the north of the 
island, where they caused great destruction, which was followed by a 
famine. For two days complete darkness prevailed, and the Hecla 
underwent considerable changes. On the 30th December an earth- 
quake destroyed the farm of Skardh. Five hundred people, mostly in 
the north of the island, died of the consequences of this eruption. 

* These torrents of water, ice, stones, gravel, and sand, produced by the volcanic 
eruptions in Iceland, are called “ Jokellob,”

1308. Earthquakes in the south of Iceland, destroying eighteen farms 
and killing six people. 

1311. Fourth eruption of the Katla, on the 25th of January, com- 
pletely ravaging the district of L^geyjarhverfi. Earthquake shocks on 
the 10th and 11th of January destroyed fifty-one farms. 

1332. Eruption in the vicinity of the district of Sidha on the 2d of 
December. The exact spot has not been located.

Hengil a hot spring appears, with a circumference of 75 meters. 

1340. Third eruption of the Trdlladyngja. 

1341. Seventh eruption of the Hecla, on the 19th of May, accompanied 
by an enormous fall of cinders, which devastated several districts in the 
surrounding country, while at the same time an earthquake destroyed 
several farms. In the same year an eruption of the Oraefajokull is 
mentioned. 

1343 (approximately). Eruption of the In the adjoin- 

ing valley of Thj6rs4rdalr eleven farms were completely destroyed. 
Of some of them the mins are still in existence. 

1349. Second eruption of the Oraefajokull^ which devastated five 
fertile districts (Herreder). After the ice covering the mountains 
began to melt, the torrents thus formed swept away forty farms and 
two churches, and those which bent their course towards the sea carried 
such a quantity of sand and gravel that a beach had formed after the 
eruption at a place where before the water had a dejith of 56 meters. 
Some lists give the date^ of this eruption in the years 1350 and 1362, 
respectively. 

1360. Fourth eraption of the Trdlladjngja. Pumice stone was car- 
ried westward, towards the sea, as far as M^rar, and the eruption was 
plainly visible at Snaefellsnes. 

1370. Earthquake, causing the tumbling down of twelve farm-houses 
in Olfus. 

1389-’90, Eighth eruption of the Secla. The principal eruption took 
place from two new craters which opened below the farm of Skardh. 
It lasted to the middle of the year 1390 and destroyed two farms. The 
same year saw the fifth eruption of the Trdlladjngja and one of the 
Sidhjdkull. 

1391. Earthquakes at Orimsnes, F16i, and Olfus which were felt to the 
northwest as far as Holtavordhuheidhi. Fourteen farms were seriously 
damaged and three houses caved in. 

1416. Fifth emption of the Katla, with a considerable fall of ashes. 

1422. Sixth submarine explosion southward of Beykjanes. A new 
island was formed, which later on disappeared again.

1477. Eruption in an uninhabited region; in the north of the island 
a heavy fall of ashes followed by a famine. 

1510. Tenth eruption of the Hecla, on the 25th of July. Large masses 
of lava were thrown to a distance of several miles, killing several peo- 
ple. In the same year the sixth eruption of Trblladyngja is recorded. 
These eruptions were followed by dangerous epidemics, to which many 
people fell victims. 

1546. Earthquake at OJ/us, in the commencement of June. Several 
farms were more or less injured. 

1552. Earthquake on the 2d of February. 

1554. Towards the end of May the eleventh eruption of Hecla, or 
rather of the mountain chain forming its northeastern continuance. The 
eruption lasted six hours, and the shocks of earthquake were so fre- 
quent that the people quitted their houses and took up their abodes in 
tents. 

1578. On the 1st of November the twelfth eruption of Hecla, which, 
although feeble, was accompanied by violent shocks of earthquakes 
which destroyed several farms at Olfus. 

1580. Sixth eruption of the Katla, on the 11th of August. Destruction 
of several farm-houses, but no loss of life. The current of water, ice, 
sand, and rocks (Jokellob) thrown out by the volcano took a southeast- 
erly course. 

1581. On the 30th of May, earthquake at Bangdrvellir, demanding 
several victims. 

1583. Seventh submarine explosion southwest of Beyhjanes. 

1584. Violent earthquake. 

1597. Thirteenth eruption of Hecla, commencing on the 3d of Janu- 
uary and lasting until March, while vapor was emitted until July. 
Eighteen columns of fire rose above the mountain, the cinders scat- 
tered over more than half the country, in the west as far as Borgarf- 
jordhr, to the east as far as Lon, and to the north as far as B4rdharvalr, 
and during twelve hours the detonations were audible at the extreme 
north of Iceland. The eruption was accompanied by earthquakesj 
which destroyed several farm-houses at Olfus. A large hot spring (the 
Little Geyser) south of the farm of Reykir disappeared, but another one 
opened on the north side. 

1598. On the 10th of November, the third eruption of Oraefajohull 
and eruption at Orimsvatn (?). A northeast wind carried the ashes as 
far as the Eyjafjordhr.

1624. Earthquake at Fl6i in November ; two farm, buildings were 
destroyed and a large number damaged. 

1625. Seventh eruption of Katla, from the 2d to the 14th of Septem- 
ber. The “ Jokellbb” inundated the plain of Alptaver and surrounded 
the ThyJckvabaejarMaustr and neighboring farms. The ashes were car- 
ried as far as Bergen, Norway. At Skapt4rhunga they collected knee- 
deep. Two districts were ruined. 

1630. Earthquake to the east of Thjorsa in winter ; six lives lost. 

1632. Earthquake in the fall. 

1633. Earthquake in the south, above Olfus.

water-courses in that section carried to the sea large pieces of pumice- 
stone. 

1643. Earthquake near Christmas. 

1657. Earthquake, overthrowing severalfarm buildings atFljopehlidh. 

1658. Earthquake on Easter day. 

1660. Eighth eruption of Katla, lasting from the 3d to the 12th 
November. The powerful ‘‘Jokellob” carried to the sea enormous 
masses of ice, rocks, and gravel to such an extent that the large sand 
plains at the foot of the Katla were completely inundated and resembled 
a stormy sea. The presbytery and the church of Hofdhabrekka were 
torn away by the waters, the farm of Hofdhi completely demolished, 
and four other farm buildings damaged to a considerable degree. Fish- 
ing grounds of 38 meters depth were filled up by the eruption and 
formed a dry beach.

1693. Sixteenth eruption of Seda from four craters; very violent, 
and lasting from the 13th of February until August. It was accom- 
panied by shaking of the earth, which was even noticeable on the sea. 
The volcano emitted blocks of lava of the size of houses ; the ashes 
spread all over the island and were transported as far as Norway and 
Scotland, while the pumice-stone was carried by the streams and cur- 
rents as far as the Faroe Islands. 

1706. Very violent earthquakes in the south, on the 1st and 20th of 
April, above Olfus and at Fl6i, where twenty-four large farms and a 
number of smaller buildings Avere overthrown. The trembling, with 
diminishing force, was felt beyond the Hecla, at Snaefellspes, 


506 


SCIENTIFIC RECCED FOR 1885 


1716. Eruption in the vicinity of lake Grimsvatn. 

1717. Eruption of the Kverlcfjall on the 17th of September. A large 
portion of the country, to the north and east, was covered with ashes, 
and the Jokuls4 i Axarflrdhi carried to the sea large quantities of 
pumice stone. 

1721. Ninth eruption of Kaila, commencing on the llth of May with 
a great “ Jdkellob.” The blocks of ice carried down to the sea, and fill- 
ing it to a depth of from 130 to 160 meters, formed a barrier to a dis- 
tance of three nautical miles from the shore. A turf covered ridge of 
rock of about 24,000 square meters was cut away on being struck with 
this giant force. A rocky pinnacle of 38 meters in height was also 
carried away, and the large cavern of Skipahellir completely filled up 
with gravel. The wind carried the ashes to the west •, and at Saurbaer, 
upon the Hvalfjardharstrdnd, 150 kilometers distant, the darkness was 
so intense as to prevent, at broad noon, the distinguishing of letters in 
a book. The sailors of Eeykjanes, 188 kilometers from the Katla, were 
barely able to find the entrance of the harbor at the beginning of the 
eruption. It lasted during the summer and fall. 

1724-’30. During this period several eruptions took place in the 
vicinity of lake M^vatn. 

1724. Eruption of the jSrq^a, 17th of May. The crater of Viti, on the 
west slope of the mountains, emitted an enormous quantity of ashes, 
and to the east of lake My vatn it formed a bank 1 meter deep. The 
shocks were felt throughout the entire country; houses were over- 
thrown, and the contour of the country changed by the formation of 
elevations and depressions. 

1726. January 11, eruption of Leirlmukr, with much shaking of the 
earth, and on April 19 eruption of Bjarnarflag. The earthquakes, 
increasing in force, attained their maximum intensity on the 8th of 
September. In the same year an eruption of Skeidhardrjdlcull took 
place. 

1727. Eruption of Oraefajokull, lasting from the 3d of August, 1727, 
until the 25th of May, 1728. Powerful “Jokelldb” devastated the 
entire country below the mountains, and carried out into the sea a large 
number of horses and other animals. The Skeidhardrjdkull was, at the 
same time, much agitated. On the 21st of August another eruption 
took place from the Leirhnukr, throwing out a current of lava, which 
took a northerly direction. 

1718. Eruption of the Leirhnukr^ at 2 a. m. of the 18th of AprU, with 
a flow of lava, which almost reached lake My vatn. Four hours later 
a new crater opened to the south of Leirhnukr, in the Srossadalr, and 
at about the same moment the Bjarnarflag erupted. Two days later a 
crater, situated on the east slope of the Dalfjall, near the Beykjahli- 
dharsel, emitted a large current of lava. On the 18th December another 
eruption of the Leirhnukr. In the same year several volcanic phe- 
nomena were observed in the lava beds of Seda, 


VULCANISM, ETC., IN ICELAND.

1729. The LeirhnuJcr again became active on the 30th of January, 
and eruptions took place during the entire year. The lava advanced 
to the lake M^vatn and demolished the presbytery of Eeykjalidh, 
together with three other buildings. One current emptied itself into 
the lake and a terrible combat toot place between the elements. 

1732. Earthquakes at Rangdrvellir and at Eystrihreppr, on the 7th of 
September, by which forty farm buildings were more or less damaged 
and eleven or twelve nearly overthrown. These shocks continued dur- 
ing two weeks. 

1734. Earthquake shocks at Floi and other localities in Arnessyssel, 
by which thirty farm buildings were overthrown, sixty to seventy 
damaged, and seven or eight people killed. 

1749. Earthquakes at 6lfm and Borgarfjdrdhr; the flow of the hot 
spring of Skrifla diminished and the farm-house of Hjalli, at Olfus, to- 
gether with the church, sank 1.25 meters below the surface. 

1752. Earthquake in Arnessyssel; 12 farms in Olfus damaged, and 
one church overthrown. 

1753. Eruption in the vicinity of Sedhujokjll. A “Jokellob” pro- 
duced in the river Djupd, which flows in a gorge towards the presby- 
tery of Kdlfafell, a rise of 60 meters ; an inundation followed which 
devastated the entire surrounding country. The waters of the Skapt^ 
and of the Hverflsfljdt rose proportionately. The ashes were carried 
beyond Skaptdrtunga. 

1754. Volcanic phenomena of three hours’ duration in the lava beds 
west of the Hecla. 

1755. Sixteenth eruption of Katla, preceded in the north by violent 
shocks of earthquake, overthrowing 13 farm-houses situated mostly 
in the neighborhood of Husavik, and lasting from the 10th to the 16th 
September. The eruption commenced on the 17th October and lasted 
until August, 1756. The “ Jokellob” and the ashes, which were carried 
as far as Leird, in the Borgarfjordhr, to the west, and to Djupivogr to 
the east, occasioned great damages. A large part of Skaptafellssyssel 
was covered with a layer of ashes 15 to 20 centimeters in thickness, 
and fifty farms had to be abandoned. In consequence of this eruption 
two ridges were formed on the Myralssandr, 23,000 meters long, 40 
meters high, and composed of ice, pumice stone, mud, and ashes. 

1766. Seventeenth eruption of Hecla, commencing on the 5th of 
April, as ordinarily with heavy earthquake shocks, perceptible south- 
westward as far as Eeykjanes. The ashes drifted northwest and 
caused darkness in the north of Iceland; the layer of ashes formed was 
60 centimeters thick in the vicinity of the volcano, and 30 centimeters 
at 225 kilometers distant, but fortunately it fell mostly in uninhabited 
districts. Pieces of pumice stone of 2 meters circumference were 
thrown a distance of 15 kilometers, a piece of lava of 1,750 grains a 
distance of 23 kilometers, and another piece of 3,750 grains weight, 


508 


SCIENTIFIC EECORD FOR 1885. 


struck the frozen ground at Xaefrholt with such force that it could only 
be removed with the aid of a lever; Masses of pumice stone caused 
the Ytri-Rang^ to overflow its banks, and the Thj6rs4 and other rivers 
carried enormous quantities of it out into the sea. A current of lava, 
7,500 meters long, spread out towards south -so nth west. On the 2 1st 
of April the ashes measured 5,000 meters in height and still rising. 
This eruption did not end until the next autumn. 

1774. Eruption in an unknown section in the vicinity of the Slcei- 
dhardrjdJcull. 

1783. Eighth submarine explosion southwest of Beylcjanes in May. 
An island formed with a crater which emitted such quantities of pum- 
ice stone that the sea was covered with it to a distance of 150 to 225 
kilometers. This island, which received the name Nyo (new), soon 
again disappeared. 

In the same year grand eruptions took place in the vicinity of the 
source of the river Slcaptd. On the first of June a trembling of the earl h 
was noticed throughout Skaptafellssyssel which lasted until 8 a. m. 
At 9 A. M. a violent eruption was noticed at Sidha in a direction north. 
At the same time the Skapta, then 130 meters wide, commenced lo 
diminish rapidly, and on the 11th June it had dried up entirely. On 
the 12th a current of lava precipitated itself like a roaring sea into the 
bed of the river, 160 to 190 meters deep, and after filling it up com- 
pletely, overran its banks, spread in various places and encircled 
several farms, but was suddenly arrested by a deep pit existing in the 
bed of the Skapt4 between the farms of Skaptardalr and the A, and 
which it would have to fill and bridge over before being able to pursue 
its course. The emissions of lava continued without interruption, and 
in the direction of TJlfarsdalr and Varm^rdalr twenty-two columns of 
fire and ashes could be counted. From the 14th to the 22d June the 
lava currents overflowed each other in the plains south of the Skajita, 
destroying several farms and fusing the old lava, at the same time 
obstructing or dislocating several water courses. Pumice stones and 
dross were thrown a distance of 113 kilometers westerly to Eangai - 
vallasyssel. On the 30th of June a current of lava turned w^est, towards 
the Kudhajljdt, one of the largest rivers of Iceland, which arrested it 
in its course, the current of lava being unable to surmount this power- 
ful barrier. The east branch of this current emptied itself into the 
Skapta, bridged over on the 17 th of July a deep pit below the cascade 
of Stapafoss, and stopped on the 20th of July at 1,900 meters from 
Kirkjubaejarklaustr, where it filled a channel of 130 meters in width 
and 40 meters in depth. The volcanoes continued their eruptions with 
diminishing force during the months of July, August, and September, 
and even in the middle of January of the next year one could still 
observe from Skapt^rtunga feeble eruptions behind the mountains. On 
the 29th of July, 1783, new eruptions were again observed farther to

the east, in the district of Fljotshverfl ; this region became covered 
with ashes, and the waters of the Hverflsfljot, after reaching the boil- 
ing point, evaporated completely under the action of a current of lava 
which filled the bed of the river and expanded towards the south, thereby 
destroying several farms. These eruptions continued until the mouth of 
January, 1784. At the same time the volcano in the vicinity of 8keidh- 
ardjbJcull evinced signs of activity, and an eruption took place on the 
8th of April, 1784, giving birth to a terrible “ Jokellob.” 

These violent eruptions tended to largely change the configuration 
of the surrounding country. Several water-courses disappeared, others 
had their course obstructed, and now formed in the lava bed innumera- 
ble small lakes, which in the mean time also disappeared, the Skapt4 
and the Hverfisfijot digging out new beds. And on the other hand no 
eruptions had ever had such disastrous consequences for Iceland. The 
lava consumed entirely 9 farms, ruined about 29 others, and rendered 
two parishes uninhabitable for two years. The ashes extended in large 
masses over the greater portion of Iceland and were carried to the 
Faroe Islands and beyond. The prairies were devastated, and a large 
number of animals died of hunger and disease. The year following was 
still more sorrowful, the inhabitants dying by the hundreds of hunger. 
It has been estimated that of the 48,884 individuals composing the 
inhabitants of Iceland, 9,238 died in consequence of these eruptions. 
Of animals, the loss by death during the years 1783-’84 was : 11,461 
head of cattle, 190,448 sheep, and 28,013 horses. Iceland was unable 
to recover from these terrible misfortunes until the middle of the pres- 
ent century. 

1784. From the 4th to the 16th of August violent earthquake shocks 
in Arnessyssel and Bangdrvallasyssel. In the former 69 farms were com- 
pletely destroyed, and 372 more and 11 churches badly damaged. In 
the latter 94 farm -buildings were shaken down. In some localities hot 
springs disappeared and reappeared, and near the geyser 36 new springs 
formed. 

1789. Violent earthquake at Arnessyssel. The lava beds of Thing 
vellir underwent some changes, and the entire section of land between 
the crevice of Almannagj4 and HrafnagjA settled 60 centimeters. Hot 
springs sprouted up on the Hellisheidhi and in othe.r localities (for in- 
stance at Eeykir). Several farms in the southeast of Iceland tumbled 
down. 

1808. Earthquakes in various places of Iceland, accompanied by a 
change of the hot springs. 

1810. Earthquake to the west of Mecla October 24. 

1815. Earthquake shocks in the north part of the island during the 
month of June.

December and continuing, though feebly, until the 1st of January, 1823. 
It produced a “ Jbkellbb,” which, taking a westerly course, occasioned 
considerable damages. 

1823. The eleventh eruption of Katla lasted from the 26th of June to 
the 23d of July, but was not as violent as the previous ones of the same 
volcano. A “ Jbkellob” carried to the east a large quantity of sand 
and gravel. In the beginning of February of the same year some vol- 
canic phenomena were observed in the vicinity of the sources of the 
Skaptd, possibly within the volcano of 1783. 

1826. Earthquake shocks in the north of Iceland during the month 
of June. » 

1829. Earthquake shocks in the south of Iceland on the 21st and 22d 
of February; nine farms were destroyed. 

1830. Ninth submarine explosion southwest of Beyhjanes, at 4 kilom- 
eters southwest of Eldeyjarbodi and at 60 kilometers southwest of the 
point of Eeykjanes. The explosions continued from the 13th of March 
until the month of May. 

1838. Earthquake in the north and south of Iceland, in the north be- 
tween Skjdlfandi and Hunafloi, with change of location of hot springs. 

1839. Earthquake at BeylcjaviTc, on the 28th of J uly. 

1845. Eighteenth eruption of Hecla, which, commencing on the 2d of 
September, lasted for seven months. A large quantity of ashes spread 
over the surrounding country, and a portion was carried by the wind 
as far as the Shetland islands. The column of ashes, on the 5th of 
February, 1846, rose, according to Ounnlaugsson, 4,370 meters above 
the summit of Hecla. The current of lava emitted had a length of 
11,300 meters, a width of 2,800 meters, and was from 15 to 35 meters 
thick. J. G. Schythe estimates its bulk as 446,000,000 of cubic meters. 

1855. Feeble earthquake shocks in the north of Iceland. 

1860. Twelfth eruption of Katla. On the 8th of May, between 6 and 
8 A. M., an earthquake occurred, followed by a “ Jokellob,” descending 
from the Katla towards the southeast. On the 11th another “ Jokellob” 
from the Solheimasandr towards the southwest. The eruption ceased 
on the 27th of May. The “ Jokellob” carried such large masses of sand 
and gravel that a former fishing ground of 30 meters’ depth was com- 
pletely filled up after the eruption. The ashes were transported towards 
the north into uninhabited regions and did but little damage. On Sep- 
tember 20, at 7 p. M., an earthquake in the south, moving southwest to 
northeast. In the night from the 30th to the 31st December one noticed 
at Reykjavik a movement in the same direction. 

1862. Eruptions in the uninhabited regions north of the Vatnajdkull, 
but its exact location not known.

1867. Eruptions in the inhabited regions north of the Vatnajdkull, 
from the 29th of August to the 5th September. Fall of ashes south of 
the Vatnajokull, at Oraefi, and at Sudhrsveit. At the same time 
“ Jokellob” at SkeidhardrjoJcull. 

1868, Towards New Year some volcanic phenomena at Mandreyjar, 
in the north of Iceland, were observed at sea in the neighborhood of 
Tjornes; and at the same time an earthquake took place at Husavik. 
In January, feeble shocks in the north ; on the 1st to the 3d November 
earthquake shocks in the south. 

1872. Severe earthquake in the north, at Susavik, on the 17th of 
April. Several buildings were overthrown and others damaged. The 
shocks were not discontinued until the end of May. In December of 
the same year some feeble shocks were observed in the north. 

1873. Eruption of the Kverkfjall {?) January 8 to 13. Considerable 
fall of ashes in the south and east of the island. 

1875. Alternate eruptions of the D^ngjufjall and the Sveinagjd. To- 
wards the end of 1874 some earthquakes were noticed in the northeast 
of the island, and on the 3d of January a column of smoke was observed 
to rise above the Dyngjufjall, but this eruption did not cause any 
damage. According to the researches of F. Jonstrup it issued from 
craters situated in the southwest corner of the Askja^ 94 meters below 
the lava field of Askja, and 138 meters above the lake. These craters 
emitted an enormous quantity of vapor even during the summer of 
1876. During the first eruption large blocks of tuft and basalt, some 
of a bulk of 31 cubic meters, were thrown to a height of 30 meters, 
and one of them emitted blocks of gravel, cemented with ice, of a bulk 
of 6 cubic meters. 

On the 18th of February occurred an eruption of the Sveinagjdj in 
the M^vatnsoraefi (desert of M;f'vatn), and the formation of several 
craters ; on March 10, an eruption of 14 to 16 new craters, emitting 
torrents of lava; and on the 29th of the same month a violent eruption 
of the jDyngjnfjall. The entire eastern portion of Iceland became 
covered with ashes and pumice stone, the bulk of the latter having 
been estimated at 400 millions of cubic meters. Portions of the ashes 
were transported to Norway, and even at Stockholm and its vicinity 
a shower of the ashes fell on the evening of the 29th of March. This 
eruption issued from the most southerly crater of the valley of Askja, 
to the northeast of the pit mentioned before. The ground all around 
was, in 1876, covered with pumice stones, the larger portion of them 
having a diameter of 15 to 20 centimeters, and many of 50 to 100 cubic 
decimeters in bulk. At one place where they were of a thickness of 
60 to 100 centimeters they had entirely hidden a bed of snow of 8 
meters’ thickness, formed during the winter of 1874-’75, On the 4th 
of April several eruptions were observed on the Myvatnsoraefi, and on 
the 15th of August the last one occurred, none of them causing much

I 

damage. The lava produced was basaltic and very uneven. Some ] 
craters emitted bombs with a close surface and a cellular mold. In 
July, 1876, a temperature of from 130° to 200°, and even 300° 0., was ' 
observed in the cracks of the lava. In the grass-covered sjjots which 
the lava overflowed, crystals of chlorhydrate of ammonia have separ- 
ated. The eruption of D5'ngjufjall, of the 29th of March, had some 
very severe consequences for the fertile regions of the east of Iceland. 
Hundreds of farms had to be abandoned, but one also rapidly re- 
covered from the evil effects by removing the light layers of ashes and 
pumice stone, and the damage will not be as serious as was feared. 
This eruption, from the fact that its products were purely trachytic, 
stands isolated and unique in Iceland in modern times. 

1879. On the 27th of February an eruption in one of the chains run- 
ning northeast from the Hecla. It lasted to the month of May, with- 
out doing much harm, the lava not reaching the inhabited regions. < 

1879- Tenth submarine explosion southwest of BeyTcjcmes, on the 30th i 
and 31st of May. 

The following eruptions mentioned in several old lists are charged to ;

Helgafell, on the island of Westmauna, no positive data exist regard- 
ing eruptions within historic times. 

Within historic times eruptions have taken place at about 20 differ- 
ent places in Iceland. Generally speaking the volcanoes are small and i 
only one eruption is on record. Among the large volcanoes, Hecla oc- 
cupies the first place with 21 eruptions; next comes the Katla with 
12 or 13, then the Eldeyjar, near Keykjanes, with 10, the Trollad.f ngja j 
with 6 eruptions. The largest current of lava was produced in 1783. | 
The ice-covered volcanoes in the south of Iceland never emit currents | 
of lava, but only ashes ; they are above all to be dreaded on account of ) 
the “ Jokellob” which they produce when the eruption breaks up the | 
covering of ice. The largest number of eruptions have taken place in ; 
the fourteenth century (13), and in the eighteenth century (14). In i 
studying the list of eruptions it will be observed that in each period 
they are concentrated in one certain section and that, in their succes- 
sion, they rarely made large jumps. The earthquakes are in direct 
connection with the eruptions, they occurring nearly aU in Olfus, 
Grimsnes, Floi, and at Pjdlshlidh, in the vicinity of the Hecla, or at 
Thingeyjarsysla, the hearth of the volcanoes of the^ north.

BIBLIOGRAPHY OF THE VOLCANOES, EARTHQUAKES, AND GEYSERS OF 

ICELAND. 

Compiled by George H. Boehmer. 

Mr. Thoroddsen, in his paper on “ de islandske Vulkaners Historie,” furnishes quite 
an extensive bibliographical list of volcanoes and earthquakes of Iceland ; a similar 
list, on the geysers of Iceland, is given by Dr. A. C. Peale in his report on the Yellow- 
stone National Park (in Part i. of Dr. Hayden’s XII Annual Report — for 1878 — of 
the U. S. Geological and Geographical Surveys of the Territories.) To these lists have 
been added such titles of works on these subjects, as well as on geographical and 
physical descriptions of Iceland, and such accounts of travels, as could be procured 
from the following-named publications :

GEOGRAPHY. 


By J. King Goodeioh. 


GENEEAIi NOTES. 

The attention of the geographical world has been drawn away from 
the poles and centered upon the equatorial regions during the short 
period which has elapsed since the last report of the progress in geog- 
raphy was written. As a summary of the work done, the address of 
the Marquis of Lome, president of the Eoyal Geographical Society of 
Great Britain, at the opening of the session of 1885-’86, may be very 
properly alluded to at this point and commended as a careful and satis- 
factory epitome of what is of most interest. 

While lacking much of the harrowing element that was so distress- 
ingly conspicuous in the records of the “Jeannette” and Greely Arctic 
expeditions, and which appealed so strongly to our sympathy, the cur- 
rent record is by no means wanting in evidences of danger and disaster. 

The Aberdeen meeting of the Geography Section of the British Asso- 
ciation commenced on the 9th of September. The leading feature of 
this year’s meeting was the prominence given to Indian subjects. Out 
of a total of thirty-four papers read, as many as eleven referred to the 
geography of India and the regions immediately adjoining it. Geo- 
graphical education attracted much attention, and the report of Mr. 
Keltie upon this subject elicited prolonged discussion. The importance 
of this branch of education is becoming more marked every day ; com- 
munications on the subject have frequently appeared in the leading 
journals, which devote columns specially to geography. In order to 
test the condition of education in Denmark, the Government decided at 
the beginning of the year to have a test examination among the recruits 
of the army and navy, on the Belgian principle. The result of this ex- 
amination appears to have been very discreditable to education in Den- 
mark, and particularly to that in geograi>hy. One of the examiners, 
the Eev. J. L. Bang, of Langaa, has given some particulars of the re- 
sults, from which we quote : “ The regiment selected was the Life Guards, 
the crack regiment of the Danish army, the recruits (282 in number) 
being drawn from every part of the country. Questions such as how 
many ells (the Danish measure) go to a mile, and the size of an acre of

land, were answered by a very few only. But as regards geography the 
answers were far worse. In answer to the question, ‘What is the cap- 
ital of Sweden?’ Paris, Trondhjem, St. Petersburg, Amsterdam, Lon- 
don, Madrid, Copenhagen, and even Constantinople were given.” It is 
by no means certain that a similar examination in this country would 
develop results very much more satisfactory. 

Dr. Eichard Lehmann, professor of geography in Munster University, 
has issued the first part of a work, which will extend to about 400 pages, 
on apparatus and methods in geographical teaching. Dr. Lehmann has 
given much attention to the subject of geographical education, and has 
himself, as teacher and Privatdocent in Halle, had great experience in 
teaching the subject, so that his work when completed is sure to prove 
of real service. 

An exhibition of maps, atlases, reliefs, globes, and other apparatus 
used in geographical education, collected from the principal establish- 
ments and institutions in England and on the continent of Europe, was 
opened in London on the 9th of December, 1885, by the president of the 
Eoyal Geographical Society, the Marquis of Lome, and wiU continue 
to the 31st of January, 1886. The programme includes lectures and 
discussions, and the attendance and interest confirm the judgment of the 
promoters of the scheme. 

The geographical subject proposed this year by the French Academy 
of Inscriptions for the Prix Bordin is “A critical examination of the 
geography of Strabo.” According to the terms laid down by the Acad- 
emy, competitors are (1) to give the history of the text of the work; (2) 
to characterize the language of Strabo with reference to that of con- 
temporary Greek writers, such as Diodorus Siculus, and Dionysius of 
Halicarnassus; (3) to distinguish the information collected by direct ob- 
servation of places and that drawn by him from his predecessors ; (4) 
to express definite conclusions on his critical method in using various 
documents. The papers should be in the hands of the secretary of 
the institute not later than December 31, 1886. 

It was stated in the early part of the year that the King of the Bel- 
gians was conferring with M. Martinie, president of the French Geo- 
graphical Society, on the subject of the formation of an International 
Geographical Society. Though nothing definite seems to have come of 
this conference, it is to be hoped that such a society will be formed. 
One of the best arguments in its favor is that through its instrumen- 
tality combined action could be had on the system of orthography for 
native names of places. Taking into consideration the present want of 
such a system, and the consequent confusion and variety that exist in 
the mode of spelling in English maiis, the council of the Eoyal Geo- 
graphical Society has adopted the following rules for such geographical 
names as are not (in the countries to which they belong) written in the 
Eoman character. The rules are identical with those adopted for the 


GEOGRAPHY. 545 

Admiralty charts, and will henceforth be used in all publications of the 
society. 

1. Mo change wUl be made in the orthography of foreign names in 
countries which use Eoman letters : thus Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, 
&c., names will be spelt as by the respective nations. 

2. Neither will any change be made in the spelling of such names in 
languages which are not written in Eoman character as have become 
by long usage familiar to English readers ; thus Calcutta, Cutch, Cele- 
bes, Mecca, &c., will be retained in their present form. 

3. The true sound of the word as locally pronounced will be taken as 
the basis of the spelling. 

4. An approximation, however, to the sound is alone aimed at. A 
system which would attempt to represent the more delicate inflections 
of sound and accent would be so complicated as only to defeat itself. 
Those who desire a more accurate pronunciation of the written name 
must learn it on the spot by a study of local accent and peculiarities. 

5. The broad features of the system are that vowels are pronounced 
as in Italian, and consonants as in English. 

6. One accent only is used, the acute, to denote the syllable on which 
stress is laid. This is very important, as the sounds of many names are 
entirely altered by the misplacement of this stress. 

7. Every letter is pronounced. When two vowels come together each 
one is sounded, though the result when spoken quickly is sometimes 
scarcely to be distinguished from a single sound, as in ai, au, ei. 

8. [East] Indian names are accepted as spelj; in Hunter’s Gazetteer. 

On the 11th of September occurred the centenary of the foundation 

of the well-known geographical establishment of Justus Perthes, of Gotha. 
The committee of the Geography Section of the British Association, 
which was in session at Aberdeen at the time, sent a telegram of hearty 
congratulation and good wishes for the future to the head of the estab- 
lishment. All the professors of geography at the German uUiversities 
united in presenting to the firm a beautifully illuminated address, ex- 
pressing their sense of the services rendered to geography by the firm 
during its long career. A handsome quarto volume has also been issued 
from Gotha for private circulation , giving a very interesting sketch of the 
progress of the establishment under its various heads, brief biographies of 
the famous cartographers connected with it, and notes on the various 
great works in geography which it has produced. The work contains nu- 
merous portraits both of the partners and cartographers of the past. The 
founder of the firm was Johann Georg Justus Perthes, who was born at 
Eudolstadt, September 11, 1749, his father being physician to the Prince 
of Eudolstadt. When the firm was first established in Gotha in 1785, 
its publications were of a general character. In 1809 the great Hand- 
Atlas iiher alle helcannte Lander des Erdbodens, by Professor Heusin- 
ger, of Dresden, was published, with twenty-four maps in copper plate. 
Under the second chief of the firm, Wilhelm Perthes, 1816-’53, the

Gotha establishment rapidly assumed the special geographical and car- 
tographical character it has ever since possessed. Under him the first 
part of the celebrated hand atlas of Adolf Stieler was published in 1817, 
which since then has continued to be issued in an unbroken series of 
editions. To Wilhelm succeeded in 1853 Bernhard Perthes, who, how- 
ever, was cut off in 1857, leaving a posthumous son, the present head 
of the Gotha establishment. The successive chiefs gathered round them 
in successive years all the best geographical talent in Germany, includ- 
ing such names as those of Stieler, Berghaus, Sydow, Spruner, Bret. 
Schneider, Petermann, Behm, Wagner, Supan, Hassenstein. Through 
the OeograpMsche MittJieilungen established by Petermann, the Go- 
tha establishment has gradually become the receptacle for geographical 
information from all parts of the earth, information which is being con- 
stantly put on record and given to the world in the form of those ac- 
curate and beautiful maps with which all geographers are familiar. It 
is to be hoped that long continued prosperity is in store for a house 
which has done such admirable service in the past to geographical sci- 
ence. 

The recent colonial acquisitions by the various European nations has 
called forth a number of excellent papers on the subject. Among the 
best is that of Colonel Sir Charles H. Nugent, K. C. B., which was 
published in a recent issue of the Journal of the Royal United Service 
Institution. According to the latest statistics, England has 65 square 
miles of colony to the square mile of her own area ; Holland, 54 5 
Portugal, 20 ; Denmark^ '6-30 ; France, 1'90 ; and Spain, 0-86 square 
miles. The area of the British colonies is nearly 8,000,000 square miles, 
rather less than the area of the Russian Empire, including Siberia and 
Central Asia; but if the area of the native feudatory states in India 
be added, amounting to 509,284 square miles, over which England exer- 
cises as great control as Russia does over much of the territory under 
its sway, together with that of the United Kingdom itself, 120,757 
square miles, then the area of the British Empire exceeds that of the 
Russian Empire ; and it covers within a fraction of one-sixth of the | 
whole land area of the globe. The recently absorbed territory of the 
ex-King Thebaw is not included in this epitome. { 

Two new prizes have been added to those which the Geographical 
Society of Paris is now in a position to award. One is that of M. J. B. 
Morot, who bequeathed a sum of 2,000 francs, the interest of which is to ’ 
be given annually to the French navigator or traveller who should in ' 
the course of the year have approached nearest to the North Pole ; and 
the other that of M. Felix Fournier, who left 50,000 francs to found an 
annual prize “ with the object of rewarding the best geographical work, 
either maps or books, published during the year.” While the former 
will hardly be considered a special incentive to braving the hardships 
of Arctic travel, the latter will undoubtedly stimulate to extra effort. 

The war ministers of France, Germany, and Italy have recently been

attentively examining geographical maps in relief, constructed on a 
system of which M. de Mendouca, a Portuguese councilor of state, presi- 
dent of the Banco Lusitauo, possesses the patent and is the promulgator. 
These relief maps are stated to combine the advantages generally ad- 
mitted to be possessed by relief maps and the convenience and accuracy 
of maps on flat surfaces. This new method rapidly produces by a chem- 
ical and mechanical process plane maps with the curves and altitudes 
in relief, so represented as to correspond absolutely with the elevations 
established by accurate observations. These maps are drawn on com- 
paratively thin paper ; can be rolled up and placed in the narrowest 
case, so that they are very light and portable, and are not injured by 
water. 

The editor of Science^ under date of December 4, 1885, called attention 
to a curious instance of persistency of error in map-making. Many 
years ago an army expedition traversed the White Eiver region of Colo- 
rado, going from Fort Bridger, Wyoming, to old Fort Massachusetts, 
Colorado. In this neighborhood are “bad lands,” eroded into curious 
forms, which naturally suggest a ruined city ; the commander of the 
expedition gave the locality the name of Goblin City, which name ap- 
peared on his map. The map-makers, in their haste to fill up the blanks 
in this unsettled region, jumped to the conclusion that this was a veri- 
table settlement, and gave it a place on their maps — a place which it 
has ever since retained. Not only have the commercial map-makers, 
almost without exception, fallen into this error, but such authorities as 
the United States Engineer Ofl&ce and General Land Office have adopted 
it. The name has however been gradually changed from Goblin to 
Goldin, and thence to Golden City; while more than one enterprising 
map-maker — reasoning probably that a city cannot exist without means 
of communicating with other settlements, has constructed on paper a 
road down the White Eiver to it. It is scarcely necessary to add that 
there is not and never was a city in this neighborhood. Continuing his 
very apposite comments on careless map-making, the same editor, in a 
more recent issue, is inclined to think that if demand begets supply, 
there must be a very limited demand for good maps in this country. 
And any geographer who has had occasion to use trade maps of com- 
paratively new regions must frequently have been sadly embarrassed 
by the apparent carelessness in compiling them. 

Heinrich Entz and August Mer have recently independently studied 
the voyage of Hanno, the Carthaginian. Both agree that its termina- 
tion was at the island of Fernando Po, in the Bight of Biafra, called by 
Hanno the Isle of Gorillas. The colony of Thymaterion is identified by 
them, as by most authors, with the town of Mazaghan, and the promon- 
tory of Solo6 with Cape Cantin. The river Lixus is regarded by Mer 
as the Senegal, for weighty reasons, though Entz and others have 
favored the Wadi Draa, much farther south Hanno’s if’ 
was probably Goree, and his Western Horn (or Bay) was

Benin. Mucli weight attaches to the opinion of M. Mer, who is a retired 
naval officer of forty years’ experience, including three years of cruis- 
ing between the equator and Gibraltar, on the west coast of Africa. 

A catalogue of the printed maps, plans, and cha rts in the British 
Museum has been prepared by Professor Douglas, and will be issued 
in two large volumes.

F. S. Arnot has sent to the Eoyal Geographical Society a sketch map 
of his route from Shoshong to Bih6. He followed the Zambesi from 
his point of crossing, a little above Victoria Falls, to Lialui, from which 
he proceeded west-northwest to the great plateau on which Bih6 is 
situated. 

The route from Benguela to the mission village of Bih6 has been ap- 
j)roximately surveyed by the Eev. William E. Fay. The sketch maps 
cover an area 60 miles wide, extending over four degrees of longitude. 
The first human habitations met Avith are at the eastern foot of the 
coast range. 

According to J. M. Cook, who has recently returned from Dongola, 
it appears that the cataracts of the Mle are not correctly placed upon 
the map. The so-called third cataract at Hannek is no cataract at all, 
only a very small rapid. Between the second and so-called third cataract 
four or five cataracts occur, and these explain the delay in the concen- 
tration of the British troops at Dongola. From Sarras to Sakarmatta 
(74 miles) the rise was 450 feet. 

The map of Africa, on a scale of 27 geographical miles to the inch, in 
course of publication by the French D6pot de la Guerre, will consist of 
sixty sheets. Twenty-four of these have been published, 18 of West and 
Central Africa, 6 of South Africa and Cape Colony. Sheet number 9 
shows the Canaries and the sterile country called by Dr. Barth ‘‘ Tiris 
el Ferar,” or the country of deep wells. Sheet No. 10 gives the western 
half of the Sahara, and shows the routes of travellers, with many notes 
on the inhabitants, nature of the country, and position of the oases and 
wells; and Sheet No. 11 has a portion of the Ahaggar region, of which 
little is really known, and the better-known Terab oasis. 

M. Giraud has finally been compelled to desis t from his attempted 
explorations. His men deserted him, retaining the French flag and 
Chassepot rifles, and turned highwaymen on their way back to Zanzi- 
bar, where they were cast into prison by the French consul. 

The results of Dr. von Wilhelm Joest’s circumnavigation of Africa 
are of ethnographic rather than geographic interest, since he scarcely left 
the coast at all, and when he did penetrate into the interior it was in 
such well-known places as the Orange Free State and Zululand. Still, 
what he did was well done, and several advantageous map corrections 
can be made from his notes. 

A work of interest to the philologist, geographer, and anthropologist 
is that of l’Abb6 Pierre Bouche oa the Slave Coast and Dahomey.

The African travellers Juncken and Casati have arrived at Lado, an 
Egyptian military station on the Bahr-el-Jebel. They were exploring 
the Nyam-Nyam district, between the tributaries of the Nile and the 
Upper Congo, and as nothing had been heard of them for a long time, 
it was feared the Mahdi had cut off their retreat. 

Mr. Henry E. O’Neill has taken great pains to ascertain the longitude 
of Blantyre, and his results have been accepted by the Eoyal Geographi- 
cal Society. After careful computation, and making choice of such ob- 
servations as from their nature were best calculated to eliminate pos- 
sible errors of observation, the longitude of Blantyre has been fixed at 
350 3’ 34" east of Greenwich, thus differing 7' 24" from the previously 
accepted position, which was 34° 56' 30" east. Blantyre is now reck- 
oned as a secondary meridian. Mr. O’Neill on his journey from Quilli- 
mane to Blantyre availed himself of the opportunity afforded by an en- 
forced delay on the banks of the Zambesi to study the action of that river. 
He is led to speculate on the probable change in the physical and po- 
litical geography of that part of Africa which will result from a continu- 
ation of the wearing away of the banks of the Zambesi ; for if a perma- 
nent connection be established between the Zambesi and Quaqua, and a 
large proportion of the volume of water now carried to the sea by the 
Kongone Elver and other smaller branches to the southward enters the 
Quillimane Eiver, the effect will undoubtedly be to block the southerly 
channels by the precipitation nearer shore of the earth particles carried 
down by the river. And on the other hand the Quillimane Eiver would 
be deepened by the greater “ scouring ” force of the larger volume of 
water carried down by it. The connection mentioned is now made in- 
termittently over the low flat country between the Zambesi and Qua- 
qna at high water. Mr. O’Neill draws attention to the neglected port 
of Nakala, in Fernao Yeloso Bay, north of Mozambique. It has numer- 
ous good anchorages, and offers magnificent conditions for the founding 
of a colony. Nakala is a deep inlet forming a southern prolongation of 
Fernao Yeloso Bay. 

M. Coillard, accompanied by M. Middleton, has accomplished his 
journey up the valley of the Zambesi to visit Akufuna, the King of the 
Ba-rotse, and has been received with great kindness. The authority of 
the King is not very great ; his minister Mataga appears to be master of 
everything, but he has had several rebelbons to put down. 

In the July portion of Petermann’s Mittheilungen, Professor Eatzel 
seeks to show how misleading it is to color the map of Africa with def- 
inite political boundaries. His paper is accompanied by a double map 
of Africa. In one part the continent is colored according to the pre- 
vailing occupation, in the second according to the people who form 
states. 

For the purpose of gaining information for France as to what was 
occurring in the vicinity of her Algerine possessions, M. Charles de 
Foucauld accomplished a most remarkable journey of exploration in

Morocco during 1883 and 1884. Having renounced his future prospects 
in the military career, he disguised himself in the costume of a Jew, in 
spite of the antipathy of the natives to persons of that religion. This 
particular disguise enabled him to conceal his barometer and sextant 
and make his observations under the long veil with which the Jew 
covers himself during prayer. Deprived of all comforts, without 
servants, without an animal upon which to ride, without tent or 
bed, and almost without baggage, he travelled and worked during 
eleven months among these people who had tiiore than once before 
unmasked similar attempts and inflicted upon the unfortunate in- 
dividual the punishment which the crime appeared to them to de- 
serve, viz, death. To the 7,600 miles of road marked out with 
but few determinations of latitude and still fewer points of longi- 
tude, which cartographers had at their disposal in 1883, M. de Fou- 
cauid added 1,400 miles of new ground besides revising and perfecting 
in the course of his journey the work of his predecessors. Hi.3 travels 
occupied from the 20th of June, 1883, to the 23d of May, 1884. He 
traversed the great Atlas range at several new points, of which he had 
determined the altitude, besides having journeyed for 185 miles along 
the base of the range, rectifying and simplifying by fresh information 
the orography of the country. Thanks to him, we now know that from 
31 miles on the north and 103 miles on the south this commanding 
range is flanked by parallel lines of elevation, which, as far as our maps 
were concerned, is quite a revelation. We learn from M. de Foucauld 
that there is in the north a chain of mountains about 185 miles in length, 
which bears the names of Djebel-Ait-Seri and Djebel Beni-Uaghain. In 
the south there is, first of all, the Little Atlas (the Anti- Atlas on the 
map of Lenz), and still farther south the strange outline of the Djebel- 
Bani range, the name of which we know from the Rabbi Mardoch6e, 
and which Lenz crossed, but without identifying it. This journey, ex- 
tending over five days to the south of Meknas, was accomplished by M. 
de Foucauld in the midst of warlike peoples and marauding tribes. 
In the month of December, 1883, the traveller touched the Uadi Dhra’a 
to the south of Tattas. “ This river,” he says, “the bed of which is 
nearly 2J miles in breadth, is absolutely dry, except during the melting 
of the snow and the seasons of continuous rain.” Later on he again 
saw the river farther to the northeast, in the district of Mezquita, 
“ where this same river, broad and with uninterrupted stream, flows 
through plantations of date palms.” The itinerary of M. de Foucauld 
places that part of the course of the Uadi Dhra’a, as indicated on Dr. 
EohlFs map, quite one degree farther west. This important correc- 
tion should be utilized to revise the itinerary of the German traveller. 
Finally, the accurate information obtained literallj' revolutionizes our 
previous geographical and political knowledge of Morocco. 

The death of King Mtesa is confirmed, but it is believed that his son

will prove more friendly to civilization than the father. Miramba is also 
dead. 

Dr. A. Fischer’s brochure, Mehr lAcM im dunlceln Weltteil, reviewed 
in the November issue of the Proceedings of the Eoyal Geographical 
Society, contains a large amount of statistical information, through 
the midst of which much valuable geographical knowledge is inter- 
woven. 

Lieut. Victor Giraud, of the French navy, has given us (see Proceed- 
ings Eoyal Geographical Society, September) a delineation of Lake Bang- 
weolo, which differs widely from that first published by Dr. Livingston, 
as a comparison of his sketch with the society’s map of Eastern Equa- 
torial Africa will show. We are indebted to the same officer for having 
traced the Luapula from where it issues from the lake, as far as Moero 
Mkata. Equally interesting is the information brought home by Herr 
Eeichard from the copper country of Katanga and the Kingdom of Msiri, 
regions hitherto known to us only from the vague reports of Portuguese 
traders or natives. Lieutenant Giraud left Daro es- Satam on the 19th 
of December, 1882. Crossing in succession H-zaramo, Khutu, IJ-sagara, 
U-hehe, H-bena, and the Livingston Mountains, by routes differing in 
many places from those followed by his predecessors, he reached the north- 
ern extremity of Lake Nyassa, and thence ascended to Kiwanda on the 
“ Stevenson road.” He then turned off toward the southwest and trav- 
elling over a wide plain, entered U-emba, the country of B-emba, whose 
chief is Kitim Kuru, by far the most powerful ruler whom the explorer 
met with. On reaching Zapana, Lieutenant Giraud sent his caravan on to 
Kazembe’stown, whilst proceeding himself to the shores of Lake Bang- 
weolo. The lake, according to this explorer, consists of a sheet of open 
water in the north, apparently nowhere more than 20 feet in de'pth, and 
of a vast swamp. Kisi, the most elevated island, only rises to a height 
of 80 feet. The Luapula leaves the lake at Kawende Point. The river 
there is about 300 feet wide and 15 feet deep, its course being well de- 
fined between walls of gigantic rushes. After about a fortnight spent 
on the river and in forcing his way through a lagoon at the back of it. 
Lieutenant Giraud’s progress was stopped by an “army” sent against 
him by Mere-Mere, chief of Ba-ussi. He was compelled to surrender ; but 
after remaining a prisoner for some time he succeeded in escaping, made 
his way through the country of the hostile Wa-Kisinga, and following 
the Luapula for some distance, he at length rejoined his caravan in 
Kazembe’s town. Eventually he reached lende on the Taganyika. 

Dr. Bdhm and Herr Eeichard left ‘the Belgian station of Mpala, on 
the Tanganyika, on the 1st of September, 1883, and on September 27 
they reached the Luapula, where that river is 500 feet wide, but not 
navigable, owing to rapids. They crossed into the kingdom of a power- 
ful chief, named Msiri, who subjected them to vexatious annoyances, 
and prevented their progress until at last Dr. Bohm died on March 27, 
1884, after ten days’ suffering. Soon afterward Herr Eeichard was per-

initted to start for Katanga, which he reached on May 27, and visited 
the two copper mines, which he found to be exceedingly rich. His at- 
tempt to trace the Lufira to its source was frustrated by the hostile 
attitude of the Wa-ramba, and he was compelled to turn back on June 
2, when within a few days only of his goal. Owing to the hostile atti- 
tude of Msiri, and the annoyance consequent thereon, the valuable col- 
lections made by Dr. Bohm had to be abandoned. On November 6, 
1884, the Luapula was crossed once more, and after another long march 
through a hostile country the hospitable station of Mpala was reached 
again on November 30, 1884. According to Herr Eei chard the Lualaba 
is the real head-stream of the Congo. Where he saw that liver, a short 
distance above the TJpembe Lake, it is 1,000 to 1,500 feet wide, and the 
natives assert that it can be navigated as far as Manymma. The Lua- 
pula, on the other hand, has a width of only 500 feet, and forms numer- 
ous rapids in its course through the Mitumba Mountains. The Lufira, 
where crossed, was only 150 to 200 feet wide. It forms two waterfalls, 
one in the salt plain of Muacha, and another, Juo, at the head of the 
gorge through the Viano Mountains. The Juo falls are 80 feet high, 
the breadth of the river being 330 feet. 

The two Portuguese explorers, Captain Capello and Commander Ivens, 
who started last year upon an expedition across Africa, eventually 
reached Cape Town after a most adventurous journey. They subse- 
quently left for Mossamedes, and returned to Europe via the Congo. 
They reached Lisbon on the 17th of September, where they were re- 
ceived by the King, and welcomed by an enthusiastic demonstration of 
their countrymen. They have traversed a region which no European 
had ever set foot in. Leaving Mossamedes in March, 1884, with an es- 
cort of one hundred and twenty men recruited along the coast between 
that place and St. Paul de Loando, they reached Quillimane, upon the 
eastern coast, to the south of Mozambique, in May, 1885, after having 
discovered the watershed whence the rivers of Central Africa flow north 
and east towards the sea. They travelled over 4,500 miles of territory, 
3,000 miles of which were previously unexplored, and they are said to 
have discovered the sources of the Lualaba, an affiuent of the Congo 
(which has been so frequently referred to in recent geographical discus- 
sions), as well as those of the Luapula and Chambeze, the upper waters 
of the Congo. They also visited the copper region of the Yaranganga 
district, situated between the Lualaba and the Luapula Eivers. Messrs. 
Capello and Ivens found the tse-tse fly very abundant j sixteen of the 
party died from their bites, withofit counting cattle and hunting dogs. 
They lost, all told, sixty-two men in fifteen months, and were almost 
exhausted when they reached Fet6. (See Proceedings of Eoyal Geo- 
graphical Society, December, 1885.) 

Mr. J. T. Last left England on the 2d of September, on his way to 
Zanzibar, where he will equip his party for the expedition in which he is 
engaged under the auspices of the Eoyal Geographical Society. He will

proceed to the confluence ot the Eovuma and Lujendi Eivers, fix the 
longitude of the junction, and will then establish himself awhile in the 
Namuli Hills. After a study of that region, Mr. Last will enter the 
valley of the Likuga, follow it to the coast, and then follow the coast 
to QuHlimane or Angoche. 

In a report to the British foreign office, by Mr. Laurence Goodrich, 
Her Britannic Majesty’s acting consul for the Kyasse district, dated Ban- 
daw6. Lake Nyassa, June 1, 1885, he describes a recent visit to the 
country on the west of the lake. He refers principally to the territory 
of Muazi, which was visited by Livingston. During his stay at Kasungo, 
Muazi’s town, 130 miles SSW. of Bandaw6, the chief died and was 
succeeded by his nephew Katam4. Mr. Goodrich was well received there, 
the natives having that respectforthe English which is always to befound 
where Livingston has been the only previous white visitor. The chief 
object of the visit was to inquire into and endeavor to wean the chiefs 
from encouraging the slave trade. The country he passed through be- 
tween Bandaw4 and Kasungo he found entirely uninhabited, though 
abounding in game of all kinds. Kasungo is situated in the center of a 
large treeless plain, 2,258 feet above the level of Lake Kyassa, the houses 
being built around a curious conical-shaped hill900 feet above the plain. 
The chiefs interviewed were anxious to see English traders settled in 
the country. Muazi’s country is known as the Marumba country, and 
the people are Wanyasse. Here a very large stock of ivory is to be 
bought — according to Mr. Goodrich, Katam6 offered to sell him a hun- 
dred tusks. The soil (he states) is good, and adapted for wheat grow- 
ing ; cattle thrive admirably, and the tse tse fly does not exist in the 
district. The plain around the base of Mount Kasungo is 4,000 feet 
above the sea, which altitude should insure a climate suited to Euro- 
peans. The natives appear to be simple and peace-loving. 

Dr. Hannington, Bishop of Equatorial Africa, started with Mr. Taylor 
early in June to explore a route, different from that followed by Mr. 
Joseph Thomson, via Ohagga and the Massai country to the eastern 
shores of Victoria Kyanza, He is of the opinion that if this route be 
once opened all the caravans for Mombasa to the interior would adopt 
it, and there would be a great saving of time and distance. The bishop 
has attached himself to a Swahali caravan. He hopes to touch Lake 
Naivasha and emerge at Sendega in Lower Kavirondo. 'When last heard 
from he was working his way through the unknown region between 
Kilima-njaro and Victoria Nyanza, and hoped to be at Eubaga by the 
end of the year. Since then an unconfirmed rumor has been received 
to the efiect that he had been taken a prisoner by the King of the Mo- 
banza, (?) who threatened to put him to death. If successful, the bishop 
will accomplish a work of great geographic as well as humanitarian 
value. Sir John Kirk was consulted, and approved of the scheme. 

Dr. Oscar Lenz’s work on Timbulctu appeared early in the year. Since 
then the Imperial Geographical Society of Vienna has received good

news from the doctor’s present African exploring expedition, which had 
passed through Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, and gone on to the 
Oameroons, the ultimate object being to explore the watershed between 
the Mle and Congo from the west. 

M. Leon Guiral has sent to the Geographical Society at Paris a de- 
scription of the west coast of Africa, about the mouths of the San Benito 
or Eyo and the Dote, miles farther south. The Eyo is a mile in width 
at its mouth. Banks of rocks bar the entrance, but the left arm is 
navigable for vessels drawing two meters of water. The banks are 
marshy. M. Guiral ascended it about 30 kilometers to Iniger, where 
there are falls. It has several tributaries, some of them navigable for 
canoes. The Dote is a river of little importance, with marshy banks, 
and is about a meter deep and 40 meters wide along the lower part of its 
course. It can be ascended in a canoe for about 21 miles. The com- 
merce of the district concentrates in the village on the right bank from 
which it takes its name. (See Proceedings of Eoyal Geographical So- 
ciety, December, 1885.) 

In the Proceedings of the Eoyal Geographical Society for February, 
1885, is a long and learned article upon “European Territorial Claims 
on the Coast of the Eed Sea and its Southern Ai)proaches,” by Sir E. 
W. Eawson, than whom, perhaps, no one is better fitted to discuss this 
subject, which is of great historical as well as geographical imiiortance. 

Mr. E. H. Eichards, an American missionary, has journeyed from In- 
hambane to the Limpopo, through a region which is at present a blank 
on our maps. The Bombom Eiver forms the western boundary of the 
Portuguese province, and drains a large area of western Inhambane, as 
well as the eastern slope of the Makwakwa, Eidge to the west. The 
country west of this ridge is semi-deserted, in consequence of the raids 
of Umzila’s soldiers. From the Makwakwa Eidge to the Limpopo is 
level land. The Ama-gwaza, or people of LTmzila, inhabit or control the 
country from the Zambesi to the Limpopo, and with the exception of 
the Portuguese possessions of Chiluan and Inhambane, from the sea in 
the east to the Matabele country on the west. In a second journey Mr. 
Eichards, besides visiting a large and hitherto untravelled area, was 
successful in reaching Baleni. He left Delagoa Bay on foot, attended 
only by a Zulu convert and three porters. The Komati Eiver, 200 yards 
wide, 30 feet deep, was crossed in a “ dugout ” canoe, and its course fol- 
lowed for several days ; the river was then left and a series of thirteen 
lakes passed. Though there was no connecting stream at that season, 
the natives call this string of lakes the Liputa Eiver, but there are often 
hills and bushy districts between the lakes. Emerging from the bush 
close to the Limpopo Eiver, they found themselves at Baleni. Herds 
of cattle were visible in every direction and clusters of small huts were 
very numerous. Manjobo or Manjova, the ruling chief, has several 
kraals on the west and oneonthe east side of the river, which here runs 
through a low flat plain of indurated alluvium as hard as marble. The

river banks are about two yards high, the stream being about 15 feet 
deep and 200 yards wide. Manjobo’s kraal on the east side is called 
Emkontweni, “ the place where the spear is stuck in the ground.” The 
kraal of the Chobbas, or Machappas, is on the Limpopo, about 12 miles 
north of the Shangan Eiver, which: enters the former from the eastward, 
and is otherwise known as the Luize or Mitti Eiver. From a hill just 
eastward of the Shangan, the plain of Baleni could be seen extending 
NW. and SE. as far as the eye could reach, and about 26 miles in width. 
In the rainy season the plain is an immense pool or lake, and all the 
kraals are deserted for several months. The Shangan is salt, but good 
water can be had by digging. The people call themselves Ama Shan- 
gani, and all adults speak more or less Zulu, which is the language of 
the “ court.” Thence to Inhambane, took nine days through a most 
populous country. Bingwana, a kraal of about 5,000 inhabitants, is 
about four days from Inhambane, on the river of the same name, a deep 
but narrow stream abounding in sea-cows. The route was considerably 
south of the one taken in 1884. 

The Dutch exploring expedition into Portuguese West Africa has been 
so unfortunate as to lose its leader, young Mr. D. D. Veth, who died 
from disease on May 19, 1885, in camp on the banks of the Kala-Kanga 
Eiver, between Benguella and Humpata. 

In the October number of Petermann’s Mittlieilungen, is the first part 
of an account of the journey of the Austrian explorers, Drs. Paulitschke 
and von Hardegger, to Harar, by the former. It is accompanied by a 
map of the districts traversed. The concluding papers appear in the 
December number, in which will also be found an account and map of 
Menge’s second journey in Somali-land. 

A fresh expedition in Somali-land has been undertaken by F. L. and 
W. D. James, who write from Berbera that they intend to traverse the 
Habr Gerhajis’ country to Lebiholii, whence five days over the desert 
will bring them to Ogaden. 

The chief geographical societies in Germany have resolved to erect 
a monument to the late Dr. Hachtigal, who died April 24, on board the 
German gunboat “Mowe”, off the west coast of Africa, on Cape Palmas, 
where he lies buried. It is intended to have it go large that it will serve 
as a landmark to seamen. 

The work done by Lieutenant Wissmann, in his exploration of the 
Kassai Eiver, the great southern tributary of the Congo, is second in 
importance only to the discovery of the Congo itself. It will seriously 
modify the conjectural geography of that portion of Africa. He found 
the river to be of immense volume, and navigable from its junction with 
the Lulua. He found the Sankuru and the Lubilash to be one river 
which instead of flowing northvyard to the Congo, turns westward and 
joins the Kassai. As it approaches the Congo the Kassai receives the 
great Koango, and enters the main river by the Kwamouth, after re- 
ceiving the water of Lake Leopold. Thus the river which on Stanley’s 


556 


SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1885. 


« 

last map joins the Congo west of Stanley Falls, cannot be the LubUash, 
and moreover must be of no great length. This discovery of Lieutenant 
Wissmann, along with that of the Mobangi by Mr. Grenfell, greatly in- 
creases the navigable waterway of the Congo system. 

Besides much good detail work done by the Eev. G. Grenfell on the 
Congo, he with Eev. T. J. Comber, has recently explored the Mobangi, 
which enters the right bank of the Congo, forming a great delta, be- 
tween 26' and 42' south latitude, nearly opposite Equator Station, and 
is probably its greatest tributary. Mr. Grenfell ascended the Mobangi 
on a mean course of north by east from the equator to 4P 30' north lati- 
tude, and left it still an open waterway. At 4° 23' north, just below 
the second rapids, he found it 673 yards wide ; at no point lower was 
it less in width. Its mean depth is 25 feet, and its current not more than 
80 to 100 feet per minute. From Mr. Grenfell’s notes it would seem that 
this river is navigable the whole way from the Congo to 4° 30' north, a 
distance of probably 400 to 450 miles, taking account of the bends. 
His opinion and that of his Congo colleagues seems to be that the Mo- 
bangi is probably the lower part of the Welle, a river whose course is 
one of the unsolved problems of African geography ; but this opinion 
is scarcely sustained by the knowledge we now have of the region. 
Arguing from analogy, we should conclude that the source of the Mo- 
bangi does not lie east of 20° east longitude, and applying the meas- 
urements to Stanley’s map, the watershed falls just on the line thereon 
suggested. The distance in a direct line from the ultimate point reached 
by Mr. Grenfell to the last-known point on the Welle is 540 miles, 
and to the source of the Welle some 900 miles. It appears then to be 
practically impossible for this river (of less than the third of a mile in 
width), to carry off the water of the Welle Basin; and Mr. Stanley’s 
suggestion, that the Bujere (wrongly called the Aruwimi) is the outlet 
of the Welle is rather strengthened than otherwise by this latest, and 
certainly not least important, contribution to our knowledge of the 
mighty Congo. 

The Portuguese possess a tract of land on the northern bank of the 
Congo, extending from Cape Lembo, south of Kabinda Bay, to Massabe, 
and extending inland 30 or 40 miles so as to contain Kabinda, Molembo, 
Landana, and Massab^.. 

The whole of the valley of the Kwilu, where the International Associa- 
tion had eighteen stations, is ceded to France. M. de Brazza, recently 
returned from Africa, reports most satisfactorily from the French Posses- 
sions on the Congo ; his reports are so late as October 13, 1885. 

The limits of the new “ Kingdom of the Congo,” as recognized by the 
Berlin Conference, appear to be as follows : On the Atlantic seaboard, 
from Banana point to Gab6 (5° 45' south latitude), then by one parallel 
of Gab6 to the meridian of Ponta da Lenha, by this meridian north to 
the Chiloango, thence to the source of that river, thence to the Mtomba- 
Mataca falls of the Congo, leaving to the French the station of Mboco,

but reserving Mucumbi and Manyanga, thence along the Congo to its 
confluence with the Bamba beyond the equator, where the boundary 
running northwest remains to be determined. The southern frontier 
follows the Congo from Banana to a point a little above Nokki, the south 
bank belonging to Portugal, thence on the parallel of ITokki to the 
Koango, along this river to about 9° south latitude, and thence in a 
diagonal line across the continent to Lake Bangweolo. Eastward the 
boundary coincides with the west coasts of Lakes Bangweolo, Tangan- 
yika, Muta-lSizighe, and Albert Nyanza. Within these limits the new 
state will have an approximate area of 1,000,000 square miles, and a 
population of probably 40,000,000, mostly of Bantu speech and Negro 
or Negroid stock. 

The council of the Eoyal Geographical Society, at its meeting of June 
22, unanimously passed a vote of congratulation to the King of the 
Belgians on the success which has attended his work of exploration and 
civilization in tropical Africa. The resolution was as follows : “ That 
the thanks of the council be conveyed to King Leopold II, the King of 
the Belgians, for the interest taken by His Majesty in the exploration of 
Africa, and respectful congratulations on the signal success which has 
attended the schemes promoted by His Majesty’s wisdom and munifi- 
cence.” In acknowledging this communication officially. His Majesty 
expressed his great satisfaction at knowing that his efforts to introduce 
civilization into the heart of Africa are appreciated by such high and 
competent authority. 

Bulletin No. 3, 1885, of the Eoyal Geographical Society of Belgium, 
contains a paper by the secretary on the Congo question, describing 
the explorations made in the basin between 1485 and 1877, the founda- 
tion of the International Association, the creation of the Free State, and 
finally a description of the' basin. 

Volume VIII, No. 2, of the Oeograpliische Blatter, published by the 
Bremen Geographical Society, contains a similar paper by Dr. Oppel, 
dealing with the scientific and economical importance of this district. 
The paper is divided into two main sections : (1) The discovery and in- 
vestigation of the Congo {a) between 1484 and 1872, (&) the systematic 
exploration since 1872 ; (2) the extent and boundaries, geology, &c., of 
the Congo region. While surprisingly alike in general features, these 
two papers are by no means coincident, since both show independent 
thought and preparation, and indeed treat the same subject from quite 
different standpoints. 

Science for August 23, 1885, contains an excellent map of the Congo 
Basin, reproduced by permission of Harper & Brothers. 

Among the recent scientific missions ordered by the French minister 
of public instruction is that under Lieutenant Palat, to explore the 
route from Senegal to Algeria by Medina, Timbuctoo, Mabrouk, and 
the Touat. 

Spain has recently acquired considerable territory in Africa, com-

prising the west coast of the Sahara between Cape Bogodor (20° 9' north) 
and Cape Blanco (20° 45' north), both included ; and in the Gulf of 
Guinea, the coast line from the Muni Eiver, which forms the northern 
boundary of the French possessions on the Gaboon, to the Eio Compo 
(0° 43' to 2° 41' north). Six stations have already been established on 
the Sahara coast, and all points giving access to shipping will be per- 
manently occupied. Old treaties with the chiefs on the Eio Benito 
have been renewed, with a view to prevent the threatened advance of 
the French in that direction. 

The conductor of the Cartographic Institute, Hamburg, Herr L. 
Friedrichsen, writes thus concerning the limits of the German posses- 
sions in West Africa: ‘‘The Mahin district, on the Gulf of Benin, be- 
tween Lagos and the mouth of the Mger, settled by the Hamburg firm 
of G. L. Gaiser, has not yet been placed under German protection, The 
coast from Jaboo to Old Calabar will, in my opinion, be in future re- 
garded as under British protection, but has not hitherto been officially 
placed under any European power. The frontier of the German Cam- 
eroon begins with the Ethiopian cataract on the Great Eiver, lying from 
there in a southwesterly direction to the sources of the Eio del Eey, 
following the right bank of this river to the coast, then the coast line 
in a southeasterly direction to the river Behuwe, excluding the town and 
neighborhood of Victoria as British, as well as the island of Malimba. 
The latter, as well as the whole coast from the river Behuwe to Gumbe- 
gumbe, is not described by me in the commissions of foreign officials as 
without a ruler, but as atract on which the actual raising of the German 
flag is yet the subject of diplomatic treaty. The German protectorate 
in Southwest Africa begins with 18° south latitude, not with Cape Frio.” 

Dr. Ballay, in an address on the new possessions of France in Africa, 
sums up by saying that while the Ogow4 can never be rendered navi- 
gable, it can at least be made useful for bateaux. Its basin is naturally 
fertile and rich in resources. On the other hand, the country extend- 
ing from this basin to the Congo is generally sterile. There is little to 
hope for from this region, but it is the beginning of the practicable 
route for reaching the trade of the upper region, which has inhabitants 
of intelligence and thrift. The protectorate of France now extends 
along the whole north coast of the Gulf of Tadjura as far as Bahr-Aseal, 
and M. Caspar! states that the relations of France with the Danakils 
are cordial. Obock is at least a safe and easily accessible harbor', and 
the abundance of water renders possible the cultivation of vegetables. 

The fifth expedition of the Belgian International African Association, 
which started with a view of connecting by a chain of stations the east 
coast with the interior basin, has returned, the expense proving too 
great to render the project profitable. The efforts of the association at 
present will probably be confined to the Congo watershed. 

Some Swedish merchants have purchased in the Massanja country, 
in the Cameroons, some 20 square miles of land, on which the Swed-

ish flag was hoisted with proper honors some months ago. They state 
that had they been so empowered by the Swedish Government, on land- 
ing two years ago, they could have taken possession of the country from 
Boto, near Victoria, to Eio del Eey, one of the richest tracts of land on 
the west coast of Africa. At present they trade at their own risk. 

The Swedish Society of Anthropology and Geography has commis- 
sioned Baron Schwerin, professor of geography at the University of 
Lund, to proceed to the Congo on a scientific expedition, the chief ob- 
jects being to make geographical, meteorological, botanical, and zoolog- 
ical studies in the new state, and to collect ethnographical objects. 
Barons Eordenskjold and Dickson have lent the expedition a number of 
valuable instruments. 

The Bulletin of the Italian Geographical Society for September con- 
tains extracts from the unpublished journals of Pellegrino Matteucci, 
the African traveller. These have been edited by Della Vedova, and 
are illustrated by a map showing the itinerary, and also the routes of 
Ifachtigal and Eohlfs. Matteucci’s journey, one of the most remarkable 
on record, extending from the Eed Sea at Suakim to Lake Chad, and 
thence to the Niger and the Gulf of Guinea, has hardly attracted the 
attention it deserves, chiefly perhaps on account of the early death of 
this promising and brilliant explorer. 

The roll of geographical journals is increased by one. The Ploren- 
tine section of the Italian African Society has been authorized by the 
central council and treasurer to issue a bulletin. It is intended to be 
partly eclectic, presenting geographical and especially African news to 
its readers, and to be particularly the official record of the proceedings 
of the section. 

ASIA. 

At the June meeting of the Geographical Society of Paris, Baron 
Benoist-Mechin described a recent journey in the Merv oasis. This was 
a continuation of previous communications to the society of the great 
journey made by the baron and some companions from Peking, through 
Kirin to Ninguto, and thence along the Tinmen to Vladivostock. The 
journey the whole way was along the Corean frontier. From Yladivo- 
stock the travellers procetded to Tomsk, thence to Samarkand, through 
Karshi to Bokhara, to the Amou-Darya at Gharjni, down that, river to 
Petro-Alexandrovsk, thence to Khiva, and lastly across the Kara-Kura 
to Mero, Sarakho, and Meshed.- The detailed narrative (with maps) is 
given in the bulletin of the society. At the same meeting M. de Saint- 
Pol Lias presented a map of the upper course of the Eed Eiver, pre- 
pared by the Anamites. Another map of importance is that of the 
navigable water-ways of Southern India-Ohina, prepared by M. Eueff, 
vho has established a company for navigating those waters. 

Herr Glaser, the Arabian traveller, has returned to Arabia to resume 
his explorations. This second journey is to be mainly geographical, 


560 


SCIENTIFIC EECOKD FOR 1885. 


but archaeology will also receive attention. Besides visits to Marib and 
Nejdran, Herr Glaser contemplates a long journey through the interior 
from Hadramant to Omaun, and a second across South Arabia. 

In Science, July 3, 1885, is an excellent epitome of an article on 
“ Routes into the interior of Western China,” which originally appeared 
in Science et Nature. The two Chinese rivers (Sikiang, or Canton Eiver, 
and Song Ka) must for the present be considered as impracticable for 
commercial purposes, not precisely on account of the natural obstacles 
to be overcome, but because for a long time the Celestial Empire will be 
more or less impenetrable and dangerous for Europeans: and, on the 
other hand, the course of the Me-Kong is too long and too hilly. The 
routes which traverse the bed of the Brahmapootra and the valley of the 
Irrawaddi present almost insuperable difficulties. The route of the 
Salmen is most attractive, but it should not be forgotten that besides 
its length it must cross two water sheds, one of which at least is very 
difficult, and must ascend the Me-Kong for a very long distance. The 
route by the Bed Eiver remains: this is not particularly accessible; but 
to establish communication with Yunnan and Szchuen some obstacles 
must be surmounted, and this is the course which offers fewest of them. 

Mr. Holt S. Hallett has finished his reconnaissance for railway routes 
in India-China, and the narrative of his journey, while not furnishing 
anything absolutely new, serves to enlarge our knowledge of the geog- 
raphy of that interesting region. 

The chief paper in the May issue of the Proceedings of the Eoyal 
Geographical Society is upon the disputed question of the sources of 
the Irrawaddi. As no one has yet followed the Sanpo ffiom Thibet 
downward, it is still unproved Avhether it enters the Irrawaddi or the 
Brahmapootra. Mr. Robert Gordon opposes the commonly received idea 
by advocating the Irrawaddi view, and gives six substantial reasons for 
his belief. General J. T. Walker, differing from Mr. Gordon, attacked 
the weakest point in his paper, that in which he thinks that the Zayul 
Chu may prove to be an affluent of the Irrawaddi. 

Colonel Woodthorpe has just completed a journey through the Sing- 
pho, or Sanpo country. He penetrated into the land of the Bo'rkhamp- 
tis, on the Northern Irrawaddi, where no traveller is believed to have 
been since Lieutenant Wilcox’s tour in 1828. The Irrawaddi is un- 
navigable at Pedan. 

A writer who has just travelled widely through Tonquin and Southern 
China describes in a recent number of the Bepuilique Frangaise the 
route from Lao-Kai, on the Red River, to Meng-tsze in Yunnan. Pre- 
mising that the river from the mouth to Lao-Kai on the Tonquin border 
is tolerably well known, he refers to the various routes for getting into 
Southwestern China, but is far from enthusiastic about any of them, 
although he thinks that France in Tonquin has as much chance of get- 
ting the China trade as any of her rivals in the south. The writer then 
describes the route along the river from Lao-Kai to Manhao, the head

of the Eecl Eiver navigation. From this point the road to the plateau 
of Yunnan is said to be mountainous and difficult in the extreme. The 
article is of special value at this time, when the commercial geography 
of Southeastern Asia promises so much of importance. 

The journeys of Dr. Neis in Central Taos (more than 3,000 miles) 
have resulted in a vast amount of information regarding the commercial 
routes of the western basin of the Me-Kong, the anthropology and eth- 
nology of the Laos and the Khas, and the social, commercial, and politi- 
cal condition of the regions visited. 

In a recent consular report from Siam, !Mr. Archer gives an account 
of his journey into the province of Kabin, which lies on the eastern 
side of the Siamese delta, at the foot of the mountains separating the 
Mimam Valley from the Me-Kong. He gives some very interesting notes 
on the little-known Laos. 

The Government of India has conferred the title of Eaj Bahadoor 
and a grant in perpetuity of a rent-free village in Oude on Pundit Ki- 
shen Singh Milwal, an employe of the survey department, who is well 
known to all geographers for his explorations in Thibet, which have 
been published over the initials “A. K.” 

Colonels Lockhart and Woodthorpe have been sent with a party to 
Gilghit, and it is intended that full surveys of the region lying to the 
northwest of Kashmir shall be executed. Several passes of no great 
difficulty lead toward the Eussian possessions, wffiich here approach 
British ludia closely. This mission is expected to largely increase our 
knowledge of the country toward the upper waters of the Oxus. Dan- 
ileff, in examining this river, has found what he reports to be the point 
of its ancient bifurcation into the Amu Daria and the TJzboi. 

Sir Henry Eawlinson has added considerable to our knowledge of the 
Badghis district, in Northern Afghanistan, north of the watershed of 
the Herat Valley. The September issue of the Proceedings of the 
Eoyal Geographical Society contains a map of the territory about the 
Hari-Eud and Murghab Eivers, including the Badghis — the district 
the possession of which is now in dispute between Eussia on the one 
hand, and Afghanistan and England on the other. The American 
Naturalist for December, 1885, contains an interesting account of this 
section, and a concise history of the Garolines. 

Up to July, 1885, the Afghan Prontier Commission had worked through 
districts already explored more or less in recent times, either by the 
Eussian s or others. Since then comparatively new ground has been 
broken, from which much of great geographical interest may be con- 
fidently expected. One very important matter has been accomplished, 
i. e., the exact determination by Captain Gore of the longitude of the 
great dome at Mashhad, longitude 59° 35' 52". 3, latitude 36° 17' 42". 
The result shows an apparent error of only eleven seconds in longitude 
at the end of a long line of more than 1,000 miles of survey from India. 
Captain Talbst has started to carry on triangulation to the head of

Hari-Eud, with permission to proceed as far as Daulafyar. A native 
surveyor has started southward across the many apparently parallel 
ranges (quite unlike anything shown at present on our maps) between 
the Upper Hari-Eud and Gaur, or Zarni. Another native surveyor has 
started for the Upper Murghab and Ferozkohi country to survey the 
direct routes to Mannana from Obeh, across the Band-i-Turkestan, 

Lieut. Col. H. C. B. Tanner, S. G., deputy-superintendent of the survey 
of India, in charge of Darjeeling and I^epaul boundary surveys, makes 
some exceedingly interesting communications on the Himalayan snow 
peaks. 

An account of M. Potanin’s journey from Peking to Lang-tcheou, in 
1884, was given in the Eussian Izvestia. The country between the Yel- 
low Eiver and Boro-balgasun is covered with sand, rarely moving sand, 
.but harTihans fortified by a growth of sMapyJc, a species of Artemesia^J 
with bushes of cavagana in the cavities between. Water is plentiful. 
The dry grounds between the sands are covered with steppe vegeta- 
tion, and sarrazin, millet, and hemp are grown there. The Orthous in- 
habit this region. Boro-balgasun was once a town, but now contains only 
a few huts within its ruined walls. At Bdjin-Khoro, on the Tchamb- 
Kak Eiver, are two tents, in which the bones of Zenghis Elhan are said 
to be preserved. After leaving Boro-balgasun, the expedition visited 
the salt lake Baga-Shikye and passed over an almost uninhabited re- 
gion, with ruins of Mussulman villages, destroyed when the last insur- 
rection was put down. Lin-tcheou, on the Hoang-ho, is surrounded bj"^ 
fruit gardens, and for 50 miles south of it numerous villages extend 
along a canal which runs parallel to the Hoang-ho. This richness is of 
recent origin, for the whole region bears traces of the desolation wrought 
by the Chinese after the suppression of the insurrection of which the 
town of Tsin-tsipou was the center. South of this town M. Potanin left 
the Hoang-ho and crossed the series of flat ridges, which rise from 6,000 
to 7,000 feet above the sea, and are covered with loess to a thickjiess of 
200 to 300 feet. The sandstone of these hills contains some beds of 
salt. The loess covers the whole country from Ping-yang-sia to Lang- 
tcheou, which is a great city, picturesquely built on the right bank of 
the Hoang-ho, at the foot of a mountain. The population is of Turkish 
origin, and although it has assumed Chinese customs, it keeps its Mus- 
sulman religion. The latest news from this expedition was dated San- 
chuan, January 25, 1885. It had gone up the Hoang-ho and event- 
ually reached the confluence of the Tchitai with the Yellow Erver. M. 
Berezovsky had left the expedition and taken another route, via Hoy- 
syan. He proposes to join MM. Potanin and Skasi on* their way to the 
south. 

Colonel Prejevalsky has discovered three peaks, each over 20,000 feet 
high, in the middle range of the Kuen-lun. He has given them the 
names of Muscovite, Columbus, and Enigmatical. The most elevated 
point of the first named is Mount Kremlin ; of the second Mount Djinri;

and of the third, the crown of Monomachus. The plateau skirting the 
middle Kuen-lun has an average height of 4,000 feet. It appears from 
a telegram from Colonel Prejevalsky, dated Osh, August 31, that this in- 
trepid explorer has again failed to penetrate into Thibet over the Keria 
Mountains, in consequence of the strenuous opposition of the Chinese, 
who barricaded all the available highways with stones and destroyed the 
bridges. The Invalide Busse publishes the following telegram from Col- 
onel Prejevalsky from Pishpet, but dated Karakol 2d (new style 14th) 
November : “ Our voyage has ended happily and with most encouraging 
scientific results.” (See Proceedings of the Eoyal Geographical'Society 
for December, 1885.) 

Dr. Z^landt has finished his work on the Kirgiz, which will soon be 
published by the West Siberian section of the Imperial Geographical 
Society. 

A parliamentary blue book (Corea No. 3, 1885), lately published, con- 
tains the report of a journey made by Mr. Carles the vice-consul at Soul, 
from that place to Phyong Kang, where some gold mines exist. The 
review of this in Nature, August 27, shows that it contains much of 
geographical interest. 

Mr. Gardner, British consul at Newchwang, China, publishes with hi^ 
annual trade report this year (China, No. 6, 1885) a most interesting ac- 
count of his consular district, which embraces the whole of Manchuria. 
The report corrects some of the errors existing on our maps, which are 
far from accurate. 

It is to be hoped that the many rumors of prospective activity in 
railway building in China may be found to be well grounded. The 
necessary surveys would be of incalculable service in correcting the 
maps of the various provinces. These maps are mainly the work of the 
early Jesuits, and though remarkable, when one considers the material 
with which they worked, are still far from what they ought to be. 

Port Hamilton, of which England took possession at the time when 
hostilities with Eussia were imminent, consists of a group of small is- 
lands about 45 miles northeast of Quelpaert and about 30 miles off the 
Corean coast, in the Brougham Channel, separating the peninsula from 
Japan. The position of the group is 34° 1' 23'^ north latitude and 127° 
17' 30" east longitude. England has since given up her claims. 

Sibiriakoff, the wealthy Eussian merchant, well known as the friend 
and patron of Nordenskjold, has himself made an interesting journey 
during the summer of 1884. The details of it have only recently been 
made public, as news travels slowly in those regions. He ascended the 
Petchora to Oraneto, then crossed the Ural to the Sigva, or Whitefish 
Eiver, which joins the Sosva, an affluent of the Obi. The traveller 
reached Shikurik September 21, and Tobolsk October 18. It is demon- 
strated by this journey that a trade route by which goods can be car- 
ried in summer is practically open in this direction, a matter of great" 
commercial importance to Siberia.

SCIENTIFIC KECOED FOE 1885. 


An exploration to cover a period' of five years is being organized by 
Yadrintseft’, under the auspices of the Russian Geographical Society. 
Its purpose is the investigation of the ethnology and social economy of 
Siberia ; particular attention will be given to opportunities for extend- 
ing and correcting geographical knowledge. 

The trans-Siberian railway has already finished its first section of 135 
kilometers between Ekaterinburg and Kameshoff, and its early comple- 
tion to Tuimen is confidently expected. At each step in its advance- 
ment the geographical advantages to be derived from this commercial 
enterprise will be more marked. 

Preparations are being made for the expedition under Dr. Bunge and 
Baron von Toll, which will start next spring for Ustyansk, for the ex- 
ploration of the New Siberian Islands, which since Anjou’s journeys in 
1821-’23 have only been visited by the unfortunate Jeannette people 
for a few hours on their route to the mouth of the Lena. 

The geographical effects of the Krakatoa eruption, while of great im- 
portance, are of too local a nature to be properly considered under 
“ progress in geography.” 

Great Britain has annexed the territory of the ex-King Thebaw to her 
India possessions. . 

In the province of Adana, Asia Minor, not far from Tarsus, at a few 
hours’ travel from the sea, among the mountains, has recently been dis- 
covered a ruined town hitherto entirely unknown. The ruins lie near 
the route from S41ef-k6 to Karaman, by Mohara. Sarcophagi, almost 
intact, and resembling those of Lycia, exist there and would seem 
worthy of study. 

Russian geographical exploration of the Caucasus has begun. MM. 
Djiu and Dimick have traveled among its glaciers, climb ed its passes, 
and given an account of their travels in Petermann’s MitfJieilungen. 
TJshpa is estimated at 16,500 feet high, and Tetuuld at 15,500 feet or 
thereabouts. 

It is stated that an accurate survey of the island of Tezo and the 
neighboring islands (especially the Kuriles) is to be made by the Jap- 
anese naval department. It is anticipated that the work will occupy 
four years. 

The Zeitschrift of the Gesellschaft fiir Erdkunde in Berlin (Vol. xx, 
No. 3) is almost wholly filled with an account by Herr Schmidt of the 
travels of the friar Rubruk, between 1253 and 1255, into the heart of 
Central Asia and to the borders of China. 

ETJEOPE. 

The lectures given under the auspices of the Geographical Society of 
Paris, in the spring of 1884, were so successful that they were resumed 
this year. The names of some of the lecturers give us an idea of the 
importance attached to the subject of geography in Europe : Janssen, de 
Lapparent, Bouquet de la Grye, Dr. Hamy, Himly, Levasseur, Louis

Simonin, Micbel. It would be of the greatest benefit to this country if 
a society co-ordinate with the Geographical Society of Paris, having its 
headquarters at Washington, could arrange for a course of lectures by 
some of the confreres in this country of the above-named gentlemen. 

Under the title of O'Explorador {the Explorer), a Portuguese journal 
commenced its appearance with the first of the year at Lisbon. It ap- 
pears twice a month, and will chronicle the advance of science in all its 
branches, but especially that of geography and travel. 

In March appeared the first number of the Scottish Geographical Mag- 
azine, the organ of the new Scottish Geographical Society. It aims at 
being much more than the organ of the society, however. 

At the March meeting of the Geographical Society of Paris, Mr. 
Charles Eabot described the results of the mission with which he was 
charged by the minister of public instruction to explore Northern Fin- 
land and Eussian Lapland. He explained especially the valleys of the 
Pasvig and Talom, as well as Lake Enara. It has hitherto always been 
believed that the highest mountain in Sweden was Sulitjelma, on the 
Norwegian frontier, in latitude 67° 16' north, and belonging as much to 
Norway as to Sweden, the height of which is a little more than 6,000 
feet. In 1884 the topographical surveyor of the province of Norrland 
found that another mountain, viz, Sarjektjfikko, 6,760 feet in Swedish 
Lapland, was higher than Sulitjelma ; but now it has been discovered 
that neither is this mountain the highest in Sweden, Bucht Svenonius 
and Mr. Eabot state that the honor belongs to Kebnekaisse, latitude 
68°, also in that province, the height of which has been ascertained to 
be 6,940 feet above the level of the sea. In the same neighborhood is 
Kaskasatjokko, 6,800 feet. The observations of Mr. Eabot in the 
mountainous area of Store Baergfefjeld, in Nordland, Arctic Norway, 
represented on the best charts as occupied by an immense continuous 
glacier field, show that it has been wholly misunderstood. There is no 
primary glacier, but merely seven secondary glaciers, isolated in ravines, 
and hardly passing beyond the stage of n6v^. Eabot afterward made 
explorations in the Kola peninsula of Eussian Finland, determining the 
existence of three distinct chains of mountains between the Polar and 
White Seas, which reach a height of more than 3,000 feet. The country 
has hitherto been charted as a sort of plain, broken merely by lakes and 
low hills. The area between the ranges is level, and trees of good size 
and form reach latitude 68° 50'; beyond they extend some distance, 
but do not exceed 12 or 15 feet in height. 

In the “ Elementar larooarken ” (classical schools) of Sweden, geog- 
raphy has hitherto been classed as an appendix to history, and at the 
“Lektor” (candidate) examinations in history and geography, questions 
are only asked about the former. At the congress of teachers held in 
Stockholm last year, a resolution was adopted to the effect that geog- 
raphy ought to form a separate study of the school education. 

A somewhat amusing quarrel has arisen between the parishes of 


566 


SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1885. 


Kjelvik and Maasd (IN'orway) about a point of considerable geographical 
interest, viz, the proprietorship of the North Cape. It is caused by 
the establishment on the celebrated promontory of a restaurant, the 
taxes of which are claimed by both parishes. The cape has always 
been considered to form the boundary between the two, without it be- 
ing stipulated to which it actually belonged. 

The well-known rocky islet Munken (the Monk), which lies miles 
south of Sumbo, and formerly rose to a height of 70 feet above the sea, 
has completely subsided. A considerable portion of it had crumbled 
away last year, but it is now no higher than the low surrounding rocks, 
so that even in tolerably fine weather the sea breaks over and covers it. 
The shoal water about the islet causes such dangerous currents that 
the seamen of olden times believed there was a Malstrbm there, and it 
is therefore very unfortunate that this rock, which served as a sea-mark, 
will no longer warn navigators of their approach to danger. 

From recent observations it would appear that during the last thirty 
years or so the rising of the shores around the Baltic and Gulf of Both- 
nia has gone on with greater rapidity than during the previous period 
of observation. The increased rate of emergence in recent times is 
clearly shown on the rock known as Stora Eeppen, not far from Pitea, 
Sweden. That rock in 1851 had emerged 94 centimeters above its former 
level since the commencement of the observations ; while in August, 
1884, it had risen 50 centimeters more. The general results compared 
with previous observations — that is for a period of one hundred and 
thirty -four years — prove that since 1750 the head of the Gulf of Bothnia 
has risen 2.10 meters, or 1.70 meters per century. This rate of emergence 
declines progressively toward the south. It is not more than 30 centime- 
ters at Naze, and it is zero at Bornholm. The mean rise of the Swedish 
coast is, thus 1.60 meters per century. 

A very useful and complete atlas of Eussia has been prepared by J. 
Poddubnyi, and published by A. Deubner, St. Petersburg, under the 
title of a “Eussian school atlas,” at the small price of one ruble, or 80 
cents. 

The project of connecting the Volga and the Don, which dates back 
to 1668, when Selim, the son of Solyman the Magnificent, besieging As- 
trakhan, attempted to join the two rivers in order to transport materials 
of war, has been revived. M. L6on Dru, a French engineer, having sur- 
veyed a line in October, 1885, was convinced that the project is practi- 
cable, and experimental borings have already commenced. 

The attention of geographers and men of science ought to be called 
to several numbers of the ArcMv filr die naturwissenschaftUche Landes- 
durchforscJiung von Bdhmen, which have recently been issued (Prague, 
Franz Ezuonatz). The numbers of most interest to geographers pure 
and simple are those forming the first division of the third volume, aud 
containing a list of the heights in Bohemia, trigonometrically determined 
by the Imperial Institute of Military Geography in the years 1877-’79.

The first steamer coming directly from the open sea arrived at Co- 
logne on March 18, 1885. It was called the Industry, and was of 613 
tons burden. 

The Austrian Government, with the consent of the Porte, has under- 
taken to make a geographical survey of the Albanian coast, with a view 
to preparing new maps. Two Austrian gunboats have accordingly left 
Corfu with officials of the chart department on board. They were joined 
by the Turkish officers, under whose superintendence the survey will 
be made. We may expect some definite results in the course of the next 
six months. 

The Hungarian Society of Geography is engaged in organizing a Mag- 
yar expedition for the exploration of the region around the Urals; es- 
pecially the Baskir country, where Urals- Altau peoples are disappear- 
ing. 

The Military Geographical Institute of Italy has published a memoir 
on the mensuration of the area of the Kingdom of Italy, with a new 
approximate estimate of the same. The figures are as follows, in square 


kilometers : 

The peninsula of Italy 236, 402" 1720 

The islets legally connected with its shores 368' 8649 

SicHy - 25,461-2535 

The Sicilian islets 278- 8147 

Sardinia 23,799-5607 

The Sardinian islets 277-6027 


Total 286,588-3000 


This equals 110,652 square miles, and is about 10,000 square kilome- 
ters less than previous official figures, and 2,000 less than General Steb- 
nitski’s estimate. 

Thoroddson’s work in Iceland in 1884 seems to have been much fuller 
and more precise than the notes hitherto published would indicate. 
From the narrative published in Globus, it appears that in a journey of 
ten weeks over the Od^dahraun desert and the adjacent mountains, 
about one-half was passed in an uninhabited region, much of which 
was completely unknown. He forced his way along the northern base 
of Vatna Jokull, the journey being frequently hazardous and always 
laborious. Many corrections of heights were made; and it seems that 
Jokulsa, which has been taken as the longest Icelandic river, is ex- 
ceeded by Thiorsa, which is some 120 miles in length. An ascent of 
the unvisited Dyngja Volcano was made. It proved to have a double 
crater, the inner one being 600 feet or more in depth. 

NORTH AMERICA. 

The work of the several departments of Governments having to do 
with geodesy, geography, and hydrography has made satisfactory prog- 
ress. In no one of them however has there been any special develop-

ment of more than usual importance, while the routine work thereof — 
as well as that of the several State surveys, will be published in the 
respective reports. The topographic work of the United States Geo- 
logical Survey during the past six months has been mainly in the office; 
the geographical map of the United States is rapidly approaching com- 
pletion. 

Prof. Asaph Hall, in Science^ July 3, corrects the statement con- 
tained in the current edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica, that there 
is no land in Connecticut “ above a thousand feet in elevation,” and 
shows that there are certainly half a dozen points which exceed this 
limit, aiid at least two that run over two thousand feet. 

The Arctic steamer “Alert” returned to Halifax on October 18, from 
Hudson’s Bay, with the observation party which has spent fifteen mouths 
there testing the practicability of that route for navigation from the 
Canadian ISTortheast to Euroi)e. They show the average temperature 
to be not so low as the average winter temperature in the Northwest. 
The lowest monthly average was 30° below zero. The ice observations 
show that Hudson Straits and Bay are navigable for properly built 
and equipped vessels for from three to four months, from July to Oc- 
tober. 

G. W. Dawson {Science, April 24) describes the Saskatchewan country, 
or that portion of the prairies which extends north of the northern 
boundary, as containing an approximate area of 300,000 square miles, 
and as less than 2,000 feet above the sea level, and thus lower than the 
corresponding portion of the continent farther south. Many interest- 
ing details will be found in this article. 

So far as heard from, explorations in Alaska appear to consist of 
the journeys of Lieut. H. T. Allen and his companions ; Lieutenant 
Cantwell; Assistant Engineer Samuel B.McLeneganand Seaman Nelson 
of the “Corwin”; Henry D. Woolfe; Lieutenant Stoney; and Doctor 
Everette. 

Lieutenant Allen was sent by General Miles last year. He ascended 
the Copper or Atna Eiver and explored its northern and western branch 
to its source, a distance of some 200 or 300 miles. He found the river 
rapid, with many cataracts, and having in some places a fall of 7 feet to 
the mile. Its width is variable, sometimes several miles, including large 
islands, at others but a few hundred feet. There are many glaciers 
near it, and the active Wrangel volcano rises almost from the river. 
A portage was made across this range to the sources of the Tananah, 
where there are a number of extensive lakes. This river was reached 
about 125 miles above the point to which it had been explored, and it 
and the Yukon were followed to the sea. 

Lieutenant Cantwell has succeeded in getting to the source of the 
Kowak Eiver, which consists of four large lakes, of which the most im- 
portant is in latitude 67°, longitude 153° west. It is suj)posed to be 520 
miles from the mouth of the river.

Assistant Engineer Samuel B. McLenegan, accompanied only by 
Seaman Nelson of the “Corwin,” ascended the Noatak, also called the 
Nunatah or Inland Eiver, which has been known for thirty years, but 
never explored. Its enters Hotham Inlet westward from the Kowak 
11 ud about 30 miles north of the Arctic circle. The source of the branch 
ascended was found to be a small lake surrounded by snow-banks, and 
supposed to. be 400 miles from the mouth. The voyage was extremely 
creditable to those who took part in it, though it is greatly to be re- 
gretted that exact observations could not have been made, and is 
noteworthy, as the party reached the highest latitude yet attained by 
white men in the interior of Alaska. The report and charts, which are 
being prepared by the Department, will doubtless fill a good part of the 
existing blank on the maps of this area. , 

Mr. Henry D. Woolfe, who has been stationed at Cape Lisburne during 
the past year, has travelled along the coast from that point to Hotham 
Inlet, and ascended the Noatak about 30 miles. Between the Corwin 
Lagoon and Cape Krusenstern a river falls into the sea, which he was 
informed is connected with th'e Noatak, running behind the hills which 
lie back of Shesholik village. Mr. Woolfe is preparing a map showing 
all the native settlements and even single huts temporarily occupied 
along the coast between Cape Krusenstern and Point Barrow. 

Lieutenant Stoney’s work, so far as it has gone, seems to be successful. 
He sent down a mail by the “Corwin”, which arrived in San Francisco 
October 12. At that time he was near the head of Hotham Inlet and 
prepared to go into winter quarters. Details will not be published for 
a year yet. 

Doctor Everette has collected a large amount of geographical data 
and made sketches along the Yukon, which will serve to enlarge our 
knowledge of Alaska and correct our maps. 

M. Violet d’Aouest’s note, read at the August meeting of the Geo- 
graphical Society of Paris, on the aerial formation of soil will be found 
of great interest to geographers ; a concise resume is given in the Pro- 
ceedings of the Koyal Geographical Society for September. 

The Danish exploring expedition to the east coast of Greenland under 
Lieutenants Holm and Garde, which returned to Copenhagen in October 
after a three years’ absence, has fulfilled all expectations, having reached 
latitude 66° 08' north, the northernmost point (on East Greenland) ever 
attained by Europeans. Lieutenant Holm is stated to have made some 
very valuable geographical and ethnological discoveries, having spent 
last winter among East Greenlanders never before visited by Euro- 
peans. He has named the stretch of coast explored. King Christian 
IX’s Laud. He considers it is now settled beyond a doubt that no early 
Scandinavian remains occur on the east coast. 

Idr. Gamel, the owner of the vessel which has been put at Lieutenant 
Hovgaard’s disposal for explorations in the Kara Sea in the summer of 
1885, intends (provided his enterprise be seconded by the Government) 


570 


SCIENTIFIC EECOED FOE 1885. 


to send Ms steamer “Dijmplina” next summer on an expedition to the 
east coast of Greenland under an officer of the Danish royal navy, to 
explore and lay down the coast line between 66° 08' (the farthest north- 
ward point attained by Lieutenant Holm’s expedition) and 70°. 

SOUTH AMBEICA. 

Professor Seelstrang, of the University of Cordoba, has been ap- 
pointed by the Argentine Government to superintend the publication 
of an atlas of the Eepublic, and a considerable sum ha s been appropri- 
ated for the work. It is to consist of 27 parts, and 4 of these are already 
in hand. 

The Dutch scientific expedition in March and April last, to examine 
the upper qpurse of the Surinam Eiver, was quite successful. At Ber- 
gendal they took the height of the neighboring Blue Mountain, which 
they ascended and from which they had a view of the various mountain 
chains oGSurinarn. 

M. Alcenar QSraripe read a paper on geographical neology and neog- 
raphy before the Geographical Society of Eio de Janeiro, in which he 
asks if there shall be a geographic neology for Brazil ; a correction of 
orthography ; and if so, how these can be brought about. The questions 
were referred to a commission, whose report has not yet been received. 

The Bolletino of the Italian Geographical Society for July prints two 
un-edited letters of early Italian adventurers in South America, recently 
brought to light in the archives of Florence and Modena. The longer 
and more important, dated December 24, 1534, is addressed from Valen- 
zuela (Venezuela) by a certain Tomaso Fiaschi to his brother in Flor- 
ence. 

Details of Mr. im Thurm’s journey to Mount Eoraima, British Guiana, 
are given by Mr. H. I. Perkins, who accompanied Mr. im Thurm, in the 
August number of the Proceedings of the Eoyal Geographical Society, 
and an illustrated article in Nature; April 30, 1885; vol. xxxi, pp. 
607-10. 

The Argentine expeditions into Patagonia have raised the agronomic 
credit of that country, which has long been supposed arid and sterile. 
The report of General ViUejas, and that of Colonel Eoa, who has trav- 
elled more than 500 leagues in Patagonia, affirm that the region near 
the base of the mountains is rich, not only in metals and minerals, but 
in fertile valleys which nestle between spurs of the range. With steam 
transportation between the mountains and the coast, it is affirmed that 
rapid growth of population might be expected and that prosperous com- 
munities might be established. 

A party commanded by Feilberg, and sent out by the Argentine Gov- 
ernment to explore the Pilcomayo, found that a trade route via that 
river to Bolivia is not feasible. Below the rapids, 60 leagues above the 
mouth, the Pilcomayo receives an affluent not marked on any chart, 
but with as much water as the Pilcomayo or perhaps more.

As a good example of what comprehensive geographical observation 
ought to be, we refer to Dr. W. Sievers’s account of his travels in Vene- 
zuela, which appeared in the Mittheilungen of the Hamburg Geograph- 
ical Society for 1884. He gives some interesting details of the effects 
still to be traced of the great earthquake which shook the north coast 
of South America on March 26, 1812, and describes a journey he 
made from Caracas to Puerto Cabello in November and December, 1884. 
Dr. Sievers was a pupil of Professors Eichtofen and Wagner, and was 
trained as a geographer with a view to geographical explorations. 

Mr. E. H. Glaisher’s journey on the Berbice River and Wieroonie 
Creek will add materially to our knowledge of the interior of British 
Guiana, which has been almost a terra incognita. 

M. Coudrean has — as the result of one of his six journeys in Guiana — 
brought back materials for two new maps, the one of the region between 
the Oyapock, Yari, Amazons, and Atlantic, the other of Southern Gui- 
ana between the Branco and Paru. 

M. J. Chaffaujon’s explorations on the Orinoco have already corrected 
many errors in the charts of its course. M. Thouar has gone on a new 
expedition to complete his work on the same river. 

OCBANICA. 

The first annual meeting of the Victoria branch of the Geographical 
Society of Australia was a most flattering success. The contributions 
were numerous, and many of them by distinguished authors. 

Mr. B. Greenebaum, United States consul at Samoa, reports that a new 
island has been thrown up out of the sea about 40 miles off the Tonga 
Islands, bearing towards the Fiji Islands, and in the track of California 
vessels. It is 2 miles long and 250 feet high, and is in latitude 20° 28' 
south and longitude 175° 21' west. Mr. Shipley, consul at Auckland, 
New Zealand, confirms the above in a report to the State Department, 
and gives interesting particulars. He thinks the island is at least 2 or 
3 miles long and 60 feet high, in latitude 20° 21' south, longitude 175° 
28' west. 

The death is announced from Sydney of Thomas Boyd, the first man 
to cross the Murray River and the last surviving member of Hume and 
Hovell’s exploring party. 

An excellent description and r4sum6 of the history of the Caroline 
and Pelew Islands was published in Nature, September 10, 1885. 

The April issue of the Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society 
contains an account of a recent exploring expedition into the King 
country of the North Island, New Zealand. This country, containing 
some 10,000 square miles, is the Maori stronghold, and after the war of 
186.3-’64 white men were forbidden to enter, under pain of death. It 
had thus never been surveyed prior to Mr. Kerry-NichoU’s expedition, in 
1883. In the course of 600 miles of travel twenty-five rivers, not pre- 
viously shown upon the maps, and two small lakes were found ; the

source of the four principal rivers of the colony, the Whanganni, Wai- 
kato, Whangaehu, and Manganui-a-te-Ao, were traced; the hydrog- 
raphy of Lake Tanpo in relation to the four distinct watersheds flow- 
ing into it was examined; the volcano of Mount Tongariro (9,300 feet) 
and Mount Euapehu (9,000 feet), the highest peaks of the North Island, 
were ascended. 

A Dutch expedition to New Guinea is being organised. The Govern- 
ment has promised a grant not exceeding 10,000 florins a year, and con- 
sequently the expedition is to be confined to geographical investiga- 
tions. It will probably go to Dorch or to Onin. 

Dr. Otto Finsch reports as some of the results of his work in German 
New Guinea that he traversed the north coast for a distance of 1,000 
English miles, from East Cape to 141o east longitude (Greenwich). Sev- 
eral good harbors were discovered, and continuous meteorological and 
sounding observations made. A large river was discovered, which the 
doctor named after the Empress Augusta ; its course was followed for 
30 English miles into the interior. There is evidence of the existence 
of many other rivers. The German Emperor has ordained that the 
harbor shall henceforth be known as “Friedrich Wilhelm’s Hafen,” and 
the bay near it “Prince Heinrich’s Hafen”; the large navigable river 
east of Cape de la Torre as the “Kaiserin Angusta Fluss”; while Beaupr6, 
situated in the middle of the peninsula, will now be called “ Varzin.” 
“ Neu Mecklenburg ” will be substituted for New Ireland ; “Neu Lauen- 
burg” for the Duke of York group, and “ Neu Pommern” for New Brit- 
ain, the largest island of the Bismarck Archipelago. 

Dr. P. L. Sclater suggests “ Torresia ” as an appropriate name for 
British Jfew Guinea. 

The Geographical Society of Australia has completed arrangements 
for the exploration of New Guinea, and a fully-equipped expedition 
has started under the leadership of Oapt. Henry Charles Everill. The 
rumored massacre of the entire party is discredited by the British resi- 
dent on Thursday Island. 

Mr. Hi O. Forbes is now engaged in the same field. He has accepted 
a contribution of £500 from the above-named society, with the condi- 
tion that he gives it a full report of his journey, and second sets of col- 
lections.. After various mishaps the expedition arrived safely at Port 
Moresby (see Proceedings Eoyal Geographical Society December), in 
company with. Sir 'Peter Scratchley, early in September, and made 
immediate arrangements to start for the interior in company with the 
Eev. Mr. Chalmers. Mr. Forbes is going to attempt to reach the summit 
of Mount Owen Stanley, 13,205 feet high, and hitherto untrodden by 
the foot of man. 

The Geographical Society of Hamburg has published a memorandum 
showing the territorial extent of the recent German annexations in the 
Pacific Ocean. Eeduced to English measurements, the German esti- 
mates are as follows: Kaiser Wilhemsland (German New Guinea),

34,508 square miles ; Keu Mecklenburg (New Ireland), 3,398-8 square 
miles ; Neu Pommern (New Britain), 9,348-8 square miles ; the Bismarck 
Archipelago, 15,261-6 square miles ; in all about 65,512 English geo- 
graphical square miles. The same authority estimates the area of New 
Guinea taken under British protection as 65,517-76 square miles, or 
about the same as the total of German annexations in the Pacific, and 
in each case the area acquired is rather more than twice that of Ire- 
land. 

ARCTIC REGIONS. 

In a communication to the New Tork Tribune last February, Lieu- 
tenant Greely advocates the route by Franz Josef Land to the Pole, and 
gives his reasons for so doing at some length, confirming the opinion 
previously expressed by Chief Engineer Melville. Captain Sorensen — 
who speaks from large experience and after close observation of the ice 
drift in that vicinity, suggests that Spitzbergen and Franz Josef Land 
form parts of a vast archipelago, and not two wholly distinct territories, 
as has hitherto been believed. 

When the “Corwin” returned from Bering Sea to San Francisco in 
June for some repairs, she reported the ice unusually far south in April 
and May in that sea. The same state of affairs existed in the Atlan- 
tic. The captains of several Norwegian steamers dispatched to Green- 
land for seal-hunting, report that in consequence of the enormous ice 
masses on the east and south coasts no seals had been killed by any 
vessel. The state of the ice this summer seems to have been just the 
reverse of that of last year, when the coast was unusually free from 
ice. If the recently promulgated theory that this is an evidence of mild 
weather in the polar regions is at all correct, it is unfortunate that no 
expedition is in the field to take advantage of it. 

Four Arctic expeditions are said to be projected for next year: two 
organized in Portugal, one in Holland, and one in Denmark. They all 
propose to visit the islands of the glacial ocean which belong to Eussia; 
but the Danish expedition will specially explore the Kara Sea and the 
northern coast of Siberia, to define if possible the unknown region 
which is supposed to lie to the northeast of Novaya Zemlya. 

In the latter half of 1883, Dr. F. Boase visited the Gei’man polar sta- 
tion in Cumberland Sound, and made several excursions in the neigh- 
boring region and along the coast. The results ai^ briefiy told by h im 
in a paper in numbers 5 and 6 of the Verhandlungen of the Berlin Geo- 
graphical Society for this year (accompanied by map), in which many 
important corrections are made in the existing admiralty charts of these 
coasts. 

At the meeting of the Naval Institute, which was held in Annapolis 
October 9, Lieut. J. W. Danenhower, of the “Jeannette” expedition, pre- 
sented an essay on the advisability of further Arctic explorations, and 
expressed himself as opposed to further work north of the 85th paral-

lei. The paper was supplemented by others received from Chief Engi- 
neer Melville, U. S. If., Sir George If ares, and Lieutenant Greely, and ver- 
bally discussed by Dr. Emil Bessels, of the “ Polaris ” expedition, and Mr. 
Clements E. Markham, of the Eoyal Geographical Society, who presided 
at the meeting. Letters in favor of further Arctic exploration were read 
from Prof. J. E. Ifourse, U. S. N., and Dr. H. Eink, formerly governor of 
the Danish colonies in Greenland. The general tenor of the discus- 
sion, both oral and written, was that scientific exploration of the Arctic 
regions will go on. 

Mr. C. E. Markham, in his article “Polar Eegions,” of the current 
edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, permits himself to make the 
following remarkable misstatement: “Lieutenant Lockwood made a 
journey along the north coast of Greenland, and reached a small island 
in 33° 2P [north latitude] and 44° 5' [west of Greenwich]. Dr. Pavy 
and another went a short distance beyond the winter quarters of the 
“Alert,” and a trip was made into the interior of Grinnell Land. But 
all this region had been explored and exhaustively examined by the English 
expedition in 1875-’76.” The italics are ours. 

Dr. Leonard Stejneger’s illustrated article on the Commander Islands 
in Heft 3, Band Yiil, of the Deutsche geographisehe Blatter is of special 
value, in that it settles definitely the doubt that has existed as to the death 
of Bering. The writer visited and described the ruins of the hut on 
Bering Island in which Bering and his companions wintered 141 years 
previously, and where the celebrated traveller himself died and was 
buried. The relics found by Dr. Stejneger are of great, if melancholy, in 
terest. 

HTDROGrRAPHT. 

The G. S. S. “Alert” has been engaged for some time in surveying the 
coasts of Corea. The returns have not yet been charted by the Depart- 
ment. 

The last report from the IJ. S. S. “Danger’s” work on the west coast of 
Central America embraces 100 miles of coast between San Juan del Sur 
and the Gulf of Dulce ; this connects the former surveys with the Eng- 
lish detail work from Panama northward. 

The new chart of the harbor of Payta is an excellent specimen of the 
standard which Commander John E. Bartlett has established for the 
future work of the Hydrographic Bureau of the Havy Department. The 
reduction of the photographic view of the anchorage will be of the great- 
est service to mariners. The old Spanish charts of Porto Eico and other 
West India islands have been verified, and as fast as possible this veri- 
fication will be extended to all the harbors of the West Indies. A chart 
of the Arctic Ocean, constructed on the ordinary conical projection, en- 
ables one to study those regions with the utmost facility. 

Eeturns have just been received from the summer’s work of the Coast 
Survey steamer “Carlile P. Patterson” in Southern Alaska. An im-

mense extent of territory has been covered and in a most thorough man- 
ner, the ground being comparatively virgin, as the rough work by the 
Eussians scarcely served as reconnaissance. The surveys off the coast of 
Maine and the general routine work during the six months covered by 
this report have not developed anything of special importance. 

The Deutsche Seewarte as issued a chart of the ice in the Atlantic 
Ocean this spring, which penetrated very far south and east, in conse- 
quence of continuous northerly and northwesterly winds. Several ice- 
bergs appear to have been found in the Gulf Stream. It seems from 
experience that toward the end of June the ice recedes northward, while 
between the banks and the east coast of Newfoundland it remains long- 
est, even after it has disappeared south and southeast of the banks. 

Among the most important additions .to our hydrographical knowl- 
edge are the following : Survey of Little Bahama Bank and southern 
shore of Newfoundland ; main Strait of Magellan ; additions to ports 
and coasts of Southeast Africa ; in the Eed Sea the intricate approaches 
to Suakim have been well laid down ; Penang harbor has been resur- 
veyed and the positions of the islands lying to the northwest, and form- 
ing the eastern boundary of the ordinary route of vessels to Malacca 
Strait, have been accurately determined; the unknown western shores 
of Corea, south of the approach to Soul, for two degrees of latitude, 
have been explored, and the main features of that island-studded shore 
laid down, new rivers and harbors have been enteredj notably the large 
river Gun san-gang, at the entrance to which stands the considerable 
town of Makfo; the southern approach to Haitan Strait on the Chinese 
coast has been recharted ; in the Solomon Islands the Bougainville 
Strait has been charted ; many additions have been made to the charts 
of various groups of Pacific Islands ; the survey of the coast of India by 
officers of the British navy and India marine, has been actively pro- 
gressing, surveys of Eangoon, Cheduba, and other ports in the Bay of 
Bengal, as well as harbors on the west coast of Hindustan have been 
made ; a resurvey of the great Canadian lakes has been commenced in 
Georgian Bay. 

The Italian corvette “Vettor Pisani” commanded by G. Columbo, re- 
cently completed a three years’ circumnavigation of the globe, with suit- 
able outfit and instructions for scientific hydrography. The regions 
visited included both coasts of South America, from Pernambuco on the 
east, south to Magellan Straits, and north to Pandima, the Galapagos 
and Hawaiian Islands, the China, Indian, and Eed Seas, and so home. 
The results of the voyage are very satisfactory, many deep-sea sound- 
ings having been taken, numerous charts corrected or resurveyed, and 
general hydrographic information gathered. 

One of the most interesting features of the Aberdeen meeting of the 
British Association was the lecture given by Mr. John Murray, director 
of the “Challenger” publications, on the results of deep-sea research, 
especially as considered from the hydrographer’s standjioint.

SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1885. 


The Proceedings of the Eoyal Geographical Society for September 
contain the following: “We received in the course of the past mouth 
two communications relating to the picking up of bottles with inclosed 
memoranda cast overboard by enteriirising ship captains’ with a view 
to testing the direction of what may be called the secondary currents 
of the Atlantic. One of the communications is from the German con- 
sul at Payal in the Azores, and is to the effect that one day, about the 
beginning of July last, a bottle was picked up ‘ near the coast of the 
island of Pico,’ north latitude 38° 26', west longitude 28° 35', the contained 
papers stating that it had been thrown overboard from the Hamburg 
steamship “Bohemia” on August 23, 1884, in north latitude 42° 4', west 
longitude 52° 12'. The inference to be drawn from this case is that the 
southerly current thrown off' by. the Gulf Stream in this part of the At- 
lantic is one of extreme slowness. The other con;munication is from 
Herr H. Wolff, of Grand Popo, West Africa. Writing on the 30th day 
of May last, he informs us that a negro in his employ found on the beach 
near Grand Popo a bottle, the inclosed papers of which state it was 
thrown overboard from the ship “Patriarch” (from Newcastle, N. S. W., 
bound for London) on the 11th December, 1884, in north latitude 2° 46', 
west longitude 22° 3'. This point is near the southern edge of the 
Guinea current, which thus apj)ears to have taken five months to carry 
the bottle some 1,200 geographical miles from west to east.” 


PHYSICS. 


By George F. Barker, M. D., 

Profesior of Physics in the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. 


GENERAL. 

The lectures on Molecular Dynamics, given by Prof. Sir William 
Thomson at the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, in October, 1884, 
mark an epoch in the higher physical instruction ot this country. They 
were devoted to a discussion of the wave theory of light, considering 
(1) the propagation of a disturbance through an elastic medium, (2) the 
character of molecular vibration, and (3) the influence of molecules on 
the propagation of waves. The lectures dealt largely with the diffi- 
culties of the wave theory, the first enumerated being the difficulty 
of explaining the dependence of velocity of propagation on period of 
vibration, the second the properties of the aether, the third certain 
phenomena of reflection and refraction, and the fourth those of double 
refraction. As to the first difficulty, he devoted a very considerable 
space to Helmholtz’s theory, which ascribes dispersion to a compound 
structure of material molecules according to which they have a natural 
period of vibration, suggesting an ingeniohs mechanical (Helmholtz- 
Thomson) spring and shell molecule to represent it. As to the aether, 
he has no difficulty in reconciling its almost perfect rigidity with almost 
perfect mobility, since the question is merely one of time. The aether 
may be highly elastic for vibrations executed in the 100 or 1,600 million 
millionth of a second, but highly mobile to bodies going through it at 
the rate of 20 miles a second. As to the manner in which the molecule 
imparts its motion to the ether, he says: ‘‘The kind of thing that the 
luminous vibrator consists in seems to me to be a sudden initiation of 
a set of vibrations and a sequence of vibrations from that initiation 
which will naturally become of smaller and smaller amplitude. Why 
a sudden start? Because I believe that the light of the natural flame 
or of the arc light, or of any other known source of light, must be the 
result of sudden shocks from a number of vibrators. Take the light 
obtained by striking two quartz pebbles together. You have all seen 
that. There is one of the very simplest sources of light. What sort 
of a thing can the light be that proceeds from striking two quartz peb-

SCIENTIFIC RECCED FOR 1885. 


bles together ? Under what eireumstances can we conceive a group of 
waves of light to begin gradually and to end gradually? You know 
what takes place in the excitation of a fiddle string or of a tuning fork 
by a bow. The vibrations gradually get up from zero to a maximum, 
and then, when you take the bow off, gradually subside. I cannot see 
anything like that in the source of light. On the contrary, it seems to 
me to be all shocks — a sudden beginning and gradual subsidence.” But 
it is the double refraction difficulty which is most serious. When the 
medium is displaced during wave propagation In a doubly refracting 
crystal, the return force must depend on the direction of vibration, and 
not on the plane of distortion, as theory indicates. Eankine’s suggestion 
of a cavity in the luminiferous ether having a massless, rigid lining, and 
containing a massive, heavy molecule with fluid round it, seemed to solve 
the difficulty. But the form of wave surface deduced from such a hy- 
pothesis does not agree with Fresnel’s, as Eayleigh has shown. “It ap- 
pears, then,” says Professor Forbes, in his excellent rdsum^of the lectures, 
“that after all the labor which has been expended upon the wave theory 
of light it fails absolutely, and as it seems hopelessly, in two points of 
primary importance. One is the extinction of the ray polarized by re- 
flection; the other is double refraction. In other matters we have 
difficulties, but we can see a possible means of escape. Here there 
seems to be none.” {Nature, March, April, 1885, xxxi, 461, 508, 601.) 

At the Aberdeen meeting of the British Association, Stoney showed 
that the mass of a molecule of hydrogen must be a quantity of the same 
order as a decigram divided by 10^^, i. e., a twenty-fourth decigrammet, 
which is the same as a twenty-fifth grammet. Hence the mass of the 
chemical atom of hydrogen may be taken to be half of the twenty-fifth 
of the grammet. This value is based on the conclusion reached by 
several physicists that the number of molecules in a cubic millimeter of 
a gas at ordinary temperature and pressure is somewhere about a unit 
eighteen (10^*); from which it can be shown that the number of mole- 
cules per liter must be about a unit twenty -four (10^^). From this, to- 
gether with the weight of a liter of hydrogen, the above value for the 
mass of a molecule of hydrogen has been deduced. {Nature, November, 
1885, XXXIII, 21.) 

In a paper on the identity of energy. Lodge has drawn some interest- 
ing conclusions from an important memoir by Poynting, presented to 
the Eoyal Society. In this memoir the author introduces “ the idea of 
continuity in the existence of energy ; so that whenever energy is trans- 
ferred from one place to another at a distance it is not to be regarded 
as destroyed at one place and recreated at another, but is to be re- 
garded as transferred, just as so much matter would have to be trans- 
ferred ; and accordingly we may seek for it in the intervening space 
and may study the paths by which it travels.” Lodge regards this new 
form of the doctrine of conservation of energy as much simpler and 
more satisfactory than the old one; and he proves it rigidly and in- 


PUYS1C8.

stantaneously from Newton’s law of motion (usually stated as three), on 
the one hand, and a denial of action at a distance on the other, thus : “If 
A does work on B it exerts force on it through a certain distance ; but 
(Newton’s lew) B exerts an e^ual opposite force and (being in contact) 
through exactly the same distance ; hence B does an equal opposite 
amount of work or gains the energy which A loses. The stress between 
A and B is the means of transferring energy from A to B, directly mo- 
tion takes place in the sense AB. And the energy cannot jwmp from 
A to B ; it is transferred across their point of contact, and by hypothesis, 
their ‘ contact ’ is absolute; there is no intervening gap, microscopic, 
molecular, or otherwise. The energy may be watched at every instant. 
Its existence is continuous ; it possesses identity.” Obviously A and B 
cannot be “ pieces of matter” in the ordinary sense, since then they 
cannot be in contact. If A and M be contiguous material molecules, 
energy may be transferred from A to M, but not directly ; A cannot act 
on M, cannot do work on it, because of the intervening gap. A can 
transfer its energy to B, B to 0, C to D, and so on, handing on the en- 
ergy to L, which is in contact with, and can act on, M, doing work on it 
and giving up to it the energy lost by A. A, B, 0, &c., are supposed 
to be successive portions of the perfectly continuous space-filling me- 
dium — aether. The distinction between potential and kinetic energy is 
then discussed, and the conclusion stated : (1) Energy cannot be trans- 
ferred without being transformed ; nor conversely can it be transformed 
without being transferred; and (2) it always transforms itself from 
kinetic to potential or vice versa. “When A does work on B, energy 
is transferred from A to B ; if the energy lost by A is kinetic, that 
gained by B is potential ; if, on the other hand, A loses potential then 
B gains kinetic energy.” Hence “ the common mode of treating a fall- 
ing weight, saying that its energy gradually transforms itself from 
potential to kinetic, but remains in the stone all the time, is, strictly 
speaking, nonsense. The fact is the stone never had any potential en- 
ergy; no rigid body can have any; the gravitation medium had it, how- 
ever, and kept on transferring it to the stone all the time it was descend- 
ing.” Change of form is therefore necessary and universal whenever 
energy is transferred, i. e., whenever any kind of activity is exhibited 
by any known kind of material existence. {Phil. Mag., June, 1885, V, 
XIX, 482.) 

Groshaus has announced a new law connecting the boiling points and 
densities of substances with their atomic composition, which law he calls 
“The law of Density-numbers.” These density numbers form a new 
class of constants, and are attributes of the elements ; they are whole 
numbers, and each element possesses only one, though two or more 
elements may possess the same number. They increase with the atomic 
weights, but are not proportional to them. From the values thus far 
obtained, the author suggests the hypothesis that carbon, oxygen, and 
hydrogen are simple bodies, the other eleinents being compounds of 


580 


SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1885. 


other simple substances, the number of atoms of which is shown by the 
density number of each element. He enunciates the law in the follow- 
ing simple form : “ The densities of substances are proportional to the 
density numbers.” Of course it is necessary that the substances com- 
pared should be under similar conditions ; and then the ratio of the 
sum of the density numbers to the density is constant. Thus for a 
series of hydrated crystalline salts of the formula EGI 2 (n 20)6 this 
ratio varies from 19-85 to 20-00. Various other applications of the law 
are given. {Phil. Mag., July, August, 1885, V, xx, 15, 191.) 

Lodge, in his lecture on Dust, at the Montreal meeting of the British 
Association, defined it to be all foreign matter, of whatever kind, sus- 
pended in the air. Its function in causing the blue color of the sky and 
the diffusion of sunlight was discussed. If the atmosphere were purely 
gaseous, holding no minute foreign bodies in suspension, the sun would 
glare down directly with blinding intensity, and objects not in its direct 
rays would be in almost complete shadow. The sun would be set in a 
black firmament, and it would be easy to see the stars at noonday. 
But so far from this, the sun’s rays, on reaching our atmosphere, are par- 
tially intercepted, diffused, and scattered by myriads of most minute 
particles, so minute to be even smaller than the light waves them- 
selves, which act therefore more powerfully on the smallest of these 
waves than on the largest. The light thus scattered has a preponder- 
ance of small waves, owing to the minute size of the scattering parti- 
cles, and hence it affects our sight organ with the sensation of blue. 
The function of dust in causing vapor condensation was then considered, 
and the theory of Aitken illustrated by experiment. Five methods of 
removing dust from the air were mentioned : (1) Filtration through cot- 
ton wool, either alone or mixed with glycerin ; (2) settling, especially 
in hydrogen ; (3) condensing vapor in the air several times ; (4) calcin- 
ing the air, or keeping a hot body in it for some time; and (5) discharg- 
ing electricity into it from a point. He points out that the action of a Lot 
body in keeping the dust away from itself is due to molecular bombard- 
ment ; Tait, Dewar, and Reynolds having shown that a Crookes b?)m- 
bardment is effective at ordinary pressures, provided the bodies bom 
barded are small. Dust particles, being very small, are driven by 
molecular impact away from hot bodies toward cold ones. Hence we 
observe that articles in a room warmed by radiation, and therefore 
warmer than the air of the room, are not likely to become as dusty as 
those in a room warmed by hot air, where the air is warmer than the 
articles. The rapid deposition of dust by electrification w-as shown by 
discharging the current of a Voss machine from a point into an atmos- 
phere containing magnesium smoke. Thus, possibly, the air is cleared 
by thunder storms, and thus fog might possibly be dissipated at sea.

Genocchi has published a historical note on the pendulum experiment 
for (determining the (*arth’s rotation. Poleni, iu 1G69, in noticing a me-

fxSl 

moir of Huygens, says that, in consequence of the earth’s rotation, a 
pendulum could not remain in the same plane during two consecutive 
oscillations. He Sivry, in 178‘J, in his translation of Pliny, observes 
that the pendulum might be used in place of a compass, “ the vessel in 
turning about not altering by this motion the direction of vibration 
once given to the pendulum.” In 1837 Poisson, "while admitting the 
deflecting influence of the earth’s rotation upon a projectile, denied the 
possibility of any deviation whatever for the pendulum ; and in order 
to sustain his opinion, he attempted to prove mathematically that the 
component perpendicular to the oscillatory plane was too small to cause 
any sensible deviation of the pendulum from its plane, or to have any 
appreciable influence on its motion. This opinion was refuted by Biuet 
and Plana in 1851. Poncelet, in 1860, showed that the phenomenon 
was much more complicated than had been generally supposed ; and 
finally, W. Dumas and Serret gave the complete theory of the experi- 
ment. (J. Fhys., March, 1885, II, iv, 147.) 

In constructing the reversible pendulum of Bohnenberger, Weber has 
proposed to place the knife edges in such a way that any given varia- 
tion of their distance may have the least possible influence upon the 
duration of oscillation. With a cylindrical rod he finds that this con- 
dition is realized when t= / 3'02045 a and when the knife edges are

placed symmetrically at a distance from the center x — 0'37835 a; a rep- 
resenting the moment of inertia of the pendulum around its center of 
gravity. The value of a may be calculated geometrically and the length 
of the simijle synchronous pendulum I in the formula Z=3-02045 a be 
deduced from a determination of the time t, without having any meas- 
urements of length to make other than those of the geometric dimen- 
sions of the rod. ( Wied. Ann., xxii, 439; J. Fhys., November, 1885, II, 
IV, 510.) 

Oppolzer has obtained, by means of a Eepsold reversion pendulum, 
th^ provisional value 0-993825 meter for the length of a seconds pendu- 
lum in Vienna, lat. 48° 13' 57", altitude 236 meters. {Ber. Ah. Wien., 
1884, p. 2; J. Fhys., April, 1885, II, iv, 184). 

Sakai and Yamaguchi have determined the gravitation constant in 
c. Gr. s. units at Kagoshima and at Naha, in the Loo Choo Islands, using 
the method employed by Mendenhall in Tokio. The value at Kagoshi- 
ma was 979-561 ± 0-0057, and at Naha 979-165 0-0055. {Am. J. Sci., 

May, 1885, III, xxix, 404.) 

Bartoli has speculated on the mean density of a body containing all 
the known elements in a solid state, either uncomt)ined, or, if partly 
combined, each retaining the density belonging to it in the solid state. 
He makes three suppositions : (1) The masses of all the substances 
equal ; (2) the masses such that the corresponding volumes shall be 
equal, and (3) the masses in the ratio of the atomic weights. In this 
way he arrives at the mean densities 2-698, 7-027, and 5-776, this last

value, as he points out, comiug very near that got by Cavendish for the 
mean density of the earth, which was 5-67. {Nature^ October, 1885, 
xxxn, 635.) 

Wilsiog has revived the use of the pendulum for determining the 
earth’s mean density, and has shown that the necessary sensitiveness 
may be secured by adjusting so that the center of gravity comes close 
under the axis of oscillation. In his experimental apparatus fixed leaden 
balls, each weighing 300 grams, were placed at the ends of a prismatic 
rod of thin sheet iron, the steel knife edge being in the middle of the 
rod and resting on agate planes. After adjustment to equilibrium, the 
attracting masses were brought near the leaden spheres and the deflection 
read by means of a mirror and scale. From the value thus obtained the 
ratio of the deflecting attraction to the constant of gravitation can be 
deduced. By reversing the direction of the deflecting force the total 
deviation is doubled. An improved apparatus, in i>rocess of construc- 
tion, will, it is expected, give accurate results. {Ber. ATc. Berl., January, 
1885 ; Bhil. Mag.^ March, 1885, V, xix, 219 ; Am. J. Sci., May, 1885, III, 
XXIX, 402.) 

Konig and Bicharz have suggested an improvement of Yon Jolly’s 
method for determining the earth’s mean density. A cubical block of 
lead, about 2 meters in the edge and weighing 100,000 kilograms, is so 
placed that the center of its upper horizontal surface is exactly beneath 
the middle knife edges of an extremely delicate balance. Beneath the 
center of each scale-pan the block is bored vertically through, and two 
other scale-pans are suspended below the block by means of rods pass- 
ing through these openings. A weight in one of the upper pans is bal- 
anced by weights in the opposite lower pan. The former is acted on by 
the earth’s attraction plus that of the block, the latter by the difference 
of the two. Hence, the weights in the lower pan are greater than those 
in the upper by twice the attraction of the block. A second weighing 
is then made, the other two pans- being now used. The difference of 
the two weighings gives four times the attraction of the block. {Ber. 
ATc. Berl.., December, 1884; Phil. Mag.., February, 1885, Y, xix, 148; 
Nature., January, March, 1885, xxxi, 260, 408, 484.) 

MECHANICS. 

1. Of Solids. 

In a paper read at the Aberdeen meeting of the British Association, 
Osborne Eeynolds discussed a new and very fundamental property of 
granular masses Qomposed of rigid particles in contact, which property 
he calls Dilatancy. It is exhibited in any arrangement of particles where 
change of bulk is dependent upon change of shape. In fluids change 
of shape and volume are independent, but in solids they are sometimes 
not separable. With granular masses change of shape always produces 
change of volume, and if change of volume is prevented any change of

form is impossible. Thus a sack of corn is flexible ou end, but becomes 
hard when placed on its side, and its shape will not alter. But if the 
sack be made of rubber, since the boundary of the granular mass is 
now extensible, it remains perfectly flexible in all positions. However, 
if it be possible with an extensible' envelope to impose a maximum vol- 
ume upon the contents, effects similar to those obtained with the inex- 
tensible boundary may be expected. This can be done, for example, 
by placing No. 6 shot in a rubber bag and adding a certain amount 
of water. If the quantity of water be such that the spaces between 
the granules when in close arrangement are all .filled by it, while 
with a wide arrangement the amount is not enough, a point will be 
reached in passing from the first to the second arrangement such that 
any further change of shape and consequently of volume would produce 
a vacuum. When this stage is reached the whole mass becomes perfectly 
hard. When the foot presses upon wet sand, that portion of it imme- 
diately surrounding the foot becomes momentarily dry. The sand being 
completely filled with water, the pressure of the foot causes dilatation, 
and so more w’ater is required. This is drawn in from the surrounding 
sand leaving it dry until a sufficient supply has been drawn up from 
below. On raising the foot the sand contracts again and the excess of 
water escapes again wetting the sand under and around the foot. The 
author conceived that the property of dilatancy placed a hitherto un- 
known mechanical contrivance at the command of those who would ex- 
plain the fundamental arrangement of the universe ; and he proceeded 
to explain how bodies in such a medium would, in virtue of the dilation 
caused in the medium, attract each other at a distance with a force de- 
pending on the distance which might well correspond with gravitation. 
Further, owing to the existence of a region close to the body in which 
the density varies several times from maximum to minimum, the mutual 
force might undergo a change from attraction to repulsion, and this 
more than once, as the bodies approach a condition which seems to 
account for cohesion and observed molecular force far better than any 
previous hypothesis. {Phil. Mag., December, 1885, V, xx, 469 ; Nature, 
October, 1885, xxxii, 535.) 

Von Helmholtz has suggested an improved method of measuring the 
modulus of elasticity of solids. Ordinarily the bar is firmly supported at 
its ends and the flexure produced by loading it in the middle is measured 
with the cathetometer. Under these circumstances, however, a consid- 
erable error is introdnced by the compression at the points of support. 
To eliminate this Von Helmholtz uses two perpendicular mirrors at the 
ends of the bar, their reflecting surfaces being directed inwards. A 
scale is placed opposite one end of the bar and a reading telescope op- 
jxisite the other. The image of the scale is seen in the one mirror as 
reflected in the opposite one. As the bar is loaded and becomes flexed 
the image is displaced to an amount proportional to the angular changes 
of the mirrors. The amount of flexure for different loads is a simple

matter of observation therefore, and is independent of the effect of the 
pressure on the supporting edges. Kbnig proposes the use of the anal- 
ogous method of Kirchhofif for determining Poisson’s constants ; only, 
instead of using two horizontal mirrors and two telescopes, two parallel 
mirrors inclined at an angle of 45® should be used at the two ends of 
the bar, with one telescope. In this way the moduli of elasticity and 
of torsion may be measured and the constants in question calculated. 
{Nature, August, 1885, xxxii, 360.) 

Frederick Siemens has improved greatly the processes for tempering 
glass, and consequeptly the product obtained. The scientific principle 
underlying these consists simply in keeping the whole body of the glass 
at a uniform temperature during the operations of heating and cooling. 
The De la Bastie process is wrong in principle, since it leaves the glass 
in a state of tension; while the glass treated by the new process is al- 
most entirely free from internal stress. Three distinct processes are 
made use of; in the first, called press-hardening, the very best quality 
of glass is used. It is cut into the proposed shapes, softened in the 
furnace, and cooled between metal plates, the degree of hardening de- 
pending upon the temperature to which the glass is heated and the 
rate at which it is cooled. It may be cooled so rapidly that a diamond 
will not,scratch it, a result obtained in the case of sheet and plate glass 
for the most part, either plain or decorated ; increasing its strength 
eightfold. For sheets of ordinary thickness, the heating occupies a 
minute and the cooling half a minute, and this without injury to the 
glass. The second process, called semi-hardening, is applied to articles 
not adapted to the press. These are heated up to the verge of softening 
and then placed in an iron casing having projecting ribs to give the 
necessary support, the whole being cooled in the open air. The strength 
of the glass is increased about three times. The glass made in the third 
process is called hard-cast glass, and is used for grindstones, sleepers, 
car-rails, and floor plates. It is made in a continuous melting furnace 
and run into molds made of imperfectly conducting materials, such as 
mixtures of porcelain, glass pots, heavy spar, magnetic iron, &c., pul- 
verized and then molded as in casting iron. After the glass is run into 
the mold the whole is heated up and rapidly cooled. To show its homo- 
geneity a tuning fork was made of it which gave a clear musical note. 
{Nature, March, 1885, xxxi, 413.) 

Sherman has called attention to the relation obtained by Weber be- 
tween the residual elasticity of glass and its chemical composition, the 
former value being deduced from the observed depression of the column 
after heating. Plotting the results obtained, the ordinates represent- 
ing depression in tenths of a degree and the abscissas the ratio of pot- 
ash to soda, Sherman notes the fact that while the greater portion of 
the observations may be represented by a smooth curve, yet several of 
the points lie farther from the curve than can be accounted for by errors 
of observation ; the composition of the glass being identically the same

for some of these points and for some lying in the curve. Except in 
one case, the departures are less than the maximum differences afforded 
by the depressions observed on a single thermometer. In this case, the 
only one where the depression is diminished, the lime, soda, and potash 
exist in the glass in nearly equal amounts. {Am. J. 8ci., May, 1885, 
III, XXIX, 385.) 

Bartoli has sought to show the non-permeability of glass to gases by 
means of a polarization test. A glass trough divided vertically in the 
middle was filled with a solution of sodium sulphate. On opposite 
sides of this partition were fastened thin gold electrodes, a second elec- 
trode, also, of gold, being in each cell. The two electrodes of one of these 
cells were connected with a delicate galvanometer, those of the other 
with a strong battery. But no effect was produced upon the galvanom- 
eter. Since any trace of either oxygen or hydrogen by passing through 
the glass would have polarized one of the galvanometer electrodes and 
produced a current, the author concludes that the glass is not permea- 
ble to gases. {11 Nuovo Cimmto, III, xvi, 78 ; J. Phys., December, 1885, 
II, IV, 556.) 

Trowbridge and McEae have determined by several methods the co- 
efficient of elasticity of ice. Bars prepared by freezing water in metallic 
tubes were vibrated transversely and made to record their vibrations 
simultaneously with those of a tuning fork of known pitch. The values 
of E in two experiments were 66 x 10® and 55 x 10® absolute units. 
Bars of ice were cut from a pond, supported at the ends, weighted, and 
the deflection measured by a cathetometer. The values in the four 
series of observations were 57 x 10®, 65 x 10®, 71 x 10®, 96 x 10®, 
the mean being 72 x 10®. By the method of ' lopgitudinal vibrations, 
the pitch of the note being 0.3 of a semi tone of 0 sharp, the modulus 
for a bar of ice 138 centimeters long was found to be 86 x 10® absolute 
units. The calculated velocity of sound in ice is therefore 2,900 meters 
per second, or about nine times the velocity in air. {Am. J. 8ci., May, 
1885, III, XXIX, 349.) 

Trotter has communicated to the Eoyal Society the results of some 
experiments made at the, Grindelwald glacier to ascertain whether di- 
rect evidence of shearing could be obtained in ice under the action of 
forces produced by the action of gravity. Bars of ice were passed 
through holes in three parallel blocks of wood nearly in contact, the 
two outer ones being hung to a frame, while a weight was hung to the 
middle one. In a final experiment a shear of about 0.075®“ was observed 
after the action during seventeen days of a shearing force of rather more 
than 200 grams per square centimeter. He therefore thinks that “ there 
is little doubt that, under conditions closely resembling those in the in- 
terior of a glacier, and under the influences of forces comparable with 
those which gravity is capable of exerting in a glacier, hand specimens 
of ice shear in the same manner as a truly viscous solid would do.”

Morgan has made a series of experiments on the viscosity of ice, which, 
taken in connection with results obtained by other experimenters, are 
of great interest. In the first a cylinder of ice 3 inches in diameter 
was supported on a board, and over it a wire was hung loaded with a 
total weight of 5 pounds. The whole was placed in the snow chamber of 
a refrigerating apparatus for six and a half hours at a temperature never 
above— 12°. No dent was observable on the surface of the cylinder. 
The second experiment was similar, the weight being increased to 10 
pounds and the time to eight hours, but the result was the same. In 
the third, the weight was 14 pounds and the time seventeen and a half 
hours, but no indentation was observable. In the fourth experiment a 
bar of ice 2J inches wide and 1 J thick was supported on bearers 13 J 
inches apart, from Monday noon to Saturday noon without perceptible 
flexure. In the fifth the bar was weighted in the middle for the same 
time with 7 pounds, but with the same result. In the sixth, 18 pounds 
weight acting for the same time gave no perceptible deflection. In the 
seventh a similar though thinner bar, varying from -625 to ’875 of an 
inch in thickness, was weighted for four days with 7 pounds and for 
two days with 7 pounds additional. No bending could be detected by 
measurement. The author cites experiments at other temperatures, and 
concludes that the viscosity of ice is considerable at temperatures at 
and above the melting point, is much less below but near this point, 
is very slight between —3.5° and —12°, and is nil below —12°. [Nature, 
May, 1885, xxxii, 16.) 

Fromme has observed that the purely mechanical interpretation of 
the change of properties which steel undergoes by hardening, in which 
the pressure which the external layer suddenly cooled exerts on the 
internal portions, plays a prominent part, leads to consequences con- 
cerning the density of a tempered mass of steel which are not always 
in accord with experiment. It must be admitted that this mechanical 
action produces so close an approximation of the molecules that a con- 
secutive chemical . action results, i. e., the combination of the iron and 
the carbon. In this way it is not difficult to see that slow cooling, 
efi^ected under a considerable pressure, can produce the physical effects 
of hardening, as the experiments of Olemandot and Lan have shown.

In conjunction with Vicentini, Pagliani has determined the coefficient 
of compressibility of water at various temperatures. At 0° it is 
0-0000503] at 10°, 0-0000470; at 20°, 0-0000445; at 30°, 0-0000425; at 
40°, 0-0000409; at 50°, 0-0000397; at 60°, 0-0000389; at 70°, 0-0000390; 
at 80°, 0-0000396 ; at 90°, 0-0000402 ; and at 100°, 0-0000410. The same 
author, working with Palazzo, finds the compressibility of ethyl alcohol 
to be represented by the empirical formula nt=!^o (Id ^003177t-l-

0-0000550^). With respect to mixtures, the authors fiud (1) that the 
addition of small quantities of alcohol lowers the compressibility-coefli- 
cient of water; (2) that this diminution continues to increase until the 
alcohol constitutes 23 per cent.; (3) that for mixtures containing less 
than 19 per cent, of alcohol, the coefficient diminishes as the tempera- 
ture rises from zero upward, there being for each mixture a tempera- 
ture where it is a minimum ;^and (4) that the temperature of minimum 
compressibility is always Ipwer for these mixtures than for water. 
There appears to be no relation between the temperature of maximum 
density and minimum compressibility of these mixtures. {J. Phys., 
August, 1885, II, IV, 371.) 

Terquem has translated from Vitruvius an account of the process by 
which Archimedes determined the composition of the crown of Hiero, 
which differs from that ordinarily received. After the discovery in the 
bath, he caused to be made two masses equal in weight to that of the 
crown, the one of gold the other of silver. Then having filled com- 
pletely with water a vessel of known capacity he plunged into it the 
mass of silver. A quantity of water equal to the volume of the silver 
overfiowed. Eemoving the metal, he poured water into the vessel until 
it was again full, measuring the quantity of water thus used. In this 
manner he ascertained the volume of water corresponding to a known 
weight of silver. This experiment was then repeated with the mass of 
gold, the volume of which was found proportionally less. On immers- 
ing the crown in the same vessel, he observed that a greater volume of 
water overflowed than was displaced by the mass of gold of the same 
weight; and from the quantity which overflowed in the former case over 
that in the latter he calculated the amount of silver which the crown 
contained. Hence it would appear that Archimedes did not make use 
of the upward pressure of liquids in this experiment, as is generally as- 
sumed, but employed a process analogous in principle if not identical 
with that of the specific gravity bottle. (<7. Phys., August, 1885, II, iv, 
384.) 

Schiff' has devised a simple form of apparatus for determining the 
specific density of liquids at high temperatures based on the principle 
of the weight thermometer. The bottle used, which has a capacity of 
8 or 10'- has a recurved neck over which is a helmet ground air tight. 
It is filled with the liquid and weighed, then submitted to the required 
temperature and the excess of liquid allowed to overflow into the helmet. 
A second weighing after cooling gives the weight of the liquid remain- 
ing and hence of the overflow, from which the density of the liquid at 
the given temperature is calculated. {Ber. Berl. Chem. Ges., June, 1885, 
XVIII, 1538 ; Am. J. BcL, November, 1885, III, xxx, 380.) 

The phenomena of capillarity have received very considerable atten- 
tion. Worthington has reviewed the method proposed by Quincke for 
determining surface tensions from the dimensions of flat drops and bub- 
bles, and has shown that the higher results given by this method over 


588 


SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 188o. 


those given by capillary tubes are due in the main to .two erroneous as- 
sumptions, which may cause an error of even 10 per cent. He gives a 
table of the corrected values for ten liquids. {Phil. Mag., July, 1885, 
V, XX, 51.) In a paper on the theory of pendent drops the same author 
shows that the value of the surface tension of a liquid may be deduced 
from the measurement of the value of the inclination of the tangent of 
the curved surface of a pendent drop to the axis, measured at a single 
level, that level being so chosen that the tangent is there vertical. 
{Phil. Mag., January, 1885, V, xix, 46 5 J. Phys., October, 1885, II, iv, 
466.) 

Worthington has devised a capillary multiplier, which consists simply 
of a rectangular strip of platinum foil of known length rolled into a 
cylindrical coil, the successive convolutions being kept separate at a dis- 
tance of about 2““ by means of a strip of glass beads in the upper por- 
tion of the coil. The lower edges of the convolutions are in the same 
plane, and, as when in use, the coil hangs from one end of a balance 
beam, this plane is horizontal. By immersing the lower edge in any 
liquid and measuring by weights in the opposite scale-pan the pull on 
the coil the surface tension may be calculated. {Phil. Mag., January, 
1885, V, XIX, 43; J. Phys., October, 1885, II, iv, 467.) 

Bother has measured the capillary constant of several saline solutions, 
and also of various mixtures of these solutions. ( Wied. Ann., xxi, 576; 
J. Phys., November, 1885, II, iv, 520.) The paper of Eeinold and Eiieker 
on the influence of an electric current in modifying the rate of thinning 
of a liquid film has appeared in full. {Phil. Mag., February, 1885, V, 
XIX, 94.) Eiieker has delivered a lecture on liquid films before the 
Eoyal Institution, giving a rdsumd of the investigations on this subject 
made by himself in conjunction with Eeinold. {Nature, July, 1885, 
xxxn, 210.) 

Warburg and Sachs have studied the influence of increasing density 
on the viscosity of liquids, and have calculated the coetficient of friction 
from the compressibility. This coefficient increases for carbon dioxide, 
ether, and benzene, and diminishes for water. This latter fact was es- 
tablished by Eontgen in 1881. ( Wied. Ann., xxii, 510, 518 ; J. Phys., 
November, 1885, II, iv, 619.) 

Newall has investigated the phenomena of colliding water-jets and 
has obtained some curious results. If two horizontal jets of water, 
issuing from similar glass nozzles and fed from two glass bottles, be 
made to collide at a small angle the jets, if tolerably clean and dust- 
free water be used, rebound from one another, but may be made to 
unite by connecting the terminals of a battery with the water in the 
two bottles. The surface of separation between the colliding jets is ver- 
tical and shows the colors of thin plates with remarkable brilliancy, due 
undoubtedly to a thin film of air, as Eayleigh has shown the two to be 
electrically insulated from one another. The author investigated the 
effect of a gradual increase of electromotive force ujion these colors,

and found that they remained constant until coalescence was produced, 
and then disappeared suddenly ; thus eliminating conclusively the hy- 
pothesis that the action of electricity in promoting union may be ascribed 
to the additional pressure called into play by electrical attraction of the 
opposed water surfaces acting as plates of a condenser. {Phil. Mag., 
July, 1885, V, XX, 31.) 

3. Of Gases. 

An interesting discussion on the kinetic theory of gases took place in 
the mathematical and physical section of the British Association at the 
Aberdeen meeting in September. The discussion was opened by Crum 
Brown, who stated the difficulties of the theory under two heads : First 
the difficulties connected with the doctrine that energy communicated 
from without to a gas is equally shared among the whole of the degrees 
of freedom of the molecules ; and, second, the difficulties connected with 
the doctrine that energy of each kind is distributed among the mole- 
cules according to some form of the law of probability. Under the first 
head he called attention to the fact that the ratio of the specific heat of 
mercury vapor at constant pressure to that at constant volume is 5 : 3, 
which gives on the dynamical theory but three degrees of freedom to the 
molecules, and these must be the three translational freedoms. If to 
prevent rotation the molecules be regarded as perfectly smooth, rigid, 
and spherical, the radiation producing the spectrum cannot be accounted 
for. In diatomic gases the ratio is 7 : 5, giving three trauslatory and 
two rotational freedoms. But here again the vibration of the atoms 
is not accounted for, either as parts of the molecule or individually. 
Boltzmann’s theorem asserts that the energy of a molecule is equally 
distributed among the difierent degrees of freedom. Hence, if in addi- 
tion to the six degrees of freedom of a rigid body in space the mole- 
cules have twenty or thirty others, it would seem that the dynamical 
theory must be abandoned, as there would not be sufficient energy for 
translational motion. The second class of difficulties arises when it is 
supposed that the energy is distributed among the molecules according 
to some form of the law of probability. For then in a mixture of gases 
there would always be some molecules in a condition favorable for com- 
bination. Moreover, there should be no such sharp temperature and 
pressure limits for combination, such as exist between phosphorus and 
oxygen, for example. And further, oxygen and hydrogen may be kept 
for a long time at a temperature near that of combination without any 
union taking place. Liveing maintained that thedifficulties encountered 
arose from the assumptions of Boltzmann’s theorem, which is not a neces- 
sary part of the kinetic theory. It is quite possible that mercury vapor 
has no sensible vibrational energy at the temperatures at which its spe- 
cific heat has been measured. The more perfect gases have at ordinary 
temperatures much less vibrational than translational energy ; so that 
they may have only one or at most two modes of vibration, Sir William

Thomson had never seen any reason at all for believing in Boltzmann’s 
theorem. J. J. Thomson said that he thought the reason that the value 
of the specific heats of a gas, as found by experiment, did not agree 
with the value given by Boltzmann’s theorem was because Boltzmann’s 
theorem was not true. Hicks stated that to him one of the greatest 
objections to this theorem was the difficulty in believing that the mean 
energy of any vibration whatever of an atom was susceptible of unlim- 
ited increase. Osborne Eeynolds remarked that the kinetic theory is 
supposed to be true only in so far as the assumptions on which it is 
based represent the actual conditions. In any gas the mean energies of 
translation in which there is most rapid communication and no appre- 
ciable resistance will be much greater than the mean energies of vibra- 
tion to which there is all the resistance consequent on the radiation and 
in all probability but little communication. [Nature, August, October, 
1885, XXXII, 352, 533.) 

De Eomilly has modified the form of vacuum jet which he suggested 
in 1881, and to which he gave the name of pneole. In its original form a 
jet of water or of mercury was thrown upward from a circular orifice into 
a second and similar one placed above it, carrying the surrounding air 
with it. Since the interior parts of the solid column contributed nothing 
to the effect, the periphery alone being useful, the author has placed 
a solid cylinder within the jet so as to make the opening annular. The 
liquid is thrown up by centrifugal action. A mercury apparatus of this 
description, turned by hand, made a barometric vacuum in a globe of 
600®’ ®‘ capacity in about six minutes. [J. Phys., August, 1885, II, iv, 
366.) 

Wilde has made a series of experiments on the velocity with which 
air rushes into a vacuum. Theory assumes that air rushes into a vac- 
uum with the velocity which a heavy body would acquire bj" falling 
from the top of a homogeneous atmosphere, i. e., a velocity of 1,332 
feet a second. The apparatus consisted of two strong cast-iron cylin- 
ders, the smaller having a capacity of 573 cubic inches and the larger 
of 8,459 cubic inches. To the smaller a compression pump and pressure 
gauge were attached, to the larger an exhausting pump and a vacuum 
gauge. The air was discharged from the smaller cylinder into the 
large one through a disk of tinned iron 0-75 inch in diameter, and 0-01 
inch thick, pierced in the center with a circular hole 0-02 inch in diam- 
eter. The vacuum was 0 6 inch mercury, and the pressure varied from 
10 to 135 pounds per square inch. The maximum velocity observed 
was 1,225 feet per second, and this only at the commencement, the 
values in general being considerably less than theory indicates, though 
at forty atmospheres the theoretical velocity would be reached. Experi- 
ments made on the discharge of the compressed air into the atmosphere 
showed that the times of each discharge from 120 pounds to 15 pounds 
effective pressure are identical with the times of discharge from 135 
pounds to 30 pounds absolute pressure into a vacuum. Hence the au-

thor formulates the general proposition that the atmosphere acts as a 
vacuum, and offers no resistance to the discharge of air of all pressures 
above two absolute atmospheres. {Phil. Mag., December, 1885, V, xx, 
531.) 

Hoffmann has determined the law of the flow of air through a capil- 
lary tube too short for it to obey Poiseuille’s law. He concludes (1) 
that the principal cause of the failure of this law under these circum- 
stances is to be sought for in the perturbations produced at the two 
orifices, particularly at the entering one ; and (2) that if the times of 
flow of any mass of air whatever be taken as ordinates, and the lengths 
of the tubes (of constant diameter) through which the air flows as ab- 
scissas, very flat curves are obtained which ascend rapidly and are in- 
termediate between a straight line and a hyperbola. ( Wied. Ann., xxi, 
470 ; J. Phys., November, 1885, II, iv, 512.) 

Hausemann has experimented to determine the law of the diffusion 
of gases through a porous partition, the gases used being oxygen and 
hydrogen. The diffusiometer was constructed so as to allow the diffu- 
sion to take place under considerably higher pressures, for a single gas, 
than had been hitherto used. From the data obtained the calculation 
of the diffusion -coefficient for the two gases was made without diffi- 
culty. Experiment furnished perfectly concordant numbers, but the 
calculation of the coefficient of reciprocal diffusion by means of these 
coefficients did not succeed. Values were found for this coefficient of 
interdiffusion which decreased with the time and the upper limit of 
which is considerably smaller than the coefficient measured directly by 
Loschmidt. Hence Stefan’s theory is not confirmed ; it implies the 
hypothesis that diffusion is effected in the vacuities of porous bodies 
according to the same law as in open space. But it is evident that the 
porous partition exerts a special action which has not been taken into 
consideration by Stefan. {Wied. Ann., xxi, 545; J. Phys., November, 
1885, II, IV, 518.) 

Amagat has repeated his experiments on the compressibility of air 
and of nitrogen with reference to the use of these gases in manometers, 
extending the range of pressure, which in the earlier series was never 
loss than 20 to 30 atmospheres, down to that of 1 atmosphere. These 
experiments were made in one the towers of the church at Fouvibres, 
where a clear height of 63 meters was available. The method was es- 
sentially the same as that used in the Yerpilleux shaft, though with 
some improvements. The results agreed perfectly with previous deter- 
minations, the values for nitrogen not varying in general by one 
thousandth of the total pressure. But the discrepancies with Cailletet’s 
figures still exist, amounting between 40 and 60 meters to more than 2 
meters of mercury. A table is given of the product pv for nitrogen and 
air at the temperature of 16° and at pressures varying from 0-76 to 65 
meters of mercury. Within these limits either of these gases may be 
used for filling manometers. Between 85 and 430 atmospheres nitrogen

is preferable; while above 430 atmospheres hydrogen is preferable, 
the curve of pv being a straight line for this gas. {C. B., xcix, 1017 ; 
Phil. Mag., February, 1885, V, xix, 150.) 

Bottomley has communicated to the Eoyal Society a preliminary note 
on the condensation of gases at the surface of glass. A quantity of 
non-tubular spun glass was placed in a glass tube which was then ex- 
hausted with a Sprengel pump till the exhaustion, as shown by the Mac- 
Leod gauge, was three ten-millionths of an atmosphere. At the end of 
an hour the vacuum remained sensibly the same, the temperature of the 
room being about 14°. While the mercury was flowing through for the 
third time the tube containing the glass was heated with a Bnnsen 
flame. The hammering produced by the falling mercury at once ceased 
and the MacLeod gauge showed a considerable increase of pressure. The 
action of the pump was continued, and the temperature raised as high 
as the tube would bear in order to remove all the adhering gas. The 
collecting tube was then removed and the gas contained in it analyzed. 
The quantity was only 045®- ®- and it consisted of carbon dioxide 8-24 
per cent., oxygen 22'76 per cent., and nitrogen 69 per cent. The fibers 
of the spun glass were measured and found to be fairly uniform and 7-06 
hundredths of a millimeter in average diameter. By comparative 
weighing the number of fibers in the tube was found to be 6,370. Their 
average length was 10*25®™. Hence their total surface was 1,448®^* ®™. 
In a second experiment 15,500 glass fibers were used, having a total 
surface of 3,527®^* ®“. The gas given off measured 0*41® ®- of which 78*6 
per cent, was carbon dioxide, the remainder being oxygen (10*5 per 
cent.) and nitrogen (89*5 per cent.). This large amount of carbon di- 
oxide is difficult to account for unless it was taken up by the glass at 
the time it was spun. {Nature, March, 1885, xxxi, 423.) 

Kayser, in a note to the Physical Society of Berlin, calls attention to 
Bunsen’s paper explaining the discrepancies between his own results 
and those of Kayser regarding the absorption of carbon dioxide by glass 
surfaces. Bunsen has now shown that the glass threads, even after dry 
air had been passed over them for a long time, still retained a layer of 
water which was thinner the higher the temperature, but was not entirely 
dissipated until the temperature reached 500°. Hence the absorption 
observed by Bunsen, and which appeared to continue indefinitely, would 
seem to have been an absorption by this layer of water, whereas in 
Kayser’s experiments, in which the glass threads had been freed from all 
adhering matters by boiling oil, the carbon dioxide had been absorbed 
by the smooth glass itself. {Nature, May, 1885, xxxil, 72.) 

ACOUSTICS. 

Neyreneuf has determined the velocity of sound in steam by a method 
based upon certain observations of Weber and Savart. A longitudi- 
nally vibrating reed is attached to the end of a cylindrical draw-tube 
18™™ in diameter through which the air passes to throw it into vibra- 


I’JiV.SlCS. 


bn 

tion. The reed speaks or is silent for certain definite variations in the 
length of the draw-tube; the sum of the two consecutive intervals cor- 
responding to sound and silence being equal to the wave length of the 
sound given by the reed. Any change in the velocity of the air current 
modifies both the intervals, but their sum remains absolutely the same. 
With a draw-tube which may be extended through 3 meters, a series of 
closely concordant measurements of the lengthening and shortening 
may be rapidly made, whose mean value is closely approximate. Since 
Biot has shown that the proper sound of a reed is independent of the 
nature of the gas acting upon it, it suffices simply to sound this reed 
with different gases in order to compare directly the velocities of sound 
in them, which are proportional to their wave lengths. The relative 
values obtained were, for air 27-5 to 32 ; carbon dioxide, 22*5 to 25; illumi- 
nating gas, 42, and hydrogen 113. The mean of nine closely concordant 
experiments gave 40-48 for the wave length in steam at 100°, the ftalcu- 
lated value being 41-089. (J. Phys., December, 1885, II, iv, 550.) 

Mercadier has continued his studies on the laws of vibration of circu- 
lar plates. He concludes (1) that it is not possible in practice to con- 
struct disks of iron or steel of a thickness less than one millimeter which 
shall give sounds calculated in advance from their dimensions ; and 
(2) that the mathematical theory of circular vibrating plates is not af- 
fected by this, since the differences between the calculated and the exper- 
imental results are explained by circumstances difficult to introduce 
into formulas. In all cases the more the thickness increases the closer 
is the accord between theory and experiment. Hence, in verifying the 
theory anew, it will be necessary to experiment on disks of small radius 
and of sufficient thickness. (J. Phys., December, 1885, II, iv, 541.) 

Semmola has observed that if the conductors of an influence machine 
are connected by means of two wires 5 meters long with two binding 
screws on opposite sides of a brass plate 1 millimeter in thickness, 
resting on an ebonite funnel, and the path of the current is broken so 
that sparks strike across, the jdate begins to sound. A Geissler tube 
or a lead wire may be interposed in the break without destroying the 
effect, or a wire containing the break may be led to earth from one of 
the binding screws. The sound is louder if the upper end of this wire 
is held at a short distance from the connecting post, so that sparks pass. 
The wires from the machine may even be connected with a second metal 
plate parallel to and at a distance from the other one, the sound being 
strengthened by connecting this plate to earth, and slightly by interpos- 
ing a glass jdate. If the wires be connected with the insulated wire of a 
sonometer, instead of the brass plate, no sound is heard unless an ebon- 
ite ear-trumpet is placed on the resonant box. {Beiblatter Phys., ix, 
671 ; Phil. Mag., December, 1885, V, xx, 548.) 

Le Conte Stevens has suggested an improvement in the method of pro- 
jecting acoustic curves optically. He uses the well-known method of 
Lissajous, but instead of throwing the beam reflected from the mirror

of tlie second fork directly on the screen, he receives it on an oscillating 
or revolving mirror, which sends it to the screen. If either fork vibrate 
alone, the curve is the simple sinusoid corresponding to its rate; while 
if both are put in vibration the compound curve characteristic of the 
interval is obtained. If the ratios are exact, the form of the curve de- 
pends on the difference of phase and is constant. If they are not exact, 
interference takes place and the beats are seen to have their optical ex- 
pression. {Am. J. Sci., March, 1885, III, xxix, 234.) 

Felici has suggested the following arrangement for showing Lissajous 
figures by means of vibrating strings. A piano wire, something more 
than a meter long, is strung horizontally in such a way that the tension 
can be varied at will. Upon it is fixed vertically by means of a little 
cement a card in which a narrow horizontal slit has been cut. Behind 
this wire a second similar wire is placed verticallj^ exactly opposite the 
center of the slit in the card. The tension of both cords is so regulated 
that their vibration ratios are simple. On vibrating them both simul- 
taneously in parallel vertical planes, so that the two vibrations are per- 
pendicular to one another, and on throwing a beam of light through the 
point of intersection, the image on a screen formed by means of a lens 
shows the characteristic Lissajous curve in black within a bright rect- 
angle. {11 Nuovo Oimento, xvi, ICO; J. Phys., December, 1885,11, iv, 
557.) 

In order to facilitate the determination of the number of beats given 
by a vibrating body with a fork of known pitch, Israileff has constructed 
a pendulum the vibrations of which can be regulated to coincide with 
the beats observed. For this purpose he displaces a weight micromet- 
rically aloug the rod of the pendulum, prolonged for this purpose above 
the axis of suspension. An empirical graduation permits direct read- 
ing of the number of vibrations to be added to or subtracted from the 
number of the vibrations made by* the fork in order to obtain those 
of the sounding body. In Eussia the bells in church towers are fixed 
and are struck by their tongues acting as hammers. To produce an 
agreeable effect, the bells must be so tuned that they yield exactly 
the harmonics of the same fundamental tone. It is for this purpose 
that the above device was constructed. Isralieff has himself made the 
tuning forks for comparison. The set begins at 440 vibrations and con- 
tinues to 880, increasing regularly by 8 vibrations, tuned with great 
care. To lower the tone the central portions of the bell are turned pff 
on a lathe, and to raise the tone, the peripheral portions, until the 
proper tone is reached. {J. 8oc. Phys.-CJiim. Pusse, xvi, 1; J. Phys.., 
December 1885, II, iv, 588.) 

In 1879 Mayer devised a method of measuring with great accuracy 
the vibration periods of tuning forks, the details of which have only now 
been published. It consists, first, in making the tuning fork, to which 
an exceedingly fine light style is attached, describe its own vibrations 
on a revolving cylinder covered with smoked paper ; and, second, in de-

termining the exact number of vibrations made per second by means of 
a spark produced between the tuning-fork style and the metal cylinder 
whenever contact is established in ah electrical circuit by means of a sec- 
onds pendulum: This pendulum is provided with a triangular platinum 
point, which as it vibrates cuts a small and rigid mercury globule on an 
adjustable iron cup. The pendulum and mercury globule are in the 
primary circuit of an inductorium, the fork and cylinder in the second- 
ary circuit. It is essential that the discharge should not be multiple, 
but should consist of only a single spark, a result secured by varying the 
strength of the current in the primary circuit and the size of the con- 
denser in the secondary. The author used this method not only to deter- 
mine the absolute pitch of tuning forks, but also to determine the abso- 
lute constancy of the pitch with decfeasing amplitude, and, in conjunc- 
tion with the method of beats, to study the effect of temperature on 
pitch. He concludes that a Koenig fork gains or loses of 

a vibratory period by a change of temperature of 1° F. The effect of 
the scrape of the style on the vibration of the fork was also measured 
and found to be —-026 vibration. The results of his determinations of 
the pitch of five European forks of various standards are given in the 
memoir, and also some results of the use of the above method as a chro- 
noscope. {Mem. Nat. Acad. Sci., 1885, iii, 45.) 

Ellis has given an account of the method of Mayer, and has compared 
the results obtained by it with those of other methods, especially those 
of Scheibler, of MacLeod, and of Koenig. The five forks sent to Mayer 
had been measured by himself with Scheibler’s tonometer, and also by 
MacLeod. The results agreed within 0.1 vibration. Although Mayer 
gives his results to three decimal places, Ellis thinks that the number 
of varying circumstances is so great that “ at most two places of deci- 
mals (perhaps only one) out of the three of Mayer’s means can be trusted.” 
Hence he doubts whether Mayer’s proces%gs superior to Scheibler’s, al- 
though he concedes that it is fully equal to it. As a chronoscope, he 
regards it as extremely valuable, since if the time of vibration be deter- 
mined to of a vibration, and the fork makes 400 vibrations per sec- 
ond, the measurement would be correct to -j-owo P^^t of a second. As 
to the effect of temperature, MacLeod finds the coefficient to be yoig o? 
Koenig igyi-a, and himself ystso 5 while Mayer, as above stated, ob- 
tained the value • {Nature, November, 1885, xxxiii, 54.) 

Soret has advocated the A of 432 vibrations as the standard of mu- 
sical pitch. Objection seems to be raised to this suggestion, long ago 
made in Belgium and rejected by a commission, who adopted in March, 
1885, the French A of 435 vibrations. The arguments in favor of 432 
are almost entirely arithmetical. But even if practicable to make a 
fork exact in the arithmetical series at the start, the charm of the arith- 
metic vanishes with a slight change in temperature. Up to 1813 all 
Europe had used a pitch within a comma either way of Handel’s fork 
A 422-5. Then the Russian Emperor gave a set of new instruments to

a Vienna regiment and the pitch began to rise. In 1826 the London 
Philharmonic Society adopted A 433. In 1859 France adopted A 435. 
The English concert pitch is now based on A 454"7, the army pitch being 
based on A 452. {J. Phys., hTovember, 1885, II, iv, 506 ; Nature, May, 
1885, XXXII, 9.) 

Ellis has presented a paper to the Society of Arts on the musical 
scales of various nations, chiefly those of ancient Greece, Arabia, India, 
Java, China, apd Japan, giving the results of his endeavors to discover 
the system by which they tuned. He concludes that there is not any- 
thing among them approaching to a single “natural” musical scale. 
On the contrary, the systems, where systems can be said to exist, are 
very diverse and often very capricious, and are always very imperfectly 
carried out. This arises, probably, from harmony proper being un- 
known, though ensemble playing is common. In the latter case unisons 
are the rule, the eifect being produced by diversity of quality of tone ; 
but certain eflects are produced by admitting octaves, and rarely fourths 
and fifths, but no more. Also a kind of polyphony may be remarked, 
some instruments, especially those with tones of very short duration, 
being allowed to discant while the others go on with the air. The in- 
vestigation must go on for years, however, before the matter can be 
fully decided. {Nature, March, 1885, xxxi, 488.) 

Neesen has reported to the Physical Society of Berlin the results he 
had obtained in his experiments on sounding air columns, with the ob- 
ject of determining the relation of Kundt’s dust figures to the tone-pitch. 
By means of an electric tuning fork, whose tone-pitch could be variously 
modified by varying weights, the air was maintained in permanent vi- 
bration in a glass tube closed at the bottom by a membrane. Many 
measurements of the intervals separating the sand ribs were made, but 
no relation between these values and the tone-pitch could be established. 
He found, moreover, that the long-known wandering of the ribs in a 
permanently sounding tube stood in no demonstrable relation to the 
vibrations of the air, being in the same tube directed in one way in one 
place and another way at another place. The cause of the wandering 
of the ribs could not be ascertained. As to their origin, observations 
had been made at those spots in the tube where the wanderings of the 
ribs issued in contrary directions, and where, consequently, there was 
comparative rest. A very interesting phenomenon was observed on 
taking the measurements of pressure in the sounding tube. A narrow 
glass tube, open on both sides, with an oil index, the movements of 
which were observed, acted as a manometer. No displacement of the 
index was ever noticed, but out of the interior end of the manometrical 
tube there appeared to issue a current of air impelling the cork sand a 
long way. The strength of the apparent air current might be measured 
by little mills, and when small radiometers with paper wings were in- 
troduced into the sounding tube they fell into very lively rotation. If, 
instead of full paper wings, the radiometers had small conical paper

tubes, directed all alike, they rotated .lust as fast in just the same man- 
ner as the others. When, however, one approached a node, the rota- 
tion became slower, ceased, assumed the contrary direction in order 
after further progress, to pause again, and next pass into the former 
lively rotation. {Nature^ November, 1885, xxxili, 95.) 

Elsass has suggested an improved form of monochord in which the 
vibrations of the string are produced by means of a siren. A small 
disk is fixed somewhat eccentrically upon the axis of an ordinary siren, 
and to the uprights carrying the wheelwork is attached, by means of 
two screws, a support for a little bent lever, the conically-pointed axis 
of which rests in two steel screws passing through the support. This 
lever is capable of motion in a vertical plane, and presses with its 
shorter and vertical arm against the eccentric disk while the longer and 
horizontal arm carries the end of a stretched thread at right angles to 
the axis of the lever. When the siren is at rest the tension of the thread 
retains the lever in position, and when it is sounding, and the eccentric 
disk gives it a slight periodic motion, this tension brings it back. At 
its other extremity the thread passes over a friction pulley, adjustable 
in height, and is stretched suitably by weights placed in an attached 
scale pan. When properly regulated and the siren put in motion, the 
vibrations of the thread may easily be followed by the eye ; but as the 
velocity increases, the friction of the disk against the lever produces a 
noise; this suddenly ceases and the thread is seen to be in stationary 
vibration of the fundamental form. The amplitude is considerable, 
being often of three fingers’ breadth for threads of a meter in length. 
Moreover, the thread acts as a regulator for the siren, and it is easy to 
maintain its iiitch constant. Since the thread may be made to assume 
different forms of vibration with a constant tension by varying the 
speed of the siren, it differs from Melde’s apparatus, where the rate of 
vibration is constant and the tension varies. The author shows how it 
may be used to illustrate Mersenne’s laws. {Phil. Mag., January, 1885, 
V, XIX, 48.) 

HEAT. 

1. Production of Heat. — Thermometry. 

Mallard and Le Chatelier have given a resume of their later re- 
searches undertaken under the auspices of the Fire-damp Commission, 
in order to determine, for a number a gaseous mixtures, the tempera- 
ture of inflammation, the speed of propagation of this inflammation, and 
the temperature given by the combustion in close vessels. They find 
that inflammation of gaseous mixtures may be propagated in two dis- 
tinct ways: either with a slow and uniform speed corresponding to the 
deflagration of explosive solids, or with a speed extremely great cor- 
responding to the explosion of the same bodies. The only difference 
which exists between solid and gaseous explosives is that in the former 


598 


SCIKNTIFIC RECORD FOR 1885. 


the manner in which the inflammation is produced regulates generally 
the mode of combustion, flame producing deflagration and shock de- 
termining explosion; while for gaseous bodies deflagration changes 
spontaneously into explosion, at least for certain mixtures where the 
propagation is very rapid. There is, moreover, for gases a mode of 
vibratory propagation very variable and very irregular, which is, in a 
certain sense, intermediate between deflagration and explosion. These 
phenomena the authors explain by supposing that the slow deflagration 
corresponds to the propagation of the temiierature of inflammation by 
conduction ; while on the other hand the explosive wave is produced at 
the instant when the pressure produced by the ignited layer upon the 
following one is sufficient to raise this latter to the point of inflamma- 
tion. From this moment the inflammation is itself propagated with the 
speed of transmission of this pressure, i. e., with the speed of sound, 
accelerated, of course, by the high temjierature produced. The prog- 
ress of the slow wave was studied by means of photography. A glass 
tube containing the gaseous mixture — generally a highly photogenic 
mixture of carbon disulphide and oxygen, or nitrogen dioxide — was 
placed near a revolving cylinder and parallel to its axis. As the flame 
progressed along the tube it developed a curve on the sensitive paper 
with which the cylinder was covered, the abscissas of which gave the 
place of the flame and the ordinates the time required for it to reach 
this point. The displacement of the flame along the tube is perfectly 
uniform and constant for the same mixture, being for one volume car- 
bon disulphide vapor and three of nitrogen dioxide 1*25 meters per 
second. The temperatures of combustion are given in tabular form. 
[J. Phys.. February, 1885, 11, iv, 59.) 

In their researches on the speed of the explosive wave in gases, Ber- 
thelot and Vieille have shown that this wave is propagated with a speed 
approximately equal to the mean speed of translation of the molecules 
of the gaseous products of combustion, upon the hypothesis that all 
the heat involved in the reaction is found for the first instant in the 
compounds formed. Thus, for electrolytic gas, the mean of several de- 
terminations gave a speed of 2,810 meters per second, the mean speed 
of molecular translation for the vapor formed being 2,831 meters. But 
this law did not appear to hold for mixtures of carbon monoxide with 
oxygen or with nitrogen monoxide. Dixon has now pointed out the 
fact that water- vapor is necessary to the combustion of carbon mon- 
oxide, and has shown that as the proportion of vapor augments the 
speed of inflammation increases also. From experiments made in a 
lead tube 55 meters long and 13 millimeters in diameter, he found the 
speed of the explosive wave to be 2,817 meters at lOci C., confirming 
the above results. With carbon monoxide and oxygen nearly dry, the 
explosive wave was not established until the flame had traversed a dis- 
tance of 700 millimeters from the firing i^oint. The speed observed was 
rather over 1,500 meters per second. After the explosion a fine layer

enormous temperature reached in the explosion had decomposed the 
carbon monoxide into its constituent elements. {Proc. Brit. Assoc. 1884, 
688; J. Phys., October, 1885, II, ly, 472.) 

Sherman has investigated the fact that when a thermometer is heated 
above a certain point the mercury column is permanently displaced 
with regard to the scale. This point of temperature varies with the 
glass of which the bulb is made and also with the previous use of the 
thermometer. The range, in his experience, is between 110° and 255°, 
the former for German and American soda-lime glass, the latter for Eng- 
lish flint and French crystal. By much use or long heating the dis- 
placement frequently reaches 10° and may amount to 26°. The author 
now finds that if the thermometer be exposed to a high temperature for 
some hours the displacement of the zero point becomes less and less 
with each successive treatment, so that the curve representing the ele- 
vation becomes more nearly parallel with the axis of abscissas, which 
represents the hours of heating. Moreover, the thermometer after treat- 
ment no longer shows this rise in zero point on heating and is found to 
repeat its readings accurately when exposed to similar conditions. 
Hence the author concludes that after such treatment the thermometer 
is as serviceable as a measurer of temperatures ranging from 0° to 300° 
as the aecustomed standard is for the range 0° to 100°. These changes 
are accompanied by a change in the expansion-coefficient of the glass, 
due perhaps to a partial separation of the crystalline from the amor- 
phous constituents of the bulb glass. {Am. J. Sci., July, 1885, III, xxx, 
42.) 

Wroblewski has compared the indications of a hydrogen thermometer 
with those of a thermo-electric junction. The former indicates below 
— 193° temperatures lower than the latter, thus showing a greater con- 
traction at this temperature than the laws of Boyle and Charles require. 
Moreover the departure increases as the temperature diminishes. The 
hydrogen thermometer gives —207° for the temperature of solidification 
of carbon monoxide and — 214° for that of nitrogen , while the thermo- 
electric junction gives — 199° and —203°. The thermo-electric curve is 
remarkably regular, and hence it follows that the thermo electric junc- 
tion is a more reliable indicator of temperature than the air thermometer 
at these low points. When oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon monoxide 
are evaporated in a vacuum the temperature falls only a few degrees 
below— 200°. {C. B., April, 1885, c, 979; Am. J. Sci., June, 1885, III, 
XXIX, 495.) 

Mendenhall has described a difi'erential-resistance thermometer for 
the ready determination of temj)erature at a distant point. It consists 
essentially of a thermometer of large size the stem of which has an 
internal diameter of about a millimeter, and the bulb of which is so 
large that a difference of 1° gives a disidacement of d™"* in the column. 
Running down through the stem is a platinum wire, about'08““indiam- 


600

eter, terminating in tbe bulb, which has a somewhat heavier wire sealed 
into it. The resistance between the upper and lower ends of the ther- 
mometer will depend largely on the length of the exposed platinum wire, 
and this upon the temperature ; so that as the temperature rises the re- 
sistance in circuit is diminished by an amount equal to the difference be- 
tween that of the platinum wire which disappears and that of the ipercury 
which takes its place less the increase in the resistance of the wire and 
mercury due to increase of temperature. From the equation represent- 
ing this change in resistance as a function of the temperature a curve 
is constructed from which the temperature corresponding to any given 
resistance may easily be read. The resistance is measured on a Wheat- 
stone’s bridge, the telephone being conveniently substituted for the 
galvanometer for ordinary work. {Am. J. 8ci., August, 1885, III, xxx, 
114.) 

Angstrom’s geothermometer consists of an ordinary instrument whose 
bulb is placed in an iron vessel containing mercury sunk to the required 
depth. The stem is open above and in it hangs a metallic wire moved 
at the surface of the ground by means of a rack and pinion. So soon 
as the wire touches the mercury an electric circuit is closed, and this, 
by means of an electro-magnet, arrests the pinion. The stem carries a 
graduated scale previously calibrated, so that a simple inspection gives 
the temperature at once. No correction for temperature is necessary, 
since the parts are compensated. {J. Phys., January, 1885, II, iv, 46.) 

Whipple has communicated to the London Physical Society a de- 
scription of the process followed at Kew for testing thermometers at or 
near the melting point of mercury. About 20 pounds of mercury are 
poured into a wooden bowl and frozen by carbon dioxide-snow and 
ether. The mercury is stirred with a wooden stirrer and the snow is 
added till the experimenter feels, by the resistance to stirring, that the 
mercury is freezing. By continuing the stirring for some time the 
mercury becoms a granular instead of a solid mass. The thermometers 
are then inserted together with a standard and comijared. About one 
hundred mercury or forty spirit thermometers can be thus examined in 
half an hour, using about 200 gallons of carbon dioxide gas compressed 
to form the snow. The bowl, ether, and mercury are cooled first to 
—10° by an ordinary freezing mixture. The average correction at the 
melting point of mercury is now less than 1° F. When the process 
was introduced, in 1872, it amounted to 5°, but has steadily decreased.

2. Expansion and Change of State. 

Madan, doubting the statement generally made that stretched india- 
rubber forms an exception to the general law of expansion by heat, has 
called attention to Russner’s investigations on this subject made in 1882. 
He finds (1) that india-rubber always has a definite and positive coefiB

(iOl 

cient of expansion, the value of which at 10® was found to be O-000657 
and at 30® 0’000670 ; (2) that india-rubber in a stretched state expands 
to the same extent as when not stretched, no point of minimum den- 
sity existing ; (3) that the apparently anomalous behavior of stretched 
rubber is a case entirely analogous to that of anisotropic crystals 
which expand differently in different directions ; Iceland spar, as Mit- 
scherlich showed, contracting by heat in a direction perpendicular to 
the principal axis, though its volume as a whole increases. Moreover, 
when stretched, ordinary rubber becomes anisotropic and gives color 
between two crossed Nicol prisms, the direction of the strain lying at 
45° with the plane of polarization. {Nature, October, 1885, xxxii, 625.) 

In a subsequent note, Tomlinson agrees with Schmulewitsch that 
the effect of heating a stretched piece of rubber is to lengthen it if the 
tension is small, and to shorten it if the tension is large so that for a 
certain tension there will be neither elongation nor contraction. More- 
over, Tomlinson concludes from his experiments that the critical tension 
will be lower the higher the temperature. ( Vierteljahrschr. Nat. Ges. 
Zurich, XI, 202 j Nature, November, 1885, xxxiii, 7.) 

Gernez has continued his researches upon the changes in the crystal- 
line form of sulphur produced by heat. He finds that while the octo- 
hedric form may be preserved at all temperatures below its fusing point, 
yet that at 97*6® and above if touched with a fragment of prismatic 
sulphur, it is transformed into the prismatic variety. To this state of 
unstable equilibrium he gives the name crystalline surheating. On the 
other hand, the change of prismatic into octohedral sulphu?- with de- 
creasing temperatures, shows a retardation analogous to that above 
mentioned, to which the author, following Mallard, gives the name crys- 
talline surfusion. The conditions affecting these uncertain states he has 
now investigated, and has concluded : 1st, that the speed of devitrifi- 
catioh is not greater as the temperature is lower, there being always 
an intermediate temperature of maximum rapidity of change; 2d, that 
the crystalline form is not always sufficient of itself to identify the va- 
riety, since considerable differences exist in pieces having the same 
form ; 3d, that the action of heat upon liquid sulphur at a constant tem- 
perature produces a change which increases with time and continues 
even after solidification ; 4th, that liquid sulphur heated from a given 
temperature and then cooled again to the same temperature undergoes 
a modification manifested by change of properties, which continue even 
after solidification ; 5th, that octohedral sulphur, melted, solidified in the 
prismatic form, and then changed to the octohedral form, has not re- 
covered its primitive properties, and does not even after many months 
exposure to the ordinary temperature. {J. Phys., August, 1885, II, iv, 
349.) 

Raoult has continued his investigations on the action of dissolved 
snbstances in lowering the freezing point of solutions. His results show, 
1st, that if in the solution of an alkali salt containing oiJe equivalent of

the salt in 100°-®’ of water, the monad metal be replaced by an equivalent 
quantity of a dyad or polyad metal, the depression of the freezing point 
is diminished by a quantity sensibly constant and equal to 10’5; and, 
2d, with regard to acids, that if in the solution of a salt of a strong 
monobasic acid, containing one equivalent of the acid in 100®-®- of 
water, the monobasic acid be replaced by an equivalent quantity of a 
strong dibasic acid a diminution of the depression of the freezing point 
is observed which is nearly constant and approaches 14. From the 
partial depression values given in the paper, the molecular depression 
produced by any salt may be calculated from its molecular weight.

Bouty has suggested the hypothesis that the molecular latent heats 
of all bodies measured at their normal temperatures of ebullition are 
proportional to the squares of these temperatures. This assumes (1) 
that the normal density of saturated vapors corresponds to half their 
molecular weights ; and (2) that Dalton’s law is rigorously true. To 
test the question he gives a table of values obtained from seventeen or- 
ganic bodies, chiefly alcohols and ethers, in which the quotient of the 
molecular latent heat by the square of the absolute ebullition tempera- 
ture is nearly constant. For water the value is 0-0694 ; for the alcohols, 
0-0730; for aldehyde, 0-0695; for the haloid ethyl ethers, 0-0691; and 
for compound ethers, 0-0735. {J. Phys., January, 1885, II, iv, 26.) 

On theoretical grounds J. Thomson had reached the conclusion that 
the maximum elastic force of a vapor in contact with its liquid is greater 
than the Maximum elastic force of a vapor in contact with the corre- 
sponding solid, contrary to the opinion of Eegnault, who held them to 
be the same. Eamsay and Young have now verified experimentally 
this conclnsion of Thomson’s. Their experiments were made partly in 
barometer tubes, partly in an apparatus specially constructed for the 
purpose. They plotted the curves representing the variation of the 
elastic force with the temperature for camphor, benzene, glacial acetic 
acid, and water, and noticed that the curves where these bodies were 
in the solid state did not coincide with those where they were liquids, 
the deviation being in the direction predicted by Thomson. The au- 
thors regard the result as general, and applicable in all cases. {Proc. 
Boy. Soc., xxxvi, 499 ; J. Phys., February, 1885, II, rv, 91.) 

Miiller-Erzbach has suggested a new method for determining the elastic 
force of the vapor of water in hydrated salts, which consists in determin- 
ing simultaneously the loss of weight which two identical tubes suffer, 
one of which contains water the other the hydrated salt, in an atmos- 
phere dried by means of sulphuric acid. The ratio of loss of weight 
the author regards as rigorously equal to the ratio of the elastic forces 
of the vapor of water in the two tubes. In this way he finds that the 
evaporation from hydrated salts in completely dry air gives constant 
dissociation tensions. From the variations of these tensions, the exist- 
ence of three hydrates of sodium phosphate is inferred, corresponding,

respectively, to two, seven, and twelve molecules of water; of two hy- 
drates of sodium borate, with five and ten molecules of water; of two 
hydrates of sodium carbonate, with one and ‘ten molecules ; while in 
sodium sulphate all the combined water constitutes only a single hy- 
drate. ( Wied. Ann., xxiii, 607 ; J. Phys., November, 1885, II, iv, 521.) 

Klobukow has contrived two new forms of apparatus for measuring 
vapor densities, the one for substances of low the other for substances 
of high boiling point. The latter, which is the more novel, has the form 
of an areometer of constant volume, containing a cavity for the vapor, 
the volume being deduced from the weight required to restore the 
level. The areometer is floated in mercury, the temperature of which 
is raised so as to volatilize the substance used. ( Wied. Ann., xxii, 493 ; 
J. Phys., April, 1885, II, lY, 177, 179.) 

In consequence of the very considerable loss in preparing solid car- 
bon dioxide, Cailletet proposes the use of a hollow cylinder closed at bot- 
tom, and having a cover attached by a bayonet catch, through which 
cover an inclined tube passes to within a few millimeters of the bottom 
of the cylinder. Through the middle of the base a larger tube passes 
which serves for a handle and also for the escape of the gas. It rises 
nearly to the top of the box and is perforated with holes. The whole 
apparatus is made of vulcanite. Experiments show that 65 grams of 
snow are obtainable from 200 grams of the liquid carbon dioxide blown 
in through the inclined tube. {J. Phys., March, 1885, II, lY, 122.) 

Cailletet has succeeded in obtaining by the use of liquid ethylene a 
temperature sufficiently low to liquefy oxygen completely, ^the com- 
plete apparatus, constructed by Ducretet, is so well arranged that the 
production of liquid oxygen is an easy lecture-room experiment. The 
steel cylinder containing the liquid ethylene is supported with its axis 
vertical, its mouth being downward. To this a copper worm or 4““ 
in diameter is attached, closed at the lower end by a screw plug. On 
cooling this worm to— 70° in a bath of methyl chloride, the ethylene 
within it has only a feeble tension and flows out without much loss when 
the screw plug is opened. The liquid ethylene is received in a narrow 
tube of thin glass placed within a larger vessel containing dry air. It 
is necessary now only to accelerate its evaporation by passing through 
it a rapid current of air or hydrogen, also cooled in the methyl chloride 
bath, in order to see the oxygen compressed in a glass tube immersed 
in the ethylene condense into a clear colorless liquid having a sharply- 
defined meniscus. A hydrogen thermometer showed the temperature 
of the ethylene to be— 123°. {(J. R., c, 1033; J. Phys., July, 1885, II, lY, 
293; Nature, October, 1885, xxxil, 584; Am. J. Sci., July, 1885, III,

Olszewski has measured the density and the expansion coefficient of 
liquid oxygen. A small reservoir of glass 1*4 in capacity was filled 
with liquid oxygen, cooled to -139° by the evaporation of liquid ethyl- 
ene and maintained at a pressure of 40 atmospheres. The oxygen was 
then allowed to resume the gaseous state and from the volume of this

latter its weight was calcnlated. The density thus obtained was 0-8787 
at — 139-130. The expansion coeflScient was 0-01706. Moreover the 
author finds that liquefied chlorine congeals at —102° and that hydrogen 
chloride is solid at —115-7° and fuses again at —112-3°. Hydrogen 
arsenide freezes at —118-9° and melts at —113-5°. Silicon fluoride 
is solid at —102°. Ethyl ether freezes at —129°. Methyl alcohol has 
the consistence of oil at —102° and of butter at —115° ; it then passes 
gradually into the solid state, which is reached at —134°. {Ber. Ak. 
Wien, 1884, 72 ; J. Phys., April, 1885, II, iv, 184.) 

Wroblewski has described in detail the apparatus which he uses for 
the liquefaction of gases and has given the results of his comparisons of 
the hydrogen thermometer with the thermo-electric couple. The criti- 
cal temperatures for nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and oxygen he finds to be 
—145°, —141°, and —118°, respectively; and the critical pressures 
33-6, 35, and 50 atmospheres. The boiling points under a pressure of 
740““, are —193°, —190°, and — 181-5° The lowest temperatures which 
he has observed are — 200-4° for oxygen under a pressure of 2®“, —206° 
for nitrogen at 4-2®“, and for carbon monoxide —201-6° at 4®“. Both 
nitrogen and carbon monoxide solidify at these temperatures. {Ber. 

Ak. Wien, March, 1885; J. Phys., July, 1885, II, iv, 316.) 

In hygrometry several papers have appeared. Hazen has studied the 
psychrometer and has compared its indications with those of the con- ! 
densing hygrometer. {Am. J. ScL, December, 1885, III, xxx, 435.) J 

Bourbouze has suggested two new modifications of the hygrometer. ' 
One of these is based on the production of the colored rings seen round 
a source of light when viewed through a glass plate on which vapor j 
begins to condense. A small rectangular tube has holes on opposite 
faces closed by very thin glass plates. A very sensitive thermometer 
is used, dipping only very slightly into the liquid. On causing a cur- 
rent of air over the liquid surface, either by aspiration or otherwise, 
the whole is cooled and dew is deposited on the glass. By placing the 
apparatus between the eye and a luminous point these concentric rings 
are readily observed and the temperature noted. The other instrument I 
is similar but has a metallic envelope, the temperature of which is de- i, 
termined by the thermometer. {J. Phys., September, 1885, II, rv, 425; i 
Phil. Mag., August, 1885, V, xx, 220.) I 

Sire has also suggested two new types of condensing hygrometers, 
in both of which the deposit of dew is observed on a cylindrical or 
plane brilliant surface. The reservoir in the first type is a cylindrical 
tube of thin polished metal, the ends of which are insulated in tlfe in- 
terior by two pieces of ebonite, so that the volatile liquid is in contact 
with the metal only over a middle zone a centimeter broad. In the 
second the reservoir is entirely of ebonite, traversed laterally by a cir- 
cular aperture closed by a thin metal disk, polished on the inside. The 
surfaces are metallic palladium. {Phil. Mag., November, 1885, V, xx, 
468.)

3. Conduction and Radiation. — Specific Meat. 

Stenger has measured the conductibility of tourmaline by the method 
of Weber, employing for this purpose plates whose homogeneity had 
been thoroughly established. He was unable to discover the least 
trace of unilateral conductivity and therefore supposes that the con- 
trary results obtained by Thompson and Lodge arose from the non- 
homogeneity of the tourmaline they used. In consequence the author 
does not consider as established their theory of the pyroelectricity of 
tourmaline, based upon such conductivity. {Wied. Ann., xxil, 522; 
J. PJiys., November, 1885, II, rv, 522.) 

From the electromagnetic theory of light Maxwell deduced the prop- 
osition that a beam of light or heat falling normally on a surface exerts 
upon it a pressure equal to the energy which exists in unit of volume of 
the ether in consequence of its light-motion. Boltzmann, combining 
with this a relation deduced by him from the second law of thermody- 
namics, has obtained the law of Stefan, that the radiation from a heated 
body is proportional to the, fourth power of the absolute temperature. 
(Wied. Ann., xxii, 291; J. Phys., November, 1885, II, iv, 526). 

Schneebeli has called attentiou to a paper by Svanberg, published in 
1851, in which is a description of an apparatus based on the same princi- 
ple as the bolometer of Langley. With this apparatus he has measured 
the coefficient of absorption of glass, and finds for it a value which varies 
inversely as the temperature, being 2-4 at 100°, 1-47 at 250°, and 0-42 at 
1,000°. He has also verified the law of Stefan between 400° and 1,000°, 
and has shown that the ratio of the luminous to the total radiation of a 
Swan lamp increases rapidly with the temperature; but that the ratio 
of this radiation to the square of the current-strength remains constant, 
as Joule’s law requires. ( Wied. Ann., xxii, 430; J. Phys., November, 
1885, II, IV, 527.) 

Bottomley, on the contrary, has obtained experimental results entirely 
disagreeing with Stefan’s law. A current of known strength is passed 
through a platinum wire, the temperature of which is deduced from its 
increase in resistance. When the temperature has become constant, the 
heat generated by the current must be equal to that radiated from the 
surface of the wire plus that lost at the ends of the wire by conduction. 
The wire was placed in a high vacuum, one twenty- millionth of an at- 
mosphere, made in a glass tube in internal diameter. The wire 
itself was 0-4“™ diameter and about half a meter loug, and was sealed 
into the ends of the tube, the exhaustion being effected through a lateral 
tube. The temperature of the room at the time of the experiment was 
15°. In four experiments, the absolute temperature of the wire being 
298, 383, 798, and 823, the ratio of the energy radiated was found to he 
1, 6'1, 71.9, and 90'2; whereas by the law of Stefan the values should 
have been 1, 16, 438*8, and 499*8. (Nature, November, 1885, xxxiii, 
85.)

The emissive power of a surface increases markedly when it is depol- 
ished. This fact Christiansen accounted for on the theory that such a 
surface sent out not only the heat emitted directly but also the heat 
emitted and then reflected. To test this theory he constructed a cube 
one face of which was plane, another corrugated, the corrugations hav- 
ing sharp angles and the sides inclined 90° to each other, a third sim- 
ilarly corrugated but with the inclination 45°, and a fourth containing a 
large number of conical cavities. All these surfaces were equally pol- 
ished and their emissive powers normal to the faces of the cube were 

I, 2'06, 2’66, and 8-7, respectively. The apparent emissive power of the 
conical cavities is approximately the same as that of a surface equal to 
the sum of their bases covered with lampblack. ( Wied. Ann., xxi, 364 ; 

J. Phys., November, 1885, II, iv, 528.) 

Eontgen appears to have settled the disputed question of the absorp- 
tion of heat by the vapor of water by the following neat experiment : 
A thick tube of brass, gilded, is closed at one end by a plate of rock 
salt. If now it be exposed to a source of heat, the heating will depend 
(1) upon the heat transmitted by the walls of the tube and (2) upon the 
heat absorbed by the gas. Place the interior of the tube in commu- 
nication with a Marey’s manometric capsule, the style of which rests on 
the surface of a recording cylinder. Under the above circumstances it 
will record an increase of pressure which will be permanent if the heat- 
ing is due to the first cause and transient if due to the second. The 
secoud effect is observed when the tube contains air saturated at zero 
and then heated to 26°, the increase of pressure due to the heating of 
the gas being 2-18““. A much less increase was observed with air con- 
taining carbon dioxide in the normal proportion of the atmosphere. 
The source of heat in these cases was a Bunsen burner. ( Wied. Ann., 
XXIII, 1, 259 ; J. Phys., April, 1885, II, iv, 181, 529.) 

Clark has devised a radiant energy recorder depending on the evap- 
oration of water in vacuo. The instrument is essentially a Wollaston 
cryophorus in which the vertical tube and lower bulb are replaced by a 
simple glass tube graduated in cubic centimeters. The bulb containing 
the water to be evaporated is blackened by holding it in the smoke of 
burning camphor and is then exposed to the sun, the rest of the aiipa- 
ratus being silvered or properly protected by sheets of bright tin. At 
sunset the water which has distilled over can be read off on the graduated 
tube and expressed in heat-units. {Nature, July, 1885, xxxii, 233.) 

According to Lommel’s theory of fluorescence there should be an ab- 
sorption band in the spectrum of esculin in the vicinity of the line A. 
Wesendonck has examined this part of the spectrum by means of phos- 
phorographs and has been unable to recognize aUy such band in that 
region. ( Wied. Ann., xxiii, 548 ; J. Phys., November, 1885, II, iv, 533.) 

Velten has measured the specific heat of water at ordinary tempera- 
tures, using (1) the method of mixtures and (2) an ice calorimeter. 
The results are quite complex but the formula which appears to the

water has a minimum value at 43.5° and a maximum at 104.5°. {Wied. 
Ann., XXI, 31 ; J. Phys., November,' 1885, II, iv, 521.) 

Berthelot and Vieille, in their studies on the heat relations of the ex- 
plosion of gaseous mixtures, have been able from the data obtained 
to calculate the specific heat of the elementary gases, of water and of 
carbon dioxide at high temperatures. Thus, for the simple gases Ng, 
H 2 , and O 2 , as well as the compound gas CO, which is closely related to 
them, the specific heat at 2,800° is 6-7 ; at 3,200°, 7-9; at 4,000°, 8-4; 
and at 4,400°, 9-3. It will be observed that it increases rapidly with the 
temperature, being doubled, nearly, between 0° and 4,500°. The mean 
specific heat of water between 0° and 2,180° is 15-67, and between 0° and 
3,240°, 18-12. Hence the mean specific heat between 130° and 230° is 
more than doubled at 2,000° and tripled at 4,000°. For carbon dioxide 
the mean value between 0° and 2,900° is 20-5, and for cyanogen, between 
0° and 4,300°, 22-5. The specific heat of the former gas more than 
triples and the elementary specific heat quadruples between 0° and 
4,300°. {Ann. Chim. P//t/s., January, 1886, VI, iv, 66, 74; Am. J. Sei., 
April, 1885, III, xxix, 331.) 

Bai toli has described a simple form of apparatus for lecture demon- 
stration to show the equivalence of heat and work. Two small globes, 
one containing mercury, the other benzene, are connected by a narrow 
tube, from which rises perpendicularly a thermometer tube, graduated. 
On placing the mercury globe vertically above the other, the mercury 
flows through the tube into the lower globe, the energy of its fall being 
converted into heat, which expands the benzene by an amount easily 
read off on the flue tube. The calibration of this tube may be effected 
by passing a known current through a wire of known resistance sealed 
in one of the balloons, and calculating the heat evolved. {11 Nuovo Ci- 
mento, xv, 18; J. Phys., December, 1885, II, iv, 568.) 

Webster has experimented to determine the mechanical equivalent 
of heat by observing the thermal effect produced by the electric cur- 
rent on a thin ribbon of steel, the temperature being measured from the 
change in resistance. The final value obtained was 4-14 x 10* ergs per 
gram-degree. {Proe. Am. Acad., May, 1885; Phil. Mag., August, 1885,

LIGHT. 

1. Production and Velocity. 

The following is the conclusion reached by De Volson Wood after an 
extended discussion of the properties of the luminiferous aether as de- 
duced from the best obtainable data : “We conclude then that a medium 
whose density- is such that a volume of it equal to about twenty volumes 
of the earth would weigh 1 pound, and whose tension is such that the 


.SCIENTIFIC JJECOKD FUK 1885. 


f)OR 

pressure on a square mile would be about 1 pound, and whose specific 
heat is such that it would require as much heat to raise the temperature 
of 1 pound of it 1° F. as it would to raise about 2,300,000,000 tons of 
water the same amount, will satisfy the requirements of nature in being 
able to transmit a wave of light or heat 186,300 miles per second and 
transmit 133 foot-pounds of heat energy from the sun to the earth each 
second per square foot of surface normally exposed, and also be every- 
where practically non-resisting and sensibly uniform in temperature, 
density, and elasticity. This medium we call the luminiferous aether.” 
{PMl. Mag., November, 1885, V, xx, 389.) 

Fitzgerald has described some mechanical models to illustrate certain 
properties of the aether. The elements consist of pairs of wheels so 
geared together that when one rotates it causes the other to rotate in 
the same direction. For a one-dimensional model a band suffices to con- 
nect them. By fixing a number of wheels with their axes parallel and 
at right angles to a plane and connecting each wheel with its neighbors 
by elastic bands we shall have such a model which represents a non- 
conducting region of the ether. A perfectly conducting region is one 
in which there are no bands, and a partially conducting region would 
be represented by the bands slipping more or less. By means of such 
a model the author discusses electrostatic, electrokinetic, and luminif- 
erous phenomena, preliminary to a description of the tridimensional 
model, which is the object of his paper. {Phil. Mag., June, 1885, V, 
XIX, 438.) 

Trowbridge has experimented to produce, by means of an electric cur- 
rent, a standard of light which shall be always the same under the same 
conditions. His first experiments were made with platinnm, a strip of 
foil 5^^“ long, 5““ wide, and 0’02““ thick being placed in the shunt cir- 
cuit of a small Gramme machine, and inclosed in a Eitchie photometer 
box for comparison with a standard candle, the current being measured 
with a tangent galvanometer, and the difference of potential at the ends 
of the strip with a quadrant electrometer. With a variation of electro- 
motive force of 2‘6 to 3-8 volts and of resistance from 0-44 to 0-47 ohm, 
the current varied from 6 to 8 amperes, and- the light from a very dull 
red up to the color of a candle. Next a thermal junction was inclosed 
in an Edison incandescent lamp to see if the heat radiation was pro- 
portional to the incandescence, bnt the thermo-electric force developed 
was too feeble. A loop of fine platinum wire was then inserted between 
the terminals of the carbon in an Edison lamp and made one side of a 
Wheatstone bridge, a similar wire forming a second side, thus constitut- 
ing a bolometer. With an increase of resistance of the inside loop of 
0-2 ohm, there was an increase of light from 3 to 7-5 candles. Though 
sensitive, this arrangement does not enable rays of different refrangi- 
bility to be distinguished. Experiments were then made to determine 
the practicability of using a thermopile to measure the amount of ra- 
diation from an incandescent strip of platinnm at a fixed distance, and

thus determiue the total energy radiated, the light energy being simul- 
taneously determined by comparison with a standard candle. The heat 
indications were found to be far more sensitive than those of the photom- 
eter. Hence lie suggests as a standard of light an incandescent strip 
which radiates a definite amount of energy, this energy being measured 
at a fixed distance which will best agree numerically with the absolute 
system. [Am. J. Sci., August, 1885, III, xxx, 128.) 

Frederick Siemens has devised an important improvement in gas 
lighting, based on the adoption of the well-known regenerative principle. 
In his opinion rooms should be lighted by means of indirect rays or 
diffused light only, the source of light itself not being directly visible. 
His lamp consists of four approximately spherical and concentric hoods 
of sheet-iron or other suitable material so arranged that the products of 
combustion travel downward between the second and third and upward 
between the third and fourth or outer one, while the air to be heated for 
feeding the flame passes upward between the first and second and 
through the first, filling this hood with very hot air. The products of 
combustion pass through an opening in the top of the outer hood into a 
chimney. The concave surface of the first or lower hood acts as a reflec- 
tor, and in its focus are placed one or more fish-tail burners of the usual 
type. The gas is therefore burned in a highly heated air, the temper- 
ature of which increases with that of the gas fames, the brilliancy of the 
light increasing in the same ratio. Tests with this lamp showed that 
the same burners burning the same amount of gas in the two cases gave 
an average of 2-875 candles per cubic foot of gas consumed when re- 
moved from the hoods and 7-74 candles per cubic foot when burned in 
their proper place in the lamp. [Nature^ July, 1885, xxxii, 247.) 

Wolf has proposed another modification in the well known Foucault’s 
apparatus for the velocity of light. His apparatus consists of two mir- 
rors, one fixed, having a diameter of 0-2 meter, the other movable 5 centi- 
meters in diameter. Both are concave and spherical and have the same 
radius of curvature. 5 meters. The source of light is a narrow aperture 
cut in the silver in the center of the large mirror. The pencil emanating 
from it and entirely covering the rotating mirror is reflected by the 
latter and returns to form on the surface of the fixed mirror a movable 
image of the aperture and of the same size. This is reflected back to 
the revolving mirror, and by this the Foucault image is formed. If 
now the mirror be rotated with sufficient speed there will be formed on 
the fixed mirror a series of equal luminous lines separated by equal 
intervals, which will continue to increase their distance from each other 
as the speed rises. These are Foucault images formed by multiple re- 
flections, and the higher the image winch can be measured the higher the 
imultiple of the Foucault deviation. The author is in hopes of meas- 
uring the twentieth image, which would give a displacement of 35®“.

Some years ago Cornu experimentally established the fact that in 
quartz the mean speed of propagation of the inverse circular waves along 
the optic axis is sensibly equal to the velocity of the ordinary wave 
perpendicular to this axis. Exner has now shown that a more general 
law can be deduced from the formulas given by Cauchy and Von Lang 
to represent the properties of quartz, as follows : For any direction 
whatever the arithmetical mean of the two velocities of propagation is 
equal to the arithmetical mean of the velocities which would Correspond 
to this same direction if the medium did not possess rotatory power. 
Von Lang’s recent measures confirm this law completely. ( WieA. Ann., 
XXV, 141 5 J.Phys., October, 1885, II, iv, 468.) 

Langley has determined photometrically the amount of light trans- 
mitted by wire gauze screens, such as are sometimes used to diminish 
the apparant brightness of stars in making meridian observations. He 
found that one screen transmitted 0.395, two screens 0'144, and three 
screens 0-052 of the incident light. In fact, however, the three screens 
as used with the telescope allowed a transmission of only 0-0014. On 
investigation this result was found to be due to diffraction. Hence the 
author concludes, first, that the transmission as measured by the pho- 
tometer box was equal to the ratio of the sum of the areas of the aper- 
tures of the screen to its total area and, therefore, could be considered to 
be the true transmission of the screen second, that the much smaller 
transmission of the screen when used in front of the object glass of a 
telescope to diminish the apparent brightness of a star is satisfactorily 
accounted for by the loss of light caused by diffraction under these cir- 
cumstances ; and, third, that screens used for this purpose should have 
their constants determined by special experiments of the nature of those 
now described and that their photometric use should then be limited 
to the reduction of the light of bodies possessing a small angular mag- 
nitude. {Am. J. Sci., September, 1885, III, xxx, 210.) 

Fol and Sarasin have investigated the depth to which light pene- 
trates the Mediterranean Sea. By means of photographic plates they 
have proved that in the middle of a sunny day in March the rays of the 
sun do not penetrate below 400 meters from the surface. At 380 meters 
shortly before 11 A. M., the impression on the plate was less than that 
which would have been left on exposure to the air on a clear night 
without a moon. In the lake of Geneva the extreme winter limit is 200 
meters; but they find as much light at 380 meters in the Mediterranean 
as at 192 meters in the lake. The light penetrates 20 to 30 meters 
deeper in the lake in March than in September. {Phil. Mag., January,

of rotation coincides with one of its edges and cuts the optical axis. The 
secondary mirror, instead of being fixed, is movable about an axis par- 
allel to the plane of the graduation and perpendicular to the optic axis. 
Under these conditions the image twice reflected from any given point 
will be displaced in a plane perpendicular to that of the circle when 
the secondary mirror turns about its axis. If the telescope be sup- 
pressed and a simple -vertical slit be placed between the eye and the axis 
of rotation of the movable mirror, and if the mirror be silvered all over, 
an object can be seen above or below it, and it can be made to coincide 
with the image of another object twice reflected and thus their angular 
distance determined, projected on the horizon. {G. E., April, 1885, c, 
1120; Ehil. Mag., June, 1885, Y, xix, 516.) 

Kriiss has investigated the influence of temperature on the refraction 
of prisms in order to determine its comparative importance in spectrum 
measurements. His measurements were made by means of a microm- 
eter which moved the observing telescope in connection with an eye- 
piece micrometer carried by it. Three prisms were measured at dif- 
ferent temperatures. From the results it appears that all spectrum 
lines shift by rise of temperature. In glass prisms this shifting is to- 
ward the -violet ; in quartz prisms toward the red. In the triple glass 
prism a change of temperature of about 5° suffices to alter the measure- 
ment of wave-length by an amount equal to the distance between the 
D lines. Moreover this shifting increases with the refrangibility of the 
region examined. {Ber. Berl. Chem. Ges., December, 1884, xvii, 2732 ; 
Am. J. Sci., March, 1885, III, xxix, 251.) 

Christiansen’s original experiment consists in immersing glass powder 
in a mixture of carbon disulphide and benzene in such proportions that 
for one part of the spectrum the indices of the solid and of the fluid are 
the same. ( Wied. Ann., xxm, 298.) Eayleigh has improved this experi- 
ment by using a flat-sided bottle to contain the preparation, and by hav- 
ing the same kind of glass for the bottle and for the powder. The sides 
of the bottle are worked flat, like plate glass. Ordinary flint does not 
seem to work as well as plate glass, though optical flint answers well. It 
is more important that the powder should be homogeneous in itself than 
that it should correspond very accurately with the glass of the bottle. 
Properly arranged rays lying within a very narrow range of refrangi- 
bility traverse the mixture freely, but the neighboring rays are scattered 
laterally much as in passing ground glass. Two complementary colors 
are therefore exhibited, one by direct the other by oblique light. In 
order to see these to advantage there should not be too much diffused 
illumination, otherwise the directly transmitted monochromatic light is 
liable to be greatly diluted. {Phil. Mag., October, 1885, V, xx, 358.) 

Some years ago Eayleigh examined the effect upon definition of small 
disturbances in the wave surfaces from their jiroper forms, and con- 
cluded that the aberration of a plano-convex lens focusing parallel rays

of homogeneous light is unimportant so long as the fourth power of the 
angular semi-aperture does not exceed the ratio of the wave length to 
the focal distance ; a condition satisfied by a lens of 3 feet focus pro- 
vided that the aperture be less than 2 inches. He has now discussed 
the accuracy of focus necessary for sensibly perfect definition, and has 
reached the result that a displacement from the true focus will not 
impair definition, provided it is less than the product of the wave length 
by the square of the ratio of the focal length to the semi-aperture. 
Hence the linear accuracy required is the same whatever the absolute 
aperture of the object glass may be, provided that the ratio of aperture 
to focal length be preserved. Experimental results confirmed closely 
this theoretical conclusion. {Phil. Mag., October, 1885, V, xx, 354.) 

D’Ocagne has shown that if the two sides of a square and the diag- 
onal be divided into the same number of equal parts, and a straight 
line be drawn from the point on one side corresponding numerically to 
one of the conjugate focal distances through the number of the division 
on the diagonal representing the principal focal length, this line will 
cut the other side at a point representing numerically the other conju- 
gate focal distance. Conversely any right line whatever drawn through 
a point on the diagonal corresponding numerically to the principal 
focus of a lens cuts the sides at points representing its conjugate foci 
as it moves about this point as a center. In practice a rod may be 
pivoted at the given center. {J. Phys., December, 1885, II, iv, 555.) 

Eayleigh has described a monochromatic telescope which is a modi- 
fication of MaxwelFs color box. In this well-known instrument light 
passes through a slit in the focus of a collimating lens and traverses in 
succession this lens, a prism, and another lens, by which it is brought to a 
focus upou a plane surface in which is a movable slit, the eye placed be- 
hind this slit receiving light approximately monochromatic. If now, in 
addition, a lens be placed just behind the first slit so as to bring some 
distant object into focus at a convenient distance from the eye this 
object will be seen by the light that would enter the eye in the simple 
color box. The instrument is to be used to compare lights of different 
colors for practical purposes. {Phil. Mag., June, 1885, Y, xix, 446.) 

Malcolm kas adjusted his binocular glass to eyes of different focal 
lengths by arranging one of the eye pieces so that it can be moved 
through a small range in or out by turning a milled bead. An index 
arrangement is attached by which a given setting may always be repro- 
duced. The unaltered tube is brought to the most perfect focus pos- 
sible in the ordinary way, using only one eye. Then the other tube is 
used with the other eye and focused accurately with its own adjustment, 
the other remaining unchanged. {Phil. Mag., June, 1885, V, xix, 461.) 

3. Dispersion and Color. 

Wiillner, in 1883, showed that the index of any transparent substance 
could be very exactly represented in terms of wave length by a formula 
given by him. Sipce that time he has compared the experimental re-

suits obtained by Mascartand Esselbach with quartz in the ultra violet, 
and by Monton and Langley for flint in the ultra red, and finds the for- 
mula very exactly verified in all cases. In the case of quartz the discrep- 
ancy reaches the third decimal place of the index only for the extreme 
red (A=:21-4x 10 “®,) In the case of flint the divergence becomes 
sensible only for the line O and for the extreme red (A = 28 x 10 “®). 
For the line O the value observed, 1*6266, lies between 1*6242 and 1*6277, 
calculated from Mascart’s and Esselbach’s wave lengths. ( Wied. Ann., 
xxni, 306 ; J. Phys., July, 1885, II, ry, 324.) 

Clemenshaw exhibited to the London Physical Society some experi- 
ments in projecting the spectra of the metals without the aid of the 
electric light. A small quantity of a solution of the salt to be experi- 
mented on is put into a bottle in which hydrogen is being evolved by 
the action of dilute sulphuric acid on zinc. The bottle has three necks, 
through one of which an acid funnel is passed, a second carries the jet, 
and through the third hydrogen or coal gas isfedinto the apparatus, the 
flame being thus regulated. The jet, which is from one-eighth to three- 
sixteenth inch in diameter, is surrounded by a larger tube, through 
which oxygen passes to the flame ; the- result being a brilliant light 
giving the spectrum of the substance, which is carried over mechanic- 
ally by the evolved hydrogen. The spectra of sodium, lithium, and 
strontium were shown upon the screen and the absorption of the so- 
dium light by a Bunsen flame containing sodium was clearly seen. {Phil. 
Mag., May, 1885, Y, xix, 365 5 Nature, February, 1885, xxxi, 329.) 

Koenig presented in May to the Physical Society of Berlin the plan 
of a new spectro photometer then in course of construction. It consisted 
of a tube containing a lens and a diaphragm turned toward the source 
of light, and having two slits lying the one above the other, a prism for 
decomposing the two incident beams, and a second collimating tube 
with a disk closing the end, on which appeared the two spectra slightly 
separated. Before the lens of the observing telescope was placed a twin 
prism, the two halves, with refracting edges of 1 ° to 2 °, being cemented 
together. By this twin prism each spectrum was decomposed into two 
spectra, and the dimensions of the twin prism were so determined that 
on the disk of the collimator one spectrum was situated above the other 
below, while in the middle the second spectrum from the upper slit 
coincided with the second spectrum of the lower slit. In the disk of the 
observing telescope a small opening is made cutting off a small piece 
of determinate wave length from the double spectrum, so that on look- 
ing through it the field of visiou is seen divided by a line (the refract- 
ing edges of the twin prism) into two halves, both of the same coloring. 
Before each of the two slits of the slit collimator a Nicol prism was placed 
in such a position that light polarized in a vertical plane entered one 
and in a horizontal plane the other. The middle compound spectrum 
consisted therefore of a vertically and a horizontally polarized spectrum, 
and in the field of view the two like-colored halves were also polarized 


614 


SCIENTIFIC EECORD FOE 1885. 


in perpendicular planes. If now the field is viewed through a Nicol 
prism, then according to the position of its principal section would the 
one half at one time and the other half at another time be in\'isible. 
So that if the two entering beams of light have different intensities 
their spectra may be equalized in brightness by rotating the Nicol; and 
from the degree of rotation the relative intensities be inferred. {Nature^ 
June, 1885, xxxii, 191.) 

Balmer, in calculating the wave lengths of the hydrogen lines as given 
by Angstrom, has found a relation between these lines expressed by the 

formula when O has the value 3,645-6 millionths of a 

m^—4z 

millimeter. In place of m let there be put in turn the numbers 3, 4, 5, 6; 
and the values for Angstrom’s wave lengths of the four visible hydrogen 
lines are obtained. If for m, the values 7, 8, &c., up' to 16 are used, 
values for hydrogen lines are obtained which correspond very well with 
the wave lengths of the lines which Dr. Huggins had found in the ultra- 
violet spectrum of the white stars and had recognized as the invisible 
hydrogen lines. This relation between the hydrogen lines had now re- 
ceived an increased significance from an investigation by Cornu, in 
which he had found a perfectly determinate proportionality between the 
lines of the ultra-violet spectrum of aluminum and of thallium, and the 
ultra-violet hydrogen lines. Like the hydrogen lines, the pairs of lines 
of the two metals referred to advanced much nearer to one another and 
became much paler the more one approached the more refrangible 
end of the spectrum ; and if any line of the aluminum or the thallium 
spectrum was made to coincide with the corresponding line of the hydro- 
gen spectrum then did all the remaining lines coincide. This relation 
obtained both for the first and for the second components of the pairs 
of lines in the metallic spectra. {Nature, July, 1885, xxxii, 312.) 

Crookes has communicated to the Eoyal Society a paper on radiant 
matter spectroscopy, in which he gives the results of further re- 
searches on the prismatic analysis of the light emitted by the cerium 
group of earths when made to phosphoresce by the impact of radiant 
matter in high vacua. With regard to the double orange band observed 
in 1881, he details at length the extraordinary difficulties overcome in 
localizing it. “After six months’ work I obtained the earth didymia in 
a state which most chemists would call absolutely pure, for it contained 
probably not more than 1 part of impurity in 500,000 parts of didymia. 
But this 1 part in 500,000 profoundly altered the character of didymia 
from a radiant matter spectroscopic point of view, and the presence of 
this very minute quantity of interfering impurity entailed another .six 
months’ extra labor to eliminate these traces and to ascertain the re- 
action of didymia pure and simple.” Gradually the matter was nar- 
rowed down and the orange band was finally traced to samarium. Pure 
samarium sulphate alone gives a very feeble phosphorescent spectrum. 
But when the samaria is mixed with lime the spectrum is, if anything. 


PHYSICS. 


615 


more beautiful than that of yttrium. The bands are not so numerous, 
but the contrasts are sharper. Examined with a somewhat broad slit, 
the spectrum is seen to consist of three bright bands, red, orange, and 
green, nearly equidistant, the orange being the brightest. With a nar- 
row slit the orange and green band^ are seen to be double, and on closer 
examination faint wings are seen like shadows to the orange and green 
bands. But lime is not the only body which brings out the phospho- 
rescent spectrum. The author divides the samaria spectra, as modified 
by other metals, into three groups. The first comprises the spectra 
given when glucinum, magnesium, zinc, cadmium, lanthanum, bismuth, 
or antimony is mixed with the samarium. It consists simply of three 
colored bands, red, orange, and green. The second type of spectrum 
gives a single red and orange band and a double green band, and is 
produced when barium, strontium, thorium, or lead is mixed .with the 
samarium. The third type is given when calcium is mixed with the 
samarium. Here the red and green are single and the orange double. 
Aluminum would also faU into this class were it not that the broad, ill- 
defined, green band is also doubled. On mixing samaria and yttria no 
trace of the yttria spectrum was observable up to 57 per cent, of this 
earth. When it reached 65 per cent, a marked change took place. 
With 44 of samaria and 56 of yttria the pure samarium spectrum is 
given. With 42 samaria and 58 yttria some bands characteristic of each 
earth are seen; while 39 samaria and 61 yttria gives almost a pure 
yttrium spectrum, the sharp orange line, however, running across them 
all. Experiments made to test the delicacy of this method showed that 
when 1 part of samarium is mixed with 100,000 parts of calcium the 
green and red bands have almost disappeared, but the double orange 
band is still very prominent. With 1 to 500,000 and 1 to 1,000,000 the 
spectrum is the same though fainter. With 1 to 2,500,000 the bands of 
samarium have entirely gone and its presence is recognized only by the 
darkening in the yellow portion of what otherwise would be a con- 
tinuous spectrum. {Nature, July, 1885, xxxil, 283.) 

Barker has published an account of the experiments made by Henry 
Draper on the use of carbon disulphide in prisms for optical purposes. 
The extraordinary mobility of this liquid and its extreme sensitiveness 
to heat cause striae in its mass, which interfere with and practically de- 
stroy its definition. Since Dr. Draper’s experiments showed it to be the 
only substanee by which the necessary dispersion could be readily ob- 
tained for photographing metallic spectra, he was exceedingly desirous 
of improving its definition. The desired object he found was readily ob- 
tained by simple agitation. A wire was passed through the stopper of 
the bottle (Thollon) prism, upon the lower end of which was a small pro- 
peller just dipping into the liquid. By means of a pulley on the upper end 
of the shaft, and a Uttle electric motor, this propeller could be revolved 
rapidly so as to keep the liquid actively agitated. The effect was sur- 
prising. The sodium lines, with the propeller at rest, were fiuffy and

ill defined, united together and nebulous. But in a few seconds after 
starting it the lines became clear and remarkably sharp, continuing so 
as long as the motion continued. But now the effect of temperature be- 
came apparent in the shifting of the lines toward the red if the prism 
was rising and toward the blue if falling in temperature. For a change 
of about 9° the shifting was something over 3-o inches. To overcome 
this shifting the prism was inclosed in an even-temperature box, and 
by means of a simple ‘but ingenious thermostat the temperature was 
regulated so that in seven hours it varied by an amount sufficient to 
shift the sodium lines by only the distance between them. .{Am. J. 
ScL, April, 1885, III, xxix, 269.) 

Langley has investigated the optical properties of rock salt worked 
into prisms by Clark and by Brashear with such exquisite surfaces 
that thqy give a spectrum showing the Fraunhofer lines with all the 
sharpness of flint glass. Indeed, a rock-salt prism made by the latter 
shows the nickel line between the Ds. Experiments with a train of such 
prisms were made to determine not only the indices for different lines 
in the visible and invisible spectrum, but also the apparent transmis- 
sion of rock-salt plates for different parts of the spectrum. Heat spec- 
tra were formed from radiating sources below the temperature of melt- 
ing ice, and it was found that most of the rays, even from these sources, 
passed freely through the prism. With the smallest deviations, corre- 
sponding to wave lengths exceeding probably 100,000 of Angstrom’s 
scale, a slight absorption began to be noticed. A table is given of the 
refractive indices of a prism of angle 59° 57' 54" for the spectrum lines 
from M in the ultra violet to D, in the ultra red; or from wave length 
0’3727 to 1-32. The values in the visible spectrum are given to six 
places, those in the ultra red to four. For the line M, the refractive 
index is 1-57486 ; for G, 1-56133 ; for D, 1-54418 ; for A, 1-53670 ; and 
for £2, 1-5268. In all, seventeen indices were measured. (Aj«. J. Set., 
December, 1885, III, xxx, 477.) 

Lommel has suggested the use of phosphorescent substances, such 
as Balmain’s luminous paint or a greenish-blue variety of i^hosphores- 
cent calcium sulphide, for the purpose of rendering visible the focus of 
ultra-red rays in the well-known experiment of Tyndall on calorescence. 
If such a powder be made slightly i>hosphoresceut by exposure to or- 
dinary daylight the less refrangible rays increase it to a bright lumi- 
nosity. In place of a solution of iodine in carbon disulphide as the 
absorbing solution, Lommel recommends a solution of nigrosin in alco- 
hol or chloroform, preferably the latter. ( Wied. Ann., 1885, xxvi, 157 ; 
Phil. Mag,, December, 1885, V, xx, 547.) 

Lommel has shown that if a conical beam of solar light be allowed 
to fall on a cube of Iceland spar, either directly or after passing a co- 
balt-blue glass, the cube emits a beautiful brick- red light. This light 
is not polarized and its composition does not depend upon the state of 
polarization of the incident beam. It is comprised between 35 and 65

of Bunsen’s scale (between C and D | E), its maximum being near 44. 
The exciting rays are almost exclusively visible rays, the most efficient 
being those between E and 6. Hence Iceland spar presents a maxi- 
mum of absorption at this point. ( Wied. Ann., xxi, 422 ; J. Phys., No- 
vember, 1885, 11, rv, 535.) 

Abney has described some lecture experiments on color mixtures, 
employing for this purpose a modification of Maxwell’s color box. The 
spectrum, instead of being formed on a screen, is received upon a convex 
lens, which forms an image of the face of the prism on a screen. If all 
the light from the prism falls upon the lens this image is colorless. But 
by interposing a screen with a slit in the spectrum close to the lens, so 
as only to allow light of a given color to fall on the lens, the image ap- 
pears colored with that light. By using two or more slits mixtures of 
different lights in any required proportion may be obtained. {Nature, 
July, 1885, XXXII, 263.) 

4. Interference and Polarization. 

Lummer has called attention to the fact that if a concave mirror, sil- 
vered over its whole surface excepting a small place the size of the 
pupil, be made to refiect the light of a lamp burning alcohol saturated 
with salt, normally upon a plate of plane glass with parallel faces, the 
eye placed at the opening when adjusted for distant objects will see 
the plate covered with a great number of concentric rings whose centers 
are at the foot of the normal from the center of the pupil on the plate. 
If a telescope adjusted for parallel rays be substituted for the naked 
eye, the incidence corresponding to each of these rings may be meas- 
ured. This phenomena has been observed by Haidinger and studied 
by Mascart, who has given a formula giving the difference of path of 
the two interfering rays as a function of the incident angle. The author 
suggests this method to detect want of parallelism in glass, the rings 
being then irregular. ( Wied. Ann., xxiil, 49 ; J. Phys., February, 1885, 
n, lY, 90.) 

Moreland has described a mechanical model which he uses to illustrate 
the phenomena of interference. Two blocks cut in sine curves are at- 
tached to two points by strings fastened to their ends. At a point ex- 
actly perpendicular to the center of a line joining these two points the 
waves are in the same phase and reinforce each other. By moving both 
blocks either way a position is reached where they are in opposite 
phases and interfere. {Am. J. 8ei., January, 1885, III, xxix, 5.) 

Stokes has communicated to the Koyal Society the results of an ex- 
tended investigation of the brilliantly colored iridescent crystals of po- 
tassium chlorate sometimes obtained in the process of manufacture. 
He regards it as conclusively proved that the seat of the color is in a 
very thin twin stratum, and he entertains little or no doubt that the 
color depends in some way on the different orientation of the planes of 
polarization in the two components of a twin and on the difference of 


618 


SCrENTIFIC EECORD FOR 1885. 


retardation of the two polarized pencils which traverse the thin stratum. 
Anything beyond this is at present only a matter of speculation Only 
two directions are indicated in which to look for a possible explanation; 
and these will form the subject of further investigation. {Nature^ April, 
June, July, 1885, xxxi, 565; xxxn, 102, 224.) 

From the researches of Tollens, Landolt, Schmitz, and others it is 
well known that cane sugar and many other substances have a specific 
rotatory power which varies continuously when the proportion of inactive 
liquid is increased. For sugar, however, the diminution is very feeble 
as the concentration increases, even more feeble than for glucose. With 
dilute solutions containing 1 to 5 per cent, of sugar, Hesse had found 
[o-jj, = 68° about, a number rather higher than is obtained with more 
concentrated solutions. Tollens, operating upon dilute solutions with 
a polarimeter of great sensitiveness, has completely confirmed his earlier 
conclusions, and finds that whatever be the concentration the formula 
[ar]i, = 66’386 + 0’015035jp — 0'0003986^*, where p is the weight of sugar 
in 100 of solution, always represents the variations of rotatory power. It 
has been confirmed on solutions containing from 1 to 67 per cent, of 
sugar. {Ber. Berl. Chem. Ges., xvil, 1751.) 

Madan has described a modification of Foucault’s and of Ahrens’s 
polarizing prisms. Ahrens’s prism is made of three wedges of Iceland 
spar cemented together by Canada balsam. The optic axis in the two 
outer wedges is parallel to the refracting edge, while in the middle 
wedge it is perpendicular to the refracting edge and lies in a plane bi- 
secting the refracting angle. By using three prisms the middle one 
may be given a very large angle, and yet the deviation of the rays may 
be so far corrected that on emergence they make equal angles with the 
central line. Nearly in contact with one of the terminal faces of the 
prism a prism of dense glass is placed of such an angle that it just cor- 
rects the deviation of one of the rays, and also achromatizes it, while 
it increases the deviation of the other ray to such an extent that it may 
be practically disregarded, an eye even when very close to the prism 
perceiving only the direct beam. {Phil. Mag., January, 1885, Y, xix, 69.) 
Madan finds that the ordinary ray falls on the second surface of the 
middle prism of this combination at an angle greater than the critical 
angle and is therefore totally reflected if an air film be i)laced between 
this surface and the following one. Moreover, he finds that the devia- 
tion and the dispersion can be almost entirely corrected by making the 
third prism of crown glass combined with a prism of very dense flint 
glass of smaller angle. Its field is 28°. {RaMre, February, 1885, xxxi, 
371.) 

ELECTRICITY. 

1. Magnetism. 

Werner Siemens has published a theory of magnetism and has de- 
tailed the experiments upon which it is based. In the first place, the 
Araperian theory must be extended by supposing that not only mag-

netic substances but all bodies, as well as empty space, are filled with cir- 
cular currents of very small dimensions and that magnetic substances 
differ from non-magnetic substances only inasmuch as the number of cir- 
cular currents present in the unit volume is much greater in the first 
case than in the second. All magnetic phenomena may then be referred 
to the property of the electric current of exerting a directive force upon 
the molecular solenoids which fill all space, but which are present in 
greater numbers in the so called magnetic bodies, which place their axes 
at right angles to its direction and tend to bring them into closer con- 
centric attraction circles. The magnitude of this rotation of the axes, 
depends, on the one hand, on the magnitude of the directive or mag- 
netizing force, and, on the other hand, on the number of the molecular 
circuits pre-existing in the unit volume, for which condition the term 
“magnetic conductivity” may be employed, or that of “magnetic resist- 
ance” for its reciprocal value. Since a magnetizing force, acting upon 
the molecular magnets only, exerts a perceptible influence on the rota- 
tion apart from each other of the paired elementary magnets when all 
the neighbors in the magnetic circuit follow the motion and so are able 
to produce a closed system of equilibrium capable of mutual attraction, 
it follows that the rotation directly produced by the magnetizing force 
must be very small in comparison with the mutual strengthening of the 
rotation in the closed magnetic circuit. The magnetic moment pro- 
duced must thus be essentially the product of the mutual strengthening 
of rotation of which the magnetizing force is the cause. ( Wied. Ann., 
XXIV, 93; Phil. Mag., April, 1885, Y, xix, 237; J. Phys., September, 1885, 
n, iv, 426.) 

Bosanquet has ijublished a series of magnetic measurements made to 
test his theory of magnetism. His formulas suppose that each molecule 
has one and only one axis of transmission (like a bead with a hole in it)- 
The axis is capable of transmitting a certain number of lines of force 
and no more, and the molecular permeability is jiroportional to the 
defect of saturation. (If the hole in the bead be packed with thin 
wires the aperture remaining is represented by the number of wires 
that remain to be got in.) Regarding magnetism as a motion or dis- 
placement, whether dynamic or static, we may thus speak of the molec- 
ular permeability as a coefficient of freedom within the molecule. The 
reciprocal of the coefficient of the forces which tend to prevent the ro- 
tation of the molecule as a whole may be spoken of as a coefficient of 
freedom without the molecule. The product of these two coefficients 
by a constant is a characteristic of a given approximate state of a given 
piece of metal. As between the hard steel and the iron the product of 
the coefficients of freedom is proportional to the maximum permeability. 
In soft steel the molecular forces are chiefly extra-molecular, the free- 
dom intra molecular ; in hard steel the reverse is true. In soft iron 
the average intra-molecular freedom is much greater than in hard steel, 
the extra-molecular frec'dom about the same. In soft steel the extra- 


620 


SCIENTIFIC EECOED FOE 1885. 


molecular freedom is much diminished, the iutra-molecular freedom is 
moderate or high. His figures show a maximum permeability for cast 
iron of 170 to 250, for malleable cast iron of 700 to 800, of wrought iron 
of 1,800 to 2,500, and of charcoal iron of 2,900 to 3,000. Hence the infer- 
ence that ordinary cast iron is wholly unfit for use in dynamo machines. 
Malleable cast iron is an improvement, but is still very far inferior to 
wrought iron. {FMl. Mag., January, February, May, October, 1885, V, 
XIX, 57, 73, 333, xx, 318.) 

Lippmann has suggested a simple method by which the magnetic po- 
tential of a system of coils may be obtained without calculation. The 
three coils, a, /S, and y, are so placed at the summits of an equilateral 
triangle that their axes may form the three sides of an equilateral tri- 
angle, ABO. The variation of magnetic potential due to this system, 
and taken from B to O, is exactly equal to the product 4:7ini, i being 
the current strength and n the number of turns in each coil. In order 
to demonstrate this it is sufficient to remark that if the integral of the 
magnetic actions exerted by the coil a considered by itself be taken 
along the contour of the triangle ABC, this integral is exactly equal 
to 4:7ini, because the contour of the triangle is a closed line. On the 
other hand, the action exerted by a on the side OA may be replaced by 
the action of y on the side BC, or the action of a on the side CA may 
be replaced by the action of /? upon the side BO, so that finally the 
action of the system of the three coils on the side BC is equal to the 
sum of the actions exerted by a on the three sides of ABO, i. e., to 
4:7zm, as above. (J. Phys., October, 1885, II, iv, 448.) 

Ewing has communicated to the Eoyal Society the results of an ex- 
tended investigation into magnetic susceptibility, and the influence 
upon it of various conditions, such as vibration, permanent strain, tem- 
perature, and the like; the experiments having been made in the labor- 
atory of the University of Tokio. {Nature, January, 1885, xxxi, 304.) 

Bakmetieff has studied the conditions of the production of heat by 
alternate magnetizations in a straight wire of iron, measuring the heat 
by means of a thermo-junction, so that the greater heating in the middle 
portions of the straight magnet and the equality of heating in all parts 
of the annular magnet could be readily observed. The proportionality 
of the heating to the square of the temporary magnetism was not con- 
firmed ; on the contrary, the author advances another law, i. e., that the 
elevation of temperature of the iron by intermittent magnetization is 
proportional to the product of the magnetizing force and the magnetic 
moment. The greatest elevation of temperature observed corresponds 
to a magnetizing force more than sufficient to saturate the iron; hence 
the author concludes that it is the increase in the motion of the molec- 
ular magnets during magnetization which is most important in the 
production of heat. {J. Soc. Phys. Chim. Russe, xvi, 81, 257 ; J. Phys., 
December, 1885, II, iv, 593.)

Fossati has shown that the common impi’ession that the sti’ength ol 
a horse-shoe steel magnet is increased by hanging it up and gradually 
increasing the weights hung on its keeper is entirely an error, the in- 
crease in portative force being the same whether the magnet be weighted 
or not. This increase is in all cases much less than is supposed ; and 
its variation is accompanied by a corresponding variation in distribu- 
tion. {11 Nuovo Cimento., XV, 158, 232 j J. Phys., December, 1885, II, iv, 
565.) 

Barus and Strouhal have x)ublished, as the fourteenth Bulletin of the 
U. S. Geological Survey, an extended memoir on the physical charac- 
teristics of the iron carburets; more particularly on the galvanic, ther- 
mo-electric, and magnetic properties of wrought iron, steel, and cast 
iron in different states of hardness, together with a physical diagram for 
the classification of iron carburets. With reference to steel, the authors 
say : “ The difl'erence between the logarithms of the respective values of 
thermo-electric hardness for the same carburation passes through a 
pronounced maximum defining a carbide, the mechanical properties of 
which are those of a tyjie steel and may be fully given thus : Let each 
member of the whole series of iron carburets be subjected successively 
to the following operations ; I, A process of very slow cooling from a given 
temperature in red heat ; II, a process of most rapid cooling possible from 
the same temperatpre. If now the carburets be examined with reference 
to the hardness produced in the two istances there will be found among 
them a certain unique member whose properties are such that while 
process I has ipore nearly identified it with pure soft iron, process II will 
have moved it farther away from this initial carburet than is simulta- 
neuosly the case with any other iron-carbon product; a unique member, 
in other words, which is capable of occurring in the greatest number of 
states of hardness relative to the . soft state possible. To the said prod- 
uct the term ‘ steel’ is to be apifiied.” 

Perkins has made an investigation on the variation of the magnetic 
permeability of nickel at different temperatures and has plotted the re- 
sults obtained. The curves show that at the first all the magnetism is 
temijorarj-. The permeability rises to a maximum at about the same 
place as that of total magnetization, then falls less rapidly and approaches 
the total, though it is evident that it can never reach it, since the perma- 
nent magnetism cannot be less fora high magnetizing force than for a 
lower at any given temperature. {Am. J. 8ci., September, 1885, III, 
XXX, 218.) 

Hurion has examined and confirmed the statement of Eighi that the 
electric resistance of bismuth increases when this metal is subjected to 
the action of an electro-magnet. From his experiments he concludes 
that the variation in the resistance of bismuth under these circumstances

Topler has suggested the use of the balance in measuring the quan- 
tity MH in determining the horizontal component of the earth’s mag- 
netism. For this purpose a magnetized bar is fixed perpendicularly to 
the brass beam of a balance in place of the ordinary pointer. Weights 
are placed in the scale pans in order to make the axis of the magnet 
vertical when the plane of oscillation is in the magnetic meridian. The 
balance is then turned through 180° and again the axis is adjusted to 
verticality by shifting the weights. MH is then equal to J (Qi— Q 2 ) I’, 
in which I is the length of that arm of the beam to which the weights 
Qi and Q 2 have been added. The author details the precautions neces- 
sary to insure accuracy, and claims ^00 the limit of precision of the 
method. ( Wied. Ann,, xxi, 158; J. Phys., December, 1885, II, iv, 587.) 

Gray has described the methods in use in the laboratory of the Univer- 
sity, Glasgow, for determining the value of the earth’s horizontal com- 
ponent. Experiments to determine the effect of length and hardness 
on the induction coefficient of the deflector magnets show that the 
length of the magnets should be at least forty times their diameter and 
that they should be made as hard as possible. The results are given 
in a table. {Phil. Mag., December, 1885, V, xx, 484.) 

2. Electric Generators. 

The paper on the seat of the electro- motive forces in the voltaic cell 
with which Lodge opened the discussion of this subject at the Montreal 
meeting of the British Association has appeared in full, and is a most 
valuable and impartial resum6 of the history of this important subject, 
and an able argument in favor of the views that the apparent difference 
of potential of copper and zinc is in fact the sum of a copper-air and a 
zinc-air contact difference. {Proc. British Assoc, for 1884, 464; Proc. 
80 c. Teleg. Eng. and Elec., xiv, 186 ; Phil. Mag,, March, April, May, 
June, October, 1885, Y, xix, 153, 254, 340, 487 ; xx, 372.) 

Koosen has constructed a form of battery based on the depolarizing 
action of bromine. It consists of a glass jar having a narrow prolonga- 
tion at its lower portion to contain the bromine, above which is a porous 
plate supporting a porous cup containing a rod of amalgamated zinc. 
A platinum wire traversing the porous plate makes communication 
with the bromine. The upper portion of the jar is filled with dilute 
sulphuric acid, on which rests a thin layer of petroleum to prevent the 
escape of the bromine vapors into the atmosphere. The electro motive 
force of the combination is 1'9 volts and becomes souiewhat higher if 
the platinum is replaced by carbon. The internal resistance is consid- 
erable, but the battery is very constant. ( Wied. Ann., xxin, 348 ; J. 
Phys., August, 1885, II, iv, 373.) 

Von Helmholtz has constructed a modified form of Daniell cell, which 
cousists of a deep glass goblet, in the bottom of which is a copper spiral 


PHYSICS. 


()23 


connected with a platinum wire insulated in a glass tube and reaching 
to the surface. The spiral is covered with copper sulphate solution, 
which can be replaced by fresh solution poured in through a funnel 
reaching to the bottom. On this solution lies a solution of zinc sulphate 
in which the zinc cylinder is placed. A siphon whose outer leg is 
directed from below upwards dips into the liquids as far as the bound- 
ing plane, so that on pouring in fresh copper solution only the colorless 
supernatant zinc solution flows off. The upper solution is by this means 
kept free of copper, although after awhile some copper was found to be 
precipitated upon the zinc cylinder, not sufficient, however, to impair 
the constancy of the cell. {Nature, January, 1885, xix, 308 ; Am. J. Sci., 
March, 1885, III, xxix, 257.) 

Hayes and Trowbridge have investigated by a photographic method 
the irregularities which occur in the action of galvanic batteries, and 
have soqght to ascertain the cause thereof. Since batteries in which 
there is no porous partition do not show irregularities, while those con- 
taining porous cups all give more or less marked variations, the authors 
believe that these irregularities are due, flrst, to a clogging of the 
pores of the partition by some product of the action, and, second, to 
electrical osmose ; the undulations being due to the former cause, and the 
fluctuations, which are superposed upon the undulations, to the latter. 
A cup of very dense earthenware gives both undulations and fluctuations, 
while one which was very porous gave fluctuations without undulations. 
Since, as Wiedemann has shown, a porous cup increases the amount of 
metal transported to the negative pole and diminishes the quantity of 
acid at the positive pole, a battery containing a small, thick cup and 
giving a strong current will possess a maximum force tending to drive 
the liquid and base from the positive pole and to cause a corresponding- 
decrease in the current strength. Hence the partition should be made 
of as large surface dimensions as possible, and should be made of very 
porous material. {Am. J. 8ci., July, 1885, III, xxx, 34.) 

It follows, as a consequence of the law of the conservation of energy, 
as has been shown by Von Helmholtz and Thomson, that the electro-mo- 
tive force of non-polarizing batteries is proportional to the energy of 
the reactions developed in them by the passage of the current and may 
be calculated from these reactions. To make this i)roposition incontest- 
able it is necessary that the total chemical energy of the battery should 
be converted necessarily into electric energy. The theoretical discus- 
sion of this question has been recently made b^' Von Helmholtz, and 
Czapski has undertaken to investigate experimentally the following re- 
sults drawn from Von Helmholtz’s conclusions : The batteries which do 
not transform all the chemical energy into electrical energy are those 
the electro-motive force of which decreases as the temperature rises, 
and those which i^roduce an electrical energy in excess of their calorific 
energy are those in which the electro-motive force increases with the 
temperature. Czapski’s results confirm in general this theory of Vqq

Bidwell has constructed a voltaic cell having a solid electrolyte. He 
exhibited to the London Physical Society a cell consisting of plates of sil- 
ver and copper, between which was contained a mixture of one part of cop- 
per sulphide and five of sulphur. The electro motive force was 0-07 volt 
and the internal resistance 6,537 ohms, and the current readily deflected 
the nee, die of a reflecting galvanometer so as to throw the light off the 
scale. A second cell was made with a copper plate on which copper sul- 
phide had been pressed and a silver plate resting on silver suli)hide on the 
surface of the copper sulphide. The silver plate was brushed over with a 
dilute solution of sulphur in carbon disulphide and then heated till the 
li ee sulphur was driven off. On putting the cell together it produced a 
current of 6,800 micro-amperes through an external resistanceof 0’2 ohm. 
The copper and silver plates were each 2J by 2 inches, and the thickness of 
the two layers of sulphide 0.05 inch. The electro motive force of the cell 
is 0-053 volt, and its internal resistance is therefore about 7 ohms. 
[Nature, August, 1885, xxxii, 345 ; Phil. Mag., October, 1885, V, xx, 
328.) 

The interesting subject of the behavior of selenium to light as regards 
its electric resistance has been examined by several investigators. Wer- 
ner Siemens has described the electro-motive action of certain selenium 
cells sent to him by Fritts, who first observed in them the fact that, 
when placed in circuit with a galvanometer, an electric current flowing 
from the gold leaf to the base plate was generated by the action of 
light. Siemens confirms this observation and regards it as of the great- 
est scientific importance. Since obscure thermal rays are without effect, 
the action cannot be a thermo-electric one. Moreover, the electro-motive 
force developed is proportional to the intensity of the light. He con- 
cludes, therefore, that “ here we meet for the first time with an instance 
of the direct conversion of the energy of light into electrical energy.” 
[Per. AJc. Perl., February, 1885; Phil. Mag., April, 1885, V, xix, 315; 
Am. J. Sci., June, 1885, III, xxix, 495.) 

Bidwell has investigated very carefully the phenomena of selenium 
cells and is disposed to regard the change of resistance by the action 
of light as a phenomenon of electrolysis. *Since the selenium in the 
cells has always undergone a prolonged heating in contact with the me- 
tallic terminals, selenides of these metals may exist within the selenium, 
forming a kind of network, thus affording the conducting material 
throughout the mass. A cell constructed of silver wires and sulphur 
containing some silver sulphide was sensitive, its resistance being re- 
duced to one-third by burning a piece of magnesium wire near it. In 
the electrolysis of silver sulphide, however, sulphur itself would be de- 
posited on the metallic jjlate, and the resistance would be enormously 
increased, unless under the action of light this sulphur united with the 
(Silver. Moreover, he finds the specific resistance of selenium to be 2,500

uiegohms, a value very much higher than that in the cells, thus sug- 
gesting the formation of selenides which act as conducting bodies. 
{Phil. Mag., August, 1885, V, xx, 178^; Nature, June, July, 1885, xxxii,

The Clamond thermo-battery has-been improved in the details of its 
construction and its efficiency increased. A model made up of one hun- 
dred and twenty pairs gave an electro-motive force of 8 volts and had 
an iuternal resistance of only 3-2 ohms. Another battery, containing 
sixty pairs, gave an electro motive force of 3-6 volts and an iuternal re- 
sistance of only 0*65 ohm. Both batteries consumed about the same 
amount of gas, about 180 liters per hour. {Am. J. Sci., June, 1885, 111, 
XXIX, 495.) 

Kayser has given to the Berlin Physical Society an account of the 
measurements he has made on an improved form of Noe thermo-elec- 
tric generator, differing from the old one in the fact that the bars of the 
bismuth alloy are now connected by strips of an alloy offering greater 
resistance to heat than did the wires formerly used. The resistance at 
the ordinary temperature was 0-9 Siemens unit and rose as the gas con- 
sumption increased to about 1*2 s. u. when this consumption was dO**- 
])er hour. The curve of electro-motive force formed a straight line. 
As to the cost of generating electricity in this way, a current of one 
ampere for an hour cost about one pfennig, whereas with the Bunsen 
cell the cost is about three times as great. {Nature, January’:, 1885, xxxi, 
3(18.) 

Von Waltenhofeu has observed that if an electric current from any 
source whatever be passed through an ordinary thermo-electric ele- 
ment, and then the element be put on a closed circuit, a current will be 
obtained contrary in direction to the exciting current. This inverse 
current results of course from the difference of temperature produced 
by the current at the junctions in virtue of the Peltier effect. If, how- 
ever, the ordinary thermo-electric element be replaced by a dissymetric 
thermopile, like the Noe battery, it will be observed that, according to 
the direction of the current sent into it, the intensity of the secondary 
current will vary, but its direction will remain the same. It is therefore 
independent of the direction of the charging current. ( Wied. Ann., xxi, 
360 ; J. Phys., December, 1885, II, iv, 572.) 

3. Electrical Units and Measurements. 

Jamieson has presented a paper to the Society of Telegraph Engineers 
and Electricians upon electrical definitions, nomenclature, and notation, 
calling attention to the very considerable confusion of the electrical 
vocabulary in consequence of the rapid progress of electrical science, a 
variety of terms being used to express the same idea on the one hand 
and on the other the same term being used in many different senses, 
lie suggests how these natnes should be restricted, and gives a set of 
symbols for them by which they should always be represented in for-

mulas. The society was asked to appoint a committee to take this sub- 
ject into consideration and to act with a jsimilar committee already ap- 
pointed by the Soci4t6 Internationale des Electriciens. (Proc. 8oc. Teleg. 
Png. and Elec., xiv, 297 ; Nature, June, 1885, xxxii, 184.) 

The British Association committee on electrical standards reported 
at the Aberdeen meeting, through the secretary, that they had had con- 
structed a series of coils to serve as standards in terms of the legal 
(Paris) ohm, assuming this ohm to be 1-0112 B. A. unit. These stand- 
ards, ten in number, had been carefully compared with each other, by 
the methods already described in reports of the committee, and also 
with mercury tube resistances prepared by Benoit, of Paris. The legal 
ohm standards as constructed by the committee exceed those constructed 
in Paris by 0-00049 legal ohm. Standards of electro-motive force and of 
capacity should also be issued by the committee, in their opinion. [Na- 
ture, October, 1885, xxxn, 528.) 

Klemencic has determined the ratio between the electro-static and 
the electro-magnetic systems of units by the following method : The 
current of a battery of 9 to 15 Daniell cells is made to charge a condenser 
which is then discharged through the wire of a galvanometer. The per- 
manent deviation which results from these continuous discharges is 
noted, as well as the arc of impulsion of the galvanometer under the in- 
fluence of the direct current from the battery. The capacity of the con- 
denser is then calculated in electro-magnetic measure. The value in 
electro-static measure is deduced from the theory of Kirchhoff. In other 
experiments the battery charges the condenser, and at the same time 
acts upon a differential galvanometer through one of its coils placed in 
shunt circuit. The discharge of the condenser traverses the second 
wire and the resistances are so regulated that there is no deviation. 
The author gives as the value of the constant v of Maxwell, 3-0188 x 
10“ cm. sec. (Ber. Ak. Wien., 1884, 885 J. Phys., April, 1885, II, rv, 183.) 

Fletcher has determined the value of the B. A. unit of resistance in 
terms of the mechanical equivalent of heat, and has obtained the value 
0-9904 earth quadrants per second. The method consisted in simul- 
taneous thermal and electrical observations of the energy expended 
by an electrical current in a coil of wire immersed in a calorimeter. 
[Am. J. Sci., July, 1885, III, xxx, 22.) 

Himstedt has published the results of his determination of the ohm 
made by a method suggested by him in 1884. The constant deviations 
of a magnetic needle in the same galvanometer, produced in the one 
case by means of induction currents passing in the same direction 
through the galvanometer at the rate of n per second, and in the other 
by means of a constant current whose strength is a known fraction ol 
the inducing current, are carefully observed, and from the data thus 
obtained the resistance can be calculated. The lowest value obtained 
for the resistance of the Siemens unit was 0-94323 and the highest 
0-94380 ohm, the mean being 0-94356 ohm. Hence 1 ohm is equiva-

millimeter and a length of 105-98 centimeters at 0° centigrade. { Phil. 
Mag., November, 1885, V, xx, 417.) 

Wild gives from his measurements the number 0-94315 ohm for the 
value of 1 Siemens unit, and therefore gives 106-027 centimeters as the 
length of the mercury column representing the ohm at 0°. {Am. J. 8ci., 
February, 1885, III, xxix, 168.) 

Because of the importance of having as little heating as possible in 
all instruments for electric measurement, the question has arisen whether 
the coils of such instruments should be made of German-silver wire or 
of copper wire or partly of both, and how the diameters of the wire should 
vary in different parts of the coil. Ayrton and Perry have investigated 
the conditions that make this heating error a minimum with cylindrical 
coils of given internal and external radii, and have reached the conclu- 
sion that the wire should be of copper and that the increase of cross- 
section proceeding from the center should be x=x„ Other points in 
connection with these instruments were discussed. {Nature, July, 1885, 
XXXII, 215.) 

Fleming has constructed a standard Daniell ceil, consisting ofa U tube, 
in the two limbs of which are the two solutions of copper sulphate and 
zinc sulphate of the same specific gravity. Electrodes made of freshly 
electro deposited copper and i^ure zinc that has been twice distilled dip 
into the two limbs. The electro-motive force of this cell is 1.102 volts, 
and the variation with temperature is practically nil. The various con- 
ditions affecting the electro-motive force of this cell were carefully studied. 
{Phil. Mag., August, 1885, V, xx, 126; Nature, July, 1885, xxxii, 263.) 

Hesehus has designed an amperemeter founded on the phenomenon 
of Peltier. A thermo-electric battery of 12 iron-German silver elements, 
in the form of wires 2-3““ in diameter, is so arranged that the opposite 
junctions are contained in two vessels which form the reservoirs of a 
differential air thermometer. A current passed through the battery heats 
the even junctions and cools the uneven ones, or vice versa] and this 
causes a change of level in the thermometer proportional to the inten- 
sity of the current, eliminating the heating of the conductors. One 
division on the scale of his apparatus corresponds to 0-66 ampere. {J. 
Soc. Phys. Chim. Busse, xvi, 452 ; J. Phys., December, 1885, II, ly, 587.) 

Rosenthal has devised a galvanometer of great range and great sensi- 
tiveness, the needle of which is a horseshoe magnet suspended by a 
long fiber attached to its neutral point. The poles of the magnet are 
provided with horizontal pole pieces which are quadrantal arcs of a 
circle the center of which lies in the axis of suspension of the horseshoe. 
These pole pieces can play within the axis of two galvanometer bobbins 
placed on opposite sides of the vertical suspension plane when this 
plane coincides with the magnetic meridian. When an electric current 
passes through the coils these pole pieces are respectively drawn in or 
repelled by the two bobbins. In this way the poles of the magnet can

be brought very uear the center of the coils. Without the exterior 
magnet, deflection at a scale, distance of 2-7 meters corresponds 
to 54 X 10“*“ ampere 5 with this magnet, to 12 x 10“'“ ampere. With 
a German-silver and iron couple a difference of 10° between the junc- 
tions gave a deflection of 120““ through 1,000 ohms. {Wied. Ann., 
XXIII, 077 ; Am. J. Sci., February, 1885, III, xxix, 167.) 

• Anthony has devised a large tangent galvanometer for the laboratory- 
of Cornell University as a standard instrument for the measurement of 
heavy currents and for the direct calibration of commercial measuring 
apiiaratus. It has four circles, two of which are 2 meters in diameter 
and two are l-O meters, mounted on the plan of Von Helmholtz at dis- 
tances apart equal to their radii, and made of rods of copper 0-75 inch 
in diameter. The needle is suspended by a silk fiber and is inclosed in a 
mass of copper, which serves as an effectual damper and enables readings 
to be made very rapidly. A special arrangement of mirrors and tele- 
scoiies iiermits the reading of the deflections in angular measure on a 
circle 50 inches in diameter to within 0-3 of a minute of arc. The cop- 
per conductors are mounted on a brass framework accurately turned 
and adjusted and the dimensions are all known within one flve-thou- 
sandth part. For the measurement of currents there are two circles, each 
1-5 meters in diameter and each having two conductors, together com- 
lirising seventy-two turns of No. 12 copper wire. {Electrician and Elec- 
trical Engineer, October, 1885, iv, 372 ; Nature, October, 1885, xxxii, 034.) 

Mather has suggested the calibration of a galvanometer by a constant 
current as follows : A current is passed through its coils, and the instru- 
ment is turned through any angle and the deflection 6 noted. The 
current is broken, and the needle swings back into the meridian, pass- 
ing through an angle <^. This operation is repeated with the same cur- 
rent, thegalvanometer being in various positions; and a curve is drawn 
showing the relation between sin ^ sin 5 and the corresponding values 
of 6. When now the instrument is used in its normal position it is 
obvious that a current producing a deflection 6 of the needle is projior 
tional to the value of sin 6 -=r sin <5 corresponding to 6 obtained in the 
calibration exxjeriment ; and this value can be read off directly from the 
curve. {Nature, December, 1885, xxxiii, 166.) 

Trowbridge, while in general i)referring the electro-dynamometer in 
the form devised by him to his cosine galvanometer (described in 1871) 
for the measurement of strong currents, yet has suggested a method of 
using the latter instrument which removes most of the objections. The 
galvanometer is so mounted that its comijass is at the center of a large 
circle of wire the plane of which is vertical and in the plane of the 
needle. When the strong current is passed through the large vertical 
coil the arrangement acts as a tangent galvanometer. The movable coil 
of the cosine galvanometer is then connected with a Daniell cell of 
known electro-motive force, and in the same circuit a resistance is x)laced 
so large that the battery resistance may be neglected, and, having joined

the poles in such manner that the deflection produced by the coil of 
the cosine galvanometer shall be opposite to that ])roduced by the cur- 
rent in the large outer coil, the coil of the cosine galvanometer is in- 
clined until the compass needle is brought again to zero. In this way 
the strength of the dynamo current is obtained in terms simply of the cur- 
rent from the standard Daniell cell, and the method is independent of the 
strength of the earth’s magnetism and of the special field in which the 
instrument is placed. {Am. J. Sci.., March, 1885, III, xxix, 236 ; Phil. 
Mag.y May, 1885, V, xix, 396.) 

Cailletet and Bouty have determined the conductivity of the metals 
at very low temperatures, in baths of methyl chloride, either alone or 
mixed with carbon dioxide snow, and of liquid ethylene, the temperatures 
being determined by means of the hydrogen thermometer. They con 
elude: (1) That from 0^ to —100° the formula rt = ro (1 + a t), in which 
r„ and represent the resistance at 0° and + t the temperature, and 
a the increase-coefficient, represents the variation of resistance for the 
pure metals with sufficient exactness ; (2) that if a be determined by 
the use of a metallic spiral, the temperatures from 0° to — 100° may be 
measured by the variation of resistance of this spiral with an error of 
less than 1° ; (3) that for each metal a has a special value, which is in gen- 
eral somewhat above that of the expansion-coefficient of a gas. Hence 
the application of the formula above given leads to a zero value for the 
resistance at a temperature somewhat above —273°. It follows, there- 
fore, that at exceedingly low temperatures the variation of resistance be- 
comes less rapid. The temperatures calculated from the above formula 
consequently are, for these low temperatures, too near zero. (</. P%.s., 
.1 uly, 1885, II, IV, 297.) 

Bartoli has examined twenty-three varieties of carbon with reference 
to their electric resistance. He concludes that to be a conductor the 
carbon should not contain more than 1’2 per cent, of hydrogen, and should 
have been submitted to a temperature not below a red heat. He finds 
that an intimate mixture of twenty parts of paraffin and one of grajihite, 
by fusion, however, conducts so well that plates of it may be emifloyed 
as electrodes; and yet elementary analysis would show 14'3 jier cent, 
of hydrogen. He believes, therefore, that the conductivity of carbons 
is due exclusively to the presence in them of finely divided graphite 
intimately mixed throughout their mass. {II Nuovo Cimento, xv, 203; 
J. Phys., December, 1885, II, iv, 563.)

Edlund has contributed further experimental evidence of the position 
maintained by him, that an absolute vacuum is a good conductor and 
that the increase of resistance experienced in the ordinary tubes as the 
exhaustion proceeds is due to the development of a progressively in- 
creasing counter electro-motive force at the electrodes, a point which he 
has now rendered probable. A glass tube, 30™ long and 16““ in diam-

eter, provided with two platinum wire' electrodes, the ends being 3™“ 
apart, and with two bands of tin foil, was connected to the inercury 
pump while the terminals of an induction coil were connected alter- 
nately with the electrodes and with the tin-foil bands. When the press- 
ure in the tube was above 36““ no discharge could be observed be- 
tween the tin-foil coatings, though that between the platinum wires be- 
came very brilliant. At about 1““ a luminosity between the armatures 
was observable, which increased to 0'004““ when it was intense, the 
spark between the electrodes being feeble. At 0-00036““ the electrode 
spark appeared only occasionally, while the armature discharge was 
constant and very bright. The two discharges give exactly opposite 
results, that between the electrodes diminishing with the exhaustion 
and that between the armatures increasing with it. The author can 
explain this and other similar experiments only by the supposition 
that the resistance of the vacuum itself diminishes as the rarefaction 
increases and that there is developed simultaneously at the electrode a 
condition which hinders the passage of the electricity into the air from 
the metal. {Phil. Mag., February, 1885, V, xix, 125 ; J. Phys., June, 
1885, II, IV, 273.) 

Goldstein has made the following remarkable experiment on the proji- 
agation of electricity through a vacuum. A Geissler tube has for its 
negative electrode either a platinum loop or a carbon filament from a 
Swan lamp. By means of a battery these loops are raised to incan- 
descence, and then the discharge of an induction coil is sent into the 
tube. A shunt circuit connected with the two spherical terminals of 
a spark interrupter permits the graduation of the length of spark sent 
through the tube. Measured in this way the resistance of the Geissler 
tube is at least one hundred times less when the electrodes are heated 
to incandescence than when the cathodes are cold. The incandescence 
of the positive electrode is without influence. {Per. Ale. Wien, 1884, 
58; J. Phys., April, 1885, II, iv, 182.) 

This result appears entirely analogous with certain phenomena ob- 
served by Edison in the spring of 1884 in his incandescent lamps. Insert- 
ing a platinum electrode in the lamp, between the sides of the carbon 
loop, he noticed that when the lamp was brought up to incandescence 
a galvanometer connected on the one side to this platinum plate and on 
the other to the positive conductor, showed a deflection increasing with 
the degree of incandescence. The carbon filament was, in this case, an 
incandescent electrode as above, and the electro-motive force of the 
machine, about 110 volts, was under these conditions sufficient to cause 
a discharge through the vacuum. {Science, October, 1884, iv, 374; Na- 
ture, April, 1885, xxxi, 545.) 

Lehmanu concludes that the apparent difference of properties of 
positive and negative electrification in vacuum tubes is due entirely to 
secondary actions dependent upon the state of charge which the air 
takes in consequence of its friction against the electrodes. This elec-

triflcation thus produced is always positive, and therefore lire discharge 
is favored at the cathode aud rendered more difficult at the anode. 
Indeed, the latter is, in a certain sense, prolonged by the layer of gas, 
positively electrified, which surrounds it, and which produces the dark 
space around this electrode. In this space the discharge is couv^ective 
and continuous, becoming luminous and discontinuous only beyond it 
at a variable distance depending upon the pressure of the gas and 
upon its temperature. ( Wied. Ann., xxii, 305 ; J. Phys,, December, 
1885, II, TV, 570.) 

Naccari and Guglielmo have continued their investigations on the 
heating of the electrodes produced by the induction spark in I'arefled 
air. They had previously shown that for pressures of air above 10”™ 
the negative electrode heated more than the positive in the ratio of 1 
to between 2 and 4. For lower pressures they now show that this ratio 
increases slowly up to a pressure of 5“”, more rapidly from 5 to l-2“™, and 
very rapidly up to a pressure of 0’27™™, when it reaches a maximum 
value of 28. It then decreases, and for the lowest pressures obtainable 
is reversed and becomes less than 1. {J. Phys., December, 1885, II, iv, 
561.) 

Ayrton and Perry have communicated to the Physical Society of 
London a paper on the most economical potential difference to employ 
with Edison incandescent lamps. They point out the fact that it is not 
sufficient to know that when a lamp is giving out a certain number of 
candles it absorbs so much power per candle, and when giving out a 
much larger number of candles it absorbs so much less power per can- 
dle. What must be known in addition is the life of the lamp at each 
of these two candle-powers before we can decide upon the most economi- 
cal temperature for it ; since if the efficiency is low at low temperatures, 
the life is great, aud at high temperatures the larger efficiency will be 
balanced somewhat by its short life. From a curve given by calcula- 
tion, and assuming the cost of the lamp 5s., the number of hours of burn- 
ing per year 560, aud the cost of one electric horse-power for this lime 
as £5, the authors show that the minimum cost per candle per year is 
lid., and is obtained with a potential value of 101-4 volts, the cost ris- 
ing to Is. per year if the potential falls to 98-7 or rises to 104 volts. 
{Phil. Mag., April, 1885, V, xix, .304; Nature, March, 1885, xxxi, 450.) 

Fleming has made extended investigations into the phenomena of 
incandescent lamps with special reference to their efficiency. From 
statistics concerning the life, resistance, efficiency, and potential differ- 
ence of such lamps he has constructed empirical equations showing the 
mutual relations of these variables. A curve showing the relation of 
any one of these to any other is called a characteristic curve for that 
lamp. His results confirmed the law formulated by Ayrton and Perry, 
that for a certain class of lamps {i. e. the Edison) the potential difference, 
minus a constant, varies as the cube root of the efficiency, the latter 
quantity being measured in candles per horse-power. The constant 


632 


SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1885. 


which in the lami)s examined is about 28-7, is nearly the potential dif- 
ference at which the lamps begin to emiwight. Hence the law may be 
stated as follows : The effective potential difference varies as the cube 
root of the efficiency. (Phil. Mag., May, 1885, V, xix, 368; Nature, 
April, 1885, xxxi, 522.) 

Fleming has further studied the phenomenon of molecular shadows 
in Edison incandescent lamps. In his earlier experiments he suggested 
the similarity of the phenomenon in question to those observed in high 
vacua by Crookes, the surface of the glass being coated with a deposit 
of carbon, with the exception of a clear line marking the intersection of 
the glass with the ijlane of the loop, and being in fact a shadow of the 
loop, apparently caused by the emission of matter from the terminals. 

The author has now succeeded in producing this phenomenon at will by 
passing a very strong current momentarily through a lamp, and has 
I^roduced similar deposits of various metals used as electrodes. These 
deposits show colors by transmitted light, and, as a general result, he 
concludes that red metals, such a gold and copper, appear green by 
transmitted light, whereas white metals, like silver and platinum, ap- .j 
pear brown. This result is obviously of the same character as that ob- 
tained by Wright. — Am. J. Sci., 1877, III, xin, 49; xiv, 169. {Phil.

GENERAL AND PHYSICAL. 

Present Aspects of the Theory of Chemical Action. — In his presidential 
address to the chemical section of the British Association for the Ad- 
vancement of Science, at the Aberdeen meeting, Prof. Henry E. Arm- 
strong considered, among other things, the present aspects of the theory 
of chemical action. He said ; Chemical action may be defined as being 
any action of wiiich the consequence is an alteration in molecular con- 
stitution or composition; the action may concern molecules which are 
of only one kind — cases of mere decomposition, of isomeric change, and 
of polymerization; or it may take place between dissimilar molecules 
— cases of combination and of interqhange. Hitherto it appears to 
have been commonly assumed and almost univ^ersally taught hy chemists 
that action takes place directly between A and B, producing AB, or 
between AB and CD, producing AO and BD, for example. This, at all 
events, is the impression which the average student gains. Our text 
books do not, in fact, as a rule deign to notice observations of such 
fundamental importance as those of De La Eive on the behavior of 
nearly pure zinc with dilute sulphuric acid, or the later ones of Faraday 
[Exp. Researches, Series vii, 1834, 863 et seq.) on the insolubility of 
amalgamated zinc in this acid. Belief in the equation Zn+HaSO.^^ 
H 2 +ZnS 04 , hence, becomes a part of the chemist’s creed, and it is 
generally interpreted to mean that zinc will dissolve in sulphuric acid 
forming zinc sulphate, not, as should be the case, that when zinc dis- 
solves in sulphuric acid it produces zinc sulphate, &c. 

In studyiug the chemistry of carbon compounds we become ac- 
quainted with alarge number of instances in which a more or less minute 
quantity of a substance is capable of inducing change in the body or 
bodies with which i t is associated without apparently itself being altered. 
The polymerization of a number of cyanogen compounds and of alde- 
hydes, the “condensation” of ketooic compounds and the hydrolysis of 
carbohydrates are cases in point, but so little has been done to ascertain

the nature of the influence of the contact-substance, or catalyst, as 1 
would term it, the main object in view being the study of the product 
of the reaction, that the importance of the catalyst is not duly appre- 
ciated. Eecent discoveries, however — more particularly Mr. H. B. 
Dixon’s invaluable investigation on conditions of chemical change in 
gases, and the experiments of Mr. Cowper with chlorine and various 
metals, and of Mr. Baker on the combustion of carbon and phosphorus — 
must have given a rude shock, from which it can never recover, to the 
belief in the assumed simplicity of chemical change. The inference 
which I think may be fairly drawn from Mr. Baker’s observations — 
that pure carbon and phosphorus are incombustible in pure oxygen — is 
indeed startling, and his experiments must do much to favor that “ more 
minute study of the simpler chemical phenomena” so pertinently ad- 
vocated by Lord Eayleigh. (See Presidential Address to the B. A. A. 
S., at the meeting of 1884.) 

* But if it be a logical conclusion from the cases now known to us, that 
chemical action is not possible between any two substances other than 
elementary atoms, and that the presence of a third is necessary, what 
is the function of the third body, the catalyst, and what must be its 
character with reference to one or both of the two primary agents? In 
the discussion which took place at the chemical society after the read- 
ing of Mr. Baker’s paper, I ventured to define chemical action as re- 
versed electrolysis, stating that in any case in which chemical action was 
to take place, it was essential that the system operated upon should 
contain a material of the nature of an electrolyte {Chem. 8oc. Proc., 1885, 
p. 40). In short, I believe that the conditions which obtain in any vol- 
taic element are those which must be fulfilled in every case of chemical 
action. There is nothing new in this; in fact it was stated by Faraday 
in 1848 {Exp. Researches, series vii, § 858 and § 859) ; and had due heed 
been given to Faraday’s teaching, we should scarcely now be so ignorant 
of the conditions of chemical change. {Chem. News, Lii, 135.) 

Suggestions as to the Cause of the Periodic Law and the Nature of the 
Chemical Elements. (By Prof. Thomas Carnelley.) — The truth of the pe- 
riodic law of the chemical elements is now generally allowed by most 
chemists. Nevertheless, but little has been done towards attaining a 
reasonable explanation of the law. This prompts the author to ofl^er a 
few suggestions on this subject. Even long before the discovery of the 
periodic law many chemists had pointed out certain numerical relation- 
shii)e existing between the atomic weights of bodies belonging to a given 
group, and had, hence, supposed that the elements belonging to the sev- 
eral natural groups were not primary, but were made up of two or more 
simpler elements. These conclusions, however, were more or less frag- 
mentary and referred only to jiarticular groups of elements. In the 
light of the periodic law the author has made a general extension of tlie 
fragmentary conclusions of Dumas, and has brought that law into jux-

taposition with an extended generalization of the analogy of the ele- 
ments with the hydrocarbon radicals. A careful consideration of the 
relations between certain physical properties and the atomic weights of 
the elements leads almost irresistibly to the conclusion that the ele- 
ments are analogous to the hydrocarbon radicals in both form and func- 
tion. This is a conclusion which if true would further lead us to infer 
that the elements are not elements in the strict sense of the term, but 
are built up of (at least) two primary elements, A (=carbon at. wt. 12) 
and B (aether, at. wt.— 2), which by their combination produce a series 
of compounds (viz, our present elements) analogous to the hydrocarbon 
radicals. If this theory be true the periodic law follows as a matter of 
course, and we should therefore be able to represent the elements by 
some such general formula as A.n B 2n-\-{2—x), analogous to that for the 
hydrocarbon radicals C„H 2 „+( 2 _^) in which n=the series and x the grou}) 
to which the element or hydrocarbon radical belongs. Assuming the 
truth of the theory here advanced, it is interesting to observe that 
whereas the hydrocarbons are compounds of hydrogen and carbon, the 
chemical elements would be composed of carbon with aether, the two 
sets of bodies being generated in an exactly analogous manner from 
their respective elements. There would, hence, be three primitive ele- 
ments, viz, carbon, hydrogen, and aether. Finally, this theory would re- 
move the chief objections which have been urged against the periodic 
law, whilst the existence of elements of identical atomic weights and 
isomeric with one another would be possible. May not Ni and Co, Eu 
and Eh, Os and Ir, and some of the rare earth metals be isomers in this 
sense? (Eeport B. A. A. S. in Nature, xxxii, 539.) 

Relations between the Atomic Weights and the Physiological Functions of 
the Elements (by Fausto Sestini). — A study of the following table con- 
taining the elements entering into the formation of the organic matter 
of plants, shows that no element having an atomic weight higher than 66 
takes a direct part in producing organic bodies : 

Indispensable. Useful. 

Electro-negative { ’ ' \ Si=28; 01=35-5. 

Electro-positive j Mg=24; K=39; ♦ ^^^=23; Mn=55. 

^ \ Ca=40;Fe=56 f ’ 

Among the remaining elements of the first four groups of the periodic 
system which occur in the ashes of certain plants are Al=27-3 in 
lycopodium and equisetum, Li=7 in tobacco and vines, Fl=19 in 
many higher plants, Cu=63, Zn=65, and Br (also I) in algae. The 
elements following copper up to uranium act like poison upon plants 
and animals. The soluble compounds of most of the elements having 
higher atomic weights than 56 coagulate albumen, exert a very injurious 
inilueuce on animals, and act to a certain extent as antiseptics. {Qaz^, 
chim. italiana, xv, 107.)

SCIENTIFIC KECOKIJ FOK 1885. 


On the Unit used in Calculating the Atomic Weights (by Lothar Meyer 
ami Karl Seubert). — The controversy arising immediately after the pro- 
posal of Dalton’s atomic theory, as to the unit upon which the numerical 
values of the atomic weight should be based has for half a century 
divided chemists into two schools. While. Dalton and, later, Leopold 
Gmelin, from theoretical and philosojihical considerations, chose the 
smallest atomic weight, that of hydrogen, as the measure of all the rest, 
Wollaston and Berzelius chose that of oxygen, partly because they did 
not place so high a value on theoretical views, and partly on the purely 
practical ground that many elements can be compared directly with 
oxygen, whereas they can be only indirectly compared with hydrogen. 
When the Dalton unit, the hydrogen atom, graduallj^ obtained the 
upper hand, the old controversy appeared to have been laid aside, and 
consequently it was to be hoped that the recent more exact investiga- 
tions of the laws which govern the numerical values of the atomic 
weights would be directed from the same point of view. This hope, 
however, has unfortunately not been fulfilled, as the old Wollaston- 
Berzelius unit has lately again come into use in a different — and as we 
believe — more dangerous form. 

As is well known, J. S. Stas has from his own observation as well as 
those of others deduced as the most highly probable result that the 
atomic weight of oxygen is not quite sixteen times as great as that of 
hydrogen, but on the contrary is about its value less than 16 H. 

That is when H=l, 0=lo-9G. Many chemists, however, content them- 
selves with numerical values founded on the more simple ratio of 
H: 0=1 ; 16, regarding the difference of as of very little practical 
consideration. And the hoi)e that the old controversy over the choice 
of the unit would disappear upon a, recalculation of the atomic weights 
has unfortunately not been fulfilled. The desire to do away with the 
unit 0=100 is universal; all chemists prefer referring atomic weights 
to hydrogen, but they do not agree as to the way in which this is to be 
done. Some refer all atomic weights to 0=16, when H = 1-0023, and 
others to H=l. In consequence of these different views all the other 
atomic weights fluctuate to the extent of about per cent, of their 
value, a very undesirable state of affairs, leading to confusion and per- 
plexity. The authors maintain that the real cause prompting the 
adoption of 0=16 is a secret fondness for Prout’s hypothesis. 

The authors admit that the error introduced by making 0=16 is mucli 
smaller than the unavoidable errors of observation so far as inorganic 
compounds are concerned, but they show that in the analysis of organic 
compounds it is quite otherwise. From a table showing the percentages 
of hydrogen and carbon in the paraffins containing 30 and 31 carbon 
atoms and their derived alcohols and acids, it is evident that the vari- 
ations in the calculated percentages of carbon dioxide reach the tenths 
of a per cent., a difference often greater than that obtained from two 
adjacent hydrocarbons in a homologous series.

With the aid of a second table, in which calculations are made on 
the two suppositions that 0=16, and. 0=15-96, the authors show that 
according to the former a given analysis would lead to the formula 
C 25 H 52 , but according to the latter the formula would be C 27 H 56 . Of 
course in such a case no one would determine the formula by analysis 
alone. In conclusion, the authors say: ‘‘We are all convinced that the 
f relation under consideration (and thereby every other atomic weight re- 
ferred toH=l) is not accurate to the thousandth part of its value. 
Let us accept it without artificial interpretations and wait till the future 
for its further proof and confirmation by experimental methods.” {Ber. 
d. chem. Ges., xvm, 1089, and Am. Cliem. J., vil, 96.) 

Proufs Hypothesis and the Atomic Weight of Silver (by Lothar Meyer 
and K. Seubert). — The calculation of the atomic weights of many of the 
elements depends, as is well known, upon that of silver, so that the 
sharpest possible determination of this is desirable in order to obtain 
accurate results, without which a discussion of Front’s hypothesis, as 
far as this is concerned with facts, is unprofitable. For this reason J. 
S. Stas, in his masterly investigations, used the utmost care in determin- 
ing the stoichiometrical relations between silver and oxygen. Dumas, 
in 1878, showed that oxygen was contained in pure silver which had 
been fused with borax and saltpeter. The authors have studied the in- 
fluence which the slight percentage of oxygen may have exerted on 
Stas’ silver determinations, and conclude that the latter were not ap- 
preciably influenced by the occluded oxygen. The authors maintain 
that the most accurate determinations of atomic weights of the elements 
all contradict Front’s hypothesis in its characteristic original concep- 
tion; it must therefore be looked upon as having been disproved by 
experiment. {Ber. d. chem. Ges. xviii, 1098, and J.w. Chem. J., vn, 104.)

Physical Conditions Dependent upon Temperature . — The experiments of 
French and of Eussian chemists in liquefaction of gases, and the ex- 
traordinary temperatures obtained, excite so much interest that we here 
transcribe a somewhat extended table of temperatures with attendant 
phenomena. The table was compiled by Mr. J. J. Coleman, and pre- 
sented by him to the Philosophical Society of Glasgow, March 18, 1885, 
in connection with his paper on the “Liquefaction of Gases, and other 
Effects of Extreme Cold.” (See Chem. News, Li, 174.)

Anomalies in the Boiling Points of the Chloroaceto-nitrils and their 
Derivatives (by Hermann Bauer). — As a rule the replacement of hydro- 
gen by chlorine or by oxygen lowers the volatility of organic compounds 
not inconsiderably, but in certain cases an opposite effect results. Such 
an Abnormal effect is especially noticed in cyanogen compounds, the vola- 
tility of which is usually increased by the introduction into the molecule 
of negative radicals, and this occurs even when the molecular weight is

greatly increased. Chlorocyanogen and, dicyanogen, for example, are 
more volatile than hydrocyanic acid : 

H— ON boils at +26° 

Cl— ON boils at 4-15° 

NO— ON boils at —21° 

and cyanethyl boils at 96°, higher than cyanacetyl, which boils at 0. 
The chloronitrils exhibit similar peculiarities. These and similar facts 
prompted the author to examine the influence on the boiling point 
of introducing atomic groups in the place of the chlorine in those bodies 
in which the chlorine itself produces no change or marked change in the 
Tolatility. To this end the author prepared the four nitrils named 
below ; their formula, and boiling points compared with trichloraceto- 
nitril, are given in the table :

Whence it appears that the replacement of chlorine by methoxyl 
raises the boiling point 64°, and beyond this the boiling point increases 
with each addition of the carbon group in about the same raNo as in 
homologous compounds of like character.

It is evident that an exchange of chlorine methoxyl in many cases 
produces no change in the boiling point, and in some instances chlorine 
is equivalent to the ethoxyl group. This is true of the bodies prepared 
by the author; when once the atom of chlorine is replaced by ethoxyl 
the exchange of a second atom does not further influence the boiling 
point. {lAebigh Annalen, ccxxix, 163.) 

Eadiant-Matter- Spectroscopy ; Sama/rium. — Mr. William Crookes has 
continued his remarkable researches in the entirely original field of 
radiant-matter-spectroscopy. The results obtained as respects yttrium 
were noticed in our report for 1883. In a paper read before the Eoyal 
Society June 18, 1885, Mr. Crookes details the results of a ‘study of the 
beautiful spectrum characterized by a strong red and a double orange 
band, and which proves to be peculiar to samarium. 

This double Orange band spectrum was first observed by him in 1881, 
and his laborious researches have been uninterruptedly pursued since 
that date; the extreme sensitiveness of the new method of testing acted 
as a drawback rather than a help, except that the persistency of the 
phenomena observed increased confidence in its reliability. To the in- 
experienced eye one part of the “orange band” substance in ten thou- 
sand gives as good an indication as one part in ten, and by far the

greater part of the chemical work undertaken in the hunt for the spec- 
trum-forming element was performed upon material which later knowl- 
edge showed did not contain sufficient to respond to any known chem- 
ical test. Except in few instances, as water analysis and the detection 
of poisons, chemistry takes little account of traces, and when an anal- 
ysis adds up to 99'99 the odd 0*01 per cent, is conveniently put down 
to “impurities,” “loss,” or “errors of analysis.” When however the 
99-99 per cent, constitutes the impurity and this exiguous error 0-01 is 
the precious material to be extracted, and when, moreover, its chemistry 
is absolutely unknown, the difficulties of the problem become enor- 
mously enhanced. The author was therefore obliged to build up a new 
chemistry, and after six months’ work he obtained the earth didymia in 
a state which most chemists would call absolutely pure, for it probably 
contained not more than one part of impurity in 500,000 of didymia. 
But this one part in half a million, profoundly affected the character of 
didymia from a radiant matter-spectroscopic point of view, and the per- 
sistence of this very minute quantity of interfering impurity entailed 
another six months’ extra labor to eliminate these final traces, and to 
ascertain the real reaction of didymia pure and simple. The earth form- 
erly called didymia proved to be a mixture of didymia and samaria. 
During the long process of purification the 1,000 grams dwindled away 
bit by bit until less than one-half a gram remained of the pure material. 
Didymia thus purified shows no trace of the orange double band, which 
is characteristic of samarium, an element discovered in 1879 by Lecoq 
de Boisbaudran. 

The earths ceria, lanthania, didymia, and samaria possess in their 
purest state the following characters: Ceric oxide is almost pure white; 
in strong solution it has no absorption spectrum. The atomic weight 
of the metal was taken and found to be 141-1. Ceria gives no orange 
band spectrum in the radiant-matter tube. Lanthana is snow white, 
and the metal was found to have an atomic weight of 138-3. It gives 
no orange band spectrtim when absolutely free from samaria. Samaria 
is white, with the faintest possible tinge of yellow; its absorption spec- 
trum is much more feeble than the spectrum of didymium. Pure 
samaric sulphate by itself gives a very feeble phosphorescent spectrum. 
When however the samaria is mixed with lime before examination in 
the radiant-matter tube, the spectrum is very beautiful, consisting es- 
sentially of three bright bands — red, orange, and green — these being 
nearly equidistant, and the orange being the brightest. With a nar- 
rower slit the orange and green bands are seen to be double, with 
faint wings. 

The spectrum of samaria becomes highly modified by mixing with 
the earth other metallic oxides. Mr. Crookes divides these modified 
spectra into three groups; for particulars of each, with diagrams of 
each type, we refer to the original paper. In a mixture of samaria and 
yttria the former possesses a remarkable power of obliterating the spec- 


CHEMISTEY. 


647 


trum of tlie latter; this holds even in a mixture of 43 parts samaria 
and 57 parts yttria. The delicacy of the spectrum test 
is extraordinary; a mixture of 1 part ot samarium with 1,000,000 parts 
of calcium still exhibits a feeble spectrum of samarium ; in a mixture of 
1 to 2 500,000 parts the spectrum of samarium is nearly imperceptible. 

A striking feature in the spectra of various mixtures of samana and 

yttria is a brilliant and sharp orange line ^^2693. So long as this bright 

line is a component of the spectrum the other bands manifest decidedly 
less intensity, and many of them are suppressed. The profound modi- 
fication in the spectra of samaria and yttria developed by their mixture 
18 undoubtedly without precedent in spectrum analysis. Mr. Crookes 
remarks in conclusion that the many anomalies unearthed m these re- 
searches teach that inferences drawn from spectrum analysis per se are 
liable to grave doubt, unless at every step the spectroscopist goes hand 
in hand with the chemist. Spectroscopy may give valuable indications, 
but chemistry must after aU be the court of final appeal. {Chem. News, 
LI, 301.) 

A New Kind of Metallic Spectra; Possible New Elements.— At the 
meeting of the French Academy of Sciences on June 8, 1885, M. Lecoq 
de Boisbaudran requested that a sealed packet which he had deposited 
June 30, 1884, might be opened. The packet was opened by the per- 
manent secretary during the meeting and contained a note of which 
the following is a condensation. When the electric spectrum of a solu- 
tion with a metallic base is produced, it is customary to make the outside 
Dlatinum wire (whence the induction spark strikes) positive, the liquid 
consequently forming the negative pole. If the direction of the current 
be reversed, the metallic rays, due to the free metal or to one of its com- 
pounds, are scarcely visible or quite invisible, at all events so long as 
the exterior platinum wire now forming the negative pole is not coated 
with a deposit. In examining the rare earths belonging to the didymium 
and yttrium family, the writer observed with many of the preparations 
the formation of spectrum bands, nebulous but sometimes tolerably 
brilliant, having their origin in a thin layer of a beautiful green co or, 
which was seen to appear at the surface of the liquid (a solution of a 
chloride) when it was rendered positive. The principal bands ^ 
in number, situated as follows : A620^, A585f, A573, A543i, M87, A47 J; 
some of these are nebulous and broad. That at 543^ is probably no 
due to any known element, unless it proves to be due to holmium. ihat 
at 573 is also probably due to a new element. The latter yet unisolated 
body the author designates provisionally by Za, and the former oj^p. 

M. Lecoq de Boisbaudran regards his “ reversion spectrum” as p ys- 
ically analogous to the phosphorescent spectra obtained by Mr. Crookes 
at the positive pole in his high vacuum tubes containing certain com- 
pounds of yttria. [See our Eeport for 1883.] 


648 


SCIENTinC EECOKD FOE 1885. 


To this note in the sealed packet the French chemist added the fol- 
lowing : “ I have not yet finished the very long work undertaken in the 
hope of determining the nature of the above-described phosphorescent 
spectrum. This spectrum is now recognized as identical with that as- 
cribed to pure yttria by Mr. Crookes, and which this savant obtained 
under experimental conditions very difterent from mine. Nevertheless, 
my latest observations lead to the conclusion that yttria is not the 
cause of the spectrum bands observed. In my fractionations the phos- 
phorescence spectrum regularly gets weaker as I advance towards the 
yttria end. With almost pure yttria the phosphorescence bands show 
themselves faintly or not at all, while they are brilliant with the earths 
which do not give, by the direct spark, the rays of yttrium to an ap- 
preciable extent. The prodigious sensitiveness of Mr. Crookes’ reac- 
tion, which detects a millionth part of his purified yttria, makes very 
singular this divergence which I am obliged to point out between the 
conclusions of the eminent English chemist and myself.” - - - “I 
should acknowledge here that Mr. Crookes was the first to see the 
phosphorescence spectrum of samarium.” {Comptes rendus, c, 1437, 
and Chem. News, lii, 4.) , 

Quantitative Determination of Lithium by the Spectroscope. — L. Bell has 
found the following method gives good results : A standard solution was 
made from lithium carbonate converted to the chloride, containing 
.0265™8“ of Li20 per cubic centimeter. Of this 10®® were taken, diluted 
till the spectral line was just on the point of vanishing and the vol- 
ume noted. Then the solution to be estimated was diluted to the same 
point and its volume compared with that of the standard, when a sim- 
ple proportion gave the amount of LiaO present. A very small loop of 
platinum wire should be used and applied to the same part of the Bun- 
sen flaine. The method is applicable to the analysis of lithium miner- 
als, and examples are given. The method is useful also in case of 
thallium and such other elements as give distinct lines in the spectro- 
scope. {Am. Chem. J., Vll, 35.) 

Action of Light on Iodoform in Solution. — E. Fabini has observed that 
a solution of iodoform in benzine becomes bright red when exposed to di- 
rect sunlight for ten to twenty minutes, whereas in the dark it remains 
colorless. If a solution prepared in the dark is suddenly exposed to 
the rays of the sun it immediately turns to a splendid red color, and 
iodine is precipitated. Further experiments with solutions of iodoform 
in ether and in oils shows it to be very sensitive to light, being thereby 
reduced. {Pharmaceutische Post.) 

On the Action of Light in Chemical Bectctions (by D. Amato). — The 
author, in studying the action of light and of heat in chemical re- 
actions, has obtained results of great interest ; he shows that many of 
the decompositions and combinations attributed to the action of light 


CHEMISTEY. 


649 


exclusively are in reality due to light and heat, or to the latter agent 
only. The decomposition of liquid phosphine is generally attributed 
to light, but the author shows that it can be exposed to direct sunlight 
at 10° without a trace of decomposition. Heat alone without light is 
inactive. 

A mixture of chlorine and hydrogen can be exposed with impunity 
to sunlight if cooled to —12° 0.; a temperature of 29° is not able to 
effect combination of the gases without sunlight. Chloride of silver 
requires both heat and light for its decomposition, and Fehling’s solu- 
tion is not chauged by light alone j if organic dust be excluded the 
solution will keep indefinitely when exposed to full sunlight. ( Oazetta 
chimica italiana, xiv, 57.) 

INOEGANIC. 

Manufacture of Oxygen and of Ammonia from the Atmosphere. — The 
well-known process of extracting oxygen from the atmosphere by 
means of baryta has never been a commercial success, because after 
a while the baryta becomes inactive, owing probably to its absorption 
of carbonic acid frbm the air. At the “ Inventions Exhibition,” held 
during the summer months in London, the brothers Brin exhibited an 
improvement on the old process which promises to be very valuable. 
Tlie air is freed from carbonic acid and water by caustic soda and then 
passed over barium oxide, heated to a temperature not above 600° C., 
in iron retorts. The temperature is regulated by a pyrometer, which 
controls also the supply of gas to the furnace. Under these conditions 
the oxygen of the air is absorbed by the baryta, barium peroxide being 
formed. The nitrogen which appears to be very pure is collected 
separately for use in the production of ammonia. On heating the 
peroxide of barium to full redness pure oxygen is given OS'. At this 
stage of the process powerful pumps are set in operation and make a 
partial vacuum in the retorts. The operations are continuous, and so 
long as the baryta is kept anhydrous and free from carbonic acid the 
same quantity will apparently last an indefinite time. The most inter- 
esting and perhaps the most useful part of the invention of the Brin 
Brothers is the production of ammonia by a very direct process. The 
nitrogen obtained as above and moistened by passing through water, 
is passed over a mixture of baryta, with charcoal heated to about 300° 
0. Carbonate of ammonia is thus obtained, the water being decom- 
posed under the conditions named, its hydrogen combining with the 
nitrogen and its oxygen with the carbon. The ammonium compound is 
formed in considerable amount. {Nature., xxxtt , 354.) 

Solid Nitrogen; Lowest Known Temperatures. — K. Olszewski in a 
previous memoir describes apparatus for obtaining very low tempera- 
tures by means of oxygen and of air evaporating in a vacuum. In a 
subsequent series of experiments the author has further introduced into

his apparatus a second tube of very, thin glass, and thus isolates the 
liquefied gases by a double gaseous stratum. The pressure and the 
temperature being greatly lowered he has been able to solidify nitro- 
gen, carbon monoxide, formene, and nitrogen dioxide, and to determine 
at the same time the temperatures of solidification. Nitrogen solidifies 
at — 214° under a jjressure of 60 atmospheres ; carbon monoxide at — 
207° under 100“™ pressure; formene at — 185°-8 under 80““ pressure; 
and nitrogen dioxide at — 167° under 138““ pressure. The latter forms 
a colorless liquid. By reducing the pressure of solid nitrogen down to 
4““ of mercury he has succeeded in obtaining the lowest temperature 
known, — 225° C. ( — 373° F.). Comptes rendus, c: 350 and 940. 

Separation of Liquefied Air into Two Distinct Liquids (by S. Wrob- 
lewski). — The laws of the liquefaction of air are not those of the liquefac- 
tion of a simple gas. If at first sight air presents itself in such a man- 
ner that it is permissible to speak of the critical point of air, this de- 
pends merely on the slight difference which exists betweefi the curves 
of tension of watery vapor, of oxygen and of nitrogen. The author 
obtained air as two distinct liquids separated by a perfectly visible me- 
niscus, as follows: After having liquefied at —-142° a quantity of air in 
the tube of his apparatus, he allows such a quantity of gaseous air to 
enter the tube that the pressure of the gas is equal to 40 atifiospheres and 
its optical density eq^ual to that of the liquid. The meniscus of the liquid 
disappears entirely. He then slowly diminishes the pressure, and at 
the moment when the gauge shows a pressure of 37-6 atmospheres a new 
meniscus appears at a point of the tube much higher than that occupied 
by the meniscus that has disappeared. A few moments afterward the 
old meniscus returns to the point where it disappeared, and at this mo- 
ment two liquids are distinctlj’^ recognized and remain separate for some 
seconds. The lower liquid contains 21.28 vols. per cent, of oxygen, and 
the upper 17*3 to 18'7 per cent. {Comptes rendus, ci. No. 13.) 

Solutions of Ozone and the Chemical Action of Liquid Oxygen. — At the 
Aberdeen meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of 
Science, Professor Dewar gave a description of the apparatus and 
method employed by him in the liquefaction of snch gases as oxygen, 
&c., and after discussing the conditions required for the successful con- 
version into the liquid of the gases formerly called permanent, he gave 
an account of some experiments with liquid oxygen. At —130° liquid 
oxygen loses the active characters possessed by this element in the 
gaseous state; it is without action on phosphorus, sodium, potassium, 
solid sulphuretted hydrogen, and solid hydriodic acid. At very low 
temperatures other substances are similarly without action on each 
other; thus liquid ethylene and solid bromine may be brought in contact 
without any action taking place, whereas gaseous ethylene and liq^uid 
bromine unite directly at the ordinary temperatures. 


CHEMISTKY.

Hantefeuille and Ohapuis, by subjecting a mixture of carbonic anhy- 
dride and ozone to great pressure, obtained a blue liquid, the color of 
which is due to ozone. If ozonized air be passed into carbon disulphide 
at —100° the liquid assumes a blue color, which disappears if the tem- 
perature be allowed to rise, and at a certain point a decomposition, re- 
sulting in the production of sulphur, takes place. The best solvent 
for ozone is a mixture of silicon tetrafluoride and Eussian petroleum. 
These solutions of ozone are without action on metallic mercury and 
silver. {Nature, xxxii, 540.) 

Combustion in Dried Gases (by H. Brereton Baker). — It will be remem- 
bered that, in 1880, Mr. H. B. Dixon demonstrated that carbon mo- 
noxide and oxygen, if perfectly pure and absolutely dry, do not unite 
when subjected to the electric spark, but that the introduction of a lit- 
tle moisture causes an explosion. Led by these experiments, Mr. Baker 
has investigated the question whether moisture is necessary for the com- 
bustion of carbon and of phosphorus in oxygen. The purified mate- 
rials were sealed up in bent hard-glass tubes with oxygen and phos- 
phoric anhydride. At intervals of one, two, four, up to sixteen weeks 
the contents of the tubes were heated and the character of the combus- 
tion compared with that of the same elements in moist oxygen. The re- 
sults showed that the burning of carbon is much retarded by drying 
the oxygen to the extent possible with the arrangement adopted by the 
author. {Chem. N'ews, 150.) 

On the Function of Water in the Combustion of Carbon Monoxide (by 
Moritz Traube). — As stated in the preceding section, Mr. Dixon proved 
that a mixture of perfectly dry carbon monoxide and oxygen is not ex- 
ploded by the passage of electric sparks, and that the presence of a 
minute quantity of water suffices to determine the combination of the 
gases. Dixon supposed that the action of the water could be repre- 
sented thus : 

(1) CO-f H20=C02H-H2 

(2) 2 H 2 -I- 02=2H20. 

Moritz Traube confirms Dixon’s experiments and goes further. He 
shows that afiame of carbon monoxide is extinguished when introduced 
into a perfectly dry atmosphere or into dry oxygen. On the other 
hand, he finds that carbon monoxide does not decompose 'water in com- 
plete absence of air or oyxgen ; and secondly, that when moist carbon 
monoxide and oxygen are exploded together, hydrogen peroxide is an 
invariable product. Consequently, Dixon’s equations do not correctly 
represent the action, and Traube suggests the following : 

(1) C0-l-2H20+02=C0(0H)2-fH202 

(2) C0-fH202=C0(0H)2 

(3) 2CO(OH)2=2C02-f2H20. 

When hydrogen is burned in moist oxygen, hydrogen peroxide always 
forms. Whether a perfectly dry mixture of hydrogen and oxygen 


652 


SCIENTIFIC EECORD FOR 1885. 


could or could not be exploded by electric sparks cannot be regarded 
as settled; the author thinks that such a mixture would prove to be 
non-explosible. He regards the mutual action of hydrogen, oxygen, 
and water as in all respects comparable with that of carbon monoxide, 
oxygen, and water, or with that of zinc, oxygen, and water. The changes 
which occur in the explosion of moist hydrogen and oxygen are thus 
formulated : 

(1) H2 + 2H20+ 02=2H20 + H202 

(2) H202-j-H2=2H20 

The second reaction has been experimentally demonstrated by the 
author. {Ber. d. chem. Oes., xvill, 1890.) 

Indications of the JExistence of an Allotropic Modification of Nitrogen 
and Synthesis of Ammonia.-— Undev this title George Stillingfleet John- 
son has published a pamphlet of theoretical and practical interest. He 
reviews the experiments of Donkin, Berthelot, D6h6rain, and Maquenne, 
P. and A. Th6nard, and H. St. Clair Deville, showing the production of 
ammonia and of its salts by the action of the silent discharge, or of 
electric sparks upon mixtures of atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen, of 
watery vapor and nitrogen gas, and of hydrogen, nitrogen, and hydro- 
chloric acid. Mr. Johnson then repeats some of his earlier experiments 
on the synthesis of ammonia, and after carefully eliminating sources of 
error obtains results which lead him to infer that, the gas evolved from 
hot solutions of ammonium nitrite contains an allotropic or active form 
of nitrogen, which differs from ordinary nitrogen in possessing the prop- 
erty of forming ammonia by direct synthesis with hydrogen in presence 
of heated spongy platinum, and which is converted into ordinary in- 
active nitrogen by the action of heat, precisely as ozone is converted 
into ordinary oxygen by the same agency. 

In experimenting with atmospheric nitrogen the author failed to ob- 
tain ammonia by passing the nitrogen, recently heated and mixed with 
hydrogen through red-hot tubes in the presence of platinum sponge. 
But he did obtain ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen which had not 
been heated. 

One of the most important experiments is thus described : Into an 
ordinary eudiometer tube full of mercury, pure nitrogen gas, obtained 
by any method, is introduced and measured. Next admit three times 
its volume of pure hydrogen gas and introduce into the gaseous mixt- 
ure a fragment of wood charcoal previously ignited in hydrogen gas, 
or better, in a mixture of three volumes of hydrogen with one volume 
of nitrogen gas. Now pass the spark continuously through the wires 
of the eudiometer. About 4 to 6 c. c. of the mixture are combined and 
absorbed by the charcoal per hour, until finally the whole of the gas 
may be made to disappear; after which, if the charcoal be removed, it 
will be found impregnated with ammonia. {Chem. News, Ln, 34.)

Reduction of Carbon Dioxide to Carbon Monoxide by means of Charcoal 
(by Alexander Naumann and Carl Pistor). — Water-gas, formed by pass- 
ing steam over incandescent charcoal, contains, besides hydrogen and 
carbon monoxide, varying quantities of carbon dioxide, which is a hin- 
drance to the economic uses of the water-gas. In the following research 
the authors examined the chemical reactions which take place under va- 
rying temperatures, and with different quantities of charcoal. The tem- 
peratures were determined by inserting in the heated tube (combustion 
tubing 82 centimeters long) substances having well-established melting 
points, such as lead chloride (501°), silver pyrophosphate (585°), silver 
(954°), &c. 

Experiments determine that the lowest temperature at which the re- 
duction of carbon dioxide to monoxide by charcoal begins lies between 
530° and 685°, say 550°, provided the gas be passed not too rapidly 
and the charcoal layer be 66 centimeters long. 

With a charcoal layer only 10 centimeters long a much higher temper- 
ature is necessary, between 634° and 703° C. The amount of carbon 
dioxide reduced increases with the rise of temperature. For the table 
giving results of eleven experiments under varying conditions, we refer 
to the original article. {Ber. d. chem. Ges., xviii, 1647.) 

Preparation of Cyanogen in the Wet Way (by G. Jacquemin). — The 
usual process, by the action of a concentrated solution of cupric sul- 
phate on a saturated solution of potassium cyanide is incomplete, only 
half the cyanogen being evolved. In the process of the author all the 
cyanogen of the potassium cyanide is obtained and the gas is pure. 

Two parts of cupric sulphate dissolved in four parts of water are 
placed in a retort or in a flask, on a water-bath, and, by means of a 
stoppered funnel, a concentrated solution of one part of pure potassium 
cyanide is gradually introduced. The reaction begins violently at ordi- 
nary temperatures and when the evolution slackens the temperature of 
the water-bath is elevated to quicken it. Ten grams of chemically pure 
give 850 c. c. of pure cyanogen. Commercial KCN gives the same 
result, but the gas sometimes contains traces of CO 2 . 

There are two processes for withdrawing the cyanogen of the copper 
cyanide. 1. Decant the liquid remaining in the retort or flask, wash 
by decantation, and add a slight excess of ferric chloride of 30° B., or 
higher. The action commences in the cold and a slight elevation of the 
temperature produces an abundant evolution of cyanogen. The ferric 
chloride passes to the state of ferrous chloride in transferring the cop- 
per cyanide to chloride, which sets free the cyanogen and forms cuprous 
chloride which turns to cupric chloride at the expense of the excess of 
persalt of iron. 2. Add to the washed copper cyanide some manga-’ 
mese peroxide and acetic acid. Heat slightly. Acetates of copper and 
manganese are formed and cyanogen is evolved. When the operation 


654 


SCIENTIFIC EECORD FOR 1885. 


is ended the evolution tube is replaced by a receiver, sulphuric acid is 
added, and the mixture of the two acetates is distilled to collect the 
acetic acid, which is used again. (C. E. M. from Comptes rend., c, 1005.) 

On Potassium Chromocyanide and Hydrochromocyanic Acid (by H. 
Moissan). — Potassium chromocyanide is obtained in several ways : By 
the action of potassium cyanide on chromous acetate ; by calcining a 
mixture of potassium carbonate, dried blood, and finely-pulverized 
chromium ; by the action of potassium cyanide on chromous chloride in 
an apparatus filled with carbon dioxide, and by the action of potassium 
cyanide on chromous carbonate. 

Potassium chromocyanide forms fine crystals of a light yellow color, 
which occur several centimeters in length ; it is very soluble in water, 
insoluble in alcohol at 94°, ether and chloroform. Its specific gravity 
equals 1*71. The salt is anhydrous. It is permanent in the air at ordi- 
nary temperatures. In solution it does not give as a rule precipitates 
with acid salts of the metals. With ferrous salts it yields a red precip- 
itate ; with zinc and lead salts, a white precipitate ; with silver, bis- 
muth, and barium salts, a yellow precipitate. Its physiological action 
is similar to that of ferrocyanide of potassium. It has the composition 
KiCrOys. 

K dilute sulphuric acid be added to a concentrated solution of the 
salt, a white crystalline precipitate forms. This is the hydrochromo- 
cyanic acid, a very unstable body, decomposed in watery solution by 
acids. {Ann. ehim. phys. [ 6 J, rv, 136.) 

Notes on Nitrogen Trioxide and on Nitric Oxide. — Professor Ramsay, in 
a paper read before the chemical section of the British Association for 
the Advancement of Science, argued against the existence of gaseous 
nitrogen trioxide. He pointed out that the only criterion of the exist- 
ence of this gas is the vapor density; NO 2 and IS'O mix without change 
in volume, and, therefore, no combination takes i>lace. The vapor den- 
sity of the first portion of the gas obtained by distilling liquid N 2 O 3 , 
corresponds to that which a mixture of N 2 O 4 , NO 2 , and KO should have. 

At the same place Professor Dewar made remarks on the molecular 
weight of nitric oxide. A comparison of the curve of liquefaction of 
nitric oxide with that of methane shows the i)ressure to increase more 
rapidly with the temperature in the case of nitric oxide than in other 
gases, a fact that appears to indicate that at low temperatures the 
molecule of nitric oxide is of greater complexity and probably exists as 
N 2 O 2 . {Nature, xxxn, 538 and 540.) 

Reactions between Nitric Oxide and Oxygen under Varying Conditions 
(by G. Lunge). — The experiments described lead the author to the fol- 
lowing conclusions : 1. In the dry state, nitric acid with an excess of 
oxygen combines to forin N 2 C )4 exclusively, or nearly so. 2. Dry nitric 
oxide and oxygen, with an excess of the former, yield a great deal of 


CHEMISTRY. 


655 


N2O3 along with Nj04, both in a state of gas. 3. In the presence of 
water nitric oxide with an excess of oxygen is altogether converted 
into HNO3. 4. If nitric oxide and oxygen meet in the presence of con- 
centrated sulphuric acid there is neither N2O4 nor HNO3 formed, even 
with the greatest excess of oxygen, but the reaction is — 

2H,S04+2N0+0=2S02(0H)(0K0)+H,0 ; 

that is, nitrosyl sulphate and water. 

This last reaction has an important bearing on the theory of the 
manufacture of sulphuric acid. The author maintains that it is not, as 
generally assumed, the nitric oxide, NO, but the nitrogen trioxide, N3O3, 
which acts as the carrier of oxygen in the vitriol-chamber process. {J. 
Chem. 80 c., London, July, 1885, p. 465.) 

On the Reaction between Mercurous Nitrate and Nitric Oxide, and between 
Mercurous Nitrate and Nitrites (by Dr. Edward Divers and. Tamemasa 
Haga). — It has been known for, perhaps, half a century that mercurous 
nitrate yields metallic mercury when treated with a solution of alkaline 
nitrite, and this reaction has always been regarded as one of oxidation 
of the nitrate by reduction of the mercury salt. The authors show this 
is incorrect. When, with exclusion of air, pure nitric oxide is passed 
into a solution of mercurous nitrate in dilute nitric acid, a precipitation 
of metallic mercury slowly takes place and hydroxyamine is formed in 
quantity, but no ammonia. Prolonged contact of the gas gives rise to 
beautiful long yellow prisms, while the hydroxyamine disappears from 
the mother liqnor. This new yel.ow salt will be more fully described 
by the authors at a later date. The first stage of the reaction is thus 
formulated by these chemists : 

(HgN03)3-f2N0=:2(N0)N03+2Hg, 

nitric oxide precipitating mercury from its salt. The nitrosyl nitrate, 
here assnme<l to form, will at once decompose with water and mercurous 
nitrate into hydroxyammonium nitrate and mercuric nitrate, thus:

The Sulphur Compounds of Calcium (by V. H. Yeley). — The main points 
in this pnjjer are thus summarized by the author: 

1. By the action of hydrogen sulphide on solid calcium hydroxide 
there is formed a calcium monosulphide, in accordance with the equa- 
tion : 

Ca(0H)2+H2S=CaS4-2n20. 

2. By the action of hydrogen sulphide on calcium hydroxide in aque- 
ous solution there is formed calcium hydrosulphide, in accordance with 
the equation : 

Ca(OH)2+2Il2S+£cAq=Ca(SH)2-f 20H2-f .rAq.

Decomposition of Didymium ; Praseodymium and Neodymium. — Dr. C. 
A. von Welsbach read a paper before the Vienna Academy of Sciences 
on June 18, in which he describes an alleged decomposition of the 
elementary substance known as didymium. This decomposition was 
effected by means of the double ammonium or sodium nitrates in pres- 
ence of lanthanum. In spite of the different behavior of the constitu- 
ent bodies many hundred fractional crystallizations were necessary for 
their separation. The two new elements in solution are distinguished 
by intense absorption bands, and share between them the absorption 
bands of the peculiar spectrum hitherto ascribed to didymium. The 
colors of the compounds differ; the salts of that element which ap- 
proaches nearest to lanthanum are of a leek green ; the salts of the 
other element are rose or amethyst red. The latter body forms the 
bulk of didymium. 

Both colors are almost complementary, but the amethyst red is by 
far the more intense, so that a small quantity of the salts of this ele- 
ment causes the green color of the others to disappear. The atomic 
weights of the two new elements are according to preliminary deter- 
minations very different, and vary considerably from the value hereto- 
fore ascribed to didymium. For the first element the author proposes 
the name praseodymium (Pr), and for the second neodymium (Ne). The 
two elements, so far as has been observed, yield each only one series of 
salts derived from the sesquioxide. Praseodymium peroxide evolves 
chlorine on treatment with hydrochloric acid. ( Chemiker Ztg, and Chem. 
News, Lll, 49.) 

Researehes on the Complex Inorganic Acids (by Dr. Wolcott Gibbs). — 
.4nother and weighty instalment of his laborious researches was pre- 
sented by Dr. Gibbs to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 
early in June. Among other things, he shows that vanadic pentoxide 
unites with phosphoric or arsenic pentoxides in various proportions to 
form well-defined complex acids. Compounds of vanadic pentoxide, 
vanadic dioxide, and phosphoric or arsenic pentoxide may be formed 
possessing properties analogous to the corresponding compounds of 
tungsten and molybdenum. Compounds exist which contain pyro- 
phosphoric and metaphosphoric acids in the place of orthophosphoric 
acid. Complex acids exist which contain two different modifications of 
phosphoric acid, as, for instance, metaphosphoric and orthophosphoric 
acids or oxides. The salts of a majority of these complex acids crys- 
tallize in well-defined forms. In a summary Dr. Gibbs catalogues the 
formula of not fewer than 72 new salts discovered and analyzed in the 
course of his prolonged investigations. {Proceedings Am. Acad. Arts 
and Sciences, xix, 50.)

Sodium Orthovanadates and their Analogues (by Harry Baker). — 
Doubts expressed by Menclelejeff and by Eammelsberg as to the strict 
analogies between phosphorus, arsenic, and vanadium prompted the 
author to prepare and examine closely the sodium salts of tribasic 
orthovanadic acid. Trisodium phosphate and trisodium arsenate crys- 
tallize in hexagonal prisms with 12 molecules of water, and Roscoe de- 
scribes the corresponding vanadate as acicular crystals with 16 mole- 
cules of water. The author finds, however, that a vanadate having 12 
molecules of water (ila3V04.12H20), and crystallizing also in hexa- 
gonal prisms, can be obtained without difficulty. 

'Besides the latter, there exist two salts containing 10 molecules of 
water, one of which crystallizes in the isomeric and the other in the 
hexagonal systems. A third salt, crystallizing in rhombic tables, was 
obtained by the author, but owing to the great difficulties experienced 
in separating it from its mother liquid the water estimation was not 
satisfactory; it probably has the formula Na3y04.8H20. Phosphates 
and arsenates analogous to the three salts last named are not yet known. 
Sodium- vanadio-sodium-fluoride, 2]S'a3V04.NaF1.19H20, is also described 
by the author and its contents in water accurately determined as given. 

In conclusion, the author finds the analogies between vanadium, ar- 
senic, and phosphorus strongly confirmed by the results of his investi- 
gation. {Liebig^s Annalen, ccxxix, 286.) 

Recovery of Gold and Silver from Metallic Iron (by Dr. J. O. Booth). — 
In the course of an interesting article on the “ Smelting Furnace of 
the TJ. S. Mint,” the author gives his experience as to the best plan 
for recovering metallic gold and silver from the iron grate-bars, tools, 
&c. Formerly the iron was alternately heated and hammered until the 
precious metals scaled off. This operation took the labor of one dozen 
men during three or more days of ten hours each, for the gold 
clings with great tenacity to the iron ; nor was the method without 
loss. At present all the iron residues from the furnaces, even includ- 
ing the grate bars, are melted, and while quietly melted the heavier gold 
and silver settle out of the iron. When the mass is cold the precious 
metal is knocked off the bottom by a hammer as a single tough ring, 
with scarcely a trace of iron in it, while the iron above has never 
yielded a trace of gold or silver to the assayer. {Jour. Am. Chem. Soc., 
VII, 159.) 

An Electrical Furnace for Reducing Refractory Ores (by B. A. and A. 
H. Cowles). — These gentlemen, together with Prof. 0. F. Mabery. have 
devised an electrical furnace on the incandescent iirinciple. A column 
of fragments of well-calcined charcoal is embedded horizontally in finely- 
pulverized charcoal and covered by a layer of the same material coarsely 
broken, the whole being arranged in a box of fire-brick covered with

Ijeiiorated tile, and opened at the ends to admit two carbon electrodes 
an inch and a half in diameter. Through these is passed the current 
from a dynamo of 30 horse power. By this arrangement such a temper- 
ture is obtained that not only platinum-iridium may be fused, but the 
most refractory oxides, such as alumina, silica, &c., are reduced to their 
elements with formation of carbon monoxide. 

The ai)paratus is especially used in the manufacture of aluminum 
bronze and of silicium bronze for commercial purposes. 

The application of electricity to smelting is not so novel as commonly 
supposed. In 18.53-’54, G. A. Pichon used an electric furnace in which 
ores of iron, mixed with one hundredth of cote or charcoal, is fed b«^- 
tween the poles of a series (two or more tiers) of large electrodes; fusion 
takes place and the metal and slag fall into a heated receiver below . 
{Practical Mechanics’ Journal, vi, 257). In 1882, C. W. Siemens invented 
an electric furnace in which electrodes are arranged vertically one above 
another, the negative passing through the lid of the crucible into the, 
metal to be melted, the other through the bottom of the crucible. Tiie 
length of the arc is controlled automatically by the electro- motive force 
between the electrodes. This furnace was, however, for melting and 
not for smelting. {Chem. News, 1882, 163.) 

The furnace of Messrs. Cowles and Mabery yields good results on a 
larger scale than those of others. 

ORGANIC. 

A Plea for the Empiric Naming of Organic Compounds (by Professor 
Odling). — Verbal translations of the structural formulae assigned to or- 
ganic compounds possess certain advantages as names for the several 
compounds. Thus, they are applicable to all organic compounds of 
which the structural formulae are made out; they are the only sort of 
names applicable to complex isomeric compounds ; and their use can- 
not be dispensed with wholly in the case of even less complex com- 
pounds. Notwithstanding these advantages structural names consti- 
tute unsuitable names for gener.d use, more especially as applied to 
fundamtmtal hydrocarbons, alcohols, and acids. They are objectionable 
for this use by reason of their length, complexity, and want of ready 
iudicativeness, by the circumstance of their being based on concep 
tions of chemical constitution of a kind pointed out by experience a.s 
eminently liable to change, and by the further circumstance of theii' 
representing a one-sided, and so far an untruthful, notion of the bodies 
designated. Structural names expressing other than a distorted view 
of the constitution of all but a few of the most simple of organic bodies 
are imj)racticable by reason of their length and complexity. Hence, to 
avoid the distortion inseparable from the use of any single structural 
name for an organic body the only expedient is the a.ssignment to each

body, in proportion to its complexity, of an indefinite number of struct- 
ural names — a proceeding almost tantamount to not assigning it any 
particular name at all. Although from their number and complexity 
organic bodies can only be designated by names which do in some 
measure describe and characterize them, the primary purpose of a 
name is undoubtedly to designate and not to describe. Accordingly, 
with a view to the prompt mental association of object with name, brief 
empiric names based on the origin and properties of bodies are, where- 
ever practicable, to be preferred to structural names. Isomeric bodies 
maj', to a large extent, be distinguished by means of significant letters 
or syllables prefixed to the name common to the different isomers. But 
the suggested use of the particular letters nr, [3. y, each in a special 
sense, also a general resort to the particles “hydro,” “oxi,” and “hy- 
droxi,” as name components, and more especially the innovation of 
substituting the word “hydroxide” for the long-established word “hy- 
drate,” are ])ractices open to grave objection. (Eeport of British Asso 
ciation for the Advancement of Science, in Nature, xxxil, .538.) 

Ethyl-urethane, a new Hypnotic . — Carbamate of ethyl, or ethyl-ure- 
thane, CH 2 .C 2 H 5 .l!l 02 , has been found to have the properties of a hyp 
notic. This compound is prepared by the action of aqueous ammonia 
on ethyl carbonate, or on ethylchloro carbonate, and forms large traus 
])arent colorless crystals, which melt below 100° C., and distill ao 180° 
without alteration. It is soluble alcohol, ether, and water, to which it 
communicates a taste suggestive of saltpeter. 

Experiments with ethyl carbamate were first made on animals by 
Schrniedelberg ; recently von Jaksch has given the drug to man in 
doses of about 15 grains in over 100 cases. He finds it acts chiefly on 
the brain, having no appreciable influence over the peripheral nerves. 
It se^ms to be, therefore, a pure hypnotic. It causes a quiet and .seem 
ingly normal sleep, leaving no unpleasant secondary efl'ects. {Deutsche 
Medicinal Ztg., September 14, 1885.) 

Ethyl Compounds of Hypochlorous Acid (by Traugott Sandmeyer). — 
Ethyl hypochlorite, CIOO2H5, is easily obtained as follows : Chlorine 
gas is passed into a solution of sodium hydroxide (1 part) in water (10 
parts), cooled by ice, until absorption no longer takes place; This fur 
nishes free hypochlorous -acid and sodium chloride. 

NaOH+2Cl=NaCl+C10H. 

This is immediately placed in a separating funnel and mixed with one 
part- of alcohol ; the liquid becomes turbid and an oily layer .separates. 
This oil is drawn off, washed, and dried in contact with calcium chloride. 
This ethyl hypochlorite forms a yellow, mobile, very volatile liquid 
of strong o<lor, and attacking the respiratory organs. It burns with a

.STieenish flauie ; it can be distilled at 36° C. (Bar=762 mm.) without 
decomposition, but if a few drops are overheated in a test-tube it ex- 
I)lodes violently. The liquid is very sensitive to sunlight, boiling vigor- 
ously a few minutes after exposure, and exploding. This action is not 
accomplished by the heat rays. Even in diffuse light, ethyl hypochlo- 
rite can be preserved only a few hours, eventually decomposing without 
explosion. 

It acts very energetically on ammonia, phenol, aniline, and other or- 
ganic bodies. Mixed with bromhydric acid it sets bromine free, and al- 
cohol forms. The body was analyzed indirectly by determining the 
amount of iodine a given weight set free, the iodine being estimated 
volumetrically by sodium hyposulphite. 

The author plans further researches on analogous bodies. {Ber, d. d. 
chem. Ges., xviii, 1767.) 

On ih-e Decomposition of the Terpenes by Heat (by William A. Tilden). — 
The author shows that experiments stated lead to the conclusion that 
the terpenes do not belong to the aromatic series, and are not formed 
on the benzene type. M. Berthelot, commenting on Tilden’s paper, re- 
marks he regards it of importance in confirming views which he 
(Berthelot) had announced fifteen years before. (Ann. chim. phys. [ 6 ], 
V, 120.) 

On Derivatives of Hexaoxyhenzene and their Relation to Croconic and 
Rhodizonic Acid (by R. Nietzki and Th.Benckiser).— Starting with nitran 
ilic acid, the authors have obtained a series of interesting bodies ; a 
partial reduction of nitrauilic acid yielded nitro-amido-tetraoxybenzene, 
and a more complete reduction gave diamido tetraoxybenzene ; the lat- 
ter decomposes under certain conditions, forming a body having the 
formula CeHieO^, which by reduction with tin and hydrochloric acid 
yielded the long-sought hexaoxybenzene C6(OH)6. This body proved 
to be identical with the trihydrocarboxlylic acid obtained by Lerch from 
the action of potassium on carbon monoxide. On boiling the substance 
06 Hi 6 Oi 4 , with water, it decomposed, with evolution of carbon dioxide, 
and yielded a solution which, neutralized with potash, gave on concen- 
tration orange yellow acicular crystals of potassium croconate C 5 K 2 O 5 , 
first prepared in 1825 by Gmelin from the black residues of the manu- 
facture of potassium according to the method of Wohler and Brunner. 
From these facts it appears that Liebig, in his researches on the action 
of potassium on carbon monoxide, actually accomplished the direct syn- 
thesis of benzene derivatives from purely inorganic substances in the 
simplest manner. 

This synthesis was successfully repeated by the authors, who ob- 
tained, besides potassium croconate, the rhodizonate long before discov- 
ered by Berzelius, Wohler, and Heller. The latter salt was also ob- 
tained direct from dioxydichinoyl-sodium, thus establishing the identity

Organo-Silivium Compounds in the Aromatic Series (by A. Pol is). — 
Following the method devised by A. Michaelis in the preparation of the 
aromatic phosphiues, arsines, and stibines, the author has made sev- 
eral silicium compounds in the aromatic series. Siliciumtetraphenyl, 
Si (C 6 H 5 ) 4 , is obtained by the action of one molecule of siliciurntetra- 
chloride on four molecules of chlorbenzene in the presence of sodium 
and of absolute ether. The purihed i»roduct forms a colorless crystal- 
line powder, melting at 228°, little soluble in ether and in alcohol, 
easily soluble in chloroform and hot benzene. Heated with access of 
air, it burns, giving out flocks of silicic anhydride. 

By similar processes the author obtained i)ara siliciumtetratolyl. 
Si (C 6 H 4 CH 3 ) 4 , also melting at 228°; siliciumtetrabenzyl, Si (OH 2 C 6 H 5 ) 4 , 
which melts at 127.5°. Both of these bodies form colorless crystals 
having properties similar to siliciumtetraphenyl. {Ber. d. d. chem. Ges., 
xviu, 1540.) 

Silicates of the Phenols (by J. Hertkorn). — Pure ciystalliue phenol 
(boiling at 182-183°) was gently melted and treated with chloride of 
silicium, the former being in excess; the temperature of the mixture 
was gradually raised to 220° to 225°; hydrochloric acid gas was evolved, 
aud ceased after several hours. The simple liquid thus obtained was 
distilled, aud the fraction, boiling at 420°, yielded, on cooling, long col- 
orless prisms. The purified crystals, carefully dried, melted at 47° to 
48°. Analy.sis showed the body to have the composition ( 0 „n 5 ),Si 04 , 
tetraphenyl silicate, and was formed as shown in the equation : 

4C«H50H-fSiCl4=4HCl-f (C 6 H 5 ) 4 Si 04

'retriii)lieu.yl silicate dissolves easily in absolute alcohol, ether, ben- 
zene, toluene, xylene, chloroform, c'arbondisulphide, acetic acid, and 
formic acid without decomposition, but water precipitates a white jiclat- 
inous mass, and phenol dissolves out in the supernatant watery liquid. 
Since, however, the addition of an excess of alcohol or of ether causes 
the whole to go into solution, it is obvious that the precipitate consists 
of an acid phenyl silicate and not of silicic acid itself. With an excess 
of boiling water tetraphenyl silicate is completely decomposed into plie 
nol and silicic acid. 

When tetraphenylsilicate is heated with absolute alcohol, phenol and 
tetrethyl silicate are formed for the most part, but the latter ester yields 
in the presence of traces of moisture diethylsilicate, and probably hex- 
ethylsilicate. 

In a similar manner, the author prepared silicates of the three i.so- 
mei ic kresols; the ortho compound distilled at .4350-438°; the meta at 
443° to 446°, and the para at 442° to 445°. The author likewise ob- 
tained mcfa and ortho tetraxylenyle silicate, (C 8 B[ 9 )Si 04 , as well as the 
silicates of six similar bodies of the aromatic series. {Ber d. d. chem.

Some Derivatives of Lcevulinic Aeid (by Ludwig Wolff). — In distilling 
laevulinic acid a portion is decomposed and an oily substance obtained. 
This proves to contain two isomeric neutral bodies having the formula

The Anilides of Orthophosphoric Acid (by A. Michaelis and H. von 
iSoden). — By tbe action of oxychloride of phosphorus on aniline, ortho- 
phosphoric anilide, P 0 (NHC 6 H 5 ) 3 , is obtained in small crystals, soln 
ble in boiling alcohol and melting at 208°C. On treating this with 
bromine it yields orthopbosphorichexabromanilide, rO(NH(loH 3 Bi 2 );i, 
also a crystallized body melting at 252° to 2o30vJ. 

Dianilidoorthophosphoric acid, PO. OH(]SrH( ' 6115 ) 2 , is obtained by 
treating the corresponding chloride with soda lye; it forms a white 
powder insoluble in cold water, and decomposed by hot water into ani- 
line and phosphoric acid. This decomposition is more quickly effected 
by acids. The acid melts at 196° to 197°, becoming brown. Its silver 
salt forms a white precipitate, soluble in nitric acid and in ammonia. 
{Liebig’s Annalen, ccxxix, 334.) 

Chemical Constitution of Isatin (by H. Kolbe). — Isatin oxidized by 
chromic acid yields isatoic acid. This, heated with water, yields car- 
bon dioxide and orthoamidobenzoic acid. With hydrochloric acid the 
chloride is formed. Sulphuric and nitric acids act similarly. Dis- 
solved in alcohol and acted upon by hydrochloric-acid gas, ethyl 01 tho- 
amidobenzoic hydrochloride is formed, which is decomposed by water. 
Isatoic acid with bases in the cold evolved carbon dioxide, so salts could 
not be formed. Ammonia solution gives ammonium carbonate and 
orthoamidobenzamide. Anilin acts similarly. Concentrated nitric acid 
gives nitroisatoic acid, which is more stable than nitric acid. This 
heated with hydrochloric acid or water gives a strong acid resembling 
metanitroorthoamidobenzoic. Reduction of the nitro-acid with tin and 
hydrochloric acid gives the hydrochloride of a-diamido-benzoic acid. 
Sulphuric acid gives the sulphate. Treatment of isatoic . acid with ni- 
trous acid gives «-nitiosalicylic acid. The author concludes that the 
formula C 4 H 4 NCO — COH gives the best exi)laiiation of the above fact.s.

On the Synthetical Formation of Closed Carbon-chains. Part I — Deriva- 
tives of Trimethylene (by W. H. Perkins, jr.). — Organic chemistry is 
generally divided into two distinct sections, namely, the fatty series and 
the aromatic series. The members of the first series are derivatives of 
methane, the simplest hydrocarbon, and are characterized by their o[)eii 
or chain form, as, for example, in the case of normal hexane :

that is, contains a ring consisting of 6 carbon-atoms joined in such a 
way as to form a regular hexagon. 

These two series differ in the most marked way from one another, the 
members of the aromatic series being particularly characterized by their 
extreme stability. 

In considering the differences between these two series, the author 
says it is a matter of surprise that no intermediate series should be 
known, the members of which should possess partly the character of 
fatty and partly that of aromatic compounds. It is quite reasonable .to 
supi)Ose that rings should exist having 3, 4, 5, 7 carbon-atoms as well as 
6 carbon-atoms, though the few experiments made to test this supposi- 
tion have up to this time failed to throw much light upon the subject. 
Victor Meyer has discussed the improbability of the existence of a 
3 carbon -atom ring :

I’eactions of this gas which the author (Perkins) shows are evidences of 
its being true trimethylene.

Ethereal salts of many of these bodies were also prepared and studied. 

By heating hydroxylamine and hydrochloric acid with benzoyltrime- 
thylene, in a sealed tube, a complicated reaction sets in, yielding a deep- 
blue solution with an intense brick-red fluorescence. This solution 
proved to contain two distinct bases; that soluble in ether was found 
to have the constitution CaoHasiSlatlj- it is easily soluble in acetone, ani- 
line, and nitrobenzene, more sparingly in alcohol, ether, and in benzene. 
If the brownish-red alcoholic solution be treated with zinc dust and 
ammonia, it is reduced and becomes colorless; on agitating with air it 
is reoxidized. The salts of this base are easily obtained, and form deep- 
blue solutions with a most magnificent brick red fluorescence. Thehy-

The salts of trimethylenedicarboxylic acid (1:1) with ammonium, sil- 
ver, copper, barium, and lead, form well-defined crystallized bodies. (J.

Syntheses of Derivatives of Urea (by Kobert Behrend). — By the action 
of one molecule of acetic ether on one molecule of urea in alcoholic so- 
* lution, the author obtained /S-uramidocrotonic ether in accordance with 
the equation: 

06Hio03+CON2H4=C,Hi203N,+H,0. 

This body forms silky needles, melting at 165° to 166° C, insoluble in 
water, and crystallizing easily from alcohol. With alcoholic soda 
solution the salt CsH^I^^aOsNa forms with separation of alcohol. This 
sodium salt, treated with acids (even carbonic acid is active), yields the 
body C 5 H 6 ^^ 2 C) 2 , for which the author proposes the name methyluracil, a 
name, however, not intended to indicate constitution. Methyluracil 
crystallizes from hot water iu colorless needles; it is soluble in alcohol and 
insoluble in ether. It is decomposed on heating to 2700—280°, becom 
ing blackened and not melting. It dissolves easily in soda and potassa 
solutions, forming salts identical with those of uramidocrotonic ether. 
Theoretical considerations, whicli we cannot here detail, lead the author 
to adopt provisionally the following constitutional formula for methy- 
luracil :

Bromine acts on methyluracil in the cold and yields brommethyl- 
uracil C 5 H 5 Brl 7202 , a body crystallizing in microscopic prisms. Bromine 
converts this into a di-brom-compouud. Strong nitric acid converts 
methyluracil into a nitro-compound, CsHsllfaOe, which, by loss of car- 
bonic acid, yields C 4 H 3 N 3 O 4 nitro uracil. The latter is reduced by tin 
and hydrochloric acid to, C 4 H 5 if 302 , amido- uracil ; and this in turn by 
oxidation yields oxy-uracil, O 4 H 4 N 2 O 3 , an isomer of barbituric acid. 
Amido-uracil unites with cyanic acid, forming hydroxyxanthin, on which 
body the author continues his researches. (Liehig^s Annalen. coxxix, 1.) 

Synthesis of Cocaine, the New Ancesthetie (by W. Merck). — At tlie chem- 
ical manufactory of E. Merck, in Dai mstadt, a quantity of a lye product 
was obtained in the extraction of cocaine, which was sent for examina- 
tion to W. Merck, in Kiel. It formed a colorless, crystallizable body,

having a. slight acid reaction, melting -at 188-5o to 189°, and yielding 
by decomposition benzoic acid and ecgouine. Merck recognized ir as 
benzoyl ecgonin, or ecognine in which one hydrogen atom is replaced 
by benzoyl, OgHuNOs — C7H5O. By heating this substance with potas- 
sium hydroxide and methyliodide cocaine was obtained: 

Benzoyl-ecgonine. Cocaine. 

CisHigNO.+CHgl+KOH = HgO+KI. 

The artificial product was found to have all the properties of the 
natural. 

Almost simultaneously with* this result of Merck, the synthesis was 
accomplished by Scraup, who employed a mixture of benzoyl ecgouine, * 
sodium methylate, and methyliodide. Scraup’s method yielded, how- 
ever, onlj' about 4 per cent, of the theoretical amount, while Merck 
obtained 80 per cent, of the theoretical yield. Subsequently Merck 
succeeded in transforming ecgonine itself directly into cocaine by heat- 
ing a mixture of methyliodide, benzoic anhydride, and anhydrous ecgo- 
nine :

By introducing the radical ethyl a homologue of cocaine was ob- 
tained which the author calls cocathyline. Merck is continuing his 
researches. (Berichte d. chem. Ges., xvili, 1594, 2264, and 2952.) 

The Fat or Wax obtained from Cincho7ia — Researches on Bark. — O. 
ilesse obtains from the Cuprea barks cupreol, a compound which in 
all points resembles quebrachol. This body crystallizes from alcohol 
in colorless satiny leaflets, which quickly become dull in dry air. It is 
readily soluble in chloroform, ether, and hot alcohol; less readily in 
petroleum ether, and cold alcohol, and iu water, ammonia, and potash- 
lye not at all. It melts at 140°, and at higher temperatures it vola- 
tilizes, unchanged in a current of hydrogen or carbonic acid. The solu- 
tion iu chloroform, when shaken with sulphuric acid of 1-76 spirit 
grains, turns a blood red, as do the the chloroform solutions of quebra- 
chol, cholesteriu, or phytosteriu. Ciuchol occurs iu all true cinchona 
barks, but not in cuprea bark. From alcohol it crystallizes partly iu 
long, almost acicular leaflets, partly in broad leaves, and always with 1 
molecule of water. It loses a part of its water at 20° to 25°, and the 
rest at 100°, or in the desiccator. Anhydrous cinchol melts at 139° and 
iu other respects has the properties of cupreol. The author describes 
the acetyl and propionyl derivations of cupreol. The china bark 
contains, therefore, three isomeric bodies, having the formula C 2 oH 34 'J, 
cupreol, cinchol, and quebrachol ; all three belong to the cholesterins.

The germicide power of formic, acetic, and propionic acids was also 
tested and found to be nearly in an inverse ratio to their acidity. For 
the peculiar order of the alcohols given in the above table 'the author 
can suggest no explanation. {Am. Chem. Journ., vil, 62.) 

Occurrence of Citric Acid in Seeds of Leguminous Plants (by .H. Eitt- 
hausen). — The existence of citric acid, together with malic and oxalic 
acids, in the seed of the yellow lupine {Lup. luteus) has already been 
shown. Tlie author finds it also in the seed of Vida sativa (vetch), 
V. faha (hog’s beau), various varieties of peas, and in the white garden 
bean (Phaseolns). The powdered seeds are digested with water acidi- 
fied with hydrochloric acid, the solution filtered, neutralized with an 
alkaline hydrate, and precipitated with lead acetate. This is suspended 
in water, treated with sulphuretted hydrogen, and the citric acid gotten 
in the usual way from the acid liquid. The white bean contains very 
little citric acid, and peas contain less than the other legumes men 
tioned. {Jour, f prakt. Chem., xxix, 357.) 

Percentages of Alcohol in Ciders and of Aeetic Acid in Vinegars (by W.

mum and minimum percentages of alcohol and aeetic acid which genuine 
apple Juice would produce.. The expressed juice of selected apples 
was allowed to ferment slowly for two months in a cellar at an average 
temperature of C. The determinations of alcohol were then made

by the ordinary method of distillation and specific gravity. Selected 
“August Sweets” gave 9-40 per cent, alcohol; the same variety of 
average quality gave 6 05 per cent. ; and imperfectly ripe apples of 
same variety gave 4-80 per cent. “ Greening ” apples picked from the 
trees gave 4 per cent, alcohol. The average of eight experiments gave 
5 per cent, hy weight. Ten months later the acidity and solid residue in 
the samples was determined ; the former varied between lO’l per cent, 
and 4-40 per cent., and the latter between 2-70 per cent, and 3-64. The 
actual amounis of acetic acid found are lower than the alcoholic per- 
centages in the original ciders demand, owing to imperfect acetification. 

This investigation shows that a good cider should contain about 5 
per cent, alcohol, and a fair sample ought not to fall below 4 per cent.; 
a good cider vinegar ought to contain from 5-5 of acetic acid to 7 per 
cent. {Journ. Avi. Chem. Soc., Vil, No. 4.) 

NOTES. 

During the year 1884, 281,000 pounds of bromine were produced in 
the United States, 7,000,000 pounds of borax, and 1,800 troy ounces of 
of aluminium. (Albert Wilt.iams, Jr. Report on Mineral Resources 
of the United States.) 

During the year 1883 there were manufactured in Germany 148,450 
tons of hydrochloric acid and 115,500 tons of carbonate of soda; half of 
the latter was made by Solvay’s process. During the same year there 
were manufactured in England 940,638 tons of sulphuric acid (calcu- 
lated as H 2 SO 4 ) ; 129,040 tons of soda ash (calculated as NaaCOa) ; and 
141,868 tons of bleaching powder. Dr. Lunge thinks the Leblanc i^ro- 
cess and ammonia process for manufacturing soda will flourish side by 
side, and the latter will not displace the former unless hydrochloric 
acid can be made at the same time. {Ghemische Industrie., yii, 78 and 
213.) 

Professor Mart. Websky has continued his researches on the supposed 
new element, idunium, contained in the lead vanadate of Cordoba 
(Argentine Republic), but has been unable to establish the identity of 
the metal as a new species. {Sitzungsh K. Akad., Wiss. Berlin, February 
5, 1885, page 95.) 

The rare metal gallium has been prepared by Dr. L. Ehrlich by an in- 
dustrial process. From 80 kilos of zinc blende he obtained 0-9 grams 
gallium. The melting point of the metal is 30-5° C. The luster of gal- 
lium globules IS greater than that of mercury. [Chemiker-Zeitung.) 

Greville Williams finds that zinc dust occludes hydrogen. A given 
sample of commercial zinc dust contained 39 times its volume of hydro- 
gen. The experimenter thinks the absorbed gas was originally derived 
from water and shows the bearing of this on the conclusions anived at 
in the case of the Lenarto meteorite. {Journal of Gas Lighting.) 

The decomposition of potassium chlorate by heat has been studied 
anew by Dr. F. L. Teed. He finds that the equation commonly em-

ployed [2KC103=KC104+KC1+02] does uot truly represent the facts, 
andproposesthefollowing: ]0KClO3=6KClO4+4KC]+3O2. Theauthor 
confirms the statemeut that when Mn02 is heated with the KOIO3 no 
perchlorate is formed. The phenomena noted appear to indicate that the 
molecular weight of the salt is much higher than is required by the for- 
mula KCIO3. {J. Chem. Soc. Lond.) 

New reasons for considering liquid or solid sulphur trioxide as S2O6 
rather than SO3 are afforded by the results of experiments reported by 
Dr. E. Divers and T. Shimidzu upon the reactions of pyrosulphuric acid 
with silver, mercury, and copper. When freed carefully from moisture, 
sulphur trioxide is without action on these metals, unless a little sul- 
phuric acid be present. The reaction with silver is as follows : 

(S 0 ,)S 04 + 2 Ag=Ag,S 04 +S 0 *. 

{Chem. News.) 

By heating in sealed tubes glucose with strong ammonia and subse- 
quent treatment with solvents C. Tauret obtained two new alkaloids, 
which he calls, respectively, a-glucosine and /9-glucosine. These form 
volatile colorless liquids, with a peculiar strong odor, the first boiling 
at 136° and the second at 160°. In acid solution they are precipitated 
by the usual reagents for alkaloids ; with hydrochloric acid they form 
hydrochlorates. {Bull. soc. chim., XLiv, 102.) 

Professor Carnelley and James Schlerschmann have investigated the 
influence of strain on chemical action. Working with copper wires free 
and under strain, exposed to the action of ammonium chloride, they 
come to the conclusion that strain exerts no ja^rceptible influence upon 
chemical action under the conditions described. {Chem. News, xii, 6.) 

The cau.ses of the decrepitations in samples of .so-called explosive 
pyrites have been studied by B. Blount and formulated as follows : (1) 
The decrepitations are due to the presence of CO2, together with more 
or less H2O. (2) The OO2 is confined at high pressures probably suffi- 
cient to liquefy it. (3) The usual temperature at which the pyrites be- 
gins to decrepitate is 30° to 36° C. {Chem. News, Lii, 7.) 

The removal of micro organisms from water forms the subject of a 
valuable paper by Dr. Percy P. Franklaud, in the Chemical News, Lit, 
27, et seq. 

Chlorochromic acid is prepared, according to H. Moissan, by bringing 
together gaseous hydrochlorii; acid and pure chromic anhydride per- 
fectly free from sulphuric acid. On warming red fumes appear, which , 
condense into chlorochromic acid ; but a portion is decomposed by the 
water formed at the same time. Dry chlorine does not attack chromic 
anhydride. Gaseous hydrobromic and hydriodic acid do not form analo- 
gous chromium compounds. ( Bull, de VAs.soc. des iileves de M. Fremy, 2.) 

Cocaine, the established ansesthetic, according to G. Calmels and E. 
Gossin, is “ methylicbenzometholethyltetrahydropyridine carbonate.”

Names, in this report, under the head “Organic.”

Eesearches on the influence of silicon upon the properties of cast 
iron, by Thomas Turner, show that, -contrary to the generally accepted 
views on this subject, a suitable addition of silicon to cast iron im- 
proves the tensile strength of the metal. An addition, however, of more 
than 2.5 per cent, causes deterioration. {Chem. News, Lii, 5.) 

Eleven months’ experience with toughened glass beakers made 
under De La Bastie’s patents leads R. J. Friswell to the conclusion that 
“ toughened glass is a complete failure in the laboratory.” ( Chem. News, 
Ul, 5.) 

The adulteration of beer is discussed in a paper by Prof. H. B. Corn- 
wall presented to the American Public Health Association. The aver- 
age contents in alcohol of twelve beers was 4.197 per cent., and of ex- 
tract, 6-26 per cent. Milwaukee beer contains as high as 5-35 per cent, 
of alcohol. 

The apparatus and process for liquefying oxygen gas, employed by 
Oailletet, are figured and described in the Journal de physique, and in 
Nature (xxxii, 584), to which we refer for details. 

Chlorine monoxide has been .studied .anew by K. Garzarolli Thuru- 
lackh and G. Scbacherl. It forms a dark brown liquid, haviug a yel- 
lowish-brown vapor; its density is 3*0072 at 10*C° C. and 726*4“™, and 
its boiling point is 5° C. at 737*9““. Exposed to sunlight it does not 
decompose as commonly stated, and if organic material be excluded 
it does not explode in passing from -the liquid to the gaseous state. 
{Liebig’s Annalen, coxxx, 273.) 

By distilling plants in a fresh state with water, M. Maqueiiue has ob- 
tained suaall quantities of methylic alcohol, but he has not ascertained 
whether this body exists ready formed in the plants or is produced dur- 
ing the distillation. (Comptes rendus, oi, 1067.) 

Vacciniin, a bitter principle occurring in the cowberry, discovered 
by Edo Claassen in 1870, has been found by the same chemist to be 
identical with arbutin, extracted from Arbutus uva ursi, Lin. — {Am. J. 
Pharm., 1885 ) 

Under the title “The Sugar Chemistry of the United States” Prof. 
Harvey W. Wiley, chief chemist to the Department of Agriculture, 
has issued a valuable compend, in four parts, relating respectively to 
cane, beet, sorghum, and maple sugars. The analyses of maple sugar 
are numerous, and we learn that “ there is no method of detecting the 
adulteration of maple sugar with other sucroses. The temptation to 
this adulteration is great because maple sugar commands nearly double 
the price of other sugars. ISTeither chemistry nor optics will help to a 
decision as to adulteration.” A patented extract of hickory bark is 
used to give the characteristic flavor of maple sugar to glucose or cane 
sirups. 

The second annual meeting of the Association of Official Agricultu- 
ral Chemists was held Sei)tember 1 and 2 at Washington, D. C. In

president, Prof. H. C. White. The “ Proceedings,” published by the 
Department of Agriculture as Bulletin No. 7, of the Division of Chem- 
istry, will be found invaluable to all analytical chemists. 

The chemical section of the American Association for the Advance- 
ment of Science met in August at Ann Arbor. The chairman of the 
section. Prof. William Ripley Nichols, addressed the members on 
“ Chemistry in the Service of Public Health.” The address will be 
found in the “Proceedings” of the association, vol. xxxiv. 

The Institute of Chemistry (England) has undergone a transforma- 
tion. Originally founded in October, 1877, with a membership of 150, 
it grew to embrace over 400 fellows. On the 30th of June, 1885, it 
ceased to have an official existence, but meanwhile, on the 13th of 
June, 1885, another organization was perfected under the title “Insti- 
tute of Chemistry of Great Britain and Ireland,” and the officers of the 
original society became officers of the new one. The new institute has 
secured a royal charter and has public duties and privileges accorded 
it, becoming a professional body officially known to Government. Dr. 
Odling, the president, gave his address November 6, 1885. (See Chem- 
ical JSfews, Lii, 243.) Dr. Odling’s address is severely criticised by an 
anonymous writer in Nature (xxxiii, 73), who protests strongly against 
the commercial aspect of the views enunciated. He says: “The spirit 
[of the address] is an alien spirit, repugnant to students of pure science 
in this country.” 

A biography of the late Dr. Robert Angus Smith was read at the 
annual general meeting of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical 
Society held April 21, by Dr. E. Schunck. It will be found in Chem. 
News, LI, 293. 

Prof. Edward Divers, of the Imperial College of Engineering, Tokio, 
met with a serious accident which threatened the loss of an eye. In at- 
tempting to remove the stopper of a bottle containing phosphorus tri- 
chloride he gently warmed the neck, when the bottle exploded violently, 
and projected glass into one eye. Dr. Divers supposes moisture had 
entered the bottle and formed hydrochloric acid, thus producing gas 
under tension. 

On Monday, August 1, 1885, Prof. Michel Eugene Chevreul entered 
upon his one hundredth year. . Apart from the fact that among men 
whose lives have been devoted to active scientific research no one has 
before attained so great an age, Chevreul stands conspicuous for the vast 
amount of work he has done, and for the great practical effect his work 
has had on the industries of the world. His researches on “les corps 
gras,” begun in 1813, continued until 1823, when they appeared in a 
volume dedicated to Vauquelin, his teacher. His researches on color 
occupy the whole of volume xxxiii of the Memoirs of the Institut. It 
has often been remarked, it is difficult to realize that the Chevreul of 
“corps gras” fame and the Chevreul who wrote on colors are one and 
the same man. (Condensed from Nature, xxxii, 425.)

MINERALOGY. 


By Prof, Edward S. Dana, 

¥ale College, Neic Haven, Conn. 


GENERAL WORKS ON MINERALOGY. 

The list of miueralogical works iinblished in 1885 includes a new 
edition of Nauniann’s Elemente der Mineralogie. * This is the twelfth 
edition of the work, and, like the tenth, issued in 1877, and the eleventh, 
in 1881, has been edited by Professor Zirkel, of Leipzig. It includes the 
numerous additions of the jiast four years, and since then the whole 
matter has been thoroughly worked over. While not aiming at exhaust- 
ive completeness, it yet gives much more than any other treatise in 
the German language, and is a decided advance upon previous editions 
of the work. The Lehrbuch der Mineralogie of Tschermak, the first edi- 
tion of which was noticed in the report for 1883, has appeared in a sec- 
ond edition, with some minor additions and corrections. Increased 
acquaintance with the work brings a higher appreciation of its excel- 
lence, more especially as regards its treatment of subjects in physical 
mineralogy. The veteran Pussian mineralogist, N. v. Kokscharow, con- 
tinues his labors with unremitting activity. The product of the past 
year is an additional portion of the ninth volume of the Materialien zur 
Mineralogie Busslands, covering pages 81 to 272, and giving a general 
description of the species turquois, and supplementary chapters on 
topaz, vesuvianite, nephelite, orthoclase (sanidine) and linarite. 

A new edition of Groth’s PhysikalischeKrystallographiehas been pub- 
lished, with a very large amount of new matter, increasing the size of 
the volume nearly one-half. The additions are largely in the chapters 
devoted to the methods and instruments employed in the study of the 
l»hysical characters of minerals, which are treated with a fullness that 
leaves nothing to be desired. The work is comprehensive throughout 
and only to be compared with Mallard’s Traite de noticed 

in the report for 1884, which, however, occupies a somewhat different 
field. Itosenbusch has completed a new edition of his invaluable Milcro- 
nkopische PhysiograpMe der petrographisch 7ciehtigen MineralUn, largely 
increased in size and improved in every way. The work is unrivalled

iu its special sphere, and is essential not only to the petrographer but 
also to the general mineralogist, being the production of an author who 
is thoroughly informed of the work done by others, and at the same time 
has himself made extensive contributions in the same direction. Under 
the title of The Determination of Bock forming Minerals, has been issued 
a translation, by E. G. Smith, of Beloit College, of Hussak’s work (re- 
port for 1884), which is thus placed in convenient form for Euglish-read- 
ing students. EirschwaWs catalogue of the mineral collection of the 
Berlin University is an addition to topographical mineralogy. Hatle 
has prepared a summary of the mineral occurrences of Styria. In the 
department of meteorites the catalogue of the nearly unrivalled collec- 
tion iu Vienna by Brezina is interesting not only as a catalogue, but for 
the discussion of the classification of meteorites and of various points 
in regard to their structure and origin. 

A second report on the Mineral Resources of the United States for the 
calendar years 1883, 1884, has been issued by the U. S. Geological Sur- 
vey, under the same editorship as the first volume — Albert Williams, 
ir. This volume is much larger than its predecessor and is made up 
almost entirely of new matter. After a general summary by the editor, 
a series of chapters, prepared for the most part by different specialists, 
are devoted to each subject, many of them treated with great fullness. 
Thus, to the subject of coal and coke two hundred pages are given ; 
chapters on petroleum and natural gas follow ; then extended papers 
on iron, gold and silver, copper, lead, zinc, mercury, and the other metals, 
these last covering pages 246 to 661., The remainder of the volume is 
given to a variety of subjects, as building materials, abrasive materials, 
precious stones, fertilizers, mineral paints, glass materials; also salt, 
graphite, pyrites, and so on. The whole volume contains a vast amount 
of material of value and interest to a great variety of readers in prac- 
tical life. 

A fifth Annual Beport of the Mineralogy of California has been issued 
by the State mineralogist, H. G. Hanks. It is largely devoted to an 
account of the exhibit of California and other States at the recent Ex- 
position in New Orleans. The bulletins of the U. S. Geological Survey 
recently issued are some of them devoted to mineralogical subjects, 
more particularly No. 20, containing contributions to the mineralogy of 
the Bocky Mountains, by W. Cross and W. F. Hillebrand. This is 
largely a reprint of jiapers (on zeolites, cryolite, &c.) previously pub- 
lished, but contains also some additions and emendations of the original 
ipatter. Another bulletin contains a description of the secondary en- 
largement of mineral fragments (amphibole, quartz, &c.) iu certain 
rocks, by B. D. Irving and C. B. Vanhise. 

CRYS'J ALLOGRAPHT AND PHYSICAL MINERALOGY.

fact exhaustive iu its treatmeut of the subject, though not original in 
matter for the most part. It opens with a catalogue of papers and books 
treating of the species pyrargyrite and proustite— extending from 1057 
to the present time — and then goes on to give a statement of the results 
reached, chemical and crystallographic. The list of planes observed 
on the two species is one hundred and eight, with three doubtful ones. 
To this long list the author considerately makes no new additions. He 
discusses critically, however, the results of earlier observers, as Hatiy, 
Mohs, L6vy, and Sella— of whom, lor example. Sella added forty-nine new 
forms— and for convenience of reference gives a series of lists arranged ac- 
cording to zones, according to the numerical value of the indices, by com- 
binations, and so on. He details also a series of measurements made 
upon four varieties, all of which were analyzed, and which included a pure 
proustite (containing no antimony), a pure pyrargyrite (with no arsenic), 
and also two varieties of the latter mineral, with 2-62 and 3-()l per cent, 
arsenic, respectively. It appears from these that the fundamental rhom- 
bohedron becomes a little more acute as, the amount of arsenic increases. 
The values of the vertical axis in the different cases are 0-8034 (proustite) 
0-7890, 0-7893, 0-7865 (pure pyrargyrite). A long list of calculated angles 
completes the memoir. The first part of a somewhat similar monograph 
has- been issued by Sansoni, of Pavia. This is devoted to the calcite of 
Andreasberg, but when completed the memoir is to cover the whole 
species. The author has attacked the subject with great vigor, notwith- 
standing Its difSculty and the large amount of the literature devoted to 
it. His observations are largely original, based upon a collection of 
twenty-five hundred specimens, loaned from many museums. The 
number of crystals measured is stated to be seven hundred and twenty- 
two. Eight types of forms are described and illustrated by a series of 
figures. The number of planes included is one hundred and thirty-one 
occurring in three hundred and fifty-nine combinations. 

An interesting contribution to the morphology of the species rhodonite 
has been made by G. Flmk. The specimens examined were from Pais- 
berg and Lfingban, in Sweden, and included a large number of crystals 
showing considerable variety in habit and occurring planes. The num- 
ber of the latter identified is twenty-nine, of which nineteen are new. 
Ihe author follows the suggestion first made in Dana’s System of Min- 
eralogy, and later developed by Groth, and adopts the position which 
brings the crystals into correspondence with the related monoclinic 
pyroxene. This relation he discusses at length, and shows that the 
similarity in forms and angles and cleavage between the triclinic 
rhodonite and monoelinic pyroxene is very close, to be compared with 
that between the monoclinic and triclinic feldspars. The axial relations 


are: 

a : b : c 

Rhodonite 1-0727 : 1 ; 0-62104 

Pyroxene 1-0903 : 1 : 0-5893

The author also discusses at length the optical constants pi the s])e- 
cies. Two plates of figures show the A’arious habits of the crystals. 
Some of the tabular forms are strikingly like the crystals recently ob- 
tained in some abundance at Franklin Furnace, New Jersey (varietj- 
fowlerite). 

Penfield has described crystals of tiemannite from Utah and also 
crystals of metacinnabarite from California. The former mineral, the 
pure selenide of mercury, has hitherto been known only in massive form. 
It is now shown to crystallize in tetrahedral crystals, similar to sphalerite 
in. habit and in twinning, Metacinnabarite, the black amorphous sul- 
phide of mercury described by G. E. Moore, is also shown to crystallize 
in similar tetrahedral forms, the crystals, however, being less distinct 
and perfect than those of tiemannite. These two species thus take 
their proper places in mineralogical classification. It does not appear, 
however, that the dimorphous forms of the sulphides of zinc and mer- 
cury, wurtzite and cinnabar, bear any close relation to each other. 
Penfield’s determinations give the crystallized tiemannite a specific 
gravity of 8T9, much higher than that before accepted for the species; 
also that of metacinnabarite 7‘81, while the intermediate comimund 
onofrite — the sulpho-selenide of mercury — from Utah lies between them 
with a specific gravity of 8-04. 

Crystals of azurite from the Clifton mines in Arizona have been 
measured by O. W. Huntington. They are shown to be highly modi- 
fied, though not adding to the already large list of the species (this 
list includes fifty-one or fifry-two planes). The measured angles also 
correspond closely to those of the Chessy crystals. The work on the 
descloizite crystals of New Mexico by vom Path, according to whom 
they are to be taken as orthorhombic, is referred to on a later page. 

The apparent cleavage of titanite parallel to the hemipyramid 77 (2 P 
of the usually accepted form), conspicuous on the crystals from Northern 
New York, has been shown by G. H. Williams to be only a structural 

parting,” due to the interposition of twin lameUse. It thus has the 
same explanation as the frequently observed “cleavage,” parallel to the 
basal plane of pyroxene, and similarly in other cases. The same author 
has described crystals of amphibole from Saint Lawrence County, New 
York, which were interesting in showing several new planes in the 
prismatic zone. Penfield has figured and examined optically some 
curious composite crystals of analcite from the Lake Superior copper 
region, remarkable for their symmetrical arrangement. The quartz 
crystals of North Carolina, hardly second to those of the Alps in inter- 
est and complexity of crystalline form, have received the attention they 
deserve at the hands of vom Path. His memoir upon them is accom- 
panied by numerous figures showing the various types of forms. 

Additional observations on the crystalline form of the beautiful new 
borate, colemanite (see the report for 1884), have been published by 
Jackson, Hiortdahl and Arzruni. Palla has studied crvstals of gdthite

lioLU (Joruwall, aucl atteini)ted to show that the iiieasiueineiits can 
be explained only by the assumption of the presence of “vicinal” 
planes with very complex indices, or else of a monoclinic form with an 
obliquity of 36'. The correctness of such conclusions may fairly be 
questioned. The phlogopite of Templeton, Canada, which is black to 
brown in color and shows the well known asterism, has been studied 
by Lacroix. His results go to prove that the inclusions to which the 
asterism has been long recognized as due are in this case minute acicu- 
lar crystals of rutile, which cross each other at angles of 90°, 120°, and 
150°. Doelter has added to our knowledge of the relation between the 
optical properties and chemical composition of the various kinds of py- 
roxene, a subject the interest of which has already been recognized. 

The optical behavior and micro-structure of corundum forms the sub- 
ject of an interesting paper by Lasaulx, which goes far to settle the 
disputed question as to its true crystalline form. He concludes that 
corundum is truly optically uniaxial and hence is to be referred to the 
rhombohedral, not the monoclinic, system, and that the anomalous op- 
tical characters which have suggested the latter conclusion are con- 
nected with disturbances due to the growth and structure of the crystals. 
The optical irregularities are further associated with structure planes 
parallel to the rhombohedron,the base and the second hexagonal prism ; 
the lamellar structure in these directions conditions the cleavage or 
“ parting” often observed parallel to one or more of these forms. This 
parting, he concludes, is not caused by twinning lamellae, as has been 
assumed, but the latter determined by the presence of the structure 
planes, both appearing simultaneously. The optical irregularities are 
caused in part by tension in certain of the crystal, in part as a con- 
sequence of the interposed twin-lamellae. 

Kinne has made a study of the rare silicate milarite from an optical 
point of view, and reached the conclusion that it is to be taken as belong- 
ing in fact to the hexagonal system, although secondary causes have 
given it the optical structure which has led to its being classed as an 
orthorhombic species with hexagonal pseudo-symmetry. An analogous 
conclusion is reached by the same author in regard to apophyllite. 
Stadtlander has contributed the results of an optical study of sections 
of apophyllite crystals from Stempel, near Marburg, extending our kn owl 
edge of the optical anomalies and showing that, as has been proved be- 
fore, they must be referred to secondary causes. 

The often-discussed subject of the true form of leucite crystals (see 
report for 1884) has received uninteresting contribution from Kosen 
busch. After reviewing the results reached by others, especially by Klein, 
he goes on to detail the results of some experiments by himself on the 
effect of a high temperature upon the twin structure of the crystals. A 
section of an implanted crystal of leucite from Vesuvius, showing distinct 
twinning lamellae, was held in the platinum-pointed pincers before a 
microscope in sucli a position that a strong reflected light brought out

clearly the twinniug lamellae as contrasted with the rest of the surface, 
and then strongly heated. Various sections were taken, but in every 
case when the heating commenced the surface under examination 
showed a peculiar movement, leading as the temperature rose to a 
change in the number, position, and dimensions of the twinning lamellae. 
Finally, when the heat was suflBciently increased all these lamellae and 
all breaks in the surface disappeared, and the entire surface reflected the 
light evenly. With a fall of the temperature, however, the irregular- 
ities in structure re-appeared, but not so as to reproduce exactly the 
original section ; that is, the position and number of the twinning lamellae 
were changed, although the law of twinning remained constant. The 
significance of such experiments, especially in connection with the dis- 
appearance of the optical anomalies with a high temperature, is obvious. 

Brauns has followed up a line of investigation earlier undertaken 
by him (report for 1883) in regard to the double refraction in crystals, 
which are isomorphous mixtures of salts normally isometric and isotropic, 
and has developed some interesting facts of this kind. recognizes 
the double refraction in such mixtures (as of different alums) as second- 
ary, but regards the final cause as yet unddermined, only suggesting 
that the different volumes of the molecules and different powers of re- 
fraction may play an important part in the matter. The minerals of the 
spinel or magnetite group have been made the object of a series of etching 
experiments by Becke, the aim of which was to add to our knowledge 
of the connection between etching figures and crystalline structure. The 
same author had earlier studied the same subject in connection with 
sphalerite and galena. The minerals now experimented upon were 
magnetite, franklinite, spinel, and linnaeite. The etching figures on 
boracite and cryolite have been anew studied by Baumhauer. 

The following are some of the more important papers* on general 
physical mineralogy which cannot be briefly summarized, and hence 
are alluded to only: Miigge on change of position of crystalline planes, 
brought about by secondary twinning ; Liebisch on the total reflection 
in doubly -refracting crystals; Voigt on the values obtained for the 
constants of elasticity of rock salt and fluor spar, and also on the ex- 
planation of the pleochroic phenomena of crystals ; Beckenkamp on the 
methods of experiment in the determination of the constants of elas- 
ticity ; Wulflf on the effect of different kinds of movement upon crys- 
tallization; Blasius on the expansion of crystals with heat, and the 
same author on the decomposition figures of crystals; Schrauf on the 
double refraction of calcite ; Curie on the formation of crystals and the 
capillary constants of their different faces; Dufet on the variation of re- 
fractive indices with heat; Danker on the experimental verification of 
the laws of total reflection deduced from FresnePs laws of double refrac- 
tion ; Eiecke on the pyro-electricity of tourmaline.

CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. 

Some interesting contributions have been made to the important part 
of chemical mineralogy dealing with the artificial formation of minerals. 
An extended paper by Doelter, of Graz, describes the formation of a 
number of sulphides, as galena, cinnabar, chalcocite, bornite, covellite, 
chalcopyrite, and pyrite, and also the sulphantimonites, miargyrite, 
jamesonite, and bournonite. The special object of the investigation was 
to accomplish the end aimed at under conditions and by methods as 
similar as possible to those that nature may be supposed to have em- 
ployed; in other words, to avoid for the most part very high tempera- 
tures and the use of reagents that can hardly have entered into na- 
ture’s processes. For example, it was shown that pyrite may be pro- 
duced without essential elevation of temperature, by the action of water 
containing hydrogen sulphide upon hematite (FezOs), as also upon siderite 
(FeCOs) and magnetite (Fe 304 ). Similarly the experiments with galena 
lead to the conclusion that it could be produced in nature by hydrogen 
sulphide acting upon solutions of lead carbonate and lead chloride. 
Cubes of galena were formed in a tube containing lead chloride, hydro- 
gen sulphide, and bicarbonate of soda, kept for five months at the ordi- 
nary temperature of the laboratory. Cinnabar was obtained in minute 
brilliant red crystals by digesting mercury in a sealed tube contain- 
ing hydrogen sulphide for six days at a temperature of 70° to 90° C. 
Covellite (CuS) was Reduced from malachite in a sealed tube contain- 
ing a hydrogen sulphide solution at 80° to 90°. Further, the same re- 
sult was obtained by treating cupric oxide (CuO) with the gas (H 2 S) 
in a glass tube at about 200° ; at a higher temperature 250° to 400° chal- 
cocite (CU 2 S) was formed. The other experiments were of a similar 
nature. 

Wells and Penfield, in connection with their investigation of the new 
mineral, gerhardtite (see a later page), were led to study the formation 
and characters of an artificial basic cupric nitrate, having the same 
composition with it, viz, 4CuO, N 2 O 5 , 3 H 2 O. The normal nitrate was 
heated with metallic copper in a sealed tube to about 150° C. for a day or 
more, the result being the formation of crystals of the compound named. 
These were tabular in habit, monoclinic in crystallization, but in di- 
mensions, as, too, in optical properties, remarkably near the ortho- 
rhombic gerhardtite. The axial ratios, for example, are : 


Gerhardtite a : b ; <5=0-9218 ; 1 : 1-1562, /3=90o 

Artificial compound a:l); 6=0-9178 : 1 : 1-4102, ( 3 = 85 ° 27 


Moreover, the cleavage corresponds, as also the plane of the optic 
axes ; the dispersion, double refraction, and pleochroism also are simi- 
lar. The same artificial compound, first correctly established by Ger- 
hardt, was also made by Wells by adding sodium acetate to a hot di- 
lute solution of cupric nitrate, boiling, then washing the precipitate in 
cold water; it consisted of minute crystals, having the same composition 
as that given.

SCIENTIFIC KECORD FOR 1885. 


De Scbulteii describes the formation of a hydrous phosphate of iron 
Fe2P208+4Aq. in rose-colored crystals, corresponding to the mineral 
strengite; strengite, however, is orthorhombic in crystallization, while 
these crystals were monoclinic. The same author has formed a magne- 
sium hydrate (the mineral brucite) in six-sided tabular, or short pris- 
matic crystals, optically uniaxial ; also a similarly crystallized cadmium 
hydrate. Vater describes crystals of hematite, formed in the fire flues 
in the chemical manufactory in Schbnebeck, near Madgeburg. Their 
formation is explained by the presence of pyrite and sodium chloride 
in the coal employed; from these iron chloride forms, which, in the cooled 
parts of the flues, is decomposed by the escaping water vapor with the 
result named. The crystals attain a magnitude of 3 millimeters. 

The natural alteration of minerals is another chapter of chemical 
mineralogy which has received some attention. F. W. Clarke and J. S 
Diller have studied the changes of the topaz of Stoneham, Me. Their 
investigations cover both the chemical and microscopical sides, the sec- 
tions under the microscope showing the progress of the alteration and 
the analyses what the results are. A series of analyses trace the 
changes from the unaltered topaz to the final product, massive or folia 
ted potash mica (damourite). The fluorine lost by the topaz is believed 
by the authors to have led to the formatiou of the fluorite, herderite, 
triplite, and apatite of the locality. Cathrein has studied the changes 
undergone by the garnets of the amphibole schists^of the Tyrolean Alps. 
The alterations described are very various, leading to the formatiou of 
scapolite, of epidote, oligoclase, hornblende, saussurite, and chlorite. 
Another interesting case of pseudomorphism is that of turquois after 
apatite. The specimens were from Taylor’s ranch on the Chowcilla 
River, in Fresno County, California, and they are described by G. E. 
Moore and V. von Zepharovich. The crystalline form of the original 
mineral is distinct, a hexagonal prism, but the substance consists of a 
greenish-blue or bluish-green aggregate of minute spherulites with 
radiated and concentric fibrous structure. An analysis showed it to be 
a hydrous phosphate of alumina, with a little iron, and about 8 per cent, 
cupric oxide, corresponding approximately to an analysis by Church of 
a turquois from Nichabur. Still another case of pseudomorphism im- 
portant especially in its geological relations is that of the thinoUte, the 
crystalline calcareous tufa of Lake Lahontau, in Northwestern Nevada. 
This occurs, as is w'ell known, on an immense scale, and the question of 
its origin is a vital one in the explanation of the geological changes of 
the region. It was referred to gay-lussite by Clarence King, but the 
writer shows from a crystallographic study of the forms remaining that 
it does not correspond to any known mineral, having a form which can 
be approximately referred to an acute tetragonal ijyramid. The simi- 
larity of this to the pseudomorphs of lead carbonate after phosgeuite 
(chloro-carbonate of lead) has suggested the hyi)othesis that the origi- 
nal mineral may have been an isomorphous chloro-carbonate ot calcium. 


MINERALOGY.

It is also shown that the well-known , but enigmatical “ barley corn” 
pseudomorphs after calcite from Sangerhausen very probably had the 
same origin. 

Still another case of pseudomorphism recently studied in detail is 
that of the rare mineral leucite, which is shown by Sauer to occur in 
an altered form extensively in the leucitophyr of the Saxon Erzgebirge. 
It is not found in a fresh state, but changed on the one hand to anal- 
cite and on the other to orthoclase and muscovite. Pseudomorphs of 
orthoclase from Magnet Cove, Arkansas, having the form of the familiar 
tetragonal trisoctahedron of garnet and leucite ( 2 - 2 ), have been referred 
to leucite by G. F. Kunz, but the subject requires further study before 
this suggestion can be accepted. 

Of memoirs on the chemical composition of minerals, that by Eam- 
melsberg on the scapolites deserves mention first. It follows the paper 
of Tschermak on the same subject, and while not removing all the diffi- 
culties from this most complex subject, it has at least the advantage 
that it does not deal so much with hypotheses as with facts. So far as 
can be explained in brief, his conclusion is that the various members 
of the scapolite group are to be regarded as combinations of the normal 
or meta silicates (bisilicates) Isra2Si03, CaSiOs, Al2Si30i, ; of the ortho- 
silicates (unisilicates) Na4Si04, Ca2Si04, Al2Si30i2, and of the subsili- 
cates ]S'a2Si20.5, CaSioOs, AbSieO],,. Friedl discusses the composition of 
staurolite, giving new analyses of some pure varieties, with special refer- 
ence to the oxidation of the iron. The formula adopted is that of a basic 
silicate with an oxygen ratio of 2 : 1 , viz, (Mg, re )6 Al 6 (A 10 )i 8 (OH)4 
(Si04)n. The rare Vesuvian mineral nocerine has been analyzed by 
Lederer with the result of proving, as shown by Fischer,that it is an 
oxy-fluoride of calcium and magnesium, with also aluminum, sodium, 
and potassium, but, perhaps, not as essential constituents. 

Dr. Genth’s last i)aper, entitled Contributions to Mineralogy, contains 
analyses of a number of interesting minerals, as joseite. galenobismutite, 
argentobismutite (Silberwismuthglanz), cosalite, schirmerite, beegerite, 
polybasite, vanadinite, annabergite, &c. Koenig has given new analy- 
ses of cosalite, alaskaite, and beegerite from Colorado. H. F. and H. A, 
Kellar have i)ublished an analysis of a variety of kobellite from Colo- 
rado, interesting in containing 5 to G per cent, of silver, but no antimony. 
Analyses of several common America n minerals are given by E. F. Smith, 
Knerr, and others in recent numbers of the American Chemical Journal. 
Claassen discusses in the same journal some vanadium-bearing magne- 
tites. Other chemical results are noted in the paragraphs immediately 
following. 

NEW MINERAL LOCALITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE. 

Perhaps the most intf'resting discovery of the year is that of the rare 
mineral, descloizite, in New Mexico, with also iodyrite, vanadinite, and 
endlichite. The locality is in Lake Valley, Donna Anna County, and 


696 


SCIENTIFIC KECOED FOR 1885. 


the new occurrences are described chemically by Gepth and crystallo- 
graphically by vom Eath. The descioizite occurs in minute brilliant 
orange-red crystals ; also in reddish chestnut-brown crystals up to 
in size and associated with j»silomelane and pyrolusite ; and finally in 
blackish-brown to black crystals, which are sometimes 0™“ in size. The 
specimens analyzed conformed to the accepted formula of the species. 
The crystals are varied in habit, chiefly pyramidal; they are in some cases 
quite higjily modifled and orthorhombic in crystallization. The results 
of vom Eath thus differ from those of Websky, who made the species 
monoclinic. The question is one of interest, since the form of several of 
the minerals belonging in this libetheuite-olivenite group is somewhat 
doubtful. It will probably be found that they are all orthorhombic. 
Descriptions are also given with analyses of the vanadinite and endli- 
chite (see in the list of new minerals), and Anally of the iodyrite. 

The mineral arsenopyrite or mispickel is now being mined in large 
quantity at Deloro, Hastings County, Ontario. During the past year 
crystallized specimens have been obtained from there showing the cru- 
ciform twins observed from other localities (e. g.^ the Binneuthal in Switz- 
erland). The “ fossil forest ” of Arizona has also been developed re- 
cently as a source of agatized wood ; beautiful polished specimens for 
table tops and other ornaments are now obtained from that source. A 
paper on the locality is given by G. F. Kunz, in a recent number of the 
Popular Science Monthly. Of more scientific interest is the disco verj' 
of zinc spinel, gahnite, at the pyrite mine in Eowe, Mass. Fine green 
octahedral crystals have been described and analyzed by A. G. Dana ; 
associated with it, besides the pyrite, are epidote and rutile. G. F. Kunz 
has described in some detail the occurrence of native antimony in York 
County, New Brunswick, and of various copper minerals in Arizona. 
W. P. Blake mentions the fact that erythrite is found at Lovelock’s Sta- 
tion, Union Pacific Eailroad, in Nevada ; also at the Kelsey mine, Comp- 
ton, in Los Angeles County, California. W. E. Hidden describes phena- 
cite from Florissant, El Paso County, Colorado ; xenotime from the 
same locality ; also a mineral assumed to be fayalite from Cheyenne 
Mountain, in the same State. The occurrence of minute crystals of fay- 
alite in the obsidian of the Yellowstone Park is described by W. P. Id- 
dings, as already noted. The same author, with Whitman Cross, shows 
that the otherwise rare mineral, allanite, is widely distributed as an ac- 
cessory microscopic constituent of many rocks. The work of Penfield 
on crystals of tiemannite from Utah and metacinnabarite from Cali- 
fornia has already been spoken of, as also that of O. W. Huntington 
on crystals of azurite from Arizona. The bulletin of Cross and Hille- 
brand, already alluded to, contains many points in regard to the min- 
erals of Colorado. 

Of new foreign occurrences the following may be briefly alluded to : 
Fairfleldite, at Eabenstein, Bavaria, identical with the imperfectly de- 
scribed leucomangapite; nephrite, near the orient al stone in character, at

Jordansmiihl, Silesia ; monazite in crystals in Cornwall; also the redis- 
covery of the very rare mineral connellite, also in Cornwall. The long- 
known localities in Dauphiny, of antimony, octahedrite,axinite, epidote, 
turnerite (monazite), &c., have been recently described by Groth, giving 
interesting facts in regard to the relations of the different species. 

NEW MINERALS. 

Avalite .* — This is announced by S. M. Losanitscli -as a new chromium 
silicate, but, as will be seen, the investigation is too incomplete to es- 
tablish its position as a new species very firmly. It is found at the 
mercury mines of Mount Avala, near Belgrade, Servia, associated with 
mercury, cinnabar, calomel, and so on. The material obtained for ex- 
amination consisted of a green earthy mass,' very impure, but from 
which, by repeated decantation and boiling with aqua regia, the clay, 
cinnabar, oxide of iron, &c., were separated, leaving only sand and 
chromite mixed with the mineral. This, partially purified, as described, 
was seen under the microscope to consist of thin crystalline plates of 
an emerald-green color. They were not attacked by acids, but were de- 
composed by hydrofluoric acid and also by fusion with an alkali carbo- 
nate ; upon ignition it turned brown. Three analyses were made, of 
which that made upon the purest material is as follows: 

SiOs Cr 20 j AI2O3 Fe203 K2O MgO H2O (hygr.) Ign. 

56 13 14-59 14-37 1-10 3-54 0 '^ 2-39 5-38 chromite 1-68 = 99-61 

Considering the nature of the material the attempt to calculate a for- 
mula is obviously of little use. 

Cappelenite . — A preliminary announcement only of this mineral is 
given by W. C. Brdgger. It is found in thick prismatic crystals, be- 
longing to the hexagonal system, with a vertical axis equal to 0.4301. 
The planes observed, prismatic, and basal with two pyramids, were well 
polished. The color was brown, without distinct pleochroism, and the 
luster on the fracture surfaces greasy ; the double refraction rather 
strong and the axis negative ; specific gravity, 4-407. An analysis by 
P. T. Cleve gave the following results : 

Si02 BjOs '^203 La2(Di2)03 €6203 Th02 BaO CaO Na20 K2O Ign.

It was found in a small vein in augite-syeuite, on Lille Ard, in the 
Langesunds fjord, Norway, a locality which has afforded a large number 
of rare minerals of unusual composition ; caiipelenite is not less remark- 
able in these respects, and a fuller description will be awaited with in- 
terest. 

ElpasoUte . — This name is given by Cross and Hillebrand to a fluoride 
of aluminum and potassium, found sparingly in small cavities in the 
massive pachnolite of Colorado (report for 1884). It was observed in

gave the following results :

The alkalies were determined approximately only, and hence no at- 
tempt is made to calculate a formula, but it is suggested that it may be 
regarded as a cryolite, in which two-thirds of the sodium are replaced 
by potassium. Further investigation is to be desired. The name is 
from the county El Paso, which embraces the greater part of the Pike’s 
Peak region, 

Undlichite.—Amovg the specimens from the newly-described locality 
of descloizite, in Lake Valley, New Mexico, was a vandiferous mimetite 
to which Dr. Genth has given the name Endlichite (after Dr. F. M. End- 
lich). Like the related isomorphous species, mimetite, vanadinite, and 
])yromorphite, it occurs in hexagonal prismatic crystals. These are mod- 
i fled by pyramidal planes, both being strongly striated . The crystals are 
also sometimes hollow. An analysis was first made (I) of crystals of a 
yellowish-white or pale straw-yellow color, the largest long and 0-5 
to 1-5““ thick. A second analysis was later made (II) of the same min- 
eral, occurring in groups of crystals having a columnar structure. The 
color varied from white to yellowish-white, straw yellow, and at the ex-

Gerliardtite . — A new copper mineral, unique in that it is the only 
nitrate thus far known in nature, except the soluble nitrates of sodium, 
magnesium, &c.; it is described by H. L. Wells and S. L. Penfield. 
Only a single specimen has as yet been identified ; this was from the 
United Verde copper mines, Jerome, Ariz., and consisted of pure mas- 
sive cuprite, inclosing in a crack the crystals of gerliardtite and a few 
acicular crystals of malachit^. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic 
system; they are pyramidal in habit, consisting of a zone of nine pyra- 
mids in oscillatory combination with the basal plane predominating, and 
the prism and a macrodonfe subordinate. There is a perfec: basal 
cleavage and also a second cleavage parallel the macropinacoid. The 
mineral is very soft (hardness= 2 ) and cleavage plates can be readily 
bent, then separating in the direction of the second cleavage. The 
specific gravity is 3*426. The color is dark green and the streak light

i^reeu ; transpareut. The optic axes lie in a plane parallel to the bracliy- 
ihnacoid, and the bisectrix is negative and normal to the basal plane ; 
the axial angle is large, 80° for green rays, measured in a solution of 
mercuric iodide in potassium iodide {n = 1-722). The pleochroism is 
distinct. An analysis yielded the following results: 

N 2 OS CnO H 2 O 

22-76 66-38 11-26 = 100-40 

The formula calculated, viz, 40u0, J7205, SHzO, requires N2O5 22-52, 
CuO 66-22, H2O 11-56 = 100, agreeing closely with the results of analy- 
sis. The mineral is named after the chemist who first determined the 
true composition of the corresponding artificial compound. This arti- 
ficial salt, as noted on a previous page, has also been made by Wells 
and Penfield and shown to crystallize in the monoclinic system 5 the form, 
however, is rather closely related to that of the orthorhombic gerhard- 
tite. 

Graphitoid . — This name has been given by Sauer to a substance which 
he regards as amorphous carbon. It occurs extensively in the mica 
schists and phyllites of the Saxon Erzgebirge. It forms loose incrusta- 
tions on the surfaces of the schist, shows no crystalline structure, and 
burns with comparative rapidity in a Bunsen burner. An analysis of 
the combustible substance gave — carbon, 99-76; hydrogen, 0-24=100; 
showing that it is essentially pure carbon. Besides occurring as an in- 
crustation it also impregnates the rock mass, forming fine bands of mi- 
nute particles passing in parallel directions through the irregular quartz 
grains. The author recognizes the fact that true graphite is also a 
common constituent of many archseau rocks, but suggests that with it 
the graphitoid may also be present. A related form of amorphous car- 
bon was described a few years ago by von Inostranzetf, also from phyl- 
lite. 

Hanksite . — A new anhydrous sulphato-carbonate of sodium, described 
by W, E. Hidden, obtained from San Bernardino County, California, 
where it occurs with thenardite, borax, &c. It is named after Mr. 
Henry G. Hanks, State mineralogist of California. Hanksite crystallizes 
in the hexagonal system, the crystals being short hexagonal prisms 
with one or two pyramids and the basal plane; they sometimes form 
confused groups of tabular six-sided crystals. Optically it is uniaxial, 
negative. The hardness is 3 — 3-5, and the specific gravity 2-562. The 
color is white, inclining to yellow; the crystals nearly transparent, 
though sometimes inclosing impurities. An analysis by J. B. Mackin- 
tosh gave the results under I, below ; another analysis by S. L. Penfield, 
made two years since upon a large crystal from California (exact locality 
unknown), is given under II .

The chloride of sodium (or potassium) shown in the analyses is prob- 
ably present as impurity. Excluding this the composition becomes; 
4Na2S04 + ]Na2C03, which requires l!fa2S04 84’27, ]Sra2CU3 16-73 = 100. 

Hydrogiobertite (Idrogiobertite). — As the name indicates (from 
tcater, and giobertite, a synonym of magnesite), this is a new hydrous 
carbonate of magnesium ; it is from A^esuvius, and is described by Eu- 
genio Scacchi. The mineral was found in the interior of a mass of 
augitophyre, in the neighborhood of Pollena. It appears in spherical 
forms from 2 to 15 millimeters in diameter. These have a compact tex- 
ture and a light gray color. The specific gravity varies from 2-149— 
2-174. Small crystals of magnetite are imbedded in the spheres, both in 
the surface and in the mass. Two analyses were made, with the follow- 
ing results : 

CO 2 MgO H 2 O 
25-16 44-91 29-93=100 

25-29 44-28 30-43=100 

Both analyses have been calculated to 100, after deducting the small 
amount of impurity present (magnetite, «&c.). They correspond closely 
to the formula Mg2C04-f 3aq, which requires: CO2 24-72, MgO 44-94, 
H2O 30-34=100. The nearest related minerals are hydro-magnesite 
(Mg4030io-|- 4aq) and the doubtful lancasterite. 

Ldvenite (or Lovenite ). — This new mineral, also announced by W. C. 
Brbgger, is like cappeleiiite (above), from an island in the Langesunds 
fjord, Norway. It is found in prismatic crystals belonging to the 
monoclinic system. The axial ratio deduced is, a : 6 : c : = 1-0811 : 1 : 
0-8133, and the obliquity /? = 71° 24J' ; the form, consequentljq is some- 
what related to that of pyroxene. The cleavage is perfect parallel to 
the orthopinacoid. The optic axes lie in the plane of symmetry, the 
acute bisectrix being inclined forward about 20J° to the vertical axis. 
The color is chestnut-brown to yellowish, with marked pleochroism. 
The specific gravity is 3-51. An analysis by P. T. Gleve gave : 

Si 02 ZrOj Fe203 (?) MnO CaO NaaO ign. 

33-71 31-65 5-64 5-06 11-00 11-32 1 03 = 99-41 

It is somewhat related in composition to the hexagonal cataiileiite, 
but contains less silica. 

Pi/iwoite.— Described by H. Staute as a new magnesium borate. It is 
probably to be regarded only as a decomposition product of boracite. 
It occurs at Stassfurt intimately associated with white earthy boracite. 
It has au even fracture with a glistening surface, and sometimes shows 
traces of a fibrous structure ; magnified slightly it appears fine-granular 
to compact, with occasional crystalline planes. The color is sulphur- 
yellow to straw-yellow, sometimes pistache-green; also at times it has a 
grayish or reddish tinge. The hardness is 3 to 4; the specific gravity 
2-27. The mean of several analyses by Staute and Stromeyer gave: 

B 2 O 3 MgO H 2 O Fe Cl 
[42-50J 24-45 3285 0-15 0-18

Other analyses of different samples gave concordant results, all agree- 
ing with the formula MgB 204 + 3 H 2 O, which requires : B 2 O 342 G 9 , MgO 
24-39, H 2 O 32-92. 

Polyarsenite-SarTcinite . — These are two minerals described independ- 
ently by different authors, from different localities, and yet very closely 
related, if not identical. Polyarsenite, named by Igelstrom in allusion 
to its large amount of arsenic, is from the Sjb mines in the Grythyt- 
tan parish, Sweden. It has a yellowish-red color,, is transparent, but 
shows no crystalline form and no cleavage ; an optical examination by 
Bertrand shows that it is biaxial, with an angle of 83° and a negative 
bisectrix ; specific gravity 4-085. It is found in granular form, associated 
with a little barite, and also hematostibiite in veins in calcite embedded 
in tephroite. An analysis by Soderbaum is given below. 

SarMnite, named by A. Sjogren from adpxivoc (bloody, fat), with a 
double allusion to its blood-red color and greasy luster, is from the iron- 
manganese mines of Pajsberg, Sweden. Its hardness is 4 to 5, and 
specific gravity 4-14. Two cleavages were observed, but no crystals 
were found, and the system is thus in doubt; optically, however, it is 
biaxial. An analysis was made by C. H. Luudstrom, and for the sate 
of comparison it is placed beside that of polyarsenite.

For the former Cleve calculates 4MnO, AS 2 O 5 + H 2 O, which requires: 
AS 2 O 5 43-23, MnO 53-38, H 2 O 3-39 = 100. 

Uintahite — This name has been given by W. P. Blake to a peculiar 
variety of asphaltum which occurs in considerable quantities in the 
Uintah Mountains. It is obtained in masses several inches in diameter ; 
it breaks with a conchoidal fracture, is brittle and easily reduced to 
powder in a mortar. The hardness is 2 to 2-5, and the specific gravity 
1-065 to 1-070. The color is black and the surface brilliant and lustrous. 
It fuses easily^in the flame of a candle and burns with a brilliant flame, 
resembling sealing-wax, and like this it gives a clean, sharp impression 
with a seal. It gives off upon distillation a small quantity of a clear 
white dense oil and a little vapor. It is soluble in heavy lubricating 
petroleum, while the lighter products of the petroleum do not affect it. 
It is soluble also in warm oil of turpentine, but not in ordinary alcohol, 
nnd in ether only when powdered. In melted wax it dissolves, forming- 
on cooling a hard black mixture resembling ‘‘burnt wax.” It is sug- 
gested that it may prove to be useful in various ways in the arts. A 
more complete chemical examination is needed to establish its true 
character.

INTEODUCTOET NOTE. 

The same general plan has been followed as last year, alchough the 
scope of the work has been somewhat enlarged so as to include also re- 
views and bibliographic notices of pal®ontologic works ; mere mentions 
of works by title have not been referred to. I have experienced some 
difficulty in getting hold of all the recent publications in time for inser- 
tion in tbis record, and there are doubtless some omissions. I shall be 
much obliged if those who notice them will call my attention to them 
so that they may be inserted next year. I wish to thank all those who 
have kindly aided me iu collectiug this material, and especially Mr. H. 
M. Ami, of the Canadian Survey, and Mr. G. E. Beecher, of the New 
York State Museum at Albany.

Three discoveries of fossils were announced. Prof. N. H. Winchell 
brought from the pipe-stone quarry of Minnesota a contorted trilobite of 
the Paradoxides type and slabs of sandstone covered with round phos- 
phatic brachiopods referred provisionally to Lingula. Prof. W. B. 
Dwight reported the discovery of a unique Potsdam locality one mile 
northwest of Vassar College and in the Wappinger limestone belt. 
Prof. J. D. Dana exhibited Silurian fossils taken at Canaan, N. Y., from 
the sparry limestone of Emmons, a member of his original Taconic sys- 
tem as first defined by him in 1842. Prof. James Hall said that the 
existence of Silurian fossils in these rocks was claimed and admitted 
forty years ago, and Prof. N. H. Winchell argued that Emmons’s later 
use of the title “Taconic,” in which he applied it to certain rocks in 
New York, now known to be pre-Silurian, entitled the name to a place 
in stratigraphic nomenclature.

Communicated to the Eoyal Society of Canada at its meeting in Ot- 
tawa, May, 1885. Sir William Dawson describes the new species Wal- 
chia imbricatula from the Trias; Sir William concludes that Mr. Bain’s 
lower series is distinctly permo-Carboniferous ; that its extent is con- 
siderably greater than was supposed in 1871 ; that there is a well char- 
acterized overlying Trias, and that the intermediate series, whether 
Permian or Lower Triassic, is of somewhat difficult local definition; but 
that its fossils, so far as they go, lean to the Permian side.

Twenty six new species of invertebrates are described in this paper, 
wliich is dixided under the following heads, viz : 

(1) Bibliography of the formations here discussed, viz, the Genesee, 
the ifaples, the Portage, and the High Point Chemung rocks of New 
York. 

(2) The Petrographic and Palseontologic Characters of the Genesee 
Beds. 

(3) Eeview of the Fauna and Flora of the Genesee Shales. Here the 
following new species are described : Goniatites nodifer, BeyricMa Ba- 
gon, Goniatites astarte, Orthoceras Stehos, 0. Mephisto, 0. Asmodeus, 
Platyostoma Belial, Loxbnema (?) Moloch, Modiomorpha (?) Ghemos, Spiri- 
fera Belphegor, IS. Pluto, Leiorynchus (?) Hecate. 

(4) The Petrographic and Palmontologic Characters of the Naples 
Beds. 

(5) Eeview of the Fauna and Flora of the Naples Beds. Here the 
following new species are described : Ceratiocaris simplex, C. Beecheri, 
Echinocaris Whitjieldi, Goniatites Liitheri, Orthoceras aciculoides, 0. On- 
tario, 0. filosum, Bellerophon incisus, Trochus (Palceotrochus) prcecursor, 
Platyostoma (?) minutissimum, Loxonema Hoe, Hyolithes Napolis, Lingula 
triquetra, Aulopora annectens. 

(6) The Petrographic and Palseontologic Characters of the Portage 
Beds. 

(7) A List of the Fossils occurring in the Genesee, Naples, and Portage 
Beds of Ontario County, with the names of species heretofore identified 
from the horizons elsewhere in the State of New York, but not as yet 
known within this district. From these tables he concludes that the 
Naples shales have no such palseontologic relation to the rocks of the 
Chemung period as to justify the union of them with these rocks; that 
their fauna and flora is more closely allied to those of the Hamilton 
shales, and that therefore these beds are to be regarded either as con- 
stituting the upijermost member of the Hamilton period or, together 
with the Genesee shales, representing a distinct geological epoch. The 
more probable conclusion is that these two groups of strata represent 
the epoch of the lower Upper-Devonian in Western New York. 

(8) Fauna of Chemung Beils at High Point. It is unfortunate that 
six of the new species described are not illustrated in any manner.

(1) Eemarks on certain criticisms by Prof. James Hall, of Albany, in 
the preface to volume G7 of the Pennsylvania reports, on the palmonto- 
logical i)ortion of tlie work in the volume. Mr. Claypole states that 
there is no doubt that in Perry County spirifers, unbroken and with both 
valves in contact, are found about 1 ,000 feet above red sandstone beds 
liolding the scales of Holoptychius or Bothriolepis or both. (2) The au- 
tlior states that Spirifera dlsjuncta, S.mesocostaMs, 8. mesostrialis, though.

SCIENTIFIC EECORD FOR 1885. 


certaiu zones, are not by any means limited to these zones, but invade 
each other’s territory to an undefined extent ; and that Spirifera Icevis 
occurs in Middle Pennsylvania higher than the Portage group in the 
Chcimung proper, and in company with 8. mesocosialis (?) (3) The author 
doubts whether there is any distinct character by which Orthis tuUiensis 
can be separated from 0. impressa, and he states on Professor Williams’s 
authority that there is in New York an Orthis which cannot be distin- 
guished from O. tulUensis, occurring not at/ 200 feet only, but at a yet 
greater height (less than 500 feet) above the Genesee shale. (4) The 
author states that there is no doubt that Halysites catenulatus occurs 
in the Lower Helderberg limestone at the place mentioned by Prof. I. 
C. White, and that there is no doubt as to the stratigraphical position 
of the bed in which it occurs. (5) The author concludes that all at- 
tempts to confine the range of species within certain arbitrary limits 
are attempts that are not likely to succeed, and that the artificial sys- 
tems of palaeontology which have been constructed by the faithful, earn- 
est, and devoted labors of the students of the science are but tempo- 
rary.

Calls attention to the lack of post-tertiary changes that have occurred 
in the species of the Atlantic slope and to the striking changes in those 
of the Pacific slope, even in recent times and presumably ever since 
the Tertiary epochs. He mentions the occurrence of similar changes 
on the islands and some parts of the main land of Western Europe and 
Africa, and says: “In searching for a common cause of variations af- 
fecting the west slopes of both continents similarly, we arrive at the 
conclusion that it is change of climate, produced by Tertiary and recent 
geological action, and are obliged to admit that such action is still go- 
ing on.” The absence of such action to any marked extent on the At- 
lantic slope of the United States he considers the cause of the lack of 
any changes in the land shells there.

Criticises Mr. Charles Morris’s view that the earliest animals, like the 
youngest stage of animal life generally, had no hard parts to preserve, 
and that the sudden appearance of tribes was simply the appearance 
of species having hard or stony secretions. One difficulty in the way 
of the theory is presented by the existence of limestone formations of 
great extent in the Archean which most geologists suppose to be of or- 
ganic origin, and the existence also of phosphate of lime in large quan- 
tities which also is material of possible organic origin. {See Morris, 
Charles.)

with no change except a crystallization of the calcite, common in the 
fossils of newer formations, and with the cavities filled with a hydrous 
silicate, which was evidently in process of deposition on the sea-bot- 
tom on which Eozoon is supposed to have lived.

Sir William proposes for the beds containing it the name of Kootanie 
group. They can be traced for a distance of 140 miles north and south 
in the troughs of the palaeozoic formations of the mountains. The plants 
found are conifers, cycads, and ferns, the cycads being especially

XXXIII, pp. 32-34. 1885. London and New York. 

From the advance sheets of a memoir to appear in the Transactions 
of the Royal Society of Canada. The author first discusses the geologi- 
cal relations of the fioras, and gives, on page 33, a table showing the 
“ successive floras and subfloras of the Cretaceous in Canada (in de- 
scending order ”). This table ranges from the Upper Laramie or Porcu- 
pine Hill series, containing the Platanus beds of Souris Eiver, Calgary, 
down to theNeocomien (?) Kootanie series of the Eocky Mountains, con- 
taining cycads, pines, and terns. The author then dicussesthe physical 
conditions and climate indicated by the Cretaceous floras.

An abstract of a paper read before the Eoyal Society of Canada, May, 
1885. The paper refers more particularly to a remarkable Jurasso-Cre- 
taceous flora recently discovered by Dr. G. M. Dawson in the Eocky 
Mountains, and to intermediate groups of plants between this and the 
Middle Cretaceous, serving to extend greatly our knowledge of the 
Lower Cretaceous flora, and to render more complete the series of plants 
between this and the Laramie. {See Dawson, Sir WiUiam.)

Considers the flora of the Laramie group to be that of the newest 
Cretaceous. Describes a new flora of Jurasso-Cretaceous age found by 
Dr. G. M. Dawson, which undoubtedly represents the flora of the lowest 
Cretaceous, which has not hitherto been recognized in Western America, 
and proposes to name it the Kootanie series. The following new forms 
are described : Dicksonia sp., Asplenium Martinianum, Zamites Montana, 
Z., sp., Sphenozamites sp., Salisburia {Gingko) nana, Taonurus incertus ; 
from the intermediate series, Sterculia vetustula; from the Mill Creek

(Abstract.) Gives a list of the Waverly genera of fossils. Without 
any apparent want of conformity the Waverly follows the Chemung, but 
at the point in the section marked “Place of the Catskill” there is a hia- 
tus which, in Eastern New York and Pennsylvania, is marked by the 
presence of measures having a thickness of from 3,000 to 5,000 feet- 
Therefore we have a right to conclude that there has been a long inter- 
val in time between the final deposition of the barren Chemung shales 
and the fossiliferous Waverly sandstone, or that the deposition of the 
estuary Catskill sediments has been going on simultaneously with the 
open sea deposits of the Waverly formation.

spect to the transition of so-called species from one of the stages to 
another, but emphatically agrees with Heilprin as to the impossibility 
of subverting the accumulative stratigraphic evidence, to the effect that 
the relative superposition of the- several principal stages — the Buhr- 
stone, Claiborne, Jackson, and Vicksburg groups — cannot be otherwise 
than as heretofore ascertained in hundreds of localities by others as 
well as by himself.

Criticises Dr. Otto Meyer’s views as expressed in the June and July 
numbers of this journal. Does not attach much importance to Plagi- 
ostoma dumosum as a significant fossil. Considers Area Mississippiensis 
as the most characteristic Vicksburg fossil. For the Jackson age the 
most constant fossil is the Zeuglodon and also Venericardia planicosta, 
which has nowhere been found associated with the characteristic Vicks- 
burg fauna. Through this widely diffused and universally recognized 
shell, as well as through the almost equally constant Gastridium veins- 
turn and CalyptropJiorus velatus as common fossils, the Jackson fauna 
connects strikingly with the Claiborne and Buhrstone beds, and the 
author has found this Venericardia in the latter in almost immediate 
contact with the Upper Cretaceous rocks of North Mississippi. Upon 
Dr. Meyer’s assumption, the Vicksburg beds, void of both of the above 
types, would actually be intercalated between this oldest post-Creta- 
ceous fauna and the Claiborne and Jackson beds. However, his as- 
sumption is abundantly and conclusively disproved by the most direct 
stratigraphical evidence.

States that a certain form is ar Myalothis, allied to M. undulatus Bar- 
raude. The aspect of a syphon is due to the compression of the sharper 
against the flatter side and the form of the sutures, which favors this 
impression. These fossils with their distinct septa are remarkably similar 
to certain forms of Nautiloidea, but there is no syphon. They, how- 
ever, confirm Von Jhernig’s and the author’s opinion that the Orthocera- 
tites and Pteropods have had a common, but as yet undiscovered, an- 
cestor in ancient times.

The hypothesis of the common but independent origin of types is also 
supported by all collateral evidences. The results of palaeontologic re- 
search have carried back the origin of distinct types farther and farther 
every year. It is now established that there was an excessively sud- 
den appearance of vast numbers of forms in the Cambriam or perhaps 
earlier, as claimed by Prof. J. Marcou. The author has applied this 
specific statement as a generalization to the history of smaller groups 
of fossils in several branches of the animal kingdom, and in many for- 
mations, and has found that the sudden appearance of the smaller 
groups occurs according to the same law. The early geologic history 
of animal life, like the early stages of development in the embryo, was 
a more highly concentrated and accellerated process in evolution than 
that which occurred at any subsequent period of the earth’s history. 
The great mass of life as shown by the fossils has been progressive, 
and the progress was similar to that of the individual from a more gen-

eralized to more aud more specialized conditions and structures. The 
primitive stocks, like the primitive Metazoa, the Porifera, were certainly 
much more variable and unstable than the later and more complicated 
forms, which are more stable and Jess susceptible of change. Thus, 
when radical changes become necessary in order to sustain the life of 
the species of a group, they die out as did the Ammonites, or decay as 
did the Uautiloids, and exhibit most clearly the stability they have ac- 
quired as progressive forms in their inability to meet the requirements 
of diflerent modern conditions.

Describes the new species Cruziana Carleyi, and finishes reviewing 
the already described fossil algm of the group. The author concludes 
that there is not a single one entitled to remain in the class. They are 
referred to three different sources: first, inorganic causes ; second, to 
trails and burrows ; third, and last, to the Hydrozoa.

it is unreasonable to expect to find any.

. The author holds that Ehizomorpha sigillarice Lesquereux is not a 
fungus, but the burrow left under the bark by the grub of some one of 
the species of insects flourishing at the time of the deposition of the 
coal, and refers to the burrows made by species of Scolytus under the 
bark of species of hickory as possessing the same characteristics and 
appearances as the fossil.

ber, 1885. Cincinnati. 

The author considers that Ormathicuus Miller is not the track made 
by a Gasteropod, but was really made by a crinoid stem. The author 
thinks this is shown conclusively by a specimen found near Cincinnati 
by Mr. U. P. James containing a part of the crinoid stem which he con- 
siders made the mark. The genus Walcottia Miller and Dyer, two of 
whose species are considered as crinoid-stem impressions, and the third 
as probably a burrow, is “ consigned to the limbo of the improbable.”

This important work was not published till February, 1885, although 
it bears the imprint 1883. It is divided into four parts, as follows, viz : 

I. The flora of the Dakota group: 

(1) General remarks. Concludes that the first appearance and ap- 
parent simultaneous multiplication of the dicotyledonous plants remains 
a fact inconceivable to reason. 

(2) Description and enumeration of species of the American Dakota 
group formation. The following new species are described : Equisetum 
nodosum, Podozamites oblongus, P. prcelongus, P. emarginatus, P. cauda- 
tus, Torreya oblanceolata, Thuites crassus, Myrica Sternbergii, Quercus 
dakotensis, Q. morrisoniana. Ficus Beckwithii, F. ? angustata, F. magno-

(3) Table of distribution of the plants of the Cretaceous Cenomanian 
formation. 

(4) Relationship of the flora of the Dakota group. The author con- 
cludes that the marked analogy in the components of the floras author- 
izes the conclusion of equivalency of the age of the Dakota group with 
that of the Quader sandstone of Germany, which is as positively de- 
termined as Cenomanian by its animal fossils as the Dakota group is 
recognized as Middle Cretaceous by the invertebrate remains which 
abound in the strata of the Fort Benton group immediately overlying it.

II. Flora of the Laramie group : 

(1) States that the flora has a relation, remarkably well defined, with 
that of Sezanne. Says that the age of the Laramie group of Hayden is 
not yet definitely determined. The flora, like the invertebrate fauua, is 
on the whole of a peculiar character, uniformily distributed over the 
whole extent of the formation, and free from any types or characters 
relating it to the Cretaceous flora. As the Laramie group has never 
been subjected to submersion in the deep sea, the few remains of Dino 
saurians found in it are derived from low marine lagoons penetrating 
into the land, and cannot impress the formation with the Cretaceous 
character. 

(2) Table of distribution of the species of the Laramie group. 

(3) Description of species added to the flora of the Laramie group. 
The following new species are described : Osmunda major, Oreodoxites 
plicatus, Aralia pungens, Anona robusta, Zizyphus Beckwithii, Bhamnus 
deformatus. 

III. The flora of the Green Eiver group : 

(1) Geological distribution of the measures. 

(2) Enumeration and description of the species of fossil plants known 
from th.e Green Eiver group. The following new species are described: 
Chara f glomerata, Fontinalis pristina, Isoetes hrevifolins, Sphenopteris 
Guyottii, Adiantites gracilUmus, Finns Florissanti, Widdringtonia linguce- 
folia, Cyperites Haydcnii,Potamogeton f verticillatus,Nojadopsis rugulosa,

(3) General remarks. Table of distribution of the plants of the Green 
River and White River groups. 

(4) Relationship of the local groups indicated by correlation of spe- 
cies. The plants which have heretofore been referred by the author to 
the Green River group represent two different horizons : Green River 
Station, Randolph Company, and Alkali Station for one, Florissant, 
White River, and Elko for a second. The materials obtained at the first 
are too scant to afford any indication of their reference to any particular 
stage of the Tertiary ; they may represent a lower group than that of 
the Florissant, but what is said of the relationship of these plants au- 
thorizes a contrary conclusion. Considers the flora of Florissant prob- 
ably synchronous with that of the Oligocene of France. 

IV. Miocene flora : 

(1) Description of Miocene species from specimens obtained in the 
so-called Bad Lands of Dakota. The following are new species : Asple- 
nium tenerum, Equisetum glubosum, Quercus Dentoni, Ficus artocarpoides, 
Tetranthera prcecursoria, Cinchonidium ovale, Viburnum dalcotense, V. 
Eentoni, Aralia acerifolia, Acer gracilescens, Rhus Winchellii, Prunus 
dahotensis, Cercis truncata. 

(2) Description of Miocene species of California and Oregon. The 
following species are new : Betula parce-dentata, Alnus corrallina, A. car- 
pinoides, Quercus Breweri, Ulnus pseudo-americana. Ficus asimincefolia, 
Laurus grandis, L. salicifolia, L. californica, Orewia auriculata, Ailan- 
thus ovata, Myrtus oregonensis, Colutea boweniana. 

(3) Contributions to the Miocene flora of Alaska. The following spe- 
cies are new: Thuites (Chamcecyparis) AlasTcensis, Comptonia cuspidata, 
C. prcemissa, Betula Alaskana, Alnus corylifolia, Quercus Ballii. 

(4) Species of plants from the chalk bluffs of California. 

(5) Table of distribution of the 2forth American Miocene fossil plants. 

(6) Remarks on the species of Miocene plants. The author concludes 
that as the fossil floras of Carbon and the Bad Lands are related by 
ten identical species, and those of the Bad Lands and Alaska by thir- 
teen, these three groups apparently represent the same stage of the 
North American Miocene. The flora of Carbon has only four species 
identified in that of Alaska, but their lesser degree of affinity may be 
ascribed to difference in latitude.

Many lists of fossils are given. The “Taconic System” comprehends 
all the strata in which the Primordial faunae are found. These faunae 
are three in number. The Infra-Primordial, including the most ancient 
fossils of Newfoundland, among which as yet no trilobite has been found 
with certainty. The Primordial fauna, properly so-called, that of Bo- 
hemia and Scandinavia, and which is represented in America by the 
Paradoxides and Olenellus beds. The Supra-Primordial fauna, found 
at Hof, in Bavaria, at Vestfosen, near Christiania, in Norway, and else- 
where in Europe. On Lake Champlain it includes certain colonies of 
the second fauna of Barrande, and is terminated by the “Potsdam sand- 
stone,” including the “ Saratoga limestone,” with Primordial fossils dis- 
covered by Walcott.

foundland, in company with species of Agnostus, A.;punctuosus Ang., A. 
Icevigatus Dalm., A. Acadicus Hartt (var. declivis Matthew). These fos- 
sils indicate a new horizon in the Paradoxides beds of America some- 
what above that of Braintree, or the known horizons of Newfoundland 
and New Brunswick. [It may also occur in the Cambrian slate of 
Saint John, New Brunswick,]

some of the premises of which many people will disagree. The author

sible until, after a long period of evolution, the power of secreting hard

external coverings was gained. The author says that there can be no 
question that the trilobite had foes stronger than hinaself, against whom 
he found defense only in his chitinous armor,” but he says nothing of 
the necessity of weapons of attack in. these supposed foes.

tion. Froc. Acad. Nat. 8ei., Philad., vol. — , pp. 385-392. December, 
1885. Philadelphia. 

Early fossilization is due to the preservation of the dermal skeletons 
of animals of considerably advanced organization, and those were proba- 
bly preceded during a long era by soft-bodied forms of low organization. 
Yet, after the advent of armored animals, it is probable that the seas 
were still tenanted by numerous soft-bodied forms, mainly swimmers, 
the progenitors of the many naked ocean swimmers which still exist. 
Later the tendency is no longer to assume armor, but to throw it off 
and return toward the unprotected condition. Finally, in the human 
species, even the covering of hairs is nearly lost, and in external condition 
the highest form of animal life approaches the lowest. The armored 
cephalopods have gradually disappeared till only the AaMtiZws remains. 
The unarmoied forms have rapidly increased until they abundantly 
people the modern seas. The changes described have taken place under 
the influence of one of the most active agents in evolution, that of the 
reciprocal influence of attack and defense on animal structure. Thus 
we seem to perceive four successive ideas emerging into prominence in 
the development of the animal kingdom. In the primaeval epoch it is 
probable that only soft-bodied animals existed, and the weapons of as- 
sault were the tentacle, the thread cell, the sucking disk, and the like 
uniudurated weapons. At a later period armor became generally 
adopted for defense, and the tooth became the most efiicient weapon of 
attack, till later armor was discarded, and flight or concealment be- 
came the main method of escape, and swift pursuit the principle of at- 
tack, while claws were added to teeth as assailing weapons. Finally, 
mentality came into play, intelligence became the most efficient agent 
both in attack and defense, and a special development of the mind be- 
gan. 

The article is so condensed as to render it difficult to give a brief sy- 
nopsis of it.

what has ordinarily been supposed, the Vicksburg being the oldest, 
and the Claiborne the most recent formation. The article is divided

Packard, A. S. — The Syncarida, a Group of Carboniferous Crustacea. 
Amer. Nat.y vol. xix, pp. 700-703. July 1, 1885. Philadelphia. 
Presents the conclusions of a paper read at the last meeting of the 
National Academy of Sciences. The author considers the Syncarida as 
a suborder, standing near or at the base of the Thoracostraca, not far 
from the Stomapoda and Schizopoda, and with appendages closely homo- 
logous with those of these two groups. In their lack of a carapace and 
in the well formed dorsal arch of the seven thoracic segments, we are 
obliged to consider them as an annectant group, pointing to the exist- 
ence of some extinct group which may have still more closely connected 
the sessile-eyed and stalk-eyed Crustacea.

Fossil Schizopod Crustacea. Amer. Nat., vol. xix, pp. 790-793. Au- 
gust, 1885. Philadelphia. 

Abstract of a paper read at the April meeting of the National Acad- 
emy of Sciences. The study of about a dozen specimens of Falceocaris 
typus Meek and Wbrthen, has led the author to compare the genus with 
Gampsonyx, and the result has led to the formation of a family or higher 
group for the two genera, which should properly stand at the base of 
the Schizopoda, while also serving to bridge over the chasm existing 
beween the thoracostracous suborders Syncarida and Schizopoda. This 
group may be called Gampsonychidce. The principal character which 
separates this group from all other schizopods is the entire absence of a 
carapace. When we compare the Gampsonychidce with the Syncaridce 
(Acanthotelson) we see that both groups have the same number of body 
segments and that both lack a carapace ; and thus while the Gampsony- 
chidcB are the ancestors of living schizopods, the group as a whole proba- 
bly descended from Acanthotelson, which is thus a truly synthetic form, 
standing in an ancestral relation to all the Thoracostraca, while it also 
suggests that the sessile-eyed and stalk-eyed Crustacea may have had 
a common parentage.

Macrurous Decapod Crustacea, allied to the Eryonid®. Amer. Nat, 
vol. XIX, pp. 880, 881. September, 1885. Philadelphia. 

Abstract of an article read before the National Academy of Sciences 
in April, 1885. The author has had opportunity of studying specimens 
of Anthrapalcemon gracilis Meek and Worthen. The newly observed 
characters are the carapace with its rostrum, showing that the Ameri- 
can species in these respects closely resembles the European ones fig- 
ured by Salter, the founder of the genus. Moreover, specimens show 
the entire thoracic legs, while the antenn® of both pairs were almost 
entirely shown. The fact that the first pair of thoracic feet were scarcely 
larger than the succeeding pairs shows that Anthrapalcemon cannot be 
placed in the Eryonidce, but should form the type of a distinct group 
of family rank, none of the existing Macrura having such small anterior

legs. At the same time the Oarbouiferous Anthracaridw were lirobably 
the forerunners or ancestors of the Mesozoic and later JEryonidce. From 
the nature of the difterentiation of the telson in the OalatheidcB the 
author is inclined to believe, from -what he has observed from the speci- 
mens before him, that the telson of Anthrapalcemon is subdivided in 
nearly the same manner. If so, the genus cannot be referred to the 
Eryonidce, and should therefore be regarded as the type of a distinct 
family, which he calls Anthracaridce, and briefly characterizes.

ScuDDER, S. H. — The Eelations of the Palaeozoic Insects. Ayjier. Nat., 
vol. XIX, pp. 876-878. September, 1885. Philadelphia. 

Abstract of a paper read by Mr. S. H. Scudder at the April, 1885, 
meeting of the National Academy of Sciences. The author states that 
while we may recognize in the Palaeozoic rocks insects which were plainly 
precursors of existing Heterometabola, we may yet not call these Orthop- 
tera, Neuroptera, &c., since ordinal features were not differentiated; but 
all Palaeozoic insects belonged to a single order which, enlarging its 
scope, as outlined by Goldenberg, we m^jcdMPalmodietyoptera; in other 
words, the Palaeozoic insect was a generalized Hexapod, or more par- 
ticularly a generalized Heterometabolon. Ordinal differentiation had 
not begun in Palaeozoic times. 

We find, then, that the entire change from the generalized hexapod 
to the ordinarily specialized hexapod was made in the interval between 
the close of the Palaeozoic period and the middle, we may say, of the 
Mesozoic. These significant changes were ushered in with the dawn of 
the Mesozoic period, and the Triassic rocks became naturally (together

with the Silurian) the most important, the expectant ground of the stu- 
dent of palaeontology. 

It would then appear that the geological history of winged insects, so 
far as we know from present indications, may be summed up in a very 
few words. Appearing in the Silurian period, insects continued through- 
out Palaeozoic times as a generalized form of Heterometabola, which, for 
convenience, we have called Palceodictyopteraj and which had the front 
wings as well as the hind wings membranous. 

On the advent of Mesozoic times a great differentiation took place, 
and before its middle all the orders, both of Heterometahola and Metabola, 
were fully developed in all their essential features as they exist to-day; 
the more highly organized Metabola at first in feeble numbers, but to-day, 
and even in Tertiary times, as the prevailing types. The Metabola have 
from the first retained the membranous character of the front wings, 
while in most of the Heterometabola, which were more closely and di- 
rectly connected with Palaeozoic types, the front wings were, even in 
Mesozoic times, more or less completely differentiated from the hind 
wings as a sort of protection covering to the latter, and these became 
the principal organs of flight.

pods and Arachnids, in Psyche). Amer. Nat, vol. xix, pp. 1210, 1211. 

December, 1885. Philadelphia. 

An abstract of Mr. Scudder’s article in Psyche. 

The great ArcMpolypoda resemble the Piplopoda in having two pairs 
of legs on every segment ; while in the Protosygnatha only a single pair 
of legs is borne by each segment, and the group thus resembles the 
CJiilopoda. For a brief period after leaving the egg, modern diplopods 
and pauropods have a shorter body than in after life, and the first three 
segments bear but a single pair of legs. In adult life these first three 
segments still bear but a single pair of limbs, while all the other seg- 
ments, both those which exist in the larval state and those which de- 
velop afterwards, bear two pairs. The CMlopoda have these same 
anterior pairs of limbs early and permanently developed as organs of 
manducation, while all other segments have but a single pair. Palaeon- 
tologic evidence is in favor of the view that the dorsal scutes of Diplo- 
poda are compound. The archipolypodous type is the oldest, and there 
is evidence that some of the Carboniferous forms were amphibious. The 
group culminated in the Carboniferous, and does not appear to occur 
later than the Dyas, while, with one doubtful exception, no true diplo- 
pod is known to be older than the Oligocene. According to S. H. Scud- 
der, between twenty and thirty species of pre-Tertiary Araclinida are 
now known, and the earlier forms, chiefly of Carboniferous age, belong 
either to the Scorpionides or to the Anthracomarti, a group which is 
not known later than Palaeozoic times, the only Mesozoic arachnids yet 
known being true spiders.

An author’s edition with a distinct pagination has also been pub- 
lished. This contains only the first section of ‘part iii. The second 
section, containing the Articulata and Inadunata, has been referred by 
the Philadelphia Academy to their Proceedings of 1886. The authors 
give an elaborate discussion of the structure of the Palceoerinoidea, which 
they divide into three groups. The name ‘‘ Camarata^’ is proposed for 
all PalcEoerinoidea, in which the lower arm plates are incorporated into 
the calyx by interradial plates, and in which all the component parts 
of the test, dorsally and ventrally, are solidly connected by suture. 
Under the name “ Articulata'^ they include those families in which the 
plates of the test are united by loose ligaments or muscles, and in which 
they are somewhat movable. The name “ Inadunata’’^ is proposed for 
all Palceoerinoidea in which the arms are free above the first radials 
and which have five single interradials located ventrally. The pre- 
liminary discussion is subdivided under the following heads : 

(1) The plates of the abactinal system. A. The basals and underba- 
sals. B. The radial and arm plates. C. The interradial, interaxillary, 
and interbraohial plates. From the observations under this head the 
authors draw the following conclusions, viz: (1) Interradials are rep- 
resented in all groups of the Palceoerinoidea. They were developed in 
the larva, attained at once large proportions, and persisted through life 
or were resorbed on approaching maturity. (2) They extend invari- 
ably to the proximals, or even cover them completely. (3) They are 
more extravagantly developed in the earlier groups, not always in num- 
ber, but by extending over comparatively larger space. (4) In all 
groups in which the arms are free from the first radials they are repre- 
sented by only five single plates, and these are located ventrally. 
Groups with two or more radials have two at least, and the number 
increases in proportion to the increase of the radials, by means of which 
the lower series attain gradually a dorsal position. D. The anal 
plates and anal tube. 

(2) The plates of the actinal system. A. The summit plates. The 
authors think that the orals, if these are developed in Palceoerinoidea,

ozoic Flora of Virginia, by William Morris Fontaine. Washington, 
1883. 12-144 pp., 54 pis. Monographs of tbe U. S. Geological Survey, 
No. VI.” The reviewer, while differing slightly from Mr. Fontaine’s 
analysis of the facts, agrees with him in correlating the Eichmond 
coal-fields with the Ehaetic of Europe. The reviewer further states 
that the ‘‘seven Jurassic species are mostly from the Lias, or Lower 
Oolite, which, while not negativing the Ehaetic character of the Vir- 
ginia beds, does seem, when coupled with the rest of the evidence, 
to negative their Triassic character.” From this remark it would seem 
that the reviewer considers the Ehaetic as of Jurassic rather than Tri- 
assic age, a conclusion he is hardly justified in assuming.

Concludes that the field geologist and palaeontologist must work in 
concert. Indeed, the field geologist who ignores the use of fossils, as 
some have affected to do, is sure to burden science with the results of 
worthless work, and the palaeontologist who does not go to the field and 
study there the formations from which his fossils have been obtained is 
sure to produce results of work which will be worthy of the condemna- 
tion of both geologists and biologists.

Calls attention to the probable identity of the genus Pyrgulifera of 
the Bear Eiver group of North America, the fresh- water Upper Creta- 
ceous of Hungary, and the living shells in Lake Tanganyika. Dr. Leo- 
pold Tausch considers that he has found the type species, P. hunierora, 
in Hungary. This wide extensive range of fresh or brackish water 
forms, both in time and space, is very difficult to understand and ex- 
jdain, and has also an extreme interest in relation to the assumed equiv- 
alency of formations which bear similar faunas.

White, C. A. — On the Mesozoic and Cenozoic Palaeontology of Califor- 
nia. Bull. U. 8. Geol. Survey, No. 15, pp. 1-33. 1885. Washington. 
The author considers that the Chico-Tejon groups are an unbroken 
series of strata, and together represent the closing epoch of the Creta- 
ceous and the opening or Eocene epoch of the Tertiary. The unbroken 
continuity of the series is best illustrated near New Idria, Eresno County; 
still, there is there, near the middle, a recognizable change in the aspect 
of the strata, so that in appearance, and to some extent in the character, 
of the stratification the upper half differs from the lower half. 

In the Shasta group Dr. White considers the Knoxville beds as older 
than the Horsetown beds. The Cretaceous of British Columbia and 
Alaska he considers as probably the equivalent of the Knoxville beds. 
This conclusion is based on the occurrence of Aucella. The author 
considers Aucella erringtonii and A. piochii Gabb as identical, and as 
varieties of Aucella concentrica Fischer, and ou this account considers 
the so-called Jurassic auriferous slate as of the same age as the Knox- 
ville beds of the Shasta group, and considers the existence of the Ju- 
rassic in California as very doubtful. The fauna of the Knoxville beds 
of the Shasta group extends from Alaska southward at least as far as 
Central California. Some fossils from Southern Mexico apparently come 
from strata of the same age. No rocks of that age are known to exist to 
the eastward of the probable site of that belt ; and, finally, the Jurassic 
fauna of the strata which lie to the eastward of the assumed site of the 
belt is entirely different from that of the Jurassic strata to the west- 
ward of it. The author throws out the Martinez group and considers 
H. Mis. 15 48

SCIENTIFIC RECCED FOE 1885. 


that there is an unl)roken stratigraphical and faunal continuity from 
the Cretaceous to the Tertiary in the Chico-Tejon series. The Shasta 
group is divided into two divisions, the Knoxville beds and the Horse- 
town. The latter probably represents the Gault and the former the 
Lower Keocomian, and there is probably a hiatus between these two 
divisions. The Knoxville beds are regarded as having been synchron- 
ously deposited with the Aucella-hea.Tmg strata which have been found 
at various points along the northwest coast of North America, and also 
as homotaxially equivalent with those which in Northern Europe and 
Asia bear the same species of Aucella. 

No species of fossils yet found in the California Cretaceous rocks 
have been satisfactorily identified with any which occur in strata to the 
eastward of the Sierra Nevada. The reasons for this view are given in 
detail in the form of remarks on each specific identification. 

This difference in fauna is believed to have been due to the presence 
of a comparatively narrow but long continental belt which existed in 
the region which now comprises that of the Pacific coast, continuing 
from a time at least as early as the earliest epoch of the Cretaceous 
period.

This article is divided into several parts, as follows : 

(1) The occurrence of Lamarck in Western Oregon. 

(2) Fossil mollusca from the John Day group in Eastern Oregon. 
These fossils not only all belong to the types which are now living in 
or near the same region where the fossil forms are found, but a part of 
the latter are so nearly like the species that the author has not thought 
it advisable to separate them. The species are all different from any 
that have been hitherto known in a fossil’s condition. The new species, 
TJnio condoni, is described, and the description of Melix (Monodon) dallii 
is given from Dr. E. E. C. Stearns’s manuscript.

The author regards the Todos Santos Bay locality, upon palmonto- 
logic grounds, as equivalent with the Wallala beds, which Dr. Becker 
considers similar to the Chico group. Dr. White thinks they probably 
occupy a position between the Chico and Shasta groups. At Wallala, 
Mendocino County, Dr. Becker found the strata several thousand feet 
thick, resting upon a metamorphic series which he believes to be equiva- 
lent with the Knoxville beds of the Shasta group, but he was unable to 
discover any contact with the strata above them. The character of the

and in some respects they remind one of the Gosau formation of Europe.

Abstract. The author says that “ many other details might be men- 
tioned, all pointing to the one conclusion that, in passing over geo- 
graphical areas of sedimentary deposits of even a few hundred miles 
in extent, especially when the direction is vertical to the probable coast 
line of the period, the effects of those changed conditions recorded in 
the different nature and structure of the deposits, and of other con- 
ditions only recorded in the fossils themselves, which were probably 
differences of temperature and ocean currents, must be borne in mind 
in classifying the deposits.”

ZOOLOGY. 


By Prof. Theodore Gill. 


INTEODUCTION. 

The laborers in the various fields of Zoology have prosecuted investi- 
gations in the year 1885 with undiminished ardor, and scarcely any 
department has been neglected. The tendency manifested for some 
years towards a special study of embryology and of animals from an 
embryological standpoint, has been continued. Systematic zoology, on 
the other hand, has at least maintained its course during the period, 
and some most valuable works have appeared. Among such may be 
especially mentioned the first twO of the comtemplated three volumes 
of a catalogue of the LacertiHan reptiles in the British Museum, by Dr. 
George Edward Boulenger. A number of works on extinct animals, in 
which groups have been systematically considered, have been also pub- 
lished. Doubtless the most important and interesting of these for the 
American zoologist are (1) the enormous volume by Prof. E. D. Cope 
on The Vertebrata of the Tertiary Formations of the West (Part i), and 
(2) Prof. O. C. Marsh’s beautifully illustrated and printed “Dinocerata, 
a monograph of an extinct order of gigantic mammals.” Both of these 
volumes do indeed purport on their title pages to have been printed in 
previous years, Cope’s work bearing the imprint of 1883 and Marsh’s 
that of 1884, but they were not really published or accessible to the pub- 
lic till early in 1885. 

As in the previous reports, the language of the original from which 
the abstract is compiled is generally followed as closely as the case 
will permit. It has, however, been found necessary to limit the ab- 
stract to the illustration of the prominent idea underlying the original 
memoir, and pass by the proofs and collateral arguments. At the 
same time it has been often attempted to bring the new discovery into 
relation with the previous status of information respecting the group 
under consideration. As to the special discoveries recorded, they have 
been generally selected (1) on account of the modifications the forms 
considered may force on the system ; or (2) for the reason that they are 
or have been deemed to be of high taxonomic importance ; or (3) because 
the animals 2)er se are of general interest; or, finally (4), because they

are of special interest to the American naturalist. Of course zoologists 
cultivating limited fields of research will find in omissions cause for 
censure, and may urge that discoveries of inferior importance have 
been noticed to the exclusion of those better entitled to it. It is freely 
admitted that this charge may even be justly made; but the limits 
assigned to the record have been much exceeded, and the recorder has 
studied the needs of the many rather than of the few. The summary 
is intended, not for the advanced scientific student, but for those who 
entertain a general interest in zoology or some of the better-known 
classes. 

A partial bibliography of noteworthy memoirs and works relating to 
different classes of animals is supplied in the present article, and will, 
it is hoped, prove to be of use to those to whom the voluminous bibli- 
ographies and records of progress in science are inaccessible. It has 
been a difficult matter to select the titles which might be most advan- 
tageously introduced in a limited report like the present. Articles of 
a general interest or of special importance as contributing to throw light 
on the affinities of certain groups have been given the first place. Neces- 
sarily many very important papers have not been referred to and very 
few descriptive of species have been admitted and only when unusual 
interest attaches to the new species or the groups which they enlarge 

The compiler desires to make special acknowledgment for most mate- 
rial assistance to the Zoologisclier Anzeiger of Professor Cams, and to 
the Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society, whose abstracts of in- 
vestigations have been freely drawn upon in the preparation of those 
for the present report.

tion of sodic phosphate in distilled water, and the objects experimented 
upon were especially the cylindrical spermatozoa of Blyphemus pediculm, 
and the amoeboid cells of the intestinal epithelium of Stenostomum leu- 
cops. The changes undergone were remarkable, and the amoebiform 
cells of the Stenostomum ‘‘ became like flagellate infusorians, each with 
a long, thick, rapidly moving process, beside which two or three cilia 
were sometimes seen beating at the original much slower rate.” These 
experiments, supplimenting previous ones, especially those of Schneider, 
Brass, and Kiihner, are interesting as illustrations of the readiness 
with which cells may pass from one phase to another in response to en- 
vironmental influences, and are thus full of suggestion in relation to 
normal and pathological cell variation, affording additional experimental 
proof of the theory of a primitive cell-cycle, advanced by Geddes.”

Colors of cold-loving animals . — The colors of Arctic and Alpine ani- 
mals have been commented upon by Prof. Lorenzo Camerano, of Turin. 
His observations had reference especially to the Lepidoptera, and are 
in brief as follows : 

(1) “A sensible mutation of color is observed in many mammals, now 
more, now less distinctly, and generally it concurs with the change of 
coat. Also not seldom in mammals strictly belonging to the Alps,” as 
in the chamois and the ibex, ‘‘ the color changes very late in the summer 
and in the winter, although the length, the thickness, and also the 
coarseness of the hairs were very different.” In other cases, as, for ex- 
ample, in a Chinese deer (Cervus mandarinus), “ the coat is, in summer, 
light reddish-yellow, with many round white spots, while in winter it is 
dark brown, and the round spots are less numerous and are light brown.” 

(2) “As to the insects, it is observed that in Coleoptera the colors of 
the Alpine species are brighter than those of the warmer plains,” and 
various species found at the greatest elevations of the Alps have often 
lighter colors. 

(3) “ A darker color ” is observed “ generally in the insects of the des- 
erts,” as in that of Sahara, while — “ on the contrary, mammals in these 
countries present in general a very light color.” 

(4) “ A very remarkable melanism is also observed in several mammals 
as well as the reptiles and beetles that are in little islands.” 

(5) “ In the reptiles and in the Alpine amphibia, we sometimes meet 
with some cases of darkening, but the cases of a remarkable brighten- 
ing are not very rare, as for example, in the tadpoles of Eana muta,” a 
kind of frog. 

(6) “ A sensible difference is observed in the coloration between the 
Arctic birds and the Antarctic. In the last, black is much more abun- 
dant.” 

The causes “ that intervene to modify the color of animals are very 
complicated; climate has amongst these a certain importance,” but

Professor Camerano does not think that a '“theory of radiation is sufB- 
cient” to account for all the phenomena observed. {Nature, v. 32, p. 77 ; 
see, also, reply by Mr. Meldola in same vol., pp. 172, 173.) 

Temperature maxima for marine animals. — A series of experiments 
has been undertaken by Dr. J. Frenzel for the determination of the 
maximum heat under which certain animals can live. The first experi- 
ments were commenced by subjecting some to a temiDerature of 40° 0. 
This was supported by a Holothurian for two hours. A Diopatra died 
in about five minutes; a large tectibranchiate gastropod (Pleurobran- 
chsea meckelii) exhibited at first lively movements, but after five min- 
utes became torpid, although it was not killed; four minutes were 
enough for a lobster-like crustacean (Scyllarus). “As the Holothurian 
was the largest of the animals experimented on, the author points out 
that, although the chief reason for its power of resistance might be 
sought for in its size, yet the others were conquered too rapidly.” Con- 
sequently, it was to be inferred that the Holothurian is really capable 
of resisting heat to an unusual degree. 

Further observations were made at a starting point of 30° C., and of 
the animals thus experimented upon an Ophiuroid (Antedon) began to 
break up in two seconds ; the Diopartra survived for eighteen hours; a 
chaetopod worm (Terebella) showed the effect of heat at 25° C. ; a tecti- 
branchiate gastropod (Sea-hare or Aplysia) lived at 26° ; a pectinobran 
chiate gastropod (Murex) “bore 30° for a long time;” and a Scallop 
(Pectem) “showed some resistance;” a Scyllarus “ could bear 25°, but 
died slowly at 26°, and more quickly at 27° ; ” and a prawn (Palsemon) 
“died at 26°;” a fish (the Sea-horse or Hippocampus) “bore 27° well, 
and lived for an hour at 30°.” 

In fine, “many marine animals were found to bear high degrees of 
temperature for an astonishingly long time, as Actiniae, Murex, Tethys, 
and Aplysia. But it is not yet certain what heat they can permanently 
bear. It is also important to discover how winter animals comport 
themselves towards increase of temperature, and especially animals 
such as the Heteropoda and Phronima, which are quite wanting in the 
summer ; from what we know we must suppose that at the beginning 
of summer, when the temperature of the sea becomes raised, they make 
their way to greater depths, where the heat is less.” {Arch. f. gesammt. 
Physiol.., V. 36, pp. 458-466 ; J. B. 31. S. (2), v. 5, pp. 791, 792.) 

PROTOZOANS. 

Bhizopods. 

Differentiation in Amoehas . — Although proverbially protean and un- 
stable, the Amoebeans nevertheless exhibit differences which aptly dis- 
tinguish them into forms generally considered to be of specific value; 
such differences have been especially insisted upon by Dr. A. Gru- 
ber. Dr. Gruber contends that “ there are a number of separate 
and exactly definable AmoBbae which do not pass into one another,’’ 


ZOOLOGY. 


765 


and this decision he gives as the result of observations by himself “for 
months and even years, of forms living in the same locality.’’ The 
differences are manifested in the “ average size, the consistency of the 
protoplasm, and the movements thereby conditioned, as well as in the 
characters of its contents, such as vacuoles, granules,” and crystals, and 
also, more especially, in the number, size, and structure of the nuclei. 
Ten species are described by Dr. Gruber j five of them are multi-nuclear, 
and “ it is proved how definitely the nuclei are distinguished from one 
another, and with what certainty one can conclude from external char- 
acters on the structure of the nucleus,” and the reverse. It further 
follows that “ two very similar species of Amoebae may have very dif- 
ferently-formed nuclei, and that in forms which are externally very 
different the nuclei may be quite similar ; in any case, the number of 
the different forms of nuclei is much more important than has hitherto 
been supposed.” 

The “ only differentiation in the body of an Amoeba obtains at the 
outermost periphery, where the protoplasm clearly, from contact with 
water, is converted into an invisible cuticula-like layer, which disap- 
pears during the outpushing of the pseudopodia and can be re-made.” 

Dr. Gruber denies the existence of “ a plexiform structure of the pro- 
toplasm” as well as refractive bodies, such as have been described to 
Pelomyxa palustris. 

As to the “ pale filaments” which have been found in some Amffibse, 
they “appear to be symbiotic fungi;” “in one species, which was re- 
markable for the constant collection of chlorophyll containing food, 
they were always present.” 

Among the species of Amoebae recognized by Dr. Gruber is the A. vil- 
losa, first described by Dr. Leidy from specimens found about Philadel- 
phia, and the discovery in Europe of this species “confirms the doc- 
trine that the fresh-water Ehizopods are cosmopolitan organisms.” 
{Zeitschr. f. wissen. Zoolo., v. 41, pp. 186-225, 3 pL; J. E. M. 8. (2) v. 6, 

pp. 260, 261.) 

Sporozoons. 

Development of Gregorinids . — An important contribution to the devel- 
opmental history of the monocysted Gregorines has been published 
by G. Euschhaupt. His observ^ations were chiefly made on those in- 
festing common earth worms or Lumbricids. Seven species of Grego- 
rinids were found in the worms, which have been more fully described, 
at least as to some points, by the author. The process of encystation, 
the formation of sporoblasts, the presence of macrospores and micro- 
spores in a single cyst, and the entrance of spores into the sperm- 
mother-cell were especially observed in one or other of the Gregorinids 
mentioned. The connection between the Gregorinids and the generative 
products of the earth worms, the infection of earth worms with Grego- 
rinids, and the relations between the parasites and coccidia have been

also considered. {Jenaische ZeitscJir. f. JSfaturwiss., v. 18, pp. 713-750 (1 
pi.) 3 J. B. M. 8. (2), V. 5, p, 665.) 

Infusorians. 

Artificial multiplication of Infusorians . — With a view to determine the 
behavior of Infusorians when vivisected, A. Gruber experimented on 
the Stentor coeruleus. (1) First, an individual was bisected transversely, 
and on the following day each of the parts had become a perfect indi- 
vidual ; (2) one of these was likewise bisected, and again on the follow- 
ing day the two sections had developed into perfect animalcules ; (3) 
one of the second bisection was also cut transversely, and again (4) one 
of the third bisection. In both instances the sectionized parts became 
perfect individuals on the day of their division. The result of the ex- 
periments thus noticed, and others, further served to show also that the 
sections without a nucleus, although they did well, “ never grew up into 
complete animals,” as did those with a nucleus. The presence of a 
nucleus, in fact, is perhaps a necessary element for complete regenera- 
tion. [Biol. Centralblatt, v. 5, j). 137 ; J. B. M. 8. (2), v. 5, pp. 658, 659.) 

POEIFEES. 

' 8ponges. 

Beproduction of the fresh-water sponge . — The reproductive process has 
been investigated by Dr. W. Marshall in one of the common European 
fresh-water sponges, 8pongilla lacustris. The gemmules or winter em- 
bryos are formed in the neuter autumn sponge from wandering nutri- 
tive amoeboid cells, known as trophophores, which accumulate in the 
rnhalent corals or in the ciliated chambers. The embryo is at first a 
‘‘ morula-like mass of rOund uniform cells.” It escapes from the cap- 
sule in which it is invested in April or early in May. In about a month 
after the escape of the embryo from the capsule, maturity and complete 
sexuality are attained. “It seems probable that the males are desti- 
tute of dnteric cavity and mouth,” while the females are “ usually pro- 
vided ” with such. After fulfilling their sexual functions the “ males 
seem to perish.” The females bear “neuter forms” and then increase 
in size, but the “ enteric cavities and mouth-openings are reduced in 
size, and not unfrequently disappear.” In fine, there is “ a seasonal 
alternation of generations ; the winter gemmulae form spring sexual 
spongillae which produce sexual forms in which arise the winter gem- 
mulae.” [8itzungsber. JSFaturf. Oesellsch. Leipzig, 1884, pp. 22-29; J. B. 
M. 8. (2), V. 5, pp. 1011, 1012). 

CtELENTEATES. 

Polyps. 

A new family of Pennatulids . — The interesting group of Pennatulids, 
which was named by Kollikerthe “ Juuciformes,” has received an inter- 
esting addition during the past year, in the shape of a new species, rep- 


ZOOLOGY, 


7G7 


resenting even a new family of the group; specimens were obtained in 
, Japan and have been described by Prof. A. A. W. Hubrecht under the 
specific name EcMnoptilum Macintoshii and the family name Echinop- 
tilidae. It belongs to the ‘‘section Spicat®,” and (as just noted) ‘‘sub- 
section Junciformes” in Kdlliker’s classification, and is “characterized 
by the total absence of anything like an axis, which is present in all 
Pennatulids except some of the primitive Veretelle® and the divergent 
Eenille®.” 

The polyps form a dense colony, which is rigid on account of the de- 
velopment of calcareous needles, “which, on the rachis, unite to form 
projecting polyp cells.” The needles are in the internal framework, 
as well as in the investment; the polpy-cells are arranged in less dis- 
tinct rows than in Stachyptilum, and the ventral is not wholly de- 
void of polyps. Of all the specimens available for examination the 
polyps had undergone desiccation, and consequently could not be fully 
described. But it appeared plain that not only does the new type 
constitute a distinct family, but, according to Professor Hubrecht, it 
must be also recognized as representative of a group of higher rank in- 
termediate between the groups already known. [Proc. Zool. Soc. London^ 
1885, pp. 512-518, 2 pi.; J. E. M. S. (2), v. 6, p. 81.) 

Acalephs. 

Radial disposition of Acalephs and Echinoderms. — The problem of the 
number of segments in the radiate animals has been taken up by Dr. W. 
Haacke, and he has sought to determine the primitive number of such. 
Professor Haeckel considered that the star fishes were nearer the ances- 
tors of the Echinoderms than any other group, because in them there is 
a variation in the number of arms in some species, although in most the 
number is five, while in the sea urchins, or Echinoids, and Holothurians, 
the number is constant and always five. Dr. Haacke, however, main- 
tains that in Amblypneustes, one of the sea urchins, he has seen indi- 
viduals with four and others with six parameres or radial sections, and 
that therefore Haeckel’s views are militated against by such facts. As 
to the Acalephs, according to Haeckel, the primitive number of par- 
ameres in the Medus® is four, and with this view Dr. Haacke is inclined 
to agree. He further thinks that it is possible that the typical number 
of parameres in the Echinoderms is four and not five, but he admits that 
the question is still an open one. (Zool. Anzeiqer, v. 8, pp. 505-507 ; J. 
E. M. S. (3), V. 6, p. 48.) 

ECHINODEEMS. 

Crinoids. 

Several important memoirs on crinoids have appeared during the 
past year, or late in 1884. One of these is by Dr. Herbert Carpenter, 
and furnishes a volume of the series of memoirs devoted to the elucida- 


768 


SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1885. 


tion of the material collected by the Challenger Expedition. Another 
is a systematic revision of the extinct American crinoids published in 
the “Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia” 
by Messrs. C. Wachsmuth and F. Springer. The concluding portion 
of the latter will be published in 1886. A further notice of these and 
other memoirs is therefore deferred. 

Asterioids. 

Nervous system of star -fishes . — In a memoir on the histology of Asterioids 
Dr. O. Hamann has elucidated several interesting, and among them 
is additional information respecting the nervous system. The well- 
developed oral nerve-ring has long been known, but besides this there 
is, according to Dr. Hamann, “ a nerve-plexus in the oral disk ; this con- 
sists of nerve-fibrils with scattered ganglionic cells, which pass into the 
epithelial cells of the disk.” In fact, an arrangement is manifested 
“com^iarable” to one previously observed by Dr. Hamann himself in 
the Holothurians. {Nachr. K. QeselUch. Wiss., Gottingen, 1884, pp. 
385, 386; J. B. M. 8., (2), v. 5, pp. 652, 653.) 

Echinoids. 

Compound eyes in Echinoids . — lu a Diadematid (probably Eiadema 
Setosum) occurring at Trincomalee, some peculiar characteristics have 
been discovered by Drs. 0. F. and P. B. Larasin. That sea-egg is cov- 
ered with blue spots. One of these, when examined under the micro- 
scope, shows on the surface “a mosaic” of polyhedra (“generally irreg- 
ular hexahedra,” but also peutahedra) which are so disposed as to call 
to mind the compound eyes of insects or crustaceans. “Each polyhe- 
dron corresponds to a pyramid of very highly refractive substance, 
the blunt edge of which is invested in lugment;” there “may be one 
hundred or as many as one or two thousand pyramids in one spot ; over 
all of them the body-epithelium forms a thin ciliated layer, which may 
be regarded as the cornea;” further, “each pyramid consists of a num- 
ber of vesicular cells with quite hyaline contents, and in many of them 
there is a distinct nucleus,; this region may be regarded as that of the 
lens and crystalline body.” These organs are “directly placed on a 
ganglionic plexus,” and there is no distinct nerve intervening between 
the two. When a hand is directed towards a point where these organs 
are developed, the surrounding spines are seen to turn towards the 
spot. It has been therefore inferred that the spots in question have the 
junction of eyes capable at least of appreciating the difference between 
“light and shade.” {Zool. Anzeiger v. 8, pp. 715-720; J. B. M. 8., (2), v. 
6, p. 253.) 

Holothurians.

determine the systematic values thereof and the best means of classify- 
ing the groups. “ The arrangement of the ambulacral suckers varies 
with age.” The calcareous deposits are much less variable, and in but 
few cases are there notable differences, according to age or otherwise. 
The tentacles appear to furnish the best differentiating characters. The 
combination of BendrocMrotce introduced by Prof. Jeffery Bell is adopted. 
Further, the distribution of the tentacles into one or two rows affords 
good grounds for a division into groups, to be called respectively, “ifo- 
nofyclia” and “ HeterocycliaP A new and systematic monograph of the 
order is promised by Dr. Lampert. {Biol. Centralhlatt, v. 5, pp. 102-109 ;

Rotifers. 

The relations of the Rotifers. — Much diversity of opinion has prevailed 
as to the relations of the Eotifers to other classes of the animal king- 
dom. The subject has been taken up recently by Dr. L. Plate in con- 
nection with a monograph of the fresh-water rotifers observed by him. 
He considers that it is clear that sexual dimorphism is an acquired 
character.” The progenitor of the class (“Archirotator ”) is supposed 
to have had a cylindrical body narrower behind, a ventral mouth and 
dorsal anus, and an aboral tuft of cilia ; the wheel apparatus consisted 
of two ciliated circlets ; the fore-gut had a chitnious masticatory appa- 
ratus, and the whole tract was lined by ciliated epithelium ; into its hinder 
portion opened two unbranched excretory canals and the genital ducts. 
The nervous system consisted of a dorsal central ganglion, which gave 
off" several anterior and two postero lateral nerves. As to their system- 
atic position, the Eotifers appear to be of the same stock as the Anne- 
lids, but they differ from the Trochophore in wanting a ciliated groove ; 
the hinder circlet of cilia opens into the fore-gut, the aboral tuft does 
not correspond to the perianal circlet, and the brains are not homolo- 
gous.” {Jenaische Zeitschr. f. Naturwiss., v. 19, pp. 1-120, 3 pi. ; J. R. M. 
8. (2), V. 6, pp. 76-78.) 


Platy helminths. 

Rew York Turhellarians. — An important memoir on the fresh-water 
TurbeUarians occurring especially in Monroe County, New York, has 
been published by Dr. W. A. Silliman in the “ Zeitschrift fiir wissen- 
schaftliche Zoologie ” (v. 41, pp. 48-78, with 2 pi.). Twenty-one species 
have been recognized, of which a considerable number, it is supposed, 
are common to America and Europe. Dr. Silliman considers the groups 
named Ehabdoccela, Tridada, Polycloda, and Nemertinea to be of approx- 
imately equal value and representing four “orders” of TurbeUarians.

Nematelminths. 

Nervous system of tape-worms. — Although the nervous system of the 
tape-worm was discovered half a century ago, the subje :!t has remained 
in considerable obscurity, and recent research by Dr. J. Niemiec is 
therefore timely as throwing light on some of the controverted and 
doubtful points at issue. Dr. Memiec’s researches were based on sec- 
tions of the scolices of T. ccenuriis, T. elliptica, T. serrata, and T. me- 
diocanellata. The different parts are considered under four categories. 

(1) A '•'nerve ring^^ situated under the hooks, from which “filaments 
run to the hook musculature, while from ganglionic swellings eight 
branches descend, four going to the principal lateral ganglia, and four 
prolonging their course even within the proglottides.” 

(2) A “ central ganglion ” in the middle of the “ principal commissure,” 
joining the two lateral ganglia, and “from which a ‘transverse commis- 
sure’ passes at right angles to the ‘ principal.’ ” 

(3) “ Polygonal commissures^ in the plane of the two chief commis- 
sures, formed by “ nerves which unite the two lateral ganglia with the 
branches descending from the nerve-ring and with the transverse com- 
missure,” and parallel to it, “ a little below, there lies an ‘inferior polyg- 
onal commissure ’ of the same nature. Where the different branches 
join, ‘ secondary ganglia’ are situated, and from these, as well as fiom 
the principal lateral ganglia, the suckers are supplied with nerves, four 
to each.” 

(4) “ Spongy cords f ten in number, three pairs starting from the prin- 
cipal lateral ganglia and the remaining four (as already noted) “ de- 
scending from the nerve-ring and passing through the ‘ secondary gan- 
glia.’ ” 

In conclusion Dr. Niemiec insists upon (1) the resemblance between 
the nervous system of the tape-worms and that of the Tetrarhynchi ; 
and (2) the homologies of the nerve-ring of the tape-worms with the 
oesophageal ring of the annelids, “ from which it differs only in its less 
pronounced development or reversion to a more rudimentary fbrm,” 
and (3) the diminished gap which intervenes between the cestode and 
trematode nervous systems. {Becueil Zool. Suisse, v. 2, pp. 589-648 ; J. 
E. M. S. (2), V. 6, pp. 75, 76.) 

Annelids. 

Beep sea Annelids. — The deep-sea types of a few classes, snch as the 
fishes and Holothurians, are, to a large extent, much differentiated from 
the shallow-water forms, but those of other classes are comparatively 
little divergent from littoral species. Among the groups of the latter cat- 
egory are the Annelids. The rich material collected by the Challenger 
expedition has been the object of study to Prof. William C. McIntosh 
for seven years, and the results thereof have now appeared in the form 
of a large quarto volume constituting the entire twelfth of the Chal- 
lenger reports.

Under the heading of “ classification ” (p. viii) Professor McIntosh 
states that “ the large number of new forms brought within our knowl- 
edge by the Challenger would have been supposed to lead to a note- 
worthy change in classification, but from the first it was apparent that 
no new family was required. All the types fell under the groups already 
constituted, and which have been very satisfactorily given by Malmgren 
in his Anuulata Polychoeta ” (1867). Much “ experience has not as yet 
shown the necessity for any material change.” It is admitted, however, 
that “there are some forms, such as the genus Eulepis” (retained in 
Polynoid®) which almost merit the distinction of a separate family, but 
they have only recently been discovered and may properly be left for 
further investigation.” 

Two hundred and twenty new species are described by Professor Mc- 
Intosh. 

AETHROPODS. 

Merostomes. 

Embryology and morphology of Limulus . — The horse shoe crab, or Lim- 
ulus, has been the subject during the past year (as in previous years) of 
investigation with reference to its embryology, morphology, and sys- 
tematic relations. Of American naturalists. Dr. J. S. Kingsley has con- 
tributed an important memoir on the embryology of Limulus to the 
“English Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science” (v. 25, pp. 521-576, 
3 pi.), and Prof. Henry L. Osborn, Dr. W. K. Brooks, Mr. A. T. Bruce, 
and Mr. W. H. Howell have communicated preliminary notices of in- 
vestigatons to No. 43 of the “ Johns Hopkins University Circulars.” 
One, by Professor Osborn, is on the “Metamorphosis ot Limulus poly- 
phemus’’^ (p. 1), a second, by Dr. Brooks and Mr. Bruce, is an “ Abstract 
of Besearches on the Embryology of Limulus polypliemus ” (pp. 2-4), and 
a third, by Mr. Howell, is “ On the Chemical Composition, &c., of the 
Blood of Limulus polyphemus ” (pp. 4, 5). Dr. A. S. Packard has also 
published in the American Naturalist (v. 19) a supplementary memoir 
on certain points of the embryology of the same species. Important 
memoirs have been likewise published by Prof. E. Bay Lankester and 
several associates or students, in the “ Quarterly Journal of Microscop- 
ical Science,” and the “ Transactions of the Zoological Society of Lon- 
don.” 

Arachnids. 

*tiense organ in legs of spiders . — The peculiar structural modifications 
of the legs which have been observed in certain spiders by Bertkau and 
Dahl, and considered to be sensory organs, have been studied anew by 
Professor Schimkenitsch. The structures in question have been found 
in most of the leg joints in a number of spiders, and in both males and 
females. They are sujjerficially thin chitinous plates with thickened 
borders, whose opposite sides are connected by parallel thickenings, 


772 


SCIENTIFIC KECOED FOR 1885. 


and in cross-sections are to be found “ round these organs a layer of 
remarkably tall pigmented cells,” and ‘‘between these are ganglion cells 
with prolongations directed towards the chitinous layer.” These are 
thought to be analogous to the “chordotonal organs” of insects. {Zool. 
Anzeiger^ 1885, pp. 264-266, 537, 638). 

Dimorphism in spiders . — Several observers have determined that cer- 
tain spiders have two broods, and that the individuals of the two differ 
more or less, in a few cases the differentiation having been considered 
as specific. The so-called Meta segmentata and Meta Mengei, for exam- 
ple, represent several broods of one and the same species. In other 
cases, however, there is but little difference between the two broods. 
{Zool. Anzeiger, 1885, pp. 459-464, by Bertkau ; 532, 533, by Korsch.) 

Crustaceans. 

A nervous system in the Centrogonida . — The singular degraded crusta- 
ceans, known as Peltogaster and Sacculina, which have been differen- 
tiated into a distinct order called Ehizocephala or Centrogonida, have 
a nervous system so rudimentary and obscure as to have escaped ob- 
servation until the past year. Mr. T. Delage resolved to supply the 
deficiency, and after two years of observation he found it in Sacculina, 
while in Peltogaster, on the other hand (although the absolute difficulties 
of the search were exactly the same as in Sacculina) he found it in the 
first individual dissected after less than an hour’s work. He mentions 
this particular only to show the value of the morphological method, 
and if he found this nervous i system it is by no means due to partic- 
ular address in dissection ; it is because, armed with the morphological 
data derived from the study of Sacculina, he sought for it precisely 
where it ought to be found. When one knows where to look for it, he 
remarks, it is easy to find, but this last condition is indispensable, and 
it is from not having this requisite knowledge at their disposal that 
the numerous authors who have previously investigated the genera in 
question failed to discover it. The ganglia are displaced and in ap- 
parently different relations on account of the position of the ovaries 
and other parts. In these displacements, was the nervous ganglion to 
retain the original position at the bottom of the ovary, or was it to fol- 
low the cloaca, or the mesentery or the cement-glands ? Observation 
has shown that it did not remain immovable ; therefore its relations 
with the declivous pole of the ovary are not at all essential; it had fol- 
lowed the cloaca and the mesentery,, but especially the cement-glan<Js, 
in their movements ; hence it is with these organs, and chiefly with 
the last named, that it has fundamental relations. On the other hand, 
we see that the close relations of the ganglion with the testes in Pelto- 
gaster are quite accidental, since in Sacculina these organs are as far 
apart as possible. Henceforward in seeking for the nervous system in 
other Centrogonida, in which the viscera may again affect new rela- 
tions, we see that we shall not have to pay any attention to the testes.

or to the anti-peduncnlar pole of the ovary, and that it is between the 
cement-glands, in the sagittal plane, and perhaps slightly towards the 
cloaca and the cement-glands, that we must direct the forceps and the 
scalpel. It is only by the study'of a type in which the cement-glands 
may be far removed from the mesentery and the cloaca that we can see 
whether the nervous ganglion would entirely break off its relations 
with the latter two organs and follow the cement-glands in their dis- 
placement. {Comptes Bendus Acad. Sci. Paris, 1885, p. 1010; Ann. 
Mag. Nat. Mist. (5), v. 15, pp. 495-498.) 

Blind sensile-eyed crustaceans . — The structure of the brain in sessile- 
eyed crustaceans, and especially that of the Asellus communis and Oe- 
cidotsea stygia, has been investigated by Prof. A. S. Packard. The 
brain of such forms has not ganglion and cells with a simple nucleus, as 
does that of a lobster and other stalk-eyed crustaceans, but ten to twenty 
nuclei appear to a cell. The brain is therefore far less complicated than 
that of the stalk-eyed crustaceans and is “ a syncerebrum, the compo- 
nents being the brain proper or pro-cerebral lobes, the optic ganglia, and 
the first and second antennal lobes,” and these lobes are quite separate 
from each other. 

As to the blind species Professor Packard thinks that “ the steps 
taken in the degeneration or degradation of the eye, the result of the 
life in darkness seem to be these : (1) the total and nearly or quite simul- 
taneous loss by disuse of the optic ganglia and nerves ; (2) the breaking 
down of the retinal cells; (3) the last step being, as seen in the totally 
eyeless form, the loss of the lens and pigment.” Professor Packard 
considers this evolution to be explicable upon what may be called 
“Lamarckian” principles. {Mem. Nat. Acad. Sci., v. 3, part 14, p. 5.) 

Insects. 

Extinct myriopods . — As a result of a study of the fossil myriopods, 
Mr. Samuel H. Scudder has admitted two extinct orders. The Archi- 
polypodous type is the oldest, and Mr. Scudder considers that there is evi- 
dence that some of the Carboniferous forms were amphibious. The group 
culminated in the Carboniferous, and does not appear later than the 
Dyas, while with one doubtful exception no true diplopod is know to be 
older than the Oligocene. The Archipolypoda, which resembled the 
Diplopoda in having two pairs of legs to every segment, became extinct 
in the Palaeozoic epoch. Three families have been recognized, the 
Archidesmidae, Buphorberiidae, and Archij ulidae. Another extinct type 
is found in the Protosygnatha, which are characterized by the develop- 
ment of only a single pair of legs to each segment, in which respect a 
resemblance is manifested to the Chilopoda. One genus only, Palae- 
ocampa, is known from the Carboniferous. 

For a brief period after leaving the eggs, modern Diplopods and pau- 


774 


SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1885. 


ropods have a shorter body than in after' life, and the first three seg- 
ments bear but a single pair of legs. 

In adult life, these first three segments still bear but a single pair of 
limbs, while all the other segments which exist in the larval state, and 
those which develop afterwards, bear two pairs. The Chilopoda have 
the same three anterior pairs of legs, early and permanently devel- 
oped as organs of manducation, while all other segments have but a 
single pair. Palaeontological evidence is in favor of the view that the 
dorsal scutes of Diplopoda are compound. 

The sight of insects . — The power of vision of insects has been investi- 
gated by Prof. Felix Plateau, whose special aim was to determine 
whether insects can distinguish the form of objects. It has been con- 
tended by certain authors that such insects as possess compound eyes 
cannot distinguish form, and that vision operates in a different way 
from that generally admitted, and consists mainly in the perception of 
movements. To some extent this view is sustained by Professor Pla- 
teau as the result of a series of experiments. He concluded from these 
that “insects only utilize their eyes to choose between a luminous 
orifice in a dark chamber, or another orifice or group of orifices equally 
white. They are guided neither by odorous emanations, nor by differ- 
ences of color. A fact which will certainly astonish all entomologists, 
and likewise surprise the experimenter himself, is, that bees have as 
bad sight and comport themselves almost as flies.” 

Professor Plateau directed his observations to many widely different 
insects, belonging to the orders of Hiptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidotera, 
Odonata, and Coleoptera, and the experiments spoken of were essen- 
tially harmonious. The following conclusion resulted: 

(1) “Diurnal insects have need of a quick, strong light, and cannot 
direct their movements in partial obscurity. 

(2) “In diurnal insects with compound eyes, the simple eyes offer so 
little utility that it is right to consider them as rudimentary organs. 

(3) “Insects with compound eyes do not notice differences of form 
existing between two light orifices, and are deceived by an excess of 
luminous intensity as well as by the apparent excess of surface. In 
short, they do not distinguish the form of objects, or, if they do, dis- 
tinguish them very badly.” (Aw. Nai., v. 20, pp. 69, 70.) 

Adherence of insects to ceilings . — There has been considerable differ- 
ence of opinion as to the method by which flies and insects generally 
adhere to the ceilings and walls of rooms and analagous surfaces, and 
the subject has recently been investigated by Herr H. DeWitz. His 
researches tend to prove that the secretions by which flies, for example, 
adhere to the window panes is not a thin fluid of a fatty nature, but 
much more consistent. He adduces experiments to controvert Kom- 
bout’s view that a fly can maintain itself on a glass surface by one leg 


ZOOLOGY. 775 

only, if that surface be vertical and if the body of the fly be in contact 
with the glass. {J. R. M. S., Oct.,. 1885; Am. Nat., v. 20, p. 1221.) 

Insects of the coal period . — The additions to our knowledge of the in- 
sect fauna of the early periods of the earth’s history have been very 
great during the past few years, and a deposit of species from the Car- 
boniferous beds at Commentry, in the department of Allier, France, has 
contributed a number of new types and furnished data for forming an 
enlarged survey of the ancient insects. A French naturalist, Mr. 0. 
Brongniart, has been able to study the remains of 1,300 specimens, 
among which not only the wings but sometimes the bodies have been 
preserved. He corroborates the impression that has already obtained, 
that the venation of the wings, which is generally so good a guide in the 
appreciation of recent species, not only fails to a large extent, but is 
even liable to lead into error in the case of the ancient forms; neverthe- 
less, in spite of such discrepancies, the most ancient insects are, in some 
respects at least, surprisingly like those of the present time, and only 
differ in comparatively unimportant respects. 

Among the insects of the Commentry deposit occurs the first fossil 
Thysanuran, represented by 45 specimens. It is supposed to be re- 
lated to the existing Machilis, but differs from all living representa- 
tives of the order by having a single caudal filament. The species has 
been named Dasyleptus lucasi. 

The Orthopterous insects are represented by species which recall the 
Phasmids or leaf insects of our day, but are segregated by Brongniart 
in a special order under the name Feurorthoptera. Of this tyi)e two 
major groups or suborders, with numerous distinct generic types, refer- 
able to about five families, have been made known. 

The Homopterous insects were represented in the deposit by five 
genera. 

The Pseudo-neuroptera had forms that were still more varied ; six 
families have been recognized for the carboniferous species. (1) One was 
a group of eight new genera of a family to which the name of Megasc- 
copterida has been given: The abdomen had respiratory appendages 
and the problematical Breyeria Borinensis is regarded as being a species 
of the family. (2) Another family, called Protodonata, is recognized 
for forms somewhat resembling the dragon flies or Libellulidse of the 
present age. Four other families, the Homothitida, Protephemerina, 
Protoperlida, and Protomyrmeleonida, furnish additional species of the 
Pseudoneuroptera. {Am. Nat., v. 20, pp. 68, 69.) 

Crickets infested by Gordius or thread-worms . — Numerous insects har- 
bor Gordius or thread-worms during some portion of their life history, 
and some recent interesting observations were communicated by a lady 
of Groton, N. Y., Mrs. C. W. Conger, to the Eev. Dr. Henry C. McCook. 
On one occasion she noticed that a cricket mbunted upon the edge of a 
pail, and after some uneasy movements brought the tip of the abdomen 


776 


SCIENTIFIC EECOED FOE 1885. 


just beneath the water, and, with a few violent throes, expelled a black 
mass, which fell slowly through the water, and before it reached the 
bottom resolved itself into one of the worms. “ The cricket seemed ex- 
hausted by the horrid birth, and did not find strength to draw itself up 
on the edge of the pail for about eight minutes, and when it finally did 
so, it tumbled to the floor and crawled off in a very rheumatic manner. 
After this discovery we used to amuse leisure hours by watching like 
operations until frost killed the crickets. I sometimes would crush 
large crickets, generally with the result that a tightly-coiled snake 
would be thrust out of a rupture just above the tip of the abdomen ; 
but whether the snake was not sufficiently developed or because of its 
needing water rather than air to vitalize it, none of the snakes so pro- 
duced showed any signs of life.” 

MOLLUSCOIDS. 

Polyzoans. 

Use of avicularia in classification of the Polyzoans . — The so-called 
chitinous parts (operculum and avicularia) of the Polyzoans had been 
much neglected until lately, but Messrs. A. W. Waters and G. Busk 
have paid special attention to such parts with decided benefit to the 
systematic arrangement of the chilostomata. The modifications of the 
operculum especially were described when practicable by Mr. Busk in 
his elaborate report on the species collected by the Challenger expedi- 
tion. The avicularian mandibles were also investigated to some extent 
by Mr. Busk 5 and, according to Mr. Waters, “ to him we must give the 
credit of first applying the form of the mandible in specific determina- 
tion.” A fuller discussion “On the use of the avicularian mandible in 
the determation of the chilostomatous Bryozoa or Polyzoa” has been 
contributed by Mr. Arthur W. Waters. Various points are discussed, 
but only a couple can be here noticed. “ The process in the chitinous 
mandibles” Mr. Busk calls a columella, and says that “it is covered with 
short hairs,” but these, upon comjDarison with other mandibles, turn ont 
only to be the remains of the attachment of the muscular threads. In 
fine, the processes in the mandibles, especially of Cellepora and Adeona, 
“ indicate differences in the muscular attachments, and both here and 
in the opercula it is really the muscular system which has the greatest 
classificatory value ; but this is best studied by means of the variations 
in the chitinous parts.” {J. B. M. 8. ( 2 ), v. 5, pp. 774-779, pi. 14.) 

Brachiopods. 

Vascular and nervous systevis of Brachiopods . — Some points in the 
structure of the Brachiopods are very difficult to determine for one rea- 
son or another, but new light is gradually being thrown on such. Sev- 
eral doubtful points have been investigated by Dr. F. Blochmann. The 
heart and its contractibility were early correctly observed by Professor 


ZOOLOGY. 


777 


Hancock. Occasionally, as in the Argiope n'eopolitana, there are two 
hearts. On the other hand, in some forms, as Crania anomala, there is 
“ no heart,” but “ numerous enlargements on the ‘ vein.’” The so-called 
“ afferent brachial canal” of Hancock is now affirmed to be “really the 
supra-cesophogeal nerve,” and “further, the plexus which Hancock de- 
scribes as circulatory, are really branching and anastomosing connec- 
tive tissue-cells.” In one of the examined Brachiopods ( Crania anomala) 
the supra-oesophageal ganglion is replaced by a “ narrow fibrillar com- 
missure.” A “brachial vessel, sending off vessels to the cirrhi, runs 
along the whole length of the brachial sinus behind the oesophagus, ' 
communicating by paired branches with the oesophageal blood-sinus, 
and so with the heart.” [Zool. Anseiger, v. 8, pp. 164-167 ; J. B. M. 8. 
(2), V. 5, p. 440.) 

MOLLUSKS. 

Acephals. 

Action of the foot in bivalve mollusJcs . — The movements of the foot in 
Lamellibranchs, or the bivalve mollusks, have been studied by Dr. A. 
Fleischmann. It is maintained that the so-called aquiferous pores in 
the foot are “ neither the orifices of glands nor artefacts. This being so, 
they cannot serve as a means of communication between the blood vas- 
cular system and the surrounding water. Such streams of water as are 
seen on contraction are not normal vital phenomena, but are patho- 
logical. Even if there were pores, they could not, for mechanical rea- 
sons, have the functions that have been ascribed to them. The swelling 
of the foot is due to the entrance of a certain quantity of blood, which, 
during repose, is stored up in the pallial reservoirs ; the blood is aided 
by the closure of a strong valve and by the simultaneous relaxation"' of 
the musculature of the foot, the lacun® of which become filled by blood. 
When the foot undergoes erection there is no change of volume of the 
whole animal, but only a change in the volume of separate parts, due 
to the dislocation of, the blood. It has not been proved that water is 
taken up by the kidneys or intercellular ducts. The Lamellibranchs 
do not need to take in water. What is true of them is also true of other 
grouiis of mollusks.” {Zeitsvhr, Wiss. Zool., v. 41, pp. 367-431 ; J. B. M. 
8., V. 6, p. 52.) 

Byssogenous glands and Aquiferous pores in Lamellibranehs . — The bys- 
sogenous glands and pores of bivalve mollusks, as well as the so-called 
aquiferous pores of the foot, have been studied by Prof. T. Barrois. 

“ In the present state of knowledge,” he indicates, “it is generally 
admitted that the byssus is the secretion of special glands,” but the ex- 
tent to which such glaiids are developed had not been known until the 
professor was able to demonstrate that Lamellibranchs generally ex- 
hibit more or less well mai’ked traces of this byssogenous apparatus. 


SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1885. 


In such forms as have the glands moderately developed, such as the 
common European cockle {Cardium' edule), the organ consists of “a 
groove on the lower surface of the foot, of glands at the side of the 
groove, of a canal which extends from it to the more or less spacious 
cavity of the byssus, and of compact masses of byssogenous glands 
which pass the products of their secretion into the cavity.” This cavity 
as well, and also the canal and the groove, are lined with a cylindrical 
epithelium. In the common cockle the byssus is formed by a simple 
hyaline filament.” 

In those forms in which the glands are more developed, such as the 
common mussel (Mytilus), Pinna, and others, “the glands are much 
denser, and the anterior extremity of the foot is prolonged to form the 
linguiform muscle; the lamellae of the cavity of the byssus are more 
numerous,” and the byssus is formed of a number of filaments consti- 
tuting a tuft. “ In Anomia differentiation is carried much further, for 
the byssus becomes charged with carbonate of lime,” and comjoact, so 
as to form the so-called ossicle. 

In still other forms, “the organ undergoes great retrogression,” and 
there may be “ a very short groove, or none, and no glands,” as in Donas 
and Tellina; “sometimes the groove and cavity are present, but no 
glands exist,” as in Nucula, while in others “only a delicate blind canal 
can be distinguished, formed by a simple layer of epithelial cells,” as in 
PsammoMa. And in few forms is there a complete absence of groove, 
cavity, or glands. Pholas and Solen are examples of the few. 

Professor Barrois has examined more than 50 species and, accord- 
ing to his views, representatives of “every family except the Trigoniidse 
and Tridacnid®,” and, inasmuch as the byssus and its associated struct- 
ures are so generally developed, “he is inclined to regard it as a char- 
acteristic organ of the Lamellibrach type.” 

The so-called aquiferous pores are thought by Professor Barrois to be 
“nothing more than the orifices of degraded byssogenous glands.” It 
is his opinion that, “if water does really enter the cirulatory system,” 
it “must do so by fine intercellular canals, or by endosmosis, or some 
other way,” but not through the aquiferous pores. ( Comptes Bendiis, 
Acad. Sc. Paris, v. — , pp. 188-190 ; B. M. S. (2), v. 5, pp. 227, 228.) 

Structure of bivalve shells. — The bivalve shells have been considered 
by W. Muller with reference to the attachment existing between the 
mantle of the animal and the shell Two varieties are recognized. In 
one the shell is only attached at certain areas to the mantle, and “the 
organic substance of the mother-of-pearl layer is membranous”; this 
phase is exhibited by almost all members of the class. In the other 
variety the shell is “continuously grown to the mantle,” and “the or- 
ganic substance of the mother-of-pearl layer forms a network;” this 
condition, so far as known, is only exemplified in the little fresh water 
clam-like shells known as Sph®riidffi or Cycladid®. [Zool. Anzeiger, 
V, 8, pp. 70-75 ; J. B. M. 8. (2), v. 5, pp. 230.)

Gastropods. 

The wings or cephalic appendges of Fteropods . — The homologies of the 
wing-like anterior appendages of the Pteropods are still involved in 
doubt. In the gymnosomatons forrns, especially of the genera Olione, 
Clionopsis, or Pneumodermou, there are always two pairs of tentacles, 
and Dr. Pelseneer believes that they are ‘‘homologous with the two 
pairs of the euthyneurous Gastropods.” In thecosmatous Pteropods, 
there is a pair of tentacles so reduced as to be rudimentary, and if the 
species do not have eyes when adult, they have them in some stage of 
development; these tentacles are homologous with the posterior or 
nuchal oculiferotis tentacles of the gymnosomatons Pteropods, while the 
absence of the anterior is to be explained by the swimming lobes en- 
circling the head. ‘‘Most of the gymnosomata have a pair of buccal 
appendages between the two pairs of tentacles, and these, though 
varied in aspect, are probably similar in origin ; it is explained how, in 
Clione, they are really inserted on the external wall of the buccal cavity 
just as in Cirrifer and Pneumodermon; but at the same time it is to be 
remembered that this part of the buccal cavity is an introvert and not 
a true part of the oral cavity.” {Quart. Journ. Micr. Soc., v. 25, pp. 
491-509, 1 pi.; J.B.M. S. (3), v. 6,p. 53.) 

The eyes of Gastropods . — An investigation of the eyes of Gastropods 
has been undertaken by Dr. 0. Hilger. It appears that there are two 
kinds of optic organs developed in ordinary forms. In the first a rudi- 
mentary condition is manifested in that the eye “forms but a slight in- 
vagination of the epithelium of the body;” this condition is exemplified 
in the Rhipidoglossate and Docoglossate mollusks, as in the genera 
Margarita, Trochus, Haliotis, Pissurella, and Patella. In the second, 
“the eye forms a complete closed capsule, which is invested by connec- 
tive tissue.” This condition is manifested in the Pectinibranchiates, 
such as the genera Murex, ilassa, Picus, Oyprsea, and Conus. 

In the former type “the eye has the form of a cup or bell shaped 
invagination of the epithelium of the body,” and “in most cases, the 
cuticle seems to be developed as a very thin lamella over the anterior 
part of the vitreous body ; the invagination is lined by the retina, which 
anteriorly passes directly into the epithelium of the body and is in- 
vested externally by the outspread optic nerve.” In the ear-shells 
(Haliotis) and top-shells (Trochus) “the cavity is filled by a delicate 
gelatinous substance, and in Patella and Nacella by a finely granulated 
mass.” 

In those forms in which the eyes are more developed “the larger and 
hinder i)art of the corpuscle is formed by the retina and the outspread 
optic nerve, while it is closed anteriorly by the inner cell-layer of 
the pellucida. Within there is either a lens or vitreous body or both,” 
and “the eye is completely invested by the connective tissue of the ten- 
tacle,” or, as it has been more definitely named, the ommatophor.

Hilger, published in the Morphologische Jahrbuch, and a fuller abstract 
in the Journal of the Eoyal Microscopical Society. {Morphol. Jahrb.,

The relations of Sequenzia . — The small mollusks to which the generic 
name Sequenzia has been given, and which, on account of the appear- 
ance of the shell, have been supposed to be related to the Solariids by 
some, and by others to the Trochids, have, it seems, been quite misun- 
derstood. Prof. A. E. Verrill found in the dredgings of the United 
States Fish Commission living examples of the genus, and, on exami- 
nation of the radula and jaws, determined the affinities of the form to 
be quite different. Professor YerrilLapproximates the genus (which he 
raises to the rank of a family) to the Aporrhaidae, and consequently in 
the group or suborder of Taenioglossa instead of the Ptenoglossa or 
Ehipidoglossa. 

The family is definable as Taenioglossates with ovate jaws having a 
tesselated surface and denticulated edge; teeth of the central row small 
and with a denticle, of the inner lateral smaller and with curved, unarmed 
tips, and of the two outer lateral slender, sharp, and strongly curved; 
shell trochiform,its aperture irregular, with a posterior sinus and a short 
or rudimentary canal or sinus, with a pearly luster, and decussating 
sculpture, and operculum thin, rounded-ovate, with a subcentral nucleus 
and five concentric lines. {Trans. Conn. Acad. Arts & Sci., v. 6, pp. 
186-191.) 

The animal of A deorhis . — There is a small shell, of a discoid form, found 
along the European coasts, as to whose relations there have been con- 
siderable doubts ; its generally accepted name is Adeorbis subcarinatus. 
The doubts as to its affinities could only be solved by an examination 
of the anatomy of the animal. This has been undertaken during the 
past year by Mr. Paul Fischer. He found that the radula has sixty- 
eight transverse rows of teeth, each row consisting of seven teeth ; the 
central is wide and trapezoidal, and has a reflected summit and basal 
cusps ; the lateral teeth are rhomboid and each has a long, stalk-like 
lateral process ; the inner marginal are long, narrow, and denticulated 
along its external margin ; the external still narrower and with entire 
margins. It appears, therefore, that Adeorbis has no relations with the 
Trochids or Cyclostrematids to which some conchologists have been dis- 
posed to refer it, and that its affinities are really with the Skeneids and 
Eissoids, as has been long suspected by others. {Trans. Conn. Acad. 
Arts & Sci., V. 6.) 

The relations of Truncatella . — Along the shores of many countries be- 
tween tide-marks or even above normal high-water marlj are found cer- 
tain small mollusks having an elongated turreted shell, truncated at 
the summit, and with a subcircular aperture. These mollusks belong

to the family named Truncatellidm, and they have been generally asso- 
ciated with the Oyclostomids and allied animals and considered to be 
true air-breathing and lung-bearing gastropods. The correctness of 
this view however was long ago challenged, and its incorrectness 
has been shown during the past year by Dr. A. Vayssiere. The 
study of the respiratory apparatus of the animal reveals the fact that 
it is a true gill or branchia, which is placed transversely to the longitu- 
dinal axis of the body; has itself an elongated form and is composed of 
twelve to fifteen triangular lamellae, arranged in a row, but each almost 
entirely independent of its fellows. On the surface of the lamellae, and 
especially toward the free extremity, there are vibratile ciliae which deter- 
mine the movements of the water around the organ. It is, therefore, 
says Dr. Vayssiere, undeniable that the respiration of the animal is by 
means of branchiae. The mollusk lives in a moist atmosphere, although 
not in the water, and therefore it keeps stored up in its respiratory cavity 
a certain amount of water which is renewed every time that the tides 
cover its station. Dr. Vaysseire adds some details on the habits of 
individuals kept in confinement. They had been found on the sea bor- 
der more or less ensconced in the muddy ooze and in the midst of ddbris 
cast on the shore, consisting largely of decaying fruit and animals. The 
Truncatellas did not appear to be at all affected by the odor of the decay- 
ing matter. They could remain out of the water and in an atmosphere 
saturated with the vapor, and could live many days without suffering, 
but moisture was necessary and they soon succumbed to dryness. Their 
progress is peculiar, and the movements of the animal recall those of 
the geometrical caterpillars. Normally and when in the water it uses 
only its foot in walking, and does not employ its proboscis save in ex- 
ceptional cases, and when a special demand is made upon its strength, 
as when it is creeping upon a vertical and smooth surface, such as the 
sides of a glass globe. Previous observers, who stated that it always 
uses its proboscis, were misled by the fact that the mollusk, in its prog- 
ress (which resembles that of the geometrical caterpillars), performs 
with the anterior part of its body (the proboscis) a certain looping move- 
ment. This movement, which at the same time entails an approach of 
the extremity of the proboscis to the ground, leads one to suppose that 
this plays a role in its progress, and one is the more disposed to 
believe this, as the mouth, which is at the extremity of the proboscis, has 
^ ery much the appearance of a sucker. 

The food of the little animal is chiefly composed of microscopic ani- 
malcules (such as Infusorians, Amcebas, Foraminifers, &c.), as well as 
the decomposing remains of algse and other aquatic plants. {Journ. 
de Conchyl. (3) v. 25, pp. 255-288, pi. 12, 13.) 

North American Land Slugs and Shells . — The terrestrial Gastropods of 
North America, north of Mexico, which have been treated of to such 
an extent by Mr. W. G. Binney, have been submitted to a renewed ex- 


782 


SCIENTIFIC KECOED FOR 1885. 


amination by the same gentleman. The . results have appeared in a new 
volume, entitled “ A Manual of American Land Shells,” which consti- 
tutes “No. 28” of the Bulletin of the U. S. National Museum. 

The treatment is essentially the -eame as that in Mr. Binney’s previ- 
ous publications, but instead of the species being arranged in a regular 
systematic order they are distributed geographically under several cat- 
egories: (a) those “ universally distributed ; ” (6) those of the “ Pacific 
province ; ” (c) those of the “ central province ; ” (d) species of the 
“ eastern province,” and the “northern region ” thereof ; (e) species of 
the “ eastern province” and the “interior region;” (/) species of the 
“ eastern province ” and the “ southern region,” and (g) those “ locally 
introduced.” 

After a brief introduction on (1) the “ habits and properties,” (2) 
“ geographical distribution,” (3) the “ generative organs,” (4) the “jaws 
and lingual dentition,” and (5) the “ classification,” the author enters 
upon the description of the species under the geographical categories 
enumerated. 

With Dr. Fischer, he divides the Geophilous Pulmonates (to which 
the volume is restricted) into two groups (1) the Monotremata, dis- 
tinguished by having common or contiguous external male and female 
orifices, including almost all of the species, and (2) the Ditremata, em- 
bracing those forms in which the external male and female orifices are 
widely separated. Of the latter group only two species of the family 
Veronicellidse and two of the Onchidiidae have been observed within 
the limits mentioned. 

The Monotremata are divided into eleven families. These families do 
not always appear to be very natural and sometimes discordant forms 
have been combined in one, and sometimes forms for which no differ- 
ential characters have been noticed have been referred to distinct fami- 
lies. 

A r4sum6 of those families to which distinctive characters can be 
given seems appropriate in this connection. 

I. The Glandinid® include those forms which are entirely destitute of 
a jaw, and whose teeth are of only one kind, all being elongated, narrow, 
and aculeate, while the mantle is submedian or postmedian and entirely 
included in the shell, which itself is elongated or turreted. Of this 
family five are enumerated as species of the genus Glandina. These, in 
Mr. Binney’s plan, belong to the family Testacellid®. 

II. The Selenitid® constitute a group, recently recognized by Dr. 
Fletcher, of which the jaw is ribless, the teeth are of nearly the same 
character as those of the Glandinid® and are aculeate, the median one 
being either suppressed or very small, and the mantle is submedian or 
posterior and included within the shell, which latter is spiral and helici- 
form. The species of this group are referred by Mr. Binney to the ge- 
nus Macroyclis, and six are recognized as inhabitants of the North 
American fauna. 


ZOOLOGY.

III. The Yitrinidse may be considered as embracing the Monotrema- 
tous Geophila, with a jaw which is smooth or striated (destitute of ribs) 
and has a median projection to the cutting edge ; teeth differentiated 
into a central tricuspid one, “ laterals of about the same height as cen- 
trals, bicuspid or tricuspid, but in latter case furnished with an ob- 
solete inner cusp ; marginal teeth differing from the laterals, aculeate 
unicuspid or bicuspid,” and a heliciform shell. This family embraces 
about fifty -two species, which are referred by Mr. Binney to the Lima- 
cidae. 

lY. The Bulimulidae include forms which have the jaw thin, and pro- 
vided with distant transverse ribs, the teeth “ peculiar by the elongation 
and incurvation of the inner cusp of the lateral ” ones, and the mantle 
included in the shell which, itself is more or less elongated and turreted. 
Nine species, referred to the genus Bulimulus, are represented in North 
America, and are chiefly found in the southwestern regions. 

Y. The Stenogyridae include forms which have the ‘^jaw ribbed or 
finely wrinkled, thin, arched;” the teeth differentiated into (1) a small 
central tooth, (2) tricuspid lateral teeth having the “ central cusp long 
and narrow ” and “ side cusps of subequal length,” and (3) “ marginal 
teeth, quadrate, very low, wide,” and “ tricuspid or multifld ; ” the man- 
tle included, and the “ shell generally elongated, polygyral, shining,” 
and with its “apex more or less obtuse.” The six North American 
species are referred to the genera Stenogyra, Ferrussaoia, and Caecilian- 
ella. 

YI. The Helicidse have a jaw of a single piece (generally arcuate, 
often ribbed), teeth differentiated into (1) “centrals unicuspid or tricus- 
pid,” (2)“ laterals unicuspid, bicuspid, ortricuspid,butwith theinnercusp 
obsolete,” and (3) “marginals quadrate, low, wide;” the mantle sub- 
median and included in the shell, and the shell spiral and diversiform. 
The American representatives are distributed by Mr. Binney among 
two families, the Helicidse and Pupidse, but the only differences noticed 
are as to degrees of exsertion of the spire. The gradations from a dis- 
coid helix to an elongated turreted or pupiform shell are so gradual 
and numerous (especially when foreign forms are taken into account) 
that no advantage seems to result from the distinction of the two groups. 
Including both types and eliminating the genera Arion, Ariolimax, Pro- 
physaon Binneya, Hemphillia, and the Punctum pygmsBum or minutis- 
simum, one hundred and sixty-seven species have been admitted by Mr. 
Binney into tbe North -American fauna and distributed among twenty- 
six genera. 

YII. The Limacidse may be restricted to species having the jaws rib- 
less, the dentition divided into (1) a “ central tooth tricuspid,” (2) lat- 
erals of same height as central, bicuspid or tricuspid, and (3) “mar- 
ginal teeth differing from the laterals, aculeate, unicuspid or bicuspid,” 
the mantle anterior, small, narrow, and shield-like in appearance, and 
the shell reduced to a rudiment and concealed under the mantle. All 


784 


SCIENTIFIC EECOED FOE 1885. 


the North American species are referred by Mr. Binuey to the genus 
Limax and are seven in number. 

VIII. The Ariouidse include forms which have the jaw entire and 
transversely ribbed ; the teeth of three types, (1) a wide central ob- 
scurely tricuspid; (2) lateral, “ like the centrals but asymmetrical by the 
supijression of the inner lower lateral expansion of the base of attach- 
ment,” and (3) marginals quadrate, low and wide; the mantle anterior, 
small and shield-like, and the shell represented by a small flat plate or 
granules. The North American species are referred to two genera, 
Arion with two species (one introduced from Europe) and Ariolimax 
with five. These species are interposed between genera of the Helicidae 
by Mr. Binney. 

IX. The Philomycidae have a “jaw with or without anterior ribs, 
and median projection or cutting edge,” teeth distinguishable into cen- 
tral, lateral, and marginal; a mantle covering the whole body, and the 
shell entirely suppressed. Four species are found within our limits, all 
of which are referred to the genera Tebennophorus, although there are 
two quite distinct forms which seem to have been confounded in it. 
The names used by Professor Morse are Tebennophorus and Pallifei’a. 

X. The Orthalicidse are forms which have a peculiar jaw in that it 
is “ thick, solid, composed of a median triangular piece, with base cor- 
responding to upper margin of jaw, and near the apex of which con- 
verge on either side oblique imbricated plates, tree below, adherent 
above.” The teeth are distinguished into “ central and lateral teeth with 
quadrangular base, with central cusp more or less obtuse, generally very 
much expanded, with rudimentary side cusps ” and “ marginal teeth 
quadrate, of same type;” the mantle is posteripr and included, and 
the shell spiral and turreted. Two species are found in Florida belong- 
ing to the genera Orthalicus and Liguus. 

XI. The Punctidae include forms with the “jaw low, wide, slightly 
arcuate, with blunt, squarely truncated ends, “disintegrated into many” 
(about sixteen) “ separate pieces, each higher than wide, with small 
overlapping edges ; ” the teeth are quite peculiar (but most like those 
of the Auriculidae) and represented only by centrals and laterals hav- 
ing bases of attachment longer than wide, expanded below and squarely 
truncated, and free portions narrowed and reflected ; ” the mantle is 
submedian, and the shell heliciform. Not more than one species is cer- 
tainly known within our limits. It is the Helix minutissima or Punc- 
tum minutissimum of most American authors, but it is regarded by Mr. 
Binuey as being identical with a European species and called by him 
Microphysa pygmaea. 

XII. The Succiniidae have a jaw surmounted bj’ an accessory quad- 
rangular plate, teeth difi'erentiated into (1) a central tricuspid, (2) lat- 
eral which are tricuspid or bicuspid, and (3) marginal of a quadrate form 
“with narrow base, multicuspid reflection, serrate by the splitting of 
the inner cusp into numerous denticles;” mantle more or less included

in the shell, and the shell more or less developed, spiral, thin, and trans- 
parent. The I7orth American species are all referred to the genus Suc- 
cinea by Mr. Binney, and twenty-six species are recognized. 

All of the forms now noticed belong to the group Monotremata (or 
Syntremata) as previously noted, and only four species belong to the 
remaining twn families of Ditremata. 

The Yeronicellidae have a “jaw slightly arcuate, with numerous ver- 
tical ribs;” teeth differentiated into (1) “ centrals, narrow, unicuspid, 
with expanded sides,” (2) “laterals large, obscurely tricuspid,” and with 
“medium cusp sharp and long,” and (3) “marginals with quadrate 
base short, triangular, unicuspid,” and mantle not distinct from general 
integument ; ” the shell is entirely suppressed. Two species have been 
found in the United States, one in Florida and the other in California; 
both are terrestrial. 

The Ouchidiidse have the “jaw entirely smooth or lightly wrinkled,” 
teeth differentiated into “central tooth, tricuspid lateral teeth, and margi- 
nals with quadrate base, razor-shaped,” having the “base long and with 
cutting point narrow” and “ medium cusp truncated and very long;” the 
mantle is “ thick, more or less tuberculous above,” and no shell is de- 
veloped. The two hTorth American species belong to the genus Onchi- 
della, one (O. borealis) occurring from Prince William’s Sound to Yan- 
couver’s Island, and the other (O. Oarpenteri) from the Straits of Fuca 
to the Gulf of California. 

Differences among the slugs. — Some of the European malacologists ad- 
mit numerous species of Slugs as of the families Limacidae and Arionidse 
on slight differences of form, proportions, and coloration, but the pro- 
priety of so doing has been questioned by Mr. S. Jourdain, who thinks 
that the differences that have generally been made use of for specific 
distinctions vary with age as well as habitat. He therefore urges that 
investigation should be directed to the internal organs and especially to 
the arrangement of the generative apparatus. “ The pedal gland is also 
of service ; it contains a cylindrical excretory canal which extends 
more or less along the median line, and receives the mucoso-glandular 
secretions of the lobules of a racemose gland on either side of it; the 
internal fape of the canal is vibratile. In the Limacidae it arises as an 
invagination of the ectoderm, and subsequently becomes branched; the 
extremities of the branches are invested by mesodermic cells which rap- 
idly become secretory.” On differences discernible in the characters iii 
question, Mr. Jourdain distinguishes five species occurring in the en- 
virons of St. Yaast la-Hougue : these are four of the family Limacidae 
and one of Arionidae. ( Gomptes Eendus, Acad. Sci. v. 101, pp. 963-966.

been found in the palaeozoic rocks outside of North America, but in the

western continent seven species have heenfound in Carboniferous and De- 
vonian deposits — six in the former and one in the latter. During the past 
year however, Dr. Paul Fischer has described a species referable to the 
genus Dendropupa from a Permian deposit at Sa6ne-et-Loire. The new 
species is related, in Dr. Fischer’s opinion, to the first-discovered species 
of the genus Dendropupa (D. vetusta), found in the coal-joggins of Nova 
Scotia, but the form is difierent, and although larger, there are only seven 
(instead of nine) whorls. Only a single cast of the species was found 
in the midst of various vegetable remains. The form has been named 
Dendropupa Wolchiarum. (Journ. de Conchyl. (3), v. 25, pp. 99-105.) 

Characteristics of Tectibranchiate Gastropods . — In the firstpartof a work 
devoted to zoological and anatomical researches on the Opisthobranchi- 
ate mollusks of the Gulf of Marseilles, Dr. A. Vayssibre has treated of 
the Tectibranchiates. The memoir is valuable on account of the use 
made in it of characteristics which have hitherto been neglected. The 
author, with Dr. Fischer, divides the group into three divisions, named 
Cephalaspidea, Anaspidea, and Notaspidea. Besides much other infor- 
mation, details are given as to the food of various forms. Some are 
carnivorous, such as species of Scaphander, Philine, and Doridium ; 
others are omnivorous, like Gastropteron and Pleurobranchus, and still 
others are completely herbivorous, as the sea-hares (Aplysia) and No- 
tarchus. {Recherches zoologiques et anatomiques sur les mollusques opis- 
thobranches du Golfe de Marseilles, 181 pp.; Journ. de Conchyl. (3), v. 25, 
pp. 206-209.) 

Cephalopods. 

Cartilages of Sepia. — The “cartilages occurring in the head of Sepia” 
have been examined by W. D. Haliburton. “The basis of the cartilage 
is a chordrin-like body, which gives the re-action of macen and gelatine. 
But the gelatinous element is exceedingly small and no gelatinization 
occurs on the cooling of the hot-water extract. The cartilage differs 
however from that of vertebrates in containing a small percentage of 
chitin.” In /Sepm the percentage is 1-22 per cent. {Quart. Journ. Micr. 
Sc., V. 25, pp. 173-181 ; J. B. M. S. (2), v. 5, p. 222.) 

PROTOCHORDATBS. 

• Tunicates. 

Relations of Tunicates. — An elaborate monograph of the genus Bolio- 
lum has been published by Dr. B. IJljanin as a contribution to the 
“Fauna und Flora des Golfes von Neapel (x, 1884), and in it are detailed 
the structural characteristics and the embryology. Various mooted 
questions as to the morphology and relationships of the group, as well as 
the Tunicates in general, are considered. The author inclines to the view 


ZOOLOGY. 


787 


that the Tunicates “ represent a side branch of the vertebrate phylum, 
whose point of ori^n is near its root.” The Apperdiculariids are “ re- 
garded as the most primitive representatives of the group ; they give 
rise to the simple Ascidians ; thence there branched off the Solpidoe on 
the one band, and the compound Ascidians on the other; the latter 
gave rise to the social Ascidians, to Botryllus and to Pyrosoma, while 
the primitive stock was continued on through Anchonia to Poliolum.^’’ 
Of course these views are to a large extent hypothetical, and perhaps, 
or even quite likely, wrong in some details, but so far as they are legiti- 
mate deductions from a careful and detailed study, are valuable as well 
as suggestive for further investigation. [J. B. M. 8. (2), v. 6, pp. 231- 
233.)

The North American Fish Fauna. — The “ Synopsis of the fishes of 
North America ” by Profs. David S. Jordan and Charles S. Gilbert, 
pubUshed early in 1883, has been followed duriug the past year by a 
Catalogue of the fishes known to inhabit the waters of North America 
north of the tropic of Cancer, with notes on the species discovered in 
1883 and 1884,” by Prof. David Starr Jordau. Since the publication of 
the synopsis, in 1883, “ an active study of North American fishes has 
brought to light many species not included in the synopsis, and has 
shown various errors in the nomenclature of species already known. 
The additions are chiefly in the Bassalian or deep-sea fauna of the At- 
lantic, in the tropical fauna of the Florida Keys, and in the fresh-water 
fauna of the lower part of the Mississippi Yalley,” regions recently re- 
examined. Professor Jordan has also extended the range adopted in the 
synopsis so that the new catalogue represents ‘‘ the present state of our 
knowledge of the fishes found north of the tropic of Cancer in American 
waters.” In the new catalogue, 1,683 species are adopted, and in addi- 
tion 187 subspecies are recognized, giving a total of 1,870 species and 
subspecies. These species are segregated under 587 genera and 157 
families. Several of the comprehensive genera and families of the syn- 
opsis have been now disintegrated, more natural and better definable 
groups being recognized in their iflace. In a “recapitulation,” an as- 
signment of the species to the various faunas is made. In regard to 
many of them, such an assignment, in the words of Professor Jordan’, 
is “ simply arbitrary, and in this fact lies the chief element of error in the 
following list. Thus many Arctic shore fishes belong to the Bassalian 
fauna of New England, while many West Indian species occur north- 
ward, more or less frequently as far as Cape Cod.” It must be added, 
too, that “ no species is counted twice, but in each case of the numerous 
species which range over several faunal areas, each is referred to that 
area which is supposed to be most properly its home, or to that in which

The Fishes of Tropieal America . — After having elaborated all the spe- 
cies of fishes of temperate and arctic America, Prof. David S. Jordan 
addressed himself to a preparation of a list of the fishes found along the 
Pacific coast of tropical America from the Tropic of Cancer to Panama. 
The species of this region were almost unknown a quarter of a century 
ago, and, in the words of Professor Jordan, “our knowledge of these 
species is due chiefly to the studies of Dr. Gill, Dr. Gunther, Dr. Stein- 
dachner, and Professors Jordan and Gilbert. Only a few collectors 
have given especial attention to the fish fauna of this region, but the 
work of these has, in nearly all cases, been of exceptional value. The 
earliest extensive collections were made by Mr. John Xantus at Cape 
San Lucas, and later at Colima. The specimens obtained by Xantus 
comprise especially the fishes of the rock i)ools. These were studied 
by Dr. Gill in 1862 and by Professor Gilbert and the writer in 1882. ” 
Since that early time, however, numerous other collectors have obtained 
fishes, and among the most prominent of these are Captain John M. 
Dow, Mr. Osbert Sal vie. Dr. Franz Steindachner, Prof. Frank Bradley, 
Dr. Bocourt, and, last and greatest, Messrs. Jordan and Gilbert. Alto- 
gether 407 species have been obtained, and these represent 187 genera 
and 68 families. A comparison of these with the Caribbean and Gnlf 
of Mexico fauna is interesting and instructive. According to Professor 
Jordan’s identifications, 71 species, or 17J per cent., are found also on the 
Atlantic coasts. If we add to this some 800 species now known from 
the Caribbean Sea and adjacent shores, we have about 6 per cent, of the 
whole number known, as common to the two coasts. This number, 71, 
is not very definitely ascertained, as there must be considerable differ- 
ence of opinion as to the boundaries of species, and as several of these 
species regarded as common are open to doubt and need verification.” 
Professor Jordan believes however that “fuller investigations will not 
increase the proportions of common species, and, if it does not, the two 


ZOOLOGY, 


789 


faunas show no greater resemblances than the similarity of physical con- 
ditions on the two sides would lead us to expect. 

These conclusions contrast with those of Dr. Gunther. “Dr. Giinther 
assumes that nearly one-third of the total number of species of marine 
fishes on the two shores of tropical America will be found to be iden- 
tical. Hence he infers that there must have been, at a comparatively 
recent date, a depression of the isthmus, producing an intermingling 
of the two faunas,” 

Professor Jordan explains that “this discrepancy arises from the 
comparatively limited representation of the two faunae at the disposal 
of Dr. Gunther. He enumerates 193 marine or brackish- water species, 
as found on the two coasts, 59 of which are regariled by him as speci- 
fically identical, this being 31 per cent, of the whole. But in 30 of these 
59 cases” Professor Jordan regards “ the assumption of complete identity 
as erroneous, so that, taking the number 193, as given,” he would “re- 
duce the percentage to 15. But these 193 species form but a fragment 
of the total fauna, and any conclusions based on such narrow dfita are 
certain to be misleading.” 

Some data respecting the supposed con-specific forms are interesting. 
“ Of the 71 identical species admitted in our list, several (e. rjr., Mola^ Or- 
cynus) are pelagic fishes, common to most warm seas ; still others (e. g., 
Trachuriifij Caranx, Diodon sp.) are almost cosmopolitan in the tropical 
waters ; most of the others {e. g., GoMus, GerreSj Centroponms, Galeich- 
thys sp., &c.) often ascend the rivers of the tropics, and we may account 
for their dilfusion, perhaps, as we account for the dispersion of fresh- 
water fishes on the isthmus, on the supposition that they may have 
crossed from marsh to marsh at some time in the rainy season.” But 
“ in very few cases are representatives of any species from opposite 
sides of the isthmus exactly alike in all respects. These difierences in 
some cases seem worthy of specific value, giving ‘ us representative spe- 
cies,’ on the two sides. In other cases, the distinctions are very trivial, 
but in most cases they are appreciable, es])ecially on fresh specimens.” 

Finally, Professor Jordan is “ brought to the conclusion that the fish 
faun® of the two shores of Central America are substantially distinct, 
so far as species are concerned, and that the resemblance between them 
is not so great as to necessitate the hypothesis of the recent existence 
of a channel across the isthmus, permitting the fishes to pass from one 
side to the other.” 

These results are especially noteworthy inasmuch as they confirm 
and are themselves corroborated by the results of studies of various 
other classes of the animal kingdom. {Proc. U. 8. Nat. Mus.^ v. 8, pp. 
361-394.)

SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1885. 


A. Haswell, of Sj'dnej', Australia, entitled “Studies ou the Elasinobranch 
Skeleton.” That uaturalist examined the complete skeletons or skulls 
of 17 species of Selachians, and has described the essential peculiarities 
of the skull, visceral arches, shoulder girdle, pectoral fins, and pelvic 
fins, as well as dorsal, anal, and caudal. The results of his examina- 
tions are embodied in a summary in which he recapitulates the essential 
characters of the various families and including groups. 

Professor Haswell recognizes for the plagios tomes generally two 
orders, the Selachoidea and the Batoidei, which are characterized as 
follows : 

The Selachoidei are distinguished in that “ in the skull the post-orbi- 
tal processes are usually well developed ; the orbit is usually providefl 
with a cartilaginous floor formed of the basal plate ; there is always a 
palato-basal articulation ; the rostrum usually consists of three bars 
with large foramina at the base. There are a series of external branch- 
ial arches ; the first branchial arch never articulates with the skull ; 
the hyo-arch is supported by the hyo-mandibular ; the copula of the 
hyoid has the form of a broad plate connected with its distal extremity. 
The pectoral fin is not connected with the skull by means of an ant- 
orbital cartilage ; the ventral portion of the pectoral arch is divided in the 
middle by a more flexible portion into two lateral halves usually slightly 
movable on each other, and the dorsal extremities do not articulate with 
the spinal column. The pro- and meta-pterygia of the ])ectoral fin are 
never greatly elongated, and usually have the form of relatively broad 
plates.” 

The Batoidei are recognized as an order contrasted with the Sel- 
achoidei in the following terms: “ The post-orbital processes are small 
or absent 5 the orbit is devoid of cartilaginous floor. Inhere is no palato- 
basal articulation. The rostrum, when present, is usually imperforate 
at the base. There are no external branchial arches ; the first branchial 
arch is sometimes directly connected by the hyo mandibular with the 
skull. When the hyoid arch is supported by the hyo mandibular the 
articulation takes place near the proximal extremity of the latter. The 
ventral portion of the pectoral arch forms a continuous rigid bar; the 
dorsal extremities of the arch are connected either with the spinal 
column or with one another. The pro- and meta-pterygia of the pectoral 
fins have the form of elongated narrow bars, and the mesoi^terygium 
is insignificant. The anterior portion of the pectoral fin is connected 
by a cartilage — the ant-orbital cartilage — with the ethmoidal region of 
the skull.” 

The Selachoidei, or sharks, are disintegrated into two “ suborders,” 
named Palaeoselachii and Ifeoselachii. Professor Haswell considers 
this grouping to “follow as a necessary conclusion from the researches 
of Gegenbaur on the anatomy of the skull.” The subor ders are distin- 
guished by the following characters : 

In the Palseoselachii “ the occipital region of the skull is not so 
sharply marked off from the spinal column as in other Elasmoranchii ; 


ZOOLOGY.

it presents above a mesial ridge continuous with the spinous processes 
and at the sides ridges continuous with the line of the transverse proc- 
esses. The plane of the occipital region is vertical or inclined from 
below upwards and backwards. ‘ There is no lateral occipito-vertebral 
articulation. The principal vagus foramen is placed far from the fora- 
men magnum ; the lower roots of the nerve pass out by from three to 
five distinct canals which are in the line with the foramina for the spi- 
nal nerves. The vestibulum forms a distinct eminence on the surface 
of the infero-plateral portion of the auditory region. The articular sur- 
face for the hyo-mandibular is simple, and not sharply marked off from 
surrounding parts. The post-orbital process presents an articular sur- 
face for the palato- quadrate. The orbit has no cartilaginous floor. 
There is an ethmoidal canal. There is no tri-radiate rostrum. Eepre- 
senting the ant-orbital cartilage of rays is an ant-orbital process. There 
are either six or seven branchial arches; the external arches are incom- 
plete. There is only one dorsal fin ; its rays are supported by a broad 
basal cartilage.” 

In the Neoselachii “the centra of the vertebrae are well ossified. The 
occipital region is well marked off from the vertebral column. The plane 
of the foramen magnum is vertical or slopes forwards. The principal 
vagus foramen is usually approximated to the foramen magnum, and 
there is never a row of accessory foramina in line with the foramina of 
spinal nerves. There is no distinct elevation on the surface of the skull 
marking the position of the vestibule. The articular surface for the 
hyo-mandibular is complex. The post-orbital process never presents 
an articular surface for the palato-quadrate. The orbit has a cartila- 
ginous floor. There is no process representing the ant-orbital cartilage 
of the rays. There are never more than five branchial arches. There 
are two dorsal fins, which may or may not present broad basal carti- 
lages.” 

The suborder Palseoselachii is represented by only one family, the 
Hotidanidae, while the Neoselachii examined by Professor Haswell are 
differentiated by him into the families Cestraciontidae, Lamnidae, Scyl- 
liolamnidae, Scyllidae, Ehinidae, and Pristiophoridae. 

Fishes or Teleostomes. 

Pterospis and Scapbaspis. — In a Devonian bed in Galacian Podolia 
(Eussian-Poland) were found two shields, one a Pterospis and the other 
a Seapbaspis united, and universily opposite each, and giving the im- 
pression that they were in natural union ; the Pterospis, however, pro- 
jected further forwards than the Seapbaspis. It has therefore been 
urged by Dr. A. Altb that the Pterotpis was the dorsal and the Scaphas- 
pis the inferior buckler of the same fish. The mouth is thought to 
liave been in the inter-space between the two shields and thus to have 
been somewhat inferior. {Abhandl. Sitz. Per. Akad. Krahan, v. 11, pp.

SCIENTIFIC EECOED FOE 1885. 


The Burramundi . — One of the most interesting of all fishes is an in- 
habitant of certain Australian rivers, and is known to some of the 
English settlers of the country as the salmon and flathead ; its native 
name is Burramundi. It has no resemblance whatever in form to the 
salmon and has been called so only because its flesh is pinkish like the 
salmon’s. In shajie it perhaps more resembles or rather has less dis- 
similarity to the fresh water ophiocephalids of India or to a thick eel 
than to any common or well known fish. This resemblance results from 
its elongated subcylindrical form and the gradual tapering of its tail 
backward to the confluence of the dorsal, anal, and caudal fins. The 
head is depressed, wedge-shaped, and covered with a bony armature. 
The scales, which are almost confined to the body (although slightly 
encroaching upon the vertical fins), are large and have a peculiar 
structure. Its chief interest results from the fact that it is the repre- 
sentative of a family of fishes which is represented by numerous species 
in the secondary geological age in the northern hemisphere, and it was 
supposed, until 1870, to have become extinct at the end of the Triassic 
epoch. It was therefore a matter of the greatest astonishment to all 
naturalists when a species of the type was discovered living in the fresh 
waters of Southern Australia, and the living representative of the 
ancient family v^as found to be so nearly related to the extinct forms 
that it has been regarded by most naturalists as belonging to the typi- 
cal genus Oeratodus. It exhibits however differences of dentition re- 
moving it from any of the extinct forms, and there is no evidence that the 
secondary species had a skeleton or scales generically similar to those 
of the living representatives ; it has therefore by a few naturalists, 
been regarded as belonging to a i)eculiar generic type known as Ifeo- 
ceratodus. The ceratodonts are remarkable likewise on account of 
their nasal apertures opening into the palate, in which respect however 
they agree with two other living types of Dipnoous fishes, although 
differing from all others of the class except them. The assiduous re- 
searches of various naturalists have at length given us a tolerable insight 
into the life history of the Burramundi. It is confined to certainrivers of 
South Australia, and its headquarters seem to be in the Burnett Eiver. 
Its mode of progression is by waves of the tail or by paddling with the 
I)ectoral fins without moving the posterior pair of fins or the tail. 
When at rest on the bottom of the tank the pectora ls are placed nearly 
at right angles to the body while the hinder fins are brought nearly 
parallel to the tail. If not disturbed it will remain in this position for 
hours, and only when stirred up does it think it necessary to use the 
fins and tail at all. It then lurches out with the great strong tail turn- 
ing sidewise and squeezes in between some tufts of grass. Professor 
Bamsey endeavored to urge it to make some progress in only afew inches 
of water, but, as far as he could experiment, without effect. The fish is 
exceedingly eel-like in its movements, and when going slowly along the 
swag ing of the great caudal fin entails a serpentine course. It is the 


« 


ZOOLOGY. 


793 


opinion of Professor Ramsey that the fish could not get forward in a 
straight line unless swimming very fast or very slowly at the time, 
and when it does this it does not use the tad at all, but depends upon 
the pectorals. The Neoceratodus has been said to frequently leave the 
water and go upon land, and the possession of fully developed lungs 
seems to warrant such a belief, but Professor Ramsey doubts whether 
it ever goes quite out of the water, as has been reported, for the simple 
reason that the fish is too bulky to progress by the fins, and not long 
enough in the body to go eel-fashion ; at any rate, individuals in con- 
finement decidedly objected to being kept any length of time out of 
water; they put up with it a few minutes and then began to plunge 
about so that he was always glad to get theih back again in the water, 
fearing that they would injure themselves. As the cold weather ap- 
proaches the Burramundi becomes inactive, and even too lazj’ to get out 
of the way when about to be handled. 

The ovaries and testes are nearly developed, and in April, or the 
early antipodal fall, in the Burnett River, but not before the beginning 
of September, or at the commencement of spring in the southern hemi- 
sphere, have the eggs been found laid in the water. They are deposited 
among the weeds and are placed each one by itself, “resembling those 
of the common newt” or salamander. They are fertilized in the water 
like those of some species of the newt kind. They are very difficult to 
be obtained, Mr. Caldwell spent many weeks hunting and, with the 
assistance of the blacks, turned up many hundred water-holes befoi’e 
he found any eggs. These were “covered with an enormous quantity 
of gelatinous matter which required some special means to remove,” 
and it was “eight days before he got a single egg but whole. When he 
succeeded in getting at the early stages, it remained to rear them until 
they were practically identical with the adult fish. This was a very 
difficult task, as the enemies of the Oeratodus were very numerous. 
There were two kinds of fungi which attacked the eggs. He put in 
Crustacea to devour the fungus, but these in turn attacked the young 
fish when it emerged from the egg. He was three months, till near the 
end of November (or the end of the Australian spring), developing the 
eggs.” It is also noteworthy that not until nearly six weeks after hatch- 
ing were the hind limbs developed in the young. The egg of the Oera- 
todus undergoes “ a complete segmentation similar to that of the kan- 
garoo.” (Caldwell in Journ. Boyal Soc. A. 8. Wales, v. 18, pp. 119, 120.) 

The extent of Salmon Leaps . — Observations have been made by Prof. 
A. Landmark, the chief director of the Norwegian fisheries, on the ex- 
tent of the leai)S which salmon are capable of. He thinks that “ the jump 
depends as much on the height of the fall as on the currents below it. 
If there be a deep pool right under the fall, where the water is compar- 
atively quiet, a salmon may jump 16 feet perpendicularly; but such 
jumi)S are rare, and he can only state that it has taken place at the Hel- 


794 


SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1885. 


lefos, in the Drams Eiver, at Haugsend, where two great masts have 
been placed across the river for the study of the habits of the salmon, so 
that exact measurements may be effected. The height of the water in 
the river of course varies, but it is, as a rule, when the salmon is run- 
ning up stream, 16 feet below these masts. The distance between the 
two is 3^ feet, and the iirofessor states that he has seen salmon jump 
from the river below across both masts.” As another example of high 
jumping, he refers to the Carritunk waterfall, in the Kenebec River 
(Maine), “where jumps of 12 feet have been recorded. Professor Land- 
mark further states that when a salmon jumps a fall nearly perpen- 
dicular in shape it is sometimes able to remain in the fall, even if 
the jump is a foot or two short of the actual height. This, he main- 
tains, has.been proved by an overwhelming quantity of evidence. The 
fish may then be seen to stand for a minute or two a foot or so below 
the edge of the fall in the same spot, in a trembling motion, when, with 
a smart twitch of the tail, the rest of the fall is cleared. But only fish 
which strike the fall straight with the snout are able to remain in the 
falling mass of water; if it is struck obliquely, the fish is carried back 
into the stream below. This Professor Landmark believes to be the 
explanation of salmon passing falls with a clear descent of 16 feet.” 
He thinks that this is the extreme jump the salmon is capable of, and 
indicates that of course not all are capable of performing such a feat. 
{Nature, v. 32, pp. 329, 330.) 


A peculiar Mullet. A remaricable type of lower jaw . — A new generic 
type of mullet, the family Mugilidse, has been described by Mr. W, 
Macleay, which is noteworthy on account of the anomalous mode of 
articulation of the lower jaw, and concomitant modifications of the 
neighboring parts. The new type was found very abundantly in the 
Goldie River of New Guinea, “ about 100 miles, by its course, from its 
mouth,” and was found to be “ excellent ” as a food-fish. The aspect 
of the entire fish was not unlike that of other members of its family, 
but in the inferior surface of the head differences from all others were 
well marked. As Mr. Macleay remarks, “ in most teleosteous fishes, at 
all events in this family, the gill openings are large, and what may be 
termed the gill covers extend quite to the symphysis of the lower jaw, 
leaving a more or less open space on the chin composed of the integu- 
ments surrounding the extremity of the hyoid arch, and forming the 
floor of the mouth.” In the new form a transverse fissure or groove 
appears behind the lower jaw, and when the integuments are removed 
some remarkable peculiarities are unveiled. “The chief and most ob- 
vious peculiarity” is “undoubtedly the well-marked division across the 
under surface of the head, from the extremity of the ramus of the man- 
dible on one side to that of the other, a division however which though 
deep and well defined, is only external and has no communication with 


ZOOLOGY.

the mouth. An examination of the bones of the head shows however 
that notwithstanding the very abnormal external appearance, the actual 
divergence from the typical fish skull is less than might have been an- 
ticipated, and in fact is not so much a divergence from the type as a 
variation of it,” 

“ The hyoid bones are the least normal; the urohyal is slight ; the 
basihyal short, and the glossohyal very small and slightly longer than 
broad. The most advanced of these bones, the glossohyal, reaches only 
to the transverse division at the base of the mandibles, whereas in Mugil 
waigiensis [or any other mullet] the basihyal and glossohyal bones 
are large and prominent, supporting the whole floor of the mouth and 
extending almost to the symphysis of the lower jaw.” 

The new form has been named JEschrychtys Goldiei. Good-sized 
specimens are 18 inches in length. (Proc. Linn. Soc., N. 8. Wales, v. Si 

pp. 2-6.) 

The nest of the fifteen-spined Stidklehaclc . — Like all the other species of 
the family Gasteros^eidae, the fifteen-spined or salt-water stickleback 
builds a nest attached to certain plants, which is much like those of its 
congeners, but some additional information has been communicated by 
Professor K. Mobius respecting the constitution of the threads by 
which it interweaves the particles constituting its nest, and the origin 
of those threads. An examination of male sticklebacks, in May and 
June, 1884, demonstrated to him that the threads are generally from 
0.12““ to 0T3““ in diameter, and consist of several cords stuck to- 
gether, and which again are composed of very fine parallel threads. 
The substance of which they are composed is nitrogenous, and is a 
peculiar modification of mucine as appears by its behavior towards 
various acids and alkalies. It is formed in the kidneys of the male, 
and indeed in the epithelial cells of the urinary canals, which exert this 
form of activity only at the time of reproduction, and during this period 
it behaves towards staining re-agents in the same way as the mucifer- 
ous organs of other vertebrata. {Schriften natur-Vereins f. Schleswig- 
Holstein, 6; Ann. <& Mag. Nat. Hist. (5), v, 16, p, 153.) 

A tropical Gunnel Fish . — The family of Muraenoidids or Xiphidiontids 
had been supposed to be a characteristic cold-water type. All the pre- 
viously known species were confined to the seas of the temperate and 
north polar regions until the discovery had been made of a species of 
the family representing a peculiar genus occurring at Key West, Fla. 
The species has been named Stathmonotus Hemphilii by Dr. Bean, 
the curator of fishes in the U, S. National Museum. Most of the char- 
acteristics of the new generic type are shared with the common gun- 
nels or species of Mursenoides, but it has no scales ; moreover, on one 
hand, the pectorals are much smaller, and on the other the ventrals 


796

are better developed than in Murjenoides, their position is more ante- 
rior, and a spine and two rays of moderate size exist. {Proc. U. 8. N^at. 
Mus. V. 8 , pp. 192, 192.) 

The American Flying Fishes . — The fishes of the sub-family of Exocce- 
tines, including the true flying fishes, have been examined recently by 
Messrs. Jordon and Meek, and it appears that seventeen species refer- 
able to four genera are recognizable as inhabitants of the American 
waters on both sides of the continent. Three of these, Fodiator acutus, 
Parexoccetus mesogaster, and Halocypsehis evolans, belong to special 
genera, while all of the others are members of one natural genus (Exo- 
coetus). Eight of the Exocoetines have been obtained off the At- 
lantic coast of the United States and one {Fxocoetus Calif ornicus) 
along the Pacific coast. The California flying fish is one of the largest 
of the family. {Proc. U. 8. Nat. Mus., v, 8 , pp. 67.) 

Amphibians. 

The Retrograde Metamorphosis of 8iren. — The remarkable eel-like am- 
phibian named Siren lacertina, and abundant in the southern j)arts of 
the United States, is the type of a group, by some considered as an 
order, distinguished by some remarkable characteristics ; some of these 
have been considered to be evidences of degeneration. Professor Cope 
has now reason to believe that there are also indications to be found of 
“a retrograde metamorphosis” in the “history of its branchial appara- 
tus.” He had been at a loss to account for the curious condition fre- 
quently observed in the branchiae of the sirens. The fringes are fre- 
quently partially atrophied and “inclosed in a common dermal invest- 
ment of the branchial ramus, or all the rami are covered by a common 
investment, so as to be completely functionless and immovable. This 
character, observed in the Pseudobranchus striatus, gave origin to its 
separation from the genus Siren. ” The character is however also ob- 
servable in the typical species, 8iren lacertina, at a certain age, and 
the real difference, so far as generic valuation is concerned, depends 
simply on the different number of the digits represented in the two 
species. 

Professor Cope surprised “ on discovering that the functionless con- 
dition of the branchiae is universal in young individuals of 8iren lacertina 
of 5 and 6 inches in length 5 ” and even in a specimen little more 3 inches 
long they were found “ entirely rudimentary and sub-epidermal ; ” in 
fact, according to Professor Cope, only in large adult specimens are the 
branchiae fully developed. The inference drawn from the facts is, that 
“ the branchiae are jn the Sirens not a larval character, as in other peren- 
nibrachiate Batrachia, but a character of maturity. Of course, only di- 
rect observation can show whether Sirens have branchiae on exclusion 
from the egg ; but it is not probable that they differ so much from the 


ZOOLOGY. 


797 


other members of their class as to be without them. Nevertheless, it is 
evident that the branchiae soon become functionless, so that the animal 
is almost, if not exclusiv^ely, an air breather, and that functional activity 
is not resumed till a more advanced age.” Indeed, from observations 
of a specimen in an aquarium, which for a time had no branchiae at all, 
it apx)eared that “ sirens may be exclusively air breathers.” Professor 
Cope urges that in explanation of this fact, it may be remarked that 
this atrophy cannot be accounted for on the supposition that it is sea- 
sonal and due to the drying up of the aquatic habitat of the sirens. The 
countries they inhabit are humid, receiving the heaviest rainfall of our 
Eastern States, and there is no dry season. The only exjdanation ap- 
pears [to him] to be that the present sirens are descendants of a terres- 
trial type of batrachia which passed through a metamorphosis like other 
members of their class, but that more recently they have adopted a per- 
manent aquatic life, and have resumed their branchiae by reversion.” 
{Am. Nat., v. 20, pp. 1226, 1227.) 

Peculiarities of Ccecilians. — The life history of the singular worm-like * 
Amphitrans, representing the order Gymnophiona and the family Cae- 
cibiidae, is still imperfectly known. Some characteristics have been de- 
scribed recently by the brothers P. B. and 0. F. Sarason. In an advanced 
stage, shortly before hatching, the embryo is provided with very long 
blood red external gill filaments, and has also a distinct tail, with a strong 
fin. The gill filaments are shed previous to hatching, after which the 
young Oaecilians make their way to a neighboring stream, in which they 
breathe by means of gill slits. After they leave the water their gill slits 
close up, and they breathe by lungs. There is a fourth gill arch from 
which the pulmonary artery is given off. The spermatazoon has a spiral 
filament. The last two facts tend to show that the Oaecilians were nearer 
to the Modela than to the Anura, as is indeed amply shown to be the 
case by structural characteristics generally. It seems that there is a 
difference in reproduction manifested in closely related genera, for some 
species are oviparous while others are viviparous. 

Reptiles. 

The classification of the Lizards. — A very important and much needed 
work has been in progress of publication during the past year in the 
arrangement and description of the species of living lizards. Two vol- 
umes of the projected three of the “Catalogue of Lizards in the British 
Mu.seum” have already appeared, in which all the species known are de- 
scribed atid a number illustrated. The species have been thoroughly 
revised from a systematic standpoint and grouped into natural genera 
and families. The classification is mostly based upon such characters as 
were made use of by Professor Cojje about twenty years ago, but which 
have not received due consideration from later writers. Professor 


798 


SCIENTIFIC RECCED FOR 1885. 


Cope’s work upou the group is indeed tlie^quly contribution to the taxon- 
omy of the lizards that is esteemed of special value by the author of the 
new catalogue. That author is the well-known herpetologist in charge 
of the reptiles of the British Museum, Mr. George Alfred Boulengef. 
Mr. Boulenger, however, by no means follows Professor Cope throughout, 
but has his own well considered views as to the value of the characters 
first brought prominently forward by Professor Cope. He accepts the 
order of Lacertians with the limit generally accredited to it of late years, 
and thus excludes the Sphenontidse or Hatteriidee. The order is sub- 
divided into two sub-orders : (1) the Lacertilia vera ; (2) the Ehipto- 
glossa. The several sub-orders iuto which the former have been disin- 
tegrated by Professor Cope are not recognized and even the families 
have in some cases been separated, by the intervention of groups adopted 
by Professor Cope. Twenty-one families of the order are adopted by 
Mr. Boulenger, and it is interesting to note that three of these were en- 
tirely unknown to Dum6ril and Bibron when, in 1836 to 1839, they pub. 
lished those volumes of their great work devoted to the order. 

1 The following tabular synopsis of the characters most made use of 
by Mr. Boulenger will give an idea of the range of variation and system- 
atic values of the various characters. The external form is found to 
be not only of very little use, in many cases, in the determination of the 
relations of the types, but sometimes it is very illusive indeed. 

The characters utilized for the diagnosis of the various families are 
almost exclusively derived from the skeleton and teeth, and especially 
from the consideration of the following elements : 

1. The development or non-development of a post-frontal arch {Postfr.). 

2. The development or non -development of a post-orbital arch {Post- 
orb.). 

3. The development or otherwise of a supra-temporal roof {Suprat. 
• roof). 

4. The existence or absence of a columella crani {Col. cr.). 

5. The development or non-development of an inter-orbital septum 
{I. 0. s.). 

6. The number of parietal bones, i. e., whether paired or single {Par.). 

7. The number of frontal bones, whether double or coalesced {Fr.). 

8. The number of nasal bones, i. e., whether two or one {Nasals). 

9. The number of pre maxillary bones, i. e., whether one or two pairs 
(P. max.). 

10. The number of elements in each ramus of the lower jaw or man- 
dible, i. e., whether four or five {Mand.). 

The teeth, especially whether implanted along the edge of the jaws 
(acrodent) or on the inner slope (pleurodent) {Teeth). 

12. The development of inter-clavicles, i. e., whether “dilated” and 
“loop shaped proximally,” or whether “not dilated proximally ” and 
cruciform (X). Of course in forms whose fore limbs are absent or very 
much reduced, the inter-clavicles are wanting.

Throwing these characters into diagnostic forms, economy of words 
and a better idea of the generality of characters may be obtained by 
recognizing a category called super-family. Under such headings those 
forms which exhibit exceptional characters may be segregated from the 
great mass. 

The various families recognized by Dr. Boulenger may be found 
grouped as follows : 

GecTconoidea. — Eriglossate saurians with the vertebrae bi-concave, a 
clavical dilated, and loop-shaped proximally, and post-frontal and post- 
orbital osseus arches undeveloped. 

{Geckonidce.) — The only Geckouoidea known having the parietal bones 
double. 

JEuhlepharoidea. — Eriglossate saurians with concavo-convex vertebrae, 
clavicle dilated and loop-shaped proximally, and no post-orbital or post- 
frontal squamosal arches. 

(EublepJiaridce.) — The only" known Eublepharoidea simulating in 
external appearance the Geckonidae, but distinguished by the coalescence 
of the parietals into a single bone, as well as by the concavo-convex ver- 
tebrae. 

Uroplatoidea. — Eriglossate saurians with bi-concave vertebrae, clavi- 
cles not dilated proximally, and without post-orbital or post-fronto 
squamosa] bony arches. 

{Urdplatidce.) — The only known Uroplatoidea having two parietal 
bones and a minute inter-clavicle. 

Pygopodoidea. — Eriglossate saurians with concavo-convex vertebrae,

clavicles dilated and loop-shaped proxinxally, and no post orbital or 
post-fronto squamosal arches. 

{Pygopodidce.) — The only known Pygopodoidea, especially marked by 
the exclusion of the frontal from the orbit, by the retention of the pre 
and post-frontal bones towards each other so that they are in con- 
tact. 

Agamoidea . — Eriglossate saurians with concavo-convex vertebrae, 
clavicles not dilated proximally, and without post-orbital or post-frontal 
squamosal arches. 

{Agamidce .) — Agamoidea with the supra-temporal fossa not roofed 
over by bone, tongue thickened, and aerodont dentition. 

[Iguanidce .) — Agamoidea with the supra-temporal fossa not roofed 
over by bone, tongue thickened, and a pleurodont dentition. 

(Xcnosauridce.) — Agamoidea with the supra-temporal fossa not roofed 
over by bone, the interior portion of the tongue retractile, a pleurodont 
dentition, and T-shaped inter-clavicles. 

{Zonuridce .) — Agamoidea with the supra-temporal fossa roofed over, 
the tongue simple, and cross-shaped inter-clavicles. 

[Anguidce .) — Agamoidea with the suiira-temporal fossa roofed overj 
tongue with its anterior portion retractile, with clavicles cross-shaped 
or absent, and the exo-skeleton developed as osteo-dermal plates, 
each provided with a system of irregularly arranged aborescent or rad- 
iating tubules. 

Anielloidea. — Eriglossate saurians, with concavo convex vertebrae, 
clavicles not dilated posteriorly, and without post-frontal squamosal 
or post-orbital arches. 

[Aniellidce .) — The only known anielloidea, distinguished by the ab- 
sence of ante-orbital septum, and of the columella cranii, and without 
squamosals. 

Eelodermatoidea. — Eriglossate saurians with concavo-convex verte- 
brae; clavicles undilated ijrqximally, and post orbital bony arches, but 
without post-fronto squamosal arches. 

{Eelodermatidce.) — The only known family of the super-family, distin- 
guished further by the exclusion of the frontal from the orbit on account 
of the convergence and contact of the pre and post-frontals. 

Varanoidea. — Eriglossate saurians, with concavo-convex vertebrae; 
clavicles not delated proximally ; post-orbital arches, rudimentary or 
absent, and with post-fronto squamosal arches developed. 

( Varanidce.) — The only known forms of the type, distinguished further 
by the union of the nasals into a single bone and the ensheathment of 
the tongue at its base and its deeply bifid emargination anteriorly. 

Lacertoidea.— Eriglossate saurians with the vertebrae concavo-convex; 
clavicles undilated proximally, and post-fronto squamosal at post-orbi- 
tal arches developed. 

{XantusUdce .) — Lacertoidea with the supra-temporal fossa roofed over 
and the parietals distinct. 


ZOOLOGY, 


801 


{Teiidce.) — Lacertoidea with, the supra-temporal fossa not roofed over 
and the parietals united into one, and without osteo-dermal plates. 

{Lacertidce.) — Lacertoidea with the supra-temporal fossa roofed over; 
the parietal bones united ; the premaxillaries simple, single, and without 
osteo-dermal plates. 

(Gerrhosauridce.) — Lacertoidea with the supra-eemporal fossa roofed 
over; parietal bones united ; premaxillaries single, and with osteo-der- 
mal plates, each provided with a regular system of tubules (or trans- 
verse ones anastomosing with longitudinal ones). 

{Scineidce.) — Lacertoidea with the supra-temporal fossa roofed over; 
the parietals joined, and with osteo-dermal plates, as in the Gerrhosau- 
rid®. 

Anelytropoidea. — Eriglossate saurians with the vertebr® concavo-con- 
vex; the clavicles not dilated proximally, and without post-fronto 
squamosal or post-orbital arches. 

(Anelytropidce.) — Anelytropoidea with the premaxillaries single, and 
without osteo-dermal plates. 

Douh^ul super -family. {Dihamidce.) — Anelytropoidea, with the pre- 
maxillaries double and without osteo-dermal plates. 

All the preceding twenty families are combined in the suborder “La- 
certilia vera” (which may be better called Eriglossa), and are distin- 
guished by the “ nasal bones entering the border of the nasal apertures; 
pterygoid in contact with the quadrate; clavicle present whenever the 
limbs are developed [and the] tongue flattened.” 

The only remaining group or family of the order is that of the Cha- 
mceleontidce, which represents alone the suborder “ Ehiptoglossa,” dis- 
tinguished by the “ nasal bones not bounding the nasal apertures, ptery- 
goid not reaching quadrate; clavicle absent; limbs well developed, [and] 
tongue vermiform [and] projectile.” 

The geographical distribution of Lizards. — Much difference is exhibited 
by the associations of diverse animal groups in faunal areas. If, for 
example, we compare the distribution of fishes and birds, it will be 
found that the major groups into which they are combined are very dif- 
ferent. The birds have accommodated themselves (to a large extent) to 
the present lay of the lands, while the fishes are distributed in such a 
manner as to convey the impression that the distribution has been de- 
termined by previous geological conditions and relations of the conti- 
nents, Dr, G. A. Boulenger has recently given the outlines of the 
geographical distribution of the Lacertilians, or lizards, and has called 
attention to the very great difference between their distribution and 
that of other groui)8 of reptiles, as well as that of the Batrachians or 
Amphibians. “ If,” says Dr. Boulenger, “we attempt to divide the globe 
as to its Batrachian fauna, two primary divisions present themselves, 
viz. a northern zone, comprising the Palmarctic and ISfearctic regions, 
and an equatorial southern zone; but for lizards we have to draw a

line from pole to pole, forming the Old World and Australia on the one 
hand, and America on the other, into primary divisions.” The families 
of lizards recognized by him are thrown into two great groups, — (A) 
“small families having a narrow range,” and (B) “ large and much more 
widely distributed families.” Ten belong to one of these groups and 
eight to the other, distributed as follows : 


A. UroplatidsB, Madagascar. 

Pygopodidse, Australia. 

Xenosauridae, Central America. 
Zonuridae, South Africa and Madaga.8- 

car.- 

Aniellidae, California. 

Helerdermatidae, Mexico. 

Xantusiidse, California, Central Amer- 
ica, and Cuba. 

Gerrhosauridae, Africa and Madagas- 
car. 

Anelytropidae, Africa. 

Dibamidae, New Guinea. 

B. Agamidae. Most abundantly repre- 

sented in the East Indies, less so in 
Australia, still less in Africa and 
Asia north of the Himalayas; ab- 
sent from Madagascar and New Zea- 
land. 

Iguanidae. America. Two genera in 
Madagascar, and another in the Fiji 
Islands. 

Anguidae. The bulk of this family 


occupies Central America and the 
West Indies, spreading to North and 
South America. One genus 
in Europe and the Mediterranean 
district, another (Pseudopua) repre- 
sented by one species in the Medi- 
teiTanean district and one in the 
Ehasia Hills. 

VaranidsB. Africa (excluding Mada- 
gascar), Oriential region to Asia 
Minor, Australia. 

Teiidae. America. 

Amphisbaenidae. Tropical and sub- 
tropical America (excluding Mada- 
gascar), and the Mediterranean re- 
gion. 

Lacertidae. Africa (excluding Mada- 
gascar), Europe, Asia; few in the 
East Indies. 

Chamaeleontidae. Africa (most abun- 
dant in Madagascar) ; one species, 
identical with a North African, ex- 
tending to India and Ceylon. 


As will be thus seen, the families enumerated are dispersed much in 
the same way as the birds, and in accord with the geographical division 
of the continents into the Old World and the New World, or, as they are 
termed by Mr. Boulenger, the “ palaeogean and neogean realms.” Ac- 
cording to Mr. Boulenger, “ the latter is characterized by the presence 
of the Iguanidae, Teiid®, and abundance of Anguidae ; the former by Aga- 
midae, Varanidae, Lacertidae, and Chamaeleontidae. This division is the 
more natural, as we find in both realms, within their respective fami- 
lies, a repetition of the same forms having adapted themselves to similar 
conditions. Few more striking examples of parallel series of forms can 
be found than the families Agamidae and Iguanidae, or the Lacertidae 
and Teiidae. Such parallel series occur in almost every division of the 
animal kingdom ; among the Batrachia we have the Arcifera and the 
Firmisternia ; among the Chelonia, the Cryptodira and the Pleurodira; 
and there can be no doubt that the indications furnished by the range 
of such analogous large groups are of the greatest importance in tracing 
the relationships of the faunas of the various parts of the world.” 

It also appears, on i)roceeding to further subdivision, that “the 
Ethiopian and Oriental or Indian regions, which iu their Batrachians 
are so closely related, have little in common as regards lizards ; whilst, 


ZOOLOGY. 


803 


on the contrary, the Oriental and Australian, (so widely different in 
their Batrachians,) are extremely similar. We find also that the Palae- 
arctic or Europseo-Asiatic, (the Batrachian fanna of which is so well 
characterized, and without any affinity whatever to the Ethiopian,) bears 
the closest resemblance to the latter region, differing only in the ab- 
sence of various types which flourish in the tropical and sub-tropical 
zones.” 

In fine, according to Mr. Boulenger, “ we arrive at the conclusion 
that the zoo-geographical regions generally in use, and especially their 
degree of relationship to one another, receive little support from the 
study of the distribution of the lizards ; that the distribution in zones, 
which is so satisfactorily shown by the Batrachians and the fresh- water 
fishes, is contrary to the plainest evidence as regards lizards, which at 
the present time range more according to longitude ; that the two great 
divisions originally proposed by Mr. Sclater, and derived from the study 
of passerine birds, hold good ; and that if a division of the world had to 
be framed according to the lizard faunas, the primary divisions would 
be the following: 

“I. Palceogean realm . — Two regions: 1. Occidental (=Pal 0 earctic re- 
gion, excluding the Manchurian subregion + Ethiopian region of Wal- 
lace); 2, Oriental (=Oriental + Australian regions of Wallace). 

“II. Neogean realm. — Nearctic Neotropical regions. 

The faunawhich especially interests Americans — that of the Neogean 
realm — may be briefly considered in the words of Mr. Boulenger. That 
fauna is “ very uniform as regards groups of higher rank, and the changes 
from the center towards the north and south are very gradual. And 
it is noteworthy that the Central American fauna (of which the North 
American is but an offshoot) presents a greater variety of types than the 
South American ; thus it possesses representatives of every one of the 
eleven families which occur in the realm, viz : Geckonidae, Eublepha, 
ridse, Iguanidse, Xenosauridge, Anguidse, Aniellidee, Helodermatidae, 
Xantusiidse, Teiidge, Amphisbgenidae, and Sciucidge ; whereas South 
America lacks the small groups Eublepharidae, Xenosauridge, Aniel- 
lidae, Helodermatidae, and Xantusiidae. As the greater abundance and 
variety of forms of the Anguidae occurs in the northern half and the 
West Indies, and the reverse is the case as regards the Teiidae (espe- 
cially with reference to variety of genera) and the Amphisbgenidae, we 
may safely draw the boundary line between two regions or sub-regions, 
as it may be thought fit to term them, at the Isthmus of Panama, the 
.West Indies being comprised with the northern region. Lizards range 
only as far north as British Columbia (G'errAowotws cceruleus), Minnesota 
{Eumeces septentrionalis), and Massachusetts {Eumeces fasciatus) •, whilst 
they have penetrated to the straits of Magellan {Liolcemus magallen- 
icus).’’^ — {Ann. & Mag. Nat. Hist. (5),' v. 16, pp. 77-85.) 

The contrast offered by the lizards to the fishes is marked, but not in 
the manner indicated by Dr. Boulenger. The fresh-water fishes are not 


804

distributed “ in zones,” but in quite a peculiar manner, although so com- 
plicated as to have given rise to the ' different interpretations of facts, 
of which Mr. Boulenger’s (originating with Dr. Gunther) is one expres- 
sion. The regions of Sclater and Wallace, so far as the fishes are con- 
cerned, are rather grouped as follows : . 

I. Cenogcean hemisphere. — Three regions : 1. Nearetic ; 2. Palcearctic; 
3. Oriental. 

II. JEogcean hemisphere. — Three regions : 1. Ethiopian; 2. Neotropical; 
3. Australian. 

Biped progression in a lizard. 

A singular lizard of the family of the Agamids, having a frill-like de- 
velopment of the integument on each side of the head and neck conflu- 
ent below, is found in Northern and Western Australia. It has a com- 
pressed body and a roundish tail, forming about two-thirds of the entire 
length, which amounts to between two and three feet. Its name is 
Chlamydosaurus Kingii, or the fringed lizard. 

It seems, from observation by Mr. Charles W. De Tis, that thishzard 
is capable, to a limited extent, of a biped method of locomotion. On two 
occasions individuals were observed to adopt this method of progression, 
“ trotting out briskly” on the hind limbs and with the “fore paws hang- 
ing down,” so as to give the idea of affectation to the observer. The 
“vertebral line to the very snout” was “stiffened at an angle of 60 
degrees the animal at length halted abruptly, erected its frill, and at 
the same moment turned its head inquiringly from side to side ; then 
trotted on again for 20 yards or so, and, repeating its attitude of atten- 
tion, continued in this course until it reached a tree it was making for; 
when this was reached it darted up the trunk and clung there immov- 
able for a long time, or, in the words of Mr. De Vis, “ for more hours ” 
than his “ leisure could afford for observation.” The listening attitude 
was “so real, or at least so realistic,” that it appeared to Mr. De Vis 
that “ one function of the hood might be that of conducting sound to 
the tympanum, an office apparently aided by the channels formed by 
its converging folds, and that if it were so it might be furnished with 
special muscles.” Another subject of inquiry suggested by the animal 
was the muscular furniture and other modifications of structure exhib- 
ited by the hind limbs. An investigation of the myology was therefore 
instituted. The result of this investigation was, on the whole, “ some- 
what disappointing ” to Mr. De Vis. 

The frill was found to be “ served by special, though feeble, muscles, 
as well as by a large extension of the functions of some ordinary ones.^’ 
The muscles “ specialized for the purpose of assisting in the elevation 
and depression of the hood do not of themselves indicate very clearly 
that the appendage is in a strict sense an auditory conch. But since 
they certainly forbid the idea generated by the presence of the cartilage 
and by the observed actions of the animal, that the hood may serve to

arrest sound and direct it toward the ear, we may, if we can overcome 
our disinclination to attribute an auricle to a reptile, recognize this as 
part of its office, without prejudice to its supposed use as an engine of 
terror to assailants.” 

The modifications of the hind limbs were not as great as might be 
naturally supposed, although Mr. De Vis thought that he might “fairly 
be allowed an expression of surprise on finding that the semi-erect at- 
titude and plantigrade gait of the creature are not facilitated by any 
additions or modifications in the hind quarters and limbs.” No essen- 
tial differences from ordinary lizards are apparent. “ The possibility of 
raising the body on the legs is rather permitted by circumstances gen- 
erally favorable than brought about by direct means. It is in the com- 
parative shortness and lightness of the head and anterior part of the 
trunk ; the length without undue weakness of the hind limb ; above all,” 
as it appeared to Mr. De Vis, “ the imperfect isolation of the several 
muscles, which enables them to act in certain directions with combined 
strength, that we must find an explanation of the power possessed by 
this lizard of simulating the gait of a cursorial bird.” {Proc. Linn. Soc: 
V. 8. Wales, v. 8, pp. 300-320.) 

Birds. 

Important collections in the British Museum . — Two extremely impor- 
tant and rich collections of bird-skins have been given to the British 
Museum by their owners; one especially devoted to American species, 
and the other to Indian forms. 

The American collection was the result of collections during a number 
of years by Messrs. Osbert Salvin and Frederick Du Cane Godman, of 
London, and contained “ upwards of 20,000 specimens.” Many types of 
formerly “new species” are in the collection, and numerous memoirs, as 
well as the ornithological portion of the “ Biologia Centrali- Americana,” 
have been based on its contents, and, indeed, the specimens belonging 
to the families not yet studied for the latter work are reserved by the 
authors till their examinations shall be finished. There is said to be 
“a stipulation in the terms of gift that any specimen required by the 
donors may be removed on loan from the museum during the lifetime 
of the donors or the survivor of them.” {Ibis, (5,) v. 3, p. 236.) 

The Indian collection is due to the unsparing efforts and expenditures 
of Mr. Allen O. Hume, an Indian government officer, and contained not 
less than “63,000 birds,” besides “18,500 eggs” and “500 nests.” The 
sum of £300 was appropriated by the English Government for “pack- 
ing and transmitting from Simla to England a part of Mr. Hume’s col- 
lection of Indian birds, presented by him to the trustees” of the museum. 
Mr. R. B. Sharpe, the curator of the ornithological section of the mu- 
seum, “ started for Simla the end of April to .superintend the packing of 
the collection,” and was absent several months. Mr. Sharpe has good 
reason for thinking that “it is not too much to affirm that such a private 


806

collection as Mr. Hume’s is not likely to he^formed again, for it is doubt 
ful if such a combination of genius for organization with energy for the 
completion of so great a scheme, and the scientific knowledge requisite 
for its proper development, will aga.in be combined in a single indi- 
vidual.” 

The ornithological department of the British Museum, previously 
ahead of all comijetitors, has, by these acquisitions, become incompar- 
ably richer. [Ihis (5), v. 3, pp. 236, 334, 335, 456-4(^.) 

Nesting of a Woodpecker . — Interesting observations have been made 
on the nesting of the brown woodpecker, scientifically known as Microp 
. ternus phseoceps, byJMr. Charles Bingham, deputy conservator of the 
forests of British Burmah. While passing through* the Meplay forest re- 
serve, he startled a woodpecker from a small pyingado tree {Xylia doldb- 
, riformis). Looking up into the branches, he saw “a large ants’ nest, in 
the center of which appeared a circular hole so exactly like the bor- 
ings made by woodpeckers ordinarily in the trunks of trees,” that he 
sent up a Karen boy, who was with him, “ to ascertain whether it was 
possible the Micropternus had been boring into the ants’ nest,” as he 
“had heard was the bird’s curious habit. The ants’ nest was only about 
10 feet above the ground, placed in a fork of the pyingado, two small 
branches of which passed clean through it. Climbing up, putting in his 
fingers and then a twig,” the boy “ announced that there were two 
eggs.” Leaving the nest alone for the time being, in the evening Mr. 
Bingham returned by the same route, and he was “able not only to cut 
ofl and carry into camp the whole nest as it was,” but he “managed to 
secure also the hen bird as she flew from the eggs.” Arrived at camp, 
he “got the two eggs out, and then very carefully made a cross-section 
through the ants’ nest so as to divide the boring made by the wood- 
pecker longitudinally.” The ants’ nest was “a large, spherical, solid 
mass of leaves and clay, the leaves outside being arranged one over the 
other something like the tiles on the roof of a house, but riddled in many 
places with the entrance tunnels made by the ant, a small black and red 
species of Myrmica.” “Very few of the ants remained in the nest, and 
the few that' were about seemed agitated and stung virulently. Prob- 
ably the mass of them had been driven off or eaten by the woodpeckers. 
The tunnel the latter had made was about two inches in diameter and 
four inches long, bored horizontally in, and ending in an irregular- 
shaped egg-chamber about ten and a half inches in cross-diameter, but 
narrowed by the branch of pyingado, which pierced the nest through 
and through and crossed the egg-chamber diagonally. The bottom of 
this chamber alone was smooth, but there was no lining, and the two 
translucent white eggs of the woodpecker had rested on the bare boards, 
so to speak, of the ants’ house. In the excavations made by the ants 
themselves there were neither eggs, larv®, nor pupse ; i)robably these all 
had been removed when the woodpeckers invaded the nest.” {Nature, 
vol. 32, pp. 52, 53.) 


ZOOLOGY.

The teleology of the plumage of the male Birds-of-Paradise. — The natural 
inference in the present state of biological science in explanation of the 
sportive plumage of the male birds-of- paradise would be that it was for 
the attraction of the females. Little has been known however of the 
habits of even the comparatively common species. Two English gen- 
tlemen, Messrs. Chalmers and Wyatt, while travelling in New Guinea, 
observed some species, and have recorded a meeting of males and females 
of one of the species which is of interest in this connection. Their ac- 
count is here reproduced in their own words : 

“ One morning we had camped on a spur of the Owen Stanley Eange, 
and being up early, to enjoy the cool atmosphere, I saw, on one of the 
clumps of trees close by, six birds-of-paradise, four cocks and two hens. 
The hens were sitting quietly on a branch, and the four cocks, dressed 
in their very best, their ruffs of green and yellow standing out, giving 
them a large, handsome appearance about the head and neck, their 
long, flowing plumes so arranged that every feather seemed carefully 
combed out, and the long wires stretched well out behind, were dancing 
in a circle around them. It was an interesting sight; first one, then 
another, would advance a little nearer to a hen, and she, coquette-like, 
would retire a little, pretending not to care for any advances. A shot 
was fired, contrary to my expressed wish ; there was a strange commo- 
tion, and two of the cocks flew away ; the others and the hens remained. 
Soon the two returned, and again the dance began and continued long. 
As I had strictly forbidden any more shooting, all fear was gone; and 
so, after a rest, the males came a little nearer to the dark brown and 
certainly not pretty hens. Quarreling ensued, and in the end all six 
birds flew away. Passing through a forest at the back of the Astro- 
labe, I saw several more engaged as above ; our approach startled them, 
and away they flew. Anxious to taste the flesh, I had one cooked after 
being skinned; but, although boiled for several hours, it was as tough 
as leather, and the soup not much to our taste. Fortunately we had 
other things for dinner, so put the paradise dish aside.” (Chalmers and 
Wyatt’s Work and Adventures in New Guinea; Ibis, (6), v. 3, pp. 463, 
464.) 

New Birds-of -Paradise.— The birds-of-paradise are pre-eminent among 
all birds for the excessive and eccentric develojiment in the males of 
special feathers, or feathers on special parts of the body, and the great 
variation observable, in otherwise similar forms, as to the special feath- 
ers or parts in which such development is manifested. Almost every 
genus (eighteen genera were recognized in 1877) has its own peculiar 
system of hypertrophied or eccentric feather pattern. New Guinea is 
the headquarters of the family, and of the thirty -four known up to 1877 
lew were found outside of that great island, and those few only in the 
neighboring smaller islands and Australia. During the past year six 
additional species were described from a collection made chiefly in the

trated in the “ Zeitschrift fur die gesammte Ornithologie.” The new 
species of previously known genera are Plionygama purjncreo-violacea, 
Epimochus Meyeri, Paradisea Finsehi, and Diphyllodes Hunsteini, while 
the remaining two {Astrarchia Steplianice and Paradisornis Pudclphi) 
represent hitherto unknown genera. The Astrarchia is related to As- 
tropia, but the two middle tail-feathers are very elongated and concave 
above, while the lateral ones are short. The Paradisornis is allied to 
Paradisea, but the two middle tail-feathers are very long, narrow, and 
spatuliform, and the bill is higher and more compressed; the long 
flank plumes are especially remarkable for the blue of different shades 
which distinguish them. (Z. g. 0., v. 2, pp. 369-391, pi. 15-22.) 

An insular genus of Birds . — The faunas of the archipelagos are in 
teresting on account of the limited distribution of the resident species 
and the fact that many of those species are peculiar to special islands 
or groups of neighboring islands, but represented by kindred species in 
other parts of the archipelago. Such is the case with a genus of war- 
blers (Certhiola) almost characteristic of the West Indies, although sev 
eral species are likewise found on the mainland of South and Middle 
America or in Florida. The species of the genus have been subjected 
to a revision lately by Mr. Eobert Eidgway, and nineteen species are ad- 
mitted. Of these four species {Certhiola hahamensis, C. mexicana, C. 
luteola, and C. chloropyga) are found on the mainland, two (C. mexicana 
and G. chloropyga) being confined to the continent, while of the others 
one {C. hahamensis) is found in Southern Florida as well as the Baha- 
mas, and another ( C. luteola) occurs in Tobago as well as Trinidad, Vene- 
zuela, and Colombia. The other species are exclusively confined to 
special islands or groups of islands, each of the large or well separated 
islands, as Cuba, Hayti, Porto Eico, Jamaica, Martinique, and Barba- 
does, having its special species. (Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., v. viii, pp. 25-30.) 

Mammals. 

The ancestry of Mammals . — Much difference of opinion has prevailed 
as to the ancestry of the mammals. Formerly it was generally sup- 
posed that they were derived from such forms as the Dinosaurians or 
that they were at least cognate with such reptiles. Later it was urged 
by Professor Huxley (and the view has been accepted with considerable 
favor) that the ancestry was to be sought among the amphibians. 
Against both views, however, there were various objections. Professor 
Cope has lately been disposed to consider that the nearest of kin were cer- 
tain reptiles that lived during the Permian epoch. These reptiles have 
been called the Theromorpha and are characterized in that the quadrate

bone is fixed and the ribs are two-beaded; the pre-coracoid bone is 
present and the coracoid bone is of reduced size and is free at the ex- 
tremity; the vertebral centra are deeply bi concave, and the pubis is 
entirely anterior to the ischium, and is united with it without interven- 
ing obturator foramen. The order thus distinguished has been mostly 
studied in remains found in the Permian deposits of Texas, but like 
forms have been found at the Cape of Good Hope as well as in Per- 
mian deposits in Europe. Some of the representatives were of the order 
long ago exhumed in Cape Colony and were described by Professor 
Owen under the name Therodontia. The great English naturalist 
noticed the similarity in the teeth as well as in the bone of the leg, es- 
pecially of the anterior leg of the reptiles to corresponding parts of mam- 
mals, but the full significance of the similarities was not appreciated 
until subjected to examination by Professor Cope. Professor Cope di- 
vides the theromorphous reptiles into two divisions : first, the Anomo- 
dontia, where there are several sacral vertebrae, and the vertebrae are 
not notochordal; and second, the Pelycosauria, where the vertebrae are 
notochordal, and there are only two or three sacral vertebrae. It is the 
latter suborder that is most noteworthy. Its species are so far only 
known from beds of the Permian eimch. They were moreover the only 
known reptiles of that epoch, for it is not until the following or Triassic 
period that the orders which characterize Mesozoic time made their ap- 
pearance. 

Professor Cope has given details on the “ structure of the columella 
auris in Clepsydrops leptoupbalus,” on the structure of the quadrate 
bone in the genus Clepsydrops,” and on “ the articulation of the ribs in 
Embolophorus,” and on “ the posterior foot in Pelycosauria.” The con- 
sideration of the characteristics revealed by this examination has led 
Professor Cope to the following conclusions : 

(1) “ The relations a«d number of the bones of the posterior foot are 
those of the Mammalia much more than those of the Eeptilia.” 

(2) “ The relations of the astragalus and calcaneum to each other are 
as in the Monotreme Platypus anatinus,” or rather Oruithorhynchus 
anatinus. 

(3) “The articulation 'of the fibula with both calcaneum and astraga- 
lus is as in the Monotreme order of mammals.” 

(4) “The separate articulation of the anterior part of the astragalus 
with the tibia is as in the same order.” 

(5) “ The presence of a facet for an articulation of a spur is a.s in the 
same order.” 

((i) “The posterior- exterior direction of the digits is as in the known 
species of the Monotremata.” 

Professor Cope concludes from this survey that there are good “rea- 
sons for believing that the mammalia are the descendants of the Pely- 
cosauria.” {Proc. Am. Assov. Adv. >Sc., v. 33, pp. 471-482.)

SCIENTIFIC EECORD FOR 1885. 


The temperature of the body in Monotrernes . — The mean temperature of 
the body of mammals is but little under or over 100° F. : — according to 
Dr. John Davies’ observations on thirty-one different species, 101° 10' 
F. The corresponding temperature has been measured by Baron M. 
Miclucho Maclay, in two species of Monotrernes of Australia, and it ap- 
pears that it is much lower than in most other mammals, an interesting 
fact in connection with the relation of the forms to the amphibians and 
reptiles. 

A thermometer inserted in the cloaca of the duck-mole or Ornitho- 
rhynchus paradoxus Sbud allowed to remain therefor five minutes indicated 
a temperature of 70° 3' F., the teinjjerature of the air being at the same 
time 73° 6' F., and the water of the tub in which it had been placed at 
76° 8' F. 

The Spiny ant-eater, or Tachyglossus aculeatus, showed a somewhat 
higher temperature, a thermometer, also introduced into the cloaca, 
denoting a temperature of 82° 4' F. Baron Maclay, believing that the 
large opening of the cloaca had interfered with the correctness of the ob- 
servations in the case of the first observations, made a small incision, 
just large enough to introduce the oblong bulb of the thermometer into 
the cavity of the abdomen, and the thermometer was left in over ten 
minutes. The scale indicated a temperature of 86° F. {Proc. Linn. 
Soe. N. S. Wales, v. 8, part 4.) 

A new Porpoise . — The species of the genus Phocaena, in which are in- 
cluded the typical porpoises (perhaps better known to many as the puff- 
ing jrigs or bay-porpoises), are in some confusion, it being doubtful 
whether certain variations observed are of specific or individual value. 
However, seven species have been quite generally recognized by cetol- 
ogists. These are all very closely related and agree essentially in the 
number of vertebrae. But a species has lately been found in the Alaskan 
waters, and described by Mr. F. W. True as the Phoccena Dalli, which 
differs much from its relatives in the sum of the vertebrae ; it has twenty- 
seven lumbar and forty-nine caudal in place of fourteen lumbar and thir- 
ty-two caudal, as has the Phoccena communis and (approximately at least) 
the hitherto known species. In all, the Phoccena Dalli has about ninety- 
seven or ninety-eight vertebrae, while the other species have only from 
sixty-three to sixty-six. The newly-discovered species exhibits also 
striking peculiarities in the coloration as well as in the shape of the 
dorsal fin. The only specimen that has been noticed by naturalists 
was 6 feet long. {Proc. TJ. 8. Nat. Mus., v. 8, pp. 95, pi. 2-5.) 

The Fin-whale Fishery of Norway . — At Vado, in East Finmarken, fin- 
whales are found in sufficient numbers to be subjects of a profitable fish- 
ery, and various observations have been made on the habits of the ani- 
mals. In 1885, Dr. Eobert Collet, a well-known Norwegian naturalist, 
made interesting observations upon the structure and habits of Eu-

dolphi’s whale {B. borealis), which was “captured in considerable num- 
bers during the latter part of July, although the great blue whale 
{B. sihhaldii), generally so numerous,” was not then to be seen along 
the coast. This is attributed to the absence of the Thysanopoda in- 
ermis, a small crustacean on which the blue whale feeds. “Eudolphi’s 
whale is called ‘seje^ or ‘cod’ whale by the Norwegians, as it ap- 
pears on the coast at the same time as that fish, but its food is 
also a crustacean of still smaller species than that, which is the chief 
nourishment of its gigantic relative.” It generally visits the coast of 
Fiumark between May and August, and Guldberg states that its aver- 
age length is about 40 feet, but it sometimes reaches a length of 50 feet. 
“Its color is black, and does not exhibit the bluish tint” seen in the B. 
musculus, as well as B. sibbaldii. “The sides are spotted with white, 
and the under parts are white with a faint reddish tinge. A new use 
to which the whales killed at Vado have been lately put is tinning their 
flesh, which is said to be wholesome and to find great favor in Catholic 
countries, where, being flsh according to the zoology of the church, it 
is allowed to be eaten on fast days.” [Nature, v. 32, p. 374.) 

Texan Horses of the Pliocene epoch. — It would seem, from the researches 
of Professor Cope, that no less than five species of horse-like animals of 
the genus Equus lived in what is now Texas during the Pliocene period, 
and some of them appear to have been very abundant. Of these five 
si)ecies, four also lived at same time in the valley of Mexico, while one 
is “ peculiar to the Pacific coast and basin of North America.” Of the 
characteristic species of the eastern United Stshtes [E. fraternus and 
H. major), only one (the H. fraternus) has been found in the Texas de- 
posits. [Am. Nat., v. 19, pj). 1208-1209, jd. 37.) 

The Oayal and Gaur . — By lUe old naturalists, the two largest bovine 
animals of India known as the gayal and gaur were supposed to be very 
distinct animals. Of late, however, several have contended that they 
were merely forms of the same species, one being the wild animal and 
the other the semi-domesticated form, although others have main- 
tained that the gayal existed as a distinct species in the wild state. It 
was urged in 1883, by Mr. J. Sarbo, that there is no such thing as a wild 
gayal. Now, according to Mr. Blanford, “one most important cir- 
cumstance mentioned by Blyth, on apparently excellent authority, is 
that the gaur is kept tame in the interior of the Chittagong Hills, and 
(as a tame animal) is quite distinct from Bos frontalis. If this is the case, 
hybrids are very likely to occur, for the gayal breeds freely with the 
much le.ss allied Zebu, and such hybrids may account for the occurrence 
of forms intermediate between the gayal and gaur. An indication that 
such forms exist is,” so far as Mr. Blanford can see, “the only evidence 
brought forward by Dr. Kuhn in favor of the gayal being a domesti-

cated race of the gaur,” the “supposed discovery that the tame gayal or 
wild gaur inhabit the same country, being,” in the words of IMr. Blanford, 
“ a singularly fine example of a nidus equce^ {Nature, v. 32, p. 243.) In 
this conflict of testimony and belief, more light is required before im- 
plicit reliance in either of the contrasted opinions is safe.

ANTHROPOLOGY. 


By Otis T. Mason. 


INTEODIJCTION. 

An exhaustive chronicle of Anthropology for the year 1885 would con- 
tain the account of a few general and a vast number of special works of 
great imiiortance. A cursory view of the titles appended to this brief 
summary reveals the fact that new iiortious of the human frame, and 
new groups of human phenomena, are yearly brought within the area 
of scientific investigation. Hand in hand with the widening of the do- 
main of inquiry has gone on, also, the invention of more refined appa- 
ratus of research, and the increase of ingenious methods for bringing 
knowledge into new combinations to ascertain and express means and 
averages. With respect to the last point, it is gratifying to note that 
more than one anthropologist has realized the fact that any expression 
of means which does not also preserve the exact status of each com- 
ponent is faulty. 

There is one element of true scientific investigation which, under the 
pressure of circumstances, is being better systematized by anthropolo- 
gists. It is the classification of the subjects with which they have to 
deal, according to the laws of evidence. If we may be permitted the use 
of the term, the knowledges which underlie their scientific speculations 
and deductions differ most widely, some resting on the testimony of a 
single individual who has destroyed the last vestige of evidence by 
which he could make good his word; other reasonings are based upon 
the i)reservatiou of material in such form and abundance, and with 
such authentication, as to put it within the power of any investigator 
to report experiments or examine methods. Surely conclusions based 
upon these two kinds of evidence would differ greatly in their breadth 
of base.. If a report of progress in any science should not omit to call 
attention to improvements manifested in the methods of the investiga- 
tor, much more should it mark growing tendencies to conform itself to 
rigid logic in its inferences. 

WORKS OR GENERAL IMPORTANCE. 

Tlie Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia organized courses 
of scientific lectures during the year, and elected Dr. Daniel G. Brintojj,

SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1885. 


I)rofessor of ethnology and archseology. The subjects covered were 
Palaeolithic Man; the Eaces of Men; the White Eace; Civilization, its 
Origin and Elements, its Centers, its Stages, and its Goal ; Art in 
stone, wood, bone, shell, metal, and clay; Textile art and decoration, 
and Mnemonic design. 

The American Association for the Advancement of Science met at 
Ann Arbor, Mich. The section of anthropology, under the vice-presi- 
dency of Mr. William H. Dali, confined its discussions chiefly to those 
lines easily suggested by the environment, viz., the mound-builders, and 
the Dakota stock of Indians. The vice-presidential address was a 
studied discussion of the tribes of Alaska. 

Volume yi of the Index Catalogue of the Surgeon -General’s Library 
appeared in 1885, with titles from Heastie to Inseldt. Works of value 
to anthropologists will be found catalogued under Heredity, Hermaph- 
rodites, Hippocrates, Histology, Homicide, Humerus, Hypnotism, Idiots, 
Imagination, India, Indians, Infant, Infanticide, Insane and Insanity 
(157 closely printed pages), and Insects. 

Filling’s Bibliography contains the titles in full, and in important cases, 
an abstract of everything that has been published upon the languages 
of North American aborigine.S. Six years of uninterrupted labor have 
been bestowed upon this colossal work. The index to the volume fur- 
nishes an excellent synonymy of tribal names. 

The work of the Bureau of Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion, included that done in the field by archaeologists, ethnologists, and 
linguists, and the publication of the third annual report The special 
papers will be referred to under the names of their contributors. The 
introduction, by Maj. J. W. Powell, the Director of the Bureau, is far 
more than a rSsume of the labors of others. The paper on Omaha Soci- 
ology, by Mr. Dorsey, evoked the expression of the Director’s opin- 
ions upon sociology among savages, a subject to which he has devoted 
much thought; and Mr. Dali’s paper on Labretifery and Masks draws 
out a chapter on activital similarities, in which certain rules are laid 
down with reference to the origin of like inventions in different parts 
of the world. 

The Smithsonian Annual Eeport for 1885 will contain two volumes, 
one relating to the work of the Institution, the second to the work of 
the National Museum, where the subject of Anthropology is organized 
as follows: 

1. Arts and Industries. Mr. G. Brown Goode, assisted by Mr. E. T. 
Earle, on Fisheries ; Captain Collins, on Navigation ; Mr. William H. 
Holmes and A. Howard Clarke, on Keramics ; Eomyn Hitchcock, on 
Textiles and Foods. 

2. Ethnology and Aboriginal Technology. Prof. Otis P. Mason. 

3. Archaeology. Dr. Charles Eau.

In 1885 was organized in Washington the Woman’s Anthropological 
Society, with Mrs. Tilly Stevenson as president, and Miss Sarah Scnll 
as corresponding secretary. The object of this association is twofold — 
to conduct investigations to which the avenues are especially open to 
women, and to encourage the sex in the prosecution of scientific work. 

The ficole d’Anthropologie, of Paris, carried through successfully dur- 
ing the year the following programme: 

Zoologie Anthropology ^ — M. Mathias Duval. Authropogeny and Em- 
bryology compared; study of the first phases of development. 

General Anthropology . — Dr. Paul Topinard. Analytical study of ra- 
cial characteristics ; difference between races and peojjles ; evolution of 
races in time. 

Prehistoric Anthropology . — M. de Mortillet. Les Temps photohisto- 
riques. 

Ethnology. — M. Dally. 1. Description of human races; their geo- 
graphical distribution ; races supposed to be pure, crosses of certain 
ethnic groups. 2. Sociology according to Compte & Spencer. 

Linguistic Anthropology . — M. Plovelacque. Language in its relations 
to races and peoples. 

Medical Geography . — M. Bordier. Influences of environment and in 
particular of social environment upon the production, progress, and 
spread of diseases. 

Complementary course . — Zoologic Anthropology. M. Herve. Paral- 
lelisms of anatomy between man and the higher animals. Comparative 
anatomy of the muscles and the viscera. Comparative and human tera- 
tology; monstrosities in general. 

Biologic Anthropology . — M. Blanchard. General physiological resem- 
blances between man and the animals. 

Composite Photography is taking its place among the instruments of 
anthropology, in one case the handwriting having been subjected to its 
methods in order to arrive at the type or mean expression of each letter. 
In this case the purpose was to detect fraud. Dr. Neubauer has made 
an excellent study of the race types of the Jews, followed up by Mr. 
Jacobs with a similar investigation concerning the modern Jews.* His 
composite photographs of Jewish lads will be examined with great in- 
terest. 

A serious problem in deductive anthropology is a graphic method of 
illustration, which, while it exhibits means and averages, at the same 
time does not conceal individualities. Tables of means have long given 
dissatisfaction. Binomial curves are of great use up to three or four 
series, after that, colors must be used, the printing of which is expen- 
sive. It has been the practice with the author of this summary in show- 
ing the distribution of mounds, &c., to take a county or township map, 
and to put a dot or other plain symbol for each mound, heap, work, &c.

SCIENTIFIC EECOED FOE 1885. 


The result, of course, exhibits in situ the extent and density of each 
type. M. Manouvrier has improved on this in a paper read before the 
Paris Anthropological Society. His plan is to place across the top of 
the page the whole range of indices, each index number inclosed be- 
tween two vertical lines. Down the left margin of the page may be 
written the names, races, &c., under consideration. Each measurement 
taken is indicated by a dot in the proper square. In the space with the 
name may occur the whole number of examples, while at the right ex- 
tremity of the same line may be written the mean. This system is 
varied by M. Manouvrier by introducing horizontal lines of dots for 
squares and putting actual fractional parts for dots. 

The Soci6t6 Americaine de France has undertaken the composition of 
a dictionary of American archaeology to be published in its name and 
under its auspices. A committee has been apijointed to divide the work 
among the members of the society. The secretary of the committee 
will prepare the list of words for the dictionary. The committee con- 
sists of the following-named gentlemen : MM. Auben, L^on de Eosny, 
Malte Brun, Oastaing, Eemi, Simeon, and Peuvrier. 

AECH.®OLOGY. 

Mr. William H. Holmes had occasion during the year to examine the 
collections of mound-builders pottery in the Museum of the Davenport 
Academy. In paste, manipulation, and functions, this ware differs not 
in the least from that which has been frequently described as coming 
from the Mississippi Valley. The great merit of Mr. Holmes’s work is 
the analysis and classification of form and the philosophic treatment of 
the subject of decoration. 

An archaeological experiment of the greatest value was made by Mr. 
Holmes. Noticing that very many fragments of ancient American pot- 
tery preserved marks of textiles he conceived the notion that a cast in 
fine sculptor’s clay or plaster would restore the fabric. The methods 
and results of these experiments are given in the third annual report of 
the Bureau of Ethnology. It is highly important that these experi- 
ments should be followed up on pottery from different parts of the 
world. The same author has published a paper on the evidences of suc- 
cessive populations in the valley of the city of Mexico. 

Dr. Abbott’s publication in the American Naturalist on archaeological 
frauds opens our eyes to the enormous amount of these practices. Aris- 
totle’s rule not to believe an archaeologist unless he preserves the evi- 
dences of his assertions, will have to be rigorously ai^plied, in order to 
subdue this pestilential element in a noble science. 

The Eev. S. D. Peet has written a series of articles on the symbolism 
of the ancient Americans, his work being mainly directed to collating 
the many types used in mythic representations.

The American Journal of Archaeology and History of Fine Arts was 
i'onnded at the Johns Hopkins University under the editorship of Mr. 
A. S. Frothingham. The numbers which have appeared exhibit the 
policy of the journal to be of the exalted standard adopted by the other 
serial publications of the university. 

The discussion of the question, who were the mound-builders? has 
received a fresh impetus from the ground taken by Major Powell and 
the Bureau of Ethnology that the so-called mound-builders were none 
others than th© immediate ancestors of the Indians inhabiting tiie 
United States at the time of its first exploration. Mr. Cyrus Thomas 
has devoted several papers to the discussion of the subject. 

A course of Archaeology was endowed during the year in Lisbon un- 
der the patronage of Prince Charles, and in charge of M. da Silva. 
Prizes to the amount of $250 will be divided among the students. 

The Precursor of Man.—M-. Gabriel de Mortillet is the author of the 
theory that the flints of Thenay were the workmanship not of man at 
all but of his precursor, the anthropopithecus. The argument of this 
distinguished archaeologist is somewhat as follows: The study of pa- 
leontology acquaints us with the succession of animals. We know 
that animals have varied from one epoch to another, and that these 
variations are the more profound as the epochs are removed in time. 
We know also that the higher the organism the more rapid have been 
the variations. 

The mammals of the upper Tertiary are different from those of to- 
day. Man cannot have escaped this law. If evidences of workman- 
ship exist in the Tertiary, they prove the existence not of man but of 
his precursor. 1. In Otta, Portugal, in the valley of the Tagus, at 
the base of the Pliocene, have been found worked flints. 2. Puy 
Courny, near Aurillac (Cantal), same horizon, has furnished silex both 
wrought and transported. 3. Thenay (Loir-et-Cher) reveals a being 
intelligent enough to soften flint by fire in order to make it more tract- 
able, although the beds are older than those of Otta or Puy Courny, in 
fact they belong to the lower Miocene or the upper Eocene. M. Mor- 
tillet examines carefully the question of natural cleavage of flint, and 
decides that those of Thenay afford unmistakable evidences of authro- 
popithecan workmanship. 

In reply to M. Mortillet several archaeologists have taken the view 
that the so-called crackled and retouched flints of Thenay are not the 
products of human workmanship at all. On the other hand, M. de 
Quatrefages, admitting for argument sake the existence of wrought 
flints from the Tertiary, combats de MortillePs theory of anthropopi- 
thecus, alleging that man could have lived in that period. “It may 
be true,” says de Quatrefages, “ that during the Tertiary and since 
mammalian fauna may have been renewed again and again, and that 
not one species belonging to that time survives, but the discoveries

SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1885. 


made in the Quaternary gravels of iferbaddah and Quadavery lead us 
to suppose even this assertion exaggerated. The law governing inam- 
inalian existence does not apply to man. Independent of his animal 
nature man imssesses an intelligence which enables him to contend snc- 
cessfully with nature, even when he is in the lowest condition of social 
and intellectual development. If man lived in the Tertiary he was cer- 
tainly as able to defend himself against the deleterious influences re- 
sulting from geological changes as he is to-day, against the extremes 
of heat and cold.” It also occurs to us that the pithecau ancestors of 
man had progressed further in the faculty of invention than have any 
modern apes. In other words, if Tertiary apes utilized fire and chipped 
flints, modern apes should also retain these arts. 

In the Proceedings of the United States National Museum will be 
found a detailed description of the Chaclacayo trephined skull Irom a 
cemetery near Lima, Peru, which is the most remarkable ease of ])ost- 
mortem trephining reported. Eight distinct furrows were cut in order 
to remove the section, which is nearly 2^ inches in diameter. 

BIOLOGY. 

l^rofessor Cope, in his discussion of the origin of man and the other 
vertebrates, comes to the following conclusion: “An especial i)oint of 
interest in the phylogeuy of man has been brought to light in our North 
^Vmerican beds. There are some things in the structure of man aiid 
his nearest relatives, the chimpanzee, orang, &c., that lead us to sus- 
pect that they have not descended directly from true monkeys, but that 
they have come from some extinct tribe of lemurs.” 

In reply to an editorial in Science (vi, 81) asserting that man is of 
those forms whose ancestry is unknown, Dr. Theodore Gill says, “ I 
cannot but think that the data at hand are already abundant for an 
answer, and that we can allocate his systematic relationships as well 
as those of any other animal. It is difficult for me to understand how 
any one acquainted with the data could reach a conclusion other than 
that man is the derivative of a form very much like the chimpanzee 
and gorilla, and that, could his remote ancestors be seen, they would 
be ])laced not only in the same family, but in the same group with the 
African apes.” 

The pelvic index is the ratio of the transverse to the conjugate diam- 
eter of the iielvis brim exj)ressed by integers. Dolichopellic signifies 
a pelvis, the conjugate diameter of which is longer than the transverse, 
or closely api)roaching it, above 95; iflatypellic, a pelvis in which the 
transver.se diameter greatly exceeds the conjugate, below 90; mesati- 
pellic, a ])elvis in which the transverse diameter is not greatly in excess 
of the conjugate, between 90 and 95. To the thorough discussion of 
this characteristic Dr. Heniiig devotes a monograph published in Archiv 
fiir Anthropoloyie. 


ANTHROPOLOGY. 


821 


Dr. Philippe Eey has made an investigation u])on the weight of the 
cerebral lobes, and some of his conclnsions will be of interest. Of the 
347 subjects examined, 231 were men, 116 women. While the total 
weight of the right hemisphere predominates over that of the left, the 
left frontal is heavier than the right. The right occipital is slightly 
heavier than the left. The difference of weight for the entire anterior 
region between men and women amounts to 69.65 grains, which con- 
stitutes a large proportion of the general cerebral excess of weight in 
the male sex. 

Dr. Lissauer has added the sagittal suture to the other portions of 
the human cranium which have been used in obtaining anthropological 
measures. The sagittal curve or ISTorma sagittalis is obtained by ’saw- 
ing the skull through the median line and observing the border of the 
cut within the sagittal suture. Dr. Lissauer, by means of a special 
craniograph, obtains the profile of the sagittal line on the anteropos- 
terior median plane of the skull. Certain points are fixed on the per 
iphery, and by comparing them among themselves and in relation to 
a central point located at the intersection of the vomer with the lower 
face of the sphenoid, he obtains angles by means of which he compares 
the relative value of the different segments, and also certain of these 
lines with the horizontal^ extending from the point named to the exter- 
nal occipital protuberance. A new vocabulary is introduced which will 
add much to the complexity of craniometry. The ethnic results of the 
paper may be thus set forth:

Dr. Herman Welcker, in Halle, has made a study of the capacity of 
the cranium in connection with the three diameters. He first examines 
carefully the methods employed for the curvature of the skull by 
different processes and materials. The tables appended to the investi- 
gation exhibit enormous variations in the results, as a few examples 
will show. The following table gives the people, the author, the num- 
ber of crania examined, and the average contents in cubic centimeters.

The next point which Mr. Welcker considers is the so-called modulus^ 
(found by adding the three diameters of the skull) and its relation to 
the cubature, in dolicocephalic, mesocephalic, brachycephalic crania. 

Chapter III discusses the cubature of the skull as well as its height 
and width among different peoples. Six pages are devoted to a table 
of these three measures upon dilferent races. The table of cubatures, 
on pages 106, 107, represents the dilferent races arranged in the order 
of the contents of the skull. 

Chapter lY is devoted to the cephalic index. Table IV, page 126, like 
the one just mentioned on page 106, exhibits in a graphic manner the 
various laces according to the cephalic index. This table is introduced 
in order to exhibit the author’s method of graphic illustration.

ANTHEOPOLOGY. 


831 


Some experiments liighly interesting to ]i!iysiologists are reported 
in Mr. Francis Galton’s vice-presidential address before the British 
Association. By using a very large number of family records some 
results regarding stature are made to appear. As with seeds so with 
men, “ofi'opring did not tend to resemble their parent seed in size, but 
to be always more mediocre than they — to be smaller than the parents, 
if the parents were large ; to be larger than the parents, if the parents 
were small.” An analysis of the family records gives the numerical 
value of the regression towards mediocrity as from one to two thirds 
with unexpected coherence and precision. 

The most remarkable production of the year in the field of biological 
anthropology is Dr. Paul Topinard’s iSMments d’Anthropologie G6!)e- 
rale, an octavo of 1157 pages, 229 figures, and 6 plates. The volume 
covers the history of anthropology, the discussion of the general prin- 
ciples, and a minute account of anthropological methods regarding the 
hair, color of eyes and hair and skin, height, the encephalon, the cra- 
nium, and closing with anthropometry upon the living. Only a few of 
Dr. Topinard’s results can be appended. Taking the section of the hair 
or crinal index as a primary classific concept, he gives the table below: 

1. Hair straight, section more or less round, scarce on the face and body : Yellow 
and red races of Asia and America. 

•2. Hair nappy or very spiral, section more or less elliptical : Negro races of Africa 
and Oceanica. 

3. Hair more or less curled or wavy, oval in section : Eurhpean races, Australians, 
Nubians, &c. 

The next concept is the nasal index, to which Dr. Topinard attaches 
great importance. Adding this to the color of the skin we have : 


Leptorrhines. White ^ Hyperleptoirhine. Anglo-Scandinavian (Kymri). 

(living.) races. ■; Leptorrhine (non aquiline). Celts. 

G9 and less. [Leucoid.] ( Leptorrhine (aquiline). Semites. 

Mesorrhines. Yellow C Flat { Leptorrhine (cranial). Eskimo. 

(living.) races. < noses. ) Mesorrhine (cranial). Yellow races of Asia.

Phityrrhines. Black t Well formed nose. 

(living.) races. < -vr , 

82 and above. [Melanoid].) enormous al». 

The nasal index on the living is the ratio between the length of the 
nose from the root to the outer insertion of the septum and the width 
outside of the alae. 


African negroes. 
Melanesians and Aus- 
tralians. 


The subject of color is further discussed in its relation to the eyes and 
hair and the races grouped as below : 


Eyes, color : 

1. Blade and blackish, different shades. 

2. Green. 

3. Hazel. 

4. Blue and clear of different shades, ici-

The cephalic index is the ratio of the greatest skull width divided by 
the greatest skull length. As to the boundaries of the terms applied 
to these ratio.s, most unhappily the doctors disagree. Dr. Toijinard's 
table is as follows :

It will readily be seen that the cranial index in its three branches 
applies to each of the three divi.sioiis of humanity [subspecies !], the 
significance of which seems to be that the tendency to pass from one to

COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY. 

Prof. Alexander Bain read a paper at the Aberdeen meeting of the 
British Association on the scope of antbroiiology and its relation to the 
science of mind. The whole burden of the essay was to insist upon 
amenability to measurements as the password of any set of human phe- 
nomena to the section of anthropology. This is as it should be. Mr. 
Bain further pointed out a great variety of mind actions which were 
already under the instrument of precision, and others which ought to 
be and could be. P.sychology has now a very large area of neutral 
information. It possesses materials gathered by the same methods of 
rigorous oViservation and induction that are followed in the other sci- 
ences. If these researches are persisted in they will go still further 
B. Mis. 15 53

SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1885. 


into the heart of psychology as a science,,; and the true course will be to 
welcome all the new experiments for determining mental facts with pre- 
cision, and to treat psychology as an acknowledged member of the sec- 
(ion. To this subdivision will then be brought the researches into the 
brain, and nerves that deal with mental function; the experiments on 
the senses having reference to our sensations; the whole of the present 
mathematics of man, bodily and mental; the still more advanced in- 
quiries relating to our intelligence; and the nature of emotion as illns- 
ti ated by expression.” 

Instinct. — Mr. Eomanes, in an address delivered before the Eoyal In- 
stitution in 1884, and published in their ])roceedings for 1885, thus de- 
fines instinct : “ It is the name, giveii to those faculties of mind which 
are concerned in consciously adaptive action prior to individual exper- 
ience without necessary knowledge of the relation between the means 
employed and the ends attained, but similarly performed under similar 
and frequently recurring circumstances by all individuals of the same 
species.” The origin of instinct, according to the same author, is two- 
fold : it is produced by lapsing intelligence or by natural selection. 
The former is thus explained : “ Just as in the lifetime of an individual, 
adjustive actions, which were originally intelligent, may by frequent 
repetition become automatic, so in the lifetime of the species, actions 
originally intelligent may by frequent lepetition and heredity so write 
their effects on the nervous system that the latter is prepared, even 
before individual experience, to perform adjustive actions mechanically, 
which in previous generations were performed intelligently.” For the 
following reasons many instincts are referred to natural selection solely : 
1, Considering the great importance of instincts to species they must 
be in large part subject to natural selection. 2. Many instinctive 
actions are performed by animals too low in the scale to admit of our 
supposing that the adjustments which are now intuitive can ever have 
been intelligent. 3. Among higher animals intuitive actions are per- 
formed at an age before intelligence, or the power of learning by 
individual experience, has begun to assert itself. 4. Many instincts, 
like incubation, are of a kind which could never have arisen by intelli- 
gent observations.” Finally, these two causes have cooperated in the 
formation of instincts. 

The distance between intellection and volition on the one h and and 
the organic processes associated with them seem to be narrowing year 
by year. Ur. Horsely, in a lecture before the Eoyal Institution of Great 
Britain on the motor centers of the brain and the mechanism of the 
will, omitting the discussion of the existence of the freedom of the will 
and the sources of our consciousness of voluntary power, arrives at the 
following conclusions : 

As a rule, both cerebral hemispheres are engaged at once in receiving 
and considering one idea. Under no circumstances can two ideas either 
be considered or acted upon attentively at the same moment. Therefore 


ANTHROPOLOGY. 835 

tlie brain is a single instrument. Our idea of our being single individ- 
uals is due entirely to this single action of the brain. 

The lecturer also pointed out the specific portions of the brain to 
■which ])hy Biologists have been able to relegate certain activities. 

Prof. Balfour Stewart delivered the annual address before the Society 
of Psychical Eesearch, in London, August 24, on the occasion of the 
third anniversary. The exact position of the society is best indicated 
by the language of Professor Stewart: “To my mind the evidence al- 
ready adduced is such as to render highly probable the occasional 
presence amongst us of something which we may call thought-transfer- 
ence, or, more generally, telepathy ; but it is surely our duty as a society 
to accumulate evidence until the existence of such a power cannot be 
controverted. We have not been remiss in this respect, and it will be 
found from the pages of our proceedings that the main strength of our 
society has been given to prove the existence of telepathy, in the belief 
that such a fact, well established, will not only possess an independent 
value of its own, but will serve as an admirable basis for further oper- 
ations.” 

In a paper on comijarative physiology and psychology, published in 
the American Naturalist, Br. Clevenger takes the ground that the 
science of psychology is based upon comparative microscopic anatomy 
and a physiology into which molecular physics shall enter more in the 
future. Not only are the laws which bind the social organism similar 
to and derived from those which govern the units of which it is com- 
posed, but the protoplasmic units are governed by the same processes 
down to chemical affinities. 

Mr. Charles Morris contributes to the same journal a series of articles 
upon mind and matter, in which the limits of the boundaries of con- 
sciousness and unconsciousness are discussed. 

ETHNOLOGY. 

The classification of mankind by blood is ethnology. Professor 
Flower’s presidential address before the Anthropological Institute on 
January 27 was devoted to this subject. The majority of anthropolo- 
gists at the close of 1885 leaned towards the theory of the unity of our 
species. Humanity, according to this view, is included in a single genus 
(Homo), which contains but one species (Sapiens). Here the consensus 
ends, but there still remains a tolerably fixed belief that this species 
contains three subspecies, main varieties or something of that kind. 
“ After a perfectly independent study of the subject,” says Professor 
Flower, “ extending over many years, I cannot resist the conclusion, so 
often arrived at by various anthropologists, and so often abandoned for 
some more comjdex system, that the primitive man, whatever he may 
have been, has in the course of ages divaricated into three extreme 
typos, represented by the Caucasian of Europe, the Mongolian of Asia, 


836

aud the Ethiopian of Africa, and that all existing individuals of the 
species can be arranged around these types or somewhere or other be- 
tween them.” 

The Ethiopian or Negroid race, may be divided as follows : 

A. Africans or typical Negroes. 

B. Hottentots and Bushmen. 

G. Oceanic negroes or Melanesians. 

J). Negritos. 

The Mongolian type: 

A. Eskimo. 

B. Typical Mongolian races of Asia. 

C. The Malay. 

H. Brown Polynesians. 

E. American Indians. 

The Caucasian or white division includes : 

A. Xanthochroi. 

B. Melanochroi. 

The Dravidians of India, The Veddahs of Ceylon, and probably the 
Ainos of Japan and the Maoutze of China belong to this race, which 
may have contributed something to the mixed character of some tribes 
of Indo-China and the Polynesian Islands, and given at least the 
characters of the hair to the otherwise Negroid inhabitants of Aus- 
tralia.

Ethnography of Ouatemala. — Dr. Otto Stoll, a resident physician in 
Guatemala, has undertaken to supplement the work of Brasseur and of 
Berendt on the comparative linguistics of the Central American States. 
There are eighteen languages now spoken in Guatemala, fourteen of 
them belonging to the Maya Qu’ichd, viz, Maya, Mopan, Choi, Qu’ekchi, 
Pakouchi, Uspanteca, Ixil. Dr. Stoll divides the Maya in four groups: 

A. Tzental. 

B. Pokonchi. 

G. Qu’ichd. 

D. Marne. 

A. Tzental group. 

1. Chontals of Tabasco.

Dr. John Beddoe has published the result of a study extending over 
thirty years, prosecuted for the i)urpose of ascertaining the components 
in the present population of the British Isles. The color of the hair 
and eyes is the chief reliance in the author’s observations for the analysis 
of racial distribution in the present population of Britain. 

GLOSSOLOGY. 

The lecture before the “ Conference Transformiste” this year was de- 
livered by M. Abel Hovelacque on the evolution of language. Accord- 
ing to the lecture both scientific analysis and the speech of infants 
prove that language primordially springs from monosyllabic elements. 
At first the cries and ejaculations of children are intentional, and later 
Jh^y in common with savages express , their ideas ,bj\emQtional tones. 


ANTHROPOLOGY. 


841 


From these rude begiuniugslauguagepursuesalaw of evolution which 
we may study quite apart from the people who use it, in the same man- 
ner and through the same methods as the zoologist studies coin])ara- 
tive anatomy. M. Hovelacque relegates language to the class of physi- 
ological science, and studies it in its formation, growth, maturity and 
uecay. Monosyllabism is the youth of language, agglutination charac- 
terizes its adolescence, flexion its manhood and decrepitude. 

An ingenious example of linguistic criticism is that to which Dr. 
Briuton has subjected the Taensa grammar and dictionary of M. J. 
Parisot. After scrutinizing the structure of the grammar and exam- 
ining the errors in climatic and other allusions in the text, Dr. Brinton 
comes to the conclusion that the whole thing is a forgery. After cor- 
respondence with Lucien Adam and F. Miiller it seems more probable 
that the young author had really gotten hold of an ancient manuscript, 
but that he had so doctored it that he is ashamed to reveal the original. 
Meanwhile these savants have decided upon a most praiseworthy course, 
viz, to say nothing about the Taensa grammar until the author pro- 
duces the original manuscript. 

Dr. Daniel G. Brinton appealed to American students to devote them- 
selves to our aboriginal languages, quoting in conclusion the words 
of Professor Whitney : “ The study of American languages is the most 
fruitful and the most important branch of American archaeology.” 

Philologists are frequently at a loss to see how collectors of vocabu- 
laries can have listened so differently to the pronunciation of words of 
savages. Much of the difference in their vocabularies is doubtless due 
to a want of uniformity in alphabet and to the nationality of the tran- 
scriber. More subtle than either of these causes is that pointed out by 
Mr. Hale, namely, the existence of elementary sounds of an intermediate 
character which seem to float between two, and sometimes even three 
or four, divers articulations. 

The linguistic stocks of all the tribes of North America are gradually 
being worked out by the Bureau of Ethnology. The strip of west coast 
from Alaska to Mexico, crowded with different languages, is the last to 
yield to classification. Mr. Dorsey has succeeded in unraveling the 
little bands on the Siletz Agency with the following result : 

Athapascan or Tinne family . — South River; Chetcoe dialect of the 
Tutu ; Joshua and cognate dialects of the Lower Rogue River Indians ; 
Naltunnetunns; Mekwunutunns; Yukwitee or Euchre dialect; Kwatami 
or Sixes ; Upper Coquille ; Applegate Creek ; Galice Creek ; Chasta 
Costa (Shista Khwu-sta).

COMPARATIVE TECHNOLOGY. 

In several quarters a fresh impulse has been given to the intimate 
study of modern savage technique. 

The fact that we have no other clue to the industrial history of the 
past or to the explanation of the discoveries of the archaeologist ought 
to have directed attention sooner to the necessity of describing savage 
processes down to the minutial. 

Dr. Washington Mathews, in his paper on Navajo weaving, has pro- 
duced a paper of this class worthy of imitation. Its highest commenda- 
tion is that any modern weaver could from the description reconstruct 
the apparatus and produce a Navajo blanket or belt. 

Col. F. A. Seeley, of the United States Patent Office, has published 
a second paper on the genesis of inventions from the standpoint of the 
patent examiner. A convenient term, eurematics, is used to define the 
study of inventions as to their order and their laws. 

Prof. Cyrus Thomas publishes in the third report of the Bureau of 
Ethnology an elaborate examination of the “ Tableau des Bacabs,” Codex 
Cortesianus, and plate 44, Fejervary Codex, to show the intimate rela- 
tion between the Maya and the Mexican symbols and calendars in their 
method of representation. 

Dr. Brinton’s paper on the lineal measures of the semi-civilized na- 
tions of Mexico and Central America reaches the following conclusions: 

1. In the Maya system of lineal measures, foot, hand, and body meas- 
ures were nearly equally prominent, but the foot-unit was the customary 
standard. 

2. In the Cakchiquel system hand and body measures were almost 
exclusively used, and of these those of the hand prevailed. 

3. In the Aztec system body measurements were unimportant, hand 
and arm measures held a secondary position , while the foot measure 
was adopted as the official and obligatory standard both in commerce 
and architecture. 

4. The Aztec terms for their lineal standard being apparently of Maya 
origin suggests that their standard was derived from that nation. 

5. Neither of the three nations was acquainted with a system of esti- 
mation by weight, nor with the use of the plumb-line, nor with an accu- 
rate measure of long distances. 

SOCIOLOGY. 

As a means of realizing a vast amount of material for sociological 
purposes, the only safe method in such investigations, Dr. Francis Gal- 
ton has made use of family records, printed questions put in the hands 
of great numbers of people to be filled up. The results of this inquiry 
are partially summed up in the vice-presidential address before the

sous stated in the address. It appears that the offspring does not tend 
to resemble the parents, but to be always more mediocre than they; to 
be smaller if the parents were large, to be larger than the parents if 
the latter were small. 

“There can be no doubt,” says Mr. Galton, “that heredity proceeds 
to a considerable extent, perhaps principally, in a piecemeal or piebald 
fashion, causing the person of the child to be to that extent a mosaic 
of independent ancestral heritages, one part coming with more or less 
variation from this progenitor and another from that. To express this 
aspect of inheritance where particle proceeds from particle, we may 
conveniently describe it as particulate.” 

“Whenever a feature in a child was not personally xjossessed by either 
parent, but transmitted through one of them from a more distant pro- 
genitor, the element whence that feature was developed must have ex- 
isted in a particulate, though a personal and latent form in the body of 
the parent. The total heritage of that parent will have included a 
greater variety of material than was utilized in the formation of his 
own personal structure.” The lecture closes with the application of the 
argument to the formation of colonies or composite individuals. 

Mr. Dali, from his long Alaskan experience, made familiar with 
masks and labrets, has extended his study into other regions, and pro- 
duced a work on the geographical distribution of these objects which 
is of great ethnical value. His speculations lead him to the conclusion 
that intimate relationship once existed between Oceanica and the west- 
ern continent. 

The Eev. J. Owen Dorsey was for many years among the Dakotan 
tribes, and became so conversant with their language and habits that 
he has been invited by the director of the Bureau of Ethnology to pre- 
pare an elaborate account of that stock. His monograph upon Omaha 
Sociology is the first of a series, which will terminate with grammars and 
vocabularies. Mr. Dorsey is by far the best equipped man in the world 
to treat this subject. The Omaha belong to the Dhegiha groui> of the 
Siouan family, the other member of the family being the Kwapa. In 
connection with this paper should be read Major Powell’s rei)ort upon 
it in the introduction to his third annual report. 

iMr. Ward read before the Anthropological Society of Washington a 
paper of great sociological imj)ortance, in which are contrasted moral 
and material progress. By the former, the author means the actual 
removal of social evils; by the latter, the discovery of principles and 
the invention of ai)pliances calculated to remove them. The aim of the 
paper was to call attention to the fact that while material i^rogress goes 
on by steady accretions, in which every step is permanent gain, moral 
progress takes place by a rhythmic action of which only the algebraic 
sum of its many fluxes and refluxes can be counted. Every age has 
possessed all the arts of the age tliat preceded it, and has added some- 
thing to them, but the welfare of man does not advance by any such

method. Mr. Ward sees the reason for this iu the fact that kno\vled;;e, 
ingenuity, shill, and industry, well-nigh omnipotent in the accomplisli 
ment of anything toward which they can be once fairly directed, have 
not been applied to moral end and directed to the attainment of social 
well-being. 

MYTHOLOGY AND FOLK-LORE. 

A very important addition to the philosophy of animism is that of 
Mr. J. G. Frazer in his connection of burial customs with the luimitive 
theory of the soul. The whole range of literature has been consulted, 
and the scrupulous habit of Mr. Frazer iu the enumeration of authori- 
ties will be of the greatest advantage to those who wish to follow up 
the subject. The feature most thoroughly examined is the identity of 
ghosts and the belief in a second or spirit self. 

Major Powell, iu reviewing Mr. Dali’s paper on masks, draws atten- 
tion to the fact that in i^araphernalia, as iu folk-lore, the practical 
passes imperceptibly into the mythical. “Savage mythology deals 
largely with animal life, and savage drama is intimately associated 
with savage mythology.” Among many North American tribes the old 
men and women who transmit mythic lore are listened to with great 
interest, and as the stories of the ancient god-beasts are told, resort is 
had to dramatic personification to give zest and vigor to the mythic 
tales.

OBSEEVATIONS ON STONE-OHIPPING.* 

By George Eecol Seliees, of Bowlesville, HI. 

WEen a boy, living among mechanics, artists, and artisans, preparing 
for the profession of civil and mechanical engineer, it vras natural that 
I should be attracted to the studio with its adjoining workshop and 
taxidermic room of my mother’s father, Charles Wilson Peale, and his 
sons. There was always something new to be learned there. He was 
a native of the province of Maryland, the son of one of the earliest 
Ei)iscopal ministers who came from England and settled in that colony. 
He always took great interest in the history and incidents connected 
with the early settlement of Maryland and Virginia. He had a shelf 
in his library devoted to books and pamphlets relating thereto, many 
of which seemed to have been sent from Europe to him, for they bore 
inscriptions of “presented by,” or “received from,” my friend. Sir J. 
Banks or from Count Eumford, and others. Among them was a volume 
of autograph letters from his friend Thomas Jefferson on the same sub- 
ject. This shelf was particularly attractive to me, for it always led to 
reminiscences of the most interesting character from my grandfather. 
On one occasion I came across on this library shelf a thin bound volume 
of letters of John Smith from the Virginia colony. It was a London pub- 
lication, and (if my recollection is not at fault) comprised several pamph- 
lets bound together. A jiassage in one of these letters, in describing an 
Indian he had met with, referred to the making of stone implements. I 
have not seen the publication since, and cannot after a lapse of more 
than sixty years quote from it, but will give the substance as impressed 
on my mind. He said in substance that the Indian carried with him a 
pouch filled with flakes of precious stones, and within his mantle, in a 
pocket made for the purpose, a small instrument made of bone or horn^ 
that he valued above all price and would not part with, and with it he 
deftly shaped arrow-points and spear heads from or out of the stone 

* In the summer of 1885 Mr. Sellers visited Washington and called upon Dr. Kau, 
to whom he gave an account of his experiences in stone- chipping, but dwelling chiefly 
on what he had heard from Mr. Gatlin concerning this subject. Dr. Eau, perceiving 
the importance of Mr. SeUers’s remarks, induced him to prepare the present article. 
It will be seen that the Indians of this country resorted in stone-chipping to methods 
similar to those employed by the Mexicans, as related by Torquemada and Moto- 
linia.

flakes. On calling my grandfather’s attention to this, he said that 
although there was much truth in what at the time was written from 
the colonies, some things were highly colored and had to be sifted 
out or taken with caution, and he supposed the cuLting of hard stone 
with bone or horn was one of these, and might be set down as one of 
Smith’s yarns. I asked myself the question. What object could he 
have in inventing and telling if? There must be some foundation. At 
all events, it made an indelible impression on my mind. 

Most of the arrow-points found within my reach in Philadelphia, Dela- 
ware, and Chester Counties, Pennsylvania, were chipped from massive 
quartz, from the opaque white to semi-transparent and occasionally 
transparent. Once, in company with my early preceptors, Jacob Pearce 
and Isaiah Lukens, both well-known scientists, on a mineralogical ex- 
cursion, we came to a place where (judging from the quantities of flakes 
and chips) arrow-points had been made. After mOot diligent search 
only one perfect point was found, which is still in my possession, marked 
with ink “1818.” There were many broken ones, showing the difficulty 
in working the material. Mr. Lukens collected a quantity of the best 
flakes to experiment with, and by the strokes of a light hammer roughed 
out one or two very rude imitations. No effort was made by pressure, 
which I cannot now understand, for at that time I was in the habit of 
breaking off points and trimming mineral specimens (likely to be injured 
by the jarring of a hammer stroke) by pressure with the hickory handle 
of my mineral hammer. 

Maj. S. H. Long, afterwards colonel, who in the latter part of his 
life succeeded Col. John J. Abert as head of the Topographical Depart- 
ment of the United States Army, whenever in Philadelphia, was a fre- 
quent visitor at my father’s house; and, when preparing for his expedi- 
tion to the Eocky Mountains, in which my mother’s youngest brother, 
Titian K. Peale, went as assistant naturalist, I saw him almost daily. 
The subject of flaking and forming arrow and spear heads was one 
of frequent discussion. My grandfather, 0. W. Peale, was at that time 
owner of the Philadelphia Museum, which had for that period a large 
collection of Indian curiosities, among them, many collected by Lewis 
and Clark on their northwestern expedition, — and to me the most inter- 
esting, was a box of stone implements in various stages of manufacture, 
evidently collected with the view of illustrating the process. They were 
never put on exhibition other than in the original package, the lid of the 
box only having been removed. Major Long’s attention was called to 
these, and he expressed his belief that on his expedition he would learn 
the entire process, and on his return be able to explain everything in 
the Lewis and Clark collection. 

The expedition returned, and, as far as I know, without any positive 
information as to the process of making the flakes. Mr. Peale said he 
had seen squaws chipping flakes into small arrow-points, holding the 
flake in their left hand, grasped between a piece of bent leather, and

chipping off small flakes by pressure, using a small pointed boue in the 
right hand for that purpose. From this it was evident that John 
Smith’s story was no myth. In my life-long intimacy with Colonel Long 
the subject of the flaking operation has frequently been one of conversa- 
tion, on my regretting that more attention had not been paid to it on 
either of his expeditions. Knowing his pre-eminence as a civil engineer 
and his high attainments as a mechanic, I thought more reliable infor- 
mation would have been obtained by him and his party, composed as it 
was of such prominent men of science. He said that flakes prepared 
for points and other implements seemed to be an object of trade or 
commerce among the Indian tribes that he came in contact with; that 
there were but few places where chert or quartzite was found of suffi- 
cient hardness and close and even grain to flake well, and at those 
places there were men very expert at flaking. He had understood that 
it was mostly done by pressure, and rarely by blows, but he had never 
witnessed the operation. He expressed his belief that it was an art 
fast being lost, for he had found among tribes who had never seen a 
white man since the advent of Lewis and Clark, wrought-iron arrow- 
points made in England by the Birmingham nailers, sent out as articles 
of trade by the fur companies, and that they were preferred to the 
stone points. 

My early acquaintance with Catlin, the artist, was in the shop of Catl in, 
musical instrument and model maker, of Philadelphia. There I knew 
him as a very expert and superior workman in wood and ivory. As a 
portrait painter he was not at that time successful. He painted strong 
likenesses, but they lacked life-like coloring. A delegation of Indians on 
their way to Washington gave him an opportunity to paint the likeness 
of one of the chiefs. This was exhibited in the Pennsylvania Academy 
of Fine Arts, and from its novelty attracted much attention ; in fact, it 
was so far a success as to bring- him into notice. About this time I met 
him very frequently; his conversation always drifted on to the great 
value and importance of preserving correct likenesses of the Indians, 
whom he believed to be fast passing away. We all know how well he 
lived up to this idea, devoting his life to the work of producing the col- 
lection of Indian portraits now in the National Museum. 

On Mr. Catlin’s return from his long sojourn among the Indians, be- 
lieving that, as an observing practical mechanic, nothing in the way of 
art among them would escape him, I took the first opportunity to see 
him. On my inquiry as to the mode in practice of splitting the stone 
into flakes for arrow and spear points, his reply was by a question 
characteristic of the man. He asked if I had forgotten Dr. Jones’s 
axiom, “The least possible momentum is greater than the greatest pos- 
sible pressure.^’’ This was in allusion to a lecture on mechanics we had 
together heard delivered by Dr. Thomas P. Jones (afterwards Commis- 
sioner of Patents). He then added, “That is well understood by the 
flake makers among the Indians, but it will soon be among the lost

arts, just as the nests of Birmingham brass battered- ware kettles, the 
Yankee tin-ware, and glass whisky bottles have already almost totally 
destroyed their crude art of pottery making. The rifle is taking the 
place of the bow and arrow. For boys’ practice and for small game the 
iron points got from the fur traders are preferred to stone. A common 
Jack-knife is worth to them more than all the flint knives and saws ever 
made.” 

After expressing himself in this manner he went on to explain what 
he had seen. He considered making flakes much more of an art than 
the shaping them into arrow or spear points, for a thorough knowledge 
of the nature of the stone to be flaked was essential, as a slight differ- 
ence in its quality necessitated a totally difterent mode of treatment. 
The principal source of supply for what he termed home-made flakes 
was the coarse gravel bars of the rivers, where large pebbles are found; 
those most easily worked into flakes for small arrow-points were chalce- 
dony, jasper, and agate. Most of the tribes had men who were expert at 
flaking, and who could decide at sight the best mode of working. Some 
of these pebbles would split into tolerably good flakes by quick and 
sharp blows striking on the same point ; others would break by a cross 
fracture into two or more pieces ; these were preferred, as good flakes 
could be split from their clean fractured surface by what Mr. Gatlin 
called impulsive pressure, the tool used being a shaft or stick of between 
2 and 3 inches diameter, varying in length from 30 inches to 4 feet, ac- 
cording to the manner of using them. These shafts were 
pointed with bone or buck-horn, inserted in the working 
end as represented in Fig. 1, bound with sinews, or raw- 
hide thongs, to i^revent splitting. For some kinds of work 
the bone or horn tips were scraped to a rather blunt point, 
others with a slightly rounded end of about one-half inch 
in diameter. He described various ways of holding the 
stone while the pressure was being applied. A water- 
worn pebble broken transversely was commonly held by 
being sufficiently imbedded in hard earth to prevent its 
slipping when held by the foot as the pressure was applied. 
Large blocks of obsidian or any easily flaked stones were 
held between the feet of the operator while sitting on the 
ground, the impulsive pressure being given ta the tool 
grasped in both hands, a cross-piece on the upper end 
resting against his chest, the bone end against the stone 
in a slight indentation, previously prepared, to give the 
proper angle and to prevent slipping. 

In some cases the stone operated on was secured be- 
tween two pieces or strips of wood like the jaws of a vise, 
bound together by cords or thongs of rawhide ; on these strips the oper- 
ator would stand as he applied the pressure of his weight by impulse. 
The best flakes, outside of the home-made, were a subject of commerce.

OBSEKVATIONS ON STONE-CHIPPING.

and came from certain localities where the chert of the best quality was 
quarried in sheets or blocks, as it occurs in almost continuous seams in 
the intercalated limestones of the Coal Measures. These seams are mostly 
cracked or broken into blocks, that show the nature of the cross fracture, 
which is taken advantage of by the operators, who seemed to have re 
duced the art of flaking to almost an absolute science, with division of 
labor; one set of men being expert in quarrying and selecting the stone, 
others in preparing the blocks for the flaker. This was done when the 
blocks were nearly right-angled at the corners, by striking olf the corner 
where the flaking was to commence, and, with a properly directed blow 
with a hard pebble stone, knock otf of the upper edge a small flake, mak- 
ing a seat for the point of the flaking tool. Sometimes these blows were 
carried entirely across the front upper edge of the block, making a groove 
entirely across the edge, when the first row of flakes have been thrown 
off. It is the work of this operator to prepare seats for a second row, 
and so on. What was meant by almost absolute science was a knowledge 
and skill that would give the proper direction to the 
pressure to throw off the kind of flake required. Fig. 

2 represents, as nearly as I recollect, the rude sketches 
made of the flaking tool used to throw off massi ve flakes, 
when a sudden percussive pressure was required in ad- 
dition to the impulsive pressure the man could give. 

The staffs of these flaking tools were selected from young 
hard-wood saplings of vigorous growth. Alower branch 
was utilized, as shown at a in Fig. 2, to form the crotch 
in which the blow was struck. Another branch on the 
opposite side, a, was used to secure a heavy stone to 
give weightand increasethe pressure. Whenthestone 
to be flaked was firmly held, the point adjusted to give 
the pressure in the required direction, the staff firmly 
gra.sped, the upper end against the chest of the oper- 
ator, he would throw his weight on it in successive 
thrusts, and if the flake did not fly off, a man standing 
opposite would simultaneously with the thrust give a 
sharp blow with a heavy club represented in cross- 
section h in Fig. 2, it being so shaped that its force is 
downward close in the crotch. It has been represented 
to me that a single blow rarely failed to throw off the 
flake, frequently the entire depth of the block of stone, 
sometimes as much as 10 or 12 inches. The tooth or 
tusk of the walrus was highly prized for tips of the flakers. 

What I have thus far written is at second hand, being merely recollec- 
tions of conversations at various times with the parties I have referred 
to, and more recently with a man who for over thirty years had been 
connected with a fur company, and who had lived most of that time 
among the Indians, and much of it, as a trapper. 



87£) PAPERS RELATING TO ANTHROPOLOGY. 

What I now propose is to give some of my experimental jjractice in 
flaking and working flint (chert), and (from a purely mechanical stand- 
point) some conclusions drawn from a pretty extensive examination of 
the waste and refuse as well as finished and partly finished work left in 
the aboriginal flint workshops. 

There are many places along the banks of the Ohio River and its 
tributaries that are not subject to the annual overflow, but are still 
below the occasional great floods, where the flaking process has been 
extensively carried on, and where cores aud waste chips are abundant. 
At one of these places, on the Kentucky side of the river, I found a num- 
ber of chert blocks, as when first brought from the quarry, from which 
no regular flakes had been split; some had a single corner broken olf as 
a starting point. On the sharp, right-angled edge of several, I found the 
indentations left by small flakes, having been knocked off evidently by 
blows, as described by Gatlin, as a preparation for seating the flaking 
tool. Most of the localities referred to are now under cultivation, but 
before being cleared of timber and subjected to the plow, no surface relics 
were found; but on the caving and wearing away of the river bank.s, 
as the light earth washed away, many spear and arrow-heads and other 
stone relics were left on shore. After the land had been cleared and 
the plow had loosened the soil, one of the great floods that occur at 
intervals of some fifteen or twenty years, would wash away the loose 
soil, leaving the great flint workshops exposed. It is from the stores 
of material left, the cores or nuclei thrown aside, caches of finished and 
unfinished implements and flakes, the tools and wastage, vast accu- 
mulations of splints, &c., that we can, on critical examination, draw 
tolerably correct ideas of the mode of working pursued. 

One of these great flaking banks or workshops is exposed on the 
northern bank of the Saline River at its first rock “ripple,” about 3 miles 
above its junction with the Ohio, the general course of the Saline being 
from the northwest to the southeast. Above the “ripple” the stream is 
only navigable during high water of the Ohio. On its southern side 
are ranges of hills from its mouth to its source, ranging between 300 
teet and 400 feet in height, and on the divide between the west fork of 
the Saline aud Eagle Creek they rise to a height of over 800 feet. The 
ridge is broken through by the valleys of small tributaries ; the spurs 
from the ridge at places terminating in rock bluffs close to the river, at 
others leaving a narrow bottom. On the northern side of the stream 
the hills proper commence about 4 miles above the mouth, leaving a 
wider valley or bottom on that side; the low bottom lands of the Ohio 
extend nearly to the ripple, where commences what is termed the second 
bottom lands of the Ohio, which rise rather abruptly, extending with 
the river by its windings at varying distance from it. It is on this 
ridge where it is intersected by the Saline that the coal company made 
the terminus of their railroad and shipping port of coal. 

On my first visit, in the fall of 1853, this was in dense forests with

the exception of a narrow strip along the bank of the Saline, which had 
been cleared for railroad coal dump, saw-mill, shops, and dwellings. 
The most of the cleared portion was a range of low sepulchral mounds 
crowded together. In cutting into them for foundations, small sized stone 
cists were exposed, none over 4 feet in length, with a single exception ; 
this was (in excavating foundations for saw mill boiler in the side of 
the largest of the mounds,) a skeleton at full length, surrounded by and 
covered with thin sandstone slabs, much as the small cists were formed. 
With this skeleton were found two small clay pots, some shell beads, 
a flint gun-lock, barrel, and metal trimmings of an old English musket, 
the stock so decayed that it fell to pieces when being taken out — no 
doubt a recent surface burial ; in fact, human bones were found near 
the surface of all these mounds. The small cists over which they were 
originally raised contained nothing but fragments of bones, teeth, and 
occasionally a stone celt and a few flaked implements. The first in- 
dication of relics on what has proved to be a great stone implement 
manufactory was in sinking a cistern on the ridge about 200 yards from 
the river. This went through a mass of flint chips. By the year 1859 
the little clearing around the house where the cistern was sunk had 
joined with the cleared strip on the river banks, making in all a clearing 
of some 25 acres. Heavy rains after the first plowing exposed some few 
specimens of spear and arrow points; the next plowing, a still greater 
number. But it was not until the great flood of the winter of 1862 and 
1863 that overflowed this ridge some 3 or 4 feet, with a rapid current, 
that the portion under cultivation north of the mounds on the river bank 
was denuded, exposing over 6 acres of what at first appeared to be a mass 
of chips or stone rubbish ; but amongst it were found many hammer 
stones, celts, grooved axes, cores, flakes, almost innumerable scrapers, 
and other implements, pieces of broken, much-decayed bone, but no per- 
fect bone implements, many tines of the buck or stag, all of which bore 
evidence of having been scraped to a point. On exposure to the air they 
fell to pieces. Among this waste it was rare to find fragments of rude 
pottery, though they abound among the mounds near the river bank, 
and further north on the same ridge, where burnt sandstone*s, black earth 
full of fragments of shells and bone, show the site of a settlement — the 
field being nothing but a workshop. The great August flood of 1875, 
and the winter floods of 1881, 1882, and 1883 continued the work of de- 
nudation until the ground became unfit for cultivation, and was aban 
doned. The greatest number of cores, scattered flakes, finished and 
unfinished implements, are of the chert, from a depression in a ridge 3 
miles to the south-east, where there is evidence of large quantities hav- 
ing been quarried. I have found a few cores of the white chert from Mis- 
souri. and the red and yellow jasper of Kentucky and Tennessee; but 
the flakes of these have mostly been found in nests or small caches, 
many of which have been exposed, and in every case the flakes they 
contained were more or less worked on their edges, whereas the flakfjs 


878

from the neighborhood chert preserved tlfeir sharp edges as when split 
from the mass. These cache specimens with their worked serrated 
edges would, if found singly, be classed as saws or cutting implements. 
But here, where found in mass, evidently brought from a distance, to 
a place where harder chert of a much better character for cutting im- 
plements abound, they tell a different story. No two are exactly alike, 
yet the work on all is of the same character, and evidently done for the 
same object. To one discovering that object, they tell the story clearly, 
as well as the mode of working, written on stone, and better than it can 
now be told either by writing or illustrations. 

To make myself understood I must have recourse to sketches, and 
then will most probably fail to make it as clear to the general reader 
as these stone flakes do to me. Let us first look at a flake as detached 
from the mass, and study its nature, presumiug it to have been flaked 
from a stone that by a hammer stroke would break with a fine-grain 
I conchoidal fracture. Fig. 3 is a plan view of the outer or high side 


(Half size.)

of an ordinary flake intended for a spear or arrow-head 5 the shape 
of this high side depending on the lines of fracture of the previous flak- 
ing. Fig. 4 is a section through the center of the flake on the dotted 
line a a', showing its flat side and sharp edges. Fig. 5 an edge view, 
showing at its upiier end the angle of the recess formed, and against 
which the point of the flaker had been pressed to throw off' the flake ; 
dotted lines in the cross-section Fig. 4 show the form of an arrow-head 
on the line a a' that the flake will work into. The form of the head is 
given by dotted lines in Fig. 3. From these it will be seen that the por- 
tion of the flake to be chipped away (and also the greatest portion of 
the chipping to be done) is from the flat side. 

The man who makes the flake can at a glance see what it will best 
produce. His flakes are for transportation ; bulk and weight are seri- 
ous considerations. His iiractical eye tells him how to reduce them into 
the best merchantable form 5 and the greater number of the flakes found 
in the caches alluded to have been so worked, and always from the flat 
side of the flake. This could not be accidental. By referring to the axis 
line in section Fig. 4, the amount of chipping from the flat side that 


OBSERVATIONS ON STONE-CHIPPING. STD 

has to be done will be seen. To attempt to do this and to throw off long 
chips from the sharp edge of the flake would prove a failure, as its 
sharp edge would either crumble away or it would cut and injure the 
point of the bone flaker without throwing off the desired chip or flake. 
Experience has taught the operator the best shape of edge to apply the 
pressure to accomplish his object, and it has also taught him how to 
reach it in the simpfest possible way. A spoon-shaped hollow on the 
top of a flattened log, or even a gutter or groove eut in it, furnishes the 
means of holding the flake firmly, the raised or high side placed in the 
hollow, the flat side up; with the ends of the fingers of his left hand 
pressed on it he holds it firmly, while with his right hand a downward 
pressure is given by the flaking tool which breaks off chips with a fract- 
ure of about 45 degrees from the flat surface, leaving the edge in the 
best possible shape for future work, and that is the condition of these 
cache flakes as they are found. 

In old times, before the invention and introduction of planing and 
shaping machines to work metals, the first and most important lesson 
taught to the machinist’s apprentice was the use of the hand-hammer 
and cold-chisel. When an outer shell was to be removed from a metal 
casting and its surface left in condition to be finished by file or scraper, 
the smoothness and regularity of that surface was essential, not only 
for economy in working, but accuracy of the file finish. The apprentice 
was taught to hold his cold-chisel and so direct the strokes of his ham- 
mer that when a chip was started the chisel should hold to it, and not 
be allowed to cut too deep or slip and fly out, leaving a shape that is 
difficult to start a fresh cut without leaving ridges or cutting deeper, 
in either case causing additional labor for the finisher. 

To a practical mechanic the examination of such a flint workshop as 
I have described — its waste chips to the partly worked flakes, the roughed 
out blocks, and the finished implements — reveal a line of workmanship 
so clear that it can be tollowed to the production of the same results. 

The handling of the tool and flake to form an arrow-point is as muc'n 
an act requiring exactness and precision as the handling the cold-chisel 
and hammer is to the machinist. The first chip thrown oft’ is analogous 
to the first starting work of the cold-chisel ; it is the text that must be 
adhered to to the end of the chapter. Holding the flake in such position 
that commencing at what is intended for the point of the intended work, 
the pressure with the flaking point is brought to bear close to the edge 
of the 45 degrees angle and at right angles to it ; the result is a flake 
thrown off inclining towards the stem end of the arrow-point. In sec- 
tional sketch Fig. 4 from a to a' shows the 45 degrees angle left by the 
first rough shaping from c to c' the direction of the first chip thrown oft’. 
'I'he seat left by this chip when thrown off’ is concave on the edge of the 
flake, the advance corner of which is the seating point for the tool to 
throw off’ the next chip, which does not entirely obliterate the concave 
of the first, and the following chip leaves a serrated edge, the chips or

flakes being generally parallel, which is- ihe object of a good workman 
to make them. When the flat side by chipping has been reduced to 
nearly therequired form, its edges are in the best possible shape for chip- 
ping the opposite or high side, then by alternate working from side to 
side the point is finished, either leaving it with serrated edges or by after 
delicate work throwing off the points, leaving a smooth, sharp edge. 
The indentations at the base either for barbs or for thongs to secure 
the point to its shaft are made by direct down pressure of a sharp point 
working alternately from side to side, the arrow-point being held firmly 
on its flat face. From the narrowness of the cuts in some of the speci- 
mens, and the thickness of the stone where they terminate, I have in- 
clined to the belief that at the period they were made, the aborigines had 
something stronger than bone to operate with, as I have never been able 
to imitate some of their deep, heavy cuts with it; but I have succeeded 
by using a copper point, which possesses all the properties of the bone, 
in holding to its work without slipping and has the strength for direct 
thrust required. A soft iron or thoroughly annealed steel point answers 
even a better purpose. As yet no copper has been found on this flaking 
ground, though a few copper beads and remnants of what appear to 
have been ornaments have been taken from mounds on the ridges of the 
Saline, which I think is evidence that they had that metal at the earliest 
time work was done on this flaking bank. 

Bryce Wright in his description of the Scandinavian knives or dag- 
gers refers to them as being most beautifully dentilled with parallel 
flaking and serrated edges. He says : “ These knives or lances are true 
marvels of pre-historic art, and show an amount of skill and workman- 
ship which cannot be imitated in the present age, the art of fashioning 
them having been entirely lost.” Sir John Lubbock, on page 104 of 
“Prehistoric Times,” says: “The crimping along the edge of the handle 
is very curious.” As to parallel flakings with serrated edge, I have 
endeavored to show (from a mechanical stand point) that the refuse 
of the great flint quarries points to a mode of working that must leave 
the dentilled markings parallel, and the edges worked from, serrated. 
What Lubbock speaks of as curious crimping on the edge of the han- 
dles IS but the natural result of the mode of working I have exam- 
ined these Scandinavian dagger handles, and find the same appearance 
on the blades of large-size broken piercers, numbers of which I have 
found among the rubbish, picked up, examined, and thrown away as im- 
perfect specimens. Some of them have a spread, flat end or handle of 
over inch, with nearly square blades, evidently having been worked 
by down pressure from the edges corresponding to the spread end, these 
45 degrees flakes meeting form angles and produce the square. The 
interlocking of the flakes at their meeting causes the crimped appear- 
ance, in some cases not unlike a row of beads, very beautiful, but not 
made with any such view, but simply the natural result of the mode of 
working.

Here also are found massive flakes or chips of fine-grained quartzite, 
that teach another lesson to a seeking practical mechanic, nosing about 
among the accumulated refuse. These flakes are often rough on one 
face, showing them to be an outside scale from the stone; occasionally, 
fragments of large flat implements that have been classed as agricult- 
ural (hoes or spades). These fragments have not been broken by want 
of skill in the workmen, but from undiscovered seams in the stone that 
did not show until the outer surface was thrown off. None of these frag- 
ments show any sign of use ; in fact, some of them ha^ e not been wrought 
to an edge. I have several specimens of hoes from the same ridge be- 
yond the settlement where it would naturally be cultivated, that from 
their highly polished working ends show long use. The lessen is that 
they are not made from great flakes, but rather represent the core from 
which flakes have been thrown off. Finished hoes and spades frequently 
have portions of natural stone partings that have nob been worked off, 
and show them to have been worked from thin slabs. These slabs are 
a metamorphic thin bedded sandstone, belonging to what our State 
geologist, Prof. A. H. Worthen, calls the Chester group. They occur 
near the Saline, about 8 miles above the flaking ground, in an upheaval 
that has brought them to the surface with the upturned edges of the 
carboniferous limestone through which the salt springs flow. This is 
probably the source whence this quartzite was obtained, as slabs from 1 
inch to 2 inches thick are found there; but there are many other locations 
stretching across Southern Illinois to the Mississippi Eiver where they 
also occur. 

It is the large agricultural implements that I refer to as having been 
made from quartzite slabs, some of which are as much as 16 inches long 
by 6 inches and 7 inches wide at the spade-blade end. There are many 
smaller specimens of the same form and character that have been regu- 
larly flaked from chert, white waxy quartz, yellow and brown jasper, 
that do not exceed 6 or 7 inches in length, their working ends highly 
polished by long use in digging. It is the large hoes and spades flaked 
from quartzite slabs that to me are evidence of a much higher degree 
of intelligence and skill than the most highly-finished spear and arrow 
points evince. Take an edge view of one of these large spades, and 
observe how accurately straight and free from wind fhe edge has been 
carried entirely around the implement, the flattening of one side and 
rounding the other ; then observe that the long flat very slightly 
depressed flakes have been thrown off at right angles to the edge, even 
to those curving around its digging or cutting end, which appear to 
have radiated from a common center. If these flakes have been thrown 
off by blows so struck and directed as to preserve the cleanly lined 
edges, as the operator had carried them in his mind, a skill must have 
been acquired that we cannot approach. 

In all the experiments that I have tried with a hammer, whether of 
stone, steel, soft iron, orcoj)per, they have failed to produce the desired

result 5 tlie seat of the flake is more eondioidal, shorter and deeper de- 
pressed, whereas the direct percussive pressure throws off the shape of 
flake that we find has been done in making these spades. If this mode 
has been resorted to, it necessarily required considerable ingenuity in 
devices for holding the stone slab flrmly, while the pressure was being 
applied in the right direction. The wooden clamp described by Gatlin 
may have been used. The simplest device that occurs to me that will 
answer the purpose is a block of wood planted in the ground, with its 
end grain up, cut on top into steps, as represented in sketch, Fig. 6, the

lower step having grooves jiarallel with the rise of the upper step ; in 
one of these grooves the edge of the implement is placed, its back rest- 
ing against the edge of the higher step, as represented by the dotted 
lines showing the form of a sjiade. When in this position, presenting 
the pro^jer angle to the operator, a man holds it firmly while another 
applies the pressure. A lower step, e, with the back edge of top are 
hollowed out to receive the work, while its lower end rests in an inden- 
tation in the lower step. In this manner a spade can be flrmly held 
w'hile its cutting end is being flaked. I do not present this as a mode 
that was practiced, but as a device that answers the purpose, and I 
judge to be within the capacity of the ancient flint-workers, of whom 
there is nothing left but their chips and finished work. 

Let any one experiment with a bone point in chipping flint; he will 
soon discover the value of a dry hone, a bone free from grease that will 
hold to its work without slipping, a bone with sufficient hardness to 
resist abrasion, a bone of strength to bear the pressure, and he will 
value such a pointed bone, and will understand why, with such a bone,

free their flaking-bones from grease by burj ing them in moistened clay 
and wood ashes, not unlike the common practice of our housewives to 
remove grease spots from their kitchen floors. 

The hunter or trapper described to me a mode still in practice among 
the remote Indians of making flakes by lever pressure combined with- 
percussion, that is more philosojihical and a better mechanical arrange-

meat than by the use of a flaking-staff, as described by Gatlin, Figure 
7 shows the manner of utilizing a standing tree with spreading roots 



for this purpose ; a flattened root makes a firm seat for the stone, a 
notch cut into the body of a tree the fulcrum for the lever; either a 
pointed stick is placed on the point of the stone where the flake is to 
be split from it, its upper end resting against the under side of the 
lever, or a bone or horn point let into and secured to the lever takes 
the place of this stick. When the pressure is brought to bear, by the 
weight of the operation, on the long end of the lever, a second man 
with a stone, mall, or heavy club strikes a blow on the upper side of 
the lever, directly over the pointed stick or horn-point, and the flake is 
thrown off. 

Lubbock, in “ Prehistoric Times,” illustrated the Eskimo scraper as 
used at the present time in preparing skins. When we consider the 
close proximity of the flint workshop to the great salt licks on the Sa- 
line Eiver, the flowing salt springs, the deeply worn buffalo paths still 
to be seen after having been subject to the destructive work of cultiva- 
tion by the plow for more than a generation, where skins by the thou- 
sands must have been dressed, it is not surprising that the many chert 
flakes that have been split off with too great a curvature of their flat 
side in their length to admit of being chipped into arrow-points should 
have been utilized for scrapers, many of which are the exact /ac simile 
of what Lubbock has illustrated as the Eskimo and others of the Euro- 
pean type, of which he says : 

“ It is curious, that while these spoon-shaped scrapers are so common 
in Europe, they are very rare, if indeed they occur at all, in North Am- 
erica south of the Eskimo region.” 

1 think it most probable from their close resemblance to refuse flakes 
and chips they were overlooked by early collectors. In the great game 
districts of the West, both in flint workshops and among the waste of 
Indian settlements, they arc much more abundant than arrow-heads,, 
or any other implements, with the exception of the small flint knives..

PAPEES RELATING TO ANTHROPOLOGY. 


It is also in these game districts that what is known as the “ bevel- 
edge arrow-points ” are found, that have been a subject of much discus- 
sion as to their use. Foster says of the one he has illustrated: “The 
specimen represented is from Professor Cox’s collection, and the two edges 
are symmetrically beveled, as if to give it a rotary motion.” I have met 
many others that accept this idea, unmindful of the fact that a ship is 
not steered at its stem, but by the rudder, at its stern, and an arrow is 
not directed or held to its course by its point, but by the feather at the 
butt end of its shaft ; and if a rotary motion was required it would natu- 
rally be given by placing the feathers spirally around the shaft. The 
broat flat sides of these beveled points would neutralize any effect from 
the short bevels in passing through the air. 

I have heard it urged that they were reamers, and that the uniform bevel 
being in one direction, to cut as reamers they would have to be turned to 
the left, or, as our workmen say, “against the sun.” Fi’om this it has 
been argued that the people who used them belonged to a left-handed 
race. The direction and uniformity in the bevels is to me evidence of 
exactly the reverse. Among all the points we find they are the simplest 
and easiest to form by chipping when laid on their flat. Nothing but the 
down pressure of flaker is required to separate a chip from a flat at a 
45-degree angle. Suppose a flake that had been roughly shaped held 
flat on a block of wood by the fingers of the left hand, the tool in the 
right hand chipping from the point to the broad end by direct down 
pressure ; then by turning the flake over and working the other edge 
in the same manner, we have in a center cross-section a form resemb- 
ling a long-stretched rhomboid with sharp cutting serrated edges at 
the acute angles. 

Colonel Long said that 2 inches was the greatest length of stone 
arrow-heads that he found in use among the Indians ; that all longer 



Fig. 8 

not used for javelin and spear-heads were strongly hafted and used as 
cutting implements. This was confirmed by Gatlin. It is more wheie 
and under what circumstances we find a stone tool than the tool itself

that teaches its probable use. lu the case of the bevel-edged points, 
all I have found have been among waste where the users have lived, 
done their cooking and skin-dressing ; and these were always associated 
with broken bones, muscle shells, fragments of pottery, flint knives, 
scrapers, &c,, never scattered as if lost in hunting, as we find arrow-heads. 
One peculiarity of the bevel point is its strong, massive shank to secure 
it to a shaft or handle. This is shown in Figs. 8 and 9, with their cross-sec- 



tions on the dotted lines 5 they are both ofvery dark, hard chert. Fig, 10 is 
from Bath County, Kentucky, near the Upper Blue Lick ; it is of beauti- 
fully striped jasper ; two sections are given to show the great thickness 
to give strength to the cutting-edges Fig. 11, yellow jasper; the want 
of symmetry in form is most probably the result of sharpening by fresh 
flaking. Fig. 12, a beautiful specimen of workmanship, showing a differ-

ent mode of attachment to a handle. All the ahove are drawn full size. 
In a small cache of leaf-shaped implements were found six of the bevel- 
edged iioints, all broken off at the shank in precisely the same manner, — 
pretty conclusive evidence of hard service, and probably brought to 
the workshop to have new shanks formed and to be re-hafted.

The only effort at drilling or piercing that I have found among the 
rubbish is a piece of yellow fluorspar 2 inches long, roughly rounded to 
inches diameter ; in one end a hole one-fourth inch in diameter has 
been drilled three-fourths inch deep ; at the other end, a hole one-eighth 
inch diameter and only one-fourth inch deep. Many pierced imjjlements 
have been found at or near dwelling sites associated with this flint man- 
ufactory, such as banner stones split through the drilled eye; some split 
fragments of tubes of great length, made out of hard schistose slate. 

Among the waste are pieces of specular iron ore from Missouri, in ev- 
idence that it was worked here, probably into axes and weights or plumb- 
bobs. There is also evidence that argillaceous iron ore, the clay iron 
stone or carbonates of the coal measures, was a material extensively 
used. From the various forms of much oxidized pieces that I have found 
that will not bear handling, they appear to have been cutting or carving 
tools, probably used in the manufactories ; though axes and celts made 
from this material are occasionally found in the vicinity of the salt licks, 
always deeply oxidized, peeling off in flakes that conform to the origi- 
nal form of the implement. 

Many scooped or hollowed out blocks of sandstone or large flattish 
river bowlders, mostly sunk on both sides, that are classed as mortars 
for crushing corn, and with them crushing stones and pestles, have been 
plowed up on this flaking ground, but they are much more abundant on 
the dwelling portion of the ridge ; also river pebbles partly pecked to 
an edge for celts, some of them roughly grooved for axes ; but what 
surprised me most was the great number of what have been called 
cup-stones, by some nut-stones. These are frequently found scattered 
over Southern Illinois and Western Kentucky, and occasionally on all 
the tributaries of the Mississippi. But here they are found in mass. 
When the ground was first put under cultivation none were seen, 
and it was not until the great denuding floods had passed over it that 
they were exposed. On finding, just above the surface of the ground, 
the face of a fine Specimen that showed a number of cups, I loosened 
and turned it over to examine the cups on the under side, and found it 
was lying on top of another. With inck and spade I soon exposed a 
group or pile of over twenty, and with them a number of slabs of the same 
sandstone that showed marks of having been used as rub or grind- 
stones, all from the millstone-grit series from the bluffs on the opposite 
side of the Saline. Further research developed a number of such piles, 
some only having the cup-like indentations, as illustrated at page 40 of 
No. 287 of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge ; others having 
a center depression of from 4 to 6 inches in diameter, similar to the rude 
mortars with the cups irregularly arranged around them. Subsequent 
overflows exposed many scattered over the entire flaking ground; they 
varied in size from large pebbles with a single cup on opposite sides, 
known to the early settlers as having been used by the Indians as nut- 
stones, up to massive slabs, having from two up to eight and ten cups

on a side, some too heavy for me to lift into my wagon without assist- 
ance (the largest I have seen was taken from near the center of a large 
mound in Bath County, Kentucky; it had twenty-seven cups one side 
and a greater number on the other). Many have been carried away from 
the flaking ground and used as cornerstones for log cabins or built into 
hearths and fire-backs to their wooden curb fireplaces, with their stick- 
and clay daubed chimneys. So many being found where the manu- 
facturing of stone implements has been so extensively carried on is 
suggestive to a mechanic that they were either made on the ground and 
kept on hand for sale, or they were tools in some way used in their 
works. That they were newly made can hardly be the case, for very fre- 
quently one cup has been worn into another. This, considering their 
sharp grit, rather points to some grinding process. Had they been 
for paint receptacles or pallets, we would expect to find them at dwell- 
ing places (where the Indians would naturally do their dressing and 
painting), and not in their workshops. 

On the opposite side of the Saline River, due south of the flaking 
bank, a spur from the main ridge terminates abruptly by a very steep 
descent to the bottom lands, which at this point have a breadth of about 
50 yards ; at the foot of this bluff are masses of sandstone ; they also 
project out of the steepest portion of the earth (at a time long past about 
100 feet high), from the top of which the ascent is gradual to the crown 
of the ridge, forming a beautiful inclined plateau extending with the 
ridge until it is lost by steep inclines into the valley of the Little Sa- 
line, a small tributary that has cut through the ridge and falls into the 
Saline IJ miles above its junction with the Ohio, and midway between 
its mouth and the first ripple. This plateau, when I first saw it, in 1854, 
was covered with heavy timber, many trees being from 5 feet to 6 feet 
in diameter. The broad valley of the Little Saline had some portions 
that are above the ordinary overflows cleared and under cultivation as 
early as 1834. The slope from the ridge to the Saline, including its 
bottom lands, have been under process of clearing since 1859. After 
the plow had loosened the soil, and it had been washed by the rains, 
both the slope and fhebottoms have been rich in stone relics, the bot- 
toms — particularly, in the agricultural implements of the Mound Builders. 
Climbing the steep directly opposite the flaking bank, chips of chert are 
found mixed through all the soil that has been worked from above, 
changing the rock bluft' into the present steep incline, on the top of 
which on its turn from the steep to the gradual slope, another flaking 
place has been exposed. There within a space of two acres and not 
over an hour’s tramp, on the fresh-plowed earth, I found scattered over 
twenty specimens of the cup-stones, which I collected and piled in a heap. 
This is another instance of their having been left among the offal of a 
workshop. 

In the valley formed by the junction of the Big and Little Saline, oc- 
cur extensive earth-works, long walls, mounds, &c. The largest of the

mounds has a height of 25 feet, length of base 225 feet, and width of 
175 feet; its oval, truncated top is about 35 by 70 feet; its direction 
lengthwise is north 12 degrees west ; it has a graded way on the east 
side, and was originally faced with stone; over one hundred wagon- 
loads have been taken from it and used in walling drains. 

The earth-work and mounds extend on to the ridge to within one- 
fourth of a mile of the flaking ground on the bluff, thus connecting all 
these works. On the spurs near the Sabine are cemeteries and sepul- 
chral mounds, from which many human bones have been turned out by 
the plow. I have opened several of the mounds, one of which, from a 
mechanical point of view, possessed great interest, for the i^rimary inter- 
ment over which it was raised was that of a worker in stone ; and who 
knows but he may have been at a time the master mechanic orchief super- 
intendent of the great flint works? The center of his mound was paved 
with the valves of the muscle shells of the Sabine, laid on the levelled 
surfiice of the natural soil in concentric rings, with the convex sides up. 
This shell pavement was about 7 feet in diameter; on its center was a 
pillow composed of twenty-seven pebble rub-stones of various grit and 
differently shaped edges. On these the skull was laid on its side ; it was 
far gone in decay and crushed out of shape; the teeth much worn; the 
position of the large bones that escaped decay showed the man had been 
bent, bringing his knees near his chin, and laid on his side. He was a man 
of massive frame; the femur measured 19 inches and the tibia 15J inches 
long. Close to the crown of his head stood a rude clay vessel, badly 
broken; in front of the skull, on the rub stone pillow, a gorget, finished 
with the exception of drilling hole for suspending it, on which lay a 
plumb-bob, a stag’s tine scraped to a point; this broke to pieces on 
removing it. There were some bone splints, two canine teeth of a 
wolf, some pieces of galena, one crystal of mica one-half inch thick (the 
plates had not been parted), a few chert flakes, and a single finished 
arrow-point: on the shell floor of the mound, near its outer edge, one 
of the mysterious cup -stones, with three cups on one side and four on 
the other. I could not see that it had been placed with any reference to 
the center skeleton, but close to it, on the shell floor, lay a small -sized 
skull in a better state of preservation than the central one. A large hole 
in the back of it showed it had been crushed in, the broken portions 
either having been removed or decayed. Close to it lay the deadly 
slingstone, of roughly shaped chert. The decayed and broken bones 
of this skeleton had been thrown out in removing the earth from the 
shell floor, so that its position could not be accurately ascertained, 
though from portions of bone still remaining after the skull was dis- 
covered it was evident that the entire skeleton lay on the shell floor, 
and close to the central one, and was no doubt a primary interment. 

Among these earth-works, where the densest aboriginal population 
have left their marks, stands a farm house and its outbuildings, with 
its garden on a pre-historic cemetery. From this point radiated the

early clearing and cultivation that has been most destructive to the 
long wall earthworks, and was the place of all others where I ex- 
pected to find the cup-stones. The single-pit nut-stones and indented 
hammer-stones wore plenty, and also the rude mortars, but the cup- 
stones were comparatively few. 

An aged farmer, whose father with his family emigrated from Virginia 
into this section when it was Indian territory, and who as a boy worked 
at the early salt works, tells me that the Indians then here used the sin- 
gle-pit nut-stones, but they did not know anything about the cup-stones. 
He asked me if I could divine any use for them. On my suggesting 
grinding he said I was wrong and that he could tell me their use. I 
will now give his explanation as near as I can in his own language. 
He said : “ If you want to see them in daily use, go to Patagonia, and you 
can any day see a lot of women squatting around one of these stones 
spinning yarn and talking scandal. You see, they strip and singe the 
hair off of a piece of raw hide, lay it on the stone with the flesh side upj 
they then squeeze it into the cup holes and put something on to hold it 
while it dries. Then you see every cup makes a step for the foot of a 
spindle to rest in, and holds just enough grease in it to make the spindle 
run slick; and, depend on it, that is the way the thread was spun here 
to weave the cloth that has left its impressions on the pieces of the old 
clay salt-pans. You know that our Indians did not know anything about 
them, or of salt either, for that matter; so how could they know what 
these stones were used for?” I understood him to say that when a boy 
he learned this from a Pacific whaler, who drifted to the salt works, 
and who related that on one occasion the vessel he was on laid up for 
some time in the Straits of Magellan, and that he then saw the Patago- 
nian women using just such stones as steps for their spindles. 

If that could have been the use of those that are so abundant here, 
we should expect to find them where the women dwell rather than at 
the flint workshops, the same reasoning applying to their use as paint 
pallets. If used for either of these purposes, why do we find the cup 
depressions on both sides, and many of the cups of various size, some 
j list started and others worn one into another ? 

From the fact of the upper stone of the piles as they were left on the 
flaking ground being covered with such a depth of vegetable mold as 
not to have been discovered until after cultivation and exposure by the 
denuding floods, the finding one in the mound with the decayed skele- 
ton of a stone-worker, the one I have before referred to as having been 
found near the center of a large mound in Kentucky, leaves little room 
to doubt of their having been, as well as the primeval workshops, coe- 
val with the earth-works and their associated mounds. 

There are other evidences of great antiquity in the condition of many 
of the granite and porphyry implements being honeycombed by the 
disintegration of their feldspar, leaving the silicious portions rough

and projecting, Celts and fleshers made of the carboniferous limestones 
have the silex skeletons of their fossils sharp and clearly marked. 

From the location at the first ripple of the Sabine as a fishing point, 
the proximity of the salt-licks for the larger game, no doubt the place 
was frequented, if not permanently occupied, by the last of the Indians 
in this section, who have left their stone implements scattered broad- 
cast over the country. They had lost value Ijy the introduction of the 
nailers iron points, the rifle, knives, and the usual stock of the Indian 
trader. Had not this paper extended far beyond my original intent, 
I could give an accumulation of evidence of the rapid decline in the art 
of flaking stone. 

From a mechanical stand-point, it is hard, if not impossible, to recon- 
cile the accepted evolution of works of the stone age from flaked to 
ground and i)olished implements. It is true that specimens are found 
in all stages of progress from rough flake to polished implements in 
America as well as in Europe. But here in America, where the true flint 
is absent, a greater range of stone has been resorted to, and what we 
find flaked and afterwards ground and polished are mostly cutting tools, 
such as chisels, gouges, &c., of chert, jasper, or fine-grained quartzite 
that will maintain a keen cutting.edge. 

For axes, either plain or grooved, the water- worn pebbles of greenstone, 
granite, or porphyry have mostly been selected. For fleshers, softer 
stones are common, such as limestone of various qualities, steatite, oc- 
casionally cannel coal, and the harder shales of the coal measures have 
been used for these wedge-shaped implements. But let the material be 
what it may, the pecking with a hard stone on a water-worn pebble, often 
found nearly of the required shape, to modify and bring it to a cutting- 
edge ready for grinding, by simply rubbing with sand and water on a 
flat ston.e, only required labor, patience, and perseverance, but not the 
knowledge and skill requisite to split off the flakes, nor the judgment, 
steady hand, and correct eye to shape them into the exquisitely sym- 
metrical forms we find them. 

I am not writing on or questioning the evidence of the antiquity of 
man, but simply on the instruments and tools he would naturally resort 
to, in his primitive state, to sustain life when depending for food, on 
the waters for fish, the earth for fruits, seeds, nuts'; and roots, and on 
the chase for animals, not only for food, but, what was most essential 
for his comfort, skins for clothing, sinews, bone, and horn for innumer- 
able uses. With the aid of a sharpened pebble (stone ax) he could at- 
tack a forest tree, and by the aid of fire shape its wood to his uses. 
Most probably scraping came in advance of cutting, and what could be 
better adapted for this purpose than the sharp edges of fractured flint 
pebbles ? 

With the wooden bow and arrow arose the necessity for an arrow- 
point harder than wood. If bone was used, the pebble scraper was es- 
sential. The river drift or gravel bars, when subjected to the grinding

and crushing action of drift-logs or rolling bowlders, would furnish many 
suggestive forms and shapes that a little ingenuity would apply, and 
out of which would naturally grow the art of flaking. 

The streets of Paducah, Ky., are paved with partly rounded, angular, 
siUcious gravel, mostly of jasper. Seeing heaps of this ready for spread- 
ing, I was struck by the inany forms, mostly highly water polished, that 
if found on a flaking ground would pass for refuse flakes and rubbish 
left by the workmen. 

On inquiry I was informed that this coarse gravel waiS from banks 
on the Tennessee River above the ordinary overflows. I selected many 
forms that any archaeologist would pronounce to be the work of man. 

A heavy wagon, loaded with hogsheads of tobacco, drawn by five or 
six yoke of oxen, passed over the fresh-spread gravel with a sharp, 
crushing, grinding sound. On examining the wheel tracks I was sur- 
prised to find the slight impression the iron tire had made on the sur- 
face stones. They had been pressed aside from the wheels, leaving a 
slight rut, those under the wheels compressed together, but very little 
broken ; not sufficient to account for the sharp, crackling noise made as 
the wagon-wheels passed over them. On examining the effect from the 
tread of the wheels to the old road-bed, a depth of about 6 inches, I 
found most of the larger gravel stones under the top layer split, some into 
flakes, the fractures in various directions, some crossing others. This 
spread from the width of the wheel-tires to about three times as wide 
on the old road-bed. Many of the fresh fractures presented the forms 
and appearance of genuine cores, and would be mistaken for the work 
of man. It was a beautiful illustration of the effect of pressure on small 
points of contact. Our lady friends, often inveterate iced-tea drinkers, 
when they find a lump of ice too large for their glass, will, with a com- 
mon toilet-pin between thumb and finger, press its point into the ice, tap 
its head with the handle of a case-knife, or give it a click with a thimble. 
The cohesion is destroyed and the ice splits with just such a fracture 
as is made by impulsive point pressure on the more tenacious and re- 
factory chert. 

These Paducah observations led to con siderable investigation as to 
the action of lodged drift-logs on gravel-bars, and finally to an experi- 
ment that I should recommend the Smithsonian Institution to try on 
more extensive scale than I was able to. 

I filled a metal cylinder with pebbles of various sizes and shapes, 
brought a pressure by a screw on them through a plunger; immediately 
a crepitating sound was heard, which as the pressure increased became 
sharper and louder, at times almost explosive, as the interstices became 
tilled with broken fragments, producing side pressure and cross fract- 
ures. The sound became more confused and died away. On emptying 
the cylinder, the result was many representations of the rude imple- 
ments found in the drift.

COPPER IMPLEMENTS FROM BAYFIELD, WISCONSIN. 


By Colo uel Chaeles Whittlesey, of Cleveland, Ohio. 


lu grading the streets of Bayfield, Wis., about the year 1864, the 
workmen found a copper implement in the gravel. The accompanying 
figure, one-half the natural size, will give some idea of the shape and 

character of the specimen (Figure 1). A 
is an upright outline or elevation, with 
the concave surface toward the rear. B 
is a top view or plan of the implement 
as seen from above, and C a vertical or 
longitudinal section through the middle 
at the dotted line c d. The irregular 
space e e shows a flaw in the metal. 

Several have been found elsewhere in 
the United States and Canada of about 
the same outline, but generally the blade 
or flat part is much larger in proportion 
to the shank or socket. Where the two 
parts are equal they are regarded as 
spades. One described by Mr. Squier in 
“Ancient Monuments,” taken from a sepulchral deposit near Brookville, 
Canada, is about 10 inches in length. It could be used in digging by 
inserting a handle several feet in length, with a notch or offset for the 
foot near the bottom. 

Those with the short bit may have been spades worn out by use. 
Their edges are generally sharp, as though they had been used to cut 
wood or some other hard substance. After they were well worn as 
spades they could be turned into an adze by inserting a crotch, with 
the plane of the blade at right angle with the plane of the handle, or 
into an ax by making the planes coincide.

Works near Winchester, Adams County, Ohio . — ^Winchester Township 
is located in the extreme northwestern corner of Adams County, Ohio. 
The terminal moraine of the great ice age enters the township at the 
northeastern corner, extends diagonally across it, and passes out at the 
southwestern extremity. The township, for agricultural purposes, is 
the richest in the county. The soil, for the most part, is poor, known 
as cold clay, and the surface broken by the tributaries of Brush Creek. 

North of the village of Winchester, a distance of one-half mile, is a 
series of circular works, which for fifty or more years have been plowed 
over. Near the center of these works is a mound (A) (Plan 1) 8 feet 



894

high, conical in form, which has never been disturbed by the plow 
From the top to the bottom on the east side is 50 feet ; from top to cir- 
cumference on north side 48 feet. East of this mound {a b), a distance 
of 172 feet, is the circle B. The wall is almost level with the surround- 
ing surface, although from 6 inches to 1 foot high along the line g b h. 
The remaining part of the work is difficult to trace. The gateway can- 
not now be located, although it is said to have faced the east. South 
of the mound (c d), a distance of 175 feet, was formerly another circle ((7), 
but no trace of it exists at the present time. 

West of the mound (e/), a distance of 540 feet, is the circle D, 150 
feet in diameter. This work presents a wall averaging from 10 to 15 
inches in height with a ditch in the interior. I was unable to locate 
a gateway . 

When first discovered these works were covered with forest trees. 
The walls averaged 5 feet in height. The material is composed of clay 
of the same kind as that in the immediate vicinity. The mound has 
never been opened. The spot is level, and appears to have been well 
chosen. Following are the measurements : 

(A.) Conical mound, 8 feet high ; east to top, 50 feet ; north to top, 48 
feet. 

(B.) Circle 172 feet east of mound. Circle 510 feet in circumference. 

(C.) Obliterated circle 175 feet south of mound. 

(B.) Circle 540 feet west of mound. Circle 150 feet diameter. 

One mile and a quarter north of these works, located on a high point 
of ground, is a mound (Entry No. 3, Map b) removed a few rods west of 
the Hillsboro’ turnpike. The mound is conical, 14 feet in height, with 
a circumference of 250 feet at the base. Original height, 20 feet; solid 
contents, 2,098 cubic yards. From its summit a fine view of the country 
may be obtained. 

On Entry No. 8 (see map) is a small mound (c) 3 feet in height. 

WorJcs in Bagle Township^ Brown County, Ohio . — Eagle Township 
(see map) is bounded on the north by Highland County (White Oak 
and Concord Townships); on the east by Adams County (Winchester 
Township) ; on the south by Jackson Townshij), and ou the west by 
Washington Township. The general surface is comparatively level, 
although the west fork of Brush Creek has made a deep valley running 
from west to east. Some of the tributaries of this stream have formed 
deep ravines. Where these ravines have cut through the glacial till 
the Hudson Eiver blue limestone is exposed, save in one spot (see map 
Z, entry 398), I noticed Clinton strata. 

The ancient remains located on entries 398 and 1316, in company with 
Prof. J. W. Fertig, I measured, May 16, 1885 (see Plan 2). The mound 
A is located on the line between Brown and Adams Counties. It is 
located on a knoll, several of which occur in the immediate vicinity. 
It is difficult to tell just where the base of the mound begins. If the 
place I assumed to be the base is the correct one then the mound is 328

feet in circumference; from northwest base to top, 70 feet, angle 11°; 
southeast to top, 44 feet, angle 15°; solid contents, 1,533 cubic yards; 
height, 14^ feet. A view of the country to the southeast is here pre- 
sented. 

Measuring due west and passing through two deep ravines we come 
to fort (B), striking it at a, and removed from the mound a distance of 
1,970 feet. This work is entirely surrounded by deep ravines, save a 
narrow strip of land at the north. That part of the wall marked p c h 
d e g is in woodland. From p to h the wall is about 18 inches high ; 
from htod not over 12 inches, while from e to g it will average 32 inches. 
A ditch in the interior extends from c to h, also from e to g. The highest 
point of land is at p, thence the wall extends rapidly down the ravine 
until it is almost level with the bottom at s, thence it rapidly rises to 
e, then declines to g. From g to a the wall is entirely obliterated, that 
part of the work having been under cultivation for the past forty years. 
From e to 6 is a gradual ascent, the distance being 985 feet. The dis- 
tance from a to 6 to c to rf is 1,291 feet ; from d to e 75 feet, and from e 
to g 130 feet ; from a to b 300 feet, and from a direct to c 400 feet ; 
from the point e (B) we started directly west a distance of 1,875 feet, 
as we measured it. This number must not be relied upon as being cor- 
rect. Owing to the density of the underbrush on the west side of the 
ravine we were forced to deviate from a straight line, but the result 
was as near as we could reach it without cutting a straight path. At 
the end of the distance measured, and between two small ravines, on 
a piece of land sloping to the southeast, is an arc of a circle [C) 288 feet 
in length. The wall has been plowed over for fifty years, yet is 2 feet 
in height, with a base 20 feet in diameter, and accompanied by a ditch 
in the interior. 

Measuring westward 1,993 feet, and through open grounds compara- 
tively level, we reach the mound E. This mound is 332 feet in circum- 
ference at the base ; from north side to top, 44 feet ; from south side to 
top, 44 feet; across the top, 21 feet ; slope angle, 34 degrees ; height, 
24J feet ; solid contents, 2,516 cubic yards. It is perfectly symmetri- 
cal ; commands a fine view of the surrounding country ; has never been 
disturbed by jdow, pick, or shovel, and is one of the most beautiful 
mounds in the State. It is surrounded by a circle 160 feet in diameter. 
The circle, however, is plowed almost down to the general level of the 
surface. There are indications of a gateway at the east. At a dis- 
tance of 640 feet southeast of the mound is the circle D, 865 feet in 
circumference. The original height of the wall was 10 feet. It is now 
about 2 feet, and 40 feet in diameter at the base. The gateway is to- 
wards the northeast. 

Due north of the mound a distance of about 300 feet was a walled 
well. The history of this well is not known ; it was there when the first 
settlers came. It has been filled up, and now plowed over. 

The whole distance from the foot of the mound A to that of E, as 


ANCIENT REMAINS IN OHIO. 


897 


measured, is 6,526 feet. The figures ruu 1,970, 1,875, and 1,993. The 
difference between the two opposite figures is 118 feet. The average 
distance would be 1,916 feet, while the average of all, including works 
not given, 2,175. It is more than probable that some system in these 
measurements was followed. 



Ancient remains in Concord Township, Highland County, Ohio . — Three 
and one-half miles northeast of the mound A (Plan 2) are ancient re- 
mains (see Plan 3) located on Entry 281, Concord ToAvnship, Highland 
County, Ohio. The spot where these works occur is a secluded one. 
Great west fork of Brush Creek makes a bend almost at right angles. 
The land slopes from the northeast. Before reaching the creek a bench 
is met, upon which these works are built. No view can here be obtained 
of the surrounding country, because it is literally hemmed in by hills. 
The most interesting work is the stone structure marked B (Plan 3). 
The entire wall, except from a to e, is composed of Hudson Eiver lime- 
stone. The stone has been burnt, and for a long period exposed to the

elements. The wall has been thrown down, yet its regularity is perfectly 
preserved. The following are the measurements : From a to e (inside 
to inside of wall), 32 feet; 6 to d (inside to inside of wall), 32 feet; h to 
c, 125 feet ; e to d to c, 165 feet ; a to 6 to c, 165 feet ; thickness of wall 
across base at c, 21 feet ; thickness of wall across base at ft, 24 feet; also 
same at^. Height of stone wall, 2 feet. From a to e the wall is com- 
posed of earth, is 8 inches in height and 7 feet in breadth. The floor 
on the interior of this work is perfectly level. 

Fifty-two feet due north-east of this work is a section of a circle {A). 
The waU has been plowed over, and wiU not average over 1 foot in 
height by 22 feet across. The distance from g to/, following the curve, 
is 225 feet, and on a straight line 130 feet. 

Two hundred and eighty -five feet due east of a {B) is a mound 3 feet 
high and 22 feet diameter. 

At a distance of one-fourth of a mile northeast of (A) is another mound 
located upon a hill, but not having a commanding view of the country, 
nor of the works just described. 

It is fair to assume that the works near Winchester, those of Eagle 
Township, and the ones just described, belonged to the same people. 
There is no evidence that they were constructed in different ages and 
by different people. The nearness of the structures to each other, and 
their evidently unfinished condition point to the same time and the same 
people. On a straight line some 6 or 8 miles east is the Great Serpent 
Mound. This is removed a distance of about 5 miles from “Fort Hill,’’ 
in Brush Creek Township, Highland County, Ohio. This work has 
been figured and described* in “Ancient Monuments,” with the addi- 
tional information that “ no other remains, except perhaps a few small, 
scattered mounds, in its vicinity.” Near the southern foot of the hill 
upon which the fort is located is a series of circular works, now almost 
obliterated. 

It is a fair assumption that the builders of “ Fort HiU” and the circles 
near it belonged to a clan separate, yet related to the one that con- 
structed the works near Winchester. 

Now, the so-called “serpent efiigy” is composed of a frog, an egg, and 
a serpent. Why may not one of these clans have been the frog, and 
the other the serpent, or snake; and the series of the efiBgies represent 
that the snake clan came from the frog? 

Ancient remains in GlanrTce County^ Ohio. — On May 23, 1885, in com- 
pany with Prof. J. W. Freeman, I visited the works located on the land 
of Benjamin Newlove, section 29, Harmony Township, Clarke County, 
Ohio. When these works were first discovered only saplings were grow- 
ing upon them. The works are situated on the side of a hill descending 
towards the northeast (see Plan 4). The larger work is oblong, the 
longest diameter being 320 feet, and the transverse 250 feet. The gate- 
way u 6 is 33 feet; the entire wall is 821 feet long ; the waU at d is 7 feet

is in the interior, extending the whole distance around save at the gate- 
way. Here the land is perfectly level. The ditch does not touch the 
embankment. A platform averaging 4 feet across follows between the 
line of embankment and the ditch. 

By the side of the work {A) is the circle {B). From the bank of one 
to that of the other at the nearest point is 34 feet. The bank is 560

feet in circumference, to which is to be ad,ded 45 feet for the gateway 
g h. The wall is 5 feet high, with a diameter at the base of 25 feet. 
The work is accompanied by an interior ditch, which, however, does 
not extend across the gateway. Between the interior foot of the em- 
bankment and the ditch is a platform 20 feet in width. 

One hundred and forty feet north of the small circle is a circular es- 
tufa, walled with small bowlders. Forty feet still farther north is a 
spring of clear cold water, which has never been known to fail. 


A PRIMITIVE STOREHOUSE OF THE CREEK IKDIAKS. 

By Charles C. Jones, Jr., of Aynsta, Georgia. 

In his description of the customs of the ancient inhabitants of Virginia, 
William Strachey* sajs: “Their come and, indeed, their copper 
hatchetts, bowses, beades, perle and most things with them of value, 
according to their own estymacion, they hide, one from the knowledge 
of another, in the grownd within the woodes, and so keepe them all the 
yeare, or untill they have fitt use for them, as the Romans did their 
monies and treasure in certaine cellars, called therefore as Pliuye remem- 
bers, /avmce; and when they take them forth they scarse make their 
women privie to the store-house.” 

In plate xxii of the Brevis Karratio [Fraucoforti ad Moeuum aiDXCi], 
le Moyne de Morgues furnishes a drawing of what, in the accompany- 
ing text, is called a publicum liorreum. It is situated upon the low bank 
of a river, and toward it canoes — filled with corn and fruits, and pro- 
pelled by Florida Indians — are tending. Such granaries or public recep- 
tacles were, by the peoples dwelling within the limits of the extensive 
domain then known as Florida, built of stones or earth, and roofed with 
palmetto leaves and clay. For their location cool spots were selected, 
where protection was found against the violent rays of the sun. They 
served as depositories for maize, fruits, nuts, nutricious roots, dried 
fishes, alligators, deer, dogs, and other jerked meats. Hoards of corn, 
nuts, and meat are frequently mentioned in the early narratives as ex- 
istent among the primitive peoples of this region at the time of iirimal 
contact with Europeans. They were both iniblic and private. 

In alluding to the agricultural occupations of the Southern Indians 
Mr. Bartram observes : “ When the fruits of their labors are ripe and in 
fit order to gather in, they all, on they same day, repair to the planta- 
tion, each gathers the produce of his own proper lot, brings it to town, 
and deposits it in his own crib, allotting a certain iDortion for the public 
granary which is called the King’s crib because its contents are at his

Society, 1849.)

disposal, though not his private property, but considered as the tribute 
or free contribution of the citizens of the State at the disposal of the 
King.” He further states that the common or public granary served 
the valuable purposes of assisting the needy when in sore want, of fur- 
nishing entertainment for strangers and noted guests, and of supplying 
warriors with provisions when they were setting out on hostile expe- 
ditions. 

That the American Indians often concealed in the ground and in se- 
cure receptacles not only the products of their agricultural labor and 
trophies of the chase, but also objects manufactured of clay, shell, and 
stone, is a fact capable of easy demonstration. Without enumerating 
the proofs, or pausing to cite authorities in su])port of the frequent use 
by the Southern Indians in the sixteenth century of storehouses, both 
public and imivate, we desire to call attention to the existence of one 
of these primitive structures upon the plantation of Colonel Seaborn 
Jones, at Mill Haven, in Screven County, Georgia. For quite a century 
it has remained unchanged. It is located upon the declivity of the 
right bank of Briar Creek, in proximity to that stream, and in the midst 
of a beautiful forest of oak, holly, and pine. Cylindrical in shape, this 
receptacle has a diameter of 8 feet, and is about 6 feet deep. The ex- 
cavation in the ground was at first carelully and regularly made and, 
when completed, the sides and bottom were covered with a uuiform 
layer of well-kneaded red clay 4 inches in thickness. These clay walls, 
the interior surface of which was pressed hard and smooth, are still 
quite perfec.t. As one looks upon the structure, it presents the appear- 
ance of a huge cylindrical terra-cotta vessel let into the earth. There 
is some indication of the action of fire in hardening the walls. To 
Briar Creek, and esjjecially to this neighborhood, did the Creek Indians 
resort to fish and hunt. The adjacent bluff's and fields give token to 
the present day of former and long-continued occupancy. Village sites 
may still be seen littered with fragments of earthen vessels, flint chips, 
spear and arrow points, grooved axes, scrapers, and other objects of 
primitive manufacture. Even now this stream abounds in fishes, tui’- 
tles, and alligators, and the swamp, at an early period, was filled with 
deer, wild turkeys, and other game held in repute by the natives. 

Doubtless, during the use of this receptacle, it was furnished with a 
roof or covering which long since perished. It is probable that in it 
were stored, from time to time, the fishes caught by visiting Indians. 
These, having been previously dried, there accumulated until the sea- 
son arrived for the homeward journey, where they were removed and 
transported to the permanent lodges of their captors. It is hoped that 
care will be exercised in the preservation of this interesting object.

SHELL HEAPS AND MOUNDS IN FLOEIDA. 

By James Shepard, of Kmv Britain, Conn. 

In February, 1884, in company with Dr. F. H. Williams, of Bristol, 
Conn,, I visited Palatka. Many walks about the town were covered 
with small snail shells which were gathered from large deposits in that 
vicinity. It was a common belief that these were marine shells; and 
frequent was the inquiry why the Indians brought these shells from 
the distant sea. The answer is, “ They did not,” for the shells are mostly, 
those of the river snail, Vivipara conteetoides (Biuney). Several of 
whom I inquired thought that like specimens of live shells could not 
be found near Palatka. In this opinion they are probably mistaken. 
On being informed that there was a shell heap on the Saint John’s Eiver 
a few miles below Palatka, four of us started out the next morning to 
explore the land in that vicinity. Late in the afternoon one of our 
party discovered a shell heap. It was on low ground, in the woods or 
hummock, probably not far from the Saint John’s Eiver, although the 
river was not visible. It was literally a heap, quite irregular in form, 
covering three or four square rods of ground and varying in depth from 
2 to 5 feet. It was just such a heap as one would expect a pile of debris 
to be. There were no indications that any shells had been removed or 
that the heap had ever been dug into. On the surface the shells were 
but little broken, and the entire heap appeared to be composed of two 
kinds of shells, the Pomus depressa (Say) and Vivipara conteetoides 
(Binney). By digging below the surface, pieces of river mussels or 
JJnios were found, very much decomposed and covering the other shells 
with a nacreous paste. Bones of small animals and birds and flint chips 
were numerous, with many pieces of pottery and an occasional arrow- 
head. There were only a few shells in the entire heap of any genera 
other than the Pomm, Vivipara., and Unio. 

On sailing up the Saint John’s Eiver we saw several shell heaps on 
the banks of the river apparently of the same general character, only 
some of them were much more extensive. We stopped only at Sanford, 
and there found a shell heap a mile or two below the steamboat land- 
ing. This was much larger than the Palatka mound and spread irregu- 
larly over the ground. Shells had been carted away from here and 
the heap dug into in many places by relic hunters. All of the shells 
were of the same three kinds, Pomus, Vivipara, and Unio. The shells 
at the surface were very much crushed, indicating that they had been 
much trodden on. Many pieces of pottery were scattered about over 
the surface, and others were found by digging. Arrowheads and flint 
chips were infrequent. In some places indications of ancient flres were 
found, the shells being burned and firmly cemented together. Below 
the layer of cemented shells and ashes the shells were found in a 
remarkable degree of preservation, some of the Vivipara showing the

four bright brown bands about the body- whorl quite as distinctly as in 
the day when they were taken from' the water. Others seemed to have 
changed their substance, and were white and glossy with a porcelanous 
appearance. Here, too, we found a lump of hardened red paint. 
Some pieces of pottery were perfectly plain, while others were orna- 
mented in various patterns both by scratching and by depressions. 
Some of the checkered ornamentations seemed to have been made by 
repeated impressions with a stamp, such as would be produced by 
making channels in a flat surface at regular distances apart and at 
right angles to each other, and then, in using the stamp, turning it 
between each two impressions so as to make the lines in one depression 
stand obliquely to those of the adjoining one. At the junction of two 
such depressions the overlapping or intermingled lines were plainly 
visible. One piece was ornamented by straight parallel depressions, 
and then, after the depressing implement was withdrawn and while the 
clay was yet soft, other depressions were made transversely to the first 
ones, but not so deep, the ribs between the first depressions being 
flattened down on the cross-lines and partially filling the first depressions. 
One piece was found of such an arc, that supposing it was from a round 
vessel the diameter of said vessel was 29 inches. 

Near this shell heap were two mounds of symmetrical shape, formed 
mostly of earth, but partly from shells like those in the heap. The 
earth was the same as the surrounding soil. These had been dug into 
considerably, and on digging farther into one of the boles we found the 
leg and foot bones of a human skeleton, but no implements or orna- 
ments. 

In returning we found by a ditch on the flats of the St. John’s Eiver, 
a smaller shell heap of fresh shells, but not thick enough to cover the 
ground. The shells were identically of the same three kinds. The fresh 
operculum lying by these shells showed that they had recently been taken 
alive, and that their meat had been picked out by some small animal. 

The long-billed curlew [Numenius longirostris) is said to eat the live ani 
mal from these shells. These shells were of great interest to me for they 
put atrestall speculation as to where the Indians obtained their supply 
of food, of which the shell heaps are the refuse, and proved to my mind 
that they took their shell-fish from the river whose bank they have lined 
with shell heaps, and also that the same species of mollusks are living 
there to-day. Undoubtedly this fact has been noted and published be- 
fore, but there are many who still believe that the shell heaps of the 
St. John’s Eiver are composed of marine shells. When we consider the 
resemblance of the Pomus to the Natiea, it is not strange that such opin- 
ions may be formed by a cursory observer. 

Our next stop was at Tampa, Hillsborough County, and our first excur- 
sion was to Eocky Point, Old Tampa Bay, about 5 or 6 miles westerly 
from Tampa, near where the salt works were located during the civil 
war. Here was a large mound of marine shells situated at the base of

the point and extending entirely across, it. Oyster shells formed the 
major part of the pile. Several holes had been dug into the surface 
which, with the general appearance of the place, indicated that it had 
frequently been visited. The rocks of which the point is mainly formed 
and from which the point was named, consists of fossil coral. The ma- 
terial for many of the rough implements found in this vicinity evidently 
came from this point. 

Most of the surface specimens yielded by this heap were found at or 
near the base of the slanting sides of the pile. In addition to arrow- 
heads, scrapers and rough-shaped implements of quartz, we found 
pottery and quite a variety of shell and bone implements, the latter 
being entirely new to us. Among these were several c-elts quite similar 
to those illustrated in “ The Archaeological Collection,” p. 67, figs. 254 
and 255, also chisels, gouges, pendants, and beads made from the colu- 
mella of large shells, and smaller chisels made from bone, besides other 
rough pieces which we suppose were implements of some kind. One 
piece of pottery was ornamented with impressions of a long spiral shell 
of the genera Ceritlium. Nearby we found large numbers of live speci- 
mens of this shell, some of which quite closely fitted the depressions in 
this piece of pottery. 

On the land of Colonel Culbreath, about 2 miles from Tampa, and on 
the shore of Old Tampa Bay, is what is termed a “ shell hummock.” 
It is cultivated as an orange grove and a market garden. It was i)rob- 
ably once an immense shell heap, but now it is scattered over several 
acres. A little to one side of the center of the lot the ground is slightly 
elevated and nearly or quite half of the surface material is shell. From 
this point the shells are less numerous, as they are spread out in all di- 
rections, growing gradually less until the soil is free from them. Here 
we found an abundance of quartz implements and worked pieces of ill- 
shaped forms, that might or might not have been intended for im])le- 
ments. Others were of fossil coral limestone, like the coral at Eocky 
Point farther uij the bay. Some pieces of the quartz and coral were 
nearly spherical, the whole (in some cases only a part) of the surface 
having been formed by chipping. Perhaps, in the absence of natural 
pebbles in this section, these had been worked out for use as a substi- 
tute ; perhaps to use as club heads, incased with rawhide. We found 
rough and somewhat rounded pieces of fossil coral with pit holes on 
opposite sides, and a single piece of soapstone, about one and a half inch 
in diameter by half an inch thick, but its surface was not worked suf- 
ficiently to show its use. I refer to it only because it is a material which 
has not to my knowledge ever been found in nature within several hxm- 
dred miles of South Florida. 

Of shell and bone implements we found all the kinds collected at 
Eocky Point, celts, gouges, pendants, beads, and also the columella of 
small conchs, worked into small round shafts pointed at each end. 
Some of the columella of the larger conchs were worked to a point on 
one end. There were triangular and other shaped pieces of the shells

of the common hard-shell clam worked to a sharp edge on all sides. 
One spoon was made from the umbo of one of these clam shells, another 
from the outer whorl of some large conch. We also found beads made 
from the Oliva Uterata, as illustrated by fig. 260, p. 69, “ The Archaeo- 
logical Collection,” and large couch shells, perforated and worked to 
form club heads. Some were minus the hole in posterior surface of the 
spire, but were otherwise exactly like those described by Dr. Eau on 
page 66 of said book. A friend of mine has a similar supposed club 
head from South l^^lorida, consisting of a like conch shell worked in the 
same manner at the small end and perforated by two holes in the outer 
wall, but without the notch in the outer lip, so that the handle passed 
to the right of the columella instead of at the lefr. The necklace or 
bead couchs having two holes and truncated at the apex like fig. 257, 
p. 69, we also Ibund, and it was the first time our attention had ever been 
called to them. We wondered if they might have been toy club heads 
for children, but Dr. Eau’s book informed us otherwise. In most of 
these shells the perforations have been so formed that when strung and 
disposed about a person’s neck or chest, the lips and the most brightly 
colored parts of the shell would be exposed to view. One small disk 
from a hard clam shell having ragged edges and a beveled perforation 
in the center was found. The hole was almost identical with those 
made by boring worms and shells, and one person who saw it was con- 
fident that this was only an accidentally broken piece having such a 
worm-bored hole. Upon having his attention called to the fact that 
the bevel was at the inner surface of the shell, he was willing to accredit 
the supposed work of a worm to an Indian. I mention this to show the 
importance of close observation and how a very little thing may often 
decide a question. A workman in the field informed us that he often 
plowed out parts of shells that had been engraved. We visited the 
hummock several times but found nothing of the kind. At last the 
workman found one and showed me. It was nothing but a plain un- 
worked columella with the outer whorls broken off irndesignedly. He 
had mistaken the natural spiral lines for carvings. This is about as 
reliable as the information one can get from those who have never paid 
special attention to archaeological specimens. Fragments of pottery of 
various patterns were abundant here. The shells were all marine shells 
excepting such land shells as had probably found their own way to that 
place. 

By Hillsboro’ Bay, at the mouth of the Alifia Eiver, several miles be 
low Tampa, is a shell heap called “ Bull Prog Mound,” so named from 
the fancied resemblance of its shape to a bull frog when viewed from 
the water in sailing up the bay. This is by far the most extensive shell 
heap of any that we visited. It is formed of two mound-shape piles at 
considerable distance apart, while all the ground between these piles 
is covered with shells to the depth of several feet. The larger pile is 
reported to be 60 feet high and stands close to the river ; in fact the 
shells extend well down into the river as if filled in beyond the original

bank, so that the mound itself, at this point, now forms the river bank. 
A large oak tree stands at the very summit of the mound. The lesser 
pile has been considerably reduced by burning the shells for lime. In 
front of the mound, looking towards the bay, is a point consisting of a 
flat salt marsh covered with rushes. The mound is composed largely 
of oyster shells and appears to have been frequently visited of late. 
Eelics were scarce, and those we did find were of the same class as we 
had found before. The only relics which could be found here in num- 
bers were the small perforated and truncated conchs for necklaces or 
beads. 

Bordering on the city limits of Tampa, Hillsboro’ Bay, and the mouth 
of Hillsboro’ Eiver, is the garrison called “ Fort Brooke.” Here are two 
ancient earth mounds which have been dug into considerably, but we 
could not learn that anything of special value had ever been found. On 
the ground about the mounds we found bits of pottery, flint chips, a 
few arrow heads and rough implements. I here found a genuine quartz 
pebble, about 2 inches in diameter, round and flat, with its edges 
broken a little on two opposite sides. This was the only specimen of a 
pebble that I saw in Florida, and I pronounced it a foreigner. 

All of the marine shells which we saw at these South Florida shell 
heaps corresponded with the live species now inhabiting the waters of 
that section. All of the stone implements or fragments, except the 
piece of soap-stone and quartz pebble before noted, corresponded with 
the limestone, or the lime fossil coral, or the silicified corals, &c., of that 
region, the latter, so far as I know, being found only in Hillsboro’ Bay, 
and mostly at Ballast Point, about 5 miles below Tampa. In fact all 
of the arrow heads from South Florida that I have observed appear to 
have been made of material obtained at or near Ballast Point. Here 
are many silicified geodes, both large and small, some having an outer 
surface that shows a coral formation, while the inner surface is of vari 
ous bright colors of chalcedony or drusy quartz. Here also are pieces of 
cherty flint of considerable size, which, when they have not been i>revi 
ously broken, are coated with limestone. The beach at low tide is lit 
erally covered with quartz that has been artificially broken. Many ap 
parently unfinished implements are found, and also occasionally finished 
arrow heads, scrapers, &c. Arrow and spear heads were made from 
the thin flattish sides of geodes, so that the work was much more haz- 
ardous than making them from thicker stock. Cavities were numerous 
even in the best material found here, and presumably for that reason 
unfinished implements are very numerous in this vicinity. While in 
many places the beach abounds in stone, I have never known of any 
having been found, in nature, upon the inland surface. 

A little back from the beach at Ballast Point is a long ridge of shells, 
much broken, as if washed up by the tide. There are, however (the 
facts before noted), plenty of evidences that this was ground formerly 
frequented by the Indians, and many believe this ridge of shells to be 
the remains of an Indian shell heap.

ANCIENT EAETH- WORKS IN CHINA. 

By Mark Wiixiams, of Ealgan, China. 

From Kalgan to Tucho are ancient mounds in cluster on the plain or 
singly on eminences. These latter would indicate signal towers, while 
the former would suggest tombs. They are about 30 feet high, circular 
and oval in shape, and no arrangement can be observed in the clusters. 

At the base of a signal mound by the great wall of Kalgan I found 
a stone ax. 

The Chinese give no rational explanation of these mounds. I have 
as yet found no mention of them in ancient records. At Yucho, 100 miles 
south of Kalgan, is a cluster of forty mounds ; 4 miles off are ruins of a 
city wall. Chinese cities have rectangular walls, with towers at short 
intervals. But this is a circular embankment with no remains of towers. 
The part of the remaining entrance is unlike the gate of a Chinese city. 
Eecords state that this was the seat of a Chinese prince who lived B, C. 
200. In some places the wall is levelled, in other places it is perfect, 
making an acute angle at the summit. Cultivation has narrowed the 
bases of the mounds, but superstition prevents their destruction. To 
one familiar with the works of the mound builders in the Mississippi 
Valley, the stone ax, the mounds, circular wall, suggest a similar race. 


PLAN FOR AMERICAN ETHNOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 

By the late Henry E. Schoolcraft. 

[The following programme, though never officially adopted by the 
Smithsonian Institution, embodies the result of much study of the sub- 
ject by the distinguished author ; and even after the lapse of forty years 
possesses sufficient interest and suggestiveness to justify its publica- 
tion.] 

“ Plan for the investigation of American ethnology, to include the facts 
derived from other parts of the globe, and the eventual formation of a mu- 
seum of antiquities and the peculiar fabrics of nations ; and also the collec- 
tion of a library of the philology of the world, manuscript and printed. 
Submitted to the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, at their 
first meeting, at Washington, in September, 1846.” 

New York, August 22, 1846. 

Gentlemen: Inlaying before you the following suggestions, I am 
governed by the opinion that there is a means of investigation of the 
subject proposed, which possesses general interest as a branch of human 
knowledge, and cannot but be invested with peculiar force to men of 
letters dwelling on the western continent. The origin, dispersion, and 


908 PAPERS RELATING TO ANTHROPOLOGY. 

affinities of nations, and their transference from the eastern to the 
western hemisphere, prior to the period of Columbus, have constituted 
subjects of interesting inquiry from the time of the discovery. And 
viewed in the lights which are now presented by the progress of eth- 
nography, modern geographical discovery, and other means of advanc- 
ing the study of nations, the inquiry may be supposed to be one which 
the mind of Mr. Smithson had embraced in his enlarged conception of 
promoting “the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.” 

The occupation of the continent itself by men diverse — in their phys- 
ical and mental traits and their languages, from the various races of 
its discoverers at and after 1492 ; separated as that continent is, by 
seas and open straits, from other parts of the globe, constitutes an inter- 
esting and unsolved problem. And its solution is still more interesting 
when we reflect that these native races had no maritime skill adequate 
to the construction of ships ; that the state of arts, if we make some 
local exceptions, was very low; that they were without letters or litera- 
ture; and, when questioned as to their origin, they put forth traditions 
which were generally better suited to engage the imagination than to 
satisfy the judgment. 

The extent and noble proportions of the continent, stretching for 
thousands of miles along the Atlantic, and forming a vast and mount- 
ainous barrier between it and the Pacific, entitled it in more than one 
sense to the appellation it received by every succeeding navigator of 
the New World. It was indeed a new world, not less in its grand 
physical structure than for the races of man, who roved over rather 
than inhabited it. And these latter races, now that 354 years have 
passed, are quite as much a problem to historians and philosophers, in 
respect to their early connection and national affinities with the races of 
Asia, Africa, and Europe, as they were then. - 

But when we examine this continent in all its sweeping latitudes and 
longitudes, in its highest altitudes, and in its lowest and broadest val- 
leys, we find imbedded in its very geological strata, as well as in its 
surface, ruins and other evidences that it had been inhabited long an- 
terior to the Indian race, — that there had been people of diverse arts 
and habits upon its plains and estuaries. And that, of the red race 
itself, there are evidences of mutations and changes, reaching from mere 
sachemships to rude colossal empires, which, like that of Montezuma, 
broke down, in fact, under the glittering and disproportioned weight of 
their inherent corruptions and barbarisms. 

Forts, mounds, ditches, and works of art, pottery with the triune 
emblem of the philosophy of Zoroaster, mummies wrapped in their half 
Nilotic cerements, vast pyramidal structures of earth and of stone, pal- 
aces and ruined cities, are among the objects of its antiquarian and his- 
torical interest. Not only from the romantic and sublime lake of Titi- 
caca, and the fire-crowned peaks of the valley of Mexico, do we perceive 
centers of population, rushing out to rule and conquer, but from the yet

unexplored plains of the Eio Gila and the Colorado of California, from 
the broad valley of the Mississippi, from the southern slopes of the Ap- 
palachian range of the South Atlantic, and even from the colder lati- 
tudes of the Great Lakes, where the indomitable Iroquois built up their 
republic, we behold a concurring series of facts and discoveries which 
prove incontestably that various races of the wide-spread and original 
family of man have lived, and cultivated, and warred, and died at these 
localities. 

When we come to apply to these vestiges of ancient structure the 
scrutiny of exact observation and description, and to view the facts 
under the lights of induction and historical analysis, we elicit several 
classes of evidence which tend to restore important links in the history 
of the original dispersion of our species, advance us in the scale of knowl- 
edge, and go far to enable us to appreciate and understand our position 
on the globe. And in proportion as this investigation is pressed, in 
proportion as scieuce is applied to it, and the current of investigation 
deepened, we abstract from the boundaries of mystery and conjecture, 
and add to these of ascertained facts and history. We thus progress 
indeed in knowledge, and compass one of the noblest ends of being. 

It is in this light Miat ethnology makes its appeal to modern letters ; 
and I beg leave to bring its claim to your early consideration. It is 
proposed to consider ethnology in the most enlarged sense of which the 
etymology of the word admits as embracing man in his divisions into 
nations ; their affinities and characteristics, mental and physical, with 
such x)roofs deduced from history, philology, antiquities, and the exact 
sciences, as may serve to link nation to nation, and race to race. In 
this study particular reference is designed to be had to the position of 
the American continent, and to the aboriginal races found upon it, when 
first discovered by Europeans. In this view, it will embrace not only 
geography, antiquities, and history, as descriptive seiences, but likewise 
the early history of arts, ethnography, comparative philology, geology, 
and jjhysiology, and such other collateral sciences as may be found nec- 
essary to investigate, illustrate, and explain the subject. 

The mode of advancing the subject, and carrying into effect the in- 
quiry, so as best to bring out the facts for general information, may 
admit of some diversity of opinion. It is not an inquiry which admits 
of extempore results. To consider diligently the various parts of the 
continent which furnish aliment for the investigation, to scrutinize and 
collate what has been discovered and written, to collect from mounds 
and other sources, in various parts of the world, specimens of ancient 
art, and above all to embody the present and past philology of tribes 
and nations, is a labor requiring time and attention. Much of this, 
when acquired, is hardly of a character to sustain popular lectures. It 
may be doubted, indeed, whether in offering researches in a verbal form 
they are not always in danger of suffering from the hands of theory and 
rhetoric. Still, it is a question whether condensed statements of parts 


910 


PAPERS RELATING TO ANTHROPOLOGY. 


of the inquiry may not thus occasionally be thrown out. But whether 
so or not, the inquiries should be printed at a press owned and con- 
trolled by the board, and in a form to correspond with the general style 
and plan of their publications. In what manner compensations should 
be awarded, and whether by a temporary appointment or a fixed pro- 
fessorship, having a residence at the parent Institution, and the benefit 
of its library and collections, in the various departments, may admit of 
consideration. One remark may however be confidently added, that 
without adequate provision for the time, books, and travel incident to 
the inquiry, no person can be expected to enter upon effective labor in 
this field.

In reference to all the objects, it is essential to compare the several 
American nations one witn another, and with the leading nations of 
other parts of the globe. In proceeding to explore the subject, the first 
labor must be that of accumulating facts. Visits to the several objects 
of antiquarian interest demanding attention, with proper instruments 
for observation, are required. Field surveys of ruins, and drawings of 
all important objects to be commented on, are essential. Care must 
be taken to notice whether there be more than one era of occupancy, 
or one type of nationality, denoted hy the same locality. And with 
the same view the different ages and relative position of the different 
geological formations, embracing ruins, or objects of art, should be care- 
fully noted. Fossil bones of extinct or ancient species of animals, and 
beds or banks of shells of the Eocene or Pliocene deposits, furnish the 
character of evidence denoting separate epochs of occupancy, and be- 
come invested with new interest. Traces of organic life of the higher 
species have been found deeper down in the geological column, in later 
days, than were known to the elder geologists, and the vestiges of man 
should be carefully sought in all the unconsolidated strata. We know 
the globe has been disturbed since its creation and destruction, and we 
should be prepared to find physical evidences of it. Not only architect-

913 


nre, bat metallurgy, pottery, sculpture, and drawing should be inter- 
rogated, in examining their remains, on American soil. Inscriptions 
on rocks are of value, as antiquarian proofs, as well as all traces of the 
ancient method of symbol or picture writing. 

But whatever degree of care is evinced by personal inspection, it is 
essential to the purposes of comparison that a full and complete collec- 
tion of antiquarian objects, and the characteristic fabrics of nations, 
existing and ancient, should be formed and deposited in the Institution. 
By adding to this, from time to time, such implements of art or war, 
articles of costume, or other objects of curiosity, as might be obtained, 
there would be formed, in the end, a museum of mankind, wherein each 
tribe and nation would be characteristically represented. Such a mu- 
seum wmuld, in itself, be a desideratum.* 

Nothing is more characteristic of the intellectual existence of man 
than language. It is found to be a more enduring monument of ancient 
affinities than the physical type, and there is no tribe howmver situated 
from whom this proof of affiliation should not be obtained. By collect- 
ing a vocabulary and grammar of every known tongue, from printed 
and verbal sources, the Institution would present to the world a library 
of philology which would cause its site to be resorted to from the re- 
motest quarters. In the United States and British North America 
alone we have at least sixty -four dialects and languages.t Nor should 
the mythology of rude nations be neglected. It is the frame-work of 
their philosophy and their religion, and gives character to their songs 
and poetry and every form of intellectual excitement. 

Finally, both the duty of observation in the field, and the examina- 
tion of facts and evidences in the cabinet or library, may be commenced 
immediately, and need not be delayed until the contemplated buildings 
are completed, and other parts of the library, &c., perfected. Time is 
essential in making preliminary examinations. The consideration of the 
country may be taken uj) in a separate and systematic manner, taking 
valley by valley, or State by State. Some portions of the land are more 
prominent in their claims to notice than others; but in all over which 
the tide of modern emigration sets, the evidences of its former occupa- 
tion are rapidly disappearing. The same may be said of the Bed Face, 
whose language and customs it is wished to preserve. The earlier the 
labor is done, the more easy will be its execution. In the Mississippi 
Valley alone, where so many evidences of the earliest and heaviest 
ancient population exist, but a few years will place the most important 
facts beyond our reach. By adopting the plan suggested, or some plan 
of this nature, we shall rescue from the oblivion of past generations 
matter for thought and reflection for the future. As fast as the infor-

INDEX TO THE LITERATURE OF URANIUM, 

1789 - 1885 . 


By H. Caebington Bolton. 


PEEFACE.* 

“ Index-learning turns no student pale, 

Yet holds the eel of science by the tail.” 

Dunciad, I, 279. 

When engaged in researches on the compounds of uranium, nearly 
twenty years ago, the writer compiled for his convenience an index to the 
literature of the element and of its principal compounds. At the sugges- 
tion of several friends who thought the compilation ought to be placed at 
the disposal of chemists, the manuscript was extended and printed in the 
Annals of the New York Lyceum of Natural History (Vol. ix, Feb., 
1870). As published, the index was far from complete ; but the simple 
plan adopted, a chronological arrangement of authorities and references, 
with brief notes of the subject-matter, seems to have commended itself 
to chemists, for the Index to the Literature of Uranium was followed 
by several others similarly arranged. A list of these will be found at 
the close of this preface. 

Impressed by the great importance of index-making, in 1882 the 
writer proposed to the Chemical Section of the American Association 
for the Advancement of Science, at the Montreal meeting, the formation 
of a committee to encourage chemists in a scheme of co-operative in- 
dexing briefly outlined at the time. The Chemical Section kindly ap- 
proved the proposal, and a committee was appointed to “ devise and in- 
augurate a plan for the proper indexing of the literature of the chemical 
elements.” This committee reported in August, 1883, that it had con- 
sidered three methods of collecting material for the indexes, viz : 

1. Eeviewing the Catalogue of Scientific Papers published by the 
Royal Society. (8 vols. 4to.) 

2. Indexing special journals by different individuals and collating 
the matter. 

3. The independent plan, whereby each chemist indexes all the jour- 
nals accessible to him with reference to a given element, in which he is 
presumably especially interested.

916 INDEX TO THE LITERATDEE OF URANIUM, 1789-1885. 

Each of these schemes is open to objections and fraught with difficul 
ties that need not be named. On the whole, the third plan seemed to a 
majority of the committee the only feasible one for the present. The 
report also considers the best arrangement of material, and three ways 
are suggested: (1) chronologically; (2) alphabetically by authors ; (3) 
topically. The committee do not venture to dictate to volunteer and 
independent workers, but recommend the chronological arrangement, 
accompanied by a topical index. 

In September, 1884, the committee further reported that several 
indexes had been published during the twelve months intervening, and 
that more were in progress. They also announced that the Smithsonian 
Institution had consented to publish indexes to chemical literature 
indorsed by the committee, limiting somewhat the number of pages 
per annum. The Smithsonian Institution also distributes, free of 
expense, the circulars and publications of the committee. 

The following work is offered as an additional contribution to the series 
of indexes named below. It is, strictly speaking, a second edition of 
that published in 1870, but much new matter has been added and new 
features introduced, so that in reality it forms an entirely new work. 
The edition of 1870 contains 522 references to papers by 150 authors ; 
the present index contains 1,330 references to papers by more than 300 
authorities. New matter has been incorporated with that of the first 
edition, and the whole has been brought down to the close of 1885, cov- 
ering a period of sixteen years of much activity. In each paragraph 
the first reference following the name of an author is that of the original 
publication of the paper in question; the succeeding references are those 
of reprints or abstracts of the original, 

In accordance with the suggestion of the index committee, two indexes 
have been added — an alphabetical index of authors and a classified in 
dex of subjects. These, it is believed, will materially increase the utility 
of the work. The scheme of classification adopted for the subject index 
is by no means an ideal one. It is not intended to serve as a model for 
others, but it is deemed the most satisfactory attainable with the material 
in hand. Knowing, moreover, that as a rule classification schemes are 
intelligible only to their authors, we have added a synopsis of the clas- 
sification to serve as a key. In using the author and subject indexes, 
it must be remembered that they refer to the items in the chronological 
index, and that the contents of each paper are not completely indexed. 
Finally, the list of abbreviations will remove doubts as to the journals 
quoted, and will show at the same time what sets have been thoroughly 
examined.
