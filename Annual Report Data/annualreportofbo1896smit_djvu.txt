UPON 

THE CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM 
DURING THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 3U, 1896. 

B*Y 

G. Brown Goode, 
Assistant Secretary, Smithsonian Institution, in charge of U. S. National Museum. 



I.— GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. 

By act of Congress passed in 1846 the Smithsonian Institution became 
the only lawful place of deposit for "all objects of art and of foreign 
and curious research, and all objects of natural history, plants, and 
geological and mineralogical specimens belonging to the United States." 
These collections have served as a nucleus for the National Museum 
of the United States. For many years this Museum was supported 
entirely at the expense of the Smithson fund, and a considerable por- 
tion of the collections is the property of the Institution through gift or 
purchase. 

A "museum" has been defined by Professor Huxley as "a consulta- 
tive library of objects." Not only is the National Museum such a con- 
sultative library, but it is an agency for the instruction of the people 
of the whole country. It keeps in mind the needs of those whose lives 
are not occupied in the study of science, as well as of the teacher and 
the skilled investigator. Its benefits are extended without cost or 
reserve to hundreds of thousands of visitors from all jiarts of the 
United States who enter its halls every year, and through the distribu- 
tion of the duplicate specimens in the Museum, made up into sets and 
accurately named, to public institutions in all parts of the country. 

A. — Origin and Development of the Museum. 

The history of the origin and development of the Museum has been 
detailed in j)revious reports, and was made the special subject of a 
paper entitled " The Genesis of the National Museum." ' For our pres- 



'"The Genesis of the National Museum," Report of the Smithsonian Institution 
(U. S. National Museum), 1891, pp. 273-330. 



4 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

ent purpose it will suffice to repeat a few of the most essential facts as 

The formation of a national museum in the city of Washington was 
first undertaken by a society organized in 1840, called "The National 
Institution," and afterwards "The National Institute," which was for 
four years exceedingly prosperous and active. The nucleus for a 
national nniseum was gathered by this society in the Patent Office 
building in Washington, and public opinion was educated to consider 
the establishment of such an institution worthy of the attention of the 
Government of the United States. In 1846, having failed in securing 
the public recognition at which it aimed, the society became inactive, 
and eventually, in 1861, passed out of existence. In the meantime the 
Smithsonian Institution had been organized, but from 1844 until 1858, 
when the so called "National Cabinet of Curiosities" passed into the 
charge of the Smithsonian Institution, the term "National Museum" 
was not in use. From that time onward it was used, unofficially, to 
designate the collections in the Smithsonian building. 

In January, 1847, the first Board of Regents of the Smithsonian 
Institution, after many weeks of consultation and deliberation over the 
plans for organization, unanimously voted the following resolution : 

Resolved, 'I'hat it is the intention of the act of Con,ii,res8, and in accordance with 
the design of Mr. Suiithson, as expressed in his will, that one of the principal modes 
of executing the act and the trust is the accumulation of collections of specimens 
and objects of natural history and of elegant art, and the gradual formation of a 
library of valuable works pertaining to all departments of human knowledge, to the 
end that a copious storehouse of materials of science, literature, and art may be pro- 
vided, which shall excite and diffuse the love of learning among men, and shall 
assist the original investigations and efforts of those who may devote themselves to 
the pursuit of any branch of knowledge.' 

After the "national cabinet" had been delivered to the Regents, 
annual appropriations were made by Congress for its maintenance. 
During the twenty-three years which followed, the collections were 
greatly increased and were made the basis of numerous important 
memoirs upon the natural history and ethnology of America. The 
public halls, with their arrangements for the exhibition of a portion of 
tlie collection, also received a due share of attention, and a certain 
amount of instruction and pleasure was aftbrded to visitors. The 
ai)proi)riations, however, were meager, the space limited, and the staff 
was so inadetpiate that little could be done except to keep the collec- 
tions in good 1 (reservation. 

The broad i)lan upon which the operations of the National Museum 
are now conducted was anticipated as early as 1853, when Professor 
Henry wrote : 

There can be little doubt that in due time ample provision will be made for a 
library and museum at the capital ..f this Union worthy of a Government whose 
perpetuity depends upon the virtue and intelligence of the people. ^

^Report of the Smithsonian Institution, 1853, p. 245. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 5 

The difficulties attending the formation of such a museum were 
appreciated by him, and in his report for 1849 he spoke with much 
emphasis of the difficulties attending the assumption by the Institution 
of the care of the national collections, and in the Report of the Institu- 
tion for 1870 ' he again carefully expressed his opinion as to the aims 
proper to such a museum. 

" There is [he wrote] scarcely any subject connected with science and 
education to which more attention is given at the present day than 
that of collections of objects of nature and art known under the gen- 
eral denominations of museums. This arises from their growing impor- 
tance as aids to scientific investigation and instruction." 

In the Eeport for 1873^ allusion was made to. the increase in the 
national collections, even then very great, " requiring the utmost exer- 
tions of the limited force connected with the National Museum for its 
proper treatment." 

Although the appropriations for the Museum have of late years been 
more liberal, it is certain that, on account of the immense annual 
increase in the quantity of material received, quite as much caution as 
ever is needed in the development of its plans for the future. 

The Smithsonian Institution, from its foundation, fostered explora- 
tions, and its museum was enriclied by the numerous ethnological 
and natural history objects brought home by the explorers. Many 
gifts were received from private sources, and valuable objects were 
deposited in its museum for safekeeping. The nucleus of its collec- 
tions was a small but valuable cabinet of minerals formed by the 
founder, James Smithson, who was himself a chemist and mineralogist 
of high repute, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. 

At the time of the establishment of the Institution several naval 
expeditions and surveys of the public domain were being organized by 
the Government, and during tlieir progress large collections of ethno- 
logical and natural history objects were made. Important foreign 
material was obtained by the Pacific Exploring Expedition, Perry's 
Expedition to Japan, and other naval expeditions, while the naturalists 
attached to the Pacific Railroad Survey, the Mexican Boundary Sur- 
vey, and the surveys under the Army Engineer Corps brought together 
great collections illustrating the natural resources and ethnology of 
North America. 

A new source of growth, subsequent to 1871, was the exploration of 
the waters of North America by the United States Fish Commission, 
The great collections of all forms of aquatic life made by the Commission 
found their way gradually into the National Museum, to be placed beside 
the collections of other bureaus of the Government engaged in scientific 
work. 

At the close of the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 the exhibits of the 
United States Government and thoseof numerous foreign governments 
and of private exhibitors came to the National Museum.

6 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

A new perioil now began. The storage rooms and exhibition halls of 
the Smithsonian bnilding were already overflowing with the accumula- 
tions of thirty years, and the small number of persons employed in caring 
for them were overburdened and unable properly to perform the requi- 
site work. The limits of the collections had become wider, and a new 
and broader classiti cation was found to be necessary. The growth of 
the country in wealth and culture had led to the establishment of many 
local museums, and the educational influences flowing from these and 
from the Centennial Exhibition caused a demand for more efficient 
niethods of museum administration. The exhibition of 187G had been 
indeed an event of great educational importance to the people of the 
Tnited States; and not the least of its good works was the lesson it 
taught as to the possibilities for good in public museums. 

The objects which at the close of the Centennial Exhibition were 
given to the United States for its National Musem were of large intrin- 
sic value, and were also very important from the fact that the necessity 
of caring for them led to the erection of a large building for the expan- 
sion of the Museum itself. 

In the early years Professor Baird, then assistant secretary of the 
Institution, with two or three assistants, had been able to give all nec- 
essary attention to the care of the collections, and the Museum had 
never been formally divided into departments. When the reorganiza- 
tion was made In 1881, under the immediate care of the present assist- 
ant secretary, the diversity of the collections made it necessary to 
establish a number of departments, each of which was placed in charge 
of a curator. 

There are now twenty eight organized departments and sections in 
the Museum, the larger number of which are in charge of specialists 
who receive no salary from the Museum. There are also seven admin- 
istrative offices. 

SPECIAL EPOCHS IN THE HISTORY OF THE MUSEUM. 

The history of the National Museum may be divided into three 
periods: 

First, the period from the foundation of the Smithsonian Institution 
to 1857, during which time specimens were collected solely to serve as 
materials for research. No special effort was made to exhibit them to 
tlie public or to utilize them, except as a foundation for scientific 
description and theory. 

Second, the period from 1857, when the Institution assumed the cus- 
tody of the "National Cabinet of Curiosities," to 1876. During this 
period the Museum became a place of deposit for scientific collections 
which had already been studied, these collections, so far as convenient, 
being exhibited to the public and, so far as practicable, made to serve 
an educational purpose. 

Third, the present period (beginning in the year 187G), in which the 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 7 

Museum lias undertaken more fully tbe additional task of gathering 
collections and exhibiting them on account of their value from an 
educational standpoint. 

During the first period the main object of the Museum was scien- 
tific research ; in the second, the establishment became a museum of 
record as well as of research; while in the third period has been added 
the idea of public education. The three ideas — record, research, and 
educatioD — cooperative aud mutually helpful as they are, are essential 
to the development of every great museum. The National Museum 
endeavors to promote them all. 

It is a museum of record^ in which are preserved the material founda- 
tions of an enormous amount of scientific knowledge — the types of 
numerous past investigations. This is especially the case with those 
materials that hsSwe served as a foundation for the reports upon the 
resources of the United States. 

It is a museum of research, which aims to make its contents serve in 
the highest degree as a stimulus to inquiry and a foundation for scien- 
tific investigation. Research is necessary in order to identify and group 
the objects in the most j)hilosophical and instructive relations, and its 
officers are therefore selected for their ability as investigators as well 
as for their trustworthiness as custodians. 

It is an educational museum, through its policy of illustrating by 
specimens every kind of natural object and every manifestation of 
human thought and activity, of displaying descriptive labels adapted 
to the popular mind, and of distributing its publications and its named 
series of duplicates. 

In conclusion let us review what seems to have been definitely accom- 
plished since the time of reorganization in 1881. 

The definite steps of progress may be summarized as follows: 

(1) An organization of the Museum staft' has been effected, efficient 
for present purposes and capable of expansion and extension as occa- 
sion may require, and many capable museum experts have been trained 
for work in other institutions. 

(2) Through the agency of the staff the materials in the Museum, 
fhe accumulations of nearly half a century, have been examined, clas- 
sified, and brought under control aud arranged in such manner as to 
insure their sefety and make them available for study. 

(3) The collections have been increased eighteenfold. 

(4) A considerable beginning has been made toward the development 
of a well-labeled and eflectually installed exhibition series, available 
for the instruction of the public. 

(5) A thorough study of the organization and systems of classifica- 
tion in other museums throughout the world has been made, the results 
of which are beginning to appear in the work of the Museum staff and 
which will be made available for other institutions from time to time 
through the luiblications of the Museum.

many similar establishments at home and abroad.

specialists in the production of these papers has greatly enhanced the

plished by participation in the great expositions in Philadelphia, Berlin, 
London, New Orleans, Cincinnati, Louisville, Madrid, and Chicago.

uted to other museums and to colleges and schools. 

EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENT. 

That the United States must have a National Museum worthy of the 
dignity of the nation is self evident. 

Every country has a museum or group of museums in its capital 
city — centers of scientific and educational activity — the treasure-house 
of the people, filled with memorials of national triumphs in the fields 
of science, art, and industrial progress.' 

These are legitimate objects of national pride, for upon the character 
of its museums and libraries, intelligent persons, visiting a country, very 
properly base their judgment as to the nature and degree of the civili- 
zation of the people. 

Washington may without question be made the seat of one of the 
greatest museums in the world. It may perhaps be neither practicable 
nor desirable to gather together in this city extensive collections of 
ancient media'val art, but a representative series of such objects will 
undonl)tedly grow up which will tend to educate the jmblic taste, 
promote the study of the elements of art and the history of civiliza 
tion, and forward the arts of design. This having been accomplished, 
attention should be directed mainly toward the exhibition of the geol- 
(»gy and natural history of America and its natural resources, to the 
preservation of memorials of its aboriginal inhabitants, and the encour- 
agement of the arts and industries of our own people. 

It is evident that the National Museum of the United States will of 
necessity have features peculiar to itself, developed in response to the 
|)eculiar needs of the peojde of this continent. It should be remem- 
bered that the national collections of every principal European nation 
are divided into several groups, each under separate administration, 



'Most of tho older nations have museums devoted to their military achievements 
uiul triumphs, but our country has no need or desire to enter into this held of work.

though often withia the general control of some central authority. In 
France, for instance, most of the museums are under the Ministry of 
Public Instruction, and in England, to a less extent, under the Depart- 
ment of Science and Art. 

In the great capitals of Europe the public collections are scattered 
through various parts of the same city, in museums witli distinctive 
names and independent in their organizations. Much of the work 
which should properly be done by such museums is omitted, because 
no one of them has seen fit to undertake it; while, on the other hand, 
much labor is duplicated, which is perhaps equally unfortunate — col- 
lections of similar scope and purpose being maintained in different 
parts of the same city. One of the chief objections to such division 
of effort is that much of the value of large collections in any depart- 
ment is lost by failure to concentrate them where they may be studied 
and compared side by side. In Washington the national collections 
are all, without exception, concentrated in one group of buildings. 
The Army Medical Museum now occuiiies a building side by side with 
those under the control of the Smithsonian Institution, and this prox- 
imity, in connection with the long-established policy of cooperation 
between the two organizations, renders them, for all practical purposes, 
united in interest. 

Although the appropriations from the public treasury for the main- 
tenance of the National Museum are small compared with those in 
several European countries, the value of objects given by private indi- 
viduals is proportionately large. The actual value of such contribu- 
tions for ten years past has not, it is estimated, fallen short of $20,000 
a year, and in some years it has been greater. 

Among important gifts may be mentioned the George Catlin Indian 
gallery, of inestimable value to the American historian and ethnologist; 
the collection of North American insects, given by Prof. C. V. Riley; 
the collection bequeathed in 1887 by the late Dr. Isaac Lea, of Phila- 
delphia, containing, besides minerals and other objects, about 20,000 
conchological specimens, and appraised by the State at $10,000; the 
collections of mollusks, gems, and precious stones presented by the 
Eev. L. T. Chamberlain and Mrs. Frances Lea Chamberlain; the large 
and valuable collections of African mammals, birds, etc., made and 
presented by Dr. W. L. Abbott and Mr, William Astor Chanler; the 
Bendire and Ralph collections of American birds' eggs, given to the 
Smithsonian Institution; the Lacoe collection of fossil plants, and 
the collection of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, for the 
transfer of which from Philadelphia to Washington a special appro- 
priation was made by Congress. 

Some exceedingly valuable collections in this country and in Europe 
have been bequeathed to the Smithsonian Institution, which have not 
yet come into its possession. It is estimated that witiiin the past fifteen 
years individuals to the number of more than 2,000 have made gifts to 
the Museum to the value of $100 each, or more. 



10 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

The National Museum uow contains more than three and a half mil- 
lions of objects. 

The intrinsic value of such collections as these can not well be ex- 
pressed in figures. There are single specimens worth hundreds, others 
worth thousands of dollars, and still others which are unique and price- 
less. Many series of specimens, which owe their value to their com- 
pleteness and to the labor which has been expended on them, can not 
be repla<'ed at any price. The collections at a forced sale would realize 
more than has been expended on them, and a fair appraisal of their 
vahie would amount to several millions of dollars. 

One of the most striking features in the affairs of the Museum is the 
manner in which its collections are increasing. In 1890 the number of 
specimens is more than eighteen times as great as in 1882. 

In the direct purchase of specimens but little money has been spent, 
less perhaps in tlfty years than either France, England, Germany, or 
Austria expends in a single year on similar objects. The entire 
Museum is the outgrowth of Government expeditions and expositions, 
and of gifts i)rompted largely by the generosity of the American people. 

As might be supposed, a considerable proportion of the objects given 
are duplicates of material already on hand, and although these con- 
tributions can, with the utmost advantage, be used for distribution 
to museums and schools, they do not materially increase the value of 
the collections for study by specialists and for general educational 
purposes. 

The need of a larger fund for the purchase of specimens is yearly 
becoming more manifest. Exceedingly important material is constantly 
ottered at prices very nnich below what it would cost to obtain it by 
collecting, and in many instances, when refused, it is eagerly taken 
by the museums and institutions of Europe. 

The Museum in its i)resent condition may be compared to a book 
from which i)ages here and there have been omitted, so that the narra- 
tive is disjointed and incomplete. 

The museums of England are rich with the accumulations of centu- 
ries. The National Museum of the United States is young, and has 
enornions deficiencies in every department. It needs, more than any 
museum in Europe, the opportunity to increase its resources through 
l>nrclia8e. The total amount expended for the purchase of specimens 
for the National Museum since 1891 has averaged less than $7,000 a 
year. 

For the purchase of specimens for the South Kensington Museum, 
from 1853 to 1887, $1,586,634 was expended, or a yearly average of 
nearly $47,000. 

Toward her other museums England is equally liberal. Exact sta- 
tistics are not at hand, but it is quite within bounds to assert that her 
average expenditures for the purchase of new objects for museums in 
Loudon 18 not less than $500,000 a year. 



REPORT OP ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 11 

Our Museum is the result of the activities of au enlightened Govern- 
ment. Through a thousand channels materials for the formation of a 
museum come into the possession of the Government, and out of such 
materials our Museum has been built. A museum formed in this man 
uer, however, suffers sooner or later fi'om immense accumulations of 
objects of certain kinds and from the absence of others. This is true 
of the National Museum. At the outset no additions were unwelcome, 
and the expectation that all important deficiencies would be supplied 
might properly be indulged in. As the years have passed, however, it 
has become more and more apparent that many of these deficiencies 
can only be supplied by purchase. 

More striking present results might certainly have been attained by 
limiting the developments of the Museum to special fields. We have, 
however, had in view the future as well as the ijresent, and no object 
has been refused a place in the Museum which Is likely to be needed, 
even in the remote future, in the development of whatever grand 
museum plans the nation may ultimately be willing to promote. 

B. — Organization and Scope of the Museum. 

The National Museum is under the charge of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution, and its operations are supervised by the Board of Regents of 
the Institution. 

The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution is by law the "keeper 
of the Smithsonian Museum," and the assistant secretary, by the usage 
of nearly fifty years, its executive head. 

In the act of Congress passed in 1846, to establish the Smithsonian 
Institution, are contained the following provisions concerning the scope 
of the museum to be placed under its charge : 

1. The act above referred to provides that " all objects of art and 
of foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural history, 
plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging, or 
hereafter to belong, to the United States, wliich maybe in the city 
of Washington," shall be delivered, to the Regents of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, and, together with new specimens obtained by 
exchange, donation, or otherwise, shall be so arranged and classi- 
fied as best to facilitate examination and study. 

2. It provides that, in pro])ortion as suitable arrangements can 
be made for their reception, these objects shall be delivered to such 
persons as may be authorized by the Board of Regents to receive 
them. 

3. It provides that they shall be arranged in such order and so 
classified as best to facilitate their examination and study. 

4. It provides that they shall thus be arranged in the building to 
be erected for the Institution. 

5. It authorizes the Regents to obtain new specimens, by exchange 
of duplicate specimens and by gilt, and directs also that they shall 
be appropriately classified and arranged. * 

The National Museum thus became the authorized place of deposit 
for all objects of art, archiEology, ethnology, natural history, miner- 



■jO REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

alojiy, geolofjy, etc., belonging to the United States or collected by any 
iXiiviH-y whatsoever lor the (iovernnientof tbe United States, wbeu no 
longer needed for investigations in i)rogress. 

The collections in the Museum are intended to exhibit the natural 
and industrial resources, primarily of the United States and secondarily 
of other i)arts of the world, for purposes of comparison. 

The activities of the Museum are exerted especially in three directions: 

1 . The i)ermaMent preservation of the collections already in its posses- 
sion, which depends chietlj' upon the vigilance of the curators and the 
skill of the preparators, 

2. The increase of the collections, which are acquired — 

(1) From the various Government surveys and expeditions, in 
accordance with law; 

(2) By gift from individuals, from other institutions, and from 
foreign governments; 

(;i) By exchange for its duplicate specimens or for publications; 

(4) By the efforts of officers of the Museum, who make collections 
in connection with their regular duties, or are detailed for special 
service of this nature; 

(.")) By purchase, when appropriations are made by Congress for 
that purpose. 

3. The utilization of the collections, which is effected by exhibiting 
them to the public, and by encouraging investigations on the part of 
the officers of the Museum and other suitable persons, and facilitating 
the publication of the results; also by the distribution to other museums 
and educational institutions of duplicate specimens, which have formed 
the basis of scientific investigation, these being identified and labeled 
by the best authorities. 

The collections of the National Museum are made up to a very large 
extent of the following materials: 

1, The natural history and anthropological collections accumu- 
lated since 1850 by the efforts of the officers and correspondents of 
the Smithsonian Institution. 

2. Collections which have resulted from explorations carried on 
more or less directly under the ausi)ices of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution, or resulting from explorations carried on by the Smithsonian 
Institution in connection with educational institutions or commer- 
cial establishments. 

.'5. Collections which have been obtained through the courtesy of 
the Department of State and the cooperation of United States 
ministers and consuls. 

^ 4. The coHectioii of the Wilkes Exploring Expedition, the Perry 
Expedition to Japan, and other naval expeditions. 

5. Collections made by the scientific oflicers of Government sur- 
veys,^ such as the Pacitic Railroad Survey, the Mexican Bound- 
ary Survey, and the surveys carried on by the Engineer Corps of 
the li iMted States Army and by oflicers of the Signal Corps of the 
I nited States Army stationed in remote regions. 

0. Collections obtained by the United States Geological Survey 
the I nited States Fish Commission, and those resulting from the 
activitiesol the Fnited States Department of Agriculture and other 
Departments ot the (iovernment. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 13 

7. The remnaut of the collectious of the old "National Institute." 

8. The collectious made by the United States to illustrate the 
animal and mineral resources, the fisheries, and the ethnology of 
the native races of the country on the occasion of the Centennial 
Exhibition at Philadeli)hia in 1870 ; the fishery collections displayed 
by the United States at the International Fisheries Exhibition at 
Berlin in 1880 and at London in 1883, and the collections obtained 
from various local expositions, as, for instance, the New Orleans 
Cotton Centennial Exposition in 1884 and 1885, the Cincinnati 
Exposition in 1887, and the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. 

9. The collections given by the Governments of the several for- 
eign nations, thirty in number, which participated in the exhibition 
at Philadelphia in 1876. 

10. The industrial collections given by numerous manufacturing 
and commercial houses of Europe and America at the time of the 
Philadelphia Exhibition and subseiiuently. 

11. The materials received from museums in Europe and America 
in exchange for duplicate specimens. 

12. Collections received as gifts, deposits, or in exchange from 
individuals, numbering usually from 1,000 to 1,500 each year. 

The publications of the Museum consist of — 

1. The Annual Report. 

2. The Proceedings of the National Museum. 

3. The Bulletin of the National Museum. 

4. The series of circulars. 

Papers by members of the Museum staff, based upon the collections, 
have been printed in every scientific periodical in the United States 
and in many of those of Europe. 

RELATIONS OF THE MUSEUM TO THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. 

The Smithsonian Institution, although it bears the name of a for- 
eigner, has for half a century been one of the most important agencies 
in the intellectual life of our i^eople. It has been a rallying point for 
the workers in every department of scientific and educational work 
and the chief agency for the free exchange of books, apparatus of 
research, and of scientific intelligence between this and other coun- 
tries. Its publications, which include more than two hundred volumes, 
are to be found in all the important libraries in the world, and some of 
them, it is safe to say, on the work-table of every scientific investigator. 
Its great library constitutes an integral and very important part of 
the national collection at the Capitol, and its museum is the richest in 
existence in many branches of the natural history and ethnology of 
the New World. Many wise and enlightened scholars have given their 
best years to its service, and some of the most eminent men of science 
to whom our country has given birth have passed their entire lifetime 
in working for its success. 

Through these books, through the reputation of the men who have 
worked for it and through it, and through the good accomplished by 
its system of international exchange, by means of which within the 
past forty-four years about one and a half million i)ackages of books 



14 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

and other sciontilu- and literary materials have been distributed to 
every rejiion of the earth, it has acquired a reputation at least as far- 
reaching as that of any other institution of learning in the world. 

It is therefore representative of what is deemed in other lands the 
chief glory of this nation, for whatever may be thought in other coun- 
tries of American art and literature, or of American institutions 
generally, the science of America is everywhere accepted as sound, 
vigorous, and progressive. 

In the scientific journals of Great Britain and other European coun- 
tries the reader tinds most appreciative reviews of the scientific publi- 
cations of the Smithsonian, the Museum, the Bureau Of Ethnology, the 
Cleological Survey, the Dei^artmeiit of Agriculture, and the Fish Com- 
mission, and they are (constantly holding up the Government of the 
United States as an example of what governments should do for the 
support of their scientific institutions. 

It is surely a legitimate source of pride to Americans that their work 
in science should be so thoroughly appreciated by other nations, and it 
is important that the reputation should be maintained. Nothing can 
be more in consonance with the spirit of our Government, or more in 
accord with the injunction of Washington in his Farewell Address, 
admiringly quoted by Sir Lyon Playfair in his address as president of 
I he Uritish Association for the Advancement of Science: 

Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for the 
(jeneral diffusion of Imoicledge. 

In 'proportion as the structure of a government gives force to public 
opinion, it should be enlightened. 

No one has yet explained, except by conjecture, why James Smithson 
selected the United States as the seat of his foundation. He had no 
acquaintances in America, nor does he appear to have had any books 
relating to Anierica, except two. Khees quotes from one of these 
("Travels through North America," by Isaac Weld, secretary of the 
Royal Society) a paragraph concerning Washington, then a small town 
of 5,00(1 inhabitants, in which it is predicted that " the Federal city, as 
soon as luivigation is perfected, will increase most rapidly," and that, 
at a future day, if the afltairs of the United States go on as prosper- 
ously as they have done, it will become the grand emporium of the 
West and rival in magnitude and splendor the cities of the Old World. 

inspired by a belief in the future greatness of the new nation, 
realizing that while the needs of England were well met by existing 
organizations, such as would not be likely to spring up for many years 
in a new, poor, and growing country, he founded in the new England 
an institution of learning, the civilizing power of which has been of 
n.calcula])le value. Who can attempt to say what the condition of the 
I nited States would have been to-day without this bequest? 

Well did President .John Quincy Adams say: 

Of all the foundations of establishments for pious or charitable uses 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 15 

which ever signalized the spirit of the age or the comprehensive beneficence 
of the founder^ none can he named more deserving the approbation of 
manJcind. 

The most important service by far which the Smithsonian Institution 
has rendered to the nation has been that extended from year to year 
since 1846 — intangible but none the less aj)preciable — by its constant 
cooperation with the Government, pubhc institutions, and individuals 
in every enterprise, scientific or educational, which needed advice, 
support, or aid from manifold resources. 

There have been, however, material results of its activities, the extent 
of which can not fail to impress anyone who will look at them. The 
most important of these are the library and the Museum, which have 
grown up under its fostering care. 

THE LIBRARY. 

The library has been accumulated without aid from the Treasury of 
the United States. It has, in fact, been the result of an extensive 
system of exchanges, the publications ol" the Institution having been 
used to obtain similar publications from institutions of learning in all 
parts of the world. 

The value of the books distributed since the Institution was opened, 
must have been nearly $1,000,000, or nearly twice the original bequest 
of Smithson.i Many of these publications are now out of print. 

In return for these, and by i)urchase, it has received the great col- 
lection of books which forms its library and which is one of the richest 
in the world in the publications of learned societies, and therefore of 
inestimable value, containing, as it does, the record of actual progress 
in all that pertains to the mental and physical development of the 
human family, and aftbrding the means of tracing the history of every 
branch of positive science since the days of the revival of letters until 
the present time. This library was, in 1865, deposited at the Capitol, 
as a portion of the Congressional Library. 

The Smithsonian Collection, which includes more than three hundred 
thousand volumes and parts of volumes, constituting perhaps one- 
fourth of the National Library, is to be installed in a special hall of its 
own upon the main floor of the new library building. The rapidity 
with which it is increasing is indicated by the fact that more than 
32,000 titles were added during the past fiscal year.^ 

The Institution has probably done more toward building up a great 
library in Washington than would have been possible had all its 
income been devoted strictly to library work, as was at one time seri- 
ously proposed. 

• This estimate is based npon the prices which are charged for the books by second- 
hand dealers, as shown in their catalogues. 

-The working libraries of the National Museum and the Bureau of Ethnology are 
distinct from the general Smithsonian library and are separately administered. All 
of these are placed at the service of advanced students and specialists. 



IQ REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

The books are still deposited cliietly in the Capitol, but though their 
number has been so largely increased year by year, now forming one 
of the most valuable collections of the kind in existence, they not only 
remain unbound, but in a far more crowded and inaccessible condition 
than they were before the transfer, a condition of affairs which, it is 
hoi)ed, will soon be remedied. 

The purchasing power of the publications of the Institution, when 
offered in exchange, is far greater than that of money, and its benetit 
is exerted chietly in behalf of the National Library, and also to a con- 
siderable extent in behalf of the ]Srational Museum. 

Tlie amount expended during the past forty years from the private 
fund of the Institution, in the publication of books for gratuitous dis- 
tribution, has been fully half as much as the original Smithson bequest. 

These publications have had their influence for good in many ways; 
but, in addition to this, a library much more than equal in value to the 
outlay has, through their buying power, come into the possession of 
the nation. 

In addition to all this, a large amount of material has been acquired 
for the Museum by direct expenditure from the private fund of the 
Smithsonian Institution. The value of the collections thus acquired is 
estimated to be more than equal to the whole amount of the Smithson 
bequest. 

The early history of the Museum was much like that of the library. 
It was not until 1858 that it became the authorized depository of the 
scientific collections of the Government, and it was not until after 1876 
that it was officially recognized as the IS'ational Museum of the United 
States. 

But for the provident forethought of the Smithsonian Institution, 
the Ignited States would probably still be without a reputable nucleus 
for a national museum. 

The relations of the Museum to the system of popular lectures, for 
many years established in Washington, which replaces the old Smith- 
sonian courses, once so influential, and the assistance which it affords 
each year to students of science, are referred to elsewhere in this 
report. 

The Institution publishes many circulars giving information on scien- 
tific sjibjects, which are distributed gratuitously to those who write to 
make in(|uiries, and this system is being continually extended. In addi- 
tion to this, a large correspondence is carried on with people in search of 
information on scientific topics. Probably not less than 7,500 letters a 
year go out to people who write seeking to know the name of some object 
or other scientific fact. Inquiries of this kind are always answered 
promptly and fully; and frequently, to intelligent inquirers, books are 
sent which will eiiaule them to find out such names for themselves in 
futun>. Tins work has not only an educational value, but often a great 
economic importance as well, as, for instance, when som.- common min- 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 17 

eral has been mistaken for one of value, some useless plant has been 
wrongly identified and supposed to be of service in medicine, or some 
harmless animal feared as noxious. 

The publications of the Institution and its dependencies reach every 
State and al nost every county in the United States. A careful study 
of the subject, recently made by the president of one of the scientific 
societies in Washington, seems to indicate that there are several States 
which are reached by no scientific publications whatever except those 
distributed gratuitously by the Government. 

Speaking of the Smithsonian Institution proper, and not of the 
Museum or any other trust which it administers, it may be positively 
stated that in the execution of the trust of Smithson more has been 
given to the Government than has been received. The machinery of the 
Institution's action has been such that it has incidentally, in connec- 
tion with its legitimate woik for the increase and diffusion of knowl- 
edge, paid over to the Government the eciuivalent of much more than 
the whole original fund. 

Can the United States fail to recognize its obligation to supplement 
liberally this private contribution for public good, especially if it be 
borne in mind that, as Secretary Langley has shown, the Institution 
has left in perpetual charge of the nation, in the Museum alone, prop- 
erty acquired out of its private fund which is now more than equal in 
value to tlie whole amount of the Smithson bequest ? 

Every museum has its special characteristics growing out of its form 
of organization, its location, scope, and financial and other resources. 
The character of the National Museum is fundamentally affected by its 
connection with the Smithsonian Institution, its dependence upon Con 
gress for appropriations annually, and the necessity, under existing 
laws, of its caring for all collections belonging to the Government. 

Of the connection of the Museum with the Smithsonian Institution, 
it should be said that it is in the highest degree advantageous. It 
should be borne in mind that it is essentially a Smithsonian museum, 
since, especially in its earlier history, the Institution expended large 
sums of money in aiding explorations, with the distinct purpose of 
increasing the collections in certain directions, while of late years 
it has deposited all the valuable gifts and bequests of specimens it 
has received. It lias had in addition, for nearly half a century, the 
use of the larger portion of the Smithsonian building, and, what is of 
paramount importance, the guidance and infiuence of the officers 
of the Institution, and the very valuable nssistance of its numerous 
correspondents. 

C. — The Work of the Museum in Public Education. 

The work of the Museum, if it only i)erf(>rmed the functions of an 
institution for scientific investigation, w^ould be of sufficient value to 
justify its maintenance and extension. The Museum, however, not 
NAT MIS 90 U 



[<;^ REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

only performs these functions, but also does a very great deal to render 
the resources of science available to the i)ublic at large. 

The National Museum is a treasure-house filled with materials for the 
use of investigators, and it is also an agency for the instruction of the 
peoph^ of the whole country. 

In a recent address before the American Historical Association, I 
attempted to exi)lain the idea of our work as follows: 

(1) That public institutions of learning are not intended for the few, 
but for the enlightenment and education of the masses. 

(L') That the public has a right to full participation in the results of 
the work of the scientific establishments which they are helping to 
maintain. 

(3) That one of the chief duties of the officers of these institutions 
is to provide means by which such results may be presented in an 
attractive as well as an intelligible form. 

No scientific institution is more thoroughly committed to the work of 
the diflusion of knowledge than is the Smithsonian Institution, and no 
department of its activity has greater possibilities in this respect than 
the National Museum. 

The benefits of the Museum are extended not only to the specialists 
in its laboratories and to the hundreds of thousands of visitors from 
all parts of the United States who pass its doors each year, but to local 
institutions and their visitors throughout the country, through the dis- 
tribution of the duplicate specimens in the Museum, which are made 
up into sets, accurately named, and distributed to schools and museums. 
Every museum in the United States has profited in this way, and by 
its system of exchange the Museum has, while enriching itself, con- 
tributed largely to the stores of every important scientific museum in 
the world. 

Not only are specimens thus sent out, but aid is rendered in other 
ways. Within the last year many local museums in the United States 
were supplied with working plans of cases in use in the Museum, and 
similar sets of plans have been supplied within the past few years to 
national museums in other countries. 

Not only do the people of the country at large profit by the work of 
the Smithsonian, as made available to local institutions, but also to a 
very considerable extent directly and personally. 

The curator of each department in the Museum is expected to be an 
authority in his own line of work, and the knowledge of the whole 
staff' of experts is thus placed, without cost, at the service of every 
citizen. 

It is much to be regretted that many specialists, intent chiefly upon 
the study of certain scientific problems in which they individually are 
absorbed, are disposed to neglect the claims of the educated public to 
the enjoyment and instruction which museums afford. They do not

beuelit solely of persons engaged in research. Such men would lind 
no welcome among us. 

The experience of Europe, with its magnificent public museums, and 
the history of the several expositions in the United States should be 
quite sufticient to satisfy anyone who has studied the matter, that the 
museum is an educational power even more influential than the public 
library. 

The venerable director of the South Kensington Museum, the late 
Sir Philip Cuuliffe Owen, speaking from an experience of thirty-five 
years, not only in his own establishment, but in the work of building 
up the score of affiliated museums in the various provincial towns of 
Great Britain, remarked to the writer: 

Wc educate our working people in the public schools, give them a love for refined 
and beautiful objects, and stimulate in them a desire for information. They leave 
school, go into the pursuits of town life, and have no means provided for the gratih- 
catiou of the tastes which they have been forced to acquire. It is as much the duty 
of the Government to provide them with museums and libraries for their higher 
education as it is to establish schools for their primary instruction. 

In the same conversation Sir Philip insisted very strongly that a 
museum not actually engaged in educational work of some kind could 
not long survive, pointing to the great system of lectures and exam- 
inations connected with the Science and Art Department of the Council 
of Education, of which the South Kensington Museum was one of the 
chief agencies.' 

'No new general statement relating to the history, organization, and activities of 
the National Museum having been prepared by Dr. Goode prior to his death, the 
foregoing paragraphs are repeated from the Report of 1895, with a few minor 
changes, bringing the subject down to date. — Editok.

COOPERATION OF THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS OF THE

The increase in the collections during the year, resulting directly or 
indirectly from assistance rendered by the Executive Departments and 
Bureaus of the Government, or by officials whose duties have enabled 
them to collect for the Museum or to influence and encourage others in 
so doing, has been very satisfactory. 

The active support which the Museum has always enjoyed at the 
hands of American ministers and consuls stationed abroad has been 
most gratifying. During the year covered by this report a series of 
photographs and etchings were transmitted by Mr. R. M. Bartleman, 
United States consul, Antigua, West Indies. Mr. Alfred Krauss, 
United States consular agent, Zittau, Germany, has forwarded geolog- 
ical material. Hon. W. W. Rockhill, Assistant Secretary of State, 
whose generous gilts have been so often alluded to in the reports, has 
continued to aid the Museum. Mr. Henry C. Smith, United States 
consul, Santos, Brazil, transmitted a sloth, in behalf of Mr. Gubtave G. 
Beyer. 



30 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

Tlie prompt compliiiuce of tlie Treasury Department with requests 
for tlie free entry of material from abroad, aud the continued courtesies 
exteiMled by tlie collector of customs in connection with its transpor- 
tation to Washington, have resulted in saving much time and money 
to the Museum, and the assistance thus rendered is very highly 
appreciated. 

The :\Iuseum is indebted to Capt. J. H. Long, keeper of the life- 
saving station at Fenwicks Island, Delaware, for the skeleton of a 
Finback Whale. 

Lieut. J. II. Scott, of the United States revenue-marine cutter For- 
ward^ has transnntted a specimen of Hawk Moth, llmjo higuhris.

from regions where ordinary means of transportation could not be util- 
ized, except at great expense to the Museum. 

Several officers of the United States Army have interested them- 
selves in obtaining material for the Museum from various parts of the 
United States, South America, and the West Indies. Prominent 
among them are Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, Maj. Charles Bendire, Gapt. 
W. C. Brown, Capt. Henry Romeyn, Lieut. Wirt Eobinson, Dr. E. E. 
Ilodge, Dr. W. M. Ihewer, Dr. D. S. Lamb, Dr. W^ashington Mat- 
thews, and Dr. J. C. Merrill. Mr. Isaac C. Noyes, of the Army Med- 
ical iNIuseum, transmitted an archaeological object from Virginia. 

The Museum is indebted to officers of the Navy for several interest- 
ing contributions to the Museum collections. Through the aid of 
Lieut. Commander S. M. Schley valuable additions to the collections 
have been obtained. Dr. James M, Flint continues to act as honorary 
curator of the section of materia medica in the Museum. 

Under the Department of the Interior, the United States Geological 
Survey has transmitted a large number of collections made by mem- 
bers of its staff while engaged in field duty. Among these should be 
especially mentioned Prof. F. W. Clarke, Dr. David T. Day, Dr. T. M. 
Chatard, Dr. W. H. Dall, and Mr. T. W. Stanton. Hon. Charles D. 
Walcott, Director of the Survey, has transmitted specimens illustrating 
the Lower Cambrian formation from the White Mountain Eange, Inyo 
County, Cal., and Carboniferous limestone fossils from Berne, Albany 
County, N. Y. The collections received from the Survey are enumer- 
ated in the List of Accessions (Appendix ii). 

Dr. Z. T. Daniel, of the Indian Office, Avho for many years has 
contributed information concerning Indian ceremonies, as well as 
numerous specimens, has continued to manifest active interest in the 
ethnological department of the ]Museum. 

Mr. Charles F. D;ivis, Indian agent, Colorado Elver Agency, Parker, 
Ariz., presented a model of a raft constructed by the chief of the Mojave 
Indians. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 31 

From the Bureau of Education was received a photograph of twiu 
Eskimo chihlren at Port Clareuce, Alaska. 

Perhaps no bureau of the Government has been in closer affiliation 
with the National Museum in past years than the United States Fish 
Commission. Since its organization in 1871 the Museum has been con- 
stantly enriched by the acquisition of large collections, especially of 
fishes and marine invertebrate objects. These departments in the 
Museum have hitherto been cared for by officers of the Fish Commis- 
sion, and their honorary position as curators in the Museum, it is 
thought, has been a source of much mutual benefit to the Commission 
and the Museum. The collections of special interest from the Commis- 
sion during the present year were gathered principally by, or through 
the cooperation of, Prof B. W. Evermann, Dr. Hugh M. Smith, and 
Mr. Charles H. Townsend. 

The collections received during the year from the different bureans 
of the Department of Agriculture have been large and varied. The 
botanical collections, under the care of Mr. F. V. Coville, Botanist of 
that Department, have been greatly enriched. Large quantities of 
interesting botanical material have been obtained from different sec- 
tions of the country, through the agency of collectors connected with 
the Department of Agriculture. In the classification of plants, etc., as 
well as in obtaining material. Prof F. L. Lamson-Scribner, Dr. J. N. 
Rose, and Mr. J. B. Leiberg have been conspicuous in their efforts. 

The services of Mr. L. O. Howard, entomologist of the Department, 
who succeeded Prof C. V. Biley as honorary curator of the department 
of insects in the National Museum, have resulted in the addition of 
numerous specimens to the Musenm collection. In the classification 
and identification of the collections of Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, and 
Diptera he has been ably assisted by Messrs. Ashmead, Linell, and 
Coquillett. The Museum is also indebted to Mr. E. A. Schwarz for 
large collections of different orders of insects collected by him. 

Through Dr. C. Hart Merriam, Chief of the Biological Survey, types 
and other specimens of fishes collected by the Death Valley Expedition 
and described by Prof C. H. Gilbert, have been transferred to the 
Museum. Fishes, crabs and shrimps, land and fresh-water shells, col- 
lected by Messrs. Nelson and Goldman in Mexico and in the western 
part of the United States, have been received, as well as large quan- 
tities of other material obtained by collectors attached to tlie Depart- 
ment of Agriculture. 

The Bureau of Animal Industry, under the direction of Dr. D. E. 
Salmon, has been instrumental in adding to the Museum some very 
interesting material. Among the most valuable collections of para- 
sites transmitted by the Bureau are those made by Dr. C. W. Stiles, tlie 
honorary custodian of the helminthological collections of the National 
Museum. 

The collections which have been received from the Bureau of Eth- 



32 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

nology have been not only large in numbers, but of great importance. 
Parttuhir mention is here made of the material obtained by Dr. J. 
Walter Fewkes in connection with his explorations in Arizona and 
New Mexico, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution. 

EXPLORATIONS. 

Dr. William L. Abbott has continued his explorations in Africa and 
India, and the collections which he has forwarded to the Museum 
during the year have been of unusual interest and importance. The 
value of the ethnological objects included in his collections has been 
very greatly enhanced by the full and accurate descriptions accompany- 
ing them. A series of skins of lemurs and of the insectivores peculiar 
to Madagascar is of special interest. The material is carefully pre- 
pared and unusually well preserved. 

An interesting collection of antiquities was obtained by Dr. J.Walter 
Fewkes during the summer of 1895 from the cliff dwellings and ancient 
pueblos near Tusayan, Ariz. 

During the travels of Lieut. Wirt Kobinson, United States Army, 
in the West Indies and South America, he obtained some desirable 
natural-history material for the Museum. 

For several years Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, United States Army, has 
been an enthusiastic co-operator in the work of the National Museum. 
In connection with the Boundary Commission between the United States 
and Mexico he made very extensive and valuable collections for the 
Museum, and has later been instrumental in various ways in adding 
natural-history material to its collections. During 1890 he collected for 
the Museum mammals, birds, and other natural-history specimens in 
Virginia, Pennsylvania, and along the Gulf of California. 

A large collection of human bones was obtained by Gen. A. L. Pride- 
more, Jonesville, Ya., while engaged in mound explorations in Scott 
County. This collection has been generously presented by him to the 
National Museum. 

Dr. K. Ellsworth Call, Cincinnati, Ohio, has explored the Mammoth 
Cave and other caves iu Kentucky. In the former he obtained several 
interesting specimens of bats, which he has presented to the Museum. 

COLLECTORS' OUTFITS. 

Outfits to be used in collecting specimens for the National Museum 
have been furnished to the following persons during the year: Dr. 
Edgar A. Mearns, United States Army, Gettysburg, Pa.; Mr. C. W. 
Ptichmond, United States National Museum, for collecting in Virginia; 
Prof. C. H. Gilbert, care of United States consul, Panama, Colombia, 
South America; Itev. P. U. Sorensen, Jakobshavn, North Greenland; 
Prof. H. Ellsworth Call, 317 Walnut street, Cincinnati, Ohio; Mr. 
Kobert Kidgway, United States National Museum, for collecting in

Florida; Mr. E. W. Yickers, Ellsworth, Ohio; Dr. Frank Furlong, care 
of the steamship Galilee, Brooklyn, N. Y. ; Mr. Frank Burns, Suffolk, 
Va. ; Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, for collecting in Arizona, and Mr. A. W. 
Anthony, San Diego, Cal. 

DEVELOPMENT AND ARRANGEMENT OF THE EXHIBITION SERIES. 

In the department of mammals the exhibition series is practically 
unchanged. A few specimens were withdrawn for a time for exhibi- 
tion at Atlanta. The type of Ohanler's Reed Buck was put on a new 
stand and added to the exhibition series, and a young lion and young 
tiger were also placed upon exhibition. 

In tlie department of mollusks the exhibition series is in good condi- 
tion, and has been beautified by the addition of a series of mounted 
specimens illustrating the chief families of mollusks exhibited at the 
Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta. A portion of 
the exhibition series in the department of insects is now displayed in 
the small room adjoining the hall occupied by the department of com- 
parative anatomy. The work of renovating the mounted collection in 
the department of birds, which was begun during the last fiscal year, 
has been continued. The exhibition series of birds' eggs and nests is 
in good condition, and it would be very desirable to increase it, were 
this course now practicable. 

The synoptic series of invertebrates has been transferred from the 
department of marine invertebrates to the department of comparative 
anatomy, and the space which it formerly occupied will be devoted to 
an exhibit of deep sea fishes. Some slight changes have been made in 
the cases in the west hail of the Smithsonian building, and a number 
of deep-sea sponges and corals, together with some holothurians in 
alcoliol and a few starfishes, have been placed upon exhibition. Labels 
have been printed for the holothurians, and labels for the starfishes 
are in preparation. All of the named sponges on exhibition have also 
been provided with printed labels. The table cases in this department 
have been provided with casters, so that they may be readily moved 
without danger of injuring the specimens. In the department of fishes, 
there are five cases of plaster casts on exhibition, one case containing 
stuffed fishes, a large number of casts on the tops of cases, and a small 
group of land Gobies. 

The mounting of the exhibition series of Mesozoic and Tertiary 
plants is now practically finished. In order to test the advantages of 
mounting fossils upon tiles, the historical collection of fossils in the 
department of geology was mounted in this manner. The results are 
considered to be quite satisfactory. Although the tiles are necessarily 
somewhat heavy, they are found to jjossess decided advantages over 
paper, wood, slate, or ground-glass tablets. The study series of inver- 
tebrate fossils has received attention, but much remains to be done 
before an intelligent selection can be made for the final exhibition series. 
NAT MUS 90 o 



34 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

A consiaorablo, amount of vertebrate material is nearly ready for 
installation in tlic exhibition series, and additional space for this pur- 
pose is much needed. 

A great deal of detail work has been accomplisliedin connection with 
the exhibition series in the department of minerals, and as a result the 
appearance of tlie collections is much improved. 

In the department of geology the historical series, the volcanic and 
elementary series, and the collections illustrating rock weathering and 
glaciation have been entirely rearranged. A large amount of work has 
also been done in the hall devoted to the economic series. That por- 
tion of the geological collections which is on exhibition is, all things 
considered, in very good condition, although, on account of the over- 
crowded condition of the hall and of tlie cases themselves, the appear- 
ancfe of the collections is not all that could be desired. 

In the west hall, which is devoted to the department of ethnology, 
are exhibited the objects connected with (1) JSTegroid Africa, (2) the 
Malayo-Polynesian or Indo-Pacific peoples, and (3) various Asiatic peo- 
ples. All of the Mexican and part of the Nicaraguan and Costa Rican 
collections in the department of prehistoric anthropology have been 
]>laced ui)on exhibition. This work necessitated the rearrangement of 
the cases already devoted to objects from these countries. As many as 
possible of the unbroken vessels from mounds in the United States 
were i)hu'ed ui)on exhibition. 

The collection of boats has been overhauled, the larger ones being 
suspended from the ceiling. Many models of boats have been repaired. 

In the east hall two new cases have been erected for the accommoda- 
tion of the electrical collections and the series illustrating methods of 
land transportation. 

The condition of the exhibition series in the section of grapl'iic arts 
remains practically the same as at the close of the preceding fiscal year. 
Alth(mgh the collection is not considered complete, it probably illus- 
trates better than any other collection of its kind, either in this country 
or abroad, the technical development of the reproductive processes. 

The collections of oriental antiquities and religious ceremonial objects 
are exhibited in the east and west halls immediately adjoining the 
rotunda. In the northeast alcove the Egyptian collection is installed, 
consisting of casts and busts arranged around the walls, the mosaic from 
Carthage, the collection of coins and gems, the collection of AssjTian 
seals, and other objects installed in cases. The southeast alcove con- 
tains the Assyio Babylonian collection, including the temple tower, the 
serpent column of Delphi, the collection of Bibles and musical instru- 
ments, casts arranged upon the walls, statues, etc. Above both of these 
alcoves, casts of leliefs of the obelisk from Constantinople and a series 
of Hittite casts are exhibited. The southwest alcove contains objects 
of Brahnianism, liuddhism, and Shintoism, while the Graco-Roman, 
Jewish, and .Alohammedan collections are installed in the northwest 
alcove. 



REPORT OF A!<SISTANT SECRETARY. 35 



LABELS. 

During tlie year nearly 150 requisitions for printing labels and blanks 
were received from the various departments in the Museum. 

There were printed on the Museum press 74,831 labels, representing 
eight hundred and three forms; 49,000 blanks, representing twenty- 
two forms ; 6,047 circulars, representing twelve forms ; and 0,090 copies, 
representing thirty-six forms, of other matter, making a total of 135,968 
copies. 

At the Government Printing Office there were printed wgon requi- 
sition by the Museum 52,200 blanks and circulars, representing ten 
forms, and ;)1,772 labels, representing one hundred and eighty-one 
forms, making a total of 83,972 copies. 

LnUlAKV. 

The librarian. Dr. Cyrus Adler, states that the accessions during the 
past year have been as follows: Periodicals, 5,542; books, 810; pam- 
phlets, 1,209; total, 7,561. From the accessions to the library of the 
Smithsonian Institution tliere have been retained for the use of the 
Museum 7,596 periodicals, 333 books, and 1,047 pamphlets, making a 
total of 8,976. A list of the accessions to the Museum library by gift 
and exchange will be found in Ajjpendix iii. 

The number of books borrowed during the year was 7,182, while 
5,330 were returned, about 1,800 having been retained in the sectional 
libraries. jSTearly 1,200 books were bound, of which, however, only 
about 200 belonged to the National Museum. Owing to lack of funds, 
it was impossible to have any more Museum books bound, although 
a large number require binding. 

The transfer of the periodical record to the standard library record 
has been continued, the new record containing at the close of the fiscal 
year 4,300 cards. There are 6,000 cards in the standard catalogue of 
books other than i)eriodicals. 

It is the desire of the librarian to have the catalogue unified, but 
the pressure of current work has been so great that progress in this 
direction has necessarily been slow. 

There has been no change in the number of sectional libraries since 
the last report, the list being as follows: 

1. Administration. 12. Marine invertebrates. 

2. Birds. 13. Materia medica. 

3. Botany. 14. Me«ozoic fossils. 

4. Comparative anatomy. 15. Mineralogy. 

5. Ethnology. 16. Mollusks. 

6. Fishes. 17. Oriental antiquities and roli 

7. Geology. gious ceremonials. 

8. Helminthology. 18. Paleobotany. 

9. Historical collections. 19. Photogi'aphy. 

10. Insects. 20. Prehistoric anthropology. 

11. Mammals. 21. Reptiles.

PUBLICATIONS. 

The Report of the Museum for 1893 was published early in the year, 
and the pa])ers in the appendix have appeared in separate form. The 
Rei)ort for 1894 is nearly all in type and much work has been accom- 
plished in the preparation of the volume for 1895. 

^'olume XVII of the Proceedings was distributed in July, and active 
progress has been made in printing and distributing the separate papers 
in Volume xviii. Nos. 1033 to 108L>, with three exceptions, have 
appeared, and also paper No. 1032, belonging to Volume xvii, but not 
received from the press in time for distribution before the close of last 
year. Volume xviii, in bound form, will probably be ready for dis- 
tribution in the autumn. Advance sheets of the following papers have 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 37 

been published : Xo. 1087, "Preliminary description of a new genus and 
two new species of Crustaceans from an artesian well at San Marcos, 
Tex.," by James E. Benedict; No. 1088, "Description of a new genus 
and species of Blind Tailed Batracliian from tlie subterranean waters 
of Texas," by LeonLard Stejneger; No. 1103, "Preliminary diagnoses 
of new mammals from the Mexican border of the United States," by 
Edgar A. Mearns. Manuscripts of fourteen additional papers to be 
published in the Proceedings were in the hands of the printer at the 
close of the fiscal year, and nineteen more have been accepted for 
publication. 

The following additional parts of Bulletin 39 have been issued : Part 
H, "Directions for collecting minerals," by Wirt Tassin; Part I, "Direc- 
tions for collecting rocks and for the preparation of thin sections," by 
George P. Merrill; Part J, "Directions for collecting specimens and 
information illustrating the aboriginal uses of plants," by Frederick V. 
Coville; Part K, "Directions for collecting and preparing fossils," by 
Charles Schuchert. 

Circular 47, in regard to the identification of mollusks by the National 
Museum, has been issued. 

The titles of all the papers which have appeared in the form of sepa- 
rates during the year are given in Appendix v. 

Bulletin No. 47, " The Fishes of North and Middle America : A Descrip- 
tive Catalogue of the Species of Fish-like Vertebrates found in the 
Waters of North America North of the Isthmus of Panama," by David 
Starr Jordan and Barton Warren Evermann, a volume of 1,1^40 pages, 
is entirely in type and will be shortly put to press. The present Bul- 
letin constitutes Part 1 of the work. A second volume of text and an 
atlas of plates will be published later. 

Bulletin No. 49, "A Bibliography of the Published Writings ot Philip 
Lutley Sclater, F. R. S., Secretary of the Zoological Society of London," 
prepared under the direction of Dr. G. Brown Goode, has been set in 
type. It contains 135 pages, with a portrait of Dr. Sclater as a frontis- 
piece. Much care has been given to the typography, with a special view 
to securing compactness and clearness. This work is not included in 
the series of Bibliographies of American Naturalists, of which five have 
been published (Bulletins 20, 23, 30, 40, and 41), since the scope of this 
series is necessarily limited to the work of naturalists living in the 
United States; but, inasmuch as Dr. Sclater's contributions to the 
systematic ornithology of the American continent have exceeded in 
extent those of anyone living in this country, it was deemed proper 
that the XJ. S. National Museuni should publish his bibliography. 

It was hoped that the second and third numbers of the Special Bul- 
letin, the first of which appeared in 1892, would be ready for distribu- 
tion before the end of the year, but owing to certain unavoidable delays 
this was impossible. No. 2 of the series, entitled "Oceanic Ichthyol- 
ogy : A Treatise on the Deep-sea and Pelagic Fishes of the World, based

cliielly upon the colkH'tioiis made by the Steamers Blalce, Albatross, 
and Fish //<nrA- in the Northwestern Atlantic," by George Brown Goode 
and Tarleton H. Bean, is an elaborate work of 553 pages, in quarto 
form, with an atlas of 417 figures arranged on 123 plates. The work 
of composition on Special Bulletin No. 3, which was partly put in typo 
last year, has been completed, and the Bulletin is now ready for the 
press. This Bulletin constitutes the second volume of '' The Life His- 
tories of North American Birds," by MaJ. Charles Beudire, and relates 
only to land birds, extending, in the classification given in the check- 
list of the American Ornithologists' Union, from the parrots to the 
grackles. The volume will contain 518 pages, and will be illustrated 
by seven chromo-lithographic plates of birds' eggs.

mann, for use in connection with a general revision of the Gastropods. 
Prof. Alpheus Hyatt received six species of Ammonites for examination, 
and about one hundred and fifty specimens of Blastoids were sent to 
Prof. Otto Jaekel, Berlin, Germany, for monographic work. Other 
paleontological material was sent out as follows : Four specimens of 
ConchopeJtis alicrnaia to Mr. E. O. Ulrich, Newport, Ky., for use in a 
revision of the Lower Silurian Gastropoda; ten lots of Foraminifera to 
Dr. Anthony Woodward, New York City, for determination; three 
si)ecies of Paleozoic Echinoids to Dr. Robert T. Jackson; one hundred 
and forty specimens of Paleozoic Cephalopods to Prof. John M. Clarke,

Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md. 

b^thnological material has been lent to the Bureau of American P^th- 
nology, for the purpose of preparing illustrations. Three stone adzes 
were transmitted to Mr. H. R. Bishop, New York City, and twelve 
si)ecimens of aboriginal implements were sent to Miss Alice Fletcher, 
of this city, for use in illustrating a lecture before the Women's Anthro- 
pological Society. 

About sixty thin sections of slates were lent to Prof. T. Nelson Dale, 
Williamstown, Mass.; twenty-five thin sections of Quincy granites to 
Mr. Theodore G. White, Columbia College, New York City; twenty-one 
thin sections and thirty-one specimens of Alaskan rocks to Mr. C. W. 
Purrington, United States Geological Survey, and fifty-five specimens 
of rocks from the Bear Paw Mountains to Mr. W. H. Weed, United 
States Geological Survey. 

WORK OF STUDENTS AND INVESTIGATORS AT THE MUSEUM. 

A number of students and investigators examined the collections in 
several departments of the Museum during the year, for the purpose 
of identifying specimens or of studying the characteristics of certain 
families or orders. A few of those who have availed themselves of 
this privilege are here mentioned. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 41 

Dr. E. A. Mearns, Uuited States Army, coutiuiied his study of the 
interesting and valuable collection of mammals, obtained by himself 
and Mr. F, X. Holzner on the Mexican boundary, with a view to pub- 
lishing an elaborate paper based upon this material. On account of 
the valuable service which he has rendered to the Museum he was 
accorded all of the privileges enjoyed by a regular curator in the ])rose- 
cution of his work. Advance editions of two papers by 1 )r. Mearns have 
been published during the year, one of which is entitled "Preliminary 
diagnoses of new mammals from the Mexican border of the United 
States," and the other " Preliminary description of a new subgenus and 
six new species and subspecies of hares from the Mexican boundary of 
the United States.'' 

In the department of birds Mr. D. G. Elliot, of the Field Columbian 
Museum, was engaged for a time in certain investigations; Mr. L. M. 
Loomis, of the California Academy of Sciences, studied various Pacific 
Coast species of Shearwaters, Gulls, and, Horned Owls; Dr. Louis P. 
Bishop, New Haven, Conn., studied the Western Night Hawks, Bit- 
terns, Horned Larks, Song Sparrows, etc., in connection with speci- 
mens which he collected in North Dakota; Mr. G. S. Miller, jr., of this 
city, made an examination of the Mexican Jays of the genua A]ph el o soma; 
Mr. Witmer Stone, of the Academy of Natural Sciences of PhiladeliJhia, 
inquired into the status of various Horned Owls; Mr. H. C. Oberholser, 
of the Department of Agriculture, made an investigation of the Downy 
W oodiyeckavs, {Dri/ohates puhescens and subspecies) and arranged several 
families of neotroj)ical Passeres in the study series; Mr. R. M. Ander- 
son, Forest City, Iowa, spent two or three days in examining species of 
North American birds, and Mr. J. H. Riley and Mr. C. G. Rorebeck, 
Falls Church, Va., were occupied for several months in performing volun- 
teer work and in familiarizing themselves with the birds of North 
America. 

Although no one has been engaged in a regular course of study in 
the department of mollusks, many persons have been permitted to 
examine specimens in the study collection, and have received verbal 
information from the curator or his assistants. Dr. R. R. Gurley having 
been requested by the Hon. C. D. Walcott, Director of the United 
States Geological Survey, to prepare a monograph of the American 
Graptolites, all the facilities which the Museum affords in this direction 
were placed at his disposal. Prof, Alpheus Hyatt, Cambridge, Mass., 
spent some time at the Museum, in April, looking over the Paleozoic 
Cephalopoda, and Prof. H. F. Osborn, of the American Museum of 
Natural History, studied the skulls of Titanotherium. 

Miss Etta Braly and Miss Amanda Braly were engaged for about two 
months comparing the insects collected by them in Arkansas with spe- 
cies in the Museum collection. The former had in view the preparation 
of a list of the Coleoptera found in that State, and the latter the prep- 
aration of a list of the Hemiptera.

MEETINGS OF ASSOCIATIONS IN WASIIIN(iTON DURING THE YEAR.. 

On September 5, 1895, the Society of Agricultural Chemists met in 
the lecture hall of the Museum. The sessions extended over three 
days. 

The American Ornithologists' Union met on November 12 and held 
three sessions on that day and the day following. 

The eleventh annual meeting of the American Historical Association 
was held in Washington on December 2(1 and 27.' 

On January 2, 189G, the second annual meeting of the National 
Science Club opened.' 

A lecture was delivered in the oftice of tlie Assistant Secretary, on 
March 10, by Rear Admiral S. Makaroff, of the Russian Navy, on '' The 
specific gravity of the waters of the North Pacific Ocean." 

The National Academy of Sciences has for some years held its annual 
meeting in the Museum building. The sessions for the xjresent year 
lasted from April 21 to 24. Tiie business meetings were held in one of 
the otlices and the lectui^e hall was used for the public meetings.' 

A lecture to the pupils of the High School of Washington on 
"India" was delivered in the lecture hall of the Museum on May 22 
by Mr. IT. N. Wilson. 

The Saturday lectures were continued during the season of 1896 
under the auspices of the joint commission of the scientific societies of 
Washington. The subjects of these lectures are given in Appendix 
VII. ISIany of the lectures were illustrated by the stereopticon, and 
others by maps, diagrams, and specimens. The series delivered during 
this year was arranged with a view to illustrating the relations of 
life to environment. Two courses were provided, the first i)ertaining 
chietiy to vegetal and aninuil life, the second to human life in its rela- 
tions to lower organisms and to the inorganic world. The five lectures 
constituting the second course were printed in the Appendix to the

Under an order issued by the President on May 6, 1896, the ISTational 
Museum was made subject to the law regulating appointments and 
promotions in the civil service of the United States. 

NEW MUSEUM BinLDING-. 

On December 10, 1895, Senator Morrill introduced a bill for the 
erection of an additional building for the use of the National Museum. 
This bill was referred to the Committee on Public Buildings and 
Grounds, and favorably reported on February 27, 1896. An amend- 
ment embodying the substance of the bill was afterwards made to the 
Sundry Civil bill, but was not retained. 

COTTON STATES AND INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION.

NECROLOGY. 

Prof. Charles Valentine Kiley, lionorary curator of tlie department 
of insects in the United States National Museum, died September 14, 
18!>5, 

The following is an extract from a biographical sketch by the Assist- 
ant Secretary, read at the annual meeting of the Joint Commission of 
the Scientific Societies of Washington, January 18, 189G, and afterwards 
published in Science:' 

Professor Riley was born in Chelsea, London, September 18, 1843. His schoolboy 
(lays were passed in France and Germany, and he was but 17 when his restless spirit 
led him to America. 

" He went West and settled with Mr. G. H. Edwards, whom he had met in London 
and who had made arrangements to open a stock farm in Kankakee County, 111. 
Here, during three years, he accjuired that experience of Western agriculture that 
can be gained only by farm work. Fond of all life as manifested on the farm, young 
Riley devoted himself enthusiastically to the calling he had chosen. Of an inquiring 
and experimental turn of mind, he aimed to improve on the methods in vogue, and 
soon won the esteem of all who knew him; and, though so young, was sought for in 
couu.sel and honored at public gatherings, at which he became intimate with Emory 
Cobb and other prominent farmers of Illinois. Under these circumstances, and with 
a deep love of nature in all her manifestations, it was no wonder that Professor 
Riley, as we have heard him avow, looked back to the farming days in Illinois as the 
happiest of his life. 

"Tlie exi)erience gained on the farm enabled him, more than anything else, to 
understand the ])Osition and needs of the farmer. In writing of Professor Riley's 
farm life and the reasons why he abandoned it, a Kankakee friend who knew him 
well remarks: 'Young Riley was simply too enthusiastic and too bent on excelling 
in everything. He took no rest. Often he would be up, actually getting breakfast 
ready, to relieve the women folk, and milk half a dozen cows, before the others were 
about. When others were resting at noon in the shade, he would be working at his 
flowers under a .July sun. There was not a sick animal of the three hundred on 
the place that he did not understand and help. He kept a lot of bees, got hold of 
the best bred colts, and some of the best heifers in the county, secured a good 
quarter-section, and 8i)ent his Sundays reading, sketching, and studying insects. 
Three years of this unceasing effort under the trying climatic extremes of central 
Illinois broke the young fellow's health, for it was a great contrast to his previous 
life, and with every one telling him that he was wasting his talents, he finally con- 
clnded to give up the idea of farming. But had his health not failed him, my opinion 
is that he would be a farmer to-day, and a successful one too, for he has intense 
love of rur.il life.' 

"He went to Chicago in his twentieth year, with no definite trade or profession 
and with little experience of city life. Money was scarce among farmers in those 
days, and his little property was so invested that it was not available. The trials 
of liis first few months in Cliicago are familiar to only a few of his intimate friends, 
but the manner in whieli he overcame them while yet in poor health was character- 
istic. Pride prevented him from asking help from his Kankakee friends, but did 
not prevent liim from donning blue overalls and doing manual labor in a pork- 
packing establishment, or from adding to his slender income by making portraits of 
fellow boarders, or sketches which he himself disposed of at evening in the abodes 
• >r wealth on Michigan avenue. After a while he obtained an engagement as a 
reporter on the Evening Journal, but finally became connected with the Prairie 



' Vol. Ill (N. S. ), No. .59, 1896, pp. 1-8. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 47 

Fanner, then the leading agricultnral paper of the West. Besides a close applica. 
tion to the d\ities of his position as reporter, delineator, and editor of the entomo- 
logical department of this paper, he devoted his time and energies to the study of 
botany and entomology. His industry and versatility soon made him not only 
popular with his associates upon the paper, but gave him a widespread reputation 
as a writer upon natural history, es])ecially on his specialty of economic entomology, 
the importance of which he soon made apparent."' 

His adventurous teinperament led him to enlist as a private in the One hundred 
and thirfy-fourth Illinois ^'olunteers, in which he served for several months during 
the civil war, in Kentucky and Tennessee. 

Before entering the army he had made the acquaintance of the man whom he 
joined in 1868 in establishing the American Entomologist. This friend, who was 
senior editor until his death, was Dr. Benjamin D. Walsh, State Entomologist of Illi- 
nois, and it was Walsh to whom Riley always alluded as his master and the man 
to whom he Avas most indebted for his early training and inspiration. Mr. Walsh 
was a graduate of the University of Cambridge, in the class with Darwin, a man of 
weight and scholarly attainments and a most careful and i)aiustaking investigator. 
During the lew years of his residence in Illinois he had done much to develop the 
interest in economic entomology, which resulted in the establishment of the jiosition 
of State Entomologist of Missouri in 1868, which was the beginning of Riley's 
public labors. 

An important outgrowth of Riley's personal activity' in connection with his ofBcial 
work was the formation of the Riley collection of insects, npou which he began 
immediately after he left the army in 1864, and which at the end of twenty-five years 
included over 20,000 species and over 115,000 mounted specimens, besides much 
other material. Tlie collection is in many respects nnijue, especially so because of 
the complete manner in which the life-history of numerous individual species is 
represented. It is the legitimate outgrowth and complement of Riley's investiga- 
tions, and is a voucher for the accuracy and fullness of his jjcrsonal work in ento- 
mology. This collection he gave in 1882, without condition, to th(^ National Museum, 
at that time without a collection of insects. His jiurpose in doing this was to place 
in the Museum a worthy nucleus, and to be instrumental in the formation of a col- 
lecti(m which would be worthy of the nation. He was ap])ointed at once honorary 
curator of the department of insects in the Museum, and gave much attention to the 
department, Avhich thereafter made rapid advan<'es. 

It was as an economic entomidogist that Riley was most widely famed. In this 
field he was eminent in two respects — in administration as well as in his direct 
contributions to the science of practical entomcdogy, and to the art which is its 
outgrowth. 

As an administrator, he was associated with three prominent undertakings: The 
entomological work of the State of Missouri, the United States Entomological Com- 
mission, and the establishment of the Division of Entonu)logy of the Department of 
Agriculture. 

He held the position of entomologist to the State of Missouri for nearly ten years, 
entering upon this work at the age of 23. 

The United States Entomological Commission was in existence for five years, Riley 
having been its chief from the beginning. 

"We all remember," said the Pacific Rural Press in 1887, "the sad experiences 
which our Western States and Territories passed through from 1873 to 1877, from 
locust or grasshopper ravages, which resulted in destitution and precipitated a 
financial crisis. These ravages seiiously afiected the western portion of his own 
State, and Professor Riley took hold of the problem with that originality and vigor 
which have characterized all of his work. His last three reports to the State con- 
tain the first positive and accurate knowledge on the subject that has been published. 

' Colman's Rural World. St. Louis. May 12, 1892. 



48 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

I'.iit lie early saw that the subject was oue of natioual importance aud could not he 
lully dealt with by work in any one State. To feel a necessity was sufficient for 
him to act, and consequently we find him, in public lectures, in leading articles, 
llirough resolutions od'ored at societies' meetings, memorials to Congress, and in 
every other way urging the creation of a National Entomological Commission. After 
various hills had been introduced and discussed. Congress finally created the Ento- 
mological Conuui8si(Ui, with a special view to investigating the Rocky Mountain 
Locust, or so-called grassho])per, aud Professor Riley was tendered the position as 
chief of the Counnission, a distinction which his investigations into this insect had 
justly earned, for he had already not only made most important discoveries as to its 
habits and the best means of suhduing it, but had ascertained sundry laws that 
govern it, so as to be able to predict the time of its coming and going and the limits 
of its spread. Consulted by Secretary Schurz as to the other appointments, it is no 
wonder that the members chosen were Dr. A. S. Packard, jr., a naturalist of eminence, 
ou<' of the finest entomologists of the world, and a prominent author and editor, and 
Prof. Cyrus Thomas, who had likewise labored for the creation of the Commission, 
and who was the authority on the family of insects to which the locusts belonged. 
Hoth of these gentlemen, like Professor Riley, had been chosen by their respective 
States as official entomologists, and had a large personal experience in the West. 
Accepting charge of the Commission thus constituted in March, 1877, we find Riley 
traveling that year over most of the western country, from the Gulf to the South 
Saskatchawan, in British America, now in company with the governor of the State, 
and again with other special officials, but everywhere exhorting the farmers to 
action, making careful observations and experiments, and inspiring confidence." 

He was tlie first to demonstrate the practicability of checking the ravages of an 
important species of insect by enlisting the aid of the insect enemies which had kept 
it in check in its native habitat. This was effected by the introduction from Aus- 
tralia in 1888, at his instance and by two agents sent out from his office, of the 
Australian Vedalia, a species of lady-bird, which is the natural enemy of the "Fluted 
Scale," an insect which had found its way from southern Australia to California, 
and was fast destroying the orange and lemon groves. 

His studies in connection with rhijlloxerojihe French vine pest, although not more 
important than many others more purely American in interest, may well be referred 
to on accountof the attention which they attracted in France, aud the honors conferred 
upon him as a result. To hira is generally attributed the idea of reviving etiolated 
French vineyards by using certain American Phylloxera-proof stocks to graft upon. 

As long ago as 1873 the viue growers of France presented him with a gold medal, 
struck in recognition of his iuvestigations into the history of the Phyllojera. In 
1889, as a further proof of their appreciation of his services, they presented to him 
a beautiful statue in bronze, while the French Government conferred upon him the 
cross of the Legion of Honor. 

Associated prominently with his name are certain practical methods for the destruc- 
tion of insects : the use of kerosene emulsions to protect plants and trees from the 
attacks of suctorial insects, and the invention and iierfection, aided by Mr. W. S. 
liarnard, of a very ingenious series of mechanical devices for spraying insecticides 
and fungicides in a liquid form— often called the Riley system. 

The vast amouut of work wliich Professor Eiley accomplished is shown 
by the catalogue of his published papers, of which there are more than 
1,G()(), many of them of very considerable extent, and the whole equiva- 
lent to at least 20,000 octavo pages. 

Professor Riley bequeathed to the United States National Museum, 
tlirough a trustee, all entomological aud other natural history speci- 
ujens which had come into his possession during recent years. A 
hirge collection of his pamphlets, relating to the subject of entomology, 
lias been deposited in the Museum by Mrs. Kiley. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 49 

Mr. R. S. Matthews, aid in the departmeut of mammals, died on 
on November 13, 1895, in Atlanta, Ga., where he had been detailed for 
duty ill connection with the Cotton States and International liixposition. 
Although Mr. Matthews had been connected with the ^Museum only a 
short time, he had shown marked ability, and would have undoubtedly 
become a naturalist of prominence. 

Mr. II. Edward Earll, editor of the Proceedings and Bulletins, died 
on March 19, 1896, The following brief account of his life, prepared 
by the Assistant Secretary, is reprinted from Science:' 

Mr. Robert Edward Earll, who died on March 19, ;ifc Chevy Chase, near Washing- 
ton, was one of the oldest and most trnstcd members of the staff of the Smithsonian 
Institution, with whi(!h he had been connected in various capacities since 1877. He 
was born at Waukegan, 111., August 24, 1853, educated in the Waukegan public 
schools, the University of Chicago, and at the Northwestern University, where he 
was graduated in 1877 with the degree of B. S. He entered the service of the Fish 
Commission, under Professor Baird, as a fish culturist; in 1878 was transferred to 
thescientific staff, njid from 1879 to 1882 was engaged in the fisheries division of the 
Tenth Census. 

From 1885 to 1888 he was chief of the division of statistics in the Fish Oommission. 
He was sent in 1883 to the International Fisheries Exhibition in London, as a mem- 
ber of the staff of the Ignited States Commissiouer, and rendered very efficient serv- 
ice as executive ofiicer and deputy representative. His aptitude for exposition work 
was so fully demonstrated on this occasion that he has been designated chief execu- 
tive officer at all the expositions which have since been held, for the exhibits of the 
Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum — at Louisville and New Orleans in 
1S84 and 1885, Cincinnati in 1888, Chicago, in 1893, and Atlanta in 1895. At the time 
of his death ho had just completed the unpacking of the exhibits returned from the 
South. 

Since 1888 he had been connected with tlie National Museum, with the grade of 
curator, and for three years had been editor of the Proceedings and Bulletins of the 
Museum. 

He was recognized by his associates as a man of fine administrative ability, which, 
combined with great force of character, had brought him into the position of one of 
the most efficient exposition experts living. His unselfish devotion to his work and 
his absolute trustworthiness were ai)preciated by all who knew him, and he was 
exceedingly popular among his associates. 

Notwithstanding his constant occupation in executive work, he produced and 
published a considerable number of important papers in regard to the methods of 
the fisheries and the habits of -fishes. He was one of the best authorities upon the 
natural history of the shad and herring, and made exhaustive studies of the fishery 
statistics of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and of the Great Lakes. Several new 
fishes were discovered by him, one of which, an important food species of the south- 
ern coast, obtained by him at Charleston in 1881, is called in his honor Earll's hake, 
I'll yds carlii. He was also a skillful fish culturist, aud had much experience in the 
early experimental work in the propagation of the shad and in the establishment of 
the cod hatching station at Gloucester. 

He was a man of the purest personal character. His loss will be deeply fdt by 
many in Washington. By reason of his peculiar abilities aud his great experience, 
his death creates a void which it will V)e practically impossible to till.

III.— REVIEW OF WORK IN THE SCIENTIFIC 
DEPARTMENTS. 

During the early part of the fiscal year the curators of many of the 
(lei)artinents were engaged in completing the preparation of their 
exhibits for the Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta, 
Ga. This Exposition opened on September 18 and continued until the 
close of the year 1895. Another month or more was required for the 
return of the exhibits and their installation in the Museum, so that for 
at least one-half of the period covered by the present report the cura- 
tors were occupied more or less with Exposition matters. This is usually 
the case, however, during those years in which Expositions occur, and 
as the resulting disadvantages have been dwelt upon in previous 
reports, no extended reference to them need be made at this time. 
Nevertheless, it is gratifying to state that satisfactory progress has 
been made in all the departments, notwithstanding the dilhculties 
encountered. The record of the present year compares favorably with 
that of other years in which similar conditions existed. 

DEPARTMENT OP MAMMALS. 

As stated in the last Annual Eeport, the curator, Mr. F. W. True, was 
detailed in May, 1895, to accompany an expedition to Alaska and the 
adjacent islands for the purpose of studying the seal rookeries. While 
thus engaged he was attached to the stafi* of the United States Fish 
Commission. 

The most interesting accessions to tlie collections of this department 
have been received from Dr. W. L. Abbott, who for several years has 
forwarded very large and valuable collections of mammals, birds, etc., 
from various parts of Africa and Asia. Mis contributions in the present 
year consisted of valuable skins of lemurs and other small mammals 
from Madagascar, and a collection from Kashmir, including a stag and 
a musk. In all, ninety-two specimens were received from him. 

About forty skins of the very rare mole Neurotrichus gihbsii, from 
r>ritish Columbia, were purchased by the Museum. Eighty-eight mam- 
n)als from the Pribilof Islands, including fifteen fur-seals, were col- 
lected by the curator (while iu the service of the Fish Commission) and 
Mr. D. W. Prentiss, jr. A mounted skin of the Chile deer, (Jariaciis 
chilcnsis, was presented by the La Plata Museum. Lieut. Wirt Robin- 
son, U. S. A., collected fourteen small mammals in Margarita Island 
and La Guayra, Venezuela. These he kindly presented to the National 
50 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 51 

Museum. About fifty mammals, which died from the effects of confine- 
ment in the National Zoological Park, have been received. They were 
chiefly representatives of North American species. From Dr. E. A. 
Mearns, U. S. A., were received several small mammals from Fort Clark, 
Tex., and FortMyer, Va., and Prof= E. E. Call donated between three 
and four hundred bats, which he obtained from the Mammoth Cave in 
Kentucky. 

Mr. True states that, while the accumulations of the year included 
some very valuable specimens, so far as scientific value is concerned, 
the general average is probably below that of the last three or four 
years. The number of specimens received is also less. There were 
fifty different contributors, four of which were Government Bureaus. 
The total number of specimens received and entered was 1,048, includ- 
ing 3(55 bats of one or two species only. 

Very little work was accomplished in the exhibition hall, owing to 
the absence of the curator. A considerable number of specimens were 
withdrawn for exhibition at the Cotton States and International Expo- 
sition at Atlanta, but these were returned before the expiration of the 
fiscal year. 

Eegarding the study collections the curator says: 

The study series lias not degeuerated, so far as I am aware. A large unmber of 
skins liave been taken from the vats and made np dry, and many old but valuable 
skius liave been made over. From the want of an nssistant, little has been done 
towards classifying and putting away the larger skins. 

There are still many skins of the larger species which are in very bad form for 
study purposes and ought to be made over, so that they can be handled. At present 
they are stored in boxes. 

New cases were provided in the third-story laboratory, but little has yet been put 
into them. 

Some progress was made in transferring the valuable study series of small skulls 
from trays to boxes, but more remains to be done. 

The alcoholics have been looked after and roughly classified in the alcohol room, 
but the lack of an assistant made it impossible to do much in that direction. 

A pai^er entitled "lievision of the American Moles,'' by the curator, 
was completed and sent to press during the year. He has also con- 
tinued his work on the "Antlers of the Deer Family," although this 
has been constantly interrupted by special assignment to executive 
duties. 

The curator calls attention in his rei)ort to several explorations 
which have resulted in the acquisition of some very desirable material. 
Tlius, Mr. D. W. Prentiss, jr., was detailed to accompany the curator 
to tbe Pribilof Islands, Alaska, in the summer of 1895, and in the 
three months spent there they collected eighty-eight mammals, a large 
number of plants, some anatomical specimens, insects, birds, and other 
natural-history objects. Among the mammals are fifteen fur-seals of 
varying ages, including a very fine old bull. Dr. W. L. Abbott, who has 
continued his travels in Ivaslimir, sent some very interesting mammals 
to the Museum from that country. He also made a collecting trip in 
southeastern Madagascar, and as a result a splendid series of skins of 



52 HEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

lemurs and of the insectivores peculiar to that island were added to 
the Museum collections. Prof. R. E. Call explored the caves of Ken- 
tucky and obtained in the Mammoth Cave a large number of bats for 
the Museum. Mr. William Palmer made an expedition to the Dismal 
Swamj), Virginia, and collected a few mammals. 

It is pleasant to refer here to the enthusiastic cooperation of Dr. 
E, A. Mearns, U. S. A. Both in the field and in the laboratory his 
energies and intelligent aid have been of very great value to the 
Museum. 

Three papers based upon collections made by Dr. Mearns and Mr. F. 
X. Holzner have been published by the Museum. These contain 
descriptions of eighteen new species and subspecies. 

The curator thus outlines the general course which it seems desir- 
able to follow in the future in connection with the development of this 
department : 

The collcf'tious of mnmmals made by the Department of Agricnltnre in the last 
few years being cited in the publications of that Department as belonging to the 
National ^luseum, it is taken for granted that they do now and always will form a 
part of the Government collections of the Museum. Such being the case, it seems 
inadvisable to spend money in procuring North American mammals at this time, 
except of such species as are not collected by the Department of Agriculture or of 
which siieciiiiens are needed for exhibition purposes. 

On the other baud, all kinds of foreign mammals are greatly to be desired. The 
tendency of work in America at present is to follow broader lines than hitherto, and 
the foreign species are needed for comparison with our own. 

We ought to be on the lookout, furthermore, to secure specimens of large foreign 
species which are threatened with extinction. Some which were obtainable twenty- 
five years ago are no longer to be had. 

Additions to the groups of North American mammals are in view, 
but there is great discouragement in this direction, it being impossible 
at the present time to find exhibition space for five groups already pre- 
l)ared. A fur-seal group is now being provided for. 

Mr. True, in addition to his duties as curator of mammals, has served 
during the year as chairman of the Committee on Publications, and 
has freipiently been (tailed upon to act as Executive Curator in matters 
affecting the general administration of the Museum. 

The department suffered a severe loss in the death of Mr. R. S. 
Matthews, wlii(;li occurred on November 13, 1895. 

The appended statement shows the number of specimens in the col- 
lection and the number of catalogue entries made during the year:

DEPARTMENT OF BIRDS. 

During' the year just closed a large proportion of the time of the 
curator, Mr. Eobert liidgway, lias been devoted to the prosecution of 
his work on the "Birds of Xorth and Middle America." In a special 
report regarding the progress of this work he makes the following 
statement: 

There have been completed during the year the synonymy, family diagnoses, and 
concomitant matter peitainiug to 54 families, 335 genera, and 1,C61 species. During 
the preceding period since the work was commenced 15 families, 165 genera, and 747 
species were covered. 

This statement does not by any means show the proportion of the work which has 
actually been completed, since a large number of genera and individual species, 
thoroughly "worked up" in other connections, are in shape for the printer. How 
many and what proportion of the whole these would repiesent, it is, however, impos- 
sible to estimate. 

At the present rate of progress the syuonymatic portion of the worlv will be com- 
pleted by December, 1896 — possibly sooner. Much of the most difficult portion of 
the task will then be out of the way. In the meantime a detcrunncd etl'ort will be 
made to thoroughly rearrange the collection, so as to facilitate access to the speci- 
mens, and then the tiuishing touches will be given the work without unnecessary 
delay. 

Other investigations carried on by the curator included a study of the 
genera of the Tringillidji'; a study of the affinities of Procnias viridis; 
a partial compilation of a list of type specimens in the dej)artment of 
birds; determinations of some-(Talapagos species, of a species of Peuee- 
dramiis from Guatemala, and of a species of Geothlypis from Mexico. 
He also prepared a paper on the birds collected by Dr. W. L. Abbott 
in the Seychelles and other islands near Madagascar. The curator was 
detailed for two months in southern Florida, for the purpose of studying" 
the bird life of that region. 

The routine work has devolved very largely on Mr. Charles W. 
Eichmond, assistant curator. The latter has determined collections of 
birds made by Dr. W. L. Abbott in Kashmir, in eastern Turkestan, and 
in Madagascar. He has also commenced the study of a collection of 
birds from East Africa, a collection of birds from Margarita Island, 
Venezuela, made by Lieut. Wirt Kobinson, and a series from eastern 
Mexico. 

The number of specimens received during the year was about 3,000 



54 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

in excess of the receipts for the preceding year, the number of acces- 
sions or "lots" of material having been eighty-six. The scientific 
value of the accessions for the year just closed exceeded that for the 
year 1894-95, including, as they did, a rare and extinct parrot [Nestor 
product us), presented by Dr. W. L. Ralph; one species doubtfully 
extinct, many types of new species, and a number of rare specimens. 
Si)ecimens or collections of unusual importance have been received from 
more than forty individuals and establishments during the year. The 
list of important contributors for the preceding year was headed by 
]\Ir, A. Boucard, Isle of Wight, England. He has been a very gener- 
ous contributor, having presented during this year more than 2,800 
specimens from various parts of the world. His liberality toward the 
IMuseum is very highly appreciated. 

Among other important accessions the following may be mentioned: 
From Dr. W. L. Abbott, 217 specimens, representing 83 species, from 
Madagascar, and 67 specimens, mainly eagles and hawks, from Kashmir 
(gift); Lieut. Wirt Robinson, United States Army, 167 specimens from 
Margarita Island, Venezuela, and Bogota, Colombia, including types of 
11 species (gift); Rev. H. T. Heyde, 1404 Erato street, New Orleans, 
La., 183 bird skins from Central America (j)urchase); H. P. Attwater, 
San Antonio, Tex., 367 specimens from Texas (purchase) ; Dr. A. Fenyes, 
H('louan, Egypt, 79 specimens from Egypt (gift) ; 190 birds collected 
by Robert Ridgway, in Florida and other States, for the U. S. National 
Museum; S. Daunefaerd, New Zealand, 9 specimens from Chatham 
and Snares Islands (purchase); F. Stephens, Witch Creek, Cal., type 
of i^peotyto cunicularia obscura (gift); William Brewster, Cambridge, 
Mass., 141 specimens from Mexico and Lower California (gift); Charles 
E. Kern, Washington, I). C, 85 specimens from Costa Rica and Nica- 
ragua (gift) ; F. W. True, U. S. National Museum, and D. W. Pren- 
tiss, jr., Washington, D. C, 142 specimens collected in Alaska; Richard 
C. McGregor, Palo Alto, Cal., 119 birds from California and Colorado. 

The material received during the year has been catalogued and dis- 
tributed in the various series of the collection, and a considerable 
number of unidentified species have been determined. Mr. J. H. Riley, 
of Falls Church, Va., gave his services gratuitously for about six 
months, during which time valuable assistance was rendered in the 
matter of cataloguing. Mr. H. C. Oberholser, of the Department of 
Agriculture, has been engaged for a year or more in rearranging the 
neotropical seriesyand several families of Passeres have received atten- 
tion. This work is also done gratuitously, and has been performed out- 
side of office hours. 

Mr. Ridgway states that a large amount of incidental work has 
been performed, sucli as furnishing information of a technical character 
in response to requests received through the mail; the preparation of a 
card catalogue of the sectional library; the preparation of data relat- 
ing to the type material in the department, and the reading of proof 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 55 

and the verification of references in the Bibliography of Dr. P. L. Sclater, 
wliieh ^Yill shortly be published by the Museani as No. 49 of tlio Bulletin. 

A number of additional cases for the storage of specimens have been 
provided. Several of these cases will be placed in the west basement, 
and the remainder in the gallery. The extensive additions to the col- 
lections during the last two or three years have rendered an entire 
rearrangement necessary. Such a readjustment is made the more 
urgent by the fact that the collections in the west basement are more 
or less inaccessible, and to some extent exposed to the ravages of 
insects. Tliat portion of the study series which is installed in the 
bird gallery is in good condition. 

The material exhibited at the Cotton States and International Expo- 
sition at Atlanta was returned and placed in position during the year. 

Mr. Richmond made a collecting trip to Smiths Island, Va., and Mr. 
William Palmer, chief taxidermist, collected birds in Florida. Exjdo- 
rations resulting in additions to the collections have also been under- 
taken by twenty-four other persons, the names of some of them having 
already been mentioned in this review. The names of the others will 
be found in the accession list (Appendix ii). 

Material for investigation has been sent to thirteen different individ- 
uals and establishments, and eight persons not connected with the 
^luseum have visited the building and made use of the collections. 

Thirty-six ])apers based ui)on material in this department have been 
published during the year by the curator, assistant curator, and other 
collaborators. In these pa])ers one new family, four new genera, and 
thirty-four new species and subspecies are described. 

The number of specimens received, including those added to the 
Department of Agriculture collection, was 8,488. This is the first year 
in which any large number of specimens from the Department of Agri- 
culture' have been entered. Although the material is the property of 
the Museum, it is, as a matter of convenience, installed and catalogued 
separately for the present. The total number of specimens in the col- 
lection is now over 80,000. The addition of the duplicates would bring 
the figures uj) to about 100,000. 

The catalogue entries for the year were as follows:

DEPARTMENT OF BIRDS' EGGS. 

The honorary curator of this department, Maj. Charles Bendire, 
states that the number of accessions was slightly less than during the 
preceding year, but that the scientific value of the material received 



56 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

during both years was about e(iual. The largest accession was from 
Dr. W. L. Ralph, Ttica, N. Y., who has long been regarded as one of 
the most valued contributors to the Museum. This collection con- 
sisted of 88 nests and 911 eggs, representing 206 species. Other 
important contributions were received from the following: Dr. James 
C. Merrill, United States Army, Fort Sherman, Idaho, 6 nests and 99 
eggs, representing 12 species; Lieut. Wirt Eobiuson, United States 
Army, Cambridge, Mass., 5 nests and 65 eggs, representing 14 species; 
Unitid States Fish Commission steamer Albatross, through Mr. F. W. 
True and D. W. Prentiss, jr., 35 specimens, representing 10 species; 
Elmer J. Judd, Cando, N. Dak., 25 eggs, representing 3 species; 
United States Department of Agriculture, 32 specimens, representing 
8 species. Twenty-eight eggs and 6 nests were purchased from Mr. 
H. P. Attwater, San Antonio, Tex. 

All of the material received has been properly catalogued and 
labeled, and the exhibition and study series are in excellent condition. 
It would be very desirable to increase the former if the necessary- 
space were available. 

The honorary curator mentions the names of thirty-five persons 
whose cooperation has resulted in enriching the collections. The 
Department of Agriculture and the United States Fish Commission 
have also made valuable contributions to the collections of this 
department. 

The number of eggs received during the year was 1,729, and of nests 
154. The last catalogue entry in June, 1895, was 27655, and in June, 
1896, 28138. 

DEPARTMENT OF REPTILES AND BATRACHIANS. 

As stated in the last annual report, the curator of this department. 
Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, was detailed in the s[)riug of 1895 to accom- 
pany a Government exi)edition to Alaska and the adjacent islands for 
the 5>urpose of studying the seal rookeries. Dr. Stejneger was absent 
for a considerable portion of the fiscal year covered by the present 
report, and in June, 1896, he again left for the north, having been 
appointed by the President a member of a special commission, author- 
ized by joint resolution of Congress, to investigate the condition of 
the seal herds. For these reasons the regular operations of the 
department of reptiles and batrachians have been considerably inter- 
fered with. 

The number of specimens received and entered on the catalogue has 
been smaller than during the preceding fiscal year, although this is 
partially accounted for by the fact that the year last referred to was one 
of unusual activity. The scientific value of the material is no less in 
proportion than that attaching to the accessions of the previous year, 
some very interesting collections having been received from South 
America and Madagascar, as well as from various parts of the United 
States. Eight specimens of a blind batrachian from an artesian well 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 57 

at Sau Marcos, Tex., were received from tlie United States Fish Com- 
mission. They represent a new genus and si^ecies, described by Dr. 
Stejneger as Typhlomolge rathhunl. This is regarded as one of the 
most remarkable herpetological discoveries of recent years. Other 
accessions by gift inchided one from Dr. W. L. Abbott, consisting of a 
series of reptiles collected by him in Madagascar, and one from Lieut. 
Wirt llobinson, United States Army, consisting of a collection of rei)- 
tiles and batrachians from La Guayra arid Margarita Island. A series 
of reptiles and batrachians from Argentina was received from the 
Museo de la Plata, in exchange. 

The curator's visit to the islands in Bering Sea yielded very little in 
the way of collections for this department, owing to the absence of 
batrachians and reptiles in the localities visited. A specimen of a 
rare salamander [SalamandreJla tcofisessenslcii) was, however, obtained 
in Kamchatka. It is the only si)ecies occurring there, and had not 
been previously represented in the Museum collection. Mr. F. W. True 
secured some si)ecimens of snakes and toads on Vancouver Island, and 
an interesting collection of snakes from the Dismal Swamp, Virginia, 
was obtained by Mr. William Palmer of the National Mnseum. 

Kegarding the condition of the various series in the department, the 
curator says: 

The collectiou was gone over systemnticiilly several times, and the alcohol 
' strengthened and leplenibhed as reiiuired. The exhibition series still consists only 
of the separate casts, the yellow-boa gronp and the gronp of North American turtles 
and poisonous snakes. The study series is divided into the North American series, 
the exotic series and the duplicates. The former are all in separate jars and bot- 
tles ; a portion of the exotic series is still in storage jars, while most of the duplicates 
are kept in tanks. 

Owing to the prolonged absence of the curator, and the fact that 
after his return he has been engaged principally in bringing the routine 
work up to date, but little has been done in the way of conducting spe- 
cial investigations upon the material under his care, beyond the descrip- 
tion of the new genus and species of batrachian already referred to. 

Specimens have been sent to a number of individuals for study, 
as indicated in the chapter devoted to transactions of that character, 
and special facilities were accorded to Prof. E. D. Cope for study- 
ing material in the department in connection with his forthcoming 
monograph. 

Among those whose cooperation has been of value to this department 
mention should be made of Mr. Julius Hurter, St. Louis Mo., and Mr. 
W. L. Sherwood, New York City. 

Four papers based upon Museum material have been published by 
the curator during the year. 

There were 329 specimens received and entered, the last number in 
the catalogue on June 30, 1895, being 21*482, and on June 30, 189G, 
22811. The total number of specimens in the collection is estimated 
at over 35,000. 



58 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

DEPARTMENT Ol'^ FISHES. 

Tlie number of accessions to the department of fishes during the 
year was not so great as during the preceding year. Their scientific 
value was also somewhat less. A collection of fishes from Nebraska, 
Wyoming, and South Dakota was received from the United States 
Fish Commission 5 also from the same source a collection of types of 
fishes froni the Albatross collections in the North Pacific, as well as 
some material obtained by the same vessel in that locality and in 
Bering Sea in 1890 and 1891. A collection made by Dr. Leonhard 
Stejnegeriu Bering Sea and the vicinity of Kamchatka deserves special 
notice. A few specimens obtained from the Island of Yesso by Mr. 
Cirebnitzki were also received. 

The honorary curator of the department, Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, is 
still in New York City, as superintendent of the New York Aquarium. 

Mr. Barton A. Bean, the assistant curator, states that during the 
year the collections have been carefully attended to, the bottled speci- 
mens having been kept covered with alcohol, and the old labels replaced 
by new ones where necessary. The collections on the shelves in the 
fish hall have been condensed by placing several specimens of the 
same species in one jar. Considerable additional shelf space was thus 
secured. Some large and valuable collections resulting from exjilora- 
tions in the North Pacific by the steamer Albatross were installed 
during the year. An unusually large number of specimens were dis- 
tributed, including several sets of deep-sea fishes, which were sent to 
some of the principal museums in Europe. 

Tlie honorary curator and assistant curator have prepared reports 
upon the fishes collected in the vicinity of the Commander Islands by 
Dr. Leonhard Stejneger and Mr. N. Grebnitzki ; also npon the fishes 
collected by the latter in Kamchatka and Japan. At the close of the 
fiscal year Dr. Bean had in course of preparation a report upon the 
fishes collected in 1887-88 by the Albatross, in South American waters. 
Mr. Barton Beau is assisting in this work. 

In January, 1890, Messrs. B. W. Evermann and W. A. Wilcox, of 
the United States Fish Commission, and Mr. Barton Bean, made au 
investigation of the fish and fisheries of Indian Eiver, Florida. A 
report upon these investigations was made to the United States Senate. 

Among the explorations which have resulted in enriching the collec- 
tions, those already referred to indirectly were probably of the most 
importance, namely, those of the steamer Albatross, in the North 
Pacific, of field ])arties sent out by the Fish Compiission to the western 
portion of the United States, and the expedition to Florida. A small 
collection was also made by Eev. P. H. Sorensen, in Greenland. 

Material has been sent out for study on a number of occasions, and 
several ichthyologists have examined the collections in the Museum 
laboratory. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 59 

Dr. Theodore Gill, Associate in Zoology, has published a number of 
papers on fishes during the year. These are based upon Museum 
material, some of them containing descriptions of new species. De- 
scriptive papers, based on the collections, have also been published by 
other collaborators. 

Strenuous efforts will be made to improve the condition of the collec- 
tions by setting aside surplus or duplicate material. The preparation 
of an exhibit of deep-sea fishes, from 1,000 feet and lower, is contem- 
plated. This exhibit, it is expected, will prove of great interest. 

About 3,000 specimens were received during the year, the catalogue 
entries embracing Nos. 47505 to 47687, inclusive. The total number of 
specimens in the collection is estimated at 150,000. 

DEPARTMENT OF MOLLUSKS. 

The honorary curator. Dr. W. H. Dall, states that there was a slight 
increase in the number of accessions during the year, the total having 
been 118, while the total for 1894-95 was 111. On the whole, the year 
has not been marked by anything unusual in the growth of the collec- 
tions, although many valuable specimens were added. An excellent 
local collection of shells from Texas, made by Mr. J. A. iSingley, was 
purchased with funds supplied by Dr. L. T. Chamberlain, of New York 
City. Many very valuable foreign Unios, and other specimens new 
to the collection, were derived from the same source. In addition, 
some works have been purchased for the sectional library during the 
year through Dr. Chamberlain's generosity. Others who have steadily 
contributed to the collections in this department, and who are thereby 
entitled to be regarded as regular contributors, are Hon. J. D. Mitchell, 
Victoria, Tex., who presented a number of species of Unios and other 
specimens from his locality; Mr. and Mrs. T. S. Oldroyd, Los Angeles, 
Cal. ; Mr. F. F. Crevecoeur, Onaga^ Kans., who sent in a number of 
species of land and fresh- water shells; Mr. Henry Hemphill, San Diego, 
Cal., from whom between thirty and forty species of marine mollusks 
from San Diego, and other material, was received; Mr. P. B. Eandolph, 
Seattle, Wash., who sent many specimens from his locality; Dr. C. F. 
jSTewcombe, Victoria, B. C, from whom marine shells were received; 
and Dr. W. L. Abbott, who sent material from eastern Madagascar. 
The addition of greatest importance was the Fish Commission mate- 
rial transferred from the Peabody Museum, New Haven, Conn. This 
material has been in the hands of Prof. A. E. Verrill for some years 
for study, and is now being gradually transmitted to the National 
Museum. 

As stated elsewhere, the exhibition series is in good condition, and 
much has been done in connection with the study series. The excel- 
lent system adopted in the installation and registration of these collec- 
tions will be fully appreciated only when the entire work has been 
completed. 



60 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

This matter is thus referred to by Dr. Dall: 

The outry of additions to the collection in the register of the department has been 
carried on as usual. The principal item of work accomplished during the year has 
been the tliorough revision of the basement storage room, in which alcoholics and 
duplicates are kept. All the bottles have been cleaned and filled up, when necessary, 
with additional alcohol, the contents catalogued, and each bottle given a number 
reierring to the catalogue, which has been made on cards arranged alphabetically, 
so that by reference to the cards it can at once be seen whether any particular species 
is on hand in spirits. If so, the bottle can be reached in a moment, the jars being 
arranged in numerical order on the shelves. In cases Avhere there was an excessive 
amount of material in alcohol, the excess has been removed, dried, and cleaned, and 
placed in the series of dry duplicates, of which a similar card catalogue has been 
made, the specimens being placed in numbered covered boxes, so that by reference 
to the cards any species can be reached in a few moments. 

The iHimber of jars of alcoholic specimens catalogued so far is 2,002. 

The number of dry duplicates in boxes, catalogued, is 4,174 species or lots. All 
are in perfect order, and with a view to preserving the jars better from dust, which 
soils them and obscures the labels, the shelves have been provided with covers of 
enameled cloth. 

There is also a considerable namber of jars of alcoholics in the north tower, which 
it is hoped to catalogue and label in a similar manner during the coming year. 
When these are completed, the entire collection of alcoholics and duplicate recent 
shells will have been put into excellent order. 

Various installments of specimens have been received from Prof. A. E. Verrill dur- 
ing the year. These, as they were received, have been checked off on the lists, the 
species segregated, and transferred to the standard sizes of tubes and paper trays. I 
have deferred incorporating them with the reserve collection until the whole series 
shall be received, so as to make one job of the transfer, which even then will 
involve a great amount of work. 

The series of mounted specimens, illustrating the chief families of mollusks, which 
was prepared by Mr. Mars&all and Mr. Simpson for exhibition as part of tlie Museum 
material at the Atlanta Exposition, has beeu placed in one of the exhibition cases in 
the main hall. 

We have still a large amount of unregistered material, especially in the Jeffreys 
collection, which will be handled from timn to time, as opportunity serves, until all 
arrearages are made up ; but in the absence of expert assistance the progress in this 
direction will necessarily be slow. 

lu order to make sure that each specimen in the collection is cor- 
rectly identified, and to unify the nomenclature, a large amount of work 
will eventually be required. Work of this character must be per- 
formed by a specialist in each group. 

Dr. Dall states that he has completed a report upon the collections 
of land shells made during the progress of the Mexican Boundary 
Survey, by Dr. E. A. Mearns, United States Army. This collection 
contains the largest additions to our fauna of this region for many 
years. A number of additions to the fauna of the coast of Texas, col- 
lected by Hon. J. D. Mitchell, have been described or elucidated; also 
collections made at San Pedro, Cal., by Mr. and Mrs. T. S. Oldroyd, and 
in Puget Sound and vicinity, by Messrs. P. B. Randolph, of Seattle, 
and Dr. C. F. Newcombe, of A^ictoria, British Columbia. 

A discussion of the land shell faunas of volcanic oceanic islands, 
forming a report on the collections made at the Galapagos Islands, by 



REPOET OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 61 

Dr. G. Baiir, of the Chicago University, has been completed. The 
type specimens upon which it is based are in the Nation -1 Museum. 

Mr. Kobert John Lechiiiere CJuppy, Port of Spain, Trinidad, whose 
collection of Antillean fossils was purchased by the jMuseum some years 
ago, forwarded descriptions of some supposed new species, to be printed 
in the Troceedings, the types being part of the National Museum collec- 
tion. The new forms have been ligured, and a joint paper by Dr. Dall 
and Mr. Guppy, on Antillean Tertiary fossils, has been completed, and 
is now in the hands of the printer. 

Work on the Neocene fauna of Florida has been carried on as oppor- 
tunity served, and will be continued until the study is completed. Mr. 
Charles T. Simpson has continued his studies on the Naiades. The 
superficial anatomy of a considerable number of species has been exam- 
ined, and notes and descriptions prepared. Much time has been spent 
in searching the literature and preparing cards of synonymy for use 
in a synopsis of the Naiades. 

A number of persons have been engaged in making collections with 
a view to working out the fauna of their respective localities, submit- 
ting all puzzling or doubtful forms to the department for examination. 
These correspondents in most cases donate types of new or interesting 
material to the national collection. Explorations carried on by Hon. 
J. D. Mitchell, Victoria, Tex.; Dr. C. F. Newcombe, Victoria, British 
Columbia; Mr. P. B. Randolph, Seattle, Wash,, and Mrs. T. S. Oldroyd, 
Los Angeles, Cal., were especially productive of good results. Collec- 
tions were also made by F. F. Crevecoeur, Onaga, Kans. ; Dr. Charles 
L. G wyn, Galveston, Tex. ; J. A. Singley, Giddings, Tex., and the Young 
Naturalists' Society, Los Angele-:, Cal. Eeference has already been 
made to the material obtained. 

Dr. Dall states that during the year one hundred and forty applica- 
tions for the identification of specimens, for advice as to conchological 
literature, etc., were received from more than one hundred different 
individuals. The furnishing of this information involved the identifica 
tion of over three thousand species, and the writing of over one thou- 
sand pages of correspondence by the honorary curator and Mr. Simpson. 
It has always been the practice to grant requests for the identification 
of material, but the number of applications in recent years has been so 
great that it has become necessary to formulate a set of rules ^ by which 
individuals sending specimens for this purpose should be governed. 
In these regulations it is stipulated that the material must be sent free 
of expense to the Museum, unless otherwise agreed upon, and that the 
localities from which the specimens were obtained, must be given. The 
Museum reserves the right to retain, except under special arrange- 
ment, specimens needed to complete the national collection. 

No one, other than those connected with the staff, has been engaged 
in a regular course of study in the department. Probably as many as

a Iniiidred liavc, liowever, received verbal information or have been 
accoided the privilege of examining specimens in tlie stndy series. 

Twenty-cue papers, based upon material in the department, have been 
published by Dr. Dall, aud five by Mr. Charles T. Simpson. One paper 
has also been published by Mr. G. D. Harris. The titles of these 
papers appear in the Bibliography (Appendix iv), and in the supple- 
ments to the latter will be found the names of a large number of species 
described, as well as of one family and several new genera. 
• It is i)roposed to continue the work on the collections now in pro- 
gress until the arrears have been registered and catalogued, the Jef- 
freys and A'errill collections administered upon, and the duplicates 
eliminated iVom the reserve series. This will require a considerable 
amount of time, owing to the extreme piessure of current work. 

The total number of specimens received during the year, exclusive 
of fossils, was 3,173. The number of entries made in the regular cata- 
logues of recent mollusks was 5,440. The following paragraphs contain 
information as to the other clerical work performed, and also as to the 
present extent of the collections: 

Besides the entries iu tbe register of the reserve collection there have been 175 
entries in the register of drawings, 1,628 entries in the register of dnplicates, and 
3,630 entries on cards for card calalogues, showing a total of 12,103 entries of all 
kinds during the year ending June 30, 1896. 

The additions to the reserves sum up 20,010 specimens, making, when added to 
last year's figures, a total of 544,398 specimens in the reserve collection. A very 
low estimate of the number of duplicates will place them at 12,522 specimens. The 
apccimeiis in alcohol, already catalogued, amount to 20,020, while the unregistered 
material will add, when catalogued, about 28,000 specimens, making a grand total 
of about 600,000 specimens in the department of mollusks, exclusive of fossils. 

DEPARTMENT OF INSECTS. 

There have been several changes in the personnel of this department 
during the year. Prof. C. Y. liiley, who had served as honorary cura- 
tor since 1882, and who rendered very valuable service to the Museum, 
died on September 14, 1895. A biographical sketch of his life and 
work will be found under the head of Necrology. 

Mr. L. O. Howard, who succeeded Professor Eiley as entomologist of 
the Department of Agriculture, has been appointed honorary curator 
of the department of insects in the National Museum. Four honorary 
custodians have also been appointed during the year, each having 
charge of a special branch of work, as follows : Mr. W. H. Ashmead, the 
Hymenopteia; Mr. D. W. Coquillett, the Diptera; Prof. O.F.Cook, 
the Myriapoda, and Mr. E. A. Schwarz, the Coleopterous larva?. Mr. 
M. L. Linell continues to act as aid. 

The accessions during the year numbered one hundred and thirty- 
five, an increase of thirty six over tbe preceding year. It is believed 
that, taking the accessions as a whole, they were five times as valua-

ble as tbose received in 1894-95. The most important accessions were 
as follows : 

Collection of Aracbnida of Dr. George Marx, on deposit from Mrs. Minnie Marx.

The biological collections in Lepidoptera have been completely re- 
arranged in cabinet drawers, and the collection of Melanopli, lent by Dr. 
Scudder, and the African Lepidoptera, lent by Dr. Holland, were 
installed. A rearrangement of the North American Coleoptera has 
been commenced, the families Scaraba^idte and Cerambycida' having 
already been finished. The recent accessions of Hymenoptera and 
Lepidoptera have been incorporated in the collections. A portion of

the exbibition series is displayed in the lower hallway leading to the 
offices of the department. The systematic series, since its return from 
the (^otton States and International Exposition at Atlanta, has been 
placed upon exhibition, while the exotic showy insects prepared for 
the same Exposition have been distributed in the study collections. 
The reserve collections for study are, generally speaking, in good con- 
dition. In order to properly classify the Lepidoptera, however, much 
work must still be done. The types have not yet been catalogued 
excei)t in this order. 

A large amount of scientific work has been accomplished by the 
members of the staff during the year, as will be seen from the following 
extract from Mr. Howard's report : 

The curator lias published a revision of the Aphelinina; of North America, and a 
paper on the "Grass and Grain Joint-worm Flies and their Allies," in Technical 
Series Nos. 1 and 2, United States Department of Agriculture. These papers are 
based upon Museum material. He has also completed, but not yet published, a 
report on the Chalcididie of the Island of Grenada, and, conjointly -with Mr. Ash- 
mead, a brief paper on some reared parasitic Hynienoptera Irom Ceylon. 

Mr. Ashnicad has completed and published his report on the parasitic Hynienoptera 
of the Island of Grenada, comprising the families C'yuipida', Ichneumonidic, Braco- 
nida' and the Proctotrypidie, submitted by Ur. David Sharp on behalf of the com- 
mittee for investigating the flora and fauna of the West Indian islands. He has 
also described a new genus and two new si>ccie8 of Proctotrypidie from Trinidad, 
submitted by Mr. F. W. Urich; and in a paper published in the Transactions of 
the American Entomological Society, Pliiladel}ihia, .June, 1896, he described a large 
number of new parasitic Hynienoptera. During the year, besides rearranging some 
of the families of the Aculeate Hynienoptera and Hemiptera, he ideutitied several 
hundred species of Hemiptera and between two and three thousand species of 
Hymenojjtera for correspondents of the Department of Agriculture. Monographic 
work is also being done on the families Braconid;e, Cynipidie, and Chalcidida>. 

Mr. C'o(juillett has published a revision of the North American genera and species 
of Empida', in which four new genera and sixty-six new species are described. 
Types of all of these new forms are now in the National Museum. He has also 
identified the Culicidie in the National Museum, and described three new species 
in the Canadian Entomologist for February, 1896, and in a paper on the Diptera 
of Florida, published in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of 
Philadelphia for 1895, he described a new species of Plafyitra and one of Drosoplula 
from sjiecimens in the National Museum. He is now engaged in identifying the 
Tachinida' in the National Museum collection, and has nearly completed a monograph 
of the same. 

Mr. Linell has completed reports on the Japanese Coleoptera (Ace. 27851), on the 
Coleoptera of the Chanler and Ilohnel expeditions, and on the insects collected by 
Dr. W, L. Abbott on the Indian Islands, norfh of Madagascar. A restudy of the 
North American Coleoptera of the families Scaraha-ida' and Cerambycida- has resulted 
in two descriptive papers, now lieiug published in the Proceedings of the National 
Mnseum. 

Of the explorations which have resulted in enriching the collections, 
nearly all were confined to localities outside of the United States. The 
material obtained is referred to in the list of important accessions given 
above, and only a brief reference will therefore be made in this place. 
The British West India Committee for Zoological Exploration conducted 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 65 

explorations on Grenada Island; Dr. W, L. Abbott collected in Mada- 
gascar and Turkestan; the Chanler-IIobnel exi)edition to Jombene 
Range, East Africa, collected insects and other material; the United 
States Department of Agriculture sent Messrs. E. A. Schwarz and 
C n. Tyler Townseud to Brownsville, Tex., to investigate the Cotton 
Boll- weevil; Dr. Leonhard Stejneger visited the Commander Islands 
and Kamchatka and incidentally collected a number of insects; Mr. 
F. W. True, of the United States National Museum, and Mr. D. W. 
Prentiss, jr., of this city, visited the Pribilof Islands while temporarily 
in the service of the United States Fish Commission; Prof. C. Y. Riley 
and Mr. H. G. Hubbard went to the West Indies in the spring of 1895; 
Mr. W J McUree collected during his trip to Tiburan Island, Gulf of 
California, and Messrs. E. A. Schwarz and H. G. Hubbard collected in 
the vicinity of Salt Lake, Utah. 

Material has been sent from the department to fourteen individuals, 
including several prominent specialists in various orders. In some cases 
the specimens were transmitted for identification, and in other instances 
they were desired for comj)arison. A few investigators not connected 
with the Museum have made use of the collections in the department. 

The honorary curator mentions the names of eight correspondents who 
have made contributions and who have received publications in partial 
exchange. Exchanges of specimens have been arranged with nine 
other individuals in this country and abroad. The correspondents who 
have sent material for identification which has been retained in the 
Museum number fourteen. 

Thirty- three papers based upon Museum material have been published 
during the year by members of the staff, and seventeen by other 
collaborators. The titles of these papers appear in the Bibliography 
(Appendix iv). A very large number of new species are described. 
The names of these are given in the supplements to the Bibliography. 

About 7,000 specimens were added during the year, exclusive of 
the Marx collection, which was received on deposit and embraces 
about 10,000 specimens. The last catalogue entry on June 30, 1895, 
was 1584, and the last on June 30, 1896, 1789, giving 205 entries for the 
year. 

DEPARTMENT OF MARINE INVERTEBRATES. 

This department remains in charge of Mr. Richard Rathbun as hon- 
orary curator, with Mr. James E. Benedict and Miss Mary J. Rathbun 
as assistant curators. 

During the year a study of the Annelids of the west coast of tropical 
America was commenced, and work on a monograph of the American 
Brachyura and special researches on the genera Pseudothdpliusa and 
Sesarma have been carried on. Mr. Benedict made a study of some new 
soecies of blind Crustacea taken from an artesian well in San Marcos,

Tex., preliminary descriptions of which have already appeared in the 
Proceedings. Complete descriptions will be published later. Miss 
Kathbun has prepared an annotated list of the Decapod Crustacea of 
Jamaica, for publication by the Institute of Jamaica. A paper con- 
taining descriptions of the new forms will be published in the Proceed- 
ings, and is now in press. Miss Eathbun spent about two weeks in 
the summer of 1895 examining literature relating to the Crustacea 
m the libraries of Boston and Cambridge. 

There were sixty-nine accessions to this department during the year. 
Generally speaking, the accessions for the present year were not so 
large or so important as those of the preceding year, although the 
material received from the United States Fish Commission exceeded 
in value that of the accessions obtained from the same source during 
1894-95. 

The principal additions to the collections during the year are thus 
described by the curator : 

From the United States Fish Commission were received six accessions, compris- 
ing a large amount of material collected by the steamer Albatross, chiefly in the 
Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea; also the following : Crustacea collected during the 
cruise to the Galapagos Islands in 1891, representing groups Fodophthalma, Copep- 
oda, pelagic Schizopoda, Pantopoda and larva^ of Stomatopoda; meduste and 
hydroids studied by Prof. .1. Walter Fewkes; Crustacea from St. Paul Island, Bering 
Sea, collected by Messrs. F. W. True and D. W. Prentiss, jr. ; invertebrates from 
Kamchatka and the Commander Islands, collected by Dr. L. Stejueger, and inverte- 
brates from .lapan, collected by N. Grebnitzki. (Gift. ) 

From the Imperial Royal Natural History Museum, Vienna, Austria, through Dr. 
Franz Ritter von Hauer, fourteen species of echinoderms dredged by H. M. S. Pola 
in the eastern Mediterranean, 1890-1894. (Exchange.) 

From the Royal Biological Station, Helgoland, through Dr. Ehrenbaum, forty-six 
species of Crustacea from the North Sea. (Exchange.) 

From Edgar J. Bradley, Happy Valley Waterworks, South Australia, four acces- 
sions of Crustacea and other invertebrates from Australia. (Exchange.) 

From Glen Island Museum, Glen Island, N. Y., through L. M. McCormick, curator, 
fourteen species of invertebrates from the Gulf of Aden. (Exchange.) 

From Museo Nacional, San .lose, Costa Rica, through J. Fid. Tristan, many fresh- 
water crabs, including several new species. (Gift.) 

From H. Pittier, director, Institute Fisico-geografico Nacional, San Josd, Costa 
Rica, twelve lots of Crustacea from Gulf of Dolce, Costa Rica, several species being 
rare. (Gift.) 

From P. W. Jarvis, Colonial Bank, Kingston, Jamaica, specimens of crabs, includ- 
ing many new and rare forms. (Exchange. ) 

From Lieut. Wirt Robinson, United States Army, twelve species (one new) of 
crustaceans and echinoderms from Venezuela (Gift.) 

From the Department of Agriculture, through Dr. C. Hart Merriam, Chief of the 
Biological Survey, fresh-water crabs and shrimps from Mexico (collected by Nelson 
and Goldman), yielding two new species. (Gift.) 

From W. P. Hay, Washington, D. C, thirteen species of named isopods and 
amphipods. (Exchange.) 

From F. S. Conant, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md., types of three 
species of cha-tognaths. (Gift.) 

From Prof. S. E. Meek, Fayetteville, Ark., types of Camburus faxonii, Meek. 
(Gift.)

From H. A. Lafler, Dewitt, Nebr., three accessions of fresh-water Crustacea. (Gift.) 
FromMuseum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Mass., three species of Brazilian 

crabs (Callinedes). (P^xchange.) 
From Samuel J. Holmes, Chicago, HI., three anomnrau crustaceans. (Exchange.) 
From Prof. A. Dugcs, Guanajuato, Mexico, eight specimens of crabs (Pseudothel- 

phusajouyi, Rathbun). (Gift.) 

Material resulting from explorations, as will be noted from the above 
statement, embraced that received from the United States Fish Com- 
mission; from the Imperial Royal ISTatural History Musenm, Vienna; 
from the Royal Biological Station, Helgoland, and from the United 
States Department of Agriculture. 

A great deal of time is consumed by the scientific force of this 
department in the selection and preparation of collections sent out in 
exchange or as gifts. The composition of the sets of the regular series 
of duplicates has been set forth in previous reports. The last set of 
Series iv was sent out during the year just closed, and seven sets of 
Series v were distributed. Twelve special sets were prepared, several 
of which were for exchange with foreign museums or indiWduals. In 
addition, nine collections of unassorted foraminiferous material were 
distributed. 

A fine collection of miscellaneous invertebrates, including a number 
of commercial sponges, was lent to the United States Fish Commission 
for exhibition at the Cotton States and International Exposition at 
Atlanta. For the exhibit of the National Museum at the same Exposi- 
tion a large and showy collection of invertebrates, consisting chiefly of 
dried specimens mounted on tablets, was prepared by Mr. Benedict, 
who was assisted in this work by Prof F. M. Comstock, of the Case 
School of Ai^plied Science, Cleveland, Ohio. The work of installing 
this exhibit at the Exposition and of repacking it for shipment to Wash- 
ington occupied Mr. Benedict's time for one month. 

About 4,200 lots of specimens, consisting chiefly of mollusks, have 
been received from the I'eabody Museum, New Haven, where the work 
of separating and classifying the material collected by the Fish Com- 
mission in past years has been continued by Professor Verrill. 

The following statement regarding matters incident to the care of 
the collections is taken from the curator's report : 

The former " reptile room '" in the west Ijasement was reassigned to this depart- 
ment early in January. New and commodious shelving was erected in the middle 
of the room, and the extra accommodation alforded for alcoholics permitted a more 
systematic arrangement of the collections in storage in the basement. The groups 
are now arranged in the main as follows: The echini, startishcs, and holothurians 
are in the west room; the anthozoa and crinoids in the reptile room; the crusta- 
ceans, bryozoans, ascidians, and ophiurans in the main basement room, and the 
sponges are arranged in exhibition cases.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 



In transposing tlio c<.llc(tious the small tower room leading from the gallery was 
abandoue.!, and also all the cases in the hall of the west basement. 

The northwest tower, opening from the exhibition hall, was titted with additional 
shelving, and certain collections of annelids and anomurans which were needed for 
study, and other material, has been stored there. 

Dnring the year the alcoholic collections have been examined, alcohol added to 
replace t1iat lost by evaporation, and stoppers and rubbers renewed where necessary. 

A new card catalogue has been started, with cards of the library bureau size. 
Labels i)rinted on red paper are now used for jars and bottles containing type speci- 
mens, and a white label with the word "type" printed in large red capitals is placed 
inside the jar. 

An exceedingly interesting addition to the exhibition series in this 
department consists of a type series of Foraniinifera mounted for micro- 
scopic e.xaminatiou in such a manner as to make it readily accessible 
to the public. This series was prepared by Dr. J. M. Flint, IT. S. N., 
who has prepared for publication a description of the method of mount- 
ing and also of the specimens included in the series. 

An article containing instructions for the preservation of specimens, 
and intended especially for collectors on board ship, was prepared for 
publication by the Fish Commission. 

In addition to the paper already mentioned as having been published 
by Mr. Benedict, five others, based upon Museum material, have been 
published by various collaborators. Several new genera and some 
thirty- five new species are described in these papers. 

The work already planned for the future includes the placing upon 
exhibition of one or more specimens of each species of invertebrates in 
the Museum collections whose bathymetrical range exceeds 1,000 feet; 
the preparation of an educational series embracing all of the principal 
groups of invertebrates, for distribution to high schools and academies, 
and the i)reparation of a complete card-catalogue of the types in the 
department, with reference* to the original description, type local- 
ity, etc. 

The number of specimens received during the year exceeded 4,800.

HELMINTHOLOGICAL COLLECTION. 

Several series of specimens have been added to this collection during 
the year, the most important being the one deposited by the Bureau of 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 69 

Animal Industry of the Department of Agriculture. The accessions 
include some very valuable specimens. 

Owing to lack of space, it has been impossible to make much prog- 
ress in the work of administering upon the collections, although new 
hibels are being installed throughout. An effort is now being made to 
collect types and cotypes from Europe and America. 

The work of the custodian. Dr. 0. W. Stiles, has included a revision 
of the adult tapeworms of hares and rabbits. 

Pending the entry and cataloguing of the specimens received from 
the Bureau of Animal Industry, no estimate can be given of the num- 
ber of specimens in the collection. More than 1,400 entries have been 
made in the catalogue since the last report, making a total of 1,550 
entries to June 30, 189G. 

Several papers have been published by Dr. Stiles during the year, 
the titles of which will be found in the Bibliography (Appendix iv). 

DEPARTMENT OF COMPARATIVE ANATOMY. 

The accessions have been fewer than during the preceding year, 
although the material received is reported by the curator, Mr. F. A. 
Lucas, to possess considerable scientific value. A skeleton of Ponto- 
2)oria blainvillei, for a long time a special desideratum, was received 
from the La Plata Museum in exchange. 

Toward the close of the fiscal year it became necessary to remove 
all the cases from the exhibition hall, in order to lay a new fioor. This 
effectually prevented, for the time being, any additions to or improve- 
ments in the exhibition series. 

Eegarding the actual work ujion the collections, Mr. Lucas says: 

Aside from the moving- of specimeus, necessitated by changes in the workroom, 
exhibition hall, and basement of stable where alcoholics are stored, little has been 
done, the greater part of the time of the preparator having been devoted to the 
preparation of specimens for the department of maunnals and the Department of 
Agricnlture, and work connected with the Atlanta Exposition. Copy has been 
prepared for many labels, and some additions have been made to the synoptic series 
of invertebrates. A nnmber of additions have also been made to the exhibition 
series in the way of skeletons and models acqnired for the Atlanta Exposition. 

The study series is in good condition, except that the specimens 
are crowded. This is due in part to the fact that it has been necessary 
to assign considerable space to the Department of Agriculture deposit, 
necessitating the storage of some of the Museum material, and the 
transfer of nearly all of the cetaceans to the rooms occupied by the 
department of mammals. 

Mr. Lucas has commenced a study of the changes in the skull of 
the cormorants, and has continued his studies of the tongues of birds 
and their modification and adaptation to various kinds of food and 
the manner of obtaining it. A study of the skull of the extinct Pallas 
Cormorant has been completed. Other investigations, which are being 
conducted by Mr. Lucas in connection with his work in vertebrate 



70 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

paleontology, are referred to in the review of the department of paleon- 
tology. 

Ten papers have been published during the year by the curator. He 
also completed and edited a posthumous paper of Dr. Joseph Leidy on 
"Fossil Vertebrates of the Alachua Clays of Florida." 

Among those who have cooperated with the department, Lieut. Wirt 
Robinson, United States Army, and Mr. A. W. Anthony, San Diego, 
California, should be mentioned, the former having contributed several 
species of liumming-birds in alcohol, and the latter some specimens 
of petrels. 

lieferring to the further development of the department, Mr. Lucas 
submits tlie following plans: 

It would be very desirable to fill up the gaps in the exhibition series of birds, rep- 
tiles, and fishes, to extend the tooth series and that showing the modifications of the 
dermis and epidermis, and to add to the synoptic series of invertebrates. 

A few cliangcs of irons and pedestals are needed among the mammals, and a large 
number of labels should be supplied where they are now lacking. Finally, the 
exhibition series needs much rearrangement, as also does the study series. 

In regard to scientific work, the curator would like to complete the study of the 
development of the skull among the cormorants, and, if material can be obtained, 
to finish work on the osteology of the cormorants in relation to the origin and dis- 
tribution of the grou]). It is hoped that the paper on the fossil bisons of North 
America may be completed and work begun on the Dinosaurs of the Potomac. It 
is also desirable to continue the study of the swifts and of the modifications of the 
tongues of birds, while the paper on the Zenglodon, undertaken in conjunction with 
Mr. True, should V)e proceeded with as rapidly as possible. 

About the middle of June, 1896, Mr. Lucas started for the Pribilof 
Islands as a member of a special commission appointed by the Presi- 
dent to investigate the present condition of the fur-seal herds on the 
Pribilof, Commander, and Kurile islands. 

The number of specimens added during the year is as follows: 
Fishes, 51; reptiles, 62; birds, 69; mammals, 17; models, 8; total, 207. 
There are now over 15,000 specimens in the collections. The last cat- 
alogue entries at the end of the year just closed and at the end of the 
preceding year are shown in the following table:

DEPARTMENT OF PALEONTOLOGY. 



This department remains in charge of Mr. Chas. D.Walcott, Director 
of the United States Geological Survey, who holds the position of hon- 
orary curator. 

The scientitic value of the material received has been far greater 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 71 

than that of the accessions in the preceding year. An increase is also 
noted in the number of accessions. A collection of vertebrates, made 
under the direction of Prof. O. 0. Marsh, which has been on exhibition 
in the Museum for several years, was formally transferred from the 
United States Geological Survey. There were also received from the 
same source one hundred and fifteen boxes of unprepared vertebrate 
material from Kansas, a valuable collection of Green River fishes, a 
series of specimens studied by Professor Leidy and Mr. Lucas, a few 
fossil insects collected by Mr. David White, and an identified collec- 
tion of Cephalopoda, studied by Prof. Alpheus Hyatt, Cambridge, 
Mass. Mr. Charles Schuchert, the assistant curator, collected for the 
Museum an extensive series of Devonian fossils, embracing" about six- 
teen thousand specimens. These were obtained in New York, Ontario, 
and Michigan. Over two thousand six hundred specimens of Middle 
Cambrian fossils from Newfoundland and from St. Davids, Wales, were 
purchased from Mr. E. E. Howell, of this city. Another installment of 
fossil ijlants, together with a series of fossil fishes, was received from 
Mr. R. D. Lacoe, of Pittston, Pa. A large and valuable collection of 
fossils from various horizons, collected by the late Dr. Daniel Breed, 
was transmitted through Prof. B. T. Janney, administrator of the 
estate. This material was received in part as a gift and in part as an 
exchange. Mr. George Kernahan, Thedford, Ontario, contributed an 
excellent collection of Middle Devonian fossils, embracing 442 speci- 
mens. A collection of teeth and bones of mammals, exhibited at the 
Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta, was given to 
the Museum by the Peace River Phosphate Company of Florida. 
From Princeton College there were received in exchange skulls of 
Ischyroniys typits, Leptcmche)iia nutjor, and Eucrotaphus hullatus. From 
Dr. Herman Credner, Leipsic, Germany, fourteen specimens of jBra«c//io- 
saurus amblystofnus were obtained in exchange. In the same manner a 
collection of fossils and casts was secured from the Museo de la Plata, 
La Plata, Argentina; a large collection of Clinton and Niagara fossils, 
including many graptolites, from Col. Charles C. Grant, Hamilton, 
Ontario; thirty-six species of Russian Cretaceous 'fossils from Prof. A. 
Pavlow, Moscow, Russia; and a collection of characteristic Middle 
Devonian fossils from Mr. R. Macintosh, Thedford, Ontario. Four fine 
fossil medus?e, from the Jurassic of Germany, were purchased from 
Dr. F. Krantz, Bonn, and other material worthy of mention was con- 
tributed as follows: Several collections of fossils from Galveston, Tex., 
from Mr. J. A. Singley; a collection of Lower Carboniferous fossils from 
Dr. J. H. Lemon, New Albany, Ind.; two collections of interesting 
fossils from the Choteau formation of Missouri, from Mr. R. A. Blair; 
and a series of characteristic Middle Devonian fossils from Mr. Malcom 
McKinnon, Thedford, Ontario. 

The transfer of the magnificent Lacoe collection from Pittston, Pa., 
the residence of the donor, to Washington was completed during the 



72 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

present fiscal year. The collection was formally oftered to the Museum 
in December, 1891, and its extent and extraordinary scientific value 
were referred to at length in the report for the fiscal year ending June 
30, 1892. A brief statement of its contents may not, however, be out 
of place. The collection was included in three hundred and fifteen 
boxes, as follows : 

Two hundred and eiffht boxes, embracing over seventeen thousand specimens of 
Paleozoic plants. These include (1) types, and (2) specimens showing variation 
of species and geograjihic and geologic distribution. The contents of thirty-four of 
these boxes have not yet been determined. 

Two boxc's of I'aleozoic plants. 

Ninety boxes of duplicate Paleozoic plants. 

Two boxes of Triassic fishes. 

Two boxes of Paleozoic fishes. 

One box of Paleozoic Crustacea. 

Three boxes of Upper ("retaceous and Tertiary plants. 

Seven boxes, inchuliug eight hundred and four specimens of plants from the 
Dakota group, described in Monograph xvii. United States Geological Survey. 
One hundred and twenty-five of these specimens are types, and fifty-five were 
figured in the Monograph. 

The motive of the donor in presenting this material, as stated by 
himself, was the belief that this disposition of it would best fulfill his 
purpose in the formation of the collection, which was to accumulate as 
complete a series as possible of the older fossil flora for use in paleon- 
tological research. No conditions were imposed which would in any 
way interfere with the proper use of the collection. It was desired, 
however, by the donor that it should be known as the " Lacoe Collec- 
tion," and that it should be kept entire, with such additions as might 
be made to it in the future by further contributions from himself or by 
the exchange of duplicates. That the material should be made acces- 
sible to students generally is in accordance with the established rules 
of the Museum, and that every eftbrt should be made for the proper 
preservation of so valuable a collection was a foregone conclusion. 
This collection represents the results of the scientific labors of Mr. 
La(;oe for twenty years or more. Kot being satisfied, however, witli 
the time which he could devote to the work in person, he employed col- 
lectors in various States and in the Canadian Provinces, and also 
expended large sums of money in the ])urchase of private collections. 
About seven hundred and fifty published types are embraced in that 
portion of the collection which has been described. The series illus- 
trating the mor])hology of species and their geographical and geolog- 
ical distribution includes over seventeen thousand specimens. While 
the collection represents more thoroughly than any other in existence 
the fossil flora of the Pennsylvania anthracite regions, there are, in addi- 
tion, good series from Illinois, Tennessee, Missouri, and other States, as 
well as from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Brazil. Besides the 
plants from the Paleozoic formations, there are examples of the Creta- 
ceous and Tertiary flora of Colorado, a series of Triassic and Paleozoic 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY.

fishes and Crustacea, aud a collection of eight hundred and four plants 
from the Dakota group. A portion of the latter was, as already men- 
tioned, described by Professor Lesquereux, in Monograph xvii of the 
United States Geological Survey. Professor Lesquereux also studied 
the material from the Cretaceous and Tertiary of Colorado referred to 
above, and the Triassic and Paleozoic fishes and Crustacea have been 
studied by Cope, Hall, Whitfield, and others. 

It is not too much to say that the National Museum has never received 
a gift of greater scientific value or importance than that acquired through 
the generosity of Mr. Lacoe. 

Interesting data concerning the number of published types of Paleo- 
zoic plants in the Lacoe collection, and in the other collections of the 
National Museum, are presented in the followiug- tabulated statements:

The collections of this department are also to be enriched by Mr. 
I. H. Harris, of Wayuesville, Ohio, who has siguitied his intention of 
presenting to the ISTational Museum his magnificent series of fossils. 
This collection is the result of the labors of Mr. Harris during the past 
fifty years, and is very rich in rare fossils, such as trilobites, crinoids, 
and starfishes. It includes also a fine collection of mollusca from the 
upper portion of the Cincinnati formation. Mr. Harris and Mr. Schu- 
chert are engaged in the preparation of a monograph of American 
fossil starfishes, based upon this material. 

The present condition of the paleontological collections and the 
progress made in coring for and installing the material are indicated 
in the following extract from the report of the assistant curator, Mr. 
Charles Schuchert: 

Much of the time during July was devoted to prepariug the Zeuglodon material 
gathered by the assistant curator last year. It was chiefly from this material that 
the restoration of Zeuglodon was prepared for the Atlanta Exposition. During 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 75 

July and August a small series illustrating some of the cliaracteristic plants and 
animals of the various geological horizons was selected, and the specimens mounted 
upon tiles iu an attractive manner for exhibition at the Atlanta Exposition. This 
collection received honorable mention. 

From October 22 to about May 15 attention was given to the exhibit and study 
collections, but nothing could be done toward the contemplated mounting of the 
exhibition series iu this department, excepting the Mesozoic and Tertiary plant col- 
lections, which are now practically linished. The time from May 15 to July 1 was 
devoted to mounting the "Historical collection of fossils" in the department of 
geology. It was deemed best, before attempting the mounting on tiles of the gen- 
eral exhibition collection of fossils, to experiment upon a smaller collection. The 
first trial was that of the fossils exhibited at Atlanta, and a second and far larger 
test was made with the " Historical collection" in the department of geology. It 
is now certain that the mounting of fossils upon tiles has decided advantages over 
paper, wood, slate, or ground-glass tablets. The only disadvantage observed is 
that tiles, because of the somewhat greater thickness necessary for their stability 
and flatness, are lieavier than the other kind of tablets. Tliis disadvantage, how- 
ever, is not a fatal one. Consideralde time during the year was given by Mr. David 
White, assisted by Messrs. Williard and Whipple, toward the further arrangement 
of the study series of the Lacoe collection. This work is not yet completed, and 
will not be until another case is built in the east room of the south tower. That 
portion of the Lacoe collection on exhibition remains in the same condition as last 
year. It is, however, hoped to complete, mount, and label this series during the 
next fiscal year. 

While considerable time has been devoted to the invertebrate study series, much 
more work will have to be done before any intelligent selection can be made for 
the final exhibition series. The exhibit collection of vertebrates is in fair order, 
but more space is required to relieve it of its present congested condition. In 
the last annual report it was suggested that permanent ca.ses be built along the 
north wall of the southeast court. Much vertebrate material is nearly ready for 
installation, and more will soon be at hand, for all of which additional space is 
necessary. 

Eight hundred and eighty boxes of fossils are in storage, awaiting development 
and installation in the exhibition or study series. 

The duplicate fossils are being removed from the study series as fast as possible, 
and laid aside for future exchange and distribution. 

The Director of the United States Geological Survey has recently appointed Mr. 
H. E. Dickhaut, and the Museum, Mr. T. E. Williard, as preparators under the 
direction of the assistant curator. Work will progress hereafter far more rapidly 
with the material in the Museum building, and it is hoped that some of the fossils 
now in storage will be rt>moved during the year. However, the staff of this depart- 
ment has had in the past all it could do to arrange the collections as they came in 
from the field or from individuals. 

Each summer various Geological Survey parties send in collections, and it is the 
custom for this department to assist iu their preparation for study and in recording 
the material upon the Museum catalogues. 

The Lacoe collection is not yet completely housed. This is due, in part, to the 
fact that the Museum has no paid officer directly in charge of fossil plants. How- 
ever, Mr. David White has made considerable progress in this direction, and it is 
hoped, with the assistance of Mr. Williard, to complete the installation of the col- 
lection during 1896-97. 

Considerable scientific work, based npon material in this depart- 
ment, has been accomplished during the year. The preparation of a 
monograph on American fossil starfishes, by the assistant cnrator, Mr. 
Charles Schuchert, and Mr. I. H. Harris, has been referred to. Mr. 



76 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

Scliuchert has also completed a study of the American fossix Apodidse, 
the manuscript of which has beeu turned over to the editor. The "Syn- 
opsis of American fossil Brachiopoda," by the same author, referred to 
in the last Annual lleport, was completed during the present year, 
and is now being revised. A short summary of this work has already 
appeared in Science. The titles of two or three other papers by Mr. 
Schuchert are given in the Bibliography (Appendix iv). Mr. F. A. 
Lucas has begun a study of the character and affinities of the spe- 
cies of Zeuglodon, and a study of the species of the North American 
bison, with synopses of their salient characters, is well advanced. A 
posthumous pa]ier of Dr. Joseph Leidy, edited by Mr. Lucas, has been 
published. It is entitled "Fossil Vertebrates from the Alachua Clays 
of Florida." Mr. David White has made considerable progress with 
the description of new species in the Lacoe collection, regarding which 
Professor Lesquereux left some manuscript. Dr. R. R. Gurley has in 
preparation a revision of American Graptolites. This work will be 
published by the United States Geological Survey, but is based upon 
material which will become the property of the Museum. Mr. T. W. 
Stanton has published a work entitled "Contributions to the Creta- 
ceous Paleontology of the Pacific Coast." This is an illustrated work, 
and contains descriptions of about fifty new species and one new genus. 

The explorations which have resulted in enriching the collections 
include those of Mr. Schuchert in Xew York, Ontario, and Michigan, 
already referred to indirectly in the statement regarding important 
accessions, and those made by the United States Geological Survey. 
IMuch of the material collected by the Survey during the present year 
has not yet been transferred to the Museum. It includes, however, a 
fine collection of Lower Silurian fossils from Valcour Island, Lake 
Champlaiu, and a collection of trilobites from Rome, N. Y. Although 
the Zeuglodon material collected by the assistant curator in 1894 was of 
great interest and value, no good skull and none of the bones of cer- 
tain portions of the skeleton were secured. For this reason it is very 
desirable to continue these explorations with a view to securing the 
missing parts, if possible. 

Material for study has been sent to ten specialists during the year. 
Dr. R. R. Gurley, Prof. Alpheus Hyatt, Cambridge, Mass., and Prof. 
H. F. Osborn, American Museum of Natural History, New York City, 
conducted investigations in the department. These matters are refer- 
red to more at length in the chapters entitled "Material Lent for 
Investigation" and "The Work of Students and Investigators at the 
Museum." 

A preparator of plants and invertebrate fossils has been employed 
during the year. -It has not yet been possible, however, to appoint a 
preparator of vertebrate fossils, although the need for such an assistant 
is greatly felt. The necessity for additional cases to relieve the crowded

77 



condition of the collections is also pressing, and is referred to in the 
report of the department as follows : 

It is urgent that cases be provided at an early date to relieve the present congested 
condition of the vertebrate collections and to provide space for the rapidly accumu- 
lating material. There are two hundred and twenty-five boxes of vertel)rate material 
now in storage, awaiting a preparator. The preparation of this material for study 
and exhibition will occupy all the time of one man no less than three years, and it is 
to be hoped that means will be available during 1896-97 to secure such a person. 

.j^ ^ ji ^ ^ ^ 7^ 

All the rooms now occupied by the various sections in the department of paleon- 
tology are crowded, and, while here and there small areas are available for additional 
cases of standard drawers, more exhibition space is required. This is especially so 
in the section of vertebrate fossils, since nearly all of the organisms are large and 
can best be housed in the exhibition series. Space for these collections can be 
secured if permanent castas are built around the walls of the southeast court and the 
standard cases now occupying that space be placed upon a gallery. If such a gallery 
is built in the southeast court, ample exhiljition and storage space will be at hand 
for the natural increase of the collections during the next few years. 

Further drawer space is necessary to complete the housing of the Lacoe study 
collection. More than two-thirds of this collection is now stored in the two upper 
rooms of the south towers of the Natioual iluseuni building. The west room is 
completely occupied with cases provided with standard drawers, while the east 
room is but half occupied. 

It is not possible to give accurate iigures for the number of specimens 
received during the year in the various sections of the department.

The number of accessions for the year was two hundred and thirty- 
six, as against six hundred and seventy for the preceding year. There 
was, however, no falling oft' in the number of specimens included, but, 
on the other hand, a slight increase. The question of scientific value 
is of greatest imp(u-tance, however, and when the accumulations of the 
year are measured by this standard the results are very gratifying. 

Among the important accessions were five lots of Mexican plants, 
purchased from Mr, E. W. ISTelson, and aggregating two thousand four 
hundred specimens; five hundred and eleven specimens presented by 
the Botanical Gardens, Calcutta, India; fifty-eight specimens presented

by Baron Ferd. von Miiller, Melbourne, Australia; one hundred and 
thirty-five ferns presented by Hugo Fink, Cordova, Mexico; two liun- 
dred and thirty-eight specimens from the United States Fish Commis- 
sion, and thirty specimens from C. F. Sonne, Trucliee, Cal. Valuable 
material was received in exchange from the Eoyal Gardens, Kew, 
England, consisting of two hundred and fifty specimens of Umbelli- 
ferii', and Dr. Leonhard Stejneger collected eighty specimens for the 
Museum in the Commander Islands.

The space which can be devoted to the herbarium in the Museum is 
much too small for its proper accommodation. Means have been found, 
however, for providing a limited amount of additional space, and con- 
siderable progress has been made in caring for the collection, as will 
be seen by the following statement made by Mr. F. V. Coville, the 
lionorary curator. It is especially gratifying to be able to report that 
the collection is in better condition than at any previous time. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. • 79 

One tower room, 12 by 10 feet, lias been fitted np with shelves on four sides. This 
room is for storing unmounted material. One new balcony has been built, adjoining 
the main balcony on the south and running at right angh^s, covering a iloor space 
6 by 48.5 feet. This has been furnished with long shelves for the distribution of 
specimens; also an herbarium case extending along its entire length. The case con- 
tains eight hundred pigeon-holes, and will hold eighty thousand specimens. This 
has relieved somewhat the congested condition in the main balcony, although we 
shall soon need additional space if the present growth of the collection continues. 

Much work has been done in readjusting, relabeling, and shifting of the packages 
of phmts. While mmh remains yet to be done, all parts of the collection are read- 
ily accessible to the assistants and to visiting botanists. It is not improper to state 
here that the collection has never before been in such good condition. 

The stamping of the herbarium, which was referred to in last year's report, has 
extended from the Malvaceas to the Anacardiaceaj. The number of specimens thus 
stamped is four thousand. It is very important that the whole collection be stamped 
as early as possible, but with our present force we are not able to make much progress. 

The transportation to the main herbarium of the collection now stored in the 
south balcony has been continued, although little progress has been made owing to 
other duties. Six thousand specimens have been transferred. This work ought to 
be completed during the coming year. 

The Department of Agriculture transferred to the Museum in March the collection 
of alga>, lichens, hepatics, mosses, and ferns. The grasses, conifera', and i)arasitic 
fungi are still in charge of the Department of Agriculture. 

The work of selecting and marking the type specimens in the herbarium has been 
continued. Thus far nine hundred species have been marked with a type label, 
indexed, placed in special sheets, and returned to the herbarium. 

During the year thirty-six thousand specimens have been stamped and added to 
the permanent collection. This includes twenty-two thousand Avhich have been 
mouuted during the year and fourteen thousand which were not (luite ready for dis- 
tribution at the end of last year. 

There is no exhibition series in this department. The need of still 
more space for the study series will soon become imperative. 

Mr. J. N. Rose, one of the assistant curators, has published a report 
on Mexican Umbellifera^, mostly from the State of Oaxaca. This i^aper 
contains descriptions of four new genera and twenty-seven new species. 
Mr. Eose has also published a number of shorter papers containing 
descriptions of new or rare species. During the year he determined 
the PolypetaliTB of Mr. C. G. Pringle's Mexican collection, continued 
work upon the collections made by Mr. E. W. Nelson and Dr. Edward 
Palmer in the same locality, and began a monograph on the Commeli- 
nacea^ of the United States. In the latter it is intended to include 
colored drawings of all the species. 

Mr. Charles L. Pollard, assisted by other Washington botanists, has 
continued his revision of Professor Ward's "Guide to the Flora of 
Washington and Vicinity." It is hoped that the manuscript will be 
ready for the printer during the coming winter. 

Mr. Coville states that no exi^lorations have been made directly under 
the auspices of the Museum which resulted in additions to the collec- 
tions in this department, although important material was obtained by 
Mr. E. W. True and Dr. Leonhard Stejneger while they were in the 
service of the United States Fish Commission. Mr. W J McGee, of 



80 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

the Bureau of Ainericau Ethnology, made a small collection in western 
Souora, Mexico, and considerable material collected by Mr. J. B. Lei- 
berg, a lield agent of the Department of Agriculture, has been received. 

Eleven persons have received material for examination or determina- 
tion during the year, and six specialists, not members of the staff, 
have i)rosecutcd investigations in the herbarium. 

Among those who have rendered valuable service to the department, 
the following are mentioned by the curator : 

Mr. E. G. Baker, of the British Mnsenm, London, England, named and compared 
specimens with tyi)e8 in the British Mnsenm. 

Mr. W. Botting Hemsley, of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, England, critically 
determined many UmbelliferiB. 

Mr. George E. Davenport, of Medford, Mass., critically determined Mexican and 
Alaskan ferns. 

Mr. M. L. Fernald, of Cambridge, Mass., made many critical determinations. 

Mr. J. M. Greeuman, of Cambridge, Mass., rendered much assistance in deter- 
mining Mr. Nelson's large collection of Mexican plants. 

Mr. George E. Osterhout, of New Windsor, Colo., sent some interesting plants 
from his State. 

Mr. C. (J. Pringle, of Charlotte, Vt., fnrnished many valualjle notes and speci- 
mens of Mexican Umbelliferic. 

Mr. P. A. Rydberg, of Columbia College, New York City, lent specimens and 
determined critically a number of large genera, especially rhiisalis and Potentilla. 

Prof. J. M. Coulter, of the University of Chicago, assisted in the determination of 
a number of new 8])ecie8 of Umbelliferic. 

Mr. W. N. Suksdorf, of White Salmon, AVash., sent specimens of Umbelliferie. 

The material in the herbarium has served as the basis of thirty-seven 
papers, Avhich have been published during the year by members of the 
staff and by other collaborators. The titles of these papers appear in 
the Bibliography (Appendix iv). They include descriptions of six new 
genera and sixty-seven new species and subspecies. 

More than 17,000 specimens were received during the year, the cata- 
logue entries numbering 236. 

TRAJJSFEK OF THE NATIONAL IIERIJARIUM TO THE MUSEUM BUILDING. 

Wlien the herbarium was transferred to the National Museum build- 
ing in 1894:, it was with the understanding that the force engaged in 
caring for the collection should be continued upon the rolls of the 
Department of Agriculture so long as the appropriations permitted it. 
The appropriation for the iiscal year ending June 30, 1897, was largely 
reduced, however, and the Department of Agriculture was obliged to 
decline to retain these employees on its rolls any longer. It then became 
necessary for the Museum to ask for an additional appropriation for 
the maintenance of the herbarium, and this has been provided for in 
tlie appropriations for the coming fiscal year. The matter was pre- 
sented to the Committee on Appropriations by the Assistant Secretary 
of Agriculture and the Acting Secretary of the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion. The letters to the committee urging the necessity of action are 
here presented : 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 81 

April 22, 1896. 
Hou. W. B. Allison, 

Chairman Committee on Appropriations, United States Senate. 

Dear Sir: In rosponso to your desire, communicated through Mr. Coville, for 
further information as to the purpose and effect of granting to the National Museum 
an additional sum of $10,000 for the maintenance of the National Herbarium, I have 
to reply as follows : 

When, nearly two years ago, the Secretary of Agriculture found the Department 
buildings entirely too small, and it was brought to his attention that a large amount 
of space was occupied by a collection of plants estimated to be worth $250,000, and 
liable at any time to be destroyed by lire, arrangements were made with the Smith- 
sonian Institution to house the collection in the fireproof building of the National 
Museum. The Department agreed to retain on its rolls, so ^ong as the appropriatica 
permitted it, the force of assistants necessary in caring for the c llection, but tho 
unexpected reduction iu the botanical appropriation, recently made, has forced the 
Secretary to ask that he be relieved of this charge. 

If the proposed appropriation be made, the force of assistants and mounters now 
engaged iu caring for the herbarium in the National Museum building will be trans- 
ferred to the rolls of that institution, and the places thus made vacant upon the 
statutory roll in our division of botany will be filled by the transfer of employees 
now on the botanical lump sum. No new employees will be appointed as a result of 
the change, and the statutory position of assistant curator will be left vacant 
during the coming year, either to be abolished in the next agricultural appropria- 
tion bill or to be changed to assistant botanist. 

Besides the emergency reasons just cited for the transfer of the herbarium, the 
Department holds that the care of the collection is properly the function of the 
Smithsonian Institution, but that it should always be open to the botanists of 
the Department for reference and consultation in any investigation in which they 
need it. The object, and the sole object, of the proposed change is to place the 
herbarium in good hands and in its legitimate place, so as to enable the Department 
to organize all the botanical work on a directly practical basis. 
Respectfully, 

Chas. W. Dabney, Jr., 

Assistant Secretary. 

N. B. — This letter is written in connection with that of the Acting Secretary of the 
Smithsonian Institution, dated April 22, 1896, addressed to the Hon. AV. B. Allison, 
Chairman Committee on Appropriations, United States Senate, which is our author- 
ity for the above statement with regard to the part to be performed by the National 
Museum and Smithsonian Institution. 

April 22, 1896. 
Hon. William B. Allison, 

Chairman Committee on Appropriations, United States Senate. 

Sir: I deem it my duty to bring to your attention tb(^ fact that unless some special 
provision is made for its maintenance, the National Herbarium, recently transferred 
from the care of the Department of Agriculture to that of the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion, will become comparatively useless. 

This is one of the largest collections of American plants in the world, and one of 
the most important, embracing as it does the collections of all the Government sur- 
veys from the time of Fremont and Wilkes to the present day. It contains about 
two hundred and fifty thousand specimens, mostly American, and constitutes for 
Auieriean botany a consultative library of specimens of the very gi-eatest impor- 
tance. In it there are many types of American plants not to be found elsewhere, 
and it is constantly consulted, either personally or through correspondence, by all 
working botanists in America.

82 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

Althoufrh the Smithsonian InHtitutiou has always been responsible for the admin- 
istration of this herbarium, it was for many years relieved of the care and expense 
of this work by the Department of Agriculture. In the fall of 1894, however, the 
present Secretary, finding himself unable to give it proper accommodation, and also 
thinking it miglit sufter destruction if kept longer in a building which is not fire- 
proof, requested the Secretary of this Institution to resume its direct custody; 
promising, however, that so long as funds should be available for the purpose in 
tlie hands of the Department of Agriculture, he would bo responsible for its support 
and maintenance. 

Tlu' value of the collection was so great that the Secretary did not feel at liberty 
to refuse to receive it, and it was at once transferred, although at a very great 
inconvenience, since our Museum building is so crowded that several of its depart- 
ments were seriously discommoded by the change. 

From that time until now the herbarium has been maintained from the appropri- 
ation of the Department of Agriculture; but the appropriation for botanical work 
has been so much decreased by the present Congress, that, as I am informed, this 
can no longer be done. 

The Secretary of Agriculture has already addressed a letter to you, calling your 
attention to this fact, and suggesting that the sum of $10,000, which was withdrawn 
from his a])propriation, be added to our appropriation, "for the preservation and 
increase of the c(dlections in the National Museum," in order to provide for the util- 
ization of this great collection of plants. 

I need scarcely say to you that the collection is of special imjjortance to the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, and is necessarily in constant use by many of its staft". 

Should this addition to our appropriations not be made, I do not see how it is pos- 
sible to do more for the herbarium than simplj^ to preserve it from destruction. It 
can not be kept in such shape that it will be conveniently available for reference; 
it can not be increased in order to keep pace with the growth of botanical knowl- 
edge and the necessities of American botanists and of the Department of Agricul- 
ture. Nothing can be done with the great amount of material which is already on 
hand, which requires special treatment for its preservation and utilization. It will 
also be impossible to carry on the system of exchange, long practiced, by which not 
only the National Herbarium but all the herbariums of the country are constantly 
benefited. 

Should the sum of $10,000 be provided, it would be utilized in the first place by 
the retention of the staft' of skilled assistants, clerks, and preparators already 
engaged upon this work and now on the rolls of the Department of Agriculture. 
The direct charge of the herbarium would be, as now, in the hands of the Botanist 
of the Department of Agriculture, who, by permission of the Secretary of Agricul- 
ture, serves in this capacity without compensation, with the title of honorary cura- 
tor in the National Museum. There are also two skilled assistants, one at $1,800 
and one at $1,200, and it is desired to add another at $1,500 to take charge of the 
collection of cryptogamic plants. There is also a typewriter and clerk at $900, one 
preparator at $720 and three at $600, making in all $7,920. 

Supplies and materials for preservation cost annually about $1,000, about $800 of 
this sum being required for the purchase of paper for mounting and covers. 

A certain sum is required each year for the acquisition of new material, the types 
of new investigations, and the results of explorations of the year. For this a sum 
of about $7r>0 is required. This would leave a contingent sum of $330. 

Should the desired sum be granted, it will bepossilde to maintain this vast collec- 
tion, which is of much importance to botanical science, in a manner befitting the 
dignity of the nation. 

I am, sir, with great respect, G. Brown Goode, 

Acting Secretary, 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 83 

DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS. 

Special attention lias been given to the work of securing material 
illustrating the associations, occurrence, and typical development of 
minerals of specific localities. This has indirectly been the cause of a 
great increase in the scientific value of the collections during the year. 
The report of the honorary curator, Prof F. W. Clarke, states that all 
the collections show a steady and highly gratifying growth. Three of 
the accessions comprised jnaterial deposited by the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution for addition to the Lea collection. These included a collection 
of gems, semi-precious stones, and minerals from the southern states; 
a nugget of native silver, weighing 448 ounces, from Pinal County, 
Ariz., and a specimen of green tourmaline — a cut stone weighing 57^ 
carats and valued at $1,500. This material was presented by Dr. L. T. 
Chamberlain to the Smithsonian Institution, and by the latter deposited 
in the National Museum. It is another evidence of Dr. Chamberlain's 
unstinted generosity by which the Museum has benefited so largely in 
the past. 

Of the other accessions by gift the following are deemed worthy of 
special mention: A collection of minerals from the Copper Queen Mine, 
Bisbee, Ariz., presented by the Copper Queen Consolidated Mining 
Company, New York City; specimens of lawsonite from F. L. Eansome, 
through H. W. Turner, United States Geological Survey; a specimen 
of lorandite, a new siDecies of mineral, from George L. English & Co., 
New York City; specimens of Georgia bauxite and associated minerals 
from the Georgia Bauxite and Mining Company, Lin wood, Ga. ; a 
specimen of caswellite, a new species of mineral, from Franklin, N. J., 
presented by Col. G. Cjesar ; a collection of minerals from Marion County, 
Ark., exhibited at the Cotton States and International Exposition 
at Atlanta; a collection of distorted selenite crystals and other minerals 
from Hants County, Nova Scotia, presented by Dr. M. C. Smith, Lynn, 
Mass., and specimens of quartz crystals, distorted and highly modified, 
from Arkansas, presented by Charles F. Brown, Hot Springs, Ark. A 
large slab of agatized wood from Chalcedony Park, Arizona, was depos- 
ited by the Drake Company, St. Paul, Minn., and a si)ecimen of thau- 
masite from a new American locality was purchased from George L. 
English & Co. 

The time of the honorary curator is occupied to so great an extent 
in connection with his position as chief chemist of the LTnited States 
Geological Survey that the care of the collections has devolved very 
largely upon the assistant curator, Mr. Wirt Tassin. The many minor 
details of installation, consisting of reblocking, mounting, developing 
crystals, etc., have been carried on continuously, with the result that a 
marked improvement in the appearance of the collections Is noticeable. 

An investigation of the minerals of Italian Peak, Colorado, is now 
in progress, while earlier in the year a large amount of time was spent 
in the study of comparative mineralogy. 



84 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

Uuder the head of ex])lorations meution is made in the curator's 
report of the material secured by the field parties of the United States 
Geological Survey, and also of the collections obtained by the assistant 
curator in the zinc regions of New Jersey. A nearly complete set of 
the minerals of this region was secured. 

Eeference to the work of Dr. W. F. Hillebrand, of the United States 
Geological Survey, who prosecuted certain investigations in the depart- 
ment during the year, will be found in another place. 

The honorary curator has published three papers during the period 
covered by this report. 

Among the plans proposed for the future, special reference is made 
by the curator to the establishment of a series illustrating mineral 
technology. 

Nearly 1,100 specimens were added to the collection. The last cata- 
logue entry in June, 1895, was 83613, and in June, 1896, 83761. 

DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY. 

The number of i)ermanent accessions during the year was eighty- 
eight, as against seventy-nine for the i)receding year. There were also 
one hundred and sixty "temporary" accessions, consisting of material 
received for examination and report. This is an increase of thirty-eight 
over the preceding year. The value of the material received during the 
year covered by this report is considerably greater than of that received 
in 1894-95, owing to the character of the specimens obtained by pur- 
chase for exhibition at the Cotton States and International Exposition 
at Atlanta. 

Among the important accessions, the following are mentioned by the 
curator, Dr. George P. Merrill: 

(1) Collection of gold and silver minerals, purcliased for the Atlanta Exposition. 
Valne, $600. 

(2) Two slabs of serpentine marble from Westfield, Muss. ; septaria nodules from 
England; alabaster from Tnscany, and obsidian from Lipari. 

(3) A collection of nonmetallic minerals, rocks, etc., and five hundred and six 
tbin sections of iron ores, collected during the vrork of the Tenth Census, but just 
turned over to the department by Prof. R. Pumpelly. 

(4) One stalactite from the Copper Queen Mine, Bisbee, Ariz. (Purchase.) 

(5) Amphora and other vessels of stalagmite from Egypt. (Purchase.) 

(6) Collection of one hundred and sixteen specimens of gold and silver ores from 
North and South Carolina, Georgia., and Alabama, received from the United States 
Geological Survey. 

(7) Collection of rocks and soils from Bermuda. (Gift of Dr. D. W. Prentiss.) 

(8) Columnar sandstones from Zittau, Germany. (Gift of A. Kraus, United States 
consular agent.) 

(9) Lithological collections, representing some live hundred specimens, collected 
in various parts of the United States. (From the United States Geological Survey.) 

A portion of the material received during the year was collected by 
the curator personally. 

Kegarding the care of the collections. Dr. Merrill says that over six 
hundred printed labels for the exhibition series have been received from 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 85 

the printer during the year, and that copy has been prepared for about 
five hundred more. The card catalogue of the exhibition series has been 
kept up to date, and a limited number of cubes of building stones have 
been cut. About two hundred thin sections were xu-epared, and over 
three thousand five lumdred duplicate specimens identified, labeled, and 
laid aside for future use. It is proposed to sort out and prepare for dis- 
tribution all the duplicate material in the storeroom, with a view to 
utilizing this space for the study series, the latter having outgrown its 
present accommodations. A large proportion of the exhibition cases 
in this department are floor uprights, and have no space for storage. 

A number of the exhibits require rearranging, but this matter will 
be deferred until the question of erecting balconies shall have been 
decided. The exhibition series is fairly well labeled, although many 
typewritten labels are at present in use. 

The investigations of the curator have consisted mainly of studies 
relating to rock weathering and to the composition, character, and 
origin of material belonging to the nonmetallic economic series. He 
has devoted special attention to asbestus, ochres, and soapstones. 
About fifty analyses have been made in connection with investigations 
relating to rock weathering and the formation of soils. 

A considerable number of specimens, including many thin sections 
of rocks, have been lent to various persons for study. Reference to 
these transactions will be found in another place. 

Among those whose cooperation has been of value during the present 
year the name of Mr. F. W. Crosby, of this city, should be mentioned. 
The department is also indebted to the United States Geological Sur- 
vey for a large proportion of the most valuable material acquired. 

Five papers have been published by Dr. Merrill during the year, 
three of which appeared in i)ublications of the National Museum. 

Regarding the future development of the department, the curator 
states that the quality of the material in the collections could in many 
instances be improved by substituting new specimens, but that desir- 
able specimens can, as a rule, be obtained only by purchase or by the 
employment of a paid collector. Occasionally, however, such specimens 
are to be secured by exchange. 

The present condition of the collections is indicated in the following 
statement: 

The catalogue entries show that one thousand one hundred and sixty-two speci- 
mens have been received during the year. This inchides both exhibition and study 
material. It does not, however, include the live hundred and odd microscopic slides, 
which are never catalogued. Several of the entries are those of collections includ- 
ing from one to several specimens each. 

Estimated number of specimens in the collection: 

Exhibition series 23. 097 

Study series 28 911 

Microscopic slides 4, 700 

Duplicates of all kinds 15, 541 

Total 72, 249 



86 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

The last entry in the catalogue on June 30, 1895, was 62781, and on 
June 30, 1896, 63469. 

DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOGY. 

The value of the accessions during the fiscal year just closed is not 
so great as during the previous year, owing to the fact that in 1894-95 
a considerable (juantity of material was obtained especially for exhibi- 
tion at the Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta. 
Since the return of these exhibits the curator, Prof. Otis T. Mason, 
has been occupied in installing such as could be placed upon exhibition, 
the remainder having been put in storage. 

The most important accession of the year was from Dr. J. Walter 
Fewkes, consisting of more than one thousand five hundred specimens 
of anti(]uities from the Pueblo region. This is regarded as the most 
valuable material ever received by the National Museum from the 
southwest. An important collection of ethnological specimens was also 
sent in by Dr. W. L. Abbott. This material was obtained in the Vale of 
Kashmir. Dr. Washington Matthews, United States Army, presented 
a small but valuable collection of paints and dyes used by the Navajo 
Indians, and from the Royal Zoological Museum, Florence, Italy, through 
Prof. H. H. Giglioli, an interesting series of specimens was received in 
exchange. Among other accessions the following may be noticed: A 
collection from New Guinea, made by Dr. A. G. Haddon; a collection 
of objects designed to illustrate the cannibal ceremonies of the Fort 
Eupert Indians, made by Dr. Franz Boas; a series of two hundred and 
six specimens from the Lubuy Museum, Poltava, Little Russia; and a 
small collection obtained by the United States Fish Commission in 
Alaska. 

Upon the return of the collections sent to the Atlanta Exposition, a 
radical change was necessitated both in the exhibition halls and in 
the storage rooms. In the chapter entitled "The Development and 
Arrangement of the Exhibition Series" will be found a paragraph 
relating to the rearrangement of the halls. In the upper story of the 
north tower on the west side of the building are stored such objects as 
can not be arranged in cases or drawers, while in the third story 
the entire collection of Eskimo costumes, snowshoes, and objects con- 
nected with i)ersonal adornment and with travel are packed away. In 
the small room on the lower floor of this tower a large portion of the 
Dorsey Mohun African collection is stored, together with the collection 
of breech-loading firearms, the series of foods and medicines, and a 
number of other objects. The corresponding room in the south tower 
is filled with swinging screens and unit boxes. All manuscripts, cata- 
logues, drawings, and photographs relating to the collections have been 
placed in the rooms in the second story of the soutli tower. The curator 
states that the material not on exhibition is in better condition than 
ever before. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 87 

The ancient pottery, not including that from the Pueblo region, hav- 
ing been transferred to the department of prehistoric anthropology, 
the work of preparing, in the northwest court, an exhibit illustrating 
the life of the Pueblo tribes, has been continued. In this the curator 
has had the assistance of Dr. J. Walter Fewkes and Mr. Frank 
Hamilton Gushing. 

A great deal of time has been spent in preparing a catalogue of the 
material received by the department of ethnology during the last fifty 
years. The task has now been finished. Not every specimen has 
been catalogued separately, but, in the words of the curator, "every 
specimen that would seem to have any value in a comprehensive and 
comparative study." The work of checking off on this catalogue the 
material sent out by the department, through exchanges with other 
museums, still remains to be done. A large number of specimens have 
also been withdrawn from time to time for the purpose of establishing 
the various sections included under the department of arts and indus- 
tries. These should be checked off in a similar manner, but in order 
to i)erform this task, additional clerical help is needed. 

The preparation of a comi^reheusive work on the practical arts of 
the American Indians is at present occupying the attention of the 
curator. He has in view the work of establishing a series of types 
characterizing the arts practiced in various culture-regions. In this 
undertaking he is making use not only of the material in the National 
Museum, but is also utilizing trustworthy data obtained from other 
sources. A systematic plan has been laid out, and a large number of 
illustrations have been already prepared. 

Under the head of Explorations, and in addition to the valuable 
material obtained by Dr. Fewkes in Arizona, which has already been 
referred to, reference should be made to a collection obtained by Mr. 
James Mooney, illustrating the various phases of life among the Kiowa 
Indians. 

Only a small quantity of material has been sent out for study during 
the year. It is the eftbrt of the dei)artment to induce investigators to 
conduct their studies in the building, where the student finds many 
things which would otherwise escape his observation. The curator 
also is frequently enabled by this method to obtain information from 
those who have prosecuted extensive investigations along certain lines. 
In another chapter reference is made to the researches of some of these 
students. A study of the Eskimo lamp has occupied the attention of 
the assistant curator, Dr. Walter Hough, for a considerable length 
of time. 

The department has profited by the generous cooperation of many 
persons. Through the offices of Hon. W. W. Eockhill, Assistant Sec- 
retary of State, a large number of specimens have been secured for the 
Museum, and among others who have rendered service in various ways 
Mr. W. S. Hill, secretary of the Academy of Sciences, Tacoma, Wash. ; 



88 REPORT OP NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

Prof. F. W. Putnam, Cambridge, Mass.; Eev. H. C. Mabie, Boston, 
Mass., and Dr. Franz Boas, American Museum of Natural History, 
New York City, should be mentioned. 

Four papers based upon Museum material have been published by 
the curator during the year, and one by the assistant curator. The 
titles of these are included in the Bibliography (Appendix iv). Six 
lectures were delivered by Professor Mason at Columbian University on 
" Primitive arts in their relation to Sociology as illustrated by the col- 
lections in the United States National Museum." 

Regarding the plans of the curator for the further development of 
his department, the following paragraphs are quoted from his report : 

The curator would respectfully make the foUowiug suggestions with regard to the 
development of the department of ethnology: First, that hereafter collections from 
the American continent should be made with especial reference to completing, as far 
as iiossiblc, illustrations in things of the technical life of all the principal tribes 
and families of America. * * * In ordei' to understand the true life of the abo- 
riginal tribes of the Western Hemisphere, this Museum ought to contain a typical 
siiecimen from each of them belonging to every one of the great domestic indus- 
tries; for instance, there should be a model of every kind of house ever lived in by 
any large number of people on this continent. There ought to be in every one of 
these collections, in miniature, in ])icture, or in description, the prevailing and cus- 
tomary furniture of tlie kitchen, the dining room, the bed room, the living room, and 
the social gathering room or its equivalent, indoors or out of doors. There should 
be in picture, in miniature, or in actual specimens, every kind of costume worn by 
a large number of individuals in every one of these tribes. Of course, it would be 
impossible to represent, in such a collection, all the little eccentricities of dress 
among savage people, where great varieties prevail among individuals of the same 
family. After all, in every tribe there is a composite dress, a dress which would 
take in pretty much all the dress of the tribe, and of this typical dress there should 
be in this Museum one example from each tribe. 

There should also be gathered the tools used by all those tribes for all sorts of pur- 
poses; forpounding, cutting, boring, smoothing, and various other purposes of common 
nse. The metric appliances of all the tribes should be here, and in sufficient numbers 
to set forth the characteristics of each tribe. There should be a comprehensive 
series relating to the great industries of their lives; quarrying, mining, fishing, hunt- 
ing, planting and gleaning, the intermediary arts by which the substances gathered 
in the primary arts are transferred to the uses of life, and the final arts and activi- 
ties by which these products of industry are turned into the channels of consump- 
tion or enjoyment. Also the apparatus by which substances are moved from 
place to place upon the backs of men or beasts, whether on land, on water, or on 
snow. This, of course, would make an ideal collection, but instead of gathering 
in a desultory way duplicates of material already in hand, the curator is now in 
possession of information which enables him to say whether a specimen which 
it is possiblt! to acquire will fill one of the gaps herein indicated, or will add one 
more to a collection already containing a superabundance of such material. 

There were 1,556 entries made in the catalogues during the year, 
embracing 2,828 specimens. 

DEPARTMENT OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY, 

The curator, Dr. Thomas Wilson, states that the scientific value of 
the collections received during the past year compares favorably with 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 89 

tne genera average of preceding years. He believes tliat a comparison 
which takes into acconnt only the ntwiher of specimens acquired would 
be of little value, inasmuch as during the preceding year the extensive 
collection deposited by Dr. Eoland Steiuer was catalogued, besides 
several other large lots of material, which resulted altogether in 
making the year 1S94-95 one of the most notable in the history of the 
department. 

The accessions during the year covered by this report embrace 
another collection of archaeological objects from Dr. Iloland Steiuer; 
a number of paleolithic implements, fragments of Eoman pottery 
and of Samian ware, fourteen specimens of animal bones, and a skull 
of a victim of the plague of 1349, from the ITorniman Museum, Lon- 
don (exchange); a collection of human skulls and bones from a 
burial cave near Duffield, Scott County, Va., received from Mr. 
A. L. Pridemore, Jonesville, Ya. ; a polished stone implement found 
near Olympia, Wash., from Mr. E. H. Hannah, of that city; a series of 
implemeuts obtained from the gravels of the Thames and from the 
chalk plateau of Kent, England (purchase); a number of specimens 
from W. P. Damon, West Auburn, Me. (exchange) ; implements, orna- 
ments, vessels, etc., presented by Mr. Newton H. Chittenden, Mill 
Eiver, Berkshire County, Mass.; pottery and vessels from mounds in 
Illinois, Kentucky, and Tennessee, sent by Capt. J. E. Johnson, Pitts- 
burg, Pa., in exchange; large chipped digging implements and other 
specimens of flint from Kentucky, presented by Mr. Paul Weir, Owens- 
boro, Ky. ; three bone whistles from an ancient grave on San Clemente 
Island, Cal., presented by Mr. J. Neale Plumb. 

A collection of more than eight hundred archjieological objects from 
Michigan and Alabama was lent to the department for study and 
examination by Mr. Percy F. Matthews, Florence, Ala., and Mr. War- 
ren K. Moorehead, Columbus, Ohio, sent a small number of specimens 
for the same j)urpose. 

The following statement regarding the progress made in caring for 
the collections is quoted from the report of the curator : 

Two additional storerooms have been fitted with shelves daring the past year. One, 
in the sonth tower, has been utilized for the reception of North American pottery, 
mostly fragmentary, but still useful for study and exchanges. Tlie othei', in the 
southwest tower, has been filled with pottery from Central and South America, con- 
sisting principally of entire vessels. 

All the Mexican and part of the Nicaraguan and Costa Rican collections were 
placed on exhibition, necessitating a rearrangement of the cases already devoted to 
objects from these countries. 

As many as possible of the entire vessels from mound explorations in the United 
States were also placed on exhibition, and the remainder stored on shelves in the 
rear of the long wall case at the east end of the hall. All this material was received 
from the Museum buihliug. 

In addition there were packed and sent to storage 71 boxes containing stone 
implements, fragments of pottery, human bones, etc. These were part of the collec- 
tions received from the Bureau of Ethnology and were temporarily stored on tlie door 
of the anthropological hall. The aisles and passageways are now entirely clear. 



90 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

There is no separate study series in this department. The exhibi- 
tion series is in as good a condition as at any previous time. A series 
of transparencies, to be placed in the windows of the anthropological 
hall, is in course of j^reparation. 

A paper on the Swastika sign, by the curator, was published in the 
Museum Report for 1894. The preparation of several other papers by 
Dr. Wilson has now been nearly completed. The titles of those pub- 
lished during the year, so far as they are based upon Museum material, 
are given in the Bibliography (Appendix IV). A number of lectures 
have also been delivered by the curator. 

Mr. John W. Emmert, of Bristol, Tenn., a former employee of the 
Bureau o'f Ethnology, and Gen. A. L. Pridemore, of Jonesville, Va., 
conducted certain explorations, on a small scale, under the auspices of 
the Museum, and a considerable quantity of material was secured. The 
curator, also, spent a few days in July, 1895, in exploring caverns in 
Ross and Hocking counties, Ohio. The time devoted to this work was 
necessarily very limited, but the observations made show that the caves 
had never been occupied by man, or that all traces of such occupation 
have been destroyed or effaced. 

Material for study and for the purpose of illustrating lectures has 
been sent to persons outside the Museum on several occasions during 
the year, and some of the members of the scientific stafl' of the Museum 
have also borrowed material for use in their investigations. Mr. J. D. 
McGuire, Ellicott City, Md., has studied specimens belonging to the 
department in connection with the preparation of a paper on prehistoric 
pipes. 

In addition to those whose names have already been mentioned, 
twelve others are referred to as having cooperated with the department 
during the year. 

The views of the curator with regard to the policy which he believes 
should be followed in the future are here given : 

Witbin the last ten years the collection in this department has increased from 
65,000 to 209,346 specimens. This material is all nsefnl, not to say necessary, in aid- 
ing to perfect our knowledge of the origin, growth, and culture of prehistoric man. 
But to use it for this purpose requires not a change, but an enlargement of the plan 
heretofore pursued. It is proposed by this enlargement to classify the implements 
and objects as rigidly and in as much detail as possible. This classification or 
division should deal with the object, its form, materia], and function, and extend to 
localities, narrowing them as much as possible. This scheme applied, for example, 
to the State of Pennsylvania, would divide the State into the localities of the Valley 
of the Delaware and Susquehanna on the east, and on the west the Allegheny and 
Monongahela rivers, following them and their branches to the head waters, if need be, 
indepeudeiit of State lines. In this way it would be possible to compare the imple- 
ments of these valleys in three diflferent sections of the State and see what differ- 
ences were manifested. It is hoped, also, that it would be possible to determine the 
difl'erencea in the industry or culture of these localities. The classification of mate- 
rial would probably enable us to assign the stones of which the various implements 
were made, to their respective quarries and localities. A comparison between the 
implements of the various localities thus divided would show the commerce, if it did 
not show the migration, between the various peoples who occupied these localities. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 91 

This scheme should be carried out with all the iraplemeuts and extended to all 
localities, and they should be described correctly, fully, and in detail, each different 
kind having two illustrations, one the large and the other the small size, and one or 
the other of them should have an edge view as well as a side view. When this is 
done, Ave shall have a fairly accurate knowledge of the number and kind, with the 
various differences of form and material, of every implement in the Museum, from 
every locality. 

This can be done only by personal inspection of each object, wherein the cases 
must be opened and the objects handled and counted as they are segregated and 
classitied. This being accomplished, many of tlie specimens now encumbering the 
cases can be retired, and only the type or representative specimeu of each class of 
implements be retained and displayed; the rest of them may be either boxed and 
stored, or may be made up into sets for exchange. The effect of this would be to 
reduce the number of objects on display, but, naturally, the best specimens would be 
chosen, and therefore the beauty and effectiveness of the display would be increased. 
The specimens should be properly figured and described, either in a guide-book or 
label, and each implement exhibited Avould be the representative of a certain num- 
ber of other implements not in sight. Thus, they would stand as though the entire 
number were ou display, and the gorging process now going on would be materially 
relieved. 

We have, during the existence of the Museum, been preparing for this classifica- 
tion and enumeration by the acce})tauce of all kinds of implements in as great a 
number as was obtainable. No fault is found, or to be found, with the policy by 
which this great aggregation of the commoner implements was made. It was neces- 
sary for the purpose indicated; it is still necessary, and should be continued until 
the plan herein suggested shall have been carried out. 

There were 5,826 specimens received during the year, the total num- 
ber now in the department being 20!>,346. The last catalogue entry in 
June, 1895, was 172315, and in June, 1S9G, 173061. 

DEPARTMENT OF ARTS AND INDUSTRIES. 

Technological collections. — Although the number of accessions was not 
large, several very interesting series and single specimens were added 
during the year. A collection of models illustrating the various meth- 
ods of land transportation, and incidentally the development of the 
wheel, was prepared for the Atlanta Exposition, and installed in 
the Museum after its return to Washington. This series embraces 
thirty-nine models, and includes also a number of lithographs and pho- 
tographs of foreign and American vehicles. The electrical collection 
was enriched by the Western Union Telegraph Company, which depos- 
ited the original of the first instrument used to record a message trans- 
mitted to a distant point by means of electricity. Models illustrating 
two electrical wheels, made by Benjamin Franklin in 1748 and described 
in his autobiography, were constructed. Mr. Edward L. Morse depos- 
ited various decorations conferred by foreign sovereigns upon his 
father. 

A fine specimen of balsa, used by the Seri Indians, was received 
from the Bureau of Ethnology, through Mr. W J McGee, who collected 
it in Socorro, Mexico. This specimen was added to the collection 
illustrative of naval architecture. Among the models of steamboats 



92 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 



prepared for the Atlanta Exposition and now installed in tlie Museum 
halls, is a series showing early experiments in steam navigation, includ- 
ing models of steamboats made by Fitch, Rumsey, Fulton, Stevens, and 
Ericsson. A complete model of the steamship Savannah was built 
under the supervision of Capt. J. W. Collins. In the cases containing 
these models are also exhibited important historical relics relating to 
the vessels themselves. 

A valuable series of tanned skins of animals, collected in Panama by 
Mr. K. T. Hill, of the United States Geological Survey, was added to 
the collection of aninml products. 

Regarding the progress made in caring for the various collections, the 
following is quoted from the report of the curator, Mr. J. E. Watkins: 

The collection of boats has been overhauled, and a number of models rejiaired. 
The full-sized boats— kaiaks, dug-outs, etc.— have been rearranged upon the ceiling 
of the hall to a height great enough to admit an additional amount of light. 

Two new cases have been erected in the east hall, and in them the collection illus- 
trating the electrical industries and the collection illustrating methods of land 
transportation, which was received at the close of the Atlanta Exposition, have 
been installed. 

The textile collection, which has been scattered for a number of years, has been 
brought together with a view to revising it and reinstalling such portions as maj'^ be 
deemed advisable. 

The collection of animal products was not put under the care of the curator until 
some weeks after the death of Mr. K. Edward Earll, which occurred in March last, 
and since that time it has not l)een possible to give very much attention to the 
collection. 

The following statement shows the number of specimens received 
during the year, the number of catalogue entries made during the 
same period, and the total number of specimens in the collection :

The graphic arts collection.— Owing to the absence of the curator, Mr. 
S. R. Koehler, during a considerable portion of the preceding fiscal 
year, and also during the first half of the year covered by this report, 
comparatively little has been done toward the development of the 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 93 

collection. The most interesting addition was a "plioto-autocopyist" 
outfit, illustrating a method of printing from gelatinized parchment. 
Fifty-nine specimens were received during the year, most of these hav- 
ing been obtained by the curator during his recent trip to Europe. 
Eighteen specimens of half-tone work in black and in colors were pre- 
sented by Messrs. John Swain & Son, London. Mr. N. S. Amstutz, 
who during the preceding year presented a number of copies of photo- 
graphs transmitted by means of electricity, has otfered to donate some 
models of machinery used by himself. 
Regarding the condition of the collection the curator says: 

The specimens on exhibition speak for themselves. They present the l)e8t illus- 
tration of the technical development of the reproductive or multiplying arts to bo 
found on exhibition anywhere, whether here or in Europe. It is not intended to 
imply, however, that the collection is complete. The division illustrating the 
various methods of drawing and painting is still very incomplete, although full 
of interest even in its present state. In the division illustrating the application of 
printing to the industrial arts, only a beginning has been made. 

A "study series" hardly exists, the specimens in the storage cases being mostly of 
a kind similar to those on exhibition. The collection of patents might be made use- 
ful to students, or rather to seekers of information of a practical kind, but it has 
been almost abandoned, for tlie present at least, and under the prevailing condition 
of things it is inaccessible to the public. 

The collection has now reached such a stage that, according to the 
curator, it is impossible to make satisfactory progress without the 
expenditure of considerable money in the purchase of specimens ; and 
even if funds were available for this purpose, lack of room would seri- 
ously hamper the eftbrts of the curator. 

Mr. Koehler refers to this matter in the following language: 

The section of graphic arts has reached a point where it must rest, unless it is 
supplied more liberally with money. The ground to be covered is as well covered 
as the facilities so far furnished will permit. The collections need piecing out in 
many places, and it is very desirable, also, that some of the specimens now on exhi- 
bition should be replaced by better ones. But this can be done only by the aid of 
money. 

The above applies more especially to the illustrations of the reproductive or mul- 
tiplying arts. The development of the collection illustrating the methods of draw- 
ing and painting must be left to the future. To make it what it might be or ought 
to be, would cost altogether too much money to allow it to be thought of at present. 

Whether it is worth while to continue the effort to illustrate the applications of 
painting in the industrial arts may remain an open question. With a proper expen- 
diture of time and of money, much interesting material could probably be obtained 
for this department from manufacturers. But as there is no room to exhibit the 
specimens that might be thus obtained, it would be useless to make further efforts 
in this direction, even if the money needed were available, until the erection of a 
new building will permit of an enlargement of the section of graphic arts. 

After the reconstruction above outlined, of the division embracing the reproduc- 
tive or multiplying arts, which is and will probably always remain the main division 
of the section, the preparation of a handbook will be in order. Several beginnings 
toward such a handbook have been made, but they had to be abandoned, as the col- 
lections were too incomplete and the changes in them too rapid to make it likely 
that a handbook fitting them would have, permanent value. 



94 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

The number of the last catalogue entry on June 30, 1895, was 5561, 
and on June 30, 1896, 5620. The total number of specimens now in 
the collection, not including duplicates, is 5,620. 

The collections of oriental antiquities and religious ceremonial objects. — 
The collection of oriental antiquities is under the honorary curatorship 
of Dr. Paul Haupt, while Dr. Cyrus Adler occupies the position of 
assistant curator and is also custodian of the collection of religious cere- 
monial objects. There were twenty-eight accessions during the year, 
this being more than three times the number for the preceding year. 
A collection of facsimiles of important codices of the Bible, historical 
editions, and manuscripts was acquired by purchase. Twelve manu- 
scripts and editions of the Bible were deposited by Dr. Adler and 
three by Dr. Goode. A series of Hittite casts was purchased; also a 
cast of a human-headed winged bull, and one of a lion. 

A collection of musical instruments, coins, and gems referred to in 
the Bible has been formed from material transferred from other depart- 
ments in the Museum. 

A series of carved ivory plaques was obtained, in exchange, from 
Prof. H. H. Giglioli, director of the Eoyal Zoological Museum, Flor- 
ence, Italy; and specimens of pottery from the Cotton Grotto at Jerusa- 
lem were presented by Dr. Adler. The accessions also included 
twenty-six photographs from Miss E. E. Scidmore, Washington, D. C; a 
Bible from Dr. S. M. Burnett; seven marble fragments of Greek mytho- 
logical figures from Professor Jerichau, Washington, D. C; and two 
Bibles from Dr. I. M. Casanowicz, of the United States National 
Museum. A model of a Babylonian temple tower was made in the 
Museum. 

An exhibit of biblical objects, comprising about two hundred and 
fifty specimens, was jarepared for the Cotton States and International 
Exposition at Atlanta. This is described more in detail in a paper 
published in Part ii of this volume, in which the results of recent 
discoveries and researches in the domain of biblical and oriental archae- 
ology are also discussed. 

The various objects received during the year have been placed upon 
exhibition, and the present arrangement of the collection is set forth 
m the chapter on the "Development and Arrangement of the Exhibi- 
tion Series." 

A study of Assyrian and Babylonian seals, based upon the collec- 
tions in the Museum, has been begun by Dr. Adler, and two papers 
based upon Museum material have been published by him during the 
year. 

It is proposed to rearrange the Jewish and Mohammedan collections 
and to rearrange, classify, and complete the installation of the collec- 
tions illustrating the religions of Eastern Asia. 

The total number of specimens now in the collection is 3,020, of which 
300 were received during the year j ust closed. The last catalogue entry 
in June, 1895, was 154990, and in June, 1896, 155122.

through exchange with Mrs. J. Crosby Brown: a virginal from Italy, 
secured by purchase; five musical instruments presented by Dr. Wil- 
liam L. Abbott, Bombay, India; a single-headed drum from the island 



96 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

of Gilolo, and a three-joiuted trombone from Sumatra, obtained in 
exclian^ue from Mr. M. F. Savage, New York City; a small bird-shaped 
earthenware whistle, presented by Hon. W. W. Eockhill, Assistant 
Secretary of State; and a musical instrument transmitted by Mr. E. 
O. Schuyler, New York City, in exchange. 

Tliere Avere 43 entries made in the catalogue during the year, 
embracing the same number of specimens. The entire number of 
instruments in the collection is now more than 1,300. 

Mntcria medica. — Owing to the rearrangement of the collections in 
some of the exhibition halls and the temporary removal of the cases 
containing these exhibits, the materia medica collection was rendered 
unavailable for exhibition purposes during the greater part of the year. 
No special effort to increase the collection was made, therefore, by the 
honorary curator, Dr. J. M. Flint, U. S. N., and his efforts therefore have 
been largely directed to the care and preservation of the specimens 
already on hand, and the routine work of the office incident thereto. 

This tem])orary diminution of active work in this section allowed 
the (uirator to devote some time to microscopic work, in which he has 
for many years been interested, and in this connection he X)aid special 
attention to identifying, mounting, and arranging for exhibition a 
series of Foraminifera for the department of marine invertebrates. A 
paper, by the curator, describing a large number of species of Forami- 
nifera, is being prepared by Dr. Flint for publication by the Museum. 

Coincident with his microscopical studies the curator has devised a 
plan for exhibiting microscopical objects not requiring the use of very 
high magnifying powers. The instruments used are shown in plates 
1-4, and they are best described in Dr. Flint's own words : 

The following description and illustrations of apparatus for public exhibition of 
microscopic objects arc presented as being pertinent to the subject of the installation 
of museum exhiliits. The apparatus described is believed to be the first practically 
successful attempt to make a series of such objects available for examination by the 
public, -without extravagaut expense or extreme watchfulness. 

The fust appliance for this purpose, devised by the writer, was an accessory to 
the ordinary microscope stand. It consisted of a circular plate of pasteboard made 
to revolve upon a pivot attached to the stage, the j>late carrying a series of objects 
mounted upon small disks or small squares of glass (Plate 1). This accessory was 
made in 1885, and described in the American Monthly Microscopical Journal for 
November of that year. 

This arrangement was only suitable for class use under the immediate supervi- 
sion of the instructor. For public use the principle of the rotary stage has been 
developed by enlarging the circular plate, inclosing it securely in a box with a glass 
top upon which the microscope is fastened, giving a rotary motion to the stage by 
means of a friction roller operated by a milled head on the outside of the box, and 
a to-and-lro movement effected by a rack and pinion controlled by another milled 
head in close proximity to the former. By a combination of the two movements any 
])<'rt ion ot the plate may be brought under the microscope, and any number of objects 
arranged thereon be brought into the held in succession. The objects being inclosed 
in the l)ox are secure from injury; the movement of the microscope for focal adjust- 
ment is limited by stops so that the object can not be entirely lost to view ; the eye- 
pieces are screwed in so that they can not be stolen, and the instrument is practi-

cally safe from everything but malicious mischief. Special mounts are required in 
order to increase the carrying capacity of the stage, and for transparent objects thb 
stage must be perforated in order that the light may pass upward from the reflector 
below. The instrument now in use in the Museum (Plate 2) was made in the year 
1890, has been modified in a few details sinc(^, and has successfully endured manip- 
ulation by thousands of inexpert hands — of children as well as adults — without 
injury, and this without attendant supervision of any kind. 

For the purpose of exhibiting a series of preparations mounted in the usual way 
upon glass slips or ''slides," an entirely difterent form of ajiparatus has been de- 
vised (Plates 3 and 4). An indefinite number of slides — from 10 to 100 — are attached 
to an endless band of linen by means of thin brass holders which allow the slides to 
be changed when desired. This linen band passes over two rollers mounted upon a 
light brass frame which occupies the place of the "stage" of an ordinary micro- 
scope. The loops'of the band hang free. One of the rollers has a projecting pivot 
with a milled head by means of which it may be rotated, and the two rollers are 
connected by a narrow belt at each end. As the rollers are made to revolve, the 
band carrying the slides passes horizontally under the microscope, resting mean- 
while upon the two narrow belts and being kept at a definite distance from the 
objective of the microscope by two guides, which press upon the slides from above. 
The brass frame rests upon a grooved bed-plate which permits a lateral movement 
of the frame. This lateral motion is controlled by a screw operated by means of a 
second milled head in convenient proximity to the one giving the tu-and-fro motion. 
As in the other instrument, tlie-siiecimens and nearly all parts of the mechanism are 
inclosed in a box secured by a lock, the only exposed pai'ts being the microscope and 
the two milled heads controlling the motion of the slides. The advantages of this 
form of apparatus are that the usual glass slide, 3 inches long by 1 inch wide, 
upon which microscopic objects are usually mounted, may be used, and especially 
that the focal distance is not disturbed by difterences in thickness of the glass slides. 
The only disadvantage is that the mechanism is somewhat more delicate and com- 
plicated than in the other instrument and requires some little protection from the 
thoughtless violence of curious children. Microscopes copied from the original here 
described have been in use for several years, and no irremediable difficulties have 
been found in the way of their perfectly successful operation. 

It is .safe to say, from present experience, that these methods of installation of 
microscopic exhibits promise to open a new and interesting field of observation and 
study to museum visitors. 

Physical apparatus. — Mr. W. 0. Winlock remains in charge of tliis 
section as honorary curator. During the year there were deposited in 
the Museum by the Smithsonian Institution twelve pieces of elec- 
trical apparatus supposed to have been used by Professor Henry in his 
laboratory work at the Institution; also sixteen photographs of early 
electrical apparatus. These photographs were made under the direc- 
tion of Miss Henry and were exhibited at the World's Columbian 
Exposition in 1893. A number of pieces of apparatus were purchased 
by the Smithsonian Institution and deposited in the Museum, includ- 
ing a pocket dial with compass, five sand-glasses, a Japanese clock, 
an iron clock dial, a hexagonal clock with three dials, and an hour- 
glass.

IV.— REVIEW OF WORK IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE 

DEPARTMENTS. 

FINANCE, PROPERTY, SUPPLIES, AND ACCOUNTS. 

In Appendix viii will be found a statement sliowing the amount of 
the appropriations for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896, the dis- 
bursements under said appropriations, and the disposition of the unex- 
pended balances remaining on hand from the appropriations of previous 
years. These statements are taken from the report of the chief clerk, 
Mr. W. V. Cox. 

The routine work of the office, consisting of the preparation of finan- 
cial statements, of orders for the jiurchase of supplies and for the 
performance of services, the approval and registration of requisitions 
for supplies, the examination of vouchers, etc., has been carried on. 
More than 1,500 letters were prepared. 

The preparation of a suitable subject index to the letters sent from 
this office since 1885 was also taken up during the year. Seventeen 
thousand pages have been indexed on slips and are now being arranged 
for revision, after which they will be transcribed on cards for permanent 
reference. A complete record, on index cards, of all legislative matters 
of interest to the Institution has also been kept. 

The building at the corner of Third and B streets, S. W., used for 
workshops and storage for the Museum, did not prove satisfactory for 
the purpose required, and a large warehouse on Ninth street, about 
three squares south of the Museum, was leased instead. 

Congress having made an appropriation of $800 for the better pro- 
tection of the Smithsonian and Museum buildings from fire, four new 
hydrants were placed in position during the year and a quantity of 
new hose purchased. The hydrants were put in under the supervision 
of the engineer department of the District of Columbia. As an addi- 
tional safeguard, a number of fire extinguishers has been procured, 
and the watch force is drilled regularly in fire duty. 

A granito floor was laid in the exhibition hall of the department of 
comparative anatomy, and a mosaic floor in the vestibule at the north 
entrance of the Museum building. 

In connection with the Cotton States and International Exposition 
at Atlanta, Ga., there were issued a large number of orders for the 
purchase of material and for services. Nearly three hundred accounts 
were audited for payment, involving expenditures amounting to 
$24,246.73, and more than three hundred letters were written. All 
claims on account of the Museum exhibit have been settled, with a 
98 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 99 

balance of $3.21 remaining from the allotment of $24,250 for the prepa- 
ration, installation, maintenance, and return of the exhibit. 

Mr. Oox assumed charge of the exhibit at Atlanta from November 
9 to December 10, 1895, during the absence of Mr. E. E. Earll. 

CORRESPONDENCE AND REPORTS. 

This division remains under the charge of Mr. R. I. Geare. The 
ofiice force includes two stenographers, one accession clerk, four index 
and record clerks, one tile clerk, one comi)iler and proofreader, two 
typewriters, and one messenger. The technical correspondence of the 
Museum has steadily increased each year, and in 1895-9G more than 
12,000 letters and other official papers were prepared in this office. 
The formal acknowledgment of, and official correspondence connected 
with, accessions to the Museum collections forms a special feature. 
This division is also cliarged with the preparation and proof reading of 
the administrative portion of the Annual Report of the Museum and 
the proofreading and general editorial supervision of the pajiers in the 
Appendix. For several years also the distribution of all Museum 
publications has formed part of the work of this office. This entails a 
large amount of routine work, such as tlie preparation of labels, the 
revision of the mailing lists, etc. As a rule, about 15,000 volumes and 
40,000 separates are distributed each year to libraries and individuals 
on tlie regular mailing lists. In addition, ;),000 to 4,000 applications 
for special papers and volumes are received annually. 

During the year were distributed the Report of the Museum for 1893, 
Volume XVII of Proceedings of the ISTational Museum, the separate 
papers iu Volume xviii (No. 1033 to 1082, excepting three papers which 
were delayed), and the last paper (No. 1032) in Volume xvii. Advance 
sheets of two papers containing descriptions of remarkable new genera 
and species of batrachians and crustaceans obtained by the United 
States Fish Commission from an artesian well at San Marcos, Tex., and 
a third, containing preliminary diagnoses of new mammals from the 
Mexican border of the United States, collected by Dr. E. A. Mearns, 
United States Army, of the International Boundary Commission, have 
been printed and distributed. These papers will appear in Volume 
xviii of Proceedings. 

A supplemental edition of Part "F" of Bulletin No. 39, ''Directions 
for Collecting and Preserving Insects," by the late Prof. C. Y. Riley, 
was received from the printer in September, and hardly a day passes 
in which several requests for it are not received; nearly 4,000 copies 
have been already distributed. 

Circular No. 47 was issued during the year. The purpose of this 
pamphlet is to specify the conditions upon which the Museum will 
undertake the examination of mollusks sent for identification. The 
sending of material of this kind to the Museum has increased very 
greatly during recent years, and as in almost every instance its return 



100 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

was expected, the curator of the department of mollusks found it very 
desirable to at least impose certain conditions upon persons desiring to 
obtain expert determinations from tbe Museum in this direction. 

Special effort is now being directed to the work of revising the mail- 
ing lists. 

The list of libraries is being carefully scrntinized with a view to utiliz- 
ing the small editions to the best advantage. It is proposed to include 
libraries which have attained to the number of 10,000 volumes since 
the list was first prepared, as well as to insure the representation on the 
list of all towns which contain more than 10,000 inhabitants. 

REGISTRATION AND DISTRIBUTION. 

The registrar, Mr. S. C. Brown, states that there were received dur- 
ing the year 25,249 packages of all kinds, including material for addi- 
tion to the collections, publications, and supplies. 

There were 3,195 packages sent out, of which 637 contained speci- 
mens transmitted to educational institutions as gifts, or sent to 
individuals or institutions in exchange or for study. A few specimens 
returned to owners are also included in this number. The entries 
made on the incoming transi)ortation record numbered 2,910 and on 
the outgoing transportation record 1,487, there being an increase of 
about 250 entries in the case of the former record and of more than 
700 in the latter. 

The number of accessions or "lots" of material received was 1,299, 
an increase of 70 over the record for the preceding year. There was 
also an increase of 75 in the "temporary" accessions, consisting of 
material received for identification, the total for the present year hav- 
ing been 542. About 27,000 specimens of all kinds have been sent out 
as gifts or in exchange, and about 3,000 specimens have been lent for 
study. 

Of the entire number of objects donated to educational establish- 
ments perhaps two-thirds consisted of fishes and marine invertebrates. 
The remainder was composed largely of geological specimens and casts 
of prehistoric implements. 

Several special collections of fishes were prepared in the fall of 1895 
from material received from the United States Fish Commission. 
These were transmitted to the following institutions : Oberlin College, 
Oberlin, Ohio; State Normal School, Mankato, Minn.; High School, 
Duluth, Minn.; Arkansas Industrial University, Fayetteville, Ark.; 
University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebr.; Iowa State University, Iowa 
City, Iowa; Indiana University, Bloomington, Ind.; Museum of Com- 
parative Zoology, Cambridge, Mass. ; Leland Stanford Junior Univer- 
sity, Stanford University, Cal. 

A few montlis later eight special collections of fishes, prepared from 
specimens obtained by the United States Fish Commission in the North 
Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea, were sent to the following establish-

University of Washington, Seattle, Wash. 

The storage record shows that 305 packages were placed in storage, 
while 143 were withdrawn. 

In Appendix ix will be found a statement, arranged geographically,

of fuel, gas, and ice consumed, the cost of supplies purchased for the 
department of buildings and labor, and the many items of work per- 
formed in addition to those mentioned in the appendix. 

WORK OF THE MUSEUM PREPARATORS. 

TAXIDERMISTS. 

Mr. William Palmer continues to fill the position of chief taxidermist. 
He reports that five mammals were mounted during tlie year, three of 
them being intended for exhibition at the Cotton States and Inter- 
national Exi)ositiou at Atlanta. Thirty-seven mammals were cleaned 
for this exhibit, and several were placed upon new stands. The groups 
of Kocky Mountain sheep and goats were dismounted and packed for 
shipment to Atlanta. 

In addition to the exposition work above mentioned, ten specimens 
were cleaned, poisoned, and placed upon new stands.

During the year ninety mammals were received and skinned. Of 
this number more than one-half came from the IsTational Zoological 
Park, as will be seen from the following table :

In addition, thirty-seven specimens of mammals, birds, reptiles, etc., 
were received from the Zoological Park and transferred immediately 
to other departments in the Museum. 

Many of the bodies of the mammals skinned were turned over to the 
Bureau of Animal Industry, Department of Agriculture, for examina- 
tion as to the cause of death, and for the purpose of ascertaining if 
they contained parasites. A few were sent to the Army Medical 
Museum, and others were retained by the department of comparative 
anatomy in the National Museum. 

A large number of skins were received to be remade, mounted, etc. 
Some of these were dry, while others were fresh or salted.

Of the large amount of miscellaneous work performed during the 
year the following items may be mentioned: Sixteen seal skins and a 
number of other large skins were cleaned preparatory to mounting; an 
antelope and several smaller mammals were mounted, although not 
entirely finished; a large sea lion was skinned; more than one hundred 
mounted mammals were crated, with a view to placing them in storage, 
and a large model of the National Zoological Park was made. 

Casts were made of the following objects: Nine Egyptian inscrip- 
tions, two gold ornaments for the new Congressional Library building, 
two lizards, and a stone tablet. 

Mr. Joseph Palmer was engaged for nearly the entire year on work 
for other departments in the Museum and for the Atlanta Exposition. 

Mr. Henry Marshall, taxidermist of the department of birds, cleaned 
and renovated about 700 specimens in the exhibition series. Although 
this is a much smaller number than was attended to last year, the

decrease is readily explained by the fact that tlie birds now being- 
cleaned are larger and reqnire a greater amount of care and labor. 
Four birds were mounted, and several poorly mounted specimens were 
reduced to skins. Twenty-seven birds, received in the flesh, including 
two young ostriches, were skinned for the study series. 

OSTEOLOGIST. 

There were cleaned for the department of mammals during the year 
607 skulls, and for the Department of Agriculture 539 skulls (many of 
them being of the larger mammals), making a total of 1,146. Thirty- 
two other speciruens were also cleaned, 29 of them having been received 
in the flesh. Eighteen specimens were mounted, exclusive of the work 
done for the exhibit at the Cotton States and International Exposi- 
tion at Atlanta. Eeference was made last year to the preparation of a 
skeleton of Zeuglodon for this exhibit. This work was completed, and 
several other skeletons were prepared for the same purpose. 

The synoptic series of invertebrates and the series of wax models 
showing the development, from the embryo, of the trout, frog, chicken, 
etc., were packed up and sent to Atlanta. This work required excep- 
tional care, owing to the nature of the specimens. Considerable time 
was necessarily spent in repacking the material for return to Wash- 
ington at the close of the Exi)osition, and in installing it in the Museum.

PHOTOGRAPHER. 



The photographer, Mr. T. W. Smillie, reports that 1,638 negatives 
have been made during the year. Many of these were for the depart- 
ments of ethnology, mammals, geology, anthropology, oriental antiqui- 
ties and religious ceremonials, botany, and technology. In addition, 



106 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

1,022 platinum prints, 316 silver prints, 321 cyanotypes, and 5 lantern 
slides were made. Considerable miscellaneous work was also done, 
such as numbering and tiling- negatives, testing inks, restoring large 
pictures for exhibition, and developing negatives brought in by col- 
lectors. 

COI.ORIST. 

Mr. A. Zeno Shindler has continued the work of cleaning and restor- 
ing such of the paintings in the Oatlin Indian gallery as required 
attention. He has also continued work upon the series of paintings 
representing the races of men, nine pictures having now been com- 
pleted. In addition, two life-size casts of Indians have been painted, 
and other incidental work attended to.

This paper includes the description of mol- 
lusks and brachiopods dredged on the Archl- 
benthal plateau about the Hawaiian Islands, 
as well as others obtained by the Albatross on 
the western coast of America. A large num- 
ber of siiecies hitherto uniigured are fully illus- 
trated, and twenty-nine new species, four new 
subgenera, two new genera, and one new family 
are described. The types of all are in the Mu- 
seum. Apart from descriptions of new forms the 
most important feature of the paper is found 
iu the anatomical data relating to the genera 
Euciroa and Halicardia, Callocardia and Lyon- 
siella, the subgenus Spergo of the Pleuroto- 
niidre, Ancistrolepis of the Buccinidfe, and the 
brachiopod genus Frieleia. It is shown that 
in the genus Halicardia a peripedal septum is 
formed by a thick outgrowth from the mantle 
independent of the gills and siphonal septum : 
that in Euciroa and Callocardia the gills differ 
in very important characters from those of 
their nearest relatives, and incidentally that 
the subdivision of the pelecypods into orders 
based on differences of the gills alone is unnat- 
ural and can not be maintained. A peculiar 
organ, the opisthopodium, discovered many 
years ago in Plwladomya, by Owen, is shown 
to exist also in JIalicardia, and is suitably 
illustrated.

MASON, Otis Tufton. Footgear. 
Science (New series), iii, 1890, p. 598. 
This communication draws attention to the 
fact that the footgear of the American Indians 
in the areas occupied by the Latin American 
race in aboriginal times, to wit, Middle and 
South America, bad two toe strings, or a loop 
inclosing two toes, while in 7)ost-Columbian

Science (New series), in, 1896, pp. 868. 869. 
The object of this communication is to draw 
attention to the work of Dr. Fred. Me3'er, and 
the existence of a long area between the 
Atlantic slope of the Andes and the Brazilian 
Highlands where the types of bows and arrows 
are of a decidedly mixed character, as are also 
the peoples. 

Introduction of the Iron Age into 

America. 

Am. Anthropologist, IX, 1896, pp. 191-215. 
This p.apcr c.ills attention to the profound 
impression made upon the American aborigines 
from the very first by the importation into 
their country, in large numbers, of the Ccun- 
moQ mechanics and laborers of Europe, as well 
as of slaves from Africa. Vestiges of African 
arts, and of the folk arts of Europe in the 
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, cropped out 
in many ])laces, and friiquently these arts are 
confounded with those of the aborigines. 

Comparison of the Zuili with the 

Finnish belt-weaving apparatus. 

Globus, Braunschweig, lxix, 1896, pp.

This paper calls attention to the identity of 
the lieddle used by the Zuni Indians inweav- 
ing their garters and belts and the apparatus 
used bj' the Finns in northwestern Russia for 
the same ]>urpose, and maintains that this 
likeness is not due to the similar causes oper- 
ating under similar circumstances, but tliat in 
it we have a good example of acculturation.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 



SHUFELDT, Robert W.— Continued. 

There is a widespread zoological myth enter- 
tained by the huuters aud .sportsmen of the 
United States, to the effect that male sqnirrels 
habitually castrate each other at the season of 
tlie rut. Tliis myth finds its origin in the 
demand of the ignorant for some explanation 
to account for the disappearance of the testes 
in the Sciuridiu after the breeding season is 
over. This brief article gives the true expla- 
nation of the physiology of these organs in the 
Eodentia. 

The mystery of eels. 

Popular Science News, xxx, No. 1, New 
York, Jan., 1896, pp. 2, 3. 
The original title of this contribution read 
"Eels and their Allies," but without the au- 
thor's permission the editor changed it to the 
one here given, and under which the article 
appeared. It is needless to say there is no 
"mystery" connected with eels. 

.The article gives a great deal of general in- 
formation on the natural history of this group 
of fishes, rendered in a popular style, and 
illustrated by a reduced copy of Anguilla roi- 
trata, drawn by the author after Goode's figure 
in his "Fishery Industries of the United 
States;" Several references are made to the 
publications of the National Museum. 

The Moose group in the National 

Museum. 

Shooting and Fishing, ix. No. 19, New 
York, Feb. 27, 1896, pp. 387-389. 
Contains an account of the collecting and 
mounting of the famous group of Moose in the 
mammal hall of the U. S. National Museum. 
The article is illu.strated by four half-tones, 
from photographs, of the various specimens 
composing the group. 

More facts about squirrels. 

Am. Field, XLV, No. 9, New York and 
Chicago, Feb. 29, 1896, p. 198. 
A further attempt to dispel the ignorance of 
many hunters throughout the country in the 
matter of tlie disappearance of the testes, dur- 
ing the rutting season, in the Sciuridae. 

More about animal photography. 

Mdologist, in. No. 6, New York, Feb., 
1896, pp. 57, 58. 
Contains additional information upon the 
methods of making photographs of living 
animals, and refers to the remarkable work in 
this line accomplished by M. Bontan, the 
European naturalist. The contribution is 
illustrated by a fine half-tone from a photograph 
of a living specimen of the young of the "Jack 
Rabbit," made by Mr. H. W. Nash, of Pueblo, 
Colo.

young in a silken ball. It is natural size, and 
was t.aken from the living spider. Another 
figure, from a drawing by the author, gives a

or " lower " as a matter of design, or simply to 
get rid of the earth pellets rolled up during the 
excavation of its burrow, is discussed. 

Dr. Shufeldt agrees with Prof. Kalph S. Tarr 
in the premises that no design is implied on the 
part of the crayfish in these structures, and the 
only intention of the animal is to get rid of the 
earth balls it brings up while engaged in form- 
ing its Ijurrow. Dr. C. C. Abbott holds a con- 
verse view. The article is illustrated by a

SHUFELDT, Robert W.— Continued. 

Brings up to date our knowledge of the nidi- 
tication of the two American representatives of 
the genus Coccothravstes, with other interest- 
ing matter added. The articleis illustrated by 
a half-tone cut made from a photograph reduc- 
ing a life-size colored drawing of Dr. Shufeldt'.s 
of a pair of adult specimens of the Evening 
Grosbeak. This drawing has a peculiar his- 
tory, as stated in the article.

North American Birds. Gives, in tabulated 
form, the additions of birds to the list since 
the appearance of the first edition, as well as 
those removed from it. The List of Fossil 
Birds of North America is similarly dealt with ; 
■while finally the matter of the classification 
adopted is taken in band, and shown to be, in 
many instances, antiquated and eminently un- 
natur.il.

is illustrated by drawings made by Dr. Shufeldt, 
one of the Mitre-Shell, Mitre episcopalis, and 
six otliers showing the various characters of 
shells. In the course of the article occasion is 
taken to invite attention to the conchological 
collections of the U. S. National Museum, and 
especially to the fine series of shells in the ex.

Frogs and their uses. 

Appleton's Popular Science Monthly, XLix, 
No. 2, New Tork, June, 1896, pp. 179-185. 
An article inviting attention to the numer- 
ous uses frogs are put to, both in the biological 
laboratories and elsewhere. Between the 
lines, this is an address to the antivivisec- 
tionists, showing how indispensable it is to 
have the use of living animal forms wherewith 
to demonstrate biological truths, especially in 
medicine and physiology. A fine half-tone of 
Panacatesbiana, from a photograph of a living 
specimen, by the author, illustrates the contri- 
bution.

Description of four new species of

Proc. V. S. Nat. Mus., xvni, No, 1072, May 
19, 1896, pp. 381-385, flgs. 1-5. 
This is a description of Unios believed to be 
Triassic. These four forms exhibit a remark- 
able diversity in form, sculpture, hinge, and 
other characters, and indicate that the genus 
Tlnio had long been established at the time 
these species were living. Specimens from the 
type lot and casts from types are in the National 
Museum collection. 

The classification and geographi- 
cal distribution of the pearly fresh 
water mussels. 

Proc. TJ. S. NM- Mus., svin, No. 1068, May 
19, 1896, pp. 295-343, pi. ix. 

This paper briefly reviews the history of the 
classification of the Naiades, and proposes a 
new one in part, based on all the characters, 
but more especially on those of the hinge and 
embryos. Those genera which have taxodont 
teeth or vestiges of them, and i)ass through a 
larval stage called "lasidium," are placed in 
the family Mutelidae, while those having schizo- 
dont teeth or their vestiges, and which pass 
through a glochidinm stage, are classified 
under the Unionidie, and the families and 
genera are defined. 

It is held that the Naiades are distributed in 
eight regions or provinces, viz: Ethiopian, 
Palearctic, Oriental, and Australian in the Old 
World; a part of the Palearctic region, the 
Mississippi, Atlantic, Central American, and 
Neotropical provinces in the New World.

found in the St. Lawrence and Atlantic

Am. Naturalist, xxx. No. 353, May 20, 
1896, pp. 379-384. 

This paper shows that the extralimital Mis- 
sissippi Valley Unionida) found in the St. Law- 
rence Basin are iisually dwarfed and dull 
colored, and the claim is made that many of the 
so-c.illed species of the latter region are merely 
depauperate varieties of well-known Missis- 
sippi Valley forms which have become changed 
since they have occupied the waters they now 
inhabit. The theory is advanced that these 
species migrated northward at the close of the 
glacial epoch, by way of old streams that flowed 
from lakes in the north into the Mississippi 
Valley at that time, as the ice cap to the north 
and northeast prevented drainage to the north 
and east.

The original colony must have been restricted 
in number and locality. It grew in numbers 
and spread to other localities, until the Indian 
population increased to millions, and covered 
the two continents. This required a long 
period of time. The original colony must have 
had but one language, but by extension and 
separation it acquired now ones, until the num- 
ber amounted to nearly two hundred.

APPENDIX X. 

The Work of the Mechanics and Laborers. 

The following is an abstract of the report of the suj)erintendent of 
buildings, Mr. Henry Horan, so far as it relates to the work of the 
mechanics and laborers. 

1895. 

July. — Repairs were made in the south tower and in other portions of the 
Smithsonian building. Several crates of cases were brought from storage and 
packed for shipment to the Cotton States and International Exposition at 
Atlanta. Exhibits from the departments of minerals and paleontology were 
shipped to the Exposition during the month. In the room adjoining the dynamo 
room the floor was lowered and a large brick column removed. 

August. — The cases containing material for the Atlanta Exposition w^ere placed 
in the storage sheds south of the Smithsonian building as soon as jjacked, to await 
shipment, and later 117 boxes and crates were forwarded. A number of push 
buttons, connected with the annunciator in the telephone room, were placed at 
different points in the Miiseum building. The collection of the section of physical 
apiDaratus was removed from the cases on the first floor of the south tower of the 
Smithsonian building, and a portion of the instruments placed on exhibition in 
the east hall of the Museum. Workmen were engaged for several days in taking 
the boats from the ceiling in the hall where they are exhibited, measuring them, 
and returning them to their former positions. 

September. — The work of shipping exhibits to the Atlanta Exposition was com- 
pleted early in the month. The lecture hall was thoroughly cleaned, new matting 
laid, etc. The sheds in the rear of the Smithsonian Institution were painted. 
New book-cases were made and placed in the oflBce of the Assistant Secretary. 
In many places the worn-out floors of the Museum were taken up and replaced 
with new material. All the large cases were moved from the rotunda, and small 
ones containing models of cliff-dwellings placed therein. Several new fire-plugs 
were placed in the grounds near the buildings. A chimney-flue was constructed 
from the second floor to the roof of the northwest pavilion. 

October. — The floors in the offices of the Assistant Secretary and chief clerk were 
planed and cleaned. Wires were run to connect a signal bell in the department 
of materia medica with the telephone room, and the wires running from the 
Museum to the Department of Agriculture were overhauled. The top of the old 
well south of the Smithsonian Institution was arched over with brick. A new 
telephone instrument was put up in the office of the superintendent. The door- 
way leading from the vestibule to the stairway on the first floor of the northwest 
pavilion was altered, the opening being enlarged to a wide archway. Steam pipes 
were run from the boilers in the Smithsonian building to the east end of the shed 
just outside. The telephone wires were disconnected from the overhead cable and 
connected to the underground cable. The vestibule of the northwest entrance 
was wainscoated. 

November. — Two radiators were placed in one of the sheds, and the pipe coils 
altered and improved. Water pipes were also placed in the same shed and a sink 
constructed. The lecture hall was put in readiness for the meeting of the Amer- 
ican Ornithologists' Union. A radiator was placed in one of the rooms adjoining 

281 



282 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

the east balcony. A workroom was fitted up for the plumber and pipe fitter. 
Incandescent electric lamps were put up in the coal vault and other cellars of the 
Museum. The work of painting the outside of the Museum building was com- 
menced. 

Deceinher. — Incandescent electric lamps were put up in the library. All the 
locks on the doors in the Museum were put in order, keys refitted, new ones made 
where necessary, and the records revised to correspond with the alterations and 
additions. The exhibition cases in the mineral hall were rearranged and four 
additional cases placed therein. The work of painting the outside of the Museum 
was continued: the walls in the east hall were also painted. The exhibition cases 
in the fisheries hall were rearranged. Two iron hitching-posts were placed at 
the east entrance of the Museum. A platform for the exhibition of certain large 
specimens was constructed in the east hall, and a heavy base for the serpent 
column of Delphi was made and set up. 

1806. 

January. — The lecture hall was put in order for the meeting of the National 
Science Club. An excavation was made in the basement of the Smithsonian build- 
ing, and the space thus obtained, after having the floor and sides bricked up, 
was used for the reception of a small heating boiler. Six fire extinguishers were 
placed in different parts of the Museum building. Some additional cases were set 
up in the north hall. The fisheries hall was screened off for the reception of the 
exhibits returned from the Atlanta Exposition. The erection of a small gallery, to 
be used for storage cases for the herbarium, was commenced. 

February. — Much time was spent during this month in receiving, making space 
for, unpacking, and setting up in their proper departments the exhibits returned 
from the Atlanta Exjjosition. The three cases containing the Copp collection of 
New England historical and domestic objects were removed from the north hall 
to the lecture hall, to be x)hotographed . The work of putting up the gallery for 
the herbarium was completed, and work commenced on the cases to be placed 
thereon. A large group belonging to the department of ethnology was installed 
in a case and placed in the rotunda of the Museum. The skeleton of Zeuglodon 
was hung from the ceiling of the southeast court. In the departments of minerals 
and comparative anatomy workmen were engaged in putting down concrete bases 
upon which to erect wall cases. 

March. — In addition to the large amount of work required of the laborers in con- 
nection with the arrangement and installation of the material returned from the 
Atlanta Exposition, much other work was performed. The old Mexican cart was 
suspended from the ceiling of the east hall, and the platform on which it formerly 
rested was removed. All the material from the Third-street annex was transferred 
to the new storage hoiTse on Ninth street. The model of the locomotive exhibited 
on the platform over one of the windows in the east hall was taken down, and the 
platform removed. The Siamese cart was suspended from the ceiling, opposite 
the Mexican cart. All the material stored in the lecture hall was removed, and 
the hall cleaned and put in complete order for the regular course of Saturday after- 
noon lectures. Several of the pier screens in the mineral hall were lowered to con- 
form with the others. Wires were placed under the floor of the lecture hall, from 
the desk to the stand used by the lantern operator. 

April. — Material from the osteological and other work rooms was removed to 
the Ninth street annex. The plaster casts of the winged bull and lion were placed 
in i^osition at the entrance to the east hall, and two large wooden idols were taken 
off their bases and placed on the balconies west of the rotunda. The three large 
railroad maps which were mounted on the south wall of the east hall were taken 
down and placed on the front of east balcony. All the cases were removed from 



MECHANICS AND LABORERS. 283 

the rotunda. In anticipation of the meeting of the National Academy of Sciences, 
the lecture hall was cleaned. The work of taking down and remounting the cases 
in the east-south range, preparatory to laying an artificial stone floor, was com- 
menced. The exhibition cases in the boat hall were removed to the fisheries hall 
to make room for the rearrangement of the boats on the walls and ceiling. The 
work of constructing new mahogany wall cases in the east hall was completed 
and the cases painted. The large arch screen at the east entrance to the Museum 
was altered. 

3Iay. — One of the large wall screens in the east hall was strengthened, with a 
view to mounting the Hittite casts thereon. A large Indian war canoe was sus- 
pended from the ceiling of the Ijoat hall. Painters commenced work on the storage 
sheds at the armory. The models of the locomotives '"Arabian" and "Tom 
Thumb'" were mounted on floor cases in the east hall. 

June. — The idols from Easter Island were naoved from the vestibule and placed 
outside the north entrance to theMiTseum. The storm doors at the north entrance 
were removed, certain woodwork cut away, and the top step reset. The old floor 
inside the north entrance was taken up, and other preliminary matters attended to 
preparatory to commencing work on the proposed improvements in the vestibule. 
A section of gallery was put up in the hall of geology and a case placed thereon, to 
test the api)earance and effect of the galleries under contemplation. The seats 
along the wall of north hall were cleaned and oiled. 

In addition to the work of the mechanics, already mentioned, there 
were constructed in the shops of the Museum 38 moth-proof quarter- 
unit cases, 8 pine quarter-unit cases, 2 special unit cases, 2 oak and 
3 pine book-cases, 3 pine catalogue-cases, 1 pine shelf-case, 5 pine 
storage-cases, 3 cases of drawers, 4 pine cases for lay figures, 1 pine 
case for holding papers, 3 cupboards, 2 closets, 192 unit drawers, 2 case 
drawers, 4 pier-screens, 2 floor-screens and 2 arch-screens, 4 step- 
ladders and 2 tables, besides many other articles. 

The following is a partial list of cases, furniture, fittings, etc., 
repaired and altered: Six book-cases, 1 card catalogue-case, 1 key case, 
9 pine bases, 5 oak bases, 12 unit boxes, 3 exhibition cases, 2 storage 
cases, 35 chairs, 4 case doors, 22 other doors, 462 unit drawers, 4 case 
drawers, 1,000 label-holders, 9 window sash, 20 floor, arch, and-\vindow 
screens, 00 shelves for cases, and 2 tables. 

Other incidental work included the following items: Cases painted, 
10; fire buckets lettered, 29; fire buckets lined with tin, 21; exhibi- 
tion blocks made, 5,523; exhibition blocks painted, 5,469; exhibition 
blocks ebonized, 74; unit boxes painted, 14; unit boxes mounted on 
sci-eens, 69; unit boxes fitted to cases, 140; door-screen cases, etc., 
painted, 18; doors i:)ainted, 9; unit drawers fitted to cases, 462; doors 
of cases, etc., glazed, 59; locks put on cases, etc., 80; case shelves

painted, 3; transparencies lettered, 32; transparencies mounted, 31; 
ventilators put on windows, 12. 

A large amount of work has been accomplished under the direction 
of the engineer. The covering of the steam pipes in the trenches has 
been removed and replaced with new nuiterial. The pipe dies used 
by the steam fitter have received attention, and are now in j^erfect

coudition. The height of the exhaust pipe of the gas engine in the 
Museum cai'ijenter shop was increased, in order to carry the exhaust 
above the windows in the main building. A number of electric lights 
were installed, as indicated above, and several changes were made in 
the location of steam radiators. The time and watch clocks received 
careful attention, and have given good results during the year. The 
furnaces were repaired, and new grate bars provided. Automatic oil 
feeders were placed upon the pumps. The boiler rooms and vaults 
of both buildings were painted and whitewashed.

AN ACCOUNT OF THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



By Frederick W. True. 



Among the powers couferred on Congress by the Constitution is 
authority " to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by secur- 
ing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to 
their respective writings and discoveries."^ A result of this provision 
was the establishment of the Patent OfiBce and the assembling in 
connection therewith of numerous models of inventions. 

A building for the Patent Office was erected in 1812, but it was 
destroyed by fire in 1836, and with it the models and records it 
contained. 

" In the Patent Office building and with it destroyed," writes Dr. 
Goode,^ "there was gathered a collection of models which was some- 
times by courtesy called the 'American Museum of Arts,' and which 
aftbrded a precedent for the larger collection of models and natural 
products, which remained under the custody of the Commissioner of 
Patents until 1858, when it was transferred to the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion and became a part of the present National Museum." 

Though an assemblage of objects of more or less scientific interest 
was thus early formed as an indirect result of the policy pursued by 
the Government, the establishment of a national museum was earlier 
in the minds of many American statesmen, especially in connection 
with the educational institutes which it was thought the Government 
should found for the intellectual advancement of the people. 

In the plan for a Federal university published in the Pennsylvania 
Gazette in 1788, and commonly credited to Madison,^ section 8 relates 
to natural history, and in connection therewith the remark is made : 

To render instruction in these branches of science easy, it will be necessary to 
establish a museum, and also a garden, in which not only all the shrubs, etc., but 
all the forest trees of the United States should be cultivated.

close of the first fifty years of the existence of the Smithsonian Institutiou, entitled

21>0 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

The plan for a "Natioual Institution" put forth by Joel Barlow iu 
180G includes mention of the natural history and art museums of France 
in the preamble, and in the plan itself (though ambiguously worded) 
are provisions for collections of minerals and philosophical instruments. 

While these and other similar plans show that the formation of 
national collections of art and science was thought desirable by the 
fathers, they did not result directly in the establishment of museums 
under the Cxovernment. The first really scientific collection that came 
into the possession of the Government was probably, as Dr. Goode has 
remarked,' Smithson's cabinet of minerals, which was delivered, with 
the remainder of the Smithson estate, into the hands of Eichard Eush, 
the agent of the United States, iu 1838. The collection is described 
by a committee of the National Institute as follows : 

Among tbe eifects of the late Mr. Smithson is a cabinet which, so far as it has been 
examined, proves to consist of a choice and beautiful collection of minerals, com- 
prising probably eight or ten thousand specimens. The specimens, though gener- 
ally small, are extremely perfect, and constitute a very complete geological and 
mineralogical series, embracing the finest varieties of crystallization, rendered more 
valuable by accompanying figures and descriptions by Mr. Smithson, and in his own 
writing. The cabinet also contains a valuable suite of meteoric stones, which appear 
to be suites of most of the important meteorites which have fallen in Europe during 
several centuries. 

Three years later, in 1841, there was formed in Washington, chiefly 
through the exertions of Hon. Joel E. Poinsett, of South Carolina, a 
scientific organization under the name of the National Institute with 
the avowed purpose of assembling scientific collections. Article 14 
of the bill of incorporation reads thus : 

The resident and corresponding members shall exert themselves to procure speci- 
mens of natural history, and so forth ; and the said specimens shall be placed in the 
cabinet, under the superintendence of a board of curators, to be appointed by 
the directors. All such specimens, and so forth, unless deposited specially, shall 
remain in the cabinet ; and, in case of the dissolution of the institution, shall become 
the property of the United States. - 

The Institute was dissolved in 1861 and its collections deposited in 
the Smithsonian Institution. " By this society," remarks Dr. Goode, 
"the nucleus for a national museum was gathered in the Patent Office 
Building in Washington, and public opinion was educated to consider 
the establishment of such an institution worthy of the attention of the 
Government of the United States."-^ 

The first collections of any magnitude which the National Institute

took under its care were those of the United States Exploring Expedi- 
tion which was sent out by the Navy Department, under Lieutenant 
Wilkes, in 1838. Earlier expeditions under the auspices of the Gov- 
ernment had been organized, but they either made no collections or 
deposited such as they did make in private museums outside of Wash- 
ington. 

The first collections of the exploring expedition were received in 
Philadelphia in 1840 and were temporarily stored in a room belonging 
to the Philadelphia Museum. Poinsett induced the Secretary of the 
Navy, James K. Paulding, to forward these collections to W^ashington, 
and interested himself to secure from Congress an appropriation of 
$5,000 to defray the cost of their transportation and subsequent 
arrangement. 

In April, 1841, the collections were deposited in a portion of a room 
in the new Patent OflBce, designated for the purpose by the Secretary 
of State. Dr. Henry King, a geologist and mining expert and curator 
of the National Institute, was in direct charge. The compensation of 
the curator was paid from the appropriation of Congress already 
referred to. 

With what rapidity collections accumulated under the charge of the 
National Institute may be learned from the report of the committee of 
the Institute dated January 1, 1842. This report recites that "the 
entire collection is deposited in the upper rooms of the Patent Ofdccj 
it consists of: ' 

Donations from foreign governments. 

Donations from other institutions, foreign and domestic. 

Donations from ministers and consuls abroad, and fr m ofidcere of our Army and 
Navy. 

Donations from individuals and from members of the Institution. The Iowa col- 
lection of mineralogical and geological specimens, made by R. D. Owen, esq., under 
the direction of the Treasury Department. 

The collection of mineralogical and geological specimens which had been on 
deposit in the bureau of the Corps of Topographical Engineers. 

The collection of portraits of distinguished Indians, and the collection of Indian 
cariosities which had been on deposit in the War Department. 

The minerals, books, papers, and personal effects of the Smithsonian bequest. 

The two shipments which have been received from the exploring squadron, con- 
sisting of minerals, specimens of natural history, works of art, implements of war, 
and curiosities. 

The books, minerals, and works of art belonging to the late Columbian Institute. 

The books, papers, and proceedings of the late American Historical Society. 

Cabinets and specimens, deposited by members in trust, for public use. 

These collections, according to the same report, comprised about

292 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

several hundred thousand shells, 500 corallines, more than 2,000 trus- 
taceaus, 300 starfishes, etc., 100 sponges, 7,000 separate specimens of 
minerals, and 50 boxes of the minerals and geological specimens. 
Those engaged in caring for the collections at this time were the cura- 
tor of the Institute, Dr. King, a taxidermist, a botanical assistant and 
two other assistants, a mechanic, and a laborer. 

Thus was established what in reality was a national museum, con- 
taining collections belonging to the Government, sustained by an 
appropriation from Congress, and employing a curator and assistants. 
For a time prosperity seemed assured, but complications soon arose 
which proved disastrous in the highest degree not only to the Museum 
but to the National Institute itself. 

The room in the Patent Office set apart for the collections by direc- 
tion of the Secretary of State was needed for the display of models of 
inventions, and the Commissioner of Patents made strong protests 
against its occupancy by the Institute. 

In August, 1842, Congress authorized the occupancy, "until other 
provisions be made by law," and also appropriated $20,000 for the care 
and arrangement of the collections, but in addition ordered that the 
persons having the work in charge should be appointed by the Joint 
Committee on the Library. 

Only a month earlier a charter had been granted to the Institute, in 
which all trusts previously held were confirmed. "The supporters of 
the Institute," writes Dr. Goode,' "were disposed to urge that this was 
applicable to the collections of the 'exploring squadron' at that time 
in the custody of the Institute. The question did not come up in a 
troublesome way at this time, for the Library Committee, at that time 
[not] unfriendly, simply confirmed the choice of curator made by the 
National Institute, and appointed Dr. Pickering to the x>osition, Dr. 
Pickering being thenceforth subject to the Congressional committee, 
and only by courtesy acting for the National Institute." 

A little later, in 1843, the Library Committee, having no longer any 
consideration for the Institute, without consulting its officers, appointed 
the Commissioner of Patents to have general charge of the Govern- 
ment collections, and Captain Wilkes, the head of the exploring expe- 
dition, to arrange and display them. Captain Wilkes i^roceeded with 
the work, pushing aside the collections of the Institute to make place 
for those of the Government, yet professing an interest in the welfare 
of the Institute and the security of its property. The drift of matters 
came to the attention of the officers of the Institute only by rnmor, 
but Col. J. J. Abert initiated a correspondence with Captain Wilkes, 
inquiring whether he or his assistants would devote any time to 
the care of the collections of the Institute, and stating that if such 
was not the case the attention of the Institute would be immediately 
called to the necessity of otherwise i)rotecting its property. The 
replies were not satisfactory. Captain Wilkes held that as he and his

AN ACCOUNT OF THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM. 293 

assistants were paid by the Government they could not spend any 
time in working upon collections belonging to a private organization. 
Nevertheless, he expressed an intention not to disturb the collections 
of the Institute more than should be really necessary in working out 
those of the Government, and to watch over them as far as possible. 

A few months later, in a correspondence relative to the " Ontona- 
gon" copper bowlder now in the National Museum, the Commissioner 
of Patents took the same ground, and held also that he had entire 
control over the room in which the property of the Institute was 
deposited. 

At the end of 1843, therefore, the National Institute found itself 
bereft of the control of the Government collections, without funds, 
except the membership dues, which were much in arrears, and without 
quarters for its large and rapidly accumulating collections. 

"The real cause of the decline of the National Institute," writes Dr. 
Goode,' "was simple enough. Failing to secure grants of money from 
Congress, the society was overwhelmed by the deluge of museum 
materials, which in response to its enthusiastic and widely circulated 
appeals came to it from all (quarters of the world. The annual receipts 
from the assessment of members were insuflBcient to pay for the care 
of the collections, and although by virtue of the long term of its char- 
ter the collections were kept together until 1861, there was little science 
and little energy manifested in this administration." 

While the events we have mentioned were taking place extended dis- 
cussions were going on in Congress, and in the country generally, 
regarding the proper disposition to be made of the bequest of James 
Smithson. It is unnecessary in the present connection to consider the 
various views put forth, further than to remark that several schemes 
included provisions for museums of natural history and the arts. 

The act of incorporation of the Smithsonian Institution, passed 
August 10, 184G, provided that the Eegents, having selected a proper 
site, "shall cause to be erected a suitable building, of plain and durable 
materials and structure, without unnecessary ornament, and of sufiti- 
cient size, and with suitable rooms or halls for the reception and 
arrangement, upon a liberal scale, of objects of natural history, includ- 
ing a geological and mineralogical cabinet; also, a chemical labora- 
tory, a library, a gallery of art, and the necessary lecture rooms." 

It is further provided that the Eegents "may so locate said building, 
if they shall deem it proper, as in appearance to form a wing to the 
Patent Office building, and may so connect the same with the present 
hall of said Patent OflBce building, containing the National Cabinet of 
Curiosities,^ as to constitute the said hall, in whole or in part, the 
deposit for the cabinet of the said Institution, if they deem it expedient 
to do so." This plan was not adopted. 

Section 6 of the same act provides that " in proportion as suitable 



' Goode. " Genesis of the United States National Museum/' page 328.

294 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

arrangements can be made for their reception, all objects of art and of 
foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural history, plants, 
and geologicvii and mineralogical specimens belonging, or hereafter to 
belong, to the United States, which may be in the city of Washington, 
in whosesoever custody the same may be, shall be delivered to such 
persons as may be authorized by the Board of Regents to receive them, 
and shall be arranged, in such order and so classed as best to facilitate 
the examination and study of them, in the building so as aforesaid to 
be erected for the Institution." 

Considering the section relating to buildings mandatory, and under 
the belief that the collections belonging to the Grovernment must be 
accepted and housed, the Board of Regents of the newly established 
Institution proceeded at once with the erection of a large brown stone 
structure. 

For various reasons the building was many years in construction, 
and during this period the first secretary, Joseph Henry, became more 
and more pronounced in his opinion that the Government collections 
should not be cared for at the expense of the Smithsonian fund. Indeed, 
he was in doubt whether the Institution ought to form extensive miscel- 
laneous collections to be maintained permanently at the expense of its 
funds, although he fully appreciated the value of collections, and, as 
will presently appear, labored to carry out the programme adopted 
for the Institution by ac<iuiring and caring for such special collections 
as could be made the dire(;t means of increasing and diffusing knowl- 
edge. In the report for 1850 he remarked : 

It would not be in accordance with the spirit of the organization to expend the 
income in the reproduction of collections of objects which are to be found in every 
museum of the country. Natural history can be much more effectively promoted 
by special collections of new objects, by appropriations for original explorations 
and researches, and, above all, by assistance in the preparation of the necessary 
drawings, and by presenting to the world, in a proper form, the labors of naturalists. 
In conformitj' with these views it has been resolved to confine the collections prin- 
cipally to objects of a special character, or to such as may lead to the discovery of 
new truths, or which may serve to verify or disprove existing or proposed scientific 
generalizations. ' 

Again, in the report for 1851, perhaps thinking that his position 
regarding museums might be misunderstood, he wrote: 

I would distinctly disavow the intention of underrating the importance of collec- 
tions in themselves. On the contrary, it ought to be the duty of the Smithsonian 
Institution to point out the means by which they may be made, and to aid in the 
work to the extent of its ability by embracing all opportunities which may offer for 
procuring specimens for distribution and by facilitating exchange and assisting 
explorations. - 

In the same connection he expressed his views regarding the impor- 
tance of a National Museum in the following words: 

Though the formation of a general collection is neither within the means nor the 
province of the Institution, it is an object which ought to engage the attention of

Coiio-ress. A general museum appears to be a uecessary establishment at the seat of 
Government of every civilized nation. * * * An establishment of this kind can 
only be supported by (Jovcrument; and the proi)Osition ought uever to be encouraged 
of putting this duty on the limited though liberal bequest of a foreigner. The 
Smithsonian Institution will readily take the supervision of an establishment of 
this kind, and give plans for its organization and arrangement, provided it be 
re(|nested to do so and the means for effecting the object be liberally supplied. • 

lu 1850 Prof. Spencer F. Baird was appoiuted assistant secretary of 
the Institution, in charge of publications and museum. He brought 
with him from Carlisle, Pa., not only a considerable zoological collection 
assembled by his own activity, but, what was vastly more important, 
a system of recording, assorting, and distributing collections which 
was sufficieutly comprehensive and elastic to meet the needs of a great 
museum. In December, 1850, he placed in the hands of Secretary 
Henry a full outline of operations, which he afterwards carried into 
practice with the most signal success. He perceived that the numerous 
surveying parties which the Government was sending out from year to 
year into the Western Territories would be powerful agencies in 
increasing the knowledge of the natural history of the country if they 
could be induced to make collections of natural objects along the 
various routes they traversed. To this end the influence of the Insti- 
tution was brought to bear on those officials of the Government who 
had the several surveys in charge. 

The extent and form of participation by the Institution in the cxxdIo- 
rations of the Government surveys varied in different cases. In some 
instances the Secretary of War was induced to grant an officer of the 
Army leave of absence for the purpose of making scientific explorations 
in some little-known part of the country. Again, the Institution fur- 
nished outfits and directions for collecting to such surgeons and other 
officers of the surveying and exploring parties as manifested an interest 
in natural-history explorations. In some cases the personnel of an 
exploring party included a naturalist of known abilities and experi- 
ence, and the Institution furnished every facility for collecting. 

On this point Professor F>aird, referring to the Mexican Boundary 
and Pacific Eailroad surveys, reported in 1853 as follows : 

Without a single exception, all these parties have been fitted out at the Smith- 
sonian Institution with all necessary instruments and apparatus for natural-history 
research, much of it contrived with special reference to the exigencies of the par- 
ticular service involved. Full instructions were also supplied, by which persons 
without previous practice were enaliled to master all the general principles required 
for making observations and collections of every kind.' 

The participation of the Institution also took the form of aid in the 
publication of results. Every year one or more publications based on 
the collections of the Government parties were published. 

Fostered by the Institution to whose interest Professor Baird lent 
enthusiasm and untiring energy, the work of collecting yielded abun-

296 REPORT OF NATIONAL MCSEUM, 1896. 

daiit fruits. In 1853, three years after his arrival at the Institution, 
Professor Baird, having worked along the lines laid down by Henry 
in procuring such series of specimens as were calculated to open up 
new fields of study and to increase knowledge, was able to report on 
the wonderful development of the natural-history collections in the 
following words : 

It may be well to call attention to the fact that it has been the work of but three 
years to raise this collection from nothing to the front rank among American cabi- 
nets, exceeding all, perhaps, in the number of new species first brought to light 
within its limits. Nor has eifort been confined merely to the acquisition of speci- 
mens, but to their concentration in mass, so as to supply all working naturalists 
with the materials of research. As already stated, applications for such assistance 
are constantly being received, and always met with all possible promptness; so that 
scarcely any natural history monograph or memoir of any extent has been published 
in this country within a year or two which has not been indebted in this way to the 
Institution. From the care, too, taken to keep separate all the localities, however 
near together, of any species, the collection affords information in reference to the 
geographical distribution of species of the very highest value.' 

At the end of a decade, in 1860, Professor Henry was able to say: 

The scientific material thus collected is very valuable, and, in number and variety 
of specimens and duplicates to illustrate the natural productions of the North 
American Continent, far excels any other collection ever made.- 

While the Institution was thus exerting itself to obtain special collec- 
tions to serve as the basis of research, the Commissioner of Patents 
was growing each year more desirous of having the use of the space 
occupied in the Patent Ofitice by the national collections, and appealed 
frequently to Congress and to the Eegents of the Institution to relieve 
him of their care. 

In 1857, when Professor Henry brought the matter before them anew, 
they finally agreed that the transfer of the collections to the Smith- 
sonian building should take place, but stipulated that an appropria- 
tion should be made to cover the expense of the transfer and the con- 
struction of cases in the Smithsonian building, and that the Secretary 
of the Interior should undertake to obtain from Congress, as before, an 
annual api^ropriation for the care of the collections. In his report for 
1856, Secretary Henry said : 

For the present, it may be well to adopt the plan suggested in a late report of the 
Commissioner of Patents, namely, to remove the museum of the Exploring Expedi- 
tion, which now fills a large and valuable room in the Patent Office, wanted for the 
exhibition of models, to the spacious hall of the Institution, at present unoccupied, 
and to continue, under the direction of the Regents, the appropriation now annually 
made for the preservation and display of the collections. 

Although the Regents, a few years ago, declined to accept this museum as a gift, 
yet, since experience has shown that the building will ultimately be filled with 
objects of natural history belonging to the General Government, which, for the good 
of science, it will be necessary to preserve, it may be a question whether, in consid- 
eration of this fact, it would not be well to offer the use of the large room immedi- 

1 Smithsonian Report, 1853, page 54. * Ibid., 1860, page 44. 



AN ACCOUNT OF THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM. 297 

ately for a natioual museum, of which the Smithsouian Institutiou would be the 
mere curator, and the expense of maintaining which should he paid by the General 
Government. 1 

"I can find no record in the minntes of the Regents," writes Dr. 
Goode, " but have been informed by Mr. W. J. Rhees, of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, that an urgent request for the use of the hall was 
made by t>he Commissioner of Patents and the Secretary of the Inte- 
rior, and that the board decided to grant this request on the condition 
that Congress should appropriate money for the construction of the 
cases and the transfer of the collections, and that the Secretary of the 
Interior should provide for the expenses of the care of the collections 
after their transfer in the same manner as before."^ 

The collections were transferred to the Institution in 1858. Pro- 
fessor Baird reported that year ^ that twelve separate collections were 
received from the Patent Office, of which the most considerable was 
the collection of the exploring expedition under Captain Wilkes. He 
estimated that the Patent Office collections together constituted about 
one-fifth of the objects in the Smithsonian museum. He i^ointed out 
also that there were then in the museum twenty-three other Govern- 
ment collections which had never been in the Patent Office. These 
were chiefly assembled by the different field parties of the Pacific Rail- 
road Survey, the Mexican Boundary Survey, and other Government 
expeditions engaged in exploring the national domain. 

The policy relating to the treatment of the collections adopted by 
the Institution was fully explained in the report of the Secretary for 
1861, though in most of its essential features it was in operation as 
early as 1857. Secretary Henry remarks : ^ 

The specimens may be divided into two classes — lirst, those which have been 
described in the reports of Government expeditions or the transactions of the Smith- 
sonian and other institutions; and, second, those which have not been described, 
and which consequently are considered of much value by the naturalists who are 
interested in extending the several branches of natural history. Of both classes 
the Institution possesses a large number of duplicates, in the disposition of which 
some general principles should be kept constantly in view. After due consultation 
with naturalists, the following rules, which were presented in the last report, have 
been adopted relative to the described specimens : 

First. To advance original science, the duplicate type specimens are to be dis- 
tributed as widely as possible to scientific institutions in this country and abroad, 
in order that tbey may be used in identifying the species and genera which have 
been described. 

Second. To promote education, as full sets as possible of general duplicates, prop- 
erly labeled, are to be presented to colleges and other institutions of learning that 
profess to teach the principal branches of natural history. 

Third. It must be distinctly understood that due credit is to be given to the Insti- 
tution in the labeling of the specimens, and in all accounts which may be published 

1 Smithsonian Report, 1856, page 22.

of them, since snch credit is not only due to the name of Smithson, but also to the 
directors of the establishment, as vouchers to the world that they are faithfully car- 
rying out the intention of the bequest. 

Fourth. It may be proper, in the distribution to institutions abroad, as a general 
rule, to require, in case tyi)e si)ecimens to illustrate species which have been described 
by foreign authors may be wanted for comparison or other uses in this country, that 
they be furnished at any time they may be required. 

Fifth. In return for specimens which may be presented to colleges and other edu- 
cational establishments, collections from localities in their vicinity, which may be 
desirable, shall be furnished when re(i[uired. 

In the disposition of the undescribed specimens of the collection, it is impossible 
to be governed by rules quite as definite as those which relate to the previous class, 
but the following considerations have been adopted as governing principles : 

1. The original specimens ought not to be intrusted to inexperienced persons, or 
to those who have not given evidence of their ability properly to accomplish the 
task they have undertaken. 

2. Preference should be given to those who are engaged in the laborious and diffi- 
cult task of preparing complete monographs. 

3. As it would be illiberal to restrict the use of the specimens and confine the 
study of them to persons who can visit Washington, the investigator should be 
allowed to take them to his place of residence and to retain them for a reason- 
able time. 

4. The investigator must give assurance that he will prepare a set of type speci- 
mens for the Smithsonian museum, and will return all the duplicates, if required. 

5. In any publication which may be made of the results of the investigation, 
full credit must be accorded to the Institution for the facilities which have been 
afforded. 

All these i)ro visions on the part of the Institution were carried out 
as far as the circumstances would permit. The money available was 
insufficient for employing paid assistants to any considerable extent, 
and the Institution had the benefit of the voluntary assistance both of 
many recognized authorities in the several branches of science and of 
young students. The extent and importance of this aid can not be 
overestimated. Collections which would have remained useless for 
years were rapidly classified by competent naturalists and separated 
into series, some to be reserved by the Institution and others to be 
distributed to kindred scientific establishments and to colleges and 
schools. 

The list of collaborators includes almost every name prominent in 
American natural history in the last half century. Nor is this a mat- 
ter for wonderment. The collections made by the exploring parties of 
the Government in the twenty-five or thirty years following the found- 
ing of the Institution contained a great number of highly interesting 
forms of animals and plants previously unknown to science, and the 
naturalists in whose hands the various series were placed constantly 
enjoyed the delight of discovering these and making them known to 
the world. The boundaries of American natural history were widened 
in every direction. As regards vertebrates, Professor Baird remarked 
as early as 1856 : 

Messrs. Audubon and Bachman describe about 1.50 North American species of 
mammals. This Institution i)ossesses about 130 of these; and about 50 additional 



AN ACCOUNT OF THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM. 299 

species have already Ijecn dc^tected, although the examination of the entire collec- 
tion has not yet been completed. 

( )f North American birds, the Institution possesses nearly all described by Audubon 
aufF at least 150 additional species. 

Of reptiles, the North American species in the museum of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution amount to between 350 and 400. Of the 150 species described in Holbrook's 
North American Herj)etology, the latest authority on the subject, it possesses every 
genuine species, with one or two exceptions, and at least 200 additional ones. It 
has about 130 species of North American serpents for the 49 described by Holbrook. 

Of the number of species of North American lishes it is impossible to form even 
an approximate estimate, the increase having been so great. It will not, however, 
be too much to say that the Institution has between 400 and 500 species either 
entirely new or else described tirst from its shelves.' 

The scieutitic elaboration of the collectious resulted in the publica- 
tion of a great number of monographs and preliminary papers in the 
Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge and Miscellaneous Collec- 
tions, in the reports of the Government surveys, and in the journals 
of learned societies at home and abroad. Many of the more compre- 
hensive of these works remained as standards for a quarter of a cen- 
tury, and some have not been supplanted at the ])resent day. 

In this work no one labored with more enthusiasm or more success 
than Professor Baird, who, while carrying the burden of caring for the 
collections and planning for the exploration of new fields, prepared 
and published a series of works on North American vertebrates which 
commanded the admiration of naturalists throughout the world. 

Side by side with the activities resulting in the increase of knowl- 
edge, the work of diffusing knowledge by the distribution of named 
natural history specimens was carried forward on an extensive scale. 
In the tirst twenty years of its history the Institution, according to 
the estimate of Professor Baird,^ distributed more than one hundred 
thousand specimens, of which the larger part were identified and 
labeled. 

In 1861 the charter of the National Institute expired and the various 
objects belonging to that organization became the property of the 
Government and were transferred to the care of the Smithsonian 
Institution. 

At this date, therefore, all the scientific and art collections belong- 
ing to the Government and the collections made by the Institution 
itself were assembled in the Smithsonian building. They comprised 
many thousands of objects, and were administered by Professor Baird 
as Assistant Secretary of the Institution. 

From the time the Government came into possession, in 1841, of the 
collection made by the Wilkes Exploring Expedition Congress appro- 
priated each year a small sum for the preservation of the objects 
accumulated in tlie Patent Office, which money was disbursed at first 
by the ISFational Institute, afterward by the Commissioner of Patents 
or the Joint Library Committee of Congress. 



'Smithsonian Report, 1856, page 60. Ubid., 1865, page 85. 



300 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

After these collections were transferred to the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion, in 1858, the appropriations for maintenance continued year by 
year, though small in amount. In 1858 the appropriation was $3,650; 
in 1859, and for eight years following, $4,000. The Institution never 
received any compensation for the occupancy of its building. As early 
as 1856 1 Professor Henry expressed the opinion at an early day that 
the Government might with propriety and advantage purchase the 
Smithsonian building from the Institution for housing the Govern- 
ment collections "of natural history and the fine arts," but no action 
in that direction was ever taken. 

When these collections were transferred from the Patent Office a 
series of new cases, designed by Thomas U. Walter, were erected in 
the main hall of the Smithsonian building for their display. Great 
progress has been made in museum methods in the last two decades, 
but the cases, arrangement, labeling, and taxidermy in the Smithsonian 
museum thirty-five years ago were probably as good as could be found 
in any scientific museum in the world at that time. The exhibition of 
many examples of a single species of animal or mineral, or of a single 
kind of ethnological or geological object, was not considered objection- 
able, and it was a common i^ractice to mount and exhibit type speci- 
mens of animals. To such matters as the size of glass in cases, the 
color of woodwork and labels, the effect of difterent groupings of 
specimens, little attention Avas devoted. Indeed, the amount of money 
spent ujion scientific museums was not sufficient for great refinement 
in display. Collections were exhibited for the satisfaction of the mature 
man of science, rather than the youthful student and the layman. 
Yet these latter classes were neither purposely neglected nor did they 
comi)lain of the methods in vogue. 

It is with interest that we read the following comment by Professor 
Henry on the Smithsonian museum in 1 861 : 

During the past year Washiugton has been visited by a greater number of strangers 
than ever before since the commencement of its history. The museum has conse- 
quently been continually thronged with visitors, and has been a never-failing source 
of pleasure and instruction to the soldiers of the Army of the United States quartered 
in this city or its vicinity. Encouragement has been given them to visit it as often 
as their duties would permit them to devote the time for the purpose."^ 

In 1865 an event of much importance occurred. A fire broke out in 
the second floor of the Smithsonian building and destroyed the upper 
portions of the edifice. Many collections were entirely destroyed or 
injured beyond repair, among which the most important were Smithson's 
personal effects and cabinet of minerals, a large series of portraits 
of Indians painted and owned by J. M. Stanley, and the collection of 
physical instruments, including Hare's experimental apparatus and 
"the lens used by Priestley for the evolution of oxygen from the oxide

AN ACCOUNT OF THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM. 301 

of mercury, and by means of whiclithe first distinct recognition of this 
elementary substance was effected." ^ 

This event produced results affecting the Museum in many ways. It 
called attention to the fact that the library of the Institution was kept 
in rooms not fireproof, and the transfer of the books to the Library of 
Congress was hastened, the space being subsequently occupied by the 
less valuable portions of the natural history collections. By the destruc- 
tion of the Stanley portraits of Indians, which, though really an ethno- 
logical collection and only on deposit in the Institution, formed an 
important part of what (with frequent apologies) was called "the 
gallery of art," the attempts to form an art collection of merit received 
discouragement. The reconstruction of the building, made necessary 
by the fire, led to a new assignment of rooms for the ethnological col- 
lections. Previous to the fire the upper story had been used principally 
as a lecture room, but the interest in lectures flagging for a time it was 
determined after the reconstruction to place the ethnological collections 
in that portion of the building, but the transfer was not effected until 
several years later. 

Though the formation of an arfgallery was provided for in the organi- 
zation of the Institution and a few art objects came into the possession 
of the Government from time to time, Professor Henry took the posi- 
tion at an early day that with the funds available the establishment 
of an art collection worthy of the name was impossible. When Mr. 
W. W. Corcoran first took active steps toward the formation of the Cor- 
coran Art Gallery, in 1869, Henry recommended that art objects 
belonging to the Institution should be deposited therein. In 1873 the 
Board of Eegents approved the plan, and in the following year a few 
paintings, sculptures, and engravings were transferred. 

In the early days of the Institution the valuable collection of engrav- 
ings made by Hon. George P. Marsh w^as purchased (the only large 
purchase by the Institution in the direction of art), and soon after the 
fire in the Smithsonian building it was transferred to the Library of 
Congress. 

By 1874, therefore, the Institution had definitely abandoned all 
efforts toward the establishment of an art gallery, and though some 
few objects connected with the fine arts have come under its care in 
later years, they have never been assembled so as to form a proper 
" gallery." 

In 1871 Congress established the United States Fish Commission and 
Professor Baird was placed at its head. The organization of the Com- 
mission on this basis had a most important effect upon the development 
of the National Museum in certain directions. The work of the Com- 
mission had to do largely with the natural history of fish and other 
aquatic animals, and in the course of a few years very large collections

302 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896, 

of marine life were deposited in the Museum. Later the work of the 
Commission turned toward the investigation of the phenomena of the 
deep sea, and in 1882 a seagoing steamer, the Albatross, was built, 
and extensive sounding and dredging operations in great depths were 
carried on. 

The collections made during the progress of this work, and deposited 
in the Museum, were of the highest scientific interest, and the results 
already published by Goode, Verrill, Bean, Rathbun, Smith, and other 
naturalists have attracted worldwide attention. In many other ways, 
which can not be detailed in the present connection, the work of the 
Commission was of direct and indirect benefit to the Museum, and 
the cooperation of these two governmental organizations has continued 
until the present. 

Not many years after the organization of the Commission the ques- 
tion of the desirability of holding a great world's fair to commemorate 
the hundredth anniversary of the Declaration of Independence began 
to be agitated in the country. The movement culminated in the organ- 
ization of the Centennial Exhibition of 1876, held in Philadelphia. 
This event was destined to have a more important effect upon the 
National Museum than any which had occurred since the founding of 
the Smithsonian Institution. 

The Government determined that the various departments and 
bureaus should make extensive exhibits indicating their several func- 
tions, and on January 23, 1874, the President appointed a Government 
board to have general charge. The Smithsonian Institution was repre- 
sented by Professor Baird. In the first j)lans of the board the National 
Museum exhibit was included under that of the Institution, and the 
Fish Commission apparently under the Interior Department. They 
included also an item of $200,000 for an exhibition building which 
should be "capable of removal to Washington after the close of the 
Exhibition, to be used as a National Museum at the capital of the 
nation."^ Congress, however, saw fit to modify these plans and pro- 
vided for the erection of a general Government building, to be paid for 
pro rata from the appropriations of the several departments and bureaus, 
and to be sold at the close of the Exhibition. An appropriation of 
$07,000 was made for the Smithsonian Institution, and of $5,000 for 
the Fish Commission, the provision for the National Museum being 
included in the former. When the several officers of the board began 
to examine the situation in detail it became apparent that different 
bureaus would duplicate one another's exhibits unless some compro- 
mise were made. Accordingly the exhibits of the Institution, the 
National Museum, and the Fish Commission were merged into one 
comiirehensive exhibit; while, on the other hand, the National Museum 
cooperated with the Indian Bureau of the Interior Department in an

AN ACCOUNT OF THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM. 303 

exhibit representing;- North American anthropology. The combined 
exhibit was divided into hve sections — Smithsonian Activities, Animal 
Eesources, Fisheries, Mineral Eesources, Anthropology. 

In the preparation of the exhibits of animal resources and fisheries, 
Professor Baird, then curator of the National Museum, had the assist- 
ance of G. Brown Goode, who held the position of assistant curator 
of the National Museum, Tarleton H. Bean, and H. C. Chester; in eth- 
nology, Charles Hau, Edward Foreman, and F. H. Gushing; in mineral 
resources, William V. Blake and Thomas Donaldson. 

When the idea of holding a great exhibition under the Government 
was first put forth, both Secretary Henry and Professor Baird foresaw 
that the effect on the National Museum must be of the greatest moment. 
The objects purchased and exhibited by the Government of the United 
States would find their final resting place In the Museum, and many 
foreign governments and private exhibitors would donbtless present 
their exhibits to the United States, with the result that they also would 
find their way into the Museum. 

The results of the operatious of the Institutiou in connection with the Centennial 
Exhibition [wrote Professor Henry in 1875] will probably have a much greater effect 
on the future of the establishment than is at first sight apparent. The large num- 
ber of specimens which have been collected by the several departments of Govern- 
ment and by the Institution itself in view of this exhibition will greatly increase 
the contents of the National Museum, and if we add to these the specimens which 
will be presented by foreign powers, of which we have already had intimations, the 
number will be swelled to an extent far beyond the capacity of the present building 
to contain them, and an additional edifice will be required for their accommodation. 

In the consideration of this matter the questions will arise whether the building 
required shall consist of an extension of the present Smithsonian edifice or an 
entirely separate building, and these questions will involve another, viz, whether 
it is advisable to continue, at least without some modification, the connection which 
now exists between the Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum. 

The Museum is destined to an extension far beyond its present magnitude. It is 
an object of much interest to all who visit the national capital, and is of great 
value as exhibiting the natural resources of the country, as well as a means of public 
education. 

Professor Baird, as exhibition representative of the Institution, 
wrote in the report of the same year as follows: 

It will, however, be readily understood that the Smithsonian l)uilding will be 
entirely inadequate to accommodate this collection on its return from Philadelphia, 
especially as even now it is overcrowded and packed from top to bottom with 
thousands of boxes, for the proper exhibition of the contents of which there is no 
space or opportunity at the present time. It is to be hoped that action at an early 
day will be taken by Congress looking toward a proper provision for this emergency, 
especially when it is realized that the materials are thus available for a national 
museum that shall be equal in its extent and completeness and in its educational 
advantages to that of anj' nation in the world. 

The collections made directly through the Government appropriations will also be 
very largely supplemented by the donation of series of American and foreign exhib- 
itors, a very large jnoportiom of which will be jjlaced at the disposal of the United 
States Government. 



304 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

The anticipations of Henry and Baiid were fully met. In the report 
for the centennial year Professor Baird wrote : 

At no period iu the history of the National Museum, from the time when it was 
organized to the present, has the increase been so great as during the year 1876. i 

After referring to the accessions from the Government exhibits, he 
remarks : 

In addition, however, to the sources of increase to the Museum during the years 
1875 and 1876, mentioned above, still another presented itself of perhaps even greater 
productiveness, viz, acquisitions from foreign exhibits. With scarcely an exception, 
the best and most important of these were presented to the United States at the 
close of the exhibition, embracing as they did many complete series of objects illus- 
trating the geology, metallurgy, the ethnology, and the general resources of all 
nations. Of about forty governments and colonies, the choicest of the exhibits of 
thirty-four were presented to the Smithsonian Institution for the National Museum, 
the remainder either having nothing to give or being restricted in the disposal of 
their articles. 

It was, however, not from foreign commissions alone that collections were received 
by the Institution. Several entire State exhibits and many belonging to private 
parties were also added to the general increase. Nevada, Montana, and Utah pre- 
sented the whole of their mineral exhibits, while partial collections were received 
from several other States and Territories. 

The Eegents of the Institution submitted a memorial to Congress the 
same year (1876) asking an appropriation of $250,000 for a building for 
the National Museum. A bill was introduced, but failed of passage 
that year, and it was not until 1879 that the amount asked for was 
provided. 

As soon as the law was enacted a building commission appointed by 
the Kegents of the Institution was organized, consisting of the resident 
members of the executive committee of the Institution (Hon. Peter 
Parker and Gen. W. T. Sherman) and Secretary Baird. General Sher- 
man was chosen as chairman and Gen. M. C. Meigs was invited to act 
as consulting engineer. 

The commission selected the firm of Cluss & Schulze, whose design 
for the building had been approved by Congress, as superintending 
architects, and received the benefit of the advice of Mr. Edward Clarke, 
Architect of the Capitol. 

The erection of the building was begun April 17, 1879, and completed 
iu 1881. In design the structure is of the type commonly employed for 
exhibition buildings, being entirely open above the ground floor. It 
covers a space of 2 J acres. On account of the relatively small amount 
appropriated for the building and the enormous gTowth of the national 
collections, it was necessary to use building materials of low cost and 
to cover in as much space as possible. The building is regarded as 
one of the cheapest of its size ever erected. While admirably adapted 
in most respects for the purpose for which it was built, it does not, of 
course, present, either externally or internally, an appearance as pleas- 



1 Smithsonian Report, 1876, page 38. 



AN ACCOUNT OF THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM. 305 

ing or cligDified as would have resulted from the use of a more expen- 
sive system of construction and more costly materials. 

While the building was under construction. Congress decided that 
the United States Government should be represented at the Berlin 
Fisheries Exhibition of 1880 by the Fish Commission. Professor Baird, 
then both Secretary of the Institution and Fish Commissioner, appointed 
G. Brown Goode. the curator of the Xatioual :\Iuseum, as his deputy at 
the exhibition. By this fortunate combination of circumstances, Dr. 
Goode. the working head of the ^rational Museum, was afforded an 
opportunity to study the museums of Germany and other parts of 
Europe, and brought home with him a knowledge of the most approved 
methods of installation of collections, labeling, and storage, which was 
invaluable. Far more fortunate was it that the Museum at this critical 
time in its history had as its curator a man of such surpassing merit as 
the lamented editor of this volume.^ Gifted with a philosophical mind, 
a profound love of nature, a marvelously retentive memory, and untiring 
energy, he acquired a range of knowledge and a grasp of affairs which 
astonished his associates, while his modesty, gentleness, and love of 
fair play attracted to him and bound to his service men of the most 
diverse capacities and opinions. His genius was known to Secretary 
Baird. but hitherto he had not found a sufficiently wide field for the 
exercise of his powers. The reorganization of the Museum afforded an 
opportunity, and Baird gave him free scope for the development of his 
I)lans. aiding him as no one else could have done, from the stores of a 
lifetime of exj)erience aloug the same lines. 

Out of the heterogeneous materials accumulated by the Government, 
especially as a result of the Centennial Exhibition, Dr. Goode organ- 
ized, under the approving guidance of Secretary Baird, a public museum 
of wide scope, attractive, instructive, orderly, and full of the elements 
of life. He elaborated with the greatest pains a philosophical and 
comprehensive classification for the collections of the Museum, and 
planned a complete reorganization of the staff' of curators and assist- 
ants. He devised an entirely new series of cases and other fixtures, 
for the installation of both the collections exhibited to the public and 
those reserved for the use of investigators, adopting the best features 
then developed in European museums, and adding many of his own 
invention. 

This regeneration of the National Museum soon made itself felt in 
similar organizations throughout the United States and in other parts 
of the world, and the methods of installation and labeling employed 
in Washington have been widely copied. 

The iutiueuce of the National Museum has not, however, stopped 
here. Already at the Berlin Fisheries Exhibition of 1880, with the 
exijerience gained during the Centennial Exhibition, Dr. Goode was

306 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

able to secure for the United States Fish Commission and tlie National 
Museum the Emperor's prize for the highest excellence of display. Not 
satisfied with this recognition, and always aiming to advance, he 
endeavored to install the exhibits of the Institution and Museum at 
later foreign and domestic exhibitions, in accordance with the best 
museum methods. As a result the exhibits of the Institution always 
won high praise, and it is not too much to say that the work of the 
National Museum in this direction has had a powerful influence in 
revolutionizing exhibition methods itt America. 

Since the Centennial Exhibition of 187G few years have passed in 
which the Museum has not been engaged in preparing for public expo- 
sition of greater or less magnitude. It made displays at London in 
1883, at Louisville in 1884, at Minneapolis in 1887, Cincinnati and 
Marietta in 1888, at Madrid in 1892, at Chicago in 1893, and at Atlanta 
in 1895. As might naturally be expected, the necessity of carrying 
on exhibition work outside of Washington has affected the National 
Museum in many ways. 

Probably no other great permanent museum in the world has had 
constantly before it the problem of guarding its treasures from deteri- 
oration and at the same time transporting no inconsiderable portion 
of them thousands of miles and displaying them under the ordinarily 
unfavorable surroundings of temporary exhibitions. The advantages 
lie in the direction of making the work of the Museum known to the 
people of the Eepublic and the world at large and securing new objects 
with which to fill out the deficiencies in its various collections. The 
disadvantages are found in damage done to objects in the collections, 
by breakage or otherwise, the interruption of the regular Museum 
work, and the dissipation of the energies of the scientific officers; for 
a museum, like any other permanent institution, requires abundant 
time and uninterrupted activity for its best development, and does not 
flourish in the midst of commotion and excitement. 

Thus far I have considered the National Museum in its historical 
aspects. It remains to explain briefly its function and aims and to 
mention the most notable objects in its collections. 

It will be perceived, from the statements already made, that the 
Museum is essentially a natural development springing from the activi- 
ties of the Government, growing with their growth and expanding with 
their expansion. It had its origin in the great naval exploring expedi- 
tion which the Government organized in the early part of the century, 
and found an important expansion in the long series of topographical 
surveys of the public domain and geological surveys of later years. 
The scientific investigation of the primary industries — agriculture, 
fisheries, and mining — by the Government have also resulted in large 
additions to the Museum. Finally, the desire on the part of the Govern- 
ment that the people should gain abetter understanding of its practical 
workings, through representative displays of processes and objects in 



AN ACCOUNT OF THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM. 307 

the great public exhibitious, have broadened the activities and increased 
the wealth of the Museum, both directly and indirectly; directly, 
because the Museum has need to bestir itself to bring together and 
arrange exhibits which will be acceptable to the public; indirectly, 
because the participation of the Government of the United States often 
leads other governments to participate, and the exhibits of these, in 
greater or less proportion, are ultimately presented to the United States 
for its National Museum. 

The held of activities of the Government has had a strong influence 
on the character of collections of its National Museum. While Euro- 
pean governments have been engaged in exploring new regions and 
founding colonies in distant sections of the globe, that of the United 
States has confined its attention almost exclusively to North America. 
The collections of the National Museum, therefore, are predominantly 
North American, Leaving out of consideration the important foreign 
collections of a few early expeditions, and those resulting from the deep- 
sea investigations of the United States Fish Commission, the additions 
in this direction have chiefly come from the activities of private explor- 
ers, by gift of foreign governments at expositions, by exchange of speci- 
mens, and only in a few instances by purchase. 

In the organic law of the Smithsonian Institution it is provided 
that — 

in proportion as suitable arrangements can be made for their reception, all objects 
of art and of foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural history, plants, 
and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging or hereafter to belong to 
the United States, which may be in the city of Washington, in whosesoever cus- 
tody the same may be, shall be delivered to su«h persons as may be authorized by 
the Board of Regents to receive them, and shall be arranged in such order and so 
classed as best to facilitate the examination and study of them. 

In the act of June 30, 1880, making appropriations for the sundry 
civil expenses of the Government, it is enacted that " all collections of 
rocks, minerals, soils, fossils, and objects of natural history, archaeology, 
and ethnology, made by the Coast and Interior Survey, the Geological 
Survey, or by any other parties for the Government of the United 
States, when no longer needed for investigations in progress, shall be 
deposited in the National Museum." ^ 

In the same year, as we have said. Congress appropriated money "for 
a fireijroof building for the use of the National Museum." 

As may be seen from the statutes cited, the National Museum is the 
recognized depository for all objects of scientific and artistic interest 
and value which come into the possession of the Government. Its 
function is to preserve these treasures perpetually, and to administer 
the collections in such a manner as to render them of the highest 
service to research and education. In pursuance of these ends it 
exhibits a portion of the collections for public inspection and instruc 
tion ; another portion it assembles in laboratories for the use of investi

308 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

gators. Out of the surplus accumulations it selects series of specimens 
for distribution to educational institutions, and it encourages publica- 
tions which will make its treasures known to the world. Of these 
latter activities it will be necessary to speak somewhat more in detail 
before closing, and 1 will return to them presently. It is desirable to 
point out here the fact, which will become evident to any one upon 
reflection, that an institution such as the National Museum, with its 
facilities for investigation and its corps of trained specialists, soon 
becomes a center of intellectual activity, attracting to itself students 
and savants, and being called ui)on to impart technical information 
and advice. In these lines lies no inconsiderable part of its labor and 
usefulness. 

It is to be said further that the Museum of to-day, owing in part to 
a natural development and in part to the labors of a few advanced 
leaders, among whom none have rendered more important service than 
the late Dr. Goode, is no longer content with a passive existence, but 
strives by the arrangement of its collections, by its labels, its hand- 
books and other j)ublications, and its lectures, to impart instruction of 
a definite character and in definite lines. It assembles great collec- 
tions of natural objects and treasures of art, not merely to satisfy idle 
curiosity but to difl'use knowledge among men. Thus it allies itself 
to the university and the library, and must be counted among the chief 
agencies for the spread of culture. 

To describe in detail all the more important objects in the National 
Museum would require more space than can be devoted to such an 
enumeration in this place, but it will be of interest to point out the 
chief excellencies of the collections and to mention some of the treasures. 

The collections are at present divided among the following depart- 
ments and sections : 

Zoological departihents : Mammals, Birds (with a section of Birds' 
Eggs), Reptiles and Batrachians, Fishes, Mollusks, Insects, Marine 
Invertebrates (with a section of Parasitic Worms), Comparative 
Anatomy. 

A Botanical Department. 

Geological departments: Geology, Mineralogy, and Paleontology. 

Anthropological departments: Prehistoric Anthropology, Ethnology 
(with a section of American Pueblo Collections), Oriental Antiquities. 

A Department of "Arts and Industries," with the following sections 
at present: Historical Relics, Transportation and Engineering, Naval 
Architecture, Physical Apparatus, Electrical Collections, Technolog- 
ical Collections, Materia Medica, Forestry, and Graphic Arts. 

The Department of Mammals comprises the collection of the Wilkes 
Exploring Expedition and of the numerous geographical and geolog- 
ical surveys of the public domain, including the type specimens of spe- 
cies described by Baird in his great work on North American Mammals, 
and numerous tyi)es of J. A. Allen, Elliott Cones, Harrison Allen, and 



AN ACCOUNT OF THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM. 309 

other American naturalists. The collections from the Mexican bound- 
ary recently made by Dr. E. A. Meariis, U. S. A., are large and of high 
scientific value.' 

A series of casts of porpoises and other cetaceans, including a young 
humpback whale, forms a unique feature of the department. 

The representation of foreign mammals, though deficient in many 
directions, includes a considerable number of type specimens and some 
important local collections, chief among which are those from German 
East Africa and from Kashmir and Eastern Turkestan, made and pre- 
sented by Dr. William L. Abbott. 

The collection of skulls of North American mammals is probably 
unrivaled elsewhere in extent, and the department also contains a 
large alcoholic series. 

Of the Department of Birds the curator, Mr. Kobert Eidgway, 
writes : 

Among the most important collections and single objects contained in the Depart- 
ment of Birds are the following: 

1. The collections made by the Wilkes Exploring Expedition, the various Pacific 
Railroad surveys, the Mexican Boundary Survey, the Geological Exploration of the 
Fortieth Parallel, the Geological Survey of the Territories, Geographical Surveys 
West of the One HundriHlth Meridian, the United States Astronomical Exjjedition 
(Gilliss), and various other Government expeditions. - 

2. The collection made by Col. A. J. Grayson in Western Mexico, including the 
Tres Marias and Revilla-Gigedo islands; collections made by Prof. F. Sumichrast 
on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and by Prof. V. Sartorius in the State of Vera Cruz^ 
Mexico; collections made by F. A. Ober in the various islands of the Lesser Antilles. 

3. The collections made by the United States Fish Commission during a cruise of 
the steamer Albatross around Cape Horn and in the Bahamas. 

4. Specimens from Audubon's collection, among them a considerable number of 
types of his new species — that is, specimens from which the descriptions and colored 
plates in his great work were taken. These formed part of Professor Baird's private 
collection, and were given by Mr. Audubon to Professor Baird. 

r). The private collection of Professor Baird, numbering nearly four thousand 
specimens, which formed the nucleus or beginning of the present national collection. 

6. Other private collections donated to the National Museum. 

7. The collections made by Dr. William L. Abbott in Eastern Africa, Madagas- 
car, etc., generously presented to the National Museum and embracing a very large 
number of species entirely new to the Museum collection, many of them being new 
to science. These collections of Dr. Abbott, moreover, represent practically all that 
the Museum possesses from the countries named. 

8. The collection of several thousand 8])ecimen8 from various parts of the world, 
presented by Mr. A. Boucard, of S])ring Vale, Isle of Wight, England. 

9. Extinct Birds: Great Auk (one specimen), Labrador Duck (several), Guade- 
1 111)0 Caracara (good series, old and young), and Philip Island Parrot, the latter 
purchased for the Museum by Dr. William L. Ralph, of Utica, N. Y. 

' The very extensive series of North American mammals made by the United States 
Department of Agriculture under Dr. C. Hart Merriam, the finest ever assembled, is 
deposited in the Museum building and catalogued in its registers. 

^The valuable collections of birds made by the United States Department of Agri- 
culture under direction of Dr. C. Hart Merriam in the United States and Mexico are 
deposited iu the Museum building, as in the case of the mammals. 



310 REPORT OP NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

10. Very rare species, or those nearly extinct, as the Carolina Paroquet, Ivory- 
billed Woodpecker, P>lack-capped and Jamaican Petrels, Hawaiian Coot, Cuban 
Macaw, Peale's Sandi)iper (several specimens, the only ones known to exist in col- 
lections), and numerous other species. 

11. Unique types, such as Fisher's Petrel, Townseud's Bunting, Cooper's Sand- 
piper, Cooper's Hen-Hawk, Riker's Woodhewer. 

The National ISIuseum collection of North American birds is by far the most com- 
plete in existence, and is the basis of every important work on North American birds 
since Audubon's time. That of the birds of the West Indies is also the most impor- 
tant, although exceeded greatly in number by that of Mr. C. B. Cory, now the 
property of the Field Columbian Museum in Chicago, 111. That of Central Ameri- 
can and South American birds is exceeded in extent and value only by the British 
Museum's series of birds from the same region, and has been freely used by Messrs. 
Sclater, Salvin, Godman, Count von Berlepsch, and others in their various publica- 
tions on neotropical birds, and is also largely the basis of Professor Baird's " Review 
of American Birds." 

Museums throughout the world have been supplied with American birds by the 
United States National Museum, and the existing specimens of several species, such 
as the Roseate Gull, Greenland Redpoll, and several Alaskan species, have mainly — in 
some cases exclusively — been distributed by the National Museum. 

It can safely be said that no collection of birds in the world compares with that 
of the United States National Museum in value or importance as a basis for scientific 
investigation already accomplished or yet to be done, since as many species as 
possible, with the facilities at command, are represented by large series of specimens 
from all parts of their geographical range and of all known variations dependent 
on climate, sex, age, or other circumstances. 

The unparalleled collection of North American birds' eggs in the United States 
National Museum is the result of many years' growth. In the early years of the 
Institution Professor Bird interested the naturalists of the various Government sur- 
veys and members of the Hudson Bay Fur Company in the subject, and from them 
(and especially the latter) thousands of eggs were received. Mr. R. McFarlane^ 
was particularly active, and with him were associated B. R. Ross, James Lockhart, 
John Reid, M. McLcod, A. McKenzie, and others, who sent not only eggs, but large 
collections of other kinds. The Institution sent Robert Kennicott to Arctic America 
in 1859, where he remained three years, collecting the natural productions of the 
region, and with them many eggs of Arctic birds. 

Naturalists visiting Alaska and Labrador also made large contributions to the 
oological collections. The eggs of the rare northern water birds and waders so 
difficult to obtain for i^rivate collections were thus sent (often in large series) to the 
Institution. 

In 1884 Major Bendire added to the already large collection his unrivaled series of 
eggs of western birds, obtained during twenty-five years of duty in the Territories. 
This collection numbered eight thousand or more beautifully prepared specimens. 
From that time till his death Major Bendire was untiring in his efiorts to obtain the 
desiderata of the collection. More recently Dr. William L. Ralph, of Utica, N. Y., 
has presented his magnificent collection of eggs to the Institution, and is now 
actively engaged in filling gaps in the series. 

To mention specifically all the rarities in the North American series of the oological 
department would be an almost endless task. A few of the more important ones are 
the following : Great Auk, one egg; Heermann's Gull, two eggs; Craveri's Murrelet, 
two eggs; Jabiru, one egg; Purple, Aleutian, Coues's, Baird's, Pectoral, White- 
rumped, and Curlew Sandpipers; Sanderling, two specimens (McFarlane); Heath 
Hen, one specimen; Passenger Pigeon, about thirty eggs; California Vulture, one

egg; Harlan's, Krider's, and Short-tailed Hawks; Peale's, Ricliardson's, and Aplo- 
mado; Elf, Flauimnlated, and Califoriiian Pigmy Owls; Carolina Paroquet; Ivory- 
billed Woodpecker ; ^Vhite-throated and Vaux's Swifts ; Clarke's Nut-cracker, several 
eggs ; Western Evening C4rosbeak ; American and Mexican Crossbills ; Pribilof Snow- 
flake, several. Among the rare warblers may be mentioned: Brewster's, Virginia's, 
Lucy's, Cape May, Olive, Sennett's, Grace's, Townsend's, Hermit, Golden-checked, 
Gray, and Connecticut Warblers; Eio Grande and Belding's Yellow-throats; Red- 
faced AVarblers. 

Of foreign eggs may be mentioned Kamtschatkan Sea Eagle, Quesal, etc. Also 
various series of eggs, like those collected by Dr. Jerome H. Kidder on Kerguelen 
Island, Dr. William L. Abbott in Africa, Seychelles Islands, Asia, etc. On some of 
these reports have been made.' 

Of the Department of Keptiles and Batracliians, the curator, Dr. 
Leouhard Stejneger, remarks: 

The distinctive characteristic of the reptile collection in the Museum is in the 
completeness with which it illustrates the geograjjhical distribution and morphology 
of the species inhabiting North America. In this respect it stands unrivaled. As 
the depository of the types of the species described hy Baird, Girard, Kennicott, 
Cope, and other distinguished American herpetologists it also takes first rank. 

The importance of the individual collections must therefore be judged with refer- 
ence to their richness in such types and the advance in our knowledge of the reptiles 
and batrachians of this continent that has ensued. The collections which have 
undoubtedly contributed most in these respects are those of the Pacific Railroad sur- 
veys, the first Mexican-United States Boundary Survey, and the Wilkes Exjiloring 
Expedition. 

The collection of fishes are almost exclusively North American, with 
one notable exception in the case of the deep-sea fishes dredged by 
the United States Fish Commission steamer Albatross in the North 
Atlantic and North Pacific. The latter collection is of equal importance 
with that of the Challenger expedition, if it does not surpass the same, 
and formed the basis of the recent work of Dr. Goodeand Dr. Bean on 
"Oceanic Ichthyology." 

The department contains the most extensive collections of fresh- 
water and littoral fishes of the United States anywhere assembled, con- 
sisting chiefly of the great series formed by the United States Fish 
Commission, supplemented by the collections of many American nat- 
uralists. The collection of Alaskan fishes is very large and is not 
extensively duplicated elsewhere. 

The series of fishes collected in connection with the Pacific Railroad 
surveys and the first Mexican Boundary Survey are of special impor- 
tance as containing the types of a large proportion of the species of 
the middle and western United States. They have been supplemented 
in recent years by important series collected under the auspices of the 
Fish Commission and by private collectors.

312 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

The departmeut coiitaiiis also many single si)ecimens of great value, 
which have been made the basis of new families and genera. 

Regarding the Department of Mollusks, Mr. William H. Dall, the 
honorary curator, writes as follows: 

The collection of mollusks was founded primarily upon the specimeus gathered by 
the United States Exploring Expedition under Wilkes during 1838-1842, which 
formed the types of the folio volume on the mollusks and shells by Dr. A. A. Gould, 
included in the series of United. States Exploring Expedition reports published by 
Congress. To these were added the types of the mollusks of the North Pacific Explor- 
ing Expedition under Ringgold and Rodgers, collected by Dr. William Stimpson, 
and described by Gould. The collections were very rich and valuable, for the time, 
but underwent serious vicissitudes before and after being received by the Smith- 
sonian Institution previoiis to the organization of the Museum, so that the series as 
it now exists is by no means complete. Nevertheless these shells form an interest- 
ing and important portion of the collection. 

Next in point of number and value comes the collection, especially of Unionidie, 
given by Dr. Isaac Lea, and subsequently enriched by his son-in-law and daughter, 
the Rev. and Mrs. L. T. Chamberlain. This collection is, in its specialties, the fresh- 
water mussels of the world, unrivaled for extent and value, comprising an enormous 
number of types and having full data in relation to tlie habitat, etc., in nearly every 
case. 

Almost as important for the mollusks of Great Britain, Northern Europe, the Med- 
iterranean, and especially for the various deep-sea dredging expeditions sent out 
under British auspices before the Challenger expedition, is the Jeffreys collection, 
purchased from Dr. J. Gwyn .Jeffreys, and comprising the results of nearly half a 
century of active collecting, exchanging, and purchase — in all some 25,000 lots of 
specimens, by far the most important and complete series of British shells in exist- 
ence, and forming the basis of some hundred publications. 

The fauna of West America, both littoral and deep-sea mollusks, is represented by 
the combined collections of Robert E. C. Stearns, William 11. Dall, the United States 
steamer Albatross of the Fish Commission, the Arctic cruisers of the United States 
revenue marine, and many private donations, in all comprising the most complete 
existing representation of the fauna, with full data in nearly every case. 

The fauna of the east coast of North America is represented by the unrivaled col- 
lections of the United States Fish Commission, augumeuted by a series of those of 
the Blake and many private collectors in the West Indies and on our Southern coast. 

The land and fresh-water shells oi' North America, apart from the fresh-water 
mussels, are represented by the best existing collection derived from many sources, 
including types of Binney and Bland, Lea, Lewis, Dall, Stimpson, and many others. 

To sum up, the collection of mollusks has the best series in the world, sui)plied 
with the fullest data, in the modern sense, of the land, fresh- water, shore, and deep- 
sea mollusks of North America, the Arctic regions, the North Atlantic and Pacific, 
and the British Islands. In the total number of specimens, the collection is the 
largest in the world, including over six hundred thousand specimens of dry shells 
and five thousand jars af alcoholic niolluscan material. The collection of Cenozoic 
fossil shells comprises the largest existing series of the Tertiary fauna of the United 
States, and probably the largest series of Antillean Tertiary shells in any museum, 
though much remains to be done in naming and classifying the fossil material. 

It may be said without fear of contradiction that for the regions mentioned the 
Department of Mollusks is unrivaled, not only in the amount and variety of material 
it contains, but especially in the full and correct data recorded in respect to the 
specimens, and which give to them a really s<ientific value, which is wanting in 
most of the great collections of the world, which were mostly made at a period when 
the importance of such data was not fully recognized. No other collection contains 



AN ACCOUNT OF THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM 313 

nearly as many American and British type specimens; and only the British Museum 
rivals ours in the number of species represented from the whole world. No other 
collection has so large a representation of deep-sea mollusks and brachiopods, for 
the study of which the national collection is indispensable. 

Of tlie Department of Insects, Dr. L. O. Howard, the honorary 
curator, writes: 

Taking the collection as a whole, and aside from the consideration of the individual 
collections of which it is composed, I should say that its most important features 
are, first, the rapidly accumulating number of types in all orders, amounting already 
to more than 3,500 species; and, second, the biologic features of the collection, due 
largely to the fact that the original deposit by Dr. Riley was mainly biologic in its 
character, and to the further fact that the biologic accumulations of the United 
States Department of Agriculture for seventeen years, which have been very great, 
are now in the possession of the Museum. 

The subjoined statement refers to the source of the different collections now 
brought together. Looking at the collection as a whole, however, the departments 
which stand out conspicuously are (a) the collection of North American Noctuida^ 
(l>robably the most complete in existence), (fc) the collection of jiarasitic Hymen- 
optera (undoubtedly the largest collection of bred specimens in the world), (c) the 
orthopterous family, Acridiida^ {d) the homopterous families ('occida;, Aphidiida-i, and 
PsyllidiB (without doubt the largest accumulation of North American species), (e) 
the dipterous families Syrphidte and Empida?, (/) the collection of Myriopoda. 

The department is at present in excellent working condition. It contains a very 
great amount of material in all orders, and in many unusual directions surpasses 
any collection in the country. Among others the following are of special interest: 

1. The large collection, in all orders, of Dr. C. V. Riley. 

2. All of the material gathered during the past eighteen years by correspondents, 
field agents, and the ofiSce staff of the Division of Entomology, United States Depart- 
ment of Agriculture. 

3. The greater part of the collection of Asa Fitch. 

4. The large collection, in all orders, of G. W. Belfrage. 

.5. The collections in Lepidoptera and Coleoptera made by Dr. John B. Smith down 
to 1889, together with the types of the Noctuida' since described by Dr. Smith. 

6. The collection of Lepidoptera of O. Meske. 

7. The collection of Lepidoptera of G. Beyer. 

8. The collection of Coleoptera of M. L. Linell. 

9. The bulk of the collection, in all orders, of H. K. Morrison. 

10. The collection of Diptera of Edward Burgess. 

11. The type collection of Syrphida^ made by Dr. S. W. Williston. 

12. The collection of Ixodida» of Dr. George Marx. 

13. The collection of Myriopoda of C. II. Bolhnan. 

14. Sects of the neo-tropical collections of Herbert H. Smith. 

15. The collection of Hymenoptera of William J. Fox. 

16. The collection of Tineina of William Beuteumiiller. 

17. The large Jai)anese collection, in all orders, of Dr. K. Mitsuknri. 

18. The African collections, in all orders, of Dr. W. L. Abbott, William Astor 
Chauler, J. F. Brady, the Eclipse expedition of 1889-90 to West Africa, and of 
several missionaries. 

19. The large collection from south California of D. W. Coquillett, in Coleoptara, 
Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Orthoptera. 

20. The Towneud Glover manuscripts and plates. 

In addition to this material, there are minor collections which have been the 
result of the work of Government expeditious, or are gifts from United States con- 
suls and many private individuals. 



314 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

The most beautiful, and in many respects tlie most important, of 
the numerous series in the Department of Marine Invertebrates is the 
collection of corals made by the United States Exploring Expedition, 
and described by Dana. It includes many types of new forms. The 
great deep-sea collections from the North Atlantic and North Pacific, 
made by the United States Fish Commission, deserve notice; as do 
also the exhaustive collections from the New England Coast and the 
Fishing Banks, and from the west coast of Alaska, received from the 
same source. All the collections are very rich in the types of new 
species and higher groups. 

Among the notable specimens in the Department of Comparative 
Anatomy should be mentioned the skulls and partial skeletons of the 
great extinct Arctic Seacow (Rytina); several skeletons of huge Gala- 
pagos Tortoises ; and an unrivaled series of bones of the Great Auk. 
The collection is rich in skulls and skeletons of the various species of 
porpoises. 

In the Department of Geology the following series and separate 
objects are pointed out by Dr. George P. Merrill as deserving special 
mention: 

1. The Leadville, Colo., collections of rocks and ores, comprising some 380 speci- 
mens, illustrating the work of S. F. Emmons and AVhitman Cross.' 

2. The Washoe collections, comprising 198 specimens, as selected and studied by- 
George F. Becker.' 

3. The collections of the Fortieth Parallel Survey. These comprise some 3,000 
specimens of eruptive and sedimentary rocks collected by members of the Fortieth 
Parallel Survey, under the direction of Clarence King, in 1867-1873. The eruptive 
rocks of the series vy^ere described by Prof. Ferdinand Zirkel.-' 

4. The Hawes collections. These comprise some 350 specimens of eruptive 
altered rocks, representing in part the work done by Dr. Hawes in connection 
with the New Hampshire surveys.^ It also includes the small fragments described 
in his paper'' on the Albany granites and their contact phenomena. 

5. The Pacific Slope quicksilver collections. These comprise several hundred 
small specimens (mostly 4 by 6 cm.) of rocks and ores from the quicksilver regions 
of the locality above noted, as collected and described by G. F. Becker" and col- 
leagues in "Geology of the Quicksilver Deposits of the Pacific Slope." 

6. Pigeon Point collections. These comprise 400 specimens illustrating various 
contact phenomena, as occurring at Pigeon Point, on the north shore of Lake Superior, 
and as described by Prof. W. S. Bailey in a bulletin' of the United States Geological 
Survey.

whole is doubtleBs the most complete and systematic of its kind in any museum in 
the world. 

In the economic section are very full and systematic collections illustrating the 
mineral resources of the United States, arranged geographically, and also a sys- 
tematic series in which minerals of the same nature and from world-wide sources 
are arranged by kinds. This collection comprises probably not fewer than 10,000 
specimens. 

Mr. F. V. Coville, lioiiorary curator of the Department of Botany, 
furnishes the following brief account of the collection of plants : 

With reference to the collections in the Department of Botany, it may be said that 
they constitute what is commonly known as t!:e National Herbarium. The nucleus 
of the herbarium consisted of the plants collected by the Wilkes exploring expedi- 
tion during the years 1838 to 1842. To these were added later the material from the 
North Pacific exploring expedition of Ringgold and Rodgers, followed by those of 
Fremont, the Mexican Boundary Commission, the Pacific Railroad surveys, and all 
the later explorations and expeditious of the Government. 

In recent years the largest amount of material received has come from the Divi- 
sion of Botany in the Dexiartment of Agriculture, material brought together in 
the pursuit of the investigations of that establishment. Especially noteworthy 
among these is the collection of grasses which Dr. George Vasey gathered during 
his studies of the forage plants of the United States during a period of about twenty 
years. 

To the collections of the exploring expeditions and those of the Department of 
Agriculture has been added a large amount of material donated by American botan- 
ists or purchased from collectors, besides large consignments of plants received from 
various foreign institutions or individuals principally as gifts or in exchange. 

The collections of the exploring expeditions and the collection of grasses are espe- 
cially rich in type specimens. 

Mention should be made of the collections of George Joad, comprising about 10,000 
species of representative plants of the globe, more especially those of Europe; and 
the collection of Prof. Lester F. Ward, comprising the specimens on which his " Flora 
of Washington and vicinity" is based, in addition to important collections made by 
Professor Ward and his correspondents in other parts of the United States. Both 
the Ward and the Joad collections were acquired by the Museum in 1885. 

The important collections of the Department of Minerals are sum- 
marized by Mr. Wirt Tassiu, assistant curator, as follows: 

At the request of Prof. F. W. Clarke, the honorary curator, I have prepared, and 
transmit herewith, a list of some of the most important collections and single objects 
in the Mineral Department. They are: 

The Isaac Lea collections, including a collection of minerals, a collection of micas 
and quartzes, and a collection of gems and ornamental stones, among which may be 
noted as of especial interest a fine green tourmaline of 57 carats, a red specimen of 18 
carats, and a hair-brown one of 16 carats, from Mount Mica, Paris, Me; a doubly 
terminated emerald crystal from Stony Point, Alexander County, N. C, one of the 
largest ever found, measuring 3.1 by 2 inches and weighing 8 ounces and 3 penny- 
weights; a crystal ball cut from North Carolina quartz; a silver nugget weighing 
448 ounces, from near Globe, Ariz; one of the largest known cut Ceylon essonites; 
four large Ceylon asteria; a fine suite of opals in argillaceous limonite, Baracoo 
River, Queensland. 

The Leidy collection of minerals, received from the United States Geological 
Survey. 

A series illustrating the occurrence and associations of the zinc and lead minerals 
of southwest Missouri, collected by W. P. Jenney. 



AN ACCOUNT OF THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM. 317 

A series illustrating the mineralogy of the Pikes Peak region, collected by Whit- 
man Cross, of the United States Geological Survey. 

A series of original and type zeolites from Table Mountain, Gunnison County, 
Colo., collected by Whitman Cross, of the United States Geological Survey. 

A series of uranium minerals used in the work leading to the discovery of nitro- 
gen in uraninite and later of argon, given by Dr. W. F. Hillebrand. 

A series of copper carbonates from Copper Queen mine, Arizona, a gift of the 
Copper Queen Consolidated Mining Company, through James Douglas, president. 

A series of azurite crystals and associated minerals from the copper regions of 
Arizona, together with a series of vanadium minerals from New Mexico, collected 
by Dr. W. F. Hillebrand. 

A series illustrating the occurrence and association of the zinc minerals of New 
Jersey, collected by Wirt Tassin. 

The type specimens of warrenite. 

A slab of sodalite, size 2 by 2 inches; a polished slab of labradorite, 2 by 2 inches; 
a slab of calcite crystals, 4 by 4 inches; two large sections of agatized wood from 
Arizona, deposited by the Drake Company; the Ontonagon copper bowlder; a series 
of Sicilian sulphur crystals; the Shepard collections of meteorites; the King or 
Irwin meteorite; a suite of meteoric irons from Canyon Diablo, Arizona, varying in 
weight from 964 pounds to a few ounces. 

To the list may be added the Stroud collection, the Hawes collection, the Abert 
collection, the various accessions received at different times from the United States 
Geological Survey, and other smaller collections containing valuable material of 
scientific and other importance. 

Of tlie Department of Paleontology, Mr. Charles Schiichert, assistant 
curator, writes : 

The feature of greatest importance is that much of our material has served in Gov- 
ernment reports and is the basis for the geological and paleontological work treating 
of the western part of our country. This fact is well exemplified in the great number 
of species which have served in description and illustration, many of which are the 
original type specimens. There are of such species 5,741. These are distributed in 
the sections of this department as follows: 

Paleozoic invertebrate species 1, 155 

Mesozoic invertebrate species 1, 024 

Cenozoic invertebrate species 1, 304 

Vertebrate species 161 

Paleozoic plant species (Lacoe collection; 504 

Mesozoic and Cenozoic plant species 1,531 

Insect species 62 

The most complete series is the Lacoe collection of American Paleozoic plants, the 
labeled specimens of wliich alone number upward of 18,000, and of these more than 
500 species have been described or illustrated by Lesqnereux and White. This mag- 
nificent collection is the result of many years' accumulation, and cost upward of 
$50,000. It was donated to this Museum in 1891 by Mr. R. D. Lacoe, of Pittston, Pa. 

The collection of Cambrian fossils is very large, and when Mr. Walcott shall have 
completed his studies upon this material it will be the most complete and valuable 
series of fossils of this system extant. 

The Cretaceous collection is also quite extensive and represents much work by 
F. B. Meek, C. A. White, and T. W. Stanton. 

The Tertiary collection of Mollusca is one of the conspicuous features of this 
department. This collection was accumulated chiefly by William H. Dall. 

Among single objects the following deserve mention: 

A composite slab of Lower Carboniierous fossils measuring 4 by 6 feet, and show- 
ing in high relief 106 crinoide (16 species) and other fossils. 



318 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

A Lepinodendron truuk 3 feet wide and 30 feet long (Lacoe collection). 
A series of 6 cycad trnnks from the Lower Cretaceous of South Dakota. 
Bones representing a nearly complete Zeuglodon cetoides from the Eocene of Ala- 
bama, and of which a life-sized restoration is exhibited. 

Skulls and limb bones of the huge Cretaceous dinosaur, Triceratops, from Wyoming. 
An excellent skeleton of the Irish elk, Megaceros Mhernicus Owen. 

The collections of the Department of Prehistoric Anthropology are 
thus described by the curator, Dr. Thomas Wilson : 

There are three great stages of culture, or civilization, represented in this depart- 
ment, which are separated and installed according to locality. 

The first, and probably the earliest, is that of western Europe, of which the 
Museum possesses an extensive collection, the largest in the United States, showing 
the culture of prehistoric man, from the earliest times down to the Bronze Age and 
the Etruscans, where it joins history. 

The second great division represents the territory of the United States and British 
Columbia. This constitutes the bulk of tlie collection, and comprises the hatchets, 
axes, implements, and other objects of stone. The mounds of the Ohio and Missis- 
sippi valleys have yielded large representations of pottery. 

The third stage of culture is that belonging to Mexico and Central America, 
variously called Aztec and similar local names. While it comprises many stone 
implements, it extends further and wider than either of the foregoing, having jade, 
obsidian, and gold objects and ornaments. Its pottery is fine and beautifully made 
and decorated, while some of the ruder pieces, representing gods, especially from 
Mexico, are made with a wealth of detail that has increased the difficulty of manu- 
facture almost beyond the belief of possibility in savage life. 

The display from South America is important, resembling the culture of Central 
America more than that of North America. 

The department has one of the richest displays of prehistoric objects in the United 
States. It contains more than 250,000 objects, which it is impossible to name. They, 
however, are divided both technologically and geographically, and by comparison 
in these two regards the endeavor is made to determine the stage of culture and 
obtain some insight into the history of prehistoric man. 

Regarding the Department of Ethnology, the curator, Prof. Otis T. 
Mason, writes: 

The ethnological collection of the Museum relates chiefly to the North American 
Indians, but it includes also valuable series of objects from Polynesia, obtained by 
the United States Exploring Expedition, such as the old Tapa cloths and weapons, 
which are no longer obtainable. 

The Eskimo collection is unrivaled. The collections of the Bureau of Ethnology 
and other Government surveys on the west coast of the Pacific Ocean in North 
America and in the Pueblo region of the southwestern United States are the most 
extensive and valuable ever assembled. Among single objects of high value and 
rarity may be mentioned a large jade knife from Alaska, obtained by E. W. Nelson; 
a fine series of boats and totem ijosts from the west Pacific Coast of America, by J. 
G. Swan. In the Powell collection there are rare old pieces of pottery from the 
ruined pueblos. A Hawaiian feather cloak, of large size and well preserved, also 
deserves mention. 

I present the following list of the most conspicuous and useful collections in 
alphabetical order, Ity collectors: 

A collection of great value from eastern Africa, Kashmir, and southeastern Asia, 
by Dr. William L. Abbott, of Philadelphia; a collection illustrative of the ethnog-

S. A., from southern Calitornia; collection of Capt. A. W. Whipple, U. S. A., from 
Southwest; collection of Rouncevelle Wililman, from eastern Cuina; collection of 
the Wilkes Exploring Expedition from Polynesia to the West Coast of America. 

In addition to those already named should be mentioned the A-arious branches of 
the United States executive service, the Department of State, the War Department, 
the Navy Department, and the Department of the Interior. 

Of the Section of Oriental Antiquities and Religious Ceremonials, 
Dr. Cyrus Adler writes : 

This section comprises a small collection, interesting not so much because of the 
intrinsic value of the objects as because of the relation in which they are shown. 
It may be divided, according to religions and nations, into nine sections: (1) Bib- 
lico-Judaic, (2) Christian, (3) Mohammedan, (4) Egyptian, (5) Assyro-Babylonian, 
(6) Hittite, (7) Gricco-Roraan, (8) Brahman, (9) Buddhist. 

Of the Biblico-Judaic section, the collection of manuscripts and editions of the 
Bible and its versions (forty-one in number) may be considered as the most impor- 
tant, having both a literary and paleographic interest. Next to this may be men- 
tioned the collection of objects of Jewish ceremonials, which, besides being a 
complete set of the objects used by the Jews in their religious observances, is of 
much artistic and historical value. 

In the Egyptian section the mummy with its cases and the facsimile of the " Book 
of the Dead" ranks foremost. In the Assyro-Babylonian section the most imposing 
objects are the two colossal composite figures and the model of a temple tower of 
Babel, the latter being unique. For purposes of the study of the mythology and 
culture of Mesopotamia, the collection of seals (upwards of 300 in number) is 
important. 

The whole collection of Hittite casts (thirty-eight) is unique in America, and affords 
a basis for the study of the history and civilization of this people, who played such 
an important part in the ancient history of the Orient. 

In the Grseco-Roman division rank foremost the Serpent Column of Delphi and the 
reliefs of the pedestal of the Obelisk, both from the Hippodrome in Constantinoi>le. 
These casts are unique. 

In the Buddhist section there are some fine images of Buddha of carved wood and 
bronze, models of pagodas from Japan, and a rare collection of musical instruments 
as well as other religious implements from China. 

A rare piece of mosaic, representing a lion attacking a horse, from an ancient 
temple in Carthage, also deserves especial mention. 

The varied collections grouped together in the Department of Arts 
and Industries are not readily summarized, but the following state- 
ments of those having the most important series in charge will be of 
interest : 

In the section of historical collections [writes Mr. A. Howard Clark, honorary 
curator] are exhibited personal relics of representative men and memorials of events 
and places of historic importance. The nucleus of the collection ^vas the Washing- 
ton relics transferred from the Patent Office in 1883, and these still comprise the 
choicest of the historical treasures, including, as they do, so many objects intimately 
associated with General Washington during his home life, as well as military 
campaigns. Furniture, porcelain, glassware, and ornamental articles from Mount 
Vernon, Royal Worcester vases presented to him by Samuel Vaughan, the Martha 
Washington china, presented by Van Braam, a beautiful Niederweiler bowl, per- 
sonally presented in 1792 by the Comte de Custine, and a nearly complete dinner 
service of Chinese ware decorated with the insignia ot the Society of the Cincinnati ; 
and besides these, the tents, camp chest, field glass, and writing case used by Wash- 



AN ACCOUNT OF THE U, S. NATIONAL MUSEUM. 321 

ington during the War of the Revolution, as also miniature portraits of the General 
and Martha Washington painted on wood by the artist Trumbull. 

Next in importance to the Washington relics are the almost priceless memorials of 
General Grant — the saddle, sword, held glasses, and other objects used bj^ him during 
his military career; all his commissions in the Army, from lieutenant by brevet 
during the Mexican war up through the several grades to general, and his certificate 
as I'resldent of the United States; handsomely mounted swords; and the great gold 
medal with which ho was honored by Congress for his militarj- services; many ele- 
gant gifts received during his tour of the world, including the beautiful jade vase 
and ornamented Ijell standard given him by Prince Kuug, of China. 

By the side of these treasures are valuable gifts to Presidents of the United States 
and to statesmen, soldiers, and other representative Americans ; some Moorish guns, 
highly decorated with gold and coral, and a gold-mounted sword, gifts to Thomas 
Jefferson from the Emperor of Morocco; jeweled and gold-scabbard swords pre- 
sented by citizens of States and cities for military bravery to General Eipley, Com- 
modores Elliott and Riddle, Admiral Trenchard, Generals Hancock, Paul, and others. 

Here, too, are exhibited the great gold medal presented by Congress to Joseph 
Francis for his service to the world as inventor of life-saving appliances; the beau- 
tiful vase presented to Professor Baird by the Emperor of (iermauy as the grand 
prize of the Berlin International Fishery Exhibition; the silver urn from the citi- 
zens of Baltimore to Commodore John Kodgers for his services in defense of that 
city during the war of 1812; the garrison Hag of Fort Motiltrie in December, i860, 
when that fort was evacuated by Anderson ; the war saddle of Baron De Kalb, who 
gave his life for American independence; the uniform worn by General Jackson at 
the battle of New Orleans, and many other individual objects of great historic 
value. 

A most instructive historic treasure is the Copp collection of household objects 
and wearing apparel, illustrating the home life of the New^ England colonists from 
1635 to the period of the war of the Revolution, the gift of Mr. John Brenton Copp. 

As a precious treasure in memory of the immortal Lincoln, there is the original 
plaster life-mask. Equally interesting are the molds of the hands made by the 
sculptor Volk, in 1860, just prior to the nomination of Lincoln for President of the 
United States. 

As a most conspicuous object, and a treasure as well, may be mentioned the 
original full-sized plaster model of Liberty by Crawford, from which was cast the 
bronze statue surmounting the United States Capitol. 

Of the sections of Transportation, Engineering, and Xaval Archi- 
tecture and Physical Apparatus, Mr. J. E. Watkins, curator, writes as 
follows : 

The collections in transportation, engineering, and naval architecture, although 
not great in extent, are particularly valuable on account of the historical interest 
of almost every object which has been collected and is now on exhibition. Notable 
among the objects is the cylinder of the first steam engine erected on the Western 
Continent, by .Tosiah Hornblower, in 1753, sixteen years before .James Watt began 
his investigations of the properties of steam. The Museum has also been fortunate 
in obtaining the original machinery of the Stevens twin-screw propeller steamboat, 
constructed and operated in the year 1804, three years before Robert Fulton operated 
the CJermont on the Hudson River. The original multitubular boiler of the Stevens 
locomotive of 1825, which ran in Hoboken, N. J., four years before Stephenson's 
lioclet, also forms a part of this collection. A cylinder and other portions of the 
locomotive "Stourbridge Lion," the first locomotive built for traffic on the Western 
Continent, was obtained several years ago through the cooperation of Horatio 
Allen, who, in August, 1829, first ran this locomotive near Honesdale, I'a. The 
series showing the development of permanent way in America is uni(iue, as is the 
NAT MUS l)G 21 



322 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

two collections of models showing the development of wheel Aehicles and machinery 
of the steiimboiits invented by Rnmsey, Fitch, Fulton, and Ericsson. 

The Ramsdeu dividing engine, used in the last century to divide equally the circles 
of quadrants and other mathematical instruments, which is the earliest machin(^ of 
this kind extant, also forms a part of the collection of apparatus. A very important 
and valuable recent addition to this section is the scismological apparatus, displayed 
at the World's Columbian Exi>ositiou in the Japanese exhibit, and since presented to 
the Museum by that Government. 

The electrical collections contain objects of extreme importance and value. 
Among these may be mentioned one of the first three large horseshoe electric mag- 
nets, wound and experimented with by Henry, together with the battery, first motor, 
and other similar appliances constructed by Henry AvhiJe in Princeton ; and the 
original telegraph apparatus invented by Professor Morse. The original telegraph 
instrument from which was received the historic message, " What hath God wrought," 
in Baltimore, 1844, also forms part of this collection, together with objects illustrating 
the beginnings and development of the storage battery and electric incandescent 
and arc lamps, and other electrical apparatus. 

The telephcme which Johanu Philip]> Reis, of Frankfort, indented in 1860 is another 
object of much interest and value. 

The collectiou of materia iiiedica is probably the most complete and 
most carefully labeled collection of its kind exhibited in any museum. 
It is very full in many directions, and is especially rich in specimens of 
cinchona. Of the latter series Dr. J. M. Flint, U. S. N., the honorary 
curator, writes : 

I regard the collection of cinchona products as the most important in the Materia 
Medica Section. This collection embraces specimens of nearly all the natural ciu- 
choua barks of South America, every variety of the cultivated product from the 
Government plantations in India, together with most of the cultivated sorts from 
Java, Ceylon, .Jamaica, and Mexico. The India and .Jamaica collections coinjirise 
also herbarium specimens of the leaf and flower, and in many cases the fruit of 
( ach variety of cinchona tree from which the bark is taken. 

Of the section of Graphic Arts, Mr. S, R. Koehler writes: 

This section was definitely organized in January, 1887, although its beginning 
goes back to at least the year 1884. From a very few si)ecimen8 then on hand the 
collections in this section have increased to the number of 5,620 specimens at the 
present writing, but as many of the entries on the catalogue cover more than one 
specimen, it will be safe to say that the total number is about 6,000. 

The aim of the section is to illustrate the various processes of making pictures by 
lines and masses, either l^lack or in colors, by hand, or with the aid of machinery, 
and the application of these processes in the industrial arts. To reach this aim, all 
the methods of making pictures that have ever been essayed are eventually to be 
illustrated — and many of them are already illustrated — by the tools and materials 
used, by the product in the various stages of progress, and by historical examples 
showing the development of each process, from the invention to the present time. 

In addition to the collections already noticed, the Museum possesses 
a good series of musical instruments, assembled under the immediate 
direction of Dr. Goode; a collection of porcelains, bronzes, and ivory 
carvings; a large and varied collection illustrating fisheries, which 
was brought together chiefly in connection with the Fisheries Exhibi- 
tion of Berlin and Loudon; a small forestry collection; a collection of 
foods; a collection representing the utilization of industrial products 



AN ACCOUNT OF THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM. 323 

derived from animals; a, collection of fibers and textiles; and a series 
of objects illustrating the chemical composition of tlie liuman body. 

I have already alluded to the work done by the Museum in the direc- 
tion of supplying' from its surjdus the needs of other scientific and edu- 
cational establishments. 

This undertaking was inaugurated at an early date, as I have stated 
on a preceding page (j). 297), and already in 1806, at the end of the 
second decade of the Institution, 110,000 specimens from the collections 
had been distributed. At the close of the fifth decade, in 1890, the 
number had risen to 521,000 specimens. These included animals of 
every class and many geological and mineralogical specimens and 
plants. 

P^very State and Territory in the Union has received a share of these 
collections, and numerous institutions outside the United States have 
also been beneficiaries in the distribution. 

The majority of these specdmens were distributed without demand 
for or expectation of a return ; but the National Museum has received 
from other institutions in exchange for the collections sent out a body 
of specimens amounting in all to perhaps one-third the number dis- 
tributed. Important additions have been made to the Museum in this 
way, and, indeed, its surplus collections, owing to the comparatively 
small amounts available for purchases, have constituted its chief capi- 
tal. The system of exchanges, however, has its limitations, which are 
soon felt. Few institutions carry large quantities of surplus mate- 
rial, and none, of course, dispose of their most precious posses- 
sions. Exchange, therefore, takes the place of purchase only to a 
limited extent. 

The Smithsonian Institution has carried on the distribution of sur- 
plus specimens from its own collections as apart of its regular activities 
having for their object the diffusion of knowledge. The Government 
has shown its acquiescence in this policy, so far as the national collec- 
tions are concerned, by several enactments making appropriations for 
the work and in other ways. 

In 1878 the Museum began the publication of a scientific journal, 
which has become well known to the world of science under the name 
of "Proceedings of the United States National Museum." The object 
of this journal, as indicated in the "advertisement" inserted in the vol- 
umes, is "the prompt publication of freshly acquired facts relating to 
biology, anthropology, and geology; descriptions of restricted groups of 
animals and plants; the settlement of particular questions relative to the 
synonymy of species, and the diaries of minor expeditions.'' Eighteen 
volumes had been published to the closeof 189."), containing in all no fewer 
than 1,100 papers, comprising 12,056 printed pages. All the papers 
relate directly or indirectly to the collections of the Museum and serve 
to make them known to specialists. The volumes include' a large 



' With the "Bulletins" to be mentioned presently. 



324 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

share of the scientific publications of the curators of the Museum, 
whose investigations have very naturally been based for the most part 
on the collections under their care. The " Proceedings " is a great store- 
house of facts relating to natural history, and especially in the field of 
systematic zoloogy, but the work of every department of the Museum 
is refiected in its pages. 

A few years before the establishment of the " Proceedings," in 1875, 
the Museum began the publication of a series of monographic works, 
under the general title of the "Bulletin of the United States National 
Museum," which in 1895 had reached 49 numbers. This series does not 
difi'er essentially in character from the " Proceedings," but comprises 
for the most part works too large to be conveniently included in the 
latter journal and generally of a more comprehensive scope. 

The regular series of both "Proceedings" and "Bulletin" are in 
octavo, but the Museum has also published three numbers of the latter 
series, as "Special Bulletins," in quarto. Two of these contain "Life 
Histories of North American Birds, with special reference to their 
breeding habits and eggs," by Major Beudire, and the third, a treatise 
on "Oceanic Ichthyology," by Dr. Goode and Dr. Tarleton II. Bean. 

The report of the Board of Eegents of the Smithsonian Institution 
until 1884 consisted each year of a single volume in which was included 
a statement of the operations of the National Museum. The report of 
1884, however, and those of subsequent years have been published in 
two volumes, of which one is devoted exclusively to a statement of the 
work of the Museum. In connection with the administrative reports 
contained in these volumes has been published a series of illustrated 
papers of a nontechnical character descriptive of various collections in 
the Museum. These papers have the same interest for nonprofessional 
readers that the technical papers in the "Proceedings" have for inves- 
tigators, and the demand for them reveals a widespread interest in 
zoology, botany, anthropology, and those other subjects with which 
the work of the Museum has been most closely connected.

RHHISTORIC ART; OR. THl^. ORIGIN OF ART AS MANIFI:STI:I) 
IN THE AVORKS OF PREHISTORIC MAN.

Curator, J>ivi8io>i of Prehistoric Archwoloc/i/, U. S. Xational Museum. 



INTRODUCTION. 

Art aud science have, in these hiter days, come to he closely connected. Artists 
of all countries aud periods are conditioned hy the circumstances in which their 
lives are passed, and by the ideas prevalent among their iieoples. Thus Art history 
becomes a function of social history, and can not wiselj' he disregarded by the 
student of the history of the human race. Ancient works of art bring us into con- 
tact with hygone peoples, and are often the only avenue wherebj^ we can approach 
far-distant civilizations lying silent on the verge of time. Thus the study of Art 
history becomes a branch of Scientitic inquiry. It has to be pursued by Scientific 
methods. Its results are of Scientific importance. It is a chapter, and perh;ips 
the most pregnant chapter, of the Science of (Prehistoric) Anthropology, which 
seems destined in the near future to no insigniticant growth. (Conway: "Art and 
Science.'") 

Art is the manifestation of liuraan emotion externally interpreted by 
expressive arrangements of line, form, or color, or by a series of gestures, 
sounds, or words, governed by particular rhythmical cadences.^ 

Art is the harmonious expression of human emotion.- 

These detinitions are general, and include all kinds of art. Emotions, 
whether grave or gay, are thus manifested or interpreted; when by 
color, the art is painting; when by line, drawing or engraving; when 
by form, sculpture; and a combination of these may produce architec- 
ture. When the emotion is manifested by gesture or rhythmic move- 
ment it produces the dance; when by rhythmic notes, music; when by 
rhythmic words, poetry. These are the exterior signs by which the 
liuman emotions are manifested. 

Each art is the peculiar language of a more or less extensive category 
of ideas and sentiments, to which it alone is able to give adequate 
expression. 

Certain of the arts appeal to the brain through the organ o si^ht — 
painting, sculpture, engraving, architecture, and the dance; while cer- 
tain others appeal through the organs of hearing — poetry, music, and

tLe drama. In tlie foriiiei- group, action is arrested aud the representa- 
tion is confined to a single moment of time; in the latter, the action is 
contiinious. 

But the laws governing botli groups are the same. Their success 
requires concord aud harmony between the external vibrations and the 
nerves which convey the impressions to the nerve centers. 

A work of art is a material expression of its maker's delight. It 
excites the nerve centers and produces the sensations of delight or 
pleasure. We see or hear the artist's ideal through his work, aud the 
success of his effort as a work of art depends, first, upon the brilliancy 
and clearness of his perception of his ideal, and, second, on his ability 
to translate and render this perception correctly. A copy, however 
accurate, even of the most beautiful scenes in nature, is not art. ISo 
artist can hope to equal the faithfulness of the photograph in repro- 
duction, yet this is only the art of photograpliy. A work of art is 
the ideal of the artist. It is his own thought; is a part of himself. 
Kot nature as it actually is, but as he sees it, as he idealizes and then 
depicts it. It is this presentation of the ideality of artistic genius, 
whether in picture, statue, poem, music, the dance, in architecture, or 
what not, that stamps the work as one of art, and herein it differs from 
a mere mechanical copy, however accurate. It is this ideality of artistic 
genius which produces the sensation of delight. 

Art is suscei)tible of several divisions. The commonest division is 
into fine, decorative, and industrial. It is not the intention of this 
paper to treat of industrial art j>er se. Fine art deals with painting, 
drawing, engraving, sculpture, architecture, music, i)oetry, aud the 
drama. A division into prehistoric fine art may be made according to 
the material employed. Prehistoric decorative art explains itself. 

The word "art" has difterent significations, according as it is used 
in the singular or plural form. When used in the singular form it 
relates to fine art; when in the plural, to industrial art. This linguis- 
tic distinction is continued in the designation of the workman; the 
one is an artist, the other an artisan. Sculpture in marble is undoubt- 
edly a fine art, and the sculptor is an artist. Suppose his marble 
sculpturing is used for a magnificent chimney front in one of the medi- 
ajval chateaux of Europe, or his sculpturing in wood is used for a piece 
of furniture. It may then be either fine or industrial art, the line 
between them being extremely difficult to trace. The test of utility 
does not satisfy the conditions. Eaphael's celebrated cartoons were 
designed for tapestries; Itubens made designs for similar purposes. 
Many recognized artists devote their best talents to making decorative 
designs for furniture, textiles, pottery, wall papers, book covers, and 
binding; while others equally well recognized find regular employment 
in illustrating our magazines and books; yet these are all industrial arts. 

No attempt will be made to maintain the distinction between fine 
arts and industrial arts, nor to determine where the work of the artist 



PREHISTORIC ART. 351 

leaves off or that of the artisan begins. The work of the artisan is 
often quite as difticult to perform as that of the artist. It affords 
him as much pleasure; he takes as much pride in it, and puts as much 
sentiment into it, as does the artist. Nor can the test of utility be 
better applied, for some of the line arts are highly utilitarian, while 
some of the industrial arts may be the reverse. If utility is to be the 
test, the lace maker, whether of point or bobbin laces, should be 
classed as an artist, for her work is always ornamental in contradis- 
tinction from utilitarian. It is only by this test that the sardine fish 
nets of western France are not to be classed as lace. 

The idea sought to be presented is the extreme difficulty in distin- 
guishing fine art from industrial art, the artist from the artisan ; and the 
reader of the following pages is asked not to be critical in the author's 
api)lication of the word "art." 

Not infrequently a piece of work begins in industrial art and ends in 
fine art. The decorations in the Congressional Library building in 
Washington are examples. Much of the work began with the stone- 
cutter and was finished bj'^ the sculptor; much of the wall decoration 
must have begun with the whitewasher and ended with an aggregation 
of the best artist painters in the country. The mosaic work also ran 
the entire gamut of art. So it may be in many of the arts mentioned 
in this book. The work may have begun with the rudest mechanism, 
as in flint cliii)piug, and ended in specimens of great beauty, requir- 
ing the highest skill, representing sentiment or imagination, being 
purely ornamental, without utility, and intended to satisfy an lesthetic 
demand. In these the dividing line between fine art and industrial art 
is ]iot attempted to be maintained, nor is this at all necessary. A 
manifestation of a high order of industrial art by prehistoric man 
comes equally within the scope of this paper as though it were recog- 
nized fine art. 

Sir John Collier, in his "Primer of Art," says that decorative art is 
the making of something to please the eye, but as to what is pleasing, 
that each person must decide for himself. With this definition for a 
basis, about all we can say is that the objects made by the prehistoric 
man pleased him and he desired them. All beyond is mere theory — at 
least is to be referred to psychology for an answer. To answer why he 
desired tliese objects to be beautiful in addition to their being ultilitarian 
would be only speculation on our part. 

Professor ITaddon, in his work on "Evolution in Art," says that the 
most satisfactory method of procedure when dealing with difficult 
problems is to reduce them to their simplest elements and then investi- 
gate these simple elements before studying their more complex aspect. 
The author has proceeded along the lines of this advice. He has thus 
far taken not only a single i)c(>ple, but has taken them in a single 
locality, and has given all i)rocurable evidence bearing on their art 
work, whether in its material or psychologic aspect. Through this we 



352 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

are now in possession of all the information at present obtainable. 
Much more might be said of the man of the Paleolithic period in rela- 
tion to his industry, his technology, i)0ssibly his sociology^ but on the 
subject of his art and art work it is believed that the present paper will 
be found exhaustive. It furnishes the foundation upon which theory 
and speculation may be built ad libitum, but it is believed that the 
foundation is laid as broadly and as deeply as it can be in the present 
condition of the world's knowledge. What future discoveries may 
bring forth no one may venture to prophesy. 

It is believed that these objects come within Sir John Collier's deti- 
nitiou. They were something to please the eye of the man who made 
them, and for this reason, and api)arently only this, he made most of 
them. What should have pleased him is (still quoting Sir John Collier) 
"what each person must decide for himself," and this man of the 
Paleolithic period appears to have decided that question in favor of 
these objects, and in accordance with that canon of liis art he made the 
objects herein to be set forth. 

Other aspects of art have been studied and written about by artists 
and historians from time immemorial. Their consideration opens a field 
for discussion into which we may not enter. We must content our- 
selves with this, which appears to be the very beginning of art. 

The craving for decorative art and the desire for things beautiful are 
the common heritage of mankind. Former writei s have speculated upon 
the origin of this craving and have believed it to be contemporaneous 
with the origin of art, and that they have declared to be as impossible 
of discovery as the origin of the attraction of gravitation. In this they 
have deceived themselves and have overstated the case, for it is respect- 
fully submitted that in the following chapters the author has shown the 
beginnings of art, its earliest specimens, and by related specimens 
from the earliest people and their descendants confined to a single 
locality, given a comprehensive exhibition of the objects made, and 
the styles employed for their decoration; and tliis carries us back 
practically to the origin of art. No art objects earlier than these 
described here are known to have existed in any part of the world. 

Professor Haddon ^ speaks of the needs of man which have con- 
strained him to an artistic etfort, and which he groups under the four 
terms ot art, information, wealth, and religion. yEsthetic art he 
defines to be the study or practice of art for art's sake, the pleasure 
of form, line, and color. Omitting color, it is believed that the illus- 
trations of prehistoric art shown in this paper come fairly within this 
definition. The objects figured and described show art work done for 
art's sake, to the end that the maker may obtain sensuous pleasure 
from form and line. Not only is it this, but it appears to be nothing 
else. All other terms of the group may bo omitted so far as concerns 
the art work of this epoch. Man did not do this work for the sake of

PREHISTORIC ART. 353 

religion for, so far as can be understood, lie had no religion, nor did 
he make these things for the sake of power or wealth. It does not 
appear that he considered himself in any way better off by having 
these objects decorated than he would if they had been plain. There 
are many hundreds of them which are entirely plain, of equal value 
for service, evidently utilitarian, without ornament or decoration, and 
apparently serving as weapons of the chase or war equally well with 
those highly decorated. Therefore these objects, beautifully designed 
as they may have been, were no addition to his wealth or his power, and 
as for information he was not busying himself about that. He gained 
information, it is Lrue, by experience and his own effort, as he and 
every other human being did and will, but this wrought his own edu- 
cation and was not for the purpose of educating those around him. So 
this branch of the story ends where it began; he made these things 
because they were pleasing to him, and he (each man) decided for him- 
self what was pleasing. These works of art were the material expres- 
sion of the delight of their maker. The man of the Paleolithic period, 
savage though he was, had his ideal. The existence of these art works, 
the representation of the animals which he saw, of the plants and 
flowers which he must have recognized as beautiful, the existence of 
these in the caverns which he inhabited, and part of the possessions 
fabricated by him; their mere existence proves the fact of his ideality, 
proves that he had a taste and a desire, and are evidence of his grati- 
fication tliereof. "What other ideals he may have had we do not know; 
he has left no manifestation thereof. So far as we know man his tastes 
are continually changing, but whether the man of the Paleolithic period 
changed his tastes or not is not now determinable except so far as 
shown by his works, first of flint and then of bone, and finally of 
engraving ?ind sculpture. It is only by these that we may know what 
were his tastes and what their changes. 

Man does whatever art work he desires. The outcome of his work 
is an expression of his ideal of beauty, of happiness, of goodness, of 
justice, and what not. When his taste or desire changes, his ideal 
changes, and with it his work. Everything that man does is done 
because he wants it to be done; it is his ideal. Human life is only a 
succession of ideals. The fashion in dress of the present day, why 
does it change? Why is the ideal of one season discarded the next! 
A change of taste is the only explanation. What produces this 
change? "Aye, there's the rub." Taste may be produced and maybe 
changed by study and contemplation. Man is an imitative creature; 
he is gregarious; he loves to herd with his kind, to follow a leader, to 
be relieved from the necessity of study or contem])lation of the needs 
of his life; he prefers to follow in the footsteps of his forefathers and 
the rut or route of civilization and culture which they have marked 
out for him. It is only occasionally, once in a generation, that some 
one being with a more energetic or ambitious desire or a greater

harmonizing i)ower, greater analysis, higher judgment, better intellect, 
becomes a leader of those about him and out of his judgment or through 
his study or experience he discovers or develops new ideals and so 
changes the standards of taste and beauty for his generation. But 
there seems to have been practically no change of the ideals of the 
Paleolithic man in the center of France. So the flint chipping and 
bone polishing, while they might have been steps of evolution in 
man's progress, at last ended in the art objects presented in the first 
chapters. 

The discussion of these abstruse, unknown, psychological questions 
is not here attempted, though the facts presented are pregnant with 
suggestions, which can not be here considered, as to the causes which 
impelled the wild hairy savage of Paleolithic times to produce these 
art works. We ask ourselves which of his tastes were gratified, which 
of his longings after, the beautiful were satisfied, what folds of the 
brain or what parts of his nervous system were set into harmonious 
action, and why and how did the making of these designs produce 
pleasure in him as he made them, or how did they gratify him when he 
possessed them? 

An examination of these questions would be aside from the author's 
intention and beyond his powers. He has no desire to enter into a 
X)hilosophic, nietaphysic, or psychologic discussion as to the origin of 
the art instinct in man or its evolution in his mind. This paper is a 
contribution to the history of art rather than to the science of art, and 
is intended as a record of the actual manifestations of art in the various 
epochs of human culture in prehistoric times, showing the earliest speci- 
mens, and thus presenting the idea indicated by the title "Prehistoric 
Art, or the Origin of Art as Manifested in the Works of Prehistoric 
Man." • 

The term "prehistoric" is used in this paper in the ordinary and usual 
sense, as being prior to history, before the beginning of history, mean- 
ing of course human history. As history can be only in writing, this 
means before written history. Prehistoric science does not depend on 
historical records made contemporaneous with the happening of the 
events recorded; it is based upon the evidence of the objects them- 
selves. The discovery of these objects and the birth of the science of 
prehistoric anthropology lie within the present century. Prehistoric 
anthropologists have investigated these objects and the various deposits 
containing them as to (1) their human origin, (2) the geologic age of 
the stratum in which they are found, (3) their original deposit in that 
stratum at the time it was formed (that is to say, an absence of intru- 
sion or disturbance), (4) the association and sui)erposition of tlie imple- 
ments and objects in the stratified deposits; and by the knowledge and 
experience thus obtained they have determined that man made these 
objects and, therefore, he existed in these localities in times of high 
anticpiity. 

This paper deals with the art of making and decorating these objects. 



PREHISTORIC ART. 355 

IS'ot infrequently theories are advanced as to certain natural artistic 
manifestations of the human mind. Objections are made to arguments 
of contact between peoples arising from similarities of objects of art, 
industry, or decoration. 

Mr. A. K. Wallace, speaking of the supposed migrations of the 
Swastika, says the cross made with two sticks, laid at right angles, 
would be the easiest, the most natural, and therefore the most likely 
sign to have been made first by primitive ujan. 

We hear of the cosmic circle, the solar circle, the magic square, etc., 
as the "foundations of our original concei)tion of the infinite." The 
sacred wheel of the law is spoken of as " common to all ancient cos- 
mogonies invented for the world and all time. * * * The ^Enead 
of spiritual principles, with their eternal relationships definitely deter- 
mined by the sacred wheel, have been the inspiration," etc. 

The attention of these and similar theorists is called to the fact that 
we have traced these art manifestations through three great epochs of 
prehistoric culture; that we have seen styles and designs of decora- 
tion without number, and we have to remark the absence of the cross, 
the circle, and the wheel. The Swastika made its appearance during 
the bronze age. It seems to have been the earliest known symbol' and 
was probably related to the cross, but except this, though the styles of 
decoration were principally geometric and made of dots and lines, the 
fundamental geometric forms of cross, circle, aud wheel are not found. 

I. PALEOLITHIC PERIOD. 

Flint Chipping.^ 

The eailiest manifestations of human art consisted of the chipping 
of implements of fiint, practically the first known to have been made or 
used by man. They belong to the Paleolithic period of the Stone Age.

2 This is sometimes called •' flaking," aud perhaps with equal right. My preference 
is for the term "chipping," if for no other reason than because it is in more common 
and greater use. A distinction can he made between the two terms, between the 
objects which are obtained and the processes by which it is accomplished, though 
usually no such distinction is made. Webster in his definition of— 

"Flake, n.," speaks of "(1) small collection of snow, (2) a platform of hurdhs, (3) a 
layer or stratum," but nothing relating to the present question. 

"Flake, v. t., to form into flakes. 

"Flake, v. L, to break or separate into layers, to ]>eel or scale oft"." We more 
usually say "to. ^afce oj." 

The Standard Dictionary gives — 

"Flake, n. 1. A small flat fragment or loosely cohering mass; a thin piece or 
(•hi]> of anything; scale; fleck," 

According to Webster, the words "flake" or "flaking" liav.' no rcfrrcucr citlicr to 
the thing or process involved in this discussion. He says : 

"Chip, n. (1) A piece of wood or other substance separated from a body by a cut- 
ting instrument, particularly by an axe. It is used also for a piece of stone sepa- 



356 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

This period has been divided according to progress in liuman culture, 
and divers names have been given thereto, following the taste of the 
writers or discoverers. M. Lartet named the epochs after the animals 
associated with the implements and called them, respectively, the 
epochs of the Cave Bear, the Mammoth, and the Reindeer. M. Dupont, 
of Belgium, divided it into only two, and named the epochs after the 
Mammoth and the Reindeer. M. de Mortillet has divided it into five 
epochs, and has named them, respectively, the Chelleeu, after the station 
of Chelles, a few miles east of Paris; the Acheuleen, after St. Acheul 
on the river Somme; the Mousterien, after the caverns of Moustier on 
the river Vezere, Dordogne; the Solutreen, after the rock shelter of 
Solutrc near Macon; and the Madelainien, after the rock shelter of La 
Madelaine, Dordogne. 

In later days the tendency seems to be to divide them otherwise. 
M. Cartailhac and M. Reinach, following Sir John Evans, are in favor 
of the first period being called the alluvium, and the second the cavern. 
All authorities are, however, unanimous in their agreement that this 
period and all these epochs, whatever they are to be called, belong 
to the Quaternary geologic iDcriod; that they were earlier than the 

rated by a chisel or other instrument in hewing. (2) A fragment or piece broken off; 
a small piece. 

"Chip, V. t. To cut into small pieces or chips, to diminish by cutting away a little 
at a time, or iu small pieces. 

"Chip, V. i. To break or fly off in small pieces." 

The Standard Dictionary says: 

"Chip, n. 1. A small piece cut or broken off. (1) A small thin or flattish piece of 
wood or stone cut or chopped out. (2) A small fragment with at least one feather- 
edge, broken off from any hard or brittle body; spall." 

According to the author's opinion, the definitions and differences are as follows: 

A flake is that object which, of flint, is struck always by a blow, from a core or 
nucleus in large and usually long and thin pieces. The process by which this is 
made may be called "flaking." It is, or ought to be, confined to the single blow by 
which the flake is stricken off. 

Chipping comprises all other methods of striking off pieces of flint. It may be 
used for preparing the nucleus, or for transforming the flake or other material or 
object into the implement desired. 

The fine handiwork done on many, and, indeed, most, of the flint imjilements 
described in this paper, has been done by cliipping and can not be regarded in any 
proper sense as that of flaking. The infinitesimal chilis by which the deep notches, 
the fine points, the serrated edges, of spear and arrow-heads, by which the herring- 
bone handles of Scandinavian daggers and the broad and thin leaf-shaped imple- 
ments are and have been made, and indeed by which all finely finished and delicately 
worked flint implements have been brought to their present condition, can not, with 
any degree of propriety, be called flaking, but should be called chipping. The 
pieces striken from these oljjects by the processes to which they have been submitted 
can not, without violence to the sense, be called flakes. It appears to the author 
much more proper to call them chips. 

He is well awiire that the implement of beaver's tooth used by the Eskimo has 
been called "the llaker," but this was only the determination or name given by its 
discoverer and has no other value than that of his ox>inion. The pieces pressed oft" 
with this implement are chips, and not flakes. 



PKEHIRTORIC ART. 357 

present geologic period, and that they came to an end before its 
beginning. The most certain, and tliercfore the most satisfactory^, 
division has been that of M. de Mortillet, named after the various 
localities where the respective implements have been found in their 
greatest purity. I give my preference to it, subject to tlie correction 
incident to further discovery, if for no other reason, because it is more 
convenient. The names given are for localities, and consequently are 
])nre]y arbitrary. They may not, perhaps, serve for general terms over 
the world, but within their own locality they have a definite and certain 
meaning; while to say the epoch of alluviiim, the epoch of caverns, the 
epoch of the drift, or of the mammoth, bear, reindeer, etc., might have 
an application in other countries which would deceive the reader. The 
names Chelleen, Mousterien, etc., have no such application, and can not 
be applied to other countries. They indicate and describe only one 
kind of implement and one stage of culture, and, as definitions, they 
are exact. If other countries have other things to be described, if 
different epochs are found, then other names may have to be given; but 
Avlieu we speak now of these epochs, the Chelleen, Mousterien, etc., and 
the implements that belong to them, the speaker and hearer are on a 
common ground, and both use the terms in the same sense. 

These epochs seem to have brought forth the earliest examples of 
aesthetic art. The man of this time has passed for a savage, and he 
doubtless was one. He had no tribal organizations, no sociology, no 
belief in a future state, no religion; he did not bury his dead, he 
erected no monuments, he built no houses; he was a hunter and fisher, 
he had no local habitation, dwelt in no villages except such as could 
be so called from a number of people living in a cavern for the purpose 
of shelter. Yet he occupied, in the Solutreen epoch, the highest rank 
as a flint chipper, and in the Madelainien epoch the highest place as an 
engraver on bone and ivory. His materials were the bones, horns, 
and tusks of the animals he killed. His tools or implements were 
sharply worked points or gravers of flint. Most of the specimens of 
art work are found in caves which had been his habitations. Xo one 
has sufficient knowledge to justify tlie declaration that all specimens 
of this art work belong to western Europe, but certain it is that most 
of the known specimens have been from that country. They are found 
chiefly in the caverns of central and southern France, and while about 
400 specimens have been found and preserved, no one knows how 
many have been missed or remain undiscovered. The specimens found 
in caverns were originally thrown aside and lost in the debris, and have 
been protected by stalagniitic or other i)rocesses of induration. In 
making these excavations there is nothing to guide the searcher to the 
places where these are likely to be found. He must depend on his 
experience or good fortune. The specimens are usually enveloped in 
blocks or slabs, wliich by infiltration and induration became hardened, 
and must be (juarried almost like stone. In bringing these blocks or 



358 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

slabs to the surface or light many specimens are necessarily broken 
and lost and many others in the interior of the block or slab are never 
discovered. It is, of course, not known what luimber are lost in this, 
or, indeed, in any way, but tlie specimens being scattered throughout 
the mass with nothing to indicate their whereabouts, it would be 
strange if such was not the case. Specimens of these slabs or layers 
can be shown which would not only exi^laiu but demonstrate the truth 
of these assertions. 

Plate 1 is a representation of a portion of the indurated floor of the 
cavern of Les Eyzies, and is taken from a specimen in the United States 
National Museum (Oat. No. OlOG). 

A few specimens of the art work of the Paleolithic period are purely 
decorative and without attempt to make representation of anything, 
but for the most part the objects were the animals of the i^eriod and 
locality. Many animals now extinct were represented, and in this way 
knowledge of their appearance has been preserved. The animals most 
frequently engraved were the mammoth, cave bear, Irish elk, musk ox, 
reindeer, chamois, mountain goat, urns or aurochs, horse, deer, and 
similar animals, and finally man. The marine animals were well 
represented — the seal,, sea lion, tortoise, turtle, fishes, and serpents. 
Some of the objects thus treated were iiurely ornamental, while others 
were utilitarian; batons de commandemeut, Domard. or dagger handles, 
and simjlar specimens were for utility, while other specimens were 
apparently intended as playthings. Many of them are so broken as to 
afford no clue to their purpose. This was the art of the Paleolithic 
period. That of the succeeding periods, the Neolithic and Bronze 
ages, was of a diftereut style. It was almost entirely decorative and 
was etched or cut on pottery and bronze objects of utility. During 
this period there was only the slightest attempt on the part of the art- 
ists to represent living or material objects. The decorative art of that 
period consisted mostly of designs in geometric forms, as squares, 
circles, lozenges, chevrons, herringbones, zigzags, and Crosshatch. Dr. 
Schliemann thought he found, upon some of the objects found in the 
Third City of Troy, representations of burning altars and occasional 
rude representations of animals like the hare. The Swastika seems to 
have been used throughout the latter period, and is believed to have 
been a symbol representing good luck, good fortune, long life, much 
happiness, etc., and to have been the first and earliest symbol in use 
among men. 

These periods (Neolithic and Bronze) brought an entire change in the 
culture of man as well as in his art. He became sedentary, having a 
local habitation and place of residence. He became an agriculturist 
as well as a hunter and fisher; had a religion — at least he buried his 
dead as though in recognition of a future state. He built houses, con- 
structed forts and fortresses; he built tunuili, mounds, and dolmens, 
and erected great stone obelisks, sometimes in groups and lines, which,

for want of a better name, are called alignments. He acquired the art 
of and became an adept in chipping, grinding, polishing, and drilling- 
stone, especially the hard flint and tough jade, of which he left some 
magnificently wrought specimens. A few whistles have been found 
belonging to the Paleolithic period, but the greater proportion of them 
belong to the Neolithic period and Bronze age. The American Indian 
and his congeners, those on the West Indian Islands or Antilles, were 
in the Neolithic stage of culture and their decorative art was practi- 
cally the same as of that age iu Europe. They excelled their European 
brethren, however, in making rude drawings and pictures, principally 
petroglyphs, many of them, doubtless, ideographs, telling a story by 
their description. They often reproduce the human figure, which the 
European rarely did. Tlie aborigines of Mexico, Central, and the north- 
western part of South America, although still in the Stone age, reached 
a higher civilization, mainly manifested by their fine sculpturing of 
stone, the erection of extensive and magnificent temples, and their 
ideographic language. 

No theory will be propounded in this paper, the only intention being 
to present facts on which arguments can be made and theories built. 
The sociology of the prehistoric man will not be essayed, and no Si> priori 
arguments will be introduced to explain the i)sychology of prehistoric 
man, nor will any philosophic treatise be attempted, giving pretended 
explanations of the causes which impelled aboriginal man to indulge iu 
essays at testhetic art other than the requirements of his condition or 
the suggestion of his fancy. To do this would be to substitute theory 
for fact. 

The present paper will be devoted to Prehistoric art, and will not 
deal with Prehistoric anthroi^ology. That subject is left to other works, 
a list of the principal of which is given iu the author's Handbook,^ 
imblished in the Eeport of the United States National Museum of 
1887-88, 

The Paleolithic jjeriod, the earliest epoch of the Stone age, obtained 
its highest known developnuMit in western Europe, possibly because it 
has been more profoundly studied there than elsewhere. By common 
consent it has there been subdivided into epochs according to the 
degrees of art manifested. Different names have been given to these 
epochs, and while there has been some dispute about details, the main 
proposition of a Paleolithic period earlier than the Neolithic has been 
accepted by all. 

The peculiar characteristic of the implements of the Paleolithic period 
is that man's cutting implements, usually of stone, ])referably flint, 
were always made by chipping. In the later epochs of the Paleolithic 
period certain implements were made of bone and horn, which were 
ground or smoothed, while those of stone were not. It is not, however, 
to be supposed that every chipped stone implement belonged to the

Paleolithic period, for the prehistoric man of the Neolithic period 
chipped many implements of stone. All implements of flint, whether 
Paleolithic or Neolithic, were made ijartly or wholly by chipping. 
Arrow and spear heads, knives, scrapers, drills, perforators, and such, 
of whatever age, period, or epoch, when of flint, were made wholly by 
chipping, while many implements of stone made by grinding or polish- 
ing were first prepared by chipping or hammering. It is, therefore, 
proper that a paper on Prehistoric art should begin with flint chipping. 

CHBLLEEN EPOCH (ALLUVIUM). 

The beginning of flint chipping is found in the flint implements of 
the Chelleen epoch, called by some persons in Europe the Alluvial, by 
others the Cave Bear period. 

M. de Mortillet, in his subdivision of the Paleolithic period, names 
this the Ghelleen epoch after the station of Chelles (Plate 2), in the val- 
ley of the Eiver Marne, a few miles east of Paris. This station was

chosen as representative because the implements were there found in 
their greatest purity, though not in their greatest number. These 
have in England been called drift implements because they have been 
found principally in the river drifts or deposits. Their original position 
indicates the same antiquity as the gravel deposits themselves. 

There was a time when the water of the rivers filled the valleys from 
hill to hill, pouring down with a rush its irresistible current, eroding 
the earth, and, if need be, the rock, to make for itself an outlet. As 
time in^ogressed the water subsided and the current became less pow- 
erful. The sand and gravel which had before been carried out to the 
sea began to be deposited in this bend and on that point, until at last 
the deposit came to the surface of the water, and formed what is now 
the highest terrace. This narrowed the river and the terrace became a 
new river bank. This process was repeated again and again, until the 
river finally retreated to its present bed and left its terraces, sometimes

three in number, tlie first being higher, deeper, and more distant from 
the river than tbe others. These are now marks of the successive 
stages in the formation of the river valleys. 

The gravelly deposit of the Eiver Marue at Ohelles forms the plain of 
the river valley. It is from 22 to 20 feet in thickness (Plate 2). The 
sand and gravel rests upon the original chalk and is about on a level 
with the' highest floods of the river in modern times. These deposits 
are of different degrees of fineness and are laid in strata or layers, 
showing that they were made by the action of the water (fig. 1). The 
strata are not always continuous, and they differ in thickness and posi- 
tion, showing the water to have had varying currents. Large, erratic 
bowlders are found occasionally. The sand and gravel are sometimes 
intercalated with other strata, which show a change in the surrounding 
conditions. The most frequent of these is an irregular stratum of calca- 
leous cement. In other places are pockets or strata containing various 
solutions of iron, the percolating water from which gives the color to the 
implements described, and sometimes forms the cement itself. 

There has been much discussion over the time and manner of the 
formation of these river valleys and the deposit of their sand and 
gravel as bearing on their antiquity. Such a discussion is unneces- 
sary here, but all disputants are agreed that implements of human 
industry are found in these river gravels in positions which indicate 
tlieir deposit at the time of the original formation and at a distance 
from the river and depth below the surface which indicate their 
antiquity to be equal with the earliest dei^osits. Whether they were 
swept down from the springs which formed the head waters of the 
river, were dropped on the borders of the stream in the near neighbor- 
hood, or precisely in what manner they became involved with the sand 
and gravel in which they are now found, is not only unknown but there 
has not yet been any entirely satisfactory theory developed. 

A series of these implements is presented, side and edge views, so 
that the student may understand the differences between these and 
the thinner leaf-shaped implements and spearheads of other periods 
and epochs, with which they are not to be confounded. These differ- 
ences are vital, and as they can not be brought out by a side view 
alone, an edge view is deemed sometimes indispensable. Some of the 
implements from Chelles are extremely crude and rough and belong to 
a very primitive industry, yet they may not be omitted from a work on 
Prehistoric art. 

The Chelh'en implements figured represent the standards for this 
epoch. They are mostly oval, with a cutting edge at the point, con- 
trary to those of the Neolithic period. The body of the implement is 
thick, after the shape of an almond or peach stone, and not thin aud 
flat, as a laurel leaf, like those of a later epoch. They were of flint 
where that stone was obtainable; where it was not, quartz and quartz- 
ite seem to have been emj)loyed. The flint always broke under a blow

with a conchoidal fracture, and this may frequently be seen. Some 

specimens were made from bowlders, and in cbipi)ing to a cutting edge 

or point the crust of the peb- 
ble was often left as a grip.

a grip, while the other end is 
chipxied to a point, as though 
for digging rather than cut- 
ting. These pebbles both be- 
long to the chalk formation, 
as do most of the flints from 
these countries. Fig. 4 (Cat. 
No. 35121, U.S.N.M.) repre- 
sents a standard type of these 

implements from the valley of the Loire, central France. It is oval 

or almond-shaped, with the cutting edge at the j)oint, but has been 

made of flint from a ledge, and 

not from a nodule or j)ebble. 

The entire surface, both sides 

and edges, has been worked by 

chipping, though the butt or 

grip is thicker and has its edges 

battered so that it can be better 

held in the hand. The hand 

may also have been protected 

against the sharp edges or cor- 
ners by a bit of skin, fur, grass, 

or similar substance. It is 

doubted whether any of these 

implements were attached to a 

handle. It required great care 

and labor for the Paleolithic 

workmen to chip them to this 

sharp edge all around, and when 

sodoneitproduced an implement 

the form of which was the most difficult to successfully insert in a handle. 

To make a firm attaclimentof an implement of this form, the handle must

envelop it at its j?reatest diameter, and herein lies tlie first difficnlty. 
If the sharpened implement be insufficiently inserted it will drop out; 
if only partially inserted a few hard blows would s[)lit the handle; if 
it be inserted too far the same blow will drive it through. 

The particular or special use of the Chelleen implement is unknown, 
though it may easily be surmised. The wise men of Europe have made 
many guesses and suppositions, but beyond the suggestion of a cutting 
or digging implement 
adapting itself to varying 
daily needs of the abo- 
riginal man, all these are 
naught but speculation. 
Many of the implements 
bear undoubted traces of 
use on their cutting edges. 
Sir John Evans, in his 
latest work, reverts to his 
first and original opinion, 
that " it is nearly useless 
to speculate as to the pur- 
jioses to which they were 
applied." Sir John Lub- 
bock says: 

Ahnost as well miglit we ask 
to what would they not be 
api)lied. Infinite as are our 
instruments, who would at- 
tempt, even at present, to say 
what was the use of a knife? 
But the primitive savage had 
no such choice of tools. We 
see l)efore us, perhaps, the whole coutents of his workshop, and with these weapons, 
rude as they seem to us, he may have cut down trees, scooped them out into canoes, 
grubbed up roots, killed animals and enemies, cut up his food, made holes in winter 
through the ice, prepared firewood, etc. 

Attention is called to the relation of width to thickness of the speci- 
mens shown, especially in fig. 4, because this is a characteristic of 
Paleolithic types, and one of the recognizable differences between 
Chelleen and all other implements. This specimen is 3/,, inches in 
width and If inches in thickness — or the thickness is 53 per cent of the 
width. The average Solutreen and ISTeolithic leaf-shaped implements 
of this width are about three-fourths of an inch, or 22 per cent of the 
width. 

The flint of which these implements are made has, in many specimens, 
passed, since their manufacture, through certain chemical and phj'sical 
changes on the surface. Some show a certain brilliancy, in some the 
color has changed to red or yellow, and so on through the scale to 
chalky white. This change, called patina, is produced by contact with

tlie atmosphere or tbo eartli, or with the water which has percolated 
tlirougli the earths iu the neigliborhood, generally those containing- 
iron, and these have changed the chemical combination of the flint on 
its surface. This change sometimes extends deep into the stone, and 
in small specimens under favorable conditions may pass entirely 
through it.^ In the United States all this might be called weathering; 
in France it is called patine. The objection to the former word is that 
it conveys, possibly involuntarily, some relation to the weather, while 
the patine may be formed on specimens deep in the earth. Dendrites 

are also formed on the speci- 
mens. These changes are evi- 
dences of antiquity of the 
specimens, and to the experi- 
enced eye become testi- 
monials of its genuineness. 
Fig. 5 (Cat. No. 99457, U.S. 
N.M.) represents a slightly 
different form. It is longer, 
narrower, thicker, and is more 
pointed. Its length is 6i 
inches, width 2| inches, and 
thickness 1^ inches, or 71 i)er 
cent. It comes from the forest 
of Othe, department of Aube 
or Yonne, eastern central 
France, and is one of the 
many surface finds of France. 
It has been strongly objected 
to similar specimens found in 
the United States that, being 
found practically on the sur- 
face, they are not evidence of 
a Paleolithic period; and the 
force of this objection is ad- 
mitted. However, many such 
implements have been found 
on the surface of the high plateaus of western Europe, and they have 
always been considered as true paleoliths. This question is not to be 
argued here; those interested in it are referred to the handbook^ pre- 
viously cited, where some of the instances are stated and authorities 
quoted. 

It has already been remarked that most of the Paleolithic imple- 
ments from western Europe are of flint, but all are not so. An exten-

sive workshop for the manufacture of Paleolithic implement.s was 
fouud on or near the surface at Bois du Ivocher not far from Dinan, 
France, by MM. .Micault and 
Fornier, of Eennes. The ma- 
terial was quartzite,and chips, 
Hakes, hammer stones, and un- 
finished implements, with the 
usual d('bris, were found, and 
along with them a number of 
finished implements, of which 
fig. C (Oat. ^o. 99541, U.S.N. 
M.) represents one. It has the 
same peculiarity of relativ^e 
thickness as other Paleolithic 
implements, but is more disk- 
shaped than any heretofore 
shown. 

Implements corresponding 
to those of the Chelleen epoch 
are found practically over the world. This would indicate the expan- 
sion of that civilization and the duration of the epoch to have been 
much greater than has been su^jposed. Those from Great Britain are 

found only in the eastern 
and southern portion from 
Norfolk around to Devon- 
shire and Lands End. 
They have been found in 
every quarter of France 
and southern Belgium, in 
all parts of Italy, and in 
Spain and Portugal (fig. 7). 
They have not been found 
in northern England, Scot- 
land, Wales, nor northern 
Ireland; neither in north- 
ern Belgium, nor Holland, 
nor in the Scandinavian 
countries, nor that portion 
of Germany bordering on 
the Baltic, nor in northern 
Russia. These countries 
may have been covered 
with glaciers at that epoch, 
or possibly by the great 
North Sea. Paleolithic implements have been fouud in Asia, in Pales- 
tine, in India from Bombay to Calcutta (fig. 8, Cat. No. 8S190, U.S.N.M.),

Some of the prehistoric archaeologists of France have sought to make 
a subdivision of the culture of the Chelleen epoch and to dei)omiuate 
the specimens from St. Achenl near Amiens on the Somme Eiver, 
France, by the name of that station. These specimens are thinner, 
with smaller flakes; are liner in their manufacture, and show an 
improved art of flint chipping. Fig. 10 represents one of these speci- 
mens. It is of flint, pointed, almond-shaped, showing part of crust of 
pebble left for grip, and with cutting edge at the small end.

FLINT IMPLEMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES. 

Implements in large numbers have been discovered in nearly every 
State of the United States, bearing great resemblance in form, appear- 
ance, and mode of manufacture to the Paleolithic (Clielleen and St. 
Acheuleen) implements from western Europe and the localities just 
mentioned. If accepted as such, their jiresence would prove the occu- 
pation of America by a prehistoric race of the same culture status. 

The investigation concerning these implements has not been very pro- 
found, nor has it been settled to the satisfaction of all prehistoric archae- 
ologists, perhaps not even to a majority, that they are truly Paleolithic 
implements. There have been various contentions concerning this. On 
this subject the author has formulated his conclusions as follows: 

It is apparent on slight inspection that these implements found 
in the United States, althougli mostly on the surface, are of the same 
Paleolithic type as those found in the gravels of Europe and elsewhere. 



PREHISTORIC ART. 



367 



No attempt is irifide to define Paleolitliic civilization or culture, nor 
to describe the man who made or employed these implements. These 
implements are not declared to be either glacial or preglacial, yet they 
have been found in glacial gravels, and they are decided to be different 
from the impleinent common to the Neolithic civilization of America. 
Thus they furnish a working hypothesis indicating a stage of Paleo- 
lithic culture in America. This conclusion is expressed under all 
reserve, and subject to future discoveries. As a working hypothesis, 
it may stimulate investigators to search in such gravels, fluvial or 
glacial, as may be sus- 
pected of containing them. 
This might induce inves- 
tigators and collectors to 
gather and save them as 
valuable to science, to 
note all objects, and to 
correctly report all possi 
ble information concern- 
ing them. In Europe, Pa- 
leolithic man belonged to 
a past geologic age called 
there the Quaternary ; the 
objects of his industry 
were found associated 
with the remains of ex- 
tinct animals usually fos- 
silized, belonging to the 
aforesaid geologic epoch, 
and, therefore, if we are to 
find Paleolithic man in 
America in times of simi- 
lar antiquity, we must call 
to our aid the science of 
geology. If Paleolithic 
man occupied America, 
whether lie be the Indian 
or his ancestor, the implements will surely be found sometime and 
somewhere; and then those who are now opposed will agree. If the 
implements are not found, then those now favoring will be compelled to 
give it up. In any event, the investigation should be made, and no 
adverse decision is justifiable while the question is pending. 

It is not intended to make here any argument favoring a Paleolithic 
epoch in America, but only to note the similarity in the early prehis- 
toric times in the art of flint chipping in Europe and other localities 
with the same art in America. A series of implements from our coun- 
try is here presented. Figs. 11 and 12 represent specimens from Texas;

As examples of the ear-

It has been contended 
that human occupation 
during the Cavern peri- 
od in Europe was con- 
temporaneous with the 
Glacial period, that the 
inhabitants had thereto- 
fore lived without parti- 
cular habitations, and 
the climate being warm 
and moist, they were 
without particular need 
of any; but on the ap- 
proach of cold, incident 
to glaciers, the inliabi- 
tauts retreated to the 
caverns for warmth and 
shelter. 
It appears certain that there was at the beginning of this epoch a 

material change in human art and industry. The Chelleen and St. 

Acheuleen implements, so widespread, were superseded by objects now 

found in the caves and rock shelters oc- 
cupied by man. This statement might 

be doubted if it rested on a few objects, 

but its truth will be apparent when we 

consider that these implements have 

been found throughout western Europe 

by hundreds of seekers, in thousands 

of places, and to the number of tens of 

thousands, but never associated with 

cave implements or objects; while on 

the other hand, tens of thousands of 

cavern implements and objects have 

been found in their appropriate places 

and never associated with Chelleen or 

St. Acheuleen implements, I say never — 

if any have been thus found, the proportion is insignificant, not one in 

a huuilred; so that the statement is substantially true.

Hundreds of caves and rock shelters have been found throughout west- 
ern Europe bearing evidence of their human occupation during this jieriod. 
Many of them are located on the River Vezere, Dordogne. Plate 5 repre- 
sents a map of the Riv- 
er Yezere, from Les 
Eyzies, where it emp- 
tiesinto the Dordogne 
River, to Lo iVIoustier, 
10 kilometers above. 

The principal pre- 
historic caverns in 
this neighborhood are 
LeMoustier, La Made 
laine, Laugerie Haute 
and Bassej Gorge 
d'Enfer, Cro-Magnon, 
and Les Eyzies, but 
there are others small- 
er in size and less in 
importance. M. E. 
Riviere discovered a 
new cave during the 
summer of 1890. 

In the summer of 1884 the author visited this locality and inspected 
and worked in some of these caverns. The cavern of Le Moustier has 
been excavated to the bed rock throughout, and all traces of human 
occupation in prehistoric times removed. The principal objects of 

human industry found therein 
were points and scrapers, with 
cores, flakes, chips, debris, etc. 
On the plateau at the top of the 
cliff some of the smaller and finer 
specimens of the St. Acheuleen 
type have been found, with 
chips, cores, and debris. This 
has been presented as evidence 
of the relationship between the 
Chelleen epoch and the INIous- 
terien, which succeeded it. It

is remarkable, although alleged 
to be an undoubted fact, tiiat 
these two localities, in such jux- 
taposition, should have fur- 
nished implements so different in style, type, mode of manufacture, 
and use, and have represented stages of culture so different. This 
has been accounted for on the theory of the intervention of the Glacial

period aud that tlie two stages of culture represent man's adapta- 
tion of his art to the changed environment. In the earlier epoch 
the climate was warm, and man had apparently, or possibly, no need 
for shelter or clothing, as no traces of either have been found; all his 
implements were weapons, and suitable for the chase or, if need be, for 
war. In the later epoch the weapon became a spearhead or harpoon 
(more likely the latter), while a new implement, the scraper, is intro- 
duced, by which he is supposed to have utilized the skin of ani- 
mals which he had killed by making 
them into clothing or coverings. The 
caverns which were his new habita- 
tions furnished him both shelter and 
warmth. 

MOUSTBRIEN EPOCH (CAVERN 
PERIOD). 

In the subdivision of the Cavern 
period the earliest epoch has been 
called Mousterien from the cavern of 
Le Moustier (Plate 6). The peculiar 
art of this epoch and that which caused 
the subdivision are the points (Plate 7) 
and scrapers (Plate 8) found in such 
numbers, especially in this cavern. 
These specimens may not be the high- 
est art, yet they are interesting from 
an artistic point of view no less than from an anthropological, for 
they are the lirst improvement in flint chipping, the earliest art learned 
by man. It is a step in the evolution of that art, and will be followed 
by another step in the next succeeding epoch. These points are the 
earliest analogous to spearheads, made or used by man, and undoubtedly 
the ancestor or forerunner of all arrow or spear heads. 

The Mousterien scraper was tlie earliest implement of its kind made 
by man. These, as well as the Mousterien points just described, were 
made usually of flint, and by chipping. These specimens are addition- 
ally interesting as the first step taken by man in the art of tanning 
and as being the oldest specialized tool or utensil known to him. 

The flint chipping peculiar to this epoch, shown by these sijecimens, 
is that one side of both utensils is left smooth as when struck from the 
nodule or nucleus by the blow that knocked off the flakes (Plates 7 
and 8, fig. a). The back has been made shapely by smaller flakes, 
usually three in number, struck off longitudinally (Plates 7 and 8, fig. b). 
This is the very beginning of this art, and as we see how the operation 
became improved we will wonder at the adeptness with which it came 
to be performed.

PREHISTORIC ART. 371 

SOLUTREEN EPOCH. 

Tbo art of flint chipping lias never, in prehistoric times, nor among 
prehistoric or savage peoples, attained a higher degree of excellence 
than during the Solutrren epoch. There seems to have been an evolu- 
tion from the rude and heavy Chelleeu implement up to the fine Solu- 
treen leaf-shaped blades. What time elapsed between the two we have 
no means of determining; it is to be counted by geologic epochs and 
not by years or centuries. There was a regular and steady improve- 
ment in the art of flint chipping, produced, apparently, by continued 
experiment and practice, the result of which must have been communi- 
cated or transmitted from father to son, from teacher to student, from 
master to apprentice, until the ideal flint chipping was attained in the 
Solutreen leaf-shaped blades (Plate 0). During this 
epoch the spear-heads of the Mousterien epoch became 
perfected in form, style, and delicacy of manufacture. 
They increased in leugth and decreased in thickness, 
until the standard imi)lement took the shape of a laurel 
leaf and the name " leaf-shaped," which name has been 
perpetuated and extended to similar implements 
throughout all ages and countries. They will be 
shown in the chapter on America. The leaf-shaped 
spearhead was not only enlarged to the largest size, n-. lo. 

but it was diminished to the smallest, so as to assimi- eoundended solu- 
late them with the leaf-shaped arrowheads (Plate 9). ^(!)Tceaper^°"^"

side (Plate 10), and herein it was probably the ancestor or i.)recursor of 
the notched or shouldered arrow and spear head which traveled through- 
out both hemispheres while civilization was yet young, and long before 
history began. 

The same kind of development was made in the scrapers, by which the 
scraping edge was changed from the side to the end (fig. 10), aud this 
round ended scraper has continued through all prehistoric times and 
among almost all savages in historic times who have used any such kind 
of implement. Practically the same utensil has been seen in the hands 
of untaught savages by men still living. The stone scra^ier of the 
Eskimos, used until the advent of the Russian on their shores, was not 
different inform, appearance, or mauufacture, and probably not in use, 
from that which began in this epoch. The same utensil was prevalent 
amoug North American Indians as it was among all savages who used 
skins for dress or tent covering, and so had need to use the scraper. 
The teshoa^ so named by Dr. Leidy, and used by the Indians on the east- 
ern slope of the Rocky IMountains, is the i)rincipal, ii' not the only, 
exception. This was simply a round or oval spawl struck from a smooth 
quartzite or other hard bowlder, the scraping edge of the spawl making 
the edge of the tool. The United States National Museum possesses 
specimens of it. (Cat. Nos. 170602, 170667, and 11540, U.S.N.M.)

M. Lartet named this the Keindeer epoch because of the great num- 
ber ot" remains of this animal found during his explorations in southern 
France. Plate 11 is a perspective view of the station of La Madelaine. 
It is a rock shelter, not being of sufficient depth to be 
called a cave or cavern. The rock overhangs, as is 
shown in the plate and as is still better shown in 
plate 12, of Laugerie Basse. The base of the cliff 
was eroded by the stream and the projection af- 
forded shelter for its human occupant. The author 
spent some time in this station, and found it, con- 
trary to the condition of the other stations, far from 
being exhausted. Its owner pro- 
hibits further excavation by the 
public, and requires everything to 
be done under his own supervision 
and with his special permission. 
The station extends many yayds 
along the foot of the cliff. We were 
much surprised, on digging through 
the earth, which appears to have 
washed in and filled up the mouth 
of the shelter, to find a deposit 8 or 
10 feet deep of flint flakes or blades, 
more or less broken. Their principal 
value was in showing the extent of 
human occupation, either by a great 
number of x^eople or for a long 
period of time, or perhaps both. 
After all the excavations made by 
Lartet in 1862-63 and by his follow- 
ers in the twenty succeeding years, 
these flint pieces were found by us 
in such numbers that they rattled under the stroke of 
the pick or mattock as though we had been digging 
in a dump heap of broken pottery. 

Cro-Magnon. — Cro-Magnon is on the west side of 
the Eiver Vezere, at the railway station of Les Eyzies, 
16 miles south of Perigueux. The prehistoric station 
occupied very nearly the site of the present house. 
The station has been entirely excavated and destroyed. 
Here was found the celebrated human skull which 
has given its name to the prehistoric race of Cro-Magnon. These 
caves and shelters having been the habitations of prehistoric man, they

coutaiu tbe broken or lost objects of liis industry and specimens of his 
art. (See Plate 1.) 

The culture of La Madelaine was similar to that of Laugerie Basse 
(See map, Plate 5), but Laugerie Haute had a somewhat different cul- 
ture, and this caused La Madelaine to be chosen as the representative 
and to have given its name to the epoch. 

Laugerie Basse. — Plate 12 is a perspective view and section of the 
rock shelter of Laugerie Basse. Many objects of prehistoric human 
industry and art have been found in it. It was undoubtedly occupied 
for a long period of time. The house shown was located on or over the 
entrance to the cavern, which, however, had previously been filled with 
fallen rocks and earth. The entrance for excavation of the cavern was 
through the house and under its floor. The principal work of excava- 
tion was done by M. Massenat, of Mailmont, near Brives (Correze). 
The overhanging rock, projecting about 45 feet, af- 
forded the shelter. This precipice of rock extended 
with intervals for several miles up and down the river, 
with many other occupied caverns and rock shelters, 
which showed a dense population or long-continued 
occupation, or both. 

l^espite the employment of horn and bone, flint con- 
tinued to a large extent to be used for imj)lements. 
The scraper of the Mousterien epoch had its edge on 
the side, while in the Madelainien epoch the scraping 
edge had changed to the end (fig. 17), and this form 
continued into historic times. Flint flakes abounded 
during this epoch, some large, long, and thin, with 
sharp edges, probably used for knives (fig. 18) ; others 
small and fine, with delicately wrought corners 
and points (fig. 19 a, &), probably intended for drills. 

Here we leave paleolithic flint chipping, and be- 
cause the man of this epoch turned his attention to other manifesta- 
tions of art, we have to follow him. The subject will receive further 
attention in the chapter on the Neolithic period. 

Engravings on Bone, Horn, and Ivory. 

This epoch is most important in the history of art, marking as it 
does the earliest human expression of the beautiful, of art for art's 
sake. It has been said that this expression marks the first step in evo- 
lution from savagery. If so, this step was first taken during this epoch 
and in this locality, for here prehistoric art of the Paleolithic period 
made its first manifestation and attained its highest grade. 

The art of this locality was indigenous. It was not an imitation, and 
it seems not to have been borrowed nor to have migrated. It appears 
to have been a manifestation of the natural art tendencies of the 
human mind.^ It consisted sometimes of sculpture done in the round;

sometimes of etchings or engravings on stone, bone, or horn. If on 
wood, such specimens have decayed or been otherwise lost. Bone, 
horn, and ivory became known during tliis epoch, and were now first 
employed by man for testhetic and decorative purposes as well as for 
utility. 

Judge E. Piette, one of the most ardent and persistent explorers of 
the prehistoric stations of France, confining his investigations largely 
to the grottoes, caverns, and rock shelters belonging to the Paleolithic 
period, having spent twenty-five years in this pursuit, has made dis- 
coveries and formulated theories with regard to the arts and industries 
of the early prehistoric man in that country that are entitled to serious 
consideration. 

He awards the fullest credit to the investigations of Lartet and 
Christy, of Vibraye, Franchet, Garrigou, and others. He admits the 
discovery of three types of human industry as found in the caverns of 
Le Moustier, Laugerie Haute, and Madelaine, and eulogizes De Mortillet 
for his creation of the A rcheo Ethnologic science, or as De Mortillet 
himself puts it, Palethnology. 

Judge Piette concedes the importance of the discoveries and studies 
of these leaders, and joins their followers, now comprising all the 
students of the science in France and nearly all in Europe, and the rest 
of the world, in the belief now universally accepted that man occupied 
western Europe contemporaneously with the great mammals of the 
prior geologic epoch, now extinct, such as the three species of elephant, 
the cave bear, Irish elk, and Rhinoceros mtrcMl and ticliorinuH. 

The early explorers were so elated with the discovery of the many 
evidences of this early existence of man that they were apparently con- 
tent to note only the differences in the objects of his art and industry 
found in the different caverns. Judge Piette pushed his investigations 
another step and sought to discover stratigraphic differences in every 
cavern explored. In this task he has been eminently successful, and 
has traced through the various strata of the different caverns the origin 
of human art and industry, its evolution, apogee, transformations, 
decline, and sometimes its disappearance. Out of all this he has, while 
adhering generally to the classification of De Mortillet, made some 
changes and given new names. He doubts if the origin of man or his 
first ai)pearance as man is accounted for in De Mortillet's classitica- 
tion. So he gives to his earliest term the name of '■'■passage,''^ associat- 
ing man with the Elephas antiquus, U. meridionaHs, E. primigenius, 
and a pliocene fauna. His (Jhelh'*en epoch has the same fauna, with a 
predominance of ^^ep/trts antiquus, and all this he declares to have been 
preglacial. 

His next grand division includes the Glacial epoch with the divisions 
of Mousterien, wherein man was associated with the Elephas primi- 
genius, Rhinoceros tichorhinus and Ursus spekvus. This comprises the 
art and industry of the same epoch in de Mortillet's classification. 



PREHISTORIC ART. 375 

Piette's classification here differs from de Mortillet's, he inclining' to 
use the names of animals and of industries rather than of localities, 
so instead of Solutreeu and Madelainien he calls them Equidian, Taran- 
dian or Cervidian, and Hij)piquian. But so far as these epochs relate 
to art he denominates the entire period as " Glyptique," and divides 
them, beginniug with the earliest, according- to their respective strata 
as found by him in the caverns, as follows: (1) Sculptures in the 
round; (2) sculpture in bas-relief ; (3) engravings, champleve ai)d simple, 
needles, harpoons of reindeer and deer horn. This closes his period 
"Glyptique," and takes him into the epoch of transition at the close 
of the Glacial period. In the latter part the ancient animals have 
become extinct aud are replaced by the modern fauna. His next sub- 
division, still in the Paleolithic period, he calls "Asylien," from the 
Grotte Mas d'Azil, the peculiar art product of which was the colored 
pebbles to be described in tlie paragTaph on painting. During this last 
division of the period of transition the glaciers had disappeared, the cli- 
mate had changed, and the reindeer and other cold-loving animals had 
departed. The classification of Judge Piette subsequent to this, though 
changed somewhat in form and name, is substantially the Keolithic or 
polished-stone age, the age of bronze, and the first age of iron, as 
now recognized by prehistoric arch.eologists. 

Judge Piette says that the remains of Equus predominate in the 
lower strata in the caverns, while the remains of Cerinis predomi- 
nate in the upper strata or those next above; and for this reason he 
makes two principal divisions of his period Glyptique — Equidian and 
Cervidian. He draws from these facts the conclusion that there was a 
change in the food of man. During the earlier period he used more 
horse meat, which accounts for the larger number of bones; while in 
the later period he used a greater amount of deer meat, which accounts 
for the greater number of the bones of reindeer, deer, etc. From these 
circumstances and those growing out of them he speculates upon a 
change of climate. Horses, it is said, would only live in a moderately 
cold climate on plains producing grass and similar food. The reindeer, 
on the other hand, prefer dry and cold food, as moss and lichens, and 
they will thrive and increase in a climate where horses would perish. 
Piette certifies to the fact that the replacing of the horse by the reindeer 
is more complete in the caverns in the mountains than in those in the 
valleys aud on the plains. One ])oint made by Judge Piette is that 
much the largest number of sculptures in the round (which forms his 
first division) were in ivory, while the greatest number of engravings 
and other specimens of the Glyptique art were on horse bone and 
reindeer horn. This, curiously enough, is the order in which the 
animals furnishing the respective materials are agreed to have lived 
in that country — first the elephant tribe, mammoth, etc., then the 
horse, and lastly the reindeer. 

It is not intended by the author to follow in this i)aper Judge Piette's

classificatiou. It may be more correct than auy otlier, but that has to 
do with archiieology rather tlian with art, and so its consideration need 
not be here continued. Nor is it intended, in presenting specimens of 
art, to attempt any chronologic order of their ai)pearance, nor to seiDa- 
rate them into schools or classes. This may be done in the future, but 
the science of Prehistoric Anthropology is not sufficiently advanced to 
enable it to be done now with assurance of success. The prime fact 
with which we have to deal is that these specimens were made by man 
at a period of high antiquity, and that they show an unwonted ability 
in primitive art. We have here art for art's sake. Artists and art 
critics may theorize as to its origin, but here we have the hard fact.

The most wonderful exhibition of art in this epoch was in the repre- 
sentation of animal life. Sometimes the animals are at rest, but many 
times they are in action. Hunting scenes are depicted in which the 
hunter, a man, is shown in pursuit of his game and in active conflict 
with it. In one a man is throwing a spear; in another the serpent bites 
his heel; deer are shown in action; the reindeer with his nose high in 
the air and horns thrown on his back; a reindeer browsing and repre- 
senting a veritable landscape with perspective drawing. The engrav- 
ing and sculpture rei)resent the mammoth, the reindeer, horse, bison, 
musk ox, birds, tish, serpent, and others. Some of these are arctic 
animals now found only in cold countries, others are extinct. A mam- 
moth was engraved on a plaque of ivory (part of his own tusk), a

cave bear was engraved on a pebble of schist, a poniard was made of 
reindeer liorn, the handle being in the form of the reindeer himself. 
These all came from southern France, and are evidence of the existence 
of these animals in that locality, for the artist must have seen them 
before he could depict 
them. They are the first 
known drawings from life. 

Gravers. — Fig. 20, a, h, 
c, d, represents gravers of 
flint. These gravers are 
not dressed to a sharp 
point from all sides, but 
have a V-shaped point, as 
does the graver's tool of 
to-day. We have many of 
the originals in the Na- 
tional Museum, of which 
some are quite worn, while 
others are sharp and could 
be now used to engrave 
the bones as in prehistoric 
times. 

The implements and 
utensils of everyday use 
were decorated with an 
art by no means contempt- 
ible. The ornamentation 
of harpoons, daggers, and 
similar objects shows an 
appreciation of decorative 
art as applied to house- 
hold or domestic uses not 
nn worthy of the niue- 
■»8nth century. These 

ustitute the first or ele- 

jntary series. The de- 
signs are geometric, and made by dots or lines arranged with greater 
or less regularity, straight, curved, or broken. The figures are formed 
in festoons, zigzags, hatched work, but more frequently in chevrons. 
With the employment of almost every kind of geometric design, forming 
elaborate combinations, we have to remark that the more simple — nota- 
bly circles, crosses, or triangles — were not employed. (Plates 13, 14, 15.) 

Harpoons. — The art work on harpoons exhibits considerable artistic 
ability as well as manual dexterity (fig. 21, a, b, c, d). The art work 
of these is displayed in the purity of the drawing, in the straightness 
of the lines, in the symmetry of the design, and in the general accu- 
racy and truth with which it has all been executed. The main shaft of

the harpoon is straight from oue end to the other, while the barbs are 
symmetrically placed; whether opposite or alternated, their spaces are 
equal, they have the same form, and point in the same direction. 

Animals. — The animals of this epoch were represented in great num- 
bers, about three hundred specimens having been discovered, compris- 
ing nearly every animal known. There are some reptiles, more fish, a 
few birds, and many mammals. The reptiles are scarcely determinable. 
Of the fish, the salmon, the trout, and the brochet have been recognized. 
A swan was found at Laugerie Basse. There is a fair representation of 
what is probably the entire fauna of the epoch. The principal ones were 
the cave bear, mammoth, reindeer, horse, ox (two species, the urus and 
the aurochs), deer, mountain goat, antelope, chamois, wild boar, wolf, fox,

bear, lynx, otter, seal, walrus, and rabbit. There are a few representa- 
tions of animals as yet unrecognized. One is the small animal resem- 
bling a cat, engraved on both sides of the bone disk (fig. 58). To this 
list of animals, of course, man must be added. 

The care bear. — Fig. 22 is an engraving on a fiat stone or water-worn 
pebble of schist, about 6 by 4 by 1 inches, found by Dr. Garrigou in 
the Grotto of Massat (Ariege), a few miles south of Toulouse. The 
original is in the prehistoric museum in Foix, where the author saw it. 
The characteristics of the animal are well represented ; one can see its 
prominent forehead, the irregular line of its back, immense body, short 
and lieavy legs. It is identified as the Ursus spela^us, or great cave 
bear, which occupied that country in numbers during the Quaternary 
geologic i)eriod. It is extinct and has been during all historic time.

Its existence is only known from the finding of its fossil bones (fifty- 
seven individuals were found in the neighboring' Grotto of I'llerni), and 
from this the only pictorial representation of it ever made from life. The 
engraving bears its own evidence of genuine antiquity. It shows a cer- 
tain degree of art and will compare favorably in point of execution with 
the average representation in outline of such an animal in our natural- 
history school-books. The 
correctness of the drawing 
seems to be indisputable, for 
it corresponds exactly with 
the fossil skeletons of the 
animal. The United States 
National Museum possesses 
a skeleton of one of these 
animals in Anthropological 
Hall (Cat. No. 17l'850). 

Mmmnofh. — Fig. 23 rep- 
resents a mammoth, Ule- 
2)has primigeuius (Blum.), 
engraved on a laminated 
fragment of his own tusk. 
It is a thin, oblong piece 
of ivory, convex on the side 
according to the cylinder of 
the tusk, and slightly con- 
cave longitudinally accord- 
ing to its curvature. It 
was found at La Ma delaine 
by M. Lartet, and was de- 
scribed in " Corapte Rendus 
de 1' Academic des Scien- 
ces," 1865. The original is 
in the Museum of Natural 
History in Paris. The lofty 
skull, the bulging and 
curved forehead, the curved 
tusks and shaggy hair, iden- 
tify it satisfactorily. There 
have been many skeletons 
of the mammoth found in 

various i^arts of tlie world, all fossil. That from the Arctic regions of 
Siberia, found by a Russian merchant, is well known. It was brought 
down, reconstructed, and is now exhibited in the museum at St. Peters- 
burg. The sketch of that specimen, made by the traveler who discovered 
it, was not better made than is this one, done by the cave dweller of 
southern France. It is so well done that one must believe the artist 
had seen the animal, if he did not make the drawing from real life. 




380 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

This paper lias notliing to do with real mammoths, when or where 
existing. It deals only with artistic representations of the animal made 
by prehistoric man. Certain engravings of the mammoth have been 
found in the United States which are claimed to have been made by 
the aborignes. The author inserts them here, so that all pictures of 
this animal will be grouped together for comparison as works of art, 
and not at all with the contention that they belong to the same epoch, 
were made by the same people, or that they represent the same cul- 
ture. The American specimens are inserted solely for convenience of 
comparison. 

Mammoth [Lcnape stone). — Plate 16 (fig. 1) shows the celebrated Len- 
ape stone which has been described by, and received the approval of, 
Mr. Henry 0. Mercer, Curator of American and Prehistoric Archaeology, 
Museum of the University of Pennsylvania. 

This paragraph has been submitted to Mr. Mercer with a request for 
his criticism. He wrote the following : 

Eleven years liave passed, during which I have continually watched the subject. 
I have found no reason to doubt the genuineness of the Leuape stone. The specimen 
still in the possession of Col. H. D. Paxson is an isolated case that might well have 
deserved prolonged study on its merits. 

At a time when uncertainty prevailed as to human antiquity in North America, as 
to the late survival of certain Pleistocene animals like the tapir, sloth, peccary, cas- 
toriiides, mastodon, and mammoth, and as to the true scope of Indian picture writing, 
this surprising document came to light suddenly near a center of archaeological 
study.' Not marred by any patent flaw, or notoriously treacherous association, it 
seemed to invite active investigation from the outset. But the position of those 
then responsible for the welfare of archaeology, who at little pains deposited an onus 
prohandi on the shoulders of the witnesses for the stone and went on their way, hag 
been negative from the first. To say again that they have not visited the locality, 
have not addressed themselves to the pros and cons, and have ignored three other 
carved stones found at the same locality, is to reiterate a conviction that they have 
slighted the subject. 

It has been objected that, while the object itself was original, the 
design or engraving thereon was modern. Mr. Mercer still believes in 
the genuine aboriginal character of the engraving as well as of the 
object. 

No argument is here made on this question, which belongs to archte- 
ology more than to art, but the author sees no reason to doubt the 
authenticity of the design or engraving, and it is i^resented as an 
example of aboriginal American art, representative of a mammoth or 
mastodon. Mr. Mercer wrote an elaborate description of the stone and 
its discovery, entitled ''The Lenape Stone, or the Indian and the Mam- 
moth," published in 1885, and the reader who desires to examine the 
details and arguments is respectfully referred thereto. Tlie circum- 
stances, so tar as concerns us, are that the aboriginal implement of 
slate represented in plate 16 (fig. 1), of the form called gorget or per- 
forated tablet, drilled and broken as shown, was found in the years 

' Doylestown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania.

tion, Wilmington and Baltimore Eailroad, Delaware, on the surface 
of a tilled field which had been covered for manuring purposes with 
peat taken from what Dr. Cresson calls "the fallen forest layer in one 
of the adjoining estuaries of the Delaware River." The engraving 
represents a mammoth resembling somewhat that found at La Made- 
laine (fig. 23). It was engraved in much the same manner, and might

have been done with the same kind of flint gravers. It is on a Fulgur 
shell, indigenous to America, and found on the coast from Delaware to 
Florida. The authenticity of this engraving has also been attacked. 
Dr. Cresson and Mr. Saurault are both deceased, and no other than the 
internal evidence presented by the object itself and the declaration of 
its finding as aforesaid can now be furnished. Without stopping to 
argue for the genuine aboriginal character of the engraving, it is only 
fair to say that the appearance of the object and of the engraving are 
indicative of antiquity, and that it presents no traces of modern work. 
There are no indications of its having been doctored or in any way 
tampered with, and, like the former disputed engraving, it is presented 
(subject to future discoveries) as a genuine example of aboriginal art.

ing. This specimen is from the cavern of Thayingen, near Lake Con- 
stance, Switzerlaud. It is engraved npon a piece of reindeer antler 
and possibly was the fragment of a hdto7i <Je eommandement. The piece 
here represented is, taken in its entirety, probably the best art picture 

yet found belonging to the 
Paleolithic period. The 
one view shown represents 
both sides of the antler, 
as though it had been un- 
rolled. Spread out thus, 
it has the appearance of a 
veritable landscape with 
water in the foreground, 
herbage around it, and the 
grass, etc., in the back- 
ground where the reindeer 
is feeding. This specimen 
is engraved two- thirds nat- 
ural size. The size and 
outline of the body with 
development of the antlers 
denote a full grown male. The peculiar the pinched form of the belly, 
apparently exaggerated by the artist, is common after the rutting sea- 
son. The head, horns, and body lines are true and correct. The eye 
is of the proper form and is rightly placed. The attitude of the animal 
indicates him to be walking slowly, browsing or grazing as he goes. 
Fig. 25 is an illustration (of which others will be shown) of the use 
of a piece of material to repeat different objects or views, sometimes 
each from a different 
point of view, and one 
overlaying the other. 
This is a fragment of 
shoulder blade. It repre- 
sents a woman's form 
which has been engraved, 
and over it afterwards a 
reindeer of which the two 
hind legs only remain. 
This specimen was found 
at Laugerie Basse and be- 
longs to the collection of 
Judge Piette. The woman 
has a collar about her neck and bracelets upon her arms. There are 
marks said to represent hair, but which may be only the eflbrt of the art- 
ist to represent the rounded appearance of the human form instead of 
presenting it in profile. The foiegoing specimens are particularly fine 
art work. They illustrate the proposition emphasized and repeated

tbrougliout this chapter, of the natural desire of man in his original 
state of savagery to enjoy and jiossess objects which to him were beauti- 
ful, and that he was thus prompted to make them in his chosen style 
of beauty. These specimens represent art for art's sake. In them sav- 
age man was at play with art, and apparently for the sole purpose of 
gratifying his natural taste for beauty — to satisfy his natural desire 
for beautiful things. And the same is true of many other specimens. 
There is no pretense of utility in these. They indicate the use by 
aboriginal man of such materials as he had within reach to make objects 
the beauty of which would give him pleasure. This was equally true 
whether the objects, as harpoons, bone x)oints, spears, batons, were for 
use or were, like the foregoing, only pictures to be hung on the wall. 

Fig. 26 represents an engraving on several fragments of the rib 
of an ox or bison. These fragments were found in the Grotto of 
Corgnac, Dordogne, and being joined together, were found to fit and 
to represent a reindeer with a javelin or arrow in his right flank or 
hip. It was collected 
by E. Douliot and is 
in the Musee St. Ger- 
main. It has the same 
pinched apj)earance of 
the belly as noticed in 
the Thayingen speci- 
men. Although imper- 
fect and incomplete, 
it shows with a few 
strokes and in no uncer- 
tain manner the charac- 
teristics of the animal. 

Fig. 27 is an engraving made upon a fragment of the metatarsal of a 
reindeer, showing parts only of two animals. The principal one is in 
view and has been taken for a reindeer. This has been decided by the 
general outline, the form of the shoulder, and the tuft of hair charac- 
teristic of the male reindeer, Avhich appears on the brisket. In front 
of the ear is an indication of antlers, a slender horn without brow antler, 
which would indicate a young animal. The hatchings or hair mark- 
ings on different parts of the body indicate the projections of either 
bone or muscle. There are imperfections to be noted about the head, 
if a reindeer was intended to be represented. Though well set on, the 
head is short, the angle of the lower lip, compared with the chin, is too 
salient, the nose is dilated as it is not in the reindeer and the eyes are 
immoderately large. 

The horse. — The bones of the horse have been found in some of these 
caverns in great profusion, and it would appear that this animal spread 
generally over western Europe in Paleolithic times. Fossil bones have 
been found which belonged to other varieties of the horse, now extinct.

AN ANIMAL OF THE HORSE SPECIES, ENOEAVED ON BONE. 

Grotto of Thayingen, Switzerland. 

Collection, Piette. 



Whether they were ancestors of the horse or not, as is said by Prof. 
Edward 1). Cope in his celebrated "Phenaeodus PrimoKvis," has never 
been satisfactorily determined. There has been found, in the Grotto of 
Thayingen in Switzerland, near Lake Constance, an engraved bone (fig. 

28) representing an animal 
of the horse kind, but dif- 
ferent from any known 
variety. It may ha ve been 
a horse, the drawing of 
which owes its peculiar- 
ity to the inability of the 
artist, biit one can hardly 
think so, for, while in 
form, shape, and general 
appearance this might be, 
yet he could hardly have 
so misrepresented the tail. 
It is, however, remarkable 
that in all those peculiar- 
ities wherein it differs from the horse it should be found to correspond 
with the anoplotherium, an animal belonging to the Upper Miocene and 
reported by Prof. W. Boyd Dawkins ^ as having been found in western 
Europe. There is a similarity between them 
which, to say the least, is remarkable. Fig. 29 
represents a horse on a fragment scarcely more 
than an inch long. It was found at Bruniquel, 
and the original is in the British Museum. Horses 
were frequently represented. They are all j^ecu- 
liar, but the peculiarities are reproduced in every 
engraving. Their heads are large beyond the 
proportions of the modern horse; they have hog 
manes bristling upright; the tail is thin and small, and stands out 
nearly straight. These were attributed to the peculiarities of the 
artist rather than to the horse, but since the discovery and reconstruc- 
tion of the skeleton, notably that 



by M. E. Chaiitre in the Zoologic 
Museum in Lyons, these peculiari- 
ties are found to belong to the 
animal and to justify the fidelity 
of the artist. Eig. 30 represents 
one of the prehistoric pony horses, 
with large head, carried low, big

one or more holes drilled tlirough the center, transversely. On the 
beam of specimen, fig. 31, a, h, is an engraving of a string of four 
horses following each other. The specimen comes from La Madelaine 




and was found by Lartet. This figure shows two sides, obverse and 
reverse, of the same implement. It is the shed antler of a reindeer. 
The first tine has been cut off apparently with a flint knife or saw;

three horses have been eugraved on one side, four on the other. The 
horn is of such conformation as to afi'ord a grip at the lower or heavy 
end, like a pistol grip, while the hole is so placed as to permit the 
insertion of the index finger. It is evident from inspection that this 
hole was bored subsequent to the engraving of the horses, for it passes 
through and cuts off the head of one horse on one side and of two 
horses on the other. Fig. 32 is a representation of a fragment of a 
similar bone with a horse engraved thereon and a hole bored, likewise 
after the engraving. Fig. 33 represents the shed antlers of a young 
reindeer from La Madelaine, showing the amputation of three tines, 
and with four holes. The holes in this, contrary to the former and 
many others, have either been bored before the decoration, or it was 
designed in advance for them. The stem or beam has been cut away 
laterally on each side so as to make a flat surface for the boring of the 
holes. The top or concave side bears thirty-three transverse notches 
or cuts, mostly equidistant, though some are arranged in pairs. 

A number of these implements 
have been found in the Paleolithic 
caves of western Europe. Their 
use is unknown and they are so 
peculiar that nothing should be 
omitted which will serve for their 
elucidation. Various uses liave 
been suggested for them, as split- 
ting soft wood, barking trees, or 
as weapons for game and for war. 
It has been suggested that they 
were to be held aloft in battles 
in the hands of the chief like 
an imperial standard, and so they have been called in French 
" batons de commandement," but none of these uses have been proved. 
The last has attached itself to them as a name, but possibly only in 
default of a better. Other persons have considered them as mere 
weapons. M. Pigorini, director of the Kircheriano Museum in Rome, 
suggests they might have been used as bits for horses' bridles. 
Implements analogous and made also of reindeer horn are found 
among the Eskimos and are said to have been used principally to kill 
game when near enough to be struck with it in the hand. Some trav- 
elers have given to them the name of " slave killers," from their alleged 
use by the Eskimos. 

Lartet noticed in his early explorations that they were lacking " in 
the more ancient caves or stations which were characterized by the 
presence of lanceolate (leaf shaped) implements and by older fauna." 
He remarks ' their absence in the stations Aurignac (Haute Garonne), 
La Chaise (Charente), Des Fees (Allier), and Gorge d'Enfer. On the 
contrary, in stations having the barbed bone harpoons, these batons

were found, and he mentions the rock shelters of Bruniquel (Tarn et 
Garonne), Le Chaffant (Vienne), and the caverns of Massat (Ariege), 
Les Eyzies (Dordogne), Mont Saleve (Geneva, Switzerland), and 
Schussenried (Wurtemburg), as having them. 

Fig. 34 is an important and inter- 
esting specimen of these batons de 
commandcment of reindeer horn. Tlie 
two figures represent the opposite 
sides of the same piece. They are, 
however, turned end for end, and were 
discovered in 1886 in the Grotto of 
Montgaudier, not far from Angou- 
leme, in the valley of the Eiver Tar- 
doire (Charente), near the western 
I coast of France, by M. Paignou, who 
I worked in company with M. Albert 
^., Gaudry. The archipologic stratum 
i contained another engraved boue, 
4 bone needles, polishers, an ivory 
I point, scrapers, and a magnificent 
£ Solutreen leaf-shaped blade. 
I M. Gaudry, the eminent paleon- 
? tologist of the Museum of Natural 
I History, Paris, received this baton 
^ de commandement and it is now dis- 
I played in the museum. He made an 
^ extended description of the object 
I before the Academy of France in 
I July, 1886. In November he con- 
p tinned the account of his excavations 
f in this grotto, and reported what he 
I found in the lower strata— speci- 
mens of bones of the Rhinoceros 
tichorhinus, corresponding to and 
contemporaneous with the Mouste- 
rien epoch. Below this baton de com- 
numdement, in the same stratum and 
associated with it, were bone jioints 
and a barbed harpoon, so M. Gaudry 
concludes that the stratum contain- 
ing this baton was subsequentto the 
epoch of Moustier and contempora- 
neous with the cavern of Chauffaud, in the same neighborhood. He 
says of this specimen : 

It is made of reindeer horn and is pierced with a large hole at the end. It is covered 
with engravings which show the certainty of the artist's miud and the sentiment of

the forms which he depicts. The woi k is so iine that it requires the magnifying glass 
to bring out all its beauty. One face of the baton represents two seals, such as 
inhabited the sea oft' the coasts of France. One of them is seen in its entirety with 
his four members. The hinder members, so singularly carried among these animals, 
are exactly rendered, each foot having five toes. The size and extent of the tail is 
plainly to be seen. The head is delicately executed. The muzzle with its mustache, 
the mouth, the eyes, the hole for the ear, all indicate a degree of artistic ability. 
The other seal is not to be seen in its entirety ; it is larger and has indications of long 
hair about its neck. The fore foot is exact. In front is a fish, which is either a salmon 
or a trout. Its spots are shown and the ventral fins are affixed to the abdomen. 

On the opposite side of this baton are two animals, long and slim, 
the longer being 34 centimeters, or 13^ inches. They are not complete, 
but one shows its head and the other its tail. M. Gaudry thinks they 
repieseiit eels, possibly serpents 5 non constat, but they may have been 
sea serpents. All these are represented on other specimens from various 
caverns and grottoes. Engravings of the seal have been found in the 
cavern of Yarier (?), Haute Savoy, by M. Gosse, one in the Grotto 
of Gourdan, by Judge Piette; the salmon, or trout, in the cavern of 
Goye', Belgium, by M. Dupont; and the eel, or serpent, in Laugerie 
Haute, by Lartet- and Christy.' 

Implements have been found which, while similar in form, are in such 
fragmentary condition that one can not determine their function, but 
bhey p; rsistently represent the hole bored as herein described. Some of 
these should be classed with sculptured rather than engraved objects, 
bu cross reference should be made so that they may be studied in both 
classes. Fig. 35, a, h, c, shows three of these objects, all bifurcated, and 
of which a and h represent animal heads on the end of the bifurcation, 
while c re{)resents a different decoration. The relation between these 
fraginentary implements, with their respective holes, and the former 
implements, batons de commandement, is as yet unknown. 

The bison or ox {urns or aurochs). — Fig. 36 represents a man chasing 
an aurochs or bison. It is engraved on reindeer horn, comes from 
Laugerie Basse, was found by M. Massenat, and belongs to his collec- 
tion. Tlie man follows the bison and is in the act of throwing a spear 
or harpoon at him. Action on the part of both is shown, and the chase 
is well rei)resented. It is an artistic representation of a prehistoric 
hunting scene. The position of the arms, especially the right, is awk- 
ward. The man has a sardonic grin. The marks, possibly represent- 
ing Ijair, nearly cover his body. Whether they were really liair or were 
intended only to show light and shade and the rounded parts of the 
body has never been fully decided. M. de Mortillet believes them to 
rei)resent hair and, therefore, that the man of this epoch was covered 
with hair. Tliis i)iece furnished the basis for the reproduction of the 
man of the Cavern period displayed in the anthropological section of the 
Paris Exposition of 1889. (Plate 18^;.) Fig. a of this plate represents 
the artists of the Chellcen epoch displayed at the same time and place.

bottom edges of the handle have been wrought into festoons, with cres- 
cents engraved opposite each x)oint of the festoons. The sculpture is 
entirely ornamental, except so far as it may roughen the handle for pre- 
hensile purposes. The opposite side of the handle is similarly engraved. 
Fig. 38 represents an engraved bone from Laugerie Basse. The 
engravings are supposed to be 
calves, as in fig. 37. 

It was one of the peculiarities 
of the art work of this epoch that 
in such examples as we are now 
considering the animals or heads 
engraved followed each other in 
single file. They appeared to be always uniform in size, height, age, 
sex, and species. 

Ruminants (?). — Fig. 39 is one of those uncertain animals classed by 
Lartet and deMortillet as ruminants, leaving the species undetermined. 
Lartet says : ^ 
The size and shortness of the shonlder, while exclnding the reindeer, the stag, and 

the horse, might yet serve for a bovine animal, but 
the fracture at the attachment of the horns de- 
prives us of the means of judging if it be of this 
character. The withers do not seem high enough 
for the aurochs ; or, at least, they would do only 
for a young individual. The marks for hair, in- 
dicated on different parts of the body, are also 
distributed with intelligence for the purpose of 
making the drawing more effective.

Christy in the Grotto Les Eyzies, and is in

barrel of a large bovine animal. That it is bovine is indicated by the 
smallness of the tail, straightness of the hocks, advanced position of 
the male organ, and the sndden rise at the withers; unfortunately the 
fracture occurs where the long, shaggy mane, determinative of the 
si)ecies, ought to begin; but the fore- 
going are all characteristic of the 
bison. There is no drawing upon the 
opposite side. 

The specimen represented by flg. 41 
is remarkable in that it was discovered 
and displayed long before any person 
in Europe suspected the existence of 
prehistoric man. This specimen was 
found in 1824, by M. Brouillet in the 
Grotto of Chaffaud, in the valley of the 
Charente. M. Brouillet was a notary 
at Charroux. He kept this specimen 
in his collection until the year 1851, 
when he sent it to the Musce Cluny. 
The specimen remained there, under 
the catalogue number of 2467, along 
with other objects found at the same 
time — bits of flint, bone points, har- 
poons, etc. — without attracting atten- 
tion to its (or their) prehistoric charac- 
ter. It is of reindeer horn and has been 
broken into three jiieces, two of which 
only remain together. It bears the en- 
graving of two animals, one following the otiier; the one in front is 
complete, standing, and at rest, the chin or nose prominent, the lips 
hanging, and the ears straight and long. The dorsal vertebrae are 
indicated by a series of vertical marks. Tlie animal has no horns and 
has the appearance of a hart or doe — the female of the stag or deer 

kind. The second ani- 
mal, which follows the 
first, is cut in two 
across the shoulders 
by the breakage of the 
bone. Its head i s finer 
and its muzzle is more 
pointed. The ears are 
straight. This speci- 
men was discovered in the Musi'e Cluny by M. Gabriel de Mortillet, and 
his son Adrien made a drawing and a full report of it, which was pub- 
lished on November 25, 1885, in the Magazine I'Homme. This speci- 
men, therefore, is evidence incontrovertible of the genuineness of this 
and similar objects made by prehistoric man and found in the caverns

whicli lie occupied of western and southern France. This was found 

thirty years before anyone had an idea of even the existence of pre- 
historic man — certainly 
that long before it was 
suggested that prehis- 
toric man made or used 
such objects or orna- 
ments. It was deposited 
in the principal museum 
of Paris — still before the 
discovery of prehistoric 
man — where it has re- 
mained practically until 
the present time without 
suspicion of its relation 
to, or use by, him. It 
would have remained 
there unknown but for 
the fortunate discovery 
of M. Mortillet. 

Ibex. — Fig. 42 is the 

palm of a reindeer's brow antler, found by M. Lartet at Laugerie Basse. 

It bears the nearly entire engraved outline of a 

horned animal. The horns point upward with a 

slight backward curve; a short distance behind 

the horns is an indication of ears; below the chin is 

a tuft of hair or beard. The croup, tail, and fore 

feet are destroyed by fractures. The hind legs are 

sadly distorted in whatever position the animal 

may be represented; even if he was engaged in 

scratching himself with his feet, it was impossible 

that he should scratch his belly with both hind feet 

at once. But all the characteristics mentioned 

point to the possibility of an ibex or similar animal. 

Fig. 43 represents another engraving, also suj^posed 

to be of the ibex or goat family, made on a frag- 
ment of a reindeer's brow antler palm. Figs. 44, 45, 

and 46 are engravings of animals of the goat or ante- 
lope tribe. Fig. 45 represents the head of a large 

saiga (antelope). It was engraved on bone and 

was found by Judge Piette in the Grotto of Gour- 

don(Haute (laronue). This animal has been extinct 

in that locality throughout historic times. Fig. 46

was found at Laugerie Basse and is in the collection

were engraved on harpoon or similar points of bone, liorn and ivory. 
One on a reindeer antler represents Howers with eight and nine petals, 
respectively,' There is a long branch with its leaves on the baton de 
commandement on reindeer horn from the cavern at the foot of Mont 
Saleve, Geneva, and the branches with their leaves 
on the haton of Montgardier (fig. 34). 

Fig. 47 represents a truncated harj)oon or dart 
from La Madelaine. In the center and lower part 
are two representations of what are believed to have 
been flowers, the npi)er one with nine petals. Nearer 
the top is an animal form resembling the outstretched 
skin of a carnivore with a narrow snout and thick 
tail like the fox or some allied animal. On the oppo- 
site side (not shown in the figure) are two horses' 
heads placed back to back. This figure is taken from 
"Eeliquite Aquitauicte,"^ Fig, 5 on the same plate ""''''^'^■ 

represents a similar implement, on which a horse is carved partly 
on side and partly on edge, which is unusual in these objects. 

Marine animals. — Fig. 48 represents an engraving 
found by M. Massenat at Laugerie Basse. It is on 
bone and is rude and incomplete. It is supposed to 
represent a whale. Fig. 49 shows a seal engraved 
upon the canine of a cave bear. It is from Sordes 
cavern (Landes) and belongs to the collection Chap- 
lain-Duparc. Fig. 50 represents an ovibus (?), while 
fig. 51 represents a fish. 

Some of the engravings found in these caverns, 
while undoubtedly showing human intention and 
handiwork, are difficult of identification. If we were 
studying this from the view-points of a biologist or a 
zoologist it might be necessary to use greater precaution in the naming 
of the animals, but as they are here considered from 
an artistic view-point, the special name of the animal 
is not important. (Figs, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, and 58.) 
Man. — The x)aleolithic artist was not so successful 
in his representations of human kind as he was of cer- 
tain animals. The figure of a man chasing an aurochs 
(fig. 30) has been described. Fig. 59, on a beam of 
reindeer horn, represents man, but not in an artistic 
manner. He is in the midst of a line of horses with a 
serpent or eel at his heels. It is the fragment of a 
haton de commandement, was found by Lartet and Christy in the rock 
shelter of La Madelaine, and is now in the Musee St. Germain. On 
the other side are figured two calves' heads, one following the other, as 
usual. Other representations of human form will be noticed in the

Examples of art practice. — These art manifestations 
were intended bj'' their makeis not alone for utility, 
■ as in the decoration of implements, weapons, and 
^ utensils, but they display a love of art for art's sake. 
I Many of them, as already shown, appear to have been 
S made for practice, or from a natural and innate love 
o of the beautiful. They are mere essays, in which the 
^ artist used the same piece without any attempted 
r relation of one figure to the other. The sketch of five 
g reindeer. Marquis de Vibraye's collection (fig. 62), is 
^ an example. Another is the sketch (fig. 64) of eight 

animals, horses and deer, from the cavern of Lortet. 
5 ; Each of these specimens consists of a single piece, 
Q I the lines of each figure running into each other. 
S § I The drawings have been done on different planes, 

^ « I ^ so that some are upside down, some are complete, 
g H 1 1 others incomplete. The ancient artist utilized his 

1 ^J material, as does the artist of to-day when he uses 
a I the same canvas again and again. The mammoth 
> '^ engraved on a lamination of his own tusk, and the 
o bear on a flat pebble, are done solely for their art; 
'^ while the sculptuie of the mammoth and reindeer, 
^ decoration of the handles of daggers and poniards, 
H are such utilization as put one in remembrance of 

2 similar work done by Benevenuto Cellini. 
g Fig. 62 represents an engraving upon a fragment of 
o schistose slate found at Laugerie Basse by Franchet, 
« and belongs to the collection of the Marquis de 
" Vibraye. It represents five reindeer engraved from 

different points of view. Two of the animals are 

shown upright, while three others are represented 

upside down. One sketch is complete and is well 

done. Nearly every person has seen similar sketches 

in modern studios; the artist practices by making 

different sketches or fragments on the same canvas. 

These specimens are evidence of the art tendency of prehistoric man, 

at least in this locality and epoch. While the evidence points in that 

direction and is hardly explainable upon any other theory, yet the 

number of these specimens has hardly been sufficient to establish the

theory in every country inhabited by Paleolithic man. If a greater 
number of art works had been found, or if the distribution had been 
more extensive, the general proposition would be better established. 
We are to remember that in our search for the evidences of prehistoric

It is a fragment of shoulder blade, which we have seen was a favorite 
material with the i)rehistoric artist. Its surface 
is large and flat, and was convenient for the en- 
graver. The artist has made divers essays, and 
has represented the legs of the horse in various 
positions and attitudes, always in action, possi- 
bly on the trot. Not being satisfied with them 
one way, he has represented them in another, 
men suggest evidence of the artistic longing of him who may have 
_^,,^ ^ - ~i^_^^^ been an engraver and de- 



signer of renown, whose 
reputation may have re- 
sounded along the banks 
of the Yezere, u]} and 
down the Pyrenees, in much the same way that artists from these 
localities, possibly his descendants, are figuring in the world of art in 
the expositions and museums of to-day?

SCULPTURE. 

The paleolithic artist did 
not confine his eftbrts to 
the fine arts of drawing or 
engraving, but included 
sculpture, and his manual 
dexterity and artistic abil- 
ity were more successful in this direction than we would have supposed.

horn. The weapon is about 16 inches in length. The blade was first 

sawed from the reindeer horn longitudinally, then cut or scraped to a 

point. It is intended for thrusting and not for 

cutting. The handle is sculptured to represent 

a reindeer. The blade is a prolongation of the 

hind legs, the fore legs are drawn close to the 

belly, and, with the body, form the handle, which 

can be held firmly, while the head of the animal 

forms the pommel. The nose is thrown up, 

which brings the horns on the back, to which 

they are attached. While the sculpture of this 

specimen may not be so fine or delicate as some others, or may have 

deteriorated by use or exposure, yet the general outline is correct and

horns flat upon the back and brought out in relief, the fore legs drawn 
to the front and the hind legs drawn up and to the rear. Their exten- 
sion formed the blade. The specimen is ivory, was found at Bruniquel

Judge Piette's persistence and success as an explorer into the pre- 
historic; stations of the Paleolithic period in France have already been 
mentioned. One of his most extensive and successful explorations was 
ill the cavern of Brasseinpouy at Chalosse (Landes). The usual strati- 
fication of occupation was found, beginning with the early Paleolithic 
at the bottom and progressing successively through the later epochs 
toward the top. The mammoth and rhinoceros, cave bear, cave hyena, 
and reindeer were found in their respective strata. Ivory was sufli- 
ciently plentiful to be dug out by the spade full. Worked 
points of bone and horn, flint points, scrapers, and flakes, 
and similar evidence of human occupation abounded. 
Engravings on bone and horn were found as in other 
paleolithic caverns in the district. In stratum E, about 
18 inches in thickness and at a depth of 11 to 1 -J feet, 
specimens of the human form were found sculptured in 
the round from ivory. The collection of Judge Piette 
contains nine statuettes of the human female figure in 
ivory, seven from Brassempouy, one from Mas d'Azil, 
and one from Laugerie Basse. They were divided into two groups. One 
represented women, fleshy, gross, with breasts pendant, abdomen round 
and protuberent, and thighs firm and heavy. One of these Judge Piette 
has named the Venus of Brassempou3^ The second group were the 
reverse of all this, with figures thin and straight, without protuberances, 
and slight representation of flesh or muscle, having much the same 
appearance as fig. 69. One of the latter group, more complete than 
any other, represented a female head covered with a capuchin bonnet.

period there does not appear to have been any care or preservation 
of anything for future generations, for there were no tombs, no burials, 
no monuments, and, except the caverns, no habitations. There appears 
to have been neither opportunity nor incentive to preserve such objects. 
But in the fragments we can recognize the artistic feeling of the people. 
It is even contended by some investigators that different schools of art

can be recognized in different localities; that the art of the Pyrenees 
was different from that of the Dordogne, and the same between the 
caverns of Switzerland and Savoy and those of western France. The 
animals represented have been done with sufficient exactness to enable 
us to determine what was intende<l. M. de Mortillet has said that while 
we are here in the presence of the infancy of art it is far from being the 
art of an infant, and MM. Cartailhac, Chauvet, Piette, Perrot, and

the others who have written upon this subject have followed him in 
this. These, with other introduced specimens, show the innate desire 
of man for things beautiful and his natural 
wish to make them so. Philosophers, psycho- 
logists, and even anthropologists have theorized 
and speculated as to what aboriginal or natural 
man may have thought, wished, or desired in 
originating art, and they will continue to do so; 
but we are, by this work, brought face to face 
with the solid aud irrefutable fact of what he 
did. The artifacts are our only evidence in 
this regard. We are dealing with the prehis- 
toric. There is no history, no written record, 
no record at all, other than these objects. As 
by them only do we know of the existence of 
man at this epoch, so by them only can we dis- 
cover the origin of the art by which they were 
made and the thoughts, wishes, and desires of 
the man who made them. 

In order to justify any speculation concern- i ^U If 

ing the ratiocination or psychologic manifesta- 
tions of primitive man in matters of art or deco- 
ration, it is proper we should tirst know as much 
as possible of the facts of those manifestations. 
Almost the sole jjurpose of this memoir is to 
collate and present these facts. Its title de- 
clares this purpose. With mere speculations it 
has little to do, but in the presentation of facts 
concerning the origin of human art as shown 
in its earliest known manifestations it makes 
serious claims. 

The specimens of engraving and sculpture 
maybe divided as follows: (1) The engraving 
bj'^ simple lines cut in plain surfaces which corre- 
sponds to the engraving of our own time; (2) 
engraving more or less in relief, and (3) sculp- 
tures in the round, representing human or ani- 
mal figures. Piette reverses their order and 
contends that they occurred thus. 

METHODS OF ENGRAVING AND SCULPTURING. 

The manner of working would seem to have 
been as follows: With the aid of tiint instru- 
ments, which may have been knives, flakes, 
points, scrapers, or what not, the surface of the material was prepared 
by the removal of the outside or rough portion. The reindeer horn was 
preferred to that of other deer, probably because its surface w^as smooth

and firm. These pieces of flint or similar ones are always found as- 
sociated with the engravings. The surface having been prepared, 
the objects to be represented are outlined, probably, by marks with the 
graver, cutting away the substance to a greater or less depth, accord- 
ing to the sketch desired. The knives, flakes, and gravers may have

been inserted in handles or operated directly by hand. No evidence 
has been found of the actual employment of a handle. The scrapers 
are more likely to have been so used, for the same implement iu.serted 
in a handle has been employed in modern times by the Eskimo. 

In the sculptures the surface, after having been reduced to proper 

form, seems to have been 
polished by rubbing, and ac- 
cordingly there is found just 
such an implement as would 
lierform this service, and no 
other service than this has 
ever been suggested to ac- 
count for the existence of 
the implement. It is a piece 
of flint, called in French re- 
louclioir,^ rudely chipped 
into the general form of a 
man's foreiinger. The ex- 
treme point of the finger is 
""'"'"■ smooth and polished, evi- 

dently the result of much rubbing, and apparently not done by grinding. 
Of course this descrii^tion and the assignment of these utensils is 
more or less theoretical, but it is not open to the objection of many of 
the theories proj^ounded by wise men of our day, for —

MATERIAL. 



]A 






stone, wory, hone, liorii, wood. — There are several 

engravings and sculptures in stone, but they are 

comparatively few. The fragments of two such 

were found at tlie station of Solutre, but it is not 

well determined what animals they were intended 

to represent. The great cave bear on a waterworn 

schist or schistose pebble, found at the Grotto of 

Massat; a horse found at Les Eyzies by Lartet and 

Cliristy; and the sketches on slate of five reindeer 

from LaMadelaine; with some small examples from 

the Grotto of Ohaffaud, are the principal examples 

of the use of stone. 

Ivory was employed principally for sculpture, as 

witness the discovei-ies of Judge Piette at Brassem- 
pony and Mas d'Azil just 
described (pp. 374 and 400), 
though the representation of 
the mammoth on his own tusk, 
found by Lartet at La Made- 
laine, was an engraving. The 
teeth of animals were also 
employed. The canines of the bear have been 
found with a seal engraved in feeble relief. 

Shoulder blades and ribs were often utilized. 
Deer horns frequently served, but the material 
does not seem to have been altogether satis- 
factory to the prehistoric artist. The reindeer 
horn answered better. It was smooth, hard, 
homogeneous, tough without being fibrous, and 

would cut or scratch in any direction. It furnishes about three-fourths 

of the specimens of the art work of the period. 

Wood may have been employed for art work, but of this we have 

little or no proof. Keasoning by analogy, we may con(!lude that it was 

so used. It was easier to work than was bone or horn, and would serve 

equally as well for many objects. The objection that no such specimens 

of wood have been found is offset by the answer that they may have 

all decayed.

PAINTING. 

While the art products of Paleolithic man ran principally to sculp- 
ture and engraving, there is evidence of his acquaintance with and 
practice of the art of painting. Color has been used in decoration by- 
prehistoric man. 

Judge Piette made 
extensive excavations 
in theGrottoMasd'Azil 
(Ariege), France, and 
reported interesting 
discoveries relating to 
prehistoric art in the 
direction of painting. 
He assigned this art to 
a time near the close 
of the reindeer epocli of 
the Paleolithic period, 
to which he gave the 
name Asylieune. The 
characteristics speci- 
ally noticeable in the 
present connection 
were the hundreds of 
warerworn pebbles-, 
flat, oval, with rounded 
edges, resembling in 
size the net sinkers of 
eastern United States, 
which had been painted 
or colored in different 
figures. A series was 
exhibited by Judge Pi- 
ette at the Paris Expo- 
sition, 1889, where tiie 
author had good oppor- 
tunity for their inspec- 
tion. Judging from 
their appearance and material, the pebbles had been gathered in the 
bed of the stream Arise, which flows through the Grotto Mas d'Azil. 
They were of quartz, quartzite, and schist, and run from white to gray. 
They were artificially colored with iron peroxide, still found in the cav- 
ern. It was ground and kept in shells {Pecten jacohwus) and in cup 
stones, specimens of which were found with the paint still in them, and 
was served Avith spatulas of bone. The color was red or reddish, rather 
maroon, about the color of iron rust. The figures consisted of dots

from one-fourtli to oue-lialf or five-eightlis inch iu diameter, placed iu 
rows on the flat sides of the pebbles, from one to eight on each pebble; 
of bars or parallel bauds of the same character ; of zigzags, crosses, 
some circles with central dot, and others of similar designs in great 
number. The painting can best be described by supposing much of 
the work to have been done by light touches of the finger. It was 
Judge Piette's tlieory that these marks and signs had some meaning. 
They might have formed a numerical system. Still others may have 
been alphabetic or ideographic signs, still others symbolic. These 
pebbles were found in a particular stratum of the grotto. They were 
not placed in any order, but were scattered throughout the stratum. 
The meaning of the painted designs on these pebbles has never been 
decided and probably never can be; but in our present state of knowl- 
edge they represent man's earliest use of color for purposes of decora- 
tion; and, consequently, were the very beginning of the art of paint- 
ing.^ They may be more than this, but of this much we may feel certaiin, 
that whatever was intended by their makers, whether they were for 
ornamentation only, " art for art's sake," or had some special significa- 
tion as numbers, signs, symbols, etc., they were surely an appeal to 
the color-sense through the eye, and so represent the very beginning of 
the painter's art. They were an advance upon the glyptic art which 
had theretofore prevailed, and had thus far been the only artistic mani- 
festation by man. 

For description of the excavation of Mas d'Azil see "Etudes d'Eth- 
nographie Prehistorique," by Judge E. Piette,^ and for illustration of 
the colored pebbles see su])plement to same pai)er.-' 

The employment of colors in the exe(uition of savage art can be 
traced to a considerable antiquity; and their use, though continued 
into modern times, does not at all depend upon the intervention of' 
civilized man. 

The original mineral colors were probably the red and yellow ochers, 
red and yellow iron oxides, black from charcoal, and white from chalk 
and lime; but vegetable colors were not difiicult to obtain from leaves, 
fruits, roots, stems, and seeds; for the extraction and use of these pig- 
ments and colors in the various savage decorations and adornment was 
not above the most primitive conceptions. While there is no trace of 
the use of colors in Paleolithic times in Europe until the late discovery 
of Judge Piette, and but little in Neolithic times of that country, yet 
the employment of colors by prehistoric peoples of other countries was 
extensive and effective. Beyond this, it displayed considerable power 
and was withal difficult of execution. 

The use of an extensive scale or palette of colors by our North 

' The coloring of human bones preparatory for secondary burial is not forgotten; 
but it was ceremonial or religious and not decorative; besides it was later.

American Indians is well known. The works of Ool. Garrick Mallery 
on "Picture writing of the American Indians," of Dr. Washington 
Matthews on the Navajos, of Dr. W. J. Hoffman, Dr. J. W. Fewkes, 
Mr. F. H. Cashing, Col. J. J. and Mrs. Stevenson, and others, are filled 
with illustrations of the use of color by these savages. One has only 
to call to mind the descriptions and representations of the early trav- 
elers, or the pictures of Catlin, whose "Gallery of Indian portraits" is 
in the National Museum' to recognize the fact. These instances, while 
perhaps all historic, are representative of culture beginning before the 
advent of the white man. 

The Peruvians and the Mexicans were adepts in placing the colors 
upon their cloths. The colors were so well fixed that they were not 
even modified by the decomposition of the dead bodies, and the wrap- 
pings of mummies buried centuries ago retain their primitive colors, 
even when the original fabric is decayed to shreds. 

The Mexicans probably obtained the remarkably brilliant coloring of 
their pictographs by somewhat analogous processes. These picto- 
graphs in manuscript, of which only a small number have reached us, 
embrace tbe history of the country, its national traditions, the geneal- 
ogies of its kings and nobles, the rolls of i)rovincial tributes, the laws, 
the calendar, religious festivals, and the education of the children — a 
complete summary, in fact, of all that concerns the manners, customs, 
and life of the people. They were painted in various colors on cotton 
cloth, on prepared skin, or on a strong and tough paper made from the 
fibers of the agave. At times the artist depicts scenes from real life. 
At other times he records facts by means of hieroglyphic, symbolic, 
or other characters — conventional signs that have been handed down 
for generations, and on which innovation is prohibited. Another series 
of pictures illustrates the education of children, their food and pun- 
ishments. The father teaches his son to carry burdens, to steer a 
canoe, or to manage the fishing tackle. The mother instructs her 
daughter in domestic duties; she sweeps the house, prepares tortillas, 
and weaves cloths. These pictures present the distinct outlines and 
bright colors which the Americans sought most of all. Evidently we 
must not ask them for models of decorative painting. Their complete 
ignorance of ^proportions and the laws of perspective demonstrates 
that their art was the exclusive product of their own genius or of the 
instinct of their race, and that they had not been subject to any foreign 
intiuence. 

The region of piedrafi ir'mtadas (painted stones) in South America 
extends from Guiana to Patagonia. They are found in the wilds of 
Brazil and La Pla-ta as well as in the more civilized districts of Peru 
and Chili, and they betray everywhere a remarkable analogy. In the 
solitudes of Para and Pianhy, Brazil, are numerous intaglio sculp- 
tures executed by unknown peoples. They represent animals, birds,

and men in various attitudes. Some of the men are tattooed; others 
wear crowns of feathers; and the picture is finished with arabesques 
and scrolls. At La Sierra de Ouca are drawings in red ocher, isolated 
and in groups, without apparent order; and the rocks of the province 
of Ceara and those of Tejuco are covered with tracings not unlike those 
on the rocks of Scandinavia. Humboldt describes intaglios on the 
right bank of the Orinoco representing the sun, moon, pumas, croco- 
diles, and serpents, ill-formed figures defined most frequently by a sim- 
ple outline and manifesting slight advancement in art. 

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ART OF THE PALEOLITHIC PERIOD. 

A few words as to the characteristics of the art of the Paleolithic 
period. It has been already said there were some geometric designs. 
These were by lines or dots, and, curiously enough, never or rarely in 
the form of a cross, triangle, square, or circle, concentric or otherwise. 
They consisted of parallel lines, sometimes crossed, sometimes drawn 
in different directions, zigzags, chevrons, and sometimes the double 
chevron, giving it the appearance of the letter X. On some of the long, 
straight instruments of bone appear undulating, wavy lines, and in a 
few cases are round, slightly fjointed projections — j^rotuberances like 
a mamelon. 

In all these combinations of figures none have been found which 
seem to have any meaning or to have the form of any letter, word, or 
hieroglyjih. They do not correspond to any sign, ideographic or hiero- 
glyphic. The cross is not fo'ind ; there is no representation of sun wor- 
ship, nor of the sea, nor of any divinity, good or bad. Apparently there 
had been no thought other than that apparent upon the face of the 
picture. For instance, when horses are represented following each 
other we can understand there is a drove. When the mammoth is rep- 
resented, we understand that the artist has seen the animal. When a 
man is represented following the bison and in the act of throwing his 
spear, we can understand that a hunting scene is meant. Beyond 
these and similar views no ideas seem to have been attempted. But 
we are to remember the paucity of the sources of our knowledge. 

The designs, whether of drawing, engraving, or sculpture, seem to 
have been original in so far that they were neither copied from other 
drawings nor adapted from other schools or masters. They do not 
seem to have been composed pieces, but drawings made direct from 
nature with the original before the eye of the artist. Those represent- 
ing the two horses' heads and that representing the hind legs of the 
reindeer and the naked woman would appear to have been of this kind. 

There have been found in western Europe about four hundred speci- 
mens of this engraved and sculptured art work belonging to the Paleo- 
lithic period. Of these, four fifths are representations of animals. How 
many sketches — mere essays or attempts — have been found, the author 
has no means of knowing. The>e are on fragments and are not sup-

I)osed to have had any utility. Of the implements mteuaed for use 
and thus decorated, the batons de commandement are in the greatest 
number; then dagger points of deer and antelope horn, and the handles 
of poniards. The Musee St. Germain possesses one hundred and 
sixteen objects of the art of ihis epoch. Among these are twenty-nine 
batons de commandement, twenty-two daggers of antelope or deer horn, 
and live handles of poniards; total of these specimens fifty-six, or 
about one-half the entire art collection of that museum. The rest 
are either objects of unknown use or else sketches not intended for 
any use. 

The United States National Museum possesses one hundred and fifty- 
six specimens, originals and casts, belonging principally to the Wilson 
collection. 

LOCALITIES. 

Be it understood that only those stations or caverns in which art 
objects have been found can be reported. We can easily believe that 
there are many wherein they exist but have not yet been discovered. 

Industrial objects and iui[)lements are found associated with the art 
objects, and consequently were made by and belonged to the same 
people, and these are disseminated throughout western Europe in 
almost every locality occn])ied by Paleolithic man. These localities 
extended from the Pyrenees to central England and from the Atlantic 
Ocean to northeastern Switzerland. Divided according to depart- 
ments in Fiance, cantons in Switzerland, and shires in England, the 
distribution, with the names of the principal caverns containing this 
art work, is as follows: 

Beginning with the department of Dordogne, which has furnished 
about one-third of the number found, the caverns are: La Madelaine, 
Laugerie Basse, Laugerie Haute, Gorge d'Enfer, les Eyzies, Cor- 
nac; Mayenne — Cave IMargot; Vieiine — Cottes, Chaffaud; Charente — 
Chaise, Montgaudier, Placard; Tarn-et-Garonne — Bruniquel; Laiides — 
Sordes; Haute Pyrenees — Auresan, Lortet; Haute Garonne — Gourdan ; 
Allier — Massat, Yache; Aude — Bize; Gard — Pont du Gard; Haute 
Savoy — Sali've; Schaft'hausen, Switzerland — Thayingen; Arrondisse- 
nient de Dinant, Belgium — Goyet, trou Magrite; Derbyshire, Eng- 
land — Cresswell. 

Discoveries of x>aleolithic art are being continuously made in western 
Euro])e, thus demonstrating the correctness of former conclusions and 
the genuineness of former discoveries as well as the long and extensive 
human occupation in paleolithic times. Some of those reported since 
the writing of the foregoing chapter are that of M. Julieii of the statuette 
in steatite of a woman in the caverns of Montone, now in the museum 
of St. Germain, reported by Solomon Reinach ; ' that of E. Riviere in the 
grotto of la Mouthe, Commune de Tayac, near Les Eyzies, Dordogne, 
wherein the art work consisted principally of carvings of animals on

the rocky walls of the caveru' associated with objects and evidences of 
Madelainieu art, gravers bone points, etc. ; further discoveries of M. 
Eiviere in the celebrated Cavern of Cro-Magnon at Les Eyzies.^ There 
not only former paleolithic objects of industry were continued, but the 
gravers and engraved bones were found, the most important being a 
fragment of rib bone with the figure of a female engraved in profile 
and at full length. Also art works similar to those in the Grotto de la 
Mouthe found in the cavern of Pair-non-Pair, excavated by F. Daleau 
(Bourg-sur-Gironde) and F. Regnault.^ 

SUCCESSION OF ART PERIODS. 

The nomenclature of the different art cultures heretofore described 
belonging to the Paleolithic period in Europe is of small importance 
compared with the facts of their superi)osition and succession in point 
of time and their evolution in art. The fact of progression from an 
earlier and ruder to a later and higher art culture seems to have been 
satisfactorily established by investigation of the caverns themselves. 
The caverns were gradually tilled up, either by natural or artificial 
causes, or by both. By examining the strata in their succession the 
investigators have demonstrated that there are marked differences in 
the art and industry between tlie objects found in the different strata. 
Of course, the filling up of the caverns must have been in chronologic 
sequence. Superposition means succession. The distinction between 
the various epochs in the Paleolithic period or the distinctions 
between the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods are not to be discussed 
here. The reader is referred to standard works upon the subject. A 
list of these is given in the Handbook^ and in Primitive Industry.^ 

A few salient facts may be presented showing this superposition 
and consequent succession, explaining an improvement in art culture 
from the bottom of the cavern toward its top. For examjde, at Kent's 
cavern, near Torquay, England, in the caverns investigated with all 
possible care during a period of twelve or thirteen years, in which as 
many thousand dollars were expended, under the direction of a com- 
mittee appointed by the British Association, the strata of these early 
occupations were covered by layers of stalagmite spread over what was 
then the entire surface, separating and sealing it hermetically from sub- 
sequent occupation. Under this, in various parts of the cavern, were 
found specimens of Chelleen chipped-tiint itnpleraents, and beyond the 
chii)S and fiakes, possibly the hammers incident to their fabrication, no

other traces of Imniau industry was found. In the Grotto of Placard 
in southwestern France (Plate 17), the same superposition was found, 
which gave satisfactory evidence of this succession of human occupa- 
tion and of the accompanj ing changes and improvements of human 
culture. The strata containing Neolithic and Paleolithic objects are 
distinctly marked, and are separated by a sterile stratum made up of 
imported clay, or earth or of broken stones from the roof of the cavern, 
several, sometimes many, inches in thickness. The cavern of Laugerie 
Haute gives the same evidence and is even more positive, for the sterile 
stratum is about 4 feet 3 inches in thickness. In the Grotto de la Vache 
the stalagmitic stratum .between the Paleolithic and Neolithic indus- 
tries is about 18 inches. The latest indications we have was when M. 
Boule, of Paris, visited the jjrehistoric cavern of Schweitzerbild, near 
Schaflhausen, Switzerland, in the neighborhood of the cavern of Thay- 
ingen which furnished the celebrated engraving on bone of the rein- 
deer browsing- (fig. 24, p. 381). M. Boule has published a report of his 
investigations' in which he describes the walls of the cavern with their 
superposed and consequently successive occupations and corresponding 
improvements in human invention and human culture. (See Plate 17 c.) 

Plate 17 (tig. a) shows a perspective of the Grotto of Placard with a 
section on. the right side b giving the various strata from bottom to top. 
The spaces marked A, ten in number, show the strata which were 
barren, and were without any objects or evidences of man's industry 
or occupation. They were formed of rock which had fallen from the 
roof to the floor during periods when the cavern was not occupied by 
man. The other letters represent spaces, the strata of which were the 
opposite of this, and contained objects representing the various epochs 
of human culture within the period of occupation. L contained Mous 
terien points; A', Solutrcen leaf-shaped points; /, ui)per Solutreen, with 
bone points and those of flint, shouldered (pointes a crau); H, F, E, 
and I), contained objects clearly Madelainien, bone points, engraved 
bones, and even a baton de commandement; C, the archiclogic stratum 
nearest the top, contained Neolithic objects, polished stone hatchets, 
arrow points, fragments of pottery, and bones of modern animals. 

The same difference of industry, showing a difference in culture by 
the stratification in the caverns, occurs in the investigations by Judge 
Piette in the large number of caverns in southern and southwestern 
France, and referred to in this paper (p. 374). In fact, this stratification 
of culture is the foundation of his classification. 

At the conclusion of the excavations and investigations by Lartet 
and Christy, it was the opinion of many prehistoric archa'ologists that 
there was a complete solution of the continuity in the human art and 
industry, as there was in the human occupation of western Europe at 
the close of the Paleolithic period. This opinion grew in strength until 
nearly everyone became an adherent of it. It was evident that the

animals which occupied that country during that period materially 
changed their habitat. The causes of this change have never been com- 
pletely deternnned, but it is supposed that climate was the principal one. 
The foct of the change seems well established. The three species of Ele- 
phas-the last being the mammoth, the cave bear, cave lion, cave hyena, 
and several others-became extinct. Others-the musk ox, blue fox, 
and more than any other, the reindeer-to the number of thirteen species 
of animals, all cold loving, migrated to the far north and have never 
since occupied any portion of the territory in western Europe wherein 
they were so plenteous during this Paleolithic period. Five other spe- 
cies of animals, like the chamois, also cold loving, changed their habi- 
tat bv migrating to the mountains, thus making a complete change of 
eighteen animals at the close of that period. What became of man? 
It was believed, as has been said, that he also migrated or perished. At 
all events, it has come to be the general belief that the evidences of his 
presence, by objects of either art or industry, ceased altogether; that 
there was a hiatus in the occupation of that country by man, which 
was brought to a close by the migration or entry from the far east, of 
Neolithic man or man with a Neolithic civilization. The diflerences 
between these two art epochs will be treated in the next chapter. 

Learned men have speculated considerably concerning the happenings 
at the close of the Paleolithic period in their relation to man. This was 
necessarily speculative. It was impossible to procure definite or posi- 
tive testimony. The only evidence obtainable consisted of the remains 
of man or of his art or industry, while the chronologic identiftcation of 
these as subsequent to the Paleolithic period was extremely difficult, if 
not impossible. One theory is that he migrated to the north, as did the 
animals which were his contemporaries. The similarity between the art 
of the Eskimo in carving on ivory and those carvings found in the cav- 
erns in southern France and described in this paper has furnished the 
foundation for this theory. Another theory is that man in western 
Europe at the close of the Paleolithic period perished. A third theory 
is that he migrated to the for east, the Orient, assimilated with the 
peoples there, became a part of the Aryans, and that his art, taking a 
new lease of life, began its western peregrinations through Mesapo- 
tamia, Ohaldea, the Caucasus, and culminated in Greece, where it formed 
another center of culture, and, spreading through Italy in the period of 
its decadence, it at last reached western Europe, the place of its origin 
and birth.' 

A fourth theory is that he went— jws* ^^^ i^ °ot explained— to the 
north of Africa. The foundation or authority for this is the supposed 
resemblance in the anatomical and physi(;al characters between some 
of the tribes belonging to that country and the Paleolithic man of 
southern France. The Berbers of Africa and the Guanches of the 
Canary Islands and the Caribs of still other islands in the same

latitude or directioii are said to be of tlie same stock as the cave 
dwellers of Frauce. 

But these are archicological or anthropological questions, only inci- 
dentally attecting- art, and therefore need no further argument (u- cita- 
tion of authority. 

THE ASPECT OF 3IAN OF THE PALEOLITHIC PERIOD. 

Of conrse no man of any of the epochs of the Paleolithic i)eriod has 
ever been seen, and therefore he is not described by any person of 
modern or historic times. Xo history, however ancient, will contain 
any rei)resentation of him. Egyptian, Chaldean, and other Oriental 
civilizations may contain sculptured representations of man of high 
antiquity, and possibly one can not say that these were not individuals 
of prehistoric ages, but no one can say, with any certainty, that they 
are. Any attempt to reproduce or represent the cave man must be 
largely theoretical. We have some of his skulls and long bones. We; 
have his pictorial representations as shown by the engravings of that 
time and figured in this paper (fig. 36). It is said by those anthropolo- 
gists who have investigated the subject most profoundly, that the Ber- 
bers of northern Africa and the Caribs of the islands in the Atlantic 
Ocean most nearly correspond with the man of Paleolithic times. 
They judge this by comparison of the anatomy and from a considera- 
tion of the evidence. With this for a foundation, the anthropologists 
of the Paris Exposition of 1880 reproduced groups of the people of the 
Paleolithic period, which were installed on the foyer of Anthropological 
Hall. Plate 18 represents two of these groups. Fig. 1 is a man and a 
woman of the Chelleen epoch, represented in the act of chipping flint 
nodules and making the implements belonging to their epoch, such as 
are shown in figs. 1 to 9. Fig. 2 of plate 18 is a reproduction of the 
cavern of Laugerie Basse, representing a man standing, just returned 
from the chase; while seated opposite him are two women, presumably 
his wives, engaged in engraving the bones of the cavern, some of which 
have possibly been shown in this paper. 

Whether the statuettes found by Judge Piette and forming part of 
his collection were actual representations of the peoples who made them 
or who inhabited the localities is not determined. Piette is of opinion 
that they were, and that the specimens represented two groups or races 
of people— one fat and heavy, the other thin and light. 

CONCLUSIONS. 

Sundry modern authors have enunciated various theories of art, 
based upon the pyschologic proposition of the parallelism of human 
thought and the similarity of human needs. With this and the assump- 
tion of a permanence of the relations of man to his environment for a 
foundation, they have formed the conclusion that peoples or tribes 
in a given stage of culture adopt similar arts and indeed a general 
NAT MUS 96 27 



418 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

teclmologic similarity. They assert the foregoiug rule to be a natural 
law and applicable to widely separated peoples, and not at all depend- 
ing upon any communication or correspondence between them. Others 
applying this theory of similarity of human thought to the evolution of 
art, principally of ornament, seek to explain every design or pattern, 
whether historic or prehistoric, savage or civilized, ancient or modern, 
by declaring that they originally had some occult meaning and that they 
represented some idea (to us unknown) of the aborigines who invented 
them. It is declared that if the psychological, including the anthropo- 
logical, student of the present day could follow these aboriginal designs 
back to their origin they would find them based on this occult, unknown 
meaning. Some of these authors, elucidating this proposition, investi- 
gate the ornaments of savage or primitive peoples, and seek to demon- 
strate this occult and unknown thing to have been the origin of all 
ornament and design. They argue that by the various processes or 
evolution, the design changing as the idea changed, gradually, step by 
step, the idea is lost, and nothing remains to represent it but the pres- 
ent unmeaning ornament. 

The author, deprecating the tendency to lay down general rules, con- 
cedes the possibility of this genesis of ornament in some cases, but 
declines to accept it as one of the rules. He believes his illustrations 
of the earliest designs made by man, their great numbers, and their 
evidently original invention and adoption as ornaments show that the 
foregoing genesis of ornament is not the rule, whatever its application 
in particular cases. He denies the correctness of the general proposi- 
tion of Professor Haddon, especially in its api)licability to prehistoric art, 
"that those who write in the future on decorative art will have to prove 
that any pattern or design is a purely arbitrary form. That assump- 
tion is no longer permissible." ' 

It is always said by the reformers in the i)sychology of art that their 
position could be sustained if we could only get back to the beginning 
of the ornament or to the origin of the art. In the present chapter the 
author has presented the very beginnings of art. No art can, either iu 
point of time or of civilization, be earlier than that here given. The 
specimens, in their relation to time, date to the Glacial epoch, and in 
point of civilization to the Paleolithic period. Nothing that we know 
of man, not even his existence, is earlier than the art works set forth 
herein. There was no other beginning to art; there is no relation 
between this and any preceding period, for so far as relates to art and 
ornament there was no preceding period. Art begun here; these speci- 
mens show the natural or original germ of art iu the human mind unin- 
fluenced by anything beyond the necessary environment of life and the 
inevitable conditions of existence. 

So far as can be known, the impulse which moved man in this art

work was Lis love of beauty and his desire to ^fratify it. This love 
was purely iesthetie and without any utility so far as relates to the 
engravings ou bone, etc., and only partly utilitarian when emi)loyed in 
the beautifying of weapons and implements. 

This innate love of ornament has been pushed by some primitive 
peoples to such extremes as to interfere with the utility of the 
decorated object, as in the carving of the handles of Mangaian symbolic 
adzes of the Hervey Islanders; but this belongs to more modern times. 
We are now dealing with the earlier, the Paleolithic man, with man 
in the infancy of his race, and we lind his ornaments to have been 
more simple; they had not then run to excess nor interfered with the 
utdity of the decorated object. 

These engravings and decorations during the Paleolithic period 
stand as the foundation or beginning of all art, and we will see how, 
through the civilization to come after tliem in the Neolithic and Bronze 
Ages, these Paleolithic motifs were repeated again and again, how 
they varied, how they grew, and yet how, down to the end of the pre- 
historic and the beginning of the historic period, they never got beyond 
lines or dots, which combined made the parallel lines, the chevron, the 
herrmgbone, the zigzag, and simihir simple geometric designs. They 
all grew out of the same beginning and had the same origin. They had 
no occult meaning; they never stood for any great divinity or power, 
whether natural or sui)ernatinal; they were simply lines and dots 
arranged in ornamental form to gratify man's innate sense of beauty 
and because he wished the things he possessed to be beauteous in his 
eyes. 

It is needless to discuss the causes of this natural and innate taste 
on the part of man. He is born with it, it is part of him, its manifes- 
tations afford him pleasure, they gratify his senses, and are to be 
classed in the same category as the delights of the palate, the beauties 
of color, and the sweetness of music. He has these tastes, he enjoy^s 
their gratitication, and he indulges them when he has the opportunity. 

Mr. W. J. Stillma:i, in "Old Kome and the New," says: 

The modern conception of the arts of design is that they .ire intended as the 
mirror of nature; the ancient and true one is that they were the outcome of emotion, 
aspiration, and imagination or spiritual conception of the artist. 

These observations may find other illustrations throughout this paper. 
They might have been postj)oned to another portion, but they come 
properly in this place, and the author has deemed wise to insert them 
here at the conclusion of this chapter, that reference may be made to 
them in the future reading. 

While there have been inventions and duplicate inventions of new 
designs and reinvention of forgotten ones, yet it is the belief of the 
author that as a rule the perpetuation of ornamental designs was by 
inutation and teaching, passing from generation to generation, from 
parent to child, and from master to servant or slave. Decorative art

forms part of human culture aud civilization, and its extension and 
distribution among men was accomplished in much the same manner 
as Sir John Lubbock says of the geographical distribution of human 
races, which, curiously enough, coincides with that of other animals. 
"There can be no doubt," he says, "that he [man] crept over the earth's 
surface little by little, year by year, just, for instance, as the weeds 
of Europe are now gradually but surely creeping over the surface of 
Australia." ' 

Out of this erroneous theory of the parallelism of human thought 
has grown that other equally erroneous declaration of the absolute 
uniformity in man's thoughts and actions, in his aims aud methods 
while he is in the same degree of development, without regard to the 
country or epoch in which he lived. And this theory has been pushed 
until it has been said nothing but geographical environment seems to 
modify the monotonous sameness of man's creations. The theory may 
be applicable to certain peoples under certain conditions. But it surely 
has its limitations and is not applicable to individuals. When stated 
as a rule it does not take into consideration the will, energy, or reason- 
ing powers of man. It leaves out his egoism and his desire for jDower, 
improvement, and happiness, which lie at the very foundation of human 
civilization. The progress of peoples through consecutive stages of 
civilization is entirely compatible with the author's theory that knowl- 
edge of specific objects, the uses of material things, the performance 
of certain rites, the playing of certain games, the possession of certain 
myths and traditions, the carrying on of certain industries, were trans- 
mitted from one generation to the next, from father to son, mother to 
daughter, teacher to ])upil, boss to apprentice, master to servant or 
slave; that the future generations improved or were retarded accord- 
ing to their conditions and surroundings, principally their needs, and 
their relative intellectual faculties and powers of imitation, and that 
this knowledge passed from one country to another chiefly by the 
migration, contact, or communication between their j)eoples. The 
knowledge of the same things by separated peoples, within reasonable 
bounds of similarity, increased by comj)lication of machinery and the 
difticulty of construction, may be treated as reasonable evidence of such 
migration, contact, or communication. 

II. NEOLITHIC PERIOD. 
Compared with Paleolithic. 

The Keolithic period was first discovered in western Europe, although 
savages in that culture-status in other parts of the world had been 
known long before. It, along with the Paleolithic period, is classed as 
part of the Stone age because the principal cutting implements contin- 
ued to be made of stone. There were radical differences between these

two ]>eriods; differeiices in climate, geography, fauna, domesticity of 
animals, sociology, industry, and art. 

In tbe later epoch of the Paleolithic period the climate was cold and 
dry, with extreme temperatures, while in the Neolithic period the cli- 
mate was temperate and uniform. 

In the Paleolithic period were living many great animals, now fossil, 
like the cave bear, the giant beaver, and, most plentiful of all, the 
mammoth. In the Neolithic period these and others to the number of 
seventeen, became extinct. Out of forty-eight well ascertained animal 
species living in France and England during the Paleolithic period, 
only thirty-one continued into the Neolithic period. Eighteen species 
of the animals living in the center of Europe associated with man in the 
Paleolithic period were cold loving. In the Neolithic period, thirteen 
of them, such as the reindeer, antelope, musk ox, blue fox, and white 
bear, emigrated to colder countries by latitude, while five, the chamois, 
marmot, wild goat, and others, have emigrated to colder countries by 
altitude, going up the mountains. 

In the Paleolithic period there were no domestic animals; in the 
Neolithic period they were abundant. 

In the Paleolithic period the population was nomadic; they were 
hunters and fishers, but not agriculturists; in the Neolithic period the 
population was sedentary, and agriculture became well developed. 

In the Paleolithic period there was practically no pottery in England 
or France. There are two localities in Belgium where pottery is alleged 
to have been found. In the Neolithic period pottery was everywhere 
made and used. 

Jn the Paleolithic period there were no monuments or burials, appar- 
ently no respect for the dead, and therefore no evidence of any belief 
in a future state. 

Differences in Art of the Two Periods. 

Among these differences the strangest was in the fine arts. In the 
Paleolithic period we have seen the large number of sculptures and 
engravings, and that even painting was attempted; how nearly every 
animal belonging to that epoch, from man down, has been graphically 
represented in the fine art of that period. On tlie contrary, in the 
Neolithic period there are innumerable .specimens of decorative art as 
applied to industry, while we are wholly without graphic delineations 
of the animals of the period, and no attempt appears to have been 
made to represent any living thing or to make a representation of 
nature in any of its forms. 

Geometric Ornament. 

The art of this period was entirely decorative, and consisted of marks, 
lines or dots, usually by incision, in geometric form, such as hatch 
marks, zigzags, herring bone, chevrons, parallel lines, and thumb marks. 



422 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

These decorations were principally employed in plastic art, and usually 
for the decoration of pottery. Graphic representation of this decora- 
tion shows it to have been similar to that of the Paleolithic period. 
Yet the likeness is more apparent than real. In Paleolithic times the 
decoration was, as we have seen, principally by representations of 
objects taken from nature. The geometric designs were used, and it 
was therefore correct to show them. Their omission would have been 
improper. lUit they were used on few specimens, and on these but 
spariugl}'. Harpoons and points of bone were the principal objects of 
such decoration. Turning back to plates 13, 14, and 15, we will see by 
these harpoons and points how slight was the opj^ortunity of the paleo- 
lithic artist, and we know in how few instances he embraced it. His 
decorations consisted principally of short marks arranged in jiarallels 
and repeated so as to make a iileasing effect. 

Not so, however, in Neolithic times. The designs, still geometric, 
were more complete, were larger, more extended, had greater continu- 
ity, and, as before remarked, were used a thousandfold more than in 
Paleolithic times. 

Plates 19 and 20 contain representations of geometric decoration. 
They are all from western Europe, were taken from actual specimens, 
and can be identified with the originals. The most of these undoubt- 
edly belong to the Neolithic age, though some may be related to the 
Bronze age. This is a matter of no consequence, for the Bronze age 
was but the continuation of the Neolithic age. They are both believed 
to have been the same race of people throughout western Europe. 
Some of these decorations were used indiscriminately during both 
ages. 

Flint Chipping. ^ 

This art was begun in the Paleolithic and continued throughout the 
Neolithic period. The fundamental distinction was that in the Neo- 
lithic period, after the preparation of flint implements by chipping or 
battering and pecking, most of them were finished by the secondary 
lirocess of grinding, and in many cases, polishing. This distinction 
between these two periods in the art of flint or stone working has not 
been appreciated by some of our American anthropologists, and has 
been the foundation of great errors.

of striking off the flakes. This was done with a stone hammer, and

its successful operation required a manual dexterity obtainable onlj- by 
long- practice. It is sufficiently difficult of performance to be ranked 
among the finer arts. After the preparation of the nodules of flint, so 
that the blade can be made a sufficient length, with edges smooth and 
sharp, the upper or top part of the core is struck with the stone ham- 
mer (figs. 78a and 78&) so exact and precise as to the proper point and 
so delicately gauged as to force, that a single blow Icnocks off the blade 
its entire length. There can be no second trial 5 it is success or failure 
at the first stroke. Plate 22 represents another of these cores and 
flakes. The United States National Museum possesses many more of 
the same kind from the same locality. Anyone who doubts flint chip- 
ping being a fine art has but to attempt the operation. He will soon 
discover that it requires a degree of knowledge and manual dexterity 
which can be obtained only after many trials. In this it can be favor-

ably compared to the art of handling the pencil in drawing, the brush 
in painting, or the chisel in sculpture. It re(]uires even a higher 
degree of manipulation than either of these. It involves a combina- 
tion of intellectual understanding derived from a teacher, and a man- 
ual dexterity of the hand obtained only by long practice. 

The Paleolithic period showed the origin, the very beginning, of 
art so far as can be determined from our present knowledge of man. 
The different manifestations of art in the succeeding, the Neolithic, 
period opens anew the discussion of its origin. A hiatus has been 
declared between the culture of the two periods, and the differences 
just described are supposed to represent the renaissance of art in 
the Neolithic period. Western Europe may have been the cradle of 
art for the world. The fine art of the Paleolithic period originated 
there. In the passage to the Neolithic period some branches died 
out or were lost; new ones were employed, whether invented or 



424 REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

imported is not determined j but certain ones, such as flint chipping 
and geometric decoration, and possibly others, were continued into the 
Neolithic period. These latter arts, though forming the principal motifs 
of the later period, did not originate in it, but in the earlier period, and 
are to be credited to it. 

The advanced culture of the Neolithic period was not indigenous to 
western Europe. It must have been imported from some country 
farther east, whence the Neolithic people immigrated when they settled 
in western Europe. That unknown country may or may not have had 
earlier relations with Paleolithic culture (for we know that both civili- 
zations spread over that portion of the globe) and in that country the 
Paleolithic peoples may have taught the Neolithic. But of this we 
know nothing except what is obtained from the cultural objects them- 
selves, found in western Europe. The art of flint chipping, for exam- 
ple, appears to have been continued from the earlier to the later period 
without any hiatus, and this could have been done only by teaching, 
which involves contact and communication between the two ages. This 
contact in western Europe is denied by most prehistoric anthropolo- 
gists and the theory of a hiatus between the periods in western Europe 
is generally accepted, though it has been much weakened. Either the 
theory of a hiatus must be given up or we must admit contact between 
the two ages in that unknown Eastern country prior to the migra- 
tion of the Neolithic peoples to the West. It is easier to believe con- 
tact between the t^^o peoples at an earlier period than to believe in a 
second origin of ciilture. While certain portions of the cultures of the 
two peoples have such similarity as to show contact between them, cer- 
tain other portions have such dissimilarity as to show that the contact 
was not complete or the communication not perfect. With all the dis- 
similarities in their culture, it is difiBcult to believe that the Paleolithic 
man in western Europe carried away all knowledge of the art of flint 
chipping or that it was lost (to western Europe) during the hiatus, and 
that the Neolithic man, on his occupation of that country by migration, 
reinvented or rediscovered it. The author prefers to believe, as the 
most reasonable hyjwthesis, that there had been in some way, unknown 
though it be, such contact and communication between the two peoples, 
either before or after their migration, as enabled the later people to 
learn from the earlier some of their difficult arts, such as the chipping 
of flint, the making of spearheads, harpoons, and scrapers. 

How they came to produce the art of their period is remitted to the 
same study of i)sychology required to determine why the man in Paleo- 
lithic times should have invented any of the arts. That, we have seen, 
was because the art objects pleased him. This desire for pleasure was 
part of the common heritage of mankind, the realization of man's ideal, 
whi('h we call his good taste. This good taste is involuntary, explain- 
able only by ])sycho]ogy and on a par with the question why does the 
child like sweets, or why does one child like sweets and another like

sonrs. or one like music and anotlier not, or like painting, or senlpture, or 
riclies, or science, or literature, or niatlieinatics, or law, tlieology, med- 
icine, bankino', business, war, etc. All we know is tliat on these sub- 
jects (and many others) mankind lias an ideal wbicli lor the time cre- 
ates his standard and forms his taste; in time man, through study and 
contemplation, finds his old ideal fall short of his expectations and he 
becomes dissatisfied with it; by study and contemplation he conjures a 
new ideal; a new ideal in art establishes a new standard of taste, and 
by this he tests his new eftbrt. The argument of condition or environ- 
ment usually applicable to man's industry and sociology has slight 
application to his art. His art is for his pleasure, not for his necessity; 
therefore, the foregoing statement relates only to art objects and not to 
those of utility. The evolution of utilitarian objects as distinguished 
from art objects is governed by man's needs, but he has no need, or but 
little need, for art objects. They are solely for his pleasure, and their 
evolution or change is only to gratify his changed ideal or standard of 
taste. 

The primary and principal implement required for this art work is 
the hammer (fig. 78 n, />), by which the blow is struck and the flake or chip 
knocked off. Rude pieces of hard stone, usually tliiit, quartz, or 
quartzite, were used for hammers, their sharp corners serving to increase 
the j)recision of the blow. When their corners were worn away so that 
an accurate blow could not be given they were doubtless cast away or 
used for other purposes. Practically there is no difference between the 
stone hammers of different countries in the two ages of Stone. 

The successful manipulation of the operation of flint chipping as per- 
formed by prehistoric man entitles it to be classed among the fine arts, 
and requires a few sentences of description. As to material, flint best 
answers the requirements. It should be homogeneous in substance and 
crystalline or cryptocrystalline in formation. When properly treated 
it can be struck off into long flakes or blades, producing a keen, smooth 
edge much the same as slivers of broken glass. The nodules of flint 
having been prepared, the art of the operation consists in judging the 
force of the blow and determining accurately the point of impact; then 
follows the successful manipulation in carrying out this good judgment. 
In justification of the claim that this is fine art it can be said that no 
historic or modern individual has ever attained the success acquired 
by the artist of prehistoric times. 

During the progress of this paper the author has received letters 
from different parts of the United States giving currency to the report 
that it was the belief of scientists that the art of flint chipping was a 
lost art, and that the Smithsonian Institution had offered a reward or 
bonus to anyone who should make the discovery of how it was done. 
This report is entirely without foundation. The art of flint chipping, 
so far as it ai>plies to the small flint or glass arrowheads, or the chip- 
ping of these uuiterials, is well known and is or has been practiced by 



426 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 



niaity persons in the Uuited States. A geutleman from Connecticut 
has sent us a series of small glass arrowheads made by himself. A 
clergyman from Oregon makes of the mottled jasper-like obsidian 
beautiful specimens of small arrowheads called jewel points, mounted 
and sold for use as pins for personal decoration. He makes no pre- 
tense of secrecy nor that they are other than his own manufacture, 
and he sells them as specimens of his art. 

Several persons in various parts of the United States, whose names 
as well as their work arc well known, either make new or alter old or 
broken arrowheads, and they have been known to sell them as genuine. 
Thns doctored they belong to the class of arrowheads denominated 
Division IV, Class I. These have been figured and described by the

author^ and the public warned against them, which warning seems to 
have been acted upon by both makers and purchasers, and the industry 
in that part of the country has practically died out. It is continued in 
Oregon. 

But this industry is confined to comparatively small arrowheads. 
The large leaf-shaped implements and similar objects made by chip- 
ping, which are thin in comparison to their width, made by striking 
ofi" fine and long Hakes reaching to or beyond the center of the imple- 
ment, leaving the edges keen and sharp, have never been reproduced. 
Such implements as are represented in figs. 86 to 95, from the United 
States, and the large ones in plates 9 and 10, from Europe, have never 
been made in modern times or by modern workmen.

BRANDON CORE. 

Fig. 70 represents a core of tiiiit from Braudon, England. The 
flakes (fig. 80) have been struck oft', one after the other, going around 
tlie outer edge, gauging tlie proper thickness for the tttike, the inside 
of one forming the outside of the next. With patience one can rear- 
range the flakes one by one against the core in tlie inverse order in 
which they have been struck oft" until the nodule is reconstructed. The 
core shows the conchoidal fracture made by each blow, and with the 
aid of this peculiarity the flakes can be fitted one to the other, as 
shown in tig. 80. Tlie same operation is performed in making the cores 
and flakes of obsid- 
ian, to be shown fur- 
ther on (Plate liO). 

Conchoidal frac- 
ture. — T he c o u - 
choidal fracture is 
the evidence of a 
blow. Every blow 
which produces a 
fracture in the flint 
leaves such a con- 
choidal figure. By 
it the early discov- 
eries of the exist- 
ence of prehistoric 
man were made, 
and human inter- 
vention in manufactured objects rendered certain. Fig. 81 represents 
one of these Brandon flint cores with its flakes all in place, showing- 
how they were struck off, one after the other. 

Most of the works on prehistoric archa'ology relating to the making 
of arrowheads refer to such stone chipping among modern savages, and 
many of them contain descriptions by travelers and visitors of the 
different tools and methods by which flint chipping was done. ' As we 
are dealing with prehistoric fine art rather than prehistoric archa'ology 
or primitive industry, we need not further pursue the subject of how 
to chij) flint. 

BONE FLAKERS. 

While stone hammers similar to fig. 78 were, as already mentioned, 
the principal tool with which flint chipping was done, yet other imple- 
ments were used. The Eskimo has points of bone or horn called 
flakers, with which, it is said, he pushes or presses off" the smaller flakes.

428 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

Sir John Evans ^ shows representations of these flakers. Capt. John 
Smith, writing in IGOO of the Indians of Virginia, says : " His arrowhead 
he uiaketh quicklj' with a little bone, which he ever weareth at his 
bracer." Sir John Evans- says: 

No sculptor ever haiidlecl a chisel with greater precision or more carefully meas- 
urod the weight and effect of every blow than did this ingenious Indian; for even 
among them arrow making was a distinct profession in which few attained excellence. 

SCANDINAVIAN FLINT CHIPPING. 

Scandinavia stands at the head of prehistoric European countries for 
excellence in flint chipping during Neolithic times. The specimens 
from that country stand as models of such art work. 

Daggers. — Plate 23 represents a dagger or poniard of flint from 
Copenhagen. Its length is Sf inches, width of blade 2J inches, and 
thickness of blade ^ inch. The implement has been made entirely by 
chipping, the blade in its finishing has been flaked always from the 
edge, forming a perceptible ridge in the center. The smallness and 
thinness of the flakes may be imagined from the regularity and smooth- 
ness of the edge. Plate 24 represents other specimens of flint from 
Scandinavia — poniards or daggers. They are of the flint of the coun- 
try, and the chipping thereof is of the same style and exhibits the 
same high degree of manual dexterity as the specimen in plate 23. 
The chipping of the handle of specimen No. 191044, U.S.N.M., is to 
be noted. It shows how by artistic treatment different effects can be 
produced. 

MEXICO. 

Leaf-shaped^ Class A, — The Solutreen leaf-shaped imi^lements have 
already been described and figured (Plate 9). They belong to the 
Paleolithic period, but the same kind of object, of equally tine art and 
difficulty of fabrication, was made in the Neolithic period.^ This 
applies equally to America as to Europe. Plate 25 represents these 
implements from Mexico. They are of the same general type as the 
Solutreen leaf-shaped imiflements which forms Class A of the leaf- 
shaped division in my " Classification of Arrow and Spear Heads."

the peculiarity of its leaf-shaj)ed form nor to the two notches near one

be kept iu view. Tlie material 
of this specimen is not Hint, is 
light reddish m color, comes 
from a ledge and not from a 
nodule, is coarse grained and 
refractory, is not homogene- 
ous, and does not break with 
a regular or conchoidal frac- 
ture. But with these disad- 
vantages, apparently insuper- 
able to a modern arclueolo- 
gist, the ancient artist was 
able by his skill to produce as 
line a specimen of art work 
as is here presented. But for 
its material and the two small 
notches in one end it might 
pass for one of the leaf- 
shaped implements of the 
Solutreen period from western 
Europe.

flint chipping. Its length is 6f inches, width 21 inches, thickness fg 
inch. 

Fig. 85 is from a mound near Naples, Illinois, collected by Col. J. G. 
Henderson. It is of the brown pyromachic flint. It is one of the 
superior specimens of art in flint chipping; it is leaf shaped, though 
one end is rounded while the other is pointed; is 7^ inches in length, 
2^ inches in width, and i inch in thick- 
ness. There are few specimens to be 
seen better representing fine art in 
flint chipping than does this. The 
artist who made it manifests his 
ability at every step. He shows rhat 
he can embody any design of fantasy 
or improvisation in the way of flin 
chipping which his imagination sug- 
gested. This art work is not simply 
the chipping of flint by which the ob- 
ject is reduced in its proportions to a 
given standard, but the artist has 
been able to accomplish that end by 
(•hi])ping the flint in any way he de- 
sired. It is not in the making of a 
single flake that he shows his excel- 
lence, but rather that lie should have 
been able to repeat them with exacti- 
tude as many times as he might wish. 
The flakes have been stricken from 
each edge toward the center. This 
has made the flakes to be about an 
inch long. There are about eleven of 
them in 6 inches of space, making- 
each one slightly over half an inch 
wide. They are extremely thin, one 
might say "as thin as pai)er," but 
they are really about as thick as a 
sheet of tin. So we have flakes an 
inch long, half an inch wide, and thin as tin sheets, that have been 
struck off consecutively, each one exactly like the other, to the num- 
ber of forty-four, without a single miss-stroke or failure. 

The foregoing specimen of fine art is worthy all praise for its excel- 
lence in flint chipping, but the next (fig. 86) is a finer specimen of art, 
more difficult to make, and Avorthy a higher admiration. It comes 
from the same mound as did the former and was collected by the same 
gentleman. It is not so large, being only 3^ inches long, 1-^ wide, and 
^ inch thick. It is of the same brown pyromachic flint as the former, 
but has a finer patina. The chipping being described, its excellence

Instead of the ilakcs being struck from each edge 

toward the center, as in 
almost every other speci- 
men, all of them were 
struck from one edge and 
went clear across the 
rounded side to the other 
edge. As in the case of 
the former (fig. 85), it is 
not the single flake that 
excites our admiration, but 
that it should have been 
repeated with precision 
and exactitude from one 
end of the implement to 
the other and on both 
sides. These flakes are 
about If inches in length, 
^ inch in width, and about 
as thick as parchment. 
Fifteen ofthese flakes have 
been struck from each side 
of this implement — thirty 
in all. As in tig. 85, the 
artist has repeated these 
flakes with precision, diffi- 
cult as it Avas, throughout 
the entire work. Not only 
was each flake like every 
other, but the grouji of 
flakes on one side of the 
implement correspond to

other side.

Obsidian.— The art of chipping required such material as was homo- 
geneous and would break with a clear fracture. All that did so broke 
with a conchoid. Obsidian pos- 
sessed these qualifications. Itbroke 
with a sharp, smooth edge and a 
clear fracture, and was, with flint, 
a favorite with the prehistoric stone- 
chipping artist. The United States 
National Museum possesses hun- 
dreds of cores or nuclei of obsidian 
and thousands of flakes which have 
been struck therefrom. The cores 
are 6 or 7 inches in length and un- 
der. Some have had flakes struck 
off all round, and others only part 
way. These flakes have all been 
knocked ott" by a blow at the top, 
each blow making a flake. There 
are as many as sixteen flakes which 
have been struck from a single core, 
and this has been repeated in lesser 
numbers among many cores. The 
difficulty of this work and the art 
displayed in its performance is man- 
ifested by the fact that the artist 
was able to reproduce these cores 
and flakes in the large and indefi- 
nite numbers suggested. He seemed 
to be able to determine the size and 
weight of his hammer and manipu- 
late the blow with sufficient force 
and accuracy to repeat the result 
any number of times, producing at 
his pleasure hundreds or thousands 
of specimens practically alike. 
Plate 28 represents selections of 
these cores and flakes. These par- 
ticular specimens are from Mexico, 
but similar ones have been found 
throughout the Rocky Mountain region of the United States and on 
the Pacific Coast, and are not uncommon in every part of the world 
where this material is obtainable. The island of Crete is notable for 
the number of these objects, though they are all small. Fig. 88 repre- 
sents a large hooked implement of obsidian from Tepoxtlan, Mexico.

other specimens. Its art work is well shown in the figure. 

Fig. 8!) represents an obsidian blade of large size, whicli, for want of 
a better name, has been called a sword. Its length is 15 inches, width

Oregon. It is an example of fine and delicate 
chipping, which does credit to its maker as an 
artist of the first-class. 

Fig. 00 is a beautiful specimen of rose quartzite. 
Its fine grain alone rendered its manufacture pos- 
sible. Quartzite is a refractory material, and it 
would'have been a testimonial to the ability of the 
artist had he made an implement, without re- 
gard to its elegance or symmetry. However, he 
has succeeded admirably in these points, for the 
implement is nearly perfect in both regards. The 
flakes by which it was reduced were extremely 
:i I small, and the work proceeded little by little. 
^ I Tlie artist must have used the greatest care. No 
I --■ owner of this beautiful specimen would risk a

of four collected by Prof. David S. Jordan. Fig. 93&, also from Cali- 
fornia, is of rock crystal and is the thinnest specimen of its kind in 
the Museum. The chips or flakes broken from these two specimens 
have been extremely fine and thin, leaving the edges and points smooth 
and even, while keen and sharp. Fig. 93c, also asymmetric, is of gray 
flint, and from Chicago. Its finder was Mr. Carl Dilg, and he has

because of the extreme fineness of the point and the thinness of the

It has been remarked 
many times throughout 
this paper that the pre- 
historic artist possessed 
sufficient confidence in 
his ability, and displayed 
such control over his 
tools and materials as en- 
abled him to make any- 
thing out of flint that his h 
fancy might dictate; he ^ , 
did not confine himself | i 
to utilitarian objects, but ~- \ 
was an artist in the true ^ J

is to say, he dealt with y. § !

by Sir John Collier, would ? I i 
be to please his eye and | i 
to gratify his taste. The | :

bly by study and contem-

jects taken at hazard 
from the interior of the 
United States, princi- 
pally from the Ohio and Mississippi valleys, all of flint, in curious and 
rare forms, believed to be entirely without utility and solely to gratify 
an artistic desire. None of them are arrow or spear heads, and none of 
them appear to have been made for any service. They are the work 
of a master who, conscious of his ability, is playing with his art. One

mals; the rest have no likeness to any known object. All of them are 
worked from Hint or some similar vstone; one is of obsidian; they are 

represented about nat-

with fig. 93, shows 
what the prehistoric 
artist in flint was able 
to do in the manage- 
ment and control of his 
tools and materials in 
making fanciful ob- 
jects. 

The foregoing speci- 
mens are small, and, 
consequently, might be 
considered as toys or 
playthings and of no 
value to the prehistoric 
artist, yet it would be 
an error to predicate a 
theory ujion this, for 
there have been others 
equally trivial and ap- 
parently of as little 
utility which bear evi- 
dence of fine art work 
and yet are of large 
size. Fig. 94 repre-

Other specimens of similar workmanship, but of diflerent though of 
equally fanciful form, have been found in the same as well as other 
localities. Gen. Gates P. Thruston' has described these at length.

Polished Stone Hatchets. 



While the chipping' of stoue coutiuuecl throughout the Neolithic, as 
it had in the Paleolithic jjeriod, there was added to it a newly discovered 
art by which the implement might be made smooth and sharp. This 
discovery was the grinding or polishing of stone implements and bring- 
ing out the beauty of their form and symmetry, showing with truth and 
accuracy the fine lines upon which they had been wrought, and adapting 
them to utilitarian objects, tools, and weapons. 

The characteristic implements of the Neolithic period are the polished 
stone hatchets. They are found practically all over the world, showing 
that the Neolithic civilization must have comprised an extensive ])opu- 
lation and endured for a long period of time. The material of winch 
these implements were made differed according to locality, but, not- 
withstanding all differences, their general likeness prevails througliout 
the world. While an experienced prehistoric archicologist may deter-

mine, from an inspection of a X)olished stone hatchet, from what country 
it comes and possibly to what locality in that country it belongs, yet 
the statement is true that they are substantially the same implement. 
The invention of the arts of grinding and polishing, together with the 
form of the hatchet, have been transmitted by migration or communi- 
cation from ])eople to people and from country to country; and the 
knowledge of the implement and the o[)eration by which it was made 
descended from generation to generation and spread until it covered 
the five continents. A series of the polished stone hatchets from 
almost any one of the United States wiH stand as fair representatives 
of the same imi^lemeut of any other country. The single exception to 
the universality of this statement is Scandinavia. Fig. 95 shows the 
flat side of a i)olished stone hatchet at the close of the first stage in 
the manufacture. The object is reduced to its general form, and in this 
stage it has often been mistaken for a Paleolithic implement. Fig. 96 
represents the second stage of manufacture. Here a smaller hammer 
(fig. 28) is used, or possibly a bone tiaker; the chips or flakes removed 
are smaller, and, in the opinion of some archaeologists, were made by

pressure instead of being struck off; the edges of tbe implement are 
made regular, the surface reduced to a level, and the entire object is 
made ready for polishing. 

Another method, different, but similar, was employed with the non- 
chipable materials; that is, hammering or jjecking {marielage). The 
same stone hammer was used, and by repeated strokes in the same 
place the refractory substance is gradually reduced 
by abrasion to the desired form. 

The implement having been reduced, approxi- 
mately, to the desired form by either of the fore- 
going methods, the next step required a grinding or 
polishing stone. These grinding stones are found 
wherever the polished-stone culture existed. They 
are numerous in France and England. The National 
Museum possesses specimens from Massachusetts 
and from Tennessee. Fig. 97, represents one of these 
grinding stones from the bank of the Hiawassee 
Kiver, 15 miles east of Charleston, Polk County, 
Tennessee. It was found by 
Mr. N. G. Baxter, and pre- 
sented by him (through Mr. 
Edward Palmer) to theUnited 
States National Museum in 
1882. It was reduced from a 
much larger piece, believed to 
have been solid, in order to be transported to the 
Museum: its present surface measurement is 22 
by 14 inches. There are three grooves shown, all 
made by the grinding process. The largest and 
princii)al of these is 17 inches long, 5 inches wide, 
and 1^ inches deep, evidently made by rnbbing the 
fiat side of the hatchet thereon. One of the small- 
er grooves is deeper and narrower, and has doubt- 
less served for the corners, edges, or ends of the 
hatchet. This grinding stone was the principal 
object or tool of the prehistoric workshop wherein 
it was f(mnd, for around it were collected no less 
than forty chipi)cd and pecked implements ready 
tobe, or in the process of being, polished. The cliiitpi^l stone implement 
(fig. 96) is laid upon the grinding stone (fig. 97) and rubbed back and forth 
until ground smooth. Water might be used with it, but it should make 
its own sand. Fig. 98 represents the implement partially smoothed, the 
ridges rubbed off, and approaching completion. Fig. 99 represents the 
completed implement, it having been smoothed over its entire surface, 
save possibly some iusigiiiiicant ])laces where the fractures of chipping 
were too deep to be easily ground out.

POLISHED STONE HATCHETS — SCANDINAVIA. 

The polished stone liatcbets from Scandinavia are unique. Many of 
them are diftereat in form and size from those of other countries. They 
are larj;er and smoother, and liave been found in such numbers in the 
various stages of manufacture, showing the method so admirably, and 
arc such fine examples of art work that it would be improper to omit 
them. Plate 30 represents two of these hatchets. They are of the 
Hint belonging to the country. Fig. a represents a hatchet chipped to 
form, scpiare in section, with poll and edge indicated, and show\s the 
process of chipping completed as indicated by fig. 96, while fig. h shows

handle on the hatchet, and this method of handling; has been accepted 
as that employed in prehistoric times. 

These polished stone hatchets have been made with certain art char- 
acteristics locally pecnliar. In Brittany the hatchets of precious stone 
have been made with ])ointed poll and a sharp ridge in the center 
toward the poll. Another peculiarity of the same local- 
ity is a button on the top or poll end of the hatchet. 
The same kind of a button appears on those from 
Guadeloupe and other islands of the West Indies. 
Those from Illinois have the edge broadened, as if in 
imitation of a bronze or coi)per hatchet which has been 
hammered to an edge and thus spread at the edges 
and corners. The same broadening at the edge ap- 
l)ears in some of tlie hatchets from Chiricjui, though 
not to so great an extent as in Illinois. A peculiarity 
of some of the Chiriqui specimens is that, instead of 
being made round, square, or oval in section, they are 
hexagonal. These peculiarities are noticed on account 
of their apparent artistic feeling, and because they 
seem to have had no utilitarian origin. The defer- 
ences in form have been mentioned as peculiarities, 
and so they are, for they do not apply 
to all the liatchets from their locality 
have been fairly within the definition of art, being an 
attempt to decorate an object of utility, to make it more 
pleasing to the eye, and to be art for art's sake. No dec- 
orative designs ever appear on these implements, no in- 
scriptions, and no marks of ownership. 

One must not forget that, despite all these varieties 
of art forms of hatchets, prehistoric man continued to 
make and use this general form of hatchet throughout 
the i^rehistoric world. 

There has been not a little scientific discussion over 
the proposition that civilization travels along the line of 
least resistance; that man in performing sociologic, 
technologic, or industrial operations, does it, or endeav- 
ors to do it, in the easiest way, and with the least possi- 
ble exertion or expenditure of force. This is an at- 
tempted application of a law of physics to a condition 
of sociology. It is undoubtedly a law of physics that 
certain, possibly all, operations of nature are conducted 
along the line of least resistance. The boiler bursts at its weakest 
spot, the chain breaks in its weakest link. All combinations of matter 
are made or accomplished on the line of least resistance. The exist- 
ence of the law must be admitted, but its universality as to natural 
things is no evidence of its application to human affairs. The condi-

tioiis between tliese two, natural aud liuinan, are so different, and there 
is so much dissimilarity, as to invoke different laws. A law of univer- 
sal ai)plication to one may Lave little or no application to the other. 

It may be (^uite true that in attaining- certain results a man may pro- 
ceed along the lines of least resistance — that is to say, he may seek to 
accomplish his purpose with the least exertion or expenditure of force. 
But his wishes and desires interfere many times to deflect his conduct 
from this line. Free will, reason, and judgment are disturbing ele- 
ments in man which, not found in nature, profoundly interfere with the 
operation of this law. They control his actions and deflect his course 
far from the line of the least resistance. Primitive man may have 
desired a knife or point for any one of the many purposes for which 
knives or i^oints are used — to kill or skin his prey, to cut branches, or 
what not. Any sharp or pointed piece of flint, a spawl, would serve 
this i)urpose as well as the more elaborate specimens; yet we have seen 
that hundreds, if not thousands of times primitive man has not been 
content with a mere spawl, however sharp and pointed or effective it 
might be. Its utility alone, however perfect, did not satisfy him. 

It was argued in the early part of this paper, and lias been demon- 
strated by many illustrations, that prehistoric man had an aesthetic 
taste or artistic sense which controlled him equally as did utility. 

The flrst chapter of this paper, v/ith the arts therein elaborated, is 
built on this foundation. The arts of tine flint chipping, of engraving 
on bone, horn, and ivory, were all dependent on the lesthetic desire 
natural in man. The line of the least resistance, that is to say, the 
making of a knife or point with the least expenditure of force, would 
bave prompted man to have used any spawl of flint or point of bone 
which could have been made the easiest, provided it would serve the 
purpose. We have seen that man did not pursue this course; that 
he was not contented with the rude spawl, however sharp, or the 
bone fragment, however pointed. His natural desire for beauty, his 
rt'sthetic taste, his aitistic sense intervened and deflected his course 
from the utilitarian line of least exertion or resistance. 

It will not do to say that the proposition of the accomplishment of 
results with the least exijenditure of force as applied to man is devoid 
of truth or that it has no exceptions. This sweeping declaration would, 
like the swinging pendulum, carry us too far to the opposite side, and 
would be e(pially as untrue as the original projiosition. The truth lies 
midway between the two. Man in many instances seeks to accomplish 
his end with the least possible exi^enditure. Man proceeds in most of 
his utilitarian i)rqjects on the lines of least resistance, and so far as 
utility has aided civilization there might be a foundation for this law. 
liut art, in this regard is opposed to utility, and it deflects civilization 
from the lines of least resistance. 

iSTearly all prehistoric art work would have been avoided if the man 
who made the implements and objects described had proceeded on the 



Report of U. S. National Museum, 1 896.— Wilson. 



Plate 31, 




PREHISTORIC ART. 445 

lines of least resistance and contented liiniself with the thing- whicli was 
cheapest and easiest made, and wonld have served his utilitarian pur- 
pose. Nearly all work done by man for artistic purposes is in opposi- 
tion to this law, for man's desire for beauty, his a'sthetic taste, his 
artistic sense, induce him to expend an intinite amoujit of labor in the 
production of an implement which would have been of equal utility 
without it. Tlie fine flint chii)ping and the engraving on bone have 
been mentioned. The decorations, the great number of which are set 
forth in plates 13, 14, 15, 19, and 1*0, were not utilitarian. They were, 
so far as utility was concerned, a useless expenditure of force, without 
value, and in defiance of the law invoked. 

This statement applies with equal force to many other prehistoric art 
works. Pottery and bronze objects were almost universally decorated 
without regard to utility, and only to gratify the ;esthetic taste. The 
jade implements, the polished stone hatchets, the entire list of forma 
cnriosa, in fact all the "art for art's sake," and the labor expended 
to gratify the esthetic taste of man and to satisfy his innate desire for 
beauty, were in defiance of this rule. 

The foregoing argument can be upheld by many specimens, but its 
truth is demonstrated by the implement shown in plate 31, and its 
consideration in connection with the frontispiece. 

The arrow- and spear-head were the standard primitive projectile 
weapons. The ax or hatchet was the standard ijrimitive cutting imple- 
ment, performing its function V)y blows. The Paleolithic implements 
corresponding to these were made usually of flint and solely by chip- 
ping. In the ]S'eolithic period the hatchets, while chipped or pecked 
into shape, were smoothed or polished by friction on a grinding or pol- 
ishing stone. The various steps of the process are shown in figs. 93 to 
99. These or similar implements have been found throughout the 
world, wherever it was occupied by Keolithic man. -Their method of 
use is shown in the frontispiece, where the original handle was found 
with the hatchet inserted and ready for use. The discoveries of these 
handles are rare, owing i)robably to the ease of their decomposition and 
destruction, but they have been found in every country associated with 
the hatchet in such a way as to identify their use in this manner. It 
has therefore been decided that the primitive man thus used them, and 
that practically all of the numberless polished stone hatchets found 
throughout the world have each one had their handle similar to that 
in the frontisi^iece. The specimen shown in i)late 31, while the same 
implement as that in the frontispiece, differs from it in that it has 
a stone handle and has been worked out of the solid. Whether it was 
a i)iece of rock from a ledge or a water- worn bowlder, we have now no 
means of determining, for the original surface has been removed in 
the process of manufacture. It is hard stone, probably diorite; the 
material is highly refractory and does not chip or flake as does flint. 
It could never have been reduced ev^en approximately to its present 



446 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

form by chipping, as was frequently done with similar implements, 
especially with Hint, and of which plate 30 furnishes an excellent illus- 
tration. The implement (in plate 31) was reduced to shape by grind- 
ing or rubbing and not by chipping. The grinding of an object of this 
size from its original condition of bowlder or ledge rock into the 
symmetrical weapon here shown must have required immense labor. 
This work would be long, arduous, tedious, and difficult, and would 
require of the workman great tenacity of purpose and fearlessness 
of fatigue. We have no means of knowing the difference between 
the amount of labor required to make the implement in plate 31 and 
that shown in the frontispiece, but it may be surmised, for the purpose 
of argument, that the same amount of exertion, time, and labor ex- 
pended on the latter would have made a hundred of the first. Yet the 
implement thus laboriously made is, for all utilitarian purposes, no 
better than any one of the hundred which could have been made in the 
same time. Indeed, it is hardly so- good, for, being of stone, it is heavier 
and, as the blade can not be taken out of the handle, it is more unwieldy 
and troublesome to carry. The only reason apparent that impelled 
j)rimitive man to make this imxdement with an expenditure of so much 
more force than would have been required for the commoner specimen, 
was the gratification of his a-sthetic taste. In order to gratify it, he 
was willing to expend this extra force. This implement is, therefore, an 
illustration of what is found to be true in thousands of other objects — 
that their makers were willing to endure fatigue and labor long con- 
tinued, in order to gratify their desire for the beautiful. And in pro- 
portion as this is true, so did he not proceed along the lines of least 
resistance, but rather in defiance of the rule. 

Drilling in Stone. 

This was oub of the arts of prehistoric man during the Neolithic 
l)eriod. It was continued into tlie Bronze age and thence down to 
historic times. It is so difficult in performance, and yet was so suc- 
cessfully performed, as to entitle it to a place among the fine arts. 
Ordinary drilling performed in a common or clumsy manner might not 
be entitled to such mention, and the art obtains the right to be classed 
as fine, only from the number of wonderful specimens Avhich have 
been found, the difficulty incident to the performance, and the success 
attending it. Scores of examples can be given from both Europe and 
America in which the drilling shown is at once delicate and difficult. 
In America the prehistoric man desiring to make an ax made a groove 
around it and handled it by a withe. His European brother of the 
same i)eriod drilled a hole in his ax and inserted a handle after the 
fashion of the sledge. He appeared, in both hemisi>heres, to be master 
of the art of drilling, for, contrary to the way of the white man, he 
made the implement perfect and complete, even to its smoothing and 
polishing, before he began to drill the hole. As said in the chapter on 



PREHISTORIC ART. 447 

fliut chipping, he seems to have been able to toy with his art and per- 
form it in any A\ray he pleased. He drilled large holes and small, he 
used hard drills and soft, the latter even of pine wood. He used hol- 
ow drills as well as solid, and we have cores that have been drilled 
from one or both sides with a straightness and evenness that seems 
marvelous. He was able to start his drill on the smooth and polished 
surface of a hard stone, apparently without any wobbling of the drill, 
leaving the edge of the hole as smooth and sharp as though it had 
been afterwards reamed or turned. The prehistoric objects found in 
the mounds of the United States are of even finer workmanship and 
more artistic than is usual in Europe. 

Pipes, tubes, etc. — These objects, sometimes of hard stone, are drilled 
in a remarkable manner, which, when considered as the work of a 
savage, done without metal tools, excites our wonder and admiration. 
The pipes have been drilled in several directions and at difl'erent 
angles. 

Plate 74 (in the chapter on musical instruments) represents divers 
stone tubes supposed to have been used as trumpets or horns, but 
they will serve as illustrations of the art of drilling. A certain 
number display this art in a high degree. The long cylindrical tubes 
do not show to the casual observer their real value as representa- 
tives of this art. Although only about 1 inch in diameter and of 
length varying from 6 to 12 or 14 inches, they have been drilled their 
entire length with a hole more than one-half their diameter, and all 
from one end — that is to say, the drilling of this large hole has been 
begun at one end of the finished tube and continued until nearlj^ 
through at the other end, when the drilling (of the large hole) was 
stopped, the tube reversed, and drilled from the other end with a small 
hole which met the large one. The evidence of this manipulation is 
abundant, and is here treated as a fine art because of the manual dex- 
terity required to drill accurately and continuously a large hole through 
so small a cylinder for such a distance without break or change of 
direction. 

It is not intended to pursue the subject of drilling in this paper, 
only to call attention to its existence as a" fine art and to note the deli- 
cacy and difiiculty in some of the oi)erations as shown by the specimens. 
The reader who is desirous of pursuing the subject further is referred 
to the paper on this subject by Mr. J. D, McGuire, published in the 
report of the United States National Museum for 1894. Many of the 
specimens described by Mr. McGuire are from the Division of Prehis- 
toric Archaeology. 

Ceremonial Objects. 

Many ceremonial objects show fine execution in the way of stone 
drilling, and the subject will be continued incidentally during their 
descri|)tiou. 

There were a large series of objects in use among the aborigines of

North America, the purpose of -which is unknown, which, for want of 
a better name aud in accordance with a supposed use or function, have 
been called " Ceremonial objects." Any description of or argument 
concerning their ])0S8il)le use would be part of the history of the civili- 
zation of the times and belongs to 
technology, or to industrial, but not 
fine art. They have been pecked or 
battered into general, then ground 
into particular form, then polished, 
and lastly drilled. The correctness 
of their forms, their symmetry, their 
smoothness of surface and ])erfection 
of detail, together with the supi)osi- 
tiou of their ornamental and not util- 
itarian function, causes them to be 
classed among objects of tine art. 

Banner stones. — This name has 
been given empirically and only for 
want of a better. Fig. 100 repre- 
sents one of these implements, half 
size. It was found near Dubuque, 
Iowa, by Mr. H. T. Woodman, is of ferruginous quartz, translucent, 
reddish color passing over to white, within one or two degrees of being 
as hard as the diamond. Despite all its rounded corners and smoothed 
edges it will scratch glass without difHculty. It has been hammered or 
pecked, ground, polished and drilled, and its entire surface made 
smooth as glass. It is 
symmetric viewed from 
either side or edge. The 
amount of skilled labor 
required to reduce it to 
its present elegant ap- 
pearance, the difficulties 
in accomplishing this, all 
of which was only to pro- 
duce an ornament, jus- 
tifies its classification 
among objects of tine 
art. Fig. 101 rejjresents 
another specimen of the 
same kind. It has been 
finished in the manner 
just described, and it is submitted with the same idea. It was found 
in Prince George County, Maryland, and was contributed by Dr. 
E. E. Reynolds. 

Fig. 102 represents another banner stone of the same general style, 
introduced because of its beauty and the fineness of its manufacture.

The thinness of the blade as well as of the barrel or center, with the size 
of the hole, leaving the walls so thin and frail, are all to be remarked 
as evidence of the mechanical skill and manual dexterity of the abo- 
rigines. Fig. 103 is an implement w hich may or may not be one of the 
banner stones, bnt it is evidently related thereto. It might pass for a 
hatchet or double-bitted ax, the hole being drilled in the center as for 
a handle, but this use is 
negatived by the fragil- 
ity and softness of the 
material, which is band- 
ed slate. The entire sur- 
face is highly polished 
and the outlines are true 
and correct. The edge 
is as sharp as the mater- 
ial will make. The hole, 
however, is quite too 
small for a handle by 
which the implement 
could be used as an ax. 
A single blow would destroy it, breaking both its edge and the hole. 
A ceremonial use is the only one suggested for these and similar imple- 
ments. Fig. 104 was received from Peale's Museum, Philadeljjhia, and 
was originally from near Norristown, Pennsylvania. It is of slate, and 
has been worked up to its present perfected state by the operations 

already describ-

objects in the United States National Museum. In the one object these 
notches have been cut at right angles on the edge, while on the other

tliey have oeen cut on only one side of the edge. The purpose of these 
notches is entirely unknown; they might have been utilitarian or orna- 
mental, but in our i^resent state of knowledge no one is justified in 
saying which. They are submitted as possible ornamentation. The 
third specimen represents one of these objects in which the drilling has 
just been completed, when the object split longitudinally. It is pre- 
sented to show ^.he drilling with all its interior ridges before being 
smoothed, and one may see by the failure to complete the hole how the 

drilling had all 
been done from 
one end. 

Bird-shaped ob- 
jects. — Fig. 105 is 
from western New 
York. It is made 
in the form of a 
bird, which from 
the number of 
similar specimens 
have given the 
nameto this class. 
The eyes are rep- 
resented by great 
protnberances 
which must have 
greatly increased 

the difficulty of manufacture. It was made from a bowlder or large 
jiiece, and while the material is hard, it is not tough but rather fragile. 
It could not be chipped like flint nor whittled like soapstone, but must 
have been hammered or pecked into shape and afterwards ground to 
its present form, then polished until it is as smooth as glass. A con- 
sideration of the conditions demonstrates the difficulty of making this 
object and the dexterity and experienced working required. The 
United States National Museum possesses many of these specimens. 
While they bear a greater resemblance to birds than anything else, 
yet scarcely any two of them are alike, and they change in form 
through the whole gamut until it is difficult to determine whether it is 
a bird, a lizard, or a turtle, and finally the series ends in a straight bar 
without pretense of representing any animal. 

Boatsliaped objects. — Fig. lOG represents a boat-shaped object, so 
called for the same reason that others were called bird shaped — because 
it was nearer that than anything else. There is an extensive series of 
these, from those closely resembling a boat and elaborately and care- 
fully made to those of the rudest form. They, like all the others, have 
been brought to the general form by hammering or ])ecking and theu 
grinding and polishing. Their purpose, also like the others, is unknown.

The forms of this imi)leraent are varied. Fig. 107 represents one of 
these objects apparently at the other end of the series, wliile there are 
others of intermediate form. This one is flat, thin, not hollowed out, 
is narrowed in the middle and widened at the ends, and has its two 
holes drilled close together. Many of these objects are of hard stone, 
like syenite, greenstone, etc., while a limited number are of galena. 
Their general purpose seems to have been as an ornament of some 
kind, Avhicli, with their symmetry, execution, iinish, and the difficulty 
in accomplisliing all these, entitles them to be classed among objects 
of line art.

particularly beautiful Avhen made. Others, however, either from their 
material or otherwise, become more difficult and have certain orna- 
mentation, and should not be omitted from among decorative art 
objects. The difference between the gorget and pendant seems only 
to have been in the number and position of the holes. A gorget might

unless very small, could scarcely be, though both may have been sus-

either on the arm or the breast. No. (i2578, U.S.N.M.^ is of soap- 
stone, and from Tennessee. A third (No. 97423, 
U.S.N.M.) is of red Jasper from east Tennessee. 
The other two are of slate and show their respec- 
tive decorations. The sixth specimen of hematite, 
though classed as a i)endant, the justilication for 
which is the little groove aronna the small end 
apparently intended for a string or cord by which 
it was suspended, belongs to a class distinct from 
the others. They are always round, are sym- 
metrical, and with all their hardness are made 
smooth and usually well polished. They have 
been classed as plummets and charms, as well as 
pendants. Occasional specimens have a hole 
drilled throngh the small end instead of the 
groove, while others have the lower end made 
the same as the upper, also grooved or drilled. 
Archicologists are far from being agreed as to the 
use of these implements, the disagreement being- 
indicated by the different names given to them, 
bnt all will agree as to the beauty of the speci- 
mens and the propriety of classing them as works 
of art. 

Fig. 108 from Norwich, Connecticnt, is of green- 
ish gray trap rock, with convex edges. It has 
one hole drilled near the end as though for suspension from the neck 
and to be worn on the breast. It has been gi-ound and sinoot ;cd all 
over and is decorated on one side and around the edge by a row of 
extremely small dots with zigzags of the same.

manufacture, together with their use as a means of pleasure, if not 
of ornament, it is not improper to assign them a pUice here. The 
United States Xational Museum possesses an extensive series which, 
for some unexphiined reason, extends into alniost every imaginable 
disk form. Fig. 110 represents a side and sectional view of one of 
these objects of yellowish brown quartzite. It is drawn half size, and is 
a large and weighty object. Most of the large speciiuens are of quartz, 
either yellow or white. They are disk form, the edges are rounded, 
ihe center on both sides has been cut out and made cup-shaped. He 
who could make this object, accomplishing all these requirements from

as in all foregoing objects, the work was done by hand, and only with 
the usual tools for hammering, pecking, grinding, smoothing, and 
polishing. It has been suggested that these may have been made with 
the lathe, but an investigation shows this not to have been so. 

Beads. — Beads of jasper are not infrequently drilled, and the United 
States Xational Museum possesses some jasper pieces of extraordinary 
length — for example, 3 inches — less than f inch in diameter, and a hole 
half the thickness of the bead drilled through its entire length. This 
hole is put exactly through the center of the cylinder, without apparent 
enlargement or smoothing, as though it had been drilled from one end 
only, but whether done this way or drilled from both ends the delicacy 
of the work and the precision with which it was done, when remem- 
bered to have been the work of a savage, is marvelous.

Lapidary Work, 
jade and hard stone objeots. 

There are many specimens classed as polished stone hatchets, because 
of the similarity of form, material, mode of manufacture, and use; and 
yet, because of their rude character aud rough ai)pearance, they are 
not works of art. But some of these implements of hard and semi- 
])recious stones, from purity of form, difticulty of fabrication, and their 
fine and beautiful finish, may be justly classed as works of art. These 
arc mostly ])olished hatchets of some of the varieties of Jade. Plate 
34 rei)resents a series of these magnificent implements from various 
prehistoric stations in western Europe. 

Jade is remarkably hard and tough. The latter quality is said to be 
produced by the arrangement of its fibers in small interlaced bundles. 
It is and always has been regarded in China and the oriental countries 
as one of the precious stones, its hardness and the difficnlty of working 
having conspired to greatly enhance its reputation. Except a single 
piece only partially determined, lately found in Austria, none of the 
raw material has ever been discovered in western Europe, yet prehis- 
toric implements of this material have been found throughout western 
Europe amounting to many thousands. Lake Constance, Switzerland, 
alone having furnished 2,000 specimens. This material and its use in 
prehistoric times opens many abstruse questions concerning migrations 
of primitive peoples and of the possible extent of their commerce. 
The most of these implements found in the Swiss lake dwellings are 
of jadeite, of which the component parts are: Silica, 58 to 60 per cent; 
aluminum, 22 to 26 per cent; soda, 10 to 12 per cent; with a specific 
gravity of 3 to 3.3. It is extremely hard, ranking 8 or 9 in the scale of 
which the diamond is 10. 

The same material is found manufactured into implements of the most 
elaborate and difficult kind in great profusion in Mexico aud Central 
America. Plate 35 shows specimens thereof. These are all in the 
United States National Museum. Their locality, appearance, or use 
need not be described; it will be sufficient to say that they belong to 
the prehistoric period in IMexico and Central America. 

Fibrolite, still another variety of jade, is confined to southern and 
western France. It is composed of : Silica, 34 or 35 per cent; aluminum, 
63 to 65 per cent; with a specific gravity of 3.2 to 3.3, 

Actinolite, still another variety, is composed of: Silica, 0.60; magne- 
sia, 0.21; lime, 0.14 per cent; with a specific gravity of from 3 to 3.1. 
Its distribution is throughout the Pueblo country of Arizona and Xew 
Mexico. The specimens shown in plate 36 are these actinolite grooved 
axes and hammers from that locality, and belong to the National 
Museum. 

Nephrite is still another specimen of jade, the component parts of 
which :e: Silica, 56 to 5S per cent; magnesia, 20 to 22 i^er cent; lime, 



456 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

11 to 14 per cent; oxide of iron, 5 to 8 per cent, and aluminum, 1 to 3 
per cent; with specific gravity 2.9 to 3. 

A profusion of prehistoric implements, principally axes or adzes made 
of nei^lirite, have been found from the Straits of Fuca northward along 
the entire coast of British Columbia and the northern end of Alaska. 
(Plate 37.) 

Pectolite is comjoosed of: Silica, 51; lime, 33; soda, 9 per cent; with 
a specific iiravity of 2.7 to 2.9. It is found among the Eskimos and 
the Indians on the northwest coast of jSTorth America. Its principal 
service is as a hammer, for wliicli use it is pici)ared with a withe 
and lashed to a wooden handle (Plate 37), and as an evidence of the 
almost universal art instinct of prehistoric man, this hammer, which 
might have been only a rough stone in every part except its face, has, 
despite its hardness and the difficulty and tediousness of the work, 
been pecked or hammered into a symmetrical form and then ground or 
polished to a smooth and regular surface, as though this were required 
for utility. 

The finding of two partly worked bowlders of nephrite on the lower 
part of the Fraser Iliver, at Lytton and Yale, British Columbia, resi)ec- 
tively, and the discovery of unfinished objects in old Indian graves 
near Lytton, make it certain that the manufacture of adzes had been 
carried on there. 

A series of specimens, numbering sixty-one in all, have been deposited 
in the Museum of the Geological Survey, at Ottawa, and in the Kedpath 
Museum, McGill College, Montreal. These consist of both nephrite 
and pectolite imi)lements, as adzes, drills, axes, etc. Of the sixty one 
objects found, seventeen show that tb^y have been sawed from other 
pieces. A prolific source of supply of this mineral in primitive times, 
now known as Jade Mountain, is situated about 150 miles above the 
mouth of the Kowak River, in Alaska. The world is indebted for 
the discovery of this mountain to Lieut. G. M. Stoney, United States 
Navy, who has brought down, and presented to the United States 
National Museum, quite a number of specimens. Plate 38 represents 
sundry of the pieces, some water- worn bowlders and fractured frag- 
ments of the material, accompanied by two or three manufactured 
specimens. This is the only known source of supply of this mineral 
in America. 

Mif/ration. — When implements are found which, upon analysis, con- 
tain the foregoing component parts and are determined to be of this 
mineral, it raises a fair presumption that they came from this source of 
supply, and is presumptive evidence of prehistoric communication, if 
not migration, between the peoples. This is true only to a certain point, 
and is not susceptible of universal application. It does not follow that 
all nephrite objects came from Jade Mountain. 

Jadeite is an entirely different mineral from nephrite or any of the 
varieties of jade, and must, or at least may, have had a different place 
of origin and come from a different direction.

PREHISTORIC ART. 457 

Prof. F. W. Putnam jjiesc'iited before the American Antiquarian 
Society in 1880, from the Museum at Cambridge, a series of carved and 
sawed objects in jade from Mexico and Central America, and his theory 
of accounting for them was that they had been brought from Asia on 
the original migration of the peoples; that in after time the communi- 
cations between the two countries were suspended and gradually 
ceased. Thus the supply of these objects was cut off, as none of that 
mineral having been found in that country (either then or since). 
They came to be regarded of great value as amulets or charms, and 
were sawed into pieces for a more extended distribution. That such 
objects belonged to these countries, and that they were divided or cut 
by sawing and were susceptible of a coriespondingly increased dis- 
tribution is a fact that can not be denied. The United States iSTational 
Museum possesses series of such objects in considerable numbers. 
Plates 39 and 40 represent a tray of them, showing obverse and reverse- 
The two plates represent opposite sides of the same objects. They 
will be noticed further when considering lapidary work. 

Ur. Heinrich Fischer, of Freiburg, Baden, supported the migration 
theory, alleging the great similarity between the Mexican and Central 
American jadeites and those in Burmah. Dr. A. B. Meyer, of Dresden, 
attacked the migration theory fiercely and maintained the greater 
probability of the indigenous character of the mineral. Professors 
Clarke and Merrill, of the United States National Museum, published 
a paper ^ on "Kephrite and Jadeite." It consisted largely of chemical 
and microscopical investigations and determined with great certainty 
the substantial differences between the minerals. Their conclusions, 
so far as relates to the migration theory, are as follows: 

That these substauces are comparatively common constituents of metamorpbic 
rocks, and hence liable to be found anywhere where these rocks occur. Their pres- 
ence (in any given place) is as meaningless (so far as concerns the migration theory) 
as would be the finding of a piece of graphite. Their discovery (among prehistoric 
peoples) possesses no value in the work of tracing the migration or intercommunica- 
tion of lai es. 

It is not ijossible to determine this jade question positively or abso- 
lutely. We do not possess sufficient knowledge to solve it finally. 
Whatever may be at j^resent determined is subject to a reversal by a 
discovery which may be made at any time in the future. If a jadeite 
mountain should be found in Mexico or Central America as a nephrite 
mountain has been in Alaska, it would settle the question at once, but 
until a ledge or quarry of jadeite shall be found in America the ques- 
tion must be left in abeyance. The discovery of the place of origin of 
jadeite in America may never be found, and consequently the question 
may never be absolutely solved. 

Various efforts have been made to discover jadeite in its natural 
deposit in Mexico and Central America, but never yet with success.

458 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

The latest effort was that made by Mr. A. Sjogren, a learned Scandina- 
vian geologist interested iu prehistoric authropolgy, acquainted with 
the imi)oitance of the "jade question," and always on the lookout for 
any evidence that would sheti light tliereon. He resided for a time in 
Costa Eica, with full opportunity for the investigation of and acquaint- 
ance with the jadeite objects in that country. During his visit there 
he made more or less extensive searches for the evidence of indigenous 
jade. He found a number of pebbles the appearance of which sug- 
gested that they might be the desired material. Ou his return to his 
native country he stopped at Washington, and, visiting the United 
States I^ational Museum, he invoked the aid of Professor Merrill, 
Curator of Geology and Mineralogy, and the author, as Curator of 
Prehistoric Anthropology, who opened the cases in his department and 
produced implements from Costa liica and the neighboring countries 
for comparison with the specimens trought by Mr. Sjogren. The 
result was that eight specimens of pebbles were selected as having the 
greatest similarity with the material of the jade implements, and it was 
proposed to put them to test of microscopic investigation. Professor 
Merrill accordingly made thin sections of these for that purpose, and 
has just reported the result of his investigations. He says: 

Nos. 1, 3, and 8 are without doubt an altered pumiceous tuffa, identical with No. 
59899, described by Professor Clarke and myself iu our paper iu Proceedings of the 
United States National Museum, Vol. xi, page 127. 

This specimen (No. 59899, U.S.N.M.) was from San Huacas, Costa 
Rica, dark green, not mottled, soft, specific gravity 2.282, and its com- 
position as follows : 

Ignition 10.39 

Silica 70.49 

Alumina 11. 39 

Ferrous oxide 2. 39 

Manganous oxide .Trace. 

Lime 3. 83 

Magnesia 57 

Alkalies Undetermined. 

Total 99.06 

A microscopic examination shows that the mineral is evidently a highly altered 
volcanic tuff, but very difficult to make out. The mass of the rock is made up of a 
greenish-gray amphorous felt, through which are scattered round buuches of a 
bright-green chlorite and small, colorless points and elongated crystals, which may 
be felspathic, although they are too small to show twin striie. There are also occa- 
sional colorless elongated and curved shreds, which are wholly without action in 
pohirized light, and which are doubtless glass. 

He continues as to the Sjogren specimens: 

Nos. 2, 4, 5, and 7 are highly siliceous rocks of rather obscure nature, but consisting 
largely of chnlcedouic silica, and if not true chalcedonic secretions, are at least 
very compact Iragmental rocks that have been acted upon by silica-bearing solu- 
tions. No. 7 shows occasional niiuuto circular areas with concentric structure,

which are doubtless silicilied leraains of foraininifera, such as are uot infrequent in 
siliceons nodules fonud in limestone. There is nothing in the series in the least 
resembling true nephrite or jadeite. 

The concliidiug seuteuce leaves the discovery of the origiu of jade 
material, of which the Costa Rica prehistoric imi)leii]eiits were made, 
as much an unsolved problem as ever. But negative results from the 
searches of an experienced geologist made on tlie spot are of more 
value than has been generally admitted, and the thanks of i)rehistoric 
anthropologists are due to Mr. Sjogren for his interest and ettbrts. It 
is certainly remarkable that, with the thousands of prehistoric imple- 
ments from Mexico and Central America, no specimens of the natural 
material has ever been found in any of those countries. 

There are other views which seem to narrow the question of jade 
migration, if they do not elucidate it. It would appear highly imi)roba 
ble that any such migration of peoples could have been made by land 
between the place of origiu in Burmah and the place of its discovery 
in Mexico and Central America. We can scarcely conceive of a 
migration, comprised of however great or small numbers, which would 
start from Burmah overland by way of Bering Straits for Mexico 
and Central America, carrying with them such small implements 
and in such great numbers. If they did, these implements would 
run great risks of being lost. Arrived in Alaska, the emigrants ought 
to have found some traces or specimens of the nephrite, wrought or 
unwrought, of which we now find so many. One or two hypotheses 
force themselves upon us: The emigrants (from Burmah) might have 
left some of their own jadeite implements in Alaska or obtained some 
of the nephrite. No traces have been found of either. Theu these 
emigrants would have started on their southwestern trip, a distance of 
several thousand miles, to Mexico, without leaving anywhere any trace 
of jadeite implements. Arrived at Mexico, and thence on through Cen- 
tral America, are to be found implements, all of jadeite, by the thousand, 
but none of nephrite. If these emigrants traveled by land from 
Burmah to Mexico, crossing at Bering Straits, it would involve a long 
and necessarily tedious journey. In Alaska these emigrants would 
enter a country where there was a mountain of this precious mineral, 
the prehistoric inhabitants of which well knew how to make it into 
implements. No other imidements or objects, of this or similar mate- 
rial, have been found along the indicated route which would serve as 
extraneous evidence of such migration. 

The foregoing argument seems satisfactory to the author against a 
migration of jade or jade implements by land from Burmah to Mexico or 
Central America. This leaves only the ocean as a means of migration, 
and that such a journey should have been voluntarily made across such 
an ocean seems almost incredible. It would appear, in view of the diffi- 
culties and obstacles to such journeys or migrations, either by land or 
sea, that the only course left to deal with the jade question is to await 
further developments and discoveries. 



460 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

It is not inteuded in tliis paper to pursue the question of jade from 
a niineralogic or an arch;eologic point of view. Anyone desiring- to do 
so is referred to the works of Professors Meyer, of Dresden; Fischer, 
of Freiburg; Damour, of Paris; "Nephrite and Jadeite," by Profes- 
sors Clarke and Merrill;' "The Occurrence of Jade in British Colum- 
bia,"' by Ur. Dawson, and to "Gems and Precious Stones,"' by Mr. 
George F. Kunz, it being the intention of the author to confine his 
discussion to the art side of the question; and from this side he refers 
with approbation to the forthcoming edition de luxe of the volume on 
jade by Mr. H. 11. Bishop, of New York City. 

Mr. Kunz, the gem expert with Tiffany & Co., in his work, "Gems 
and Precious Stones,"^ speaks of the ancient lapidary work as follows: 

Tbe chipping of an arrow point, tlie grinding and polishing of a groove in an ax 
head, tlie drilling of a bead or tube or an ear ornament, all are done by the applica- 
tion of the same lapidarian methods that are prarticed to-day by cutters of agates 
or precious stones. The cutter of to-day, with a hammer, chips into shape the crys- 
tal or piece of agate before it is ground; and there is little difference between the 
ancient method of drilling and that of the present. The stone bead of ancient time 
was drilled from both ends, the drill holes often overlapping or not meeting as neatly 
as by the modern method of drilling from one end. 

The old way of drilling is still practiced in the east, where the primitive bow drill 
is used by lapidaries to day precisely as it has been used by savage tribes in all 
quarters of the globe, though producing at different periods different (jualities of 
work. Nowhere was its use better uiiderstood than in ancient Greece and Rome, 
where, by its means, were engraved the wonderful intaglio and cameos which now 
grace our museuuis, and which have never been surpassed in any period of the world's 
history. For the special use of gem engraving, the bow drill has been replaced by 
a horizontal lathe, which, however, does not allow the freedom of touch or deftness 
of feeling which artists attained by use of the bow drill. The instrument known as 
the dental drill is really an luiproved form of bow drill, working much more rapidly. 
An S. S. White dental engine, provided with a suitable series of drill points, auswers 
every purpose, aud has been found especially useful in exposing fossils and minerals 
when covered with I'ock, the objects being opened with great rapidity, with little 
danger of injury. . As shown by the author in a paper on a new method of engraving 
cameos aud intaglios,"' an artist could be so trained to the use of this improved bow 
drill as to attain the same softness and feeling developed by the old lapidarian 
masters. 

In the ancient specimens of work, tubes from which a core has been drilled out by 
means of a reed and sand, revolved by the hand, were done as neatly as anything 
can be done, the reason being that the object was entirely drilled from end to end. 
This method of drilling is still practiced, except that the hollow reed is replaced 
by the diamond or steel drill. When a valuable stone is being drilled, a sheet of 
steel or thin iron tube is substituted for it. The polishing and grinding now is 
done on rapidly revolving disks, horizontal or lay wheels, as they are called, whereas 
formerlj the slow j)rocess of rubbing with the band or board or leather was perhaps 
resorted to. No lapidary can do finer work than that shown by the obsidian objects

from Mexico (see illustration), the labrets/ ear ornameuts, and tubes,- wliich are 
even more highly polished, though no portion of the latter is thicker than one- 
thirty-second of an inch. An obsidian cojofce head^ in the Blake collection in the 
United States National Museum is a beautiful ornauu-ut, highly polished, and bored 
throughout the lower part. The spear points and hoes from East St. Louis and 
other parts of Missouri and Illinois, and beautiful sacrilicial knives — notably the 
immense knife,^ 18 inches in length, in the Blake collection of the United States 
Natuiual Museum, and the one in the Ethnological Museum at the Trocadero in 
Paris — show the greatest skill in chii>ping. 

Many of the aboriginal stone objects found in North America and elsewhere are 
marvels of lapidarian skill in chipping, drilling, grinding, and jiolishing. Few lap- 
idaries could duplicate the arrow points of obsidian from New Mexico, or those of 
jasper, agate, agatized wood, and other minerals found along the Willamette River, 
Oregon. No lapidary could drill a hard stone object truer than some of the banner 
stoues,^ tubes, and other objects made of quartz, greenstone, and granite that 
have been found in North Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee, or make anything 
more graceful in form and general outline than are some of the quartz discoidal 
stones'' found m these same States. These latter objects are often 4 to 6 inches, 
antl occasionally 7 inches, in diameter, ground in the center until they are of the 
thinness of paper and almost transparent, and the great regularity of the two sides 
would almost suggest that they had l)een turned in tbe lathe. This may have been 
accomplished by mounting a log in the side of a tree so that it would revolve, and 
ceineuting the stones with pitch to the end of the log, as a lapidary would do to-day 
at Obersteiu, Germany, or by allowing the shalt of the lathe to protrude through 
the side of the log, and cementing the stone to be turned on this. The Egyptian 
wood turner at work in the Rue de Caire, at the World's Fair, Paris, 1889, might, 
with his lathe, polish a large ornament of jade or jadeite, like the masks, idols, tab- 
lets, and other objects found in Mexico and Central America, or the jade knives from 
Alaska, in the United States National Museum. 

Jadeite masls. — Eeturning to the discussion of lapidary art as mani- 
lested ill the working of hard stone, plate 41 shows examples of differ- 
ent materials, form, uses, and localities, though all from Mexico or 
Central America; some specimens are obsidian, and no distinction is 
maintained as to the material of the others. 

Fig. Ill is a mask of jadeite from an Aztec (?) grave in Mexico. It 
represents a crying baby. It belougs to Mr. Charles Storrs, of Brooklyn, 
and was exhibited at the meeting of the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science in 1879, by Mrs. Ermiunie A. Smith. It is 
reported as having a specific gravity of 3.3; which, with its hardness, 
determines it to be jadeite. Remarking upon its art, we first see hoM- it 
has been wrought by drilling and other methods of abrasion into, not 
simply a representation of the human face, but that it has its peculiar 
expression. The eyes are closed, the brows are drawn down, the nose 
and upper lip are drawn up, deep furrows are in the cheeks under the 
eyes and by the side of the nose, the contour is regular, the profile is cor- 
rect and true, and besides all this, every portion of the face has been not 
only smoothed, but finely polished, the depths and sides of the furrows 
and around the eyes equally well with that of the prominent parts like 
the cheeks and forehead. Suggestions are made as to how some of this

was accomplished, for example, at the corners of tlie mouth, where the 
depressions were made by drilling", although the drill marks have been 
polished out. One is able to speak of this drilling operation with a 
certainty that becomes absolute, from finding it represented in a score 
of otlier specimens, wherein the corners of the eyes and mouth have 
been drilled, some with a solid, others with a hollow drill, the latter 
showing the protuberance of the core. Specimens have been found 
where such drilling had been utilized for the insertion of precious or 
colored stones. The unscientific reader will appreciate the beauty of 
this specimen as well as the difficulties to be overcome, when it is 
stated that with this and many others of the specimeus herein men-

cut the glass in the cases which contain them with apparently as much 
ease as does the glazier with his diamond. In fact, the material stands 
next in hardness after the diamond. It is 9 in the scale of which the 
diamond is 10. These remarks in regard to hardness, drilling, and pol- 
ishing apply to many of the specimens shown in plates 39, 40 and 41.

abrasion, a piece of obsidian or 
some other hard stone with the 
necessary angles and corners having probably 
served as a hammer. It is introduced here more 
as showing the method of procedure than as an

pleted. It represents a human figure seated; has 
been Avorked out to show all the members, and has 
then been polished as smooth as glass. Fig. 116 is 
the small head of a coyote or some similar animal. 
It is worked out in the same way as fig. 115, and is 
finely i)olished. Fig. 117 is still another object 
of obsidian from Mexico, representing a labret, a 
small hat-shaped instrument used as a lip orna- 
ment common to certain primitive peoples — the 
Alaskans and the Botocudos. Fig. 118 represents a small ring or 
band of translucent obsidian in the form of a cylinder with hori- 
zontally projecting rims. There are other similar specimens in the 
United States National Museum. Their nse is unknown, but they

were probably ornaments. Their peculiar relation to lapidary art 
consists of the fine workmanship required to reduce them to their 
extreme thinness. They are only slightly thicker than an eggshell. 
This specimen is only one out of a series showing the extreme delicacy 
of the lapidary art with which they were made. Some of them are in 
the form of cylinders I inch in diameter, IJ inches in length, the hole 
drilled and enlarged until the body is not more 
than sV inch, so thin as to appear almost unable 
to sustain itself. 

PaUi-patu. — An interesting series of jade ob- 
jects the manufacture of which bears an intimate 
relation to lapidary art and about which there has 
been some discussion is the war club with various 
names according- to the following localities : Tatu- 
patu, or merai, in New Zealand 5 macana in Mex- 
ico, and slubbets in Puget Sound and Alaska. 
They have been made of various materials — hard 
wood, w^halebone, copper, or bronze — but that 
which most concerns us here is the fact that they 
were many times made of some of the species of 
jade or other hard stone. 
The greatest number of 
these implements are from 
New Zealand, Avhere they are made principally 
of jade or some of its varieties or of some other 
hard stone; yet similar imj)lements, also of hard 
stone have been found in Mexico and in the 
western United States. The United States Na- 
tional Museum possesses a specimen, reported 
as having been dug from a 
mound by Capt. J. B. Al- 
drich in 180G. The mound "'"'"'"^• 

was situated just south of the Arkansas Eiver, 
near the thirty-eighth ijarallel, in Bent County, 
southeast Colorado. Although the report as to 
the finding of this specimen in Colorado was well 
authenticated, yet it seemed hardly sufficient to 
overcome the supi)osed universal testimony that 
these peculiar implements belonged to New Zea- 
land. It was believed to be more likely that an 
error had been made in the report or in the identity of the implement 
than that an object common to New Zealand should have been unearthed 
in a mound in Colorado. But further examination puts a different 
l)liase upon the affair. Mr. James Wickershnm, in a paper entitled 
"An aboriginal war club," published' in 1895, reports the discovery of

g-eonietric designs, and rei)reseutatioiis of living or real objects were 
rarely attempted. A series of iSTeolitbic oruamentatiou is shown iu 
plates 19 and 20. These are mostly on pottery, only lour being- on 
stone and to be classed as sculi^tnre. There seem to have been two 
geographic areas iu Frauce affecting this kind of art, the first around 
the Bay of Qniberon, department of Morbilian, the second in the 

department of the Marne, north- 
ern central France. 

The four specimens referred to 
are all from the first-mentioned 
area. They are on plate 20, figs, 
IG, 21, 23, and on plate 19, fig. 15. 
Plate 19, fig. 15, represents the 
sculpturing on one of the supports 
of the dolmen of Petit-Mont, at 
Arzon. The principal designs or 
lines are in waves and U-shaped. 
The only one which could have 
been intended to represent any 
kiiowu or possible object are two 
human footprints, and these do 
not appear to signify anything 
more than is apparent. Plate 20, 
' fig. 23, represents a cartouche, en- 
graved or sculj)tured on a support 
of the dolmen of Pierres-Plates at 
Lochmariaker, Morbihan. Plate 
20, fig. 21, is a rex)reseutatiou of 
one of the supporting stones of 
the dolmen of Gavr'Inis. The au- 
thor has visited this dolmen and 
has seen the sculj)turod stones in 
place. They are thin sandstone 
slabs, about C feet high, 4 feet 
wide, and form the sides of both 
the cryi)t and the entrance, there 
being probably forty in all, similar 
in many respects to that shown iu 
the figure, although this has been chosen as the best representative. 
The surface is rough; the sculpturing has been done with the hammer 
by pecking or battering — martelar/e, the French call it. Plate 20, fig. 
10, is a reijresentation of the covering stone of the dolmen at Baker 
Hill, Eosshire, Scotland, taken from "Archaiic Sculpturings," by Mr. 
J. Y. Simijson. These will be perceived at once to consist principally 
of cup stones, some with concentric rings, others connected by a slight

groove. To go into the subject of cup stoues us a bniucli of sculpture 
would lead us too far afield.^ 

Otlier dolmens Lave been found witli marks made thereon, but no 
meaning is ascribed to them beyond possibly that of a stone hatchet 
handled, or some similar implement. Fig. 119 is a representation of one 
of these stone hatchets handled, engraved on the sixth support of the 
dolmen of Gavr'Inis. Various iietroglyphs have been found on the dol- 
mens in the immediate neighborhood — Tables-des-Marchands, Mane- 
H'roeck, Kercado, Petit-Mont, Mein-Dreiu, Be-er-Groahj also on the dol-

sculptures has there ever "been an attemj)ted representation of living 
things, except in the few cases mentioned. This statement would have 
been true for all France until within a few years past, but because of 
recent discoveries it requires modification. There have been found on 
some of the stone supports or tables of the dolmens, rude and apparently 
inchoate or malformed figures which, by assembly and comparison, are 
decided by investigating archaeologists to have been representations 
of the human form. Baron Josej)h de Baye and M. Adrien de Mortillet 
have been the most ardent and successful investigators in this regard, 
though MM. Cartailhac and Eeinach should not be forgotten. Fig. 120 
represents one of these supports of a dolmen in the department of 
Marne. Fig. 121 is another from the same department.^ 

These are believed to have been the earliest prehistoric sculptures in 
stone or on stone monuments in France. They were bas-reliefs on the

supports of the dolmens iu the Grottos of Coizard in the valley of Petit- 
Morin (Marne). 

Similar rude sculptures have been found in other parts of Prance, 
which have been collated by M. Cartailhac in the work above cited, 
which collation has been extended in his description of the sculptures 
of the dolmen d'Epone (Seine-et Oise).^ 

The collation of sculptures of the human form was continued by 
M. Solomon Eeinach.- It is not deemed necessary to here enlarge on 
the subject in greater detail. Tliose interested can follow it in the 
authorities cited. 

Plate 43 represents four of a series of eight discovered bj^ Abbe 
Hermet and drawn and described by M. Cartailhac.-' The figures are 
the best of the series and have the nearest approach to human beings. 
Some have legs and feet represented below the girdle, but shorter, 
narrower, straighter, and closer together, until it becomes an even 
chance whether they may not have been intended to represent the 
fringed ends of a scarf. M. Gabriel de Mortillet has reported and fig- 
ured by photograph the same statues.^ 

M. Solomon Reiuach figures and describes the same,^ and says: "I 
find it inexplicable that these should ever have been qualified as Neo- 
lithic. The accessories which distinguish them can respond only to an 
origin in the time of metal, probably of bronze." 

Other sculptures near Paris are reported by M. Adrien de Mortillet." 

NORTH AMERICA. 

Aboriginal sculptures in North America are quite different from those 
of Europe. The Neolithic i)eoples of the United States, whether North 
American Indians or their ancestors or predecessors, made many pieces 
of sculpture in stone, wood, or pottery, representing animal as well as 
human faces and forms. Most of these were rude, though they some- 
times presented the subject in a bold and marked manner. 

In fifone. — The sculptures in stone exhibited a skill iu art inferior to 
that displayed in flint chipping, drilling, and polishing. The ordinary 
decoration of objects was not, as in Europe, confined to geometric 
designs. It appears as though the aboriginal American artist gave his 
fancy or imagination free rein, was not hampered by rules of art nor 
deterred from the most daring attempts by any imaginary mechanical 
or technical difficulty. It is true that he made designs b}^ sculptur- 
ing on fiat surfaces, sometimes on stone, but many more times on pot- 
tery. Still, on numerous occasions he essayed the highest flights of

art, and souolit to represent the liuman form as well as the face, by 
sculijtures done in the round. 

Plate 44 represents a human figure sculptured in stone. Its height 
is 21i inches, and its weight 56 pounds. It is complete and perfect, 
without a break or damage. It was found near Stilesboro, Bartow 
County, Georgia. It is seated, the legs are represented in the solid 
stone as though crossed, but in an impossible manner, not being more 
tlian one-third the length of the arms. The only indications of sex are 
the mammu', which are small dots, indicating the male. The material 
is fine-grained sandstone, and the entire figure has been worked out of 
the solid. It has apparently been done altogether by battering or peck- 
ing into form and then rubbed or scraped smooth. It is not polished. 
The shape of the head and the general appearance of the features are 
typical, to a degree at least, of the aboriginal art throughout tlie south- 
ern United States. The head rounded over the top of the skull, broad 
across the middle, with projecting ears; the eyebrows are prominent 
but made' so by the sunken eyes. The eyes are oval, and their orbits 
on the same jdane. The nose is straight, without much appearance of 
nostrils. The chin is short and rounded, the under jaw very small. The 
most noticeable characteristic of this specimen, as it is of many others 
from the same region, and that which would seem more than anything 
else a local type of human sculpture, is the mouth and the mode of 
treating it. The mouth is open, being represented principally by a 
(!avity which has been excavated to a considerable profundity. The 
lips are strong and protrude greatly. They are not divided into upper 
and lower lips, but are continuous around the orifice so as to form an 
oval ring, the interior of which is the cavity representing the mouth. 
Neither the teeth nor the tongue are shown, though a ridge in this 
specimen might pass for teeth or gums. The neck is fairly well formed ; 
the shoulders are square, but with the arms, are considerably exagger- 
ated in size. The body under the armpits is less than half the width 
across the shoulders. From the armpits to the legs the body is a solid 
cylindrical mass of stone, without indication of thorax, waist, or 
abdomen. The hands and arms, esi)ecially the former, are extremely 
rude, the fingers being only indicated by scratc;hes. The head as is 
represented, was thrown well back, the chin being somewhat in the air. 
The upper part of the face as well as the forehead, retreated consider- 
ably; the head was short (brachycephalic), though this might have 
resulted from the action of the artist without being anj^ indication of 
race. The occiput Avas furnished with a knot 3i inches in diameter and 
li inches elevation. This might represent liair, although there is noth- 
ing particular to indicate it. The statue has none of the fillet, as it is 
called by Professor Thonuis, which communicates from the back of the 
head downward. 

Fig. 122 represents a human image of crystalline limestone. It is 
more than 20 inches in height and weighs 37 pounds. It was dis-

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 



covered in a cave near Strawberry Plains, IG miles east of Knoxville, 
Tennessee. The body is rudimentary. The face is fairly well repre- 
sented and shows the two peculiarities of the sculptures of that south- 
ern region, that is, the retreating forehead and the ring-like mouth. 

Fig. 123 represents two views, back and front, of a rude sculpture of 
the female figure. It is of yellowish sandstone, is from Williamson 
County, Tennessee, and is about 8 in(;hes high. Like the former speci- 
men, the body and head are rude, being little more than indicated. 
The mammae show it to have been intended for a 
female figure. The arms are only indicated on the 
stone and are not separated from the body. The 
figure is seated or kneeling, the hands upon the 
knees. The spinal column is i)romineutly indi- 
cated. There is the same sloping face and re- 
treating forehead, with the ring-mouth as before 
remarked. 

Fig. 124 is another represeutaMon of a female 
figure, 15 inches high, of yellowish sandstone, 
from the same locality (Williamson County, Ten- 
nessee). The body is much better represented 
than the former, and as a work of art is more 
complete and better finished. The figure is 
kneeling with the hands crossed and pressing 
against the abdomen. The occiput is provided 
with a knot through which is a perforation, as 
though for suspension, although its actual use is 
unknown. 

Prof. Cyrus Thomas' published an investigation 
into the geographic extension in the Southern 
States, of sculi^tures with the peculiar fillet ex- 
tending from the head down the back, and con- 
cludes that "the conventionalized form is indica- 
tive of local origin." His attention in this regard 
was first arrested by the examination of a small 
stone image found in a box-shaped stone grave at 
Castilian Springs, Sumner County, Tennessee, 
sent to the Bureau of American Ethnology by 
"'"■'■■ Mr. S. S. Bush, of Louisville, Kentucky. 

Fig. 125 represents two views of a cast of this image (Cat. No. 
175041, U.S.K.M.). It is to be remarked that this image, while it has 
the retreating forehead, has no semblance of the ring mouth heretofore 
noticed. Though reported to have been made of stone, the photographs 
from which these figures were made was a clay model or plaster cast, 
and the eyes and nose differ widely from the stone images of that local- 
ity, being almost exactly like those made of clay and which abound on 
the pottery bowls and bottle vases.

Plate 45 represents two views of a stone statue, a cast of wlii(;li is in 
the Uuitecl States Xatioual Museiim. The original is in the Tennessee 
Historical Society collection. 
Tlie following (lescrii)tion is 
given of this specimen by Col. 
Charles C. Jones:' 

It was plowed tip on Col one 
Tunilin's plantation (near Carters- 
ville, Georgia), near the base of 
the large tumnlns (Tnmlin's Eto- 
wah Monnd). * * =* It is a fe- 
male fignre in a sitting posture. 
The legs, however, are rudimen- 
tary aud unformed. Its height is 
15| inches, and its weight 33| 
pounds. Cut out of a soft xalcose 
rock, originally of a grayish hue, 
it has been in time so much dis- 
colored that it noAY pi'cseuts a fer- 
ruginous appearance. Below the 
navel, and enveloping the but- 
tocks and rudimentary thighs, is a 
hip dress, ornamented both on the 
left side and behind by rectangu- 
lar, circular, and irregular Hues. 
The ears are pierced, and the head 
is entirely bald. In the center of 

the top of the head a hole has been drilled half an inch in depth, and five-tenths of 
an inch in diameter. This prob.ably formed the socket in which some head orna- 
ment was seated. That ornament, whatever it was, had fallen out and was lost when 
the image was fouml. Springing from the back of the head and attached at the 
other end to the back midwaj' between the shoulders, is a 
substantial handle by means of which this image could haA^e 
been securely suspended or safely transported from jjlace to 
place. The mammary glands are sharply defined and maidenly 
in their appearance. The ears, hand, and navel are rudely 
formed. The impression conveyed is that of a dead, young, 
flat-head Indian woman. Unfortunately the left arm has been 
broken off, but other ^vise this idol is in a state of remarkable 
preservation. 

It appears, also, from Colonel Jones, that another 
statue in the possession of Colonel Tumlin, in 1859, 
had been plowed up near the same mound. Colonel 
Jones reported that he saw it, and he gives the fol- 
lowing descri])tion:- 

It was of coarse dark sandstone, and it was 12 inches high. 

It consisted of a male figure in a sitting posture. The knees 

were drawn up almost on a level with the chin, the hands 

resting upon and clasping either knee. The chin and forehead 

were retreating, the hair gathered into a knot beliind, the face upturned, and the 

eyes angular. Unfortunately this image was lost or destroyed during Sherman's 

march through Georgia in 1864.

Plate 47 represents a statue of gray sandstone from Williamson 
County, Tennessee. It was found by Dr. Frost, of Nashville, and 
belongs to the collection of tbe Tennessee Historical Society. It rep- 
resents 11 different type of man or a different style of art. Tbe figure 
is in a squatting or kneeling position, tbe left knee is brought to tbe 
ground, and tbe figure is sitting on tbe left foot. The rigbt leg is 
brought forward, the foot being flat upon tbe ground, tbe knee in its 
natural position, tbe rigbt arm and body resting on it. All this forms 
a base by means of which the statue can sit alone. Tbe face is round, 
moon-like, the eyes much the same, giving it a wild and staring expres- 
sion. The nose is prominent, but broad and flat, while tbe lips are pro- 
truding and heavy. The workmanship is crude, and it seems doubtful 
if it was ever intended as a portrait bust or to represent any partic- 
ular individual or tribe. The entire statue has been wrought out of 
the solid, and apparently no i)art of the original surface was ever 
utilized. It has peculiarities of physiognomy, different from the ordi- 
nary appearance of the Indian, and resembles the negro, yet the 
ensemble of the statue bears no relation to the negro. Tbe appearance 
of the face resembles somewhat the Perrine statue from Union County, 
Illinois, made in pottery and represented in fig. 132. 

A much mutilated and defaced statue of sandstone was found in a 
mound in Tennessee and deposited in the United States National 
Museum by Dr. John E. Youuglove, of Bowling Green, Kentucky. 
The lower part is broken, and its original condition is unknown. 
Enough of it remains to show the shape of the head, tbe indication 
of the hair, tbe breadth of the face, and that all these are of the 
same type as tbe examples from the same locality. The ears are 
well represented, and are much more elaborate than in any specimen 
yet examined. This head, if taken alone, would have every appear- 
ance of being a bowlder, tbe surface of which bad been sculptured as 
shown, but an examination of the head, taken in connection with tbe 
shoulders and breast, shows that it has been worked out of a larger 
piece. The fracture, both of tbe trunk and that by which the nose and 
mouth was destroyed, was ancient, and tbe broken surface appears to 
be equally as old as any of the sculptured portion. (Cat. No. 141015, 
U.S.N.M.) 

This statue is peculiar in its appearance and unlike those from the 
Southern States; the only one bearing any similarity to it which has 
come to tbe notice of the author is that shown by Thruston.' 

Other specimens from tbe region of Tennessee and Kentucky are in 
private and State or municipal collections in the States mentioned, but 
enough has been shown to indicate a particular style of sculpture or a 
certain sameness in its production. Whether this arises from a pecu- 
liarity of the artists in that they were all taught one way, or had

a<lopted a given style, or whether the individuals rejiresented were 
alike and had, in fact, the peculiarities of form aud feature dei^icted 
by the sculptor, is unknown. A critical and extended examiuation 
and comparison might furnish means for determination. 

The localities where these sculptured peculiarities belong are princi- 
pally through the southern tier of States, extending from the Atlantic 
Ocean to the Mississii)pi Kiver. 

In pottery. — It is nowproi)osed to investigate sculpturing, or perhaps 
the better term is modeling, in pottery. These specimens belong to 
the same general locality as the stone statues, except that the former 
seem to cross the Mississippi Eiver and extend to the north into 
Missouri and Illinois. The first to claim our attention, because of their 
peculiarity aud rarity, are the head- shaped vases or death masks princi- 
pally from Arkansas. (Plates 48, 49, figs. 129, 130.) Professor Holmes,^ 
speaking of these vases, says: 

Up to the present time I have met with lint eight of the curious head-shaped vases. 
All were obtained from the vicinity of Pecan Point, Arkansas, anil, like other vessels, 
have been associated with human remains in graves or mounds. It is true that in 
all cases the bones of the dead have not been found, but this only indicated their 
complete decay. The question as to whether or not these vases were made exclu- 
si^'ely for sepulchral purposes must remain unanswered; there is no source of infor- 
mation upon the subject. Such a purpose is, however, suggested in this case by the 
semblance of death given to the faces. 

The finest example yet found is shown i n fig. 420 [our plate 48, fig. 1] . In form it is 
a simple head 5 inches in height and 5 inches wide from ear to ear. The aperture of 
the vase is in the crown, and is surrounded by a low, upright rim, slightly recurved. 
The cavity is roughly finished and follows pretty closely the contour of the exterior 
surface, excepting iu projecting features, such as the ears, lips, and nose. The Avails 
are generally from one-eighth to one-fonrth of an inch in thickness, the base being 
about three eighths. The bottom is flat, and takes the level of the chin aud jaws. 

The material docs not difter from that of the other vessels of the same locality. 
There is a large percentage of shell, some particles of which are quite large. The 
paste is yellowish gray in color and rather coarse in texture. The vase was modeled 
in the plain clay and permitted to harden before the devices were engraved. After 
this a thick film of fine yellowish-gray clay was applied to the f;ice, partially filling 
up the engraved lines. The remainder of the surface, including the lips, received a 
thick coat of dark-red paint. The whole surface was then highly polished. 

The illustration will convey a more vivid conception of this striking head than 
any description that can be given. The face can not he said to have a single feature 
strongly characteristic of Indian physiognomy. We have, instead, the round fore- 
head and the projecting mouth of the African. The nose, however, is suuxll and the 
nostrils are narrow. The face would seem to be that of a youngish person, perhaps 
a female. The features are well modeled, and are so decidedly individual in char- 
acter that the artist nnist have had in his mind a i»retty definite conception of the 
face, as well as of the expression appropriate to it, before beginning his work. It 
will be impossible, however, to prove that the portrait of a particular personage 
was intended. The closed eyes, the rather sunken nose, and the parted li])s were 
certainly intended to give the eftect of death. The ears aie laige, correctly placed, 
and well modeled. They are perforated all along the margin, thus revealing *a

476 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

])ractico of the people to -whom tliey referred.' The 8ei)tum of the nose appears to 
liavo been pierceil, and the horizontal depression across the ujiper lip may indicate 
the former jiresence of a suspended ornament. 

* * * * * * . # 

It will be well to observe that npon the forehead, at the top, there is a small per- 
forated knob or loop. Similar appendages may be seen n])on many of the clay human 
heads from this valley. A Mexican terra-cotta head now in the museum at IVIexico 
has a like feature, and, at the same time, has closed eyes and an open mouth. 

All of these heads, including also some of those in the National Museum, are much 
alike in conception and execution. 

This fact Avill be forcibly impressed npon the inind by a study of fig. 423 [our 
plate 48, fig. 2], which represents a specimen recently exhumed at Pecan Point by 
agents of the Bureau of Ethnology. In size, form, color, finish, modeling of features, 
and expression this head closely resembles the one iirst described. The work is not 
quite so carefully executed, and the head has probably not such pronounced indi- 
viduality. TLie curious device that in the other examples appeared near the left eye 
here occurs on both sides. The lower part of the face is elaborately engraved. 
Three liues cross the upper lip and cheeks, reaching to the ear, a baud of fret-like 
d<'viees extend across the mouth to the base of the ears, and another band filled in 
with oblique reticulated lines passes around the chin and along the jaws. The ears 
are perforated as in the other case, and the septum of the nose is partially broken 
away as if it had once held a ring. A perforated knob has occupied the top of the 
forehead as in the other case. The face is coated with a light yellowish-gray slip, 
and the remainder of the surface is red. 

Mr. F. S. Delleiibaugh, who combines tlie archfpologist with the art- 
ist, has published'^ some observations aud conclusions concerning this 
specimen (plate 48, fig. 2). He begins his paper with the declaration, 
conceded as true, that the ISTorth American aborigines have not been 
successful in depicting the human face. It might be added that they 
have been no more successful in depicting the human form. He then 
declares that the excellence of these two or three specimens is far 
beyond the ability of the aboriginal sculptor as shown in all other 
specimens, and gives it as his opinion that these were death masks. 

Soft clay was jiressed upon the dead features, and when sufficiently dry it was 
removed and other soft clay thinly pressed into the mold obtained. The mask thus 
made was built upon until the jar was comiileted. 

He declares Mr. Holmes's theory of a free hand sculpture to have 
been an impossibility. He thinks it to have been taken in the manner 
suggested from "a young redskin somewhat distorted by disease and 
death. The age might be anywhere from 10 to IG, if a male, and 14 to 
20 if a female." He is of opinion (again differing from Mr. Holmes) 
that the perforations through the knob on the forehead, and those in 



'Some of the tribes on the Northwest Coast have a custom of perforating the rim 
of the ear in a manner similar in appearance to these. Strauds of red woolen yarn 
are drawn in aud tied, which hang almost to the waist. Models of these are in the 
American Museum of Natural History, Central l^ark. New York. It is not suggested 
that there was any relatiou between the two.

the rims of the ear, were intended for suspension. He gives compara- 
tive measurements of one of these vases with two white boys, a white 
man and woman, and shows the general accuracy of size, form, and 
feature. 

Plate 4:(), figs. 1, 2, represents two of these head-shai)ed vases, one of 
which appears to be a death mask and tlie other not. They belong to 
the Morris collection, and were on disi^lay at the Tennessee Centennial 
Exposition, Xashville, 1897, where the author obtained a photograph. 
Fig, 127 a, />, represents a head-shaped vase, front and profile views, 
believed to be a death mask. It was found by Mr. C. W. Eiggs while 
excavating a mound on the St. Francis Kiver, Arkansas. The features 
are represented in a natural manner, such as is not known in free-hand 
sculpture. The decorations of the face, like the foregoing illustrations, 
have been done after the withdrawal of the clay from the mould. The

eyes have been slightly opened, the. nostrils and teeth are represented 
by incisions impossible to ha\ e been made before, and the same is true 
with the decorations on the cheeks and with the ears. Fig. 12S is a 
head-shaped vase, not a death mask, of the red pottery of Arkansas. 
It was obtained from a mound in the vicinity of Little Eock, and forms 
part of the collection of Mr. Thibault. The United States National 
Museum possesses another head-shaped vase (Cat. No. 91299) similar 
to flg. 128 but still smaller. 

These head-shaped vases divide themselves into two distinct groups. 
The specimens forming the first group are deaths masks, as becomes 
more and more evident the more the objec^ts are studied; the other 
group, while of the same general form as the first, the human head 
being represented, has the face and features wrought upon it free hand, 
as in sculpturing, without the aid of a mold or cast. The author does

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 



not pretend to any special knowledge on tliis subject, but believes that 
a comparison between these two groups will show the correctness of 
these conclusions. 

The next to be noticed are from the same general locality, and are 
what have been called "efflgy bottles." Professor Holmes ^ makes the 
following observations concerning them: 

These iiborigiual potters dealt with the hnuian figure in a hold maimer for savages. 

They Avere evidently capable of representing many creatures with accuracy, hut 

preferred grotesque or con- 
ventional forms. A man or 
a woman is generally mod- 
eled with a largo body and 
a curious hunched back, 
the vertebne appearing 
.ilong the jjrominent ridge. 
'I he shoulder blades are 
usually shown Avith unato- 
niic distinctness, if not 
with jirecision; the arms 
are long and slender, and 
the hands rest upon the 
knees or sides. The posi- 
tion assumed is mostly 
that of kneeling or squat- 
ting, the feet being doubled 
up beneath and united 
with the bottom of the ves- 
sel. These effigy vases are 
numerous and greatly vary 
in size and color. They 
are mostly of the dark red, 
or in red and AA'hite figures, 
some of which represent 
parts of the costume, others 
emblematic devices. * * * 
The knees, calves, ankles, 

and various parts of the feet are indicated wi±h an approach to accuracy. The 

bottom of the vessels are flat, so as to enable them to stand alone, and the legs 

modeled in low relief are shown thereon.^ 

Fig. 121) represents an effigy vase from Arkansas. The general posi- 
tion of the body will be understood by an inspection of the ligure. The 
mouth of the bottle is at the back of the head. One is to remark the 
peculiar representation of the face and features, and their similarity 
with some of those already described. The head is thrown back as in 
the foregoing, the chin is in air, while the features, nose, eyes, and 
mouth are much the same. Fig. 130 represents another effigy bottle, 
also from Arkansas, bearing the same peculiarities. Both these 
have the retreating forehead, the round face, broad and high cheek 
bones, the framing of hair around the edge of the forehead— in fact 
so great a similarity in all these little things as to indicate the same

style of art iiiid tbe same method of representing the human face 
and form. 

Plates 50 and 51 are further representations of the human face and 
form in these efligy bottles. They all come from Tennessee, and show 
the various styles of bottles and types of the pottery sculptures of the 
human face. The human form is not supposed in these to be accurately 
represented, but is highly conventionalized in order to accommodate 
itself to the utilitarian purpose of the bottle. These all come from stone 
graves in Tennessee, and most of them from the neighborhood of Nash- 
ville, and are represented one-third actual size. 

Another style of potter}^ vessel belonging to the same geographic 
area, though extending farther north, is the bowl with a handle repre- 
senting a human or animal form. One of these (fig. 131, two views) was 
dug from a mound in Marshall County, Iowa. Although the face is 
grotesque, the nose being exaggerated, yet it bears the family resem-

blance; the head is thrown back, chin in air, retreating forehead, the 
high cheek bones, the eyes and mouth made in the same way as the 
other i)ottery effigies, and generally the similarities are such as to iden- 
tify them wath the same style of art. 

The author has avoided, so far as possible, any reproduction from 
Professor Holmes's work on Art in Pottery, and it is not intended to 
go into this subject. The foregoing have been introduced in order to 
call attention to the peculiarities of the human face throughout this 
geographic area, whether in stone or on pottery. Many other exami)les 
might be cited and copied if required. 



DIFFERENT AREAS AND STYLES. 



We now pass to a different style of sculpture, still aboriginal, but 
belonging to a different geographic area, the center of which might be 
indicated generally as Illinois. Eig. 132 represents a statue taken from

a 111 omul in Union County, Illinois, by Mr. T. M. Perriue. The fignre, 
like many shown, occupied a sitting posture, the base being tiat so that 
the statue will sit aloiie. It differs from many of the foregoing in 
several respects. The right knee is drawn up to the chin so that the 
foot is placed tiat upon the ground; the forehead is receding or retreat- 
ing, but the head is not thrown back and the chin is not in the air. 
While the face is round, yet it is not round as are the others. The high 
cheek bones and great breadth across the middle of the face so notice- 
able in the former are absent in this. The roll of hair around the top 
of the head is dilferently managed. But the greatest differences are in 
.the features. The forehead is not flat either way, but, on the contrary, is 
quite well rounded; the eyebrows are 
not cut out, producing a ridge across 
the face, as in the former specimens ; the 
bridge of the nose is on the same plane 
as the forehead; the eyes, nose, and lips 
differ in style and mode of making and, 
in fact, they represent an individual in 
such a different light as that one might 
easily suppose it belonged to a differ- 
ent race from the former. The eyelids 
are well developed, the eyeball is well 
rounded, and the pupil is prominent. 
The nose and mouth are heavy and 
thick, and, without having any relation 
to the negro race, tliey are far from rep- 
resenting the aquiline nose and thin 
lips in the former figures. Plate 47 rep- 
resents a specimen of the same type. 
The position of the body is the same, 
and the i)eculiarities of eyes, nose, and 
mouth are repeated. 

We pass to a still different geographic 
area. Plate 52 represents two rude 
figures of human heads, the smaller one from ]Monmouth, New Jersey, 
reported in 1882.' The larger one was found in Southfleld, Staten 
Island, near the Fingerboard Koad. A glance is suflicient to show 
the similarity in appearance of the two individuals here represented, 
and their dissimilarity with the two geographic grou]>s heretofore 
described. The shape of the forehead, nose, lips, chin, iiuleed of every 
feature in both statues, is noticeably different from the others. The 
expression of the mouths and chins of these two are slightly different 
from each other, but this might have arisen from want of skill of the 
artist. There is nothing of the flat- or dish-faced appearance, so promi- 
nent in the southern group, nor is there anything of the round or moon-

faced appeariiuce in tbe secoud group. The forehead is reasonably 
high, and while retreating or receding, it is not on the plane of the 
face, as in the southern and other groups. 

Fig. 133 is a cast of a pipe from Ohio. Whether it represents the 
same style as the immediate foregoing or not, it is introduced by rea- 
son of its similarity and possible relation. The mouth is similar to 
those in former representations. It is shown as widely open and deeply 
excavated. The eyes are represented by excavations only, but the 
forehead and face are the same general type as those in Plate 52, from 
New Jersey and Staten Island, The nose and lips are mutilated beyond 
recognition, except that the root of the former is shown broad and not

thin or pinched. The eyes are different from either of the former 
groups, and the cheek bones, while high and jirominent, have a different 
contour. This is largely produced by the sunken cheeks, which are not 
shown in either of the former groups. 

No argument is sought to be made that there were different races of 
aborigines, because of the similarities of the sculptures of the same 
group or the dissimilarities between the different groups. The author 
has no intention to do more than note and present the various styles of 
sculpture, leaving the ethnologic results and conclusions to be worked 
out at a future time.

the King", Charles X, purchased for the Louvre in 1825. Its peculiar! 
ties were first noticed by M. Adrien de Lougperier.^ The same article 
was reproduced in his work.^ This bronze is classed as No. 826, iu the 
catalogue of the Museum.^ It is thus described: 

Kust of a slave whose head and face are entirely shaved. The cars are large aud 
liauging. The top of the skull opens by means of a hinge, which is attached to a 
cover. Above the ears are plated on either side rings in which are adjusted a swing- 
ing handle, which represents a branch or twig with buds. 

It is first to be remarked that the object is what was called a Roman 
sitiila, being a backet, jug, or kettle, which might be used as shown, 
for carrying liquids. This style of object is essentially Roman, and from 
it and the general appearance of the object, its patine, etc., it was the 
opinion of M. de Cueleneer, professor of the university at Ghent, by 
whom my attention was first called to it, that the object belonged, or 
could be assigned to, the century before the Christian era. 

The author once lived in Ghent, where he was acquainted with M. 
de Cueleneer, who has been twice in Washington, and during his visit 
to the National Museum became much interested in the Catlin Gallery 
of Indian Portraits, of which the United States National Museum 
published a catalogue tilling the entire report of the year 1885. The 
author procured a copy of this report for M. de Cueleneer, who has 
used it with good effect in his notice of th.e bronze situla now under 
consideration. 

It was his opinion, although this bronze piece was made probably in 
Italy during the first century prior to the Christian era, that it repre- 
sented, or may have represented, a red Indian from America. In sup- 
port of this contention he presented about a dozen figures of Indian 
heads, taken principally from the National Museum Catalogue of the 
Catlin Gallery; and he called special attention to the similarity of 
the anatomical and somatologic characteristics and peculiarities repre- 
sented in both. He says of the bronze head that the skull is dolichoce- 
phalic, the forehead is retreating, the ears are large and low aud the 
lobes adherent, the eyebrows are strongly arched, the nose is aquiline, 
the angles of the mouth are turned n]) and the lips large, the under jaw 
is rounded, the occiput is protuberant. The discovery of this bronze 
afforded M. de Longperier in a partial, and M. de Cueleneer in a com-

Poinponius Mela says : ^ 

Testum autom rei, Quintum Metellam Cclereui adicit, eumque ita rettulisse coni- 
ineniorat: cum Galliiu proconsule pi-acessit, Indos (iiiosdnm a rege Botorum doiio 
sibi datos; unde in eas terras deveuissent requircMido cognossc, vi teinpestatum ex 

Iiidieis icqnoribiis abreptos, eineusosque qu;u iutereraut, 

tandem iu Geriiianiiu litora exisse. 

Pliny records the same fact as follows: ^ 

Idem Nepos de septeiitrionali circuitu tradit Quinto Me- 
tello Celeri L. Afraiii in consulatu collegie, sed tuni Galliic 
proconsnli, Indos a rege Suevorum doiio datos, i\ni ex 
India commerci causa navigautes tempestatibus essent in 
Germaniam abrepti. 

The reports of tbese two writers agree in all 
essential parts, except the word Botorum in Pom- 
ponius Mela, and Suevorum in Pliny. Subject to 
this variation, the story of both, as reported by 
Cornelius Nepos, is that a king (of the Botes 
or of the Sueves) made a present to Quintius 
Metellus Celeri of an Indian or Indians, wlio, having been cast away 
at sea, were stranded on the coast of Germany. M. de Cueleneer, in 
his paper, " Type d'Indien du Nouveau Monde Kepresente sur un 
Bronze Antique du Louvre" (1890), goes profoundly into this branch of 
the subject, shows who Metellus was, where, and at what epoch he was 
in command, and how he might have received from one of the barbarian 
kings or tribes a present of slaves, which might have been Indian 
castaways from the coast of North America. He then recites the dis 
covery of the bronze situla in the Louvre, and by an 
examination of its workmanship and appearance con- 
cludes it was made in Italy during the first century 
before the Christian era, and from its great resemblance 
to the red race of America, as represented in the Catlin 
Gallery, he concludes the chances are favorable for it 
having been a sculptural representation of a North 
American Indian. 

Fig. 134 represents the sculpture of a human head 
almost life-size cut from limestone. It is of interest ir- 
respective of any intrinsic value, on account of having 
been in the possession of President Thomas Jefferson 
while he lived at Monticello. Although much muti- 
lated, it is still sufiliciently preserved to show creditable 
aboriginal workmanship. There is no exaggeration or 
deformity in any part of this head, which might be a likeness of an 
aged person with a deeply wrinkled face. A conical cavity in its base 
served to keep it in i)ositiou. There is another cavity in the bade of 
the head. The records of the Smithsonian Institution contain no 
information as to the locality whence it came.

Fig. 13(» is a cast in the United States National Museum of a sculp- 
tured stone representing a liuman face and head in profile, discovered 
in 1803-04 near St. George, Charlotte County, New Brunswick, ('anada. 
The stone on which this sculpture was made is 21^ inches high by 
18| inches wide and 
2 inches thick. It is 
granulite, distin- 
guished from granite 
proper by the absence 
of mi(*a. 

Plate ."ii represents 
the sculptured stat- 
ues of two stone lions, 
crouching, carved by 
aboriginal artists. 
They are cut out of 
the solid outcrdpping 
rock, supposed to 
have been done with 
obsidian knives, but 
this has not been ver- 
ified. There are two 
pairs of these lions, 
both on the high 
mesa (in the country 
of the Cochitauos, 
west of the liio 
Grande), one near the 
preh i storic ruin e d 
pueblo of Potrero de 
las Vacas, the other 
l)air near the same 

kind of ])ueblo Potrero de la Idelo. The latter pair have been wrecked 
by some enterprising prospector, who drilled and exploded one of them 
with dynamite. 

The painting ' from which the Las Vacas plate was takeu was made 
by Mr. K. W. Deming, artist, and was first seen by the author at Veer- 
hoff's, F street, Washington City. An application to the artist secured 
the foregoing description, with the explanation that these sculptures 
are still regarded with superstition and as having supernatural power, 
insomuch that the older Cochitauo Indians believe them to be the gods

of tlie chase, and make invocations and prayers to them preparatory to

Masls. — Not infrequently aborigi- 
nal s(;ulptures have been found, some 
among the savages of the United 
States, but in greater numbers in 
Mexico, which have been called 
masks, being made of ilat and com- 
paratively thin stone with human 
features sculptured thereon. Similar 
masks are reproduced on the Pacific 
coast, far north, in wood with various 
painted decorations, and also form 
part of the discovery of Mr. Gushing 
on the southwest coast of Florida. 

Fig. 137 represents a mask roughly 
carved from sandstone. It is 12 
inches high, 7.^ inches broad at the 
ears, and weighs nearly 9 pounds. 
As usual, it is slightly concave at the 
back. It was found while i)lowing 
near Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Figs. 
138 and 139 are face and profile views 
of a mask of sandstone found in Bel- 
mont County, Ohio, nearly opposite 

Wheeling. Neither of these have any marks or holes in the back for 

suspension or attachment. The similarity of the art work of these with 

that of fig. 140 will be apparent at a glance, and it may be queried 

whether the similarity of appearance 

may not have some application to race, 

but ui)on the latter proi^osition no 

opinion is expressed. 

Fig. 140 is a small stone mask from 

Gambler, Ohio. It displays better 

art in the working of the material 

than in its representation of the 

human face. The stone is quite 

hard, it can only be wrought by 

pecking or battering and then rub- 
bing or grinding to make it smooth. 

The horns projecting from the head 

are for an unknown purpose; the ears 

are too low on the side of the head; 

the nose and mouth are impossible in 

the human subject, but with all these 

l)eculiarities the stone has been well wrought and nicely polished. 
Fig. 141 is a mask of grotesque appearance; it is of pot- stone from

Morgantown, Catawba County, iSTortb Carolina. The slab is about 2 
inches in thickness, and the back is slightly concave. The mechanical 
art of the stone working is better than the artistic representation of 
the human face. The face is quite too long for its width. The features 
are extremely rude, the eyes being represented by mere excavations 
in the stone. The nose is a simple protuberance. The hair is not rep- 
resented, and there is but a faint representation of eyebrows, which 
is made by a shallow groove running across the face from one temple

to the other. The chin is represented by a square figure, and the neck 
might serve for a handle. There are many of these masks of differ- 
ent materials and style. Their purpose is unknown. A suggestion is 
given of the possibility of use of this specimen by the holes which 
have been drilled along the side, and which may have served for 
attachment. Some of the masks from Mexico and Central America 
have similar holes.

on the Etowah Kiver, iier^r Cartersville, Georgia. Origiually carved as 
a head or bust, the seams in the marble have opened aud the face part 
has split off, fornung a quasi mask. The representation is of the human 
face, which appears quite natural in its i)ioportion and features; with, 
however, slight resemblance to the physiognomy of the iSTorth American 
Indian. This has no signification and is not worthy of consideration, 
for this group of mounds has furnished the copper and shell objects 
noted by Prof. W. H. Holmes in the Second Annual Report of the 
Bureau of Ethnology, quoted in my paper on "The Swastika," and 
described at length in the report of Professor Thomas.' Professor 

Thomas says that in all their leading features 
these designs are suggestive of Mexican or 
Central American work. 

Some of the Mexican sculptures were de- 
scribed in the paragraphs on j ade. Masks and 
sculpture in stone from Mexico are here con- 
tinued. 

Fig. 143 represents a typical Mexican mask 
of greenish mottled feldspatbic stone, and is 
5^ inches long. Its back is slightly concave 
and the mouth and eyes'have been excavated 
by drilling, as can be seen in the corners. It 
is finely polished throughout its entire sur- 
face. The holes in the edges by which it 
could be fastened are shown. Dr. Rau gave 
as his opinion that these masks were used 
for covering the faces of idols on certain oc- 
casions. 

Figs. 144 and 145 are specimens from Mexico 
representing the human form. 

Pi2)es. — The pipes used by the aborigines of 
North America were not infrequently orna- 
mented with sculptured representations of men 
aud women, but a greater number were orna- 
mented with animal forms. The books written upon the archaeology of 
the North American aborigines abound in representations of these 
sculptures. Squier and Davis, Dr. Eau, Abbott's "Primitive Indus- 
try,"' Jones's "Antiquities of the Southern Indians," Thruston's "Antiq- 
uities of Tennessee," and similar works contain these representations in 
greater or less numbers. A few specimens of animal forms were not 
utilized as pipes, but it is entirely uncertain whether they were not 
unfinished si)ecimens intended for pipes. 

Engrared Tablets. — Certain engraved or incised stones or tablets 
have been found in the United States, under circumstances which

although it has been suggested that they served as stamps fori mi)ress-

Fig. 15 [146] is the "Ciuciunati tablet," showing the sserpeut combined with the 
human form. A carclul study ol' this ooiuplicatcd design shows it to be formed on the 
same i)rincii)le as tliose carved on bones. Not only is the duplication of the right and 
left sides apparent, but there is also a remarkable duplication of the different parts 
when they are reversed, the right and left anil the upper and lower. This is shown 
in the reduced (Uitlines given in fig. 16, of which a shows the human figure as in fig. 

1.5. We notice here the ears, cc, as straight bars on 
each side of the head; the eyes, the two dark cir- 
cles, each with two projecting cuived arms; th(^ 
nose, the lozenge-shaped.space, and the broad mouth, 
the transverse white sjiace below. The body in- 
cludes the two oval figures in the center, which ar(^ 
duplicates of each other, as will be seen by folding 
the upper over the lower. The arms curve outward 
and the hands are shown at 
dd, with the fingers point- 
ing inward; the three mid- 
dle fingers are represented 
by the trefoil between the 
foug curved thumb above 
and the little finger below. 
The legs project from the 
lower portion of the body 
and are l)cut upward at the knees, ff; the feet with the toes 
pointing outward, ee, are duplicates of the hands. Here 
the duplication is with the left foot and the right hand 
turned upward on each other and reversed ; the same with 
the right foot and left hand; while the duplication is 
again shown by folding the hands and feet of one side upon 
the opposite side. 

lu the reverse' of this human design 
(shown in fig. 16b) the two serpent 
heads are shown at the bottom of the 
figure, with the slender uecks extend- 
ing ofi" on each side and connecting 
with the central portion of the design; 
j indicates the jaw of each serpent 
head. The symbolic eye with its double 
arms is seen above the jaw, and the 
four horns or plumes of the serpent, 
two above and two below, curving 
backward, are of the same character 
as shown on many other serpent heads 

from Mexico and Central America. The dou1)le reversal of 
the several portions of the whole design can readily be seen by 
following the lines on the opposite sides of these reversed 
outlines, a and b.

a sandstone slab, or rock, on tlie Upper Missouri Eiver, This slab, as 
shown in the ligure, was cut out from its original resting place. The 
work was done by Captain Little, United States Army, and presented 
to tlie United States National Museum by him. The tracks are about 
11 inches long and represent the leet as covered Avith moccasins.

conade County, Missouri, 
by Mr. John P. Jones, by 
whom it was sent to the 
National Museum. The 
length of the track is 0-| 
inches. Tlie opposite side 
of the bowlder bears a 
footprint less distinct 
than this. 

Sculptures similar in 
appearance to the latter, 
but representing the hu- 
man hand instead of the 
foot, have been found 
among the aborigines. 
One (Cat. No. -l311iG, 
U.S.N.M.), on a Hat and 
smooth limestone or mar- 
ble slab, was found in a 
mound near Naples, Illinois, and presented to the United States National 
Museum by Mr. J, B. Henderson. It represents the hand more by out- 
line than intaglio. It is about twice the natural size, and shows the 
lingers spread widely apart. 

Pottery. 

After stone, pottery came into the greatest use in i)rehistoric times. 
It has peculiar interest to us in that it was the material which lent 
itself most readily to art purjjoses, and again from its great resistance 
to the ravages of time. The manifestation of art on pottery in the 
way of decoration could be perpetuated, not only from its enduring 
character, but when broken into fragments the decoration would not be 
lost. The greatest number of patterns and art motifs of prehistoric 
times throughout the Eastern Hemisphere have been i)eri)etuated in the 
fragments of pottery.

EUROPEAN. 

Neolithic.— it has been coutemled tliat pottery was not employed in 
western Europe during the Paleolithic period. The consensus of opin- 
ion is in favor of the existence of pottery during this i)eriod in some 
portions of Europe, while it did not exist in otiier portions. Some 
of the caverns of Belgium, which have otherwise yielded no objects but 
such as are identified with the Paleolithic period, still have yielded 
fragments of pottery. Tiiere is in the museum at Brussels, Belgium,' a 
vase almost entire, reconstructed from the fragments found in one of 
these caves. But there is continually the question of intrusion and 
subsequent occupation. It is the definite opinion of i\I. de Mortillet 
that no evidence has been discovered of the use of pottery in France or 
I-lngland during the Pale- 
olithic period. During 
the Neolithic period and 
the Bronze age, pottery 
abounded throughout 
western Euroi)e, and it is 
now found in quantities in 
nearly all localities occu- 
pied by prehistoric man 
in these ages. 

There is considerable 
variation between the pot- 
teries of different local- 
ities; difference in mate- 
rial, some being coarser, 
others finer, and in shape 
or form, and in decoration. 

The northwest coast 
of France, including the 
ancient province of Brit- 
tany, seems to have pro- 
duced the finest pottery after that of Denmark; while that of the cen- 
tral and southern i>arts of France and of England seems to have been 
coarser and ruder. It is no purpose of this paper to describe the mak- 
ing of pottery, but one may say that in all this prehistoric period the pot- 
tery vases were made without the use of the wheel or /urnace. All evi- 
dence points to the introduction of the latter into western Europe from 
Greece through Etruria and Eome. It was not until the Roman con- 
quest of Frarice and England that these countries were affected by the 
knowledge of the wheel and furna(;e, and this can be carried a step 
farther, for within the memory of living men this knowledge had not 
been spread throughout the British islands. In northern Scotlanfl ajid 
among the Orkneys and Hebrides islands the rude household pottery

is miide in tlic same mauuer as in prehistoric times, and apparently 
this Ivnowledge had descended from generation to generation uiiaifected 
by ontside inllucnces. The theory has been put forth that prehistoric 
pottery was hardened by exposure to the sun. While exposure to the 
sun might harden it sufficiently to maintain its form and to hold sub- 
stances of little weight and no moisture, yet for the ordinary uses of 
pottery the hardening by the sun is insufficient, and it is believed that 
all pieces and fragments of prehistoric times were burnt. 

These prehistoric vases were for the most part rounded at the bottom 
and unable to sit alone. The suggestion is made, by way of explana- 
tion, that they were suspended over the fire, and anything in the way 
^__ of a bottom as a base or legs would 

interfere with this, and therefore 
the bottoms were rounded. 

The form most affected through- 
out western Europe for pottery 
vases was that called the tulip. It 
was the commonest in Brittany, 
where the material was the finest; 
but it was also used in England, in 
Hanover, Bohemia, Hungary, Sicily, 
and in Portugal. Plate 55 repre- 
sents two vases of the tulip form, 
with characteristic ornamentation, 
from southeastern France. They 
were found in a dolmen in the neigh- 
borhood of the little hamlet of St. 
Vallier, in the department of Alpes- 
Maritimes, where the author spent a 
summer in archaeological researches. 
They were found by and are the 
property of M. Oasimir Bottin. 

Plate 50 will show the form of 
pottery vases in various European 
countries during the Neolithic period. The style of decoration has 
been shown in jjlates 19 and 20, and need not be further treated here. 

Bronze age. — The pottery of the Bronze age was not materially differ- 
ent from that of the Neolithic period. There is, to be sure, a certain 
change of form ; all specimens seem to have been smaller. There are a 
great number of cups, dishes, i)lates, etc. The j)aste is finer, the walls 
are thinner, and the decoration, while of the same general style, is a 
continuation of the lines, dots, and curves arranged in geometric form. 
They are, however, made lighter and closer together, giving the orna- 
mentation a finer and more artistic air. With these exceptions, the pot- 
tery of the Bronze age was much the same as that of the Neolithic 
period.

PREHISTORIC ART. 495 

Canon Greenwell, in liis work on Britisli Barrows,' speaking of tlie 
prehistoric pottery found therein, says: 

The most common forma of ornament are alternate series of parallel horizontal 
and vertical lines (like heraldic compone, if it were engraved as of gules and azure) ; 
now and then in a double series (as counter compone); triangles set in rows (or, 
rather, what heralds call a dancette line of partition), the triangular space formed 
being filled with parallel diagonal lines, which have a different direction in each 
alternate space (like alternate representations of heraldic purpure and vert); rows 
of round or oval impressions encircling the urn; lines forming a reticulated pattern; 
lines placed herring bone fashion, or in a zigzag. The lines are often made by 
impressions of twisted thong or cord, but sometimes are drawn on the clay with a 
sharp-pointed instrument. In some rare cases raised ribs occur in the rim [fig. 59], 
and one from Rosebrough, Northumberland, has a series of figures in relief [fig. 60]. 

Many of the designs on plates 19 and 20 are taken from Canon Green- 
well's book, and are snch as here described. 

The first material change in pottery in France and England was X)0S- 
sibly brought from Etruria. The next was by the importation of the 
Samian or Aretiue ware brought by the Eomans. This pottery was 
thick, heavy, hard, resisting all ravages of time, and, except for break- 
age, the specimens now found are as perfect as they were originally. 
It was of finer paste, still not made with the wheel, but in molds. The 
ornamentation was in relief, being usually on the outside, the soft 
paste having been pressed into the mold. Most of these specimens 
were brought to western Europe by the Eomans themselves, though.it 
is supposed they were made there during the long period of Eoman 
occupation. 

Grecian, Etruscan, and Eoman pottery were all different from any- 
thing more modern. The knowledge of their manufacture has been 
lost, and all these kinds of pottery have become extinct. They are 
almost prehistoric, but because of the localities wherein they have been 
found, and the objects with which they were associated, they have come 
to be placed under the head of Classic, rather than Prehistoric, Arch- 
u'ology. The works on that subject should be consulted by any one 
desirous of pursuing the study. 

UNITED STATES (EXCLUDING THE TUEBLOS). * 

Neolithic. — Without attempting a discussion of the differences of the 
culture status of the isTeolithic period in the country occupied by the 
North American savage, and other countries of the Pueblos, Mexico, 
Central and South America, it is sufficient to say that there certainly 
were great differences in the pottery manufactured by the respective 
peoples of these countries. The southern potteries are so different and 
so superior to those of the peoples to the north that it would require a 
volume to do them justice. All present attempts will be confined to 
northern Neolithic peoples.

ouglily into the subject of the pottery of this country, and reference is 
made to the numerous papers he has published.^ Anyone desiring to 
examine the subject in detail is respectfully referred thereto. This 
paper deals only with art, and consequently only with form and designs 
of decoration. 

In his paper on "The ancient pottery of the Mississippi Valley^"' he 
epitomizes the propositions, thus: 

Ii'orm. — This ware exhibits a great variety of form, many of which are extremely 
pleasing. In this respect it is far superior to the other prehistoric groups of the east- 
ern United States. The shapes .are as varied and elegant as those of the ancient Pueblo 
jiottery, but are inferior to those of Mexico, Central America, and Peru. * * * 

Finish. — The finish, as compared with the work of civilized nations, is rude. The 
surface is often simply hand or trowel smoothed. Generally, howev^er, it was more 
or less carefully polished by rubbing with an implement of stone, shell, bone, or 
other suitable substance, the markings of these tools being distinctly visible. Noth- 
ing resembling a glaze has been found on pieces known to be ancient. The surface 
was sometimes washed or coated with a slip or film of fine clay, which facilitated 
the polishing, and in very many cases a coat of thick red ocher was applied. 

Ornament. — The ancient potter of the middle province has taken especial delight 
in the embellishment of his wares, and the devices used are various and interesting. 
They include, first, fanciful modifications of form; second, relief ornament; third, 
intaglio figures, and fourth, designs in color. 

Modificaiion of shape. — It can hardly be claimed that the ancient peoples of this 
region had a very refined appreciation of elegance of outline, yet the simple, essen- 
tial forms of cups and pots were by no means satisfactory to them. There are many 
modifications of shape that indicate a taste for higher types of beauty and a con- 
stant attempt to realize them. The aesthetic sentiment was considerably developed. 

There is also a decided tendency toward the grotesque. To such an extreme have 
the dictates of fanc3^ been followed in this respect, that utility, the true office of the 
utensil, has often taken a secondary place, although it is never lost sight of entirely. 
Bowls have been fashioned into the shapes of birds, fishes, and reptiles, and vases 
and bottles into a multitude of animal and vegetable forms without apparent regard 
to convenience. All of these modifications of essential forms were doubtless looked 
upon as in a sense ornamental. So far as I can determine they were in no case 
intended to be humorous. 

Itelief ornament. — Decorative ideas of a purely conventional character are often 
worked out in both low and salient relief. This is generally accomplished by the 
addition of nodes and fillets of clay to the plain surface of the vessel. Fillets are 
applied in various ways over the body, forming horizontal, oblique, and vertical

bands or ribs. Wheu placed about the base or rim, Ibese fillets are ofteu indented 
with the fi]i<;er or au implement in a way to imitate rudely a Leavy twisted cord — a 
feature evidently borrowed from basketry. Nodes are likeAvise attached in various 
ways to the neck and body of the vessel. In souie cases the entire surface of the 
larger versel is varied bj^ pinching up small hits of the clay between the nails of the 
linger and thumb. An implement is sometimes used to produce a similar result. 

Iniatjlio design. — The ;esthetic tendencies of these potters are well shown by their 
essays in engraving. They worked with points upon both plastic and the sun-dried 
elay, as well as at times iipon the lire-baked surface. Figures thus produced exhibit 
a wide range of artistic achievement. They illustrate all stages of progress, from the 
most archaic type of ornament — the use of dots and straight lines — to the most ele- 
gant combinations of curves, and hnally to the tleliueation of forms and fanciful 
conceptions. 

Generally, when a blunt implement is employed, the line is produced by a move- 
ment that I shall call trailing, in contradistinction to incision, in which a sharp point 
is used, and excision or excavation, which is more easily accomplished with the end 
of a hollow reed or bone. Impressed or stamped ornament is of rare occurrence, and 
anything like repoussee work is practically unknown. The practice of impressing 
cords and fabrics was common among many of the northern tribes, and nets have 
been used in the manufacture and ornamentation of vases at many points witbin 
this province. Stamps especially prepared Avere in use in most of the Gulf States 
and to a limited extent in nortlieru localities. 

Designs in color. — The colors used in painting are white, red, brown, and black, 
and have generally consisted of thick, opaque, clayey paste, white or colored with 
ochers. Occasionally the colors used seem to have been mere stains. All were prob- 
ably laid on with coarse brushes of hair, feathers, or vegetable fiber. The figures 
are in most cases simple, and are applied in broad, bold lines, indicative of a strong- 
talent for decoration. The forms are to a great extent curvilinear, and embrace 
meanders, scrolls, circles, and combinations and groupings of curved lines in great 
variety. Of rectilinear forms, lozenges, guilloches, zigzags, and checkers are best 
known. 

The decided prevalence of curved form is worthy of remark. With all their fer- 
tility of invention the inhabitants of this valley seem never to have achieved the 
rectangular links meander, or anything more nearly approaching it than the current 
scrcdl or the rectangular guilloche, while other peoples, such as the Pueblos of the 
Southwest and the ancient nations of Mexico and Peru, found in it a chief resource. 

Mr. C. C. Willoughl)y, of the Peabody Museum, Cambridge, Massa- 
chusetts, has i)ublished in the Journal of American Folk-Lore ' "An 
Analysis of the Decorations upon Pottery from the Mississippi Yalley." 
It consists of V2 pages, with 21 figures, and represents the different 
motifs said .to have been employed in the decorations upon pottery 
from the locality indicated. The similarities alleged are not always 
])erceptible and the arguments based thereon are not always logical, 
but great latitude is permissible in such subjects. 

Bronze Age. 

It is not the intention of the author to attempt any description of 
the antiquity, origin, technology, or industry of the prehistoric people 
during the Bronze age. This would carry us into the realms of archae- 
ology, while we have been confining ourselves to art. A few prelimi- 
nary words may, however, be useful.

^93 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

There appears to liave been a gap or hiatus between the Paleolithic 
neoples aiuUhe Neolithic peoples in their occupation of western Europe. 
There certainly were vast diflfereuces between their respective cultures, 
•xud it has been believed there was a solution of the continuity of occu- 
pation in western Europe between these two epochs.' 

Since the discoveries of Judge Piette^ in sundry caverns of southern 
and western France; of MM. Boule and Oartailhac Mn the Grotto of 
Reilhac (Lot), and the observations of M. Solomon Remaeh^ on the 
^^Femme nue:^ discovered in the caverns of Mentone by M. Julien, the 
hiatus between the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods has been contro- 
verted and is not now regarded nearly so certain as formerly. 

The contrary appears between the Neolithic and Bronze ages, at least 
for western Europe, where the introduction of bronze and its subse- 
quent use for weapons and implements seems to have occurred among 
the same peoples. The advent of bronze for these purposes was by 
immioration or introduction from some other country, and the peoples 
(stilHn western Europe) who used it this year i)robably were the same 
as used the stone implements last year. Therefore the introduction 
of bronze, while it made changes in their implements and so wrought 
changes in their mechanical ability, yet had comparatively small 
influence upon their ai't. 

We have already shown the differences between the art of the Paleo- 
lithic period and that of the Neolithic period; we have also shown how, 
in the Neolithic period, the art was confined to the merest decorations 
of objects, and that it consisted principally of geometric designs. 
Plates 19 and 20 are again referred to as giving an extended represen- 
tation of the kinds and styles of ornamentation employed. 

The decorative art of the Bronze age was but a continuation of that of 
the Neolithic period, and it is not impossible that an investigation into 
the origin of son)e of the specimens in plates 19 and 20 would show 
them to have belonged to the Bronze age; that is to say, the styles of 
ornamentation of the two periods or ages were practically the same, 
and the latter was but a continuation of the former, wnth such possible 
changes or additions as would naturally grow. The marked difference 
between the two ages was the substitution of bronze for stone in the 
material for cutting and piercing implements. 

The question continually arises whence and how was bronze intro- 
duced into western Europe. Of course the answer is lost in anti(iuity, 
for there are no records. There is not, and from the nature of the 
case there can not be, any direct or positive testimony. We can de- 
pend only upon the evidence furnished by prehistoric archaeology. 
Many theories have been propounded, none of which have proved

entirely acceptable. The most general one is that bronze came from 
the far East, i^robably from the countries around the Straits of Malacca, 
and that it belonged to a period relating to the early Aryan dispersions. 
Bronze is one of the great epoch-making discoveries, greater than that 
of iron, and as a practical agent of prehistoric civilization, equaled only 
by the bow and arrow. 

The discovery of the fusion of copper and tin, both comparatively 
soft metals, in the proportions of 90 and 10 per cent, making a new 
metal, harder than any other then known, capable of being cast, and 
when cast capable of being made sharp and holding a cutting edge, was 
a great step in human culture, and calculated to revolutionize the des- 
tiny of the human race. 

STYLES OF DECORATION. 

Plates 57 and 58 represent the art work done on various weapons and 
implements of bronze. Plate 57 represents sword handles, while phite 
58 represents principally knives and scabbards. Articles of dress and 
for personal adornment, like bracelets, fibuhie torques or ceintures, 
and similar objects, were made of bronze. These need not be displayed, 
for they all bear the same general style or type of art decoration. These 
will show that the decoration consisted principally of geometric designs, 
and will demonstrate the similarity of the decoration and art work in 
the Bronze age to that of the Neolithic period. 

The Bronze age had no existence in the Western Hemisphere during 
prehistoric times. All objects of bronze found among the aborigines 
are believed to have come from Europe. 

COPPER IN AMERICA. 

Many objects of wrought copper have been found in America. The 
Lake Superior copper mines in the States of Wisconsin and Michigan 
appear to have been the center of manufacture, from which the distribu- 
tion took place, and thence the manufactured implements spread, in 
gradually decreasing numbers, in every direction throughout the present 
territory of the eastern United States. The modes of treating copper, 
whether by smelting, melting, casting, or hammering, and if any or all 
of these, what amount of heating or melting was done, has never been 
fully investigated nor have they been satisfactorily determined. Some 
of the objects were certainly of virgin copper hammered cold, and they 
were thus made into bracelets, rings, and similar objects of personal 
adornment, and also into axes, knives, and spearheads. These copper 
weapons and ornaments continued to be used contemporaneously with 
cutting implements of stone and of ornaments of shell and bone. 

The author is well aware of the contention that there was in Europe 
a Copper age intermediate between the Neolithic and Bronze ages, and 
he has visited and examined the national collection in the city of 
Berne, Switzerland, which contains the greatest proportion of copper 



500 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

objects, and has furnished the principal basis for the argument of the 
existence there of a Copper a.i;e. No argument upon this or any simi- 
lar question is attempted. The only proposition here presented is that 
copper was used in the neighborhood of Lake Superior to malie cutting 
implements of similar form to those of stone, and that, despite the num- 
bers of such implements found, copper did not change the culture of 
the peoples; it did not establish a Copper age as bronze established a 
Bronze age in Europe; it was not an epoch-making discovery or inven- 
tion, and the mode of making and using stone implements by chipping 
and polishing, as in the purely Neolithic age, was not superseded by 
the discovery of copper. 

Among the many mysteries of prehistoric archaeology growing out 
of mound excavation in the United States, wherein things strange and 
wonderful but of undoubted genuineness and antiquity are found, 
none are more unexplained than the thin sheets of copper wrought by 
repousse work into curious and unknown devices found in mounds and 
earthworks in widely separated regions of the country. 

Etowah plates. — The principal specimens come from the Tumlin 
mounds on the Etowah River, near Cartersville, Georgia (Plates 59, 00). 
They have been figured in the reports of the Bureau of Ethnology^ and 
in the author's paper on "The Swastika."- Of these specimens the 
X)rincipal comment made by Professor Thomas is in approval of that 
of Professor Holmes,' that "in all their leading features the designs 
themselves are suggestive of Mexican or Central American work." Yet 
he adds that- 

Theie are one or two features which are anomalous in Mexican or Central Ameri- 
can designs, as, for example, where the wings are represented as rising from the back 
of the shoulders. The two plates are a comhinntion of Mexican and Central American 
designs, the graceful limbs and the ornaments of the arms, legs, waist, and top of the 
head are ^Central American, and the rest, with the exception, possibly, of what is 
carried in the right hand, are Mexican. 

Professor Thomas continues : 

That these plates are not wholly the work of the Indians inhabiting the southern 
section of the United States, is admitted; that they were not made by an aboriginal 
artisan of Central America or Mexico of ante-Columbian times, I think is probable, 
if not from the designs themselves, from the apparent evidence that the work was 
done in part with hard metallic tools. 

To the latter conclusion the author does not agree. The proposition 
may be true, but there is no evidence of it.

HopeioeU mound art. — The 
Hojiewell mound, near Chilli- 
cothe, Koss County, Ohio, 
was excavated by Prof. War- 
ren K. Moorehead for the 
benefit of the Department of 
Ethnology at the World's 
Columbian Exposition, Chi- 
cago. It was an immense con- 
strnction, 530 feet long, 250 
feet wide, with an original 
height of 32 feet, but when 
opened was only 16 or 18 feet 
to its original foundation. 
A considerable number of 
elaborately wrought copper 
objects were found at or near 
the bottom of the mound and 
in the center. Plate 01 rep- 
resents most of these. All 
were tlat, thin, smooth, 
though not polislied, and had 
been cuit into the various de- 
signs as rei)resented. One 
of the objects is the swastika, 
of which five specimens were 
found; the rest were mostly 
geometric designs cut out of 
thin* copper plates as shown. There were no engravings or repousse 
work on any of the copper objects found, witli the exception of one, a 
si)ool or pulley-shaped ornament which was hammered and crimped 
as shown in fig. 153. Two other objects were found in copper, and are 
proper to be introduced on account of their art. Plate 62 represents

a limnan skull with a unique head covering made principally of copper. 

It consisted of a large sheet 16 or 18 inches long, intended to be bent 

over the head, from the edges of which, 
about the center on either side, sprang 
a pair of imitation elk horns, as shown 
in the plate. They were not real elk 
horns, but had been carved out of wood 
to represent elk horns. The wood of the 
horns was entirely covered with thin 
sheet copper neatly and artistically 
placed so as to have tbe appearance of 
solid copper, and it was not until after a 
considerable examination that their real 
character was detected. The antlers 
were 213 inches high and 19 inches across 
the upper points. Plate 63 represents 
another object of a similar tyjie from the 
same mound ; it also is a copper head 
dress with two short rounded horns 
springing from the top as shown. They 
were also covered, but the copper had 
been broken from the top of the two 

horns, leaving the naked wood i^rojecting. These latter figures are 

unique, and their right to a presentation in a pai^er on art lies in the excel- 
lence of the mechanical execution, 

and the difficulty of performing it. 

No one who has insjiected these 

objects, and who considers all to 

have been aboriginal savage work, 

but would admit them to a place 

in a paper on prehistoric art. 
Found in the same mound, and 

associated with the foregoing ob- 
jects, was a piece of human bone 

(femur) which bore an engraved 

design, which is here rejDroduced

olooy Many aboriginal carvings and engravings on bone were found 
during tlieir excavation. Figs. 251-253 in "The Swastika" ' represent 
variously carved birds and animals from these mounds. Other spec- 
iuicns were found, mostly in fragments, of which Mr. Bennett, the 
artist of the expedition, says: 

These carved traceries or engravings upon bone, even in fragmentary state, evince 
an artistic aptibu.le mucli beyond the mineral and vegetable stain, and, by their almost 
microscoric delicacy of execution and nnfaltering precision of line work, show a high 
de-ree of manual skill. Though some are undoubtedly portions of barbaric and 
desultory design and unsystematic application of indefinite ideas, others l^espeak a 
clearly conceived idea, a definite 
motive and vigorous execution, not 
inferior to the predominant motives 
of early Mediterranean decorative 
art. 

They are clearly not of an illus- 
trative or imitative design, either 
realistic or conventional, but cre- 
ated design, fouuded on purely me- 
chanical motive with good concep- 
tion; and it is regrettable that no 
complete examples remain to correct 
artistic valuation of the purpose of 
the whole. - 

The recent excavations by 
Mr. Clarence B. Moore in the 
Florida sand mounds brought 
to light several of these thin 

copper j)lates with curious de- 
signs wrought upon them.' 

The United States National 

Museum j^ossesses a number 

from various States in the 

central United States. The 

designs, however, are not of 

the same character as most of 

the foregoing. They do not 

represent human or animal figures, but tend to lines, dots, concentric 

rings, and designs more or less geometric.

EUROPE. 

Brittany, — The use of gold can be traced in 
western France through the Neolithic period, 
principally in the form of collars and bracelets. 
Fig. 155 represents one of these collars. It was 
found in one of the dolmens of Koc'h-Guyon or 
Eondessec, at Plouhainel-Carnac (Morbihan). 
The discoverer was M. Lebail, the keeper of the 
hotel at Plouharnel, where the author spent some 
months at various times in prehistoric investiga- 
tions, visiting this monument upon sundry occas- 
ions. The ornament is native gold, about an inch 
and a half in width, and cut longitudinally into a 
dozen strips extending one-third the way round. 
This might have been done by a sharp flint, used 
chisel and not saw fashion. There were two of 
these collars, each weighing about 140 grams. 
They had been intentionally deposited in a rude 
pottery vase with cinders, ashes, and charcoal, 
which had been walled up in one corner of the 
chamber. 




One of the 
collars was 
sold to M.

While it is not asserted tluit tlic working of gold was carried on 

in the Neolithic period, yet the fore- 
going patterns are ditfereut from most 

of those of the Bronze age. Many, 

apparently belonging to the Bronze 

age, are- simply round rods or bars of 

gold of sufBcient length to encircle 

the wrist, and which have been bent 

to that form (lig. 157). Others have 

been made into tliiu sheets, crimped 

around the edges (fig. 158). Both these 

styles are identical with the bronze bracelets, and the places in whicli 

they were found and the objects 
with which they were associated 
concur in their assignment to the 
Bronze age. There are also many 
objects in gold — tor(j[nes and brace- 
lets — which show a different method 
of Avorking, and are sui)p()sed to 
have been of later date. Some were 
round, heavy, decorated, marked 
with zigzag, herringbone, clievron, 
etc. (fig. 159, a, b), some of them 
after the fashion of a coil of ro])e 
(fig. IGO, o, d), in others the ends 
were hammered square and enlarged 
(fig. IGO, />, 0). 

Ireland. — The Archteological Mu- 
seum in Dublin is probably the rich- 
est in gold objects of any in Euroi)e. One of its attractive displays 

is a series of bracelets, running 

from extremely large to extremely 

small. They consist of a rod of gold, 

larger iu the center, tapering gradu- 
ally to the ends, but with a head 

hammered down and spread, tlie 

ends being then brought more or 

less together (fig. 161), In the 

larger of these the rod would be 

nigh half an inch thick, and from 

that down. Some are large enough 

to go over the hand and so be worn 

on the wrist, or even on the aim, 

while the smaller ones in the series 

would iK)t go on the little finger. 

The evident fact that the.*-e small ones, though practically re])ro(luctions 

of the larger, are quite too small (or any i)ossil)le use as bracelets or

rings, and tlie additional fact that in some of the countries on the west 
coast of Africa nianilhis somewhat resembling these have been used as 
currency, has caused it to be said that these were not bracelets, but 
were money, and the name of ring- money has been given to them. It 
is evident that these latter specimens behmg to later prehistoric peoples.

department of Tarn, France, by a peasant while digging in his vineyard.

accepted the kind offer of M, Cartailhac to visit the locality and inspect 
the objects. They were found at about 18 inches beneath the surface, 
just below the ordinary reach of plow or mattock, and it was only an

extraordinary and accidental stroke of the latter that showed a bril- 
liant spot at the bottom of the hole. There were evidences of prehistoric 
man in the shape of flints more or less worked, fragments of pottery 
and bits of charcoal, but none had any particular relation to the gold 
objects. They were not protected by box or inclosure in any way. It 
will be seen from their work that they had been highly decorated, 
made in repouss6, and soldered together. The details of the orna- 
ments (fig. 161, a, h, c) and the mode of fastening (fig. 165, a, b, c) evince 
a fair degree of civilized mechanical skill in their execution. 

Golden cinctures have been lately (1893) found at Goutras, and are 
now in the Museum of Bordeaux. They are simply twisted coils with 
large button-like ends. Industrially they resemble those from Laisse- 
graisse, but artistically, they are nuich inferior. They were found en 
cache, forming part of the stock of a goldsmith or a mint worker, com- 
prising about four hundred pieces, weighing nigh 10,000 francs in gold.

The North American Indian does 
not, during prehistoric times, ap- 
pear to have worked or used gold 
or silver for either ornament or 
utility. There have been a few 
pieces of silver found within the 
district occupied by him, but all, 
either from their association or 
mode of manufacture, have sug- 
gested European influence. The 
pieces of gold found within this dis- 
trict are much fewer in number and 
are subject to the same leinark. 

Whatever criticism or denial may be made of the foregoing 
ments in the interest of civilization or technology, yet it stands 
cally true in its relation to art work.

512 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 



111. PREHISTORIC MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS/ 

Music is a dnalisui. It is formed of the conjunction of two elements ; the one purely 
musical, the other poetical; the one sensuous, the other spiritual or intellectual; 
the one owing its origin and development to instruments and based on the mere 
animal dcdight in sound, the other owing its origin and development to language 
and based on the fusion of the emotional and intellectual sides of man's nature.- 

It lias been asserted that the origin of vocal music was coeval with 
that of language, and that the construction of musical instruments 
dates with the earliest inventions suggested by human ingenuity. 
Those who make these assertions do so simi)ly upon theory, and when 
pressed for their authority would be compelled to admit that actual 
knowledge or information upon the subject does not exist. What can 
be affirmed is that sound made by the prehistoric man of the earliest 
epoch might have been rhythmic and so possessed one of the elements 
of nuisic. The other elements — melody, dynamics, and harmony — fol- 
lowed in the course of civilization, among some people at a faster and 
among others at a slower rate. 

Vocal sounds are incapable in themselves of i^erpetuation. When 
the vibrations made by the human voice have ceased, the incident is 
closed and the evidence lost. It is, therefore, in the absence of any 
written testimony, impossible to identify the practice, or even the exist- 
ence, of vocal music in prehistoric times. We are driven to an exclu- 
sive consideration of musical instruments, and if these should fail us, 
we would be without evidence. 

Miss Fletcher '^ says : 

As to the birth of musical instruments, I can not even touch upon the raison d'rtre 
of their invention, but T may call attention to their controlling influence; they have 
become at length master of the man who made them. There is no race or people 
possessing a theory of music who have not been indebted to musical instruments for 
the means by which their theory has been worked out. * " ^ Before the instru- 
ment had been evolved and man could listen objectively to his music, during the 
long period when his voice w^as his only mode of expressicm, his mind was not stim- 
ulated to make observations upon the relations of one to the other. He may be said 
to have xiossessed no conscious method and to have followed no known or accepted 
artiticial rules of composition of his song. 

This relates entirely to prehistoric times, and its author accepts 
musical instruments as the only means of perpetuating the sounds so 
tliey can be reproduced and studied. 

'Much of the material descriptive of prehistoric musical instruments and their 
scales in the Western Hemisphere contained in this chapter was prepared by Mr. 
VI. P. Ilpham, assistant in the division of Prehistoric Archaeology to whom credit 
as joint author should be given.

PREHISTORIC ART. 513 

It is the iuteution in this cliapter to leave aside all speculation as to 
tlie, origin, theory, practice, philosophy, and poetry of music, and to 
deal only with nuisic as one of the fine arts of prehistoric times; the 
study thereof to be based upon such knowledge as is obtainable from 
prehistoric musical instruments. 

There have been some students, even some ])rofessors, who, wiser 
than their own generation, declare music to be a manifestation of an 
innate principle in man. The author does not contrndict the proposi- 
tion, but he denies the knowledge and authority of these wise men who 
say so. 

While the proposition may be true, yet the statement is valueless, 
because it is only the assertion of these gentlemen, the truth of which 
they do not know. It is, on their part, theoretical, and an assumption 
which should be proved before being stated as a fact. It is a priori 
argument, and as such is vicious. Investigation has demonstrated that 
similar assumptions have been erroneous. Illustrations of this can be 
shown in the life history of Paleolithic man, deduced from discovery. 
Xo person Avould be justified in the assumption, without proof, that the 
man who lived in caves and aiiparently had uo more notion of civili- 
zation than the wild beasts with which he disputed the possession 
thereof, who knew only to use stone implements, and these made sharp 
by chipping, and who did not know to rub one stone against another 
to make it either smooth or sharp — no person would be justified in 
assuming that this man was capable of making artistic designs repre- 
senting almost the entire fauna of his district; yet in an earlier j)ortion 
of this paper we have seen that he did this thing. It has been said or 
assumed, without knowledge for foundation, that man in his earliest 
condition had an appreciation of the rhythmic character of music; but, 
in opi^osition to this, we will show that this same Paleolithic man, who 
developed an artistic taste in such high degree, had no taste for and 
did not emjdoy even the rhythmic principle of music. The most we 
have found of his ability in this direction was the simple whistle, made 
from the phalange of the reindeer (p. 524). While it is not impossible 
that this might have been used in cadence and for rhythmic represen- 
tation, yet there is no known fact on which to base the belief. No 
reason has been given, and I take it no reason can be given, for these 
manifestations on the part of the early man in fiivor of one kind of art 
and not of another kind. This becomes less subject to the a priori 
theory herein denounced when we consider that to a large extent the 
contrary appears in the higher civilization of the Neolithic period, ^vhich 
follows the Paleolithic. 

The object of this ])aragraph is to protest against the a priori method 
of argument so often used by the student or professor who, studying 
or knowing the instincts or capabilities of modern man, argues there- 
from that man in a ^tate of nature did the same. It is not deuied

514 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

that oue people may liave developed its culture in one direction and 
uot in another, even retrograded in some respects while they advanced 
in others, but no person is justified in assuming that, because one 
])rimitive people developed their civilization in a particular direction, 
therefore all peoples did the same. The unity of human develop- 
ment and civilization is a myth. AVe have but to look over the mod- 
ern Avorld and to compare the peoples of historic times, some of them 
of high civilization, to demonstrate this want of unity. It is sufficient 
as an illustration to cite the different families of the Aryan race, which 
originally had a single stock of language if they did not have a single 
stock of blood ; then comx^are these families together and note the dif- 
ferences in their civilization, the Greeks with the Eomans, and they 
with the Celts, and the Celts with the Goths, and so on to the Lets and 
the Slavs, and all these with the Zends and Persians. If this compar- 
ison be somewhat difficult and not apparent at a glance, we may take 
the descendants of these various peoples as they exist at the present 
time; compare not simply the Latins with the Germanic peoples, but 
the Latins with themselves; the differences between Italy and France, 
and of France with Spain, or the ancient Saxon with the Anglo-Saxon 
of England. These differences are almost as great as though there 
never had been any relation between them; almost as great as it is 
between these Aryan x)eoples and the Semitic, between whom there 
has never been any racial relation. These differences apply to their 
fundamental civilization and ramify through every fiber of the respec- 
tive bodies politic. In sociology the distinctions in religion, mar- 
riage, government, law, inheritance, is as great between Italy, France, 
and Spain on the one hand, and Germany, Holland, and England on 
the other, as it is between either or all these and the same institu- 
tions in China and Japan. He would be a poor historian who, pro- 
ceeding upon the theory of the similarity of human nature, and having 
written a history of any one of the nations and peoples just men- 
tioned, should assume that, therefore, he was in possession of knowledge 
of the sociologic conditions of any other. It is useless to continue this 
argument. Its only puri^ose has been to enter a protest against 
this method of reasoning when applied to the prehistoric peojiles of 
whom our only knowledge consists of such monuments, tombs, resi- 
dence sites, implements, utensils, and objects as have been or may be 
found on or in the earth. 

Ehythm was the first element of music. The drum and the rattle of 
the savage give forth but one tone, and all their music consists in strokes 
or shakes, repeated at greater or less intervals of time and with more 
or less regularity and force. The earliest prehistoric whistles gave 
but a single note, but were afterwards increased to two and five notes, 
and while they could increase the force they were scarcely able to 
make a melody except of the most simple kind. Brums and rattles 



PREHISTORIC ART. 515 

migbt have had a different pitch and have given different notes, but 
there is nothino- to show that they were intentional!}^ so. It is much 
more probabk' that they were made to produce tones of strength, clear- 
ness, sweetness, etc. When prehistoric man understood and attempted 
to make melody he had advanced one grade in culture. 

Frequent attempts have been made to give written representations 
of the rude music heard among savage or barbarous nations, but these 
should always be received with distrust, not so much from want of con- 
fidence in the observers as from want of accurate representation of 
sounds heard. The usual practice is to try to write the sounds accord- 
ing to our modern musical notation, but it must be borne in mind that 
this notation only corresponds with our own peculiar scale, which 
has no signs to represent other sounds. Hence, when we see the 
chants of a savage tribe expressed in our notation we should not take it 
for granted that they actually used the intervals of our scale. We can 
only assume that the observer wrote something as nearly like what he 
heard as he could find means of expression. 

In the music of savage tribes they used a few sounds, differing in 
pitch, but in most cases there is no sufficient reason to believe that 
these sounds correspond, as regards their gradations, with any regu- 
lar musical system. To get traces of such a system we must look to 
Xieoples more civilized, and we soon find not only a considerable advance 
in the knowledge of the sounds used, but, what is of more importance, 
a more accurate definition of them. This definition is aided when, as 
often happens, they have introduced musical instruments with fixed 
tones. 

There has been much speculation among iihilosophers and scientists 
as to the origin of music. Charles Darwin, Herbert Spencer, Letour- 
neau, De ^lortillet, and others agree that music originated with the 
cry of the human voice, and that it developed from vocal noises. 
Letourneau continues the simile by suggesting that the noises of nature 
were the originators of musical instruments. The others treat of vocal 
music, and their investigations and theories are devoted almost exclu- 
sively to an explanation of its origin. Darwin and Spencer differed as 
to the particular class of vocal noises which served as the origin of 
music. Darwin attributed it to the amatory class, that is, those sounds 
which the male makes during the excitements of courtship and in order 
to charm the female, and he thought that not only love music, but 
nuisic in general was the resulting combination of these sounds. Spen- 
cer disagreed Avith the latter reason and was of the opinion that music 
had its germs in the sound which the voice emits under excitement, and 
that it eventually obtained its particular character according to the 
kind of excitement. Darwin, true to his development theory, believed 
that "the vocal organs were primarily used and perfected in relation to 
the propagation of the species." Spencer, agreeing to the excitement

of love as a partial cause, extends it to include all other excitements 
to which animal feelings are susceptible. 

The infantile cry, which it is said was the origin of music, has been 
reduced to writing and ]>]accd in the form of notes on the staff.

IIILD CRYINC; 



Rossini, in his opera of " Semiraniide," introduced into one of the 
choruses with great effect the cries and squeals of a party of chihlren. 

As the human cry grew it changed to represent passion, and possi- 
bly by ouomatopes it became articulate and so grew into language. 
With this came modulations of the voice, and Didero, with the others, 
says the cry of an animal in passion was the fundamental princijde 
of music. Some animals, especially birds, have the power of music 
without language, but it is claimed tliat they can express by their 
music the same sentiments of passion as does man. It has, therefore, 
been declared that music does not belong exclusively to man, and it is 
certain that it exists among animals independent of articulate lan- 
guage. An observing student of nature, Mr. A. T. Canulen Pratt,^ has 
reduced some of the cries of our domestic animals to form, and has 
written them out in music.

Modem musical works not infrequently reproduce the songs of birds. 
''Listen to the nightingule" is an illustration which, however, only 
serves to show the superiority of the bird over his brother animal, man. 
The lark, the blackbird, the thrush, all have their songs, which, repeated 
again and again, are recoguizable and known of all men, while the 
canary, the mocking bird, and the catbird sing not only their natural 
songs, but can be taught to sing many variations, if not to execute 
entirely new melodies. The author has seen a jjiece of music set to 
imitate a cackling hen aud crowing cock, and all the world remembers 
Ole Bull's " Barnyard orchestra," as played on his violin. Darwiu 
reports to have heard a gibbon which modulated his voice to the extent 
of an octave, aud, according to Savage, the black chimpanzee {Troglo- 
dytes niger) gathers in troops at certain places aud gives musical con- 
certs by striking wood of various kinds — that is to say, trees standing, 
logs lying, or branches spreading — with a rod or pole, keeping time and 
forming a sort of melody or harmony of the different tones emitted 
from the object struck. If this be true these would seem to be musicians 
in the lowest scale and this to have been the most primitive nmsical 
instrument. 

Musical instruments of percussion are the most simple, and the 
theory has been accordingly announced that they were the first to 
have been invented— that is, they were the earliest factors in human 
culture, and the first to bo used among primitive peoples. The next in 
order of complexity, and accordingly iu order of invention and evolu- 
tion, were wind instruments. Rowbotham ' divides them into types, of 
which his representatives are the drum, the pipe, ami the lyre. Under

the first liead fall rattles, gongs, triangles, tani-tanis, castanets, tam- 
bourines, cymbals, all instruments of percussion; under the second 
head fall flageolets, flutes, hautboys, clarionets, bassoons, bugles, all 
wind instruments; under the third head fall all stringed instruments. 
He makes these typos representatives of three distinct stages of devel- 
opment, through which, in the order named, he says, all prehistoric 
music has passed. "As in the geologic history of the globe the chalk 
is never found below the oolite, nor the oolite below the coal, so in the 
musical history of mankind is the lyre stage never found to precede 
the pipe stage, nor the pipe stage to precede the drum stage. In keep- 
ing with this is the fact that the savages sometimes have the drums 
alone, but never the pipe alone, or the lyre alone, for if they have the 
pipe they have the drum too, and if they have the lyre they always 
have both the pipe and drum." 

Pursuing this idea, Rowbotham ^ devotes many pages to descriptions 
of " savages," who are in the respective stages of ninsical culture just 
described, and he gives the author or book from which he has obtaine I

He says in his appendix (A), page 185: 

I had prepared a catalogue of the African tribes with Avhich wo are acquainted, to 
discover whctlier the ahsencc of stringed instruments iirevailed in the center, the 
north, or in what direction it nught l>e, of the continent. * " "* But this tabula- 
tion I was obliged to discard, owing to the conflicting accounts of travelers; and, 
Avithout endeavoring to trace the topography of the instruments, let us be content 
with the broad assertion that most of the tribes of Africa are in the lyre stage, and 
some are prematurely in it; that is to say, they are unacquainted with the use of 
pipes, which, in all strictness, should have preceded the knowledge of strings. 

And he acknowledges his perplexity: 

We have found that the lyre belongs to a very high stage of human development. 
We have found it in the hands of barbarians who Avere just emerging into civiliza- 
tion; yet in Africa Ave find it known to the most degraded savages. 

This statement by Kowbothani throws doubt upon the correctness of 
his assumed order of development. 

The collections of musical instruments in the United States National 
Museum and in the Eoyal Conservatory of Music in Brussels seem to 
verify his statement of the prevalence of the lyre among certain tribes 
of Africa where the pipe, or pipe and drum, are absent. 

All this goes to show the dift'ereuce between theory and fact, and is 
complimentary to Mr. Eowbotham in recognizing it. 

Wallaschek wrote ^ after Eowbotham, and assailed strongly his theory 
of tlireefold development of aboriginal musical instruments. He denied 
the drum to have been the earliest or first invented, and asserted that 
which is demonstrated in this i^aper, that Avind instruments (whistles, 
flageolets, and horns) were first invented and antedated drums. He 
reversed Rowbotham's order of simplicity and argued that the lyre or 
harp of Africa, formed as it might have been from a bent twig or the 
two branches of a tree with a string stretched taut between the ends, 
was not only more primitive and easier and quicker made, but, as con- 
fessed by Eowbotham in his appendix, it was in fact invented and in 
use among the most degraded savages of the country; that it spread 
over a large portion of the continent of Africa before the pipe or drum, 
and that it was in use among many other tribes in connection with 
pipes, but without drums. He cites the fact that the shepherd boy 
can with ease and in a short time, while tending his flocks, make, with 
the aid only of his pocketknife, a willow whistle, which is not ditficult 
to be transformed into a flageolet of considerable musical scale; while 
all drums, so far as known, among primitive peoples, Avhether prehis- 
toric, as shown in this paper, or modern, as among iDrimitive or savage 
peoples, are machines or instruments of considerable complexity, requir- 
ing labor and thought, with much preparation, in order to perfect them. 
The log must be hollowed and wrought out, and is usually decorated 
in a more or less elaborate manner (fig. 233). The skin drum requires 
the preparation of the hoop and then of the skin, both of which require

considerable thought and time and can never be made impromptu or for 
an emergency. 

Wallaschek declares that, both for sin]])licity and. ease of manufac- 
ture, the pipe and lyre are m advance of the drum, and that the dis- 
coveries in antiquity and investigations in ethnograpliy show them 
to have come earliest into use among both prehi.storic and primitive 
])eoples, and adds: 

I (Jill lind nothing but speculative reasons and common eonsent fortliodrnm being 
regarded as tlie most ancient instrument. 

He continues {p. 87) his investigations among the various tribes and 
nations of primitive and savage jieoples to demonstrate the error of 
Ivowbotham's proposition and to show that the use of the pijte and 
lyre — that is to say, of wind and stringed instruments, without the 
drum — is quite as frequent and prevalent as is the contrary. 

The authors are aware of the mass of literature on the science and 
practice of music, how historians and discoverers of primitive or savage 
]ieoples have reported, in many volumes, the music they have heard 
and the instruments with which it was made. These have not been 
followed nor any of their theories adopted. The sociologic or scientitic 
sides of music among primitive or ancient peoples have been avoided. 
The authors have contented themselves with a description of preliis- 
toric instruments and of such notes or tones as could be produced by 
tlieir manipulation. 

It was reserved for the white race to develop in times of antiquity 
tlie true art of music as it is understood at the present time, but the 
diherent nations composing this race have varied much in their notions 
as to the solution of the problem. 

The Egyptians made music which, judging by the representations left 
of their musical performances and instruments, had considerable extent 
and variety. The exact nature of it can only be made out by ingenious 
inferences, and historians are at issue about their significance. It seems 
clear, however, that they acknowledged the octave, and that it was 
largely subdivided. 

The music of the Chaldeans, Babylonians, and Phenicians may be 
assumed to have been of a similar character, the octave being also 
traced among them. Assyrian bas reliefs on monuments dating from 
1000 B. C. represent musical instruments which must have been older, 
and possibly many centuries older, than the monuments on which they 
appear. Carl Engel ' shows the intervals of the huayra puhara- of the 
ancient Peruvians. Instruments of this kind, of reed or stone, have 
been found in ancient tombs. One in the British Museum has a double 
row of reed pipes, of which one is open below and the other closed. 

The Hebrews attached great importance to their music, but there 
appears no means of getting any definite information as to its tonalitv.

522 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

The music of tlie Arabs seems to involve extraordinary complica- 
tions, and lias furnished endless occupation for musical historians and 
theorists. The most interesting fact in regard to it is that the principal 
intervals of our scale, namely, the octave and fifth, were also the most 
important intervals with them. But the resemblance ended here, for 
their octave was divided into sixteen, or, according to some authors, 
into seventeen parts, and these not always equal, so that their music 
must have been very different from anything we are accustomed to. 
Sanscrit literature contains traces of a musical system in India some 
three thousand years old, which is still cultivated there. They have 
also the octavo division, which is subdivided theoretically into twenty- 
two parts. Their practical scale consists of seven degrees, among 
which the twenty-two theoretical intervals are unequally divided. The 
notes in the iisable scale admit of many changes, forming distinct 
modes, and the system generally has many analogies with that of the 
Greeks. It is worthy of remark, however, that, judging by the frets 
on their i)rincipal stringed instruments, the subdivision of the octave 
by the fifth and fourth is acknowledged. 

Another Aryan branch, the Persian, interests us because, so far as 
the early history of nations can be made out, their music seems to have 
been the remote ancestor of our own. The Aryans of Persia, like those 
of India, had originally a liking for minute intervals of sound, for they 
divided the octave into twenty-four parts. 

It is through the known migrations of tliese races westward, and 
particularly into Greece, that their connection with our music is gene- 
alogically established. It is believed that, under the name Pelasgians, 
they settled in Asia Minor and in Greece some two thousand years 
before the Christian era, and their descendants or relatives, Lydians 
and Phrygians, afterwards mixed with other colonists, such as the 
Dorians, iEolians, lonians, and Etruscans, who exercised considerable 
influence on their manners and customs. 

The early history of Greek music is enveloped in obscurity. The 
Greeks had a most elaborate system of meter and rhythm, but it 
belonged chiefly to their poetry. The principal way in which they 
applied the idea of time to music was by making the duration of the 
sounds of unequal lengths correspond to the measures in their poetry, 
so that in singing, the long syllables should be sung to long notes and 
the short syllables to shorter notes. This was natural, but there is 
evidence that the idea was carried further, as signs for unequal length 
of notes existed in music unaccompanied by poetry, thus coming a little 
nearer to our modern notation. The earliest indications of a regular 
system of music are found in the little that is said of the poet musician 
Olympus, a Pelasgian by origin. He is believed to have lived during 
the twelfth century B. C., and is of some importance in history, as cer- 
tain Greek authors and modern philologists ascribe to him the intro- 
duction into Grecian music of the so-called Enharmonic system. Others 



PREHISTORIC ART. 523 

ascribe it to the younger Olympus five hundred years later. A bas- 
relief in the Albani Villa at Rome shows Pan teaching Olympus to 
play the syrinx. It is represented in Baumann's History of Music' 

A great change is supposetl to have been brought about among the 
Pelasgians by the entrance of the foreign colonists before mentioned. 
The influence of these people, more heroic and energetic, was to do 
away with the delicate estimation of sounds and to hriug about arrange- 
ments in which the intervals were larger. nen(!e came into vogue cer- 
tain musical forms which took the names of the peoi^le to whom they 
were due, and tliree of these, namely, the Dorian, Phrygian, and Lydian, 
took at a later date a permanent ])lace in the Greek system, and gave 
corresponding varieties of character to the music, the influence of which 
has been perpetuated to our own day. 

About a century after Terpander came Pythagoras, whose genius as 
a philosopher enabled him not only to effect great improvements in the 
capabilities of music, but to establish for the art a definite and scien- 
tific basis intelligible for all time. He was, indeed, the founder of 
theoretical music, for it was he who first traced the laws which govern 
the relations of sounds to each other, and by this means brought music 
within the domain of natural i)hilosophy. He established the principle 
that intervals could be appreciated intellectually by the aid of numbers 
instead of as formerlj', by the ear alone. " Sense," he said, " is an uncer- 
tain guide; numbers can not fail." Pythagoras effected this by means 
of the stretched strings used for the lyre. He had acuteness enough 
to perceive the fundamental fact that the length of the string might be 
made to supply an exact definition of the pitch of the note it sounded. 
Hence he was enabled to attach to each sound a certain numerical 
value, and thus to compare it with other sounds and to establish posi- 
tive and definite relations between them. The instrument which Pytha- 
goras used in these investigations was called a canon, and appears to 
have been similar to our mouochord. 

The importance of this step, connecting for the first time music and 
mathematics, can hardly be overrated, and as the method Pythagoras 
introduced has become verified and established, in use by all subsequent 
experience and investigation, he is fairly entitled to be called the 
"father of musical science." Out of his investigations the Diatonic 
scale grew into being. Euclid (B. 0. 300), about two hundred and fifty 
years after Pythagoras, describes the formula and gives the proportion- 
ate length of string corresponding to the various notes of the scale, a 
mode of determination quite conclusive. 

Other elements have been added, but the Diatonic scale has remained 
essentially unchanged. As the series of notes was when Euclid de- 
scribed it, so it is now, and as it formed the basis of Greek melodies 
two thousand years ago, so it forms the basis of the music of the pres- 
ent day.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 



EUROrE. 



rALEOLITHIC AGE. 

Lartet and Christy found prehistoric whistles in the cavern of Lau- 
gerie Basse, in the Dordogne District, France. They also found whis- 
tles of the same kind in the cavern of Aurignac. It was supposed that 
both these caverns belonged to the Paleolithic period, and, therefore, 
they afforded corroborating evidence of the use of these instruments in 
that period. Later investigations rendered this certain with regard to 
Laugerie Basse, but made it uncertain with regard to xVurignac. When 
the first whistle was found, in 18G0, in Aurignac it was reserved by these 
gentlemen for this confirmation, but afterwards, when, as they say, 
there had been many discoveries of this kind of instrument, notably 
those from the Laugerie Basse, so that specimens 
are not now rare in museums and collections, they 
felt themselves justified in assuming the existence 
and use of this instrument in Paleolithic times. Fig. 
IGG represents the whistle from Laugerie Basse, 
taken from Lartet and Christy's "Eeliquia^. Aqui- 
tanica^," and is plate V, fig. 21. It is described as 
the first digital phalange of the hind foot of a rein- 
deer. A hole has been bored in its lower surface 
near the expanded upper articulation. On applica- 
tion of the lips to the hollow of this articulation, 
and blowing obliquely into the hole, they' got a sharp 
Sfmnd analogous to that produced by a cat call or a 
key used as a whistle. 

Marquis de Kadaillac^ figures a whistle of deer 
horn or reindeer phalange from the collection Mas- 
senat (Brives, France) similar to that shown in tig. IGG, 
and states that others have been found in the caverns 
of Les Eyzies, Schussenried, and Chafiaud. He continues that they 
have been found in the Belgian caverns, in the peat beds of Scania, 
southern Sweden, in the island of Palmaria. and at other points. He 
says that there have been found, in the Grotto of Cottes, the radii 
(canon) of the reindeer and auroch treated in the same manner, and 
which might have been destined for the same purpose. He tells of 
Lougperier's mention of a human bone pierced with holes at regular 
intervals, serving, by a strange irony of death, as a flute with which to 
charm the living; also of Judge Piette, who, in one of his numerous 
excavations, discovered a flute made of two bird bones which, joined, 
would make modulated tones. Similar bones were found in the collec- 
tion at Eochebertier. Beyond these he knows of none. The whistles, 
he thinks, may have been used in war or in the chase, but he expresses

uo opinion as to tlie ])robable nse of the tlutes. The chief value of his 
report is in finding the instruments. This done, with their respective 
strata and associations, they speak for themselves, and the inspector or 
examiner is as well qualified to determine their function as is their 
finder. His qualification is to be determined by his experience with 
other or similar finds, and his ability to compare them with other 
instruments. It is to be remarked that, while the first series mentioned 
above by jManjuis de Xadaillac are from caverns niostly or possibly 
Paleolithic, the remainder are i)robably Xeoli^hic, though this would 
require closer examination and greater knowledge of the locality and 
strata of their origin than is now possessed by the author. 

Furfoo/ is one of a number of prehistoric stations, many of which 
are Paleolithic, near Namur and Dinant, on the head waters of the 
Eiver Meusc. They are Justly celebrated by the excavations made 
tlierein by M. E. Dupont, the finds from which form a large proportion 
of the interesting display in the National Museum at Brussels. The 
greater number of these stations were cav- 
erns or shelters used by Paleolithic man. 
The superimposed strata in these caverns 
indicate with great certainty and satisfaction 
the chronological as well as the cultural se- 
quence of their occupation by man. In one 
of these caverns, and in a stratum believed to 
have been formed during the occupation by 
Paleolithic man, was found the celebrated terracotta whistle, bird- 
pottery vase, in fragments, which has been shaped, bronze age.

eum, and which has figured so extensively 

in the determination by prehistoric anthropologists that, while man did 
not make or use pottery during the Paleolithic period in France, he 
did in Belgium. In this station at Furfooz has been found, in what 
stratum I am not able to say, nor even do I know jwsitively in which cav- 
ern, but quoted from the Annals of the Societc Archa^ologique of ISTamur^ 
as having been found ^'dans les bains voisins de laforteresse,'''' a whistle 
of white clay, (en terre blanche) (fig. 1G7), in the form of a bird, the 
mouthpiece of which was in the tail and the venthole in the belly, as 
seen in the figure. Another whistle, said to have been found in the 
phosphate beds at Mesvin near Mons, Belgium, and claimed to have 
been paleolithic, is in the possession of M. Leon Somzee of Brussels. 

The question will immediately arise whether these were really musical 
instruments. It has been suggested that they were for calls or signals 
and may have been used, as the boatswain does his whistle, to direct 
the movements of men at a distance. This would not be music, and if 
they were always thus used they would not be musical instruments; 
but if, on the other hand, they were used to give a rhythmical cadence

to 51 clauce or soug, or for any similar purpose, they would be musical 
instruments. Any attempt to decide to wbicli use these objects were 
put and so decide whether they were or were not musical instruments 
would be mere speculation. Tliat they might have been used as such, 
and that hundreds of other similar instruments have been found which 
were used as musical instruments, justiiies this classihcation and their 
insertion in this paper. 

The Grotto or Cavern of Gourdan, in Haute Garonne, France, was 
explored by Judge E. Piette. The work of exploration lasted for three 
years (1871-1874), and was conducted by a Frenchman whom I met 
there who served as cook at Delmonico's for four years (1861-1864), and 
who, having thus made his fortune, returned to Gourdan and estab- 
lished himself as innkeeper. He did the work of excavation under 
pay from Judge Piette, and it occupied him for three years. This was 
another of the caverns in which the superimposed strata evidenced the 
chronological and cultural sequence between the Paleolithic and Neo- 
lithic occupations. In a stratum of the later period, amid much char- 
coal and cinders, he found a bone llute or pipe pierced with holes and 
capable of producing three notes. 

A memoir appeared in the report of the Socio te Academique des 
Sciences, etc., of St. Quentin, France, for the year 1873-74, XII, 3d ser., 
p. 339, written M. Textor de Kavisi, wherein he argued as to the exist- 
ence of musical instruments in the age of stone, and, maintaining the 
affirmative, he cites the invention of M. Baudre, who had made what 
he called a "Clavier de silex," that is to say, a sort of piano or xeno- 
phone, composed of twenty-eight stones, twenty-six of Hint and two of 
schist. They were arranged according to note and sound, whether 
made so by size or shape is immaterial, and were struck with a pebble, 
producing the melody. The inventor chose natural pieces of flint, and 
did not chip them to size or form. He insisted that the natural pieces 
produced infinitely better tones than those which were chipped. While 
this instrument was entirely possible in Paleolithic times, yet there is 
nothing to show that it was ever invented or used. Indeed, there is 
nothing in all the discoveries that have ever been made to show that 
Paleolithic man had any system of music applicable to this instrument, 
or that he would have recognized it or the music if either had been 
Ijresented before him. There is an instrument similar to this in the 
Museum of Science and Art at Dublin, but the stones are all of schist 
and none of flint. These are no evidence of prehistoric musical instru- 
ments, and are only ingenious modern inventions by Avhich our present 
scales of music are brought into use.

Lnhrs. — The most elaborate, as well as the most beautiful instru- 
ments of music belonging to prehistoric times, were the bronze ami gold 
tiumpets or horns of Scan 
dinavia. They are not toys, 
but are of large size, quite 
as large as any horns of 
modern times, being some- 
times 5 and even \\\) to 8 
feet in length, Avith bell 
mouths 0, 8, and 10 inches 
in diameter. Xo particul ar 
style was adopted, though 
all specimens agree in 
the requisites of the horn 
or trumpet. Some are 
straight and some curved, 
after the fashion of the 
modern hornj others, 
again, are curved at one, 
and still others at both 
ends. The majority of 
these instruments are of 
bronze, cast in short sec- 
tions with joints or shoul- 
ders, which, being fitted, 
are riveted together. The 
straighter ones are in 
longer sections and, conse- 
quently, with fewer shoul- 
ders, while those more 
curved have proportion- 
ately shorter sections and 
more shoulders. The va- 
riations of form and conse- 
quent changes in manufac- 
ture will be apparent on 
ins})ection of the figures. 
These horns are called luhrs by the Danes. They are from southern 
Sweden and Denmark as far south as Sleswick, but not farther. They 
are found mostly in peat bogs. Whether this was an intentional deposit 
and for the purpose of their preservation has never been determined.

the shape of the letter S, found at Maltbeck. It is nearly 8 feet iu 
length, measuring' tlie convex sides. It had been cast in sections, which 
have been fitted and riveted. It has a disk upon the larger end (simi- 
lar to fig. 187 from Ireland), the decoration on which is a representation 
of the daisy flower. The small end was provided with its mouth- 
piece, which is rather uncommon, and, as will be seen shortly, it was 
capable of being played upon. The details of this instrument, mouth- 
piece, disk at bell mouth, chain, ring, and strap, are shown in accompa- 
nying figs. 1G9 a, b, c, (L This specimen is reported in the guidebooks 

of the Museum of Antiquities at 
Copenhagen as belonging to the 
fourth hall or room containing 
objects of the Bronze age, as No. 
71, with the following label: 

Twenty- three (23) trumpets of war 
(lulirs) composed of sundry pieces of 
bronze molded separately ; found in the 
peat bogs, ordinarily iu pairs. 

This instrument has attracted 
the attention, both of the arch- 
ii'ological and musical world, and 
sundry reproductions of it have 
been made — one is in the British 
museum, one in the Museum of 
Natural History, New York city, 
and one in the Musee Instru- 
mental of the Eoyal Conserva- 
tory at Brussels (see No. 1156 of 
its catalogue), the latter giving 
the scale, from E-flat in the bass 
clef to E-flat on the upper space 
in the treble clef. 

A notice of a concert by the 
instruments in the Copenhagen 
Museum was published in the 
Washington Evening Star, Feb- 
ruary G, 189G, from the San Francisco Chronicle, which is here inserted: 

An enormous crowd fills the museum and neighboring square at Copenhagen every 
midsummer day to listen to a unifxue concert. A number of ancient Scandinavian 
horns more than three thousand years old, called "luren," are kept in the museum. 
Of this collection fourteen are in good condition. They have an elegant sliape, and 
the Hat metal x^lates at the moiithpiece show good technical perfection and a devel- 
oped taste for art. They are in difierent pieces fitted together. They are of very 
thin metal, and generally 7 feet l<nig. A few years ago it was found out by Dr. 
Hammcrich that they could still be blown or played upon. Their tones resemble 
those of the tenor horn, and they have a soft but powerful sound. Some are tuned 
in C and E sharp and others iu D, E, or G, and these tones form an accord, but uo

"scala." On the balcony in the conrt of the palace in which is kept the Northern 
Museum two members of th(^ "capella" blow tuues on two of those primeval horus 
to the delight of the inhabitants. 

Professor Starr says of one of these concerts: 

AVe had the good fortune to be present. The conrt of the museum was filled with 
hearers. Wonderful, is it uot, that horns two thousand years old, buried for long 
centuries in peat bogs, should, after this long silence, still be capable of giving out 
clear, ringing, even sweet, tones.' 

The age of bronze is supposed to have begun in Scandinavia about 
1500 B. C. It has been divided, for convenience of description, into 
the first and second periods, corresponding in some degree with the 
same ages in continental Europe, especially France, to which M. de 
Mortillet has given the nanies (1) Morgien and (2) Halstattien. These 
subdivisions have been made principally from the inspection of the 
objects themselves, their development, and their associations. It is 
believed by those who have studied the subject with the greatest 
attention and the most in detail that whencesoever the bronze may 
have come and howsoever the knowledge to work it came, that most oi 
the objects found in Scandinavia were made in the country; conse- 
quently, are of a culture and art indigenous thereto, and that this 
applies to both periods. N^Barly all bronze objects were made by cast- 
ing. It is not until near the close of the age of bronze that evidences 
of hammering as a method of manufacture have been found. Hammer- 
ing and drilling were employed after the object had been cast, and for 
the purpose of putting it together. Many molds in which objects were 
cast have been found throughout the country, but, so far as known 
to the author, none which were used for casting these trumpets or 
horns. A moment's consideration will make apparent the difficulty 
in casting. Their length, the size of the piece, the thinness of wall, 
the extent of core, together with the exactness required to make the 
sonorous quality, not only so that they shall sound, but that they shall 
make a note within a given scale — a consideration of these difficulties, 
and the ability displayed by their makers in overcoming them, should 
increase largely our appreciation of the capacity of the workmen. One 
of the most beautiful specimens of bronze vases of elegant form and 
choice decoration was found in the Island of Funen with the core of 
clay still in it, thus enabling its discoverers to determine with cer- 
tainty the method of its manufacture. The casting had failed in part 
and was never completed. The many other similar vases which were 
successfully made is proof of the capability of the workman. No evi- 
dences of the art of soldering during the bronze age have been found 
in Scandinavia. Kot only have no soldered specimens been found, 
but many objects were repaired without solder. Two methods were 
employed, riveting, or by the apparently more difficult process, described 
elsewhere, of pouring molten metal on the junction of the broken i)ieco-;

until tbey tlieniselves liave become melted and tlie new and old were

Thus much for the Bronze age; but this does not account for all the 
prehistoric objects in bronze belonging- to that country. The prehis- 
toric ages of iron have been divided into three epochs, covering a period 
from some time anterior to the Christian era until about 1000 A. D., 
when the historic period as represented in the known languages of 
Europe began. The languages used in Scandinavia jidor to this time 
were Runic. They were protohistoric but afterwards passed out of 
use. Tlie term "iron age," while it denotes the use of iron, was princi- 
pally applied to its use for cutting implements. Bronze did not cease 
to be used for many purposes, and among the rest, for the luhrs or 
trumpets or horns. Therefore many of these instruments of bronze 
have been found which belonged to the prehistoric ages of iron. The 
question of chronology can only be determined by critical examina- 
tions of almost infinitesimal details in the manufacture, form, kind, 
and use of imjdements, and of the objects associated with them, and 
even then errors are not infrequent. This should be borne in mind in 
criticising the assignment of any given instrument to a certain age or 
period. 

In the last age of iron, when the runes had passed their final stage 
of improvement and are capable of being read, we gain much infor- 
mation therefrom concerning the life history of the people, and find they 
made war, indulged in the chase, and played games, as other people 
did then and have ever done. A social custom Avhich prevailed among 
the Scandinavians, peculiar to them and to the Celts, and possibly 
other peoples, was that of minstrelsy, whereby the instruments of 
music Avere brought into use. Mr. Moutelius^ says: 

Of uinsical iiistnnnents, we read of the lyre, tlie lioni, the pipe, the fiddle, and 
above all the liarji, one of the oldest and most prizetl. Snorri relates of Olaf Skiit- 
Ivonung, that ^vhen the meats were set npon the king's table, the players stepped 
forth with "liarps, ttddlcs, and other instruments." To the tones of the harp the 
skalds geneially sang their songs. Skalds often A'isited at the conrt of the Swedish 
kings; sometimes they came from Iceland. 

Of these, the liorn only seems to have been i>rehistoric, and it alone 
has received attention in this paper. 

In 1801 eight of these large curved bronze horns were found in a 
peat bog or turf bed, Brudevadte, in a field near Liunge in the neigh- 
borhood of Frederick sborg. These were intact and comjilete, mouth- 
piece and all, are in the museum at Copenhagen, and have lately been 
played upon, as previou.sly related. The longest was 6 feet and some 
inches, while the largest disk on the bell mouth was 11 inches in 
diameter. 

Fragments of bronze horns had before been found throughout that

country and gave rise to mncli speculation as to tbeir possible origin 
and use. The discovery of these complete horns identified the objects 
and solved the doubts. 

Another bronze liorn in the museum of Copenhagen, 5 feet in length, 
was discovered in a peat bog at Wedellsborg, Island of Fuueu, in the 
year 1809. It had a chain attached.

found in a peat bog in Sfklerinanbmd, Sweden. The middle portion is 

an ox horn of which only enough remains to show what material it was. 

The mountings are elab- 
orate and are attached 
at either end in such 
way as to lengthen the 
horn and increase its 
power as a musical in- 
strument. The two 
mountings are attached 
by a bronze chain with 
long links, which has 
served for suspension or 
carrying. It is taken 
from Montelius.- The 
small ends of many of 
these horns were de- 
stroyed when found, and 
so it is undeterminable 
whether they were used 
for music or for drinking. 
Horns similar in all ap- 
pearance to these were 
in that country and in 
that epoch used for both 
purposes.

horn, probably of the 
Iron age, with bronze 
mountings. It may have

two others, was found in

the boundary between Denmark and Germany. These instruments 
are, or were, so beautifnl and valuable, and their history so well 
authenticated, as to jus- 
tify their description. 

On July 20, 1639, a 
young girl of poor family 
named Kristine Sven- 
datter (daughter of Sve- 
non) left her house to go 
to the little village of 
Tonder. Walkinginher 
bare feet, she stubbed her 
toe against what she 
thought to be a root. 
She struck it a blow with 

her staff", gave an imprecation upon it, and passed on. Some days after- 
wards fate or luck caused her to pass the same way, and she struck her 
toe against the same object, which excited her indignation if not her 
wrath, and she determined to cut down or dig up the root which lay in 
the path of travelers and which on these two occasions had served her 
such a tr'u'M. She dug it out and found it to be this horn (fig. ITl). Cer- 
tain neighbors gave her their oi)ini<)n that it was a huntsman's old tin

liorii and not worth carrying home; but she decided to the contrary and 
carried it ^vitll lier, with no idea of what it really was. Arrived at home, 
she washed it and concluded it to be of tin or copper, still of no value. 
Theie were certain rings upon it which she gave the children to play 
with. After some days she went to the market town and took with 

her one of these rings to be exam- 
ined, when it was discovered that 
the ring- was not only gold, but un- 
usually flue gold. The King of 
Dennnirk, Cbristian lA', was then 
at Gluckstadt with his son, Prince 
'i Christian. The golden horn was 
g brought to him, he made recom- 
*^. pense to tlie girl, and presented 
J I the horn to his son, the prince. 
J S He had at fli st the idea to have the

bt ' 

S the same village of Gallehuus, was 
digging for clay in the field about 
25 paces from his cabin, when his 
pick struck an object which shone 
with great splendor. On digging 
it out it was found to be the gold 
horn indicated (fig. 175). Almost 
a hundred years had passed siiice Kristine Svensdatter had stubbed her 
toe against the first one and, naturally, there was difticulty in identify- 
ing the exact spot, but according to tradition, the second was found '6\ 
paces to the southwest of the first. The horn was cared for by a gold- 
smith in Tonder, determined to be fine gold, and then placed in the pos- 
session of Count Otto Diderick Schack, i)roprietor of the domain. It

was transmitted to Kiug Christian VI, wlio gave to tlie peasant 2(H) 
rigsdalers. 

Description of the horn found in 1G.')9 (fig. 174): Its length was 34 
inches; at the bell mouth its circumference was 12i inches, and the 
diameter 4^ inches; at the small end, which, however, had no mouth- 
piece, its circumference was 4^ inches, and its diameter 1^ inches. Its 
weight was G pounds 0.} ounces. Its manufacture was complicated, 
somewhat difiticult to describe in detail, and, perhaps, unimportant from 
the view point of a musical instrument. It was made of thick sheet 
gold; whether hammered or cast does not appear. It was double 
throughout, one sheet forming the interior, which was solid, smooth, and 
l^olished; whether made in a single sheet or by a succession of sheets 
soldered together is not now known. The interior sheet of gold was 
less pure than the exterior. The exterior plate was made iu bands or 
sections, as shown by flg. 170, thirteen regular ones and a small one at 
the bell mouth. These bands graduated in size and length from the 
large to the small end of the horn. The six smallest bands were

soldered to the interior sheet so as to form a solid piece. The other 
seven bands were different. While the bands at the smaller end 
may have been made separate and afterwards soldered together, the 
junction being covered by the solid ring, as shown in the figure, it is 
certain that the seven larger bands were made separate, for they were 
not soldered together, but inserted one into the other continuously 
after the fashion of a stovepipe, tlie junction being crimped so as to 
prevent their separation, yet permitting them to be rotated one 
upon the other. These junctions were then covered by separate gold 
rings, as shown in the figure, each ring fitting to its particular place. 
These seven larger bands were covered with figures, some of which 
were cast and soldered on, while others were made by j)unch marks 
(pointilU). The character and different kinds of these designs are not 
to be described, yet will be apparent on inspection of fig. 176, showing 
details. 

Description of horn tbuud in 1734 (fig. 175): This horn was broken 
and probably half of it (that of the smaller end) was not found. It 
was heavier and larger than the first one (fig. 174). It was made in

llio s;uno .neiieral motliod witli a sinootli interior surface and exterior 
bands, all of wliicli were soldered together. There were ouly live exte- 
rior bands in the fragment. The weight was, nevertheless, 7 pounds 
5^ ounces— lo ounces more than the first one, although that was com- 
plete. The ornaments 
Jl (fig. 177) were, like 
that of the first, some 
cast and soldered on, 
whileothers were made 
with punch marks — 
pointille. 

The designs upon the 
two horns, respective- 
ly, are from their form, 
manner of making, and 
mechanical work gen- 
erally, evidence that 
they both belonged 
practi(;ally to the same 
epoch. The ornaments 
(fig. 177) upon the horn 
(fig. 175) (1734) were 
artistically inferior to 
the other. There have 
been, of course, many 
attempts on the part 
of antiiiuarians to de- 
cipher or translate 
these figures and dis- 
cover the date of the 
making of the horns. 
These efforts have re- 
sulted in many theo- 
ries, with none of which 
we are particularly in- 
terested. They were 
supposed to be calen- 
dars of antiquity, to 
represent the signs of 
the zodiac, to be a map 
of the heavens and so 
deal with astronomy,to 
have related to the worship, first of the sun and then all within the range 
of Scandinavian mythology, as well as other my thologies. The antiquari- 
ans who made the most i)rofound studiesof these horns, and whose descrip- 
tion and opinions are best entitled to consideration, were (1) Mr. E. P.

He interprets the Kunic inscription as Celt-Iberian, and i)erliaps 
Druidic. 

The second gentleman attributes these golden horns to a different 
origin. He thinks he recognizes the gold of which they are made as 
from Hungary, Transylvania, or perhaps the Crimea. The figures upon 
them suggest to him the usage of tlie Vandals who combined the wor- 
ship of Odin, Thor, and Friga, with that of their national gods. It is 
agreed by both these gentlemen that the figures denote a barbarous 
epoch so far in the past that, if they have any meaning at all, it is now 
inexplicable beyond theory or suggestion. 

The last found horn (that of 1734), fig. 175, had a Eunic inscription 
in the narrow band at its bell month. This inscription has been read, 
reread, and guessed at, until it has received every kind of rendition. 
The results of the i)rincipal attempts in this direction have been given 
in extenso by Mr. C. C. Rafn.' 

W. F. Kopf, 1821, writes: "I am (both) a horn of the chase (hunts- 
man's horn) and a drinking cup (dedicated) to the orgie (ceremony) of 
Holte." 

According to Gisle Brynjulfsson, 1823: "I, Hlevus, have made these 
two horns," or " Thorfln and Leif have made both these horns." 

Fin Magnusen, 1834, says: "I bring to the sacrifice the envelope of 
the horn of Tovid." 

N. M. Petersen, 1837, gives: " I, Hlevo, have made the envelope of 
this horn." 

According to Jacob H. Bredsdorff, 1838 : " I, Hleva, have made these 
horns for my guests, the inhabitants of the forest (the Holsteinois)." 

Jacob Grimm, 1848, writes: " Holsatis, intimis hospitibus pocula 
dedi." 

K. Mullenhoft", 1852, says: " I have made these horns for the Holz- 
ingeu, or guardians of the forest." 

C. C. Rafn himself makes the following literal rendition: 

ECHLEV OG OSTIR HULTInGOR 
HURNO TVO VIgl TJ 

which he translates into Danish as follows: 

Echlev ak Astir (Eyleife ok Astyr) Hyltingar tva (tvo) vigpu, which 
in English is "The Holsteinois, Echlev and Astyr, have initiated (or 
consecrated) these two horns." According to his examination of his- 
tory as set forth in certain of the Sagas, Mr. Rafn concludes that Eglaf 
or Eyleif was a chief of the southern Danes in Holstein about the fifth 
century. 

Both golden horns were deposited in the Royal Cabinet of Curious 
Objects. A thief, by the aid of false l^eys, broke into the cabinet May

4, 1802, and stole both horns. To avoid detection, he melted them into 
bars, and, being- a goldsmith, he fabricated therewith chains, collars, 
buckles, and other Jewelry. This further excited his avarice, and he 
began the falsification or adulteration of the gold in his manufactured 
objects, which led to his detection and final conviction. 

The foregoing- descriptions were from measurements, drawings, and 
casts made while the horns were in existence. 

IRET.AND. 

Bronze horns. — The ancient musical instruments of Ireland, so far 
brought to the notice of archaeologists, are the horn or trumpet, the 
harp, and the bagpipe. The two latter are more modern and are prob- 
ably not prehistoric. The Museum of Science and Art at Dublin pos- 
sesses several ancient harps, attractive on account of their historic and 
national interest, but they are not for ns. The only prehistoric objects 
found suspected of belonging- to this class are the bone hairpins (?) 
from the Strokestown Crannoge. 

Fig-. 178 shows a metacarpal bone of a deer. It is 8 inches long, is 
hollowed artificially throughout and perforated with nine holes, each of 
which is surrounded by a circular incised line, the upper hole with two

lines. It is otherwise decorated with dots and lines. Sir William K. 
Wilde ^ was doubtful about this being a musical instrument. He says: 

If it was the top member of ii lute or a .small rude harp, the holes might have been 
used for holding the pins to which the strings were fastened. 

It is here figured as possibly a musical instrument. 

M. Paul du Chaillu wrote his interesting work, " The Viking Age," ' to 
demonstrate the proposition that the early settlers of Britain and the 
British Isles were Vikings rather than Anglo-Saxons. He based his 
theory upon the similarity of the many objects found, respectively, in 
Britain and Denmark. While his theory lias not been accepted gener- 
ally, yet it must be confessed that the similarity he points out was 
remarkable. Xot the least is it so with regard to the trumpets or horns 
(luhrs). A fact in this similarity opposed to Du Chaillu's theory is that 
the greater, almost the entire, number of these trumpets are found in 
Ireland, while they are extremely rare in England. Sir John Evans' 
records that as early as 1713 Mr. F. Nevill described^ eight bronze 
trumpets found at Dunganon, County Tyrone, Ireland.

540 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

Sir W. R. Wilde' reports that tlie earliest historic notice of tlie dis- 
covery of these instruments was by Sir Thomas Molyneaiix iu his 
"Discourse Concerning the Danish Mounds, Forts, and Towers of Ire- 
land," 1725. This author bases his opinion upon the work of Olaus 
Wormius's treatise of the antiquities of Denmark (1655), in which every- 
thing of high antiquity found in Ireland was accredited to the Danes. 
This was carried to such excess as to include many things exclusively 
Irish, and of which nothing like them were ever found in Denmark. 
These authors were followed in some degree by Du Chaillu. 

In 1750 thirteen or fourteen of these curved bronze horns were dis- 
covered near Cork. Three of them were figured by Charles Smith in his 
"History of the County of Cork," and are believed to be the same sold 
to Bishop Pocock and figured by the Society of Antiquaries in " Vestuta 
Monumenta," and afterwards copied in the "Historical Memoirs of the 
Irish Bards," 1786. 

Three trumpets and a fragment of straight tube were discovered in 
the County of Limerick in 1787, and figured in Volume II of its Trans- 
actions. In 1704 four bronze trumpets were found in a bog on the bor- 
ders of Loch Nashade, near Armagh. In 1809 two joints of a large 
and perfect curved bronze trumpet were found in a peat bog at Ardbrin, 
County Down. In 1833 Dr. Petrie- described and figured a cast bronze 
horn, one of several found at Dowris and then iu possession of the 
Dean of St. Patrick, one of which is here represented as fig. 181. In 
1835 several trumpets were discovered in a bog near Killarney. The 
largest measured 15 inches and the smallest 10^ inches from point to 
point. They were distributed among various antiquarians in Cork. In 
1847 three trumpets were discovered near Cloghoughter Castle, County 
Cavan. In 1840 four trumpets were discovered in the bog of Drum- 
best, County Antrim. 

The Eoyal Irish Academy, recently consolidated with the Kensing- 
ton Museum under the denomination of the Museum of Science and 
Art, Dublin, possesses sixteen specimens of these bronze trumpets. 
Sir W. R. Wilde-' divides them into two classes — (1) those of which the 
small end is stopped and the mouth hole is in the side, flute fashion, 
and (2) those with the small end open and the mouthpiece inserted 
trumi)et or horn fashion. On none of the specimens was any moutli- 
l)iece found, but the appearance when found and subsequent examina- 
tion satisfies the student of its existence and use. Of those blown 
from the ends, some were cast and some hammered and riveted. Those 
closed at the end and with mouth hole on the side were all cast. From 
these differences he makes five varieties of prehistoric bronze trumpets 
in Ireland. 

The cast specimens were in one i)iece, having been molded com-

plete ill a single operation, the work of cleaning, drilling, and deco- 
rating liaving, as in modern times, been done subseqnently. 

The other specimens were of thin sheet bronze, originally cast, for 
bronze caji be made only by casting. How thin the bronze originally was 
wlien cast we have no knowledge, but whatever its thickness it must 
have been hammered, probably many times, being annealed each time 
to prepare it. Reduced to the proper thickness by whatever process, 
it was bent by hammering, probably repousse, into the proper form, 
usually, if not always, in two pieces. The edges, being brought together, 
are fastened by any of the various methods of riveting. Fig. 190 is a 
representation of the details of the operation of riveting as employed 
in tig. 189. Sometimes the strips of thin bronze were laid on the out- 
side as well as inside and the rivets put through three instead of two 
thicknesses. This was the case with fig. 187. While these workmen 
must have had knowledge of the art of soldering (shown in their gold 
work by the attachment of collars, rings, etc.), yet none of these instru- 
ments are reported as having been thus made. 

Several of these instruments had been broken in ancient times and 
mended by the prehistoric workman. The methods of doing this show 
that in prehistoric times, as well as early Christian times, the metal work- 
ers of Ireland were of a high order and possessed of a degree of skill 
greater, probably, than any in Europe at the same period. Thedisplay in 
the Museum of Science and Artin Dublin of gold, silver, and bronze work, 
dating earlier than the eleventh century, will demonstrate the truth of 
this proposition. Eeproductions in baser metal made by Mr. Edward 
Johnson, an antiquarian jeweler of Dublin, were displayed in the Brit- 
ish section at the Chicago Exposition and were admired by all who 
had the good fortune to see them. 

The instruments cast in molds were mended by a process called 
"burning,"!, e., pouring molten metal on the junction of the broken 
pieces until they were themselves melted, when the old and the new 
metal would be fused into a solid mass and the break repaired. Occa- 
sionally this produced an enlargement, as in the case of fig. 183. In 
other specimens the ends or edges of the broken pieces were brought 
together and brazed. This was the usual course when mending broken 
bronze swords or daggers. Yet many times these swords, with other 
broken objects, were sent to the foundry for recasting. Fourteen thou- 
sand broken pieces of this or similar kinds were found together, forming 
part of the great prehistoric bronze foundry in Bologna, Italy. Where 
the bronze had been hammered, the process of reparation was by dove- 
tailing or by riveting, and sometimes both. Fig. 190 represents the 
details of one of these processes. 

Fig. 179 represents a curved bronze trumpet molded and cast, found 
at Portglenone, County Derry. It measures 24^ inches on its«outside 
curve. It has the end stopped and a mouth hole in the side, flute 
fashion, as shown in the drawing.'

jittaclied to the body of the instrument on the concave side and near 
the small end as though for a chain. The mouth hole is in the side or 
body of the instrument, flute fashion. Fio-. 184 represents in detail 

the smaller end, showing that 
it has been broken across the 
mouth hole and how it was in- 
geniously mended by pouring 
hot metal around the fracture 
until the edges were melted 
and joined. 

Figs. 185 and 186 represent 
two trumpets of sheet bronze, 
hammered and not cast, from 
Tralee. The mouthpieces are, 
as usual, gone, and while it is 
not exactly known how the in- 
struments were blown, it was 
not as a flute and, therefore, must have been as a horn or trumjiet. 
There are rivet holes on the bell mouths of two of these horns, showing 
them to have been provided with flanges similar to fig. 187. Two of 
them have four protruding spikes near the bell mouth, which Mr. Day 
suggests may have been to add effect 
to blows in case the trumpets should be 
used as weapons, but this theory can 
scarcely be maintained, because (1) 
these instruments are not strong 
enough to withstand the crash of an 
effective blow, (2) the spikes are in the 
middle and on the small, ( fig. 186) as well 
as on the larger end, and (3) they are on the straight tubes (fig. 191) of 
thin sheet bronze, so small as to be ineffective for any such purpose. 
Fig. 186 is peculiar in that while the outer end of the horn is curved, the 
near or small end is straight. It is made with two pieces fitted together, 

sliding one in the other after the 
fashion of a jointed flute, and thus 
making it a firm and solid tube or 
pipe. One of these is straight and 
the other curved. The instrument 
is 50 inches long on its convex side, 
and 4 inches in diameter at its bell 
mouth. 

Fig. 187 represents one of four 
trumpets found in a bog on Lough- 
n a shade. County Armagh, in 1794. It is made of hammered sheet 
bronze, in two pieces, bent longitudinally and placed together to form the 
cylindrical tubeasshown. ItsseamsAvere fastened by riveting; astrip 
of sheet bronze half an inch in width is laid upon the seam internally

by rivets seven-eigbths of an inch apart. The lower jiart of the instru- 
ment lias been i)atched in several places by plates and collars riveted 

on. Tlie upper part of the instrument was 
joined in the same way, but apparently ruder. 
The bell mouth of the instrument is finished 
with the large ornamented cast boss shown in

of spikes, four spikes in each circle. Sir W. II. Wilde' is of the opinion 

that this instrument served as the 
handle of a battle-ax or commander's 
baton or staff. But Sir John Evans^ 
is of a different opinion. Both he

Bronze horns. — According to Sir John Evans — ^ 

Englisli trumpets of bronze belonging to prehistoric times are of rare occurrence. 
One found in the River Witliam, Lincolnshire, has been tignred in the Philosophical 
Transacticms, ' and is nearly straight for the greater part of its length (about 28 
inches), curving upward near tlie end into an irregularly-shiiped expanding mouth. 
It has an ornament or crest like a mane along the exterior curve. In form it is not 
unlike the caruyx, which is brandished by the horseman on 
the coins of the British princes Eppillus and Tasciovanus,"' 
and which also appears on some Roman coins and monuments 
commemorative of Gallic and British victories. The metal 
on analysis gave copper 88, tin 12, and the tube was formed 
from a hammered sheet and soldered with tin. It not improb- 
ably belongs to a period not far removed from that of the Ro- 
man invasion of this country. 

Another, witli two joints and a perfect mouthpiece, is said 
to have been found at Battle, Sussex, and has been engraved 
by Grose. "^^ 

Bells or rattles. — Sir John Evans ' reproduces a bell 
or rattle "formed of a hollow egg or pear-shaped 
piece of bronze with a pebble or piece of metal in- 
side by way of clapper." Fig. 193 represents this 
object. It is to be noted that this bell bears a great 
resemblance to the prehistoric ones found in Mexico. 
Sir John Evans continued his description, which is 
here given entire because of the frequent sugges- 
tion made that the Mexican bells were of European 
manufacture. The only reasons for this belief is their similarity of 
form and appearance with those manufactured in Europe, and that

ancieut explorers, especially those from Spain, mention hawks' bells 
as objects of trade with the aborigines : 

The only (similar) examples which I am able to adduce are those which luruied 
part of the Dowris hoard (Ireland), one of which is represented in fig. 44(i. There 
are three such in the Royal Irish Academy and four in the British Museum. AA'ith 
the latter is a smaller plain bell of the same character and two unfinished castings. 
Sir W. R. Wilde observes that in casting, the metal appears to have been poured into 
the mold by an aperture at the side, through which the core of clay that contained 
the metal clapper was broken up. The mold was in two halves and the rings and 
staples at the ends were cast together. In the perfect examples at the British 
Museum the sides of the holes by which the core was extracted have been hammered 
together, so as in some cases to be almost closed. In one iiist.'ince there is some 
apijearance of the sides having been brazed together. 

The sound emitted by these bells is dull and feeble. Like the modern horse bells, 
a number of them may have been hung together, and not improbably employed in a 
similar manner to attract the attention both of the eye and the ear. 

This bell was part of the " Dowris find," Kings County, Ireland (as was 
the trumpet, fig. 181), described in Sir W. E. Wilde's catalogue,^ who 
says that they were of great antiquity may be inferred from the char- 
acter of the metal of which they are composed, as well as the circum- 
stances under which they were found. They were believed to have 
been the ecclesiastical bells used by the Druid priests, and as such have 
been called " crotals," but there is not sufficient authority to state this 
confidently. A number of these, and others more spherical, have been 
found in Ireland. The globular ones are 1^ to 2f inches in diameter, 
while the specimen represented in fig. 193 is Ci inches long, including 
the ring", and 2fo inches in diameter. We shall later refer to speci- 
mens of great similarity found in Mexico and Central and South Amer- 
ica regarding which a priori theorists have jumped at the conclusion 
that because of this similarity with modern and Old World forms they 
were imported, or at least were white man's work. We shall also see 
how Prof. W. H. Holmes, in his paper on " Ancient art of the Prov- 
ince of Chiriqui,"^ denounces and upsets this theory. 



Trumpets, or war horns. — Fig. 194 represents one of the prehistoric 
Gaulish trumpets, or war horns. It belongs to France. No complete 
original of this has ever been found, but from fragments and from a 
representation upon the Roman triumphal arch at Orange, arcluvolo- 
gists have been able to reconstruct and reproduce it. On that arch a 
Gaulish soldier is represented as sounding his trumpet, from which it 
is supposed to have been a war trumpet. The other objects of bronze 
and of gold found and identified as belonging to Gaul at and prior to 
the Eoman conquest demonstrate the entire capability of these people 
to make such instruments, while the discovery of the fragments and 
partially destroyed pieces establishes aflirmatively the fact of their

existence. Iloimm historians of the time of Ca'sar liave reported and 
described these instruments from Gaul, and Polybius' says that — 

The parade and tumult of the army of the Celts 
terrified the Romans, for there was amongst them au 
^>i infinite number of horns and trumpets which, with 

the shouts of the whole army in concert, made a 
clamor so terrible and loud that every surrounding- 
echo was awakened, and all the adjacent country 
seemed to join in the horril>le din. 

Diodorus^ says of the Gauls that they had 
barbaric trumpets of a special nature which 
gave a hoarse sound well suited to the din of 
battle. The use of war trumj^ets among the 
Celtic population of western Europe has been 
more than once mentioned by classic writers, 
and iiassages from them have been cited by 
Sir John Evans, Sir Augustus W. Franks, 
and others.' Smith's Dictionary of Greek 
and Roman Antiquities describes the lituus 
as a sort of trumpet slightly curved at the 
extremities, differing both from the tuba and 
cornu, the former being straight and the lat- 
ter bent into a spiral. Lydus calls the lituus 
the sacerdotal trumpet, and says it was em 
ployed by Romulus when he proclaimed the 
title of his city. Aero asserts that it was 
peculiar to cavalry, while the tuba belonged 
to infantry. Its tones are characterized as 
harsh and shrill. The Roman lituus seems 
to have been much the same shape as the 
figure here given (fig. 194), which was called 
the carnyx, the end of which was sometimes 
made to represent the fanciful head of an 
animal, 

A horn, not prehistoric, but of high anti- 
quity and well known in ancient history, is 
that of Charlemagne, jireserved in the treas- 
ury of the cathedral of Aix-la-Chapelle. It 
is ivory, and was made from a veritable ele- 
phant tusk. A cast of it is in the museum 
Fig. 194. of the Conservatory of Music in Brussels (JSTo.

is from flat below, to F within, the staff.

PREHISTORIC ART. 551 



The only mention by Dennis of music or musical instruments as hav- 
ing been found in Etruria is that of — 

A singular spear or rod with a number of movable disks which might have been 
rattled together so as to keep time, and Avhich, as it was found in connection with 
armor and weapons, seems to mark it for military use and may have served as an 
accompaniment to a band. A similar instrument was found in the neighborhood 
which had on its top the figure of a naked man dancing. ' 

This describes the tintinnabulura which was in use in different parts 
of the eastern hemisphere in i^rehistoric times. This instrument is 
figured and described in De Mortillet's "Musee Prehistorique"^ and in 
Wilson's "Swastika"^ as found from India to the Swiss Lake dwellings. 

There have been several specimens, the handiwork of prehistoric 
man, found in his graves or stations, cited by authors on music, not 
themselves archaeologists, under the supposition that these were musical 
instruments; but this is only a hypothesis and subject to confirmation 
by future discovery. The Archaeological Journal, 1864, reports the 
discovery of a bone which Professor Owen x)ronounced to be that of 
the Irish elk. It was found in a moat at Desmond Castle, Ireland, and 
was thought to have formed part of a musical instrument, notably the 
Irish lyra. The uncertainty of this contention is apparent when it is 
noted that other persons equally, and perhaps better, qualified to judge, 
gave it as their opinion that it formed part of a crossbow. Others 
have reported the tusks or teeth of cave bear, dog, and other animals, 
found with holes drilled, one can now almost say with certainty, for 
suspension, but the musicians have tried to convert them into whistles. 
This they do by saying that to stop the hole on the opposite side and 
blow as in the cylinder of a key it will make a whistling sound. 

Other individuals have supposed that pieces of hard stone, notably 
jade, with one or more holes drilled therein, were used as musical 
instruments, because when suspended and struck, they gave forth a 
sonorous sound. This is not impossible, but it is improbable. 

There are in the United States !N"ational Museum scores of objects of 
jade which have been sawed and otherwise elaborately carved and 
worked, and which have been drilled with one or two holes. (Plates 
39, 40.) It also has, as does every other collection, gorgets and so-called 
ceremonial objects, drilled as for suspension, all of which are, to a cer- 
tain extent, sonorous and will emit a musical tone when struck; but the 
same thing is equally true of any reasonably large flake or blade of 
flint or obsidian. The large chalcedonic spearheads from Arkansas, 
the flint, rhyolite, and chalcedonic leaf shaped implements will like- 
wise emit a sonorous sound when suspended and struck. It is evident 

'Dennis, Etruria, II, p. 444. «Fig. 1230. spago 799, fig. 29. 



552 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

tbat none of these were ever iiiteiuled for musical instruments, and 
tbis eftectually dis])Oses of the claim that the former objects were so 
used. Almost any piece of steel, or even iron, certainly glass, made in 
modern times, will emit a sonorous sound; but when these materials 
are utilized in the construction of musical instruments, that intention 
is always apj^areut, (See j). 526.) 

The United States National Museum possesses a large, interesting, 
and valuable collection of musical instruments, which have been 
obtained primarily through the interest of the late Dr. G. Brown Goods, 
the assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in charge of 
the National Museum. Very many of these are extremely prihiitive 
and might well have served in prehistoric times. Their use by savages 
and primitive peoples in the earliest stages of their history shows an 
almost certain connection with prehistoric times. It has, therefore, 
been considered proper that they should be noticed among prehistoric 
instruments. 

The Museum has also published various memoirs and ethnological 
papers, reports of travels, descriptions and catalogues of collections, 
wherein savage and primitive musical instruments have been figured. 
It is deemed wise to employ this material so far as it relates to or will 
elucidate the subject in hand so that it may be brought together, and, 
so far as possible, a view of prehistoric musical instruments, especially 
those in the United States National Museum, presented. 

The princii)al among these publications are: "The Shofar, Its Use 
and Origin,"' by Dr. Cyrus Adler, curator of oriental antiquities; 
"Notes on the Ethnology of Tibet," ^ by William Woodville Eockhill; 
"The Indians of the Northwest Coast,"' by Lieut. Albert P. Niblack, 
United States Navy; "Ethnology of Ungava District, Hudson Bay 
Territory,"^ by Lucien M. Turner; "A Study of Siouan Cults," '^ by J. 
Owen Dorsey; "The Point Barrow Esquimo,"'' by John Murdoch. 
These will be em])loyed in connection with unpublished Museum 
material, and the whole arranged geographically.

that this was an iustruuieut no doubt used in prehistoric times 
Wetzstein is of the opinion that the use of the 
ram's horn may have been borrowed by the Israel- 
ites, and goes bai'lc to a people who were engaged 
solely in the care of sheep. By these it was used 
as a signal of alarm. * * * (p. 438). There 
seems to be little doubt that it has been continu- 
ously used in the Mosaic service from the time it 
was established until now. * * * 'Phe shofar 
was not the only natural horu used by the Israel- 
ites as a musical instrument, but no copies or rep- 
resentations of the other instruments have come 
down to us. 

The sliofar is described at length by Dr. 
Adler, together witli the regulations as to 
its use and the reference made to it in the 
Bible. He says (p. 446) : 

From the Talmud we learn that the use of the 
shofar as a note of alarm of war was transferred to 
other seasons of danger and distress. Famine 
plague of locusts, and drought (Mishna Taauith, 
I, 6) occasioned the blowing of the shofar. 

The shofar was employed at the public cere- 
mony of excommunication. (Wetzstein, p. 67.) 

A very curious use of the shofar in later times ^ 
was in funeral ceremonies. (Wetzstein, p. G7.) I ?h 
agree with Wetzstein that this use of the instru- I 5 
ment is quite apart from the usual Semitic custom, " g 
and it was probably borrowed. i« ^ 

As a signal instrument of war it has its various g 
uses, possibly according to the note that was 
blowu. It was the signal for going out to battle, 
for the announcement of a victory, and for a recall 
of the troops. 

He figares many shofars on plates 
XCYIl-C, which are fully described, and 
to which reference is made for further in- 
formation. But in the jjlate first mentioned 
he shows many aboriginal horns similar 
to the shofar, principally from Africa. 

Figs. 1 and 2, plate 08, are shofars (his 
plate XCVII) assigned to Palestine and 
Syria. They are described as made of a 
ram's horn straightened and flattened by 
heat. The bore of the instrument is a 
cylindrical tube of very small caliber, 
which opens into a kind pf bell of para- 
bolic form. 

Fig. 195 is labeled as a Naigha, Da- 
vid's pipe, from Palestine, a double pipe 
of two parallel tubes of cane attached 
by cords. Each tube has four finger holes.

made sopiiratc iind inserted in the smaller ends. Tbey are close 
together and are intended to he blown both at the same time. The 
instrument is of the clarionet type. Vibratinji; reeds are attached to 
these small mouthpieces by cords wound about them at the outer end, 
leaving the inner end free for vibration. The free ends of the cords by 
which the parallel tubes are bound are attached to the mouthpieces to 
prevent loss. The length of this instrument is 0^ inches, the diameter 

of the tube is 4 inch, of the 
mouthpiece ^ inch. (Gift of 
A. 1>. Karny.) 

Fig. 1 96 represents a pottery 
drum from Syria. (Collected 
by Erhard Bissinger, United 
States consul.) Tlie shell is 
of red earthenware in the 
shape of a longitudinal sec- 
tion of a bottle. It has a 
parcliment head stretched, 
stitched, and glued in place. 
The pottery is decorated with 
incised zigzag lines nearly 
equidistant throughout the 
length of the instrument. It 
is 16.^ inches in height, and its 
respective diameters are 3f 
and 103 inches. 

The musical instruments of 
the Bil^le are not considered 
in this paper other than Dr. 
Adler's reference to the shofar. 
They will be well known to all 
readers, and their presentation 
here would only be a work of 
collation. They are of suffi- 
cient antiquity to be classed 
as archieologic, and could well 
have a j)lace in any work on 
the history of music; but the people who used them had an enlight- 
ened civilization, and the instruments themselves were far from being 
prehistoric, although they may have been-|)rimitive. 

India.

scraped and polished, the tip cut off, and a hole made or enlarged in the

ment is made with a hot iron, without any attempt to spread or stretch

the horn or to forni a cjip-shaped mouthpiece, as has been done so fre- 
quently with siiiiihir instruments, both ancient and modern. Of this 
instrument Dr. Adler says (p. 449): 

luform it differs in uowiso from the shofar. It is an ancient outdoor wind instru- 
ment commonly known as the Indian horn, and was the favorite instrument of the 
Hindu god 8iva. * ^ The metallic descendant from the Indian buifalo horn, 

the shrinya, is the rana-shringa, an outdoor instrument made of copper, formerly 
used in military, and now universally in religious processions throughout India, 
both liy Hindus ami Mohammedans, the performers usually being Hindus of the 
lower caste. In the villages of southern and central India the watchmen blow it at 
sunset and at certain hours of the night, like the German naditicachter. In large 
cities a hornblower is always attached to the police. There is seldom a guard or 
detachment of native irregular troops without one. It is employed in all proces- 
sions, temple services, marriages, and other festive occasions, and at funerals. [8ee 
Capt. Meadows Taylor, Proc. Roy. Irish Acad., IX, plate i, p. 110.] Another trumpet 
of the same class is the kurna, used chiefly in religious processions, or in festivals 
in honor of local divinities. Only Brahmins and persons of a certain rank are per- 
mitted to use the kurna. It is esteemed bj- all Brahmins to be the most ancient instru- 
ment of music in existence, and the sound of it to be esiiecially pleasing to the gods 
in various particular ceremonies and at solemn parts of the sacrifice. 

This particular specimen is black in color, 12^ inches in length, and 
2^ inches in its greatest diameter. 

The conch shells of India, like those of some other countries, have 
the apex ground or cut off until a hole is opened, sometimes directly, 
sometimes laterally, which forms a mouthpiece. The natural cavity of 
the shell forms the bore. Specimen, Cat. No. 92711 (U.S.N.M.) is a 
horn called Shanka, made from a shell of the Turbenella pyrum which 
has been treated in the same manner. Its length is 6 inches, diameter 
33 inches. Specimen, Cat. No. 92712 (U.S.N.M.) is a horn named 
Gomukha, and made from a cassis or helmet shell. Its length is 10 
inches, diameter 8J inches. Specimen, Cat. No. 92713 (U.S.N.M.), a 
shell (Pterocera), has been treated in the same manner and made into 
a horn called Barataka. Length 11^ inches, width 4^ inches. 

Tibet. 

The musical instruments of the Tibetans, while not prehistoric, are 
quite primitive. They are described by Mr. Eockhill, in his "Journey 
through Mongolia and Tibet,'" published by the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion, as drums (yang ko ku), gongs, cymbals, and tambourines (t'ai-p'ing 
ku), and figured in his "Notes on the Ethnology of Tibet,-" wherein he 
describes them more at length. Those employed in religious observ- 
ances or in church ceremonies are the small hand drum (damaru), fre- 
quently made of children's skulls and covered with snake skin, and the 
bell (drilbu). On his plate 40, figs. 1 and 2 are damarus, of which fig. 
2 is made of two skulls attached by a wooden disk. Heads of devils 
and skulls are j)ainted on them in red and blue colors. A small cotton

band covers the disk between the two heads and projects a few inches, 
so as to be hel«l in the hand. Fig. 1 is smaller and the skulls are not 
painted, but the band is of embroidered satiu, decorated with elabo- 
rately knotted Chinese silk tassels. The bell (drilbu) is of bronze and 
usually about 2f inches in diameter. His figs. 4 and 5, plate 41, repre- 
sent such bells. Fig. 4 is made iu Derge, famous for its clear-toned 
bells. Fig. 5 comes from the famous Lamasery of Doloimor, eastern 
Mongolia. Musical instruments belonging to Tibet, exclusive of those 
used in religious worship, plate 69 (his plate 24), are (1) the whistle 
(liug-bu, figs. 1-3) of bamboo or the bone of an eaghi's wing, Avith six 
or seven key holes; (2) the jew's-harp (k'a-pi, figs. 4-6), and (3) the 
banjo or guitar (piwang, kopoug, or dra-nyan), with three or more 
strings. The latter is not figured by Mr. Rockhill. The figures of 
the former sufficiently explain themselves, but the jew's-harp is here 
described because of its occurrence among distant savage peoples. 
Mr. Eockhill says: 

The jew's-harp is made not by the Tibetans, but by the Lissus and other non-Tibe- 
tan tribes inhabiting southeast Tibet, and is a fa\'orite instrument in eastern Tibet, 
•where nearly all the women carry one susjiended from their girdles. Three harps 
are used simultaneously, each giving a different note; the deepest note is called p'o 
kii or "male sound," the intermediate one ding kil or "middle sound," the sharpest 
one mo kii or " female sound." They are held the one below the other in the order 
above given between the thumb and the index finger of the left hand, and struck 
with all the fingers of the right hand, the one after the other. These k'a-pi are car- 
ried in small bamboo cases ornamented with little rings of bamboo, often dyed, and 
also with geometric carvings, which are also colored. They are shown in the lower 
portion of this plate. 

Jew's-harps' similar to those used in Tibet are found among the Ainu and in New 
Guinea, but in many other countries where a bamboo harj) is used, the sound is pro- 
duced by jerking the harp by a string. This is the case in Assam, in parts of Suma- 
tra, among the Yakuts, the tribes of Torres Straits, etc. (p. 715.) 

Egypt (Thebes and Cairo).

is inserted, projecting 1.^ inches; this forms the mouthpiece of the 
instrument. To prevent its loss the mouthpiece is attached to the tube 
with a cord.

The instnimeiit is of tlie reed type, as is shown by the figure. The 
slip of reed is cut from the mouthpiece against which it lies; the out- 
side end is tied with a thread, and the inside end is left free for vibra- 
tion. The reed is shaved thin near its fastened end to render it more 
elastic. 

Specimen, Cat. No. 95198 (U.S.N.M.) is a trumpet from Muzmar el 
Daraweesh, i^robably made from a rhinoceros horn. It is curved, is 
lenticular in cross sections, and the bell mouth is bifurcated with 
notched edges. It has three lugs formed on its outer curved edge, in 
which are inserted four brass rings. The bore is sliglitly enlarged 
at the smaller end to form a cupped mouthpiece. Length, 20 inches; 
width, 1 to 5 inches; thickness, ^ to ^ inch. It is from Cairo. 

Africa. 

Fig. 3, plate 08,^ represents an African war trumpet made from the 
horn of an antelope. The natural cavity of the horn forms the bore of 
the instrument. The smaller end, however, has not been cut oft', but is 
left pointed as in nature. About one-fourth the distance from the 
Ijointed end a lateral opening has been made into the original cavity 
which forms a mouthpiece, and through this the instrument is blown. 

Figs. <) to 12 in same plate represent war horns from different i^arts 
of Africa. They are mostly ivory, and made of elephant's tusks or 
rhinoceros horn. The natural cavity of the tusk forms the bore. In 
some cases the horn has been left in its natural state with a lateral 
mouth hole cut in the concave side as in the shringa. Others, how- 
ever, are made by cutting off' the end and a direct mouth hole worked 
out of the solid. The localities of these instruments are indicated in 
the legends. 

Fig. 12, plate G8, represents an elephant tusk 4 feet 4 inches in 
length on the convex side. It has been carved so as to reduce its size 
considerably and made much more i)ointed than natural. At the 
distance of 33 inches from the large end a lateral opening has been 
made which forms a mouthpiece. This is elliptical and has been 
enlarged so as to be cup shaped. From the mouthpiece to the large 
extremity the natural cavity of the tusk forms the bore of the 
instrument. 

Specimen, Cat. No. 95227 (U.S.N.M.) is a wooden horn (Nanga) from 
Mayumba, Africa, collected by Mr. Carl Strechelman and received from 
Mr. George C. Webster. It is carved from a solid block of soft light- 
colored wood. The bore is made with a burning iron. The small end 
has an enlarged cup-shaped mouthpiece. Its smallest diameter is 1 
inch. It increases gradually to near the large end, where it expands 
with a bell mouth to 4^ inches. It is 28 inches long. The entire 
exterior has been originally blackened, apparently by fire, while a 
section of 11 inches at the larger end is decorated by incised lines cut

ill the burnt wood, whicli, by bringing- out the light color of the inte- 
rior, shows in circles, lozenges, zigzag, chevron, and festooned forms. 

Specimen, Cat. No. 174752 (U.S.N.M.) is a whistle of pottery in the 
form of a hollow cylinder with two projecting lugs from opposite sides. 
The mouth hole, three fourths of an inch in diameter, is at the upper 
end. At the opposite end is a finger hole three-sixteenths inch in

Dr. W. L. Abbott describes the "Ethnological 
Collections in the United States National Museum from Kilimanjaro, 
East Africa." ' The locality is thus identified: 

A little south of the eiiuator and about 175 miles froui the coast of P^ast Africa, 
rises the splendid mountain Kilimanjaro. It covers an area as great as the Bernese 
Overland and its greatest peak— Ki bo— is over 20,000 feet in height, capped with 
glaciers and eternal snows. The nearest port on the coast is Mondasa, now the 
headquarters of the British East African Company. 

Dr. Abbott's paper is illustrated by photographs of this primitive 
people. The list of musical instruments, all of them from the Wa 
Changa tribe, Mount Kilimanjaro, East Africa, is as follows: 

Battles.— li'ATge iron bell with two balls as sounders; worn by women during 
pregnancy, on the lower part of the thigh. Length, 4| inches. (Cat. No. 151577, 
U.S.N.M.) 

Battles.— Two small semilunar iron bells, tied to a thong; worn on the ankles. 
(Cat. No. 151575, U.S.N.M.) 

Anile rattles. — Iron bells, semilunar in shape, with sounders of iron balls, fastened 
in pairs to a thong of leather and worn on the ankles in dancing. (Cat. No. 151576, 
U.S.N.M.) 

j>,.„w.— Tube of wood closed at one end, with a skin liead. Used to call the pop- 
ulation to arms. It is carried under the left arm and beaten with right hand. Length, 
4 feet 2 inches; diameter, 44 inches. (Cat. No. 151.584, U.S.N.M.) 

Cow hell. — A piece of iron, wrought thin and cut in shape of a dumb-bell, then 
bent at the center so as to form a rude bell, Avith a clapper attached, to the narrow 
portion at the top. (Cat. No. 151578, U.S.N.M.) 

Cotv &e?/.— Native ironwork, similar to Cat. No. 151578. (Cat. No.. 151579, U.S.N.M.) 

Fig. 198 a, 1), represents one of three rattles from Mayumba, Africa. 
(Collected by Mr. Carl Strechelman.) Its length is 3^ inches, width, IJ, 
and thickness, 1^ inches. It is double — that is, with rattle at each end, 
intended to be held in the middle. It is of dark-colored soft wood, the 
outside charred and then ornamented by incised lines in squares, paral- 
lels, chevrons, herringbones, etc. Fig. 198a represents a complete 
drawing, while fig. 1986 is a longitudinal section showing the interior

charred smooth, and the lower ends are closed by being cut at a joint 
of the cane. The longest cane is I inches in length, the shortest 3

dark-redwood. The bottom is convex like a cask or barrel. No bead 
of skill is used, as in all drums of modern manufacture. When used 
it is placed on a coil of rope. It is from Somu-Sorau, Fiji, and was 

collected by the Wilkes Exploring Expe- 
dition. It is 55 inches in length, 16 inches 
in width, and 18 inches in height. The na- 
tive name for this instrument is lali, and the 
following description is taken from the label 
displayed in the United States National 
Museum : 

The tavola tree of Fiji (Ter»itna/(a catajjjja) is said 
to make the best souuding lalia, although the vest 
tree {Afzelia bijii(/a) is also used. ''The sides are 
l)eaten l)y two sticks about 18 inches long. In dif- 
ferent ways measures or tunes are beaten on them, 
the meaning of which is known by the natives and 
the 'old hands' or settlers. The sound of the lali is 
not unpleasant when beaten by a practiced hand, 
and a good-sounding one may lie heard at a distance 
of 4 or 5 miles on a quiet evening." — (Home, A Year 
in Fiji, p. 114.) 

Commodore Wilkes, in his Narrative of the United 
States Exploring Expedition, states that this drum 
was given to him by Tin Thakau, a chief of the island 
of Somu Soma, together with a thousand yams, in 
exchange for a musket — the usual price— and a 
whale's tooth in token of friendship. "After the drum 
had been presented to me," he continues, "I was 
desirous of hearing them beat upon it. They have 
several beats or calls to give notice to the koro (or 
village), one of which was for calling the people to- 
gether to the feast of human bodies. They were all 
distinct and, they said, quite audible at a great dis- 
tance. The Fiji drum is similar to that described 
at Tonga, and is made of a log hollowed out and 
placed on one point. It gives out a deep, hollow 
tone when struck with the small and large sticks 
with which they produce the different sounds." — (Vol. Ill, p. 317.)

All extremely primitive instrument in the United States National 
Museum (Cat. No. 95554) is marked Los Huesos, (the bones) Spain,

The United States National Museum possesses several primitive, if 
not entirely prehistoric, musical instruments, gathered by divers per- 
sons, most of them operating in the line of ethnology or prehistoric 
archteology, not a few of whom have been ofiBcers of the United States 
Government who have turned over their col- 
lections to the Museum on returning to 
Washington.

ALASKA. 




Point Barroiv. — Mr. John Murdoch, in his 
paper on the Point Barrow Eskimo,' says : 

The only musical instrument among these people 
is the universal drnni or tambomine (Aelyau), con- 
sisting of a membrane stretched over a hoop with a 
handle on one side. It is used from Greenland to 
Siberia. It is always accompanied by the voice, 
singing or chanting. It produced a loud, resonant, 
and somewhat musical note. There appears to be 
no system of tuning these drums, the pitch of the ^'*' ^^^' 

note depending entirely upon accident. eskimo drum.

reproduced as fig. 200, which is simply a 

hoop like that of a tambourine, oval, 22 by 19 inches, with a short 
handle attached. The membrane is a sheet of the peritoneum of a seal 
stretched over a hoop after the style of a tambourine. The United 
States National Museum possesses four of these drums, of which Mr. 
Murdoch says that "every Eskimo household possesses at least one." 
The expedition brought home eight handles for these drums which 
exhibit but slight variations. The commonest material for the handle 
is walrus ivory; only two out of twelve are of antler. Their length is 
from 4.(3 to 5.4 inches. Fig. 201 a-d represents a series of these drum 
handles taken from Mr. Murdoch's paper. With one exception, all 
these handles have the large end more or less rudely carved into a 
human face with the mouth open as if singing. The one exception is 
fig. c, which is the butt end of a small walrus tusk carved to repre- 
sent a walrus. It has small oval bits of wood inlaid for eyes. The 
notches by which these handles are fitted into the rim of the tam-

Many o1)jects are strung on strings and tied to the belt, notably on little boys; 
often a small brass bell is thus attached.

eral strings of ptarmigan beaiis. This is one of the nuisical instruments 
mentioned above by Captain Herendeen. The string or loop by which 
it was attached is shown in the figure. We can imagine the music 
made by this instrument when attached to the belt of a running, jump- 
ing, playing boy. It serves tlie same i)urpose in music as does the

strings, wliich, being agitated by the closing door, strike the wires, 
making music wlienever the door is moved. 

Mr. Murdoch ^ gives a better report of the musical abilities of the 
Point Barrow Eskimo. He says: 

Their music consists of mouotonous chauts, usually with very little perceptible 
air, aufl pitched generally in a minor key. 1 could not perceive that they had any 
idea of "tune,"' in the musical sense, but when several sang together each pitched 
the tune to suit himself. They, however, keep excellent time. The ordinary songs 
are in "common" or 4-4 time. The words are often extemporaneous, and at toler- 
able regular intervals comes the 

H^ J refrain, "A yana, yana, a yana 

ya," whicb takes the place of the 
"limna aja" of the eastern Eski- 
mo. Sometimes, when they are 
humming or singing to them- 
selves, the words are nothing but 
this refrain. Their voices, as a 
general thing, are musical. 

Like all Eskimo, they are very 
fond of music, and are constantly 
singing and humming to 1 hem- 
selves, sometimes, according to 
Captain Herendeen, waking up 
in the night to sing. Besides 
their regular festivals they often 
amuse themselves in their houses 
by singing to the drum. They are 
fond of civilized music and, hav- 
ing usually very quick and acute 
ears, readily catch the tunes, which they sing with curiously mutilated words. We 
found "Shoo fly" and "Little Brown Jug" great favorites at the time of our arrival, 
and one old woman from Nuwuk told us with great glee how Magwa (McGuire) 
used to sing "Tolderolderol." Our two violins, the doctor's and the cook's, were a 
constant source of delight to them.

HUDSON BAY ESKIMO. 

Mr. L. M. Turner,^ speaking of the Hudson Bay Eskimo, says : 

The only musical instrument used by these people is the drum or tambourine of 
the form shown. These drums vary in diameter from 22 to 26 inches. The mem- 
brane for the drumhead is a thin reindeer skin tanned. 

Fig. 203 represents one of these drums from Neuenot. 

Across the membrane is stretched a sinew cord on which are strung at right angles 
to the cord a number of barrels, made from the (juills of the wiug feathers of the 
willow ptarmigan. Across the underside of the membrane is stretched a similar 
cord with (quills. 

Mr. Turner figures and describes a similar drum used by the Little 
Whale River Indians, which drums, he says, differ greatly in construc- 
tion from those of the Uugava Indians. 

The size is rarely so great, seldom exceeding 22 inches. These drums have two

liead8 or membranes, litted ou the barrel and secured by a siugbj hoop for each head. 
The two hoops are then connected by tightening strings. The membranes are 
invariably made of deerskin in the parchment condition and not of tanned skins. 

The snares or thongs across the heads have pieces of wood instead of quills as 
rattlers. The drumstick, like that of the Ungavas, is of reindeer horn, or else, as 
if to add to the din, a gun-cap box is pierced through from side to side and a few 
pebbles or shot placed within. A stick is then inserted through the hole in the box, 
and the whole covered with buckskin to prevent separation of the lid and box. 
This makes a distracting noise. 

Turner, describing the use of the drum, says: 

Nothing is done, nothing contemplated, without sounding the drum. It is silent 
only when the people are asleep or on a tramp from one locality to another. If a 
jjerson is ill the drum is beaten; if a person is well tlie drum is beaten; if prosper- 
ous in the chase a drum is beaten, and if death has snatched a member from the 
community the drum is beaten to prevent his spirit from returning to torment the 
living. The drumbeat is often accompanied with singing, which is the most dis- 
cordant of all sounds supposed to be harmonious. 

NORTHWEST COAST. 

" The Indians of the Northwest Coast " is the title of a paper by 
Lieut. Albert P. Mblack, U. S. i!^^., based on collections in the United 
States National Museum and on personal observation in connection 
with the survey of Alaska in the seasons of 1885, 1880, and 1887. The 
locality most affected was the coast and islands in southern Alaska and 
northern British Columbia. The musical instruments which he found 
were drums, whistles, and rattles, which are described in his paper.' 

Drums. — The usual type of drum is that shown on plate 70 (his plate 
LVII), which consists of a piece of deerhide or sheepskin stretched 
across a circular wooden hoop. They are similar, though not identical, 
with the drum of the Point Barrow and Hudson Bay Eskimo heretofore 
described. It has the bear as a totem. It is beaten with an ordinary 
bass drumstick. 

Whistles. — Whistles are shown in great variety on xjlates 71 and 72 
(his plates LXI and LXII). Some of these devices make a hideous noise, 
especially such as fig. 1 (plate 71), consisting of a wooden whistle and a 
bladder like a toy balloon, or flg. 2 (plate 71), a whistle backed by a pair 
of bellows to furnish the wind. The most elaborate instrument of this 
kind is shown in figs. 3 and 1 (plate 71), both being views of the same; 
the former put together ready for use, the latter showing the pieces in 
detail. It consists of six pieces of wood, forming a kind of trumpet 
with five openings, a continuous narrow band of silk being stretched 
through these openings. It is blown from the small end, trumpet- 
fashion, when each section gives forth its sound on a different pitch. 
Figs. 1 and 2 (plate 72) are views of the same kind of instrument blown 
flute fashion. The other instruments are like a flageolet, some of 
them having several finger holes to change the notes. Fig. 3 (plate 72)

litis a reed or vibrating piece within, ;is shown in the sectional view 

(fig. ^). 

Rattles.— These are usually of cedar, generally in sections neatly 
joined, elaborately carved, and i)ainted with appropriate totem designs. 
The usual form is a hollow wooden chamber witli a dozen or more small 
pebbles in it. The most primitive mentioned by the early voyagers is 
composed of two hoops joined by a wooden crosspiece, the circumfer- 
ence being closely strung with the beaks of the puffin.— (His fig. 73, 
plate XVIII.) 

Lieutenant Kiblack witnessed one of the great ceremonial dances of 
these people at Fort Wrangell, September, 18S7. Describing their 
nnisic and musical instruments,^ he says: 

It consisted in riiising the feet alternately in quick succession as higli as possible, 
Avithout niovini;' the body, to the sound of a drum, chorus, and rattle. 

He quotes Dawson's description of a dance: 

■" * " Some had rattles, and added to the din by shaking these furiously at the 
accentuated parts of the song. * * " The drum was beaten very regularly -with 
double knocks, thus — tum tum, tum tum, turn turn — and with the sound the dancers 
kept time in a sort of chant or song. * -^ ^ 

And from Laugadorff:^ 

One of the dancers seems, as it were, to load the rest, carrying in his hand a thick 
sort of staff ornamented with the teeth of sea otters, which he struck upon the 
ground to mark the measure. * The women sit on the ground at a distance 

of some paces from the dancers ;ind sing a not inharmonious melodj", which supplies 
the music. 

OREGON— (HUPA INDIANS). 

Drums, rattles, awl whistles. — Capt. P. H. Ray made an extensive 
ethnological collection from the Indians in the llupa Eeservation, whicli 
is described by Professor Mason in the Smithsonian Report for 188G.-' 

Speaking of the musical instruments, he says: 

Rattles employed by medicine men and in gambling are composed of many hoofs 
and hoofl(^ts of the blacktail deer. Each piece is pierced through the apex and sus- 
pended on a short thread, upon which four white beads are also strung. These 
pendants are then fastened to a long belt of cloth or leather and worn around the 
waist or held in the hand. The hoofs striking together produce a sharp rattling 
sound. A small, graceful lens-shaped rattle, mounted on a. stick, is held in the hand 
of the dancer. (Fig. Ill, plate 73. His plate XXYI.) 

The Ilnpa drum is a rectangular box, covered Avitli leather, and has little merit as 
a musical instrument. (Fig. 118, plate 73. His plate XXVI.) 

The Hupa make tolerably agreeable music on a small bone whistle, made either 
single or double. (Figs. 115-117, plate 73. His plate XXVI.) 

Professor Mason concludes with the statement that by the similarity 
of these with the prehistoric instruments found in the ancient graves

of so-utliern California and. the islands of the coast the continuity of 
music in prehistoric times is made out, and he wisely observes (p. 235) : 

It is au important principle, which archa-ologists sometimes overlook, that arts may 
survive and obey tlie laws of technic evolution even though the men through whose 
instrumentality they live and have their being have no immediate blood relationship. 

To which the author is tempted to add that the survival of identical 
arts among peoples widely separated by time or space is not evidence 
of independent discover}^ or separate invention. The underlying idea 
of Professor Mason's statement is that this survival of similar arts 
must have been by teaching of some sort which could only have been 
accomplished by contact or communication interme- 
diate between the peoples. While a similarity of arts 
(or of language) is not evidence of consanguinity be- 
tween different peoples, yet it is evidence of a high 
order, sufficient in the absence of anything to the con- 
trary, to carry conviction that there has been commu- 
nication between them of some sort. 

CALIFORNIA. 

Bone ivhistlcs or flageolets.- -There are in tbe Museum 
a number of bone whistles or flageolets, obtained from 
ancient graves on the California coast and the adjacent 
islands. The majority are made of the long bones of 
birds. The simpler forms are plain tubes of various 
lengths, one end being closed with asphaltum. In 
others a square or oval vent hole is cut; in most cases 
near one end, but sometimes nearer the middle. In 
many specimens there is a transverse ridge of asphaltum 
fastened to the inside of the tube immediately below 
the hole, which deflects the current of air over the edge 
of the hole and makes tbe musical tone as in a flageolet. 

Fig. 201: represents a whistle of bone 3.4 inches in 
length, from Santa Cruz Island. (Schumacher collec- 
tion.) One end is closed, and there is a transverse ridge of asi>haltum 
within the tube beneath the vent hole. It is blown from the end, flag- 
eolet fashion, and emits but a single note, thus:

in its present condition it would not be of use even in a musician's hands. As will

Fig. 207 represents ;i boue whistle from an aucieut grave on San 
Miguel Island, California (Bowers collection). It is made from a tibia 
of the deer {Cariacns iHrginiamis). The upper end has been cut off, 
the cellular portion of the bone removed, and a side hole placed about 
1| inches from the open end. Opposite this opening and extending to 
the end on the inside are remains of gum or asphaltum, which formed 
an air passage on the principle of the modern flageolet. By restoring 
this with clay, I was enabled to get a sound or note on the instrument 

thus : 8ra.

There are two other whistles of like form from Santa Cruz Island 
(Cat. Nos. 26273 and 26274 U.S.N.M.), but so much cracked and 
weathered that no attempt was made at restoration. 

Fig. 208 represents one of three instruments lately received from Mr. 
J. iSTeale Plumb, of New York. They are from San Clemen te Island, 
and were obtained by Mr. Plumb during the summer of 1895 while 
exploring the shell heaps and graves on the island. There were five of 
these instruments found together in one grave. These are also made 
from the tibia of a deer, but, unlike the whistle just described, the 
lower or smaller end of the bone is cut away to form the mouthpiece.

This has been carefully worked and smoothed all around. The side or 
vent hole is about an inch from the end. Small pieces of gum forming 
the air passage still adhere to the inside of the tube. There are no 
finger holes, and consequently only one tone could be produced. On 
the outside are traces of asphaltum, evidently used to hold in place a 
wrapping of some kind, and near the larger end an ornament made from 
a i)iece of iridescent Haliotis shell is held in place by the same mate- 
rial. The instruments found by Mr. Plumb are of unequal lengths, 
show no traces of asphaltum on the larger end as do the Schumacher 
specimens (fig. 209), and they were probably intended to be used singly. 
These were described by Prof. E. S. Holden.'

eigiit double whistles or pipes, aud on Sau Clenieiite, 
one, which is here represented as fig. 209. These 
were made from the tibia of a deer, joined together 
and held in position by having the lower ends in- 
serted in a mass of asphaltiim and then wonnd with 
bark, which in its tnrn was covered with asphaltum 
and extending nearly the entire length of the in- 
strument. At the distance of an inch and a quarter 
from the open end were vent holes, one in each bone, 
with a mass or bridge of asphaltum placed inside 
in such positions and of such size as to leave but a 
small space for air. The open ends of both instru- 
ments were inserted in the mouth, and it was doubt- 
less blown flageolet fashion. 

A bone fife or flageolet is represented by fig. 210, 
which, being without mouthpiece, is simply a bone 
cylinder as represented, with four finger holes, and 
was made from the femur of a bird. Contrary to the 
foregoing specimen (fig. 209), it is very white and 
highly polished, with a uniform thickness. It was 
obtained by Mr. Schumacher from a grave on Santa 
Cruz Island. 

Fig. 211 represents an instrument made from the 
ulna of the brown pelican. It is without mouth- 
])iece, but has four small finger holes. It is from 
San Miguel Island, California, and was collected by 
Mr. W. H. Dall. The ends are so much weathered 
and broken that it is impossible to say of what the 
whistling apparatus consisted. There are, however, 
in the Ethnological Museum collection bone flageo- 
lets from Costa Rica (see fig. 273), identical in 
shape with the one just mentioned aud giving a 
series of musical tones. In these the mouthpiece 
is at the larger end, which is filled with gum or 
asphaltum, leaving an air passage which connects 
with a vent hole about 1;^ inches distant. It seems 
probable that the California specimens were con- 
structed in tlie same way, but they have become 
fiagile by age and other causes, and in only one or 
two instances can any tone be produced. 

The following list will give the additional instru- 
ments in the United States National Museum, the 
catalogue numbers, with the kind of instrument 
and the locality where found, collected principally 
by Messrs. Schumacher and Bowers:

that they have been blown upon not as a flageo- 
let, but across the hole in the open end of the 
tube instead of across the lateral hole in the side. 
What use the four linger holes were is quite un- 
determined, for, while they are not too great in 
number, they are so far apart that no person can 
cover them all at the same time. 

Brums and rattles. — There seems to have 
been among the California aborigines, whether 
ancient or modern, an almost total absence of 
these instruments or any musical instruments of 
percussion. 

Oapt. George M. Wheeler, United States Engi- 
neer in charge of the geographical survey west 
of the one hundredth meridian, and principally g 
on the coast of southern California, made, or g 
caused to be made, extensive archneological in- §, 
vestigations into the jirehistoric occupation on ^ S 
the Paciiic coast of southern California, especially ^ ^ 
among the islands. This expedition had the aid i§ ^ 
of persons at that time the best qualified in the I i I 
United States to make such investigations. The ^ |" 3 
result was published in Volume VII of the series, k: ^ ^ 
and is entitled "Archaeology." In the introduc- f I I 
tiou (p. 26), is found the following: I g I 

In the \vav of musical entertainiuents it is evident tliat s' ,S- 

^ ■ j^ 

the Californians were limited to very iiiimitive instru- ^j^ 

ments, the only kinds that have been found in the graves = 

consisting of whistles made of bones of animals. Some g 

of these, however, exhibit considerable ingenuity, and it F 

may be that they were played upon with skill. 



This statement is verified by Mr. W. H. Dall, 
verbally, whose opinion and observation is en- 
titled to great weight because he had, prior to 
that time, made elaborate and extensive eth- 
nologic investigations among the aborigines of 
Alaska, prehistoric and modern, where he had 
found such an extensive and almost universal 
use of the drum. 

The United States National Museum possesses 
neither drums nor rattles from the southern coast 
of California, and as for rattles, while they are 
rare, tliose which are found belong to modern 
Indians far in the interior. They are also pecu- 
liar in their construction and quite different from 
those found elsewhere among the aborigines. 

Fig. 213 represents an object of pottery, possibly a rattle, from

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 



San Diego, California, collected by Mr. Edward Palmer. The finder 
reports it as a doll and not an idol nor a rattle. The lower iiart is 
spherical; a small orifice is shown in front; through this have been 
pushed two little x^ebbles a quarter of an inch in diameter. Whether 
the insertion of these pebbles was intentional or accidental, we have 
no means of knowing, nor is it known whether their insertion changed 
the character of the instrument in the intention of the maker from a 

doll to a musical instrument. The 
walls of the sphere are solid and 
quite thick, and not calculated to 
give off much sound, and, while the 
rattling of the two pebbles can be 
heard, yet they sound but faintly 
and can be heard only a short dis- 
tance. The more it is examined, 
the less certain is the conclusion 
that it was ever intended as a rat- 
tle. Another item is that the pro- 
tuberances representing ears have 
been pierced and, though the right 
ear has been pulled out and the 
string lost, yet in the left ear the 
hole is i^erfect and contains a 
string of white and green glass 
beads alternated. This would 
seem almost decisive iu favor of 
the object having been a doll and 
not a rattle, though it may have 
been used for both. 

Specimen, Cat. No. 165685 (U.S. 
N.M.) from the Porno Indians, 
Mendocino County, California, is 
a rattle made of the scrotum of an 
animal, cut open and sewed to- 
gether, inclosing pebbles or shot.

Fig. 214 represents a musical

length; the sound or vent hole is lateral and 2^ inches from the upper 
eud. The natural hollow of the bone forms the bore of the instrument, 
and is nearly filled with asphaltum at the vent hole, apparently for the 
purpose of reducing its size and giving the necessary vibrations when 
blown through the ui)per eud. Tliis asphaltum has so far deteriorated

leather is like a sack, ornamented with bead designs and two eagle 
feathers. Its length, not including sack, is 17 inches. 

Fig. 215 represents a flageolet of the Kiowa Indians. It is repre-

sum of $1.65. It is of cedar, lias been made in halves so as to work out 
the interior, and is then gummed, put together, and bound tightly by 
ten different strands of buckskin, which serve to keep it in place. 
They are each wound three or four times around and tied in hard 
knots, except that over the vent hole, which forms a bowknot, all the 
ends being allowed to hang, as shown in the figure. Its length is 18 
inches; its diameter, interior -^,r inch, exterior l^y inches. It has six 
linger holes put about equal distances apart and in the same relation 
to each other as in the white man's ordinary flageolet. The mouth 
hole is iu the upper end and has been carved out of the solid, as repre- 
sented in the figure. There is little doubt that this is a modern Indian 
instrument. Its scale is as follows :

The note G in the staff and the Gr above are a little sharp — between 
G and Ab. A series of notes obtained by cross fingering were only 
duplicates of tones already given. 

Fig. 216 represents a leg rattle of the Seminole Indians. It consists 
of fifteen shells of the box tortoise attached to a leather legging. The 
shells are perforated with small holes and filled with black seeds about 
1% inch in diameter. Its length is 14 inches and width lO.J inches. 

Dr. Daniel ix. Brinton, in a paper entitled "Native American stringed 
musical instruments,"' remarks: 

It is geiu-rally stated that the American Indians at the time of tho discovery ilid 
not use anywhere on tho continent a stringed instrnmeut. I have found, however, 
four examples which seem to controvert this, and I give them in the hope that the 
readers in Tho Antiquarian will be able to add to their number. 

He describes one as the "Apache fiddle," a small stringed instru- 
ment of one cord. The specimen is in the Museum of the University of 
Pennsylvania.

678 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

The resonator is a hollow reed about a foot in length, over which is stretched a 
strand composed of six or eight horse hairs. The strand is, at one end, wrapped 
around a movable crossbar, Avhich allows it to bo tightened at will. Tlie cord is 
sounded by means of a bow with a horsehair string. There is some doubt whether 
this is a genuine aboriginal invention. 

Another example is taken from Adair's History of the American 
Indians (p. 175), who relates that in 1740 he was among the "Mississippi- 
Nachee" Indians and witnessed a performance "on one of their old 
sacred ransical instruments, * * * 5 feet long and a foot wide on 
the head of the board, with eight strings made out of the sinews of a 
large buffalo." It was played with a bow which was managed by two 
Indians, one at each end. 

Another is the " quijongo" of Central America: 

A monocord, made by fastening a wooden bow with a stretched cord over the 
mouth of a gourd or jar, which serves as a resonator. The bow is usually a hollow 
reed about 5 feet loug, and the resonator is attached at one-third the distance from 
one end. The string is then bent down and fastened to the mouth of the jar. The 
notes are produced by striking the two sections of the string with a light stick, and 
at the same time the opening of the jar is more or less closed by the palm of the 
hand, thus producing a variety in the notes. 

His fourth is a specimen from the Metropolitan Museum, New York, 
and is described as a reed about 5 feet long, with a jar fastened at the 
middle point, above which is a bridge. To this are attached four strings 
of different lengths. The specimen is labeled as from the Upper Purus 
Eiver, Brazil, " Apurman Indians." But Dr. Brinton adds: 

No such tribe and no such instrument are mentioned by Martins, Markham, Ehren- 
reich, Von den Steinen, or Polak, so I can add nothing to the information on the 
label. 

Very nearly all interest in the foregoing as aboriginal stringed 
musical instruments is taken away by Dr. Brin ton's last paragraph : 

It is possible that in all these cases the instruments were borrowed with modifica- 
tions from the whites or negroes; but there is sufficient probability that they were 
aboriginal American inventions to make their further study desirable. The stringed 
instrument sometimes found in Central America, made by stretching cords over the 
concave carapace of an armadillo, or turtle, must be modern, as it has no native 
name in either Maya or Nahuatl. 

Professor Mason is sure that the aboriginal tribes of America had 
no stringed musical instrument whatever. 

Rowbotham^ says that the North American Indians were able to 
record their music by cutting notches in sticks, and he cites Schoolcraft, 
1, Chap. VI. He figures one of these sticks, declaring that the rise and 
fall of the tone necessary to produce the melody is indicated by the 
position of the notches, that a rising slope indicated a raise of the tone, 
this as they proceeded from left to right; and that a declivity of the 
notch or stick indicated a lowering of the tone, and that the abruptness 
in each case of the slope indicated the rapidity with which the rise or 
fall should be made. He also cites Kohl's Wanderings Around Lake 
Superior, pages 287-290, and Tylor's History of Mankind, page 157.

Whistles {limonite concretions).— Oertam whistles have been fouiifl, 
principally in Missouri, which beloiig to the epoch of the Mound Uuikl- 

ers or are surely pre-Columbian. 

They are limonite concretions which have 
been opened at one end, presumably where 
the crust is thinnest, the clay nucleus has 
been removed so as to leave a hollow inte- 
rior and the opened end of the shell ground 
to a beveled edge, moderately sharp and 
thin, so that being blown against it pro- 
duces a sound. The United States National 
Museum possesses a series of four of these.

larger objects, the most plausible being that by the medicine man for 
the pretended cure of disease. Their use for smoking or as whistles 
or calls has also been suggested. By proper manipulation they will 
emit a sound which can be heard for quite a distance, and it is possible 
they were used for that purpose. This remark applies to the tubes 
which have cylindrical holes drilled almost the entire length and then 
finished with one of smaller diameter (Nos. 1 to 8, i)late 74), and also 
to the class which have biconical holes, having been drilled from both 
ends (Nos. 9 to 11, plate 74), and then scooped out with a tool so that 
the hole conforms somewhat to the outline and is smallest in the center. 
No. 12 shows one of this class broken before the enlarging j)rocess had 
been begun. These objects, if musical instruments, were not whistles 
but trumpets, for the sound can only be made by blowing in the same 
manner as are instruments of that class. The materials are usually 
soapstone, banded slate, and chlorite, although specimens of sandstone 
are not wanting.

It is not at all certain that these are musical instruments, or were 
ever used as such, or if used it was other than sporadic or accidental. 
They are figured among the musical instruments for several reasons: 
(1) While the various uses have been suggested or surmised, no definite 
use has ever been discovered, and if not musical instruments, they are 
to be classed as unknown, or, as Dr. Rau says, enigmas ; (2) they can be 
made to i)roduce a sound by being blown trumpet fashion; (3) they 
have been claimed or classed as trumpets or horns for the making of 
signals or calls, as the trumpet calls of an army or encampment.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 



General Tliruston,' speakiug of stone tubes of hourglass form, quotes 
the following from Judge Haywood's History of Tennessee: 

When the stoue trumpet is blown through, it makes a sound that can be heard, 
perhaps, 2 miles, and that probably it was used for similar purposes to those for 
which the trumi^ets of the Israelites were used, namely, prin- 
cipally to convene assemblies and to regulate the movements of 
an army. 

General Thruston's experience with these tubes does 
not seem to have been satisfactory, for he adds: 

We have exhausted our blowing powers upon two similar 
"stone trumpets" in our collection without eliciting any satis- 
factory resjionse in the way of nuisic or noise, and we scarcely 
think it possible that these tubular objects could have been de- 
signed "for martial music," as stated. 

No expression of opinion is here made as to the 
correctness of these claims, but we have not ignored 
or reiected them. To do so would be to decide the 
question adversely and cut oft" further argument. It 
is deemed wiser to insert the figures of these objects, 
calling attention to their claims as musical instru- 
ments, to the possible end that 
future investigators may discover 
something concerning their use and 
thus be enabled to settle the ques- 
tion. So far as the writer can dis- 
cover in the publislied descriptions 
of these objects, their use as mu- 
sical instruments is rarely ad- 
vanced.

Mr. W. H. Holmes,- in speaking 
of the pottery of the ancient Pueb- 
los, says : 

The ancient people had not devoted 
their ceramic art to trivial uses; there 
are no toys, no rattles, and no grotesque 
figures. 

This remark would seem to apply equally as well to 
the Cliff Dwellers; but that musical instruments 
made of other materials were not unknown to these 
people is evidenced by the fact that among the 
objects mentioned by the late G. Nordenskiold as 
coming from the cliff ruins of the Mesa Yerde, in southwestern Colo- 
rado, are fragments of a wooden flute and a small bone pierced with

a lateral hole aiul possibly used as a wbistle. Speaking of these two 
objects, he says : ' 

Amon- tlio woodon objects, somo fragments of a flute fonnd in Spring House 
should Tlso be mentioned. [Here reproduced as tig. 222.] The tlute was made of a 
bough Its diameter was 2.5 centimeters. The longest fragment measured 4d centi- 
meters and was pierced with three holes. In a smaller fragment, which could not 
bo fitted together with the rest, was a trace of a fourth hole. 
Of the bone object he says (description of plate XLI) : 

The above figure [here represented in fig. 223] shows a bone implement pierced 
with a little hole, and perhaps used as a whistle.

There seems to be no reason why the use ascribed to these objects 
by Professor Nordenskiold should not be accepted. A people with an 
art culture so highly developed in other directions might easily have 
invented and used musical instruments.

Quite a number of articles of this group may perhaps be properly classed as 
'aucient," and were obtained more or less uninjured. 

And also (pp. 335, 330) that the 

ornaments and musical instruments employed in 
dances and religious ceremonies do not differ 
much among the Pueblo Indians, the principal 
ones being the drum, rattles made from gourds, 
notclied sticks, a kind of tliite, and a turtle-shell 
rattle. 

Drums. — Fig. 224 represents one of 
these instruments. Mr. Stevenson's de- 
scrii)tion (p. 398, fig. 581) is as follows: 

A flat drum made by stretching goat hide over 
a wide hoop and tightened by lacing crosswise 
around the edge with a cord of the same material. 
One side is plain, the other is decorated with a 
figure which is not interpreted. This specimen is 
from Shinumo, but it does not differ from those 
used by many of the other tribes. 

A. large drum {Pur-'pi-shuk-pi-'po-ya) 
Cat. No. 128922 (U.S.N.M.) is of more 
primitive construction from the Hopi 
Indians of Arizona. The shell is made 
from an irregular shaped section of a hollow log 15f inches long or high 
and 18 inches in largest diameter. Two rawhides are stretched over the 
ends without hoops to make the heads, and are laced together with a 
strip of the same material.

A primitive form of rattle (Tohi mo Mu-to-pa), Cat. No. 9400G

Fig. 229 represents auotlier rattle of this class from Zuni, New Mex-

Specimen of a rattle or musical instrument 
made from the shell of a turtle, which is highly 
esteeraeil by the Pueblo tribes. The tiesh of the 
turtle is carefully removed from the shell, leav- 
ing it hollow. To the edges of the breastplate 
are attached the toes of goats or sheep. These 
toes, coming in contact with the hollow shell, 
produce a peculiar sound, in keeping with the 
sound caused by the gourd rattles used in the 
same ceremony. The rattle is fastened to the 
rear of the right leg near the knee when em- 
ployed in the dances. 

Fig. 230 represents a so-called musical 

instrument from Hopi, Arizona. It is a 

stick 18i inches long, with coarse notches 

on one side, across 

which the scapula of 

a deer or other animal 

is rubbed to produce 

the sound. 

Wind instruments. — 
The wind instruments from the Pueblo Indians here 
mentioned are of two classes: (1) Direct flutes or 
hollow tubes of wood, blown across one end; (2) in- 
struments which have a mouthpiece, made on the 
same j)rinciple as the modern flageolet. 

Specimen, Cat. No. 69192 (U.S.N.M.) is one of the 
first class {Le-na). It is a hollow cylinder of wood 
with five finger holes, three in one group and two in 
the other. One end of the tube is beveled from the 
inside, making a sharp edge, against which the air is 
forced when blown. From Hopi, Arizona. Length, 
27^ inches; diameter, 1| inches. 

A sacred flute {Shoh-Koonne), Cat. No. 69312 
(U.S.N.M.), is from Zuni, New Mexico, and is blown 
in the same manner as the preceding. It is made 
from a slightly tapering reed, and has four finger 
holes arranged in pairs widely separated. On the 
lower end is attached a flaring rim mad*^ from a piece 
of gourd, upon which are painted designs in bright 
colors. Length, 26 inches; diameter, ^ inch at 
smaller end. 

An instrument of the second class (flageolet) is 
shown in fig. 231. It is made from a hollow reed or cane, and has four 
finger holes. A piece of wood flattened on one side for an air passage

is inserted in the bore and forms the mouthpiece. To the lower end 

is attached a tlariug riiu made of a piece of gourd gayly colored. The 
mouthpiece is somewhat mutilated, making it 
impossible to obtain the scale of the instru- 
ment. It is from Zuhi, New Mexico. Length, 
13 inches; diameter, 1 inch. 

Fig. 232 is an instrument made of pottery, 
lately received by the National Museum from 
Mr. H. D. Thompson, of Moline, Illinois. Its 
remarkable similarity to specimens from Central 
and South America was deemed of sufficient im- 
portance to justify a description in this paper. 
According to Mr. Thompson, it was found sev- 
eral feet below the surface in the Mississippi 
Kiver drift while excavating for a factory foun- 
dation. It is the only specimen of its kind found 
in the eastern or central United States that has 
thus far come to our notice. Its shape is that 
of an animal head (somewhat cat-like). By re- 
ferring to the sketch it will be seen that the 
whistling mechanism is in the mouth of the 
animal and the eyes served as sound or finger 
holes. Unfortunately the mouthpiece is broken 
and the original scale of the instrument can 
not be given. Three notes, however, were pos- 
sible. Pottery whistles of bird and animal 
shapes are 
frequentl y 
found in 
M exico, 
C en tral 
and South 
America, 
as will be 
seen later, 
and the 
whistling 

apparatus in all is identical with 

the one here figured. Mr. Thomp- 
son (the owner) was somewhat 

skeptical as to the antiquity of 

this instrument, but the writer 

can only say that if it had been 

received from Central America 

its genuineness would not have been questioned, so closely does it 

resemble the pottery whistles from that region.

Mexico. 

Music evidently occupied a prominent place in the arts of the ancient 
Mexicans, for it is nieutioned by the early [Spanish writers in connection 
with war, religions ceremonies, and festivals of various kinds. The 
instruments described or mentioned were drums, timbals, flutes, horns, 
trumpets, and rattles. According to Clavigero,^ they had no stringed 
instruments. 

Of their use in war or military movements Bernal Diaz^ relates: 

We saw the enemy in the plain in our front, advancing against us, sounding their 
trumpets, horns, and drums. 

Again he says (p. 297) : 

Before we arrived at our quarters and while the enemy were pursuing us, we heard 
their shrill timbals and the dismal sound of the great drum from the top of the great 
temple of the god of war, which overlooked the whole city. 

Clavigero^ also mentions the use of musical instruments in war: 

They began the battle (as was usual in ancient Europe and among the Romans) 
with a most terrible noise of warlike instruments, shouting and whistling, which 
struck terror to those not accustomed to hear it. 

Of the religious music in charge of the priests the same author says 

(p. 43): 

The Ometochtli was the chief composer of the hymns which were sung at festi- 
vals; * * * the Tlapixcatzin, the master of the chapel, who not only appointed 
the music, but superintended the singing and corrected the singers. 

Of songs and dances Don Antonio de Mendoza, in a second letter * to 
Emperor Charles V, says : 

Indians accompanying their dances and songs with flutes marked at the places 
where fingers are to be placed. The flutes are of different sizes. The singers beat 
time as with us. They sing in accord with those playing. 

Prescott,^ in speaking of the domestic manners of the Atzecs, says: 

As soon as they had finished their repast the young people rose from the table to 
close the festivities of the day with dancing. They danced gracefully to the sound 
of various instruments, accompanying their movements with chants of a pleasing, 
though somewhat plaintive character.

INSTRUMENTS OF PERCUSSION. 

Drtima (teponaztli). — There is no representative of the ancient Mexi- 
can drum in tlie United States National Museum, and those here shown 
in tig. 2;53 a, b, are copied from the worli of Carl Eugel.^ His descrip- 
tion is as follows : 

The tepoDiiztli of tho Aztecs is generally made of a single block of very hard 
wood, somewhat oblong square iu sliajK^, which they hollowed, leaving at each end 
a solid piece about .^ or 4 inches in thickness, and at its upper side a kind of sound-

board, about a quarter of an inch in thickness. In this sotmd-board, if it may be 
called so, they made three incisions, namely, two running parallel some distance 
lengthwis.s of the drum, and a third running across from one of these to the other, 

just in the center. » By this means they obtained two vibrating tongues 

of wood, which, when beaten witli a stick, produced sounds as clearly defined as 
those of our kettledrums. By making one of the tongues thinner than the other,

they insiirefl two dift'erent souuds, the pitch of which they were enabled to regulate 
by shaving off more or less wood. The bottom of the drniu they cut almost entirely 
open. Tli(^ traveler M. Ncbcl was told by archixjologists in Mexico that these instru- 
ments always contained the interval of a third, but on examining several specimens 

which he saw in museums, he found some in 
which the two sounds stood toward each 
other in the relation of a fourth, while in 
others they constituted a flfth, in others a 
sixth, and in some even an octave. This is 
noteworthy, inasmuch as it points to a con- 
formity with our diatonic series of intervals, 
excepting the seventh. 

The teponaztli was generally carved with 
fanciful and ingenious designs. It was beaten 
with two drumsticks covered at the end with 
an elastic gum called ule, which was obtained 
from the milky juice extracted from the Mexi- 
can ule tree. Some of these drums were so 
small that they used to be carried on a string 
or strap, suspended around the neck of the 
player; others, again, measured upward of 5 
feet in length, and their sound was so power- 
ful that it could be heard at a distance of 3 
miles. In some rare instances a specimen of the teponaztli is still preserved by the 
Indians in Mexico, especially among tribes who have been comparatively but little 
affected by intercourse with their European aggressors. 

Battles {ayacaclitli). — The rattle appears to have occupied an imijor- 
tant place in the ceremonies of the ancient 
Mexicans. In construction it was similar to the 
rattles commonly used by the Indians of thejires- 
ent day, which are round or oval in shape and 
usually made of a gourd, into which is inserted 
a wooden handle. A number of small pebbles 
were inclosed in the hollowed gourd. ^ 

E-attles made of pottery were also used, and 
there are in the Museum quite a number of these 
ancient instruments. Fig. 234 represents one of 
a series — the simj)le8t form (Batchelor collec- 
tion). It is round and the outer surface is orna- 
meuted with incised line decoration in panel- 
like designs. They are perforated with a num- 
ber of holes, in most cases not placed with any 
particular regularity. The inside is furnished 
with small clay pellets, which produce the sound. 
Another form is shown in fig. 235, which is a ''^'' 

double bell or rattle (Blake collection). Its shape is like two small 
gourds with the stems twisted together so as to form a handle. A 
straight slit divides the globular bodies almost in half, exposing 
the clay pellets which produce the sound. The painted decoration

is quite simple, consistiug of liues and dots in black. The sound of 
this rattle is clear and distinct — similar to that of metallic bells. 

A recent addition to the Museum (Cat. Ko. 196675, U.S.N.M., Phil- 
lips collection), is a gourd shaped rattle modeled in grayish colored 
clay, the neck or handle representing a grotesque human head. The 
globular part containing clay pellets is divided in the same manner

as the preceding (fig. 235), and in addition there are two small holes 
placed on opposite sides of the chamber in a line transverse to the 
division or slit. The clay is not well baked and the sound is rather 
feeble.

There are a number of broken pottery instruments or objects in the 
United States i^ational Museum which at first sight were thought to 
have been rattles. They are in the form of a slightly tapering tube, 
varying in length from 2 feet to G inches, and in diameter from 1^- to 
1^ inches. In some of these a serpent or reptile's head containing a 
clay pellet is represented at one end, as shown in fig. 230. Tlie clay is 
well tempered and the sound produced quite brilliant. Eecent acces- 
sions from Mexico, however, furnish evidence that the above are handles 
of vessels used in religious ceremonies (incense burners?), the rattle 
probably serving an accessory purpose. Among the objects recently 
found by Mr. Edward Palmer in a burial cave at Dos Caminos, 25 miles 
east of Acapulco, were twenty-nine fragments. Ten of these are the 
upper part of handles with a portion of the bowl still attached, and 
nineteen are the lower ends terminating in heads of reptiles. One ves- 
sel has been suflicieutly restored to indicate its character, and is here

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 



introduced as fig. 237. It is in tlie form of an open- work bowl, the out- 
side being- ornamented with panel-like designs in low relief. A long 
hollow handle projects from one side, which may have terminated with 
a rattle, as shown in fig. 236. The similarity of these pieces or handles 
to the ones already possessed by the Museum was immediately recog- 
nized, and with the bowl-shaped additions lately received their identity 
was established. Pictographs rejiresenting certain religious ceremo- 
nies in which are priests holding like instruments are given by 
Chavero.^ 

Of the use of incense burners by the Mexican priests, Clavigero^ 
says: 

For iucense tlieygouerally make use of copal, or soiuo otlier aromatic gum, * * * 
The ceusers were commouly uiade of clay, but they had also censers of gold.

emy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia.

Bells [tzilinilli). — The only instruments of metal in the Museum col- 
lection of Mexican antiquities are the bronze bells.( ?) These appear to 
have been in general use by the Mexicans before the Spanish conquest, 
and they are often found figured in the picture writings representing 
the various objects which the Aztecs used to pay as 
tribute to their sovereigns. One of these bells is 
shown in tig. 239. Mr. W. H. Holmes, in "Ancient Art 
in the Province of Chiriqui," ^ says : 

A question as to the authenticity of these bells naturally 
arises, and it maj^ be difficult to show to the satisfactiou of the 
skeptical miud that any particular specimen is not of European 
origin or inspiration. At the same time we are not without 
strong evidences (historical and otherwise) that such bells were 
in use by the Americans before the advent of tlie whites. * * * 
The form originated, no doubt, in the rattle, at first a nutshell 
or a gourd; later it was modeled in clay. With the acknowl- 
edged skill of these people in the working of metals, there is no 
reason why the bells described should not have been manufac- 
tured independently of European aid and influeuce, provided 
the requisite metal was at hand. It should be observed that, if 
these early American bells were copied from or based upon 
Si)anish originals, they would not vary greatly in type with the 
various seitions from which they are recovered, but it is ob- 
served that marked and persistent differences do occur. The 
well-known Mexican bell, an example of which is here outlined in fig. 44 [our fig. 239], 
although of bronze, is generically distinct in form and construction. 

Similar bells in the United States National Museum not figured are 
as follows :

Whistles or flageolets {pottery). — The ancient instrnmentsof tlie class 
which are here to be described form a most interesting series; not 
only those from Mexico, but the simi- 
lar ones from Central and South 
America. They show in some degree 
the progress which tlie aborigines had 
made in the arts, and that a nuisical 
system, however crude, had been at- 
tained. The whistling mechanism in 
all is identical with that of the mod- 
ern flageolet, and the only distinction 
that can be made between them is by 
classing the instruments which only 
emit one sound or note, as whistles, 
and those which have one or more 
linger holes, as flageolets. The simple 
form may have served only as calls 
or signals. The smaller instruments 
are mostly grotesque caricatures of 
the human face or figure or of animals or birds. The larger instru- 
ments arc more like the modern flageolet. Fig. 240 represents one of 
the smaller class. The body of this is a short tube with one end closed. 

A prolongation at right 
•; angles to the tube forms 

the mouthpiece, and on 
the upper part, where the 
two are joined, is i)laced 
a figure representing a 
bird with two heads. It 
is modeled in grayish-col- 
ored clay, uupainted. 
Closing the end hole will 
give the lower note, when 
opened the higher one, as 
seen in the accompanying 
scale : -♦-

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 



Professor Kollman^ figures and describes iustruments of this and 
other Mexican types in a paper entitled "Floteu und Pfeifen aus Alt- 
Mexiko" (in the Festschrift published by Riemer in Berlin in commemo- 
ration of the seventieth birthday of Adolf Bastian.) These instru- 
ments form part of a series of Mexican antiquities belonging to the 
ethnographic collection in Basel. They were obtained in Mexico by 
Henri Lukas Vischer during the years 1828-1837. A translation, most 
kindly furnished by Mr. H. von Bayer, of Professor Kollmau's descrii^- 
tiou of the double-headed bird whistles, is as follows : 

On the fife (fig. 4) there 
is an imitation of a prairie 
hen {Bonasa ciqnclo). An- 
other fife of our collection 
shows a pair of these hens 
united similar to the dou- 
ble eagle, as shown iu fig. 5. 
The animals are represent- 
ed iu a live attitude; the 
wings are spread, the head 
and tail held up, as if pre- 
pariiig to rise. Regarding 
the significance of these 
representations, both of the 
single and double bird, I 
fail to find any clow for ex- 
planation. Perhaps it is in- 
tended to indicate the true 
wedded life of men or of 
gods, since those hens live, 
as is known, monogamous, 
as do uiauy other species 
of wild fowl. Perhaps 
they express some motives, 
which render the birds so 
important in the minds of 
other peoples. This I will 
explain below. 

Fig. 5 [our fig. 240], A 
double eagle on the fife 
spreading the wings, with the tail raised, as if preparing for a downward flight to 
the earth, in contrast to the prairie hen (fig. 4), which, beyond doubt, aims to rise. 
The double eagle has but one body and one pair of wings ; the tail, however, is quite 
broad and shows a slightly marked division. In neither of the two figures are the 
legs plainly shown, as the former are attached to the fife by a rudely iorraed connec- 
tion of clay. The double figure has a sharply curved eagle-like beak. The entire 
shape of the head reminds one of the ancient Mexican representations of the white- 
headed eagle iu Central and South America. Our collection possesses several of 
these figures in clay. It is therefore very probable that the pre-Columbian Mexicans 
connected a certain significance with a double eagle, which also became an im- 
portant symbol of power with many civilized nations. 

Fig. 242 represents one of a series of pear or gourd-shaped whistles,

with a tapering stem or neck, which served as a mouthpiece. It is 
modeled in gray-colored clay and unpainted, with the exception of the 
mouthx)iece, which is colored dark red, and highly polished. The front 
portion of the instrument is ornamented in relief, and on the opposite 
side is a raised loop, forming a suspension hole. It has one sound

tremely crude representations of birds. The others, a dozen or more, 
were exceedingly rough, unpainted, and nearly all spherical. None of 
the instruments had more than one finger hole and consequently a 
scale of only two notes. 

Fig, 243 represents another instrument of the class, with more elab- 
orate ornamentation. It has but one finger hole, and with the normal 
force in blowing the following tones are produced:

Fig. 246 represents a whistle of a highly complicated design. A 
better idea of its appearance can be gained by referring to the sketch 
than is possible from a written description. Part of the mouthpiece is 
wanting, but it was probably furnished with one similar to those on the 
whistles heretofore described, and is here indicated by dotted lines in 
the sketch. It is the largest whistle in the Museum collection from

ment. The note produced is here given : 




In fig. 247 is shown a small whistle of unpainted black ware. It 
represents a grotesque human head. The neck serves as a mouthpiece 
and there is one sound hole placed under the chin. With the hole 
open no distinct tone can be made ; 
when closed the following note is 
emitted : K»- 



The American Museum of IsTatu- 
ral History in New York City has 
two whistles similar to the forego- 
ing, but representing a death's head 
or ma.sk. 

Fig. 248 shows another whistle 
caricaturing the human face. (Re- 
ceived from Hugo Finck.) It is 
modeled in coarse reddish clay and 
not painted. The air passage is 
through the neck and the venthole 
is represented in the widely open 
mouth. The interior of the head, 
which forms the air chamber, is so 
filled with earth and the specimen 
otherwise so mutilated that no 
sound can be obtained. This figure 
is only inserted in order to show 
the variety of forms which occur 
in these instruments. 

One example of a bird-shaped 
whistle (Oat. No. 196077, U.S.N.M., 
Phillips collection) is suggestive of 
the instruments so often found in 

Central and South America. It is roughly executed in dark gray-colored 
clay, unpainted. The legs and part of the head are broken and missing. 
There are four finger holes, two on each side of the body. These, being of 
unequal sizes, increase the number of sounds i)0ssible, but these differ- 
ences (in size) were probably not intentional, as all the details of model- 
ing show haste or unskilful work. The tail serves as a mouthpiece, and 
the notes obtained by a simple method of fingering are shown in the 
following scale: ^ «._lU_^!i.

material aud from the same locality as the preceding. The ornamen- 
tation, however, is different. Attached to the upper part of the tube 
about midway from each end is a disk ornamented in relief. Back of 
this are two projecting wings, and a sort of tail curves over the end of 
the tube, but leaving the bore entirely open. There are no linger holes, 
and the whistling apparatus is so much damaged that no musical 
sound can be produced. 

Tubular instruments with four finger holes and but little, if any, 
added decorations are represented in the National Museum by ttiree 
specimens found by Mr. Edward Palmer while exploring a cave situated 
in the Mortices district about 28 miles east of Colima, Mexico. All are 
modeled in rather coarse reddish clay. The largest (fig. 250a) measures 
13^ inches in length by f inch in outside diameter, the bore or inside 
being iH^ inch. The mouthpiece is formed by closing and flattening 
one end of the tube, and has the usual air passage and venthole. The 
finger holes are a little less than ^ inch in diameter, and are placed ^ 
inch apart, tlie lower one being 1 inch from the end of the tube. 
This instrument is well pre- 
served, but for some reason the 
tones emitted are weak, andean 
only be produced by blowing 
softly. Thenotes are as follows :

A smaller example (Cat. ISTo. 
107172, r.S.X.M.) is the same 
in lu'inciple. The venthole is, 
however, placed on the lower 
side (directly reversed from its 
position on the large instru- 
ment), and on the opposite upi^er surface, extending along the tube in 
a line toward the finger holes, a serpent is represented in low relief. 
The lower end is broken off, leaving only two finger holes. The remain- 
ing part measures 8i inches in length; outside diameter, j^ inch, and 
the bore, -i\r inch. Its notes, which are round aud full, are here indi-

These are obtained by using ordinary force in blowing. Increased 
power will produce their octave, aud, with added force, the fifth above 
is possible. 

With the two instruments just described Mr. Palmer found a double 
flute or flageolet (fig. 2501)). The tubes seem to have been made sepa- 
rately and then Inted together. At the lower end of each are four 
finger holes of the same size and distance apart as given in fig. 250a. 




602 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 



The nioutlipiece is broken off and missing, and whether the sounds 
produced were in unison or not it is impossible to determine. 

The instrument represented by fig. 251 is more like the modern flag- 
eolet in shape than any in tlie series. The lower part is missing, but 
its probable outline is indicated in the sketch by the dotted lines. It 

is modeled of gray-colored clay, 
highly polished, and has band 
decorations in red. The long, slen- 
der mouthpiece and upper part of 
the cylinder containing two finger 
holes is all that remains. Entire, 
it probably had four holes, the 
usual number in instruments of 
this shape. The notes that can be 
produced now are as follows :

This, of course, hardly gives an 
idea of the pitch and compass of 
the instrument originally. Speci- 
men, Cat. No. 133212 (U.S.KM.) 
evidently belongs to this class — 
nothing remaining, however, but 
the mouthpiece and enough of the 
cylinder to produce one note, thus :

Professor Kollman^ describes 
an instrument (one of twenty- 
four) of this class from Mexico, 
deposited in the ethnographic col- 
lection in Basel. It is fig. 1 (Flote, 
(j;09oloctli) of the previously mentioned paper, and a translation of 
his description kindly furnished by Mr. C. W. Shoemaker, of the 
Department of International Exchanges, Smithsonian Institution, 
here follows : 

Tho bell mouth is ornamented on the outer surface (fig. 1). The ornaments are 
apparently done by hand. They make a neat finish, which shows a taste for regular 
ornamentation and an advanced technique in the working of the, in itself, somewhat 
ungrateful material. The ornamentation of the bell mouth is often very rich and 
elegant. 



» Adolf Bastian, Festschrift znm 26 Juni, 1896, pp. 560, 561. See p. 596. 



PEEHISTORIC ART. 



603 



The bell mouths were painted with a white color, which uow remains for the most 
part only in the deeper parts, but formerly probably covered the entire ornament. 
All the bell mouths with which I am acquainted are somewhat ornamented. In the 
flutes of reddish clay, the mouthpiece, almost to the wind hole, is often an intense 
red, and in color reminds one somewhat of terra sigillata. Neither the red nor the 
black color, however, is to bo attributed to glazing, but to a coloring matter which 
was burned in. 

A description of the twenty-four flutes or fragments of flutes would be superfluous 
in this place. They all resemble one another in a high degree. The number of the 
flnger holes, the form of the wind hole and of the mouthpiece, is alike in all. They 
diff'er only in the color (red and black) ; in height, which varies from 17^ to 25^ centi- 
meters; in the decoration of the bell mouth; and in the number of the color rings, 
whicli sometimes encircle the tubes near the finger holes. 

All the flutes which have hitherto been made known from Old Mexico are not alike 
in form, according to letters of Mr. .Seler ; the flutes mentioned in the manuscript of 
tlie Biblioteca Laureuziana are formed more like oboes, so far as the mouthpiece is 
concerned. It is bent at an obtuse angle. These flutes have also four finger holes, 
but no bell mouth. The tube is rather cut diagonally at the end. For an ornament

there is a neat red patch on the tube above the finger holes, while the color of the 
flute appears bright yellow. From the color it is to be assumed tliat the flutes pic- 
tured in the Sahiigun manuscript were made of reed. The red mass is doubtless the 
loop of riband or a small leather strap. 

In the collection of Gabriel Mas, in Munich, tlicre is a flute which has a divine figure 
on the front, probably Xipe the " Geschundenen." 

He adds in a footnote (2, p. 559) : 

It is not correct to designate this instrument as a flute; flageolet would be better. 
A flute occurs iu Europe under this name, and which is made on the same principle. 
But I will not quibble about the name flute, because it already occurs in literature. 

We are indebted to Mr. A. E. Douglas, of New York, for the loan 
of a flageolet (entire) from the valley of Mexico.^ Its shape is practi- 
cally the same as outlined iu fig. 251. A short description and its 
musical cai)acity are here given. 



» This specimen was purchased by Mr. Douglas from the Boban collection of Mex- 
ican anti(|uities sobl iu New York City, December, 1886, called in the catalogue 
(No. 14) Uilacapitzli, and from the valley of Mexico.

number of instruments of this class. They are of the finely polished red 
and black ware and have four finger holes. All are more or less broken. 

In the American Museum of Natural History at Central Park, New 
York, I saw one of these instruments with the bell mouth and decora- 
tions, similar to fig. 251 just described, and also to specimens in the 
South Kensington Museum figured and described by Carl Engel.' 

But there were two others, in fragments, which, instead of ending in 
a bell-shaped mouth, terminated in a man's head, face or mask of the 
usual Mexican type. The face looked directly in front and was only 
slightly larger in diameter than the tube. The instrument itself was 
nearly a cylinder with no variations in diameter. The forehead and 
sides of the face were firmly attached to and formed part of the tube. 
The orifice or venthole for the expulsion of air is placed under the chin 
and corresponds to the throat. 

Fig. 252 represents an instrument somewhat like those just described. 
It was lately i^resented to the Museum by Mr. Newton H. Chittenden, 
and is said to have been found in ancient Aztec ruins in Mexico. It is 
made of grayish-colored clay and painted black. The workmanship is 
rather rude and the clay not so well tempered as in some of the speci- 
mens before mentioned. The upi>er part is in the form of a grotesque 
human head with the tongue i^rotruding. The headdress is quite elab- 
orate and contains the whistling apparatus. There are two projections, 
one on each side of the hollow tube, which are ornamented with incised 
lines. The expanding bf^ll-shaped end is decorated in relief, and with 
incised lines and dots. There are four finger holes, but so much of 
the mouthpiece is missing that its former musical capacity can not be 
ascertained. 

The collection of Mrs. J. Crosby Brown, of New York, in the Metro- 
politan Museum of Art, Central Park, contains a number of instruments 
similar to the foregoing. They are figured in an interesting work 
entitled Musical Instruments and their Homes.^ Keferring to these 
instruments the author says in jiart: 

Wo must distinguish three different classes. The iirst consists of those which 
have heen introduced by the European invaders, the second consists of the instru- 
ments of native origin now in actual use, the third class are those which have been 
preserved in the various mounds and pyramids of the Aztecs. 

To the latter class the instruments here described undoubtedly belong. 

An instrument presented by Mrs. J. Crosby Brown is shown in fig. 
253. It is in the form of a reptile highly conventionalized. The body 
is a cylindrical tube, with the open end projecting below the neck of 
the reptile. At the opposite extremity the tube is enlarged somewhat 
to accommodate the whistling mechanism, and a tapering continuation 
forms the tail, which serves as a mouthpiece. There are four finger 
holes on the upper part or back. The lowest tone is obtained with all

By this combination the tone F^ is the 
same with all open or one hole stopi)ed. The 
note C# can only be made by fingering, as 
shown in scale No. 1. 

Fig. 254 represents an instrument carved in 
marble. The upper end is broken, but was 
evidently fashioned for the insertion of a 
mouthpiece similar to the modern flageolet, a 
portion of the vent hole still remaining. It 
has six sound holes, and the lower end is carv- 
ed in imitation of an alligator's head. A hast- 
ily constructed mouthpiece of wood (see re- 
storation) was inserted by the writer, and a 
rather imperfect scale obtained. The anti- 
quity of this instrument may not be very great. 
The fact of its having six finger holes suggests 
Euroi^ean contact, as in all other specimens of 
this class from the Western Hemisphere the 
usual number aj)pears to have been four holes. 

Prehistoric musical instruments made of 
wood are extremely rare. A material which 
decays so easily can not resist the influences 
of time, except under favorable conditions 
which retard its destruction. The wooden 
objects in the National Museum classed as pre- 
historic were all obtained from burial places, 
either in caves or graves. 

Fig. 255 represents a whistle made fi^om a 
hollow reed or cane. It was found in a pre- 
historic cavern near the Bay of Angeles, Lower 
California. One end is closed with resin and 
forms an air chamber. About 3 inches from 
the open end, which served as a mouthpiece, is a joint or knot in the

reed. At this point the tube is scooped out, leaving the natural barrier 
or division exposed. This formed a stop, which deflected the current 
of air (when blown into the open end) in the same manner as does the 
transverse ridge of asphaltum in the bone whistles from California 
heretofore described (p. 567). The outer surface is ornamented with 
incised bands and dots, which appear to have been burnt in. The speci- 
men is so much weathered that no definite sound is emitted. A smaller 
whistle from the same cavern differs only in having both ends open. 
The lateral hole is at the joint, as in the foregoing. These instruments 
are a part of a collection obtained by Mr. Edward Palmer, who made 
the exploration in 1887.' 

A flageolet, obtained from the Yaqui Indians of Sonora, Mexico, is 
shown in tig. 2iM\. It is made of cane, strengthened with bands of sinew. 
There are three sound holes, two on the upper surface near the lower 
end, and one below (which does not show in the drawing), placed 
between the third and fourth bands from the lower end. Length, 21f 
inches. A wooden plug cut away on one side so as to leave an air 
passage was inserted at the upjDer end and formed the mouthpiece.

During the ijrogress of this paper, Mr. Wilson, profiting by his 
attendance as Commissioner General of the United States at the Brus- 
sels International Exposition, 1897, visited the extensive Musce Instru- 
mental of the Conservatory of Music of Brussels. Its curator, M. 
Mahillon, himself a musical-instrument maker, having devoted much 
time, labor and money to its successful accomplishment, has united the 
musical instruments of all nations. He has prepared an analytic and 
descriptive catalogue of the instruments under his charge, which 
greatly increases the value of the collection. The policy of tlie Bel- 
gian Government has been to invoke for the benefit of the Museum the 
aid of its foreign representatives in the procuration of local instru- 
ments, whether primitive or modern. As a result, it has been, through 
the good offices of M. Dorenberg, Belgian consul at Puebla, ]\[exico, 
the fortunate recipient of a collection of Mexican instruments, all of 
wiiich are primitive, but quite a number prehistoric. These include the 
ToponaztU (Spanish Atabal) or drum, the Marimba, and the Chirimia (a 
sort of hautboy), and are said to be used together forming a primitive 
band. Along with these is a series, twenty-five, more or less, of whistles 
or flageolets similar to those heretofore represented. They figure in the 
INIusenm catalogue as ISTos. 819-821, 832-856, inclusive. :\Iost of them 
are apparently without holes and give but a single note which is remark-

ing the figures of men and animals. Around 
the neck of the vase, attached to, and forming 
part of the body, with the otlier ornamentation, 
are six whistles or flageolets, the mouth hole in 
each making its api)earance on the inner edge 
of the neck. None of these have finger holes, 
and each gives but asingle note, varying between 
A and B flat above the staff. No. 838 is a flag- 
eolet representing a salamander or alligator

SAN SALVADOR. 

Whistles. — Only a few musical instruments 
from San Salvador, Central America, are repre- 
sented in the Museum collection. In fig. 257 is 
shown a i)ottery whistle of unpainted ware in 
the shape of an animal head. There are no 
sound holes, and only one note is emitted: 




Fig. 258 represents a front and profile view 
of a whistle, also unpainted, from the same lo-

Musical instruments of percussion are wanting in the museum col-

being rexjresented. There is no reason to suppose, however, that none 
existed. Their immediate neighbors to the south (Chiriqui) have fur- 
nished mimerous examples of both drum and rattle. Mr.W. H.Holmes, 
in speaking of the ancient art of Chiri(iui,' says: 

So f.ir as tbe art of pottery lias come withiu luy observaiioii, it appears to indicate 
a somewhat closer relationship with the aucieut Costa Ricaa peoples than with those

The most important group 
of prehistoric musical instru- 
ments in the Museum in i)oint 
of numbers is from Chiriqui, 
deposited by Mr. J. A. Mci^iel. 
It embraces drums, rattles, and 
whistles of pottery, and a num- 
ber of bronze bells. Many of 
these have been figured by Mr. 
W. H.Holmes in his interesting 
paper on "Ancient art in the 
Province of Chiriqui," ^ and his 
descriptions have been here 
freely used. Whatever will be 
said in addition relates to ex- 
amples not figured by him, and 
is mostly from a musical stand- 
point, all of the wind instru- 
ments having been tested for 
the ijurpose of showing their 
capacity or possibilities in that 
direction.

The shape is somewhat like that of an hourglass, the upper part, however, being 
considerahly larger than the base or stand. In all cases the principal rim is finished 
with especial reference to the attachment of the vibrating head. The example i)re-

inch and a (|uartcr wide encircling the 
rim, and below it is a narrow ridge,

raised bands, intended to imitate twisted cords, encircle the most constricted part 
of the body, a single band similarly marked encircling the base. The surface is

Griivc at Moritana del IJufo, DLvala. This and 14 canteros, 1 stool, 5 stone hatch- 
ets, 3 "spincrs," and human bones, seem to have been the outfit of a musician. 

Mr. Holmes continues (p. 159, fig. 237): 

Tlie decorated specimen illnstrated in tig. 237 [our fig. 275] is imperfect, a few 
inclies of the base having been lost. The shape is rather more elegant than that of 
the other specimen, and the surface is neatly finished and polished. The ground 
color, or slip, is a warm yellow gray, and the decoration is in red and black. The 
rim, or upper margin, is rather rudely finished and is i)ainted red, and on the exte- 
rior is made slightly concave and furnished with a raised 
band to facilitate the attachment of the head.

Bells seeiu to have beeu in pretty gen-

races i)revious to the conquest. The form 
best known is the hawk bell, or common 
sleigh bell of the North. The globnlar 
body is suspended by a loop at the top and 
is slit on the under side, so that the tink- 
ling of the small free pellets of metal 
may be audible. Such bells are found in 
considerable numbers in the graA-es of 
Chiriqui, although I have no positive 
assurance that any of the examples in 
my possession were actually taken from 
graves which contained typical Chiri'iiiian 
relics of other chisses. The specimens

three-fourths of an inch in diameter. It is surmounted by the rude ligure of an 
animal, tlirough or beneatli the body of which is an opening or attachment of a 
cord. Others have simple loops at the top. The small perforated one belongs 1o 
Mr. .1. 1?. Stearns, of Short Hills, Xcw Jersey. The additional 
piece given in fig. 42 [ourfig. 2S0] is unique in conception. It 
represents a human head, which takes an inverted jidsition 
when the bell is suspended. Tlielowerpart of the bell f.>rms 
a conical crown to the head and the ring of suspension is at- 
tached to the chin. Double coils of wire take the place of the 
ears, and the other features are formed by setting on bits of 
the material used in modeling. This specimen belongs to the 
collection of Mr. Stearns. Many examples of more elaborate 
workmanship have been recovered from the tombs and are now 
to be found in the collections of America and Europe. A speci- 
men found many years ago on the Rio Grande near Panama, 
and figured in Harper's Weekly, was of gold and showed 
specific variations from the Chiriciuian pieces. It will be^ 
seen by reference to the outline given in fig. 43 [our fig. 281] 
that three very neatly shaped and gracefully ornamented 
bells are mounted upon a circular plate to which a short

Fig. 282 represents a small gold rattle 
from a prehistoric grave in the jirovince of 
Autioquia, Colombia, South America, re- 
ceived from Mr. Thomas Ilerran. The upper 
part is globular, and contains the metal pel- 
let which produces the tinkling sound. The 
stem or handle is tapering and encircled by 
raised fillets. It was evidently cast in a 
mold. The tone is weak compared with that 
obtained from the bells made of bronze 

previously mentioned, the natural properties 
of gold not being as resonant. 

WIND INSTRUMENTS — POTTERY. 

Double whistles. — These are the sim])lest 
form and need not be described separately. 
They are all pear or gourd shaped, joined 
above and below, and have an opening be- 
tween the necks. The mouthpieces are where 
the stems are joined, and aie so close to 
gether that both must be blown at the same 
time. Two tones are produced, and in a 
majority of the instruments these are identical in pitch. Where 
tliere is a ditterence it will be indicated in the accompanying 
scales. Fig. 283 represents one of this series, and the section in

In fig. 292 is shown a painted 
whistle with four ocelot-like heads. 
Tiiis is reproduced from Mr. 
Holmes's paper (p. lOS, fig-. 252), 
and his description in part is here 
given : 

The instrument consists of an oblong 
body, to which four o<elot-like heads 
are fixed, one at each end and the others 
at the sides. It rests upon four feet, in 
oue of which the mouthpiece is placed. 
The linger holes are in the side of the 
body, near the legs, as seen in the cut. 
The decoratiou, which consists of more 
or less conventional representations of 
the skin markings of the animal, is in 
black and red. 

Its notes are three, as follows: 





Fig. 293 represents an alligator- 
shai)ed whistle of painted ware. 
This is the largest specimen in tlie collection, and Mr. Holmes, in 
s))eaking of it (p. 100, fig. 2."»0), says: 

The air chamber is large, aud the sounds emitted are full and melodious and aire 
lower in pitch than those of any other instrument in the collection. The cavity in 
Ihe month and head is sepaiafed from the body chamber, and, with the addition of 
earthen pellets, probably served as a rattle. The mouthpiece is in the tail and the 
finger holes are in the sides of the body. 

Its three notes are shown in the accompanying scale:

Whistles in grotes<ine forms. — In this series are placed a limited num- 
ber of instruments from Chiriqui, in which the human ligure is repre- 
sented. Mr. Holmes,^ in speaking of these objects, says: 

The liuiuaii figure was occasioually utilized. The treatment, however, is extremely 
rude aud conventional, the, features having the jieculiar sqnirrel-like character 
shown in the figurines already given. The unique piece given in fig. 256 [our fig. 
298] represents a short, clumsy female figure with a squirrel face, carrying a vessel 
upon her back by means of a head strap, which is held in place by the hands. The 
mouthpiece of the whistle is in the right elbow and one sound hole is in the middle 
of the breast and the other in the left side. The costume and some of the details of 
anatomy are indicated by red and black lines in th(; original. 

Its three notes are as follows :

Specimen, Oat. Ko. 109059 (U.S.N.M.) is a painted whistle repre-

short and broad, with stumpy legs set wide apart, and the arms are 
attached to the body in relief. The hollow head contains a small clay 
pellet, which produces a rattling- sound. A prolongation of the left 
shoulder serves as a mouthpiece. There are two finger holes beneath 
the right shoulder, one on the breast and the other nearly opposite on 
the back. Its three notes are indicated in the accompanying scale:

Drum-shaped ivhistlcs. — In addition to the various forms wliich have 
been described tliere are a number of shapes copied from other musi- 
cal instruments. An interesting example is shown in fig. 301. The cut 

is reproduced from Mr. Holmes's paper,' 
and in speaking of this class of objects 
he says: 

A very interesting specimen, illustrated in

a drum, has not only the general shape of that 
instrument, 
but the skin 
head, with its

They will be found to occur nearer the lower than the upper limit of their ranges. 
It should be observed that the capacity for variation possessed by each of these 
notes enables the skilled performer to glide from one to the other without interrup- 
tion. This instrument is, therefore, within its limited range as capable of adjust- 
ing itself to any succession of intervals as is the trombone or the violin, I do not 
imagine, however, that the aboriginal performer made any systematic use of this 
power or that the instrument was purposely so constructed. It will be seen by 
reference to the scale that stopping the orifice in the end ojiposite the mouthpiece 
changes the notes half a tone, or perhaps, if accurately measured, a little less than 
that. 

Specimen, Oat. ISTo. 132754 (U.S.ISr.M.) is a smaller whistle, somewhat

to have been all that can be so classed. Fig. 308, collected by W. C. 

McCliutock, represents a rattle (shaJc-shak), made of thin strips of cane 
about one-eighth of an inch wide, and woven or 
plaited as in making bas- 
kets. At the lower end the 
strips are drawn together 
and lashed around a small 
spindle of wood with a cord 
of grass fiber, which forms 
the handle. The strips are 
of two colors, alternating as 
they are woven. The inside 
is furnished with small ])eh- 
bles or seeds, which produce 
the rattling sound. This 
sound, however, is quite 
feeble, owing to the nature 
of the material which forms 
the chamber. A similar in- 
strument in the Haldeman

the Carib Indians, British

and has four narrow slits or incisions about 4 

inches long — two vertical and two horizontal — 

on opposite sides. A number of small pebbles 

inside produce the sound when shaken. A piece 

of wood 29i inches long passes through the gourd 

and extends 15 inches beyond the upper part. 

The lower end or handle proper projects llj

difference in outline, as will be seen by referring to tlie sketch. Carl 
Engel mentions instruments of pottery somewhat like those just de- 
scribed, but of larger dimensions. Speaking of these,^ he says: 

The botuto, which Gumilla saw used by some tribes near the Orinoco (of which we 
engrave two examples) was evidently an ancient Indian contrivance, but appears to 
have fallen almost into oblivion during the last two centuries. It was made of 
bated clay and was commonly from 3 to 4 feet long; but some trumpets of this kind 
were of enormous size. The botuto with two bellies was usually made thicker than 
that with three bellies and omitted a deeper sound, which is described as having 
been really terrific. These trumpets were used on occasions of mourning and funeral 
dances. Alexander von Humboldt saw the botuto among some Indian tribes near 
the River Orinoco. 

The small instruments just described may be a survival of the ancient 
botuto.

Bone whistles or flageolets. — According to Ewbank, the aboriginal 
Brazilians had instruments of bone made on the same principle as the 
bone whistles from the Pacific coast, heretofore described. Fig. 312 is

PERU. 

Whistlim/ hottles. — Tliere are in the Museum a number of pottery 
bottles, obtained from ancient burial places in Peru, which are capable 
of emitting- musical sounds. Many of these vessels are double, with 
an interior connection at i)oint of contact, and those which are not 
double have two projections, one being the neck or mouth proper and 
the other terminating in the figure of a bird or animal which contains 
the whistling apparatus. The human form is also represented. It has 
been said that when pouring the water out, a sound imitating the note 
or cry of the bird or animal represented is produced.^ 

In experimenting with the bottles or instruments about to be 
described, the author has not been able to obtain any sound by pour- 
ing the water out. If the vessels are submerged in water, leaving the 
whistle above, their sounds or notes are given while the air is forced 
out by the incoming water. The clearest tone, however, is emitted by 
blowing, and the notes indicated in the accompanying scales were 
obtained in that way, using the open neck as a mouthpiece. The 
descriptions of these vessels by some writers (Boll*rt aud von Tschudi) 
hardly give due credit to the aboriginal potter. The mechanism by 
which the sound or note is produced is something more than a hole or 
opening through which the air is forced, for it is constructed on the 
principle of the flageolet, as are the instruments from Mexico and Cen- 
tral America previously described. On some of these vessels two notes 
can be produced, varying from a semitone to a major third above the 
lowest tone (tig. 314). In all cases the upper note is made by using 
more force in blowing. In the specimens which are indicated as emit- 
ting but one tone, no amount of manipulation will give anything else, 
as more or less force in blowing causes the tone to break. As a result 
of these trials, I am inclined to believe that the objects here described 
were intended to serve a double purpose — as water bottles and also as 
whistles. Carl Engel,'* in peaking of the ancient wind instruments of

the South American Indians, evidently refers to this class. His 
description is here given : 

ycveiiil of these barbaious contrivances scarcely deserve to be classed with musi- 
cal iustrunicnts. This may, for instance, be said of certain musical jars or earthen 
vessels producing sounds, which the reruviaus constructed for their amusement. 
These A^essels Avere made double, and the sounds imitated the cries of animals or birds. 
A similar contrivance of the Indians in Chile, preserved in the museum at Santiago, 
is described by the traveler S. S. Hill as follows : " It consists of two earthen vessels 
in the form of our india-rubber bottles, but somewhat larger, with a flat tube from 
4 to 6 inches in length uniting their necks near the the top and slightly curved 
upward, and with a small hole on the ui^per side one-third the length of the tube 
i'roni one side of the necks. To produce the sounds the bottles were filled with water 
and suspended to the bough of a tree, or to a beam, by a string attached to the 

middle of the curved tube, and then 
swung backward and forward in such 
a manner as to cause each end to be 
alternately the highest and lowest, so 
that the water might pass backward 
and forward from one bottle to the 
other through the tube between 
them. 15y this means soothing 
sounds were produced which, it is 
said, were employed to lull to repose 
the drowsy chiefs who usually slejjt 
away the hottest hours of the day. 
In the meantime, as the bottles were 
porous, the water within them dimin- 
ished by evaporation, and the sound 
died gradually away." 

The remarks in the quotation 
regarding the production of 
sound, i. e., by partially filling 
the bottles with water and 
swinging them back and forth, 
applies equally as well to the 
vessels in the museum collec- 
tion. This has been demon 
strated by experiment. The musical notation of these instruments ( ?) 
has, however, as before stated, been obtained by blowing in the open 
neck. Perhaps, as Engel says, they "scarcely deserve to be classed 
with musical instruments." 

Fig. 313 represents a vessel of painted ware with one chamber, col- 
lected by Admiral Charles Wilkes, United States Exploring Expedition. 
The ground color is dark yellow, upon which is laid in narrow stripes 
a red pigment of sufficient body to produce a slight relief effect. The 
spout or neck rises from one side of the vessel, and a handle curves 
from it to a projection opposite, representing a human figure sitting 
cross legged. The handle is enlarged near where it Joins the figure 
and forms an air chamber, which has a small opening, with the upper 
edge made thin and sharp. Opposite to this opening is a narrow slit

no note can be produced.

by the Peruvians before tlie Spanish conquest is sliown by the histo- 
rian Garcilasso de la Vega.' Of their music lie says: 

In nuisic they arrived to a certain harmony, in wliich the Indians of Colla did 
in()re particularly excel, having been the inventors of a certain pipe made of canes 
srlncd together, every on(^ of which having a different note of higher and lower, in 
the manner of organs, made a ]»leasing music by the dissonancy of sounds, the treljle, 
teuor, and bass, exactly corresponding and 
answering to each other ; with these pipes 
they often played in ccmcert, and made 
tolerable music, though they wanted the 
([uavers, semiquavers, airs, and many 
voices which perfect the liarmony among 
ns. They had, also, other pipes which 
were flutes, with four or live stops, like 
the pipes of shepherds. 

Kivero and Von Tscluidi^ mention 
similar instruments made of reeds 
of cane or stone and adorned some- 
times with needlework. 

Fig. 325 represents an instrument 
made of stone. It is reproduced 
from Engel's drawing, ' and his de- 
scription here follows: 

Another huyara-puhura, likewise still 
yielding sounds, was discovered placed over a corpse in a Peruvian tomb, and was 
procured by the French general, Paroissien. This instrument is made of a greenish 
stone, which is a species of talc, and contains eight pipes. In the Berlin Museum 
may be seen a good plaster cast taken from this curious relic. The height is 5f inches, 
and its width 6^ inches. Four of the tubes have small lateral linger-holes, which, 
when closed, lower the pitch a semitone. These holes are on the second, fourth, sixth, 
and seventh pipes, as shown in the engraving. When the holes are open, the tones are :

The other tubes have unalterable tones. The following notation exhibits all the 
tones producible on the instrument: 




The musician is likely to speculate what could have induced the Peruvians to adopt 
so strange a series of intervals; it seems rather arbitrary than meditated.

CONCLUSION. 

Certain differences of oi^inion exist among historians ot music as to 
the scale adopted by primitive peoples in their earliest efforts. One 
class thinks it finds in the laws of sound a relationship between notes 
of different pitch, which harmonize with each other and make a concord 
of sweet sounds, and demonstrates a scale natural to all men and there- 
fore universal, applying as well to the savage as to the enlightened; 
that is to say, tliey believe that when the savage has become suffi- 
ciently practiced in music to employ a scale of any kind, he will use 
that belonging to modern and civilized music because that scale is 
natural to man. Other i)ersoiis deny this, and express their belief 
that primitive peoples either did not recognize this concord, or else did 
not desire it. 

These differences of opinion have not been adjusted. When one 
party shows primitive instruments on which the modern scale can be 
produced, or shows primitive music written on the modern staff, they 
are met with the assertion that this is, or may be, the result of straining 
the instrument to produce the given note. 

Neither myself nor my associate, Mr. Upham, have taken sides in this 
controversy, recognizing our role to be that of gathering facts rather 
than indulging in speculation, that our facts may be used by both par- 
ties, thus serving in some degree to elucidate these disputed questions. 

Great care has been employed in ascertaining the tones or pitch 
indicated in the staves, that they should represent the normal scale of 
each instrument. They could be manipulated so as to give a tone 
higher or lower than normal. Particular pains have been taken to 
represent ui>ou the staff the notes obtained, by using average force in 
blowing, and to avoid the temptation to raise or lower the pitch, in 
order that the intervals might be more easily represented on the staff 
or more satisfying to the ear. 

The fact that it is rare to find two instruments from a given locality 
which produce the same tones indicates at least that their construc- 
tion (musically) was not based on any established or recognized scale. 
With most of them the intervals and scale appear to have been purely 
accidental. What results might be obtained if all prehistoric instru- 
ments could be brought together and studied it is impossible to say.

NOTE. 

The following work has grown from a simple catalogue into its pres- 
ent proportions in an endeavor to illustrate the distribntion of certain 
games, and by comparison elucidate their original significance. In the 
American part an attempt has been made to describe as far as pos- 
sible the implements for games of the types mentioned, in American 
museums. Additions and corrections, to be incorporated in a subse- 
quent publication, will be gratefully acknowledged by the author.

CHESS AND PLAYING-CARDS. 



By Stewart Culin, 
Director of the ^[us(^llm of Archwology and Paleontologi/, Unirerstty of Pennsylvania. 



INTRODUCTION. 

The object of this collection' is to illustrate the probable origin, 
significance, and development of the games of chess and playing-cards. 
Following up the suggestion made to the writer by Mr. Frank H. 
Cushing, they are both regarded as derived from the divinatory use of 
the arrow, and as representing the two principal methods of arrow- 
divination. Incidental to the main subject, various games and divina- 
tory processes having a like origin, although not leading directly to 
chess or cards, are exhibited, as well as specimens of each class from 
various countries. 

The basis of the divinatory systems from which games have arisen 
is assumed to be the classification of all things according to the Four 
Directions.^ This method of classification is practically universal 

'This collection, for which a diploma of honor and gold medal were awarded at 
the Atlanta Exposition, was subsequently placed on exhibition in the V. S. National 
Mnsenni, where it has since been augmented by many of the additiimal games 
described in this catalogue. — Editor. 

Some idea of the extent to which the classification of things according to the 
world quarters was carried in Eastern Asia may be obtained from tlie numerical 
categories in the second part of Mayer's Chinese Reader's Manual, from which the 
following examples are taken:

among primitive peoples both in Asia and America. In order to classify 
ol)iects and events which did not in themselves reveal their proper 
assignment resort was had to magic. Survivals of these magical 
processes constitute our present games. The identity of the games of 
Asia and America may be explained upon the ground of their common 
object and the identity of the mythic concepts which underlie them.

These concepts, as illustrated in games, appear to be well nigh uni- 
versal. In the classification of things according to the Four Quarters 
we find that a numerical ratio was assumed to exist between the several 
categories. The discovery of this ratio was regarded as an all-impor 
tant clue. The cubical dotted die represents one of the implements of 
magic employed for this puri)ose. The cubical die belongs, howevei,

to a comparatively late period in the history of games aiul divination. 
The almost universal object for determining number, and thence by 
counting, place or direction, is three or more wooden staves, usually 
flat on one side and rounded upon the other. Xumerical counts are 
attributed to their several falls. A typical game in which these staves 
are employed is found in No. 1 — the Korean game of Nyout.

{h) Reproduction of native picture; Korean boys playing Nyout.^ 
The national game of Korea. Two, three, or four persons play, mov- 
ing- objects used as men around a circuit, according- to throws made 
with four blocks of wood used as dice. The circuit (fig. 1) is marked 
with twenty-nine points, twenty of which are arranged equally distant 
in a circle, within which is a cross composed of nine stations. The 
blocks ordinarily used are called pam-nyout or " chestnut nyouV (Plate 1, 
fig. 1 ), white and fiat on one side and black and convex on the other. 
The pieces or men, called mal (Chinese, wm), "horses,"^ may consist of 
any convenient stick or stone. The throws count as follows: 

4 white sides up, nyoul, ^4 
4 black sides up, mo, = 5 
3 wliito sides up, kel, = 3 
2 white sides up, kdi, =2 
1 white side up, /o =1 

A throw of nyout or mo entitles the player to another throw, which he 
makes before moving his piece. The one who shall play first is deter- 
mined by throwing the blocks, the highest leading. The players enter 
their men on the mark next on the left of the large circle at the top of 
the diagram, and move around against the sun. The ol)ject of the game 
is to get from one to four horses around the circuit and out again at tlie 
top. If a player throws so that one of his men falls upon another of 
his own he may double up the two pieces and thereafter take them 
around as one piece, they counting as two in the game. If a player's 
piece fiills upon an opponent's the latter is said to be " caught," and is 
sent back to the beginning, and must be started again as at first. The 
captor is given another throw. Partners are permitted to move each 
other's pieces. In opening the game, if a player's man falls upon the 
large circle B, on the left, he returns to the goal by the radii B E, E A. 
If he overthrows the mark B he must continue on to C. At this point 
he returns by the diameter C A, but if he overthrows he must con- 
tinue on to D and around the circuit to A, the going-out i)lace. 



ters, reading as four lines of a verse, inscribed in the circles. Children frequently 
play ujion a circuit drawn upon the ground. In the picture of the game (Plate 2) 
the boys are represented as throwing the blocks through a cuff, which one of them 
has removed for the purpose. This is done to render the result of the throws more 
a matter of chance than of skill, and is a substitute for a ring of straw, about 
2 inches in diameter, affixed to the end of a stick about a foot long, which is stuck 
in the center of the ring for the same purpose. The selection of the wood for the 
sticks is not a matter of individn;il caprice. They are usually made of the wood of 
a thick bushy tree, like the pruuus, called ssa-7-i, used in China for bows, whence 
the game is called .la-ri-nyout. Another yvood, jiak-fal-na-viou, defined as a very hard 
wood of which mallets are made, is sometimes used, but the former is preferred.

2The term mci, or horses, applied to men or pieces in a game, is of high antiquity 
in China, and was also given to the counters employed in the classical Chinese 
game of Tan u or "pitch pot" (pitching arrows or arrow-lots into a pot), described 
in the Li Ki.

Children and gamblers in the cities commonly use short blocks. In 
the country, long blocks or staves, called tjyang-tjali-mjout (Plate 1, 
fig. 2), are employed. These are usually about 8 inches in leugth. 
In throwing them, one is often 
placed across the others, which 
are held lengthwise in the hand 
by the thumb, with the ends 
resting on the fingers (Plate 1, 
fig. 3). The game is played 
in the country by all classes, 
but only from the fifteenth of 
the twelfth to the fifteenth of 
the first month. 

The names applied to the 
throws are not Korean or Chi- 
nese, but are numerals which 
correspond closely with the cor- 
responding numerals of certain 
Ural-Altaic stocks.' 

References to games played 
with staves, of the same gen- 
eral character as Nyoiit, occur 
in Chinese literature, where 
they are attributed to a foreign 
origin. 

It is customary in Korea to 
use the long blocks at the fif- 
teenth of first month for the 
purpose of divination. Early 
in this month a small book is 
sold in the markets of Seoul to 
be used in connection with 
them. The players throw the 
staves three times, noting the 
number that is counted for the. 
throw at each fall. The series 

three numbers is then referred to the book upon the several pages of 
which are printed in Chinese characters all the various permutations of

Rule'' is given in fig. 3. The numbers represented by the throws are 
from "one" to "four" in sixty-four permutations, from which it will be 
seen that onh'^ three staves are used, layout or "four" is the highest 
throw, and an explanation is thus given of the name of the game.

THE SIXTY-FOUK HEXAGRAMS. 

China. 

After Legge. 



The Chinese Book of Divination consists of sixty-four diagrams, 

kwd, composed of combinations of unbroken with broken lines 

, six being taken at a time, and the resulting diagrams being 

known as the sixty-four lewd (fig. 4). Each of these diagrams is desig- 
nated by a name and accompanied by a short explanatory text. Now 
the sixty-four hexagrams are regarded as an expansion of the eight 
trigrams (fig.o), called the 2)dt kwd or eight A;t(7a, formed by combining 
the same unbroken and broken lines, three at a time. The unbroken 
lines in the diagram are called yeuw/, " masculine," and the broken 
lines yam, " feminine." It is apparent that if the two sides of the Ko- 




CHESS AND PLAYING-CARDS. 685 

reaii blocks be regarded as representing- tlie unbroken or masculine 
lines and the broken or feminine lines the trigrams will form a record 
of the throws when three blocks are used, and the hexagrams when 
six blocks are taken. From this I regard the divinatory use of the 
nyout blocks in connection with the handbook as illustrating the origin 
of the Chinese Boole of Divinatio7i, to which the handbook presents an 
almost perfect parallel.' As it appears from the foreign names of the 
stave-throws in Korea that the system is foreign and non-Chinese, con- 
firmation is afforded of the theory of the foreign origin of the Book of 
Divination advanced by Professor 
Terrien de Lacouperie. A detailed ac- 
count of nyout is given by the writer in 
his work on Korean Games. 

The game of nyout may be regarded 
as the prototype of a large class of com- 
mon games, such as the Game of 
Goose, Backgammon, Pachisi, and 
Chess. It is clearly divinatory in its 
associations, the diagram representing 
the world with its four quarters. The

termined, is discovered by tossing the Fig. 5. 

blocks or staves. ^^^ ^'^^ kwa or ei«ht diagrams, 

' ■ ACCORDING TO FUH-HI. 

The assumption that the nyout staves 

were derived from arrows, suggested by From Mayer's CWnese Reader'a Han,lbo.,k. 

Mr. Gushing, is based upon evidence 

furnished by corresponding American games; for example, in the 
Kiowa game of Zohn ahl, ISTo. 3, where three of the staves bear marks 
like arrow feathering. In throwing the long nyout staves it is custom- 
ary to hold three crosswise over the other (Plate 1, fig. 3), in somewhat 
the same manner as in the Zuni game of Sho-U-toe. (Compare fig. 112.)

'I am informed that in the system of fortune-telling known in Japan as yeki 
(No. 65), in which splints are ordinarily used, three small hlocks are sometimes 
tossed to determine the diagrams. In this method, known as Aral shin yeki, from 
Aral, the name of the reputed inventor, three r(>ctangular blocks, called sangi, about 
3 inches in length, made of some hard wood — cherry, or, preferably, ebony — are em- 
])loyed. Two of the ojtposite long sides are plain. The two other opposite faces are 
marked with vermilion ink in Chinese characters: On one, T'in, "Heaven;" one, Ti, 
"Earth," and tll(^ other Yan, "Man." The determinations are made according to 
the positions in which the marked sides fall one to another, which are referred to a 
special treatise. Another similar method employed in Japan, also attributed to 
Aral, is by means of three ancient "cash" or coins, which are tossed from a tortoise 
shell. My informant, Mr. K. Wadamori, of Tokio, himself a iieki gakusha or "yeki 
scholar," tells me that dots are frequently employed in Japan in noting the diagrams, 
as in the Malagassy sikiddy.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 



Six arrows made of single pieces of maple wood, 29^ inches in length 
(Plate 3). The heads are carved and ])aiiited. According to tlie col- 
lector, Mr. James Mooney, they are thrown with the hand like a javelin, 
and the player who throws farthest wins. It is a man's game. 

It is probable that these arrows were actually used in a game ex- 
tremely common among the Plains Indians. It consists in the players 
tossing arrows in turn at a mark. The object of each player after the 
first is to throw his arrow so that it will lie across the arrow or arrows

that have been tossed before.' Mr. Gushing informs me that the counts 
usually depend upon whether the tossed arrow falls upon the other at 
its head, middle, or foreshaft. 



' Mr. E. W. Davis has given me an account of this game, as seen by liim played by 
the Apache of Geronimo's baud in 1889, in St. Augustiue, Florida. He states that 
the mark was about 10 feet away. ''The arrows were tossed point l:rst. The lirst 
man to throw was re<]uired to laud on the mark. If he did so he got his arrow back. 
Once an arrow in the tield, the object of the next player was to toss his arrow so 
that it should cross the first thrown, and so on through the crowd. I have seen as 
many as six play, and often all would toss around without anyone winning. In this 
case the arrows on the ground remained in the pot, so to speak. The play then went 
on, eacb player winning as many arrows as he could succeed in crossing with his 
own, until the whole number was removed."

The incised designs, painted red, yellow, green, and blue, are in part 
easily recognizable as the calumet with primer, bow and arrow, the 
lightning, and the symbols of the Four Directions on the uppermost 
arrow (Plate 3), which are ])ainted from left to right with the colors 
red, green, blue, and yellow. Mr. Gushing identified others as the war 
staff", or standard, and 
shield; day or dawn 
signs with turkey tracks ; 
day signs with stars; 
horse tracks, and the 
"man" sign. Mr. 



Moouey, in reply to my 
inquiry, informed me 
that the Kiowa attacli 
no special significance to 
these carved arrows, and 
were unable to explain 
the designs. 

These arrows, carved 
and painted with cosmical emblems, are here introduced to illustrate 
the use of a veritable arrow, specialized for the purpose of a game, 
among the American Indians.

Indian Territory, United States. 

{a) A cloth, called the " awl cloth." 

(b) Two awls. 

(c) Flat bowlder, called the " awl stone." 

{d) Four prepared staves, called ahl or " wood." 

((?) Eight other sticks, to be used as counters.' 

The " awl cloth " (fig. 6) is divided into points by which the game is 
counted. The curved lines upon it are called " knees," because they 
are like the knees of the players. 

The space between the parallel lines 1 and 1 and 20 and 20 is called 
"the creek," and the corresponding s])aces between the parallel lines 
at right angles are called the " dry branches." 

Three of the ^^ ahl sticks" (fig. 7) have a red strijje running down 
the middle and one has a blue stripe. They are held by the player in 
one hand and struck downward, so that their ends come on the " ahl 
stone " with considerable force. If all the sticks fall with the sides 
without grooves up[)ermost, the play is called " white," and counts ten. 
If all the grooved sides come uppermost, it is called '' red," and counts 
five. Both of these throws entitle the player to another throw. If one 
grooved side is uppermost, it counts one; two grooved sides, two, and 
three grooved sides, three. The game is played by any even number

of girls or women (never by men or boys), half on one side the line N S 
and half on the other. The flat <^//// stone is placed in the middle of 
the cloth, and the players kneel on the edge. The two awls are stuck 
in the creek at 1 1. The player at A makes the first throw, and the 
throwing goes around the circle in the direction of the hands of a 
watch, each side counting the results of each throw on the "awl cloth" 
by sticking its awl just beyond the mark called for by the results of 
the throw. The moves are made in opposite directions, as indicated by 
the arrows. 

If in counting any awl gets into the "creek" at N, that side must 
forfeit a counter to the other side and be set back to the "creek" at S. 
That side is then said to have fallen into the "creek," the object being 
to "jump over." If in their passage around the circle the two "awls" 
get in the same division, the last comer is said to whip or kill the 
former, who forfeits a counter, and is set back to the beginning. The 
counting continues until one gets back to the "creek" at S. The one 
first at S receives a counter, and if there is more than enough to take 
it to the "creek," the surplus is added to the next round; that is, the 
"creek" is jumped, and the "awl" put beyond it as many points as 
may be over. When one side wins all the counters, it conquers. If the 
game should be broken up before this event, the side which has the 
greater number of counters is the victor.' 

See account of game by Mr. James Mooney on page 731. 

This game wtis selected for exhibition from many similar games played 
by different tribes in America as readily illustrating the i^robable 
derivation of the four staves. Three of them will be seen to appear to 
be marked on one face with the feathered shaftment of an arrow, while 
the fourth probably represents the atlatl or " throwing stick." 

In the following pages a description is given of implements for Amer- 
ican games of the preceding type contained in various museums of the 
United States, together with accounts of the methods of play, arranged 
alphabetically under linguistic families and tribes. For the purpose of 
comparison all games in which objects are tossed to determine number 
are included. Their relations one to another, whatever they may be, will 
doubtless become apparent through this and subsequent collections. 



' Lieutenant Scott further states that the Kiowa have a custom of wetting the 
fingers and slapping them several times on the stone before a throw, and calling out 
"red, red," or ''white, white," according to the number they desire to count; or, if 
but "one" should be required to throw the opposite party into the "creek," some- 
one puts her linger into her mouth, and, drawing it carefully across the top of the 
stone, calls out parko, parko ("one, one"). Often before the throw the thrower 
will rub the four sticks in a vertical position backward and forward several times 
between the palms of the hands, to insure good luck. 

"The Comanche have a similar game which they play with eight ahl sticks, and the 
Cheyenne and Arapaho are said to have a game which they play with ahl sticks, 
which are 2 feet or more long." (H. L. S.)

NAT MUS 90 11: 



690 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

The following account of the game is given by the collector :i 

The dice game is called ia-ii seta Una (literally, "striking" or " throwing against" 
something) bj' the Arapaho, and Moushimiinh Ity the Cheyenne, the same name being 
now given to the modern card games. It was practically nuiversal among all the tribes 
east and west, and, under the name of hubbub, is described by a New England writer* 
as far back as 1634 almost precisely as it exists to-day among the prairie tribes. 
The only difference seems to have been that in the east it was played also by the 
men, and to the accompaniment of a song, such as is used in the hand games of the 
Western tribes. The requisites are a small wicker bowl or basket {hat e chi na), five 
dice made of bone or plum stones, and a pile of tally sticks, such as are used in the 
awl o-ame. The bowl is 6 or 8 inches in diameter and about 2 inches deep, and is woven 
in basket fashion of the tough fibers of the yucca. The dice may be round, elliptical, 
or diamond-shaped, and are variously marked on one side with lines or figures, the 
turtle being a favorite design among the Arapaho. Two of the five must be alike in 
shape and marking. The other three are marked with another design and may also 
be of another shape. Any number of women and girls may play, each throwing in 
turn, and sometimes one set of partners playing against another. The partners toss 
up the dice from the basket, letting them drop again into it, and score points accord- 
ing to the way the dice turn up in the basket. The first throw by each player is 
made from the hand instead of from the basket. One hundred jioints usually count 
a game, and stakes are wagered on the result as in almost every other Indian contest 
of skill or chance. For the purpose of explanation we shall designate two of the 
five as "rounds" and the other three as "diamonds," it being understood that only 
the marked side counts in the game, excepting when the throw happens to turn up 
the three "diamonds" blank while the other two show the marked side, or, as some- 
times happens, when all five dice turn up blank. In every case all of one kind at 
least unist turn up to score a point. A successful throw entitles the player to 
another throw, while a failure obliges her to pass the basket to someone else. The 
formula is : 

1 only of either kind . =0 

2 rounds = 3 

3 diamonds (both rounds with blank side up) =3 

3 diamonds blank (both rounds with marked side up) = 3 

4 marked side up = 1 

5 (all) blank sides up =1 
5 (all) marked sides up = 8 

A game similar in principle, but played with six dice instead of five, is also played 
by the Arapaho women, as well as by those of the Comanche and probably also of 
other tribes.

combination of the sides which lie uppermost after they have fallen, determines the 
count of the throw. 

The players sit opposite one another, and, if several are playing, in two rows facing 
each other. Each individual bets with the woman opposite to her. Each player is 
provided with eight sticks, which represent the points which she must gain or lose 
to win or lose the game. When a player has won all the sticks belonging to her 
opponent she has won the game and the stake. 

There are several combinations of marks and blanks which count nothing for or 
against the player making the throw, except that she loses ber chance to make 
another throw. Others entitle the thrower to receive one, three, or even all 
eight sticks, and each throw that counts anything entitles the i)layer to another 
throw. All the players on the side of the thrower, i. e., in the same row, win or 
lose from those opposite to them as the thrower wins or loses. If tlie person making 
the hrst throw casts a blank, she passes the basket to the one sitting next her; if 
tuis one makes a throw that counts, she has another and another, until she throws a

blank, when the basket passes on. When the basket reaches the end of the line, it 
is handed across to the woman at the end of the opposite row, and in the same way 
travels down the opposite line. 

In making the throw the basket is raised only a little way, and the stones tossed 
only a few inches high. Before they fall tlie basket is brought smartly down to the 
ground, against which it strikes with some little noise. Some of the throws are 
given below, the sides of the seeds being designated by their marks : 

2 blanks, 2 bears, and 1 cross count nothing. 

4 blanks and 1 bear count nothing. 

5 blanks count 1 point; thrower takes 1 stick. 

3 blanks and 2 bears count 1 point; thrower takes 1 stick. 

1 blank, 2 bears, and 2 crosses count 1 point; thrower takes 1 stick. 

2 blanks and 3 crosses count 3 points; thrower takes 3 sticks. 

2 bears and 3 crosses count 8 points; thrower takes 8 sticks, and wins the game. 

The women do not sing at this game, but they chatter and joke continually as the 
play goes on.

The game is won by the red pieces, the arithmetical value of each of which is 
fixed, iiud the count, as in all games of chance, is advanced or retarded by the luck 
of the throw. Nothing is required but a wooden bowl, which is curiously curved 
and ornamented (the owner relying somewhat on nuigic iutlueuce), and having a 
plain, smooth surface. 

The autlior gives the counts for sixteen different throws from one 
hundred and fifty-eight down to two. 

Long' gives the following description of the bowl game among the 
Chippewa: 

Jlhtertjaiii, or miss none but catch all, is also a favorite amusement with them, in 
whicli the women frequently take part. It is played with a number of hard beans, 
black and white, one of which has small spots and is called liiug; they are put into 
a shallow wooden bowl and shaken alternately by each party, who sit on the ground 
opposite to one another; whoever is dexterous enough to make the spotted bean 
jump out of the bowl receives of the adverse party as many beans as there are spots; 
the rest of the beans do not count for anytliing. 

The following account, given by J. G. Kohl,'^ who does not designate 
the particular tribe, probably refers to the Chippewa: 

The game called by the Indians pagessan, and which I frequently saw played, the 
Canadians call le jeii au pJat (the game of the bowl). It is a game of hazard, but 
skill plays a considerable part in it. It is played with a wooden bowl and a number 
of small figures bearing some resemblance to our chessmen. They are usually carved 
very neatly out of bones, wood, or plum stones, and represent various things — a fish, 
a hand, a door, a man, a canoe, a half- moon, etc. They call these ^gurea paf/essanag 
(carved plum stones), and the game has received its name from them. Each figure 
has a foot on which it can stand upright. ' They are all thrown into a wooden bowl 
(in Indian onagan), whence the French name is derived. The players make a hole 
in the ground and tlirust the bowl with the figures into it, whih^ giving it a slight 
shake. The more figures stand upright on the smooth bott(un of the bowl through 
this shake all the better for the player. Each figure has its value, and some of 
them represent to a certain extent the pieces in the game of chess. There are also 
other figures, which may similarly be called the pawns. The latter, carved into 
small round stars, are all alike, have no pedestal, but are red on one side and plain 
on the other, and are counted as plus or minus according to the side uppermost. 
With the pawns it is a perfect chance which side is up, but witli the pieces much 
depends on the skill with which the bowl is shaken. The other rules and mode of 
calculation are said to be very complicated, and the game is played with great 
attention and passion.

William Wood, iu liis "New England Prospect,"' relates the following: 

They have two sorts of games, one called j^Htm, the other linbbiib, not much unlike 
cards and dice. Huhhnb is five small bones iu a small smooth tray, the bones be 
like a die but something flatter, black on the one side and vrhite ou the other, which 
they place on the ground, gainst which violently thumping the platter, the bones 
mount changing colors with the windy whisking of their hands to and fro, which 
action in that sjiort they much use, smiting themselves on the breast and thighs, 
crying out Hub Hub Hub. They may be heard playing this game a quarter of a 
mile off. Tlie bones being all black or white make a double game: if three of one 
color and two of auotlier, then they aft'ord but a single game; four of a color and 

one differing is nothing. So long as the 
man wins he keeps the tray, but if he lose 
the next man takes it. 

Menominee. Wisconsin.

the Menominee form of the game 
under the name of a Icqa' siwolc. 

It was frequently played iu former times,

Menoininee Indians. ispheric bowl (fig. 17), made out of the 

After iioffinaii. largc rouud nodules of a maple root, is 

cut and hollowed out. The bowl is symmetric and is very nicely finished. It meas- 
ures 13 inches iu diameter at the rim, and is 6 inches in depth. It measures f inch 
in thickness at the rim, but gradually increases in thickness toward the bottom, 
which is about an inch thick. There are forty counters, called ma'atik, made of 
twigs or trimmed sticks of pine or other wood, each about 12 inches long and from 
i to ^ inch thick. Half of these are colored red, the other half black, or perhaps 
left their natural whitish color. 

The dice or asl~a' sianoh consists of eight pieces of deer horn, about f inch in diam- 
eter and \ inch thick, but thinner toward the edges. Sometimes plum-stones or 
even pieces of wood are taken, one side of them being colored red, the other side 
remaining white or uucolored. When the players sit downi to play the bowl containing 
the dice is placed on the ground between the opponents; bets are made; the first 
player begins a song in which the other players as well as the spectators join. At a 
certain moment the one to ]>lay first strikes the bowl a smart tap, which causes the 
dice to fly upward from the bottom of the bowl, and as they fall find settle the result is 
watched with very keen interest. The value represented by the position of the dice 
represents the number of counters which the player is permitted to take from the 
ground. The A'alue of the throw is as follows : 

First throw, 4 red dice and 4 white, a draw. 
Second throw, 5 red dice and 3 white, counts 1. 
Third throw^, 6 red dice and 2 white, counts 4. 
Fourth throw, 7 red dice and 1 white, counts 20. 
Fifth throw, 8 red dice and white, counts 40. 
The players strike the bowl alternately until one person wins all the counters — 
both those ou the ground and those which the opponent may \\ii\e won.

game of unknown antiquity, undoubtedly of pre-Columbian origin. It is played upon 
a circular wooden dish — properly rock maple — almost exactly a foot in diameter,

hollowed to a depth of ahout f inch in the center. This dish plays an important sole 
in the older legends of tlie Micmacs. Filled with water and left over night, its 
appearance next morning serves to reveal hidden knowledge of post, present, and 
future. It is also said to have heen used as a vessel upon an arkite trip. The dice 
of caribou hone are six in number, having flat faces and rounded sides. One face is 
phiin; the other hears a dotted cross (tig. 18). When all the marked or all the 
unmarked faces are turned up there is a count of tive points; if five marked faces 
and one unmarked face or five unmarked faces and one marked face are turned up, 
one point results; if a die falls ott" the dish there is no count. There are fifty-five 
counting sticks — fifty-one plain rounded ones about 7i inches long, a king-pin ' 
shaped like the forward half of an arrow, and three notched sticks, each present- 
ing half of the rear end of an arrow. Tlieso last four are about 8 inches long. 
Three of the plain sticks form a count of one jioint, the jiotcbed sticks have a value 
of five points, while the king-pin varies in value, being used as fifty-second plain 
stick, except when it stands alone in the general ])ih'; then it has, like the notched 
sticks, a value of five points. Thus the possible points of the count are seventeen 
(one-third of fifty-one) on the plain sticks and fifteen (five times three) on the three 
notched sticks, a total of thirty-two ; but by a complex system the count may be 
extended indefinitelj\ In playing the game two players sit opposite each other, 
their legs crossed in a characteristic manner, and the dish, or woltes, between them 
usually placed on a thick piece of leather or cloth. A squaw keeps the score on the

counting-sticks, which at first lie together. The six dice are placed on a dish with 
their marked faces down ; one of the players takes the dish in both hands, raises it 
an inch or two from the ground, and brings it down again with considerable force, 
thus turning the dice. If all but one of the upturned faces are marked or unmarked, 

'Mr. Hager informs me that the king-pin is called keser/oo — ''the old man " — and 
that the notched sticks are his three wives and the plain sticks his children. The 
Micmac explains these names by saying that when a stranger calls the children 
come out of the wigwam first, then the women, and then the head of the family ; and 
this is the way it happens when one plays at wdltestdmlcuiun. ''The technical name 
for the king-pin is nandaymelf/awasch and for the wives ilcumooivaaJ, both of which 
names mean, they say, 'it counts five' and 'they count five.' Nan is the Micmac for 
'five,' but no numeral of which I know appears in the second name." Mr. Hager 
regards the polygamous element in the game as a good indication of its antiquity, 
if, he adds, "such indeed be necessary." Referring to the passes described by Mrs. 
W. W. Brown, in her paper on the games of the Wabanaki Indians (see p. 708), he 
says: "These ]iasses are made by'the Micmac in woltes tdmlwtm by passing the right 
hand rapidly to the left over the dish, and shutting it exactly as if catching a fly." 
Wedding ceremonies among the Micmac were celebrated by the guests for four days 
thereafter. On the first day they danced the serpent dance, on the second they 
played football (tooadyik), on the third they played lacrosse (madijik), and on the 
fourth woltestumkivun.

he repeats the toss and contiinies to do so as long as one of these combinations 
results. "When lie fails to score, the amount of his winnings is withdrawn from the

dice-throwing until he also fails to score. Two successive throws of cither a single 
point or of five points count thrice the amount of one throw; that is, three jioints 
or fifteen points, respectively. Three successive throws count live times as much as

a single throw, etc. After the pile of counting-sticks has been exhausted, a new 
feature is introduced in the count. The player who scores first takes a single j)lain 
stick from hia pile and places it by itself, with one of its sides facing him to repre- 



700 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

sent oue point, and perpendicular to this, either horizontally or A^ertically, to rep- 
resent five points.' 

He continnes to add sticks thus as he continues to score. This use of the sticks as 
counters to indicate unpaid winnings is a device for deferring further settlement 
until the game seems near its end, and also serves to increase the count indefinitely 
to meet the indefinite duration of the game, as after one player secures a token his 
opponent, -when he scores, merely reduces the former's pile by the value of his 
score. The reduction is effected by returning from the token pile to the private pile 
the amount of the opponent's score; hence at auy time the token pile represents the 
amount of advantage which its owner has obtained since the last settlement. 
These settlements are made whenever either party may desire it; this, however, is 
supposed to be whenever a player's token pile seems to represent a value approaching 
the limit of his opponent's ability to pay. If his opponent shoiild permit the settle- 
ment to be deferred until he were no longer able to pay his debts, then he would 
lose the game to the first player; whereas, if one player after the settlement retains 
five plain sticks but not more, a new feature is introduced which favors him. If, 
while retaining his five sticks, he can score five points before his opponent scores at 
all, he wins the game in spite of the much greater amount of his opponent's win- 
nings up to that point. If his opponent scores one point only before he obtains his 
five points, he still has a chance, though a less promising one. If, after paying over 
the three plain sticks that represent a single point two plain sticks still remain to 
him, he is then comi)elled to win seven points befoi-e his opponent wins one or he 
forfeits the game; but if he succeeds in winning his seven points, the game is still 
his. However, in these last chances he is further handicapi)ed by the rule that he 
can at no time score more points than are represented in his private pile. Conse- 
quently, if with only five plain sticks in his possession he could only score a single 
point, even if his toss should call for five; but with six i)lain sticks he could score 
two i>oint8; with nine sticks, three, etc. The last chances are: With only five plain 
sticks, five points are necessary to win; with three sticks, six points; with two 
sticks, seven points ; with one stick, seven points. There are two other minor rules : 
One, that in counting five points on plain sticks four bundles of four each are given 
instead of five bundles of three each, as one should expect; total, sixteen. The 
other rule is that to count six points we use a notched stick plus only two plain 
sticks, instead of three, as might be expected. 

This game may be regarded as an American analogue of the Chinese 
game of Chong iin cKau (No. 27). 

Mr. Hager states that the preceding game was invented and taught 
by the hero Glooscap. They also have a similar game called Wohuna- 
runlc, which, they say, was invented and owned by Mikchikch, the turtle, 
one of Glooscap's companions, to whose shell the dice bear some resem- 
blance.^ The name Wohunarunli is derived from ivohun, meaning dawn ; 
to which is added a termination signifying anything molded or worked 
upon by human hands.* 

'This system of scoring is identical with that used in Japan with the counting- 
sticks, or sanf/i (Chinese, siin muk). One is indicated by a stick arranged vertically, 
and five by a stick placed horizontally. A set of sangi in the University Museum (Cat. 
No. 18306) (fig, 22), consists of one hundred and twenty-seven little wooden blocks, 
l-\f, inches in length, and about i inch square in section. Sangi are, or rather were 
emjdoyed in Japan in the higher mathematics, the use of the sorohan or abacus not 
being customary Avith scholars.

The ontflt for the game consists simply of six dice, made from moose 
or caribou bone, though one Micmac at least is positive that the teeth 
only of these animals can properly be used. In playing, these dice are 
thrown from the right hand upon the 
ground and the j)oints are counted accord- 
ing to the number of marked or unmarked 
faces which fall uppermost. It is cus- 
tomary for a player to j)ass his hand 
quickly over the dice, if possible, after 
he has tossed them and before they reach 
the ground, in order to secure good luck. 
The shape of the dice is that of a decid- 
edly flattened hemisphere, the curved 
portion being unmarked. The base or 
flat surface is about the size of a 25-cent 
])iece and presents tliree figures (fig. 23). 
Close to its edge there is a circle, touched 
at four points by a series of looped curves, 
which form a kind of cross. Within each 
of the four spaces thus separated is an 

equal-armed cross composed of nine dots, which, with the dot in the 
center of the die, make a total of thirty-seven dots uiwn each piece, 
or of two hundred and twenty-two dots (37 by C) used in the game.^

writer is iucliued to believe tbat the name of this same If'obiindrunk is derived from 
the use of wampum (ivobun, "white," so called from the white beads), as stakes 
for which it was played. Again, it may refer to the white disks ; but, however this 
may be, a peculiar significance is attached to the use of shell beads as gambling- 
counters or stakes. In the Chinese game of Fan t'du the stakes are represented by 
specially made white and black counters, known as white and black "pearls."' 

"In view of the numerical suggestiveness of dots and of the presence of that 
peculiar repetition of numbers which characterizes all triple multiples of the key 
number thirty-seven, it may be worthy of note that the number of dots included in 
the seven counts of the game is seven hundred and seventy-seven. The Micmac lan- 
guage contains native words for numbers as great as a million, and, as Dr. Rand 
says, is capable of indefinite numerical extension, a fact which surely appears to 
involve some knowledge of the properties of numbers. That certain numbers have 
been used as symbols in ritual and myth is quite as unquestionable among the 
Micmacs as among so many tribes and peoples, primitive and otherwise. The impor- 
tance of such dice games in developing and extending the knowledge of numbers is 
self-evident. As to the figures upon the dice, the nse of the cross from prehistoric 
times as a native symbol throughout the length and breadth of the Americas is too 
well known to justify further comment. The Micmacs painted it upon their canoes 
and wigwams and attributed to it marvelous efficacy as a healing power. To play 
either WdJU'Stomkwun or W6hnnaruHkvi\t\\ dice from which the cross is omitted would 
be certain, they believed, to bring dire misfortune npou all participants. Several 
Micmacs have related to me, almost word for word, the same legend of the origin of 
the cross among them that was reported by Pere Leclereq at Gaspe more than two 
centuries ago; and it is noticeable that this legend contains no Christian element. 
They also associated this symbol witli the four quarters into which they divided the 
land for the purpose of collecting medicinal roots and herbs, while a circle repre- 
sents to them either that of their wigwam or of tlie horizon. The fiat surface of tlie 
die, therefore, with its four crosses and surrounding circle, may symbolize the world-

The count is as follows : 

If 6 marked faces fall face up, 50 points. 
If 5 luarked faces fall face up, 5 points. 
If 4 marked faces fall face up, 4 points. 
If 3 marked faces fall face np, 3 points. 
If 2 marked faces fall face up, 2 points. 
If 1 marked face falls face up, 1 point. 
If 6 unmarked faces fall face np, 5 points. 
Total, 7 counts and 70 jioints. 

The marks on the Micmac dice are similar to those on some of the 
inscribed shell beads known as runtecH^ fonnd in the State of New 
York. One of these (fig. 24), (reproduced from Prof. W. H. Holmes's 
Art in Shell of the Ancient Americans),' is from an ancient village 
site at Pomi)ey, which Eev. W. M. Beauchamp, of Baldwiiisville, Xew 
York, attributes to the seventeenth century. Mr. Beauchamp writes 

me that both sides are alike, and that 
it is pierced with two holes from edge 
to edge.

Set of six disks of caribou bone 
marked on the flat side (fig. 25); a 
platter of curly maple cut across the

much broader than the others and of 
different shapes, as shown in the figure. 
Collected and deposited by Mr. George 
E. Starr, who purchased the game from 
a woman named Susan Perley, a member of a tribe calling themselves 
the Tobique, at an Indian village half a mile north of Andover, New 
Brunswick. Three of the disks and the counting sticks were made for 
the collector, while the platter and three of the disks shown in the upper 
row (fig. 25) are old. Two of the latter are made apparently of old bone 

wide concept of the four earth regions encircled by the horizon line and beneath the 
curve of the sky represented by the curved surface. The looped figure may extend 
the fourfold division to the sky, or it may be merely a combination of the two other 
symbols. At least, that each design had some particular meaning can hardly be 
questioned, for the Micmac still objects to playing the game if one be incorrectly 
drawn. A comparison of the two Micmac dice games shows the same number of dice 
in each and the cross and circle appear on both -sets, although in slightly differing 
size and design. The dice of one game are, however, never used in the other. 
Their counts differ radically, save that the ubiquitous number seven is prominent in 
both, and finally Wubiinurunk lacks altogether the bow- and arrow elements and 
their mystic attributes. Still, the resemblance is sufficiently close to suggest a pos- 
sible unity of origin." (S. H.)

The designs on the faces are not the same. The woman informed Mr. 
Starr that the game was called Altes tugen, and that it was played by 
two i)ersons, one of whom places the counting sticks in a pile together. 
Then the stones are placed at random in the plate, which is held in 
both hands and struck sharply on the ground so as to make the stones 
fiy in the air and turn before landing in the i)late again. A player 
continues as long as he scores, taking counters from the pile of sticks 
according to his throw. When the pile is exhausted, each having ob- 
tained part, the game is continued until o;ie wins them all. Three plain 
sticks count one point. The three carved sticks each count four points,

describes the latter as made of long poles set in the earth, four square, 
10 or 20 feet high, on which they hang great store of their stringed 
money, having great staking, town against town, and two chosen out 
of the rest by course to play the game at this kind of dice in the midst 
of all their abettors, with great shouting and solemnity. He also says: 

The chief gamesters among them much desire to make their gods side with them 
in their games; therefore 1 have seen them keep as a precious stone a piece of thun- 
derbolt, wliicli is lilvo unto a crystal, which they dig out of tlie ground under some 
tree thunder smitten, and Iroui this stone they have an opinion of success. 

NiPissiNG. Forty miles above Montreal, Canada. 

j\Ir. J. A. Cnoq ' describes the plnm stone game among this tribe under 
the name of Pahesanal-, which he says is the usual name given to live 
plum-stones, each marked with several dots on one side only. Four or 
Ave women scptatting around a blanket make the stones jump about 
the height of their forehead, and according to their falling on one or 
the other side the fate of the player is decided. Of late the game has 
been improved by using a platter instead of a cover (blanket), which 
caused the name of the •' game of platter " to be given it by the whites. 

The name pakemnalc is the plural of pakesan^ defined as noyaii, jeu.

After drawing by Mrs.W.W. Brown, 



The heg-ffa-sah-nuk are small pieces of wood, boiie, or 
sometimes of brass, made by cutting up an old kettle. One 
side tbey stain or color black, tbe other they aim to have 
bright. These may vary in number, but can never be fewer 
than nine. They are put together in a large wooden bowl 
or tray kept for the purpose. The two parties, sometimes 
twenty or thirty, sit down opposite to each other or in a 
circle. The play consists in striking the edge of the bowl 
in such a manner as to throw all the heg-ga-sali-nuTi into the air, and on tbe manner 
in which they fall into the tray depends his gain or loss. If his stroke has been to 
a certain extent fortunate, the player strikes again and again, as in the game of 
billiards, until he misses, when it passes to the next. 

The Eev. Peter Jones- says: 

In these bowl plays they use plum-stones. One side is burnt black and the other 
is left its natural color. Seven of these plums are placed in a wooden bowl and are 
then tossed up and caught. If they happen to turn up all white, or all black, they 
count so many. This is altogether a chance game.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 




All tbo sticks are placed in a pile. The disks are put in the dish without order; 
each contestant can play while he wins, but, on his missing', the other takes the dish. 
Turning all the disks but one, the player takes three small sticks; twice in succes- 
sion, nine sticlvs; three time>< in succession, one big stick or twelve small ones. 
Turning all alike once, he takes a big stick; twice in succession three big ones, or 
two, and lays a small one out to show what is done; three times in succession he 
stands a big stick uji — equal to sixteen small ones from the opponent — the notch<^d 
one to be tlie last taken of the small ones, it being eciual to three. 

When all the small sticks ai'c drawn and there are large ones left in the pile, 
instead of taking three from the opponent the players lay one out to show that the 
other owes three sticks, and so on until the large ones are avou. Then, unless the 
game is a draw, the second and more interesting stage begins, and the sticks have 
different value. Tnrning all the disks but one, the player lays ont one, equal to four 
from an opponent. Turning all the disks but one, twice in succession, he lays three 

out, equal to twelve from 
the other — three times in 
succession — stands one up, 
e»inal to one large or sixteen 
small ones. Turning all 
alike, he sets up one large 
one, twice in succession; 
then three large ones or, 
lacking these, three small 
ones for each large one. 
This would end the game 
if the opponent had none 
standing, as there wonld l)e 
no sticks to pay the points. 
But a run of three times of 
one kind in succession is 
unusual. When one has not 
enough sticks to jjay points 
Avon by the other, comes 
the real test of skill, 
although the former has 
still several superior 
chances to win the game. 
If he has five sticks, he has 
three chances ; if seven or 
nine sticks, he has live 
chances — that is, he places the disks in position, all one side up, for each of the 
tosses; the other contestant takes his turn at playing, bnt can not place the disks. 
Then giving the dish a peculiar slide, which they call la Ink, or "running down 
hill like Avater," and at the same time striking it down on the cushion, he may, 
unless the luck is sadly against him, win twice out of three times trying. 

To this day it is played Avith great animation, with incantations for good luck 
and exorcising of evil spirits, by Avaving of hands and crying yon-tel-eg-ica-wiich . 
At a run of ill luck there are peculiar passes made over the dish and a muttering 
of 3Iic-mac-s({us uk w'me lia-ook ("I knoAv there is a Micmac squaw around"). 

One of their legends tells of a game played by Youth against Old Age. The old 
man had much m'ta-ou-Un (magic power). He had regained his youth several times 
by inhaling the breath of youthful opponents. He had again grown old and sought 
another victim. When he found one Avhom he thought suited to his purpose, he 
invited him to a game of AU-tes-teg-enuk. The young man was also a m'ta-oti-lin, 
and for a, pn-lic-gan had K'che-hal-lock (spirit of the air) and, conseciuently, know the 
old man's intention, yet he consented to a game. The old man's wdl-tah-ha-mo'(j'n

a long aud oxcitiug one, but at each toss off by tLe youug man the disks were carried

nished the writer witli tlic Ibllowing account of the game under the 
name of Wcr-lar-dtt-lKir mun <jun. 

The buttons used as dice in this game are made from the shoulder blade of a 
moose; the counters of cedar wood. The latter are tifty-five in number, fifty-one 
being rounded spliuts about 6 inches in length, three Hat splints of the same length, 
and one made iu a zigzag shape. A soft bed is made in the ground, or on the lloor, 
for tho dish to strike on. Two persons having been selected to play the game, they 
seat themselves opposite to each other. The buttons are placed in the dish and it is 
tossed up and brought down hard upon its soft bed. If five of the six l)uttons have 
the same side up, the player takes three round sjiliuts, but if the entire six turn the 
same side up, it is called a double, aud the player takes one of the flat ones. The 
game is continued until all the counters are drawn. 

It might naturally be inferred that remains of the bone disks used in 
the bowl game wonld be found in our archu'ological museums, but as 
yet I have not met with any. On the other hand small disks of pot- 
tery and of stone freiiuently marked on one face are not uncommon, 
and are usually classified as gaming implements. I am indebted to

SiKSiKA (Blackfeet). Canada. 
Eev. Edward F. Wilson ' says: 

Their chief mniisements are horse racing and gambling. For the hitter of these 
they employ dice of their own constinction— little cubes of wood, with signs instead 
of numbers marked upon them. These they shake together in a wooden dish. 

Mr. J. W. Tims' gives l-atsdshini as a general term for gambling. 

Mr. George Bird Grinnell has furnished me with the following unpub- 
lished account of the stave game among the Blackfeet, which he 
describes under the name of nes teh, "The stick or travois^ game." 

This is a woman's gambling game, in vogue among the tribes of the Blackfoot 
nation, who know nothing of the basket or seed game so generally played by the 
more southern plains tribes. 

Four straight bones — made from buffalo ribs — 6 or 8 inches long, i inch thick, and 
about f inch wide, and tapering gradually to a blunt point at either end, are used 
in playing it (Plate 5). Three of these bones are unmarked on one side, and the 
fourth on this side has three or five transverse grooves running about it at its mid- 
dle, or sometimes no grooves are cut and the bone is marked by having a buckskin 
string tied around it. On their other sides the bones arc marked, two of them by 
zigzag lines, running from one end to the other; another, called the chief, has 
thirteen equally distant holes drilled in, but not through it, from one end to the 
other. The fourth, called "four," from its four depressions or holes, has four trans- 
verse grooves close to each end, and within these is divided into four equal spaces 
by three sets of transverse grooves of three each. In the middle of each of these 
spaces a circular depression or hole is cut. All the lines, grooves, and marks are 
painted in red, blue, or black. 

These bones are played with, either by two women who gamble against each 
other or by a number of women who sit opposite and facing each other in two long 
lines, each player contesting with her opposite neighbor. Twelve sticks, or counters, 
are used in the game, and at first these are placed on the ground between the two 
players. 

The player, kneeling or squatting on the ground, grasx^s the four bones in the 
right or left hand, holding them vertically with the ends resting on the ground. 
With a slight sliding motion she scatters the bones on the ground close in front of 
her, and the sides which fall uppermost express the count or the failure to count. 
Sometimes, but not always, 1' e players throw the bones to determine which shall 
have the first throw in the game. 

The person making a successful throw takes from the heap of sticks the number 
called for by the points of the throw — one stick for each point. So long as the 
throw is one which counts the player continues to throw, but if she fails to count 
the bones are passed over to the opposite player, and she then throws until she has 
cast a blank. When the sticks have all been taken from the pile on the ground 
between them the successful thrower begins to take from her opponent so many of 
the sticks which she has gained as are called for by her throw. As twelve points

•'The word trarois (tra])per, French) has been variously explained as coming from 
travail and from traineau. I believe, however, as stated in The Story of the Indian, 
p. l.^e, it is a corruption from travcrts or a travels, meaning across, and referring to 
the crossing of the poles over the horse's or over the dog's withers (G. B. G,).

must bo made by a player before the twelve sticks can come into her possession and 
the game be won, it will be seen that the contest may be long drawn out. A run of 
luck is needed to finish it. 

Some of the counts made by the throws are here given: 

3 blanks and chief =; 6 points = 6 sticks. 

3 blanks and chief reversed = 3 points = 3 sticks. 

2 zig/.ag, 1, 4, and chief = 4 points ^ 4 sticks. 

2 blanks, 1, 4, and chief = 2 points = 2 sticks. 

2 blanks, 1 zigzag, and chief = zero point = zero sticks. 

2 blanks, 1 zigzag, and chief reverses ^ zero point = zero sticks. 

1 zigzag, 1 hlank, 1, 4, and chief = zero point = zero sticks. 

The women do not sing at this game as the men do at the gambling game of " hands."

The game described was obtained by Mr. Griiinell from the Piegans 
of the Bhickfeet Agency iu northwestern Montana, on tlie eastern 
tianks of the Kocky Mountains. They live on Milk lliyer, Cut Bank, 
Willow, Two Medicine Lodge, and Badger creeks; the southernmost 
tribe of the Blackfeet. It will be observed that the implements for this 
game are practically identical with those collected by Dr. Matthews 
from the Gros Ventres in Dakota (fig. 89). Concerning this Mr. Grin- 
nell remarks: 

The Gros Ventres of Dakota— by which are meant, of course, the Gros Ventres of 
the village, a tribe of Crow stock— are not very distant neighbors of the Blackfeet, 
and iu fact the people of the old Fort Berthold village, the Gros Ventres, Kees, and 
Mandans, have many customs, and eveu some traditions, which closely resemble 
those of the Blackfeet.

The principal implements are three sticks, which are thrown violently, enda 
down, on a flat stone around which the gamblers sit. The sticks rebonnd so well 
that they wonld tly far away were not a blanket stretched overhead to throw them 
back to the players. A number of small stones placed in the form of a s([iiare are 
u.'-ed as counters. The.se are not moved, but sticks, whose positions are changed 
according to the fortunes of the game, are placed between them. The rules of the 
game have not been recorded. 

Dr. Matthews ' tells, among the early events of the fifth or present 
world, that while they were waiting for the ground to dry, the women 
erected four poles, on which they stretched a deerskin, and under the

shelter of this they played the game of three sticks, tsinrZf, one of 
the four games which they brought with them from the lower world.'' 
Another game of tossed sticks described by Dr. Matthews^ was called 
<aka-thad-sata,^ or the thirteen chips. 

It is played with 13 thin flat pieces of wood, which are colored red on one side 
and left white or nncolorcd on the other. Success depends on the number of chips 
which, being thrown upward, fall with their white sides up.

It seems liardly necessary to point out that lie failed to comprehend 
the object of the game. 
Pawnee. 

In reply to a letter addressed by the writer to Mr. George Bird Grin- 
nell, of New York City, he kindly wrote the following account "of what 
the Pawnee call the seed game:" 

I have seen this game played among the Pawnee., Ankara, and Cheyenne, and 
snbstantially in the same way everywhere. The Pawnee do not nsc a howl to throw 
the seeds, but hold them in a Hat wicker basket, aliout tiie size and shape of an 
ordinary tea plate. The woman 
who makes the throw holds the 
basket in front of h(!r close 
to the ground; gives tke stones 
a sudden toss into the air, and 
then moves the basket smartly 
down against the ground, and 
the stones fall into it." They 
are not thrown high, but the 
movemeutof thebasketis ([uick, 
and it is brought down hard on 
the ground so that the sound of 
the slai)ping is easily heard. 
The plum stones are always live 
in number, blackened, and vari- 
ously marked on one side. The 
women who are gambling sit In 
line opposite to one another, 
and usually each woman bets 
with the one sitting opposite 
her, and the poiuts ar(> counted 

by sticks placed on the ground between them, the wager always being on the game, 
and not on the different throws. It is exclusively, so far as I know, a woman's game. 

Pike^ says: 

The third game alluded to is that of la platte, described by various travelers (as 
the platter or dish game) ; this is played by the av omen, children, and old men, who, 
like grasshoppers, crawl out to the circus to bask in the sun, probably covered only 
with an old buffalo robe. 

ESKIMAUAN STOCK. 

Speaking of the Central Eskimo, Dr. Franz Boas^ says: 
A game similar to dice, called tingmiujang, i. e., images of birds, is frequently 
played. A set of about fifteen figures, like those represented in fig. 42, belong to 
this game; some representing birds, others men and women. The players sit around 
a board or a piece of leather and the figures are shaken in the hand and thrown 
upward. On falling, some stand upright, others lie fiat on the back or on the side. 
Those standing upright belong to that player whom they face; sometimes they are 
so thrown that they all belong to the one that tossed them up. The players 
throw by turns until the last figure is taken up, the one getting the greatest num- 
ber of figures being the winner.

Mr. John Murdoch ' describes similar objects wliich Le purchased at 
Plover Bay, easteru Siberia, iu 1881 (fig. 43). They were supposed to 
be merely works of art. Referring to the account given by Dr. Boas 
of their use as a game, he says:

It is therefore quite likely they were used for a similar purpose at Plover Bay. 
If this be so, it is a remarkable point of similarity betweeu these widely separated 
Eskimo, for I can learn. nothing of a similar custom at any intermediate jioint. 

Mr. Murdoch refers to the game as mentioned by Captain Hall,^ Avho, 
speaking of the Central Eskimo, says: 

They have a variety of games of their own. In one of these they use a number 
of bits of ivory made iu the form of ducks.

Prof. Benjamin Sharp, of tlie Academy of Natural Science, tells me 
that be saw the carved \Yater birds used as a game, being tossed and 
allowed to fall by Eskimo of St. Lawrence Bay, Siberia. 

In reply to my inquiry in reference to the use of such objects in 
games by tlie Arctic Highlanders of Oreenland, Mr. Henry Gr. Bryant 
writes me that small images of birds are rare among them, although

Mr. Bryant adds: 

Perhaps they attach a significance to the position of the fox hones, which may 
be analogous to the practice of using wooden or bone dice by other tribes.

Alaska. It is possible that they are used in the same manner as the 
fox bones. 

In the United States National JMuseum (Oat. No. 7404) are four 
wooden blocks, said to be used in a game, from the Northwest Arctic 
Coast. These blocks (fig. 45), which were collected by Mr. R. Kennicott. 
have a rounded base marked with two transverse cuts. They are })er- 
forated as if for stringing. From the locality given they are i)robabl\ 
Eskmiauau. 

Ill conclusion, reference should be made to a game described by Mur- 
doch' among the Point Barrow Eskimo with twisters and marline 
spikes used for backing the bow. 

Lieutenant Ray says he has seen it played with any hits of stick or hone. Accord- 
ing to him the players are divided into sides, who sit on the ground about 3 yards 
apart, each side sticking up one of the marline spikes for a mark to throw the 
twisters at. Six of the latter, he believes, make a complete set. One side tosses 
the whole set, one at a time, at the opposite stake, and the points which they make 
arc counted up by their opponents from the position of the twisters as they fall. 
He did not learn how the points were reckoned, except that twisters with a mark on

them counted differently from the plain ones, or how long the game lasted, each side 
taking its turn of casting at the opposite stake. He, however, got the impression 
that the winning side kept the twisters belonging to their opponents. Mr. Nelson 
informs me that a similar game is played with the same imijlements at Norton 
Sound. 

The present writer has repeated this account, from the general like- 
ness of the implements (sinew twisters) (fig. 40) to the staves tossed as 
dice, rather from any clearly apparent identity of the games. 

IROQUOIAN STOCK. 

Cherokee. North Carolina. 

I am informed by Mrs. Starr Hayes that the Cherokee play a game in 
a flat square basket of cane like the lid of a market basket, with col 
ored beans, under the name of " Black eye and white eye." The shal 
low basket used is li feet square. The beans are colored "batter 
beans," a variety of lima, and those selected are dark on one side and 
white on the other. Twelve beans are kept as counters. Six others 
are put in the basket, as they come, and the players, who are four in 
number, and each two partners, play in turn. The basket is held in

both bands, slightly shaken, and then with a jerk, the beans are tossed 
in tlie air. If all turn black, two are taken from the counters; if all 
turn white, three are taken. If but one turns up white, one is taken 
from tbe twelve. When they turn five white, one only is taken. The 
game is played three or six times weekly. Whoever gets twelve beans 
has the game. 

1 )ELAWARE. 

See account bj" Loskiel on page 725. 

Huron. Ontario, Canada. 
Charlevoix^ gives the following account: 

As I returned through a ([uarter of the Huron village I saw a company of these 
savages, Avho appeared very eager at play. I drew near and saw they were playing 
at the, game of the dish (Jen dii plat). This is the game of which these people are 
fondest. At this they sometimes lose their rest, and in some measure their reason. 
At this game they hazard all they possess, and many do not leave oft" till they are 
almost stripped quite naked and till they have lost all they have in their cabins. 
Some have been known to stake their liberty for a time, which fully proves their 
passiou for this game ; for there are no men in the world more jealous of their liberty 
than the savages. 

The game of the dish, which they also call the game of the little bones (jeii dcs 
osselefs), is only played by two persons. Each has six or eight little bones, which 
at first I took for apricot-stones; they are of that shape and bigness. But upon 
viewing them closely I perceived they had six unequalsurfaces, the two principal of 
wliicli are painted, one black and the other white, inclined to yellow. They make 
them jump up by striking the ground or the table with a round and hollow dish, 
which contaius them and which they twirl round first. When they have no dish 
they throw the bones up in the air with their hands; if in falling they come all of 
one color, he who plays wins five. The game is forty up, and they subtract the 
numbers gained by the adverse party. Five bones of the same color wiu but one for 
the first time, but the second time they win the game. A less number wins nothing. 

He that wins the game continues playing. The loser gives his place to another, 
who is named by the markers of his side ; for they make the parties at first, and 
often the whole village is concerned in the game. Oftentimes also one village plays 
against another. Each party chooses a marker; but he withdraws when he pleases, 
which never happens but when his party loses. At every throw, especially if it 
happens to l)e decisive, they make great shouts. The players appear like people 
possessed, and the spectators are not more calm. They all make a thousand contor- 
tions, talk to the bones, load the spirits of the adverse party with imprecations, and 
the whole village echoes with liowlings. If all this does not recover their luck, the 
losers may put oft' the party to the next day. It costs them only a small treat to the 
company. Then they prepare to return to the engagement. Each invokes his genius, 
and throws some tobacco in the fire to his honor. They ask him above all things 
for lucky dreams. As soon as day appears they go again to play; but if the losers 
fancy the goods in their cabins made them unlucky the first thing they do is to 
chang(^ them all. The great parties commonly last five or six days, and often con- 
tinue all night. In the meantime, as all the persons present, at least those who are 
concerned in tlie game, are in agitation that deprives them of reason, as they quar- 
rel and fight, which never happens among savages but on these occasions and in 
drunkenness, one may judgfe if when they have done playing they do not want rest.

722 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

It sometimes liai)peus that tliesc ])artie8ofpl:iy are made by order of the physician 
or at the request of the sick. There ueeds for this iiurpose no more than a dream of 
one or the other. This dream is always taken for the order of some spirit, and they 
prepare themselves for the game Avith a great deal of care. They assemble for sev- 
eral nights to ti\v and to see who has the luckiest hand. They consult their genii, 
they fast, the married persons observe continence, and all to obtain a favorable 
dream. Every morning they relate what dreams they have had and of all the things 
they have dreamt of which they think lucky and they make a collection of all 
and put them into little bags which they carry about with them, and if anyone has 
the leputation of being luckj' — that is, in the opinion of these peojile, of ha\ing a 
familiar sjiirit more powerful or more inclined to do good — they never fail to make 
him keep near him who holds the dish. They even go a great way sometimes to 
fetch him, and if through age or any infirmity he can not walk, they will carry him 
on their shoulders. 

They have often pressed the missionaries to he present at these gameSj as they 
believe their guardian genii are the most powerful. 

Brebeuf describes the game as follows: 

The game is also in great repute as a medicine, especially if the sick has dreamed of 
it. This game is a game of chance, pure and simple. They take six prune stones, 
white on one side and black on the other, put them in a plate, and shake the latter 
violently, so that the bones fall to the ground, showing one or the other side, as it 
may happen. The game is to get either all with the black side or all with the white 
side up. Generally they play village pitted against village. They all convene in a 
hut, and take places on benches ranged along the sides. The sick is carried in a 
coverlet, and the one who is to shake the plate (there is only one jilayer for each 
side) walks after the sick, head and face Avrapped in his robe. As soon as the player 
of the opposing party takes hold of the plate they cry aloud, Achinc achinc, achinc, 
trois, trois, irois, or rather, ioio, iolo, ioio, desiring that either three white or three 
black be thrown by him. This winter you would have seen a good many returning 
to their village, having lost their breeches at a time when there was nearly 3 feet 
of snow, as frolicsome as if they had won. What I find the most remarkable thing 
about it is the preliminary arrangements. Some of them fast several days before 
the game is to take place. The evening before they convene in a hut, and by a cere- 
mony try to find out the result of the game. The one who is chosen to hold the 
plate takes the stones, puts them in the plate, which he covers, so that nobody can 
touch them. After tbis they sing. After the song the plate is uncovered, and the 
stones are either all black or all white. 

Thereupon I asked a savage whether the opposing party did not do the same, and 
whether they could not get the stones arranged in the, same Avay. He answered 
" Yes." "Nevertheless," I said, "both can not win," which he did not know how to 
answer. He told me, further, two remarkable things: 

1. They choose for holding the plate someone who had dreamed that he won or 
who had a charm. Generally those who have one do not make a secret of it, but 
carry it about with them. They say that one person in our village rubs the stones 
with a certain ointment and never fails to win. 

2. In making the trial some of the stones disappear and are found after a time in 
the plate with the others. 

Father Lalemaiit^ relates the following: 

One of the latest foolish things which has hapjiened in this village was occa- 
sioned by a sick jierson in one of the neighboring villages, Avho, in order to regain

"game of platter" should be played for him. He spoke about it to the headmen,

who soou couvcued tlio council iiiul decided ui)on the date and the village which 
should be iuvited for this purpose, and this village was ours. A deputation was 
sent thence here to make the proposition, which was agreed upon, and then the nec- 
essary preparations were made by both ])artie8. 

This "game of platter" consists in tossing about in a w ooden dish several wild- 
plum pits, each being white ou one side and black on the other, from which follows 
gain or loss, according to the rules of the game. 

It is beyond my power to describe properly the earnestness and activity displayed 
by our Barbarians in getting ready and in seeking all means and signs of good luck 
and success in their game. They meet at night and pass part of it in shaking the 
plate to see who is the most adroit, and part in spreading out their charms aud 
exhorting them. Toward the end they all sleep in the same cabin, having pre- 
viously fasted and abstained for some time from their wives, all this to have a lucky 
dream, and the next morning they tell what has happened in the night. Finally, 
everything that they have dreamed could bring them good luck is collected and 
placed in bags for carrying. Besides this, they search everywhere for those Avho 
have charms affecting the game, or "Ascaudics " or familiar spirits to assist the one 
who holds the dish, and be nearest him when he shakes it. If there are any old 
men whose presence is recognized as efficacious iu increasing the strength and value 
of their charms, not content with carrying their charms, they load them on the 
shoulders of the young men in order to carry them to the place of assembly. As we 
pass in the country for })o\verful sorcerers, they do not fail to give us notice to pray 
and perform many ceremonies to cause them to win. 

As soon as they arrive at their appointed place, each party ranges itself along one 
or the other side of thii cabin, tilling it from top to bottom, under and above the 
■' audiihous," which are of bark and ma<le like a bed canopy or roof, corresponding 
to that below, fastened to the ground upon which they sleep at night. They place 
I lieniselves upon the poles that lie and are suspended along the length of the cabin. 
The two players are in the middle with their seconds who hold the charms. Every- 
one present bets with someone else whatever he pleases, and the game begins. 

It IS at this moment that everyone sets to praying or muttering I know not what 
words, with gestures aud violent agitations of the hands, eyes, and the entire face, 
all lor the purpose of attracting good fortune to themselves and exhorting their 
particular spirits to take courage and not let themselves be worried. Some are 
appointed to utter execrations and make contrary gestures for the purpose of forc- 
ing bad luck upon the other side and frightening the familiar spirits of the oppos- 
ing party. 

This game was played several times this winter throughout all the country, but I 
do not know how it hapi)ened that the villages where we have missions were always 
unlucky to the last degree, and a certain village lost 30 porcelain (wampum) collars 
each of 1,000 beads, which is in this country, as if we said in France, 50,000 pearls 
or j)ist(Aes.^ But this is not all. Always hoping to regain what they have lost, thi>y 
bet tobacco bags, clothes, shoes, and breeches, in a word, all they possess, so that, 
if they are unlucky, as happened to these people, they return home stark-naked, 
having lost even their breech-clouts. 

l!^icolas Perrott^ says: 

The savages have also a sort of game of dice, the box of which is a wooden plate, 
well rounded and well i)olished on both sides. The dice are made of six small flat 

• The term pistole was used only as a money of account. It was generally equiva- 
lent to 10 Ihrea tonrnoia. The lirre toin-nois was of 20 sous, in distinction from the 
livre of Paris of 25 sous. What the actual value would be no one can tell. It may 
be said that 50,000 pistoles was equal to 500,000 livres toiirnois at that time. (Personal 
letter from Prof. Dana C. Munro.)

pieces of bone, about the size of a plum stone. They are all alike, baving one of the 
faces colored black, red, green, or blue, and the other generally painted white or any 
different color from the tirst-raentioued face. They throw these dice in the plate, 
holding the two edges, and on lifting it they make them jump and turn therein. 
After having struck the dish on the cloth, they strike themselves at the same time 
heavy blows on the chest and shoulders while the dice turn about, crying "Dice! 
Dice! Dice!" until the dice have stopped moving. When they find five or six 
showing the same color, they take the grains which have been agreed upon with the 
opposite party. If the loser and his comrades have nothing more to play with, the 
winner takes all that is on the game. Entire villages have been seen gambling 
away their possessions, one against the other, on this game, and ruining themselves 
thereat. Tliey also challenge to a decision by one throw of the die, and when it 
happens that a party throws six, all those of the tribe that bet on him get up 
and dance- in cadence to the noise of gourd rattles. All passes without dispute. 
The women and girls also play this game, but they often use eight dice and do not 
use a dicebox like the men. They only use a blanket, and tlirow them on with the 
hand. 

Sagard Tbeodat' says: 

The men are addicted not only to the game of reeds (which they call "Aefcara," 
with three or four hundred small white reeds, cut equally to a length of a foot), but 
also addicted to other kinds of game, as for instance, taking a large wooden platter 
with five or six plum stones or small balls, somewhat flattened, about the size of the 
end of the little finger, or painted black on one side and white on the other. They 
8<iuat all around in a circle and take each his turn in taking hold of the platter 
with both hands, which they keep at a little distance from the floor, and bring the 
platter down somewhat roughly, so as to make the balls move about; they take it 
as in a game of dice, observing on which side the stones lie, whether it goes against 
them or for them. The one who holds the platter says, continually while strik- 
ing it, "Tet, tet, tet," thinking that this may excite and influence the game in his 
favor. 

For the ordinary game of women and girls (at times joined by men and boys) are 
used five or six stones (as those of apricots) black on one side and yellow on the 
other, which they hold in their hands as we do dice, throwing the stones a little 
upward, and after they have fallen on the skin which serves them as a carpet, they 
see w^hat the result is, and continue to play for the necklaces, ear ornaments, and 
other small articles of their companions, but never for gold or silver coin, because 
th(^,y do not know the use of it, so that in trade they barter one thing for another. 

I must not forget to mention that in some of their villages they play, which we 
call in Franco, Porter les Momons (carry the challenge). They send a challenge to 
other villages to come and play against them, winning their utensils, if they can, and 
meanwhile the feasting does not stop, because at the least inducement the kettle 
is on the fire, especially in winter time, at which time they especially feast and 
amuse themselves in order to pass agreeably the hard season. 

Huron (Wyandot). 

Col. James Smith^ describes the Wyandot as "playing a game 
resembling dice or hustle-cap. They put a number of plum-stones 
in a small bowl; one side of each stone is black and the other white; 
then they shake or hustle the bowl, calling hits, hits, hits, honesey,

Iroquois. Western Pennsylvania and southern New York. 
Loskiel ' gives the following account : 

The Indians arc naturally given to gambling, and frequently risk their arms, 
furniture, clothes, and all they possess to gratify this passion. The chief game of 
the Iroquois and Delawarcs is dice, which indeed originated with them. The dice 
are made of oval and llattish plum-stones, painted black on one and yellow on the 
other side. Two persons onlj^ can play at one time. They put the dice into a dish, 
which is raised alternately by each gambler and struck on the table or floor with 
force enough to make the dice rise and change their position; when ho who has the 
greater nixmber of winning color counts five, and the first who has the good fortune 
to do this eight times wins the game. The spectators seem in great agitation during 
the game, and at ev(^ry chance that appears decisive cry out with great vehemence. 
The gamblers distort their features, and if unsuccessful mutter their displeasure at 
the dice and the evil spirits who prevent their good fortune. Sometimes whole 
townships, and even whole tribes, i^lay against each other. One of the missionaries 
happened to be present when two Iroquois townships, having got together a number 
of goods, consisting of blankets, cloth, shirts, linen, etc., gambled for them. The 
game lasted eight days. They assembled every day, and every inhabitant of each 
township tossed the dice once. This being done, and the chance of each person 
noted down, thej- parted for the day. But each township offered a sacriiice in the 
evening to insure success to their party. This was done by a man going several 
times around a tire, throwing tobacco into it, and singing a song. Afterwards the 
whole company danced. When the appointed time for the game was at an end they 
compared notes, and the winner bore away the spoil in triumph. 

]\IOHAWK. New York. 

Bruyas ' in his radical words of the Mohawk language, written in 
the latter part of the seventeenth century, gives under Atnenha^ 
"Noyau" (stone of a fruit), tlie compounds TSatnenJiaSinneton, "jouer 
avec les noyaux comme sont les femmes, en les jettant la main," and 
T8atenna8eron, "y jouer au plat." 

Onondaga. New Y^ork. 

Kev. W. M. Beauchamp ' states : 

Among the Onondaga now eight bones or stones are used, black on one side and 
white on the other. Tliey term the game Ta-yoii-ni/nn-wdl-hah or, " Finger Shaker," 
and from one hundred to three hundred beans form the pool, as may be agreed. 
\\'ith them it is also a household game. In playing this the pieces are raised in the 
liand and scattered, the desired result being indifferently white or black. Essen- 
tially the counting does not differ from that given by Morgan (see p. 726). Two 
white or two black will have six of one color, and these count two beans, called 
O-ijii-ha, or the Bird. The player proceeds until he loses, when his opponent takes 
iiis turn. Seven white or black gain four beans, called O-nt'o-sah, or Pumpkin. All 
white or all black gain twenty, called 0-hen-tah, or a Field. These are all that 
draw anything, and we may indifferently say with the Onondaga, two white or black

for the Ih-st, or six with the Seneca. The game is played singly or by partners, 
and there is no limit to the number. Usually there are three or four players. 

In counting the grains there is a kind of ascending reduction ; for as two hirds make 
one pumpkin, only one bird can appear in the result. First come the twenties, then 
the fours, then the twos, which can occur but once. Thus we may say for twenty, 
Jo-hnn-l6-tah, "you have one field" or more, as the case maybe. In fours we can 
only say Ei-yae-ne-you-mli-la, "you have four pumpkins." for five would make a 
field. For two beans there is the simple announcement of 0-yxi-ali, "bird." 

The game of peach-stones, much more commonly used and important, has a more 
public character, although I have played it in an Indian parlor. In early days the 
stones of the wild plum were used, but now six peach-stones are ground down 
to an elliptic flattened form, the opposite sides being black or white. This is the 
great game known as that of the dish nearly three centuries ago. The wooden 
bowl which I used was 11 inches across the top and 3 inches deep, handsomely 
carved out of a hard knot. A beautiful small bowl, which I saw elsewhere, may 
have been used by children. The six stones are placed in the Kah-oon-wah, the 
bowl, and thence the Onondaga term the game Ta-yitne-oo-wdli-es, throwing the bowl 
to each other as they take it in turn. In public playing two players are on their 
knees at a time, holding the bowl between them. Beans are commonly used for 
counters. Many rules are settled according to agreement, but the pumpkin is left 
out, and the stones usually count five for a bird and six for a field. All white 
or all black is the highest throw, and five or six are the only winning points. In 
early d.ays it would seem that all white or all black alone counted. The bowl is 
simply struck on the floor. This ancient game is used at the New Year's or White 
Dog Feast among the Onondaga yet. Clan plays against clan, the Long House 
against the Short House, and, to foretell the harvest, the women play against the 
men. If the men win, the ears of corn will be long like them; but if the women 
gain the game, they will be short, basing the results on the common proportion of 
the sexes. As of old, almost all games are yet played for the sick, but they are 
regarded now more as a diversion of the patient's mind than a means of healing. 
The game of the dish was once much used in divination, each piece having its own 
familiar spirit. But it is more commonly a social game now. 

Seneca. New York. 

Morgan ' describes the Iroquois game under tlie name of Gus-ga-e-sd-td, 
or " deer-buttons." 

This was strictly a fireside game, although it was sometimes introduced as an 
amusement at the season of religious councils, the people dividing into tribes as 
usual and betting upon the result. Eight buttons, about an inch in diameter, were 
made of elk horn, and, having been rounded and polished, were slightly burned upon 
one side to blacken them [fig. 47]. When it was made a public game it was played 
by two at a time, with a change of players as elsewhere dc^scribed in the Peach-stone 
game. At the fireside it was ))layed by two or more, and all the players continued 
in their seats until it was determined. A certain number of beans (fifty perhaps) 
were made the capital, and the game continued until one of the players had won 
them all. Two persons spread a blanket and seated themselves upon it. One of 
them shook the deei'-buttons in his hands and then threw them down. If six turned 
up of the same color, it counted two; if seven, it counted four; and if all, it counted 
twenty, the winner taking as many beans from the general stock as he made points 
by the throw. He also continued to throw as long as he continued to win. When 
less than six came up, either black or white, it counted nothing, and the throw 
passed to the other player. In this manner the game was continued until the beans 
were taken up between the two players. After that the one paid to the other out of

his own winnings, the ganio ending as soon as the capital in the hands of either 
player was exhausted. If four played, each had a partner or played independently, 
as they were disposed; but when more than two played, each one was to pay the 
winner the amount won. Thus, if four were playing independently, and after the 
beans were distributed among them, in the progress of the game one of them should 
turn the buttons up all black or all white, the other three would be obliged to pay

him twenty each; but if the beans were still in bank, he took up but twenty. The 
•leer buttons were of the same size. In the figure [iig. 47] they are represented at 
different angles. 

An ancient and favorite game of the Iroquois, Gus-kd'-eh, was played with a Ijowl 
and peach-stones. It was always a betting game, in which the people divided by 
tribes. By established custom, it was introduced as the concluding exercise on the 
last day of the Green Corn and. the Harvest festivals, and also of the New Year's 
jubilee. Its introduction among 
them is ascribed to the first To-ilo- 
da'-ho, who flourished at the forma- 
tion of the League. A popular 
belief prevailed that this game 
would be enjoyed by them in the 
future life— in the realm of the 
Great Spirit— which is perhaps but 
an extravagant way of expressing 
their admiration for the game. A 
dish about a foot in diameter at the 
base was carved out of a knot or 
made of earthen. Six peach-stones 
were then ground or cut down into 
an oval form, reducing them in the 
process about half in size, after 
which the heart of the pit was re- 
moved and the stones themselves 

were burned upon one side to blacken them. The above representation [figs. 18, 
49] will exhibit both the bowl and tlie peach-stones, the latter being drawn in 
different positions to show the degree of their convexity. 

It was a very simple game, depending, in part, upon the dexterity of the player, 
but more upon his good fortune. The peach-stones were shaken in the bowl by the 
player, the count depending upon the number which came up of one color after they

had ceased rolling in tlie disb. It was played in the public council-bouse by a suc- 
cession of players— two at a time— under tbe supervision of managers appointed to 
represent tbe two parties and to conduct tbe contest. Its length depended some- 
what upon tbe number of beans which made the bank— usually one hundred— tbe 
victory beiug gained by tbe side which iinally won them all. 
A platform was erected a few feet from the lioor and spread with blankets. "When 

tbe betting was ended, 
and the articles bad 
been delivered into tbe 
custody of the mana- 
gers, they seated them- 
selves upon the plat- 
form m the midst of 
the throng of specta- 
tors, and two persons 
sat down to the game 
between tbe two divi- 
sions into which they 
arranged themselves. 
The beans, in tbe tirst 
instance, were placed 
together in a bauk. 
Five of them were 
given each player, 
with which they commenced. Each player, by tbe rules of the game, was allowed 
to keep his seat until be bad lost this outfit, after wbicli he surrendered it to another 
player on his own side selected by the managers of his own party. And this was 
the case, notbwitbstanding any number be might have won of his adversary. Those 
which he won Avere delivered to bis party managers. Tbe six peach-stones were 
placed in tbe bowl and shaken by the 
player ; if five of them came up of one 
color, cither white or black, it counted 
one, and bis adversary paid to him the 
forfeit, which was one bean ; the bean 
simply representing a unit in counting 
the game. On tbe next throw, which 
the player having won retained, if less 
than five came up of tbe same color it 
counted nothing, and be passed tbe bowl 
to his adversary. Tbe second player 
then shook tbe bowl ; u]>on which, if they 
all came up of one color, either white or 
black, it Cf)unted iive. To pay this for- 
feit required the whole outfit of the first 
player, after which, having nothing to pay 
with, be vacated his seat and was suc- 
ceeded bj'anotber of bis ownside, wbore- 
ceived from the bank the same number ot 
beans the first bad. Tbe other player fol- 
lowed bis throw as long as he continued 

to win; after which he repassed tbe bowl to bis adversary. If a player chanced to 
win five and his opponent bad but one left, this was all hecould gain. In this manner 
the game continued, with varying fortune, until the beans were divided between 
the two sides in proportion to their success. After this tbe game continued in tbe 
same manner as before, tbe outfit of each new player being advanced by the man- 
agers of bis own party; but as the beans or counters were now out of sight, none

but the managers knew tlie state of the game with accuracy. In playing it there 
were but two winning throws, one of which counted one and the other five. When 
one of the parties had lost all their beans, the game was done. 

The implemeuts for a Seneca bowl game in the possession of Mr. John 
N. B. Hewitt, of the Bureau of American Ethnology, obtained by him 
from the Seneca Indians, Cattaraugus Reservation, Cattaraugus 
County, New York, consist of a wooden bowl (fig. r>0), 9| inches in 
diameter, and six dice made of fruit stones. A set of bone gaming 
disks from the same tribe and place, also in his i)ossession, are repre- 
sented in plate 0. As will be seen, they are eight in number, and 
marked on one side, in a similar way to those of the Micmac and 
Penobscot. 
TUSCAROEA C?), North Carolina. 

Referring to the North Carolina Indians, Mr. John Lawson' writes: 

They have several other games, as with the kernels or stones of persimmons, 
which are in effect the same as our dice, because winning or losing depends on 
which si<le appears uppermost and how they happen to fall together. 

Again, speaking of their gambling, he says"^: 
Then- arithmetic was kept with a heap of Indian grain. 

He does not specify this game as played by any particular tribe in 
North Carolina, and it was probably common to all of them. 

KERESAN STOCK. 

Laguna. New Mexico. 
Capt. George H. Pradt, of Laguna, writes as follows: 

The game played with a circle of small stones is called, liy the Keres pueblos, 
" Ka-w:t-su-kuts." ' The stones number forty, and are divided into tens by openings 
called doors or gates called " Si-am-nia;" the doors are placed north, south, east, 
and west. 

In the center of the circle is placed a^flat stone, upon which are thrown the three 
counters. These are flat pieces of wood about 4 inches long, .V inch wide, and ^ inch 
thick; painted black on one side, and marked with 2, 3, and 10 marks, respectively. 
The counters are firmly grasped with the ends down, and forcibly thrown (ends 
down) on the stone in the center, in such a manner that they will rebound, and 
the marks, if any are uppermost, are counted, and the player lays his marker (a 
small stick like a pencil) between the stones the proper distance from the starting 
point to record the number. The starting point is one of the "doors," whichever is 
selected, and the game is played by any number that can assfiiible around the circle. 
A player can go around the circle in either direction, but if another player arrives at 
tliesame point he "kills" the previous player and that one is obliged to go back to 
the starting point; the lirst one making the circuit successfully wins the game, 
which is generally played for a small stake. The game is modified sotnetimes by 
ruling that if a player falls into one of the doors he must go back, but in this case the 
player is not obliged to go back if another happens to mark as many points as he. 

iSometimes a round stone is painted to resemble a face and has a wreath of ever-

greens placed aronna it, and is used as a mascot; it is placed to one side of the 
circle and is appealed to by the players to give tliem good nnmbers; this mascot is 
generally called " Kum-mfishk-ko-yo," a traditional fairy or witch. The name 
means "the old spider woman." 

SiA. New Mexico. 

Mrs. Matilda Coxe Stevenson ^ describes the game as played by tbe 
Sia under the name of Wash'lcasi. 

Forty pebbles form a square, ten pebbles on a side, with a tiat stone in the center 
of the square (fig. 51). Four flat blocks, painted black on one side and unpainted 
on the other, are held vertically and dropped upon the stone. 

The counts are as follows: 

4 painted sides up = 10 
4 unpainted sides uj) = 6 
3 painted sides up = 3 
2 painted sides uji = 2 
1 painted side up = 

The players move in opposite di- 
rections, both starting at one of the 
corners. The game is described as 
the first of four games played by 
Po'shaiyJinne, the Sia culture hero, 
with the tribal priest. The stake 
was the latter's house in the north. 
The second of the four games is of 
the bowl class, which I have included 
in this series. The stake in this 
game was the ti'iimoni, or priest's, 
house in the west. It was played with six 2-inch cubes, which were 
highly polished and painted on one side. These were tossed up in 
a large bowl held with each hand. " When three painted sides are 
up, the game is won ; with only two painted sides up, the game is lost. 
Six painted sides up is equivalent to a march in euchre." The games 
that followed were, first, a game played with four sticks with hollow 
ends, under one of which a pebble was hidden. This was played for 
the priest's house in the south. Second, a game played with four little 
mounds of sand, in one of which a small round stone was hidden. This 
was played for the priest's house in the east. The games were then 
repeated in the same order commencing with Wash'kasi for the house 
in the zenith, the game with the six blocks for the house in the nadir, 
and finally, the third in order, that with the four sticks with hollow 
ends, for all the people of the tribe. 

Mr. Charles F. Lummis informs me he has witnessed the game with 
the staves or blocks in the following pueblos belonging to this stock: 
Acoma, Oocliito, Laguna, El Kito(Laguna Colony) and San Feliije.

The woman who com]>osed 
this song tells how, on wak- 
ing up in the spirit world. 

she met there a party of her former girl <ompani..ns and sat down with them to 
play the two games uuivcrsally popular with the prairie tribes. 

Tlie first is called nv' biikn' thana by tlie Arapaho and tsonil or -'awl game" (from 
tson, an awl) by the Kiowa, on account of an awl, the Indian woman's substitute for 
a nc'edlc, being used to keep record of the score. The game is becoming ol)8olete in 
the north, but is the everyday summer amnsemeut of the women among the Kiowa, 
Comanche, and Apache in tlie southern plains. It is very amusing on account of the 
unforeseen " rivers" and " whips" that are constantly turning up to disappoint the 
expectant winner, and a party of women will frequently sit around the blanket for 
half a day at a time, with a constant ripple of laughter and good-humored jokes as 
they follow the chances of the play. It would make a very pretty picnic game, or 
could be readily adapted to the i>arlor of civilizatiou. 

The players sit on the ground around a blanket marked in charcoal with lines and 
dots and quadrants in the comers, as shown in lig. 6. In the center is a stone upou 
which the sticks are thrown. Each dot, excepting those between the parallels,

counts a point, making twenty-ibur points for dots. Eacli of the parallel lines and 
each end of the curved lines at tlie corners also counts a point, making sixteen 
points for the lines, or forty points in all. The players start at the bottom, oppos- 
ing jilayers moving in opposite directions, and with eacli throvr of the sticks the 
thrower moves an awl forward and sticks it into the ))lanket at the dot or line to 
which her throw carries her. The parallels on each of the four sides are called 
"rivers," and the dots within these parallels do not count in the game. The rivers 
at the top and bottom are "dangerous" and cau not be crossed, and when the 
player is so unlucky as to score a throw which brings her to the edge of the river 
(i.e., upon the first line of either of these pairs of parallels) she "falls into the 
river" and miist lose all she has hitherto gained, and begin again at the start. In 
the same way, when a player moving around in one direction makes a throw which

brings her awl to the jjlace occupied by the awl of her opponent coming around from 
the other side, the said opponent is "whipped back" to the starting point and must 
begin all over again. Thus there is a constant succession of unforeseen accidents, 
which furni.sh endh^ss amusement to the players. 

The game is played with four sticks, each from 6 to 10 inches long, flat on one 
side and round on the other. One of these is the trump stick, and is marked in a 
distinctive manner in the center on both sides, and is also distinguished by having 
a green line along the flat side, while the others have eath a red line. The KioAva 
call the trump stick sake, "green," on account of the green stripe, while the others 
are called (juadal, "red." There are also a number of small green sticks, about the 
size of lead pencils, for keei>ing tally. Each player in turn takes up the four sticks 
together in her hand and throws them down on end upon the stone in the center. 
The number of i)oint8 depends upon the number of flat or round sides which turn

up. A lucky throw with a greeu, or trump, stick generally gives the thrower 
another trial in addition. The formula is: 

1 flat side up ^= 1. 

1 flat side up (if sahe) = 1 and another throw. 

2 flat sides up (with or without s((he) = 2. 

3 flat sides up = 3. 

3 flat sides up (including sahe) = 3 and another throw. 

All 4 flat sides up =: 6 and another throw.

Collected by L. S. Dyer, Indian Agent. 
The game is described by Dr. Albert S. Gatschet,' under the name of 
SJ^iishash. 

The four teeth of tbe bt-aver aro marked for this game by the incision of parallel 
lines or crosses on one side, and a small piece of woolen or other cloth is inserte<l 
into the hollow to prevent breaks in lalling. The two longer or upper teeth of the 
beaver are called the male (lakf), the pair of lower and shorter the female teeth 
(giilo) kiilu; distributive form: kiikalu. The marked side of the teeth wins, if it 
is turned up after dropping. The teeth of the woodchuck (nui-i, moi) serve for the 
same pnrxjose. 

A further account of the game is found in the text translated by J)r. 
Gatschet: 

The Klamath Lake females play a game with beavers' teeth, letting them drop 
on a rubbing stone. When all the teeth fall with the marked side uppermost, they 
win two checks. If both female teeth fall right (marked) side up, they win one 
check. If both male teeth fall right side up, they win one check. Falling

In this game of beavers' teeth {piimaii ii'it) or woodchiicka' teeth {miUjam ttil) they

The beaver teeth game may be regarded as a modification of the 
bone game, phiyed by the Blackfeet. The four beaver teetli marked

four vsimilarly marked staves. Again the tooth tied with sinew (see

Collected by Stephen Powers. 
The game is thus described by the collector : ' 

Tlie Yokuts have a sort of 'vaiuMing which pertains exclusively to women. It is 
a ^iud of dice throwing and is called it-chit'-its. For a dice they take half of a large 
acorn or walnut siiell, lill it level with pitch and pounded charcoal, and inlay it 
with bits of bright-colored abalone sliells. For a dice-table they weave a very large, 
line basket-tray, almost flat, and ornamented with devices woven in black or brown, 
ni( stly rude imitations of trees and geometrical ligures. Four sc^uaws sit around it 
to play, and a fifth keeps tally witii fifteen sticks. There are eiglit dice, and they 
scoop them up in their hands and dash tliem into the basket, counting one when two 
or live flat surfaces turn np. The rapidity with which the game goes forward is 
wonderfn], and th<i players seem totally oLlivious to all things in the worhl beside.

The game is played by two, tliree, or four players for self or partners, 
with counters called "horses." These usually number two for each 
player. They are put into play consecutively and by alternate throws 
of the players. A throw of less than five, which does not carry the 
horses out of the door (two), prevents a player from entering another 
horse until his aggregate throws are 5-)-, thus putting his horse into 
the rectangle proi)er. After all the horses of a single contestant are 
in play, he may move the same horse continuously. In counting the 
pockets, from "A" to eithei- of the nearest corners, is 15. It is oi)ti()nal 
with the player whether he turns to the left or right upon leaving the 
door, though he must move his horse around the rectangle in the same

direction after once starting. If "X" throw IH, moving to "o," and 
" W" throws the same number, enabling him to move to the same point, 
he "kills" or throws "X's" horse out of play, and he must start his 
piece over again; and again, if he should throw 14, he accomplishes the 
same result (there is no "one" in the stick count). However, if "X" 
should get to "c" and " W" throw 10 from "house," and get to "(/," he 
does not kill him. If on the next throw "W" throws 14 and "X" has 
not moved from "c" he kills him. 

A horse must run entirely around the rectangle and back into the 
house pockets, where he is safe from being " killed;" but to make him 
a winning piece, the exact number to count to "rr" must be thrown by 
the sticks. When a horse is upon a pocket adjoining "<(," a two throw

Mr. Palmer states: 

A space of 10 S(]Uiin5 feet is inclosed by holes made in the gronnd (fig. 64). At 
opposite corners on the ontside are two semicircular rows of five holes each. At Ihe 

beginning a marking stick is put in the center 
hole A of each semicircle, and the point is to 
play around the square, and back again to the 
center hole. Each pair of players moves the 
pegs in opposite directions, and whenever the 
count is m..de that would bring the stick to the 
hole occupied by that of the antagonist, he is 
sent back to his original starting place. 
The counts are as follows: 

4 round sides up = 10. 
4 flat sides up = 5. 

When only one flat side is up, it counts what- 
ever is marked on it; any three, counts 3, and any 
two, 2.

Tepeguana. Cliihualiua, Mexico. (Cat. No. 1039? Amer. Mus. Xat. 

Hist, New York.) 

Set of four sticks of canyon walnut or liickory, of slii^litly difierent 

Jengtbs, from llj to 13i inches; J i inch wide and 1 inch thick. One 

side Hat with incised desijins coni])osed of straight and oblique lines, 

the incised places being stained 
red (Plate 30, fig. 3); opposite 
sides rounded and plain. 

Tepeguana. Chihuahua, Mex- 
ico. (Cat. No. Tots? Amer. 
Mus. Nat. Hist., New York.) 
Set of four sticks of pinon wood, 
6^ iuc])es in length and | inch 
square. These sticks have four 
instead of two faces. Two oppo- 
site sides are fat and unpainted. 
One set of the other four sides are 
uni)ainted, with incised lines filled 
with red i)aint, as shown in tig. 06. 
The sides opposite to these are 
slightly rounded and painred red. 
The top stick is marked with a 
diagonal line across the middle, the 
next with two straight transverse 
lines near each end, the thiid is 
])lain, and the fourth has a single 
transverse cut across the middle. 
The i)receding Tarahumara and 
Tepeguana s]>ecimens were all collected by Dr. Carl Lumholtz. He 
informs me that the Tepeguana call the game In-tu ri ija-i \ zn-Ji | (la-i- 
r/(-(/a-i, "game straight throwing." It is also generally known by the 
S])anish name of Quince,^ or "Fifteen." 

He states that it is played by all the tribes in Chihuahua who live 
in or near the Sierra, and by the Mexicans as well, but is not seen 
south of the State of Durango. it is not known to the Cora or 
Huichole in tlie State of Jalisco, or to tlie Tarasco of Michoacan.^ 

• Also in Frencli, Quinze, "a popular game with cards, in which the object is to 
make fiftci'u points." The name Quince does not appear to be confined amoni,^ tlie 
Indians to the game played with staves. Mr. Edward Palmer describes the follow- 
ing game under the name of (Jiihis {qtiincei) among the Pima of Arizouii : "Any 
number can play. A short, split stick is first thrown in a slanting direction, nnd 
each one )>itches his arrow to see who can come nearest to it. Tlie one who does so 
holds llie stick up while the others pitch. If the arrow touches the split stick and 
does not catch, 1 he thrower loses nothing. If, however, the arrow remains in the 
split stick it becomes the property of the holder. The game ends when one has all 
the arrows or they tire out." 

2Mr. C. V. Hartman, who accompanied Dr. Lumholtz, informs me that Quince is 
played with lour ilatteued reeds l)y the Zacjue Indians of the Rio Fuerte in Sinaloa. 
Thoy call the game in their language ke-su-te.

XiSHiNAM. California. Powers' gives the following account: 

The ha is a gaiiio of dice, played by men or women, two, tlirt'e, or four togetlier. 
TLc dice, fonr in number, consist of two acorns split lengthwise into halves, with 
the outsides scraped and painted red or black. They are shaken in the hands and 
thrown into a wide, Hat basket, woven in or- 
namental patterns, sometimes Avorth $25. 
One paint and three whites, or vice versa, 
score nothing; two of each score one; four 
alike score four. The thrower keeps on throw- 
ing until he makes a blank throw, when 
another takes the dice. "When all the i)lay- 

ers have stood their turn, the one who has V. 

scored most takes the stakes, which in this 
game are generally small, say a "bit."

cross lines. They are 
called "men" {.siiwe'

them is tied with a 

small string in the middle. It is called iHJc-' aA*" ("' sen. The game is played by two 

persons. According to the value of tiie stakes, thirty or forty sticks are placed 

between the players. One begins to throw; When all the marked laces are either 

up or down he wins two sticks. 

If the faces of the two "men" 

are up, of the two "women" 

down, or rice veraa, he wins one 

stick. When the face of the iHk-'

Whoever wins a stick goes on 

playing. When one of the play- 
ers has obtained all the sticks 

he wins the game.

Bev. M. Eells writes:^ 

The dice are made of beavers' teetli generally, but sometimes from iiuiskrats' 
teeth. There are two pairs of them, and generally two persons play, one on each 
s'ide, bnt sometimes there are two or three on each side. The teeth are taken in one 
hand and thrown after the manner of dice. One has a string around the middle. 
If this one is down and all the rest are up, or up and the rest down, it counts four; 
if all are up or down, it counts two; if one pair is up and the other down it counts 
one; if one ])air is up or down and the other divided, unless it be as above, when ib 
counts four, then it counts nothing; 30 is a game, but they generally jday three 
games, and bet more or less, money, dresses, or other things. They sometimes learn 
very expertly to throw the one with the striiig on diii'erently from the others, by 
arranging them in tlie hand so they can hold this one, which they know by feeling, 
a tritle longer than the others.

shuffled by tossing them in a little tray basket, or kaichoals, sometimes used by the 
women as caps, but having a more general use as gathering baskets. They were 
shaken up under the concealment of a blanket and tossed upon another blanket, and 
different arrangement produced different numbers, which were counted upon little 
sticks. Each party in the game started with a definite number of these sticks, and 
the final winner was the one who accumulated all iu his pile.

Denig, a manuscript ^ in the library of the Bureau of American Eth- 
nology, there occurs tlie following accounts of the bowl and stave game 
among the Assinaboin: 

. Most of the leisiu-c time, either by night or by day, among all these nations is 
devoted to gambling in various ways, and such is their infatuation that it is the 
cause of much distress and poverty in families. For this reason the name of being 
a desperate gambler forms a great obstacle in the way of a young man getting a 
wife. Many quarrels arise among them from this source, and we are well acquainted 
with an Indian who a few years since kiHed another because after winning all he 
had he refused to put up his wife to be played for. Every day and night in the sol- 
dier's lodge not occupied by busi- 
ness matters presents gambling in 
various ways all the time; also in 
many private lodges the song of 
hand gambling and the rattle of 
the bowl dice can be heard. 

Women are as much addicted to 
the practice as men, though their 
games are difl'ercnt, and not being 
in possession of much projicrty 
their losses, although 'considerable 
to them, are not so distressing. 
The princijial game played by men 
is that of the bowl, or cosso-6, 
"which is a bowl made of wood 
with flat bottom 1 foot in diame- 
ter or less, the rim turned np about 
2 inches, and highly polished inside 
and out. A drawing and a descrip- 
tion of the arithmetical principles 
oi this game is now attached in 
thisplace. Themanner of counting 
therein mentioned is the nuinner in 
which we learned it from the Indi- 
ans, but the value of each of the articles composing the dice can be and is changed 
sometimes in default of some of them being lost, and again by agreement among the 
players in order to lengthen or shorten the game or facilitate the counting. How- 
ever, the best and most experienced Lauds play it as it is represented. It can be 
played between two or four; that is, either one on each side or two against two. 
The game has no limit unless it is so agreed in the commencement, but this is 
seldom done, it being usually understood that the jilayers continue until one party 
is com]di-tely ruined. 

The dice and their counts [tig. 77] are as follows: 

One large crow's claw, red on one side and black on the other, being the only one 
that will occasionally stand on end, in which case twenty-live for it is counted, 
besides its value of live when on its side. 

Four small crow's claws, i)ainted the same as the large one, which count live each 
if the red side turns uj); if the black, nothing. 

Five plum stones, black on one side and scraped white on the other; the black 
sides turned np are A'alued at four each; the white sides nothing. 

Five small round pieces of blue china, i inch in diameter, which count three each 
for the blue side; the white side nothing.

The bowl is held by the tii)S of the four fingers inside the rim. and the thumb 
underneath. The dice being i)ut in, they are thrown up a few iuches'by strikin.; the 
bottom of the bowl on the ground, so that each counter makes several revolutions. 
It is altogether a game of chance, and no advantage can be taken by anyone in 
making tlie throws. The conut<'Vs or dice never leave the bowl, but are counted as 
the value turns ui> accordingto the plate inserted in this place describing the same. 
One person h iviug shaken it and the amount of his throw having been ascertained, 
a re<|uisiLe number of small sticks are placed before him, each stick counting one. 



CHESS AND PLAYING-CARDS. 753 

In this way the game is kept, but each keeps his adversary's game, not his own; 
that is, he liands him a number of sticks equal to the amount of his throw, which 
are laid so that all can see them. P2ach throws in turn unless the big claw stands 
on end, in which case the person is entitled to a successive throw. By much practice 
they are able to count the number turned up at a glance, and the principles of the 
game being stated on the drawing we will now describe how it is carried on. It 
has been observed in these pages, iu references to their gambling, that it is much 
fairer in its nature than the same as carried on by the whites, and this is worthy of 
attention, inasmuch as it shows liow the loser is propitiated, so that the game may 
not result in quarrel or bloodsh(Ml, as is often the case. The game is mostly played 
by the soldiers and warriors, and each must feel equal to the other in courage and 
resolution ; it is often kept up for two or three days and nights without any inter- 
mission, except to eat, until one of the parties is ruined. 

iu'am7*/e.— A plays against B; each puts up a knife, and they throw alternately 
until 100 is counted by dice; say A wins. B now puts up his shirt against two 
knives, which is about equal in value ; say A wins again. B then stakes his powder- 
horn and some arrows against the whole of A's winnings. Should B now win, the 
game commences again at the beginning, as A would only have lost a knife; but, 
supi)osiug A wins, B now puts up his bow and quiver of arrows against all A 
has wou. The stakes are never withdrawn but let lie iu front of them. Say A again 
wins. B then stakes his blanket and leggings, which are about equal in value to all 
A has won, or, if not, it is eciualized by adding or subtracting some article. Sup- 
posing A again to be winner, he would then be in possession of 2 knives, 1 shirt, 
1 blanket, 1 powderhorn, 1 bow and quiver of arrows, and 1 pair leggings, the 
whole of which the Indians value at 8 robes. B now stakes his gun against all the 
above of A's winnings; now if A again wins, he only retains the gun, and the whole 
ot the rest of the property won by A returns to B, but he is obliged to stalce it all 
against his gun in possession of A, and ]day again. If A wins the second time, he 
retains the whole, and B now puts u]i his linrse against all of A's winnings, including 
gun. If A wius, he retains only the horse, and the gun and everything else revert 
again to B, he being obliged to stake them again against the horse in A's possession. 
If A wins this time, hefkeeps the whole, but if B wius he only gets back the hor.se 
and gun, and all the rest of the property goes to A. Supposing B again loses and 
continues losing uutil all his personal property has passed into the hands of A, then 
B, as a last resort, stakes his wife and lodge against all his property in the hands of 
A. If A wins, he only keeps the woman; the horse, gun, and all other property 
returns again to B, with the understanding, however, that he stake it all to get back 
his wife. Now if B loses, he is ruined, but if A loses he gives up only the woman 
and the horse, continuing to play with the rest of the articles against the horse 
until one or the other is broke. 

At this stage of the game the excitement is reri) great. The spectators crowd 
around and intense fierceness prevails. Few words are exchangeil, and no remarks 
made l)y those looking on. If the loser be completely ruined and a desperate man, 
it is more than likely he will by quarrel endeavor to repossess himself of some of 
his property, but they are generally well matched in this respect, though bloody 
struggles are often the conseijuence. We have known Indians to lose everjithing, 
horse, dogs, cooking utensils, lodge, wife, even to his wearing apparel, and be obliged 
to beg an old skin from someone to cover himself, and seek a shelter in the lodge of 
one of his relations. It is, however, considered a mark of manliness ta sutfer no

the whole of the marked sides or all the fair sides 
of the sticks are turned up, she is entitled to a 
successive throw. The game is forty, and they 
count by small sticks as in the preceding. In line 
weather many of these gambling circles can be seen outside their lodges, spending 
the whole day at it, instead of attending to their household affairs. Some men 
prohibit their wives from gambling, but these take the advantage of their husbands'

to the dresses of their children, and the passion appears to be as deeply rooted in 
them as in the men. They frequently are thrashed by their husband for their losses 
and occasionally have quarrels among themselves as to the results of the game.

seeds are put in a bowl, which is hit against a pillow and not ou the bare ground, 
lest it should break the bowl. When three seeds show black and two have the 
moon on the upper side it is a winning throw, but when one is white, one black, the 
third black (or white), the fourth showing a moon, and the fifth a star, it is a los- 
ing throw. The gam(^ is played tor small stakes, such as rings and necklaces.

Set of .seven plum-stones, plain ou one side and with marks burnt 
upon the other. Collected by Dr. Z. T. Daniel,' who describes the game 
as foUows under the name of Kansu: 

This is a very ancient game of the Sioux Indians, played usually by (dderly women, 
although young women and men of all ages play it. Kansu is an abbreviation of 
kanta hii, which means plum-see<l. They drop the ta and call the game lansu, because 
it is played with plum-seeds. It is used for gambling and amusement and is more 
like our dice than any other of our games. ^Yllen playing, the seeds are thrown up 
in a basket or bowl and the markings on th(^ seeds that are up or down decide the 
throw. 

The seeds used are those of the wild plum of the Dakotas and indigenous through- 
out tiie northwest region of the United States generally. They are seven in number. 
On one side they are all perfectly plain and of the natural color, except some fine 
marks ou four to distinguish them when the burnt sides are down, but ou the reverse 
side ol" all there are burnt markiTigs. Tiiese markiugs are made by a piece of hot 
iron, such as a nail, the blade of a knife, or a piece of hoop iron. Before the natives 
used iron they used a hot stone. Six of the seeds are in pairs of three ditferent 
kinds, and only one is of a different marking from all the others. One pair is

scorcbed entirely on one side, another pair has an nnburnt line about 2 millimeters 
wide traversing their longitudinal convexity (the remainder of their surfaces on 
that side being scorched) ; the remaining pair have one-half of one side burnt longi- 
tudinally, the other half of the tsanie side unburnt, but traversed by three small 
burnt lines equidistant about 1 millimeter Avide running across Ihjeir short axes. 
The remaining and only single seed has an houi-glass figure burnt on one side, the 
contraction in the ligure corresponding to the long diameter of the seed. They are 
all of the same size, about 16 millimeters long, 12 wide, and 7 thick, and are oval, 
having the outlines and convexity on each side of a diminutive turtle shell. When 
the Sioiix first obtained our ordinary playing cards they gave to them, as well as to 
the game, the name kansii, because they were used by the whites and themselves 
for the same purpose as their original kansii. The men do not use the seeds or the 
original lansn now, but they substitute our cards. The women, however, do use the 
game at the present time. When a ration ticket was issued to them thej-^ gave it 
the name of kansu, because it was a card; so also to a postal card, business card, or

anything of the description of a card or ticket; a railroad, street-car, milk, store, 
or circus ticket would be called a ka)isii ; so that the evolution of this term as applied 
to a ticket is a little interesting. 

The description of the game kansu, as related by the Sioux is as follows: Any 
number of persons may play, and they call the game kansu kute, w^hich literally 
means "to shoot the seeds." When two persons play, or four that are partners, 
only six of the seeds are used, the hourglass or king kansu being eliminated. The 
king is used when a number over two are playing and each one for himself. The 
three-line seeds are called "sixes," the one-line "fours," those that are all black 
"tens." When two play for a wager they each put sixteen small sticks, stones, 
corn, peas, or what jiot into a common pile between them, making in all thirty-two. 
The play begins by putting the seeds into a small bowl or basket and giving it a 
quick upward motion, which changes the positions of the seeds, then letting them 
fall back into the receptacle, care being taken not to let any one fall out. The 
markings that are up decide the throw, precisely on the principle of our dice. As 
they count, they take from the pile of thirty-two what they make, and when the pile 
is exhausted the one having the greatest number wins the game. If all the white

sides are up, the throw couuts sixteen. The two "tens" up and four whites coTiut six- 
teen. Two pairs up count six, and the player takes another throw. Two "sixes" 
down count four. If botli "tens" are down, either side symraetrically, it counts 
ten. If all burnt sides are up, it is sixteen. If both "fours" are down, it is six. 
If two pairs are up, it counts two. One pair up does not count unless all the others 
are down. Wlien more tlian two play, and each for himself, the "king" is intro- 
duced. If the king is up and all the others down, the count is sixteen. If they are 
all up, the count is the same. If two pairs are up, the count is six. If the king is 
down and the remainder up, the count is sixteen.

about 12 inches in length, and seven iron sticks about 11 inches in 
length (consisting of iron ribs of the umbrella). Collected by Mr. 
Horatio ^^. Kust in 1873. 

Comparison of the various accounts of the plum stone game as jtlayed 
by the Sioux shows many variations in the markings on the seeds. 
This is well illu.strated in the account given by Schoolcraft,^ who 
describes the game among the Dakota tribes under the name of Knn- 
tah-.so, which he translates as "the game of the plum-stones." 

He figures five sets of stones, each consisting of eight pieces. 

In set A (Plate 12), Nos. 1 and 2 represent sparrow hawks with forked tails, or the 
fork-tailed eagle, Falco fnrcatus. This is the so-called war eagle. Nos, 3 and 4 are

denotes the reversed sides of A, which are all blanks. 

Set C shows ditterent characteristics, with a single chief figure (.5), which repre- 
sents the Falco furcatiis. This throw indicates half a game, and. entitles the tl:rower 
to repeat it. If the same figure (5) turns up, the game is won. If uo success attends 
it by throwing up the chief figure, the throw passes to other hands. 1) is the 
reverse of C and is a blank throw. 

In set E, No. .5 represents a ninskrat. The three dots (7) indicates two-thirds of a 
throw and the thrower can throw again; but if he gets blank the second time, the 
dish passes on to the next thrower. Set F is invested with difl'erent powers. No. I 
represents a bulfalo, and 2 and 3 denote chickeu hawks, fluttering horizontally in 
the air. The chief i)ieces (5, G, and 7) have the same powers and modifications as A. 

To play this game, a little orifice is made in the ground and a skin put in it. 
Often it is also played on a robe. The women and young men plaj- this game. The 
bowl is lifted with one hand about 3 or 4 inches and sud;lenly ]iushed down to its 
]dace. The plum-stones fly over several times. The stake is first put up by all who 
wish to play. A dozen can play at ouce, if it be desirable. 

Dr. H, C. Yarrow' refers to the plum stone game, in liis paper on In- 
dian mortuary customs, as described to bim by Dr. Charles E. jMcChes- 
uey, IT, S. A., among the Walipeton and Sisseton (Dakota) Sioux. 

After the death of a wealthy Indian the near relatives take charge of the effects, 
and at a stated time, usually at the time of the first feast held over the bimdle con- 
taining the lock of hair, they are divided into many small piles, so as to give all 
the Indians invited to play an opportunity to win something. One Indian is selected 
to represent the ghost, and he plays against all the others, who are not required to 
stake anythingon the result, but simply invited to take part in the ceremony. Which 
is usually held in the lodge of the dead person, in whicli is contained the bundle 
containing the lock of hair. In cases where the ghost himself is not wealthy the 
stakes are furnished by his rich friends, should ha have any. The players are called 
in one at ;i time, and play singly against the ghost's representative, the ganililing 
being done in recent years by means of cards. If the invited player succeeds in 
beating the ghost, lie takes one of the piles of goods and passes out, when another 
is invited to play, etc., until all the piles of goods are won. In cases of men, only 
the men play, and in cases of women, the women only take part in the ceremony. 
Before white men came among these Indians and taught them many of his improved 
vices, this game was played by means of figured iilum seeds, the men using eight 
and the women seven seeds, figured as follows and as shown in plate 13. Two seeds 
are simply blackened on one side (AA), the reverse {aa) containing nothing. Two 
seeds are black on one side, with a small 8i)ot of the color of the seed left in the 
center (BB), the reverse side (&&) having a black spot in the center, the body being 
plain. Two seeds have a buffalo's head on one side (C) and the reverse (c) simply 
two crossed black lines. There is but one seed of this kind in the set used by 
women. Two seeds have the half of one side blackened and the rest left plain, so 
as to represent a half moon (DD); the reverse {M) has a black longitudinal line 
crossed at right angles by six small ones. There are six throws whereby the player 
can win, and five that entitle him to anoth<'r throw. The winning throws are as 
follows, each winner taking a i»ile of the ghost's goods: 

Two plain ones up, two plain Avith black spots up, bufialo's head up, and two half 
moons up wins a pile. Two plain black ones up, two black with natural spot up, 
two longitudinally crossed ones up, and the transversely crossed one up wins a pile.

by the collector, was kindly placed in my bands by Mr. F. Webb Ifodge, 
of the Bnreau of Anierican Ethnology: 

Grains of coin or pebbles are laid in the form of a scinare, in sections of ten each. 
Tlic two jilayers sit on eitlier side. Tlie sticks, called e-pfe, are thrown in turn on a 
stone placed in the square. Tiie counts are as follows : 

2 flat and notched stick notches up =: 1.5 

3 round sides up ^10 
3 flat sides up = 7 
2 flat and 1 lound side not notched up =: 3 
1 flat and 2 round sides not notched ui> = 1 

The players move tiieir markers between the giaius or pebbles according to their 
throw, going in opposite directions. The one first returning to the starting point 
wins. This is the ordinary way. Sometimes, the markers being considered as horses, 
a player will attempt to kill his adversary's horses. In tbis case he so announces at 
the commencement of the gan)e, and he then moves his marker in the same direction, 
and, by duplicating the first throw, or, if at any future stage of the game, alwaj'8 
following, he succeeds in placing his marker where his adversary's is, by so doing 
he kills that horse (marker) and sends him back to the place of beginning. The 
latter may then elect to move in the same direction as before, and kill and send back 
his adversary, but, if he wishes, he may go in the opposite direction, in which case 
he does no killing. The game is called Tuf/i-e-j)fc, meaning "the thrown stick" 
(tugi "to throw"). 

Mr. Dozier states that the stick with fifteen notches gives rise to the 
Mexican name of Quince (ftlteen), which is sometimes given its Tewa 
equivalent Tadi-pira no-pfe^ and Juego de Pastor (Shepherd's game). 

Tewa. Isleta, New Mexico. 

Mr. Charles F. Lummis^ gives the following acconut of the game in 
Isleta: 

The boys gather forty smooth stones the size of the fist, and arrange them in a 
circle about 3 feet in diameter. Between every tenth and eleventh stone is a gate 
of 4 or 5 inches. These gates are called p'dy-hlah (rivers). In the center of the 
circle, ija-tol ixilit-hch — "pa-tol house," is placed a large cobblestone, smooth and 
approximately flat on top, called h>iee-oh-tee-(ii/. There is your pa-tol ground. 

The pa-tol sticks, which are the most important part of the paraphernalia, are 
three in number. Sometimes they are made by splitting from dry branches, and 
sometimes by whittling from a solid block. The chief essential is that the wood be 
firm and hard. Th(> sticks are 4 to 5 inches long, about an inch wide, and a quarter 
of an inch thick, and must have their sides flat, so that the three may be clasped 
together very much as one holds a pen, but more nearly perpendicular, with the 
thumb and first three fingers of the right hand. Each stick is plain on one side 
and marked on the other, generally with diagonal notches, as shown in fig. 8r). 

The only other requisite is a kah-nid-ileh (horse) for each player, of whom tliere 
may be as many as can seat themselves around the pa-tol house. The "horse" 
is merely a twig or stick, used as a marker. When the players have seated them- 
selves, the first ti'.kes the patol sticks tightly in his right hand, lifts them about

decides the "denoiniuatioi) " of the tbrow, and tlie different values are shown in 
fi^. 89. Altbongb :it (irst Hnsli this might seem to make it a game of chance, noth- 
ing couhl he farther from the truth. Indeed, no really aboriginal game is a true 
game of chance ; the invention of that daugerous and delusive plaything was reserved 
for civilized ingenuity. 

An expert pa-toJ player will tbrow the number be desires 
Avitb almost unfailing certaiuty by bis arrangement of the 
sticks in bis band and the manner and force with which be 
strikes them down. It is a dexterity which any one may acquire 
by sufHcient .i)ractice, and only thus. The tive-tbrow is deemed 
very much the hardest of all, and I have certainly found it so. 
According to tlie. number of bis throw the player moves bis 
marker ;in equal number of stones ahead on the circle, using 
one of the "rivers"' as a starting point. If the throw is five, 
for instance, be lays bis "horse"' between the fourth and tifth 
stones, and bands the pa-tol sticks to the next man. If bis 
\ \ \ throw be ten, however, as the first man's first tbrow is very cer- 

tain to be, it lands bis horse in the second "river," and be has 
another tbrow. The second man may make bis starting point 
the same or another "river," and may elect to lun his "horse" 
around the circle in the same direction that the first is going or 
iu the opposite. If in the same direction, be will do bis best to 
make a tbrow which will bring his "horse" into the same 
notch as that of the first man, iu which case the first man is 
"killed,"' and has to take bis "horse" back to the starting 
point to try over again when be gets another turn. In case the 
second nuiu starts in the opposite direction — which be will not 
From i.uinmis. do uulcss au cxpcrt player — be has to calculate with a good deal 

of skill for the meeting, "to kill" and to avoid being "killed" 
by No. 1. When be starts in the same direction as No. 1, be is behind, and runs no 
chance of being "killed," wliile he has just as good a chance to kill. But if, even 
then, a high throw carries him ahead of the first man — for 
"jumping" does not count either way, the only "killing"' 
being when two " horses " come iu the same notch — bis rear is in 
danger, and be will try to run on out of the way of bis pursuer 
as fast as possible. The more players the more complicated 
the game, for each "horse "is threatened alike l)y foes that 
chase from behind and charge from before, and the most skillful 
player is liable to be sent back to the starting point several 
times before the game is finished, which is as soon as one 
"horse" has made the complete circuit. Sometimes the 
players, when very young or unskilled, agree there shall be 
no "killing;" but unless there is an explicit arrangement to 
that effect, "killing'" is i;nderstood, and it adds greatly to the 
interest of the game. 

There is also another variation of the game, a rare one, bow- 
ever. In case the players agree to tbrow fifteens, all the pa-tol 
sticks are made the same, except that one has an extra notch 
to distinguish it from the others. Then the throws are as 
shown in fig. 90.

I feel quite confident, I saw it also in San Juan (Tewan), though of that I would 
not be positive. I can not remember seeing the game played in Jemez, Picuris, and 
Pqjo.ique (Tewau); in Sia (Keresan) or any of the Moqui Pueblos excejit Teliua 
(which of course is a village of migration from the Eio Grande). In Nambo (Tewan)

to distinguish it. Employed in the game of Ca-se-he-a-pa-na (Spanish, 
Pastore). of which the collector, Dr. T. P, Martin, of Taos, has furnislied 
the following account: 

A circle, from 2 to 3 feet in diameter (fig. 92), is marked oii the 
ground with small stones. One hnndred and sixty stones are 
used, with larger ones at each quarter, dividing the circle into 
four quarters of forty stones each. A line AB is marked out 
as a " river," and is usually marked from east to west. The 
line CD is designated as a "trail." A large stone is placed in 
the center. 

There are two players, each of whom takes one of the little 
twigs, which are known as "horses," A player takes the three 
stones, holds them together, and drops them vertically upon the 
large stoue. He counts according to their fall, and moves his 
hor.se as many places around the circuit. They throw and move 
iu turn, going in opposite directions, one starting from K and 
the other from M. If M passes point B before K reaches it, and 
meets K's horse anywhere around the circle, K's horse is said to 
be "killed," and has to go back to A and start over again, and rice versa. A chief 
point in the game is to reach B before the other player, so as to kill him on the 
second half of the circle.

The preceding Zunian staves were collected by Col. Jarnes Steven- 
son. They were all used, as I am informed, by Mr. Cashing, for the 
game of Ta'-sho'-U-ice, or " wooden canes '' (one of the seven sacred 
games of Zufii), which he described to me as follows: 

Ta'-s}io'-U-ice- is played accordiug to the throws of three wooden blocks, painted red 
on one side and black upon the other, around a circle of stones placed upon the sand. 
Two or four players enj^age, using two or fonr splints as markers, and advancing, 
according to their throws around the circle, which is divided into forty parts by 



' Deal boards, imported into Znni. 

- Ta'-sho'-U-we was desi^ribcd by .lohn G. Owens ("Some Games of the Znni") in the 
Popular Science Monthly for May, 1891. He gives the name of the central stone as

at these points: at the top (North) a yellow splint; at the left (West) a blue; at 
thel)Ottom (South) a red, and at the right (East) a white splint. The blocks are 
tossed ends down on a disk of sandstone placed in the middle of the circle, and the 
counts are as follows: 

3 red sides up =10

2 red and one black = 3 

2 black and one red = 2 
A count of ten gives another throw.

being used to count the number of times a player has gone around. The colors on 
the Avooden blocks or dice symbolize the two conditions of men : 

Red, light or wakefulness;

consist of common marsh reed. Mr. Cashing has kindly placed in my 
hands the following hitherto unpublished account of tiho'-li-ice: ' 

The game of Sho'-Ii-tve is certainly the most distinctive of any practiced by tlie 
Zuni Indians. It is not confined to them, but forms of it are found among all the 

' Mr. Owens described Sho'-li-ire in the paper referred to in a preceding note 
(p. 773). The names of the four sticks he gives as follows: The one who.se concave 
side is entirely black, quin, the Zuni for black; the one with one black end, paih-io; 
with two black ends, kd-ha-lira; and the one with a black center, ath-lu-a. He 
figures two of the reeds, and the manner of holding the sticks, which he describes 
as thrown with the right hand against a suspended blanket and allowed to fall on 
another blanket. " Two of the pieces belong to each man and are companions. There 
is a pool with twelve markers, and he who wins the markers wins the game. The 
winner takes the twelve markers uji into his hands and breathes on them. This is 
because they have been good to him and allowed him to win. It is wholly a game 
of chance, and horses, guns, saddles, and everything are staked upon the throw.

more settled of the. present ludiaiis in Ijotli oar own southwest, and iu northern, 
■western, and central Mexico; w'hih>. variants of it and derived games may he traced 
over well-nigh the whole western half of our continent. 

A study of the distinctive marks of the ditterent sticks or cane slips used in this 
game hy the Zuni would seem to indicate that this peculiar form of it is the most 
primitive. The reason for this will subsequently appear. 

The name sho'-li-ive is derived from aho o U, ''arrow, ' and u-e, plural ending, signify- 
ing "parts of," sho we being the plural of simjile arrows. Sho o li, or "arrow," is 
derived in turn from sho o Je, "cane/' the termination Ji in the derived word being 
a contraction of li a, and signifying "out of," "from," or "made of." Thus, the 
name of the game may be translated "cane arrows," or "eane arrow pieces" or 
"parts."' 

These "parts" consist of four slips of cane. From the fact that these slips are so 
split and cut from the canes as to include at their lower ends portions of the joints 
or septie of tlie canes, and from the further fact that they are variously banded 
with black or red paint, or otherwise, it may be seen that they represent the foot- 
ings or shfiftments of cane arrows in whicli the septa3 at the lower ends serve as 
stops for the footing or nockiug-plugs. ' 

A study of the bandings by which these cane slips are distinguished from one 
another reveals the very significant fact that they are representative of tlie rib- 
bandings of cane-arrow shaftmenls. 

I have found that sets of Zuni, as well as the ancestral Cliff Dweller arrows, 
were thus ribbauded with black or red paint to symbolize, in the arrows so marked, 
the numerical and successional values of the Four Quarters, each set, especially of 
war arrows, consisting of four subsets, the shaftments of each differently marked. 
The reasons for this, and processes of divination by which the members of the 
different sets among the arrows Avere determined during their manufacture, I have 
set forth iu a paper on "The Arrow," published in the Proceedings of the American 
Association for the Advancement of Science, 1895, and also iu the American Anthro- 
pologist for October of the same year. 

In the second part of that paper, the publication of which was delayed by my 
Florida explorations, I proceeded to show liow these various facts indicated quite 
clearly that the Zuni game of Sho'-U-we was, as its name implied, developed from the 
use of actual arrows for divination; and I further instanced many ceremonial usages 
of simple or ceremonial arrows in such diviuatojy processes as further demonstrating 
this chxim. 

It may be well for me to preface a description of the four cane slips constituting 
the principal apparatus of the game by a statement or two relative to the successional 
numbers of the Four Quarters as conceived in Zuni dramatography. 

The Chief or "Master" region, as well as the first, is the North, designated the 
Yellow; believed to be the source of breath, wind, or the elemeut Air, and the place 
of Winter; hence of violence or war, and therefore Masculine. 

The next or second region is the West, designated the Blue ; believed to be the 
source of moisture or the element Water and the place of Spring, or renewal and 
fertility ; hence of birth, and therefore Feminine. 

The next, or third, is the South, designated as the Red; believed to be the source 

'The canes are split with reference to the notion that one side is masculine or 
north, and the other feminine or south. This is determined by the direction or 
character of the natural growth, as well as by the presence or absence of the leaf 
pocket iu the joint on the one side or the other of that particular section which 
forms the shaftment of the arrow (Gushing). In ancient China, according to the 
Cliow Le (LXII, 37), the arrow maker floated the arrow longitudinally upon water 
to determine the side which corresponded to the principle of inertia and the side 
which corresi)onded with the principle of activity. The former sank, while the 
letter rose. He cut the notch with reference thereto.

of heat oi- the element Fire, and the place of Summer, of yrowtli !in<I jiroductivity ; 
bonce of fostering-, and likewise Feminine. 

The last, ov fonrlh of the earthli/ regions represented in the ordinary slieaf of 
arrows and in the game, is the Flast, designated the White, and believed to be the 
sonrce of seeds and the element Earth, and the place of Antnmn, of new years, and 
hence of creation; therefore Masculine again.' 

These various regions and their numbers and meanings are symbolized oii the 
.•urows of the Four Quarters by differences in their ribbaudings (fig. 110). 

Those of the North were characterized by a single medial ribbanding around the 
shaftmeut, sometimes of yellow, but more usually of black, the color of death.

From a sketch by P>ank Hamilton Gushing. 

Those of the West were also singly ribl)anded coextcnsively with the shaftmeut, 
but there was oftentimes a narrow terminal band at either end of this broad band, 
siMuetimes of blue or green, but usually of black. 

'1 hose of the South were characterized by two bands midway between the two 
ends and the middle, sometimes of red, but usually of black. 

Those of the East were characterized by either two narrow bands at either end 
leaving the whole medial space of the shaftment white, or more often by a single 
band at the upper end of the shaftment, sometimes composed of two narrow black 
fillets inclosing white, but usually merely black and not doubles.

7<S2 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 189fi. 

In the highly finished arrows the cock or "tail" feathers were notched and tufted 
to correspond numerically and positioually with the handings, for mythic reasons 
into which it is not necessary to enter here. 

Each of the four cane slips was handed to correspond with the ribbandings of one 
or another of these sets of the arrows ot the Four Quarters; but the paint bands (fig. 
105} were almost invariably black and were placed in the concavity of the cane slips 
(figs. 106-9), not on the periphery (which was, however, scorched, scored, or carved 
to correspond), evidently to keep the paint from being worn off by handling and 
casting. 

Thus the cane slip of the North was banded only at the middle, antl was called 
d-thlu-a, or the "All Speeder," or "Sender" {A, "all," and thlu-ah, "to run," 
"speed," or "stand ready"). 

The cane slip of the West was blackened its full length and was called Khvi'-vi- 
kwa, or the "Black" (medicine), from Khvi-nd, "black," and ak'-lcioa, "medicine" 
or "sacred." 

The cane slip of the South was doubly banded, as was the arrow of the South, 
and was called _;Kf//)/-/o-«, or "divider divided" ( "bordered, inclosed"), irouxpatld-to, 
" border," "edge," "end," and oa, "to become," "to do," or "make to do." 

Finally, the cane slip of tlie East was banded only at one end, and was called 
Eo'-lia-lwa, the "White,'' or the "White Medicine" {E'ha-na, "white," and alc-kwa, 
"medicine"). 

In addition to the banding and scoring of these cane slips, they were, in cases of 
great importance (as in sets made from the captured arrows of some celebrated foe- 
man), notched at the ends, as I have said the cock feathers were notched; but this 
old practice has fallen into disuse to such extent tliat I have seen only one vener- 
ated set so notched. In this set, if I observed aright, the notches corresponded in 
number as well as in place, whether at sides or in the middle of the ends, with the 
number and positions of the bandings and of the tuftings on the cock feathers 
of the arrows from which, probably, they were made. The normal numerical value 
of the cane slips agreed with the successional values of the regions they belonged 
to — that is, the slip of the North made one; that of the West two; that of the South 
three, and that of the East four. But as this gave unequal values, other values or 
counts were added, according as the slips fell concave or convex sides uppermost, 
and esi)ecially according to the thrower. 

That this may be understood, the general nature of the game as essentially a 
sacred tribal process of divination must be considered. Formerly Sho'-li-icc was 
exclusively a game of war divination, and was played only by Priests of the Bow, 
members of the esoteric society of war shamans. 

These members were, according to their totems and clans, members of the clan 
groups corresponding to the several quarters or sacred precincts of North, West, 
South, East, Upper, Lower, and Middle regions. But since there were only four 
regions concerned in the wage of war, clansmen of the upper and nether regions 
were relegated to the east and west, since the places of the upper and lower regions 
in the sacred diagram were in the Northeast — between the East and North, aud in 
the Southwest — between the West and South; while clansmen of the middle niiglit, 
as determined by the casts of their arrow canes, belong to anyone of the otlier 
regions, since the miihuost was the synthetic region, the all-contaiuing and the all- 
contained place, either the first, therefore, or the last. This war game of the Priests 
of the Bow was played semiannually at the festivals of the Twain Gods of Wav, 
Ahaiyuta and Matsaileraa, patrons of the game by virtue of the vanquishmeiit of 
the Creational God of Gambling, Ml'-si-na, the Eagle-star God, whose forfeited 
head now hangs in the Milky Way, and whose birds are the god-servants of war 
and the plumers of the canes of war. 

It is played at such times as a tribal divination; a forecast for war or peace, for 
prosperity or adversity, and is accouipanied by tribal hazards and gambling. But 
at other times it is played for the determination of i)eace or war, of the direction or

precautions to be taken in defensive or offensive operations or preparations. Astlins 
jilayed, there must be foui- participants. Each possesses his own canes. In the 
uppermost room of the Pueblo (now fallen), there was formerly a shrine of the game. 
Here during terrific sand storms or at night the players gathered to divine. To 
the middle of the ceiling was suspended a jical or large round bowl-basket, over 
which a deerskin was stretched like a drumhead. Immediately below this, spread 
over a sacred diagram of prayer meal representing the terrace or cloud bed of the 
Four Quarters, on the floor, was a Imiit'alo robe, pelt side up, head to the east, left side 
to the north, etc. (fig. 104). Upon this pelt a broken circle was traced either in 
))lack lines or dots, and with or without grains of corn (forty for each line, the colors 
corresponding to the (jnarters as above described), and the openings (canyons or 
passngeways) occurring at the fonr i)oiiits opposite the four directions. (It should 
be observed that a cross (+) was sometimes painted both on the center of the skin 
on the basket drum and on the hidi; beneath, the upper symbolic of Ahaiyuta, and 
the lower of M^itsailema, the Twin War Gods.) 

The fovir players chose their places according to the clan groups and directions 
or quarters they represented : the player of the North between the eastern and 
northern passageway; the player of the West between the northern and western 
passageway, and so on. The players of the East and North represented war, and (in 
other modes of the game) masculinity; those of the West and South, peace and 
femininity.

Before taking their places they muttered prayers, or rather rituals, clasping the 
playing canes lengthwise between the x>alms, breathing deeply, and from the close 
of the prayers, repeatedly upon them, rubbing and shuffling them vigorously, from 
which comes the title of a skilled player or a gambler: shos-li, "cane rubber" or 
"cane shufHer." As they took their seats, each ])laced under the edge of the buti'alo 
hide in front of his place the pool, consisting of sacre.I white shell beads, or of little 
tablets representative of various properties and thus forming a kind of currency, since 
these little symbols were redeemable in the properties they represented or in commod- 
ities of e(iual value by agreement. Each also laid down at his right side (m the edges 
of the robe over the pool two kinds of counfers, usually a set of counting straws of 
broom grass, about six or seven inches long, worn by much use, and varying in num- 
ber according to the proposed game. From ten to forty or forty-two, or from one 
hundred to one hundred and two (this latter divided at random into fonr Imndles), 
was selected by each player. The additional counters were supplied by beans or 
corn grains, each set, or the set of each player, being of his ajjpropriate color. Four 
splints, the moving pieces of the game, were laid in their places by the left sides 
of the passageways.

Each player then shuttled his cane < anls back and forth in his palms as before de-

cast them skillfully against the stretched skin of the basket, so that they rebounded 
swiftly and fell almost unerringly within the circle on the j^y'ioiwe or bed of buffalo 
hide. Now it was noted which slip lay uppermost over the others. If the White 
man threw, and if the white stick lay uppermost over all the others, he uttered

thanks and the cast counted him fonr and gave him the privilege of another cast. 
If, moreover, all three slips (except his sender) lay concave sides upward, they 
counted him ten and gave him a second additional throw. If all three fell convex 
side up, they counted him five. If two concave sides and one convex side up, they 
connted him three, and if two convex sides and one concave side up they counted 
him only one. The player who had the largest number of both kinds of counts after 
each had tried, led off in the game and was supposed to be favored by the gods at 
the beginning. With but a slight change in the system of the counting, the game 
was continued; that is, the double counts were kept if the process included gam- 
bling — that is, "willingness to 8a( rifice" — but only tln^ counts according to the re- 
gions, if the game was purely an arrow or war divination. But it is to be noted that 
in either case an ingenious method was resorted to in order to equalize the counts. 
Since the North or Yellow man could gain only one and a double throw if his slip

came uppermost, ho gaiiuul the count of his opponent of the South, if his slip, the 

slip of the North, fell uppermost on the Ked man's slips. 

The latter thus forfeited alike his double throw and his 

appropriate number, three. The tally of these purely cos- 

mical counts was kept with the bundle of splints; the tally 

of the cast-counts or their sums were kept with the grains 

by counting out, and that of the individual by moving the 

pointer of the passageway as many dots or grain-places to 

the left as the cast called for. If a player of the East or 

North overtook a player of the West or South, if his ])ointer 

fell in the same space, lie maimed his op])oneiit — sent him 

back to his passageway —and robbed him of his load ; that 

is, took or made him forfeit his counts. 

The completion of the fourth circuit by any one of the 
players closes the ordinary game, providing the sum of the 
cosmical counts had been won by him, and the player who, 
with his ijartner, had the largest aggregate of both lot and 
cosmical counts was the winner. 

There were many variants of this game as to counts. 
Some of these were so complifated that it was absolutely 
impossible for me to gain knowledge of them in the short 
practice I had in the play. I have given here, not very 
jirecisely or fully, the simplest form I know, excci)t that 
of the lot and diagram, which was quite like that of Ta' 
sho'-Ji-toe (or wood canes), which may be seen by the above 
description to be an obvious derivative both in mode and 
name of the older game of "canes." It was evidently thus 
divorced for purposes of exoteric play, as it is practiced not 
only by men but also by women. 

Fig. 112 represents the obverse of a set of Zuni 
canes for Slio'-li-we reproduced iroin memory by 
Mr. Cnsbing for the writei' in the summer of 1S93. 
It will be observed that the a'-ihhi-a, the ujjper- 
niost cane in tig, 1 12, corresponding with the north, 
is marked on the convex side with a cross, agree- 
ing directly in this respect with one of the sticks 
in the Tewan game (fig. 88). This ijecnliarity, in 
one form or another, is repeated thronghoiit almost 
the entire series of implements described, the ob- 
veise of one of the sticks in many of the sets being 
carved or burned, while in others one of the staves 
is tied about the middle. In attempting to ac- 
count for this it occurred to the writer to compare 
the Znni stick beaiing the cross mark with an 
atlall or throwing stick (tig. 113) from a Cliff dwell- 
ing in Mancos Canyon, Colorado, in the Univer- 
sity of Pennsylvania Museum. 

Mr. Cushing had alrt'iuly suggested to me that 
the a'-thlu-a, placed beneath the others in throwing 
corresponded with the atlatl. The comparison 
contirmed his suggestions. The cross mark is clearly the cross wiap-

liino- of the atlatl (fig. 114) for the attachment of finger loops. In the 
opinion of the writer, the Zufii canes may be regarded as symbolic of 
the atlatl and three arrows, such as are seen carried by the gods in

Mexican i)ictures. From the evidence afforded by the implements 
employed, the games with tossed canes, staves, etc., I conclude that 
they must all be referred to the region of cane arrows and the atlatl, 
probably Mexico and the southwestern United States. 

A summary of the games described in the j (receding pages is con- 
tained in the following tables. The games of this class 1 have found 
recorded as existing among some sixty-one tribes, comprised in twenty- 
three linguistic stocks, described or collected by some seventy-five 
observers, extending trom the year 1034 down to the present, and rep- 
resented by some ninety specimens from forty-one tribes, eighteen 
stocks, and thirty-nine collectors in the five principal American muse- 
ums of ethnology: Washington, New York, Chicago, Cambridge, and 
Philadelphia, and the hands of five individuals. The older accounts 
of the game among the Indians of Mexico are not included in this 
enumeration.

800 REPORT OF NATIONAl^ MUSEUM, 1896. 

In the summer of 1896, Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, while engaged in 
explorations for the Bureau of American Ethnology, found several 
ancient split reeds marked in a similar manner to those used in the 
Zuni game of ^ho'-U-we. These reeds, represented in plate 15, were dug 
up by him at the Cherlon ruin, near where the Cherlon Fork empties 
into the Little Colorado, about 15 miles east of Winslow, Arizona. He 
writes : 

I have uo means of knowing how old Cherlon ruin is, but very old — no white roan's 
objects wt^re unearthed there. There were settlements in the vicinity as late as 1700. 
This may have been one, btit I judge from the ruin and legends that it was much 
older. The ruin of Cherlon, like many on the banks of the Little Colorado, shows 
resemblances to ruins on Zufii River, and no doubt has relations with them. Tbe 
Southern Hoj)! clans claim them, and I fancy both Zuni and Moki are related to tbe 
clans of Cakwabayfi, "Blue Running Water House." 

I am indebted to Mr. Wells M. Sawyer, of the Bureau of American 
Ethnology, for the careful drawing (Plate 15) showing the marks on the 
reeds. One reed is apparently without marks on the exterior, and of 
the four others two have the same marks, from which the writer infers 
that they form part of at least two original sets. During the same

season's work. Dr. Fewkes excavated a bowl (Cat. Xo. 157735, IT.S.:t^.M.) 
from the old ruin of Cunopavi containing a symbolic pictograph of a 
bird, and a representation of the four reed or stave casts (Plate 10). 
This bowl was dug up from the old cemetery. Old Cunopavi, or Shi- 
mopavi, as it is commonly written, he informs me, was inhabited in 1540, 
and the peo]>le moved to the present site about the end of the seven- 
teenth century. '"The bowl is of the same ware as the prehistoric 
pottery of Tusayan, and I think it older than 1540, but that is not 
proven. The bird is Kwataka, ' Eagle Man/> an old crony of gamblers." 

Additional evidence of the antiquity of the stave game in North 
America is afforded by a prehistoric stave of cotton wood (fig. 115), 
(Mus. Arch., Univ. Penn.), tied at one end with sinew to prevent its 
splitting, and practically identical with the Navajo staves of cotton 
wood (Cat. No. 9557, U.S.N.M.), which was found by the Wetherill 
Brothers in a prehistoric Cliff dwelling in Mancos Canyon, Colorado. 

In ancient Mexico, among the cultivated Aztecs, we find mention of 
the "game of the canes" under the names (»f cauallopan -AxnX nemimimi-

Iktli in Molina's dictiouary. Dr. Brinton informs me that the com- 
bination canaUopan nemiminaliztU is defined by E. Simeon, in his 
Bicfionnuue de la langue Naifhuatl, as "playing with horses." Again 
Molino gives ne!jay(wtlaliztU = ^'}i\ego de canas, o escaramu^a" (skir- 
mish) and juegos de pelea {wiir)==neyayaotlaliztii. 

A reference to the cane game is to be found in Torquemada.' Speak- 
ing of the ceremonies in honor of Tlaloc- he says: 

The day on which they held feast to these gods was in the sixth month, whicli cor- 
responds to our June. On this day they cleansed all cisterns and water conduits and 
played with green maize stalks. 

Again, in the " Hymn of Tlaloc" ' occurs the passage: 

In Tlalocan, in the verdant house, they play at ball, they cast the reeds. 

Duran ^ (somewhat confusedly) describes a game with tossed canes 
as follows : 

There was another game, which was that they made on a plaster floor little hollows 
after the manner of afortuna (wheel of fortune?), and one took ten jjebbles and the 
other ten others, and the one placing his pebbles ou the one edge and the other on 
the other ou contrary sides, and taking some reeds split down the middle they 
threw them on the ground so that they sprang up, and as many reeds as fell with 
the hollow side upward so many ''houses" he moved his pebbles forward, and thus 
oue such followed the other, and all pebbles as he overtook, he went on taking 
away until he left his adversary without any.' (The meaning of the clause that fol- 
lows is not clear.) 

The game of Patolli (No. 39) by which we now generally understand 
the game played witli marked beans instead of canes or staves, upon 
a cross shaped diagram, is probably a derived form of the cane game, 
the use of beans being paralleled at the presentday among the Cherokee 
(see p. 720). The word was a general name for games and was also 
applied to the " dice," by which they were counted. Ribas uses it in 
that sense in the account which lollows, referring to the Indians of 
Sinaloa: 

The game that they call of the Patolli is very common among them and corre- 
sponds to that of cards or dice, because in place of them they use certain four small

figures and points which give them their value or loss. When they play they throw 
these down, casting them upon a small stone in order that they may rebotiud and 
fall with their points at random, and he who plays wins or loses, marking on the 
earth the points which gain until the number is reached of the wager which those 
present have made. This wager is of beads of shells of the sea which they esteem 
and with which they adorn themselves. Wagers are also made of bows, or arrows, 
or knives, articles they obtain; and of the same character are their wagers in other 
games. '

CHESS AND PLAYING-CARDS. 803 

In searching for remains of the cane game in old Mexico, the writer 
was deeply impressed witli the mauy points of resemblance between the 
gaming circuit as described by Mr. Cashing as used in Sho'-li-u-e, and 
some of the diagrammatic paintings in the codices, leading him to the 
conclusion that the purpose of the latter was identical. As an illustra- 
tion, the figure from the Fcjervary codex (Plate 17) may be regarded as 
a divinatory, calendrical counting circuit, the forty beans or corn of 
four colors of the Zuui Sho' U-ire having their ccmnterparts in the four 
colored arms of the cross — red, yellow, blue, and green — marked with 
small circles. Again the entire design of the Mexican figure will be 
seen to represent an animal or the hide of an animal, comparable with 
the buffalo hide of the Zuiii game. In the center of the Mexican

picture is a figure of a warrior god or priest, armed with atlatl and 
darts, corresponding to the cross, symbolic of the twin war god of the 
Zuni circuit. The scheme of the plate from Prof. Cyrus Thomas's 
Notes on certain Maya and Mexican Manuscripts' is added (fig. 116) to 
facilitate comparison. 

From Soutli America the following sets of implements have been 
collected :

Three sticks roughly whittled from small twigs (tig. 117). Two of 

them 3| inches in length, J inch wide, and about ^ inch thick, slightly

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 



plain. The third stick is about 3^ inches in length, made of another 
wood, and possibly belongs to another set. Collected by Dr. Emil 
Hassler. Dr. Hassler informed the writer that they are tossed in the 

air and if three round sides fall upper- 
most they gain. "The sticks must fall 
parallel." 

Referring to the Toba, Cardus' says: 

Their i)rincipal game consists in raising and 
letting fall to the ground some small pieces of 
sjjlit reed with much shouting ; the object of the 
shouting, on one side, that the pieces may fall 
well, and on the other that they njay fall badly. 
The stakes are usually a horse, a cow, a slave, a 
sheep, or a poncho. 

Another set of similar gambling in- 
struments froui the Indians of the Grand 
Chaco are represented in fig. 118. They 
were exhibited by Dr. Hassler in his 
collection at the Columbian Exposi- 
tion, but unfortunately can not now be 
found in the Field Columbian Museum, 
to which the collection was transferred. 
The two large bones are tossed, their 
falls determining the count, which is 
recorded by means of the small radial 
bones that are strung upon the cord. 
The men who play this game carry the 
implements suspended from their wrist.^ 
The games above described led the 
writer to make a particularly careful 
search for objects that might have served 
for gaming implements in collections 
from ancient Peru. In the collection 
made by Dr. Max Uhle, at Pachaca- 
mac, for the University of Pennsylvania, now in its Museum, are a 
number of narrow, flat tablets of hard wood that might possibly have 
been used as gaming staves. The same conjecture might be hazarded 
with reference to six slips of cane (Cat. No. 28393) found together on a 
mummy in the first cemetery. These slips, which are 4 inches in length 
by about ^ inch in width, are wound with colored thread, black, yellow,

-I tind the following reference to games of this type among the South American 
Indians: Molina (History of Chili, II, p. 9), in describing the games of the Araucan- 
ians, says, "the game of quechx, which they esteem highly, has a great affinity to

William Bollaert' describes a game of the Aymara Indians under the 
name of ^xisa. 

It is one of great antiquity, and seems to be the only one of this sort. Pasu 
means a hundred, as he wins who tirst gets that number. They play it with two 
instruments, one a spread eagle of wood with ten holes on each side, being tens, 
and are marked with pegs to denote every man's gettings; the other is a bone in the 
manner of a die, cut with seven faces, one of which has a particular mark called 
guat/aro {hntjaru). The other live tell according to the number of them, and the last 
18 a blank. The way of playing is to toss up the bone, and the marks on the upper 
surface are so many got. But the guayro goes for ten, and the like number is lost 
if the blank side appearts. - 

Von Tschudi' describes the following game: 

Pitska, a game with small sticks which were marked with stripes of different 
colors. It was generally played during the night of the death watch. Villagomez 
believes that its name is derived from Pitska, the number "five" because of the five 
fast days following the night of the death watch, a view which I do not accept. 
Holguin mentions the game PUnka, and refers to Pitskana as a six-sided piece of 
wood or small stick with which the game is played, only we do not know how it 
was done but probably in a similar way to the game of dice. In Aymara its name 
is also Phiska.

Board, staves,^ aud meu. A game played upon a board divided into 
rows of squares, with pieces or men, which are moved according to the 
throws with four staves (fig. 119). 

The board, called a .seega (fig. 120), is divided into four rows of squares 
called beyts (houses) each about 2 inches wide, or it consists of similar 
rows of holes made in the ground or in a flat stone. The beyts are 
usually seveu, nine, eleven, thirteen, or fifteen in each row. In each 
heyt of one exterior row is placed a little piece of stone or dingy brick 
about the size of a walnut, and in each beyt of the other exterior row 
a -piece of red brick or tile, or sometimes pieces are placed ia only

The name of the board in this game, seega, appears to be an Araba- 
cized form of the Indian word saj, "teak." According to native lexi- 
cographers it is applied to wood, black and heavy and made in pieces 
of oblong form or squared, brought from India. In the sense of board 
it was originally applied to the tablet made of sqj wood. The name 
given to the men, "dogs," is the same as that applied to the men in the 
game of Kawade lelia (Ko. 37) iu Oeylon. These facts would seem to

small pieces, which, distinguished by certain marks, are thrown pro- 
miscuously upon a white garment. Then the priest of the canton, if 
the occasion be public (if private, the master of the family), after an 
invocation of the gods, with his eyes lifted up to heaven, thrice takes 
out each piece, and, as they come up, interprets their signification 
according to the marks fixed upon them. If the result prove unfavor- 
able, there is no more consultation upon the same affair that day; if 
propitious, a consultation by omens is still required." 

More closely resembling the practices described in the text is the 
German method of divination as related by Saxo-Grammaticus^ of 
the inhabitants of the Isle of Rugen, in the Baltic Sea: 

Throwing, by way of lots, three pieces of wood, white in one part and black in 
another, into their laps, they foretold good fortune by the foming up of the white; 
bad by that of the black.

The reference in Herodotus- to divination among the Scytihians, in 
which large bundles of rods were used, seems to refer to the class of 
divinatory rites that will be treated in the second part of this paper. 

Lenormand^ states that the Magi foretold the future by throwing 
little sticks of tamarisk wood. The authoiity which he cites ^ makes 
no specific mention of any such performance, but merely says that the 
"Magi and Scythians prophesy with staves {ligno); and in many places 
l^rophesyiiig tbey use twigs [virgi.s). Dinon says that the Median 
magi also prophesy by twigs {virga).^^ Dinon no doubt referred to the 
baresma, of which mention is also made by Strabo.'^ 

The baresma (now called barsom) was a bundle of sacred twigs which 
the priest held in his hands while reciting the prayers (Plate 18). They 
were formerly twigs of the pomegranate, date, or tamarind tree, or any 
tree that had no thorns, and were plucked with peculiar ceremonies 
which alone made them fit to be used for liturgic purposes.^

Leuormaud declares that the bares)iia originated in a bundle of divin- 
ing wands, such as were thrown in Chaldea and Babylonia. Madam 
Ragozin/ following the same line of comparison, points out the resem- 
blance between the haresma (fig. 123) and a peculiar object (flg. 124) 
which frequently recurs deposited upon the altar in Assyrian scenes of 
worship and sacrifice. "The use of it, or the nature, has never yet 
been explained ; but on close inspection it looks extremely like a bundle 
of twigs, uneven in number, tied together 
with a ribbon. Is it not likely that it may 
represent the sacred divining rods and be 
the original of the Avestan haresma .^"

and he furnishes me with the following reference: 

Hang's Essays on the Parsis, p. 397 (third edition, by E. W. West), says: 

"The harsom consists of a number of slender rods or fdJ, formerly twigs of some 
particular trees, but now thin metal wires are generally U8e<l. The number of these

especially practiced) the Emperor collected the five kinds of scepters, and at the

Hi (fig. 127), one sees on the scepter of this name four masses of rock 
whicli represent the monntaius.' Prom the explanation given by the 
commentator it would appear that the great scepter, tdi kwai, was 
wrapped with cords of five colors. 

The Icwai are not to be confounded with the tablets called fat (Jap- 
anese, shalcu),' -which were used at audiences in former times, nor with 
the scepters, H i (jii i ; Japanese, n'ujoi) given in China at marriage and 
to friends for good luck, and carried in Japan by certain priests'' (fig. 
130). 

Among the Ainu, in Japan, the men use carved wooden staves to lift 
their mustache in drinking sake. These staves, which they call ikonit,'^ 
are commonly known from their present use as " mustache-sticks." They 
are about 14 inches in length, flat on one side, and rounded upon the 
other, which is more or less elaborately carved.^ 

An examination of the twelve specimens in the U. S. National Museum 
(Plates 19-22) shows a general resemblance to the staves which are tossed 
in gaming. The flat reverses are nearly all scratched with what were 
scarcely discernible marks, represented in plates 20 and 22. The writer 
concludes that these "mustache-sticks" were once emblems of rank or 
authority. 

The only existing objects of remote antiquity with which I am ac- 
quainted outside of America that might have been used as divinatory 
implements in the manner of the staves are a set of ivory rods, dis- 
covered by Prof. Flinders Petrie in Egypt, part of which are now in the 
Museum of Archtieology of the University of Pennsylvania. 

They constitute a portion of the find made by Professor Petrie in 1895

^Of the specimens iUustrated fig. 128 represents a Chinese tablet scepter in tlie 
University Museum. It forms an accessory of a Cliinese tlieatrical costume of a 
noble of the imperial court and is made of wood, painted brown and varnished, in- 
stead of ivory. This scepter is slightly bent, 20 inches in length, about i inch 
thick, and tapers from 2 inches wide at the base to If inch at the top. The .s7/aA;«

the statue of the Baron Li, said to have been one actually used by that illustrious

'The a i, literally *'as you wish," is of Buddhistic origin, and is one of the Sajita

In Japan it is carried by the chief priests of the Zen sect, and is used by them to 
administer a blow to tlie catechunu^u when he fails to answer correctly. Its origin 
presents an interesting problem, its form suggesting that of the tlirowing-stick. 
The fat or shalu are wooden tablets, said to have been originally used for noting 
memoianda.

'Speaking of the natives of the Zambezi, the Livingstones (David and Charles 
Livingstone, Narrative of an Expedition to the Zambezi, London, 1865, p. 51) say : 

The dice doctor or diviner is an important member of the community being, 
consulted by Portuguese and natives alike. Part of his business is that of a detect- 
ive, it being his duty to discover thieves. When goods are stolen he goes and looks 
at the place, casts his dice, and waits for a few days, and then, for a consideration, 
tells who is the thief. 

Referring to the Guinea negroes, Bosman (William Bosnian, A New and Accurate 
Description of the Coast of Guinea, translated in Pinkerton's Voyages, London, 1814, 
XVI, p. 399) says: 

The second w;iy of consulting their idols is by a sort of wild nuts, which they 
pretend to take up by guess and let fall again, after which they tell them, and form 
their predictions from the numbers falling even or odd. 

Specimens of pierced cowrie shells used in fortune-telling from the Liberian 
exhibit at the Columbian Exposition are shown in iig. 134. These objects are now 
in the I'hiladelphia Commercial Museum. 

The negroes of the French West Indies, according to Labat (Nouveau Voyage aux 
Isles de I'Amerique, Paris, 1724, IV, p. 153), play a game with cowries. He says: The 
game which they play in their country, and which they have also carried to the 
islands, is a sort of game of dice. It is composed of four bougcs or shells, which are 
used by them as money. They have a hole purposely made in the convex side, so 
that they will stand as easily on one side as on the other. They shake them up in 
their hand as one shakes dice and throw them on a table. If all the sides with 
holes in them fall uppermost, or the opposite sides of two fall in the same manner 
and two in the opposite way, the player wins; but if the number of the holes is odd, 
he loses. 

In the Streets of Cairo at the Columbian Exposition was a family of Bishareen 
Soudanese, living near Assoium, on the Nile, whose head was a dervish belonging to 
a local order, who practiced soothsaying with cowries (Dr. Talcott Williams). This 
man threw several cowrie shells, and made his jirediction from the manner in which 
they fell. The cowrie shells correspond with the staves referred to by Bent, and 
are possibly substitutes for staves, as the writer also infers may be the case with 
similar shells in the Hindu game of Pac/ris/, No. 38.

manner in which the majority (which must be a considerable one) of the

At the pivsciit (lay the Hottentot children cast lots by twigs — that is, if a tiling 
is lost or a theft has been committed, they throw bits of stick and judge of the cul- 
prit, or of the direction wherein the lost property is to be found, by the arrangement 
of twigs, and among the KafBrs bundles of sticks and assagais are employed by 
diviners in their rites for the discovery of crime.' 

Eeferriiig to the Melanesians, Codriiig^tou^ says: 

A game which belongs to the Banks Islands and New Helu'ides is lihit, the Fiji 
tiqitd, played with reeds dashed in such a manner upon the grouncj. that they rise in 
the air and fly to a considerable distance. In some islands, as Santa Maria, a string 
is used to give impetus, and in some the reed is thrown also from the foot. The 
game is played by two parties, who count pigs for the farthest casts, the numl)er of 
pigs counted as gained depending on the number of knots in the winning fika. 
When two villages engage in a match, they sometimes come to blows. There are 
marks on the tika to show to whom 
they belonged. It is remarkable that 

in Mota a decimal set of numerals is mmiFjmym 

used in this game, distinct from tlie / U^BJ^ ri^Mh 

quinary set used on every other occa- 
sion of counting. 

In New y^ealand, according 
to Taylor, ' tlie natives had a 
way of divination by means of 
sticks. This was called Xiu.* 
Each chief had a i)articalar 
name for his own stick; thus, 
that of one chief was called Tc 
ata niouHu; that of another, Te 
inanu i te ra; and that of a 
third, Tonga hiti. The person 
consultiua; the Niu went out in 
the morning before it was light, 
so that no one should have been 

out before him, which would destroy tlie power of consultation, and 
taking his stick, a short, thin one made of the mahoe, in his right hand, 
and another representing the enemy in his left, he went and stu(;k 
anothei' in the ground; this represented the tdpn; and placing the two 
sticks together, one across the other, he uttered a larakia, and then 
threw them in front of a third stick, and it was according to their posi- 
tion that the consulter ascertained whether anyone was traveling on

tlie road, whether they are friends or foes, and, if the latter, Avhether 
they would be conquered or not.^ 

Diftereut tribes had different ways of consulting the Niu, but the practice was 
general throughout the land. A spirit called Eorohaha Tu was supposed to reside 
in the stick.- 

This manner of divination finds an almost exact parallel in that 
described by Marco Polo as being resorted to by Chinghis Kaan.-' 

So when the two great hosts were pitched on the plains of Tanduc as you have 
heard, Chinghis Kaan one day summoned before him his astrologers, both Christians 
and Saracens, and desired them to let him know which of the two hosts would gain 
the battle — his own or Prester .John's. The Saracens tried to ascertain, but were 
unable to give a true answer; the Christians, however, did give a true answer, and 
showed manifestly beforehand how the event should be. For they got a cane and 
split it lengthwise, and laid one-half on this side and one-half on tbat, allowing no 
one to touch the pieces. And one piece of cane they called Chinghis Kaan and the 
other piece they calle.i. Prester Joh)i. And then they said to Chinghis: 'Now mark; 
and you will see the eA-ent of the battle, and who shall have the best of it; for 
whose cane soever shall get above the other, to him the victory shall be.' Then the 
Christian astrologers read a Psalm out of the Psalter, and went through other incan- 
tations. And lo ! whilst all were beholding, the cane that bore the name of Chinghis 
Kaan, withonJ being touched by anybody, advanced to the other that bore the name 
of Prester John and got on top of it. 

Colonel Yule has collected a number of references to similar divinatory 
processes, of which the following appear to belong to the same class: 

The words of Hosea (iv, 12), 'My people ask counsel at their stocks and their 
staff declareth unto them,' are thus explained by Theophylactus: 'They stuck up a 
couple of .sticks, whilst murmuring certain charms and incantations; the sticks 
then, by the operation of devils, direct or indirect, would fall over, and the direc- 
tion of their fall was noted,' etc. Rubruquis seems to have witnessed nearly the 
same process that Polo describes. Visiting Lady Kuktai, a Christian queen of 
Mangu Kaan, who Avas ill, he says: 'The Nestorians were repeating certain verses, 
I know not what (they said it was part of a Psalm), over two twigs which were 
brought into contact in the hands of two men. The monk stood during the opera- 
tion.' Petis de la Croix quotes from Thevenot's travels a similar mode of divina- 
tion as much used, before a fight, among the Barbary corsairs. Two men sit on the 
deck facing one another, and each holding two arrows by the points, and hitching 
the notches of each pair of arrows into the other pair. Then the ship's writer reads 
a certain Arabic formula, and it is pretended that, whilst this goes on the two sets 
of arrows, of which one represents the Turks and the other the Christians, struggle 
together in spite of the resistance of the holders, and finally one rises over the 

' If the stick representing his tribe fell above the other, it was a favorable sign ; 
if below, a bad one. 

-The following parallel custom exists among the Tsuishikari Ainu, as described to 
J. M. Dixon in the work cited: "A man in the tribe, desirous to know the will of 
the Deity regarding a cerlaiu matter, called in the aid of the tiinuriiini (magician- 
doctor). He came at night with two fresh willow (siisu) wands, stripped of the 
bark, which he placed on a mat by the hearth. Tlien he called upon the unjila-mui 
(Fire-god) to declare his will. Soon the footsteps of the god were heard; they came 
up to the side of the tiisiiguru; the wands showed signs of restlessness and struck 
the mat on which they were placed. Two raps signified permission; a scraping or 
rubbing was an unfavorable augury."

other. P. Delia Valle (II, 865-866) describes the same process, conducted bya Moham- 
medan conjuror of Aleppo: 'By his incantations he made the four points of the arrows 
come together without any movement of the holders, and by tlie way the points 
spontaneously placed themselves, obtained answers to interrogatories.' And Mr. 
.Jaeshke writes from Tjahaul : 'There are many different ways of divination practiced 
among the Buddhists ; and that also mentioned by Marco Polo is known to our Lama, 
but in a slightly different way, making use of two arrows, instead of a cane split up, 
wherefore this kind is called da-mo (arrow divination).' Indeed, the practice is not 
extinct in India, for in 1833 Mr. Vigne (I, 46) witnessed its application to detect the 
robber of a government chest at Lodiana. 

It will be observed that in three of the examples the sticks or twigs 
are replaced by arrows.

PEBBLES FROM MAS D'AZU,. 



In concluding tliis examination, reference should be made to the sug- 
gestion by Col, Garrick Mallery' that the colored pebbles found in the 
grotto of Mas d'Azil, in the department of Ariege, France, were used in 
gaining. 

Only one face of these pebbles bears a design (tig. 135). Colonel Mal- 
lery says : 

To an observer familiar with the gambling games of the North American Indians, 
in which marked plum-stones and similar objects are employed, these stained flat 
pebbles at once suggest their use to suggest values in a game by the several designs 
and by the pebbles falling on the figureil or on the unmarked side.-

820 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

C. Shinci Kun T'o. "The Game of the Promotion of Officials." Can- 
ton, China. 

iJoard ' and Dice.'^ A celebrated Chinese game, best known through 
Dr. Hyde's account as "the Game of the Promotion of Mandarins," 
played by two or more persons upon a large paper diagram, upon which 
are printed the titles of the ditterent officials under tlie Chinese Gov- 
ernment. Four dice are thrown, and the players advance through the 
various grades according to tlieir throws.' 

This complicated game may be regarded as a modification of the Nyout 
circuit, the dice replacing the staves. Its line of descent is indicated 
by the corresponding Korean game, which follows.

one to five, is employed, in- 
stead of cnbical dice. 

I regard the use of this 

die as older than that of 

cubical dice, and the die 

itself to have been derived 

from the four staves, such

The diagram for the game in the University Museum (Cat. No. 17026) 
is written in Chinese (characters upon a sheet of white Korean i)aper

(9 by 12) rectangles, in each one of which is the title of a Korean official, 
with the indication beneath it for the next move, acccordingly as the 
throw is from one up to five. Another Korean game (Oat. No. 17699) in 
the same museum, i)layed in the same manner with the same kind of die 
upon a sheet of pai)er of the same size, is entitled Xam-seung-to (Chi-

wliicli are written tlie iiaincs of |>lac(!S throiigiioiit Korea fauioiis for 

beauty of scenery,' Still auothei' Ivoreau game (Cat. No. 17G28) of This 

type in tlie University Museum is known as the "Monk's tjyoiig-~kye)i(/-to,'^ 

and is intended for the purpose of giving instruction in 

the religion of Buddhism. The sheet, which measures 

about IL* inches S(juare, is inscribed with a diagram, the 

inner part of which is divided into one hundred and 

sixty-nine sipuires (13 by 13). These contain the names 

of the various conditions of exi.stence, advancing from 

the lowest forms through the eighteen Brahmalokas, to 

the goal, which is Nirvana. 

It is, in fact, a Buddhist game of Promotion. The 
moves are made according to the throws with three 
small Avooden dice (flg. 1 i8), each inscribed on its six 
sides with the magic formula: J^Tdin mo o ni fo fat 
{Namah Amituhha). Under each name 
is written the place of the next move, 
according to the throw. The name 
at the top of the sheet is in Sanskrit 
characters, which are also Avritten on seven of the 
squares, while the remainder of the text is in Chinese.^ 
An interesting parallel to this game is to be found 
in the French Jeu Moral et Instrnctif, 
the goal of which is Paradise. 

This last described Korean game 
suggests a likely explanation of certain 
Tibetan divination tables figured by 
Schlagintweit.' 
One of these ( I'late 25) forms part of a great roll in- 
scribed with other divinatory diagrams. It is divided 
into squares, of which those in the upper corners, left 
and right, bear, respectively, pictures .of the Bodhi- 
sattva Manjusri, and the sword of wisdom, the emblem 
of his knowledge. Of tlie remaining sixty squares one- 
half 4ire inscribed with religious emblems and the 
others, placed immediately beneath, with Tibetan words 
which in greater part were illegible. The assumption 
that the diagram is intended for a divinatory game, 
like the Korean Buddhist game above referred to, is supported by 
much corroborative evidence. Thus, on page 320 we find the following 

' For which the Koreans have a passion, making excursious for the sake of tlie 
scenery to celebrated sites. 

-That is, Chinese trauscripti<iiis iiiul explanations of the Sanskrit names. A 
detailed aecount of the game is being prepared by the writer.

This implement has its counterpart in the East In- 
dian chuh'ee, which is used in a similar game played 
on a diagram marked like six faces of a die. The 
cJmJxTee is said to be used only at the Divali Festival, 
which occurs in ^November, when gambling is per- 
mitted. A parallel is seen in the four-sided teetotum, 
which Jewish children in Germanj^ and Russia play 
with during the eight days at Purim, or the Feast of Lots. This 
die (fig. 140) bears upon its sides the Hebrew letters: shin, nun, he, 
gimel. They are playfully regarded as standing for the German words 
stell, "i)ut;" nichts, "nothing;" halb, "half;" f/anz^ "all." Prof. Leo 
Weiner informs me that the letters are in- 
tended for the phrase : sham nes hdyd gddol, 
" there wonder great has happened." Prof. 
Weiner writes: 

The name of the wiirfel is dredl (draidle), which is 
a dimiuutive of dreher, turner, twister. This latter 
word is used exclusively for the turning rattle of 
wood or metal used on the same holiday, as the chil- 
dren say, "to turn Haman," i. e., to drown him, or 
disgrace him in the noise. The manner of making 
is as follows: A block of wood, geuerally a round 
stick or jiart of a twig, is cut lengthwise into four 
parts ; the inner edges are shaved off to admit the 
molti n lead which thus forms the stem of the drcdl. 

The form of the dredl, with its letters on each face, is cut on the flat sides of each 
part ; then the four parts are put together, after being tied with a cord and are 
placed in sand or into the ground, and the metal is poured into the mould,

the marks scored on the instrument, not unlike the bars of a gridiron on which the 
saint perished.

of this instrument.

-On the Hradischt near Stradonitz in Bohemia, which is referred to La Tene 
period, several hundred longisii stick-dice, niarlvcd with .concentric circles (dice 
eyes), were found (fig. 147). Of the four longer faces, two opposite ones are broader 
than the two others. The ends are plain, while the long sides are marked three, 
four, five, six, so that the broader faces have three, four, and the narrower ones 
five, six. (Osborne in Mitteil. des Anthropol. Ges., Wieii, X, p. 2r)o, quoted from Eth-

and Danish finds tiu-se stick-dice also appear. These latter are similar to those of 
Hradischt, but are to l)e distinguished from them, however, l)y the markings, as 
they mostly only have the spots on the three long sides (with the numbers three, four, 
and six), leaving the fourth side unmarked. He continues that, after numerous in-

Greeks and Romans numerical values were attributed to the four long 
sides, the two pointed ends not being counted. The two broad sides, 
respectively convex and concave, counted three and four, while of the 
narrow sides, the Hat counted one and the indented six. The numbers 
two and live were wanting.' 

Several names, both Greek and Latin, are recorded for each of the 
throws. 

Two persons played together at this game, using four bones, which they threw 
into the air, or emptied out of a dieebox ( fritilliis) . The numbers on the four sides 
of the four bones admitted of thirty-five different combinations. The lowest throw 
oi" all was four aces, but the value of a throw was not in all cases the sum of the

four numbers turned up. The highest in value was that called Venus, iu which the 
numbers cast up were all different. Certain other throws were called by particular 
names, taken from gods, illustrious men and women, and heroes. These bones, 
marked and thrown as above described, were also used in divination.' 

Among the Turks, Arabs, Persians, the four throws with a single 
knuckle bone receive the names of the four ranks of human society. 
Thus, among the Persians, according to Dr. Hyde, they were called as 
follows :^

The Arabic luime for tlic bones is kdh ((Uiiib hihatain, plural, h(bat), 
meaning "ankle,'' referring- to their source. Two bones are now com- 
monly used — one from the right and the other from the left leg of a 
sheep.' I regard them as the direct ancestors of cubical dotted dice, 
the name of which in Arabic is the same as that of the bones. The dice 
used in Arabic countries are made in pairs (see Xo. 16), and the most 
popular and universal game is one with two dice, Mhatain.

VALUES OF THE THROW.S WITH KNUrKLK HONES. 

Tarnliumara Indians, Cliiliualuia, Mexico. 

Games with knuckle bones are a favorite amusement in Spanish- 
American countries, and it is claimed that they existed among the 
Indians before the discovery. Dr. Carl Lumholtz found them among 
the Tarahumara,'^ who attribute numerical values to the different sides. 

Among the Pai)ago in Arizona Mr. W J McGee found a single 
knuckle bone of a bison, used in playing a game called Tan-umn, of 
which a s])ecimen collected by him (fig. 149,) is exhibited in the TT. S. 
National Museum (Cat. No. 174443). 



' The favorite game among the Turkomans, according to Vamb^ry (Arminins Viim- 
b('ry, Sketclies of Central Asia, Pljil.adelphia, 1868, p. 110), is the Jshik game {ashik, 
the ankle bones of slieep), which is played in the manner of European- dice with the 
four aukle bones of a slieep, and with a degree of passionate excitement of which 
one can form no idea. The upper part of the bone is called tara, thelower allchl, and 
the two sides yantarap. The player tiikes these fonr little bones into the palm of his 
hand, throws them up and receives half the stake, if two tara or two altch'u and the 
whole of the stake, if all fonr lava or dllclii turn up. 

The advantage to be gained arises entirely from dexterity in throwing. Trickery 
is impossible, since the bones are fre(]>ieutly changed. 

Dr. Karl Hiudy (Die abteilung der Spiele in Spiegel der niandschu-sprache, T'oung 
Pao, VI, p. 355) gives the Manchnname of knuckle houe as j/aru.ra. It would appear 
from his account that several games were known corresponding to tho.se described 
by the author as i)layed by Syrian children. One, played by chihlren, in which the 
bones were employed as jackstones; another in which they were used as dice, and a 
third filliping a knuckle bone at something or throwing at a knuckle bone set in the 
ground. The Chinese name of knuckle bone is jnH sink kwat (pei si kn). 

-' They call the game Tu wi tni wa la. They play with two knuckle bones. The 
counts are shown in fig. 148. In addition to these counts, if a bone stands on its 
pointed end it counts six, and on the end opposite, twelve. 

Twelve points c<)nstitut(^ a game. The specimens collected by Dr. Lundioltz are 
in the American Museum of Natural History (Cat. No. -y-,iV).

The game is i)layed by two persons, who sit facing ench other, 4 or 5 
feet apart. The bone is twirled into the air out of the thumb and fore- 
finger, tlie baclv of tlie iiand being held upward. The position in which 
it fiiUs on the ground controls the count in the game. So long as the 
player succeeds in throwing the pitted side, or "cow-hoof," as it is called, 
ui)ward, he retains possession of the bone, and with each throw wins one 
bean from a i)rearranged number equally 
divided between the jtlayers. The sides do 
not count in the play, and the thrower may 
play again and again without forfeiting the 
bone until he throws the flat side (opposite 
the " cow-hoof") upward, when the bone goes 
to his opponent to throw, with the same 
conditions. The winning of the entire num- 
ber of an opponent's counters constitutes a 
game won. 

In Costa Kica, Br. T. M. Oaluek informs 
me that the Indians in the vicinity of San 

Jose continually play with the astragalus of an ox or cow, using a 
single bone. They call the game by the name of Choque suelo. 

They are also used by the Indians in Peru. Their (,)uicliua name, 
tava., would appear to be derived from the Spanish taha, but this is con- 
trary to the opinion entertained by my informant. Dr. Emilio Montez,' 
who exhibited a i)rehistoric copy of a knuckle bone in terra cotta, from 
Cuzco, in his collection at the Columbian Exposition.^

830 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

Bryan County, Georgia. Mr. William W. Adams found knuckle bones 
in stone gravies opened by him in Williamson County, Tennessee. Thirty 
or forty bones were found in perhaps a hundred graves. They were 
always found in pots. Children's graves contained smaller pots, and 
the bone was smaller, evidently from a small animal. Some were worn 
until nearly smooth on the side, and all showed polish as though tliey 
had been carried or used a long time. A number of specimens from 
mounds are contained in tbe U. S. National Museum, as Cat. No. 63047, 
astragalus of bison from a mound. Pecan Point, Mississippi County, 
Arkansas, and Cat. No. 6304:7a, astragalus of deer from same place, 
both collected by Mr. Edward Palmer. Three specimens (Cat. No. 
61621) are from Lyons County, Kentucky; two others (Cat. No. 91145) 
catalogued from Arkansas, are respectively of deer and bison; another 
(Cat. No. 109518) is from Lepanto, Poinsett County, Arkansas. Some 
of these bones are squared, so as to have six instead of four sides, many 
are more or less cut down, and one is partly calcined. Mr. Cushing found 
a number of knuckle bones of deer, several showing high polish from 
long use, in the muck deposit explored by him at Marco, Florida. 

In England knuckle bones were formerly used in games.^ A single 
bone was tossed and the four sides received, according to Dr. Hyde, 
the following names :^ 

Siqnnum, " Put in." 
Pronum, "Blank." 
Planum, "Take half." 
Tortiiosum, "Take all." 

These terms sutticiently explain the method of play. 

' Ue Ludis Orientallbus, p. 142. 

• Under the head of Cockall, Brand (Observation on Popular Antiquities, London, 
1813, II, p. 288j gives the following account: 

In the English translation of Levinus Lenmius, fol. London, 1658, p. 368. we read: 

"The autients used to play Cockall or casting of huckle bones, which is done 
with smooth sheep bones. The Dutch call them Pickelcn, wherewith our young 
maids that are not yet ripe use to play for a husband, and young married folks 
desjiise these as soon as they are married. But j^oung men use to coutend with 
another with a kind of a bone taken forth of oxe-feet. The Dutch call them Oof en, and 
they play with these at a set time of the year. Moreover Cockals, which the Dutch 
call Teelings, are difit'erent from dice, for they are square with four sides, and dice 
have six. Cockals are used by maids amongst us, and do no ways waste any one's 
estate. For either they pass away the time with them, or if they have time to be 
idle they play for some small matter, as for chestuuts, filberds, pins, buttons, and 
some such 'juncats.' 

"In Langley's Abridgment of Polydor Vergile, fol. 1, we have another description 
of this game: 'There is a game that is played with the posterne bone iu the hynder 
foote of a sheepe, oxe, gote, fallowe, or redde dere, whiche in Latin is called Talus. It 
hath foure chaunces, the ace point, that is named Cants, or Canicula, was one of the 
sides. He that cast it leyed douue a peny or so muche as the gamers were agreed on ; 
the other side was called Venus, that signifieth seven. He that cast the chaunce won 
sixe and all that was layd doune for the castyug of Canis. The two other sides were 
called Chins and Senio. He that did throwe Chius wan three. And he that cast 
Senio gained four. This game (as I take it) is used of children in Northfolke, and

It is said that no traces of cubical dotted dice 
have been discovered in I^gyptin the purely P]gyptian period, but they 
occur in the Delta from the time of Psammetichus I (about C70 B. C). 
They are regarded by scholars as a foreign introduction. 

In the British nuiseum there are two dice of glazed baked clay 
from Assyria, found with tablets of Assurbanipal (668-623 B. C.) at 
Kouyunjik. 

As the glaze of the dice is unlike that of Assyrian pottery, and from 
the fact that the mounds at Ninevah were occupied by a Parthian 
village about 200 B. C, Mr. Pinches concluded that the dice proba

18. Tesserae.' Dice, Ancient Roman or Etruscan. Purchased in 
Florence, Italy. 

Cubes of bone,- about an inch square, rej^ularly marked, the pips 
consisting of concentric circles. As is frequently the case with Roman 
dice, these dice are made of a hollow bone, the openings on two opposite 
sides being stopped with bone i)lugs. Several of the Roman dice in the 
University Museum are stained a greenish color with salts of copper. 

Three tesserae or cubical dice were anciently employed, while four 
tali or knuckle bones were used. It is recorded, however, that as early 
as the time of Eustathiusthe modern practice of using two dice instead 
of three had been established. ' 

In order to prevent cheating, dice were cast into conical beakers 
{pyrf/ns, tiirricnla), the interior of which was formed of ditierent steps. 
A parallel to this is found in the Siamese backgammon, AS^aAa, where the 
dice are thrown into the krahok.^ 

The classical games with dice, of whi(;h accounts have come down to 
us, were chiefly iilayed in connection with a board or table {abacus, 
tabula, alveus, ali'eolus), on which pieces or men were moved according 
to the throws. These pieces were round or oval stones {calculi), or 
later, draftsmen {latr unculi), }nst, as with us, the same men are used 
for draughts and backgammon. 

Professor Lanciani'^ states that the one hundred and more gaming- 
tables {tabulae lusoria) found in Rome, mostly during his lifetime, belong 
to six dift'ereut games of hazard. In some of them, the mere chance of 
dice-throwing was coupled with a certain amount of skill in moving 
the ''men" or tesserae. Their outline is always the same. There are 
horizontal lines at equal distance, each line containing twelve signs, 
thirty-six in all. The signs vary in almost every table; there are 
circles, squares, vertical bars, leaves, letters, monograms, crosses, cres- 
cents, and immodest symbols; the majority of these tables (sixty- live)

contain words arranged so as to make a fall sentence with tliirty-six 
letters. The rules of the games played u])oii tliese tables are as yet 
only conjectural. 

The game of Duodecim scripta, "twelve lines," was substantially tbe 
same as our backgammon. It was played upon a board with twelve 
double lines, with fifteen white and fifteen black men; the throws were 
counted as we count tliem; the "blots" might bo captured; the pieces 
(whether they started from home or not) had to be brought home, and 
the winner was he who first cleared off his men. The principal varia- 
tion from the modern game lies in three dice being emi^loyed instead 
of two, agreeing in this respect with the game of FacJdsi (ISlo. 38). 
According to Heroditus^ games with dice (including also knuckle- 
bones and ball) were invented by the Lydians as a diversion during a 
time of famine, that they might not feel the craving for food.

usually sold in sets of six. 

The Chinese play a great variety of dice-games, the principal one 
being with two dice, and known as Chdlc f mlMu, "Throwing Heavens 
and Nines," from the names of the two highest throws. In this game 
the twenty-one throws that can be made with two dice receive different 
names, and are divided into two series or suites, called man, "civil,"

834 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

The antiquity of dice in China is not known. They appear to have ' 
been introduced into that country from India. It will be observed that 
a cosmical significance is attached to the dice throws, the "six"' being 
called '"Heaven," and its opposite, "one," "Earth." The "four" 
between is designated as "Man." ^ 

Korean dice, called tjyou-sd-a, differ from those of China in having 

the 1 and 2, 3 and 4, and 5 and G opposite. A set in the University 

Museum, collected by Dr. E. B. Landis, are marked with plain black 

dots, arranged like the Hindu Mbatain, to form a pair. A single 

Korean die (fig. 152), in the same museum, is a rectangular prism, liat 

instead of square. The arrangement of the dots is the same, but the 

" one " and the " four " is in red, as well as the two middle spots of the 

"six" and the middle spot of the " five" and of the " three." 

It is interesting to note that the arrangement of the dots on the 

Korean dice is the same as that on some of 

the Etruscan dice.^ A peculiar importance 

is attached to the latter, from the fact that 

it is believed by Etruscologists that the first 

six numerals of the Etruscan language have 

been recovered from a pair of dice exhumed

usual pips or dots, the following words in Etruscan letters: Mach,

by scholars upon the assumption that they are numerals, and also that 
the pips which they are supposed to replace were uniformly arranged 
1 + 3, 2 + 4, 5 + 6 (Campanari's law). Comparison of the Etruscan 
dice words with the numerals used in the Korean game of Nyout, a 
comparison suggested by the fact of the agreement of the Korean and 
Etruscan dice in their dissimilarity from other dice, shows a curious 
corresi)ondence.

from an Ural-Altaic stock, their correspondence with the dice words 
would seem to support Canon Isaac Taylor's ' theory of the I Tgric origin of 
the Etruscans. It should be observed, however, that if the words stand 
for numerals they are not paired^ in either of the ways (1 + 3, 2 4- 4, 
5 + 6, or 1 + 2, 3 + -1, 5 + C) in which Etruscan dice are marked.' 
The doubt as to their being numerals is reinforced by the Korean die 
inscribed with the x>rayer to Buddha (p. 821). 

20. Sai. Dice/ Japan. Pair of plaster dice for Sugoroku (Ko. 28). 

Japanese dice are similar to those of China, from which country they 
were doubtless borrowed. The "fours" are sometimes, but not invari- 
ably, marked in red. The 
most popular game is 
SugoroJcti (No. 28). 

Before leaving the sub- 
ject of dice it may be ob- 
served that cubical dot- 
ted dice do not appear 
to have been known to 
the American tribes be- 
fore the time of the con- 
quest. At the same time 
mention should be made 
of a die of steatite found 
with Indian remains at 
Kiokee Creek, Columbia 
County, Georgia, in the 
collection of Dr. Roland 
Steiner, in the United States National Museum (Cat. No. 172563). It 
consists of a rudely cut square prism of steatite about j inch in length. 
Two of the opposite longer sides are marked with six and four pits and 
two with five and three. One of the ends has two and the other what is 
doubtless intended for one dot. The pips are irregularly disposed. It 
no doubt dates from the time of white contact. 

'Etruscan Researches, London, 1874. 

"" Mach is opposite Zal, Thu is opposite Huth, and Ki is opposite Sa." Robert 
Ellis, Etrnscan Numerals, London, 1876. 

■ Since the above was written the writer has acquired an Etruscan triplicate bone 
die (fig. 153) found in Chiusi or its vicinity, on which the dots are arranged differ- 
ently from any thus far noticed by him. The 6 is here opposite the 4, and 5 oppo- 
site 3. One o^ the ends is marked 1 and the other 2. The spots are marked with 
small dotted circles which retain traces of red paint. It has been suggested that 
these triplicate dice, which are not infrequent, are unfinished and have yet to 
be sawed ajiart. It is evident from this specimen that such is not the case. They 
bear a strong general resemblance to the liamala pdsd, or dice used in fortune- telling, 
among which we find three cubical dice united by a metal bar, and again, in auothor 
variety used in India, the same arrangement of spots: 3, 4, 5, 6 on a long die. (See 
p. 824.)

21. KwAT P'li.' "Bone tablets," dominoes. Canton, China. 

Set of thirty-two domino ])ieces of teak wood 2| inches by g inch by 
f inch. Natural wood, with incised spots painted white and red. 

Chinese dominoes are marked in the same manner as the dice, from 
which they are clearly derived. There are twenty-one distinct pieces, 
representing the jjermutations of two dice. Eleven of these jiieces are 
doubled, making a total of thirty-two in the set. Each piece received 
a name, and in the popular game of Td fin l-an, or " Heavens and 
Nines," the thirty-two pieces are divided into two suites or series, called 
31an, "civil," and Mo, "military." 

The Man pieces are as follows : 

^, called fin, "Heaveu." 

■f, called ti, "Earth." 

I, called 2/aw, "Man." 

I, called wo, "Harmony." 

f, called nuii, "plum flower." 

f, called cheu7ig sam, "long threes." 

f, called 2>fl'n tang, "bench." 

f, called /it faw, "tiger's head." 

f, called hum/ fau shap, "red-head ten." 

f, called ho keuk ts'at, " long-leg seven." 

'i, called hrmg ch'ui Ink, "red-mallet six." 

Each of the above pieces is duplicated, the duplicates mating. 
The Mo pieces : 

I and \, called cM tsiin, "supreme." 
f and I, called tsctp kaii, " heterogeneous nines," 
f and f, called tsdp pat, "heterogeneous eights." 
I and ^2, called tsdp ts'at, "heterogeneous sevens." 
-4 and I, called tsdj) 'ng, "heterogeneous fives." 

They mate as above. The two pieces called chi tsiin, or "supreme," 
when x)aired rank as the highest of the Mo series, but when apart, as 
the lowest. 

The game of Td fin Tcau is in manv respects the most interesting 
Chinese domino game. It somewhat resembles the card games of 
Europe, and is of considerable antiquity in China, existing, according 
to Mr. Wilkinson,^ in 1120 A. D. 

The invention of the game of dominoes has been variously attributed 
to the Jews, the Greeks, and the Chinese. It may be justly credited to 
the latter people. No date can be assigned to its invention, and from 
the cosmical associations of the pieces, and their use in divination, which 
continues in China to the present day, it may be regarded as having 
been originally used for that purpose. That dominoes originated in 
dice is clearly apparent, the chief problem being the reason for the 
duplication of the eleven pieces. With the knowledge derived from 
the study of games in general, this may be assumed to have been done

in order that the dice tlirows might accord with the thirty-two points 
that represent the Four Quarters and the intermediary divisions of the 
world. They may be looked upon as having been implements of magic 
for determining number and i)lace, corresi)onding with playing cards, 
from which they only differ in material, as ]Mr. Wilkinson has suggested.' 
In addition to the long wooden dominoes, small dominoes, made of 
bamboo, or bone, or wood and bone conjoined like those of Korea, are 
used in various parts of China. Sets in which the series is several 
times duplicated also occur in China, as well as dominoes on which the 
dots are replaced by the characters that stand for the chess pieces, and 
the suit marks of certain Chinese playiug-cards.-

Set of eighty-four cards, S-j inches by 1 inch, with rounded corners 
and red backs, consisting of the twenty-one natural dominoes of the 
Chinese series, quadrupled (flg. 154). 

'The writer Is inclined to belic-ve that in the assignment of the dice casts to the 
thirty-two points, they were iirst practically applied to as many divining slips or 
arrow lots, consisting of long, narrow strips of bamboo. Sncli objects occnr at the 
present day in the sot-called ch'ni pWi, or "leaping tablets," of which a set from Fuh- 
chau exists iu the Museum of the Long Island Historical Society. They con.sist of 
thirty-two slips of bamboo, about 14 inches in length, with domino spots marked at 
one end, contained iu a cylindrical bamboo box from which they are thrown, resem-

838 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

These cards are designated by the collector, Mr. W. H. Wilkinsou, 
as Pat Vin l<au from their being used in the game of T^in hau. Several 
varieties of domino cards occur in China. The evolution of playing 
cards from dice through the wooden domino seems at first sight to be 
clearly apparent, but the true ancestor of the playing card is doubtless 
found in the arrow, as shown under Korean playing cards.

Korean dominoes consist of small bone or ivory tablets, or of bone

two pieces, identical with those of China. They receive difierent 
names, however^ and are mated differently from the Chinese. The 
names are as follows: 

1-1, 81J0-S1J0 (Chinese, siu siu), "smallest."

The method of pairing is shown in fig. 155.^ The Korean games difier 
from those of China, the most popular, called Ho-hpai, "Foreign or 
Chinese Tablets," having many points of resemblance to the Chinese 
system of fortune-telling in which dominoes are used (See Chinese 
Games with Dice and Dominoes). Korean dominoes are clearly of 
Chinese origin.

duplicated, and one of each of the 
pieces 6-3 and 6-2. Both Burmese 
and Siamese dominoes are probably 
derived from China. 



25. Dominoes. United States.' Set 
of twenty-eight pieces, bone, 
with black wood backs. 

Dr. Gustav Schlegel states that 
the European game of dominoes was 
borrowed from the Chinese, the phil- 
osophic-astromonic eleuients being 
done away with, and only the arith- 
metical retaiued. 

The game seems to date from a re- 
cent period in Europe. According to Brockhaus' Conversations-Lexi- 
kon, Article "Domino," it was introduced into Germany through 
France from Italy about the middle of the last century. In England 
it a])pears, from a writer m Notes and Queries, to have been introduced 
by French prisoners about the close of the last century.

840 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

26. Dominoes.' Eskimo. Labrador, North America. 

Flat pieces of ivory, cut in irregular shapes, marked on one face with 
spots arranged in different patterns. The number of pieces in a set 
varies from sixty to one hundred and forty-eight. 

According to Mr. Lucien M. Turner, by whom they were collected, 
the game is played in the following manner: 

Two or more persons, according to the number of pieces in the set, sit down and 
pile the pieces before them. One of the players mixes the pieces together in plain 
view of the others. When this is done, he calls them to take the pieces. Each 
person endeavors to obtain a half or third of the number, if there be two or three 
players. The one who mixed up the ])ieces lays down a piece and calls his opponent 
to match it with a piece having a similar design. If this can not be done by any of 
the players, the first has to match it, and the game continues until one of the players 
has exhausted all of the pieces taken by hiui. The pieces are designed in pairs, having 
names such as ka miu tik (sled), laiak (canoe), kaU aak (navel), a ma znt (many), a tail 
s'ik (1), md kok (2), ping a sut (3), si tn mut (4), and id U mat (5). Each of the names 
above must be matched wdth a piece of similar kind, although the other end of the 
piece may be of a different design. A kamiitik may be matched with an amazut, if 
the latter has not a line or bar cut across it ; if it has a bar, it must be matched with 
an amazut. 

This game is known to the people of the Ungava district, but those only who 
learn it fiom Northerners are able to play it. The northern Eskimo stake the 
last article they possess on the issue of the game. Their wives are disposed of tem- 
porarily, and often are totally relinquished to the victor. I have heard of wives so 
disposed of often sit down and win themselves back to their foi'mcr owners. 

The game appears to have been borrowed from European rather than 
Asiatic sources. 

Another set of Eskimo dominoes (Plate 27), difffering in their marks 
from the preceding, is contained in the American Museum of Natural 
History in New York City (Cat. No. t^vt)- It was collected by Capt. 
George Comer from the Central Eskimo of Savage Islands, West Coast 
of Hudson Bay, and consists of thirty- six pieces of ivory marked with 
dots, running irregularly from eight on one side down to blank. It is 
clearly a degenerate form of the European game. 

27. CHONa UN Ch'au. Game of the Chief of the Literati. Canton, 

China. Tallies and dice.^ 

Chong un ch^au is played with tallies, cWau, the highest of which is 
called chong ibi, the name given the Optimus at the examinations for 
the degree of Hanlin, whence I have styled it "The Game of the Chief 
of the Literati." Two or more persons maj^ play, using six dice and 
sixty-three bamboo tallies. The players throw in turn from right to 
left, and after throwing each draws the tally he is entitled to for his 
throw. 

This game is in many respects analogous to the Game of Promotion

(No. 6), tlie titles of dififerent officials being* painted upon tallies 
instead of being printed upon a diagram. The form of the tallies sug- 
gest the probability of their having been derived from arrows. An 
American Indian analogue is found in the Micmac game of icoltes-takun 
(p. G97). 

28. SuGOROKU. "Double Sixes." Japan. Board ^ and teetotum. ^ 
A common game with Japanese children, usually played at the New 

Year. The diagram or board, which is printed in colors, is divided 
into a number of divisions distinguished by pictures. One of the 
most popular forms is called do chm, or "traveling" sugorol-u, and is 
played upon a large sheet of paper on which are represented the various 
stopping places on a journey. The moves are made according to the 
throws with one or more dice, or with a teetotum (Japanese coma). The 
game exhibited is entitled Ifan niyo ichi clai shus-sei sugorolcu or " Boys 
and girls step by step advancing sugoroTcu,^^ and is printed in colors 
upon a large sheet of paper. Another game in the museum is entitled 
Kamalcura ei-yu sugorolcu, or "The heroes of Kamakura surgorolu,''^ and 
another, Galko seito ben Iciyo surgorolu, or "School- students studying 
sugoroTcn.'''' New games are published in Japan at each recurring New 
Year. Like the corresponding games at the present day in Europe 
and America, they frequently reflect whatever is ui^permost in the 
popular mind. Thus, in 1894-95 the war with the Chinese gave rise 
to the Shina set hatsu sugorolcu^ or "Punishing China surgorolcu,''^ a 
specimen of which is in the University Museum (Cat. No. 17687). The 
name sugoroJcu is more correctly applied to the game of backgammon 
played with two dice, but is used at the j)resent day in Japan to desig- 
nate all games phiyed on boards or diagrams in which the moves are 
made by throwing dice.

Board, men, and spinning arrow ^ used instead of dice. The board

Board printed in colors with one hundred and twenty-two numbered 
stations. 

The first game of this type published in the United States is said to 
have been " The Mansion of Happiness," issued by Mr. S. B. Ives of 
Salem, Massachusetts, about the year 1847, and said to have been 
copied from an English game. Mr. Ives was the first publisher of 
games as a business in this country. In 1861 Mr. Milton Bradley of 
Springfield, Massachusetts, published the " Checkered Game of Life." 
These were the forerunners of a large number of similar games in the 
United States, among which the following are included in the collec- 
tion of the University of Pennsylvania: "Steeple Chase"; "Yacht 
Eace"; "Bicycle Eace"; "Messenger Boy"; "Eound the World,' 
together with others with more or less fanciful titles invented in order 
to secure the protection of copyright. 

The prototype of the boards in these and the preceding games (Nos. 
28 to 32) is to be found in the Korean IS^yout circuit. 

The following foreign games of the foregoing type are contained in 
the collection of the Museum of Archaeology and Paleontology of the 
University of Pennsylvania.* 

»Cat. No. 16467, Mus. Arch., Univ. Penn. 

^ A square of cardboard, with the numbers from 1 to 6 arranged in a cii'cle, and a

are substituted on account of the prejudice against the use of the dice through 
their association with gambling.

34. TlwuLAH. Backgammon. Damascus, Syria. 

Foldiiij;' board inlaid with niotber-of-pearl and silver wire, dice, and 
men.' The game is played in the same manner as tlie common English 
game. The game of backgammon belongs to what I have designated, 
for convenience, as the Xyout series. Dr. Hyde has remarked that the 
six points upon each quarter of the backgammon board were devised 
to correspond with the six points of the cubical die. 

35. Tabal. liackgammon, Johore, Malay Peninsula. Board.^ 

The name of this game, tabalj is doubtless from the Portugese tabola 
or Spanish tahla.

Cat. No. nfiOI, Museum of AichaH)ln(;y, University of Pennsylvania. 

The game of Backgammon, played upon a board of twenty-four sta- 
tions similar to the boards in common use in Spain at the present day, 
exists along the entire eastern coast of Asia, from Korea to the Malay 
Peninsula. 
36. Ssang-Ryouk. Backgammon. Korea. 

Reproduction of native picture of ])layers engaged at the game.^ 
This game is described at length in Chinese (lames with Dice and 
Dominoes. It is played with fifteen men, according to the throws with 
two dice, in the same manner as the English game of backgammon. 
Tlie board consists of an unpainted box, 11 by 23.J inches, with inclos- 
ing sides 3| inches high. The men — called mal^ "horses," as in the 
Nyout game — are delicate wooden pins 2f inches high, with a hemi- 
spherical base (fig. 156). Those on one side are painted green, with red

iarity of the men is that they are each marked with the name of a 
famous Korean Kl-saing^ov "singing girl," which is inscribed in Chi- 
nese characters on the bottom of each piece. 
This Korean game nearly agrees with the Chinese backgammon game

described "by Dr. Hyde under the name of Coan ki {Tsun k'i), or tlie 
"Bottle Game."' 

37. Kawade Kelia. Cowrie game. Ceylon. Board and cowries.^ 
The board, 12 by 24:^ inches, is marked with a design cut in the wood 

(fig. 157). It is elevated by two strips of wood nailed transversely across 
the bottom, and bears a nearly obliterated diagram for the same game 
in blue paint. From the exhibit of the Government of Ceylon at the 
Columbian Exposition, Chicago. Two or four persons play. In the 
latter case, two play as partners. Cowries of different kinds are used 
as men, each player having three. These are called bala, " dogs " (singu- 
lar, balo). The moves are made, 
according to the throws, with six 
cowrie shells. The counts are as 
follows : 

6 mouths up = 6 

5 mouths up = 5 

4 mouths up = 4 

3 mouths up = 3 

2 mouths up = 2 

1 mouth up = 1 

The players stand at opposite sides 
of the bottom of the board and finish 
at the end of the interior diagram, 
making the circuit in opposite direc- 
tions. A player may take and set 
back an opponent's piece, unless it be upon one of the squares crossed 
by diagonals, called cattya. A similar game is played in southern India 
under the name of GavaJata, or "cowrie play," upon a square checkered 
board having an odd number of squares upon a side (fig. 158). Two or 
four persons play, each using one or two cowries as men, which they 
move according to the throws with four or five cowries.^ 

When two play, one starts at A and the other at B, moving in the direc- 
tion of the arrows. The object is to traverse all the squares to the center. 
A player kills and sends back an opponent's piece when his own falls 
upon the same square, unless it rests in a protected square or "castle."* 

These games are clearly related to the following game, Pachisi. The 
cowries used in it, as in Pachisi, may be regarded as a convenient sub- 
stitute for staves.

India, consist of a cloth or board, sixteen wooden or ivory pieces or 
men, and seven cowrie shells. The board consists of four rectangles, 
with their narrow sides so placed as to form a square in the center 
(tig. 159). Each rectangle is divided into twenty-four small squares, 
consisting of three rows of eight squares each. The game is usually 
played by four i)ersons, each of whom is furnished with four ivory or 
wooden cones called gate of a peculiar color for distinction, and takes 
his station opposite one of the rectangles. His pieces, gote, start one 
by one from the middle row of his own rectangle, beginning at the

division next to the large central space. They then proceed all around 
the outside rows of the board, passing, of course, through those of the 
adversaries' rectangles, traveling from right to left (i. e., contrary to 
the sun) until they get back to the central row from which they started. 
Any piece is liable, however, to be taken up and thrown back to the

motion is determined by tlirowing six or seven' cowrie sliells as dice,

counts are as follows : 

1 aperture up ^= 10 

2 jipertuies up = 2 

3 apertures up := 3 

4 apertures up = 4 

5 apertures up = 25 

6 apertures up = 30 

7 apertur>'S up = 12 
No apertures up ^ 6 

A throw of twenty-five or thirty gives an additional move of one. At 
the last step the throw must amount to exactly one more than the num- 
ber of S(iuares left to enable the piece to go into the central space, i. e., 
off the board. If it happens to stop on the last square, it can not get off

until twenty -five or thirty is thrown. The players throw in turns, and 
each goes on until he throws a two, three, or four, when he loses the 
lead. If the same number be thrown thrice successively, it does not 
count. The game is generally played with six cowries, making the 
highest throw twenty-five (the six apertures up then counting twelve); 
hence it is termed Pachisi (from pachiSj twenty-five). The board used 
is a carpet or some other fabric, ornamented and marked with cloth of 
different colors sewed upon it. It is sometimes played by two person.s, 
each taking the opposite rectangles with eight pieces and playing them 
all from the rectangle next to him. The game continues till three of 
the players get out. They never play for money."^

and divinatory iu its origin. The board itself represents the Four 
Quarters of the World. Its four arms, each with eight squares, may 
be regarded as the four arms of the internal cross of the nyout circuit, 
each of three points extended by the four arcs, each of five points. 

The position of the "castles" or squares marked with a cross on the 
arms is not always the same,' but commonly, as on the cloth from the 
Maldives (No. 43), they agree with the large circles at the four quarters 
of the nyout circuit. 

The colors of the men agree with those assigned to the seasons of 
the year and the four quarters of the world to which they correspond, 
in Asia. When four persons play, the red and green, and black and 
yellow play partners. This relation is indicated on the men used in 
the Burmese game (No. 42), which are painted with the complementary 
colors, the red men having green tips, and vice versa. This corresponds 
with the relation assumed to exist between the seasons and the world 
quarters and their corresponding colors. As each quarter of the world 
has four quarters, each player in turn has four men. As the men or 
pieces may be regarded in the cosmical game as actually representing 
men, they appear as such in the Maldivian game (No. 43) like the men 
of the Noah's Ark. The name of the pieces, gate (singular, got),- also 
applied to the pawns in chess, is derived from the Sanskrit glioiaka, a 
horse. This agrees with the Korean name of the men in layout : onal, 
"horse," or "horsemen." 

The two faces of the Korean staves, black and white, may be regarded 
as signifying, as will apj)ear in the following pages, the dual principles 
of nature, masculine and feminine. A feminine significance is widely 
attributed to the aperture of the cowrie shell. Its convex side would 
naturally be regarded as masculine ; hence its substitution for the staves 
would seem to have been an easy transition. 

The distribution of the game of Pachisi in Asia, as illustrated by 
specimens in the U. S. National Museum and the Museum of the Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania, is from Syria to the Philippines.

ters of their games, invocatecl a demon which they name Macuilsucitl, which means 
Five Roses (flowers). They invocate him, so that he should give them luck in 
winning.' 

All especial interest is attached to the game of Patolli from the fact 
of its resemblance to the Hindu Pachisi being- regarded as one of the 
strongest evidences of the Asiatic origin of the old Mexican culture. 
Attention was first called to this resemblance by Dr. E. B. Tylor in a 
paper before the Anthropological Institute, entitled " The game of 
patolli in ancient Mexico and its probable Asiatic origin." ^ 

In plate 29 may be seen a picture of Patolli from Duran's Atlas, the 
original being in colors. 

An excellent resume of the accounts of Patolli, as related by the 
chroniclers, is given by Prof. E. B. Tylor in the Journal of the Anthro- 
pological Institute, ' and republished in the Internationales Archiv fiir 
Ethnograpbie.^

Chausar is played upon the same board as Pachisi, with the substi- 
tution of three dice marked with spots counting one, two, five, and six.*' 

Either long dice (Ko. 13) or short ones pointed at the ends, like those 
here exhibited, are used. 

The shorter dice are said to be used as cheaper in price. The two

Translation, Commentary, and Notes by Zelia Nuttall. 

'Another picture in the same manuscript, reproduced by Mrs. Nuttall, described 
as the mauta de cinco rosas (Mantle of the Five Roses), suggests the attributes of this 
god. It consists of a parallelogram, at the four corners of wliich are four circles, 
each of the color attributed among the ]Mexicans to the Four Directions. 

"Xochipilli, lord of flowers, otherwise named Macuilxochitl, five flowers (the 
name of a small odorous plant), was the deity who gave and protected all flowering 
plants. As one of the gods of fertility and production, he was associated with 
Tlaloc, god of rains." Brintou, Rig Veda Americanus, p. 40. 

-Journal of the Anthropological Institute, VIII, 1878. The first writer to discuss 
the resemblances of the games of the American Indians with those of the Old World, 
as an argument in favor of the Asiatic origin of the American race, was P. Lafitau 
in his Moeurs des Sauvages Ameriquains Comparees aux Moeurs des Premiers Temps, 
Paris, 1724. Under Des Jeiix (II, p. 338) he describes and illustrates the plum stone 
game played upon a mat, and the bowl game, comparing them with the similar custom 
of throwing cowrie shells, practiced by the negroes of Africa (see p. 815), and with 
knuckle bones of classical antiquity. He then compares the game of straws, pailles, 
with cards, and concludes with a parallel between the Indian ball games and those 
of the Greeks and Romans.

kinds find a parallel in the long and short blocks nsed in the Wyotit

tribes. In the case of the latter a ceremonial distinction is said to 
sometimes exist, one kind being used exclusively by women, who are not 
permitted to play with the otliers.

Cloth with four arms, each with three rows of eight squares consist- 
ing of silk cloth of different colors. 

A detailed account of Pasit is given by Shay Yoe.^ The game is 
also called ehuay pyU-thee and ansah pyit-thee. He describes six cow- 
ries {chuay) being used, the throws with which count as follows: 

1 mouth up =10, i'ae. 

2 mouths up = 2, pah. 

3 mouths up := 3, thohn, 

4 mouths up = 4, lay. 

5 mouths up =25, taseht. 

6 mouths up = 12, bahyah. 
No mouths up= 6, chouk. 

These, it will be seen, closely agree with those described on page 853, 
as do the rules in general. The " castles," called poh or kyah, are colored 
red or green. The game is also played with three dice, identical with 
those described under Chausar (No. 40). 

42. DHOLA(Pae/mi). Maldive Islands. Cloth, men, and cowrie shells, 

weighted with lead, used as dice-' (Plate 30). 
The cloth is made of blue cotton with the squares embroidered in

Five cowries are used. In Ceylon the men receive the name of ito. 

43. Pachis [Pachisi). Persia. 

Wooden board,^ composed of four pieces which fit together in the 
middle to form a cross (Plate 31). The face is gilded and painted in 
colors. There are three rows of eight squares in each arm, with 
pictures of women, covered with mica, at each of the four ends. It 
will be observed that the game is known in Persia by its Hindu name. 
The method of play, if it differs from that in India, is unknown to the 
writer.''

44. Edris a Jin. Edris of the Genii, a game like Pachisi. Druses 

of Lebauon, Syria. Cloth and cowrie shells used as dice 

and men." 
The board is much more complicated than the preceding, consisting 
of a large square cotton cloth marked with a i^arti-colored diagram 
witli four arms each having four rows of eight squares, each connected 
at the ends by a diagonal row of eight squares, the whole forming an 
octagonal figure. The inner square, composed of sixteen small squares, 
is called the seroi. The moves are made according to the throws with 
four cowries. Each player has three men, other shells, one of which 
is called the "chief," and the others "soldiers." The former are filled 
with red sealing wax, to which colored paper is pasted, distinguishing 
them as red, green, yellow, and black. The name of the game, Edris, 
which is applied in Syria to simple games played with men upon 
boards, among which is Merrels, is the same as that of Enoch,^ the 
prophet of the Druses. 

In this game, which, from its terminology, is possibly of Persian 
origin, the pieces are differentiated. It appears to be a step in the 
direction of the game of chess, although not in the direct line. 

45. Chaturanga. Dice chess. Ancient India. Board, men ^ (repro- 

dnctions) and die. 

The game of Ghaturanga, now apparently extinct, is described in 
detail in the Bhavisliya Pnrana, of which translations have been given 
by several writers. It was i^layed upon au ordinary chessboard of 
sixty-four squares by four players, each of whom had eight men, dis- 
tinguished \iY the colors red, green, yellow, and black. The men con- 
sisted of four foot soldiers or pawns, and a Eajah, Elephant, Horse, and 
Ship, which are placed in the order of Ship, Horse, Elei)hant, and Eajah, 
beginning from the left corner, with the four foot soldiers in front. The 
partners' pie(;es occupy the opposite diagonals. The Eajah, Elephant, 
and Horse move as the King, Eook, or Castle and Knight in modern 
chess; the Ship always two squares diagonally, hopping over au inter- 
mediate iiiece if necessary; the foot soldier like the pawn in our own 
game. The players play alternately in the order of the sun. The 
moves were made according to the throws with a die marked 2, 3, 4, 5. 
On throwing T), the Eajah or a foot soldier was moved; if 4 was 
thrown, the Elephant; 3, the Horse, and 2, the Ship. It is not cer- 
tain from the account referred to that the die was employed after the 
opening move.

any other piece. He might, if expedient, be captured by his partner's 
men, who thus placed himself in command of both armies. 

The name of the game, Chaturanga or "four angas," is that of the 
four angas or members of an army, a term which is applied to real 
armies by the epic poets of India.^ 

The relation of the game of Chaturanga to the game of Pachisi is 
very evident. The board is the square of the arm of the Pachisi cross, 
and even the castles of the latter appear to be perpetuated in the 
camps, similarly marked with diagonals, on the Chinese chessboard 
(No. 51).2 The arrangement of the men at the corners of the board 
survives in the Burmese game of Chess (No. 46). The four-sided die is 
similar to that used in Chausar (No. 40). The pieces or men are of the 
same colors as in Pachisi, and consist of the four sets of men or pawns 

of the Pachisi game, with the addition 
of the four distinctive chess pieces, the 
origin and significance of which remain 
to be accounted for. By analogy, it 
may be assumed that the board, if not 
indeed all boards upon which games 
are played, stands for the world and 
its four quarters (or the year and its 
four seasons), and that the game itself 
was originally divinatory. 

The theory that modern chess had 
its origin in Chaturanga, suggested by 
Capt. Hiram Cox in 1799, and upheld 
and developed by Prof. Duncan Forbes ' 
has not been accepted by students of 
the game generally. The antiquity of 
the Purana in which it is described, has been questioned, and the game 
asserted to be a comparatively modern adaptation of the primal Hindu 
game. Apart from this discussion the relation of Chess to an earlier 
dice game, such as Pachisi, appears to be evident. The comparative 
study of games leads to the belief that practically all games as chess, 
played upon boards, were i^receded by games in which the jjieces were 
animated by dice, cowries or knuckle bones, or by staves, as in the 
Korean Nyout, the Egyptian Tab, and many aboriginal American games. 

'For a further account of the game with a translation of the original authorities, 
consult Edward Falkeuer, Games Ancient and Oriental, London, 1892, from which 
the above is taken. 

2 This survival of the Castles on the chessboard is still more clearly seen on the 
Persian chessboard figured by Hyde, fig. 161. He says: "The chessboard of the 
Persians living in India is quite square and has the same number of squares. But, 
in order better to protect the King, some of the squares are ' crosscut.' If now the 
King is hard pressed, he can evade either by changing with the Castle, or move to 
one of those crosscut squares." (Historia Shahiludii, p. 60.) A similar marking is 
to be observed on the Burmese chessboard.

The oldest European chessmen in existence appear to be six ivory 
pieces, long preserved in the abbey of St. Dennis and now in the 
National Library at Paris, where they were transferred at the Revolu- 
tion. According to tradition, they were a gift to the abbey from

51. TSEUNG K-f. Chess. Canton, China. Board ^ and men. 

The board, commonly made of paper, has sixty-four squares, which 
are separated into two parts in the middle by a blank space, the width 
of one square, called the "River." Four squares in the middle of each 
side of the board in the first and second rows nearest the edge are 
crossed with two diagonal intersecting lines, marking an inclosure, 
which is called the "Palace." The pieces on each side, which are 
placed at the intersections of the lines instead of on the squares, and 
consist of disks of wood inscribed on both sides with the Chinese char- 
acter for the name, distinguished by the colors red and blue, are as 
follows : 

Tsmng, "General" (1) King. 

Sz\ "Coimcillors" (2) Bishops. 

Taenng, "Elephants" (2). 

Md, "Horses" (2) = Knights. 

Ch'e, "Chariots" (2) = Castles. 

P'du, "Cannons" (2). 

Ping and Tsut (on opposite sides), "Foot soldiers" (5) ^ Pawns. 

The "Generals" are placed in the middle of each outer row with the 
"Councillors" on either -side. Next without them are the two 
"Horses" with the "Chariots" in the corners. The " Cannons" occupy 
the first points of intersection from the edges of each of the second 
rows, while the "Footsoldiers" are placed in the third row with one 
intervening point between each of them. 

The "General" is not permitted to move outside of his " Palace" and 
only along the perpendicular and horizontal lines. The "Chancellors," 

some in periodicals devoted to the game, in learned journals, and as essays, such as 
that by Fritz Strohmeyer on "Chess in Old French" in the collection of essays pub- 
lished on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the professorship of Dr. 
Adolf Toblcr, Halle A. S., 1895. While these have, here and there, corrected a date, 
established matters doubted by Van der Linde, and enlarged the information given 
by him, tliey have left substantially unchanged the more important features of his 
work. Thus they have shoved back the date of knowledge of chess among the Arabs 
a generation, have shown knowledge of chess in Europe some fifty years before the 
earliest date assigned by him; proved that he spoke too quickly as to the Problem 
Collection of Bomus Socius comprising the whole problematical chess literature of 
the Middle Ages, etc. His books are somewhat disfigured by controversial bitter- 
ness, and too great critical skepticism ; the style is not attractive, but they are mines 
of information.

wLicli move along the diagonal lines, also never quit the " Palace," 
although other pieces may enter or pass through it. The " Elephants" 
move two squares diagonally, but can not jump over an intermediate 
piece nor cross the " River." The " Horse" has the move of our Knight, 
but may not jump over an intermediate piece. It may cross the 
"River," the "River" forming one-half of its move. The "Chariot"

moves like our " Castle," and may cross the " River." The " Cannons" 
move like the " Chariot," except that they can not move without jump- 
ing over one piece, but they can not jump over two. The "Footsol- 
diers" move and take one point at a time in a forward direction. They 
can cross the "River," the "River" itself being one move. When 
across, they can move and take either in a forward or lateral direction. 



CHESS AND PLAYING-CARDS. 865 

On reaching the opposite end they can move and take only laterally. 
The "Generals" may not face each other without intervening pieces. 
The object of the game is to checkmate the " General."^ 

The name of the Chinese game of Chess, Tseung 1c% signifies the 
General's Game. It is regarded by them as having been invented by 
Wu Wang, P.. C. 1169-lllG, the founder of the Chow dynasty. 

The name A'/, which is applied by the Chinese to a great variety of 
games ])layed with men or pieces upon boards, appears to refer espe- 
cially to the counters. "The relations of the Chinese game to the 
Indian game are obscure. It was probably introduced at a compar- 
atively early time from India. The manner of placing the men, at the 
intersections of the lines instead of upon the squares, constitutes one 
of the principal points of difierence."- 

Himly, in discussing the origin of Chinese Chess, expresses the 
opinion that while the game of chess had forerunners the real game 
originated in India as an efBgy of war, and spread from India in the 
sixth or seventh century to the west to Persia, and to the east to 
Cambodia, where, as well as in Persia, the name is evidently derived 
from the Sanskrit Chaturanga (the four army divisions). In the Chinese 
game the names of neither the board, the game, nor the men point to a 
foreign origin, nor does tradition say anything about it. Himly states 
that the first sure trace of chess in China occurs in the Yew kwae luh,^

The Japanese chessboard consists either of a small table, on four 
feet, or a paper diagram. It is a square of nine or eighty-one squares, 
which are slightly oblong in form. The pieces are i)laced in the squares, 
not on the intersections as in China. They consist of punt-shaped 
pieces of wood of different sizes, lying flat upon the board, not upright, 
and slightly inclined toward the front; the directions of the point 
determining to whom the piece belongs. Unlike all other games of

the player and his adversary. Another peculiarity is that any piece 
taken up may be entered by the adversary in any vacant place he 
chooses, and at any time he thinks desirable to enter it, such entry 
constituting his move. The names of the pieces on each side are as 
follows:

The 8h6, or "General," stands in tLe center of tlie first row. He 
moves one square in any direction and loses the game when check- 
mated. The "Gold Generals" stand on either side of the King and 
move one square in any direction, except the two back diagonals. 

The "Silver Generals" stand on each side next to the "Gold Gen- 
erals" and move one square in any direction, except sideways and 
backward. The Keima stand next to the "Silver Generals" and have 
our Knigbt's move, but only forward. The Kydsha occupy the extreme 
ends and move any number of squares, perpendicularly only. The 
Hislia stands in front of the right-hand Keima and has the move of 
our Castle. The Kallo stands in front of the left-hand Keima and has 
the move of our Bishop. The " Foot soldiers," or Pawns, occupy the 
third row, and move and take one square forward only. 

The three rows nearest each side constitute the opposing camps. 
The "King" and "Gold Generals" retain their rank unchanged 
throughout the game, but the following pieces are ijromoted immedi- 
ately upon entering the enemy's camp, when they are turned over, 
their new names being written on their reverse sides: 

The Hislia becomes Ryo-ivo, " Dragon King," and has the privilege, 
in addition to its former power, of moving one square diagonally like 
the Kalilxo. The KaMo becomes Eyo ma, "Dragon Horse," and has 
the additional power of moving one square forward, sideways, or back- 
ward, like tbe Hislia. The "Silver Generals," Keima, Kyoslia, and 
Hohei, or Pawns, can all attain the rank of "Gold Generals." ^

The Korean game of Pa-tolc is identical with the famous Chinese 
game of Wai A'/, or "Game of Inclosing" {ivai, "to inclose"), which is 
popular in Japan under the name of Go * (No. 56). 

It is played by two players upon a board special to the game, with 
two sets of men of different colors (fig. 172). The board is divided into 
squares of uniform color, 18 by 18, numbering therefore three hundred 
and twenty-four. The pieces are played on the intersection of the hori-

tion, the number of places on which the men can be played is 19 by 19= 
three hundred and sixty-one. 

The Korean board is made in the form of a small hollow table, difler- 
ing from the Japanese board, which consists of a solid block of wood. 
In China the boards are printed on paper. The men used in Korea 
are small, polished, black pebbles and irregular pieces of white shell. 
The players place their men alternately on any of the points of inter- 
section of the horizontal and vertical lines not already occupied, the 
object of the game being to occupy as much of the board as oossible.

victory being decided in favor of the player who has command of the 
most spots. Space can be occupied in two ways: by placing men on 
the different points, and by forming an inclosure with one's men, the 
space thus contained being reckoned as one's territory. The latter 
gives the Chinese name to the game.' 

The invention of the game of Wai ¥i, of which some of the most inter-

of games in Cliiua, Korea, and Japan, and one of the few which receive 
the api)robation of the educated classes in those countries. Simple as 
the game appears, it embodies certain complex elements based upon 
primitive notions of the universe, which, although they may in part be 
secondary and late additions, are of the highest interest. Thus the 
pieces, black and white, are regarded as representing the night and 
the day; the four "angles" the four seasons, and the three hundred 
and sixty-one points of intersection on the board (3G0 + 1) the number 
of days in the year. Nine stations at the intersections, which are

The Chinese in thq books which treat of the game divide the board 
into four equal parts, which they call "corners," and which they desig-

ARRANGEMENT OF MEN ON CHUKI BOARD. 



872 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

Ill each of tbese four sections a place is generally marked out at a 
distance of four steps along the principal diagonal counted from the 
outer angle. Each spot is therefore equally distant from the two 
external sides of the section. These four points (fig, 173) are called 
l-an, sun, Tciv^un, and ¥in. The latter terms are the names given to the 
diagrams in the magic symbol of the universe, called the Pat hwd, or 
"Eight Diagrams," which stand for the directions Northeast, South- 
east, Southwest, and Northwest. Like the Nyout circuit, this game 
board has a cosmical significance and represents the world. As if to 
more fully embody and express the relation supposed to exist between 
the seasons, the world quarters — all things in the universe even to the 
tones of the voice that distinguish the meaning of words — as well as 
the notes of the musical scale, two copper wires are strung within the 
resonant chamber of the Korean board and emit a musical note when 
a piece is played. In accordance with the theory I have advanced as 
to the origin of games played upon boards without the intervention 
of dice, we may expect to find intimations of their use in earlier stages 
of this game. Such an earlier stage may be represented in the Malayan 
game of Chnici (No. 55).

The ^ame of Go is regarded by the Japanese as having been intro- 

say that the word aud the thing are of foreign origin, very likely Chinese or Cochin- 
Chinese." In a subsequent communication, after comparison witb the Chinese k'i, 
a generic name for games played with pieces or men, Iscting A'i', "chess," and the 
Cantonese chuk Ut, "to play chess," he concludes that these resemblances indicate 
that the Malay and Javanese chuki, which is almost certainly of extraneous origin, 
is ultimately from the Chinese. 

And later he sends the following entry in which the word is associated with a 
Chinese form in the Amoy dialect. 

" Tjuli, 'a kind of draughts played with white and black beans' (Pijnappel, Op. 
cit. [Maleisch-HoUandsch woordenboek 2«= drukj I, 116); probably = Chinese tioh ki

{a) Board and men.-

players.' 
The board has 8 by 8 squares, 
each of which is divided into two 
parts by a diagonal line (fig. 
177). In the games now cur- 
rent in Japan there is a triangle at the top of the board two squares 
wide, with its apex resting upon the middle of the upper side. Six- 
teen men [musashi, "soldiers") are arranged at the sixteen points of 
intersection at the sides of the square 
with the Taisho, or General, in the cen- 
ter. Two play, the " General " striving 
to capture the "Soldiers," and the lat- 
ter to block him. 

The board and men appear to be an 
ex])ression of the same cosmical ideas 
as are found in the game of Nyout, there 
being four men associated with each 
side of the square. The traditions of 
the game still more closely identify it 
with the Korean Nyout. 

A Chinese form of the game is fig- 
ured and described by Dr. Karl Himly ^ 
under the name of Shap luJc Icon tseung

■* Another common Hindu game, said to be known throughout India, is called 
Pulijudam or " tiger game." Three "tigers" are placed on the board (tig. 182) at the 
points indicated by black spots. The other player has fifteen " lambs," which he lays 
down at the points of intersection, one by one, alternating with the move of a tiger. 
The tigers endeavor to Jump over and kill the lambs, and tlie latter to pen in the 
tigers.

In Peru a similar game is played on a board (fig. 183) under the name 
of Solitario. In Mexico a corresponding game (fig. 184) is called Coyote} 

In Siam we find the game of Sua ghin gnua, or "Tiger and Oxen" 
(fig. 185), and in Burma, Lay givet Icyah. 

There are three big tigers and eleven or some- 
times twelve little ones. The object is for the 
big tigers to hunt down on a draft board and eat 
the little ones. If, however, the cubs can corner 
the big ones and prevent them from taking a leap, 
the latter have to snccimib.'^

tlie opening of the game each player places six men in tlie oenter of 
the six squares at his side of the board. The latter usually consists of 
a slab of stone pecked with the diagram (tig. 187). The men consist of 
disks of pottery about 1 inch in diameter, made from broken vessels, 
those upon one side being distinguished by being perforated with a 
small hole, while those of the other side are plain. The object of the 
game is to cross over and take the opponent's jdace, capturing as many 
men as possible by the way. The moves are made one square at a time 
along the diagonal lines, the pieces being placed at the points of inter- 
section. When a player gets one of his opponent's pieces between two 
of his own it may be taken, and the first piece thus captured may 
be replaced by a seventh man, called the "Priest of the Bow/' which

THE GAME OP TO-TO-L6s-ri. 

Moki Indians, New Mexico. 

After an unpulilisheil drawing liy Dr. J. Walter Fewkes. 



Dr. J. Walter Fewkes^ has described a somewhat similar game as 
existing among the Moki Indians of jS"ew Mexico under the name of 
To-to-l6s-]n. It can be played by two or more parties. A rectangular 

'Disks roughly shaped from fragments of earthenware vessels were found by Mr. 
Clarence B. Moore in mounds of the Georgia Coast (Jour. Academy of Natural 
Sciences, Phila., XI), of which specimens contributed by him are contained in the 
Mnsoum of Arcbteology of the University of Pennsylvania (Cat. Nos. 20160-20162). 
They vary from 11 to 2 inches in diameter. Similar pottery disks, some perforated, 
are found in many localities in the United States. Mr. G. E. Laidlaw writes that 
large numbers of disks of stone and pottery are found in the ash beds of ancient 
village sites in Ontario, Canada, cast and northeast of Lake Simcoe. They arc sel- 
dom bored, and the pottery disks, which range from 1 inch to 2 inches in diameter, 
are made from shards, and have the original curve of the pot. They bear no mark- 
ings, and in a great majority of cases the edges are not ground smooth. He suggests 
their probable use in games. Pottery disks, all made from shards, some with central 
perforations, are found in Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina, and doubtless other South 
American sites.

figure (fig. 189), divided into a large number of squares, is drawn upon 
tlie rock, either by scratching or by using a different cohered stone as a 
crayon. A diagonal line, tifh-hi-o-ta, is drawn across the rectangle from 
northwest to southeast and the players station themselves at each end 
of this line. When two parties play, a single person acts as player 
and the other members of the party act as advisers. The first play is 
won by tossing a leaf or corn husk with one side blackened. The pieces 
which are used are beau or corn kernels, stones and wood, or small 
fragments of any substance of marked color. The players were sta- 
tioned at each end of the diagonal line, tuh-M-o-ta. They move their 
pieces upon this line, but never across it. (On this line the game is 
fought.) The moves which are made are intricate, and the player may 
move one or more pieces successively. Certain positions entitle him to 
this privilege. He may capture, or, as he terms it, kill one or more of 
his opponents at one play. In this respect the game is not unlike 
checkers, and to capture the pieces of the opponent seems to be the 
main object of the game. The checkers, however, must be concentrated, 
and always moved toward the southeast corner.^ 

This game is now rarely played on the East Mesa, but is still used at 
Oraibi. It is said to have been played in ancient times by the sun and 
moon or by other mythical personages. Figures of this game formerly 
existed on the rocks near the village of Walpi, and may be the same 
referred to by Bourke. 

Games resembling the above seem to have existed widely among the 
American tribes. Mrs. W. W. Brown ^ gives the following account of 
a game of the Wabanaki Indians : 

Ko-ko-nag'n has a resemblauce to the game of Checkers, but, although nearly all 
are more or less proficient at the latter game, there are only a few who understand 
ko-ko-nag'n. This, nulike any other game, may he played by male and female oppo- 
nents. It is the least noisy, the skillful play requiring deliberation and undivided 
attention. A smooth surface is marked off into different-sized spaces, and pieces of 
wood, round and square, marked to qualify value, are generally used, though some- 
times carved bone is substituted. 

This may be the game referred to by Easle among the Norridgewok 
Indians, where he says: " Un autre jeu oh Von place des grains sur des 
espece de lozanges entrelassees {dicitur) manmadoaiigaiU^ 



1 It would appear from Dr. Fewkes's sketch of the board that only one player 
moved toward the southeast and that his opponent went in the opposite direction.

CHEgS AND PLAYING-CARDS. 881 

The other priucipal chiss of arrow-derived g-aincs is tliat in which a 
number of staves, splints, or other substituted objects are shaken or 
divided at random, originally to determine j>/«r{ directly, or to discover 
the number and thence the place. Like the i)receding class, it is widely 
distributed throughout the world. The divinatory associations of these 
games are more clearly manifest to the writer than those in whicli the 
tossed staves or their substitutes are used, and the derivation of the 
iuiplements from arrows more easily demonstrable. 

An examination of the arrows used by savage people shows that the 
custom of marking them in such manner that each individual might 
distinguish his own was very general. From this, both in the Old and 
the New World, the arrow came to stand as the token and symbol of a 
man,' and as such, among many other symbolic uses, was employed in 
divinatory games. It appears that the marks of the arrows of the 
American Indians, which are placed upon the shaftments, refer not, it 
Avould seem, to the personal names of their owners, but to their owners' 
place in the system of classification according to the directions in the 
circuit of the clans. At a later period of development we find these 
cosmical marks replaced by the written name of the owner, as in East- 
ern Asia. Traces still survive, even here, as on the practice arrows of 
Korea (No. 78) of the earlier system. 

The method of nuirking in America is by means of colored bands 
(ribbons) painted upon the shaftments. It may be assumed that a 
quiver made up of the different arrows of the individuals of a tribe 
would represent the Four Quarters and the intermediary points. It is 
such perfect quivers and their conventionalized representatives that 
constitute the implements of magic em]>loyed in the games which follow. 
In connection with these there are exhibited several series of arrows, 
together with a variety of objects regarded by the writer as having been 
derived from the employment of arrows as symbols of personality. 

61. Tong-Kat. Korea. 

(a) Quiver of Ceremonial Arrows.^ Worn as an emblem of rank by 
Korean officials in military court-dress. 



' The 8yml)olism of the arrow was discussed l)y Mr. Gushing iu his A^ice-presideutial 
address before Section H of the American Association for the Advancement of Sci- 
ence, S])ringfield, 1895. According to him, "owner's marks, on arrows, were not 
designed primarily as signs of mere possession. They were indicative, rather, of 
the place in the cosmically arranged circuit of the tribe, of the man who made and 
possessed the arrows. It is probable that such marks were at first placed on arrows 
to serve as protective and directive potencies. By imparting somewhat of the man's 
personality to the arrows, their special aid to him was insured and at the same time 
their tiight was endowed with the breath or wind of the quarter to which he and 
they alike belonged. It naturally followed that, much as his face was recognizable 
as belonging to him, so were these arrows recognizable as essentially of his place 
and of him— so much so, that ceremonially they often stood for the man himself 
even more intimately than do our signatures stand for us." But the second part of 
this highly imi)ortaut paper, in which this was embodied, remains unpublished.

(h) Reproduction of native picture of Korean officials in military 
court-dress wearing quiver with arrows.^ 

The quiver exhibited has ten arrows, while in the native picture five 
arrows are represented as being worn. These are regarded by the 
writer as corresponding with the Five Directions, and as symbols of 
regnal or universal authority.^ They are worn by the King himself, as 
well as officers who receive orders from him. The actual arrows are 26 
inches in length, made of lacquered bamboo with white feathering and 
no points. The quiver is of Japanese leather ornamented with silver 
disks and sewed along the edges with colored silk.^ 

Chinese generals wear (or wore) a set of six arrows as an insignia of 
rank. A set of such arrows (Cat. No, 17686) in the Museum of the Uni- 
versity, picked up in August, 1894, on the field of A-San in Korea, three 
days after the battle, by Dr. E. B. Landis, are six in number (fig. 190). 
The shafts are of white wood, 37 inches in length, feathered with two

fastened in the shaftment with a wrapping of cherry-bark. They 
are painted in red with the twelve characters which stand as names for 
the Twelve Branches or Duodenary Cycle.^ These signs are used to

originally intended for divinatory puri)Oses.

Tally used to assemble members of the Chinese gamblers and vshop-

m China, where bamboo instead of varnished 
wood is used. This tally bears on one side the 
name of the gamblers' guild, and on the other 
the name of one of its members, with a blank for 
the insertion of the hour of the meeting, as 
occasion requires. The tallies are kept by a 
meuiber of the guild, who summons the members 
by sending each his tally. This constitutes the 
credentials of the person bringing it to the 
meeting. 

These tallies are direct descendants of the 
arrows used in more primitive conditions for the 
same purpose Their name, /sTw, is almost iden- 
tical with the Chinese name for arrow, and their 
form still retains a suggestion of their origin.

These cards may be regarded as belonging to the same family as the 
message tally, or arrow, with the name of a man. Like it they ceremo- 
nially stand for the individual whose name they bear, and as such are 
preserved as pledges and tokens, given each other by members of the 
same clan and their friends, for the year. The name lain means pri- 
marily a slip of bamboo "formerly used for making notes on."

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 



When a free-born Korean boy reaches the age of 15, he has a small wooden label cut, 
which he carries with him. This label is made of pear wood or mahogany, and is 
about 2 inches in length by i inch broad. It is inscribed in Chinese characters. 
Across the top is the name of the Poii (Chinese jjii) or ward to which the boy belongs. 
Then in a line below the designation han-ryanfj, " leisure fellow," that is, not in gov- 
ernment service, and the boy's name with the date of his birth. The date on which 
the label is made is cut on the reverse. This label must be sealed by an official of 
the treasury, who brands it with a hot iron and registers the boy's name and other 
particulars. When a boy enters the Tjin-sd (Chinese, tsiin s^'), he has another tablet 
cut, this time of boxwood, with bis proper title insteadof li(ni-ry(tng. Upon passing 
the military or civil examinations, the label is cut from black horn, and upon obtain- 
ing the first grade an ivory label is permitted. Since writing the above account, 
which was dictated by Mr. Pak Young Kin, Korean Charge d'Affaires at Washing- 
ton, I haA^e received from Dr. E. B. Landis, at Chemulpo, two specimens of ho-hpai

(figs. 192, 193), concerning which he gave the following particulars : " I have simply 
had reproductions made, as they are not in use since the war. They are, however, 
exact reproductions, with the exception of the magistrate's seal, which was always 
burnt on the back. At the top, reading from right to left, are the words Ton Hak and 
Han llyang. These refer to the class of society to which he belongs. The first is 
"Patrician" and the second "Plebeian." After this follows the name and surname 
and in the lower corner the year of birth. On the back is the year when the ho-hpai 
expires. It is renewed every three years. There is another kind called yo-hpai (Plate 
33), which was n.scd by the servants of the various officials as proof of identity when 
drawing their monthly wages, which was always paid in kind." Yo-hpai (Chinese, 
iup'di) is defined in the Diciionaire Corten Frangais as "plaque des soldats surlequelle 
leur nom est dcrit." The secret agents of the king in Korea, called E-sa (Chinese, 
ii s:'), used a plate of silver engraved with a horse as an emblem of their royal 
authority.

Analogous to these Korean objects are the tablets of authority carried by the Mon- 
gol princes, which arc described by Marco Polo (Plate 34). These -were of silver, 
silver gilt, and of gold, and were inscribed with a leyend commanding respect in 
the name of the Kaan. To this was added the figure of a lion, and below the sun and 
moon, while the highest lords received a tablet with gerfalcons. I have l)een led to 
refer to these I'dizah, which are so fully described and illustrated by Colonel Yule 
(Marco Polo, Book II, C. VII, Note 2), through their sug- 
gesting in connection with other objects a theory of the 
origin of the so-called "cash" or current money of China 
(fig. 194). Tlicse coins, which unifonnly bear the name of 
the regnal period, by which the sovereign is Ivuown to the 
world, may be regarded as having been, like the Pdizah, 
emblems of authority emanating from the sovereign. Spec- 
imens of Chinese bamboo money (Plate 35), similar in 
appearance to tlie Korean ho-hpai, occur in the Glover col- 
lection in the United States National Museum. 

In ancient China, accord- 
ing to the Book of History 
(Shu King, Sec. II), the 
nobles are described as hav- 
ing five kinds of scepters 

made of precious stones. Of these, the two lowest 
classes were round with a hole in the center and 
about 5 inches in diameter. A specimen in the United 
States National Museum (Cat. No. 130662, gift of 
Chang Yen Hoon, His Imperial Chinese Majesty's 
envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary) 
(Plate 36) is made of jade, and is of the kind desig- 
nated as luk pik, or "grain-besprinkled slab." 

We have in these scepters an ancient emblem of 
authoritj' corresponding in form to the coin. "When 
we examine the name of the latter, we find it to be 
ts'in, a word difli'ering but slightly from tsin, "arrow," 
from which I regard both the coin and tablet as 
having in all probability been derived. The charac- 
ter for ts'fn is written with the radical for "si)ear" 
doubled, with the radical for "metal" on the left. It 
differs in the substitution of metal for p' in, a "leaf" 
or "slip," from the character isin used in writing the 
name of the Korean playing cards, htou-ijyen (Chinese, 
tail tsin) (No. 77). 

Analogous to the Korean ho-hpai are the amulet 
bags {manwri hukiiro, protection bag), wJiicli Japanese 
childrtMi used to wear outside their dresses with a 
ticket containing their names and residences attached. 
"At a later period they are concealed; but all classes

The folding fan of China and Japan is not unlikely to have origi- 
nated from these tanzaku or writing slips, whicli the nobles carried in 
order to make memoranda when in the i)resence of the sovereign. The 

fan is constantly used for writing 
upon, one side originally being left 
blank for the purpose. In Japan 
a folding fan, ogl (fig. 202), formed 
an essential part of the ceremonial 
costume of a gentleman, and was 
carried in front in the belt. Refer-

The number of its bones or ribs is a 
matter wbicli is by no means left to 
chance. Sixteen, including the two 
outer pieces, may be quoted as the 
standard ; but fans made in certain localities have more, as many as thirty-two, and 
sometimes even thirty-six. The reason why the number sixteen is prei'erred is that 
such a fan opens into a convenient number of spaces to receive the poetical inscrip- 
tion, which custom has almost, but not altogether, tied down to a given number of 
lines.'

The sticks may vary in length 
from 2 to 14 inches, tlie set ex- 
hibited being 14 inches in length. 
The wooden prisms, which are 
usually made of shitan, or red 
sandalwood, have two contigu- 
ous sides plain and two marked 
with a transverse cut about 1 
inch wide, which is painted red 
(fig. 203). These blocks, called 
sangi, or "calculating sticks," 
are placed before the fortune- 
teller, parallel to each other and 
with their plain faces uppermost. 
The fortune teller takes the 
bundle of splints in his right 
hand and raises them reveren- 
tially to his forehead. He then 
places the ends in the palm of 
his left hand and shuffles them 
with a rotary motion (fig. 204). 
Taking the bundle in his right 
hand, he places one so that it 
projects between his little finger 
and his third finger (fig. 205). 
Dividing the remainder in two 
parts, he places one of the bun- 
dies between his middle finger 
and forefinger and the other be- 
tween his forefinger and thumb.

times as possible there will remain less than eight sticks. This re- 
mainder indicates the complement of the destined diagram according 
to the arrangement shown in fig. 200. 

The trigram indicated is then recorded by means of the sangi, the 
faces of the three nearest the fortune-teller being turned to correspond 
with the broken or unbroken lines of the trigram. The zeicliaku are 
then again manipulated and the three remaining sangi turned in tlie 
same manner to agree with the trigram designated by the count. The 
indication obtained from these two operations is then referred to the 
corresponding diagram in the Yili King or "Divination Classic," and 
the fortiine teller draws his conclusions from the text which explains 
it, aided by traditional interpretations. 

In this system of divination we have an illustration of the use of 
arrow-derived splints divided at random to determine the number, 
place being ascertained by counting around a diagram, the Pat Icwdj 
symbolic of the World Quarters. It is also practised at the iDresent

day in Korea and in China, having doubtless been derived both in 
Japan and Korea from China. It is described minutely in one of the 
appendices to the " Divination Classic." ^ According to the Chinese 
record, the stalks of a plant, the Pfarmica Siherica were used, those 
which grew on the grave of Confucius being most highly esteemed. 

The assumption that the zeichaku (Chinese, shai clmTc) - were originally 
arrows is based upon analogy, the arrow derivation of many similar 
objects employed in divination being clearly apparent. The sangi

M. C. do Harlez (Les Figures Symboliques dii Yi-King, Jouiiial Asiatique, New

by means of the splints affixed to the Manchu-Chinese edition of the Yik Kiruj of 
the Emperor Kien Ijung. A translation of the rules for divination with the sticks 
is given in Takashinia Elcidan, Tokio, 1893.

viving from or suggested by the two-faced staves, from which the 
diagrams origiuated. 

The above-described method of divination has a counterpart in the 
Chinese game of Fan Pan, or "repeatedly spreading out," which is 
played in the gambling houses established by the immigrants from 
China in many American cities. Fan Pan 
is played with aqnantityof Chinese brass 
" cash," for which buttons and other small 
objects are sometimes substituted. These 
take the place of the splints or geichalcu. 
The dealer covers a handful of these cash, 
taken at random from the pile, with a brass 
cup.^ The players lay their wagers on the 
four sides of a square, numbered "one," 
" two," " three," and " four." The dealer 
then divides off the " cash" under the cwp 
by fours, using for the purpose a tapering 
rod^ of teak wood, about 18 inches in 
length. When all the fours are counted 
off, the winner is determined by the num- 
ber remaining.' In these operations we 
have the random partition of "cash" 
substituted for that of splints, and the 
square with its four numbered sides (cor- 
responding with the Four Quarters) for the 
Pat Jiivd or "Eight Trigrams" around 
which the splints are counted. 

Analogous also to the Chinese and Jap- 
anese method of divination with splints 
is the Malagassy Silddy, Sb system of 
fortune-telling in conuuon use in Mada- 
gascar, in which beans, rice, or other small 
objects that can be easily counted or 
divided, are employed. A quantity of 

beans are placed in a heap, and from these a handful is taken at ran- 
dom. From this handful the diviner withdraws first two, then two 
more, and so on successively until two only are left, or, it may be, the 
odd number, one. The process is repeated and the remainders, one or 
two, are marked in tables of squares, from which the determinations 
are afterwards made. 

The method of marking down, by means of one or two dots, is iden- 
tical with that frequently employed in divining with the splints. The 
process is repeated four times, one of sixteen combinations being

lu order to explain the Malagassy names, which in part at least are 
Arabic, M. Steiuschneider' gives a table, compiled from a Hebrew 
lot book in Munich, with the Arabic, Hebrew, Latin, and Berber desig- 
nations of these combinations of dots. The figures, he states, are 
supposed to represent the astrological "houses" connected with the 
planets. They are distinguished as male and female — a distinction 
which we may assume exists in the single and double dots, as in the 
unbroken and broken lines. Steiuschneider assumes that this sup- 
posed Arabic science was transplanted by scholars like Abraham ibn 
Essa and Jehuda al-Charisi, who traveled from Spain in Europe and 
the Orient in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, through so called 
lot books into Hebrew.

A method of fortune telling, based upon the sixteen combinations of 
single and double dots, taken four at a time, worked by means of a 
table not unlike tliat employed in sikkhj, is to be found in a popular 
handbook entitled, "The Gypsy Dream Book and Fortune Teller," 
M. J. Ivers & Co., New York, under the title of "The Oraculum; or, 
Napoleon Buonaparte's Book of Fate." 

The diagrams or dot combinations: . . • etc., are discovered by 
making four rows of dots at random .* '. *. and afterwards count- 
ing them, even yielding . . and odd . ' 

Eeviewing the references in the Greek and Roman classics to divin- 
atory practices with rods resembling those above described, there is to 
be found in Ammianus Marcellinus^ the following 
account of the custom of the Alani: 

They predict the future in a marvelous way. They take 
straight rods of osier, and, separating them with certain 
secret charms at a fixed time, they know clearly what is 
meant. ^ 

Herodotus relates : 

Scythia has an abundance of soothsayers, who foretell the 
future by means of a number of willow wands. A large 
bundle of these wands is brought and laid on the ground. 
The soothsayer unties the bundle and places each waud by 
itself,-' at the same time uttering his prophecy. Then, while 
he is still speaking, he gathers the rods together again, and 
makes them up once more into a bundle. This mode of 
divination is of home growth in Scythia. * 

The latter account does not agree except so far as 
concerns the bundle of rods, but almost exact par- 
allels to the zeichaltU, both in luimber and method 
of manipulation, are to be found among many abo- 
riginal tribes in America. A resume of the descrip- 
tions given by the early writers is furnished in that 
admirable paper on " Indian Games " by Mr. Andrew ^""" '^""''" *^^™'''"

under the caption of "Straw or ludiau Cards," from wbicli 1 have 
extracted the following : 

To play the game a number of straws or reeds uniform In size and of equal length 
were required. They were generally from 6 to 10 iuclies long. The number used in 
the game was arbitrary. Lawson puts it at fifty-one, Charlevoix at two hundred and 
one. The only essential points were that the numbers should be odd and that there 
should be enough of them so that when the pile was divided into two parts, a glance 
would not reveal which of the two divisions contained the odd number of straws. 
In its simplest form the game consisted in separating the heap of straws into two 
parts, one of whicli each player took, and he whose pile contained the odd number 
of straws was the winner. Before the division was made the straws were subjected 

to a manipulation, somewhat after 
the manner of shuffling cards. They 
were then placed upon the deerskin 
or upon whatever other article was 
selected as a surface on which to play. 
The player who was to make the di- 
vision into two heaps, with many con- 
tortions of the body and throwing 
about of the arms, and with constant 
utterances to propitiate his good luck, 
would make a division of the straws 
with a pointed bone or some similar 
^ instrument,' himself taking one of the 

^^.Ok '\h/ >^^X< divisions while his adversary took the 

>^ >^^ — -^ «— ^ ^^^ ^* other. They would then rapidly sep- 

arate the straws into parcels nuinber- 
Nbl*'?^ ^°o *®o each, and determine from the 

6 fractional remainders who had the

the lookerson, and the fact that the 
counting was done by tens is almost invariably mentioned. Between two people 
betting simply on the odd number no further rules were necessary. To determine 
which had the heap containing the odd number, there was no need to foot up the 
total number of tens. It was to be settled by what was left over after the last pile 
of complete tens was set aside. The number itself might be either one, three, five, 
seven, or nine. In the more complicated forms of the games this led to giviug differ- 
ent values to these numbers, the nine being always supreme and the one on which 
the highest bets were wagered. It was generally understood that the holder of this 
number swept the board, taking all bets on other numbers as well as those on nine. 
It was easy to bet beads against beads and skins against skins in a simple game of 
odd or even, but when the element of dilferent values for different combinations was 
introduced some medium of exchange was needed to relieve the complications. 




'An explanation is here suggested for the origin of the familiar game of jack- 
straws, in which a bundle of splints allowed to fall at random iu a pile are separated 
one by one without disturbing the others. Mr. E. W. Nelson informs me that a 
game identical with jackstraws is played by the Eskimo of Norton Sound on the 
Yukon River, Alaska. The sticks, which are made of spruce or cottonwood, or any 
ordinary driftwood, are about the size of a match, squared, and about four inches 
in length. Those he collected for the U. S. National Museum were tied with a cord 
in a bundle of about one hundred. The sticks each have the same value. They are 
separated by means of a slender stick a little longer than the others. Another 
method of using these sticks is to lay the bundle on the back of the baud, toss them

stones of fniit were employed, just as chips or counters arc used in modern gambling 
games, and a regular bank was practically instituted. Each player took a certain 
number of these counters as the equivalent of the value of the merchandise which he 
proposed to hazard on the game, whether it was a gun, a Idanket, or some other 
article. Here We have all the machinery of a regular gambling game at cards, but 
the resemblance does not stop 
here. The players put up 
their bets precisely as they 
now do in a game of faro, se- 
lecting their favorite number 
and fixing the amount, meas- 
ured in the standard of the 
game, which they wish to haz- 
ard. "By the side of the 
straws, which are on the 
ground, are found the {grains) 
counters," says Perrot, 
"which the players have bet 
on the game.'' In another 
place the method of indicat- 
ing the bets is stated as fol- 
lows: "'He (meaning the one 
who has bet) is also obliged to 
make two other heaps. In 
one he will place five, in the 
other seven straws, with as 
many {grains) counters as he 
pleases. * * * Compli- 
cated rules determined when 
the players won or lost, when 
the bets were to be doubled, 
and when they were to abide 
the chance of another count. 
The loser at the game, even 

after all he had with him was gone, was sometimes permitted to continue the game 
on his promise to pay. If ill luck still pursued him the winner could refuse him 
credit and decline to play for stakes that he could not see. The game often lasted 
several days, one after another relieving his comrades at the play until one of the

into the air, and catch them on the palm. If the player succeeds in grasping them 
all he lays one splint aside and tries again. 

The antiquity of the game of jackstraws in India appears to be illustrated by a 
passage in the Tevigga Sutta (The Magghima Silam, i ; The Sacred Books of the East, 
XI, Oxford, 1881, p. 193) in a list of games detrimental to the progress of virtue. 
"That is to say, with a board of sixty-four squares, or one hundred squares ; tossing 
up; removing substances from a heap without shaking the remainder." 

In Canton, China, children use splints from burnt punk sticks {heung Ic'eiiJc, litei'- 
aily, "incense feet"), one hundred being held in a bunch and allowed to fall, the 
players endeavoring to remove them one at a time from the pile without disturbing 
the others, using another stick bent over at the end for the purpose. They call the 
game fid heuiifi k'ettk. The Chinese at Canton make carved jackstraws, but I am 
informed by Chinese merchants that they are sold only for export. A set in the 
University Museum (Cat. No. 16221) (Plates 38, 39) consists of forty-two pieces, 
twenty small pointed sticks, twenty miniature weapons and implements, and two 
hooks for removing the splints. They are made of sandal wood, 4i inches in length, 
and their name is given by the venders as heung Vo pat ph.

two sides had lost everything. * * * The game of straw," says Perrot,' from 
whose accouut we have made the foregoing digest, "is ordinarily held in the cabins 
of the chiefs, which are large, and are, so to speak, the Academy of the Savages." 

Lawson^ describes it, but in slightly modified form, as follows: 

"Indian Cards. — Their chiefest game is a sort of Arithmetick, which is managed 
by a parcel of small split reeds, the thickness of a small Bent. These are made very 
nicely, so that they part, and are tractable in their hands. They are fifty-one in 
number, their length about 7 inches. When they play, they throw part of them to 
their antagonist. The art is to discover, upon sight, how many yon liave, and what 
you throw to him that plays with you. Some are so expert at their numbers that 
they will tell ten times together what they throw out of their hands. Although the 
whole play is carried on with the quickest motion it is possible to use, yet some are 
so expert at this game as to win great Indian Estates by this Play. A good set of 
these reeds fit to play withal are valued and sold for a dressed doe-skin." 

The first game described by Roger Williams^ in his Chapter on Gaming is "a game 
like nnto the English Cards, yet instead of Cards they play with strong Rushes." 
In his vocabulary he gives "Akesuog: they are at cards, or telling Rushes; Pissinue-

ganasli: their playing Rushes; Ntakhemin : I am a telling or counting; for their 
play is a kind of Arithmatick." Straehey foand this game among the Indians in Vir- 
ginia. He describes it as follows: "Dice play, or cardes, or lotts, they know not, 
how be it they use a game npon rushes much like primero, wherein they card and 
discard and lay a stake or two, and so win or lose." 

Mr. Davis cites other references to the game by Fathers Brebeuf,* Boucher,^ 
Lafitau,'' Charlevoix,^ and Beverly,** none of which throw any additional light upon it.

CHESS AND PLAYING-CARDS. 897 * 

About fifteen years ago the late Rev. J. Owen Dorsey gave the fol- 
lowing- account of a corresponding game among the Omaha: ' 

Ja"-(|;tiwii, Stick -counting, is played by any nuruber of persons with sticks made of 
deska or sidnhi. These sticks are all placed in a heap, and then the players, in 
succession, take up some of them in their hands. The sticks are not counted until 
they have been taken up, and then he who has the lowest odd number always wins. 
Thus, if one player had five, another three, and a third only one, the last must be 
the victor. The highest number that anyone can have is nine. If ten or more 
sticks have been taken those above nine do not count.- 

liight is thrown upon the origin and significance of these games in 
America by the account of the Tiyotipi of the Daliota, by Stephen R. 
Riggs.'' ''The exponent of the Phratry was the ' Tiyotipi,' or ' Soldiers' 
Lodge.' Its meaning is the ' Lodge of Lodges.' There were placed 
the bundles of black and red sticks of the soldiers. There the soldiers 
gathered to talk and smoke and feast. There the laws of the encamp- 
ment were enacted." Describing the lodge, he says: 

A good fire is blazing inside, and we may just lift up the skin-door and crawl in. 
Toward the rear of the tent, but near enough for convenient use, is a large pipe 
placed by the symbols of ])Ower. Tlier*- are two bundles of shaved sticks about 6 
inches long. The sticks in one bundle arc painted black and in the other red. The 
black bundle represeuts the real men of the camp — those who have made their mark 
on the warp.ith. The red bundle represents the boys and such men as wear no eagle 
feathers. 

Again he says: 

Then of all the round-shaved sticks, some of which were painted black and some 
l)ainted red, four are especially marked. They are the four chiefs of the Tiyotipi 
that were made. And these men are not selected at random for this place; but men 
who have killed many enemies and are most able are chosen. 

In conclusion, Mr. Riggs adds: 

The special making of the sticks is done on the line of personal history. What- 
ever is indicated by the kind of eagle feathei«s a man is entitled to wear in his head, 
and by the notches in them, this is all hieroglyphed on his stick in the Tiyotipi. 
Then these bundles of sticks are used for gambling. The question is, "Odd or 
even?" The forfeits are paid in meat for the Tiyotipi. 

This highly suggestive account reveals the splints or straws of the 
American games as derived from the ceremonial emblems of the war- 
riors of the tribe. The identity of the sjilints with the Haida gambling- 
sticks (No. 70), both in number and method of use, is clearly apparent. 

'Omaha Sociology, Third Annual Report Bureau of Ethnology, Washington, 1884, 
p. 338. 

-Mr. Francis Le Fleche mentioned an Omaha game to the writer under the name 
of Zanekidd^, as played with sticks or straws, fifty-two in all. "It is pretty much 
like card-playing." Miss Alice C. Flecker writes me that "the true name of the game 
is zfhon-iti-Dki-de. This is an old word, and not a descriptive name, whereas the 
name given by Mr. Dorsey is a descriptive name and only sometimes used to desig- 
nate tliis game. The name givcTi by Mr. Dorsey, zhon-dha-a'ci, is composed of zohn, 
"wood," and <Z/((/-)(7(, "to count."

notes its mark uiDon a piece 
of paper. Another splint is 
then drawn, and the result 
written down just above the

obtained. The combination 
is interpreted with the aid of

method of fortune-telling the diagram indicating place is determined by 
the repeated selection of the chance-arrows.

2 Among the Chinese in the United States the God of War is invariably appealed 
to in using these lots. They are placed njion the little ledge, or altar before hi.s 
shrine (Plate 40), which is maintained practically for the purpose of such divination. 
With the splints are invariably two elliptical pieces of wood, lean piii (fig. 212), 
rounded on one side and flat on the other, usually made of the root stock of the 
bamboo. The inquirer, after making th«i usual sacrifices, throws the blocks to

These instruments, taken in connection with a set of arrows worn by 
a Chinese general, described on page 882, serve to make clear the refer- 
ence in Ezekiel xxi, 21, where Nebuchadnezzar, at the parting of two 
ways, uses divination with arrows to decide whether he shall proceed 
against Jerusalem or Eabbah.'

Analogous to the tsHm U was the Meisir game of the heathen Arabs, 



ascertain whether the time is propitious for divination with the tsHm U. In tossing 
the blocks, if both fall with their curved sides uppermost the indication is a negative 
one, neither good or evil; if both fall Avith the flat sides itppermost the indication 
is unfavorable ; if one falls with the curved side uppermost and the other the reverse 
the indication is good. It is customary to throw the blocks until they fall three 
times alike iu succession. 

' "For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the ways, at the head of two 
ways, to use divination. He shook the arrows to and fro, he consulted the teraphim,

ill which marked arrows were shaken from a quiver. Ten or eleven 
arrows were used, of which seven were marked. They were made of 
the wood of a particuhir tree, and were of a yellow color. The seven 
marked arrows which had distinguishing notches on the shaftment 
were each designated by a name. 

A very conijjlete account of the game is given by Dr. Anton Hiiber/ 
of which an extract is to be found in Korean Games, XXXIII.

It should be observed that the term al maisar {meisir) is now under- 
stood to include all games of chance or hazard.^ The heathen Arabs 
were accustomed to divine by means of arrows in a manner similar to 
the Meisir, of which an account is found in the Preliminary Discourse 
to Sale's Koran.' 



'tJber das Meisir genaunte Spiel der heidnischen Araber, Leii)zig, 1883. 

^Hughes' Dictionary of Islam. 

■'Another practice of the idolatrous Arabs, forbidden also in one of tbe above- 
mentioned passages (Koran, Chap. V), was that of divining by arrows. The arrows 
used by them for this purpose were lilse those with which they cast lots, being with- 
out heads or feathei-s, and were kept in the temple of some idol, in whose presence 
they were consulted. Seven such arrows were kept at the temple of Mecca, but 
generally in divination they made use of three only, on one of which was written, 
"My Lord hath commanded me ; " on another, '' My Lord hatli forbidden me," and the 
third was lilank. If the former was drawn, they looked upon it as an approbation 
of the enterprise; if the second, they made a contrary conclusion; but if the third 
happened to be drawn, they mixed them and drew them over again. These divining 
arrows were generally consulted before anything of moment was undertaken, as 
when a man was about to marry, or about to go on a journey. (The Preliminary 
Discourse, Sec. V.) 



902 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

While the Chinese lots at the present day are inscribed simply with 
a number referring to the corresj)onding pages of a book (as No. 70), 
in which is to be found both the oracle and its explanation, it is not 
unlikely that the oracle was originally engraved or written upon the 
lot itself, such lots being the natural outcome from tlie engraved or 
painted arrow shaftment, from which I assume they were derived. An 
explanation of the origin of the sortes of the Romans is naturally sng- 
gested. The sortes were little tablets or counters of wood, or other 
materials, upon each of which some rough verse or poverb was writ- 
ten. After they had been mixed together a boy would draw one at 
random, which was then taken as an omen.' Cicero^ describes the 
Sortes at Prseneste as being engraved in ancient characters on oak, 
and kept in a chest of olive wood.

should play. Kept in Chinese shrines of the God of War in China and 
the United States for the convenience of gamblers. 

These lots, which are used ceremonially to divine the lucky numbers, 
are doubtless survivals from the time when such lots were actually 
used in the drawings. In Korea, lotteries called San-htong, appear to 
be a distinct outcome from the ki/ei, or money lending clubs. In the 
latter a hundred men each contribute a certain sum monthly, the draw, 
ings being made with numbered wooden balls, which are shaken from 
a globular wooden box, san-htong.^ The lotteries are drawn in the 
same manner, and it should be observed that the name of the box, 
san-htong, is the Chinese tsHni fmig, applied to the lot-arrows in their 
quiver. The globular box and numbered balls are analogous to the 
Italian lottery, in which numbered balls (No. 74) are shaken from a 
bottle-shaped basket.

evident makeshift for the appliance described in the text.

One name is selected avS the winning one before each drawing, and 
the players who guess it receive thirty times the amount of their bet. 
Below each of the proper names on the chart are the names of vari- 
ous animals, common occupations, of noted characters in the popular 
romances and histories, and of miscellaneous objects, such as "jade," 
"a corpse," and the "Tutelary Spirit." This heterogeneous collection, 
wliich somewhat resembles the list of objects in the dream books sold 
in our shops for the use of "policy" players, 
is employed by gamblers for a similar pur- 
pose. The picture of a man, marked with 
thirty-six names at various parts of his 
body, forms part of the same scheme. This 
employment is secondary to another pur- 
pose. Before drawing the lottery, the man- 
ager distributes among the players copies 
of an enigma (fig. 215), which must contain 
some demonstrable reference to the name 
written under the proper name selected for 
the day, or to the part of the body upon 
which that name is written. These enig- 
mas are written in metrical form, and are 
composed as required by the writer of the 
lottery. He endeavors to mislead the play- 
ers, but is obliged to give a satisfactory 
explanation of the connection between his 
verses and the name displayed.' 

For an explanation of the symbolism of the 
thirty six names and of the T^ung yan, or 
"composite man," as the picture of the man 
is called, we need but to refer to the concept 
of totality which underlies the arrow-(j[uiver 
with its symbols of all the quarters.

Madrid, Spain. 
These balls (fig. 216) made of boxwood, 
are numbered from one to ninety. Their probable origin is suggested 
by the Korean san-htong, as described on page 902. The resemblance 
of these strung balls to a rosary has suggested to the writer that 
that object may have had a similar origin and cosmical symbolism.

(ft) Plaster cast of stick, showing carved figure of beaver. Copy of 
one of set in the United Stales National Museum- (Plate 41), Haida 
Indians, Queen Charlotte Islands, British Columbia. 

Mr. James G. Swan^ 
gives the following ac- 
count of the method of 
play : 

The Haida use sticks or 
pieces of wood 4 or 5 inches 
long and beautifully polished. 
They are made of yew, and 
each stick has some designat- 
ing mark upon it. There is 
one stick entirely colored aud 
one entirely plain. Each 
phiyer will have a bunch of 
forty or fifty of these sticks, 
aud each will select either of 
the plain sticks as his favorite, 
just as in backganmion or 
checkers the players select 
the black or white pieces. The 
Indian about to play takes up 
a handful of these sticks, and, 
putting them under a quantity 
of finely separated cedar bark, 
which is as fine as tow and kept constantly near him, he divides the pins into two 
parcels, which he wraps up in the bark, and passes them rapidly from hand to hand 
Tinder the tow, and finally moves them round on the ground or mat on which the 
players are always seated, still wrapped in the line bark, but not covered by the 
tow. His opponent watches every move that is made from the very first with the 
eagerness of a cat, and finally, by a motion of his finger, indicates which of the par- 
cels the winning stick is in. The player, upon such indication, shakes the sticks out 
of the bark, and, with much display aud skill, throws them one by one into the 
space between the players till the piece wauted is reached, or else, if it is not there, 
to show that the game is his. The winner takes one or more sticks from his oppo- 
nent's pile, and the game is decided when one wins all the sticks of the other. 

Dr. Franz Boas,"* in his Report of the Northwestern Tribes of Canada, 
1895, gives the following account of the methods of play among the 
Niskk4 (Chimmesyan) : 

Qaan. — Guessing game, played with a number of maple sticks marked with red or

game is to guess in which of the two bundles of sticks, which iire wrapped in cedar 
bark, the trump is hidden. Each player uses one trump only. 

Another ai^pareutly similar game he describes as follows: 
MaUqd'n. — About thirty small maple sticks are divided into four or five lots of 
unequal numbers. After a first glance one of the players is blindfolded, the others 
change tbe order of the lots, and the first player must guess how many sticks are 
now in each lot. When he guesses right in three, four, or five guesses out of ten — 
according to the agreement of the ])layer8 — he has won. 

The sets of sticks are almost uniformly contained in a leather pouch, 
with a broad flap, to which a long thong is attached, passing several 
times around the pouch and having a pointed strip of bone, horn, or 
ivory at the end. The latter is slipped under the thong as a fastening. 
These sticks, which are used by several of the tribes of the northwest 
coast of America, are probably simply conventionalized shaftments of 
arrows, as will be seen by comparing them with the arrows of the 
McCloud Eiver Indians (N^o. 75). Fig. 217 represents the cut shaftment 
of an actual arrow, still bearing bands of red paint, found among the 
debris of a clitf dwelling in Mancos Canyon, which Mr. Gushing regards 
as having been intended for a game in the manner of the sticks.

Museum of Archjeology, University of Pennsyh'ania. 

From the account of the sticks used among the Dakota (p. 897), to 
which the Northwest Coast sticks are analogous, it seems probable that 
each stick in a set stands, or originally stood, for a warrior of the 
tribe. It will be seen from the sticks collected by Lieutenant Emmons 
that they are designated by what api)ear to be the names of thegentes. 
Comparison of the sticks herein described show that no two sets are 
exactly alike,' a variation whicli, under the circumstances, would be 
natural. Through the courtesy of Dr. Franz Boas, of the American 
Museum of Natural History, New York City, I am able to give the fol- 
lowing list of two sets of sticks'- in that museum, collected and labeled 
by Lieut. George T. Emmons, U. S. N., which are of the highest impor- 
tance in their study. By reference to Gibb's Vocabularies, it appears 
they were obtained from the Taku tribe of the Koluschan family, occu- 
pying Taku Inlet, Alaska. ' Tliey are catalogued under the name of 
Alh-lcar, from Sitka. 



' There is a general agreement in the red and black ribbons, but the number and 
arrangement of these varies on the sticks in each set. Several sticks marked alike 
frequently occur, as in the named seta collected by Lieutenant Emmons. All of the 
painted sets contain sticks like those in these two sets. 

-My attention was called to these sticks by my friend Mr. Cushing, who kindly 
placed his drawings of them at my disposal.

918 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

The carved gambling-sticks furnish a suggestion as to the probable 
origin of the seal cylinder such as was used in ancient Babylonia. 
Cylindrical stamps of unglazed pottery, pierced with a hole like the 
seal-cylinder of Asia, are found in various parts of America. Such a 
stamp from Ecuador, bearing a highly conventionalized device of a bird 
(Plate 41, fig. 3), might readily have been derived from a carved arrow- 
shaftment, and it is reasonable to believe that the Babyhmian seal, 
often bearing devices of animals, and the carved gambling-stick, the 
emblem and symbol of a man, should have had a similar origin.^ 

The set of American Indian gambling sticks may be regarded as the 
antitype of the pack of playing-cards, to which, as will appear from 
the Korean htou-tjyen (No. 77), they directly lead. 
77. Htou-tjyen. Playing-Cards.^ Korea. 

[a) Pack of eighty cards. 

[h) Reproduction of native pictures: gamblers playing Htou-tjyen.^ 
(Plate 44.) 

The cards consist of strips of oiled paper S inches long by ^ inch 
wide. The backs are uniformly marked with the scroll a.s represented 
on fig. 218. The cards are divided into eight suits as follows (tig. 219): 

Sa-riim (Chinese, jian), "man." 
MouJ-lco-M (Chinese, U), "fish." 
Ea-ma-koui (Chinese, li), "crow." 
Eloueng (Chinese, chi), "pheasant." 
Ko-ro (Chinese, ch^ung), "antelope." 
Fyel (Chinese, sing), "star." 
Htok-ki (Chinese, t'6), "rabbit." 
Mdl (Chinese, md), " horse. "^ 

The cards of each suit are distinguished by numerals from 1 to 9 
(fig. 220), the tenth card being designated as tji/ang, "General." (Plate 
44.) A variety of games are played with the cards in Korea, the games 
in general resembling those played with cards in China. At the present 
day a pack usually consists of forty to sixty cards of four or six suits 
instead of eight, and the suit marks are not represented upon the 
numeral-cards, as cards of all suits have precisely the same value in 
the commonest game. 

1 Korean Games, p. xxxii. It is gratifying to the writer that his theory of the origin 
of the seal-cylinder should have received such ready accei)tance and confirmation by 
his colleague, Prof. Herman V. Hilprecht, of the University of Pennsylvania. In his 
Old Babylonian Inscriptions (I, Pt. 2, Philadelphia, 1896, p. 36), hewrites : "It becomes 
novr very evident that the Babylonian seal-cylinder, with its peculiar shape and use, 
has developed out of the hollow shaft of an arrow marked with symbols and figures, 
and is but a continuation and elaboration in a more artistic form of an ancient primi- 
tive idea."

^ These suit marks may be regarded as the symbols of the Eight Directions, and 
agree somewhat closely, though evidently earlier, with the Eight Creatures : Horse, 
Ox, Dragon, Fowl, Swine, Pheasant, Dog, Goat, associated with the Eight Diagrams.

The Eight "General" Cards. 

Korea. 
Cat. No. 77047, U.S.N.M. From Korean Games. 



CHESS AND PLAYING-CARDS. 



919 



The origin and significance of Korean playing-cards are revealed 
both by their designs and by their name. The lat- 
ter, htoH-tji/en, is the Chinese tatt t,sm, meaning "fight- 
ing tablets," tsin being a narrow slip intended to 
write on. Examining the reverse of the cards (fig. 
218) the device is seen to represent the feather of 
an arrow. Comparison of the eighty cards with the 
eighty arrowderived lots shows their practical iden 
tity, and we may conclude that tlie cards are highly 
conventionalized shaftments of arrows, retaining in 
their suit marks the same symbolism as that of the 
quiver of arrows from which they were derived. The 
Japanese niikuji, or "temple-lots" (No. 68), no doubt 
illustrate, both in form and material, an earlier 
stage of the present paper cards. Mr. Wilkinson 
informed me that the Koreans say that the "tens" 
or "General" cards once bore pictures, more or less 
carefully drawn, of the various emblems portrayed, 
of which the present scrawls are declared to be cor- 
ruptions. This would seem to carry back, directly, 
the cards toward the type represented by tlie carved 
gambling-stick (No. 76 h). 

Of the Korean games with cards, which are de- 
scribed in detail in " Korean Games," the most com- 
mon one is similar to the American Indian game of 
Straw (p. 804). Its name is Yet-pang- matig-i,^ 

The cards are shuffled, as is customary, by the 
dealer, who divides the pack into two parts. These 
he holds at the top in each hand, drawing the ends 
of the cards, which lay side by side, through each 
other; or, the cards are drawn out near the bottom 
and put upon the top. 

One pack is used in this game and any number may 
play. The gamekeeper, Moul-tjyou^' deals a card 
face down to each player, including himself, always 
drawing the cards from the bottom instead of from 
the top. The players have all put down their wagers, 
which have been covered by corresponding amounts 
by the Moul-tjyou. The object of the game is to 
get two or three cards upon which the sum of the

most popular game Sometimes the same player holds the bank for three rounds, 
sometimes for five. The game is a favorite with the Korean sharper, who will 
abstract an extra card or, if dealer, will place a tjyang and a kou (nine) where they 
will fall to himself. — Wilkinson.

each wius au amount equal to their stakes from him. When both count 
aliif e, neither wins. Three cards having the same number count higher 
than nine. It will be observed that in this game the suit-marks do not 
appear to be regarded, and it is to be inferred that the packs of forty 
and sixty cards, without suit-marks, are used for it. 

78. Practice Aruows.' Korea. Three from a set of five. 

Tlie arrows used at the present day in archery (Plate 46). They are 
called youyep-tjyen (Chinese, lau ip tsin), "willow-leaf arrows," and are 
made of bamboo, 34 Inches in length. The point is of iron, nail-shaped, 
with a stop which tits against the fore-shaft. The latter is usually made 
of cherry wood, with or without the bark on, and is about 1| inches in 
length. The footing, also of cherry wood, has a cylindrical nock with 
a U-shaped notch. The feathers, three in number, are carefully and 
uniformly trimmed and are fastened with glue; on some, in a straight 
line, and on others, at a slight angle to the shaft. These arrows usually 
bear the personal name of the owner, written in Chinese characters, 
between the feathers. All of these arrows are numbered with Chinese 
characters, from one to five below the shaftment.^ 

These arrows are shown to illustrate the probable source of the 
Korean playing-cards, which, however, doubtless originated long before 
the art of writing was perfected. It will be observed that the arrows 
are numbered in sets of five, while the cards are in suits of tens. In the 
tong-Mi, or ceremonial <]uiver (No. 01), there are ten arrows, however, 
and the feathers on these arrows have black tips, which seem to be per- 
petuated in the feather- like marks on the backs of the cards. 

79. Playing-Cards.'' Kiu Kiang, China. 

Nine cards of the suit of man, or "myriads" (Plate 47), from a set 
consisting of four packets of thirty cards each, and five jokers : the Five 
Blessings, FuTi:, Luk, Shau, Hi, Ts^oi, "Happiness, Promotion, Long life. 
Posterity, and Wealth." The four packets are like those of the succeed- 
ing cards (No. 80). 

It is probable that Chinese i)laying-cards, of which there are several 
kinds, take their form from the narrow Korean cards. The cards with 
money-symbols seem to be in the direct line of descent, if not from 
cards of which the Korean are survivals, at least from cards of the 
same character and origin. These particular cards are shown (Plate 47) 
to illustrate the index marks on the ends (of common occurrence on the 
cards of this type), which may be survivals of the numerals on the 
Korean cards (fig. 220). Mr. Cashing regards these numerals as likely 
to have been derived from the cut cock feathers of the original arrows. 
Mr. Wilkinson, on the other hand, considers them to be modifications 
of Chinese numerals.

counted, accordiuy- to certain combinations of two or more cards, which 
a player may make either with the cards originally dealt him or with 
three taken up. These combinations are called yaku or "prizes." They 
are reckoned as equivalent to one or more lacan of twelve points. The 
counts are extremely numerous and complicated, and there are several 
varieties of the game. For a detailed account consult " Korean Games."'

by superior finish, both in painting and lacquer. While the colors of the

type. Such is not the case with the following packs in the University 
Museum, which bear Hindu emblems representing the ten avatars of 
Vishnu, from which they are known as the dasavatara mulu, or the 
Game of the Ten Incarnations. 

One pack (Oat. No. 19135) consists of one hundred and twenty lac 
quered disks of cardboard, 4i inches in diameter, with plain red backs, 
and faces painted with suit-marks on grounds of different colors. There 
are ten suits of twelve cards each, consisting of ten numerals and two 
court-cards. The court-cards bear representations of the ten avatars 
of Vishnu, one of the two of each suit having a single figure, and the 
other the same figure in a kind of temple, with two attendants (figs. 
221-224). The marks of the numerals are as follows; 

1. Malay d, the fish. Fish, black. 

2. Kurma, the tortoise. Tortoise, brown. 

3. Varah, the boar. Conch, dark greeu. 

4. iViara-AS'lm/ia, the man-liou. Flower,' blue. 

5. Vamana, the dwarf. Lota,- blue.

7. Edmd-Chandra. Arrow, red. 

8. Krishna. Pestle, green. 

9. Buddha. Lotus flower, yellow. 

10. Kalkind, the "white horse." Sword, red. 

Another pack (Cat. No. 19156) in the same museum, 3|^ inches in 
diameter, corresxJonds in number, the emblems also referring to the 
ten avatars. The colors and suit marks vary somewhat in order from 
the preceding. 

1. Matsyd. Fish, red. 

2. Eurma. Tortoisej red. 

3. Varah. Boar, yellow. 

4. Nara-Simha. Lion, green. 

5. Vamana. Lota, green.

7. Bdmd- Chandra. Bow and arrow, yellow. 

8. Krishna. Disk,^ brown. 

9. Buddha. Conch, black. 
10. KalMnd. Sword, black. 

Another pack (Cat. No. 16585/"), 3 inches in diameter, incomplete, 
agrees with the preceding. 

Another pack (Cat. No. 165856), 3 inches in diameter, also incom- 
plete, apparently has eight suits, of which the first, third, fifth, sixth, 
eighth, and ninth agree with the preceding. In addition there is a 
green suit on which the marks are small yellow rectangles bearing the 
legend sriga.

Another pack (Cat. l^To. 16585c), 3 j^g inches in diameter, incomplete, 
has six suits: first, third, fifth, seventh, eighth, and ninth, agreeing- 
with Cat. No. 19156. 

Two other packs (Cat. Xo. 16585rt), 2f inches, and (Cat. No. 16585(i), 
3-1% inches in diameter, both incomplete, each has four suits with the 
following marks: 

Ax, red. 

Trident, yellow.

Mace, black. 

The court cards are missing. 

From the comparison of these packs it would appear that as in the 
Ganjifa variations occur in the colors associated with certain suit marks,

and, also, as in the case of the Korean cards Etoutjyen (No. 77), that 
there has been a progressive diminution of the suits; in this case from 
ten to four. Changes and substitutions are also seen to have occurred 
in the suit marks. 

The opinion was expressed by Mr. Ramachandrayya that the Hindu 
cards, not being mentioned in the early records, were probably imitated

their origin rests directly upon older Asiatic traditions.'

Fifty- seven cards of a set of sixty. Card-pieces about 2 J by If 
inches, consisting of thick lacquered cardboard with black backs.

being of five different colors. These are as follows : 

Black: Lion devouring serpent; lion devouring ox; lions and serpent.

Yellow: Woman (Queen). Five varieties, in four of which the woman is 

accompanied by a child.

A pack of Persian playing-cards in the possession of Mrs. C. C. 
Curtis, of Albion, ^ew York, are identical with the preceding in size 
and material, but bear somewhat different designs. They number 
twenty cards, of five different colors, black, yellow (white), red, gold, 
and green, four of each. There are two cards of each kind, making 
ten different (;ards. 

Black: Two lions devouring two serpents; lion devouring antelope (Plate 

48«, h.) 
Yellow: King on throne; mother (Madonna?) with child. (Plate 48c, d.) 
Red: Lady with child; girl with wineglass and bottle. (Plate 49o, h ) 
Gold: Two soldiers; lad with dog. (Plate -Jc, d.) 
Green : Dancing-girls ; queen on throne. ( Plate 50a, b. ) 

The first-mentioned cards of each pair agree with those described 
below by General Schindler. It will be observed that the uniform of 
the soldiers, that of the English East India Company, precludes the 
possibility of any high antiquity for these particular cards.' 

Gen. A. Houtum Schindler, of Teheran, in reply to a letter of inquiry 
addressed by the writer, has forwarded the following account of Persian 
cards: 

The old Persian name for these cards was ganjifch — a word, I think, derived from 
the Chinese (chi-p'di — literally, paper-cards, the modern Chinese for playing-cards), 
with the Persian word ganj^ "treasure" prefixed. It may have also been origi- 
nally Ean-ch u-2)'(ii =z cards from Kanchu, in the Kansu province. The word (/anjifch 
is in Persian now only employed for European playing-cards (four suits, ace to ten; 
three pictui'e cards each suit), which, however, are also called varak, while the old 
Persian playing-cards are known as varak ids — varak i (Unnds — or simply as, from the 
game as or asanas, which is played with them. From travelers in Persia in the sev-

found in the playing-sticks of the northwest coast of America, so the wooden gam- 
bling-disks of the same Indians may be taken as possible American equivalents of 
the circular cards of India.

enteenth century we know that a set of ganjifeh consisted of ninety or ninety-six 
canls in eight suits or colors. At present a set consists of twenty cards in tive 
colors or values. These values are : 

1. Shir ra Khurshid or <i.i : Lion and Sun, or Ace. 

2. Shdh or Pddishd : King. 

3. Jiibi: Lady (or Queen). 

4. Sarhdz : Soldier (or Knave). 

5. £«/.■«< (meaning something of little value) : generally a flancing-girl. 
The backs of the cards are always black or of a dark color, but their faces have 

grounds of difterent colors, viz : The Lion and Sun, a black ground ; the King, a white 
ground; the Lady, red; the soldier, gold; the Lakai, green. The pictures on the 
cards show much variety and are often obscene, particularly those on the card of 
the lowest value. The ordinary types as now made are : Ace, a Lion and Sun, as in 
the Persian arms; a King sitting on a throne; a European lady in a quaint costume; 
a Persian soldier shouldering his ritle; a I'ersian dancing-girl. The word ganjifeh I 
have exjilained. As is no doubt our word ''ace, ' probably introduced into India 
through the Portuguese Neither of the words is found in Persian dictionaries. 
The game of Js is exactly like Poker, but without any flushes or sequences. There 
are four players, and each player gets five cards, dealt to the right. The dealer puts 
down a stake. The first player then looks at his cards. If he ''goes," he says 
didam (I have seen), and covers the stake or raises it. If he does not wish to play, 
he says nadidam (I have not seen) and throws his cards. He may also "go" without 
looking at his cards — that is, in poker parlance, "straddle" — and he says nadid 
didam (not seeing, I have seen). The second player, if he wishes to play, must cover 
the stakes, and can also raise. Tlie third player and the dealer then act in the same 
way just as in poker, and when the stakes of all players arc equal and no one raises 
any more the cards are turned up and the player holding the best hand wins the 
stakes. 
The hands in the order of their value are as follows : 

Seh vajust, i e., three and a pair; a "full." . 

Sehta, i. e., threes, aces, kings, etc. 

Do just, i. e., two pairs; aces highest. 

Just, i. e., one pair; aces highest. 
\^Tien two players have the same pair or pairs, the other cards decide ; for instance, 
a pair of kings, ace, soldier, and lalat. 

"Bluffing" is a feature of the game and is called tuj) zadan ; literally, "fire off a 
gun." A bluft' is tup.

The origin of European playing-cards is extremely obscure. They 
are variously regarded as having been invented in Europe, aud to have 
been introduced from the East. Willshire''^ favors the former view, and 
assigns the earliest European cards to Italy, while others believe them 
to have been derived from China, or to have been introduced by the 
Arabs or Gypsies.'' 

There are two principal kinds of European cards; one consisting of 
from thirty-two to fifty-six cards, comprised in four suits, each com- 
l^osed of a series of numeral cards and court or coate-cards, or hon- 
ours; and another, called Tarois (France) or Tarocchi (Italy), in which 
the preceding pack is supplemented with twenty-two or more cards 
called atouts (France) or atutti (Italy), bearing emblematic devices of 
a mythological or historic character. The earliest, or what are believed 
to be th(} earliest, Italian cards are of the latter kind. 

There are three varieties of Italian Tarots, according to Willshire: 
the Tarots of Venice or Lombardy, regarded by him as the parent 
game; the Mincliiate of Florence, and the Tarocchino of Bologna. 

The source of the allegorical designs on the cards of the emblematic 
sequence has been referred to a series of early Italian prints bearing 
full-length figures illustrating the various conditions of life — the Muses, 
Arts, Sciences, etc. — which are regarded as having been intended for 
puriDoses of instruction rather than for play. These prints, known as 
the Tarocchi di Ilanterpia or the Carte di Baldiniy exist in several 
European collections, and are fifty in number, arranged in five series, 
consecutively numbered (No. 86). Mr. W. H. Wilkinson, in a paper 
on the Chinese Origin of Playing-Cards,'' in which he i^resents a strong

tlie Italian Tarot pack as a suggestive compound of the two nation 
card games of China; Kon «', played with Kwan'p'ai (No. 80), and T' 
lam., played with dominoes (No. 21), or domino-cards (No. 22). In tl 
light thrown by the study of Korean cards upon the origin of ])layin 
cards in Asia, the i^resent writer believes that -while it is more thf 
probable European playing-cards had an identical origin with those 
China, it is not yet apparent that there was any actual transference 
cards or card games. In his opinion it may be concluded that the foi 
suits of European cards were originally the emblems of the Foi 
Directions.

The first is regarded by some as the source of the design on tl

The resemblance between the emblems testifies either to a descent 
both compositions from an antecedent or common tyjie, or that the pie 
No. 7 of the old Venetian Tarots is simply a modification of No. 45 
the Italian sequence (Willshire).

Pack of ninety-seven cards, comprising fifty-six numeral-cards ai 

forty-one atutti. The former are similar to those of the precedii

Willshire describes the characteristics of the Florentine Minchia 
as follows : 

lu place of the twenty-two atutti of the old Venetian sequence there are fori 
one tarots proper, i. e., nineteen of the older series, or what are equivalent to the 
and twenty-two additional tarots, including the Matto or Fou. The chief modifi( 
tions of the old Venetian seqiience are : the figure of Le Pape (No. V) is withdrawn ; 
I'apcsse (No. II) becomes Le Grand Due; U Imptratrhe (No. Ill) and L' Empercur (I' 
IV) represent the "Emperor of the West" and the ''Emperor of the East" re8p( 
tively; VHermUc (No. IX) becomes an old man ujion crutches {Le Sahlier No. X 
haviug behind him a star and above his shoulders an hourglass transfixed by an arro 
while La Maison Dun ou la Foudre (No. XVI) is discarded, or is perhaps uietanK 
phosed into L'Enfvr (No. XV), L'EtoUe(^o. XVII;, La Lune (No. XVIII), Le Sol 
(No. XIX), aud Le Monde (No. XXI) are retained. To this slight modification 
the old Venetian Tarots are added the three theological virtues, Faith (No. XVII 
Hope (No. XVI), and Charity (No. XIX). Other additional pieces are: One of t 
four cardinal virtues, Prudence (No. XVII) j the four elements of the ancient philos 
phers. as Fire (No. XX), Water (No. XXI), Earth (No. XXII), Air (No. XXIII); t 
twelve signs of the Zodiac (Nos. XXIV to XXXV) ; the remainder of the series cc 
eluding with the Star, the Moon, the Sun, the World, and La licnomm^e. 

Willshire states that there is a tradition that MincMate was invent( 
by Michael Angelo to teach children arithmetic.

century. 

Pack of sixty- six cards, comprising- forty numeral-cards and twenty- 
two atutti. The numeral-cards are like those of the preceding packs, 
except that they are double-headed, instead of having full-length 
figures, and in that the twos, threes, fours, and fives are suppressed, the 
latter being the chief characteristic of the Tarocchino. The atutti bear 
designs copied from a Florentine Minchiate set. 

According to Willshire, this modification of the Tarot game was 
invented at Bologna, early in the fifteenth century, by Francesco 
Fibbia (Prince of Pisa), an exile in that city, dying there in 1419. The 
word tarocchino is a diminutive of tarocchi, a name early applied to any 
game with Tarots.

CHERS AND PLAYING-CARDS. 933 

German Tarot packs, called Tarolc, vary greatly in their ornamental 
and symbolic designs from the Italian cards from wliicli they are mau- 
if'estly copied. 

91. Jei] des 78 Tarots I^gyptiens. ^ Paris, ^ France. Nineteenth 
century. 

Set of seventy-eight numbered cards, intended for fortune-telling, 
with designs copied Irom the Tarot pack. Accompanied by a hand- 
book, entitled Art de Tirer les Cartes. 

The use of cards for the purpose of fortune telling is well known. 
Indeed, it is the ojiinion of some authorities that cards were introduced 
into Europe for the purpose of divination and fortune telling, by the 
Gypsies, some time between 1275 and 13J5. There is evidence that 
cards were used for this purpose early in the sixteenth century. 
According to Willshire, recourse to cards for divinatory purposes 
gradually declined among the upper classes until the middle of the 
eighteenth century, though it prevailed, no doubt, among the lowest 
grades of society frequenting fairs and the caravans of mountebanks. 
In 1750, divination with cards again became popular, and at this period, 
in 1753, a perruquier, named Alliette, who reversed the letters of his 
name, and called himself Etteilla, sui>erseded the ordinary practice 
of employing the cards of the pack singly, and substituted the art of 
reading the mysteries they might unfold when the whole sequence was 
arranged u])on a table. 

The emblematic figures of the Tarot pack have been the object of 
nmch speculation, and their origin is said to extend back to the ancient 
Egyptians, from whom they have descended to us as a book or series of 
subjects of deep symbolic meaning. The discovery and explication 
of this supposed source and hidden meaning of the Tarots employed 
in modern times was claimed by M. Court de Gebelin in 1781. He 
asserts that the series of seventy-eight Venetian Tarots has an unques- 
tionable claim to be regarded as an Egyptian book, and that it is based 
upon the sacred Egyptian number seven. Alliette applied the theories 
of M. de Gebelin to the use of cards in fortune telling, and numerous 
packs are made even at the jjresent day to be used in accordance with 
the system which he formulated.

in the Spanish game of El Homhre. 

The above may be regarded as a characteristic Italian pack. A dis- 
tinctive character of the marks of the numerals in the suits of Spade

aud Basioni is the mode in wliicli they are iiiterhiced or coiiiiecfed 
together in phice of .standing separately or apart. The curved forms, 
too, of the Spade, or swords, are specially Italian in design. The 
designs on cards vary in different parts of Italy. Thus in the south, 
cards with Spanish marks are used, while the Florentine pack bears 
French suit-marks. Cards are made at the present day in many of 
the Italian cities. Each maker supplies not only those of the local 
type, but usually those of other cities. Stencils are still used for some 
of the cheaper cards.^

Cavallo, and Fante. These cards are remarkable for tbeir length, being 
5,\r by 2-1^6 inches. 

According to Willshire, there are no marks special to Trappola, it 
being played with a series of numerals, of which the three, four, five, 
and six of each suit are suppressed, and as long as this is done it may 
be played with cards showing no matter what marks of suits. From 
the circumstances of its being a Venetian game, the original marks ot 
the suits were naturally the Italian ones.'

tier collection. These cards are fourteen in number, painted by hand 
about the commencement of the fifteenth century. They bear the same 
suit marks as the French cards of the ])resent day. These marks were 
so persistently maintained and introduced on cards exported to all 
countries that a regular type or class of cards became known as French 
cards, as opposed to Italian cards on the one hand and to German cards 
on tlie other. 

At first the figure-cards or honors were without names on them, but 
about the last quarter of the sixteenth century names were attached. 
French playing-cards having on them the suit-marks, Cceurs, Carrcanx, 
Trefles, and Piq}ie.s, are often termed Plqitet packs. The game of Piquet 
is one in which, up to the beginning of the eighteenth century, the pack 
consisted of thirty-six cards, the two, three, four, and five of each suit 
being supi)ressed, as in Trappola and the Taroccltino of Bologna. From 
the date mentioned the six of each suit has been omitted, so the Piquet 
pack has now but thirty-two cards. 

102. Spiel- Karten. Playing-Cards.^ Frankfort-on-the-Main,^ Ger- 

many. Nineteenth century. 

Pack of thirty- six cards of four suits : Herzen, Lauhy Uicheln, and kSehel- 
leyi, or "Hearts," "Leaves," "Acorns," and "Bells." The numerals are 
ace, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten, the suppression of the two, three, 
four, and five being a peculiarity of the true German pack. The court- 
cards are the Kimig, "King," and the Ohermann and Untermann, supe- 
rior and inferior valets. 

Willshire states that, according to trustworthy authorities, allusion 
is made to playing-cards in the PJJiehth'uchcr of Niirnberg for 1384, and 
there is extant an ordinance of the town council of Chn for the year 
1397 prohibiting their employment. "It is probable," he says, "that 
the Germans very soon altered for themselves the Italian marks of the 
suits, making use of figures of animals for differentiating the latter." 
The earliest German cards known have dogs, falcons, stags, and ducks 
for suit-marks. These "animated" cards were, however, soon followed 
by a series having the more national signs of Roth or JTerzen, Lauh or 
Griin, UicheJn, and Schcllen, or Hearts, Leaves, Acorns, and Bells. 

103. Spiel-Karten. Playing-Cards.^ Leipsic, Germany. "La Belle 

Alliance." 
Pack of thirty-six cards with German suit-marks, like the preceding. 
Numerals bear colored pictures of the battle of Leipsic, 1813 ; the Kings, 
portraits of the allied sovereigns, and the other court cards, generals.

REPORT OF NATTONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 



The pictures on each pair of cards diflcr ia details from each otlier. 

A similar pack of Hexen-karten in the University Museum/ probably 
made in Niirnberg in the seventeenth or early in the eighteenth cen- 
tury, consists of thirty-two cards printed in colors, comprising twelve 
cards with Roman numerals, printed in black, from I to XII, and two 
each of the following cards:

Karr,

Mtau, Cat. 

Eott, Horse. 

Werda, Sentry. 

rfeift, Parrot. 

The numeral cards are inscribed at the top numero, and below the 
number are pictures of cities, which, upon comparison, prove to be 
highly conventionalized copies of the pictures of Italian cities on the 
cards from Bologna. A very complete account of this game is given 
by K. A. Bierdimptl,2 who states that in Germany the game has differ- 
ent names, that of Hexen or "witch" cards being the local name in old 
Bavaria. The game exists in France under the name of Coucou.

111. Igralnye Kauty. Playiuff-Cards.' Russia. ISTineteenth Ceu- 

tury. 

Whist pack of lifty-two cards, Freucli suit-marks, aud court-cards 
similar to those of France. 

The manufacture of playing-cards in Russia is a State monopoly, of 
which the revenue is a[)plied to the support of tlie charitable establish- 
ment known as the "Institutions of the Empress Marie." 

112. Playing- Oards.^ England.' Nineteenth century. 

Whist pack of tifty two cards. Suits : Diamonds, Hearts, Spades, 
and Clubs. 

According to Willshire, it is probable that cards made their way into 
England through France. The date of their introduction is not known, 
but it is believed they were not in use until after the reign of Henry 
IV (1405), aud they were certainly employed previous to 1403. About 
1181 they formed a common English Christmas pastime. England 
appears to have at once adopted the French suit marks. The English 
names of the suits, however, are in part of Spanish descent.

BIBLICAL ANTIQUITIES. 



A DESCRIPTION OF THE EXHIBIT AT THE COTTON STATES 
INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION, ATLANTA, 18Q5.

INTRODUCTION. 

The Section of Oriental Antiquities in the U. S. IsTational Museum 
was established in 1887, and in 1889 there was added to the Museum 
a Section of Religions Ceremonial Institutions. Although not at all 
identical in scope, it was found best for practical reasons that the 
exhibit of these two sections in the Atlanta Exposition should be 
united in the form of a collection which, for want of a better name, may 
be called Biblical Antiquities. The space allowed was an alcove 20 by 20 
feet. All of the subdivisions of this subject were represented, so that 
there was no i)ossibility of completeness in any direction. Neverthe- 
less, the exhibit had an educational value, as being the first collection 
put together at an exposition which attempted to show in outline all of 
the possibilities of study in this most important field. 

It has, therefore, seemed proper that a record be made of this collec- 
tion as it was actually shown at Atlanta, in the order in which it was 
shown, and without any attempt to fill out the deficiencies which are 
known to have existed. Such a description will, it is hoped, be of 
service to teachers and students, and may possibly furnish a sugges- 
tion to those who are interested in the establishment of small collec- 
tions which touch the interests of so many persons, who, without being 
special students and investigators, are yet deeply concerned in any- 
thing that relates to the archu'ology and history, the ethnology, and 
the art of that portion of the eastern world around the Mediterranean, 
to which the culture and civilization of later Europe aud even of 
modern America can in a great degree be traced. 

The limitations of space caused some apparent incongruities; never- 
theless, it can be said that nothing was shown which did not bear 

upon Biblical history and antiquities.

THE LAND OF THE BIBLE. 

Map of Palestine.— It is not possible to understaiul the geology, 
the flora, and fauna of a country, the habits and customs of the peo]ile, 
nor their history, without an idea of the physical features of the coun- 
try studied. The first object shown, therefore, was a relief map of 
Palestine. This map is the result of geographical and geological sur- 
vey work, carried on for more than ten years by experts in the service 
of the Palestine Exploration Fund. It is 7 feet 9 inches by 4 feet 1 inch 
in size and made on the scale of jeik^oi or three-eightlis of an inch to 
the mile. It embraces the whole of western i'alestine, from Baalbec 
in the north to Kadesh Barnea in the south, and shows nearly all that is 
known of the country east of the Jordan. The natural features of the 
country stand out prominently, being reinforced by appropriate colors. 
The mountains and plains are shaded a creamy white. Tlie seas, lakes, 
marshes, and perennial streams are shown in blue. The Old and New 
Testament sites are marked in red. The map thus furnishes a most 
important aid for the understanding of the Bible narrative.' 

GEOLOGY. 

No attempt was made to present in systematic form the geology of 
the country nor to show in any way the features of the soil. The fol- 
lowing specimens, which possess a sentimental interest merely, were 
placed in the collection. 

Dust from Jerusalem. — Dust from the Holy Land is with many 
Jews a much-cherished possession, perhaps suggested by Psalms cii, 
14: "For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and have pity ujion 
her dust." It is sometimes placed in the graves, and is considered as 
a substitute for actual burial in the Holy Land, which is one of the 
pious aspirations of the orthodox Jew. 

Water from the Jordan. — The Jordan is one of the points of 
attraction for pilgrims to Palestine. As early as the time of Constan- 
tine (306 to 337) baptism in the Jordan was deemed a special privilege, 
on account of its association with John the Baptist and the baptism of 
Christ;^ even now the Oriental Christians attach great importance to 
the bath in the Jordan, as the termination of a j)ilgrimage.^ 

The pilgrims usually fill jars from the river to be used for baptisms 
at home. 

Small shell {Janthina fragilis) from Tyre. — Tyre was in ancient 
times the wealthiest and most magnificent of Pheniciau cities. It was 
situated on the Mediterranean, and consisted of two parts, Palaetyrus 
on the mainland and Neotyrus on the island. It was famous for the

tion Fund.

precious purple dye, which was extensively prepared from the shell- 
fish Mnrex. Tyre is often mentioned in the P>il)le under the name of 
^or.' The modern (^ur, on its site, is an unimportant town of about 
5,000 inhabitants. 

Granite from Jebel Musa. — Jebel Musa (mountain of Moses) is 
one of the peaks in the southeast of the Sinaitic Mountain range. It 
rises about 7,000 feet above the sea level, and tradition assigns to it the 
giving of the Law to Moses. The Sinaitic Mountain chain is formed 
of granite and i)ori)liyry. The quarries and mineral deposits of the 
Sinaitic Peninsula were worked as early as 3,000 B. C. 

FLORA. 

The ilora, like the geology of the country, was but inadequately rep- 
resented, the following specimens being the only ones shown : 

Seed pods of the carob tree. — The carob or locust tree ( Cera- 
tonia siliqua) is common in (lalilee, in the plain of Sharon, and in the 
countries around the Mediterranean Sea in general. The island of 
Cyprus alone produces at present about 30,000 tons of carobs, almost 
the whole of which is exported to England and France, and "this 
quantity is produced by hardly a third of the carob trees growing in 
the island, because jterhaps the other two-thirds of these trees are 
not yet grafted."^ Its fruit is a brown pod, from to 12 inches long, 
about an inch broad, having a tleshy or mealy pulp, of an agreeable 
taste, which is not only ground up for cattle and swine, but also exten- 
sively used as food by the Arabs, Moors, and Italians. Large quantities 
of carob are used, especially in France, for distillation, and also for 
producing a sort of molasses' The English name is borrowed from 
the Oriental, probably coming from the Arabic* Harruh through 
Spanish; it occurs in the Talmud in the form Harul). It is generally 
assumed that the carob beans represent the "husks," in the Revised 
Version "pods of the carob tree," (in the Greek original uspdrzov, 
deration) in the parable of the Prodigal Son.'' Through a confusion 
bet\teen the pods of the carob tree (also called locust) with the locusts 
(insects, Greek aupide?^ alcrides) which John the Baptist ate,'' it was 
thought that the pods formed the food of John the Baptist, and they 
are still commonly called " St. John's bread." 

Sycamore from Palestine. — The sycamore tree [Ficm sycomonis), 
Hebrew shiqtnah^ is represented in I Kings x, 27, as having been 
abundant in Palestine in the reign of Solomon : "The king made silver 
to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore 
trees that are in the lowland for abundance," and similarly we read in 

' Ezekiel xxvi-xxTiii, etc.

956 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

Isaiali ix, 9, 10, "tlie sycamores are cut down, but we will clianj^e them 
into cedars." The sycamore of the Bible has no natural alliance with 
the maple sycamores of Europe and North America. In flowers and 
foliage it closely resembles the common fig, but grows to a greater size, 
sometimes reaching a height of 30 or 40 feet and a diameter of 20 feet. 
It bears at least two crops annually, but they are small and insipid 
compared with those of the common fig tree [Ficus carica). Still they 
are gathered and used as food by the poorer classes. The prophet 
Amos describes himself as a "dresser of sycamore trees."' In the 
Egyptian cult the sycamore was symbolical of the tree of life, being 
dedicated to Hathor. 

Apples of Sodom. — The apples of Sodom are considered by some 
to represent the nightshade {Solanum sanctum) which grows in bushes 
and thickets in warm regions and especially in the Jordan Valley. It 
is a shrubby plant, 3 or 4 feet high. Its blossoms resemble in color and 
form those of the potato, and the fruits are oval-shaped, first of yel- 
low, but when ripe of a beautiful red color. The fruit is said to be 
turned into dust by the sting of an insect, leaving only the skin intact. 
Eobinsou identifies the fruit of the Asclepias gigantea with the apples 
of Sodom. This fruit resembles a large yellow apple. Externally of 
fair appearance, it bursts when pressed like a bubble filled with air, 
leaving only the shreds of a thin skin in the hand. The Orientals 
describe the Asclepias gigmiiea as a plant containing an astringent milky 
juice. (Arabic, Yatii. Syriac, Yetua sehea helha.^) 

Unripe pomegranate from Palestine. — The pomegranate {Pu- 
nica granatum; Hebrew, Rinimon) is enumerated among the plants char- 
acteristic of the promised land,'' though it was not native there; it was 
and continues to be extensively cultivated in Palestine, and its failure 
is represented as a special punishment of God.^ It grows wild in 
Persia, Afghanistan, and neighboring countries, and has been culti- 
vated from time immemorial along the north and south coasts of the 
Mediterranean.'' 

It is still common in Tunis and Algiers, where it is called by* the 
Arabs rimdn, corresponding exactly to the ancient Hebrew name. It 
is a beautiful shrub, with dark and shining leaves and bell- shaped 
flowers. In the autumn it yields a ruddy fruit about the size of an 
orange, usually of a reddish tint, filled with a delicious pulp, in which 
semitransparent seeds lie in rows. It was appreciated for its fruit" 
and its wine,^ which is made from the fermented juice. Its fruits and 
flowers were also used in medicine, and the rind for tanning leather. 
The manufacture of leather by means of it was introduced by the

Moors from Africa into Spaiu, especially iuto Cordova, aud the leather 
was heijce called "Cordovan." It is still used in Morocco, the leather 
of which country retains its superiority, especially for bookbinding. 
The Howers and fruit of the pomegranate entered into the religious rites 
and symbolism of the rhenicians and ancient Romans, as well as of 
the ancient Israelites. The robe of the High Priest had an embroidery 
of "pomegranates of blue and of purple and of scarlet round about 
the skirt thereof,"' while the pomegranate also formed a decorative 
symbol in tlie columns of the Temple.^ Hehn^ says: " Eeligious inter- 
course in ancient times also brought the glorious pomegranate tree to 
Europe. Its purple blossoms in brilliant foliage and red cheeked fruit 
rich in kernels must have from the beginning excited the imagination 
of the peoples of Western Asia, whose mode of thinking was symbol- 
ical. In the Odyssey, among the fruits in the garden of the king of the 
Pheaks, and among those that torment by their sight, the Phrygian 
Tantalus are also the pomegranates fjoial {rhoisi), which name in itself 
bears decisive testimony to the origin of the plant in Semitic language 
and culture." "The name of the pomgranate fruit among the Portu- 
guese is to the present day the Arabic ronia, romeiray^ 

Cone of the cedar of Lebanon.— The cedar of Lebanon ( Cedrus 
libani, Hebrew Urez) has its chief habitat in the ranges of the Tau- 
rus and Lebanon, the latter being its southernmost limit. The Old 
Testament abounds in references to the cedar of Lebanon. It was 
considered as the prince of trees, the emblem of all that is grand, 
magnificent, and durable: "The glory of Lebanon;-' the trees of the 
Lord are satisfied; the cedars of Lebanon, which He hath planted ;'"= 
"the righteous shall flourish like the palm tree; he shall grow like a 
cedar in Lebanon."' Frequent references are also made to the eco- 
nomic uses of the cedar. It supplied the chief material for the wood- 
work of the temple of Solomon and the royal palaces,^ the second 
temple of Zerubbabel," and according to Josephus'^ was also used in the 
rebuilding of the temple by Herod. From the Assyrian inscriptions it 
is learned that the Assyrian kings procured the costly woods for their 
buildings from the Lebanon. Cedar timber was also used in the great 
Persian edifices at Persepolis, in the first temple of Diana at Ephesus, 
and that of Apollo at Utica, where the age of the cedar timber was 
computed at two thousand years. At present the forest of Lebanon

"is slioiu of its glory," and only between 400 and 500 cedar trees are 
found in small groups in various parts of the mountain range, most of 
them in the valley of Kadisha, nearly 7,000 feet above the sea. The 
tree is still called by the Arabs Ar.z, identical with the ancient Hebrew 
name.' 



Cone of a Lebanon fir. — The Hebrew word^ Berosh, which is 
rendered by the English version "tir," probably comprises the other 
coniferous trees of Palestine, including junipers, pines, and the funeral 
cypress. Of the pine there are four species in Palestine. The most 
common is the Aleppo pine {Pinus lialepemifi), then the pinaster (P. 
pinaster), the stone {P.pinea), and the Pyrenean [P. pijrenaiea). The 
Juniperus excelsa is very common, and the Cyprcssus He:npervirens is the 
common species of western Asia and southern Europe. " Fir trees" are 
frequently referred to in the Old Testament in association with cedars 
of Lebanon, though the former were deemed inferior: "Howl, O tir 
tree, for the cedar is fallen."^ "Fir" timber was used for the floors 
of the temple,^ for ships' planks,"* and for musical instruments.'^ The 
fruit is but once mentioned: "I am like a green fir tree; from me is thy 
fruit found."" 

FAUNA. 

Though for obvious reasons no attempt was made at a comi)ete col- 
lection of the fauna of the Bible, a sufticient number of specimens was 
shown from each class to make the exhibit of this division of the 
natural history of the Bible in some measure representative. 

MAMMALS. 

The mammals were illustrated by the following specimens: 
The ape" {Ranumanmonlxey, tSemnopithecus entellus ; Hebrew, Qof). — 
The ape was not native in Palestine. It is mentioned in the Bible 
among the commodities brought to Solomon by the ships of Tarshish." 
The Hebrew name for ape is cognate with that in the Tamil language 
{Kapi), and it is therefore assumed that the apes were brought from 
Ceylon or South India, where the genus SemnopUlweas is especially fre- 
quent. The ape has also been identified among the animals depicted 
on the Assyrian monuments. 

The bat (Hebrew, Atallef). — The bat is classed in the catalogue of 
animals'" among the unclean birds, which are forbidden for food. In

Is;)i;ili ii, 20, 21, bats are alluded to iu company with moles as niliabiting 
holes and cavities about ruins; "In that day a man shall cast away bis 
idols of silver, and his idols of gold which tbey made for bim to wor- 
ship, to the moles and to the bats to go into the caverns of the rocks, 
and into the clefts of the ragged rocks," Bats are still very numerous 
in I'alestine, about twenty species being known. One of the most com- 
mon is Gijnonycieris (egyptiaca, a specimen of which was shown. 

"Coney" EOCiv-BADGEK {Froeavia si/riaca, or Hyrax syriacus ; 
Hebrew, Shafan). — In the English versions of the Bible the Hebrew 
Shafan is rendered "coney," which formerly was the common name for 
rabbit, although that usage is now obsolete. It is well known that the 
introduction of the rabbit into the East is of recent date, and that no 
rabbit was known to the ancient inhabitants of Bible lands.' Besides, 
while the rabbit has its dwelling place in sand or clay, the IShtfun is 
enumerated iu the Bible- among the "four things little upon earth, 
but exceeding wise, being but a feeble folk, yet they make their houses 
in the rock," and their attachment to rocks is also referred to in Psalms 
civ, 18: "The rocks are refuge for the shefanim:^ The animal men- 
tioned in these i)assages can not, therefore, have been a rabbit, and it is 
now assumed by all writers to be the Procavia or Hyrax syriacus, which 
belongs to an isolated group of hoofed mammals whose dentition mani- 
fests considerable similarity to the teeth of the rhinoceros. The hyrax 
is not as common in Palestine as formerly, bnt it is still found in some 
l)]aces, as in the gorge of the Kedron, on the' west side of the Dead Sea, 
while at the summit of Jebel Musa, on Mount Sinai, a whole colony is 
in existence. The Arabs call the hyrax icabr, and describe it as the 
'•little animal of the children of Israel" [janainii Juini Israil)^-^ In 
Abyssinia the hyrax is called gehejafj and its flesh is there used as food 
by the Mohammedans.^ The Israelites counted it among the nnclean 
animals/^ 

YouNCf CAMEL {(Jiimelus dromedarius^ Hebrew Gamal). — The camel 
was, and is still, one of the most useful beasts in Palestine. It is re- 
ferred to in the Bible as being used for riding,'" as a beast of burden,'^ and 
of draft.'' It was also used in war." Among Jacob's gilts to I]sau were 
thirty milch camels (literally, "camels giving suck") with their colts.^" 
The flesh of the camel was forbidden as food.'' It is eaten now when 
better food can not be had in most parts of the East; but the meat is

said to be very coarse and dry. The meat of a very young camel, how- 
ever, is esteemed by the Arabs as a great luxury. The camel had many 
uses in the arts. Camel's hair was used for weaving into cloth. John 
the Baptist " had his raiment of camel's hair." ' Tents, shields, harness, 
saddles, and even trunks are made of camel's skin. Two species, the 
one-humped camel {Camelun dromedarius) and the Bactriaii two humped 
camel {Cameliis hactrianus), were known in Palestine, the former being 
more frequent. The camel was the subject of many proverbial expres- 
sions, two of which are by Jesus, Matthew xix, 24: "It is easier fora 
camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter into the 
Kingdom of God," and xxiii, 24: "Strain out the gnat and swallow the 
camel." The word for camel is practically the same in most ancient 
and modern languages. 

Gazelle {Gazella dorcas; Hebrew, ^eJn). — The gazelle (in the Author- 
ized Version "roebuck," also translated "roe" in the Eevised Version) 
was allowed as food. ' Jt was provided for the royal table of ►Solomon.'' 
The characteristics of swiftness and gentleness of these animals are 
often referred to^ "as light of foot as a wild roe;"-^ "as swift as the roes 
upon the mountains;"" "The voice of my beloved; behold he cometh 
leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills. My beloved is 
like a roe or a young hart."' The feminine form, in Hebrew (^ebiaJi, in 
Aramean Tahitlui, was often used as a proper name;** for example, 
"Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by 
interpretation is called Dorcas." The Arabs call the gazelle tahi and 
employ it frequently in their love poetry as the image of feminine love- 
liness. More than twenty species of gazelle inhabit Africa, Arabia, 
Persia, India, and central Asia. The gazelle of Syria, Egypt, and 
Arabia is the Gazella dorcas. It is very common in Palestine, esj)e- 
cially in the Judean wilderness and the Arabah. 

Mouse (Hebrew, Alcbar). — The mouse is enumerated among the 
unclean "creeping things,"^ " eating swine's llesh, and the abomina- 
tion, and the mouse." Mice were sent as a plague upon the Philistines 
for having carried off the Ark of the Covenant.'" jSTo less than twenty 
species have been found in Palestine. The Mns hactnanuft, which is 
especially plentiful and familiar, was given as an illustration. 

BIRDS. 

The birds enumerated in the Bible were represented by fourteen 
specimens. 

The cock. — No mention is made of the cock in the Old Testament, 
but in the New Testament he is referred to in connection with Peter's

denial of Jesus, wlien Jesus said to Peter, "The cock shall not crow 
this day until thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.'" It is 
said that in remembrance of the crowing of the cock, which brought 
Peter to a sense of his guilt, the practice began of placing weather- 
cocks upon towers and steeples.^ 

There is independent testimony from the Mishna that the cock had 
become common in I'alestine. The Mishna was collected about 200 of 
the Christian era, but as many portions of it go back to at least three 
centuries earlier it is in some portions contemporary with and even 
earlier than the New Testament. According to the Mishna^ the Jews 
were prohibited from selling a white cock to the heathens. This pro- 
hibition was compromised by the permission to sell if the toe were cut 
ofl", because " they do not sacrifice anything defective." The word for 
cock is " Tarnegol^'''' Syriac Tarnagla. There is no Biblical Hebrew 
word for cock. In addition to the above the Talmud uses the word 
Geber, which means simply " male." The crowing of the cock is referred 
to a number of times in the Talmud, cock crow being a recognized time.^ 
There are three that are strong (unyielding), says the Talmud, " Israel 
among the peoples; the dog among the beasts, and the cock among 
the birds." {Be^-a 5b.) 

On Babylonian gems the cock appears as the herald of dawn, the 
heavenly guardian of light, who by his crowing drives away the demons 
of the night. The native country of the domestic cock is supposed to 
be India, and the migration of domestic fowl to western Asia and 
Europe probably took place with the Medo- Persian conquerors. As 
the Persians spread their dominions, the cock, the "Persian bird" 
went with them. 

Turtledove {Turtur risorius; Hebrew, Tor). — The turtledove and 
the dove or pigeon (Hebrew, Yonah) are very frequently mentioned in 
the Bible. They were the only birds permitted as sacrifices.^ ISToah 
sent forth a dove three times from the ark. On its second flight it 
returned with an olive leaf,*' which has since been regarded as the 
emblem of peace. Numerous allusions are made in the Scriptures to 
the simplicity, innocence, gentleness, and fidelity of tlie dove : ' " Ephraim 
is like a silly dove without understanding."'' "Be ye therefore wise as 
serpents, and harmless as doves." The turtledove is noted for the regu- 
larity of its migration:^ "And the turtle and the swallow and the crane 
observe the time of their coming," compare Canticles ii, 11, 12. At 
present there are four species of dove and three species of turtledove 
inhabiting Palestine in large numbers.

term Nesher, which in the English Bible is invariably rendered "eagle," 
comprises large birds of prey in general, and perhaps particularly the 
griffon vulture. The golden eagle is (juite common in Palestine. At 
least seven other distinct kinds have been observed. I^umerous refer- 
ences are found in the Bible to the characteristics of the eagle: Its 
high soaring in the air;' its molting, as a symbol of the renewing of 
strength;- its strength;^ its predatory habits;^ its power of vision;^ 
its care for its young, in comparison with God's sheltering care over 
his people.'' The eagle, as emblematic of the divine attributes, is one 
of the four living creatures in the vision of Ezekiel (i, 10) and in 
the Apociilypse of John (iv, 7). It is also the emblem of John the 
Evangelist. 

Hoopoe ( Upupa epops; Hebrew, Duhifath). — It is probable that the 
Hebrew name duhifath, occurring in the list of unclean birds," denotes 
the hoopoe, as the Revised Version translates it, and not the "lapwing," 
as rendered by the Authorized Version. The hoopoe feeds on insects 
in dunghills and marshy places, and is therefore considered a very 
iiltliy bird. It is very common in Egypt, where it is found throughout 
the winter. In Palestine it is a summer visitor. The Egyjitians con- 
sidered the hoopoe as symbolical of gratitude, because it repays the 
early kindness of its parents in their old age by trimming their wings 
and bringing them food when they are acquiring new plumage. The 
Arabs call it the "doctor," believing it to possess marvelous medicinal 
qualities; and they use its head in charms and incantations. 

Owl. — Various Hebrew names are assigned by the English Version 
to different species of owl — Yanshnf, Leviticus xi, 17; Deuteronomy 
xiv, 16, "great owl;" Kos, in the same passage, "little owl.'' 

The owl belonged to the unclean birds, and is enumerated among the 
animals inhabiting deserted and dismal places.^ The Egyptian eagle 
owl {Bubo ascalaphits) and the little owl {Athene gJaux) are the most 
common species in Palestine. The latter known by the name of Boomeh

among- the Arabs, is also called the "mother of ruins," as no ruin or 
tomb of pretension will readily be found without one. This species is 
a great favorite with the Arabs, being regarded as lucky and friendly 
to man. 

Partridge {Caccabis chucar, Hebrew Qore). — Reference is made to 
the partridge in Samuel xxvi, 20, "as when one dotli hunt a partridge 
in the mountains," and in Jeremiah xvii, 11, as the partridge (margin 
of Eevised Version "sitteth on eggs which she hath not laid,") "gath- 
ereth young which she hath not brought forth," alluding to the ancient 
belief that the partridge was in the habit of stealing eggs and hatching 
them. Besides the chucar partridge, Hey's sand partridge {Amnoperdix 
heyi) is abundant in Palestine and in Sinai. 

Peacock {Favo cristatus; Hebrew, Tukkiyim). — The peacock is men- 
tioned among the animals brought by Solomon's shii)S from Tarshish.^ 
It is an Indian bird, and the Hebrew name can be traced to the Tamil 
tol<ei Malabar togai^ tdghai, "the crested bird." In some parts of India 
it is very abundant and almost domesticated. It is venerated by the 
Hindus, and large flocks are kept at their temples. It made its appear- 
ance in Greece in the middle of the fifth century B. C, and was adopted 
at Samos as the sacred bird of Hera (Juno) at the temple of that goddess, 
the Heranim. 

Pelican {PelecanHs onoerotalns ; Hebrew, Qcv'atli). — The pelican is one 
of the unclean birds,' being regarded as an emblem of desolation and 
ruin.^ From the habit of this bird of storing quantities of food in the 
large pouch attached to its lower mandible, for the pur])ose of feeding 
its young, which it does by pressing its beak against its breast, the 
fable arose that the pelican opened its breast with its beak and fed its 
young with its own blood, which seemed to derive support from the red 
tips at the end of the bill. Besides the common white pelican another 
species, the Dalmatian pelican [Peleeanus crispus), is found, but less 
commonly, on the coast of Syria. 

Quail {Cotumlv commicnis; Hebrew, Selav). — Quails are mentioned 
in the Bible only in connection with the miraculous supply of food which 
they formed for the Israelites upon two occasions, in the wilderness of 
Sin^ and at Kibroth Hataavah,'^ They are the smallest representatives 
of the partridge family and breed in numbers in Palestine. They 
arrive in vast flocks by night in March and a few remain throughout 
.the winter. Their flesh is considered a delicacj^ 

Raven {Corrus corax ; Hebrew, Oreb). — The raven is the first bird 
mentioned by name in the Bible :** "And he sent forth a raven, and it

went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth." 
It was forbidden for food.' In several passages the raven is referred 
to as illustrating the care with which God watches over his creatures.^ 
"He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.'" 
"Who provideth for the raven his food, when his young ones cry unto 
God, and wander for lack of meat."^ "Consider the ravens, that tliey 
sow not, neither reap ; which have no store chamber nor barn ; and God 
feedeth them ; of how much more value are ye than the birds." The 
custom of the ravens of attacking the eyes of young or sickly animals 
is alluded to in Proverbs xxx, 17: "The eye that mocketh at his father 
and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it 
out, and the young eagles shall eat it." The raven and allied species 
are abundant in Palestine. 

Sparrow {Passer domesticus ; Hebrew, ^Ippor). — The Hebrew word 
gipjyor denotes birds in general, being used especially, however, of small 
birds. In the following passages it appears to refer to the sparrow in 
particular: Psalm Ixxxiv, 3: "The sparrow hath found her an house, 
and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young;" and 
Psalms cii, 7 : "I watch, and become like a sparrow that is alone upon 
the house top." Jesus refers to the sparrow in illustration of God's 
benignant care of his creatures:^ "Are not two sparrows sold for a 
farthing? and not one of them shall fall to the ground without your 
Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not 
therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows."^ Several species 
of the sparrow occur in great abundance in Palestine, especially on the 
Plain of Gennesareth. 

Black Stork {Ciconia nigra; Hebrew, Hasidah). — The stork was 
accounted an unclean bird.^ It is a migrant,^ "Yea, the stork in the 
heavens knoweth her appointed times," and built its nest in "the fir 
trees."^ The Hebrew name Hasidah means the kind, the pious one 
(Latin, pia avis), owing to the filial piety and devotion which was 
attributed by the ancients to this bird. 

The passage in Job xxxix, 13: "The wing of the ostrich rejoiceth, 
but her pinions and feathers are kindly (Hebrew, hasidah^ is thought 
to contain an allusion to the stork, whose treatment of the young is so 
different from that of the hard-breasted ostrich. '"^ 

Owing to this belief and to its feeding on noxious reptiles and insects

the stork is a protected bird, and iu parts of Europe and the East there 
is a heavy fiue for molesting either the storks or their nests. Both the 
black and the white stork {Ciconia alba) occur in Palestine, the latter 
chiefly in winter; the former a migrant, passing to the north. 

Swallow {Ghelidon ruatica; Hebrew, Sis, 8us, and Deror). — The 
swallow is referred to in Jeremiah viii, 7, as one of the birds which 
"observe the time of their coming." "As the sparrow in her wan- 
dering, as the swallow in her flying, so the curse that is causeless 
lighteth not."i Psalms, Ixxxiv, 3: "Yea, tlie sparrow hath found her 
an house and the swallow a nest for herself." There are about half a 
dozen species of the swallow, and the closely allied martin, in Palestine. 
The common swallow abounds in the Mosque of Omar. 

Griffon vulture ( Gyps fulvus). — As was stated above under eagle, 
the Hebrew Weslier, Avhich is rendered in the p]nglish Bible "eagle" 
comprises large predatory birds iu general. Thus in Jeremiah xlix, 16, 
and Job xxxix, 27-30, the "eagle" is referred to as making its nest in 
the highest cliffs. "O, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, 
that boldest the height of the hill ; though tliou shouldest make thy nest 
as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the 
Lord": "Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest 
on high? She dwelleth on the rock, and hath her lodging there, upon 
the crag of the rock, and the strong hold." This is especially charac- 
teristic of the griffon vulture. The passage in Micah i, 16; "Make thee 
bald * * * enlarge thy baldness as the eagle" can only refer to the 
vulture, which is devoid of true feathers on the head and neck. The 
griffon vulture is most abundant in Palestine. It breeds in colonies of 
aeries, the most notable of which are at Wady Kelt near Jericho, 
Mount Nebo,in the gorges of the Jabbok and the Litany lliver, at Mount 
Oarmel, and in the valleys leading into the Plain of Genessareth. 

reptiles. 

But four specimens of the reptiles of the Bible were exhibited. 

FroGt (Hebrew, (^-efardea). — The frog is only mentioned in the Old 
Testament as the second plague inflicted on Egypt.^ In Revelations 
xvi, 13, unclean spirits are spoken of as being in the likeness of frogs, 
which come out of the mouth of the dragon. The edible frog [Rana 
esculenta) is the only species which at present occurs in Egypt. In 
Palestine are found the green toad {Bufo viridis), and less commonly 
the African toad {Bufo regularis). The little tree frog {Hyla arborea) 
is also common in Sinai and Palestine. 

Lizard. — Leviticus xi, 30, mentions the names of a number of animals 
which are included among the creeping things that creep upon the earth. 
The Leta'ah {Lacerta viridis and L. agilis) is the only one traditionally 
rendered by lizard ; but the present opinion is that the other names 

1 Proverbs xxvi, 2 ; compare Isaiah xxxviii, 14. 

« Exodus viii, 2-14; compare Psalms Ixxvii, 46; cv, 30. 



^()6 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

are also kinds of lizards — the Kevised Version furnishes this state- 
ment in the margin and translates great lizard, lizard, sand lizard, etc. 
The best lexicograi)hical authority agrees with this view. Nor are we 
to be surprised at this number of words in Hebrew for lizard, since 
they are very abundant in Palestine, about forty species having been 
enumerated. Among the most common is the green lizard and its 
varieties. 

YiPER {Vipera a.spis; Uehrew, Ef eh). — The generic name in Hebrew 
of any serpent is Nahash. The serpent is first mentioned in Genesis 
iii, 1, 13, where it is said to be more subtle than all the beasts of the 
field. Jesus alludes to the wisdom of the serpent,^ "Be ye therefore 
wise as serpents and harmless as doves." The different species are 
referred to by various names — pethen, sliejiforij 'alishuh, and gif on% 
usually rendered by adder. The viper is mentioned in Isaiah xxx, 6; 
lix, 5; Job xx, 10: "The viper's tongue shall slay him," and often in 
the New Testament.^ It is assumed that the viper that fastened on 
the hand of the Aiiostle Paul-^ was the Vipera aspis. Upward of thirty 
species have been found in Palestine. 

INSECTS; 

Six specimens of the insects of the Bible concluded the illustration 
of the Biblical fauna. 

Horsefly {Mippohosca equina; Hebrew, Aroh). — It is probable that 
the horsefly is meant by arob (English versions, "swarms of flies," 
" divers sorts of flies"), sent as a plague upon Egypt.^ The rendering, 
"swarms of flies," as indicating a mixture of various insects, is very 
old, being found in the Talmud and in Jerome. The horsefly in Egypt 
settles on the human body, sucks blood, and produces festering sores. 
It is also the means of spreading ophthalmia. 

Breeze flies [JKematopotaphirialis and Chrysops-coecutiens, Hebrew 
Zehuh). — The name Zehub occurs but twice in the Old Testament, Isaiah 
vii, 18, as a figure of swarming and troublesome armies coming from 
Egypt, "The Lord shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of 
the rivers of Egypt and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria;" 
and Ecclesiastes x, 1, as corrupting ointment, "Dead flies cause the 
ointment of the perfumer to send forth a stinking savor; so doth a 
little folly outweigh wisdom and honor." A species of Tahanus or 
breeze fly is common in the valleys of the Jordan and the Nile, and is 
very injurious to animals; it attacks both man and beast."* 

The Phenicians invoked against the flies Baalzebub,^ the lord of flies, 
the god of Ekron.'

EXHIBIT OF KIHLICAL ANTIQUITIES. 967 

Sacked scarabaeus {Ateuchus sacer). — The Ateucnm was- wor- 
shiped by the aiuiieut Egyptians, aud often represented by hiero- 
glyphics and on monuments. Models of them in the most precious 
materials were worn as charms aud buried with mummies. The insects 
themselves have also been found in coffins. It may be that the worship 
of the scarabaeus in Egypt was in some way connected with that of 
Baalzebub, the lord of flies, in Ekron.' 

Hornet ( Vespa orientalis; Hebrew, ^irah). — Hornets are spoken of 
in the Bible as an instrument in God's hands for the punishment and 
expulsion of the Canaanites.^ " I will send the hornet before thee, 
which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaauite, and the Hittite from 
before thee." ' It is assumed by some that they are used tiguratively 
for panic or terror. Hornets are abundant in Palestine, and were so 
in former times, as is perhaps indicated from the name of the city in 
Judah, (j^ore'ah, '-place of hornets." There are at present four species 
in Palestine; the most common is ^'espa orientalis. 

Locust [Acridium pereijrinmn; Hebrew, Arbeh). — Of all the "creep- 
ing creatures" the locust is most frequently mentioned in the Bible. It 
occurs under nine different names {haf/ah, hargol, sol am, gazam, yeleq, 
hasil, geb or gob, gelagal), which probably denote different species. 
Locusts were one of the ten plagues inflicted on Egypt.^ They were 
permitted as food,' aud were the chief food of John the Baptist,^ 
Among the Moorish Arabs they are held in high esteem as a stimulant, 
and in Central Arabia they are regarded as a dainty. Their appearance, 
habits, ravages, etc., are often referred to figuratively in the Scriptures 
as destructive armies, Nahum iii, 15-17: "Make thyself many as the 
locusts. * * * Thy crowned are as the locusts and thy marshals 
as the swarms of grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold 
day, but when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their i^lace is not 
known where they are:"" "Aud the shapes of the locusts were like 
unto horses prepared for war * * *,"etc. In Proverbs xxx, 27, they 
are enumerated among the "four things which are little upon the earth, 
but they are exceeding wise," " The locusts have no king, yet they go 
forth all of them by bands." 

Moth (Hebrew, Ash, Sas). — The destructiveness of the moth and its 
own extreme frailty are often referred to in the Bible as an illustration 
of the i)erishable nature of temporal things." " Behold they all shall 
w;ix old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up." ^ "Lay not up for

moths, are referred to. 

PALESTINIAN ANTIQUITIES. 

The next group consisted of a selection of objects from the antiquities 
and art of the peO})les who were connected with the history told in the 
Scriptures. They were put on exhibition for the purpose of enabling 
the student or visitor to place himself in the position of one who lived 
in the times and the lands in which the books of the Bible were 
composed. 

Of monuments and relics found in Palestine itself, the following were 
shown : 

Cast of the Moabite stone. — In II Kings iii it is related that 
Mesha, the king of Moab, paid tribute to the kings of Israel, but that 
after the death of Ahab ho rebelled. Thereupon Ahab's son, Joram, 
allied with Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, invaded Moab and shut up 
Mesha in Kir-Hareseth, situated a little to the east of the southern end 
of the Dead Sea. Mesha, in this emergency, ottered his first born son 
as a sacrifice, in the presence of the invading army, to Ohemosh, the 
principal divinity of the Moabites; whereupon the Israelites withdrew. 
Tiuis far the Biblical account. 

In 1868 the Eev. A. F. Klein, a German missionary, discovered at 
Dhiban, the ruins of Dibon, the ancient capital of Moab,^ a stone or stela 
with an inscription celebrating the achievements of Mesha. It was of 
dark blue basalt, 3 feet 8i inches high, 2 feet 3^ inches wide, and 1 foot 
1.78 inches thick, rounded at both ends and inscribed with thirty-four 
lines. The stone was in possession of the Beni Humaydah, a wild 
Arab tribe east of the Jordan. The Arabs, considering the stone so 
eagerly sought after by Europeans to be possessed of supernatural 
power, lit a fire under it and then threw cold water upon it, breaking 
it into fragments, which were distributed as charms among the diflerent 
families of the tribe. M. Clermont G-anneau, at that time chancellor of 
the French consulate, had, previous to the breaking of the stone, been 
so fortunate as to obtain a paper impression of the entire inscription. 
Afterwards by careful work he succeeded in collecting most of the 
fragments, so that six-sevenths of the inscription has been preserved 
and two-thirds of the stone itself is now in the Louvre at Paris. 

In the inscri])tion Mesha relates that Omri and Ahab had oppressed 
the land of Moab for many years, until he recovered several cities from

the Israelites, mentioning Medeba,' Atarotb,- and iSTebo,' where he slew 
7,000 people and captnred Jahaz, which had been built by the King of 
Israel. At the conclusion he also mentions a battle against Horonaim, 
which is generally interpreted as referring to a successful war with the 
Edomites who might have invaded the country from the south. It will 
thus be seen that the contents of this comparatively brief historical 
document add considerably to our knowledge of the happenings in the 
ancient world in the ninth century B. C. The dialect of the inscrip- 
tion differs but slightly from Hebrew, and the characters employed are 
those of ancient Hebrew, the so-called Samaritan or Phenician. Aside 
from its historical interest just mentioned, the Moabite stone is the 
most important surviving relic of the Moabite civilization. It is the 
oldest monument bearing a Semitic inscription, and its discovery was 
of great importance for the history of the development of the alphabet, 
proving, as it does, that the Greeks added nothing to the alphabet 
which they received from the East.^ 

Oast of the Siloam inscription. — The pool or fountain of Siloam, 
Hebrew, Shiloah, i. e., "sending,"' is mentioned in Isaiah viii, 6; "the 
waters of Shiloah that go softly"^ where Jesus sends a blind man to 
wash in the pool "and he came seeing." It is at the southeast end of 
Jerusalem and was fed by the waters of a spring of the Gihon, the 
moderu fountain of the Virgin, with which it is connected by a winding 
tunnel, cut for a distance of 1,708 feet through the solid rock. 

The Siloam inscription was accidentally discovered in June, 1880, by 
a schoolboy, who, while i)laying with other boys near the pool of 
Siloam and wading up a channel cut in the rock which leads into the 
pool, slipped and fell into the water. On rising to the surface he 
noticed what looked like letters on the wall of the channel; this fact he 
reported to Mr. Schick, the well-known architect and archteologist of 
Jerusalem. Mr. Schick announced the discovery to the German Pales- 
tine Exploration Society (Deutscher Palaestina Verein), and with much 
labor made copies during the winter of 1880-81, which were sent to Eu- 
rope. Owing, however, to the fact that the characters had become tilled 
with a deposit of lime these copies were practically unintelligible.*'

level of the water in the cliaunel to render the inscription accessible. Dr. Guthe,

claims that it was done at the expense of the German Palestine Kxploration Society ; 
while the same claim is made for the London Palestine Exploration Fund. Quar-

970 REPORT OP NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

The first legible copies were made by Prof. A. H. Sayce, wlio came 
to Jerusalem iu February, 1881. He spent three afternoons in the 
tunnel, sitting- in water 4 to 6 inches deep, the conduit being dimly 
lighted by a c;indle held by his companion, Mr. Slater.' Another copy 
was independently made by the Eev. VV. T. Filter. 

In March, 1881, Dr. Guthe, head of the German Palestine Explora- 
tion Society, went to Jerusalem, and after making as exact a drawing 
as possible of the inscription as it stood, he removed the lime deposit 
by the application of hydrochloric acid. This rendered feasible the 
taking of an adequate impression of the inscription. Squeezes and 
plaster impressions were subsequently made by Dr. Guthe, Lieuts. 
Claude K. Gonder and Mantel.^ 

In 1891 the Siloam inscription was cut out of its place in the tunnel 
and carried away. It was found in the house of a Greek living near 
Jerusalem on the Hebron road, and the fact reported to the authorities 
at Gonstantinopie. The Turkish law makes all monuments public 
property, and the minister of public instruction ordered the inscrip- 
tion sent to Gonstantinopie. So important, however, was the matter 
deemed that it was considered at a council of ministers, and a peremp- 
tory telegram was sent by the Grand Vizier to the Pasha of Jerusalem 
to use all means to secure possession of this priceless monument and 
forward it with dispatch to the capital.^ This action had the desired 
result and the Siloam inscription is now preserved at the Imperial 
]\Iuseum in Gonstantinopie. 

The contents of the inscription, which consists of six lines, are as 
follows: "Behold the excavation! And this was the manner of the 
excavation, while [the excavators] were lifting up the pick, each to his 
neighbor, and while 3 cubits [of rock remained] the voice of one called 
to his fellow- workman, for there was a fissure iu. the rock on the right 
hand. * * * And on the day [or, to the west] of the excavation 
the excavators struck, each so as to meet his fellow, pick against pick, 
and there flowed the water from the source to the pool through the 
spa{;e of 1,000 cubits, and * * * cubit was the height of the rock 
over the head of the excavation." 

The inscription would seem to show that the work of excavation was 
undertaken simultaneously from both ends by two gangs of workmen, 
and that for want of engineering skill the borings overlapped. 

Judging by the form of the letters the inscription must have origi- 
nated between the eighth and sixth centuries. The most generally 
accepted opinion is, that it dates from the reign of Ilezekiah, and is 
referred to in II Ghrcmicles xxxii, 4 and 30: " So there was gathered 
much x>eople together, and they stopped all the fountains, and the 
brook that flowed through the midst of the land, saying, why should

the kings of Assyria come and find mucli water T' and "This same 
Hezekiah also stopped the upper springs of the waters of Gihon, and 
brought them straight down on the west side of the City of David." 
It is certainly one of the oldest known Hebrew inscriptions.' 

Cast op the Lachish tablet. — Lachish was one of the capitals 
of the Canaanites, situated southeast of Jerusalem, between Gaza and 
Eleutheropolis. It was concjuered by Joshua.'^ The Assyrian King 
Sennacherib besieged it during his invasion of Judah, 701 B. C.,' and, 
according to the Assyrian inscriptions, captured it. An interesting- 
Assyrian relief represents Sennacherib seated on a throne receiving 
the tribute of his captives and vassals, accompanied by an inscription 
containing the statement that the decree was enacted at Lachish. 
Later on it succumbed to Nebuchadnezzar. The ruins of ancient Lach- 
ish. now called Tell el-Hesy, have been explored during the last few 
years by the Palestine Exploration Fund, and in 1892 Dr. F. Jones 
Bliss, an American archaeologist in charge of the work, discovered 
there a small clay tablet, inscribed' with cuneiform characters, and in a 
Semitic dialect akin to the Aramaic. The inscription dates before the 
conquest of Palestine by the Israelites, and contains a letter from the 
chief of the territory adjoining Lachish, probably to the governor of 
Lachish, complaining that marauders from the neighboring region are 
besetting Atim, which is probably identical with Etam, in the south of 
Judah, mentioned in I Chronicles iv, 32, and Samhi or Sam'a, now 
probably represented by the large ruin of Sam'ah, 5 miles to the south of 
Etam. The original is now in possession of the Turkish Government.^ 

Cast of the seal of Haggai, son of Shebaniah. — The origi- 
nal seal of black stone was found in 1857 by Sir Charles Warren, near 
the Haram-esh-Sherif, the mosque of Omar on the site of the temi)le 
at Jerusalem.^ The names Haggai and Shebaniah, which the seal 
bears, have not been identified. They are possibly connected with the 
rebuilding of the temple after the exile. 

The use of seals or signet rings is already mentioned in the Patri- 
archal epoch.^ The seal was either hung on a string around the neck

or worn in rings on the finger;^ "thougli Coniah, the son of Jehoiakim, 
King of Judab, were the signet upon my riglit hand, yet I would pluck

"So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal;" 
for sealing purses.^ "My transgression is sealed up in a bag," doors 
and the like.* " So they went and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the 
stone." The custom of making an impression with the seal upon the 
forehead-of a person is alluded to in the Epistle to the Galatians vi, 
17: "I bear branded on my body the marks of Jesus," and Revelations 
vii, 3 and 4: "Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we 
shall have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads." 

Biblical weights. — The weights (like the measures) of the 
Hebrews are usually traced to the Babylonian system, which is con- 
sidered the parent of other oriental systems. The unit of the Hebrew 
weights was the shekel ; the other weights were either its multiples or 
fractions. The weights mentioned in the Bible are as follows: Talent^ 
(kUdar), equals 60 minas or 3,600 shekels, equal to about 674,000 grains 
Troy; mina^ {maneh), equals 60 shekels, equal to about 11,000 grains 
Troy; shekel (sheqel), equal to about 220 grains, one-twentieth {gerah) 
of a shekel,' or about 11 grains.^ Scales, mo^znayim, consisted of a 
beam resting at its central point on a standard, and having suspended 
from its two ends two scales or basins in which the weights and the 
substances to be weighed were placed respectively.'* Alongside of the 
moznayhn there is also mentioned ^;eZes,^" which is assumed to answer to 
the modern steelyard, also called Eomau balance or beam, consisting 
of a lever in the form of a slender iron bar with one arm very short, 
the other divided by equidistant notches, having a small cross piece as 
a fulcrum to which a bearing for suspension is attached, usually a hook 
at the short end, and a weight moving upon the long arm. The weights 
themselves were called in the Hebrew " stones," rendered "weights" 
in the English versions. 

Cast of an ancient Hebrew weight. — The original, which is of 
hematite, was obtained by Dr. Th. Chaplin, in Samaria. The weight is 
spindle shaped, somewhat flattened on one side, and weighs about 40 
grains. It has on both sides a Hebrew legend, which is interpreted to 
mean " Quarter of a quarter of ne(;eg," which may have been a stand- 
ard weight in Palestine."

was obtained by Prof. T. F. Wright, in Jerusalem. It weighs 134 
grains, and is inscribed with the word ne^eg in the same characters as 
those of the Siloam inscription. It was probably used as a weight, 
and the inscription may mean " standard weight." ' 

MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS. 

As of great general interest for the history of culture there was 
shown a collection of musical instruments mentioned in the Bible, sup- 
plemented by photographs and casts of representations of musical 
instruments on ancient monuments. Scarcely any authentic informa- 
tion is preserved concerning the shape or the manner of playing on 
the musical instruments named in the Bible. The instruments exhibited 
were such as are now in use in the Oriental countries. But it may be 
assumed that the musical instruments of the Hebrews resembled those 
of the nations with which they came in contact, and that, considering 
the stability and conservatism of the East, the instruments still used 
in Palestine, Syria, and Egypt differ but little, if at all, from those 
employed in ancient times. 

It is well known that music occupies an important place in the Bible. 
Its invention is recorded in the opening chapters of the Scriptures, 
where Jubal is named as the "father (i. e., founder) of all such as handle 
the harp and pipe."* From the earliest times music was of high impor- 
tance among the Israelites, accompanying all the great national events 
and adorning the festal occasions. The hymn of thanksgiving after the 
deliverance from the bondage of Egypt and the passing through the 
Bed Sea^ was accom])anied by the sound of timbrels and by dances of 
a choir of women led by the prophetess Miriam.^ The solemnity of the 
giving of the law on Sinai was enhanced by the sound of the horn or 
shofar,^ and the same instrument is mentioned at the capture of Jericho, 
the first conquest made in the Promised Land.*" The sound of trumpets 
and of the horn announced and inaugurated the great festivals and the 
year of ^' Jubilee.""^ 

But music also permeated the common daily life in Israel, and the 
absence of the "mirth of tabrets" and the "joy of the harj)" was one of 
the signs of a national calamity.'' It was the pastime of the shepherd 5" 
it formed the principal attraction of the social gatherings of youth at 
the city gatesj '" it heightened the mirth at the festivals of the harvest

and viutage; ' it contributed to the pleasure and festivity of the banquet ;2 
the victors in battle were received on their return with "singing, dan- 
cing, and timbrels."^ In short, music seems to have been the indispen- 
sable accompaniment of everj^ public occasion, whether joyous or sad.^ 

But it was in religious worship that music attained its highest 
development in Israel, and it is to the time of David that the extensive 
use of music in religious service, both vocal and instrumental, was 
ascribed. From the 38,000 Levites 4,000 were elected and organized 
under 288 leaders into a chorus and orchestra to provide for the music 
of the sanctuary. The 288 classes were separated into 42 divisions 
under the sons of Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman, as masters, and the 
entire chorus and orchestra was under the direction of Asaph, 
Jeduthun, and Heman." These sanctuary musicians also officiated at 
the dedication of the temple by Solomon.'^ Under the later idolatrous 
kings it may be assumed that the music, like the worship of the temple, 
was often neglected. It is, on the other hand, especially mentioned 
that the pious kings, Hezekiah and Josiah, gave much attention to the 
nuisical services of the temple." Jt was employed at the restoration of 
the temple and the walls of Jerusalem after the return from the exile;" 
and from post-biblical writings, ei'ipecially Josephus, it is known that it 
continued to form a prominent fet^ture of Jewish worship. 

The musical instruments mentioned in the Bible may be divided, 
after the usual classifications, into the following groups: 

(1) Instruments of percussion, which were beaten or shaken to pro- 
duce sound for the purpose of reguhiting the rhythmic element in 
music. These instruments were presumably the first used, and are 
still common among the less cultivated peoples. 

(2) Wind instrumejits. 

(3) String instruments, which were always played with the fingers or 
with the plectrum, and not, like the modern violin, with a bow. 

Of the instruments mentioned in the Bible, two — the ram's horn and 
the trumpet — are commanded to be used for sacred purposes.^ These 
two instruments are also the only ones concerning. whose shape there 
is absolute certainty. 

Of the trumpet there is a representation extant on the Arch of Titus 
at Rome, while there is no doubt that the ram's horn which is still used 
in the synagogue has conserved its antique form.'"

Plate 1, 





EXHIBIT OF BIBLICAL ANTIQUITIES. 975 

The instruments exhibited, of which illustrations are given here, 
were as follows: 

I.— INSTRUMENTS OF PERCUSSION. 

(1) EouND TABRET, Hand-drum (Hebrew, Tof). — From Beirut, 
Syria, where it is called rikk. (See plate 1, fig. 3.) The Arabic name 
duff agrees with the Hebrew, and is the parent of the Spanish aduffa. 

The tablet or timbrel is mentioned in Genesis xxxi, 27. Its use sur- 
vived from the earliest time to the present day in Asia, Greece, and 
Italy. On old Grecian monuments the tabret is seen in the hands 
of Bacchantes and priests of Cybele. On the Egyi)tiaii sculptures two 
forms of the tabret are represented, the round and the four-sided. 
The use of the striker seems not to have been known in antiquity. 
The tabret was beaten with the hand and was suspended from the 
neck by a ribbon. Later modifications of the tabret resemble our 
drum and the kettle dram. Tlie use of the tabret was confined to joy- 
ous occasions. It served with other instruments of song' to accentuate 
the rhythm of the dance.^ It was played mostly by women, accompany- 
ing the harp and Inte, at joyous feasts,^ at the reception of victorious 
generals,^ at banquets,^^ and at weddings.'' In solemn processions it was 
also j)layed by men.^ The tabret is not mentioned among the instru- 
ments used in the religious services of the tabernacle or temple. 

(2) Four-sided tabret, Morocco, Africa. (See plate 1, fig. 4.) 

(3) Kettledrum (Arabic, Naggarah), Cairo, Egypt. (See plate 1, 
fig. 5.) — The kettledrum is made either of wood or copper, one side 
being rounded, the other fiat, on which the skin (of a goat or gazelle) is 
stretched. It is now used in military bands, orchestras, and short solo 
passages. It is also employed by the dervishes to produce excitement 
in their devotions. The kettledrum is sounded with blows from a soft- 
headed, elastic mallet, stick, or a leather thong. 

(4) Cymbals {Hebrew, 31egi It ay im, (^el<;elhn). (See plate ], tig. 2.) 
These two Hebrew words, which are usually considered identical, are 
plainly onomatopoeic. Though it is hardly likely that they indicated 
the same instrument, we have at i^resent no certain method of dif- 
fercLtiating them. Megiltayim is almost invariably in the dual form, 
which indicates two similar parts, and in one passage^ the material of 
which they were made, cop[)er or brass, is named. Cymbals are 
mentioned only in connection with religious ceremonies.^

976 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

The cymbals now used in the Orient are inucli like those depicted 
on the Egyptian and Assyrian monuments. They consisted o^:' two 
large plates of metal with wide, Hat rims, and were played by being 
strapped to the hands and clashed together. Others were conical, or 
cup-like, with thin edges, and were played by bringing down the one 
sharply on the other, while held stationary, eliciting a high-pitched 
note. Cymbals were made of brass, and it is probable that they were 
the first among musical instruments made of metal. They were repre- 
sented by a specimen from Cairo, Egypt, called by the Arabs Ka's. 

(5) Castanets. — (See plate 1, fig. 1.) Some scholars apply the 
Hebrew names for cymbals, ^el^elim and Megiltayim, which denote a 
jingling sound, also to castanets; others think these are meant by the 
^ilgele-stema (R. Y. "Loud cymbals") Psalms cl, 5. But this is by no 
means certain. 

II.— wind instruments. 

(1) Ram's horn (Hebrew, Shofar). (See plate 2, fig. 2.)— The Shofar, 
in the English versions usually inaccurately translated trumpet, or 
even more inaccurately cornet, is first mentioned in the Bible in con- 
nection with the giving of the law on Siuai.^ Its use is ordered in the 
Pentateuch for the announcement of the new moon and solemn feasts^ 
and the proclamation of the year of release.^ New Year's Day (the 
first of the seventh month, or Tishri) is called a ',' memorial day of 
blowing."* The Shofar also served in religious processions,^ and is 
mentioned, along with other musical instruments as a proper accom- 
paniment of psalmody: "Praise Him with the blowing of the shofar, 
praise Him with the psaltery and harp.'"' But the most ancient and most 
frequent use of the shofar was for military purposes, to give the signal 
for the rallying of the people and for attacking and pursuing the 
enemy. Animal horns were similarly used in tlie Roman army." The 
shofar is not only the sole instrument of those mentioned in the Bible 
which is still employed by the Jews in their religious services of the 
synagogue during the penitential month of Elul (July-August), on 
New Year's Day, or Rosli ha-Shanah, the first of Tishri (August-Sep- 
tember), and on Atonement Day, or Yom Kippur, the tenth of Tishri, 
but is also, according to authorities on musical instruments, the oldest 
form of wind instrument known to be retained in use. It is usually 
made of a ram's horn, though the goat's horn is also employed."

(2) Trumpet (Hebrew, Hagogerah), Morocco, where it is called n'feer. 
(See plate 3.)— The trumpet was expressly designed in the Pentateuch 
for sacred uses, two being ordered to be made of silver,' while Solomon 
increased their number to one hundred and twenty.' It was almost 
exclusively a priestly instrument.'^ Its primary use was for giving sig- 
nals for the people to assemble.^ Later it was appropriated to religious 
services^ and festive occasions.'^ According to the representation on 
the Arch of Titus, the trumpet was narrow and straight, with a ball like 
protuberance at the bottom. It was represented by its modern survisal, 
the n^eer of Morocco. The instrument itself was supplemented by a 
photograpli of the Arcli of Titus. (See i)late 5.) 

(3) Flute or pipe (Hebrew, Halil; Eevised Version, ilute.) Dam- 
ascus, Syria. (See plate 2, fig. 4.) The pipe or flute, now called in 
Syria Sli ithah, was a favorite instrument of the ancients. In its simplest 
form it was a reed or variety of wood in the shape of a reed, about 18 
inches in length, bored throughout evenly, and pierced with holes in 
the sides for note.s. Later, even ivory was employed. A variety of 
flutes are exhibited in the representations of Egyptian, Oriental, and 
Grecian musical instruments. They may be divided into simple flutes, 
which were either direct or transverse double flutes with even or uneven 
tubes, and those with several tubes. 

The invention of the simi)le flute is ascribed by the Greeks to the 
Egyptians;" that of the transverse flute likewise to the Egyptians,^ 
or to the Lybians.'' The double flute is seen on Egyi)tian and Assyrian 
monuments. Among the Greeks and Komans the flute was played by 
the Bacchants, at funerals, and also at festive banquets. The Lacedae- 
monians, Cretans, and Lybians used it also for military purposes. In 
the Bible the flute is not mentioned among the musical instruments of 
the Temple; but it was emjDloyed on various festal occasions — at the 
accession of Solomon to the throne^" and other festivities," as well as at 
funerals.^'- According to post Biblical sources of information, flutes 
were used in the daily service of the second temple.'-*

phony) in Daniel iii, 5, 10, 15. Tlie Authorized and Revised Versions 
give dulcimer, though the margin of the latter gives bagpipe. Engel' 
says that the Italian peasantry still call a bagpipe Zanumgna, and 
according to the last edition of Gesenius Sajnbonjo ami Zampogna have 
also i>ersisted in Asia Minor. Sunqxyniah is supposed by some to be a 
translation of the Hebrew 'ugab, though the latter possibly represents 
pan pipes. 

(5) Reeds or pan pipes, Cairo, Egypt. (See plate 2, fig. 1.) The 
reeds now called in Egypt sofafir are probably the Hebrew 'ugabr 
They were known to the Greeks under the name of syrinx (Latin fis- 
tula). There was shown in addition to the Egyptian instrument an 
Assyrian bas-relief representing a flute player. (See plate 3.) 

(6) BAaPiPE, represented by an instrument from Tunis, Africa, 
where it is called zaida, possibly Aramaic Sumponiah mentioned in 
Daniel iii, 5, 10. (See plate 6.) The bagpipe originated in the East, and 
was known to the Greeks and Romans.^ It was popular throughout 
the middle ages and is still used in many easterji countries and among 
the country people of Poland, Italy, the south of France, and in Scot- 
land and Ireland. 

III.— STRINGED INSTRUMENTS. 

(1) Harp. — The Hebrew word Kirmor, which is adopted for harp, 
occurs in the opening chapters of the Bible.* It was the especial 
instrument of David.-' Later it was one of the important instruments 
of the Temple orchestra,'' being one of the instruments most frequently 
mentioned in the Bible."^ To judge from representations on Egyptian 
monuments and Jewish coins of the second century B. C, the Kinnor 
resembled the Greek Kithara more than the modern trigonal harj), a 
theory corroborated by the fact that the Hebrew Kmnor is usually 
rendered Kithara {uidapa) by the Septuagint, the oldest Greek version 
of the Old Testament. Jewish coins show lyres with three, five, and 
six strings. 

A similar instrument was also in use among the Assyrians. In its 
smaller form it could easily be carried about in processions, as the rep- 
resentations on the monuments, both Egyptian and Assyrian, show. 
(A photograph of a relief of an Assyrian harp player was exhibited. 
See plate 7.) 

(2) Psaltery oe Dulcimer (Hebrew, Nebel). (See plate 8.) Next 
to the harp (Icitmor) and mostly in conjunction with it, the psaltery is

most frequently mentioned in the Bible. It is likely tliat the psaltery 
resembled what is now known in the East as the tamboora or guitar, 
an instrument which also figures largely on the Egyptian and Assyrian 
monuments. In its present shape the psaltery is thus described : " In 
its most complete and perfect form this instrument is 3 feet 9 inches 
long, has ten strings of fine wire and forty-seven stops. It is played 
with a i)lectrum, and is often inlaid with mother of- pearl and valuable 
woods. It is oftener, however, of smaller size and less costly mate- 
rials." ' Others assume that the nebel resembled tlie harp-shaped instru- 
ments seen on Assyrian monuments. In Psalms xxxiii, 2, ncbel asor, the 
" nehel of ten," probably ten strings, is mentioned. This would curiously 
agree in detail with the instrument described above. EngeP assumes 
that there is an independent instrument called the asor, which is sup- 
ported by Psalms xcii, 3, " with an instrument of ten strings, and with 
the psaltery." ' 

PRECIOUS STONES OF THE BIBLE. 

The use of precious stones for ornament, as well as with engrav- 
ing for signets and the like, was well known to all of the Mediterranean 
peoples, and quite a goodly number of them are mentioned in the Bible. 

The engraving of signets uj)on hard stones was practiced at an early 
period. The Israelites may have acquired tlie art from the Egyptians, 
who are known to have made use of the lapidary's wheel and emery 
powder, and are supposed to have been acquainted with the diamond 
and the method of engraving other stones by means of it. The 
Assyrians and Babylonians were very skillful in engraving on gems, 
many of which have been found in the ruins of their palaces and cities. 

The sources for the names of gems in the Bible are three almost 
identical lists: 

I. The description of the High Priest's "breastplate of judgment" 
{hoshen ha-mishpat), in which were placed, in gold setting, four rows of 
precious stones, three in each row, engraved with the names of the 
twelve tribes of Israel.* 

II. The description of the ornaments of the King of Tyre.^ 

III. The description of the foundation of the Heavenly Oity.*^ 

In many instances the exact equivalent of the biblical names of 
precious stones is uncertain in the nomenclature of modern mineralogy. 
In the following tables are given, alongside of the original and the 
Septuagint, the meaning adopted by most authorities, the rendering

of the Revised Version, both in the text and margin, being added in 
pareutheses. 

Besides the stones enumerated in these lists, there are probably 
mentioned, first, diamond, Hebrew shmnir, for which the following pas- 
sages serve as illustrations: Jeremiah xvii, 1: "The sin of Judah is 
written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond;" Ezekiel 
iii, 9: "As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead;" 
Zechariah vii, 12: "Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, 
lest they should hear the law;" second, amber (margin of Ee vised Ver- 
sion, following the Septuagint and Vulgate, electrum), Hebrew, hashmal, 
Ezekiel i, 4, which however, may represent some metallic compound, 
possibly the mixture of gold and silver, now called electrum; and, third, 
crystal, Hebrew qerah and gabish, properly ice, according to the view 
of the ancients, that crystal was ice hardened by intense cold.^

The precious stones exhibited were as follows: 

IIUBV, a variety of coriiuduin (five specimens). — Ruby is given on the 
margin of the Ilevised Version for the Hebrew odein, which is also, 
however, rendered carneliau by some authorities. The Hebrew name 
indicates reddish stone.' 

Topaz. — Topaz is the probable rendering of Hebrew pitdah, men- 
tioned in the book of Job (xxviii, 19) as coming from Ethiopia. 

(tArnet carbuncle (seven specimens). — Carbuncle is given on the 
margin of tlie Revised Version for the Hebrew nofek and in the text 
for the Revised Version for hareqeth.- 

Emerald. — Given in the text of the Revised Version for the Hebrew 
no/ek, and in the margin for Hebrew bareqeth and (Ireek smaragdos. 

Sapphire, a variety of corundum (four specimens). — Hebrew sappir 
and Greek sapfeiros are identical with the English uame, which is the 
same as that in all modern languages. Some, however, assume that 
these names in the Bible signify lapis lazuli. 

Sardonyx, a variety of quartz (two specimens). — Sardonyx is given 
on the margin of the Revised Version for Hebrew yahalom? 

Diamond (one specimen). — The Hebrew yalialom in the High Priest's 
breastplate. Exodus xxviii, 18, is rendered "diamond" in the English 
version and by Luther. But the diamond could not have been used in 
the breastplat-e, because the Hebrews knew of no means of engraving 
a uame upon it. In all probability, however, the diamond is under- 
stood by Hebrew shamir, Jeremiah xvii, 1 : Ezekiel iii, 9 ', Zechariah 
vii, 12, where it is si)oken of as an object used for engraving, and of 
extreme hardness. 

White sapphire adamant, a variety of corundum (two specimens). 

Jacinth (three specimens). — Jacinth is assumed by some to be the 
Hebrew leshem. 

Agate, a variety of quartz (three specimens). — Agate is agreed to 
be the Hebrew sheho. 

Amethyst, a variety of quartz (three specimens). — Amethyst renders 
the Hebrew ahlamah. It is so called in Greek because it was thought 
to be a charm against drunkenness. The Hebrews popularly derived 
it from halam, to dream, and supposed that it brought pleasant dreams. 
Other etymologies have, however, been j)roposed. 

Beryl (two specimens). — Beryl is given for the Hebrew tarshish, 
Revised Version text, and shohatn, Revised Version margin. 

Chalcedony, a variety of quartz (six specimens). — One of the 
stones enumerated in the description of the foundation of the Heavenly 
City (Revelation xxi, 19). Some assume that tarshish in the High 
Priest's breastplate (Exodus xxviii, 20), means chalcedony. (So the 
Revised Version margin.) Topaz is also given for this stone. 

' Where no references are given to these names, it may be assumed that they occur 
in the passages in Exodus, Ezekiel, and Revelations mentioned above. 
* Exodus xxviii, 18. 



982 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

Onyx, a variety of quartz. — Given iu the Revised Version of tlie 
Hebrew sholiam. ISIioJunns set in gold were ])nt on each of the two 
shoulderstraps of tlie e2)}tod of the High Priest, and the two together 
liad engraved the names of the tribes of Israel (Exodus xxviii, 12). 
It is mentioned in Genesis ii, 12, in the account of the Garden of Eden. 

Jasper, a variety of quartz (two specimens). — This is the accepted 
meaning of the Hebrew name yashpeh, the words being probably 
identical in origin. 

Carnelian, a variety of quartz (three specimens). — Possibly 
Hebrew odem of the High Priest's breastplate (Exodus xxviii, 17), and 
tlie sardius in Revelation iv, 3; xxi, 20. 

Chrysolite (two specimens). — Possibly Hebrew tarsMsh. 

Amber (two specimens). — Probably the Hebrew hashmal (Ezekiel i, 
4). Some suppose that amber is understood by Hebrew leshem. 

Chrysoprase, a variety of quartz (four specimens). — Enumerated 
in the description of the foundation of the Heavenly City (Revelation 
xxi, 20). 

Lapis lazuli (Persia). — Some authorities suppose that by sappir 
not sapphire but lapis lazuli is meant. 

Pearl. — It is supposed by some that the pearl is meant by the 
Hebrew penmim, which is often employed in the Old Testament as a 
figure of something valuable, and jirecious.' 

In addition to the gems there was also exhibited a silver breast- 
plate, used as an ornament for the manuscript copy of the Pentateuch 
{Torah) employed in the synagogue, which represented the twelve 
stones which were set in the breastplate of the High Priest^ with the 
names of the twelve tribes of Israel underneath them. 

A SELECTION OF THE COINS OF BIBLE LANDS. 

(Plate 9.) 

Coined money did not circulate among the Israelites previous to 
their return from the Babylonian captivity, and indeed there is no 
evidence that it did then. It is unquestioned, however, that specific 
weights of gold and silver were well recognized iu commercial transac- 
tions from a very early period.' This was principally silver in the 
form of bars — ingots — translated in the authorized and revised versions 

'Proverbs iii, 15; xxxi, 10; Job xxviii, 18. Jesus uses the pearl for the same 
purpose (Matthew vii, 6; xiii, 45): "Give not that which is holy uuto the dogs, 
neither cast your pearls before swine, lest haply they trample them under their feet, 
and turn and rend you." Again, " The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a man that 
is a merchant seeking goodly pearls ; and having found one of great price, ho went 
and sold all that he had and bought it."

''wedge" (ill the original "tongue," Joshua vii, 21),' disks {Mkkar), or 
rings (often represented on Egyptian monuments), which undoubtedly 
had a fixed valuation and weight. Generally the metal was weighed 
on scales to determine its value. Thus the name of the piece of money 
most frequently occurring in the Bible, shekel, properly denotes 
" weight" (from shaqal, "to weigh"), and to this day it is usual in the 
East to examine and test carefully by weight all coins received. 

After the exile we find mentioned adorlon and darkemon,^ appar- 
ently as weights for money, which are usually identified in name with 
the Persian gold daric. Upon the overthrow of the Persian monarchy 
Greek coins of the denominations of talents and drachms probably 
began to circulate in Palestine. 

While som^ attribute the first coinage of the shekel to Ezra, the 
earliest native Jewish coins known are shekels and half shekels of 
silver, and one-sixth skekel of bronze, struck by Simon Maccab;eus^ 
about 146 B. C. The succeeding Maccaba-an or Hasmonsean princes 
down to 37 B. C. struck small bronze coins with Hebrew or Hebrew 
and Greek inscriptions. The ldum«an or Herodian princes coined 
bronze money bearing their names in Greek characters. At the same 
time the Koman procurators of Juda?a (from 6 B. 0.) also struck coins 
with Greek inscriptions. The last coins struck by the Jews were those 
during the revolt under Bar-Oochba (132 A. D.). Greek and Eoman 
money was current in Palestine in addition to the native Hebrew 
coins, as seen from the ISTew Testament.^

The following specimens were shown as representing the ancient 
coinage of places mentioned in the Bible: 

Shekel. — Made of silver and attributed to Simon Maccabaeus 
(141-136 B. C), to whom Antioclius VII Sidetes "gave leave to coin 
money for thy country with thine own stamp." ' Obverse, a cup repre- 
senting the pot of manna,- with the legend: '• Shekel of Israel. Year 
two;" reverse, the budding rod of Aaron,'' with the legend: "Jerusa- 
lem the Holy." (See plate 9, fig. l.j The vahie of the shekel in United 
States currency was about 64 cents. The average shekel weighs 
between 200 and 220 grains, Troy weight. 

Two COINS OF John Hyrcanus (136-106 B.C.). — Original of copper. 
Obverse, "Jochanan, High Priest and Prince of the Jewish Confedera- 
tion; " reverse, two cornucopias and a poppy head. (See plate 0, fig. 3.) 

Widow's mite. — Coin of Alexander Jannaeus (105-78 B. C). — Cop- 
per (facsimile). Obverse, "Jonathan the High Priest and the Confed- 
eration of the Jews," within a wreath of olive; reverse, two cornucopias 
and a poppy head. (See plate 9, fig. 4.) It is assumed that this or a 
similar coin is referred to by the term " widow's mite " in Mark xii, 42. 
It is true that in the original it bears the Greek name lepton X^mov^ 
Latin minutum, but a Jewish coin must be assumed here, none other 
being permitted within the temple precincts. The mite was the small- 
est current Jewish coin in the times of Jesus, and was also the smallest 
temple contribution legally admissible. Its value in the United States 
currency was about one-eighth of a cent. 

Coin of Herod Antipas.— Bronze. Obverse (in Greek characters), 
"Herod Tetrarch," with a palm branch; reverse, "Tiberias," within a 
wreath. (See plate 9, fig. 6.) Herod Antipas, Tetrarch of Galilee and 
Peraea, A. D. 4-39, is often mentioned in the New Testament.* It was 
he who beheaded John the Baptist, and to him was Jesus sent for 
examination, by Pilate.-^ In honor of the Emperor Tiberias he founded 
the city of Tiberias, on the western shore of the Sea of Gennesareth, 
where the coin was struck.

Coin of Herod Philip II (died A. D. 34). — Struck at Cibsarea 
IMiilippi in honor of tlie Eighth Roman Legion. Copper. Obverse, 
" Herod Philip," with his portrait: reverse, the standards of the Legion. 
(See ijlate 9, fio-. 7.) Herod Philip is mentioned ' as Tetrarch of Itnrea; 
Cct^sarea Philippi was often visited by Jesus.^ It is now a small village 
called Banijas, near Mount Hermon. 

Coin of Agrippa II (last Jewish King). — Bronze. Obverse, name 
and head of the Emperor; reverse, "Money of Agrippa, struck at 
Neronias" (C;esarea Philippi). (See plate 9, fig. 2.) Herod Agrippa II 
was the last Jewish King, 48-100 A. U.' 

His long reign was coincident witii that of the Roman emperors 
Claudius, Nero, Galba,Otho, Vitelius, Vespasian, Titus, Domitan.Nerva, 
Trajan, and his coins are therefore found bearing the effigies of several 
emperors. He is mentioned^ as having an interview with the Apostle 
Paul in the presence of the Roman Governor Festus at Ciiesarea. 

Denarius, or Roman Tribute Penny. — Silver (two specimens). 
Obverse, "Tiberius Ctesar," son of deified Agustus (Emperor 14-37 
A. D.); reverse, "Pontifex Maximus" (Chief Priest). It contained 60 
grains Troy of silver, and its value was about 16 cents. (See plate 9, 
fig. 12.) The denarius was the tribute money that the Jews had to pay 
to the Romans, and it is very likely that a variety of this coin was 
shown Jesus with the question " Is it lawful to give tribute unto Csesar 
or not?"- The denarius seems to have been the ordinary day's wages 
of the Palestinian peasantry." It is mentioned eleven times in the 
Gospels" and once in the Revelation (vi, 6). The translation in the 
English versions, penny, is misleading. 

Stater. — Antioch. Silver (facsimile, two specimens). Obverse, 
"(Money) of Cicsar Augustus" (first Roman Emperor, 29 B. C. to 14 
A. D.), with head of the Emperor; reverse, Tyche, as genius of the city 
of Antioch, with her foot on the river god Orontes, and the words, 
"Thirtieth year of the victory" (i. e., Actium). (See plate 9, fig. 5.) 
The stater, about equal in value to the shekel, is mentioned (Revised 
Version, "shekel "; margin, " stater") as the coin which would be found 
by Peter in the mouth of the fish, sufScieut to pay the Temple tribute, 
which was half a shekel, for Jesus and himself.** 

Coin of C.f:sarea. — Bronze. Obverse, head of Agustus Otesar. 
(See plate 9, fig. 8.) C;esarea, founded by Herod I, is frequently men- 
tioned in the Acts. It was the scene of the conversion of the centurion

Coinelius (x); Philip preached the Gosi)el here (xxi, 8); Paul was 
imprisoned here two years before he was sent to Eome (xxiv-xxvi). 
It was the residence of the Roman governors, and here the Jewish war 
against Rome broke out. 

Tetradrachm (;f Sidon. — Silver. Obverse, head of the city; 
reverse, "(Money of the Sidoniaus) Holy and inviolable," with the fig- 
ure of Astarte. (See plate 9, fig. 9.) The value of a tetradrachm was 
about the same as of the shekel, or 04 cents. Sidon, the oldest city of 
Phenicia, is often mentioned in the Bible. It is at present represented 
by the town of Saida, with about 15,000 inhabitants. 

Tetradrachms of Tyre. — Silver. Obverse; Head of Hercules as 
Baal (Lord) of the city. (See plate 9, figs. 13, 14.) Tyre, next to 
Sidon the oldest and most important city of Phenicia, is often referred 
to in the Bible. During the period of David and Solomon friendly 
relations were entertained between Tyre and Israel.^ The coast of Tyre 
was visited by Jesus,^ and Paul landed at Tyre on one of his mis- 
sionary voyages.-' The modern ^ur is an unimportant town, with about 
5,000 inhabitants. 

Coin of Ashkelon. — Bronze. Struck by order of Emperor Alex- 
ander Severus, about A. D. 228. (See plate 9, figs. 11.) 

Ascalon, or Ashkelon, was one of the five cities of the Philistines, 
30 miles southwest of Jerusalem ; * it was the center of the worship of 
Derceto, the supposed female counterpart of Dagou. It is now repre- 
sented by the village of Askalan. 

Coins of the City of Damascus. — Copper (two specimens). (See 
plate 9, fig. 10.) Damascus, the ancient capital of Syria, is mentioned 
as early as in the times of Abraham.^ Later, it frequently came in con- 
tact with Israel.'' In the New Testament it is especially known from 
the history of the Apostle Paul." 

Tetradrachm of the City of Babylon. — Silver. Struck by

(See plate 9, fig. 17.) The city of Seleucia, the ])riiicipal port of Autiocli, 
from which Paul and Barnabas set out for Cyprus,' was named after 
Seleucus I. 

Coin of Demetrius Soter. — Obverse, head of Demetrius; reverse, 
"King Demetrius Soter," with seated female figure. (See plate 9, 
lig. 19.) Demetrius Soter, King of Syria 1C2-150 B. C, waged war 
against the Maccabees and is often mentioned in the books of the 
INIftccabees.^ 

Stater of Tarsus.— Silver. 380-300 B. C. Obverse, Baal 
enthroned within a circle of turrets ; reverse. Satrap Tarcamos seated, 
holding one arrow. (See plate 9, fig. 18.) Tarsus, the ancient capital 
of Cilicia, Asia Minor, was the home of the Apostle Paul.^ It is still a 
city of about 10,000 inhabitants. It is now accessible from Alexan- 
dretta by rail. 

Coin of Cyprus. — Bronze. Struck under Emperor Claudius (A. D. 
41-54) and the Proconsul Sergius Paulus. (See ])late 9, fig. 20.) Cyprus, 
one of the largest islands in the Mediterranean, was the birthi^lace of 
Barnabas,^ and often visited by Paul while Sergius was its proconsul.^ 
In the Old Testament it is referred to by the name of Kittim, which 
name is, however, also used in some passages in a wider sense for the 
Greek coasts and islands of the Mediterranean. 

Tetradrachms of Ephesus. — Silver. Struck 140 B. C. (two speci- 
mens). (See plate 9, fig. 25.) Ephesus, in ancient time one of the most 
important cities in Asia Minor, was especially celebrated for its Temple 
of Diana.'' It was the place of residence of Paul," of Timothy,^ and of 
the Apostle John, who probably died there. Ephesus was one of the 
seven churches referred to in the Apocalypse.^ It was also the seat of 
the third General Council (A, D. 431) and of the " Robber Synod" (A. D. 
449). Numerous ruins are still to be seen there. 

Hemidrachms of Ephesus. — Silver. Struck 200 B. C. Obverse, 
Bee; reverse. Deer (two specimens). (See plate 9, fig. 26.) 

Aes( = As) ofThessalonica). — Copper. Struck 88 B.C. Obverse, 
head of Janus; reverse, Dioscuri. (See plate 9, fig. 21.) The as or 
assarius, in the Greek New Testament affffdpiov (assarion), in the 
English version "farthing," was the original Roman coin, and was at 
one time the unit in Roman numeration both of weight and currency. 
The Greeks adopted the name of the coin and used it upon their 
autonomous coins. The as of the New Testament was of the value of 
one-sixteenth of a denarius and nearly the size of an English half- 
penny. It is mentioned in Matthew x, 29 and 30: "Are not two spar- 
rows sold for a farthing, and one of them shall not fVill on the ground

without your Father; but tlie very hairs of your liead are all luim- 
bered.'" In Matthew v, 26, the last "farthing" is reierred to, aud in 
Mark xii, 42, we read "two mites, which make a farthing." The Greek 
word is 7io6pavTi}5 {Kodrantes, Latin quadrans), which was one-fourth 
of an as. Thessalonica, formerly the capital of Macedonia, where the 
coin was struck, is the modern Salouica. Two Epistles of Paul are 
addressed to the Christians of this place. 

Coin of Thessalonica. — Copper. Struck 158 B. C. Obverse, head 
of City of Nymph; reverse. Galley. (See plate 9, fig. 22.) 

Tetradrachm of Macedonia. — Silver. Struck between 156 and 
] 46 B. C. Obverse, head of Minerva upon a Macedonian shield ; reverse, 
Club of Hercules. (See plate 9, fig. 27.) Macedonia is often mentioned 
in tlie New Testament. Paul visited this province on his second and 
third missionary voyages and founded congregations in several of its 
cities.^ 

DiDRACHMS OF ATHENS. — Silver (two specimens) (470 to 230 B. C). 
Obverse, head of Athene (Minerva) ; reverse, Owl. (See plate 9, fig. 24.) 
Athens, the former capital of Attica and the modern capital of Greece, 
was visited by Paul, where he delivered the discourse on the Areopagus.^ 

Tetrad RACHMS of Athens. — Silver (470 to 230 B. C). Obverse, 
head of Athene (Minerva); reverse, Owl (the bird sacred to Athene) 
(two specimens). (See plate 9, fig. 23.) 

Child's bank. — Pottery. Excavated at Ostia (seaport of ancient 
Rome), 1886, by Dr. Thomas Wilson. (See plate 9, fig. 28.) 

When found the bank consisted of a single piece of pottery. In the 
top was a slit through which the money was dropped. It contained 
145 silver coins of the Roman Consular or Familia series. As these 
coins were issued from 200 to 19 B. C, and none of a later date were 
in the find, it is to be presumed that the bank was buried a short time 
before the Christian era. The silver denarii in the bank are part of the 
original lot found with the bank. 

DRESS, ornaments, AND HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS. 

The fashion of dress and ornament, as well as the form of household 
utensils, are, it may be assumed, in the "unchanging East" essentially 
the same at the present day as in Bible times, and the collection shown 
of objects of modern life and industry in the Orient explain or illustrate 
many allusions in the Scriptures. 

The objects were as follows : 

Sheepskin coat. (See plate 10.) Skins of animals were the 
primitive material used for clothing,* and pelisses of sheepskin still 
form an ordinary article of dress in the East. The mantle of the

Prophet Elijah ^ was probably the skin of a sheep or some animal with 
the hair left on, wherefore he is called the " hairy man."^ Jt was (;har- 
acteristic of the prophet's office.^ " Beware of false i^rophets, which 
come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves." 
"And it shall come to pass in that day that the prophets shall be 
ashamed everyone of his vision when he prophesieth; neither shall 
they wear a hairy mantle to deceive." " The prophet's (Elijah's) dress 
proclaimed the mountaineer of the Arabian border exactly the same as 
is worn today ; the undergarment bound with a broad leather belt, and 
over it a loose, coarse cloak of sheepskin, with the wool outside, its 
dark-browu folds floating in the wind as he hurriedly strode along 
with beard bare and long black locks covering his neck, for he was a 
Nazarite. The Moslem prophet-dervish, as different from the mollah 
or dervish of the towns as Elijah from a Levite of Jerusalem, exactly 
copies this dress and habit."* 

Male costume of Bagdad, Mesopotamia. — The general char- 
acteristics of Oriental dress have been much the same in all ages. The 
representations on monuments correspond in general to the raiment in 
present use. They are the same loose, flowing robes, which can easily 
be adapted to various purposes. The garments mentioned in the Bible 
as generally used are the Ketoneth {Greek, j/t&7k, chiton; English ver- 
sions, "coat"), a kind of shirt worn next to the skin, corresponding to 
the modern qamis. It reached to the knees or ankles and was either 
sleeveless or provided only with short sleeves. A person wearing the 
Ketoneth alone is described as naked.^' Over the shirt there was worn 
during the day the meU (English versions, "cloak"), which had loose 
sleeves and was longer than the shirt, answering to the modern Kaftan. 
It.was thrown oft' when the wearer engaged in manual labor. It was 
fastened by a girdle and the folds thus formed were used as pockets. 
It was and is sometimes woven in one piece.*^ These garments are 
referred to by Jesus in Matthew v, 40 : " And if any man would go to 
law with thee and take away thy coat (Greek jzro?;', chiton), let him 
have thy cloak {i/nariov, himation) also." Over these was worn an 
outer garment, referred to by the terms simlah, heijtd, kemith, and 
lebush. It consisted of a rectangular piece of woolen cloth, something 
like a Scotch plaid, and answered to the modern lungi in Central Asia 
or the aVeih in Egypt, and varied in size and quality with the means 
of the wearer. There is no special allusion to headdress (except as an 
ornamental appendage in the description of the dress of the priests). 
The ordinary headdress of the Bedouin consists of the Kuffiyeh, a square 
handkerchief, generally of red and yellow cotton, or cotton and silk,

folded SO that three of the corners hang down over the neck and 
shoulders, leaving the face exposed, and bound round the head by a 
cord, and it is probable that in ancient time the head was protected in 
a similar manner. For the protection of the feet sandals were worn, 
consisting of leather soles fastened to the foot by means of thongs. 
Shoes seem to have been worn by women for ornamental purposes.' 

Woman's costume of Baodad, Mesopotamia. — The costume of 
women was essentially similar to that of men. There was sufficient dif- 
ference, however, to mark the sex, and it was strictly forbidden to a 
woman to wear "that which i>ertaineth unto a man" and to a man "to 
put on a woman's garment" simlah? The difference, probably, con- 
sisted chiefly in the outer garment. That of woman is called Mitpahath,^ 
ma'atdfah^'^ both designating a kind of wrapper or shawl. There are 
mentioned besides ga'if^^ probably a garment of light, gauzy material, 
radid,^ a similar robe, pethigil,' explained to denote a wrap of some sort 
or a girdle. 

Syrian coat. — Called in Syriac Ahba. It consists of red cloth 
embroidered in white and is worn as an outer garment. 

Silver necklace ( Hebrew, J^wa^). (See plate 11, fig. 1.) Necklaces, 
like many other ornaments, were worn by both sexes.^ They consisted 
of a single band or chain, or of a series of ornaments, as pearls or pieces 
of corals, strung together.^ The custom of wearing a necklace is figura- 
tively referred to in Proverbs i, 9 : " For they shall be a chaplet of grace 
unto thy head and chains about thy neck." Animals ridden by kings 
were decorated with collars of i)recious metals,'" and it is still the custom 
in the East to decorate riding beasts in this way. 

Silver anklets (Hebrew, Akasim). (See plate 11, fig. 4.) Anklets 
worn by women as ornaments are mentioned in Isaiah iii, 16, 18. Frpm 
these passages it would seem that the tinkling produced by knocking 
the anklets against each other was their chief attraction. To increase 
the sound, pebbles were sometimes inclosed in them. They were also 
worn by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Eomans, and are still gen- 
eral in India and in Africa. They were sometimes connected by the 
"anklet chains"" (Hebrew, Ce'adah), which compelled those who wore 
them to take short, mincing steps.

word nezvm denotes both au earring- and a nose ring,' In modern times 
the rings are often of extraordinary size and frequently reacli to the 
moutli, so that they must be removed in eating. Sometimes the nose 
and ears are connected by a series of rings interliulced with one another. 

Kohl and ancient and modern implements used in painting 
THE EYES (Hebrew, Puch; Arainean, Kuhala). (See phite 11, figs. 6, 8.) 
The practice of applying pigments to the eyelids and eyebrows in order 
to enhance the brilliancy of the eyes was common in Bible times,^ and 
is still in everyday practice in the East. The pigment, which is a 
preparation of antimony, is applied to the eyelids by means of a small 
blunt piece of wood or ivory, which is moistened, dipped in the mixture, 
and tlien drawn carefully along the edges of the eye. From the Arabic 
name kohl comes the term " alcohol," the fineness of the powder sug- 
gesting the idea of highly rectified spirits. 

Millstones (Hebrew, Rehaim) (see plate 12, figs. 1, 2), and a modern 
photograph showing women grinding corn. (Seejilate 13.) Millstones 
are often referred to in the Bible, and they are still used in grinding 
corn in the same form as in ancient times. They consist of two cylin- 
drical stones. The lower one is firmly planted on the ground and pro- 
vided with a convex upper surface, on which the concave under surface 
of the other stone revolves. The upper stone, which is called relceh or 
"rider," has a hole through its center, into which the grain is dropi^ed, 
and through which runs a shaft to hold the stone in place. A handle 
attached to the "rider" enables a person sitting near to turn it around 
and grind the grain, which is fed with the hand that is free. 

Layard^ describes the grinding of corn by the modern Arabs as fol- 
lows: "The wandering Arabs have no other means of grinding their 
corn than by hand mills, which they carry with them wherever they go. 
They are always worked by the women, for it is considered unworthy 
of a man to engage in any domestic occupation. * * * The grain 
is passed throug«h the hole of the pivot, and the flour is collected in a 
cloth spread under the mill. It is then mixed with water, kneaded in 
a wooden bowl, and pressed by the hand into round balls ready for 
baking. During these processes the women are usually seated on the 
ground. Hence in Isaiah xlvii, 1, 2, the daughter of Babylon is told 
to sit in the dust and on the ground and " to take the millstones to 
grind meal." It was forbidden to take the mill or even the upper stone 
in pledge, as taking "the life" (that is the means of sustaining life).'' 
As each day so much grain was ground as was needed, the " voice of 
the mill" became proverbial.^

Goatskin waterbag (Hebrew, Nod and Hemetk). (See plate 12, 
tig. 3.) Skin bottles were commonly used.' Jesus employs them in 
a comparison: "Neither do men put new wine into old wine-skins" 
(margin, "skins used as bottles").^ Such bottles are made from the 
whole skins of animals, generally the goat. After the animal is killed 
and its feet and head removed the rest of the body is drawn out entire 
without opening the belly, and after the skin has been tanned the 
places where the legs were cut oft are sewn up and when filled it is tied 
about the neck. These skin bottles were also used to contain milk, 
and in them the milk was churned. To the corners of the skin bottle 
filled with milk cords are tied and the skin is thus suspended from 
three sticks, which are inclined so as to meet at a point above. A girl 
sits beneath and moves the suspended bottle to and fro.'^ Skin bottles 
are also in use in Spain, in the City of Mexico, and by the Eskimos. 

Bird trap (Hebrew, Pah). (See plate 14, fig. 1.) The most usual 
method of catching birds was by the trap, which consisted of two 
parts, a net strained over a frame and a stick or spring (Hebrew 
moqesh) to support it, but so placed that it should give way to the 
slightest touch. The bird trap is frequently used in comparisons for 
the ensnaring of the heedless and the weak.^ " Can a bird fall in a 
snare upon the earth where no gin is set for him? Shall a snare spring 
up from the ground and have taken nothing at all?" "Our soul is 
escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers." " He goeth after 
her straightway * * * as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth 
not that it is for his life." "A gin shall take him by the heel and a 
snare shall lay hold on him," "As the birds that are caught in the 
snare, even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it 
falleth suddenly upon them." 

Sling (Hebrew, Qela). (See plate 14, fig, 2.) The sling as a 
weapon of war is first mentioned in the Book of Judges (xx, 16). 
David killed Goliath with a stone thrown from a siing,^ The Israel- 
itish army was provided with companies of slingers." The sling was 
also employed in the wars of the Roman against the Jews.' According 
to the monuments the sling was both an Egyptian and an Assyrian 
weapon. It consisted of a strip of leather or woven material, wide in 
the middle to receive the missile, and narrowing at both ends into a 
rope. Not only were smooth stones used for hurling, but balls made 
of burnt clay, of lead, and various other hard substances. It is still 
used by shepherds to drive away wild animals from their herds as in 
the time of David.

Wooden door lock and key. (See plate 14, fig. 3.) The doors of 
Eastern houses, which are usually small and low, seem early to have 
been provided with hinges turning in sockets, and with locks and keys,' 
in whose construction no little ingenuity was displayed. Formerly, as 
now, it is likely that locks and keys were made both of iron and of 
wood, according to circumstances. The wooden key now quite gener- 
ally in use consists of a piece of wood about a foot in length provided 
at one end with a series of pegs. It is thrust into a little opening at 
the side of the door and applied to the bolt. This has a corresponding 
series of holes into which the pegs of the key fit, displacing thereby 
another set of pegs by which the bolt is held in its place.^ 

Syrian inkhorn (Hebrew, Qeseth ha sofer). (See plate 11, tig, 9.) 
The most common writing material among the Hebrews was probably 
papyrus or di-essed skins. This at least must have been the case in 
the time of Jeremiah, as the expression "roll of a book"^ points to 
some pliant material. Ink (Hebrew, deyo), which was made of soot, is 
mentioned in Jeremiah xxxvi, 18. The pen used for writing on papyrus 
or parchment was no doubt the reed pen still common in the Orient 
and until recently in southern Europe.* The inkhorn is mentioned in 
Ezekiel ix, 2, as being carried "by the side;" that is, fastened to the 
girdle of the scribe. It is still carried in this fashion in the Orient. 
The inkhorn consists of a tube containing reed pens and a receptacle 
for ink. 

JEWISH RELIGIOUS CEREMONIAL. 

The next collection was one of objects of Jewish religious ceremonial, 
which had their origin in and are based upon Biblical ordinances. 
The following specimens were shown : 

Manuscript copy of the Pentateuch, or Five Books of 
Moses in Hebrew, Sefer Torah. — The Pentateuch or law (Hebrew, 
Torah) is considered by the Jews the most imi)ortant part of the Bible. 
A section of it is read every Sabbath in the synagogue in the morning 
service, and shorter portions in the afternoon service, on holidays, 
fasts, and on Monday and Thursday mornings of every week. This 
latter usage goes back to the days of the early synagogue when Mon- 
day and Thursday were court and market days, and the peasants 
coming to town to dispose of their produce would attend worship. A 
manuscript copy is employed, printed copies not being used, ^^'hen 
not in use the roll is covered with a cloak and placed upright in an ark 
or chest. 

Pointer (Hebrew, Yad, properly "hand"). — The pointer is used in 
the service of the synagogue during the reading of the law to prevent

the reader from losing the place. It is usually made in the shape of a 
hand, hence its Hebrew name. 

Silver breastplate of the Torah.— On the top are the two 
tablets engraved with the Ten Commandments, surmounted by the 
*'crown of the law" upheld by two lions, the symbol of the tribe of 
Judah. Inside the tablets are engraved, on a sliding plate, the names 
of the various festivals. (See plate 15.) The manuscript copy of the 
Pentateuch, or the Sefer Torah, being the most precious object used in 
Jewish ceremonies, is, when not in use, covered with a mantle of costly 
material, sometimes. adorned with a breastplate, bells, or crown, and 
put upright in the "holy ark" {aron ha-hodesh). 

Veil of the Holy Ark (Parocheth). — Made in Constantinople, 
Turkey. (See plate 16.) The border of green velvet is embroidered in 
gold and silver with flowers. The center, of red velvet, has in the four 
corners, in Hebrew, the names of the four archangels, Eaphael, Gabriel, 
Uriel, and Michael. On the top are the words, "But the Lord is in His 
holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before Him,"' and "I have 
set the Lord always before me."^ Below is a burning lamp hanging 
down by chains, symbolizing the light which emanates from the law of 
God. On the sides are the words, "This is the gate of the Lord; the 
righteous shall enter into it." ^ In the Holy Ark [aron ha-Jcodesh) are 
kept the scrolls of the law, or the Pentateuch, written on parchment, 
for use in the service of the synagogue. The " Holy Ark " is, therefore, 
the most important part of the synagogue, and is richly adorned. 
Whenever it is opened the congregation rises in reverence for the Law 
of God it contains. 

Sabbath lamp. — Used by the German Jews in their houses. It 
was manufactured in the eighteenth century in Fellheim, Germany. 
(See plate 17, fig. 1.) The celebration of the Sabbath is ushered in on 
its eve (Friday evening) by the housewife lighting candles, reciting 
the words, "Blessed art Thou, Lord, our God, King of the World, who 
hath commanded us to light the light of the Sabbath." After that no 
fire may be handled until the following evening. 

KiDDUSH CLOTH. — Silk. Containing in beadwork the tablets of the 
decalogue in Hebrew, supported by lions. Above are the words, 
"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy."^ Before the principal 
meals of the Sabbath and other feast days the Jews have a special 
service, including prayers over the wine and bread, which is known as 
Kiddush, or "sanctification." The head of the family has in front of

practice of saying a blessing before eating is referred to in I Samuel

sort was usually preceded by a sacrifice. "Asking the blessing" was

common lu ISTew Testament times. The later Jews enjoined also that 
thanks should be returned after the repast. 

Silver, spice box. — Supposed to have been manufactured in Laup- 
heim (Wilrtemberg), Germany, about 1740. (See plate 18, fig. 4.) This 
box, filled with spices, is used in the Jewish service known as Habdalah 
(or separation), the service of the conclusion of the Sabbath. There is a 
tradition that at the beginning of the Sabbath a special angel accom- 
panies the worshiper from the synagogue; this angel remains with him 
until the couclusion of the Sabbath. The departure of the angel leaves 
the man faint, and the spices are intended to restore him. The objects 
used in this service are a cui) of wine, the spice box, and a candle. 
First a blessing is said over the wine, next over the spices, and last 
over the light. The cup of wine and the spice box are passed around 
among the members of the household. The candle is then extinguished 
by having wine poured upon it. 

Brass plate, used at the Passover meal, — Adorned with animal 
figures and ilowers and containing an Arabic inscription in Hebrew 
characters. Made in Constantinople (see plate 10). At the Passover 
meal {Seder, properly "order") a large plate is put on the table, which 
forms, as it were, the altar of the service. On it are placed the various 
emblematic articles of the ceremony. These are: a piece of roasted 
meat, usually the bone of a lamb, representing the Passover lamb; a 
roasted egg, in memory of the festal sacrifice offered in the Temple; 
bitter herbs {maror, usually horse-radish), in commemoration of the 
"embittering of life'' which Israel suffered in Egyptian servitude;^ 
charoseth, a compound of almonds, apples, and sirup, which has the 
color of brick-clay, and into which the bitter herbs are dipj^ed before it 
is partaken of; some green herbs (lettuce or something similar), as the 
"food of poverty;" and the unleavened bread or ma^-goth, the principal 
food of the Passover feast, which is the "bread of affliction, for thou 
camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste."- 

Omer tablet (manuscript). (See plate -JO.) Used in the Syna- 
gogue for reckoning the period between Passover and Pentecost. The 
tablet is in Hebrew. It contains the words, "Blessed art thou, O Lord 
our God, King of the Universe, who has sanctified us with His Com- 
mandments and commanded us to count the Omer." Then follows the 
count (in Hebrew), and below it the words, "May the Lord restore the 
worship of the temple speedily in our days," and Psalm Ixvii. The 
letters H, S, and D on the left, mean, respectively, Omer (written Homer 
by the Spanish Jews), week (Sabbath), and day. The figures on the 
right indicate that it is the forty-seventh day of Omer, i. e., six weeks 
and five days. The harvest season was formally opened with the cere- 
mony of waving a sheaf of barley in the sanctuary on the second day 
of the Passover feast, which began on the 15th of Nisan (March- April). 

'Exodus i, 14. 2 Deuteronomy xvi, 3. 



996 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

Before this ceremony took place the liarvesting of grain was forbidden :' 
"And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched com, nor fresh ears, until 
this selfsame day, until ye have brought the oblation of your God." 
From that day seven weeks, or forty-nine days, were counted,^ to the 
feast of Pentecost; hence its Hebrew name Hag Im-tihahuoth "feast 
of weeks," and the usual English name "Pentecost," which is the 
TTSvrrjKoffr}] pentelwste, meaning the fiftieth day. It is also called 
"feast of harvest,"^ because the grain harvest then approached its 
close, and "day of first fruits,"^ because two loaves of bread from the 
new wheat were offered on that feast. "^ With the destruction of the 
Temijle the ceremony of waving the sheaf in the Sanctuary necessarily 
fell away, but the counting is still observed and the prayers contained 
in the tablet form part of the ritual during the time from Passover to 
Pentecost. 

LuLAB AND Ethrog. — The Lulab and Ethrog, bound up with myrtle 
and willow branches, are used by the Jews at the feast of Tabernacles, 
in pursuance of the command in Leviticus xxiii, 40: "And ye shall 
take you on the first day, the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm 
trees, and boughs of thick trees and willows of the brook, and ye shall 
rejoice before the Lord your God seven days." Each day of the feast 
a circuit {haqqafah) is made during the service with the Lulab in the 
right hand and Ethrog in the left, while reciting the prayers; begin- 
ning and closing with the invocation "Hosanna." On the seventh day 
seven such processions take place and willow branches are beaten 
on the benches, and this day is therefore called Hosannah liabbah, the 
day of the great Hosanna. 

Manuscript copy of the Book of Esther, written on ])archment, 
with hand-painted views illustrating the events narrated in the book. — 
The Book of Esther is usually called Megilla (roll), or more fully Megil- 
lath Esther (roll of Esther). It is read in the Synagogue on the feast 
of Furim, on the loth of Adar (March-April), established to commem- 
orate the deliverance of the Jews from the machinations of Haman 
related in this book. It is one of the "five rolls" {Jiamesh megilloth) 
which are read on various occasions in the Synagogue, the others being 
the Songs of Solomou or Canticles, Euth, Ecclesiastes, and Lamenta- 
tions. 

Lamp used at the Feast of Dedication (HanuMah). (See plate 
17, fig. 2.) The Feast of Dedication is celebrated in comniemoration 
of the purging of the temple and restoration of the altar after Judas 
Maccabneus had driven out the Syrians in 164 B. C. Its institution is

recorded in I Maccabees iv, 47-59. According to Joseph us,' it was 
called ''lights" {cp(^Ta,pJiota). In the ISTew Testinient^ it is mentioned 
under the name of eyuaivia [enl^alnia). In the Talmud we have the 
legend that when the Jews entered the temple after driving out the 
Syrians, they found only one bottle of oil which liad not been polluted, 
and that this was miraculously increased so as to fee<l the lamps of the 
sanctuary for eight days. The festival is held eight days, beginning 
with the 25th of Kislev (December- January). The principal feature of 
its celebration is the lighting of lights, beginning with one light on the 
first night and increasing the number by one light on each of the suc- 
ceeding nights. The specimen is probably of Dutch make and exliibits 
an interesting survival of the ancient IJonian lamps. 

Knife and cup used at circumcision. (See plate 18, fig. 1.) 
The rite of circumcision {milah) is practiced in pursuance of Genesis 
svii, 10-12: "This is My covenant, which ye shall keep, between Me and 
you and thy seed after thee; every male among you shall be circum- 
cised. And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and 
it shall be a token of a covenant betwixt me and you. And he that is 
eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout 
your generations." In early times circumcision was performed with 
stone knives.^ The later Jews used iron or steel knives. With the 
performance of the rite of circumcision was combined the naming of 
the child. ^ Circumcision was common in Egypt as early as the fourth 
dynasty.- At the present day it prevails among the Kaftirs and some 
negro tribes of Africa, in parts of Australia, in many of the South 
Sea Islands, and it is said to be practiced by the Abyssinian Christians 
as a national custom. Early Spanish travelers found it to be prevalent 
in the West Indies, Mexico, and among tribes in South America. It is 
a common rite among Mohammedans everywhere. 

Garment of fringes {Arha Kanfoth). — This garment is worn by 
men in pursuance of the command'' "Thou shalt make thee fringes 
upon the four borders of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself." 
It is usually made of wool, with fringes attached to the four corners, 
and is worn over the shoulders, underneath the ordinary outer garment. 

PnYLACTEiiiES {teJiUin). (See plate 21.) — Used by Jewish males 
after they attain the age of 13 years and a day, at morning prayers, 
except on Saturday and other feast days. These objects are employed 
in the Jewish ritual in pursuance of the command that the words of 
God should be "a sign upon your hand, and for frontlets between 
your eyes."" They consist of parchment cases containing the i^assages

Deuteronomy vi, 4-9, and xi, 13-21, written on slips of parchment, 
attached to leather straps for binding on the forehead and left arm. 
In the case for the head the passages are written on four separate strips, 
and in the case for the hand on one piece of parchment, and put into a 
square case. They are called tejillin in the Talmud, a word derived from 
tefillah (prayer). The JSTew Testament refers to their ostentatious use.' 

Silk prayer shawl ( Tallith). — The tallith is a kind of prayer shawl 
made of silk, wool, or linen, with ^■iglth or fringes fastened to the four 
corners, worn by men at the morning services. It is usually adorned 
with horizontal stripes of blue or purple; the Jews in the Orient substi- 
tute for these stripes a blue ribband worked in the corners. The wear- 
ing of a garment with fringes is commanded.^ In ancient times this 
garment, it seems, was worn as an outer robe." At ])resent the Jews 
wear, besides the tallith, a kind of vest with fringes under the upper 
garments, which is called the "small tallith" {tallith Icaton), or the "four 
corners" [arha Iranfoth). 

Gold wedding ring. (See i)late 11, fig. 2.) The Jewish marriage 
is made valid by the Kiddushin^ i. e., by the bridegroom putting a ring 
on the hand of the bride while saying the words: "Behold, thou art 
wedded to me by this ring according to the law of Moses and Israel." 

Marriage contract {kethubah), written ou parchment and illumi- 
nated. (See plate 22.) In the Jiethuhah, or marriage contract, are 
recorded the obligations of the husband and the amount of the dowry 
allowed the bride. There is an established form of the Icethnhah usually 
beginning with the words: "Under good auspices, and with good luck 
to bridegroom and bride, 'Whoso findeth a wife flndeth a good thing, 
and obtaineth favor of the Lord.' "^ The husband pledges himself to 
love and honor his wife and to provide for her becomingly. The min- 
imum of the dowry is fixed by the law to be 200 shekles (about $50) 
for a virgin and 100 (about $25) for a widow or divorced woman. To 
this is usually added what the bride has received from her parents and 
what the husband settles ou her voluntarily, all of which she gets in 
case of the death of the husband, or of divorce. The contract is dated 
Eome, in the year of creation 5576 (1810). The contracting parties are 
Elijah Saki and Masal-Tob (Fortune), of Oastlenuovo. The witnesses 
to the contract are Josua Gerson Ashkenazi and Michael Ohayim 
Megula. 

The margin is decorated with various symbolical figures, and contains 
the liturgy of the wedding ceremony and i)assages from the Bible and 
the Talmud referring to marriage and married life, artistically inter- 
twined in garlands. Above, in the center, are probably the arms of the 
bridegroom ; to the right a boy standing on a wheel pouring out the 
horn of plenty, with the motto, "All depends on merit and good luck;"

and welcome to those nigh and far." Below, to the right, is a female 
figiiie holding two burning hearts linked together by a chain, with the 
adage, "A well-mated couple is chosen by God" (marriages are made 
in heaven); to the left another female figure holding a tambourine and 
a flower, with a quotation from Isaiah xxxii, 8. The representation at 
the bottom, of Elijah ascending to heaven in a fiery chariot, his mantle 
falling on his disciple and successor Elisha,' was probably suggested by 
the name of the bridegroom. 

MiZRACH {the east). — Mizrach means east, literally the place of the 
rising sun. There is hung in Jewish houses a tablet on the eastern 
wall to indicate the direction of the face when at prayer. It contains 
the Ten Commandments and various quotations from Scripture in 
Hebrew. The idea which dictates this direction is that the face shall 
be turned toward Jerusalem. West of Jerusalem the opposite direc- 
tion would be chosen. In the temple itself the direction of prayer was 
toward the west, the entrance being from the east. Ancient nations 
that worshiped the sun tnrned wlien in i)rayer toward the east, the 
place of the rising sun. This fact is alluded to in Ezekiel viii, 16: "At 
the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, 
were about five and twenty men with their backs toward the temple of 
the Lord and their faces toward the east; and they worshiped the 
sun toward the east." 

Knife with its sheath, used for the slaughtering of animals. (See 
plate 17, fig. 3.) The killing of animals for food is performed by a 
person especially trained and authorized, called shochet. The throat is 
cut with a long knife (halaf) and the internal organs are examined for 
traces of disease. The act of killing is called shechita; that of search- 
ing, bedika. During both acts short prayers are recited. If there be 
a notch {pegima) in the knife, or if any trace of disease be found, the 
animal is unfit {terefa) to be eaten. 

ANTIQUITIES. 

Next to the Israelites, with whom the Scriptures originated, the 
antiquities of those nations with whom Israel came in close contact, 
and who to a great extent inflnenced the course and development of the 
history narrated in the Bible, claim the interest of the Bible student. 
Tbe exhibits in this department consisted of objects representing 
Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia, and the Hittites. 

EGYPT. 

Cast of a bust of Ramses II. — Ramses II ^ was the third king 
of the nineteenth dynasty and the most brilliant monarch of Egypt. 
He was formerly identified as the Pharaoh of the Exodus; later author- 
ities hold that that event took i)lace five years after his death. He 
was, however, in all probability, the Pharaoh of the oppression. The

1000 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

reasons for this siippositiou are that the land of Goshen in which 
the Israelites settled when they migrated to Egypt' is also called the 
land of Ramses, and that one of the cities which the Israelites built 
while in bondage was named Ramses.^ As Kamses I reigned only for 
a short time, it is assumed that these names are connected with Ram- 
ses II, whose reign extended over sixty-six years in the thirteenth 
century B. C. (1348-1281 B. C); and who was not only the most war- 
like but also the greatest builder among the Egyptian kings. The 
cities Pithom and Ramses which the Hebrews built for Pharaoh are 
thought to have been situated in the modern Wadi Tumilat. Pithom 
was identified in 1883 with Tell el-Maskutah in the east of this Wadi 
at the railroad station Ramses. Besides the building of these two 
cities and numerous temples, Ramses II seems also to have undertaken 
the continuation of the canal of the Wadi Tumilat to the Bitter Lakes, 
and the cutting through of the rising ground between them and the 
Red Sea, which connection between the Nile and the Red Sea was 
the true iirecursor of the Suez Canal. ^ The bust, which is taken from 
a sitting statue, represents him beardless with a helmet on hi.s head. 
The original, of black granite, is in the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities 
in Turin, Italy. 

Cast of a relief of Ramses II. — Photographs of the mummy of 
Ramses II. The mummy was discovered iu July, 1881. The plioto- 
graphs were taken immediately after the unwinding of the mummy in 
June, 1880.^

3 Compare Adolf Erman, Life in Ancient Egypt, p. 27. 

■• Century Magazine, May, 1887. This mummy is in many ways the finest ever 
discovered and is of surpassing interest. Professor Maspero describes it as follows: 
''The head is long, and small in proportion to the body. The top of the skull is quite 
hare. On the temples there are a few sparse hairs, but at the poll the hair is quite 
thick, forming smooth straight locks about 5 centimeters in length. White at the 
time of death, they have been dyed a light yellow by the spices used in embalmment. 
The forehead is low and narrow; the brow ridge prominent; the eyebrows are thick 
and white; the eyes are small and close together; the nose is long, thin, arched like 
the noses of the Bourbons, and slightly crushed at the tip by the pressure of bandages. 
The temples are sunken; the cheek bones very prominent; the ears round, standing 
far out from the head, and pierced like those of a woman for the wearing of earrings. 
The jawbone is massive and strong; the chin very prominent; the mouth small, but 
thick-lipped and fall of some kind of black paste. This iiaste being partly cut 
away with the scissors disclosed some much worn and brittle teeth, which, moreover, 
are white and well preserved. The mustache and beard are thin. They seemed to 
have been kept shaven during life, but were probably allowed to grow during the 
king's illness, or they may have grown after death. The hairs are white like those 
of the head and eyebrows, but are harsh and bristly and from 2 to 3 millimeters in 
length. The skin is of earthy brown, spotted with black. Finally, it may be said 
the face of the mummy gives a fair idea of the face of the living king. The expression 
is intellectual, perhaps slightly animal, but even tinder the somewhat grotesque dis- 
guise of mumification, there is plainly to be seen an air of sovereign majesty, of 
resolve and of pride." 



EXHIBIT OF BIBLICAL ANTIQUITIES. 1001 

The typical physiognomy of the native Egyptian, as exhibited on the 
numerous monuments, shows a head often too large in proportion to 
the body, a square and somewhat low forehead, a short and round nose, 
eyes large and wide open, the cheeks filled out, the lips thick, but not 
reversed, and the mouth somewhat wide. Contrasting the features 
of Eamses II with these, some scholars have assumed that he was of 
Semitic descent or at least had Semitic blood in liis veins. 

Cast of the head of Seti I. — The original is at the Museum of 
Egyptian Antiquities at Cairo, Egypt. Seti I was the second king 
of the nineteenth dynasty and father of Ramses II, the Pharaoh 
of the oppression. He reigned for about twenty-seven years in the 
thirteenth century B. C. 

Cast of a relief of Seti I. — Photograph of the mummy of Seti I. 
Taken under the direction of Prof. G. Maspero at the Museum of 
Egyptian Antiquities, Cairo, Egypt. 

Cast of the head of Tirhakaii. — Original of granite in the 
Museum of Antiquities at Cairo. King of Egypt and Ethiopia, 698-672 
B. C. According to the Biblical account,' Tirhakah, " King of Ethi- 
opia" (in Egyptian Taharqa), encountered Senacherib, King of Assyria, 
while the latter was on his expedition against Judah. From the Cunei- 
form inscriptions we learn that Tirhakah entered into an alliance with 
Baal, King of Tyre, against Assj'ria. Hezekiah, King of Judah, also 
joined the league. Esarhaddon marched into Egyi)t, and putting Tir- 
hakah to flight he placed the rule of the whole country under twenty 
vassals loyal to Assyria. On the death of Esarhaddon, Tirhakah 
returned to Egypt, drove out the Assyrians that were there, and took 
possession of Memphis. Assurbanipal, the son and successor of Esar- 
haddon (668-626 B. C), at once went to Egypt and defeated him at 
Karbanit. Tirhakah was again obliged to flee to Thebes and thence to 
Nubia. The twenty vassal kings were restored and Necho {Niku), 
" King of Sais and Memphis " put at their head. Soon after this Necho 
headed a rebellion against the Assyrian rule, but the plot was sup- 
pressed by the Assyrian garrison of Egypt aiid Necho sent in chains 
to Nineveh. But when Assurbanipal heard of the new successes of 
Tirhakah in Egypt, lie sent Necho back to rule over all Egyi^t under 
the direction of Assyria. Tirhakah soon afterwards died. Manetho, 
who calls him Tarlvs ( Tara]:os), says he was the last king of the 
twenty-fifth dynasty. Strabo (xvi, I, 6) calls him Tearl-on, and describes 
him as one of the greatest conquerors of the ancient world. 

Mummy. — Length, 5 feet 6 inches. Found at Luxor, Egypt, in 1886. 
(See plates 23 and 21.) No hieroglyphics or inscriptions exist either on 
the mummy or outer case. The face and head are covered with a mask 
of green cement, the body delicately proportioned. On the chest lie 
four small tablets about the size of playing cards, each one having a 
mummied figure of Osiris in a standing position. Two shield-shaped

1002 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

ornaments lie across the breast and stomach, respectively. The upper 
one bears the sacred beetle with spread wings, beneath which is a 
nilometer standing between two figures, which support each a globe 
upon the head. The faces of these figures are covered with square 
pieces of gold leaf. At the end of the wings is represented the hawk- 
head of Iva, also supporting a globe. Over the surface of the shield 
are painted representations of jewelry. On the lower shield appears a 
kneeling figure of Nephthys, with extended arms and wings. Upon her 
head she wears a headband supporting a globe. On either side of the 
head are two groups, each containing three small figures. Ostrich 
plumes appear in the corner of the shield. Along the legs is a sheet 
of cemented linen, on the top of which is a mummy on a dog-shaped 
bier; at the head of the bier is a figure kneeling, holding an ostrich 
plume; below this is a group of seven kneeling figures holding plumes. 
Further down is a second nilometer, on either side of which a figure 
with an implement in each hand faces two mummied figures, both of 
which have the faces concealed with a square patch of gold leaf. The 
feet are incased in a covering of cemented linen. 

The Egyptians conceived man as consisting of at least three parts — 
the body, the soul, and the Ka, i. e., the double or genius. The Ka 
was supposed to remain in existence after death, and to be the repre- 
sentative of the human personality. In order that the Ka might take 
possession of the body when it pleased, the body had to be preserved 
from decay. The preservation of the body was accordingly the cLiet 
end of every Egyptian who wished for everlasting life. To this end 
the Egyptians mummified their bodies, built indestructible tombs, 
inscribed the tombs and coffins with magical formulae to repel the 
attacks of the demons, and placed statutes, household goods, food, 
statuettes of servants, etc., that the tomb might resemble as much as 
possible the old home of the deceased.^ The process of mummifying 
the bodies by various methods of embalming was of high antiquity in 
Egypt, probably going back to the earliest dynasties; the oldest 
mummy which was found at Saqqarah in 1881, and is now at the 
museum of Gizeh, dates from 3200 B. C. This practice is said to have 
continued to 500 A. D. The art reached the highest point at Thebes 
during the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties, when spices and 
aromatic substances were used, and the skin of the bodies so prepared 
as to retain a slight color and a certain flexibility. What is known of 
the process is derived chiefly from the Greek writers Herodotus^ and 
Diodorus Siculus,^ and from examinations of the mummies themselves. 
According to these sources the Egyptians employed three methods of 
embalming, of more or less elaborateness, according to the wealth and 
position of the deceased. The most costly mode is estimated by Diodo- 
rus at a talent of silver — about $1,250. The embalmers first removed 
part of the brain through the nostrils by means of an iron hook,

cassia, and other aromatics, frankincense exi-epted, and sewn up 
again. The body was then steeped in natron (subcarbonate of sMa) 
for seventy days, afterwards waslied and swathed in strips of linen and 
smeared with gum. The sectoiid mode of embalming cost about 20 
minae — alxmt >^'M)0. In this case cedar oil was injected into the abdo- 
men. The oil was i)revented from escaping, and the Ijody steeped in 
natron for the i)res(;ribed time. On the last day the cedar oil was let 
out from the abdomen, (tarrying witli it the intestines in a state of dis- 
solution, while the flesh was consumed by the natron, so that nothing 
was left but the skin and bones. The third method, which was used 
for the poorer classes, consisted in rinsing the abdomen with syrmaea, 
an infusion of senna and cassia, and steei)ing the body for the usual 
period in natron. Examinations of Egyptian mummies have ])roven 
the accounts of Herodotus and Diodorus to be in the main correct. 
For mummies, both with and without ventr;il inc^isions, are found, and 
some are preserved by means of balsams and gums, and others by 
bitumen and natrum, and the hundreds of skulls of mummies which 
are found at Thebes contain absolut(^ly nothing, while other skulls aie 
found to be filled with bitumen, linen rags, and resin, 'IMie terui 
" mummy" is derived from the Arabic mwniya, "bitumen" and the 
Arabi(; word for nuimmy is mnmlyya "bitumenized thing." The native 
Egyptian word for nuimmy is sahu.' In the liible, instances of embalm- 
ing are only met with in connection with the Egyptians, the bodies of 
Jacob and Joseph, who died in Egypt, being thus treated.^

who would answer for the departed and perform the work for him.'' 

1^'llAGMENTS OP MUMMIED DOGr, CAT, CROCODILE, AND OTHER 

ANIMALS. (See plate 25.) The Egy|)tians believed that their several 
divinities assumed the forms of various animals; so, for instance, 
Ptah appears as the Apis-bull, Anion as a ram, Sebek is rej)reseuted as 
a crocodile-headed man, Bastis as a cat-headed woman, etc. These 
animals are therefore venerated as the manifestations or symbols of the 
respective divinities, and the willful killing of one of them was a capital 
offense. These sacred animals were embalmed and buried in graves.

a special cemetery for cats, wliicli was recently identified at the modern 
Zagaziy. Diodorus Siculus says' that wlien a cat died all the inmates 
of the house shaved their eyebrows as a sign of mourning.^ 

Book o'f the dead. — A series of original fragments and a facsimile 
of g-n Egyptian papyrus at the British Museum in London. The 
so-called Egyptian "Books of the Dead" are collections of religious 
texts, hymns, invocations, prayers to the gods, etc, intended for the use 
and protection of the dead in the world beyond the grave. The original 
of the one referred to was found in the tomb of Ani, "Royal Scribe" 
and Scribe of the Sacred Eevenue of all the gods of Thebes, "who is 
accompanied on his way through the divers parts of the realm of the 
dead by his wife. Tutu. The hieroglyphic text is accompanied by 
colored vignettes, which depict the various scenes through which the 
deceased has to pass in the nether world, as his appearance before 
Osiris, the Supreme Judge of the dead, the weighing of the heart of the 
departed against the goddess of Truth, etc. The prayers and magical 
formuhe were written out on a roll of papyrus and bound up inside the 
bandages of the mummy. 

Two SOARABAEi. — The Scarahceufi AegypUorum, or Ateuchus Sacet\ 
that is, the great cockchafer found in tropical countries, was regarded 
in Egypt as the symbol of the god Kheper, who was termed by the 
Egyptians "the father of the gods," and who was later identified with 
the rising sun. As the sun by his daily revolution and reappearance 
typified the return of the soul to the body, the scarabfcus, which is in 
Egyptian likewise called Kheper, was the emblem of the revivication of 
the body and the immortality of the soul. Models of Scarab;ei, made 
of various kinds of materials, usually inscribed with names of gods, 
kings, and other persons, and with magical legends and devices, were 
buried with the nuimmies (placed on the heart or the finger of the dead) 
and were also woru by the living, principally as charms. The insects 
themselves have also beeu found in coffins. 

Egyptian brick. — Sun-baked brick from an early tomb, Thebes, 
Egypt. The usual dimensions of an Egyptian brick was from 20 or 17 
to 14J inches in length, 8f to 6i inches in width, and 7 to 4^ inches 
thick. It consists of ordinary soil mixed with chopped straw and sun- 
baked. This method of making bricks is alluded to in Exodus v, 18, 
where the oppressed Israelites are told " there shall no straw be given 
you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks." In the ruins of Pithom, one 
of the cities in which the Israelites were employed, three kinds of brick 
were discovered, some with stubble, some with straw, and some with- 
out. Among the paintings of Thebes, one on a tomb represents brick- 
making captives with " taskmasters," who, armed with sticks, are 
receiving the " tale of bricks" and urging on the work. Judging from 
the monuments, the process of making sun-dried bricks was much the 
same as in modern times. The clay or mud was mixed with the neces-

Egyptian C(jtton. — Cotton of a very fine grade is now grown in 
Egypt. The question as to whether it was known or extensively used 
in that country, or in other lands bordering on the Mediterranean, is 
one that has given rise to much discussion. Authorities on the cotton 
plant have dednitely asserted that it was well known in Egypt from 
early times; thus M. Jardin^ states that it is certain that the cotton 
j)lant existed in Upper Egypt, Nubia, and Abyssinia in the wild state; 
that it was known to the ancient Egyptians, and that the proof of its 
existence is the finding of some seeds of Gossypium Arhorctim, by 
Rosellini, in the coftin of a mummy. He further holds the opinion that 
linen and cotton were simultaneously employed in Egypt, but that the 
former was more costly than the latter and was reserved for purposes 
relating to the cult. In the valuable work on the Cotton Plant issued 
by the United States Department of Agriculture, ' Mr. R. B. Handy, 
the author of a chapter on the Ancient History of Cotton, holds })rac- 
tically the same view.^ On the other hand, it has been claimed by 
some authors that cotton was quite unknown in Egypt, a fact largely 
based upon the conclusions arrived at by James Thomson in an article 
on the ''Mummy Cloths of Egypt." ^ Mr. Tiiomson, after twelve years' 
study of the subject, reached the opinion that the bandages of the 
mummy were universally made of linen. It would api)ear that cotton 
was not well known to the ancient Israelites, for we find it mentioned 
but once in the Bible, in the Book of Esther,'^ which, of course, has a 
Persian background and contains a descri]3tiou of a Persian palace. 
The passage reads: " In the court of the garden of the King's Palace 
there were hangings of white and violet-colored cotton cloths fastened 
with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of mar- 
ble." The Hebrew word translated "cotton" is " karpas," derived 
from the Sanskrit "■ karpasa." 

Between the extremes of opinion, the truth seems to be that cotton 
was indigenous in India and that its products made their way gradually, 
through commerce, to the Mediterranean countries and that the plant 
itself followed gradually either through commerce or by way of Persia. 
It is plain that the cotton plant existed in Egypt in the time of Pliny

(the first century of the Christian era), and it also seems likely that 
inasmuch as there is no representation whatsoever on any Egyptian 
monuments thus far found, or on any monuments found in Western 
Asia, of a cotton phxnt, that it was not known in that country in early 
days. It is difficult to conclude that so striking an object would not 
have been depicted on the monuments, when the ancient artists found 
it possible to figure so many of the various plants known to them. 

ASSYRIA AND BABYLONIA. 

Illustrating these countries the following specimens were shown: 
Cast of the so-called Oval op S argon. — Tbe original is a 
small egg-shaped piece of veined marble, pierced lengthwise. It was 
discovered by Mr. Hormuzd Rassam at Abu-Habba, Babylonian Sippar 
(in the Bible Sepharvaim)^ a city from which the King of Assyria 
transported colonists to Samaria. The inscription reads : "'I, Sargon, 
the king of tlie city, King of Agade, have dedicated this to the Sun-god 
(Samas) of Sippar." This king is supposed to have reigned about 
3,800 B. C, and the object is no doubt a contemporary document. 
Tbe date is derived from a statement on the cylinder of Nabonidus 
found at the same place. Nabouidus, the last King of Babylon 
(555-538 B. C), the father of Belshazzar, records that when rebuilding 
the Temple of the Sun-god he found the original foundation stone of 
Naram-Sin, Sargon's son, which none of his predecessors had seen for 
3200 years. Agade, mentioned on the Oval of Sargon, is Akkad, enu- 
merated in the genealogical tablet^ as one of the four cities of Nimrod's 
empire. Akkad was also the name of the entire district of North 
Babylonia.^ 

Model of a temple tower of Babylon. — The model is plaster, 
painted, and was made after the descriptions of the Temple Tower of 
Borsippa, on the scale of one-fourth inch to the foot. (See plate 26.) 
From the most ancient times tLe principal cities of ^Mesopotamia had 
towers. These were used as observatories, also for tbe performance of 
religious ceremonies, and perhaps in early times for military defense. 
In Genesis si, 1-9, it is related that certain immigrants began to build 
in tlie plain of Shinear a city and a tower, which was left incomplete 
in consequence of the confusion of tongues, and the city was thence 
called Babel (confusion). This "Tower of Babel" has been connected 
both by Arab tradition and on the authority of archaeologists with the 
imposing ruins of Birs-Nimrud ("Nimrod's Tower") on the site of the 
Temple Tower of Kebo, at Borsippa, which was a surburb of the city 
of Babylon, and which in the cuneiform inscriptions is called "Babylon 
the Second." This Temple Tower of Borsippa, termed in the inscrip- 
tions Ezida ("the eternal house"), was a perfect type of these edifices, 
and it has been suggested as probable that the Tower of Babel men-

tioued in Genesis was conceived on the same plan. The Temple of 
Borsippa was reconstructed with great splendor by Nebuchadnezzar 
(G04-5G1 B. C), but he made no changes in the general character and 
plan. According to the description of Herodotus/ who mistakes it for 
the Temple of Bel, and the report of Sir Henry Rawlinson, who care- 
fully examined the mound of Birs-Nimrud, tlie Tower of Borsippa 
appears to have been constructed on the plan of a step-shaped or ter- 
raced pyramid. Such stepped j)yramids have not only survived in 
Egypt, in the Great Pyramid of Sakkarah, but are also found in Mexico 
(at Cholula, City of Mexico, etc.), where they are called TeocalUs — i. e., 
"houses of god" — consisting of terraced structures, live to seven stories 
high, and surmounted by a chamber or cell, which is the temple itself. 
It is assumed that these temple towers were the prototype of the later 
Egyptian pyramids, the stories disappearing in the latter by tilling- up 
the platforms of the difterent stages, which produced an uninterrupted 
slope on all sides. The Temple Tower of iSTebo, at Borsippa, was built 
in seven stages, whence it is sometimes called in the inscriptions 
"Temple of the seven spheres of heaven and earth." Upon an artifi- 
cial terrace of burnt bricks rose the first stage, 272 feet square; on 
this the second, 230 feet square; then the third, 188 feet square, each 
of these three lower stages being 20 feet high. The height of each of 
the four upper stories was 15 feet, while their width was 140, 101, 02, 
and 20 feet, respectively, so that the whole edifice, not including the 
artificial terrace, had a height of about 140 feet. The several stages 
were faced with enameled bricks in the colors attributed to the differ- 
ent planets, the first story, representing Saturn, in black; then, in 
order, Jupiter, orange; Mars, red; the Sun, thought to have been 
originally plated with gold; Venus, white; Mercury, blue, and the 
seventh, dedicated to the Moon, the head of the Babylonian pantheon, 
was plated with silver. The floors of the platforms were probably 
inlaid with mosaics. The whole structure terminated in a chapel placed 
on the central axis of the tower and surmounted by a cupola. Accord- 
ing to Herodotus there stood in the spacious sanctuary on the top of 
the tower a couch of unusual size, richly adorned, with a golden table 
by its side. But no statue of any kind vzas set up in the chamber, nor 
was it occupied at night by anyone but a native woman. The top 
stage was also used as an observatory. Double converging stairs or 
gently ascending ramps led up to the several platforms. 

The Chaldean Deluge Tablet. — Containing the cuneiform text 
of the Babylonian account of the Deluge as restored by Prof. Paul 
Haupt. Engraved in clay under the direction of Professor Haupt, by 
Dr. R. Zehnpfund, of Eosslau, Germany. Measurement, 8| by 6| inches. 
The Babylonian story of the Deluge is contained in the eleventh tablet 
of the so-called Izdubar or Gilgamesh^ legends, commonl}^ known 
under the name of the Babylonian Mmrod Epic. The Babylonian 

' Book i, 181-183. * This name is also read by some Gizdubar and Gibel-gamesh. 



1008 REPORT OF NATIONAL ItlUSEUM, 1896. 

narrative of the Deluge closely accords both in matter and language 
with the biblical account as contained in Genesis vi-viii. Xisnthrus 
or Hasisadra, the hero of the Babylonian account, corresponding to 
the Biblical Noah, is informed by a god of the coming flood and ordered 
to build a ship to preserve himself, his family, and friends, and various 
animals. After he had sent out divers birds (a dove, swallow, and 
raven) he landed on the mountain Nizir, in Armenia, and offers a sacri- 
fice to the gods, after which he is transferred to live with the gods. 
The originals were found during the British excavations in the Valley 
of the Euphrates and Tigris, and are now preserved in the British 
Museum, in London. There was also exhibited a cast of some of the 
original fragments now preserved in the British Museum. 

Cast of a colossal human-headed winged lion, 11 by 9 feet; 
original of yellow limestone in the British Museum. It was found by 
Sir Austen H. Layard in 1816 at Kuyunjik on the site of ancient Mne- 
veh, and is supposed to belong to the period of Asurnazirpal, who 
reigned 884-860 B. 0. Figures of composite animals of stone or metal, 
sometimes of colossal size, were placed by the Assyrians at the entrances 
to the temples of the gods and the palaces of the kings. They were 
considered as emblems of divine power, or genii (Assyrian, shedu), and 
believed to "exclude all evil." Lions were also placed "beside the 
stays" and on either side of the steps of the gilded ivory throne of 
Solomon. 1 Some Assyriologists connect the Assyrian winged and com- 
posite beings with those seen by the prophet Ezekiel in his vision of 
the "chariot," as described in the first chapter of his prophecies, and 
the cherubim guarding the entrance to the Garden of Eden- and those 
carved on the Ark of the Covenant.-' Parallels are also found in the 
religious figures of other peoples, as the sphinx of the Egyptians and 
Persians, the chimera of the Greeks, and the griffin of northeastern 
mythology. It would seem that the composite creature form was 
intended to symbolize either the attributes of divine essence or the vast 
powers of nature as transcending that of individual creatures. 

The winged lion, called "Nergal," was also sacred to Anatis and to 
Beltis, the goddess of war. 

Cast of the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser II, King of 
Assyria 860-824 B. C. The original of black basalt, which is now pre- 
served in the British Museum, was accidentally discovered by Sir 
Austen Henry Layard at Nimrud, on the site of the Biblical Calah,-^ 
about 19 miles below Nineveh. The obelisk is about 7 feet high. The 
terraced top and the base are covered with cuneiform script containing 
a record of Shalmaneser's campaigns nearly to the last year of his long

reign. The upper part is occupied by five compartiueuts of bas-reliefs 
running in horizontal bauds around the four sides, and representing 
processions of tribute bearers from five nations. Il^arrow bands between 
the compartments contain short legends descriptive of the scenes repre- 
sented. The Black Obelisk and the other monuments of Shalmaneser II 
supplement the Biblical narrative We learn from them that he was 
the first Assyrian king, so far as is yet known, to come into relations 
with Israel. Among the tribute bearers represented on the obelisk are 
Israelites, and in the second row is a legend reading, '^Tribute of Ya'ua, 
son of Humri : silver, gold, vials of gold, cups of gold, pans of gold, 
vessels of gold, of lead, scepters for the King's hand, axes I received.''^ 
In the record of the sixth year of his reign (854 B. C) Shalmaneser 
relates his victorious campaign against Benhadad, King of Damascus 
(in the inscription Dadidri), Ishiluna of Haraat, and their confederate 
kings. From another inscription engraved by Sbalmaneser in the rocks 
of Armenia it is learned that one of the allies of this great coalition 
led by Benhadad against Assyria was Ahab, King of Israel (in the 
Assyrian inscription Ahabbu Sirlai), who had furnished 2,000 chariots 
and 10,000 soldiers. iSTeither of these facts — the i)articipation of Ahab 
in the Syrian league and the payment of tribute to Shalmaneser by 
Jehu — is recorded in the Bible. This King is not to be confounded 
with Sbalmaneser IV (727-722 B. C), who is mentioned in II Kings 
xviii, 9, in connection with the conquest of Samaria.'^ 

Cast of a bell, the original of which is in the Eoyal Museum of 
Berlin. The bell is decorated in bas-relief with the fignre of Ea, the 
Assyro-Babylonian divinity of the ocean, also called the " Lord of Pro- 
found Wisdom," and hence considered as the god of science and culture. 
He is represented in human form covered over by a fish. lie is prob- 
ably identical with the Cannes, described by the Chaldean priest Bero- 
sus as the founder of civilization. Through a mistaken etymology of 
Dagon from Hebrew dag, fish, the Philistine divinity of that name, men- 
tioned in I Samuel v, was thought to have been a fish god and identified 
with the water god Ea. Dagon was also a divinity of the Assyro- 
Brtbylonians, known by the nameof Dagan, but had no connection with 
the water. He was considered by the Phenicians and, therefore, pre- 
sumably, by the Philistines also, as the god of agriculture.^ Besides 
the representation of Ea, there are also on the bell figures of several 
demons and a priest.

THE HITTITES. 

The Hittites (Hebrew Hittim) are derived in the Bible from Heth, son 
of Canaan, the son of Ham.' They are depicted as an important tribe 
settled in the region of Hebron on the hill,- and are often mentioned as 
one of the seven principal Canaanitish tribes, and sometimes as com- 
prising the whole Canaanitish population.^ 

From Abraham to Solomon the Hittites came more or less in contact 
with Israel. I^umbers of them remained with the Jews even as late as 
the time of Ezra and Kehemiah.^ Hittite kings are mentioned as set- 
tled north of Palestine,^ and some scholars distinguish the latter as 
Syrian Hittites from the Canaanite tribe. Eecently the Hittites have 
been identified with the Gheta of the Egyptian and Chatti of the 
Assyrian monuments. 

From the notices on these monuments it is gathered that this people 
at an early period constituted a mighty power, dominating, for a time, 
the territory from the Euphrates to the ^Egean, and standing forth as 
rivals of Egypt and Assyria. As early as the seventeenth century 
B. C, a struggle began for supremacy between Egypt and the Hittites, 
which lasted for five hundred years, when Ramses II defeated the 
Hittites at Kadesh, on the Orontes. He did not conquer them, how- 
ever, but was compelled to make an alliance. From the twelfth to tlie 
eighth century B. C, the Hittites were in conflict with Assyria, until 
the Assyrian King, Sargon, put an end to the Hittite dominion in 717 
B. C, when the inhabitants of Carchemish, the Hittite capital in Syria 
(the modern Jerablus on the Euphrates), were deported to Assyria, and 
the city was repeopled with Assyrian colonists. 

Of late there have been added to the Biblical, Egyptian, and Assj'^- 
rian sources numerous monuments which were discovered throughout 
Asia Minor and Northern Syria, aud which are by some scholars 
attributed to the Hittites. The beginning was made by two Americans, 
Mr. J. Augustus Johnson, of the United States consular service, aud 
Eev. S. Jessup, who in 1870 found Hittite inscriptions at Hama, in 
Syria. Later discoveries were made, especially by Humann and Pucli- 
stein, under the auspices of the German Government (1872), and by 
Eamsay and Hogarth (1890). The monuments, mostly of black basalt, 
contain representations in bas-relief of religious objects, winged figures, 
deities standing on various animals, sphinxes, gryphons, the winged 
disk, as symbol of the deitj^, the two headed eagle (which became the 
standard of the Seljukiau Turks, and afterwards of Austria and Kussia, 
etc.), and inscriptions in hieroglyphic characters, written in alternat- 
ing lines from right to left and left to right {houstrophedon). The art 
exhibited on these monuments is of a primitive, rude character, and 
recalls the early art of Babylonia, Greece, and Phenicia.* The inscrip-

tioiis have not yet been decipliered, and the race affinity of the 
Hittites and the i)lace of their language among linguistic families are 
still disputed questions. Thus, J. Halevy' considers the originators of 
these monuments as Semites; P. Jensen'^ would designate them as 
Aryans (Cilicians), while the Italian, Cesare de Cara^ identifies them 
with the Pelasgiaus, the ancient prehistoric inhabitants of the Grecian 
countries. 

The pictorial representations of the Hittites, on the Egyptian as well 
as on their own monuments, show that they were a short, stout race, 
with yellow skin, receding foreheads, oblique eyes, black hair, and 
chin, as a rule, beardless. They wore conical caps and boots with 
upturned tips. These characteristics would seem to suggest that they 
were neither of Semitic nor Aryan origin, but belonged to the Mongo- 
lian or Turanian family, aiul this is as yet the more prevalent opinion.* 
The following casts of Hittite sculptures were shown: 

Cast of a colossal statue of the god Hadad, inscribed in 
the old Aranieaii dialect. {See plate 27.) The original of dolorite, 
now preserved in the Koyal Museum of Berlin, was discovered bj- von 
Luschau and Humann atGertchin, near Senjirli, which is about 70 miles 
to the northeast of Antioch in northern Syria. The excavations in this 
region were carried on by these scholars between 1888 and 1891 under 
the auspices of the German Oriental committee constituted for that 
purpose. The most important finds made during these excavations, 
besides the statue of Hadad, were the stele of Esarhaddon, King- of 
Asyria, 681-6(38 B. C, bearing an inscription in Assyrian cuneiform 
writing, and a statue erected by Bar-Eekub to the memory of his father 
Panammu, King of Samaal, the ancient Semitic name of the region of 
Senjirli, inscribed, like the statue of Hadad, in the old Aramean dia- 
lect. Both these Aramean inscriptions are cut in high relief, like the 
hieroglyphic inscriptions on the Hittite monuments. The character of 
the writing resembles that of theMoabite stone and the language bears 
a closer resemblance to Hebrew than the Aramaic of the later period. 

The statue of Hadad was erected by Panammu, son of Kami, King of 
Ja'di, in northern Syria, in the eighth century B. C., to the gods El, 
Eeshef, Rakubel, Shemesh, and above all to Hadad. Hadad was the 
name of the supreme Syrian deity, the Baal, or Sun god, whose worship 
extended from Carchemish, the ancient Hittite capital in Syria, to Edom 
and l^alestine. 

Many Edomite and Syrian kings bore the name of the deity as a 
title.^ In Zachariah xii, 11, there is mentioned a place in the valley of

mish, and in the Assyrian inscriptions there occurs the abbreviated 
form of "Dada, god of Aleppo." Of the four other divinities named, 
El became the generic terra for deity among Hebrews and Assyrians. 
Shemesh is the Sun god (Assyrian Shamash). Keshef appears to be a 
Hittite divinity, while Eekubel is met with here for the first time. The 
inscription contains thirty-four lines. The first part (lines 1 to 15) 
contains the dedication of Panammu to the gods to whom the monument 
was erected, who conferred on him the government over Ja'di, and 
granted the land plenty and abundance. The second part (lines 13 to 
24) relates the injunction of Kami to liis son Panammu, that he erect 
a statue to Hadad and honor him with sacrifices. The third part (lines 
24 to 34) contains the usual curses against those who should destroy, 
deface, or carry oft' the monument.^

HiTTiTE LION CHASE. (See plate 30.) This relief, which probably

from a chariot occupied by the charioteer and the archer. In front of 
the chariot and its spirited horse the lion is attacked by two men, who 
drive spears in the fore and hind parts of its body. The whole scene 
combines archaism with vivid and i)owerful naturalism. The original, of 
granite, was found at Saktschegozu and is now in the Koyal Museum 
of Berlin, Germany,

COLLECTION OF BIBLES. 

The last section of the exhibit consisted of a small collection of 
bibles, arranged so as to show the originals and the versions. It 
included manuscripts and old and rare editions of the original texts, 
as well as copies of the most important ancient and modern transla- 
tions of the scriptures. This part of the exhibit was not only of 
interest to biblical students, but also served to illustrate the study 
of x)alieography. 

The Old Testament. — The Old Testament is mainly written in the 
Hebrew language, which was the Semitic dialect spoken in Canaan. 
It is cognate to Assyrian, Arabic, Ethiopic, and Aramean, and most 
closely allied to Phenician and Moabite. Daniel ii, 4, to vii, 28, and 
Ezra iv, 8, to vi, 18, and vii, 12-20, are written in Aramean; also a few 
words iv Genesis and Jeremiah. 

The canon of the Old Testament is divided by the Jews into three 
portions— the law, the prophets, and the writings — and subdivided into 
twenty-four books. Josephns counts twenty-two books, which was fol- 
lowed by Origen. The fixing of the canon goes back by tradition to 
Ezra and tlie men of the great synagogue; some, however, are of the 
opinion that the canonicity of the ])ro[)hets and writings (Greek hagi- 
ographa, cr sacred writings) was settled much later. According to the 
jnesent actual count the Old Testament contains thirty-nine books. 
This, howt Ver, does not argue a different content from ancient times — 
simply a further subdivision of books. 

Before the Exile the books were written in the ancient Phenician 
characters which appear in some ancient Phenician inscriptions, on the 
Moabite stone, on some coins of the Maccabees, and in the Samaritan 
Pentateuch. In the period following the Exile and the restoration of 
Ezra the square letters, also called "Assyrian script," which are repre- 



1014 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

sented in the printed editions of the Old Testament, had gradually been 
introduced. 

Originally the Hebrew text was written without divisions into chap- 
ters and verses, and earlier still, no doubt, without divisions into words. 
Great care, however, was observed to transmit the text correctly. 
Josei)hus asserts that "no one has been so bold as either to add any- 
thing' to them, take anything from them, or to make any change in 
them" (the books of the Bible). Philo Judieus asserts that "the Jews 
have never altered one word of what was written by Moses," and in the 
Talmud a scribe is exhorted as follows: "My sou, take care how thou 
doest thy work (for thy work is a divine one), lest thou drop or add a 
letter." 

]S"evertheless, it seems likely that errors crept into the text. Accord- 
ingly, a body of Jewish scholars known as the Massorites labored for 
eight centuries (the second to the tenth of the Christian era) to fix the 
text. They added a number of marginal readings where the text was 
obscure or faulty, introduced a system of punctuation and accents, and 
made divisions into chapters, paragraphs, and verses. They counted 
and recorded the number of sections, verses, words, and even letters 
contained in the different books. The work of the Massorites on the 
original text of the Old Testament closes with the schools of Aaron 
ben Asher in Palestine and Moses ben ISTapthali in Babylonia, and 
it is generally admitted that the text has been handed down to us in 
a comijaratively pure and trustworthy form. The oldest complete 
manuscript of the Old Testament which is known dates from the 
year 1009 A. D. 

The New Testament. — The New Testament Avas written in Greek 
in its Hellenistic idiom. The original handwork of the authors per- 
ished early. The oldest manuscripts known date from the fourth 
century. The canon of the New Testament as it now stands and is 
accepted by all the churches was fixed by the councils of Hijipo (303) 
and Carthage (397) under the influence of St. Augustine. The present 
division of chapters in the New Testament was originated by Cardinal 
Hugo of St. Caro in the thirteenth century; that of the verses was 
made in imitation of the Old Testament, and is first found in the 
Latin translation of the Vulgate, and only as late as 1551 was it placed 
by Eobert Stephanus on the margin of the Greek text. 

The following specimens were shown: 

Hebrew Bible. Facsimileof Aleppo Codex. (^See plate 38.) The 
original manuscript is preserved in the synagogue at Aleppo, Syria. 
It is assigned to Aaron ben Asher (beginning of the tenth century), 
and considered as one of the best authorities for the text of the Old 
Testament, but is probably of somewhat later origin.^

Printed editions oe the Hebrew Bible. — Soon after the inven- 
tion of the art of printing parts of the Old Testament were pubHshed. 
Thus tlie Psalter with Kamchis Commentary appeared in 1477 (place 
unknown); the Pentateuch witli the Targum and the Commentary of 
Eashi in 1482 at Bologna, Italy. The first comi)lete Hebrew Bible was 
printed at Soucino, Italy, in 1488. The second edition has neither date 
nor place. The third was published at Brescia, Italy, in 1494. It was 
the one used by Luther for liis German translation. The present copy 
shown was a reprint, with slight alterations, of the Bible printed by 
Daniel Bomberg at Venice in 1517. In this edition the first eflbrt was 
made to give some of the Massoretic apparatus. It contains, besides 
the Hebrew original, several of the Chaldean Targums and com- 
mentaries. The editor was Felix Pratensis. 

Hebrew Bible, without vowel points, Antwerp, 1573-74. — This

vile letters in Hebrew grammar) are shaded. 

The Hebrew Bible, first American edition (see plate 41), pub- 
lished by Thomas Dobson, Philadelphia, 1814 (two volumes), jirinted by 
William Fry. — In 1812 Mr. Horwitz had proposed the publication of 
this edition of the Hebrew Bible, the first proposal of this kind in the 
United States. Early in 1813 he transferred his right and list of sub- 
scribers to Mr. Thomas Dobson. The work was advertised as follows 
in "Poulson's American Daily Advertiser," Monday, May 30, 1814:

ANCIENT VERSIONS OF THE BIBLE. ' 

i 

Translations of the Scriptures became necessary when the Jews were ' 

dispersed in the Greco-Roman world and gradually abandoned the use ' 

of the Hebrew language, and later when Christianity was jiropagated i 

among various nations. The oldest and most important version of the i 

Old Testament, which in its turn became the parent of many other \ 

translations, is the Greek of Alexandria, known by the name of the j 

Septuagint. The name Septuagint, meaning seventy, is derived from ; 

the tradition that it was made by a company of seventy (or rather ' 

seventy-two) Jewish scholars, at Alexandria, under the reign of | 

Ptolemy Philadcli)hus, 285-247 B. C, who desired a copy for the ^ 

library he was gathering. The truth of its origin seems to be that ' 

Alexandria became, after the Babylonian captivity, a center of Jewish j

population. As time went on the Jews lost command of tlie Hebrew 
language and required a translation of their sacred books into Greek. 
The men who met this want differed very much in know edge and 
skill, were of an indeteriuinate number, and of different periods, 
beginning the work at the time of Ptolemy Philadeljjhus and ending it 
about 150 B. C. Tlie Pentateuch is much more (carefully translated 
than the rest of the Bible. Books now considered apocryphal were 
included in the canon. The Septuagint was used by the Jews until 
the second century of the Christian era, when they reverted to the 
Hebrew. It was also, no doubt, used by the Apostles and by the 
Church Fathers, who refer to it under the name of " Vulgata." 

Targum or Aramean translation of the Old Testament. 
Parallel edition of the Pentateuch with the Hebrew text and various 
Hebrew commentaries, Vienna, 1859. — Targum, which means transla- 
tion, is a name specifically given to the Aramean versions. They are 
supposed to owe their origin to the disuse of the Hebrew tongue by 
exiles in Babylon. They were at first oral, and arose from the custom 
of having the law read in Hebrew and then rendered by the official 
translator {Mctnrgeman, English dragoman) into Aramean. The best 
Targum is that which passes under the name of Onkelos, who lived 
about 70 A. D. It is, however, generally assumed that, in its present 
shape at least, it was produced in the third century A. I), in Babylonia. 
That ascribed to Jonathan ben Uziel, which originated in the fourth 
century A. D. in Babylon and is only extant on the Prophets, is more 
in the nature of an homiletic paraphrase, while the so-called Jerusalem 
Targum ("Pseudo- Jonathan") was probably not completed till the 
seventh century. 

Facsimile of manuscripts of the Septuagint, ascribed to 300 
A. D. — The original is au Egyptian papyrus now at Vienna. It con- 
sists of sixteen sheets written on both sides, and contains the greater 
part of Zechariah from the fourth chapter and parts of Malachi. It is 
written in uncial characters (capitals) and contains no divisions between 
the words. 

Facsimile of the Codex Vaticanus, containing the Old and 
New Testaments, in six volumes. Pome, 18G8-1881. — The Codex Vati- 
canus, so called from the fact that it is preserved in the Vatican at 
Rome, is the best and oldest Biblical manuscript now known. It is 
written in Greek, in uncial characters, and was probably the work of 
two or three scribes in Egypt during the fourth century. The original 
is probably the most valuable treasure of the Vatican Library. It was 
brought to Rome by Pope Nicholas V in 1448. The manuscript is not 
quite complete; there are a few gaps in the Old Testament, and the 
New Testament ends with Hebrews ix, 14. 

Codex Sinaiticus. Facsimile edition, St. Petersburg. Four vol- 
umes, 1802. — The Codex Sinaiticus was discovered in 185'.) by Constan- 
tine Tischenforf in the Convent of St. Catharine at the foot of Mount 



1018 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

Sinai. It was transferred to Cairo, then to Leipsic, and later to St. 
Petersburg, where it is preserved iu the Imperial Library. His text 
was printed in Leipsic from tyi)es especially cast iu imitation of the 
original and published at St. Petersburg at the expense of Czar 
Alexander II. The original is on parchment, written in uncial char- 
acters, tour columns to a page, and forty eight lines on a page. It 
dates from the middle of the fourth century. It contains the greater 
part of the Old Testament and the whole of the New Testament. Four 
different scribes were employed in its writing. 

Codex Alexandrinus. Printed in type to represent the original 
manuscript. London, 181G. — This facsimile version of the Alexandrian 
or Egyptian text of the Bible appeared in 1816 in four volumes. Vol- 
umes I-III containing the Old Testament and Volume IV the New Tes- 
tament. It contains the whole Bible, with the exception of a few parts. 
The original manuscript was presented to King Charles I by Sir Thomas 
Eoe, from Cyril Lucar Patriarch, of Constantinople. It was transferred 
to the British Museum in 1753. It is written on parchment in uncials, 
without division of chapters, verses, or words. Tradition i)laces the 
writing of this manuscript in the fourth century, but it is now generally 
assumed to date from the tifth century. 

The Vulgate or Latin Bible. — The Vulgate goes back to a 
Latin translation made from the Septuagint, in North Africa, in the 
second century, and known as the Yettis Latina or ^^ (J\d Latin." A 
revised form of this translation was current in Italy toward the end 
of the fourth century, and was known as the Itala or "Italic." The 
present version, however, is due to St. Jerome (Hieronymus), and was 
made by him in Bethlehem between 383 and 404 A. D. It was for 
a long time the Bible of the Western Church and of a large part 
of the Easter u Church. St. Jerome began the revision of the Old 
Testament with the book of Psalms, of which he produced three 
copies known as the Boman, Galilean, and Hebrew Psalters. But 
of the rest of the Old Testament he made a new translation from the 
original Hebrew, with which he was well acquainted. The translation 
is commonly called the Vulgate, a name which was originally given to 
the Septuagint. It is still in use by the Roman Catholic Church. It 
was printed by Gutenberg between 1450 and 1455, being the first 
important si)ecimen of printing with movable types. 

Syriac Old Testament. Edited by S. Lee and printed at London, 
1823. — The oldest Syriac version of the Bible is the Peshitta ("correct" 
or "simple"), the most accurate of the ancient translations. It is 
referred to in the Commentaries of Ephraim the Syrian, in the fourth 
century, and was already at that time an old book. 

The whole translation was made from the Hebrew, but the translators 
were free in their renderings, and seem also to have been acquainted 
with the Septuagint.

Coptic New Testament. — Manuscript of the seventeenth century, 
Cairo, Egypt. Coptic was the language of the Egyptian Christians. 
It is a developmenfc from the ancient hieroglyphic language, with an 
admixture of Greek words, and continues to the i)resent day to be used 
in the services of the Christian Church in Egypt. There were differ- 
ences in the dialects spoken in different parts of the country, and so 
there are three Egvptian translations of the Bible — the 'Ihebaic or 
Sahidic, the Memphitic or Bahiric, commonly called the Coptic, and 
the Bashmuric. They all probably date from the second century and 
are made after the Septuagint. The present manuscript contains 
St. Mark in the Bahiric dialect. 

Ethiopic version op the Bible, — Photograph of original Bible, 
preserved in the United States National Museum. This coi)y was 
obtained from King Theodore, of Abyssinia, by Lord Napier, and by 
him presented to General Grant. The Ethiopic version was made 
from the Septuagint in the fourth century, probably by Frumentins, 
the ajjostle of Ethiopia, It has forty-six books in all, containing, in 
addition to the Canon, a large number of Apocryphal books. 

Arabic version op Saadia Gaon. — In Hebrew characters. The 
Peniateuch, edited by J. Derenbonrg, Paris, 1893. Saadia Gaon was 
born at Fayum, A. D. 892, and died in 942. His translation of the 
Bible is rather a paraphrase, and has a high exegetical value.

MODERN TRANSLATIONS OF THE BIBLE. 

The New Testament, translated by John Wyclifpe about 
138U; lU'inted from a contemporary manuscript by William Pickering, 
London, 184S. John Wyclifl'e was born in Yorkshire about 1320. He 
studied at Baliol College, Oxford, aiul was for some time master of that 
college. He became later rector of Lutterworth, in Leicestershire, and 
was the foremost leader of the reform party. He died in 1384. About 
1380 he undertook, with the assistance of some of his followers, espe- 
cially Nicholas Hereford, the translation of the entire Bible into 
English from the Latin of the Vulgate. It was the first complete 
English Bible. His translation was, after his death, revised by one of 
his adherents. The present copy is assumed to rejjresent the first 
version prepared by Wyclifife himself, or at least under his supervision.

dale was born between 1484 and 148G in Gloucestershire. He was 
educated at Oxford and afterwards at Cambridge. He went to Ham- 
burg and later joined Luther at Wittenberg, where he finished the 
translation of the New Testament into English. The first edition was

issued in i525. It was tlie first Englisli translation made from the 
Greek, and it became tlie basis of all subsequent ones. It was also the 
first part of the Scrii)tures printed in the English language. In 1530 
the translation of the Pentateuch was issued. His English style was 
very good and was largely retained in the Authorized version. His 
translation was condemned by the English bishops, and was ordered to 
be burned. Tyndale was strangled for heresy at Antwerp in 153G, and 
his body burned. 

The Gothic and Anglo-Saxon Gospels, with the versions of 
Wyclifie and Tyndale. Arranged by Rev. Joseph Bosworth, London, 
18G5. — The Gothic version was made in the fourth century by Bishop 
Ulfilas, born 318 A. D., died about 381. It is said to have been a com- 
plete version, with the excei)tion of the Book of Kings. It was proba- 
bly completed about 360 A. D. Only fragments are preserved in the 
so called Codex Argenteus, or ''Silver Book," in the library of the Uni- 
versity of Upsala, Sweden. The Anglo-Saxon version was begun by 
King Alfred, who translated the Psalms in the ninth century. The 
translation now extant dates to the tenth century." 

Coveruale's Bible. Reprint by Baxter, 1838. — Miles Ooverdale 
was born at Coverham, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, 1488. He 
died at Geneva in 15(i9. His Bible was issued October 4, 1535, being 
the first complete Bible printed in the English language. It was not 
translated from theoriginal tongues, but was based chiefly on the Latin 
version and on Luther's Bible. It was undertaken at the wish of Thomas 
Cromwell, Earl of Essex, and dedicated to Henry VIII. 

The Genevan Version. Folio edition, printed at London, 1597. — 
This translation was made by English exiles during the reign of Mary, 
who took up their residence at Geneva. William Whittingham acted 
as editor, and his assistants were Thomas Cole, Christopher Goodman, 
Anthony Gilby, Thomas Sampson, and Bishop Coverdale. Some add 
John Knox, John Bodleigh, and John Pullain, and state that the trans- 
lators consulted Calvin and Beza. The first edition was printed at 
Geneva in 15G0. It was printed at the expense of John Bodley, father 
of the founder of the Bodleian Library in Oxford. It was the most pop- 
ular Bible until superseded by the Authorized version, and was that 
biought to America by the Pilgrim Fathers. Thedivision of chapters into 
verses, which had been introduced by Whittingham, from Stephauus's 
edition of 1551, was here for the first time adopted for the English Bible. 
The text of the Bible is accompanied by explanatory comments on the 
margin. It is sometimes called the "Breeches" Bible because of the 
substitution in Genesis iii, 7, of the rendering "breeches" for "aprons" 
of the other Englisli version. 

King James or Authorized Version. Folio edition, printed at 
London by Robert Barker, 1613. — The preparation of a new English 
Bible was decided upon at a conference held at Hampton Court January

in and 18, 1004. In tbat year King James I issued a commission to 
fifty-four eminent divines to undertake tlie work. It was not begun, 
however, until 1607, when seven of the original number bad died. The 
forty-seven survivors were divided into six committees, two sitting at 
Oxford, two at Cambridge, and two at Westminster. In 1010 their 
work was completed, and then revised by a committee of six. Although 
universally known as the Authorized versiou, no record, either ecclesi- 
astical or civil, has ever been found of such authorization. The first 
edition was printed by liobert Barker iu 1(511, 

The Kevised Veiision. — The increased knowledge concerning the 
original texts of the Scriptures, especially of the Greek i^ew Testament, 
which resulted from the discovery of old manuscripts led to the desire 
for a revision of the Authorized version which was based upon the 
received text of Erasmus and Stephanus and exhibited many discrep- 
ancies from the emended original text. Such a revision was early advo- 
cated by men like Bishop EUicott, Archbishop Trench, and Dean Alford. 
Efforts were also made from time to time in the House of Commons to 
have a royal commission appointed. In 1870 the upper house of the 
Canterbury Convocation, on the motion of Bishoi) Wilberforce, took the 
subject in band and instituted the proceedings which finally secured 
the accomplishment of the work. In 1871 an American committee of 
cooperation whs organized. The New Testament was comi)leted in 1881 
and the Old Testament in 1885. 

Parallel New Testament. Eevised version and Authorized 
version. (Seaside Library.) The Revised version of the New Testa- 
ment appeared iu England May 17, 1881, and in America May '20, 1881. 
The first half of the parallel Testament appeared in New York May 21 
and the second half May 23. 

The New Testament, translated by Constantine Tiscbendorf, 
Leipzig, 1809. Volume 1000, Tauchnitz series. — This translation was 
based on the labors of Tiscbendorf in revising the Greek text, largely 
due to bis discovery of the Sinaitic Codex. It points out many errors 
in the Authorized version, and undoubtedly paved the way for the 
Eevised version. 

Lutuee's Bible. German translation, made by Martin Luther. 
Edition of 1554. — The New Testament api)eared in 1522 and the Old 
Testament in parts between 1523 and 1532. The complete Bible 
appeared in 1534. Previous to Luther's version there were in use at 
least ten distinct German versions, literal translations of the Latin Bible. 
Luther worked from the original tongues, and yet succeeded in giving 
the Bible a real German dress and a style tbat would appeal to German 
readers. Luther's translation was of prime importance iu assisting the 
progress of the Reformation, and is also the foundation of the German 
literary dialect. 

Spanish Old Testament. Amsterdam, Holland, 1661 A. D. (5421 
A. M.). — The first edition of this translation was printed in the middle

of the sixteeutli century. It bears the title " The Bible in the Spanish 
language, translated word for woid from the Hebrew, examined by the 
Inquisition, with the i)rivilegiuni of the Duke of Ferrara." It is there- 
fore generally known as the Ferrara Bible. The copies of this trans- 
lation are divided into two classes — one appropriate for the use of the 
Jews, the other suited to the purposes of the Christians. The transla- 
tion is extremely literal, and the translator has indicated with an 
asterisk the words which are in Hebrew equivocal, or capable of differ- 
ent meanings. 

Eliot's Indian Bible. (See plate 45.) Facsimile reprint. Wash- 
ington, 1 ). C, 1890. — John Eliot, "the apostle of the Indians," was born in 
England in 1(504 and received his education at Cambridge. In 1G31 he 
removed to America and settled at Roxbury, Massachusetts, as minister, 
wliere he remained until his death, in 1690. He became interested in the 
conversion of the Indians of New England, whom he believed to be the 
descendants of the lost tribes of Israel, and determined to give them 
the Scriptures in their tribal tongue, which was the Natick dialect. 
He completed the translation of the New Testament in 16G1 and that 
of the entire Bible in 1CG3. It was printed in Cambridge, Massachusetts, 
by Samuel Green and Marmaduke Johnson, "ordered to be printed by 
the Commissioners of the United Colonies in New England, At the 
Charge, and with the Consent of the Cori)oratiou in England For the 
Propagation of the Gospel amongst the Indians in New England." 

Eliot's Indian Bible was the first ever printed in America, and the 
entire translation is stated to have been written with one pen. Eliot 
also published an Indian grammar and a number of other works, 
mostly relating to his missionary labors. The Natick dialect, in which 
the translation of the Bible was made, is now extinct. 

Miniature Bible. — The smallest complete edition printed from 
type. Yersion of ICll, 

Cromwell's Soldier's Pocket Bible. Facsimile rej^rint. Com- 
piled by Edmund Calamy and issued for the use of the army of the 
Commonwealth, London, 1043. — It has frequently been stated that 
every soldier in Cromwell's army was provided with a pocket Bible, 
and it was supposed that an especially small copy was used. In 1854 
the late George Livermore, of Cambridgeport, Massachusetts, discov- 
ered that the Bible which Cromwell's soldiers carried was not the whole 
Bible, but the soldier's pocket Bible, which was generallj^ buttoned 
between the coat and the waistcoat, next to the heart. It consists of 
a number of quotations from the Genevan version (all but two from the 
Old Testament) which were especially applicable to war times. Only 
two copies of the original of this work are known to be in existence — 
one in America and the other in the British Museum. The work was 
reissued in 1G93 under the title "The Christian Soldier's Penny Bible." 
The only copy known to be extant is in the British Museum.^

Hieroglyphic Bible. (See plate 4G.) Publislied by Joseph Avery, 
Plymouth; printed by George Clark & Co., Charleston, 1820. — A num- 
ber of hieroglyphic Bibles have been printed in America, the first being 
that of Isaiah Thomas, at Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1788. Words 
in each verse are represented by pictures, the whole being designed 
"to familiarize tender age in a pleasing and diverting manner with 
early ideas of the Holy iScriptures."" 

Bishop Asuury's Testament, with hundreds of the texts for his 
sermons marked in his own handwriting. — Francis Asbury, born in 
Staffordshire 1745, died in Virginia ISIG, was the first bishop of the 
Methodist Church ordained in America. He was sent as a missionary 
by John Wesley in 1771, aifd in person organized the work of his 
denomination in the entire eastern portion of the United States, per- 
formed the first ordination in the Mississippi Valley, and in 1784 
founded the first Methodist college. 

Thomas Jefferson's Bible, consisting of texts from the Evangel- 
ists, historically arranged. — This book bears the title, " The life and 
morals of Jesus of Nazareth, extracted textually from the gospels, in 
Greek, Latin, French, and English." Four versions were employed. 
The passages were cut out of printed copies and pasted in the book. 
A concordance of the texts is given in the front and the sources of 
the verses in the margins. The section of the Eoman law under which 
Jeflerson supi)osed Christ to have been tried is also cited. All of these 
annotations, as well as the title page and concordance, are in Jefferson's 
own handwriting. Two maps, one of Palestine and another of the 
ancient world, are pasted in the front. Jefierson long had the prej)a- 
ration of this book in mind. On January 29, 1804, he wrote from 
Washington to Dr. Priestley: "I had sent to Philadelphia to get two 
Testaments (Greek) of the same edition, and two English, with a 
design to cut out the morsels of morality and x)aste them on the leaves 
of book." Nearly ten years later (October 13, 1813), in writing to John 
Adams, he stated that he had for his own use cut up the gosj)els "verse 
by verse" out of the printed book, arranging the matter which is 
evidently His (Christ's). In the same letter he describes the book as 
" the most sublime and benevolent code of morals which has ever been 
offered to man." 

iThe American editions are not described in W. L. CTouston's splendid work on 
Hieroglyphic Bibles.

THE LAMP OP THE ESKIMO. 



By AValteu Hough, Ph. D., 
Assistant Curator, Division of Ethnolo<Jii, U. S. National Museum. 



The comi)leteness of the collection of Eskimo lamps in the National 
Mnseuni, showing as it does examples from nearly every tribe from 
Labrador to the Aleutian Islands, renders it possible to treat them 
monographically. 

This paper is one of a series in course of preparation under the gen- 
eral subject of heating and illumination from the standi)oint of the 
ethnologist. 

It is scarcely necessary to remark upon the inhospitable surround- 
ings oif the Eskimo or the rigor of the climate retiected in their cave- 
like houses. One is forced to recognize that in this region the need for 
warmth and light is only second to the prime need for food. This fact 
appears in the diet and clothing of the natives, in the nonconducting 
structure of the house, in the plan of the burrow-like entrance and in 
the height of the sleei)ing benches around the hut, which designedly 
or from instinct are so placed as to take advantage of the heated air 
collected under the ceiling. Thus Schwatka says that the "Netschillik 
Iniuiit, who inhabit the mainland opposite King William's Land, have 
the warmest Igloos in the Arctic, as they are very low. The heat of the 
lamp and of the body keeps them very warm."' 

At the same time there is a question whether the bodily temperature 
of the Eskimo is higher than that of the Europeans. Observations 
made at North Blufl'ou the Hudson Strait show that the mean temper- 
ature of the party in December and July was 98.1° and 97.7°, while 
tliat of the Eskimo for the corresponding dates was 100.2° and 98.4°.^ 

The observations of Dr. Green, of the Thetis, which prove that the 
summer temperature of the Eskimo differs little from the normal (98.4°), 
lead him to the conclusion that the latitude makes inappreciable difter- 
ence in animal heat and that the nature of the food supply of the 
Eskimo is sufficient to counteract the effect of natural forces.^ To

render the observations complete, however, the winter temperature of 
these Esliimo should be had for comparison. 

Though the Eskimo live at a temperature of zero Fahrenheit, travel- 
ers have noticed their idiosyncrasy with regard to cold. The clothing 
is designedly left open at intervals around the waist and the bare skin 
exi)osed to the cold air, Asa rule the Eskimo strip when in the house 
and sleep naked. Another indication of their fevcrishness is the con- 
sumption of great (quantities of ice-cold water. 

No explorer has failed to notice the Eskimo lamj), around which the 
whole domestic life of this people seems to focus. Far more remark- 
able than being the unique possessors of the lamp in the Western 
Hemisphere, the Eskimo presents the spectacle of a people depending 
for their very existence upon this household belonging. Indeed, it is 
a startling conclusion that the lamp has determined the occupancy of 
an otherwise uninhabitable region by the Eskimo, or, in other words, 
the distribution of a race.^ 

The extent to which the lamp has entered into Eskimo life as a social 
factor is very great. It is essentially the care and possession of the 
women, peculiarly a sign of the social unit, and though several families 
may inhabit the same igloo each maternal head must have her own 
lamp. "A woman without a lamp" is an expression which betokens, 
of all beings, the most wretched among the Eskimo. Dr. Bessels like- 
wise remarks that the lamp is necessary for the existence of the female 
head of the family. The lamp is placed in the woman's grave.^ 

Dr. Bessels maintains that, in spite of Christianity and civilization, 
the E.skinio is not willing to part with the lamp; but as long as he is 
in possession of it he will be Eskimo in each one of his pulse beats, for 
where this lamp exists cleanliness is impossible.^ ISTausen also remarks 
upon the persistence of the lamp, even in houses in larger settlements, 
wliere Danish stoves are found. The soapstone cooking pots, however, 
have been superseded by iron pots.^ 

The high death rate among the Eskimo is attributed by Dr. Bessels 
to the carbon i^articles sent off by the lamp, which penetrate the air 
cells of the lungs.^ 

The excess of carbon dioxide and the general bad air of the huts 
must be very detrimental to health. In the spring when the thawing 
begins the huts are almost uninhabitable, but the people are compelled 
to stay in them, as it is too early to take to the tents. This is the time 
of greatest sickness. Hall relates that seventeen persons slei)t in a 
snow hut 10 feet in diameter. "In the morning, between the hours of 
3 and 4, the men waked, ate a quantity of deer meat, smoked, and again 

' Tho migration of peoples effected by tlie knowledge of making fire artificially 
will be discussed in another section of the general work.

went to sleep. At 5 tlie whole party were aroused to find that tlie 
hiuip smoke during the uight had covered them witli soot." Hall 
waked with a severe headache from the "excess of carbonic acid gas 
generated by three fire lights and seventeen persons." ' 

Not the least value of the lamp to the Eskimo is the light which it 
aftords. Simpson remarks that the Eskimo never seem to think of fire 
as a means of imparting warmth,- and Kane observes that their lamps 
are used for cooking, for light, for melting snow, and for drying clothes, 
rather than to warm the air.' Nevertheless, the lamp does afford con- 
siderable warmth, as Simpson admits in another i^lace. Light, however, 
is highly necessary during the long darkness of winter and the dark- 
ness of the Eskimo dwelling. Nanseu has several times remarked that 
the Eskimo do not sleep in the dark like other people.^ Perhaps the 
inconvenience of rubbing out fire with the fire drill to relight the lamp 
is one reason. Likewise the feeling of companionship, security, or 
sociability given by light is appreciated by the Eskimo in common with 
all other human beings. These instinctive feelings determined in no 
small degree man's first overtures to his fire ally. 

The lamp is not the sole fire of the Eskimo, for in a very few localities 
where fuel can be obtained fires are made in the open air or in the 
middle of the tent for cooking in summer. The fuel used is peat or 
guano furnished by gulls in East Greenland, or the Arctic willow, drift- 
wood, or grass in other sections. In some places, though fuel can be 
obtained, it is not burned. However, the open fire is only an incident, 
and the whole^ Eskimo race depend on the large lamps or oil burners 
made of stone which form part of the furidture of every hut.'' 

Kumlein describes a curious oven used at Cumberland Gulf. " In 
summer especially, when on hunting excursions, they very often ' fry' 
meat by making a little fireplace of stones and laying a flat piece of stone 
on top. The opening to receive the fuel supply is to windward. For 
fuel, at sueh times, they use Gassiope tetragona and Ledum palustre; these 
shrubs make a quick and very hot fire. It would be comparatively an 
easy task for these i)eople to gather enough Gassiope tetragona during the 
summer to burn during the coldest weather, and not rely wholly on blub- 
ber."^ The Eskimo hut may be likened to an inhabited oven with the 
lamp as its internal heat. The utilization of the heat is as complete as in 
the Samovar. The lamp is placed upon its support, above it hangs the

cooking pot, and above tliis, suspeuded from the ceiling, the frame of 
slats, network of tliongs, or pegs, on which are placed articles to dry iu 
the ascending warm air. Thus the lamp, which has a single function 
in other parts of the Avorld, has added among the Eskimo that of the fire- 
place and cooking stove. The Eskimo Uimp is classifically the homo- 
logue of the fireplace in the center of the houses among the majority of 
tribes in America and Asia. 

Hans Egede gives the following description of the lamps of the Green- 
land communal houses: "Though ten or twenty train-lamps burn at 
once in the houses of the Greenlanders one does not perceive the steam 
or smoke thereof to fill these cottages. They take care in trimming the 
lamp, taking dry moss rubbed very small, which they lay on one side of 
the lamp, which, being lighted, burns very softly and does not cause 
any smoke if it is not laid on too thick or in lumps. This fire gives 
such a heat that it not only serves to boil their victuals, but also heats 
their rooms to that degree that it is as hot as a bagnio. But to those 
who are not used to this way of firing the smell is very disagreeable." ^ 
Parry, in his Second Voyage, presents a view of an Eskimo interior 
wliicli shows in an interesting way the lamp and its appurtenances. 
(See plate 4.) It is described as follows : 

The fire belonging to each family consists of a single lamp or shallow vessel of 
lapis ollaris, its form being the lesser segment of a circle. The wick, composed of 
dry moss rubbed between the hands nutil it is quite inflammable, is disposed along 
the edge of the lamp on the straight side, and in a greater or snuiller quantity lighted, 
according to the heat required or the fuel that can be afforded. When the whole 
length of this, which is sometimes above 18 inches, is kindled, it affords a most bril- 
liant and beautiful light without any perceptible smoke or offensive smell. The 
lamp is made to supply itself with oil, by suspending a long, thin slice of whale, 
seal or sea-horse blubber near the flame, the warmth of which causes the oil to drip 
into the vessel until the whole is extracted. Immediately over the lamp is fixed a 
rude and rickety framework of wood from which their pots are suspended, and serv- 
ing also to sustain a large hoop of bone, having a net stretched tight within it. 
This contrivance, called Unnetat, is intended for the reception of any wet things, 
and is usually loaded with boots, shoes, and mittens. The fireplace just described, 
as situated at the upper end of the apartment, has always, two lamps facing differ- 
ent ways, one for each family occupying the corresponding bedplace. There is fre- 
quently also a smaller and less-pretending establishment on the same model, lamp, 
T)ot, net, and all, in one of the corners next the door; for one apartment sometimes 
contains three families, which are always closely related, and no married woman or 
oven a widow without children is without her separate fireplace. 

With all the lamps lighted and the hut full of people and dogs a thermometer 
placed on the net over the fire indicated a temperature of 38^ ; when removed 2 or 3 
feet from this situation it fell to 32°, and placed close to the wall stood at 23'=, the 
temperature of the open air being at the time 25° below zero. A greater degree of 
warmth than this pi-oduces extreme inconvenience by the dropping from the roofs. 
This they endeavor to obviate by applying a little piece of snow to the place from 
which a drop proceeds, and this, adhering, is for a short time an effectual remedy ; 
but for several weeks in the spring, when the weather is too warm for these edifices 
and still too cold for tents, they suffer much on this account. 

' H. Egede, Greenland, London, 1745, p. 116. 



THE LAMP OF THE ESKIMO. 1031 

The Eskimo stone pots for cooking are called oot koo se('A;8. They are made iu simi- 
lar proportion, thoiigh of various sizes, corresponding with the dimensions of the 
lami> that burns under it. Suspended by a line of sinew at each end to the frame- 
work over the fire, smoke and oil blackens the stone. Cracked and mended with 
sinew or rivets of copjier, iron, or lead make it quite water-tight.' 

There is, however, auother side to this picture. Lieuteuant Schwatka 
relates that "the Kennepetoo luuuits (around Chesterfield Inlet, espe- 
cially north of it) use few or no lainj>s to warm their snow huts, and 
despite the high beds and low roofs, they are cold, cheerless, and 
uncomfortable beyond measure. Tliese Innuits are essentially reindeer 
killers and eaters and lay in an insignificant stock of seal oil to burn 
in their lamps. Walrus killing is unknown to them. For light they 
use a piece of reindeer suet laid beside a piece of lighted moss, all 
being on a large flat stone. The light of the stone lami) in all igloos 
where it is used is sufficient for all purposes of sewing and repairing. 
It is certainly ecjual to the light from three or four kerosene lamps, 
and with the white snow walls gives ample illumination."^ The same 
authority writes that the U-quei-sik Salik Innuit around the mouth of 
Blacks Eiver, who are salmon eaters, are another tribe that dispense 
with warming their snow houses for want of oil, but they use lamps 
for light. ^ 

The Eskimo lamp has always been regarded a fixture of the house, 
subject only to the removals of the family. There are, however, small 
lanii)s which are carried by travelers or hunters on journeys whose use 
is primarily for light, but not less important as a means for lighting 
the indispensable pipe. This is probably the intent of all the small 
lamps in collections, except the quite small models, which are children's 
toys or those buried with the dead. 

The Eskimo lamp is usually a shallow, elliptical vessel of stone, and 
infrequently of earthenware, clay, bone, or wood. This is perhaps 
determined by the prevalence of the proper material, and it will be 
seen later that pottery or clay lamps are found only on the low tundra 
of the Yukon Delta or St. Lawrence Island. Whenever soapstone can 
be had the lami) is invariably of that material, according to an old cus- 
tom. Soapstone is easily carved, free from flaws, absorbs and retains 
heat, giving it up to melt the fat, to keep the oil fluid, and to supply 
the wi(;k. Extraordinarily long journeys are made to secure soap- 
stone. Dr. Boas^ records that the Central Eskimo made journeys 
sometime lasting several years in quest of soapstone, which is found in 
a few places, and rarely in pieces large enough for the manufacture of 
lamps or j)ots. The same is true of localities in Alaska. Soapstone 
was thus one of (he most prominent features of the trade and inter-

course among the Eskimo tribes. The southern Eskimo of Alaska, 
notably at Kadiak and the Peninsula, made their lamps of very hard 
dioritic rock. 

It is quite probable that the ancient lamps were fashioned with stone 
tools at the quarry, in order to save weight in transport. The Kadiak 
lamps mentioned above show plainly the marks of the stone hammer 
used in reducing them to shape by pecking. Substitutes for the lamp 
and cooking jjot are sometimes made by Eskimo women from slabs of 
stone, which they cement together with a composition of seal's blood, 
clay, and dog's hair applied warm, the vessel being held at the same 
time over the flame of a lamp, which dries the cement to the hardness 
of stone.' In fact, a slab of stone, a piece of fat, and some moss for a 
wick form an extempore lamp on occasions.^ In this view the rude 
Aleut lamps figured on plate 22 are such makeshifts. In connection 
with this, Nansen tells of an Eskimo who, being detained overnight on a 
journey, made a saucer serve as a lamp.^ Frequently the lamp follows 
the outline of the orig.nal j)iece of soapstoue, where the greatest 
possible reservoir capacity is required in the given slab. 

Necessarily the lamp and cooking vessels are sometimes broken. 
Their repair is a good example of Eskimo ingenuity, ettected by a cement 
of blood, clay, and hair, or a strong sewing of sinew. Several lamps and 
pots in the United States National Museum have been repaired by this 
method. 

Seal oil is preferred for burning in the lamp, though any animal fat 
may be used. Capt. E. P. Hereudeen informs the author that the 
Ootkiahviemute carry for trading, seal oil put up in pokes of the skin 
of the animal itself, prepared for the purpose. These skins so made up 
contain about 25 gallons of oil. The interior natives and river tribes 
are dependent upon the coast people for oil to burn in their lamps, as 
the small amount of fat which the reindeer yields is iusufiticient for the 
long arctic nights. 

The lamp eats like a native; successful hunting means cheer and com- 
fort in the hut of these sociable people during the winter. The economy 
of oil is often forced upon the Eskimo, for starvation and darkness is a 
frequent and near-by exigency. Schwatka says that he has known 
cases where the Eskimo were extremely anxious to economize oil needed 
to melt ice for drinking water, in which six or seven wells were dug 
through thick ice, before they gave up the attempt or were successful." 
Every particle of fat is saved on principle. 

The women s(;rape sealskins with a scoop of ivory, which is one of 
the accompaniments of the lamp.'^ There is also nearly always pro-

vision for saving the oil which may drop from the lip of the lamp. To 
keep the floor clean to prevent the lamp sinking into the snow, thus get- 
ting out the level and also conducting away the heat of the stone, a 
support is placed under it. This may consist of pegs of wood or pieces 
of bone stuck in the snow, a wooden block hollowed to catch the oil, or 
a block with three legs forming a stool. The forms will be figured later 
in the detailed description of the lamps by localities. No especial 
device for tipping the lamp in order to increase the supply of oil to the 
wick has been noticed. This is accomplished in a rude way by altering 
the position of the lamp on the supports, or by raising the rear support. 
Many lamps from their form incline toward the wick at a low angle. 
(See plate 17.) 1 

The oil is placed in the shallow reservoir and the supply is some- 
times kept up by suspending a piece of blubber near the flame. The 
fat nearly always needs some preparation before being put into the 
lamp. This is effected among the Central Eskimo by beating the blub- 
ber to break up the fat globules, allowing the oil to come out as soon 
as it is melted. In summer the blubber is chewed and ejected into the 
lamp.^ 

The woman's knife or nlii and the fat scrapers which have been the 
subjects of two valuable jiapers by Dr. O. T. Mason, are closely asso- 
ciated with the feeding of the lamp. 

The ulu is employed for cutting or mincing the blubber and the scoop 
or scrai)er for removing the fat from the inner surface of the skins. 
It is also used to transfer the fat to the lamp. The oil is allowed to 
stand level with the lower edge of the wick. The latter is made by 
rolling compact dried sphagnum moss, willow catskins, or jieat between 
the palms with a small quantity of fat. Women often carry little bags 
of the prepared moss." The line of wick is applied in an even ridge 
along the straight edge of the lamp, which varies in length from 2 to 
30 inches in different localities. This may be seen by contrasting the 
wide lamp of the far north with those of the south at Kadiak and the 
middle region, which have a very narrow lip. This seems to be due to 
the smaller need for light in the south, where the arctic night is not so 
long. However, Asiatic or othei" influence to the west may be the 
cause. Sometimes the wick is laid for only a portion of the length 
when only a small flame is required. Lamps with partitions adjusted 
and fastened in with cement are found at Point Barrow. Sometimes 
a large lamp is reduced to five concavities by low septums in order to 
increase the length of the wick edge when extra flame is needed. The 
care of the lamp is quite an acquirement. The wick must be dense or 

^A piece of skin is often placed under the lamp as a "catch all." Many lamps 
from various countries arc made double for this purpose.

the lamp will smoke, and it must be kept in order by means of a trim- 
mer, wliicli is a small piece of bone, stone, or wood. The trimmer 
dipped in oil forms a torch on occasion.' 

Dr. Bessels says that the wick is ignited at one end and the flame 
skillfully guided with the trimmer across the whole length of the edge. 
If the quickly charring wick extends too far into the flame, too much 
heat is taken away from it and it burns with a deep, red light and its 
external edge is not hot enough to consume the carbon particles which 
spread themselves as sooty clouds in the hut.^ 

Lamp trimming only reaches perfection in the old women of the tribe, 
who can prepare a lamp so that it will give a good, steady flame for 
several hours, while usually half an hour is the best that can be 
expected.' In an Eskimo tradition^ a woman takes down some eagle's 
feathers from a nail in the wall and stirs up the smoking lamji, so as to 
make it burn brightly. 

While, as a rule, the Eskimo lamp has a shallow, plain, reservoir, 
simply for holding oil, there are modifications of the reservoir of con- 
siderable interest. Some lamps of Cumberland Gulf, of East Green- 
land, of West Greenland, and Point Barrow have a raised portion or 
step at the rear of the reservoir; probably blubber to be melted grad- 
ually is placed upon it. Other lamps have a low ridge just fi^ont of the 
wick edge and parallel with it. This ridge either breaks down at the 
extremities, allowing the oil to flow arouiul to the wick, or it is per- 
forated or divided by deep cuts into two or three sections for the same 
purpose. The office of this ridge is to regulate the flow of oil to the 
wick and to prevent any sudden wash of oil carrying away the wick 
line. It is apparent that the lamps from St. Lawrence Island (see 
plate 14) could readily be carried about iu the hand if necessary. 

The lamp found by Gen. A. W. Greely in the high north has the 
ridge. Curiously enough it reappears in St. Lawrence Island, in Bering 
Strait, and among the Chukchis. A trace of the ridge is found in East 
Greenland and in Kadiak Island. These permanent ridges may have 
some connection with the septums fitted in the lamp of Point Barrow. 
There is no evidence, however, that they have been used as extra wick 
edges, as in the case of the Barrow lamps. 

The saucer-shaped pottery lamps of the Yukon tundra have no pro- 
vision for the wick around the edge. Some specimens appear to have 
been lighted on the edge, and Mr. Nelson assures the writer that this 
method is followed. 

Most observers have spoken in terms of praise of the excellent light 
given by the Eskimo lamp. The flame in a well-trimmed lamp is from 

' The name for torch is nanerut, or nanernag. The only other locality where the 
name is found is on the Mackenzie River, where it is called nenexeron. The nse of 
the torch is extremely uncommon among the Eskimo.

1 to 2 iiicbes liigli, very clear and steady. The oil and fat of the north- 
ern animal furnish illuminauts of the best quality. In the snow bouses 
of the east the white walls retlect the light, adding to its power. 

The administration of lighting for i)ublic use is very uncommon 
among the Eskimo, as it was among civilized peoples until recently. 
Occasionally there is a demand for an increase of light for the illumi- 
nation of places of assembly where shamanistic or other practices are 
being carried on. 

In an ivory model of skillful workmanship from Nusliagak, southern 
Alaska, exhibited in the United States National Museum, representing 
a wrestling match in a 
summer tent, there is 
a curious chandelier, 
consisting of two dish 
lamps placed on the 
ends of a crossbar and 
secured by strings to 
another parallel bar 
some distance above, 
the whole being sus- 
pended from the frame- 
work of the tent by 
cords. The lamps have 
each a tube, which be- 
ing painted red at the 
end seem to represent 
a single wick. This

The lamp is represented as illuminating a shaman's lodge.^ 

Long years of misapprehension render it almost useless to combat 
the popular idea that the Eskimo are by preference eaters of raw tlesh. 
Mr. Murdoch^ has pointed out that the Eskimo sometimes eat flesh 
raw, especially in a frozen state; in the region where fuel is very 
scarce this habit appears to have become fixed. The Eskimo when 
hunting or on a journey and the Eskimo at home are difterent persons 
as to habits. In the hut the pot hanging over the lamp always con-

tains food cooking for tlie family, and it is tlie woman's business to 
keep it going. On ordinary occasions the Eskimo prefers cooked food, 
for his digestive tract does not differ from that of other members of 
the human family. Improper eating produces similar effects upon him 
as upon more civilized people. When food is plenty it is true there is 
great feasting, and it would seem in the absence of intoxicants the 
torpor produced by gorging is the only method the Eskimo has of 
reaching the Nirvana of the civilized. It has been observed that the 
drinking of pure oil is not practiced with impunity by the Eskimo, 
who as a rule only take it as medicine. 

Kumlein' is sufficient authority for the statement that "when the 
Eskimo have been simmering meat, especially seal, in their boiling 

X)ots, they i)0ur off the liquor and 
mix it with about an equal quantity 
of blood; this makes a thick and 
rather greasy soup that must be 
quite nourishing; the children are 
very fond of it. It seems possible 
that from this dish has originated 
the popular error that these people

of water. It is curious that with 
its world of congealed water the Arctic should be a veritable Sahara. 
Water is usually supplied by melted snow or ice and the lamp is brought 
into requisition for the purpose, though sometimes the warmth of the 
hut is sufficient, especially if tlie vessel containing snow is placed near 
the flame. Dr. Kane figures a snow melter of considerable ingenuity 
which is reproduced here (tig. 2). Sometimes travelers carry water- 
tight pouches containing snow, which they put under the clothing to be 
melted by the heat of the body.'^ Mr. Astrup thus describes a method 
of melting ice for drinking water: "At the side of the lump of meat 
stood also a block of ice as clear as a crystal, whence the community 
obtained water, as in the center of it a cavity had been cut, at the 
bottom of which a stone was placed about the size of a man's fist, on 
which there burned with a good flame a piece of moss intersected with 
the blubber, and as the ice melted at the sides of the cavity the water 
collected at the bottom in a small, clear pool, whence it was consumed 
by the many parched mouths by sucking it up through hollow reindeer 
marrow bones." •'

THE LAMP OF THE ESKIMO. 1037 

The lamp and its iiccoinpaiiyiug pot usually agree as to size, the rule 
being- that the length of the pot shall be equal to the length of the 
wick edge. The drying" frame is larger, owing to the size of the 
articles to be laid ui)on it, and also because the warm air above tlie 
lamp spreads out. 

In the huts of hunting parties out on the tundra a skin is hung 
jiround the lamp and frame, to better focus the heat for the very 
necessary drying of the wet garments.' 

The rack or net hung over the lamp points out another very important 
feature of the Eskimo domestic economy. Mittens, boots, and other 
articles to be dried are put on the rack preparatory to their manipula- 
tion and softening by the women. The rack is often made by lashing- 
slats of wood together, or, where wood is scarce, a hoop of wood or 
bone, crossed by netting, is found. The rack is supported from the 
ceiling or from the side of the hut, and from it the pot is usually sus- 
pended. The rack, however, is not found south of the Arctic circle 
among the western Eskimo where sticks are driven into the walls, 
taking the place of the rack. 

The value of the lamps in the arts is very great. First in import- 
ance is the bending of the wood for snowshoes, boxes, etc., which is 
accomplished by dipping the wood in water and steaming it over the 
lamj). Superior work of this kind is done, as the snowshoes and wooden 
vessels in the United States National Museum bear witness. Ivory, 
antler, and bone are also bent over the lamp, after a preliminary soak- 
ing in urine.- Skins are dried in tanning over the lamp by the Eskimo 
of Cumberland Gulf. The hardening of the peculiar Eskimo cement 
has been mentioned. There are doubtless many other applications by 
which the lamp enters into the arts. 

It is not remarkable that the lamp enters also into the religion and 
folklore of this simple jieople; there is, however, very little recorded on 
the subject. Franz Boas has collected the most information on this 
point, which is presented in his valuable work on the Central Eskimo.^ 
In burial, the man's hunting implements are placed by his side; the 
l)ots, lamias, knives, etc., by the side of the woman, and by the child, 
its playthings.* Hall observed on a grave a small kettle hung over a 
lamp. A model of a lamp from a grave in Cumberland Gulf is figured 
by Dr. Boas and the United States ISTational Museum possesses several 
from graves in Greenland. This custom has been observed in other 
localities. The small oblong stones which were found by the late Baron

trimmers or rather ordinary torches, may be viewed in this light. 
Abandoned lamps may be due to the superstition which renders useless 
the articles in a hut rendered taboo by a death. The low burning lamp 
is also an adjunct of tlie wizard's incantations. 

In the United States National Museum there is a dance mask of 
wood in the shape of a human face, surmounted by a rude carving 
intended to represent tlie spirit of the Sandhill crane {Grus canadensis). 
In the head of the crane is a small cavity made to receive a stone oil 
lami), the light from which produces a weird effect during the dance. 
The spirit is visible only to the shaman or sorcerer. The mask is from 
Rasboinsky, Alaska (Lower Yukon.) ^ 

The constellation of the Great Bear is called by the East Greenland- 
ers pisilfllat, lamp foot or stool upon which the lamp is i)laced. 

The typical lamp is that whose form is the result of an attempt to 
devise a vessel with a long, nearly straight wick edge combined with a 
reservoir. This necessarily throws the vessel into the clam-shell shape 
or ellipsoidal shape. Lamps of this character appertain to the high 
and rigorous north, where the maximum of heat and light are required. 
No doubt, also, the lamp is modified by the abundance or scarcity of 
the food supply and the prevalence of driftwood. This form ranges 
from Labrador to Norton Sound, Alaska. The other general form of 
lamp, which is circular or ovate, having a narrow wick edge, ranges 
south from Norton Sound. They are circular and of baked clay on the 
tundra formed by the alluvial deposits of the Yukon and Kuskokwim 
river systems. They become oval and of stone in the metamorphic 
and igneous country to the southeast and southwest through the 
Alaskan Peninsula and Aleutian Chain. There is a connection of form 
suggested between the stone lamps spoken of and the stone vessels of 
the northwest coast of Alaska and British Columbia and the west coast 
of North America, but there is no connection by use. The Eskimo are 
unique in the Western Hemisphere in the possession of a lamp. 

The clay-saucer lamp of the Yukon tundra is interesting from the 
fact that it seems an intrusion. It may be true that the alluvial coun- 
try furnishes no stone, and hence clay is substituted, which will 
account for the material. The Eskimo will go a long distance, as has 
been pointed out, for material which he needs and has been accus- 
tomed to use. The lamps of St. Lawrence Island, though of pottery 
and aberrant in form, preserve the long wick line of the Arctic lamp. 
The shape of the Yukon type, the absence of a definite wick edge or lip, 
and the method of burning by a wick brought up at the side relate them 
to the lamps of eastern Asia, or the simple dish lamjis of diverse ages and 
peoples. Kennan speaks of a dish lamp with the wick floating in the 
oil in the house of the Koraks. The quotation may prove interesting: 
"The temperature of a Korak tent in winter seldom ranges above 20^ 
or 25° E., and as constant exposure to such a degree of cold would be

at least very disagreeable the Koraks construct around the inner cir- 
cumference of the tents small, nearly air-tight apartments, called 
'pologs,' which are separated one from another by skin curtaius and 
combine the advantages of cxclusiveness with the desirable luxury of 
greater warmth. These 'pologs' are about 4 feet in height and 6 or 
8 feet in width or length. They are made of the heaviest furs sewed 
carefully together to exclude the air, and are warmed and lighted by a 
burning fragment of moss floating in a wooden bowl of seal oil." ' 

The typical forms of Eskimo lamps are shown on i)late -54. Thrown 
together in this way they furnish at a view the 
gradation of forms throughout the whole Eskimo 
area. 

The range of the lamp southward from the 
Aleutian Islands is limited. The only informa- 
tion that a lamp of any description was in use 
among the Northwest Coast Indians was given 
the author by Captain Chase, who visited Cape 
Flattery and Vancouver Island in 1850. Captain 
Chase says that these Indians used a lami) made 
from the clam shell, and burned whale blubber 
or porpoise oil in them, with a bark wick. 

Dr. Franz Boas informs the writer that the 
Indians of Vancouver often throw oil on the fire 
from a bottle when they desire more light. Mr. 
Lucien M. Turner also states that when the 
Aleuts require more heat they place the bowlder 
lamp on the ground and lay a piece of cloth or 
shreds of grass in the oil and light it, getting a 
larger flame. 

The lamps of northern Europe and Asia, ex- 
amined with a view of ascertaining the aftilia- 
tions of the lamps of the Eskimo, give little data 
for conclusions. There were mediaeval stone- 
grease lamps in use in northern Europe above the oil line, so named 
by Dr. Taylor. The only exam^fle known by the writer is from Scot- 
land and was figured by D. Bruce Peebles.- This lamp (fig. 3) is curi- 
ously like those of the Alaskan Peninsula. In the present state of the 
inquiry it seems the Eskimo lamp forms a homogeneous group differing 
in administration from any other lamps in the world, the peculiar herit- 
age of this people and necessary to their welfare. 

The conclusions reached are that the Eskimo before he migrated from 
his priscanhome had the lamp, this utensil being a prerequisite to migra- 
tion into high latitude; that one of the most important functions of the 
lamp is for melting snow and ice for drinking water; that the lamp is

employed for lighting, warmiug, cooking, melting snow, drjang clothes, 
and in the arts, thus combining in itself several functions which have 
been differentiated among civilized peoples. 

That the architecture of the house is related to the use of the lamj). 
The house is made nonconducting and low in order to utilize the heated 
air. 

That the lamp is a social factor, peculiarly the sign of the family 
unit, each head of the family (the woman) having her lamp. 

That the invention of the lamp took place on some seacoast, where 
fat of aquatic mammals of high fuel value was abundant, rather than 
in the interior, where the fat of land animals is of low fuel value. 

That the typical form of the lamp arises from an attempt to devise a 
vessel with a straight wick edge combined with a reservoir giving the 
vessel an obovate or ellipsoidal shape. 

Finally, from observation of lamps from numerous localities around 
the Eskimo shore line, it is concluded that lami)S in low latitude, below 
the circle of illumination, are less specialized than those of higher lati- 
tudes. For instance, the lamps of southern Alaska have a wick edge 
of 2 inches, while those of Point Barrow and northern Greenland have 
a wick edge of from 17 to 36 inches in width. 

It becomes possible, then, to say with some certainty the degree of 
north latitude to which a lamp ai^pertains, light and temperature being 
the modifying causes. Driftwood, the fuel supply, and the presence or 
absence of material from which to construct the lamp must also be 
considered. The cause of the large lamp coming down so far in lati- 
tude on the east is on account of the dipping of the isotherms. The 
lamps of Labrador are the case in point. 

DISTRIBUTION AND FORMS OF THE ESKIMO LAMP. 

There are three kinds of Eskimo lamps with regard to use. They 
may be called the house lamp, the traveler's or summer lamp, and the 
mortuary lamp, the latter frequently being models. Lamps for melting 
snow may also be mentioned. 

The summer lamp is based on a number of specimens which are too 
large for models or toys, but are of convenient size for carrying on the 
person. They usually bear marks of use as a lamj). Capt. J. O. Spicer, 
of Groton, Connecticut, has presented a fine exami)le of this kind of 
lamp to the United States National Museum, and describes its use in 
the summer when the large house lamp is not necessary and the small 
lamp supplies light for the pipe. Travelers often carry such lamp for 
use on journeys. 

The larger regions embracing the localities from whence the lamps 
come which are described in this monograph are Labrador, Cumber- 
land Gulf, Greenland, Mackenzie Eiver, Point Barrow, Kotzebue Sound, 
St. Lawrence Island, Eastern Siberia, Norton Sound, the Yukon Delta

THE LAMPS or LABRADOR. 

The lumps of Labrador are invariably of soapstone, Avhich is secured 
by lonj^- J(mrneys into the interior. There are two types, one long and 
narrow, the other broader; the back is bowed, the ends truncated, the 
bottom deep, forming a ridge, the section an obtuse angle formed by the 
junction of two planes; the edges and ends are squared and the wick- 
edge is straight. 

iSome of the house lamps are very large. They are never balanced, 
depending upon supports for adjustment as to position. Smaller lamps 
for personal use are often balanced. 

The drying frames are semilunar, consisting usually of a bowed hoop 
joined at the ends to a bar and the intervening space netted or crossed 
with thongs, as in a tenuis racket. The frame takes this shape on 
account of its being supported by pegs driven into the wall of the 
circular house. 

The cooking pots are oblong and heavy, with flat bottom, the walls 
slanting inward. Grummets for the suspending cords are fastened 
through holes drilled at the corners. 

The Labrador lamps in the United States National Museum were all 
collected by Mr. L. M. Turner, who visited the country in 1883-84. His 
account, edited by Mr. John Murdoch, nmy be found in the eleventh 
annual report of the Bureau of Ethnology, where excellent figures may 
be examined in connection with this monograph.

ratoly balanced on a very .small rounded base area, standing, wbeu placed on a 
plane surface, in position lor burning with a reservoir full of oil. Hence a stand 
for this lamp is not necessary. This adjustment of the center of gravity has 
been observed in a number of Eskimo lamps. Length, 17^ inches; width, 7| 
inches ; height at back, 4 inches ; front, 3f inches. Eskimo of Ungava, Labrador.

Stone LAMP, /ro-^/i HA-. Large lamp of soapstone ; cresceutic outline with truncated 
horns. The l)ottom takes the form of the reservoir, which slopes sharply down 
from the straight wick edge to the lowest point and then at a low slant to the 
curved back, not exhibiting the sharp angle demarking the two planes shown in 
the small lamps. The wick edge curves very slightly. Around the back and ends 
a squared edge is worked out. This lamp, which may be taken as the type, 
must, of necessity, be set in a support of such figure as to incline ib forward in 
order to supplj' oil to the wick. This is done by placing the lamp on an exca- 
vated block of wood or notched sticks. No attempt has been made to smoothly 
finish this lamp. Length, 20| inches; width, 9^ inches ; height, 4 inches. Eskimo 
of Ungava, Labrador, Collected by L. M. Turner. 90251. Plate 1, figs. 4, 5. 

Cooking pot. Large, heavy, oblong vessel of soapstone, rather crudely made. The 
slanting walls are thick and bulged; the bottom is fiat. At each of the upper 
corners blind holes are drilled to meet each other in the thicker walls of the end 
of the pot, forming- an eyelet for the thongs used in suspension of the vessel. 
Length, 13 inches; width, 8J inches; height, 4f inches. Eskimo of Ungava, 
Labrador. Collected by L. M. Turner. 90257. Plate 1, fig. 2. 

Cooking pot. Oblong pot, skillfully made of soapstone. The sides are thick, 
slightly convex, and slant toward the opening; the bottom is flat. At each of 
the four upper corners a slanting hole is drilled, coming through on the side. 
Whalebone strips for suspending the pot are passed through the holes and a 
knot made in the end to secure it. Length, Hi inches; breadth, 5^ inches; 
height, 4 inches. Eskimo of Ungava, Labrador. Collected by L. M. Turnei".

Model of drying frames. The drying frame (90235, Plate 1, fig. 2) consists of a 
strip of dressed pine wood bent into semilunar shape and mortised at the ends 
into a cross bar. The interspace is crossed with horizontal and vertical strips 
of rawhide passing through holes in the frame. The support upon Avhich the 
drying frame rests is formed of two sharpened stakes lashed together at right 
angles at the larger ends. This su])port is fixed in the wall of the snow house. 
The frame, 90236 not figured, is made of a round stick bent into semilunar shape 
and crossed with netting of string. Length, 7^ inches; width, 4^ inches.

The lamp supports shown in the lower figures on plate 1 are copies of 
specimens in the Toronto University Museum, from East Maine, Lab- 
rador. They consist of two notched sticks, wedge-shaped at the lower 
ends for driving into the ground, or of four sticks cut diagonally at the 
top so placed as to form an equivalent to the notch. 

The support in fig. 2 on plate 1 is of wood, hollowed out to receive 
the lamp. 

THE LAMPS OF CUMBERLAND GULF. 

There is a close resemblance between the lamps of Cumberland (hilf 
and those of Labrador. The former, however, are narrower and more 
pointed, the outline viewed from above being elliptic. The material is 
usually soapstone and the workmanship is excellent. Some of the 
house lamps are quite large, having a wick edge nearly 2 feet long.

Lamps of Cumberland Gulf. 



THE LAMP OF THE ESKIMO. 1043 

Upon the authority of Capt. J. O. Spicer, of Grotoii, the chiss of sum- 
mer lauips for this locality has been designated. These are suuill 
lamps for summer use to furnish light for the ])ipe and to start tires. 
The small lamp figured ou plate 2, fig. 2, is interesting. It may be com- 
pared with the Greenland specimen on plate 7. 

The cooking pots are like those of Labrador, No drying- frame exists 
iu the United States National Museum from Cumberland Gulf. 

DUAWIXG IX TENCIL. Liimp, pot, disli, woman's knife for cutting fat, wick trimmer, 
and a filament of sphagnum moss for tlio wide; drawn by an Eskimo of Cum- 
berland Gulf. Collected by L. Kumloin. This drawing is very interesting, as 
showing adjuncts to the lamp, which usually escape the collector. There is, for 
instance, no wick-trimmer iu the large lamp collection of the United States 
National Museum and the use of the knife and fat scraper in the care of the 
lamp was not known until it was noticed by Professor Mason in his paper on 
"Skin dressing." See Plate 2, fig. 1. 

Small stone lamp, with pocket. Excavated from soapstone, crescentic iu outline. 
It is balanced on ai rounded base, tipping with ease from front to back, but not 
from side to side. The reservoir is deep, and at the rear a pocket is foruied, 
demarked by a curving wall. The, wick edge slants rather sharply down to the 
floor of the reservoir. The intent of the pocket at the rear is not known ; in 
this specimen it forms a convenient place for insertion of the thumb in remov- 
ing or carrying the lamp. The specimen is very neatly finished. In the pop- 
ular account of Dr. Kane's explorations a lamji of this variety is figured. 
Length, 3| inches; width, 1|- inches; lieight, J inch. Eskimo, Cumberland Gulf, 
Canada. Collected by Lieut. W. A. :\Iintzer, U. S. N. 29968. Plate 2, fig. 2. 

SUMMEK LAMP. Of soapstoue, semilunar in outline. The shape of the reservoir is 
triangular, being formed by the meeting of the iilanes of the back and wick edge 
at the middle like those of Ungava Bay, Labrador. The bottom is rounded as 
are all edges. The balance of the lamp is remarkable, the center of gravity 
causing it to assume the position rerxuired for supplying oil to the wick, although 
resting upon a small, rounded base when moved. Laterallj^ the lamp is stable, 
antero-posteriorly it moves freely for tipping. The balance is intentional, and 
this feature is found in several other localities. The. name summer lamp denotes 
its use iu summer, when the large house lamp is not necessary and the small 
lamp supplies light for the pipe, etc. Length, 71, inches; width, 3,\' inches; 
height at back, 3^ inches; at front, f inch. Eskimo, Cumberland Gulf, Canada. 
Collected by Capt. J. O. Spicer. 168994. Plate 3, fig. 1. 

Stonk LAMP. Roughly hollowed out from ampbibolito, elliptic in shape with 
rounded ends. The bottom follows the curves of the reservoir, which shows a 
nu^dian groove formed by the junction of the planes of the wick portion and 
rear portion of the lamp. The lamp is not self balancing and hence must have 
a support. The wick edge is considerably curved. Length, 20 inches; width, 
!) inches; height, when level, 3^ inches. Eskimo, Cumberland Gulf, Canada. 
Collected by Lieut. W. A. Mintzer, U. S. N. 29964. Plate 3, fig. 2. 

Stone lamp. Large, elliptic lamp, neatly excavated Irom soapstone. It is very 
deeply hollowed out, the wick edge nearly straight and smoothly worked. Not 
being balanced, the lamp requires support. At the cuds of the lamp below are 
slight projections, probably for the reception of forked supports like those iu 
use at East Maine. This fine lamp has seen long service, being saturated and 
glazed with oil. Length, 23 inches; width, 8} inches; height when level, 5 
inches. Eskimo, Cumberland Gulf, Canada. Collected by Lieut. W. A. Mintzer, 
U. S. N. 29965. Plate 3, fig. 3. 

Lamp. Semilunar lamp of soapstone; reservoir deep, walls abrupt, bottom nearly 
Hat. The wick edge has a gentle curve. The back of the lamp, which rose 



1044 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

higher than the wick edge, has been broken away, and tlie specimen shows 
marks of long usage. The bottom is flat and irregular. From the height of the 
wick edge the lamp must have required to be strongly tipped toward the front 
when in use. Length, 12J inches; width G inches; height, 1| inches. Eskimo, 
Cumberland Gulf, Canada. Collected by Lieut. W. A. Mintzer, U. S. N. 29966. 

Small lamp. Made of soapstone, crescentic in outline, with truncated horns. The 
reservoir is neatly hollowed out, the rear wall forming a low rim. The lip or 
wick edge slants rather abruptly to meet the plane of the floor, forming an angle 
near the front of the lamp (see section) as in the lamps of Labrador. The bot- 
tom of the lamp is rounded, and has irregular cavities due to foreign substances 
in the soapstone. This lamp, from its small size, is probably one used by travelers 
or in summer. It is not balanced, and hence requires a rest or foot. Length, 
7i inches; width, 4 inches; height, 1^ inches. Eskimo, Cumberland Gulf, Can- 
ada. Collected by Lieutenant Mintzer, U. S. N. 29967. Plate 3, fig. 4. 

SoAPsTONK POT. Oblong in shape, cut out of soapstone. It is pierced at the cor- 
ners for suspension. The bottom is flat; the sides incline inward, thus making 
the opening smaller at the top. This cooking pot in every respect resembles 
those collected by Mr. L. M. Turner in Labrador. The specimen has been broken 
and mended with cement and sinew by the natives. Length, 12i inches; width, 
7 inches; height, SJ inches. Eskimo, Mantilik, Cumberland Gulf, Canada. 
Collected by Lieut. W. A. Mintzer, U. S. N. 29969. Plate 3, fig. 5.

whalebone strips. Eskimo, Cumberland Gulf, Canada. Collected by Lieut. W. 
A. Mintzer, U. S. N. 

THE LAMPS OF GREENLAND. 

The lamps of Greenland are made of soapstone and other harder 
rocks. They are usually elliptic in outline or having the outline of the 
gibbous moon. The bottom is nearly always flat or sligiitly curved, 
as they are placed on stools; sometimes, however, they are set up on 
pegs. There is little relation in form between the Greenland lamps 
and those of Labrador or Cumberland Gulf (Baffin Land). The rela- 
tion is rather between Greenland both east and west and northwestern 
Alaska. The type of shell-shaped lamps of North Greenland, shown 
on plate 7, have the same relationship and pass over to Eastern Siberia 
by way of Saint Lawrence Island. (See plates 4 to 9.) 

The cooking pot has walls inclining outward, in reverse to those of 
the south. Perhaps the finest specimen of soapstone work of the kind 
in existence is the cooking pot brought from Smith Sound by Dr. 
Hayes. (See plate 9, fig. 3.) 

The drying frame of East Greenland is hung over the lamp, as is the 
frame used in a tent at Inglefield Gulf (Smith Sound). (See plate 9, fig. 
1.) In other localities the frame is placed on pegs driven in the wall 
over the bench upon which the lamp is installed. Wick trimmers are 
often a stick of asbestos or jwiuted piece of soapstone. In East Green- 
land it is a chisel-shaped jnece of iron mounted in a wooden handle. 
A number of mortuary lamj)s have been found in South and East 
Greenland. 

The view of the interior of an Eskimo snow house in Greenland is 
interesting, as showing the method of setting ui> the all-essential lamj)

witli its accessories. It also emphasizes the strait caused by the almost 
total lack of wood, bones, antlers, etc., being emjiloyed. instead, A 
snowshoe apparently is made to do duty as a drying frame. Atten- 
tion is called to the drip catcher under the lamp, and the fat suspended 
by a thong over the heat of the tiame. (See plate 4.) 

Lamp. Of soapstone; very large and worked out very neatly, the result being a 
lamji of elegant shape. The bottom is Hat aud the sides nearly vortical. The 
reservoir is nearly flat and slopes gradually np to the wick edge, while the rear 
wall is high. The wick edge curves more than is usual in Eskimo lamps. The 
lamp has been broken and repaired neatly with sinew aud cement. Length, 26^ 
inches; width, I'iik inches; height at front, 2^ inches; at back, 3^ inches. 
Eskimo, Repulse Bay. Collected by Capt. C. F. Hall. 10439. Plate 5, flg. 1. 

Stone lamp. Excavated from soapstone, the wick edge slightly curved, the back 
bowed, forming a shell-shaped dish. The lamp seems to show traces of having 
been worked with stone tools. The rear wall is nearly vertical ; the reservoir 
neatly hollowed out, being deepest in the middle, gently sloping np to the lip 
and to the rear. A shallow groove has been cut along the inner margin of the 
lip, for convenience in installing the wick. The stone is worked thin and resem- 
bles pottery. The lamp is probably one used in summer or in traveling. It is 
wider than the Cumberland Gulf type. Length, 7 inches; width, 4^ inches; 
height, I inch. Eskimo, Smith Sound. Collected by Dr. I, I. Hayes. 176064. 
Plate 5, fig. 2. 

Lamp. Of hard stone, smoothly worked out, the corners and edges rounded. The 
wick edge is curved at the ends; the intervening portion nearly straight. The 
bottom is rounded and the lamp inclines toward the wick edge. In outline it 
has the shape of the gibbous uioon. This specimen seems to have been taken from 
an old village site. Length, 8^ inches ; width, 5i inches ; heiglit at rear, 2| 
inches; at front, 2^ inches. South Greenland. From the Royal Museum of 
Northern Antiquities, Copenhagen. 45845. Plate 5, fig. 3. 

Small stone lamp. Cut from soapstone; roughly elliptic in outline; the bottom 
flat, heavily scored by the cutting implement. The sides slant iipward and out- 
ward; the reservoir is deep, the bottom flat, the walls slanting outward. The 
wick edge is strongly curved, hence the wide seems to have been supplied with 
oil, only at the middle portion. This is probably a summer or traveliuglanip from 
South Greenland. Length, 6 inches : width, 3 J inches ; height at front, li inches ; 
at rear, 2 inches. Eskimo, South Greenland. From the Royal Museum of

Stonp; lamp. Rudely excavated from sandstone, probably from a concretion. The 
edges are broken and worn down, the bottom is rounded but the lamp balances. 
In general shape it follows the South Greenland type, the character aud hard- 
ness of the material and its evident age have modified its appearance. Length,

in a slanting position and readily tips forward. The walls are thin, the reser- 
voir deeply hollowed out and crossed near the front third by a high Itridge 
pierced near the middle at the floor of the reservoir. The large cavity at the 
rear of the lamp cut oti by the bridge is for the reception of blubber to be 
melted by the heat of the lamp, and the oil supply to the wick passes through 
the orifice in the bridge. Length, 8J inches; width (front to back), 7f inches,

Lamp. Large lamp made from coarse cystalliue rock, triangular in outline, the 
bottom flat, the sides rounded, the back much higher than the wick edge. The 
reservoir is flat and is crossed by a bridge, which breaks down at the ends, 
allowing the passage of the oil to the wick. The wick edge is curved and is 
rough from age and use. This lamp is evidently very (dd. It was probably 
taken from a village site in a high latitude as it resembles closely the lamp 
found by General Greely in latitude 82 degrees north. (See Plate 7, fig. 3.)

Lamp. Of soapstone, ovate in outline; reservoir slants regularly from wick edge to 
the bottom of low back wall ; the convex wick edge has a ridge running around 
it between the outer edge and the reservoir, forming a groove in whicii the wick 
was installed. The lamp rests irpon a flat bottom and stands level, the rim of 
the back wall being of the same height as the wick edge. Length, 8 inches;

THE LAMPS OF THE MACKENZIE RIVER. 

The two lamps in the United States National Museum from the Mac- 
kenzie Kiver were collected many years ago by Robert MacFarlane. 
They are small and have a divided bridge, relating them to the lamps 
of St. Lawrence Island and eastern Siberia. No information whatever 
is available relating to the use of the lamp by the Mackenzie River 
Eskimo. 

WiNTEiJ TRAVELING LAMP. Of soapstoue, cresceutic in shape, bottom nearly fiat, 
sides vertical. The reservoir is shallow and is divided into two portions by a 
bridge. The bridge is divided into two portions by a canal cut across the mid- 
dle, and the wall of the reservoir is continued around the ends, forming a narrow 
canal at the end of the bridge. The wick edge is slightly curved, as is the rule 
in all Eskimo lamjjs. This small lamp, which is called "a winter traveling 
lamp," is useful only for giving a temporary light, and was probably carried in 
the interest of the smokers. Length, 5 inches; width, 2^ inches; height at 
front, V inch; at back, finch. Eskimo, Mackenzie River, Canada. Collected by

The lamps from Point Barrow in tbe United States National Museum 
have been ably described by Mr. John Murdoch ' in his paper on the 
" Ray Collection." It is only necessary, therefore, to point out the rela- 
tion of the Point Barrow type lamp to those of Smith Sound. The 
cooking pot is also like that of the same locality in Greenland. 

No drying frames were procured from Point Barrow or are mentioned 
in Mr. Murdoch's paper. It is quite likely that the drying frame exists 
at Point Barrow. In fact, Captain Herendeen assures the writer that 
they are used there. 

There is a lamp of pottery in the Nathan Joseph collection, Golden 
Gate Park Museum, San Francisco, from Alaska, which from its form 
appertains to Point Barrow, where pottery was formerly made. 

Lamt. This lamp is elliptic in outline and is very well worked from soapstone. 
The reservoir is deep, and at the rear is a semilunar terrace standing three- 
fourths inch above the floor with slanting side. The rear wall of the reservoir 
is nearly vertical, while the wick side slopes down to the floor of the lamp. 
The bottom of the lamp is flat aud the sides incline inward. The wick lino has 
a curve of about 2 feet radius. The lamp has been broken and mended with 
sinew and cement. The resemblance of this lamp to those of Greenland 
(Bessels) is striking. The terrace may, however, correspond to the cavity in a 
similar position in the Cumberland Gulf lamp (see Plate 11, fig. 2) and for a 
similar use, the placing of unmelted blubber. Length, 17 inches; width, 8 
inches; height, 2J inches. Eskimo, Point B.arrow, Alaska. Collected by Lieut. 
P. H. Ray, U. S. A. 89879. Plate 11, fig. 1. 

Lamp. Large semilunar lamp of siliceous sandstone. It is roughly worked out, 
but is quite a feat to do so well with this material. The cavity is rather deep, 
and its floor is high at the back and slopes to the middle line, where it meets the 
sIop(! from the wick edge. The latter is straight. The bottom and corners 
rounded. The lamp slopes toward the wick edge, as the section shows. Length, 
12| inches; width, 8 inches; height in front, 2| inches; at back, 3 inches. 
Eskimo, Point Barrow, Alaska. Collected by Lieut. P. H, Ray, U. S. A. 89880. 

Lamp. Shallow, rude semilunar lamp of siliceous rock of small size. It was prob- 
ably worked from a slab of stone, and must be tipped forward when in use. 
The reservoir is shallow and bowed — that is, formed by two slanting planes 
which meet at a middle line corresponding to the terrace in the rear of the type 
lamp. This lamp is a rude approximation to the better formed lamps of soap- 
stone. It has, however, seen service. Length, 8i inches; width, 4^ inches; 
height, If inches. Eskimo, Point Barrow, Alaska. Collected by Lieut. P. H. 
Ray, U. S. A. 89881. 

Traveling lamp. Small lamp of soapstone of somewhat irregular semilunar outline, 
owing to the shape of the original piece of stone. The reservoir is shallow and 
flat, the wick edge slanting down to the bottom. The wick edge is convex 
in outline. The lamp must be tipped forward to supply oil to the wick. This 
is one of the small lamps for special use. Length, 8^ inches; width, 4jr inches; 
height, I inch. Eskimo, Point Barrow, Alaska. Collected by Lieut. P. H. Ray, 
U. S. A. 56673. Plate 11, fig. 2.

THE LAMP OF THE ESKIMO. 1049 

Lamp. Rude lamp of soapstone, wliicli owes its irregular shape to the original piece 
of stoue from which it was excavated. Length, 6f inches; width, SMnches; 
height, li inches. Eskimo, Point Barrow, Alaska. Collected by Lieut. P. H.

THE LAMPS OF KOTZEBUE SOUND. 

The description of the lamps from Kotzebue Sound must he based 
upon two small specimens in tlie United States National Museum. 
These lamps have the shape of a clam shell, having the length and 
width nearly equal, exactly so in one specimen. A lamp from the 
Nathan Joseph collection in the (lolden Gate Park Museum in San 
Francisco is of this type, and is undoubtedly from the Kotzebue region. 
(See plate 12, fig. 3.) The length is lOf inches and the width, 9^ inches. 
The material is clay slate.' One of the lamps in the Field Columbian 
Museum is made of wood." 

TRAyp:LiNG LAMP. Of soapstone; ovate triangular in outline, all corners being 
rounded for comfort in carrying. Bottom and lloor of reservoir Hat. Lamp does 
not incline. Walls of side slanting to reservoir lloor. Wick edge bowed more 
than usual. Length, Q^ inches; width, 5 inches; height, It' inches. Hotham 
Inlet, Kotzebue Sound, Alaska. Collected by E. W. Nelson. 64223. Plate 12, 
fig. 1. 

Lamp. Small model in soapstone of the typical semilunar shajie of the Eskimo lamp 
from Greenland to Norton Bay. Length, lij inches; width, 2^ inches; height, 
i inch. Eskimo, Cai)e Darby, Norton Bay, Alaska. Collected by E. W. Nelson. 
48138. Plate 12, lig. 2. 

THE LAMPS OF NORTON SOUND. 

The lamps from the northern shore of Norton Sound are of the Kot- 
zebue ty])e, flat and with the outline of the clam shell. 

The lam]) from St. Michaels on the south shore seems to anticipate the 
sadiron lamp of the Alaskan Peninsula. It must be borne in mind 
that St. Michaels is the great emporium of this region, and si)ecimens 
drift in there from many different localities. 

Lamp. Shallow lamp of sandstone of the shape of the small lamp 44338, well made 
and evidently having seen long service. The wick edge is nearly straight; the 
corners rounded by use. This lamp is the Kotzebue type, which is extremely 
simple. Length of wick edge, 8 inches; width, 6i inches; heighth, 1^ inches. 
Eskimo, Norton Sound, Alaska. Collected by E. W. Nelson. 49110. Plate 
13, fig. 1. 

Small lamp. Small semilunar lamp, excavated from soapstone, with slanting walls 
and slightly curved bottom. The lamp is very shallow and the wick edge 
straight. It was probably used by hunters or travelers in the summer. Length, 
3i inches; width, 4| inches; height, i inch. Eskimo, Norton Sound, Alaska. 
Collected by E. W. Nelson. 44338. Plate 13, fig. 2. 

' Outlines and sections of all the lamps in the San Francisco Museum were furnished 
through the kindness of the curator, Charles P. Wilcomb. 

-Several Kotzebue lamps are in the Field Columbian Museum at Chicago. One of 
these, a small oval lamp with divided bridge is interesting in relation to the distri- 
bution of this feature. Through the kindness of Dr. George A. Dorsey a jihotograph 
of these lamps was secured which unfortunately came too late for insertion in this 
work. 



1050 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

Stonk i,AMr. Worked from tufiiceons rock; very mncb disintegrated. Sluipe that 
of a sadiron ; bottom flat, rounding toward vertical sides. The reservoir is 
oval and shallow; the sides rise to uniform height all around it. The point 
where the wick has been laid is not sjiecially worked for the purpose. This 
lamp bears no resemblance to those collected by E. W. Nelson in Norton Sound. 
In general a|)pearance it more nearly resembles some varieties of the Kodiak 
lamp, and the narrow lip increases the resemblance. There are two lamps in 
the United States National Museum from the peninsula lying between Norton 
and Kotzebue sounds for comparison, which show that its alitiliations are with 
those of Kodiak and the Alaskan Peninsula. Length, 11| inches; greatest width, 
6^ inches; height, 2 inches. Eskimo, St. Michaels, Norton Sound, Alaska. 
Collected by L. M. Turner. 30761. I'late 13, lig. 3. 

Small lamp. Formed of concretion of gray, shaly rock, of natural shape, not 
worked in any way. It is oval in shape and on one side there is evidence of the 
charring of the wick. This lamp was probably carried by hunters. Length, 
3i inches; width, 2.^ inches; height, f inch. Eskimo, St. Michaels, Norton 
Sound, Alaska. Collected by E. W. Nelson. 43470. Plate 13, fig. 4. 

THE LAMPS OF ST. LAWRENCE ISLAND. 

These lamps are of pottery, skillfully made a.ii{l baked. The lamps 
with two wick edges are unique, and altogether the utensil in this local- 
ity and has assumed several curious forms. The bridged lamp of North 
Greenland is here repeated, but with various modifications, and are 
connected with Asia by the Siberian example. (See plate 17.) 

The pottery lamp rests and drip catchers are uni(]ue. One of the 
rests in the collection is a whale's vertebra, with the spinous processes 
hacked off. 

The drying frame does not exist. Its place is taken by pegs driven 
in the earth walls of the house. 

The shape of the St. Lawrence Island lamp seems to have followed 
that of the wooden platters. 

Earthenware lamp. Made of clay, mixed with angular rock fragnaents, strong 
and well burnt. In shape it is the most divergent lamp in the collection. 
Viewed from above its outline is oblate, having a square projection from one 
side separated from the main reservoir by a low ridge. This lamp inclines 
slightly toward the wick edge. The wick edge curves gently, while in front of 
it is a low bridge with ends slanting down to the floor of the lamp, allowing a 
narrow space for the oil to flow around to the wick. The purpose of the rear 
projection and cavity is conjectural. It would seem very convenient for grasp- 
ing the lighted lamp if it were desired to carry it. This lamp could be carried 
lighted, as the bridge would prevent the wash of the oil against the wick. This 
ma^'^ be one of the functions of the bridge. This lamp is sujiplied with a wooden 
dish in which it rests. Width, of inches; length, 6^ inches; height at rear, 1,",; 
inches; at front. If inches. Eskimo, St. Lawrence Island, Alaska. Collected by 
E. W. Nelson. 63543. Plate 14, figs. 1, 2, and 3. 

Lamp. Pottery lamp, oblong, with rounded corners. Slanting bridges on either 
side springing from angle formed by side and floor. These bridges arc divided 
by a central cleft into two equal portions. Length, 11 inches ; width, 9i inches; 
height, 2^ inches. Eskimo, St. Lawrence Island, Alaska. Collected by E. W. 
Nelson. 63570. Plate 15, fig, 1.

Double lamp. Made of clay with large ailmixtnie of ([uartz fragments, strongly 
burnt and completely soaked with oil. In shape it is a large oblong platter 
having concave side with a step at either end above the bottom of the reservoir. 
At either side the step is raised into crescentic ridges, each jiierced with two 
holes slanting down to the reservoir with the angle of the sides. Through 
these orifices the wick is fed. The wick is laid along the edge of either side of 
the lamp. This is the only example of a double Eskimo lamp, and from its 
capacity it must have been used where oil was plenty. The lamp bears a like- 
ness to the wooden dishes of this region. Length, 15^ inches; width, 12;^: 
inches: height, 2^ inches Eskimo, St. Lawrence Island, Bering Strait, Alaska. 
Collected by E. W. Nelson. 49196. Plate 15, fig. 3. 

Laaip. This lamp is made of clay burning yellow, with coarse temper of subangu- 
lar quartz fragments. It is oblong, with truncated corners resembling in shape 
the wooden dishes of the Norton Sound region, and is rather deep. The clay was 
prol)ab]y formed in a wooden dish. The upper edge is flat, except on the side 
where the wick is placed, which is rounded oft". At 2 inches from the lip and 
j)arallel with it there is a bridge i^: inches long, standing 1^ inches above the 
bottom of the lamp at the rear and five-eighths of an inch in relief in front of 
the lip, thus forming a shelf. The ol'tice of the bridge may be to prevent parti- 
cles of moss falling into the oil, to prevent floating masses i>f unmelted blubber 
from interfering with the wick, or it may bo used as a secondary wick surface 
when the oil is low. The deposits on the ridge seems to point to the latter use. 
By the flattening of the base the lamp leans forward toward the wick edge at a 
low angle, as is observed in the Chnkchis lamp (Plate 17, fig. 1) and in common 
Avith the latter it possesses a ridge. This lamp is set on a vessel which com- 
bines tiie functions of rest and drip catcher. Length, 8jr inches; width, 6| 
inches; height, at rear, 2| inches; at front, 2 inches. Eskimo, St. Lawrence 
Island, Alaska. Collected by E. W. Nelson. 63544. Plate 15, fig. 4. 

OiJLONG COOKING POT. Made of coarse earthernwaro. At the upper corners the 
clay has been pinched up and pierced for the attachment of cords for suspending 
the pot. The vessel is rudely made and is much Idackened with lamp smoke. 
Length, 6 inches; width, 4| inches; height, 2^ inches. Eskimo, St. Lawrence 
Island, Alaska. Collected by E. W. Nelson. 63546. Plate 16, fig. 1. 

Ohlong COOKING POT. Small oblong pot of coarse pottery, blackened and covered 
on the bottom with deposit from the lamp. Each corner is pierced with two 
orifices through which pass whalebone strips for suspending the pot. The vessel 
would seem too small for cooking food, but it has evidently been used over the 
lamp. Length, If inches; width, 3^ inches; height, If inches. Eskimo, St. 
Lawrence Island, Alaska. Collected by E. W. Nelson. 63548. Plate 16, fig. 2.

Dhip catcher. Long, narrow, shallow vessel of coarse burnt clay, rounded at the 
ends and slightly curved. This vessel is catalogued as a lamp. Its edges are 
not found for the wick, which is an infallible test for a lamp. It was probably 
placed under the lip of a lamii to catch dropping oil. Length, 8i inches ; width, 2|

1052 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896. 

THE LAMPS OF EASTERN SIBERIA. 

A full account of the Cliukchis lamps of eastern Siberia is given by 
Baron Nordensliiold in liis "Voyage of the Vegay The method of 
installation is shown on plate 17, fig. 2, taken from that work. 

The connection with Asia is one of a number which have been noticed 
recently. 

Lamp. Excavated from soapstone, apparently with stone tools. The oriiijinal 
surface of the stone shows in one place on the exterior. It is roughly hemi- 
spherical. When resting on the rounded and insecure base the rim of the lamp 
slants at an angle of about 37 degrees, the walls of the cavity being high at the 
rear, running down and merging into the wick edge. The floor rises from the 
middle toward the back and front. The bridge is divided into two equal sec- 
tions by a V-shaped cut in the middle, the oil thus flowing to the wick through 
three channels. The wick edge is slightly curving and wider than the back of 
the lamp. Width, 6 J inches at wick edge; length to rear, 6 inches; height at 
rear, 4| inches; front, li inches. Chukchis, eastern Siberia. Collected by E. 
W. Nelson. 64222. Plate 17, fig. 1. 

THE LAMPS OF BRISTOL BAY. 

South of Norton Sound the lamp becomes a shallow saucer of baked 
clay, rarely of stone, without wick edge, so that in absence of knowledge 
of their use they never would be classed as lamps. As has been men- 
tioned, they are affiliated with Asiatic saucer lamps. 

The number of specimens in the United States ISTational Museum from 
the north shore of Bristol Bay has given this type its name. Perhaps 
a more descriptive name would be lamp of the Yukon-Kuskokwim 
tundra. 

These lamias are set up on a stake, having the top hollowed out to 
receive the bulging bottom of the lamp. The wick is laid along a small 
space on the edge, following the Kadiak method. It is not known 
whether this lamp is ever furnished with a single solid wick or burned 
with a floating wick. The former supposition seems to be borne out by 
the model from Nushagak (fig. 1). 

The cooking pot of this region is circular, and designed for placing on 
an open fire, as driftwood is plentiful. 

In the southern portion of this region an admixture of forms takes 
place. The lamps are of stone, circular, but in nearly every case have 
the wick edge worked out. A similar mixture of form occurs between 
Kadiak, the Alaskan Peninsula, and Aleutian Chain. Four of these 
lamps are shown on plate 20. 

Lamp. This is the smallest lamp among the series of pottery lamps in the Ignited 
States National Museum. It apparently has been little used, probably for some 
special purpose or as a toy. Eskimo, Cape Vancouver, Alaska. Collected by J. 
H. Turner. 153703. Plate 18, fig. 1.

Lamp. This lamp is of hard crystalline rock. It has been worked apjiarently from 
a l)eaih pebble by pecking. The lower portion is rounded without flattened 
portion for a base of support; the lani]), however, is stable and has a slight 
inclination toward the wick edge ; around the side a wide groove has been worked, 
making a decided rim. The reser\oir is shallow and perfectly oval in outline with 
a flat edge, which has been worked down at one aiiex of the oval to form a narrow 
lip for the wick. The reservoir and edge have been rubbed smooth. The lamp is

THE LAMPS OF KADIAK. 

There is a full series of lamps 'from Kadiak in the United States 
National Museum. They are of hard dioritic rock and are usually care- 
fully worked and finished. It would be difficult to mention better 
specimens of stone working. Some of the himps are very large, one in 
the collection weighing 67 liounds. They are oval in outline, with a 
shallow reservoir, low walls with flat top, the sides are often grooved, 
the bottom convex. The wick edge is a small groove cut through the 
wall at the apex of the oval leading to it. 

There is no information concerning the installation of these lamps, 
the specimens, like those of the Aleuts, having been taken from old 
village sites. 

An oval lamp of the type exists in the collection of the Alaska Com- 
mercial Company, Golden Gate Park Museum at San Francisco, Califor- 
nia. It is curious, having the channel for the wick deeper than the 
bottom of the lamp and two conical j)rojections rising from the floor of 
the reservoir near the back of the lamp. The material is diorite. 

Lamp. Cut out of greenish diorite; upper surface polished; bottom showing ham- 
mer marks. The lamp is of sad-iron shape, the shallow reservoir surrounded by 
a broad flat rim. The edge of the lamp below the rim has been rubbed into a 
groove. The bottom is rounded, but the lamp is stable on its base. The wick 
lip is narrow. Length from front to back, 11| inches; width, 8 inches; height 
4 inches. Eskimo, Kadiak Island, Alaska. Collected by Commander L. A. 
Beardslee, U. S. N. 42321. Plate 21, fig. 1. 

Lamp. Of hard, gray rock, originally perhaps a beach bowlder; bottom rounded, 
edge flat, cavity well worked out. A small lip has been cut into the edge at 
the apex of the oval, where there is an accunuilatiou of charred wick. The 
cavity of the lauip has been employed for grinding red paint. Measurements, 
6 by 8 by 3;^ iuches. Eskimo, Karluk, Kadiak Island, Alaska. Collected by 
W.J.Fisher. 74724. Plato 21, fig. 2. 

Lamp. This lamp is of metamorphic or volcanic rock. It is oval in outline, the 
sides straight and the bottom curved. The reservoir is neatly hollowed out 
and polished; the wick space or lip a shallow trough cut through the edge at 
the apex of the oval. When placed on its base, the lamp inclines strongly 
toward the lip. Length, 4Hnche8; width, 3i inches; height in front, 1^ inches; 
at rear, 2i inches. Eskimo, Kadiak Island, Alaska. Collected by Dr. Tarleton H. 
Bean. 131237. Plato 21, fig. 3. 

Lamp. Small oval lamp of hard rock (basalt), with rounded sides and flat bottom, 
the latter showing the fractured surface. The cavity is elliptic; the lip is 
worked at one end and shows traces of charred moss. Tiiis lamp was taken 
from an ancient dwelling and is probably a convenient pocket lamp used in 
traveling. Length, 3 inches; width, 2^ iuches; height, 1 inch. Eskimo, St. 
Paul, Kadiak Island, Alaska. Collected by W. J. Fisher. 90483. Plate 21, fig. 4. 

Lamp. Lamp of greenish-gray rock, finely worked and polished. It is oval in 
shape, broader at the back than at the front, with aluuist flat, slightly rounded 
bottom, upon which it firmly rests. The reservoir shallow, the upper edge wide 
and flat. The lip is worked in the edge at the apex of the oval, slanting down

THE LAMPS OF THE ALEUTIAN ISLANDS. 

The most primitive lamps on earth are those of the ancient Aleuts. 
Many of them are merely unmoditied rock fragments, and by far the 
larger number which have been adapted show little modification. Very 
rarely a completely worked lamp is found. These lamps were, with few 
exceptions, collected by Mr. W. H. Ball from prehistoric village sites. 

There is quite a number of small lamps in the collection from these 
islands. Mr. Ball informs the writer that the Aleuts used small 
lamps to take to sea in the fishing boats. As the men get chilled on 
these trips, the little lamps are useful to warm the hands or body. In 
the latter case they till the lamp from the oil bottle, place it in the lap 
under the gut coat, light it, and let it burn awhile. These lamps are 
often put to the same use in the house when the weather is cold. 

The Aleuts always built the fire outside of the house, as the climate 
is mild. They are also said by early explorers to have done little cook- 
ing. 

Lamp Suban-nlar, water-worn beach stone, elliptic in shape, having a natural 
cavity on the upper snrlace forming the lamp reservoir. Crusts of charred moss 
still adhere to the lamp near the lip where the wick was laid, and the lamp 
shows evidence of long and constant usag<^. The specimen was taken from a 
mound Length, 9 inches; width, fij luches. Aleuts, Illiuliuk, Unalashka 
Island, Alaska. Collected by VV. H. Dali. 14894. Plate 22, fig. 1.

Lamp. Natural shell of volcanic rock, which, from its shape, has been found suita- 
ble for a lamp. Length, 5i inches; width, 4| inches. Aleuts, Bay of Islands, 
Alaska. Collected by W. H. Ball. 13017. Plate 22, fig. 2. 

Lamp. Made from volcanic breccia; nearly circular in outline. The reservoir is 
shallow; the front portion has been broken away. Length, .5| inches; width, 
4| inches; height, 2^ inches. Aleuts, Constantine Harbor, Alaska. Collected 
by W. H. Dall. 13020. 

Lamp. Somewhat water-worn fragment of metamorphic rock, with a natural con- 
cavity and slant, which have been taken advantage of by the Aleuts for use as 
a lamp. The stone is absolutely unmodified, but it serves the purpose as well 
as though designed by art. The wick edge is irregular, and it must have been 
]>()8sible to lay the wick along a line of about three inches. The edge sliows 
traces of charred moss and the action of fire. This lamp is the most primitive 
which has come to my knowledge, and it might well begin the entire develop- 
mental series of lamps if there were not a question whether or not it is a 
makeshift. The Aleuts of the peninsula, at least, did work their lamps from 
stone with some degree of finish. Length, 9^ inches; width, 6 inches; height 
at rear, 3 inches. Aleuts, Unalaska, Alaska. Collected by W. H. Dall. 14891. 
Plate 22, fig. 3. 

Lamp. Worked from an oval beach pebble; the reservoir is shallow and oval 
in outline ; there is no definite lip worked out. The bottom of the lamp is irreg- 
ular ; when in use, the lamp must be propped up. Length, 4^ inches; width, 3|

Lamp. Oval, worked from coarse volcanic breccia. The reservoir is shallow, with 
the bottom flat. This specimen has seen long use and the remains of charred 
wick indicate that the lamp was lighted around the entire edge. There is, how- 
ever, a lip worked out on the edge, as in Kadiak lamps. Length, 6| inches; 
width, 6i inches; height at front, 2 inches; at back, 2f inches. Aleuts, Alaska. 
Collected by W. H. Dall. 14897. Plate 20, fig. 4. 

Lamp. Oblong-oval lamp excavated in a gray volcanic beach pebble, having a ten- 
dency to split into layers. The bottom has cracked off. The reservoir is elliptic

inches ; width, 3^ inches ; height, li inches. Aleuts, Alaska. Collected by W. H. 
Dall. 14899. Plate 23, fig. 1. 

Lamp. Small oval lamp of yellow volcanic rock, having an oval cavity worked out 
apparently with a sharp-edged tool. There is no defined lip, the wick being 
applied at the narrower point of the oval. This lamp was taken from a mound 
or village site. Length, i^ inches; width, S^ inches; height, 1^ inches. Aleuts, 
Ulatka, Alaska Peninsula. Collected by W. H. Dall. 14911. 

Lamp. Small oval lamp worked from a beach pebble of gray volcanic rock. The

Lamp. Shallow reservoir worked out in the surface of a rounded beach pebble of 
volcanic rock. The outline of the reservoir is oval and its surface is roughly 
finished. Length, 5Mnche8; width, 4| inches; height, 2 inches. Aleuts, Alaska. 
Collected by W. H. Dall. 14900. Plate 23, fig. 3. 

Lamp. Made from gray volcanic rock. The reservoir is shallow and semicircular in

Lamp. Small circnhir lamp smoothly worked from stone; this hue a groove worked 
around the outside and a lip is worked iu the edge; the rc^servoir is cup-shaped. 
Apparently at times the wide has been installed around the edge, ])robably to 
secure a greater light than the width of the wick edge or lip would admit. 
While identical iu form with the lamps from Bristol Bay the lip cut in the edge 
relates it to the Kadiak region. Length, 4i!r inches; width, -li inches; height, Cl-

Lamp. Suboval, with rounded bottom, vertical sides, and rounded edge. The walls 
of the reservoir are nearl^^ vertical and the bottom nearly fiat. A large chip has 
been knocked ofl" the edge, apparently with design, in order to place a moss wick, 
the remains of which are found on the broken surface. This lamp seems to be a 
connecting type between those of Kadiak and the pottery lamps of Bristol Bay. 
It was taken from a burial place. Length, 4| inches; width, 4f inch<?s; height,
