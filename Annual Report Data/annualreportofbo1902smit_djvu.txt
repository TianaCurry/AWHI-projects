on September 14, P»Ol, to the Presidency through the death of Presi- 
dent AIcKinley, his nuMubershlp upon the Board had ceased, and he

ing in place of the Vice-President. The Secretary announced the

XII PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. 

The Secretary presented his report of the operations of the Institu- 
tion for the fiscal j^ear ending- June 30, 1901, which was accepted, and 
in which he invited the Board's attention to the statements concerning 
the National Zoological Park, the International Exchange Bureau, and 
the other interests under their charge. He spoke particularly with 
regard to the crowded condition of the National Museum, the need for 
additional space for the exhibition and care of the increasing collec- 
tions, and the need of special action to secure it. 

After discussion, the following resolution was adopted: 

Resolved, That a committee consisting of six niembei's of this Board be appointed 
by the Chancellor, whose duty it shall be to I'cpresent to Congress the jiressing 
necessity of additional room for the proper exhibition of specimens belonging to the 
National Museum, and of additional appropriations to c^arry on the work of the 
Museum. 

The C'hancellor appointed as members of this committee, Senators 
Piatt, CuUoni, and Cockrell, and Representatives Hitt, Adaniv, and 
Dinsmore. 

. Senator Henderson, as chairman of the executive committee, pre- 
sented the annual report of that committei^ for the fiscal year ending 
June 30, 1901. 

On motion, tlie report was adopted. 

RKPORT OF TIIK TERMANENT COMMITTEE. 

Senator Henderson, chairniaii of the permanent committee, made 
tin; following statement: 

rilE iroDGKlNS FUND. 

The Regents will rememljer tliut in addition to the sum of approximately $208,000 
already deposited' in the general fund constituted by the Hodgkins bequest, and 
first-class bonds of a present market value of perhajjs $42,000, already in the custody 
of the Institution, a residual sum of about $9,000 is still in the hands of the executor 
of the estate, and is deposited with the New York Insurance and Trust Company of 
New York City, by order of court, awaiting the decision of certain suits in wliich the 
liability of the estate of Mr. Hodgkins, on account of a warranty of title by him in 
the transfer of certain property in New York City, is in question. 

One of the two small properties in i*]lizabeth, N. J., derived by tlic Institution 
through the Hodgkins bequest, was sold during the year, with the ai)i)roval of the 
permanent committee, for $600. The remaining property, consisting of a single 
house and lot, the value of which is (estimated at $1,000, has been continued in the 
care of the real estate agents in Elizabeth, who have been charged \\'ith its manage- 
ment for several years. It is, in the opinion t)f the permanent committee, -desirable 
that tliis small holding be likewise disposed of whenever an ojjportunity for its sale 
at a fair pi'ice is ])res('iited. 

'I'lIK A\Ki{V I'TNl). 

The properties received l)y tlu- Institutinu from the Avery betjuest have been esti- 
mated to be worth $26,000. They are mostly uninqtroved, and yield a revenue of 
only al)out $500 a year. Mrs. Julia N Chase (formerly Miss .lulia N. Avery) pre- 
sented a claim for $().''>6 against tiic Instilution on ui'count of a slight encroachment 



PROCEEDINGS OF THE EOARD OF REGENTS. XIII 

by one of the properties on the adjoiniiiLj; ]ireini.<es owned ]>y her. After scnne nego- 
tiation the matter was adjuste(lj)y the payment to Mrs. Chase of the sum of S220 
and the conveyanee of tlie narrow strip of land in (piestion to the Institution. The 
committee recommends that in case a fair piice )ieoff(>red fm-any nf tliese proj>erties 
the Institution dispose of its holdings. 

THE ANr)KK\\S HI':<)UKST. 

At the last annual meeting of the Regents the sjiecilicatinii in t lie will nf Wallace C. 
Andrews, deceased, naming the Institution as the residuary legatee of his <'state, 
contingent on the failure of a lieijuest for founding at Willoughby, Ohio, an institu- 
tion for the free education of girls, was set forth at some length. It appears that 
after specific bequests amounting to $500,000 have been executed a residuum of at 
least $1,000,000 will remain. ]Mr. Hackett, counsel for the Institution, is in connnu- 
nication with the counsel for the executor, and Edmund Wetmore, Esi[., a member 
of the bar of the State of New York, has also been retained to look after the interests 
of the Institution in the matter. The following extract is quoted from ]\Fr. Ilackett's 
report on the present status of the be(iuest, so fjir as it coiUH'rns the Institution: 

"As already stated, the s(-lieme of founding a young ladies' school in Ohio is likely 
to prove impracticable. It is significant that, as yer, no one in ( )hio has taken any 
steps to secure the payment of the legacy. I'nder the terms of the will certain offi- 
cials, including the governor of the State, are umdv trustees to administer this fund. 
The mayor of the little town (Willoughby) is of the board. This officer has inquired 
of Mr. Plawes as to what has been done in the premises, but no active interest is 
exhibited in Ohio f;)r the reason that there is no one wIk.) may be said to have an 
interest in the success of the scheme." 

It is hoped that liefore long an amicable understanding jnay ])v had for obtaining 
a ruling of the coin-t as a guide to the executor in carrying out the provisions of the 
will. 

THE SPKACUTE HEtJUKST. 

The attention of tlie Regents was called at their last meeting to the provisions of 
the will of Mr. Joseph White Sprague, who, after be(jueathing certain personal 
effects to relatives, directs the executor, in trust, to convert the personalty into money 
and to distribute 85 per cent of the incomeof the entire estate among certain devisees 
until twenty years after the death of the last of said devisees, when tlu' trust will 
expire by limitation and all assets in tlie hands of the trustiM' will be conveyed to the 
United States of America in accordanct' with the following iiaragrapli in the will: 

"When the trust herein created exjiires liy limitation, as aforesaid, then all dis- 
tribution of the income of the trust profterty is to cease, and said trustee is instructed 
and directed to assign ami make over by pro])er conveyance all trust i>roperty in his 
possession, whether real or personal, invested or uninveste<l, to the United States of 
America, to be held by said United States as a, ]iorti<iii of the funds of the Smithson- 
ian Institute, to be known as the 'Sprague fund," lli<' income of this fund to be used 
as follows: One-half of sai'l income in each year to be added to the ])rinciiia!. The 
other half of said income is to lie ex]>ended, under the direction of the officers of the 
said Institute, in such manner as will in tlieir judgment best jn-oiiiote the ad\'ance- 
ment of the jihysical sciences, either liy arranging foi' the giving of free lectures, on 
scientific sultjects, in different I'ities and towns of the said Uniteil States, or by pro- 
viding for original scientific research in the laboratory and otherwise, or by the pub- 
lication of the re.«ults of original scii-ntilic reseaiches, or by offering, from time to 
tune, rewards or medals, for meritorious dist-overiet^, or by any or all of these 
methods,' as in their judgment may seem best. The half ol the gross income thus 
authorized to be expended annually is to be cumulative, so tiiat the portion of it 
unexpended during any one year may be expended during any subsequent year or 
years. ' ' 



XIV PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. 

Although the time at which tlie Institution will derive any profit from the above 
legacy may reasonably be assumed to be somewhat remote, it is believed, if the news- 
paper estimate of $200,000 be even approximately accurate, that the amount of the 
fund Avhich will accj-ue to the Institution will not be inconsiderable. At present 
there would seem to be no further duty imposed upon the Institution than to see 
that the property is accounted for and is held in safe hands. 

On motion, the report was accepted. 

Senator Henderson, as chairman of the executive committee, pre- 
sented the following resolution, which was adopted: 

BeHolred, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 
1903, be appropriated for the service of the Institution, to be expended by the Sec- 
retary, witli the advice of _the executive committee, with full discretion on the part 
of the Secretary as to items. 

REMOVAL OF SMITHSON's REMAINS. 

The Secretary recalled to the Board the resolution adopted by it 
at the last meeting with regard to the removal of the remains of 
James Smithson. The wishes of the Board were communicated to 
one of the officers of the English church at Genoa, Mr. PI A. Le 
Mesurier, who, under date of December 23, 1901, replied in part as 

follows: 

******* 

You are aware tliat (lur h()])e iseventually to (il)tain for our countrymen a separate 
burying i)lace which by an easy, and I may say obvious, arrangement might be 
made to give shelter not merely to British subjects, but to American also. I regret 
to say, however, that I see no chance for the present of this most desirable consum- 
mation, as the authorities (apparently in consequence of the difticulty of finding an 
alternativ(^ site) have withdrawn their offer of i)roviding us with a fresh cemetery if 
we allowed them to transfer at once all remains from San Benigno, where your founder 
rests. The j'resent i)olicy of the authorities is presumably to let things remain as they 
are until the time comes (three years or so hence) when the law of public utility 
will strengthen their liands as to taking possession of the San Benigno ground, of 
course under the obligation of transi)orting the remains elsewhere, which would in 
all prol)abiiity mean a portion of the general Protestant C'emeter}' and not a separate 
place of interment. When the time for the transfer approaches it will be obviously 
expedient to apply to the British andjassador at Rome (hacked up as we are con- 
fident will 1h> the case by the friendly offices of the representative of the United 
States) to put the case before the Italian (iovernment, so that the local authorities 
may he cnjoiiuMl to cany out tht" process with all due rcvi'n'uce and if possible (as 
it oiii,dit lo he possible ) to a specially reserved new cemetery. Our consul is most 
fidly alive to the importance of diplomatic support and will take the initiative in 
due course. 

Ml. r>(dl licrc siiid lliut he would like wvy iiuich to have in the 
record tliat lie had jjrcsented to the Board at the hist meeting his 
strong feeling that the remains of Smithson shoiihl bo bi-ought to this 
country. 

The Secretary iiil"orm('(l Mr. Bell thtit his remarks were now on the 
written record. 



PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF RECJENTS. XV 

SANTA FE PALACE. 

The SeiTctiiry said tliat the governor of New Mexico liud oiVered to 
tninsfer to the Institution an aneient Spanish pahice in Santa Fe, on 
condition that it he maintained, without cost to the State, as a nuiseuni 
of the archteoloyv of the S(nithwest. After discussion the Board 
decided that it was inadvisabh' to accept tlie proposition. 

TllK CARNECIE INSTITUTION. 

The Secretar}' said that since the foundation of the Smithsonian 
Institution there had perhaps occurred no event of more importance 
to it than the foundation of a new institution — the Carnegde Institu- 
tion — whose dechired aims and g-oneral purposes were nearly those 
which the Institution has hitherto considered its own. ^Ir. Carnegie 
invited the Secretary of the Smithsonian to l)ecome a mcm])er of the 
))oard of trustees for the management of this fund, in the foUowing 
letter: 

Dkckmiskk 27, I'JOl. 

Deak ^\h: I am ulxjut to tianslVr tni iiiillioiiH of ."> pci- enit l)onds to a body of 
trustees for tlie pur])Oses described in the inclosed paper. A list of the trustees 
selected is also inclosed. 

It will be a source of much j)leasure to me if you -will kindly (-(.nsent to serve. 

Truly yours, 

Andrew Caknecie. 
The Secketaky of the Smitmsoniax Ixstitftion. 

The letter was accompanied l)y a list of the trustees and by a state- 
ment of the considerations which led to the establishment of the foun- 
dation. The Secretary read the articles of incorporation of the new 
institution, and stated that after conference with the Chancellor and 
the chairman of the executive committee, lie had accepted the trustee- 
ship in the following- terms, coiulitionally on the approval of the board: 

Decemhek :>!, I'.H)1. 
Dear Sn:: 1 beg to acknowledge the receipt of y<iur conununication <if the 27th 
instant, with the accom])anying papers outlining the general purpose of an institution 
or establishment which you pro^iose to found in the city of Washington for the 
encouragement of research and kindred purjioses, and also inclosing a list of proposed 
trustees, in which you are good enough to name the Secretary of the Smithsonian 
Institution as an ex oflicio member. 

It will give me, personally, great pleasure, with the consent of the Regents, to 
accept membership upon this board, and I desire to t'X[>re.ss my sense of warm recog- 
nition of the large purposes whidi \\ii\v ins])ircd you to makc^ this nohk; benefaction. 
I accept such membership in the alxsence of knowledge as to details, l)ut in the full 
confidence of a symj)athy with your general purpose. 

Very respectfully, yours, S. 1*. JjANolev, 

tSecn'l((r!i. 
Andrew CAKNEcn-;, Esq., 

No. 5 Jl&si Fiftu-fiflli SI reel, Xcir York Cilij. 



XVI PROCEEDITSTGS OF THE BOARD OF EEGENTS. 

He then stated certain considerations with regai'd to the relationship 
of the Smithsonian Institution to the Carneg-ie Institution, and asked 
for an expression of the opinions of the Regents for his instruction. 
After discussion it was announced as the sense of the Board that the 
Secretary should accept the trusteeship unfettered hy instructions. 

PUBLICATIONS OF THE INSTITUTION. 

The Secretary called the attention of the Board to the exhiliition of 
Reports and other publications which had been issued b}' the Institu- 
tion during the year. 

The Secretaiy then spoke of the affairs of the Bureau of Ethnology, 
and of the Astroph3^sical Observatoiy, whose first volume of the 
Annals he exhibited. With regard to the Observatory, the Secretary 
said further that Congress had asked for a report of the appropria- 
tions g-ranted it and of the results obtained. Such a I'eport had been 
submitted at the beginning of the session, and had been ordered 
printed. It included the Annals above referred to, and he had been 
enabled to add a number of commendatory letters from eminent men 
of science, such as Sir George Stokes, Lord Rayleigh, Lord Kelvin, 
Sir William Huggins, Sir Robert Ball, Prof. Simon Newcomb, Prof. 
E. C. Pickering, Prof. G. E. Hale, and others. 

There being no further ])usincss to come before the Board, on 
motion the meeting adjourned.

Gextle3IEn: I have the honor to present herewitii my report show-

1902, inchiding the work phiced under its direction ])Y Congress in the 
United States National j\[useuni, the Bureau of American Ethnology,

of this report, a general account of the affairs of the Institution and 
its bureaus, while the appendix presents more dettiiled statements by 
the persotis in direct charge of the different branches of the work. 
Independentlv of this, the operations of the National Musevun are

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. 

THE ESTAKLISHMENT. 

By act of Congress approved ^Vugust 10, IS^H, the Smithsonian 
Institution was creati'd an EstablishmiMit. Its statutory nuMubeis ai'e 
the President, the Vice-President, tlie Chief flustice of the I'uited 
States, and the heads of the Executive^ Depai'tmejits. The preroga- 
tive of the Establishment is ''the su})er\'isi()n of the aff'tiirs of the 
Institution and the advice and instruction of the Board of Kegents." 

On the death of Presi(hMit AIcKinley on Septend)er N. L!)(>1, Vice- 
President Koosevelt succeeded to the Presidency and a ^•:lcancy 
occurred in the >'ice-pr(n-;ldency. Other changes were caused by the 
resignation of the Hon. Lyman J. Gage, Secretary of the Tretisury; 
SM 1902—^1 1 



'2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

the Hon. John D. Long-, Secretaiy (^f the Navy, and the Hon. Charles 
Emory Smith, Postmaster-General. 

As organized on June 30, 1902, the Establishment consisted of the 
following ex officio mem])ers: 

Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States. 

(Vacancy), Vice-President of the United States. 

Melville W. Fuller, Chief Justice of the United States. 

John Hay, Secretary of State.

board of regents. 

The Board of Regents consists of the Vice-President and the Chief 
Justice of the United States as ex officio members, three members of 
the Senate, three members of the House of Representatives, and six 
citizens, "two of whom shall be residents of the city of Washington 
and the other four shall be inhabitants of some State, but no two of 
them of the same State. *' 

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents adopted 
Januaiy, 1890, by which its annual meeting occurs on the fourth 
Wednesday of each year, the Board met on Jaiuiary 22. 1902, at 10 
o'clock a. m. 

The following is an aV)stract of its proceedings, which will be found 
in detail in the annual report of the Board to (Congress: 

The Secretary stated that Vice-President Roosevelt had been ex officio 
a member of the Board, but that l)y I'eason of his succession to the 
Presidency through the death of President McKinley his membership 
upon the Board had ceased, and he had become the presiding officer 
of the Institution. In accordance with pnvedent, an invitation had 
been extended to the President pro temi)ore of the Senate, the Hon. 
William P. Frye, to attend tiie meeting in place of the Vice-President. 

He announced the reappointment, as Regents, of Representatives 
R. R. Hitt, Robert Adams, jr., and Hugh A. Dinsmore, whose terms 
had expired. 

The Secretary presented his rc^port of the operations of the Institu- 
tion for the fiscal year ending fJuiie 30, 1901, inviting the Board's 
attention to the statements concerning the National Zoological Park, 
the International Kxchange P)ureau, and the other interests under 
their charge. He spoke particulaily with regard to th(^ crowded con- 
dition of the National Museum, tl)(> need for additional space for the 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 6 

exhibition and euro of the inci'casin*;- collections, and tlic need of 
special action to .secure it. 

After discussion, the following- resolution was adopted: 

Resohed^ That a committee eonsisting of six nuMuhers of this Board 
be appointed by the Chancellor, whose duty it shall bi> to represent to 
Congress the pressing necessity of additional room for the proper 
exhil)ition of specimens belonging to the National Museum, and of 
additional appropriations to carry on the work of the Mus(uuii. 

The Chanc(dlor appointed as members of this conunittee Senators 
Piatt, CuUom, and Cockrell. and Ke})r(>sentatives Ilitt. Adams, and 
Dinsmore. 

The Board adopted the annual reports of the ex'ecutive and perma- 
nent committees, which had been presented l)y their chairman. Senator 
Henderson. The usual resolution relati\ c to income and expenditure 
was adopted. 

The Secretary read a letter from the authorities of the British 
l)urial ground at Genoa, stating that when the time arrived for the 
abolition of the cemetery by the Italian Government and the transfer 
of the ])odies there to a new site, the remains of Smithson would be 
reinterred with due reverence and care. 

Mr. Bell said that he would like \ery miu-li to have i\\v. records show 
that he had })resente(l to the Board at the last meeting an expression of 
his strong feeling that the remains of Smithson should 1k^ brought to 
this country. 

The Secretary said that the governor of New Mexico had offered to 
transfer to the Institution an ancient Spanish palace in Santa Fe, on 
condition that it be maintained, without cost to the State, as a nuiseum 
of the archaeology of the Southwest, After discussion the Board 
decided that it was inadvisable to accept the proposition. 

The Secretary said that since* the foundation of the Smithsonian 
Institution there had perhaps occurred no event of more importance 
to it than the foundation of a new institution — the Carnegie Institu- 
tion — whose declared aims and general purix)ses were nearly those 
which the Institution has hitherto considered its own. Mr. Carnegie 
invited the Secretary of the Smithsonian to become a member of the 
board of trustees for the management of this fund, in the following 

letter: 

Dkcember 27, 1901. 
Dear Sir: I am about to transfer ten millions of 5 per cent honds to a body of 
trustees for the purposes described in tlic inclosed paper. A list nf the trustees 
selected is also inclosed 

It will be a source of much jjleasure to me if you will kindly consent to serve. 

Truly yours, Andrew Carneoie. 

The Secretary of the SMrrnsoNiAX iNSTrruTioN. 

The letter was accompanied h\ a list of the trustees and by a state- 
ment of the considerations which led to the establishment of the foun 
dation. The Secretary read the articles of incoi-poration of th(> new

institution, and .stated that after couferenc-e with the Chancellor and 
the chairman of the executive committee, he had accepted the trustee- 
ship in the following terms, conditionally on the approval of the 
])oard: 

December 31, 1901. 

Dear Sir: I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 27th 
instant, with the accompanying papers outlining the general purpose of an institution 
or establishment which you propose to found in the city of Washington for the 
encouragement of research and kindred purposes, and also inclosing a list of jiroposed 
trustees, in which you are good enough to name the Secretary of the Smithsonian 
Institution as an ex officio member. 

It will give me, personally, great pleasure, with the consent of the Regents, to 
accept membership upon this board, and I desire to express my sense of warm recog- 
nition of the large i^urposes which have inspired you to make this noble benefaction. 
I accept such membership in the absence of knowledge as to details, Ijut in the full 
confidence of a sympathy with your general purpose. 

V^ery respectfully, yours, S. P. Langlev, 

Secretary. 
Andrew Carnegie, Esq., 

JVo. 5 West F{ft7j-fifth Street, New York City. 

He then stated certain considerations w- ith regard to the relationship 
of the Smithsonian Institution to the Carnegie Institution, and asked 
for an expression of the opinions of the Regents for his instruction. 
After discussion, it was announced as the sense of the Board that the 
Secretary should accept the trusteeship unfettered ])y instructions. 

The Secretary then spoke of the afiairs of the Bureau of Ethnology, 
and of the Astrophvsical Observatorv, whose first volume of the 
Annals he exhibited. With regard to the Observatory, the Secretary 
said further that (Congress had asked for a report of the appropriations 
granted it and of the results obtained. Such a report had been sub- 
mitted at the beginning of the session, and had been ordered printed. 
It included the Annals above referred to, and he had been enabled to 
add a number of commendatory letters from eminent men of science, 
such as Sir George Stokes, Lord Rayleigh, Lord Kehin, Sir William 
Huggins. Sir Rolx'rt Ball, Prof. Simon Newcomb. Prof. E. C. Picker 
ing, Prof. G. E. Hale, and others.

The geiKTul .supervision of tin- Itusiiicss oi" the scvenil (IcpeiKlcncios 
phieed by Cono-ress under the direction of the Institution lias year })y 
year required the increased ptu-sonal attention of tiie Secretary, 
althouii'h as far as seems practical)ie tiie carrying out of dt^ails has 
been left to those in innnediate charg-e of the work of the bureaus. 
The cost of the clerical labor in\-olved in this o-eiuu'al supervision by 
the Secretary's office is in part met l)y allotments from the various 
Government ai)propriations. although the limited income of tlie Insti- 
tution is still drawn upon for many matters which should i)roperly be 
provided for by Cong'ress. 

The Board has authorized the Secn>tary to lay these matters before 
Congress, but the needs of other parts of the Institution's service 
have seemed so pressing that he has as yet deferred doing ,so in favor 
of such other demands. 

P,UILI)1N(4S. 

Some much-needed I'epairs to the main roof of the Snnthsonian 
building were in progress at the close of the tiscal year. In this 
connection it seems important to call attention to the n(»cessity of 
a reconstruction of the ceiling and other renovations of the large 
Anthropological Hall, whose noble dimensions descry*' a worthier 
treatment, and of improving the access to it. 

Iiupi-o\emeiits were made in the Smithsonian basement in the 
Cjuarters occu})ied by the Exchange Office and a hydi'aulic elevator 
was constructed for the handling of hea^'v packages. 

In the ])aragra})hs dexoted to the Museum and to the Zoological 
Park mention is made of building inn)rovenieids during the year. 

FIXAN(!KS. 

At the beginning of the Hscal year, .luly 1, li»()l, the uncxpendi^d 
balance, as stated iu my last re})oi't. was 'i^s:},!)^;-).::^*;. Dui'ing the 
year the total recei[)ts l)y the Institution \vei'(> ^t;(»,Sl l.on. Of this 
sum ^.^t'l.-foo was d(U'i\-ed from iidei'est, while the remaining i^Ki. 411 .<>'.♦ 
was receiviHl from miscellaneous sources.

details of \vhi<-h ar(\iii\('n in the report of the executive conuuittee. 
The balance remaiiung to the credit of the Secretar^Mju June oO, 11M»2, 
for the expenses of the Institution was ^81,120.01. A c(^nsiderable 
part of this balance is held against the accunudated interest on the 
Hodgkins and other funds and against certain contingent obligations 
which may be expected tomatur(> as a result of various scientitic invea- 
tigations and publications in progress.

It w:i> a part oi the original plan ol: the In.stitution that its .^ecretaiy 
>hotild not give hi.s time wholly to adniini.strative duties, but .•should, 
a^s a sttideut of nature, directly aid in its scientitic investigations.'' 

Research work in various fields of science has heen continued by 
the Institution and its dependencies. The Secretary has made some 
progress toward the solution of the problem of mechanical flight, and 
has been carrying on. with the consent of the Eegents. some experi- 
ments for the War Department, at its expense, and is adding other 
experiments, partly at the expense of the Institution. In the Astro- 
physical Observatory he has continued work believed to be important, 
and inaugurated some experiments of novel interest, which are referred 
to later. 

Through the ^Museum and the Bureau of American Ethnology the 
In.stitution has been enabled to carry on variou.< l)iological and ethno- 
logical researches, which will be found fully de.sc-ribed el.sewherf in 
this rejx)rt and need not be repeated here. 

HOIXJKIXS FCND. 

In connection with the administration of the Hodgkins fund, papers 
recording the advance of specialists along various interesting lines of 
investigation have been submitted, some of which are now in course 
of publicalnon. 

^ Besolr^d, That the Secretary continue his researches in physical science, and pre- 
sent such facts and principles as may be developed for publication in the Smithsonian 
contributions. (Adopted at meeting o£ the Boani of Eegents January 26, 1S47, ) 



8 REPOKT OF THE SECEETARY. 

The report of the research on the spectrum conducted by Dr. Victor 
Schumann, of Leipzig, has received extensive additions during the year, 
notaldy through a detailed description of the ingenious apparatus used 
in his work. This supplement is accompanied ]\v illustrations which 
appear now for the first time, although Dr. Schiunann has been author- 
ized to announce in the scientific journals of his own country the dis- 
coveries made in the course of his experiments, at the same time 
notifying the In.stitution of his progress. 

A second grant on l)ehalf of Dr. Schumann has l)een approved dur- 
ing the 3'ear, and it is interesting to know that Harvard Universit}^, 
recognizing the value of his work, has also awarded him a grant. The 
new Physical Institute of the Royal Academy of Sciences in Leipzig 
has likewise aided this research by placing laboratory room at the dis- 
posal of Dr. Schumann, who, it is hoped, will ])e able in the near 
future to secure still more complete results from his painstaking 
experiments in vacuum spectroscopy. 

The memoir by Dr. Carl Barns, mentioned in my last report as in 
course of publication, has been issued during the jeav as part of Vol- 
ume XXIX, Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge. It describes 
experiments with ionized air begun ))v Dr. Barus some years since 
and iccently prosecuted imder a Ilodgkins grant from the Institution. 
The research was tributary to an investigation of the colors of cloudy 
condensation. Lord Rayleigh's famous theory, if applied, would stop 
at the deep reds of the first order, terminating in opaque, whereas in 
the ]:i])orator3' experiments exceptionally brilliant colors, extending 
almost into the third order of Newton's series, may ])e produced. It 
was thus essenti;»1 as a preliminary step to investigate appropriate 
means for the ]uo<hiction of nuclei, to determine their number per 
cubic centimeter, their velocity, their association with ionization, the 
effect of the pressure of an electric field, etc. This was the general 
trend of the experiments by Dr. Barus. The endeavor was made with 
the aid of tlie condensation tube to show that the nucleus has a specific 
velocity of it>^ own, and that this is retained even in the absence of an 
electi'ic ti(d(l. The application of this principle to plate, to tubular, 
and to sph(*iii-al condensers leads, in (nery case and in spite of the 
variation of method, (o an order of Aalues as to the number of parti- 
cU's in action. agrcH'ing witii the data obtained by other investigators 
from diffei'ent experiments and th(M)retically different ])oints of view. 

A second grant has ])een api)roved on beiialf of Dr. Barus, and a 
new memoir on the structure of the nucleus, detailing experiments 
subsecjuent to tliose descril)e(l in the \<)hime just pu1)]ished is soon to 
be submitted l)y him. 

The experiments in air resistance ))y Mr. C. Canovetti, referred to 
in the Secretary's last report, which were begun at Brescia, Italy, of 



REPOKT OF THE SECKETAKV. 9 

which c-ity he was at that time engineer in chief, liaxc been continued 
in Italy, where l)y means of an ingenious apparatus he has prosecuted 
a research which has been reported upon in detail, with illustrations 
accompanied by tables giving the numerical results attained. After 
compliance with the request of the Institution in regard to submitting 
his I'eport, a second moderate grant was approved on bcdialf of Mr. 
Canovetti in March of this year. A report of the results of the 
experiments under this second grant is now awaited. 

Dr. von Lendenfeld. of the University of Prague, who has been 
aided l)v a grant from the Hodgkins fund, icports that his studies are 
now sufticiently advanced to enabl(> him to )>egin the pre})aration of 
his manuscript for publication. 'l\dephotography has been extensively 
and successfully us(h1 in this research, and tlic summary of work 
alrmidy submitted is accompanied l)y inter(^sting illustrations. 

A monograph embodying the results of th(^ completed research, 
which will be published later, Avill present an anatomical and physio- 
logical study of insects, the lowei' vertebrates (Kxoca'tus, Draco, 
etc.), birds, manunals (Petaurus, Geleopithecus. eti-.), and will treat 
of the polj^genetic development of the organs of flight in animals. 
The physical i)roperties of the air. wind velocities, resistance, etc., 
will be considered, and it is hoped that the publication will not only 
prove of general interest l)ut will become a valuable work of reference 
for students. 

Di'. jNhirey, of the French Institute, mentioned in my last report as 
having been awarded a grant from the Hodgkins fund, is still contin- 
uing his most interesting experiments. The a})])licati()n of metro- 
photography and chronoi)hotography to this investigation has been 
described by Dr. jVhirey in a paper of such general value that it was 
puldished in the appendix to the report of the Secretary for 1!H»1. In 
this edition of the paper are included copies of special and interesting- 
photographs which have been forwarded to the Institution by Dr. 
Marey. 

The research into the nature of vowels by Prof. Louis Bevier. of 
Rutgers College, has been reported on through a series of pul)lished 
articles, transmitted l)y the author to the Institution, which record 
in detail the results thus far o])tained. 'i'he imestigation is still in 
progress, the vowel sei'ies from a to u IxMug now under analysis and 
discussion. 

During this year a grant has been approved on behalf of Mr. E. C 
Hufl'aker for the construction and practical aj)i)lication of a device 
intended to produce a unifoi-m and measured How of aii' through a 
tube of an}' desired diameter. 

This apparatus is primarily designed foi' use in connection with 
investigations in the line of biology, and it has already been applied 



10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

to exact experiments in the development of the emVn-yo in the egg. 
It is hoped that ])y means of this invention facts may be esta})lished 
which will prove of practical \alue. 

The meteorological investigation in connection with air currents at 
varying altitudes, heretofore reported on as conducted ]>y Mr. A. L. 
liotch at Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory, have been supple- 
mented this year ])y a series of experiments on the lift and drift of 
the wind on plane and curved surfaces. Mr. A. A. Merrill, who was 
recommended by Mr. Kotch for this work, received a grant from the 
Hodgkins fund and has from time to time reported the result of his 
experiments. 

Th(^ gi'ant to tlie .Journal of Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric 
Electricity has been continued during the past year, a specified 
num])er of copies of the Journal ])eing sent out, as directed by the 
Institution, to specialists and to educational establishments. 

In May, IDO^, an application for a grant from the Hodgkins fund 
was made l)v Prof. Moi-ris W. Travers, of University College, London, 
which, after tlie customary reference, examination, and discussion, 
was approved in June of this year. Professor Travers has been the 
colleague of Prof. William Ramsey in his later researches upon the 
rare gases of the atmosphere, and is now engaged in an investigation 
which will deal largely with tlie liquid properties of hydrogen. 

A sunnnary of the progress of this investigation, on behalf of wliich 
the final grant of this year is approved, will rind place in the next 
report. 

The difficulties in the way of submitting, during the progress of a 
research, a report which is even measurably satisfactory to an inves- 
tigator, are appreciated Ijy the Secretary, whose duty it becomes, year 
by ycMir, to record so far as possible the advance of the investigations 
which the terms of the bequest allow him to aid ])y grants from the 
Hodgkins fund. 

In November, 1!K)1, a special committee, the members of which 
represented the departments of biology, physics, chemistiT, geology, 
meteorology, astronomy, electricity, and anthropology, was appointed 
to considei- the award of the Hodgkins special medal, which, as stated 
in the r<'port foi' 1S!);>, is bestowed only for important contributions 
to the knowledge of the nature and properties of atmospheric air. or 
for original and practical applications of present knowledgt* to the 
welfare of mankind, thus c()nq)lying not onl}' with the teiins of the 
Hodgkins Fund, but also furthering the expressed aim of the foundei' 
of the Institution. 

As will be remeiubei-ed, the lii-st special Hodgkins medal was awarded 
in 1S<)'.» to Prof. James Dewar, of the Royal Institutit)n of (xi-eat Britain. 

In accordance with the recommendation of the committee, the 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 11 

present award is made to I'rof. fl. J. 'rhoiiison. of Trinity Collcoo, 
Cambridg-e, England, and is, hi'oadly stated, for his investigations 
on the conduetivity of gases, especially on the gases that coinposc 
atmospheric air. 

NAPLES TABLE. 

The lease by the Institution, for a thii'd term of thice \'eai-s, of a 
table in the Naples Zoological Station, which expii-ed on the oOth of 
June, lt>02, has Ixhmi extended luitil the ;;lst of December of the same 
>'ear. Following this action, numerous applications foi- the Smith- 
sonian seat, whidi had necessarily been held pending, were taken up 
for consideration. The ([uestion as to the renewal of the lease for 
another term of years is now receiving careful consideration, and will 
be decided l)efore th(» expiration of the present contract. 

The Secretary visited the Naples Station (hiring the sununej- and 
was pleased with the investigations carried on there. The Smith- 
sonian Institution, through its cooperation in this work, has been 
brought in touch with many institutions of learning in the Ignited 
States, but it is to be hoped that it may receive from sonu' extraneous 
source the means of continuing this lease for the benefit of all Ameri- 
can biologists, which if renewed nuist divert to this useful but extrane- 
ous purpose funds needed for others. 

In November, 1901, Dr. C. W. Prentiss, to whom a travding Parker 
Fellowship had l)een awarded l\y Harvard l^niversity, applied for and 
received the appointment to the Smithsonian seat in the Naples vStation 
for March, April, and May, 11)02. Being rea]i})ointed Parker Fellow 
while in i-esidence at Naples, Dr. Prentiss asked for a i)rolongation of 
his term through tho months of flune and July, llie unavoidable 
delay in replying to this request, caused by tlu> uncertainty as to the 
extension of the lease, was not allowed to work to tlie disadvantage of 
the applicant by Dr. Dohrn, who kin.dly invited him to continue his 
occupancy until a decision was reached l)y the Institution. 

Numerous other applicants were also, to my regret, kept in uncer- 
tainty in regard to their appointments, but althougli this fact finally 
])rought three and even four Smithsonian appointees to Na})les at the 
same time, and foi- an extended period, they were all courteously 
arranged for by the obliging director of the station, 'llie details of 
these appointments will receive mention in the report for the coming 
year, to which tlu\y belong and are accredited. It ma}' l)e added that 
muiierous applications, for periods beyond the jDresent extension of 
the lease, are now held for action, awaiting a decision as to its renewal. 

The Secretary desires to express again his appreciatiori of the ready 
and efficient aid rendered him year after year by the advisory Com- 
mittee in the examination of credentials and in recommendations as to 
appointments. 



12 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

EXPLORATIONS. 

The Institution has continued to carry on various biological and 
ethnolog-ieal explorations through the medium of the National Museum 
and the l^ureau of American Ethnology, and has also cooperated with 
the Executive Departments in these directions. The details of most 
of these explorations tire given in the paragraphs devoted to the sev- 
eral bureaus. 

PUBLICATIONS. 

In the pal)lications of the Institution the double aim of its founder 
is represented — that it should exist for (1) the ''increase" and ('I) the 
"diti'usion" of knowledge. 

The recording- of results of original I'esearches, the increase of 
knoAvledge, is chietly through the series of Contributions to Knowd- 
edge, a quarto work begun in IS^S, and in which more than 140 valu- 
able memoirs, collected in 32 volumes, have so far been published. 
To this series has been added during the year a memoir l)y Dr. Carl 
Barus giving the results of his experiments in ionized air, the investi- 
gation having I)een aided by a grant from the Hodgkins fund, as 
mentioned above. 

The lirst edition of one of the memoirs of Contributions, published 
in 181)1, showing the results of the 8ecretar3''s experiments in aero- 
dA'namics, having become exhausted, a second edition has been printed 
from the stereotype plates, with a few additional observations. 

To the s(n-ies of Miscellaneous Collections, in octavo form, have 
been added a List of Observatories, a work on the Literature of 
Manganese, and an Index to the Literature of the Spectroscope. 

The Contributions and Miscellaneous Collections, being printed at 
the expense of the Smithsonian income, are necessarily published in 
limited editions of 1,500 copies, which are distributed as widely as pos- 
sible to the larger libraries and institutions of the woild. The total 
distribution of these during the year was 11,645 volumes and memoirs. 

The Smithsonian Report is the only publication issued in large num- 
bers, the edi ion being at present ai)out 12,000 copies, 7,000 of which 
are placed at the disposal of the Institution, the remaining- 5,000 being 
distril)uted })y Congress or to depositories designated by law. This 
work is published at the expense of the Government and has come to 
be in such great popular dcMuand that th(^ (Mitir<> edition of the 1900 
re])orl, of which the general distribution was made in Octol)er, 1901, 
was exhausted in a few months, ev(Mi before the 1901 report could 
be mack' ready for tlu^ printer. 

The volume is primarily a Report of the Uoard of Regents to Con- 
gress concerning the operations and expenditures during the 3'ear, and 
includes the Proceedings of the Regents'' meeting in January of each 
year, the financial report of the executive committee, the report of

the Secretarv. giving ;ui uci'ouiit ol" thv year's woi-k, aiul a general 
appendix. Its appendix, liowin'er, forms a distinct and popular part 
of the Avoriv and is oiw of the principal methods em])loyed l)y the 
Institution in the (/i^ffnsJon of knowledge. In the ap})cndi\ are pub- 
lished a large num))er — sometim(\s as many as oO — pa})(n-s of pid)lic 
interest. 

The Secretary has said elsewhere: "Tiiese papers have a purpose 

-linct from any others published by the Institution. They ari> only 

casionally original contributior.s to science. They are not for the 

rofessional reader only, orcxcn chictly. I»ut they are addressed to that 

irge body of the public which has a general interest in scientiHc mat 

;-s without special knowledge. \Vhile it is always a reconnucndation 

it they should have been written by recognized authorities, vet this is 

minor im})ortance if the articles are soiuid expositions of ihc sub- 

t. The essential thing is that they should be not only sound and 

tructive, l)ut timely and interesting to the nonprofessional reader, 

id in that good sense popular. If thev ai'e accompanied by illustra- 

ms, all the better. As they are intended to serve as a kind of 

jular survey of the whole tield of the sciences, both physical and 

. jlogical, for the current year, it is, as a rule, impracticable to ])rint 

lore than one paper on any })articular subject.'' 

A portion of the edition of the report is distributed in the form of 
^»amphlets of individual papers, and wdiere any of these are of 
particular interest additional copies are printed at the expense of the 
Institution. Of the 19<)1 report 2o,Tr)0 co|)i('s of separat»» pa[)ers have 
thus been ordered for special distribution. 

It is impossible to meet the great demand from individuals for the 
reports, more than 5,000 copies being required to sup})ly a selected list 
of libraries and institutions of learning, to w hich tlu' work has bc^en 
regularly sent for many years. Th(> total distribution of Nolumes or 
se})arate ])arts of i-(>ports during the ])ast liscal year aggregated

This ])ublication. then, is distril>ul(Ml not oidy to a large number of 
li))raries throughout the world, but it is also addressed to as manv as 
possible of the hundreds of individual a})plicants of all classes who 
seem eager to learn of the world's advance in the se\(>i"al branches of

14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

knowledg-e. It \h ))y these icports, which arc in a good sense popular, 
as well as by its original seientifie works, that the Institution growls 
each year better known as one of those whose influence for good is 
limited by no boundary, but, as its motto declares, goes ''* throughout 
the world.'' In this the Secretary has for some years past imitated 
the action of his honored predecessor, Henry, in giying a great deal 
of his personal attention to its editorship, with a view to making it of 
more popular interest, and he has been gratified at the large demand 
just referred to, with which the result of his labors has been met. 

In addition to the preceding publications by the Institution proper, 
a considerable number of works, chiefly on biological topics, have 
been added to the Museum series. 

Of the publications of the Bureau of American Ethnology, the 
second part of the Eighteenth Report for the fiscal year 1896-97 
was distributed, also the separate papers of the Nineteenth Report 
for 1897-98. The manuscripts of the Twentieth, Twenty-first, and 
Twenty-second Reports for the years 1899 to 1901 were transmitted 
to the printer during the last half of the fiscal year. 

Mention ma}' also lie made of a special edition of Volume I of the 
Annals of the Astrophysical 01)servatory. reprinted from a Senate 
document of which it formed a part. This document" consisted of a 
volume of 339 pages and 44: plates, submitted to Congress in response 
to the following item in the sundry" civil act of March 3, 1901: "That 
the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution is directed to report to 
Congress on the first day of the next regular session an entire 
account of all appropriations heretofore expended l)y the Astro- 
physical Observatory, what results have been reached, and what is 
the present condition of the Avork of said Observatory.'"' 

The Secretary during the ye'AV transmitted to Congress the Annual 
Report of the American Historical Association for the year 1901, and 
also the Fourth Report of the National Society of the Daughters of 
the American Revolution. The Institution has no share in the dis- 
tribution of the latter report, only the " usual" document number 
(1,682) being printed. Of the Historical Reports a limited number, 
beginning with the 1891 report, have been at the disposal of the Insti- 
tution for distribution to the larger historical societies of the world 
in exchange^ for their publications. 

LIBRARY. 

Tile accessions to the Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Congress 
dui'ing the year were 1,678 volumes, 20,831 parts of volumes, 3,732 
pamphlets, and 111 charts, or a total of 26,658, extending the accession 
numbers to 115,523. The libraries of the Secretary's ofl&ce, and of

and 2,5ST parts of volunu's. 

A veiy eomplete aiid valuable collection of books antl |)ani])hlcts 
relating to Napoleon Bonaparte has been presented to the Institution 
by Gen. John Watts de Peyster, and will be known as the '"Watts de 
Peyster Collection, Napoleon Bonaparte/' The 2,000 volumes in this 
series are from many countries and in many languages. 

The Smithsonian x\rtRoom. placed in general charge of the lit)iarian, 
has been made attractive by^ a rearrangement of the cases containing 
the valuable' engravings and books on art belonging to the Institution, 
and steps have ])een taken for exhibiting a reproduction of the Parthe- 
non frieze aroimd the entire room. 

Several years ago the Secretary organized an employees' library, 
which has proved to be very popular, and a branch has been established 
in the National Zoological Park. 

The accessions to the National Museum Library were 19,553 books, 
pamphlets, and periodicals. Its crowded condition has l)een relieved 
by the addition of galleries, making a total floor space of '2,o\)'2 square 
feet. Thirty sectional libraries are established in the departments of 
the Museum, thus making readily accessible to those in charge of the 
several branches of scientific research the books directly pertaining 
to their work, while the administration of these sectional libraries is 
under the control of the Museum librarian. 

Since the Secretary's last report, consideral)le work has l)een done 
in the maintenance of the International Catalogue of Scientific Liter- 
ature, an allotment from the Institution's fund permitting the estab- 
lishment of a regional Inireau. An annual appropriation of about 
$10,000 is needed for the United States Regional Bureau, and it is 
hoped that Congress may provide such an amount for the accomplish- 
ment of this undertaking, so important to every branch of scientific 
learning, a work that no single institution could be expected to carry 
forward. The importance of the catalogue and the methods of its 
preparation have been fully explained in previous reports. 

CORRESPONDENCE. 

Though the correspondence of the Institution has increased during- 
the year, it has been promptly dispatched and the routine is not in 
arrears. This correspondence embraces not oidy communications 
referring to the work of the Institution proper, t)ut also to the National 
Museum, the International Exchanges, the Bureau of American Ethnol- 
ogy, the National Zoological Park, and the Astrophysical Oljservatory. 
Such matters as require the personal attention of the Secretary, or 
relate to the business of the parent Institution are retained in the 
Institution, while comnuuiications relating to th(^ work of th(^ l)ureaus 



16 REPOKT OF THE SECRETARY. 

are referred to the proper otiicials for recommendations to the Secre- 
tary or for direct reply. 

The sj^stem of recording and distributing letters lias been unchanged 
since 1.S90, except in a few unimportant particulars. Every letter 
receives a reply, which is sent as promptl}^ as the circumstances may 
allow. The matters of inquiry are perhaps more varied and embrace 
a wider range of topics than obtains in other departments of the Gov- 
ernment. A register is kept of such letters as are of importance, in 
which is noted in each instance the date of the letter, its subject, the 
official to whom referred for attention, the date of reply, and the place 
of tiling. The letters are tiled alphabetically, with a notation of each 
on a card catalogue, giving a brief synopsis of its contents. The 
papers relating to certain special matters are kept separately in a 
series of smaller tile ))oxes. 

In preparing the correspondence involved in the distribution of pub- 
lications much labor is saved b3'the use of printed mailing cards, often 
requiring on!}' the insertion of the name and address of the person for 
whom intended. 

The correspondence relating to civil-service matters has grown 
steadih' since the bureaus of the Institution were placed under the 
©Iteration of the civil-service law in 1896, and a separate series of 
press-copy books and a separate tile of letters relating to such matters 
are kept, as well as a special tile for the reception of papers not relating 
directly to the personnel of the several bureaus. 

EXPOSITIONS. 

Buffalo and Charleston exposition.^. — The Institution audits bureaus 
participated in the Pan- American Exposition held at Butfalo from May 
1 to November I, l!>()i, and 1)}' authority of the President the exhibits 
there displayed were transferred to the South Carolina Interstate and 
West Indian Kxposition held at Charleston from December 1, 1901, 
to May 31, 1902. Dr. E. W. True, of the National Museum, was 
appointed by the Secretarj^ to represent the Institution on the board 
in charge of the Government exhibits at both these expositions, and 
his report on the Buffalo Exposition will be found in the Appendix. 

Lomxiana Parehuse E.vposition . — Congress having made an appro- 
priation for a Government building and exhibit at the exposition to 
t)e held in St. Louis in 1901, the Secretary has appointed Dr. True to 
represent the Institution and its bureaus in the preparation and 
installation of the exhibits. 

MISCELLANEOUS. 

Baird statue. — Several petitions having been presented to the 
Senate at its last session for the erection of a statue to Prof. Spencer 



REruET OF THE SECRETARY. 17 

F. Baird, the second Secretarv of this Institution, and an eminent 
naturalist, it seems proper to recall that a bill was introduced in the 
Senate on December 12, 18ST, by Senator Morrill appropriating- the 
sum of $15,000 for a statue in bronze of Professor Baird. Th(^ bill 
was referred to the Senate Couunittee on Public Buildinos suid 
Grounds, from which it was reported on December 21 of the same 
year, and passed l)y the Senate^ on February i>, 1S88. On February 13 
it was referred to the House Committee on the Library, from which 
it failed of report. 

Senator Morrill afterwards reported for the Connnittcc on Pu))lic 
Buildino-s and Grounds an amendment to the sundry ciyil bill for 1890, 
appropriating the sum al)o\e mentioned for the erection of the statue. 
The amendment was referred to the Senate Appropriations Couunit- 
tee, but was not included in the bill as reported from the conuuittee. 

The Secretary called attention to the matter in his reports for the 
years 18S1), 181)0, 1891, 1892, and 1S91, where the hope was expressed 
that the bill would receive fayorable consideration. 

I^attondl (jaJJenj of Anwrtvaii art. — A bill luiving been introduced 
in Congress at its last session for the construction of a national gal- 
lery of art, the attention of Senator Penrose, who presented the bill, 
was called to the fact that section 5.58(> of the Pe^•ised Statutes speci- 
fies, among other things, that wheneyer suitaI)lo arrangements can be 
made from tin)e to time for their reception, all objects of art l)elong- 
ing to the United States shall be deliyered to such persons as may be 
authorized by the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution to 
receiye them, and so arranged and classitied in the building erected 
for the Institution as best to facilitate their examination and study. 
In compliance with this provision of law the Institution has for many 
years maintained a collection of art objects, to which has been added 
from to time, by gift and purchase, paintings, ])ronzes, etc., though 
with its limited fund the accjuisitions by purchase have not l)een 
luunerous. It was suggested to Senatoi" Penrose that should there be 
any likelihood of the passage of the bill the Smithsonian Institution, 
which has alwa}' s concei'ned itself with art, would be the natural custo- 
dian of a national galler}-. The bill is still pending, and will prol)ably 
come up for action during the next session of Congress. 

InteTnatlowd Zoological Cong/'ess. — At the Fifth International Zoo- 
logical Congress held in Berlin, Germany, August 12-16, 1901, the 
Institution was represented In' Dr. Leoidiard Stejneger, of the National 
Museum, who reports as follows: 

The congress was opened on August 12, and lasted until August 16, 
when the delegates and members adjourned to attend the rcn-eption 
given in their honor by the High Senate of Ihunburg. It was in every 
respect a success. One of the main factors of this success was the 
unexampled interest in the congress displayed by the German Govern- 
ment. A large sum of money was placed at the disposition of the com- 

SxAi 1902 — ^2 



18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

mittee l)v the Government, and the German Crown Prince, as the high 
protector of the congress, was onlj^ prevented from opening the con- 
gress in person b}^ the death of his grandmother, the Empress Fried- 
rich, a few days previous. The congress was lavishly entertained by 
the cities of Berlin and Hamburg, as well as by the Zoological Society 
of Berlin. But the most extraordinary proof of the public interest in 
the congress was probably the fact that the entire " Ileichstagsgebaude." 
the magnificent house of the German Parliament, was placed at its dis- 
position for its meetings, lectures, etc. Thus all the general, sessions 
were held in the great '"Plenarsitsungssaal" of the Parliament. The 
Emperor himself, though prevented from receiving the members offi- 
cially on account of the death of his mother, took occasion to greet 
them informally. 

The more special object of my joining the congress was to take 
part in the deliberations and decisions of the committee on zoological 
nomenclature, of which 1 had been elected a member at the congress 
in Caml)ridge in 1898. The work in this conunittee on nomenclature 
was, on the whole, eminently satisfactory from the standpoint of 
American zoologists, though it was found impossible to lay a draft for 
a complete code for the congress at its Berlin meeting. It is hoped 
that this will be accomplished at the next congress which is to be held 
in Bern, Switzerland, in 1901. 

NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

The Museum, established in the fundamental act creating the Smith- 
sonian Institution, grew up largely from its private collections, but it 
is important to consider that now it has grown into souK^thing which 
represents more nearly the large purpose of Congress in its foundation 
and that it is becoming a "" National'' Museum. It differs from most 
other uuiseums in that its primary function was held to be not so much 
the entertainment or instruction of the resident population as the 
preservation and arrangement of the collections })rought together by 
the Government of the United States. These collections now out- 
number by some millions of specimens those which it has been possible 
to place upon exhibition in the present utterly inadequate cpaarters. 

I know that the wish of those in immediate charge of the collections 
is that they may contribute, among other important ends, to establish 
not only a real educational museum, l)ut one which will interest not 
only the inhabitants of Washington, but the great mmibers of Ameri- 
can citizens aniuially visiting the capital; but this is impossible undcu' 
the pres(Mit limitations of space and means. These exhibition features, 
then, though not the ])rimary purpose of the museum, are for the edu- 
cation and interest of all American citizens, and as accessions come in 
they require constant cliange and careful study to bring them to the 
comprehension of all Amei'icans of all ages and all grades of education. 

The definition of an educational museum made l)v the late Dr. 
(iood(>, as "a collection of well-written labels with carefullv selected 



rp:pokt of the sp:cretary. 19 

speoiniens attached." l)rino"s forward the difhciilty of the pi-eparation 
of such a museum, since to compress into a te^Y sentences, in simple 
3"et accurate lanouage, comprehensive and interestino- information 
concerning- an}' specimen presupposes a deptli of knowh'dge and a 
facility in expnvssion possessed hy but few. This task of working 
upon and improving the educational features of the nuiseum is never 
ending, and it should be so, for "*a perfect nuiseum is a finished 
museum, and a finished nuiseum is a dead museum." 

Collections placed upon exhil)ition must be constantly renewed, since 
they deteriorate by the XQvy exposure to the light. The art of taxi- 
dermy, methods of installation, the choice of colors for backgrounds, 
the style and form of lal)els all of these details, unnoticed by the casual 
visitor; matters of constant study to the expert — together form the 
whole upon which either the pleasant or unpleasant impressions car- 
ried away by the visitor depend, but all this is labor lost if they are 
in situations so crowded as to resem))le storage rather than exhil)ition 
halls. 

Excepting as to impro^'ement in these details, the National Museum, 
so far as its exhibition halls is concerned, has reached its maxinnim 
development in its ))resent (iiuirters. The Secretary has, year after 
year, continued to call attention to the serious overcrowding of the 
Museum, and in his report for last year considered the tjuestion fully. 
He is pleased to ]>e able tcj state that the special appeals made to the 
last session of Congress ])y the conmiittee of the Regents resulted in 
the passage of the following item: 

For the preparation, under the direction of the Secretary of the 
Smithsonian Institution, of preliminary plans for an additional fire- 
proof steel-frame ]>rick and terra cotta l)uilding, to cost not exceed- 
ing one million five hundred thousand dollars, for the United States 
National Museun), to ])e erected when appropriated for, on the Mall, 
between Ninth and Twelfth streets west, said plans when completed 
to be transmitted by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to 
Congress, five thousand dollars. 

And it is hoped that the erection of a building may be authorized by 
the next Congress. This is not the place to discuss the recpiirements 
of such a building. In the course of the next session of Congress a 
detailed statement will be laid before that body indicating the needs, 
both for exhibition, storage, laboratory, and the numerous othei' 
accessories which go to make up a great modern museum. A^ast as 
have been the improvements in the erection of museums in the past 
twenty years, the ideal standard of building, in which all the requisite 
features are adequately provided for, has not yet been created in any 
country in the world. It can hardly be expected that the sum indi- 
cated in the above item would Ix; sufficient to supply perfect intei'ior 
arrangements for exhibition and working purposes, coupled with that 



20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

dignity of extoricn- which has come to he associated with the buildings 
erected ])}" the Government of the United States. 

The Secretary lias, howevei', frequently adverted to the fact that 
it is not bricks and mortar, nor, even, cases and specimens that 
make the museum, but (more important than these) the learning and 
enthusiasm of the men who ])ring together and classify and describe 
these collections. Of such men there is an inadequate numl)er, and 
all are inadetpiately paid, AVhile w^ages of laborers and mechanics 
and the cost of living to all men have advanced by leaps and bounds, 
the salaries of the scientific staft' of the Government, and more 
especially of the Museum, have to a great extent been kept at a 
stationary level. The increase in the number of museums, the increase 
in the nund)er of colleges and universities, the increase in their endow- 
ments have all put a premimn, as it were, upon the services of men of 
the first raidv, and it is the real devotion of the Museum statf, and not 
the pecuniary reward which they have received, that has preserxed 
to the Government the services of this distinguished, zealous, and 
effective, but wholly underpaid body of men. 

The best of the scientific staff of the Museum are retained not 
merely l)y the unselfishness of their interest in science, l)ut ])ecause 
they can remain there without the duties of tuition, which attach to 
higher salaries that they can receive in colleges. But they ean not 
be expected to remain indefinitely when so much better terms are 
being daily held out to them elsewhere. 

The Secretary has repeatedly drawn the attention of Congress to 
the need of the ]VIuseum for an increase in the item under ''preserva- 
tion of collections'' for the purpose of making at least small advances 
in the salaries of the stall', and in the estimates submitted this 3'ear he 
has d(>terniined to sacritice needed improvements in many directions 
with the hope that, on this single item. Congress ma}" see its way clear 
to appro\-e his reconuuendation. 

To relie\e the congestion in some of the most crowded exhibition 
halls, and to permit the display of a few more of the objects taken 
from storage. Congress authorized the construction of galleries which 
have also been found well adapted as temporary lal)oratories in sev- 
eral de[)artments, and for extension of the Museum library. 

The innnl»er of specimens received during the year was al)Out 
450, 000, ]naking the total number of objects nearly five and a half mil- 
lion. The more im])ortant additions and general details concerning 
the several departments are given in an appendix in the report of the 
Assistant Seci-ctary.

KEPORT OF THE SECKETARY. 21 

J. W. Powell, Direc-tor, by means of the usual Congressional ajipro- 
priation, the formal plan of operations ha\ in^- been a])|)i'o\('<l hy the 
Secretary of the Institution. 

The work of the Bureau has related largely to a study of tho orioin, 
physical and mental characteristics, arts and industries, food suppl}"^ 
social and political institutions, religions, and languages of these tri1)es. 

A considerable share of attention has been given to distinctly pi-ac- 
tical questions — relating to the jiborigines — to ti'ibal <listri])ution, to 
subsequent movements and locations of the tri))es, to th(^ law s relating 
to their welfare and their relations to the (Tovernment, to trcati(vs, to 
cessions and recessions of territory. 

It has seemed desirabl(> for many years that thcrc^ should )>c arranged 
and pu])lished in some methodical form an cncv(dopedia or dictionar}' 
of Indian tri])es for which nuich material has been accunudated, and 
wdiich it has been intended should present a complete account of them 
as grouped by linguistic stocks. This is expected to prove of great 
service to Congress. and to public men generally, as well as to institu- 
tions of learning, l)ut in view of the time which this great work ma}' 
be expected to take, the innuediate })reparation and pid)lication of a 
dictionary of ready refi^rence to all that is most useful in th(> past 
work of the Bureau has ])een determined upon as the most necessary 
publication and work of the Bureau in th(^ inunediate futur(\ 

Field work was conducted l>y the regular force of the Pmreau in 
Alaska, Arizona. California, and in several other Steites and Territo- 
ries, as also in British Colum])ia, Mexico, Greenland, and in Porto 
Rico, while usefid information and material was ol)tained from corre- 
spondents and special collal)orators. Special attention was devoted to 
a study of those a])original industries which appeai'ed to 1)ear practictd 
relations to modern life, particularly to aboriginal methods of house 
building and ii-rigation. and to food sources in those tropical and arid 
regions that formerly sustained a population live to tiMi times larger 
than at the present day. A noteworthy investigation of aboriginal 
industries was conducted in Porto Kico, and a special report of the 
native resources of that island is in preparation. 

A special stud}" was made of a ceremony among the Pawnee Indians 
embracing songs of interest in the de\'elopm(Mit of music; and poetry, 
and to early phases of the drama. th(^ memoii- being acconi])ariied bv 
the primitive music recordf^l. b\- the aid of the graphophone, and with 
j)hot()graphs of movements and obj(H'ts inti'oduced in the cei'emonv. 

A notable collection of chipped im])lements, teeth and bones of an 
extinct elephant, together with a nnnarkable series of teetli and hones 
of the mastodon, besides remains of buffalo, deer, horse, and other 
animals of the historic period, Avas obtained from a si)ring in ihr north- 
eastern Indian Territory. The association of fossil r(Muains with human 
implements was puzzling until a critical examination by Mr. W. II. 
Holmes, veritied'tln-ough the memory of an aged Indian chief, indicated 



22 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

that the spring was a shrine at which a))orig-inal luinters accumulated 
votive offerings. 

Other researches were carried on and several publications were 
prepared, as mentioned in detail in the Appendix. 

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES. 

The objects and methods of the International Exchange Service 
were so fully explained in the Secretary's report for last year that it 
seems unnecessary to again refer to them further than to say that the 
service is the medium of exchange of the official pul>lications of the 
United States Government with the governments of the larger foreign 
powers of the world, and also the medium of exchange between the 
principal scieutiffc institutions and libraries of the world. 

The maintenance of the American ])ranch of the service is now met 
in the main by Government appro})riations, though the Smithsonian 
Institution continues to bear a considera})le share of the expenses. 

During the last fiscal year there was handled an aggregate of 
125,T!M) packages, weighing 3i)6,41S pounds, the packages sent abroad 
num])ering 87,149 and those received from foreign countries 88,647. 
The various classes of exchanges and other details of the service are 
explained in detail in the report of the Acting Curator in the Appendix. 

It lias long seemed desirable to establish more adequate exchange 
relations with Japan and China, but efforts in that direction have so 
far been without success. In Great Britain, Germany, and Austria- 
Hungary it is still necessary to employ salaried agents to carry on the 
work, the Governments of those countries for various reasons not yet 
having organized international exchange bureaus. 

Congress having made a slight increase in the annual appropriation, 
it has l)een possible to considerably improve the service by sending 
packages l)y fast express steamers rather than by the slow lines, an 
advantage* nuu/h appreciated by all concerned, for in these days of 
rapid transit on sea and land the literary, scientific, and political world, 
as well as the l)usiness world, is eager to participate in all the advan- 
tages of ({uick transportation. 

Five years ago, in 181*7, the total num])er of correspondents or par- 
tici[)aiits in tlie exchange service was 28.008, while tlu* aggregate has 
now I'eached ;-58,200 addresses of libraries and individuals in 151: coun- 
tries scattered all oxer the civilizi^l world, (nen in some of the 
i'emot(\st corners ol' India, Asia, Australia, and Polynesia. 

The general l)enetit of the service to the scientific world can hardly 
be measured. Largely as a result of these international exchanges 
there has accunudat(>d in the Library of Congress a mass of scientific 
and (Jovernment i)ubliciiti(>ns that is [)i"obably not surpassed anywhere, 
and which could scarcely have been secured in any other way. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23 

NATIONAL /AKnAHilCXL PARK. 

The iiiiportiincc anil interest of the National Zoological Park, under 
the care of the Regents, is constantly increasing, the total luunlxM- of 
\ isitors for the past year l)eing estimated at nearly a million, the num- 
ber on single days having se\'eral times passed 8(>,00(). 

The Secretary has in pi-e\ious years called the attention of the 
Regents to the want of a Congressional appropriation for collecting 
and preserving some of the great land and marine sptM-imtMis of our 
Western territory now rapidly a])proaching extini-tion. and he again 
urges the immediate need of doing something, e\'en on the smallest 
scale, before it is entirely too late. He hopes that Congress may he 
asked to provide the means to meet these wants by the establishment 
of at least two small stations or ranches in Alaska, one in the interior, 
where may l)e secured specimens of the great moose, the great bear, 
and other disappearing animals o^ the land fauna; the other '"'ranch" 
to be on the coast for the collection of the walrus, the sea otter, the 
great sea lion of Steller, and other important \anishing marine species. 

The animals in the National Zoological Park at the close of the fiscal 
3^ear included oOd mammals, 2313 l)irds, and 14.') reptiles. The acces- 
sions of the year numbered 314. More than half of these accessions 
were gifts to the (irovernment, several of the most interesting animals 
having l)eeu secured through the cooperation of United States consuls 
and other oliicials. A tine specimen of grizzly bear, also some ante- 
lope, deei", elk, and ciimamon ]»ears wero received from the Yellowstone 
National Park. 

The native game, everywhere })lentv when the needs of the j)ark 
were first submitted to Congress, has grown so nearly inaccessi))le 
that only after years of etfort have there at last been procured a sin<';le 
young male specimen of the great Kodiak bear and two big horn or 
Rocky Mountain slice}). 

The priiicii)al improvements to the park, mentioned in detail in the 
report of the superintendent on a subsequent page, include the com- 
pletion of the large Hying cage, an addition to the temporary bird 
house, and an extension or comj)letion of some of the roadways. 
Work was begun on a new ele})liant housi^ for which Congress at its 
last session made an appropriation of Si 0,000. 

Among the present needs of the park, after that for securing native 
gam(% are ade(}uat(^ provision for housing tropical mammals, an aijua 
rium, a rejjtile house, an aviary for small terrestrial birds, iind, foi" the 
wolves and foxes, which are now in temporary quarters, permanent 
pens from wdifch they may be imable to escape. 

There is no department of the park in which the public takes more 
interest than in the aquarium, for, notwithstanding the imperfect char- 
acter of the installation, the tanks being set up in a mere temporary 



24 REPOET OF THE SECRETARY. 

.shed, it is always frequented by visitors. It would undoubtedly be 
desirable to g-reatly extend and perfect this collection, so that the pul)- 
lic niio-ht more completely realize the multifarious living- forms that 
are found in the waters al)out our coasts, as well as in our rivers and 
lakes. In order to do this properly a suita))le building should be 
provided and litted with permanent tanks, heating and refrigerating 
apparatus, and open pools. 

The educational value of an exhibit of this character would unques- 
tionaldy bo very great. Land animals are more commonly seen, and 
therefore do not excite the wonder that do those creatures that live in 
an element by which they are most wholly screened from view. The 
life of the waters is therefore always extremely interesting and sur- 
prising. 

A zoological collection, viewed in its widest extent, can not be said 
to be complete while failing to exhibit so large and important a portion 
of the zoological domain. The l)iological sciences are becoming more 
and more studied in our schools,.and it is well known that the simpler 
forms of invertebrates are extremely impoi'tant as an introduction to 
the knowledge of higher forms. Classes from the schools of this city 
and elsewhere often visit the park and find great profit in the aquariimi 
exhil)it, even in its present incomplete state. It is hoped that Congress 
may grant funds for establishing in the park an aquarium on a proper 
scale. 

The park is fulfilling sucessfully the objects for which Congress cre- 
ated it, "The advancement of science and the instruction and recreation 
of the people." It never has I)een so successful in these as it is to-day. 

thp: astrophysical observatoky. 

In appropriating in the sundry civil act, approved March 3, 1901, 
the sum of $12,000 for the maintenance of the Astrophysical Observa- 
tory, under the control of the Smithsonian Institution, during the 
fiscal 3^ear ending June 30, 1902, Congress added the following words: 

That the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution is directed to 
report to Congress on the first day of the next regular session an entire 
account of all appropriations heretofore expended by the Astrop,hys- 
ical Observatory, what results have been reached, and what is the 
pr<\s(Mit condition of the work of said Observator}', 

In response to this requirement the Secretary submitted a report 
embracing (I) an entire account of all a])propriations heretofore 
expended by the Astrophysical 0))servatory, (2) a statement of the 
results which have been reached, and (3) the present condition of the 
work of said Observ^atory, and including as a part of it the first vol- 
ume of its Annals. This report was accompanied by letters from Sir 
Robert Ball, Sir William lluggins. Lord Kelvin, Sir Norman Lockyer, 



REPORT OF THE SiKCRKTAUY. 25 

Lord Rayleigh, Sir George Stokes, and other (Miiineiit foreign men of 
science, whose ap})reeiation could not ))e charged Avitli being inHucnced 
by national prejudice, as Avell as by ei^ually disinterested AniiM'ican 
ones, all showing a very gratifying approbation of the work of the 
Observatory ])y those best competent to judge its merits. 

The principal work of the Astrophysical Observatory during the 
past 3'ear has continued to l)e the study of the sun and its radiation. 
While fully acknowledging the interesting nsiture of astr()[)hysical 
investigation of the stars and nebuhe, the study of the sun h'.is a far 
superior practical importance, for were the former ])odies to bcAvholly 
blotted out they would be missed chiefly as ()])jects of scientitic inter- 
est, while with the sun would l)e abolished life itself. The solar 
researches of the past year have mainly ])een concerned with deter- 
mining the amount and nature of the absorption of solar I'adiation in 
the earth's atmosphere and in the solar envelope. These researches 
are preliminaiy to and form an essential part of the measurement of 
the total radiation of the sun. A presumption exists, almost amount- 
ing to certainty, that the total radiation of the sun is vai'iable in some 
relation to the appearance of sun spots, l)ut nothing is yet known to 
definitely flx the amount of this supposed varial)ility or to measure 
its effect upon the earth, though that effect, if so iixed. can not but be 
of interest to every inha])itant of the earth's surface. 

The instrumental means, which thus have been the sul)ject of inces- 
sant study and improvement here during the past ten years, for inves- 
tigating such questions, are more efficient than at an}' previous time. 
It will l^e seen from the detailed report of the aid acting in charge that 
automatic bolometric curves accurately representative of the amount 
and distribution of the solar energy at the observer's station may now 
be obtained in a few minutes, covering nearly the whole spectral region 
which reaches sea level, and wdiere occurs nuich of the great and 
varying absorption ])y water vapor which influences oui' terrestrial 
temperatures so greatly. 

Some twenty 3^ears ago the writer invented a then new instrument 
for measuring minute quantities of heat, for, owing to circumstances 
which this is not the place to detail, an accurate determination of the 
possil)le variation in the enormous quantities of heat which the sun 
sends the earth depends (paradoxically) upon the ability to measure 
smaller (|uantities of heat than the most delicate thermometer can 
possibly do. The " bol<)met(u-," tin* instrument of tlu^ writiM-'s inven- 
tion, which is in rjuestion, was abh' to measure the tiiiMi unheard of 
([uantit}^ of somewhat moi-e than one one-hundred-thousandth of a 
degree. Since thcMi, during fifteen years of constant advance, latterly 
associated with a great improvement of the adjuncts, particularly of 
the galvonomet(>r, at the hands of Mr. Abbot, this has been brought 
to measure somewhat less than one one-hundred-millionth of a degree. 



26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, 

and this almost intinitesimal amount is disting-uishod with readiness 
and precision. It is this increased precision which is associated with 
all the improvements in the work of the year here described. 

It is the variability of the absorption of our air which now offers 
the greatest difficulty to the work. The Secretary cherishes the hope 
that a solar observatory will one day be established high in a clear and 
dry air, whose chief aim shall be to solve the questions of the amount 
of radiation of the sun, the changes in this total amount, and the con- 
sequences of such changes on the earth. 

The interest of this solar stud}^ is peculiar among all the subjects of 
astronomical research, for it is not only a scientific but a utilitarian 
interest of such high importance that it has among its remote possibili- 
ties the forecasting of the coming seasons and harvests, and of conditions 
immediately practical, from those which affect the price of the laborer's 
dinner up to those which, to use the weight}' words of Professor New- 
comb, may bring to light not merely interesting cosmical processes, but 
"cosmical processes pregnant with the destiny of our race,"" 

In connection with these researches it has proved necessary to 
obtain a large solar image as free as possible from defects of definition 
and unequal absorption. One of the most formidable of these defects 
is that which astronomers call " boiling.'" This consists of an apparent 
wavy and rolling motion over the image, and is due to momentary 
differences of density of the air in the path of the beam. It has 
hitherto been sought (with little effect) to control this by keeping the 
air in the tube as still as possible. 

I am nmch interested in a new plan which I have myself proposed, 
that of thoroughly and incessantly stirring this air column even while 
the rays forming the telescopic image are passing through it. This 
experiment of stirring the air has been tried during the past few 
months at the Observatory, and has resulted in the discovery that by 
vigorously churning the column of air traversed by the solar beam 
from a point about 50 feet above the apparatus to the point where the 
image is formed, the paradoxical result is reached that this image itself 
becomes nearly tran(|uil, and that thus the "boiling" can be nearly 
all eliminated. It is hoped that this very important observation will 
prove useful to astronomers generally. 

For details of the work of the Observatory, including many inter- 
esting su])jects in addition to those I have mentioned, the reader is 
referred to the rejMirt of the aid acting in charge, which appears in 
the Appendix.

APPENDIX TO THE SECRETARY'S REPORT. 



Appendix I. 
Rp]PORT ON THE ITNITED STATES NATIONAL MTTSEUM. 

iSik: I liave the honi)r to .submit the following rej^ort on the condition and opera- 
tions of the National Museum during the ypar ending June 30, 1902: 

Though having as its primary function the preservation and classification of the 
Government collections, tlie National ]\Iuseum is best known to the publii' l)y its 
educational features, the most obvious of these being the illustration of nature and 
of the arts of man by means of carefully selected series of o])jects appropriately 
lal)eled and arranged in its exhi])ition halls in the city of Washington. Its educa- 
tional work, however, reaches out to all parts of the country through tlie distribu- 
tion of its duplicate sjiecimens and the dissemination of knowledge through its 
publications and by its correspondence. The collections have long since outgrown 
the accommodations provided for them, and for some years the bulk of the material 
received has gone into storage. It is, therefore, very gratifying to note the dispo- 
sition of Congress, manifested at its last session, to grant funds for the erection ()f a 
new building. 

The accessions during the past year have increased the total number of specimens 
to above 5,000,000. Besides this, nearly 700 lots of specimens were sent to the 
Mu.seum from all parts of the country for identification and report, and several thou- 
sand letters asking for information on scientific subjects have been received and 
answered. 

There has been a large increase over former years in the amount of duplicate 
material distributed as gifts to educational establishments and sent out in exchange 
for an equivalent return, the total numlter of specimens so disposinl of having 
exceeded 30,000. In addition to the routine duties connected with the care and 
classification of the collections, much imi)ortant scientific work has been accom- 
plished ])y the Museum staff, and the facilities of the Museum for conducting 
researches have been availed of by many persons not connected with the establish- 
ment. Over 6,000 specimens were als(j lent to specialists for study at their own 
laboratories. 

The number of persons who visited the IMuseum during the year was 173,888. 

lluUdin<j>f. — Tlic INIuseum occupies for its various purposes the greater part of the 
Smith.sonian building, the adjacent large brick building, erected about 1880 for its 
special use, parts of three detached l)uildings on the Smithsonian and Armory reser- 
vations, and several rented buildings south of r> street SW. The Smithsonian and 
]Museum buildings are mainly filled with the exhiljition collections, but contain also 
the oftices and laboratories and the reference and study collections, .so far as it has 
been i)Ossible io accommodate them. The preparators' workrooms and the general 
storage are mostly outside. 

The reports for many years iuive, called attention to the overcrowding in every 
branch of the Museum. In some of the exhibition halls there are scarcely passage- 
ways for visitors between the cases; the reserve series of specimens comprising the

chief scientific wealth of the collections are, to a great extent, barely accessible and 
their proper arrangement generally impossible; and the laboratories are mostly too 
small to permit of laying out specimens in course of study or in preparation for dis- 
play. More serious, however, has been the necessity during many years past of stor- 
ing very considerable parts of the collections in unsafe buildings, where they are 
constantly liable to destruction by fire and certain to deteriorate, being buried 
beyond the possibility of suitable care or inspection. It is therefore pleasing to note 
that at its last session Congress voted $5,000 for the preparation of preliminary plans 
for a new building, which when completed should not only relieve this congested 
condition, but also enable the Museum to develop its educational features and con- 
duct its activities in a manner more creditable to the nation. 

Several important alterations and improvements have been made in the Museum 
building. Some additional space has been gained through the construction of gal- 
leries in three ranges— the west-north, the north-west, and the south-west, which are 
being fitted up for the library and as laboratories for the departments of anthropology 
and geology. 

The steam boilers, which had become entirely worn-out after a service dating from 
the erection of the building, have been rejalaced by a pair of high-pressure boilers of 
modern pattern, with capacity for heating both buildings. The introduction (jf 
these made it necessary to overhaul the entire heating plant and to make new and 
more ample connections with the Smithsonian building. The boilers formerly used 
in the latter building will be retained in place to guard against emergencies, and the 
employment of one set instead of two is expected to result in the economy of both 
fuel and labor. 

The installation of a complete sj-stem of electric-light wiring and lixtures extend- 
ing to all the exhibition halls as well as to tlie offices, laboratories, and storerooms, 
begun the previous year, was finished satisfactorily. Should it be decided to open 
the building at night, however, an increased appropriation will be required to cover 
the cost of extra current and the pay of several additional attendants. 

The quarters allotted to the purposes of a lunch room have l)een somewhat extended 
and improved, but this very desirable museum adjunc-t must always remain i')oorly 
provided for in the i)resent building. 

Organization and staff. — The organization of the museum comprises an administra- 
tive oftice and three scientific departments, as follows: Anthropolog}', with 8 divi- 
sions and 4 sections; piology, with 9 divisions and 12 sections; and Geology, with 3 
divisions and 3 sections. 

Besides the three head curators in charge of the departments, the scientific staff at 
the close of the year consisted of 17 curators, 12 assistant curators, 14 custodians, 11 
aids, 4 associates, and 2 collaborators, making a total of 63 persons, of Avhom, how- 
ever, oiily about one-half received compensation from the Museum. Of the re- 
mainder, who are serving in a volunteer or honorary (•ai>acity, the majority were 
attached to other scientific bureaus of the Government. 

The death of Dr. Thomas Wilson, which occurred on May 4, 1902, di'privcd the 
Museum of one of its mo.st earnest and helpful workers. Widely distinguished for 
his studies and contrilnitions on a variety of anthropological subjects. Dr. Wilson's 
interests lay chiefly in the field of prehistoric arclueology, and from 1889 he had 
charge of the extensive and important collections of this division of the Museum. 

Mr. William V. (4)x, who was appointed to the Museum in 1879, and has been its 
chief clerk since 18SG, witli inqtortant duties in connection with all the recent exjK)- 
sitions in which the Governincnt lias ))articipated, severed his official relation^ witli 
the Museum in February, 1902, greatly to the regret of his associates, to accept a 
more responsible position elsewhere. The duties of this office have been somewhat 
modified to Ix'tter consolidate the administrative work, and the title of its chief

officer luisi Ixvu clianjied to administrative assistant. This position was lilled ]>\ the 
a|)pointment of Mr. AV. de C. Ra,venel, previously the assistant in charge oi tish cul- 
ture in the United States Fisli Commission, who has joined to a long experience in 
the administrative work of thaj, Bureau a familiarity with the preparation and instal- 
lation of Government exhibits. 

Mr. George B. Turner has been inaile chief taxidermist and I\Ir. W. ('. Plialen an 
aid in the Department of Geology. 

AiJiJidons to the collections. — The collections of tlie Museum were increased iluring 
the year to the extent of over 4iS,000 sjiecimens, bringing the total number of sjieci- 
mens in its possession up to more than 5,400,000. The additions were received in 
1,409 sej)arate lots or accessions. 

Among the important contriliutions in the Department of Anthmpology were a 
quantity of baskets, weapons, ornaments, and parts of costumes collected by Dr. 
AV. L. Abbott in the Andaman and Xicoliar islands, and many filijects, including 
crania, native clothing, lam]>s, and articles connected with the industries of the 
Eskimo, obtained in northern Greenland and Ellesmere Land by I\Ir. Roliert Stein, 
of the T'nitcd States (ieological Survey, during his Arctic expedition. A muubcr of 
Guatemalan costumes and of objects illustrating the first steps in tlie weaving of cot- 
ton as practiced in that countrj^ as well as other ethnological material, were received 
from Airs. Alarj' W. ()wen, of Panzos, Guatemala. Two interesting donations were 
a series of weapons captured during the Philippine insurrection, including several 
FiHi)ino swords of tlie ordinary type, some bolos, and a kris, from Alaj. E. L. Hawks, 
U. s. Volunteers; and a collection consisting principally of the differ(?nt types of punal 
de kris, a weapon carried liy the women and children m the Philippine Islands, 
together witli a device formerly used in tlie Philippine army for decapitating wounded 
soldiers, from Dr. \^'. (". Warmsley, of Norwich, Gonn. Another Philippine collec- 
tion, secured by purchase from Air. J. N. Harkins, of Galhoun, Ga., comprises weapons, 
cooking utensils, tobacco boxes, charm belts, models of boats, newspapers, statuettes, 
and t'oins. 

A collection of choice objects l)r(iught together l>y the late Dr. (J. Brown Goode, 
and secured during the year, in hides musical instruments, Japanese porcelains, 
domestic utensils, gand)ling devices, plsques, vases, an incense 1)0x, old Kutani 
ware, Alarcusi ware, Gloisonn<'> plates and bowls, trays, English cliinaware, and 
ironstone china from Ciiina. Other additions to the collection of musical instru- 
ments were a small series of instruments used liy ihe American Indians, and st'veral 
from European countries, including a nyckleliarpa, ol)tained liy exchange from 
Airs. .1. Crosby lirown, of Orange, N. .1.; and 78 pieces, comprising instruments of 
the Javanese, Chinese, Thibetans, Japanese and Persians; Syrian and Egyj)tian 
kettledrums, a Turkish mandolin, etc., presented by Dr. Ryan Devereaux, U. S. Army. 

A complete set of the gold and silver coins of Siam, and a series of Spanish coins 
minted in Alexii'o and the Philippine Islands, embracing the various kinds issued l)y 
Spain for us(^ in its colonics, were obtained by purchase. 

Loan collections, chiefly of historical interest, received on deposit and exhibited in 
the main Aluseum hall, were as follows: Eighty-two relics of Colonial times, and a 
gold watch w<irii by (ieorge Fayette Washington, a nejihew of George Washington, 
from the National Society of Colonial Dames; relu's of the Revolutionary War, 
including commissions in the Continental Army, from the Daughters of the American 
Revolution; several swords that had belonged to the late Rear Admiral J. W. Philip, 
IT. S. Navy, one presented by the children of Texas, another by the citizens of New 
York City, from Airs. Philip; six swords belonging to Rear Admiral R. D. Evans, 
U. S. Navy, including one presented by the State of Iowa, and one by the crew of 
the battleship louxi; and 21 guns captured at Tientsin, China, comprising the various 
types of European and American manufacture now employed in the Chinese army,

from (lol. W. n. Carter, U. 8. Army. A desk and quadrant used ])y Dr. C. F. Hall, 
on his Fularis Arctic Expedition, were received as a gift from Miss Anne S. Hall, of 
Cincinnati, Ohio. 

Among the important accessions in archseology were the collection of liint imple- 
ments, hone utensils, and remains of extinct and recent mammals resulting from the 
examination of a sulphur spring at Afton, Ind. T., hy Mr. W. H. Holmes, and a 
very large amount of material, comprising pottery, implements of stone, wood and 
shell, hones and human remains, obtained hy Dr. Walter Hough during his investi- 
gations in Arizona, partly in conjunction with Mr. Peter G. Gates. 

About 10,000 prehistoric objects from Georgia, including carvings, spearheads, pol- 
ished stone hatchets, and other articles of stone, ivory, and pottery, were acquired 
from Dr. Roland B. Steiner. A collection of the implements used by the ancient 
inhabitants of Columbia County, Pa. , consisting of stone articles of domestic utility, 
stone hatchets, banner stones, arrow points, and spearheads, was presented by Mr. 
Charles Hunnnel, of Espey, Pa., and a large series of prehistoric objects from the 
Potomac Valley was obtained by purchase. 

Among the accessions in archteology from other countries were over 600 specimens 
of prehistoric vases, stone figures, carvings and polished instruments, and figures and 
dishes in earthenware from Mexico, received from Mr. E. 0. Matthews; material 
from tlie guano caves of Las Cruces, New Mexico, contributed by Mr. J. R. De Mier; 
an image, mortar and pestle of stone, from Porto Rico, presented by Mr. Henry Bird, 
and a series of flint implements and bones from the cavern of Kesserlock, Schaff- 
hausen, Switzerland, donated by Prof. J. Heierli, of the University of Zurich. 

The additions to tlie technological collections include several of historical value, 
such as pieces of apparatus devised and used by Dr. Elisha Gray in his experiments 
with harmonic multiple telegraphy and with the telephone, received from IVIrs. 
Gray; one of the tin-foil records made by Edison's first phonograph when exhibited 
before the National Academy of Sciences at the Smithsonian Institution in 1878, con- 
tributed by Mr. William J. Rhees; a number of electric lighting and telephone 
devices, and one of the early forms of typewriting machines. 

In the Department of Biology the collections sent by Dr. W. L. Abbott from the 
East Indies, consisting principally of mammals, birds, reptiles, and insects, formed 
the most important zoological accessions. Of mammals there were 848 specimens, 
including many new species, from the islands of Andaman, Nicobar, Linga, Sinkep, 
Johore, and others farther eastward; of birds, over 700 specimens, and of rei)tiles, a 
considerable number. The region visited by Dr. Al)bott is in large part a new field, 
not previously represented in the National Museum, and the generous contributions 
from this indefatigable explorer give the INIuseum a collection from this region 
which is al)Solutely unrivaled. • 

Other specimens of mannnals received, deserving of mention, were a tine skeleton 
of the huge Kodak (Alaska) bear, from Mr. J. II. Kidder, of Boston; African ante- 
lopes and monkeys from Dr. A. Donaldson Smith, of Philadelphia; many skulls of 
moose, elk, and other deer from Mr. Ernest Thompson-Seton of New York; and a 
large series of small mammals from Germany and of s(]uirrels from Asia. 

Among ornithological material were about 300 Cuban and Porto Rican birds, col- 
lected by Mr. B. S. Bowdish; a quantity of Cuban birds collected by Mr. William 
Palmer; a scries of East Indian birds from the Royal Museum of Natural History at 
Leiden, Holland; a larger number of l>razilian birds from the Museu Paulista at Sao 
Paulo, Brazil; besides smaller collections from Mexico, Cocos Island, Hawaii, and 
(Jreat Britain. Several rare species of birds' eggs were obtained. 

The reptilian collection was enriclie<l by the iield work in Cuba and I'orto Rico of 
Mr. B. S. Bowdish and INIr. William Talmer. Specimens were also received from 
Japan, Sumatra, and the I'hilippine Islands.

The Divinidn of Fishe;? was fortunate in securing, tlirougli Messrs. Anderson and 
Priee, of Orniond, Fla., tht^ skin (jf a whale shark {Rlihiodon), 18 feet long, the first 
of its kind recorded as being taken ifi the North Atlantic Ocean. The Leland Stan- 
ford Junior University presented the types of a large numher of Jajianese Hshes 
described by Dr. David 8. Jordan, and also specimens from Panama, Cocos Island, 
and the ( Jalapagos Islands. A colit'ction of Egyptian fishes from tlie Nile was con- 
tributed l)y Dr. Bashford Dean, of (olund)ia University, and interesting material 
from several sources was transmitted by the United States Fish Commission. 

Twelve sj)ecies of land shells from (V)t'os Island, cotyjK's of s[)ecies described in 
E. von Marten's work on the moUusksof that locality, were donated by Mr. William 
H. Dall. Some 2,000 shells from Lower California were received from Lieut. ('. A. 
Clarke, U. S. Navy, and a number of new species of North .Vmerican laml sliells 
from .Mr. J. H. Ferris, of Joliet, 111. 

The largest addition to till' Division of Insects comprised about 65,000 specimens 
collected by Mr. E. A. Sclnvaiz, custodian of the coleoptera in the Museum, in Ari- 
zona, at his own expense, and by him ju'esentcil to the national collections. The 
Museum was already indebted to this generous friend for tlie gift of his extensive 
private collection previously formed. Some 7,0ll0 insects of several groups were 
brought from the Hawaiian Islands by Mr. W. 11. Ashmead, and 10,000 specimens 
of lepidoiitera froni Colorado by Dr. II. < i. Dyar, assisted l)y Mr. A. N. Caudell. The 
expeditions on which this material was secured are referred to elsewhere. Ten 
thou.^and beautifully prepared specimens of Imtterflies, mainly from Mexico and 
Central America, have l)eeu deixisited in the Museum Ity ]Mr. \\'illiani Schaus, of 
Twickenham, England. 

The Division of Marine Inverte))rates received from the United States I'^ish Com- 
mission a series of Porto Kit-an sj)onges, identified by Dr. II. X. Wilson, of the 
University of North Carolina; echini and holothurians fnjm tlie same locality, iden- 
tified liy Prof. n. L. Clark, of Olivet C(jllege; the crustaceans and echinoderms col- 
lected during the expedition < if 1901 to the Hawaiian Islands; and a quantity of material 
from the marine station at Woods Hole, Mass. The extensive collection of corals 
made some years ago at the Philii)pine Islands by Prof. J. B. Steere and Prof. Dean C 
Worcester was obtained by purchase. Among the smaller accessions of imj)ortance 
were a (luantity of marine invertebrates from EUesmere Land, collected by ]Mr. Robert 
Stein; a series of the cave crustaceans of Kentucky and Tennessee from Prof. W. P. 
LLay; a nund)er of Alaskan crustaceans from Mr. K. S. Mc(4regor, of the U. S. Coast 
Survey steamer I'lifliJhK'rr: and samples of the Atlantic sea-Iiottom from the United 
States Navy. 

Through the generous bequest of Dr. Charles Mohr, of Asheville, N. C, who died 
in July, 1901, -the Division of Plants became possessed of his entire collection of fiow- 
ering plants, comprising more than 18,000 specimens, chiefly from the southern 
United States. Two years previously Dr. INIohr had presented to the Museum his 
collection of about 3,000 specimens of cryi)togamic plants from the same region. 
From his trip to Central America during the summer of 1901 'Slv. J. N. Rose brought 
back a large number of plants, including specimens from Mount Orizaba and Mount 
Popocatepetl, and also some living plants, which were dcpositefl in the greenhouse of 
the Department of Agriculture. A valuable collection from China and the Phili|)- 
pine Islands was I'ontributed by the Royal Botanic (iardens of Kew, luigland; over 
6,000 plants from various parts of the United States and from r>ra/.ii, (iuatemala, 
Mexico, and Porto Rico were transmitted l)y the Department of .\griculture; and 
about 4,200 (!hinese plants were acipiired by luan^hase. 

In the De})artment of (leology the ac(;essions have been mnncrous, and in some of 
its divisions of more than ordinary importance. Among the nx'ks and ores trans- 
mitted by the United States (ieological Survey were many specimens illustrative of

its recent explorations in Colorado, ^Montana, and Oregon. A large quantity of ore 
samples from the United States exhibit at the Paris Exposition of 1900 was turned 
over to the Museum by the Government Board. The minerals added to the collec- 
tion comprise many varieties, a number of which Avere not previously rejaresented. 
Especially worthy of mention are a fine specimen of native tellurium from Delamar, 
Nev. ; a magnificent mass of moss gold on quartz from the "Miner's Dream" mine. 
Old Chester district, California; characteristic samples of Alaskan gold; fine speci- 
mens of molybdenite from Okanogan County, Wash. ; axinite from Switzerland and 
Japan; beautiful crystals of tourmaline from Mesa Grande, Cal. ; and zeolites from 
Golden, Colo. Following are the new species obtained : Narsarsukite, jjercylite, yttro- 
cerite, picroallumogene, bornite (in crystals), espistolite, plumboferrite, ankylite, 
sulvanite, thalenite, elpidite, and lossenite. Fine specimens of tourmaline and ame- 
thyst were received as a gift from Dr. L. T. Chamberlain, honorary custodian of gems 
and precious stones. 

The meteorite collection was increased during tlie year to the extent of 29 falls, 
and now comprises specimens representing a total of 356 distinct falls. The most 
valuable addition was a stony iron meteorite from Admire, Ivans. The sources of 
other important specimens were as follows: Misshof, Courla"nd, Russia; Rafriiti, 
Switzerland; Cereseti, Piedmont, Italy; St. Mesmin, Salles, and Lacon, France; Sao 
Juliao de Moreira, Portugal; Limerick, Ireland; Shalka, Bengal, India; Rhine Villa, 
South Australia; Weston, Conn.; Algoma, Wis.; iMonroe, N. C. ; Tombi2;bee, Ala.; 
Tonganoxie and Kiowa County, Ivans. ; and San Angelo and Kendall County, Tex. 

In invertebrate paleontology there were several very large and important addi- 
tions. Some 15,000 specimens, including 10,000 brachiopods, 4,200 bryozoans, many 
cretaceous forms from New Jersey, and cystids and crinoids from Marjdand, com- 
jwsing the private collection of Mr. Charles Schuchert, assistant curator of strati- 
graphic paleontology, were donated by him to the Museum. Prof. George M. Perdew 
also presented his entire collection of Silurian and Devonian fossils, about 1,300 spei'i- 
mens, from Cumberland, ]\Id. The E. O. Ulrich collection of Ostracoda, containing 
about 5,000 specimens, and the type and figured specimens of 100 species, was 
acquired by purchase. The transmissions from the Geological Survey included 
3,755 specimens of Cambrian brachiopods, which liad been tiie si;bject of special 
study by the Director, Dr. Charles D. Walcott. 

The extensive series of teeth of the elephant and mastodon, obtained by ]\Ir. 
W. H. Holmes at Afti)n, Ind. T., associated with prehistoric imi)lements, has i>r()ved 
of great interest, several species being represented. 

The accessions in l';ile()))()tany include a valuable collection of fossil plants, (■(nn- 
prising the type spccinu'iis described l)y Pn if. l']))enezer Ennnons in his American 
Geology, jiart 6, 1857; 100 specimens fnnn the auriferous gravels of California, cul- 
fected l)y Mr. C. D. Voy; 40 specimens from w hat may be the Upper Jurassic for- 
mation in the vicinity of the Cor win coal mine, near Cape Lisbourne, Alaska; about 
300 specimens from the Miocene Lake beds of the South Fork of John Day River, in 
Grant County, Oreg., transmitted ])y the Geological Survey; and about 100 speci- 
mens of Up2)er Carboniferous plants from the vicuiity of Plymptcm, Mo., described 
by Mr. David Whitt' in tlie Fossil Flora of the Coal Measures of Missouri, and pre- 
sented by Dr. John H. IJritts, of Plympton. 

Explorations. — Owing to the very limiti'd means available for field researches, the 
amount of work of this character carried on by assistants of the Museum has been 
relatively small, and most of the exjieditions made wen' only rendered possible 
through cooi)eration with other bureaus of the Government or through the gener- 
osity of individuals. The (iovernment explorations by wliicli the Museum is most 
benefited are those conducted by the Geological Survey, the Fish Commission, the

tut ion. OflicerH of the Army jLud Navy, with the exceptional oiiportnnities now 
afforded them, liave also been doing some excellent work for the Museum, especially 
in the Philippine Islands. In this connection mention should likewise be made of 
the important explorations which Dr. "W. L. Abbott, of Philadelphia, has been car- 
rying on for several years in the East Indies entirely at his own expense, the results 
being generously donated to this Institution. The latter comprise large collections 
in zoology and ethnology, whose value is enhanced by the fact of their coming from 
a region hitherto scari-ely represented in any museum in the world. The field work 
engaged in during the year by members of tlie Museum staff was as follows: 

j\Ir. W. H. Holmes, head curator of anthropology, visited Indian Territury and 
Missouri, in the former investigating an interesting dej)Osit (jf flint implements and 
Ijone utensils associated with the remains of extinct and recent mammals at Afton, 
and an ancient chert c^uarry on the Peoria Indian Reservation, and in the latter 
examining near Kimmswick an extensive deposit of fossil mammals in w liich human 
remains were said to occur, and an ancient village site containing stone imjilements 
and iwttery. The investigations begun by Dr. Walter Hough in Arizona, in June, 
1901, were continued through the summer, in conjunction with Mr. Peter G. Gates, of 
Pasadena, Cal., and chiefly at the expense of the latter. An archaeological section 
was made on a north and south line from Fort Apache to Moki, a distance of al)Out 
180 miles, and a large amount of material was obtained. Ethnographical work 
was also done among the Apache, Navajo, and Ilnpi Indians, and two new groups of 
ruins north ot Holbrook were mapped. 

Mr. W. H. Ashmead, who accompanied an expedition of the Enited States Fish 
Commission to the Hawaiian Islands in IMay, lUOl, for the purpose of making col- 
lections of insects and of studying the insect fauna of these new possessions, returned 
late in the summer with an important lot of material. Mr. B. S. Bowdish, formerly 
of the Enited States Army in Porto Pico, was employed for about seven months in 
])rocuring zoological specimens, chieflj- birds, in Porto Rico, in eastern Cuba, and on 
Mona Island. ■Mr. C. E. Pollard and Mr. William Palmer accompanied Di'. Edward 
Palmer, of the Department of Agriculture, in the spring of 1902 on an expedition to 
eastern Cu))a, wliere they obtaine<l an interesting collection of plants, birds, bats, 
insects, and marine invertebrates. 

The station of the Cabot Steam Whaling C'ompany, on the south coast of New- 
foundland, was visited during tlie sunnner of 1901 by Dr. Frederick W. True, who 
made a special study of the sulpluir-bottom whales, obtained many photographs, and 
arranged for the itreparation and shipment to Washington of the skeleton of a large 
whale. In a collecting trip to Colorado, Dr. IE G. Dyar, in company with ]Mr. 
A. N. Caudell, of the Department of Agriculture, secured some 10,000 specimens of 
Eepidoptera, and Mr. E. A. Schwarz made in Arizona, at his own expense, a very 
large collection of insects. Two months, during the si)ring of 1902, were spent in 
southern Ilhnois by Mr. Robert Ridgway, in the interest of the Division of Birds. 
Botanical explorations were carried on in Central America during the sunnner of 
1901 l)y ]Mr. J. N. Rose, assisted by Mr. Robert Hay, of Washington. 

Important collections were made by Mr. Charles Schuchert of Helderbergian 
fossils in New York and of Cretaceous fossils in New Jersey. Mr. F. AV. Crosby 
obtained for the Museum a remarkably flne series of i)ot holes from the basalt rocks 
near Snake River Falls, Idaho. 

Exchanges. — The use of its dui)licate specimens in effecting exchanges witii other 
scientiflc establishments and with individuals was recognized by the act founding 
the Institution as an important means of increasing the collections of the Smitlisonian 
Museum, and so it has proved to be during the more than fifty yeais that tlic prac- 
tice has been followed. The amount of material involved in each transaction ranges 
from one or a few specimens to collections of considerable size, wlnle the ecjuivalent

obtained generally consists of species or objects not previously represented. The 
duplicate specimens have therefore a high value as a purchasing medium, and have 
been, as a whole, the principal resource of the Museum for filling gaps in the collee 
tions, and for completing its series along many lines. Much valual)le material was 
secured through this means during the past year from both domestic and foreign 
sources, the institutions and individuals abroad entering into exchange relations 
having been as follows: 

Great Britain: The British Museum of Natural History at London, the Royal 
Botanic Gardens at Kew, Mr. E. Lovett, of Croydon; Prof. A. C. Haddon, of Cam-

The exhihU'um lidlh. — The crowded state of most of the exhibition halls has pre- 
vented extensive additions to the display collections except in a few directions. 
Much work was done, however, toward improving tlie condition and appearance of 
these collections by small additions, and by the substitution in many instances of 
better material and of a higher class of jjreparations. Considerable progress was also 
made toward completing the system of labeling. It had Iteen anticipated that pro- 
vision would have to be made dui'ing the year for housing the Museum exhibit at 
the Pan-American Exposition. A large part of the material was, however, sent to 
the South ('arolina Interstate and West Indian Exposition, l)ut before the close of 
the year the entire collection was back in Washington. The objects returned directly 
from P>uffalo have been mainly cared for by the transfer to storage of some of the 
less desirable preparations j)reviously displayed, and by utilizing, though only tem- 
porarily, a part of the lecture hall. 

In the Department of Anthropology several of the halls have Ihh'u lliomughly 
renovated, in some the collections have been reinstalled, and si>ace has been found 
for a few new ethnological groups. 

Among the additions in the Department of i'>iology were many finely mounted 
specimens of American manunals and birds, a part of the display at the Pan-Amer- 
ican Exposition, the fornu>r including a large specimen of Steller's sea-lion and a 
skeleton of the Kadiak hear. In the soutii-east Museum range, allotted to reptiles, 
batrachians, and lishes, some im])rovements have l)een made, several new cases being 
))rovided, many new preparations replacing older ones, and a number of large forms 
not previously represented being added. Among the latter were a cast of the King 
Cobra snake with accessories i'ei>resenting the edge of an Indian jungle, a very large 



rp:port of the secretary. 37 

Amazon River turtle, a Muta-niata turtle, a huye alligator snapper, the largest of tlie 
Nortli American water turtles, geveral boas, lizards, toads, and froLi;s. An exhibit of 
lizards will be arranged in i?ome of the wall cases. 

The 2)ermanent installation of insects in tiie hall recently assigned to this grou]i at 
the western end of the Smithsonian building has progressed to the extent of mount- 
ing about 2,700 specimens in 20 of the standard boxes occu])ying several ui)right 
cases. In the labeling of this series attention has especially been called to s])ecies of 
]>eculiar habits and to those of most interest to the i)nblic. 

To the display of vertebrate fossils have been added partial skeletons of the large 
Trlreratoj)s pror-iKK and of the carnivorous dinosaur, .l/^o,sa»rt(,s'. The installation of 
the Harris collection of invertebrate fossils, in a section of tlierail case of the gallery 
in the southeast court, has been jiractically completeil. This collection, received in 
1S98, is one of the finest yet made in the region it represents, being espc<'ially ri<-ii in 
crinoids, star-fishes, and trilobites, containing of the last group about 600 out of the 
750 S]ie(nes known fi-om the Cinciimati formation. 

The collections relating to physical and chemical geology have, in jiart, been 
thoroughly overhauled and rearranged, and about 100 photographs, maps, and other 
])ictures illustrative of these subjects have l)een placed on the adjoining walls. The 
building of galleries in the south-west range made it necessary to n-move for a time 
the collection of nnnei-als, which, at the close of the year, was being reinstalled after 
careful renovation. 

I'lililicdlioiis. — The publications issued during the year comjirised \olume 2;> of the 
Proceedings, and a number of j)apers belonging to volume 24, Part I of JJullctin No. 
50, Bulletin No. 51, two additional i)arts of Bulletin No. 39, and Ciicular No. 51, 
descriptive of the collections illustrating rock weathering and soil formation, rc^vntly 
])rei)ared for distribution to e(lucational estal^lishments. ^\'hil(■ the annual report 
for 1900 in complete form was not received from the (Government Printing Otlice 
until after the close of the fiscal year, a small edition of tlie several papers com])osing 
it was distributed as separates at an earlier date. 

Bulletin No. 50, entitled "The Birds of North and Middle America," by Mr. Rob- 
ert Ridgway, is intended to contain descriptions of all the species and subspecies of 
birds known to occui- on the North .American continent, and will consist of several 
parts or volumes. Part 1 treats of the Fringillid;e; jiart 2, covering the Tanagrid;e, 
Icteridje, C-o'rebidn-, and the ]Mniotiltid;e, is in pi-ess. Bulletin No. 51, compiled 
by Mr. R. I. (ieare, is a list of the imblications of the National Museum from 
1875 to 1900, including all papers printed in the Reports and Proceedings, and has an 
index by titles. The additions to Bulletin No. 39 are, a revist'd edition of Mr. (ier- 
ritt S. ]\Iiller's " Directions for collecting and preserving study specimens of small 
mannnals," with abstracts in (German, French, and Spanish, and "Directions for 
collectors of American Ijasketry," by Prof. O. T. ^lason. 

Librarij. — The additions to the lil)rary during the y(>ar numbered <)i:'> books, 13, (105 
pamphlets, and 5,885 parts of periodicals. 

Exposifion.'t. — At the Pan-American Exposition held in linffalo, N. Y., from May 1 
to November 1, 1901, the Museum, in conjunction with the jiareut institution and its 
other branches, made an extensive and exceedingly ci'editable display. The main 
features consisted of a large number of life-sized lay-figure groups illustratmg the 
-type tribes of American aborigines, of finely mounted specimens of many of the larger 
American mannnals, birds, reptiles, and fishes, and of the skeletons and restorations 
of several of the large fossil vertebrates of the western I'nited States. 

Upon the tdose of this exposition, in accordance w ith the directions of the. Presi- 
dent of the TTnited States, a carefully selected colleclion friMn the ahove exhibit wu'^ 
transferred to the South Cai'oliua Interstate and AN'est Imlian Mxpositiou, whicl; 
opened at Charleston on Decendx'i- 1, 1901, and contimied until May 31, 1902.

REPORT OF THE RURKAIT OF AMERK;AN ETHNOLOGY. 

Sir: I have tlie lionor to I'eport on the operations eondncted in tlie Bureau of 
American Ethnology during tlie fiscal year ending June oO, 1902, under authority of 
the act of Congress making provision "for continuing reseairhes relating to the 
American Indians under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution," approved 
March 4, 1901. The work was carried forward in accordance with the formal plan 
of operations submitted on May 20, 1901, and approved 1)y the Recretarv on Mav 
23, 1901. 

Field operations were conducted in Alaska, Ai'izona, Rritish Columbia, (California, 
Colorado, Chihuahua (Mexico), (ireenland, Indian Territory, Iowa, Maine, Missouri, 
New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Porto Rico, Texas, and Wyoming. The 
office work covered material gathered from most of the States and Territories, as well 
as from various other parts of the American hemisphere. 

ScoI'K OK 'i'UK WOKK. 

Tlie researches of the year were conducted in accordance with an ethnic system 
set foi-th in the earlier reports. This system may be defined as the Science of Eth- 
nology iu its modern aspects. Although based on investigations in all parts of the 
world duiing the past century, the s\'stem is essentially the i)rodu(tof the researches 
in American ethnology during the last two decades of the nineteenth century. Now 
that the system has assumed definite form, it affords a foundation not only for future 
researches, but for applying the principles of ethnology to practical questions. 
Accordingly the work of the year was gradually turneil toward lines bearing directly 
on questions of public interest. 

Among the lines of work in what may be called Applied Ethnology, to which spe. ial 
attention has been given during the year, two may be particularly mentioned: 

1. PJiy.vicnl rtlniologij. — On the institution of the Bureau in 1879 the Director found 
the science incomplete in that it <lealt largely with merely casual chara teri.stics of 
tribes and races, and neglected the essential characteristics expressed in the activities, 
or the doings, of peoples. So, special attention was given to the habitual doings of 
the several tribes studied, and at the Outset each was regarded as an activital type or 
genus; these were then ( ompared, and in the light of the coi^^parison the activities 
themselves were analyzed and afterward grouped systematically. It was in this v,ay 
that the science of demononi}-, with its subdivisions e-.ch relating to a group of 
activities, was developed. Now this great science, dealing as it does with the doings 
of tribes and races, each regarded as a typical gronj), is practi ally confined to the 
artificial or psyil;ic'il side of mankind; it l)arciy touches the; natui-ai or i)hysical 
attributes; yet it affords a bas's for classifying these attributes and measur!ng the 
infiuence of the prime force of demotic activity in shaping their development. In 
other words, the earlier ethnology dealt only with features and traits inherited from 
prehistoric ancestry; what may be called the New Ethnology deals with those traits 
and human powers by which mankind is d stinguished from all other organisms. 
The researches indicate that such traits and ])owers, such features and fa ulties, are 
connected with tlie normal dcveloi)meiit of triljcs and races, and arc, itKk'cd, the 
essential factors in the growth of nations. Accordingly it would seem that the time 

89 



40 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

is at hand for applying the principles of the New Ethnology to American aborigines 
as ethnic constituents of a growing citizensliip. The application requires a f-tati'stical 
study of physical characteristics, including viability, incUistrial aptitude, etc., of 
typical Indian tribes, together with a similar study of mixed bloods, or mestizos, 
both conducted with a view of comparison with Caucasian and other ethnic norms. 
The importance of this line of inciuiry is suggested by the fact that there are no 
physical statistics on record of any tribe of our passing race available for comparing 
stature, strength, endurance, viability, fecundity, and other jihysical attriVmtes, with 
those of Caucasians, either with the view of gratifying our instinctive desire for 
knowledge or with the object of deriving useful information from the experience of 
other peoples. The importance of inquiries concerning mestizos is sufficiently indi- 
cated by the history of a neighboring Rei^ublic, whose president is at once a product 
of the blended blood of the white and red races, and one of the foremost among the 
world's national leaders. Singularly, there are no trustworthy records of mestizos in 
this country, though their nmnber must reach some 30 to 60 per cent of that of the 
pure-blood Indian population. Nor is it to l;)e forgotten that many of the practical 
problems connected with immigration, Chinese exclusion, the occupation of Porto 
Rico, Hawaii, and the Philippines, and the education of the colored race can be 
finally solved only in the light of ethnologic principles, whether these be developed 
through slow experience or derived from scientific researches already advanced to 
the applicable stage. These and other weighty considerations have led to the 
inauguration of researches in physical ethnology. During the fiscal year a series of 
physical records made by Dr. Franz Boas among tlie Siouan Indians, with photo- 
graphs representing the physical types, was accepted for laublication. 

2. Aboriginal economics. — It is well known that aboriginal America gave the world 
corn, the potato, certain beans and squashes, tobacco, two varieties of cotton, and the 
domestic turkey; it is not so well known that the native tribes utilized various other 
natural resources which might well be introduced into the dietary and commerce of 
Caucasian peoples; and still less is it realized that various prepared foods in halytual 
use by the Amerinds are of unsurpassed excellence — for while succotash and hominy 
have come into general use, the far superior pinole, tamale, and pemmican are only 
locally used by whites and many other desirable dishes are entirely neglected. 
When the Bureau was instituted it was a common impression that the al)origines 
were mere huntsmen and fishermen, whose habits were in the highest degree vicious 
and improvident; but as the innnan activities were defined and the aboriginal indus- 
tries were ailo])ted it became more and more evident that many of the tribes were 
essentially agricultural, and that all subsisted in much larger degree than connnonly 
supposed on the produce of the soil. As researches progressed the importance of 
various aboriginal food sources neglected by the Anglo-Saxon became clear, and at 
the same time it became clear that our people might learn much from the red man con- 
cerning the simpler agricultural methods and the ways of bringing plants and animals 
under (-ultivation and domestication. The success of the native in utilizing natural 
resources is well illustrated in the arid region comprising that portion of the count ly still 
unsettled. The traveler o\er the principal railway from a few miles west of El I'aso to 
a few miles east of San Bernardino traverses a zone supi)orting a Caucasian jjopula- 
tion of some 20,000, with perhaps half as many Indians; the same zone alwunds in 
ruins of aboriginal dwellings, tem])les, ace(|uias, and res(>rvoirs, attesting a po])ula- 
tion fully ten times greater during tlie agricultural pciiod aiiti'datiiig llic Apache 
M'ars of the last eight or ten ceutuiics. It is highly significant that our li'ast- 
populated arid districts in the Southwest are those yielding most abundant evicU'Uces 
of numerous population during prehistoric times. A s])ecific exanqjle may be foimd 
in Arivaca Valley, Arizona, with a present inqmlation of less than 100; yet one of 
seven i)rehistori(r villages within Ihe valley ((^nprises ruins of more than 120 dwell- 
ings, with temple, corral, stadium, and pla/.as, evidently representing a population 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 41 

of fully (iOO for the village and 8,000 to 5,000 for the valley. Altliongh the depopula- 
tion began in the prehistoric'age^i^^througli wars still in progress at the time of discov- 
ery, the historic period has witnessed a part of the change; for it can nf)t be doultted 
that Cabeza de Vaca, Coronado, Alarcon, and their followers saw within th(^ zone 
between western Texas and eastern California a population twice or thrice the 
aggregate now subsisting within it, and this despite modern nmltijilication of indus- 
tries coimected with mining, grazing, and transportation. The success of the abo- 
riginal husbandman in this region was partly due to a system of irrigation so 
satisfactory that modern farmers often jjrotit by the ])rehistoric ditches; yet his chief 
advantagi'S grew out of a more economical adjustment between labor and produce, 
including crops now neglected. Among the neglected crop plants are various cacti 
(locally known as saguaro, pitahaya, nopal, saguesa, etc.), whose fruits sufficed to 
support the entire native population for some two months of each year, though they 
are never used by Anglo-Saxon settlers. These cacti are products of the desert ]>ar 
excellence, adjusted to their habitat during geologic ages. and. in some way not yet 
made out. deriving their vital energy chiefly from light: and they give promise that 
(unless exterminated by vandalism) they will some <lay yield to intelligent I'ultiva- 
tion and add an in\aluable resource to our arid districts. The researches concerning 
aboriginal food sources have l)een coupled with other studies in native economics, 
including those pertaining to textiles used fm- clothing, birch bark used for canoes 
and habitations, the making of baskets, etc. In most cases the immediate aim was 
to rcconl the primitive customs and crafts as a contribution to knowledge of a jiassing 
race, but the investigations have reached the stage of yielding useful le.'^sons to the 
superioi- lace. As announced in recent reports, productive studies of the beginning 
of agricultuie and zooculture have been conducted. During the past fiscal year a 
memoir on Wild Rice, by Dr. Jenks, has l)een {niblished, with a view of directing 
attention to a natural resource giving ]iromise of value to modern agriculture; Dr. 
Russell spent the greater part of the year in a critical study of a tyjncal tribe of the 
arid region (the Pima Indians), and has prepared a memoir on their indu.'^tries for 
early pul)lication; a systematic investigation of the birch-bark industries of the 
aborigines was taken up l)y Dr. Jenks; and Dr. Fewkes devoted a part of the year to 
a sjiecial study of the altoriginal economy of Porto Rico, with ])articular reference to 
the artifacts and customs still extant, ami giving promise of future value to that 
newly acquired territory. 

Except for the diversion of a portion of the energies of a few collaborators to the 
applications of ethnology, the work has lieen continued along former lines; and, as 
heretofore, most of the collaborators liave l)een emi^loyed ]iartly in the field and 
partly in the office. 

The organization of the work, which is slightly modified by the applications herein 
set forth, may 1)e defined as follows: (1) Physical characteristics (including the 
demograjihy of the native tribes), or somatology; (2) mental characteristics, or 
})sychology; ( r! ) arts (including games, sports, etc.), or esthetology; (4) industries 
(including economics), or technology; (5) laws, or sociology; (H) languages, or 
jihilology; and (7) myths (together with attendant ceremonies and other observ- 
ances), or sophiology. Customary attention has bi'en gi\en also to general and 
classific work, to the illustiation, editing, and publication of i'e])orts, to distribution 
of the published inatciial, and to the ancillary oHii'c work. 

Field Rese.vkcu and 1v\i'i,oi;.\ti()X. 

The Director spent over three months in Maine, engaged (so far as impaired healtli 
permitted) in researches among the northeastern Algonquian Indians and in revising 
his classificatory writings designeil for the guidance of operations in tiie l'>ureau. 
The linguistic and other material obtained from the Indians was utilized directly in 



42 REPOKT OF THE SECRETARY. 

the more general work, iiicUiding the linguistic (•la8sific'ation desc^ribeil in other 
paragraphs. 

Although occupied chiefly in adminstrative work, the Ethnologist in Charge made 
a reconnaisance in eastern-central Colorado early in the fiscal year, visiting certain 
archgeologic localities, notably in the vicinity of PueT^lo, Colo., and tracing the con- 
ditions affecting tribal movements during prehistoric times about the borderland 
between the peoples of the plains and those of the mountains and plateaus. 

On August 16, Dr. J. Walter Fewkes proceeded to southern Colorado and northern 
New Mexico for the purpose of extending archteologic explorations in districts hith- 
erto inade(iuately studied. His operations were extended southeastward through 
New Mexico into western Texas and northern Chihuahua (Mexico); in the latter 
State he made the most critical study thus far attempted of the extensive prehistoric 
ruins known as Las Casas Grandes. Throughout, he made extended notes on the 
surviving tribes, as well as on the various types of ruins and other relics, of which a 
carefully selected collection was l)rought in on his return to the office on November 20. 

On April 28 Dr. Fewkes sailed for Porto Rico, with the object of making such a 
reconnaissance of this and neighboring islands as might serve to throw light on those 
aboriginal industries still surviving and giving promise of utility, and at the same 
time form a basis for a more extended investigation during the current yeai-. 
Although scarcely extended beyond Porto Rico, his work was successful, yielding 
material for a special report. He returned to Washington and began the prepara- 
tion of this report just before the close of the fiscal year. 

Mr. James Mooney proceeded, on September 17, to the field in Oklahoma and 
Indian Territory, where he resumed a sjiecial investigation of the heraldic systems 
employed among the Kiowa, Kiowa-Apache, and Cheyenne tribes. His work con- 
tinued throughout the fiscal year, yielding the greater part of the material recpiired 
for an exhaustive monograph on one of the most interesting customs of the Ameri- 
can aborigines. In connection with the study of the devices, a considerable objec- 
tive collection was brought together for preservation in the National Museum. 

Throughout the entire fiscal year Dr. Frank Russell was in the field, chiefiy in 
Arizona, though his operations extended into New Mexico and Colorado, and about 
the close of the year into the Muskwaki habitat in Iowa. During the earlier 
months he made an extended archseologic reconnaissance of the upper Gila Valley, 
pushing his journey southward to the international boundary, westward to the 
area already covered by other collaborators, and northward to the border of the 
plateau country; thence the surveys were extended over the plateaus into Colorado 
and New INIexico for the purpose of comparing the lowland antiquities with those of 
the highlands. During winter and spring he located in the Pima country, near Saca- 
ton, and began a systematic study of the industrial and other customs of the Pima 
tribe. The work yielded material for a special report on the technology of the tribe 
and for a more general monograph on the historic and prehistoric inhabitants of the 
Gila Valley. 

On October 30 Dr. Albert S. Gatschet repaired to Indian Territory for the ])uriwse 
of completing his Peoria vocabulary and grammar, and making cognate researches 
among the few survivors of the Peoria tribe. Ho was al)le to perfect his records of 
the language of the tribe during the ensuin<i: nionfb and bring his work to a success- 
ful close about the middle of December. 

The beginning of the year found Dr. John ]\. Swanton engaged in researches 
concerning the language and social organization of the Ilaida Indians in British 
Columl)ia. This work continued until September, yielding voluminous material for 
publication in future reports. On September ."lO he returned to ^^'ashington and 
l)egan preparing the material for printing. 

Under the innnediate guidance of Dr. Franz Boas, philologist, Mr. H. H. St. Clair, 
2(1, spent the first three months of the year in linguistic researclics in Wvomiu": 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43 

and Oregon. In the ft)rnier State hi' made a full record of the local Sho^^honi dialect, 
and in the latter he made a 2)artjal collection of the lexic and granuuatic material of 
the Wasko and Pinte languages. Under similar guidance, ]Mr. William Jones made a 
critical study of the Muskwaki language in Iowa and Indian Territory; and Dr. 
Roland B. Dixon recorded the languages of the Maidu and other tribes of north- 
eastern California under the auspice^s of the American Museum of Natural History, 
but with an arrangement (noted elsewhere) b}- which the material is available in 
the Bureau work. 

On September 25 Prof. W. II. Holmes, of the National JNIuseum, and ^Ir. De Lancey 
Gill, of the Bureau, repaired, under the auspices of the Bureau, to northeastern 
Indian Territory for the purpose of examining a spring reported by a correspondent 
to contain abundant bone and flint implements associated with bones of both 
modern and extinct animals. They were successful in obtaining (1) the finest collec- 
tion of mammoth teeth thus far made in America; (2) one of the finest collections 
of mastodon teeth ever made, and (3) the most striking collection of chipped arrow 
points, lance hea<ls, and knives thus far made in a single locality in this country. 
They verified the reported association and were able to identify the spot as an 
aboriginal shrine to which the attention of the a1)origines was i)robably directed by 
the gigantic teeth and bones of extinct animals, and at which sacrifices were made 
through several generations. During the same trip they visited Kinunswick, Mo. , 
where also human relics are reported to occur in association with l)ones of extinct 
animals. Toward the close of the year Professor Holmes again visited this locality, 
and, with the assistance of Mr. Gerard Fowke, made a considerable colle(;tion for 
preservation in the Museum. 

In November Dr. Robert Stein returned from a two years' absence in Ellesmere- 
land and northern Greenland, where, inider facilities afforded by the Bureau, he 
obtained ethnologic data of interest relating to the northern Eskimo, or "Arctic 
Highlanders." Besides a small objective collection designed for preservation in the 
^Museum, he brought in the words and music of several songs which serve to estab- 
lish the existence of an archaic language among these people, and at the same time 
to demonstrate for the first time, and despite a prevailing opinion to the contrary, 
the existence of a fiducial cult among them. 

Under a special arrangement. Miss Alice C. Fletcher visited Oklahoma early in 
the fiscal year for the purpose of verifying and extending her records of certain 
Pawnee rituals designed for publication by the Bureau. Later she employed certain 
aged Pawnee Indians to recite the ancient rituals in such manner as to permit the 
making of phonographic and other records. Her efforts have resulted in unique 
contril)utions to knowledge of the esoteric customs connected with human sacrifice 
and other rites in pre-Columbian times and still surviving in emblematic form. A 
part of the material has been incorporated in a monograph on the Hako ritual, form- 
ing part of the Twenty-second Annual Report. Also under a special arrangement, 
Dr. Willis E. Everette sent in useful records concerning the Athapascan tribes of 
Alaska. 

During the earlier part of the year Mr. O. P. Phillips was employed temporarily 
in making motion pictures representing the industries, anmsements, and ceremonies 
of the Pueblo and other tribes in New Mexico and Arizona. The object of the work 
was to obtain absolutely trustworthy records of aboriginal activities for the use of 
future students as well as for the verification of current notes on fiducial dances and 
other ceremonies. Despite accidents to the apparatus, the work was fairly success- 
ful, yielding about a dozen kinetoscoi)e ribl)ons in addition to about a hundred 
excellent i^hotographs made by Mr. Phillips in connection with the motion pictures. 
The apparatus was kindly furnished in the interests of science by the Armat Moving 
Picture Company, of Washington.

WORK IN SOMATOLOGY. 

During the later iiiontlis of the year definite steps were talien toward systematic 
record and investigation of the j^hysical cfiaracteristics of the aborigines. A nucleus 
was already available in the form of an extended anthropometric record made by 
Dr. Franz Boas among the Siouan Indians several years ago and acquired by the 
Bureau in 1899; and it was decided to prepare the matter for early publication, partly 
as a record of the i)hysical characteristics of a typical group, i)artly as a model f(5r 
future work. In order to enhance the value of the publication it was arranged to 
have Pr. Boas prepare an introduction treating of somatology in general terms and 
to have Mr. De Lancey (iill, the illustrator of the Bureau, prei)are suitaljle illustrative 
material from the photographic negatives preserved in the ofiice. The memoir is 
well advanced, but was not cpiite completed at the close of the year. 

For some years past })hotography has been employed in the Bureau in such a 
manner as to yield useful anthropometric data. Thus, in dealing with the wilder 
tribes, who would resist ordinary physical measurements on fiducial or other grounds, 
the collaborators have made it a point to obtain group photographs with the figures 
so placed as to permit measurement of stature and other physical elements in terms 
of a known unit figure introduced for the purpose; and, similarly, visiting Indians 
phot()grai)lied in the liureau laboratory have usually been so placed with respect to 
backgrounds and other objects as to permit physical measurements of sufficient 
accuracy for practical i)urposes. During the past year special attention has been 
given to photograjjhing individuals in exact portrait, jirotile, and full face, with the 
view of permitting the extension of measurement to the facial angle, form of cranium, 
and other anthroi)ometric elements. This was done not only in the office, but to 
some extent in the field, especially by Dr. Frank Russell, who made a large number 
of i^rofile and full-face i)hotographs of Pima Indians. Although the system is not 
yet perfected, it gives })romise of excellent results as the reaseart-hes in somat<ilogy 
progress. 

Various collaborators of the Bureau have collected crania and other somatic 
material in connection with their field operations. For some years the material was 
preserved in the United States Army INIedical jNIuseum, but it has now been trans- 
ferred to the United .States National Museum, where the current collections of the 
collaborators are now regularly sent. In the absence of specialists in somatology 
in the Bureau, portions of the somatic material have been placed during the last year 
or two in the hands of experts not connected with either Bureau or Museum, foi- 
special investigation; and it is a pleasure to acknowledge the service rendered to the 
Bureau in this way by Dr. George A. Dorsey, of Field Cohunbian INIuseum, and 
Dr. Ales Hidlicka, of the American Museum of Natural History. A provisional 
arrangement has 1)een made for liaving such work done within the Bureau hereafter. 

WORK IN I'svcnoi.oov. 

For some years past tin- Director has given special attention to the mental charac- 
teristics of the aborigines; and during recent months he lias formulated a working 
system of psychology adapted to the needs of ethnologic students. In part, the 
results are embodieil in a series of synthetic outlines of ethnologic science designed 
for incorj)oration in successive rejjorts and printi'd in somewhat abbreviated j)n'lim- 
inary form in a leading journal (the American Anthropologist) for the i)urpose of 
eliciting suggestions from contemporary ethnologists in this and other countries. 
An abstract of the princii>les underlying this series, designed for incorporation in 
the present report, was printetl in December, 1901, under the title "Classification of 
the sciences." 

In addition to his <luli(>s as Kthnologist in Charge, 3Ir. W J McGee continued the

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45 

(if {)syi'}i<tl(),iiic iii((uiry haVe beey Huecessfully pvu^ued in tlie past. AVhile these are 
ill s(Hiie degree antithetic, they also measurably represent stages in the development 
of knowledge. The first method may be defined as that of introspection; the second 
as that of experiment. During the past decade the latter has attained great vogue, 
and departments of experimental psychology have been built up in several universi- 
ties and colleges. The two inethods, more especially the latter, afford a foundation 
fur a tliird method, wliicii is alone available for the study of large groups, such as 
races, nati( ms, ( ir entire peoples. It may be defined as the method of direct observation 
of normal interai-tions. In pursuing this method it is assumed, on the liasis of experi- 
mental psychology, that physical acts are correlated with mental actions — in other 
words, that human thought and human action are interdependent. The recognition 
of this simple jirincijile removes the need for a large jiart of the detail work involved 
in experimental psychology, for it permits the interpretation of mental characteristics 
of individuals and groups from their habitual or normal actions rather than from a 
repetition of special actions in a prearranged series. For this reason it has not hith- 
erto been deemed necessary to introduce psychometric work in connection with the 
ethnologic researches, the observations on Indian habits and artifacts seeming to afford 
a satisfactory index to and measure of the aboriginal mind. In its general aspect 
the principle may l)e said to have been established early in the history of the Bureau 
through ol)servations on activital coincidences, which have since been fornu;late<l 
in the comprehensive law of the Responsivity of JMind; so generalized, the prin- 
ciple may be regarded as the keynote of ethnic science, the Rosetta stone wherel)y 
the characters of all races may be interpreted. The recognition of the princi- 
ple serves also to explain and establish the se(iuenci' of stages in human develop- 
ment inferred from observations on many peojtles (i. e., from savagery, through 
barbarism and civilization, up to enlightenment), sint-e it shows that each transition 
was the product of cumulative experiences, long assimilated and api)lied through 
commonplace habits rather than through aljstract reflection — for in all the lower 
stages of human jirogress the mind borrows from the hand. Customarily the stages 
of culture are delined on the basis of social organization, but they may l)e defined 
nearly as conveniently in terms of psychic development. So defined, primordial 
savagery is not merely the stage in which the law rests on maternal kinship, but that 
of instinctive imitation, in which experience is jjerceptive rather than apperceptive, 
while knowledge increases through accident rather than design. Similarly, barba- 
rism is not only the stage of paternal kinship and jiatriarchy, but that of awakening 
apperception accompanied by distrust and dread of nature, in which knowledge is 
stimulated by notions of divination, with accompanying physical tests slowly assimi- 
lated in conscious experience. In like manner civilization is not simply the stage of 
law based on territorial right, but that of habitual discovery, in which new-found 
facts are consciously perceived and utilized. So, also, enlightenment means more 
than mere recognition of individual rights as the basis of law; for it is the stage of 
invention and of the union of individuals for conquest over nature through the exer- 
cise of definite prevision based on accumulated experience. Defined in a word, 
respectively, the four psycliic stages are those of (1) imitation, (2) divination, (?>) 
discovery, and (4) invention. Now, among the applications of the })rinciple of 
the interdependence of thought and action, none are more important than those 
pertaining to the develojimental stages; for the leading prol)lems of the world to-day 
are connected with the lifting of lower races and more iirimitive cultures to 
the planes of civilizaticm and enlightenment. The special applications are innu- 
merable, but they cluster about the general facts (1) that in primitive culture 
thought is engendered by action, (2) that in higher culture thought leads action 
and ('A) that hence tlie most effective ways of raising lower jjeoples are those 
of manual rather than mental training. All systematic observations indicati" that 



46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

in the earlier stages the mental clings to the manual so closely that the primitive 
artisan feels the implement as a part of himself and commonly believes that a part 
of his personality goes out into both tool and product; thus his craft is a constant 
stimulus to mental activity and j^repares him for further steps in the long way lead- 
ing from the plane of fettering instinct to that of free invention. When the sa^■age 
or barbarian is so far educated that his hand intuitively moves knife or saw or plane 
by pushing outward instead of pulling inward, his mind is in the third quarter of 
the normal course of development; but to this position he can be raised only by the 
oft-repeated example and simple precept of rational training applied to lower races. 
The researches along these lines are not complete; some of the results were incor- 
porated in a brief paper on "Primitive numbers," published in the Nineteenth 
Annual Report; and a preliminary account of certain results was issued during the 
year under the title " Germe d'une Industrie de la Pierre en Amerique." 

WORK IN ESTHETOLO(iY. 

Although Mr. Mooney remained in the field throughout the greater part of tlae 
year, his researches were such as to yield material for a irrespective report on Indian 
heraldry. His investigations during several years past have shown that various 
Indian tribes possess heraldic systems analogous in many ways to those of medi;eval 
Europe, and that such a system is especially developed in the Kiowa tribe; and his 
work during the year was carried forward in this and neighboring tribes. The ways 
in which the system is developed render the study extremely difficidt. The principal 
heraldic devices are closely akin to totems, and are of two types, one pertaining to 
tipis and the other to shields. The tipis, with their devices, belong to families or 
clans in which they are hereditary. The shields, with their emblematic (or armorial) 
bearings, belong to typical aboriginal groups or brotherhoods, which arise in con- 
nection with the bearings themselves. Usually the devices are "dreamed" liy a 
shaman (or, as he conceives it, revealed to him in a vision), the dream indicating 
also the number of shields that it is permissible to make with the particular bearing 
of the revelation. In due time the shields are made in accordance with the sha- 
man's dream, and these are adopted Ijy unattached warriors as special devices or 
crests until all are in use. Each shield usually bears two devices, one on an outer 
covering of skin placed over the shield proper, which may .be regarded as a 
symbol of the bearing within, and the other or real device on the face of the shield 
beneath the cover. Tlie latter is never revealed save in sacred ceremony and in 
battle, when it is displayed as a magical device for offense, as well as defense, against 
enemies. Each of the shields is eventually regarded by its bearer, or keeper, as the 
symbol of his special tutelary and a sort of receptacle for his personal spirit of 
warfare. It is prized and kept sacred during his lifetime (the purpose of the 
cover being to protect the sacred device from sacrilegious gaze), and, unless sacrificed 
in his declining days on the death of a kinsman, is buried \\ith his body — he enters 
on the dark under-world path of his faith with his head pillowed on the device 
which mysteriously carried him safely through many dangers in all the days of his 
life. By reason of the habitual sacrifice of shields and the decline of aboriginal cus- 
toms, few now remain, though fortunately many others are preserved in memory 
and tradition. Moreover, the devices can be ade(]uately studied only with the aid 
of their respective keepers and bearers who can lie induced to reveal the magic, or 
"medicine," of the devices, or — still better — to reconstruct them in such manner as 
to permit the investigator to trace the interrelated meanings of the various features 
as they are slowly wrought in ai-cordance with archaic ritual. The family tipis have 
also become rare, though nearly every family has surviving representatives ac(juainted 
with the family crests and with tiie ritualistic and other modes of constructing both 
tipis and heraldic devices. Mr. Mooney's method has been to employ survivors of 
both brotherhoods and families to reconstruct their shields and tipis, respectively,

with all the armorial l)earihgs oCthe olden time, the objects to ]>e preserved in the 
National Museum after the study is finished. Xaturall y the task has been a tedious 
one; yet the progress has been "satisfactory. The heraldic systems of the native 
tribes are of much interest in that they open the way to knowledge of various obscure 
customs of primitive peoples and also to vital stages in cultural progress. Thus, the 
devices represent a peculiar development of totemism; they are closely related with 
the calendric systems found among the tribes of the plains; and through these they 
arc akin to the glyphic systems employed in the aboriginal books and sculptures of 
]Mexic(^ and Central America. IMoreover, since they represent the transition from 
jirescrii)torial to seriptorial culture, they are found to throw much light on the gene- 
sis of those European systems of heraldry whose origin is lost in the darkness of the 
prehistoric. Finally, the heraldry of those tribes in which it is best developed forms 
a nucleus for the esthetic activities generally; in them artistic shapement and color- 
ing find their highest expression; in connection with them the powers of imagina- 
tion and the inspiration of fiducial symbolism attain their highest perfection, and 
through them ritual and faith and the intensely dramatic ceremonial warfare were 
crystallized and kept alive. To the lowly aborigines they were more than the text 
an<l pii'ture and drama of higher culture. The greater part of the material for a 
monograph on the subject was brought together during the year. 

Ethnologists have long realized that the widest gateway to aboriginal life is that 
afforded by games of chance; for primitive men, especially in that barbaric culture in 
which divination is the keynote of psychic character, are habitual gamesters, and not 
only devote much time to gaming, but play openly and with such infatuation as to afford 
constant opportunities to the student. The lowly games of the native Australians, 
New Zealanders, and Polynesians have received much attention; those of Korea, 
Japan, and China, in which the barbaric element of divination is supplemented by 
skill, have been described by eminent authors; the games of the American aborig- 
ines have been studied not only by collaborators of the Bureau, lint l)y other able 
ethnologists, notably Tylor; and the various studies afford a foundation for systematic 
research. The work was taken up incidentally Ijy the late Frank Hamilton Gush- 
ing, with the collaboration of Dr. Stewart Culin, of Philadelphia, author of notal)le 
treatises on Korean and other games. The joint study was incomplete at the tinie 
of INIr. Gushing' s death; subsequently it was carried forward independently by Dr. 
Cnlin. During the year an arrangement was effected with I)r. Gulin under which 
he has neai'ly completed a monograph on Amerind games for publication by the 
Bureau. In the prosecution of the work he has made several field trips, has exam- 
ined material in all the leading museums of the country, and has prepared numer- 
ous photographic and otlier illustrations. The results of the study are of much 
interest in that they illustrate a curious commingling of the fiducial and fortuitous in 
the notions of primitive gamesters. Actually the games are played as of chance 
rather than skill (though considerable skill is eventually developed); yet the play- 
ing is essentially devotional toward the mysterious potencies held to control the 
physical world and govern human affairs. Accordingly the games played for jias- 
time run curiously into the most sacred ceremonies, and the devices employed afford 
a fruitful revelation of primitive thought. By reason of the wealth of material, the 
monograph has become voluminous. It was not quite ready for delivery at the end 
of the year, but is promised for the lirst quarter of the current year. 

During the year Prof. W. H. Holmes, now of the United States National Museum, 
completed the monograph on aboriginal pottery of Eastern United States, of wliich 
he prepared the first draft while an officer of the Bureau. Although primarily tech- 
nologic, it forms an important addition to knowledge of aboriginal esthetics. As 
repeatedly noted in the ethnologic work, esthetic motives invariably arise in sym- 
bolism and develop through a conventionism shaped by ancillary or adventi- 
tious conditions, including texture of materials, character <»f tools, etc., as well as 



48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

growing conceptuality and power of imagination. Now, no line of esthetic develoj>- 
nient in more complete than that represented in the decoration of fictile ware, and 
jhe author of this monograph, combining as he does thorough technical knowledge of 
the potter's craft with high artistic skill and unique esthetic feeling, has been able to 
trace in masterly fashion and to illustrate effectively the growth of fictile decoration. 
As a faithful description of aboriginal pottery, the treatise will undoubtedly become 
a classic; yet it is no less noteworthy as the most comprehensive (;ontribution tbus 
far made to the history of one of the most important activities in those stages of 
culture in which the shapement and decoration of pottery have ranked high among 
the avocations of mankind. The monograph forms the body of tlie Twentieth 
Annual Report. 

During the year the series of graphic rei)resentations of personages in the Hopi 
pantheon collected l)y Dr. Fewkes, as mentioned in jjrevious reports, was sent to 
press as a part of the Twenty-first Annual, under the title "Ilopi Katcinas. " Dr. 
Fewkes also completed the illustrated memoir on his unique collections of pottery 
and other material from Arizona and New Mexico noted in the last report. It is 
in press under the title "Two summers' work in Pueblo ruins," as a part (if the 
Twenty-second Annual. 

WORK IN TECHNOLOGY. 

Primarily Professor Holmes's monograph on aboriginal pottery of P^astern United 
States is a description of the fictile ware classified by districts, so far as practicable 
by tril)es, and also by technologic types. The art of the potter is old, far older than 
written history, so that its beginnings can never be traced directly. The antique 
and prehistoric wares themselves yield a partial record of the development of the 
art, and the archjeologists of the Old World have been able to supplement and 
extend the written history of pottery making through study of such material, and 
their researches have lent interest to the ancient vessels and sherds with which the 
museums of the world are enriched. Yet the fictile ware of Egypt and Babylonia, 
Etruria and India, and other Old World provinces falls far short of telling the 
whole story of the art, since it fails to reveal the actual motives and sentiments of 
the early artisans — the relics are husks of the history of pottery making without the 
vital kernel. Accordingly the archa;ologic studies in America supplement the Euro- 
pean researches in a highly useful way. In the first place, the period of pottery 
making by the American aborigines was comparatively short, so that the prehistoric 
and the historic are closely related; and, in the second place, the several living tribes 
within reach of current observation represent various stages in the development of 
the art, so that opportunities exist in America for studying the motives and senti- 
ments of the artisans engaged in all of the earlier developmental stages of the art. 
In general, the craft of the potter may be said to arise in the social stage of savagery 
or the i)sychic; stage of imitation, with its tedious growth through accidental improve- 
ment; in general, too, tlic art may l)e said to expand and differentiate in the suc- 
ceeding barbaric stage with the attendant divinatory concepts as motives; and it is 
this stage, with its protean forms, textures, decorative devices, and modes of man- 
ufacture, which has been found peculiarly inscrutable by students of the products 
alone. Now, it is precisely this stage which is represented by most of the Aiueriran 
aboriginal ware, both prehistoric and historic, and by the surviving tribes. Accord- 
ingly Professor Holmes's description of the American ware, with his critical analysis 
of tyi)es and interpretation of motives, would seem to afford not merely a supple- 
ment to, ))ut a sound foundation for, the history of the potter's art. The mono- 
graph, which forms the l)ody of the Twentieth Ainuud IJcport, cndirnces faithful 
representations of some 250 typical specimens. 

Of the two special investigations concerning aboriginal iiidustiies undertaken during 
the year, that by Dr. Fewkes in Porto Rico would seem to be of the more general 
interest. While his trip to the Antilles was designed as a reconnoissauce of Porto 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49 

Rico, Haiti, and the i!^laii,(l.s iinmt'diately adjacent, he waw prevented, partly by the 
volcanic disturbances of early. May, from extending observations beyonfl the first- 
named island; yet this failure- of plfvo resulted beneficially rather than otherwise, 
since it enabled him to make -a more definite ethnologic and archpeologic survey of 
Porto Rico than was at first contemplated. Among the surviving types of aboriginal 
handicraft to which he gave special attention were those connected with habitations. 
In all jmrts of the American hemisphere the prevailing house type is in some measure 
a composite, or blend, of the indigenous and the imported; and while in most dis- 
tricts the imported motives are so far predominant that tiie indigenous elements are 
hardly traceal)le, there are other districts, especially in tropical, subtropical, and arid 
regions, in which the aboriginal types are of such excellence that many elements 
have l)een retained with advantage by Caucasian settlers. This is especially true in 
the Antilles, where natural conditions of climate, water, and available material have 
led to light and inexpensive types of construction by which European settlers have 
been glad to profit. The types are somewhat analogous to those which have been 
better developed in the Orient, especially in Japan, and which are frequently com- 
mended to the attention of occidental builders and liouseholders. When it is remem- 
bered that the prevailing Anglo-Saxon types are at once adapted to the rigorous 
climate of northwestern Europe and adaptations of materials developed in the north- 
ern temperate zone, it l^ecomes evident that tiiey are not well suited to our southern 
temperate zone, and especially to our tropical and su])tropical possessions. Then, 
when it is remembered that the indigenous types, e. g., of Porto Rico, are specifically 
adapted to the local climate and adaptations of local materials, it would seem clear that 
architectural motives derived from them ought to be even more useful than any bor- 
rowed from Jajjan. These considerations have influenced the researches in Porto 
Rico, and they are in j)art the motive of the special report on Porto Rico prepared by 
Dr. Fewkes. Other motives have grown out of the native food sources which have 
been found useful by generations of European settlers, and out of those aboriginal 
modes of food preparation which are of such excellence as still to survive. It would 
appear from the observations that several native foods are worth j^ of attention and 
cultivation by settlers from the United States, and that some of the indigenous modes 
of preparing food might well receive careful study with a view to maintaining the 
excellence of the preparations when more advanced modes of handling, milling, pre- 
serving, and transporting are introduced. The details of Dr. Fewkes's investigations 
are incorporated in a memoir designated for early publication in the form of a I)ul- 
letiu. The industrial data are supplemented by bil)liographic and other material, 
which will render the report a manual of Porto Rican ethnology and archfeology. 

The special investigation undertaken by Dr. Russell among the Pima Indians 
covered aboriginal industries developed in and adapted to the arid region. Here, 
as in Porto Rico, local types of habitation have resulted from the climatic and other 
local conditions. The primal house type is a small circular structure of canes or 
reeds, roofed with earth, the whole supported by an inner framework of poles. This 
type is differentiated according to available materials, the grass house and the house 
of cactus (okatilla stems or saguaro ribs) being closely related derivative forms. It is 
differentiated also by arrangement of material, as when the canes or cactus staves 
are wattled with reeds or withes, and the house tends to become square in plan with 
vertical walls eventually beplastered by the washing of mud from the roof and by 
the throwing up of embankments as wind-breaks below. Under the imitative 
instinct of savagery the wattled walls are coated with a mortar of mud, which is 
magically "hardened" by the embedment of pebbles and larger stones; and this 
may be deemed the secondary type of aboriginal architecture in southwestern United 
States and northern Mexico. From it develops under favorable conditions a third 
type — i. e., that of rul)ble masonry set in mortar of mud (n* even laid dry; but where 
building stone is lacking, the pebble-set wattle structure grows into a distinctive 

SM 1902 4 



50 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

architecture of which the l)asis is the puddled wall, or jiise, called by Spanish settlers 
"cajon," the fourth house type of the arid region. Aboriginally, the earth used in 
the structure W'as doubtless tamped between wattled walls, at first permanent and 
afterwards temporary; certainly during later times the earth was built up in succes- 
sive ledges between niovable screens of wattling so placed and braced as to form a 
temporary trough for each ledge. The cajon structure was durable, and was suscep- 
tible of development into communal houses of many rooms and several stories. As 
in the primal type, the roof remained of earth laid on shrubbery supported by a 
sheathing of canes or cactus staves and rafters of cedar poles; on one-story houses it 
was a i>lace of temporary resort for the occupants, and with the gradual evolution of 
parapets and the growth of these into higher stories the roofs became u])per floors. 
Subsequently (probably after the Caucasian invasion) earthen bricks laid in mud 
mortar w'ere sul)stituted, and this type of construction, known as adobe, w'as generally 
adopted; and in the better buildings, both of cajon and adobe, the walls were coated 
with a thin plaster or slip fixed by some form of soda or other earthy salt. Now, the 
aboriginal cajon house type is admirably adapted to the present needs of the arid 
region and is well worthy of consideration by Caucasian settlers. Properly con- 
structed, cajon walls are much superior to adobe in homogeneitj' and strength, though 
somewhat more expensive in labor. Their durability is sufficiently attested l)y Casa 
Grande in the Gila Valley, which was a ruin of immemorial antiquity when discov- 
ered by Padre Kino in 1694, and which is still standing despite vandalism as well as 
natural weathering. Moreover, the cajon is readily susceptible of improvement by 
the addition of lime or cement to the material in any desired quantity and by substi- 
tuting a plaster of lime or cement for the simple slip. So improved, the native con- 
struction would seem better adapted to the conditions and requirements of hal)ita- 
tions in tho arid region than any imported models. The cost would be only that of 
the lime and the handling of materials, while wood, burned brick, and even stone 
are highly expensive. The thick walls would effectively equalize interior tenii)er- 
atures despite the enormous diurnal range, which is the most serious obstacle to 
residence in arid districts; and the general massiveness would lend itself to distinc- 
tive and desirable architectural effects. Dr. Russell's researches extended also to the 
lighter and more composite types of construction surviving among the Pima and 
neighboring Indians, as well as to the attendant industries and food sources. Among 
the latter the fruit of the cactus figures prominently, not only m modern customs 
but in tradition and ceremonies, attesting the still more important place which the 
fruit and its products occupied in the lives of past generations. Dr. Russell's mate- 
rial has been so divided as to yield a special memoir on technology, designed for 
early i^ublication in bulletin form, and a general monograph on the social organiza- 
tion, mythology, and esthetology of the Pima tril)e and on the antiquities of their 
habitat. 

During the year Dr. Albert E. Jenks revised the proofs of his memoir on "Wild 
rice gatherers of the upper lakes," forming part of the Nineteenth Annual Report. 
This treatise is deemed especially valuable in that it calls attention to a widespread 
food source largely used by the aborigines and giving promise of great utility to our 
citizens whenever the requisite attention is given to cultivation, milling, and prepa- 
ration. In food value the wild rice ranks high among cereals, and its natural 
haV)itat is such that by its means otherwise useless swamp lands may be utilized and 
reclaimed, while it can not be doubted that with judicious cultivation it might be 
adapted to an ever-widening range of soil conditions. liater in the year Dr. Jenks 
resumed his researches concerning the birch-bark industries of our northern 
aborigines. As noted in the last report, one aspect of the industries clustering about 
the birch tree is of prime significance to ethnologists in that the birch-bark canoe 
was the most effective agency of distribution of tribes and culture during early times; 
yet it is well worth noting that the interest is a living one, since the bark canoe 
remains a most effective device for transportation among white men as well as red. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 51 

Indeed, its use by white,, toixristw, fislienuen, liuntens, etc., i.s ai)parently iucreaHiiij^ in 
northern United States and .C'anada. Various other birch-liark artifacts are in use 
among whites as well as natives. ,Tlie half conventif)nal, half syniboli(r juakok, or 
maple-sugar box, proves to form a convenient household utensil; birch-bark l)askets 
of different forms are found useful as well as artistic; and on the whole it would 
appear that the birch-bark industry is not only increasing in conseciuence of <lemands 
by whites, but that it serves as a helpful stepping-stone from the jirimitive customs 
of the Indian toward the free and self-supporting citizenship which is the Indian's 
ultimate goal. Exigencies connected with the editorial wurk of the oliice compelled 
Dr. Jenks to divert a part of liis time from the research. At'cordingly, the work was 
not quite completed at the end of the liscal >ear, when Dr. Jenks was, at the request 
of the Director of the Philippine Bureau of Nonchristian Tribes, furloughed for a 
year, with a view to the more effective introduction of the methods (^f the Bureau of 
American Ethnology in the Philippine researches. 

For several years Mr. J. D. McGuire has been engaged in investigating certain 
lines of aboriginal technology, and certain of his results have been pu))lislied in the 
reports of the United States National INIuseum. During the last fiscal year he began, 
at the instance of the Director, a critical stud}' of the earliest records of aboriginal 
technology made by the (^oncjuistadores, missionaries, and other pioneers. During 
the year just closed he continued the work and has made a series of extracts from 
the records which have proved of great use to the Director and the collaboratora 
engaged in field researches. The extracts are arranged on cards, and certain install- 
ments of these have been acquired for the use of the Bureau. 

WORK IN SOCIOLOGY. 

Throughout most of the year the time of the Ethnologist in Charge has been so 
fully occupied with administrative work, largely relating to publication of the reports, 
as to somewhat delay his sociologic inquiries; yet fair progress has been made. ( )ne of 
the S2)ecial incpairies of the year relates t(j what may be calleil, by extension of common 
terms, aboriginal land tenure, this investigation being rendered timely l)y current 
progress in the allotment of lands in severalty to former tribesmen, as well as l)y recent 
occupancy of territory formerly inhabited by native tribes in Alaska, Hawaii, and the 
Philippines. The researches indicate that primitive peoples have no conception of 
land tenure in the sense in which the terms are employed by civilized and enlightened 
peoples. In the first place, there is no recognition of individual title to lands or 
other natural values, for any such values are regarded as pertaining to the clan, the 
gens, or the tribe, i. e., i)ossession is communal rather tlian individual. In the second 
place, the property sense is especially inchoate as a[)plied to lands, which are viewed 
as natural ranges for men and animals, i. c, for local tribes and local fauna; and 
there is no recognition of ownership or title inimical to the natural and coordinate 
rights of other men and beasts. True, tliere is among most tribes a vague sense of 
prescriptive right to long occupied territory, i. e., to tlie liome of the ancients who 
play so prominent a role in primitive philosophy, so that commonly a tribe feels it a 
right and a filial duty to protect the home range against permanent invasion by aliens; 
yet the vague riglit so recognized scarcely applies to the land per se, but only to the 
rights of the chase, fisiieries, fruits, and any cultivated products, personal hal)ita- 
tions, quarries or clay pits, etc., i. e., to what may be called the usufruct of the soil. 
In other words, the attitude of the savage or barbarian toward property in land is 
much like that of American citizens during the last century toward property in water, 
i. e., in the rains, rivers, lakes, seas, artesian water, ordinary ground water, etal., 
during recent decades the idea of projierty in water has grown up in tlu; less humid 
districts and is rapidly extending, yet the development of the concept is slow, even 
in the minds of the most intelligent people. Perhaps a closer parallel may be found 



52 REPOKT OF THE SECRETARY. 

in air as viewed l>y enligiitened peoples, for the air is regarded as essentially com- 
mon to all living and breathing things, and its use as an inherent right far tran- 
scending conventional titles to personal or communal jiroperty. There are, indeed, 
certain germs of comnmnal property right in air, manifested in the occasional actions 
of neighborhoods looking to the al )atement of certain nuisances, yet the claims put forth 
in sucli actions relate rather to the free and common use — or to usufruct — of the air 
than to its possession as property, so that our attitude toward air is closely analogous 
to that of jirimitive folk toward land. The results of the inquiries find ready appli- 
cation in connection with various public questions. One of the conclusions is that 
primitive folk can not l)e at once transferred from the plane of collective interest in 
the usufruct of the soil to that of individual land tenure, any more than the farmer 
of the Atlantic seaboard i-ould be brought in a day to full understanding of irrigation 
water rights, witli all the complications of dams, sluices, main ditches, gates, etc. — 
indeed, the education of the citizen farmers who have gone West and grown up with 
irrigation was much more rapid than could be expected of the slower-minded tribes- 
men. Accordingly, it would clearly be a mistake to transfer tril)esmen directly from 
the range to the severalty holding; there should be (as indeed experience has 
shown in dealing with the Indians) an intermediate period of proprietary training 
on collective reservations. The researches indicate that this i)eriod should cover at 
least a generation ; in most cases two generations Avould ])e required for the devel- 
oimientof that sentiment of thrift and feeling of independence required for success- 
ful citizenshij). 8ome of the results of the year's work have been made jmblic in 
scientific papers and addresses, and j)rogress has lieen made in arranging the material 
for formal issue in reports. 

In connection with his linguistic researches in British Columl)ia, Dr. John R. 
Swanton collected definite information concerning the kinship terms and other fac- 
tors in the social organization of the Haida Indians, and toward the close of the year 
he made progress in arranging the data for publication. 

WOKK IN l'lIIl,OLOGY. 

During the earlier part of the fist-al year the Director continued the arrangement 
of Mexican and ('entral American linguistic material witli a view to the classification 
of the ahorigines of the southern portion of North America on a linguistic basis. As 
during the preceding year, Dr. Cyrus Thomas collaborated in the work. The com- 
I)letion of the task was delayed by the illness of the Director during the later 
months of the year. 

At the o]>ening of the year Prof. Franz Boas, of Columbia University, was given 
an honorary appointment as philologist, and was intrusted with the supervision of 
a considerable part of the linguistic researches in A\hich the Bureau is engaged. 
One of the objects of the appointment was that of o))taining a uniform series 
of outlines of Indian languages to ))e pubhshed in synoptic form for use in 
comparative studies by the philologists of Ihe world. The work requires exten- 
sive preparation because of the wide range and considerable volume of the mate- 
rial both in hand and required. At the time of discovery there were in North 
America somewhere between one and two thousand triljal dialects or languages 
belonging to about a hundred linguistic stocks or families, so that the scope 
of the work is so broad that it may not be acconiplislied except by the cooper- 
ation of many specialists devoted to parti(;ular groups of languages. Under exist- 
ing conditions it seems inexpedient to attempt covering the ground through the 
Bureau alone; an<l the plan of tlie work intrusted to Dr. Boas is to enlist the 
cooperation of other institutions and other linguistic specialists. During the past 
year the work was organized in cooperati(jn with the American Museum of Natural 
History, Columbia University, Harvard University, and the University of California. 
The collaborators included Dr. John R. Swanton, of the Bureau; Mr. H. H. St. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 53 

Clair, 2d, of the American ^luseuni; ]Mr. William Jones, on behalf of Columbia 
Univert-ity; Dr. Roland B. Dison, of Harvard, and Dr. A. L. Kroeber, under the 
auspices of the University "of .California. Dr. Swanton's work comprised the tran- 
scription of a voluminous series of Haida texts; he also completed a synopsis of 
the Haida language for incorporation in the general series. Mr. St. Clair devoted a 
part of the year to work on a dictionary and grammar of the Chinook language, 
and in addition made a critical study of Shoshone linguistic material in the archives 
of the Bureau and of the American IVIuseum. Mr. Jones made good progress in 
analyzing the grammar of the Sauk and ]\Iuskwaki dialects, nearly completing a list 
of suffixes and prelixes; ho also made good progress in arranging for publication a 
series of ]\Iuskwaki texts collected during the preceding f].scal year. Dr. Dixon 
prepared a grammar and vocabulary of the Maidu language, while Dr. Kroeber 
collected and arranged both lexic and graminatic material representing several 
other California tribes. Partly through the inspiration of hearty approval from 
scientists and scholars both at home and abroad, Dr. Boas and his collaborators 
have taken up the work with zeal and enthusiasm. Dr. Boas observes: "Linguistic 
work in many parts of North America is exceedingly urgent on account of the 
rapid disappearance of the native languages, and the means at our dispo.sal for this 
work are insufficient;" yet it is a gratification to report that the interest of the 
collaborators who have worked gratuitously or for only nominal compensation has 
resulted in a large volume of invaluable material at trifling cost to the Bureau. It 
is a i>leasure to acknowledge the generous contributions of Dr. Boas and the other 
collaborators named. 

During the year Dr. Boas completed the proof revision of his memoir entitled 
" Kathlamet Texts," and it has been published as a bulletin. He also completed 
tlie iiianuscript for a similar memoir entitled "Tsimshian Text," and it was trans- 
mitted for i)ublication on January 29, 1902. 

Dr. Albert S. Gatschet carried forward t(3 sul)stantial completion his vocabulary 
and grammar of the Peoria language, and also continutd the arrangement of material 
for the comparative Algonqiiian vocabulary. In addition he devoted some time to 
special researches required for answering some of the numerous requests for informa- 
tion concerning Indian terms and phrases constantly received from correspondents. 

Mr. J. X. B. Hewitt devoted the greater part of the year to his monograph on 
Iroquois Creation Myths, mentioned in previous reports; three of the live sections 
were sent to press during the year as a part of the Twenty-first Annual Report. 
Toward the close of the year he took up the general discussion of princijiles noted 
in another paragraph; and as a part of the current work, lie continued the extrac- 
tion and arrangement of Iroquoian linguistic material in a form suitable for refer- 
ence and eventually for pu1)lication. ThiMughout the year a consideralile part of 
Mr. Hewitt's time was occupied in the researches require<l for aiiswi'ring technical 
inquiries from correspondents — a duty which seems unavoidable, although its per- 
formance retards progress in systematic researches. 

]\Iiss Jessie E. Thomas continued the transcription of the manuscript Diccionario 
de Motul, while Sefior Andomaro Molina, of Merida, Yucatan, made good progress 
in the translation of the Maya and Spanish terms into I'.nglisli, with a view to the 
issue of this extensive vocaliulary in a form appropriate to the publications of the 
Bureau. In view of tlie prospective value of this work to future students, it would 
seem important that the llnal translation should be based on tliorough and critical 
knowledge of the Maya, Spanisli, and English languages; and in view of this desira- 
bility, in connection with tlie fact that Sefior INIolina is a volunteer collaborator resi- 
dent in another country, it is deemed proper to insert the following- voluntary 
expression from the United States consul at Progreso, Yucatan, Hon. Edward H. 
Thompson, himself a critical student of the antiquities, history, and languages 
of Yucatan: "To my mind, in the work of Lie. Andomaro Alolina, the Bureau 



54 REPOET OF THE SECKETABY. 

has done the best work of the year and has done it in the best possible way. It 
has arranged to give to light and study a much-needed work, and it has put it in 
the very hands best fitted to do it. I am, perhaps, eomjietent tf) speak upon this 
subject, and I am willing to place on record my belief that no living man can do this 
work intrusted to him so Avell as Mr. Molina. The work that he is doing can not 
be done by a foreigner. I am, perhaps, as well Informed upon the native Maya, 
their habits, customs, etc., as any living foreigner, and, it may be, better than any 
other. I know enough to know that I could not do the work as it should be done. 
This task should only be undertaken by one who has been brought up on milk from 
a native breast, whose first words were in Maya, and whose thoughts come easier to 
him when clothed in the Maya form than when in classic Castillian or downright 
Anglo-Saxon. Such a man is Molina. To the instincts and the education of a 
i-cholar he adds the subtile understanding of the native and as jjerfect command of 
the ancient language, the Maya, as any man can have at this day." 

The final proofs of the Natick Dictionary, compiled by the late James Hammond 
Trumbull, were revised during the year, and the greater part of the sheets have 
been printed. 

In addition to his work on the Mexican and Central American linguistic records, 
in innnediate collaboration with the Director, Dr. Cyrus Thonias coutimied his inves- 
tigation of aboriginal records in the form of codices, scul2)tures, etc. His work was 
productive, yielding among other results a memoir entitled Quirigua Calendar Sys- 
tems, which was sent to press as a part of the Twenty-second Annual Report. 

Progress was made also in preparing for the press the translations made l)y Mr. 
Charles P. Bowditch of certain scattered yet noteworthy contributions to knowledge 
concerning the calendric and other records of Mexico and Central America, and it is 
a pleasure to acknowledge the generositj' of the translator in contributing the mate- 
rial and furthering the work of its i^reparation in every practicable way. Toward 
tlie end of the fiscal year Mr. Elbert J. Benton was temporarily employed to edit the 
material and arrange the illustrations for publication in the Twenty-fourth Annual 
Report; this work was well advanced at the close of the year. 

WORK IN SOPHIOLOGY. 

About the end of May Miss Alice C. Fletcher completed her monograph on the 
Pawnee Indians under the title " Hako; A Pawnee Ceremony." In many respects a 
typical tribe of the plains, the Pawnee Indians were in some points the most remark- 
ably developed of the prairie tribes. Like other vigorous aboriginal grou])S, they 
were composite; an important constituent (later known as the Skidi band) was from 
the wooded hills and broad bottom lands of the Arkansas country, where they or 
their ancestrv developed a woodland culture, and doubtless performed a sliare in the 
erection of the imjwsing mounds of the Lower Mississippi region; other tril)al con- 
stituents represented prairie provinces; and there are strong suggestions in the 
rich tribal mythology that at least a cultural constituent was absorbed from the 
highly religious sedentaiy peoples of the Southwestern pueblos. Then the com- 
I)osite tribe lived long (as attested by their traditions as well as their customs) in the 
prairie region, which they shared with the buffalo; and, in even greater degree than 
the Siouan tribes farther northward, they adjusted themselves to tliis natural 
si)oil — so that the buffalo became the furnisher of their food, the source of their 
raiment, the giver of material for tlunr habitations, the guide of tlieir migra- 
tions, the goal of their liandicraft and hunting tactics, and, finally, one of llie fore- 
most among their deified tutelaries. Accordingly the fiducial ceremonies of tlie 
tribe combine the intensity of local veneration for a few leading tutelaries with a 
wealth of imagery and ritual derived from other districts and peoples, and all 
vivified by the common union and intei'action. During earlier days the rituals were 
so far esoteric as generally to escape the notice of I'thnologists as well as casual visit- 
ors; but during i-ec;ent years a few students, notably Miss Fletcher, have been per- 



REPORT OV THE SECRETARY. 55 

mitted to enter the arcana, and witness the sacred ceremonies, and even to examine 
and obtain interpretations of the- magic "bundles" which serve as the tangible basis 
of the rituals. All of these rituals, are impressive; some, like the Hako, are of 
remarkable richness, not onlyin gesture ajid measured movement, but in the poetic 
imagery ex2)ressed in word and music and pantomime. Miss Fletcher's record 
appears to be perfect, and she has analyzed with acumen the rhythm and melody 
(jf the chants, the symbolic harmony of the accomjianying pantomime, and the 
meaning expressed in the intricate figures of the dance and movements of the march 
forming essential features of the ceremony. From Miss Fletcher's rendition and 
interpretations it would seem that these elaborate rituals open a vista looking directly 
on the beginnings of song, dance, drama, poesy — certainly they are a revelation to 
students of the highest phases of human cultui-e as well as to the investigator of 
primitive customs. The memoir is in i)ress as a part of tlie Twenty-second Annual 
Report. 

In connection with his comi)arative study of Indian creation mytlis, Mr. Hewitt 
has been led to analyze certain fundamental features of i^rimitive philosophy, esjie- 
cially tliose forming tlie basis of totemism, shamanism, etc. It is well known that in 
the different Indian languages there are terms difRcailt of translation into modern 
tongues which are of deep meaning to their users, e. g., manido, or nianilou, among 
the Algonquiau tril)es, iralnu^ or inikmida, among the Siouan tribes — terms covering 
a larger proportion and wider variety of the thought of primitive men than any 
single term covers iu higher culture. Among the Iroquoian Indians the correspond- 
ing term is orenda, which may be translated "mysterious power for good and evil," 
"powers of magic," or, more briefly, "magic potency." Mr. Hewitt's analysis was 
announced in a preliminary paper, and has already proved serviceable to ethnologi.>-ts 
in this and other countries; and it seems probable that the Iroquois term will come 
into general use in the English language for purposes of sophiologic discussion. The 
complete study is designed for publication in the second part of "Iroquois Creation 
Myths," which was nearly ready for the press at the end of the year. 

For a number of years Mrs. Matilda Coxe Stevenson has been investigating the 
myths and ceremonies of the Zuiii Indians, the progress of the work being retarded 
by her ill health, as noted in previous reports. During the earlier months of the 
fiscal year Mrs. Stevenson was on temporary furlough, and the state of her health so 
improved as to permit her to take up the work again. Accordingly she was able t<j 
finish the revision of several incomplete chapters and t(j arrange the material for the 
entire monograph in form for publication. The nature and extent of the work ha\e 
been reported repeatedly; it may be noted merely that IVlrs. Stevenson's ambition 
has been to make a model record of the elaborate ceremonies of one of the most 
interesting of the Pueblo tribes, and that it is a source of much gratitication to 
announce the satisfactory completion of the work. 

Although their researches were devoted primarily to other Indian activities, .sev- 
eral of the collaborators have made noteworthy collections of sociologic material 
during the year, the work of Dr. Fewkes on Porto Rican zemis and zemeism, that of 
Mr. Mooney on the fiducial factors in Kiowa heraldy, that of Dr. Russell on the calen- 
dric systems and accompanying beliefs of the Pima Indians, that of Dr. Jenks on the 
mythology of l)irch bark, and that of Dr. Swanton on the mythologic features of 
social organization among the Haidu Indians l)eing esjiecially worthy of mention. 

DESCKIl'TIVK KTJINOI.O(;Y. 

In connection with his field work, Mr. Mooney was able to make some progress in 
the preparation of the Cyclopedia of Native Tribes; and when other duties per- 
mitted. Dr. Thomas contiimed the collection of material for this work, both from 
current pul)lications and from the lari' books constantly being added to thc^ library. 

About the middle ok" the year I lie liiider translation of tiie manuscript history of 



56 REPOBT OF THE SECRETARY. 

Texas by Padre Morfi was taken up for annotation with a view to pul^lieation. The 
historical annotation was kindly undertaken by Dr. George P. Garrison, of the Uni- 
versity of Texas, and the manuscript was in his hands at the close of the year. 

COLLECTIONS. 

All of the collaborators engaged in field operations made more or less extensive 
collections for study and for ultimate transfer to the United States National Museum. 
By far the most extensive of these collections was that made by Mr. Mooney as a 
means for the research in heraldry. This collection still remains in the field. Dr. 
Russell collected a full series of objects representing the arts and industries of the 
Pima Indians, including a series of baskets representing the more archaic as well as 
the modern forms; among the unique objects comprised in the collection are two 
calendric^ records intermediate in character between the winter counts of the North 
and the maguey-book records of the South. Dr. Fewkes made considerable collec- 
tions in New Mexico and Chihauhua early in the year, and subsequently obtained 
an interesting series of aboriginal ol)jects in Porto Rico. As usual, various collec- 
tions were obtained also by purchase under the more immediate direction of the 
Secretary. 

PROl'ERTY. 

The property of the Bureau comprises (1) othce furniture and apparatus, (2) 
ethnologic manuscripts and other original records, (3) photographs and drawings 
of Indian subjects, (4) collections held temporarily by collaborators for use in 
research, (5) a working library, and (6) undistributed residues of the editions of 
the Bureau publications. There was little change in the amount or value of office 
jiroperty during the year. Purchases of office furniture were inconsiderable; several 
manuscripts were accpiired by purchase, mostly for inunediate publication, as noted 
in jirevious paragraphs, while the records of original work ])rogressed steadily; about 
855 negatives (glass and film), 2,050 prints, and a numl)er of drawings were added to 
the collection of illustrative material, and an approximately proportionate (juantity 
of illustrative material was used in the reports. Most of the collections of the year 
have gone directly to the United States National Museum; some, like those of Mr. 
Mooney, are still in use. The library has maintained a steady growth, chiefly 
through exchanges, j^artly by the purcliase of current ethnologic books and early 
records ]iertaining to the aborigines. The additions of the year comprise about 895 
books and 150 pamphlets, raising the contents of the library to 11,339 books and 
2,500 pamphlets. The number of back reports was reduced through the constantly 
increasing pul)lic demands for ethnologic literature; nearly all of these documents 
are now out of print. During the first lialf of the fiscal year Mr. J. Julius Lund con- 
tinued in charge of the property as custodian; after Mr. Lund's resignation Mr. 
Frank M. Barnett was appointed to this position. Miss Jessie V,. Thomas remains 
in immediate charge of the library and Miss Ella Leary of the distribution of 
documents. 

PUBLICATIONS. 

At the ]>eginning of the year Mr. IIerl)ert S. Wood had charge of the editorial 
work; subsequently he was furloughed for several months, when Dr. Albert E. Jenks 
assumed editorial duties in connection with his I'esearches; in June Mr. Wood 
resumed his editorial cai)acity, and toward the end of May Mr. Elbert J. Benton was 
temi)orarily added to tiie c()ri)s as editorial assistant. The second part of the Eight- 
eenth Report was delivered from the bindery on January 7, and was inmie«liatelj' 
distributed; Bulletin 2(5 was delivered on March 11, and, after brief holding in the 
hope tl at the Nineteenth Report might be distributed at the same time, was sent out 
to the exchanges about the end of the year; separnlc copio,'^ of the papers composing 



KEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 57 

the Nineteenth Report were deUvered in March, but the liin<hiit,' of the voknnes was 
delayed hy rea^ion of unusual conditions in the Printing Othee, and tin- e<lition was 
not deUvered at the end of the year. On January 29 the Twentieth Annual Report 
was transmitted. It is designed for publication in one volume, and comprises, in 
addition to the formal report, the Holmes monograph on aboriginal j^ottery. The 
Twenty -first Annual Report was transmitted for printing on March 12. It, also, is 
designed to form one volume, comprising, in addition to tlie formal report, the 
memoirs on Hopi Katcinas, by Dr. Fewkes, and Iroquois Creation Myths, by Mr. 
Hewitt. On June 30 the Twenty-second Annual Report was transmitted for pub- 
lication in two volumes. It comprises, in addition to the administrative report. Two 
Summers' "Work in Pueljlo Ruins, by Dr. Fewkes, Quirigua Calendar Systems, l)y 
Dr. Thomas, and Hako: A Pawnee Ceremony, by Miss Fletcher. On January 29 Dr. 
Boas's memoir entitled Tsimshian Texts was transmitted for ])ublicati()n in bulletin 
form. At the close of the year material was in hand for the Twenty-third Report 
and for the greater part of the Twenty-fourth. 

Mr. De Lancey Gill remained in charge of the illustrative work, i^reparing cojjy 
for, and revising proofs of, the illustrations for the Twentieth and later i-ejiorts. He 
also made phot oport raits of sonic 200 Indians, chiefly mendxTs of delegations visiting 
Washington, and developed a consideral)le num])er of negatives made by the several 
collaljorators in the field, and, in addition, he made a useful series of field photo- 
graphs in connection with the work of Professor Holmes in Indian Territory, as 
noted elsewhere. As lieretofore, he was assisted by Mr. Henry Walther.

REPORT ON THE OPERATIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE 

SERVICE. 

Sir: I have the honor to suljmit tlie following report of the operations of the 
International Exchange Service dnring tlie year ending June 30, 1902: 

The work pertaining to exchanges is confined to the southeast basement of the 
Smithsonian buildhig. The rooms, five in number, extend along the south front for 
a distance of 144 feet, and in the main were especially constructed nine years ago for 
the exclusive use of the Exchange Service. Considerable space has since been added, 
making the shipping room much larger, and various improvements have been intro- 
duced to facilitate the handling of packages. 

The equipment of the Exchange offices is especially adapted to the peculiarities of 
the work, and consists, in addition to the necessary desks and their usual accessories, 
of several sorting tables for folding and arranging parcels, a large number of bins (each 
of which is used as the receptacle of all parcels for a single country until a sufficient 
quantity shall have at-cumulated to make a minimum shipment) , cases for reference 
books and directories, filing cases for ledger cards (upon which are recorded accounts 
of all exchanges with each correspondent), and cabinets for filing receipt and index 
cards and for general correspondence. Other articles of office furniture are type- 
writers, scales, trucks, etc. 

It is pertinent to state that most of the articles of office furniture and fixtures have 
been purchased from Smithsanian funds, the Congressional appropriations having 
been sufficient only for the payment of most of the salaries, a part of the transporta- 
tion expenses, and the jiurchase of expendable supplies for packing and office use. 

Since the last report of the Exchange Service, there have been no extensive addi- 
tions to the general ecjuipment of the Exchange offices except the construction of an 
hydraulic elevator for raising and lowering exchanges to and from the loading plat- 
form, and the placing of a scale with a weighing capacity of 2,500 ^lounds near the 
elevator shaft. The expense incurred l)y both these improvements was borne by the 
Institution. 

During the last fiscal year there has been no loss of exchanges transmitted to the 
Institution from abroad, so far as known, and but one instance in which outgoing 
exchanges have been lost or even damaged. The latter occurred February 1, 1902, 
when three boxes of exchanges for correspondents in South Australia were entirely 
destroyed by water while a lire was lieing extinguished in the hold of the steamsliip 
Jhurunid, which was loading at P>rooklyn, N. Y. Each contributor was notified of 
the loss, as is the custom of the Institution in sudi cases, witli the result that mo.st 
of the |iuhlications were duplicated. 

Thi! work performed by the Exchange Service during the yi'ar and tlie extent to 
which the influence of the service is felt throughout tlie civilized world is shown in 
its various features by the accompanying tables.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 



59 



During the year 08,647 packages were received from abroad for distribution, and 
87,149 packages of domestic iniblications were sent to correspondents outside the 
Tnited States, making a total of 125,796. The aggregate weight of these exchanges 
was 396,418 pounds, or an average of little over 3 pounds ])er package. It will thus 
be seen, by conii)arison with the last rei^ort, that while the total weight of the

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 61 

connection I beg leave to .suggest tliat were a representative of the Institution con- 
stantly on the ground, devoting^ his attention to the requirements, not only of our 
national lil)rary, 1)utof tlie various departmental lil)raries in the matter of exchanges, 
the returns for the pu])Iications now so generously distributed by the I'nited States 
would soon ))e greatly increased, if not (juite e(iualized. 

Following are the total number of parcels sent an<l received during tiie year: 

Shipments, 69 per cent: 

United States Government exchanges 52, 871 

Scientific and miscellaneous exchanges o4, 27S 

ST, 149 

Rei-eipts, 81 per cent: 

United States Gf)vernment exchanges 11, 290 

Scientific and miscellaneous exchanges 27, 357 

88, 647 

Total parcels 125, 796 

The number of correspondents in the United States has reached a total of 8,739, 
the increase during the year having l)een 590. There are now 38,200 names of 
libraries and individuals on the records* of the Exchange Service, representing an 
increase of 2,495 names during the year. 

The sum appropriated by Congress foi- the sup])ort of the International Ivxchanges 
during the fiscal year was |24,000, being the same as that granted for each of the two 
innneiliately jireceding years. The attention of Congress, through its conunittees, 
was called by the Secretary to the inadeciuacy of the aj>propriation on account of the 
fteady increase in the work of the service, the improvement inaugurated therein by 
i ubstituting ocean express for freight as a niedium of transi)ortation, and the addi- 
f.'onal requirements that the Institution would be obliged to meet by reason of the 
adoption by Congress on March 2, 1901, of a resolution re(juiring the Pul)lic Printer 
to deliver to the Library of Congress, for its own use and for international exchange, 
62 instead of 50 sets of Government publications, "except as such number shall be 
enlarged to not exceed 100 copies by request of the Liltrarian of Congress." On this 
account Congress, in its sundry civil act approved June 28, 1902, saw fit to grant an 
increase of $2,000, or $2(5,000 in all, for tlie next fiscal year. 

Owing to a readjustment of the duties of the dei)uty collectors of the i)ort of New 
York, Mr. Charles A. King sut'ceedeil Mr. John C. Williams on February 7, 1902, as 
the officer designated by tlu' collector to enter and care for international exchanges 
arriving from abroad. 

Despite the constant endeavors of the Institution to estaljlish more adequate 
exchange relations with the Governments of Japan and China, all efforts in that 
direction have thus far been futile. Only exchanges for governmental and native 
educational institutions in Japan can be distributed under the jn-esent arrangement, 
and all other contriljutions are therefore discouraged. In China no facilities are 
provided for the official distril)ution of exchanges, and the Institution has no means 
of distributing parcels in the Empire except those l)earing addresses in Shanghai, 
which are delivered by the courtesy of the Zi-ka-we'. Observatory. 

Thus far Great Britain, Germany, and Austria-Hungary have not adopted the 
custom prevailing elsewhere in Europe of officially providing for an international 
exchange of publications, and the Smithsonian Institution, with the aid of funds 
provided for the support of the Exchange Service, has been obliged to maintain 
salaried agents in each of these countries and to Dear the expense of distribution of 
parcels as well as for transporting the publications of those countries to the United 
States. It is hoped, however, that the steps that have been taken from time to time 
to adjust this inequality in the exchange system may eventually l)e successful. 

The Institution hag been especially fortunate in the selection o( its agents in those 
countries where no provision has been made officially for conducting exchanges.

(ioveniiiiental excliaii^'es for Qiiel)C'c, Ottawa, Toronto, Winnij^eg, and Mexico 
are not retained at the Institution until an entire box has accumulated, but are 
proiuptly dispatclied by legistered mail as soon as received. 

During the year several depositories have been added and reserve sets ha\ e l)een 
contributed, as follows: 

The Commonwealth of Australia, the seat of which is temporarily at Melbourne, 
was added in December, 1901, and on the 19th of that month 68 boxes were shipped 
in care of the attorney-general of the Commonwealth. 

On September 4, 1901, a shipment was made to the National Library of Ireland at 
Dublin, consisting of 81 boxes, and the same number was forwarded to the Legisla- 
tive Library at Quebec on July 26, 1901. 

The Legislative Library of INIanitoba at Winnipeg was jilaced on the list of deposi- 
tories January 16, 1902, Init only selections have thus far been provided. It is 
expected, however, that a more liberal contribution will be made when the addi- 
tional copies provided under the joint resolution of March 2, 1901, are received from 
the Public Printer.

$3,500. Besides this there has been spent for books, i)hotographs, apjiaratus, and 

office furnitiu'e the sum of $1,900. 

The approjiriation for the general service of the park was made iu the following

and drainage; and ior grading, planting, and otherwise inijiroving the grounds; 

73 



74 BEPOKT OF THE SECRETARY. 

erecting and re]>airing Imildings and inclosures; rare, pulisistenec, i)urohase, and 
transportation of animals; including salaries or compensation of all necessary 
employees; the purchase of necessary books and periodicals, the printing and pub- 
lishing of operations, not exceeding one thousand five hundred copies, and general 
incidental expenses not otherwise provided for, eighty thousand dollars; one-half of 
which sum shall be paid from the revenues of the District of Columbia and the other 
half from the Treasury of the United States; and of the sum hereby appropriated 
five thousand dollars shall be used for continuing the entrance into the Zoological 
Park from Cathedral avenue and opening driveway into Zoological Park, including 
necessary grading and removal of earth. (Sundry fivil act March 3, 1901.) 

Besides the regular cost of maintenance, the following alterations and additions to 
the buildings and grounds have been defrayed from this appropriation during the 
year: 

The flii'nui (■age. — This large cage, begun during the last year, has now been com- 
pleted and fitted with rockwork, planted with aquatic and other plants, and sup- 
plied with running water and pools. About f)!) birds are at present in the cage and 
it is hoped to increase the number consideral)ly next season. The cage forms a very 
attractive feature ()f the park. The expenditure from this year's appropriation in 
connection with it is al)out $5,000. 

Addition hi teniporari/ hlrd houtfe. — There being no suitable place for parrots, of 
which the collection included a considerable number, a room for them was added 
to the temporary bird house and divided into five large compartments. Several birds 
were put in each cage and they have nmch improved in health and attractiveness 
since this disj^osition of them was ma<le. This addition cost $700. 

Repair itKj elephant shed. — Attention has before been called to the dilapidated con- 
dition of the structure. It had become so open about the sides that it could not be 
made warm enough for the animal in cold weather. In the autumn of 1901 a layer 
of heavy buililing felt was ])ut on the sides and this was covered with siding, at a cost 
of $250. 

An appropriation of $20,000 was asked for a new house for elephants and other 
pachyderms, and at the close of the year $10,000 was appropriated for that purpose. 
This will provide for oidy a small house, the construction of which will be at once 
commenced. 

Cages for polar and Kodiak bear. — Two large yards for these bears were begun aljout 
the close of the year. Each will be about 40 feet square, with secure and comfortable 
house and a large bathing pof>l attached. The i-ages will cost, complete, alx )ut $ 1 ,800. 

Cage for eagles. — Shortly before the close of the year a cage for eagles was begun, 
50 feet by 27 feet and 35 feet high. It will contain a pool, a mass of rock, and ;i large 
tree on which the birds may perch. The cost will be $1,000. 

Carnivora house. — The large floor tank for alligators having become decayed and 
leaky, a new tank was T)uilt of concrete. A large case was also constructed in this 
building for boas antl pythons. This installation is not suitable for either tlie alliga- 
tors or the snakes, and the space which they occupy is needed for other puri)oses. 

Fountain. — At the Secretary's suggestion a fountain was construt-tcd in front of the 
carnivora house, at a cost of $350. 

Drireivay front. Calliedral arenne. — A portion of tlie till of earth n'cpiired was made 
from the appropriation for the previous year; fill was completed and roadway IS feet 
wide built, with telford base and top dressing of crushed stone. A small amotmt of 
work was also done at the ford on this road. Total cost $5,000, the amount of the 
special appropriation. 

Adams Mill mad. — By reason of its very steep grade, tiiis road is diliicult to main- 
tain. It became necessary to reshape the steej) portion ; the macadam was thoroughly 
loosened, the ctowu of the road remade, adding considerable new material, and the 
road finished with a new surface dressing of crushed limestone. 

Connecticut avenue entrance. — The roadway on Joliet street between Connecticut 
avenue and the park entrance was completed by the District on permanent lines, and

making it necesHiirv to <-l^aii,ut' Ihc line of the madway in tlio ])ark fur a <lislaiu'e of 
about 300 feet. 

A walk of crushed stone was cdnstwicted at the Adams Will road entrance to con- 
nect with the new <'oncrete tV'alk laid by the District in Ajiril of this year. Con- 
sideral)le work was done on other walks and a footbridge was erected to afford 
convenient access from the east bank of the creek, near the upper ford, to the west 
l)ank and the paddocks near by. 

Planting was carried on throughout tlic year. .\ screen of s!inil)s and small trees 
was set about the shop building and many slir-ubs and vines were planted around the 
othce building as a screen and foi- ornament. 

Ohtti't-raliniix on Jli/iii(j hinh. — The jiark, tln)Ugh full of interest for the jiuhlic, is not 
a i)laee of recrcMtion only, for though out; of its j)riniary objects is the instruetiou 
and I'eereation (jf the |)eoplc, auotliei- — indeed, the very lirst of all i)rescribeil by 
Congress — is the advancement of science, and for this latter we lUTist look to experi- 
ments in the future for which we have not means to-day. In i)ursuance of a purely 
scientilic problem, the park has recently procured optical a{)paratus for determiuing 
the interesting problem of the llight of the soaring bird ])y photograi»hing the great 
buzzard (C'i'///(ar/*'.swn//-a ) sinniltaneously fi-om twoadjacent temporary wooden towers 
which have been ei'ccted. 

Tlu' following are the more important accessions to the collection during the year: 

(jij'h. — Dr. F. W. (ioding, Tnited States consul at Newcastle, New South Wales, 
shipped several lots of animals by sailing vessels to San Francisco (thus securing free 
transportation). >b)st of the animals died during the long voyage. A fine sj)ecimeu 
of dingo, however, arrive<l in good condition, and a tine gray kangaroo an< I l)rusli- 
tailetl opossum were received shortly after the close of the year. Dr. (ioding is 
exceptionally well placed for getting animals, takes active interest, and exju'cts to 
get valuable specimens. He has been asked ti> forward future consignments by 
steamer to shorten the time of voyage. 

By E. II. Plumacher, Fnited States consul at ]\I;u-acaibo, a con.siderable consign- 
ment of animals was forwarded, but several died en route. A monkey and a fine 
specimen of two-toeil sloth were received in good order. (>thcr animals are to be 
sent soon. 

From Perry ]\I. De l^'on. United States consul-gencial at (iuyaqnil, l^cuador, a fine 
lot of animals was received, including parrots, a toucan, thnM' monkeys, and several 
smaller animals. He also forwarded two consignments by sailing vessel, but these 
died en route. 

From Solomon P>erliiuM-, United States consul at Teneriffe, two lanzarotte jiigeons 
and two choughs. 

From J. H. Slarin, New York, six harlxir seals. 

From Oscar .1. Craig, president University of Montana, a very line Ix-aver. 

From Stephen (iheen, Tower, Minn., a i)airof Canada lynx. 

From August Busck, United States Department of Agriculture, live Cuban boas. 

In connection with animals presented by Consul Plumacher, I wish to acknowl- 
edge the courtesy of Messrs. Boulton, J'liss & Dallet, of New York, in furnishing 
free transportation for animals on their Ped D Line of steamships from Maracaibo to 
New York. 

From Cajit. .bihii P. Voung, i)roj)rietor of Young's pier, Atlantic ('ity, N. J., a 
considi^rable numlier of fish were ol)tained for the aquarium. Captain Young also 
kindly assisted the agent sent by the park to procure specimens. 

YeUowstoiic Ndtloudl I'drk. — From this source there were received during the \ear 
four antelope, five nude deer, five elk, two cinnamon bears, one grizzly l»ear. 

The acting superintendent of the Yellowstone National Park sent word that liiere 
was opportunity to capture a grizzly. A steel cage-traj) was accordingly constructed 
in the shops of the National Zoological Park and shippe<l to the Yellowstone. A 



7() REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

(ine speciiiien was captured in this tni}) and forwarded to Washington, reaching its 
destination in good order. 

Exchanges. — Several exchanges were effected during the year. Among the ani- 
mals obtained were the following: From the New York Zoological Park, a very fine 
male axis deer; from the Zoological Society of London, a young female yak; from 
Thomas W. Gibson, of the department of crown lands, Ontario, Canada, eight black 
squirrels; from William Bartels, New York, a female Barl)ary sheep and a female 
polar bear. 

Births. — The number of births during the year has been quite satisfactory. It is 
gratifying to note that two beavers were born during the present season. 

Purchases. — Tender your instructions very special efforts have been made in the 
last three or four years to procure a Kodiak bear. The animal is by no means 
exterminated, but has fled to uninhabited, difficult regions, where it can not be 
obtained except by the expenditure of an inordinate sum of money, whereas it was 
formerly procurable in relative abundance. A young male was, however, procured 
during the present year through the cooperation of the Alaska Commercial Com- 
pany. It was captured on the mainland directly opposite Kodiak Island, and is 
believed to be the true Ursus middendorff'iL Efforts are being made to get more 
through the same agency. Considerable rewards for additional sj^ecimens have been 
offered throughout that region and are still advertised, though scj far without results. 

After years of effort two l)ighorn or Rocky Mountain sheep have been procured 
from western Colorado, one within the present year. It is desirable to explain that 
the Institution's extreme difticulty in procuring this animal, not at all an unfamiliar 
one to hunters, arises from the fact that the Institution proceeds scrupulously within 
the law, which requires a permit from the authorities of the State in each case. 
This is charily given, in some cases apparently through the opposition of game war- 
dens, who seem to have no sympathy with the Institution's aims. These permits, 
while only obtained with great difficulty, are given for a brief time and to a single 
individual. The whole system is apparently designed with a proper purpose to throw 
obstacles in the way of pro(;uring game by unfit persons. It actually operates to 
almost absolutely prevent its procurement l)y the General Government through insti- 
tutions or persons who are the fit reciiaients of the game, and as scrupulous in their 
desire to obey the State laws as the Smithsonian Institution is in its capacity as guar- 
dian of the Government interests in the National Zoological Park. Further than 
this, or indeed as a consequence of the practical refusal of permission nnder the law, 
the final effect is that nearly the only animals which are obtainable arc those for 
sale ])y persons wlio have taken them in defiance of the law. 

Other ])urchas('S wvre a male moose and a pair of Columl)ian black-taiU'(l deer 
from the International Forest, Fish, and (Jame Association, two female ])umas from 
northwestern Wyoming, two young California condors, a female South American 
tapir (as a mate for the male already in the collection), three red kangaroos, and a 
carabao, or Indian buffalo, from the Philippine Islands (inider recent regulations of 
the I)e])artment of Agricndture, to prevent the introduction of "surra," sucli animals 
can not now be imported) . A stock of birds was obtained for the flying cage, includ- 
ing a jjair of adjutants, six European storks, an ibis, and other birds. 

One of the bears procured in Alaska for the])ark in the sunnnerof 15»()(), being now 
ol<l enough for its identity to be deteniiini'd, is found to be the Yakutal l>car, I'rsu.s 
dalli. 

Losses of animals. — Two old bull bisons; death j)robably dnc to uld ;igi'; diagnosis 
gastroenteritis. One California sea-lion, from pneumonia. A mule and female 
moose, from gastroenteritis; received Novend)er, ISi)!), died l)ecend)er, 1901, and 
March, 1902; in good health until summer of 1901. Great dilliculty is still experi- 
enced in the care of these great forest animals. Three jjronghorn antelopes, includ- 
ing a buck that had been in the park five and a half years. One young elk, killed by 
an old bull. 



KEPOKT OF THE SECKETAKY. 77 

Fioin theeffectsof intestinal parasites: Three Newfonndiand auil)(>u,:i littiTdfarctic 
foxes, one adnlt fox, and onelnule deer. A number of otlier mule and other deer 
were affected. These jiarasites. \vereJiiroy)al)ly introduced and disti-i])uted b\' prowl- 
ing dogs. In order to extirpate them, the mule deer were treated and removed to 
another paddock; their former paddock was then disinfected by burning over the 
surface of the ground with a surface heater such as is used in repairing asplialt 
pavements. 

B<nindary Jhicc. — In making up the estimates for the appropriations for the next 
year, as for the jiast several years, the imperative need of a fence was again urged upon 
Congress. No special appropriation was made, liowever, but it was understood that 
the increase in the regular appropriation might be devoted to this purpose if the 
Secretary saw fit. 

Attention has ])een called in previous reports to the fact that no a(le(iuate provision 
for housing small tropical mammals exists in the i)ark. At present these animals are 
confined in small cages, which are sometimes placed on the top of others, thus injur- 
ing the appearance of the collection. The animals are also deprived of adequate 
exercise. Their mortality is therefore unnecessarily great. The park receives every 
yearaconsideral)le number of such animals, particularly from the new possessions of 
the United States, and is very much embarrassed to find room for them. For those 
at present at hand, not considering any future additions, there is n'(|uired a space of 
140 linear feet of cages. It is recommended that Congress be asked to appropriate a 
sufficient sum to build a suitable house for tropical mammals where they can be kept 
in better health and comfort than they are now a])le to enjoy. 

No dei)artment of the jiark attracts more popular interest than the a(Hiarium, an<l 
its educational value is cei'tainly very great. The present installation of this collec- 
tion of salt-water and fresh-water species in a mere temporary shed is, however, so 
entirely inadequate to its needs that I would urge the construction of a suitable build- 
ing fitted with permanent tanks, heating and refrigerating apparatus, and open pools. 

In. accordance with the Secretary's wish to see a larger development given to the 
salt-water fauna, a concrete tank, covered with a glass roof, was built for the storage 
of sea water, and the north side of the building will 1)e devoted to this part of the 
exhilntion. A new filter has been [trovided, and other minor improvements have 
been made. 

Another important need is a reptile house where the great tortoises, crocodiles, 
alligators, Ixjas, |)ythons, anacondas and other reptiles belonging to the collection can 
be exhil)ited, and where other specimens obtained from time to time can 1)e housed. 
These reptiles are now placed in the same house with the lions, tigers, and other cats. 

The park very much needs an aviary for small terrestial birds. The ])resent bir<l 
house in almost entirely occupied by struthious and aquatic; birds, the song birds 
being wholly unrepresented. In connection with such an aviary there should be 
built a flying-cage of moderate size, with a tunnel of cage work througli which the 
public can walk, surrounded by singing birds flitting about in every direction. 

The collection of wolves and foxes has hitherto been kept in a series of temporary 
pens near the principal animal house. These inclosures are far from satisfactory, as 
they soon l)econie dilapidated and permit the animals to dig out or break thi'ough. 
New and permanent quarters for these animals slutuld be erected in some suitable 
part of the park. 

The sea-lions and seals now iri the park are not provided with proper quarters. 
As the turbidity of the water in the large pool seriously injured them they have 
recently been confined in cages l)uilt for the bears near the Quarry Road entrance. 
They have here only very small basins of water and are not able to swim about at 
all. Houses and a pond of filtered water should be jjiovided for them. 

The attendance of visitors at the park has been steadily increasing. At [iresent the 
average daily nmal,)er of visito:-; is larger than ever before, and 0:1 several occasions 
30,000 persons have been in tlu' i)ark in a single day. This increase in attendance 



78 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 



further emphasizes the need for more efficient restaurant facilities. At jiresent there 
is no suitable restaurant, only an open jjavilion where candy, cakes, and light bever- 
ages are sold. As the park is at a considerable distance from the city, the al)sence of 
a properly equipped restaurant is a great inconvenience to those wishing to spend the 
day in it, particularly if they are accompanied by children. The erection of a public- 
comfort building especially equipped for ladies and children, and with a restaurant 
attached, is therefore very desirable. 

It would be jnuch more satisfactory as well as less expensive if sufficient appro- 
priations could be made to jirovide i)ermanent buildings as rapidly as they are 
required by the public needs and the gro^^•th of the collection. At present a con- 
siderable jiart of the ai)propriation has to be spent each year in repairing temporary 
structures. The park has now T)een in operation long enough to safely determine 
where i^ermanent improvements should l)e placed. 

The principal object for which the park was originally instituted was the jireserva- 
tion of our national game, especially that which is becoming extinct. This has 
been represented to Congress, but as yet no special provision has been made for it. 
According to your recommendation an appropriation will again be asked for collect- 
iug and preserving some of the great land and marine specimens of our western 
territory now rapidly disappearing. Experience has abundantly proved that such 
wild creatures, unaccustomed as they are to the sight of man, can not proj^ierly be 
transported inunediately after capture, as they are likely to seriously injure them- 
selves or even to die of friglit if some means are not taken to gentle them or accus- 
tom them to being handled. I can therefore entirely agree to the value of the 
method you have proposed of establishing some small station or stations in Alaska 
where there are yet found specimens of the Kodiak bear, the great moose, the wal- 
rus, the fur seal, and possibly other large creatures. They could there be confined 
and kept amidst familiar scenes and be fed iipon their natural food while becoming 
more accustomed to tlie sight of man and more tractable. The expenditure for such 
stations would be slight. 

I have already mentioned that after years of effort the park lias at last procured 
one Kodiak bear cub. Bears as a rule do not breed freely in captivity, but it is most 
desirable to try the experiment, under such favorable conditions as the park may 
afford, and I hope that more animals of this species may be obtained. 

I close with a list of the animals of the i:)ark on June 30, 1902, and with a reitera- 
tion of the statement that the ])ark is nevertheless not filling its i)rincii)al function 
until it can maintain and jireserve for posterity the most important specimens of the 
great vanishing fauna of this country, and particularly of Alaska.

REPORT OF THE WORK OF THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY FOR 
THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 80, 1902. 

Sir: The kinds and amounts of the Observatory jiroperty are approximately as 
follows: 

Buddings $6, 300 

Apparatus 33, 300 

Library and records 6, 000 

Total 45, 600 

During the past year the acquisitions wf i)roperty of tlie kind just enumerated have 
l)een as follows: 

(a) Ajiparatus. — Astronomical and })hysica< apparatus has ]>een purchased at an 
expenditure of $2,000. 

(b) Library and records. — Tlie library has been enlarged by the addition of jieriodi- 
cals and books of reference at an expenditure of $200. Books and periodicals have 
been bound at an expenditure of $250. Total for library, $450. 

The observatory inclosure, shown in Plates VI, VII, has been enlarged by the addi- 
tion of 10 feet along its northern end so as to be now 155 by 77 and to include nearly 
12,000 square feet, as against 11,000 square feet formerly. The photographic building 
has l)een removed from a position west to a position north of the siderostat, and the 
buildings and fence have been repainted. These alterations and repairs have been 
made at an expenditure of $400. 

No losses of property have occ-urred. 

The Work of the Observatory. 

For convenience, the work of the Oliservatory will he descril)ed under the follow- 
ing headings : 

1. Publications and niiscellaneous work. 

2. Progress of investigations. 

( 1) ]'i(Ji/ic(ttl<ins mid iri!xrrJhr)ir()i(>< irorJ:. 

In accordance with a resolution of the Senate of the United States," a report was 
submitted by you at the meeting of Congress in December, showing the api)ropria- 
tion.s expended, results reached, and present condition of the work of the Astro- 
physical Observatory. This report consisted of a brief statement of the foundation, 
aims, results, and present condition of the OVjservatory ; a copy of Vohnue I of its 
Annals; a preliminary report of its eclipse expedition of 1900; and several state- 
ments ^ by eminent foreign and domestic men of science, giving their views of the 

« Senate resolution of February 25, 1901. 

& As indicating the nature of these statements, I here give extracts from two of them : 

"I caii not deny myself the pleasure of congratulating you on the accomplishment 
of this vast and important labor. When I think of what it must all have been, I am 
lost in admiration at the work."— Sir G. G. Stokes. 

"To anyone who is conversant with the astronomical work done in recent years it 
seems Vvdiolly unnecessary to testify to the immense value of the work done at the

merits of the Observatory and its works. This report was referred in the Senate to 
the Committee on the Library and ordered to be printed with all its inclosures. It 
therefore became necessary to supply some new copies of illustrations for the 
engravers, and opportunity was offered to correct a number of errors discovered in 
Volume I of the Annals, so that this new edition, forming a part of Senate Document 
No. 20, is considerably improved. The preparation of the first drafts for the report, 
the preparation of new illustrations, and the reading of proofs naturally occupied con- 
siderable time of the Observatory staff. Several hundred copies of this edition of 
the Annals were secured for the Observatory, and thus it will be possible to supply 
a limited number to those who may from time to time make request for them. 

Of the numerous inquiries addressed to the Institution by correspondents all over 
this country and the world, many relating to astronomy, physics, and chemistry are 
referred to this Observatory for answer, and thus an amount of time by no means 
trifling is spent on work of no immediate concern to the Observatory researches. 
However, the search for the information asked for so frequently leads to obtaining 
knowledge of value in our own work, that it is on the whole, perhaps, time well 
spent, independent of considerations of the convenience of the Institution's 
correspondents. 

(2) Progress of ■invcstigatiuvs. 

The solar radiation; its total amount and its absorption.— Yon showed long since that 
ordinary actinometry, or measures confined to the investigations of white light, can 
never furnish trustworthy data in relation to the output of the sun, since the 
absorption of our air is so different for different wave lengths that it is only by going 
further and examining the spectrum in detail that satisfactory results are obtain- 
able. This kind of energy spectrum work has been taken up very extensively here 
in the past year. 

The solar energy spectrum.— The early work of this Observatory described in Volume 
1 of its Annals was chiefly concerned with the minute absorption bands in the infra- 
red solar spectrum. As all readers of the Annals are aware, automatic prismatic 
energy curves were made by the aid of the holographic process, and such inflections 
of these curves as were found not accidental in their origin corresponded to the 
so-called Fraunhofer lines of the visible spectrum. Less attention was paid to the 
whole height of these curves at their various parts than to these numerous small 
variations in height. Still, a chapter of the Annals was devoted to the inferences 
relating to the absorption of our atmosphere which could be drawn from the data 
relating to secular variations in the general form of the curves then available. But 
since the curves were taken at a slow speed to allow full time for recording the 
small inflections, the total heights were less comparable, owing to possible changes 
in the transparency of the air, the altitude of the sun, and the behavior of the appa- 
ratus which miglit intervene l)ctweeu start and close of a curve. 

NEW wo UK. 

The absorption of Ike atmosphere and of the xnlar rn^v/oyje-— This present year care has 
been taken to obtain energy curves whose heights shall be comparable. It was the 
purpose of this work to study the general absorption of the sun's envelope, the gen- 
eral absorption of the earth's atmosphere, and the changes in the selective absorp- 
tion of water vapor in the latter. It is the further object toward which these studies 



Astrophysical Observatory under your superintendence. The bolometer, Avhich 
science owes to your inventive resource, is one of the boldest and most original 
instruments ever devised for scientific research. It permits the exploration of a field 
which is entirely closed to any other means of investigation. The many results 
which you have obtained with this instrument are deemed by all astronomers of the 
very highest importance in the study of those parts of the spectrum concerning 
which we should otherwise have remained in ignorance." — Sir Robrkt S. Ball. 



REPOKT OF THE SECRETARY. 87 

tend to see if the sun is const^it or variable in its output of radiation. While the 
results of the past year indicate possibility of considerable ultimate success in this 
final object, it may probably prove that the situation of this Observatory is vmsuita- 
ble t(j the most exact studies of this kind, owing to the great and variable absorj^ 
tion of the air column above it, as well, of course, as to the ground tremors inherent 
in its present site, surrounded by the traffic of city streets. It seems certain, how- 
ever, that ^'aluable contributions to the methods of study to be adopted in work at 
more favorably situated stations, and to the knowledge of terrestrial absorption, can 
be made here. 

Alterations of the cqyparatus. — For the sake of accuracy in the height of the curves, 
the speed of taking energy curves has been much increased. Thus we now custom- 
arily ado])t the speed ratios 2 centimeters of plate and 20 minutes of arc of spectrum 
in 1 minute of time, while the ratio 1 cm.= V = Im. was the standard one adopted 
for the detailed study of the infra-red si>ectrum. At the present speed the spectrum 
between wave lengths 0.45 /< in the blue and 2.5 /< in the infra-red is passed over in 
fifteen minutes. Such a spectrum energy curve is shown in Plate VIII. At this 
fast speed much less opportunity offers for "drift," alteration of sensitiveness of the 
galvanometer, and, what is far more commoix, for clouds or haze to diminish the 
accuracy of the work. In order to keep the behavior of the apparatus as constant 
as jjossible and to get the best jiossible detail at tins rapid sj^eed, the great glass prism 
has been empLjyed instead of rock salt, thus limiting the research to wave lengths 
less than 3 //. But this includes nearly all the solar radiation which reaches the sea 
level. To avoid extra reflecting and absorbing surfaces as far as practicable, a single 
mirror is used for collimation of the spectroscope in place of the two employed for- 
merly when great detail was sought, and the bolometer case is used oj^en at the end, 
although a slight amount of accidental disturbance of the record is involved on 
windy days. In the interest of the greatest detail practicable at the fast speed, it 
was most desirable to shorten the time of swing of the galvanometer. A new gal- 
vanometer of most approved design has been constructed and has been in use since 
Decend^er, at an average time of single swing of 1.5 seconds. This type of galva- 
nometer is in some respects, I think, new and worth a brief description, which will be 
found on a later page. To avoid errors from differences of diffraction from the edges 
of the slit, the slit width has been maintained unaltered at 0.25 mm., subtending 
10.5 seconds of arc in the spectrum. Its height, 5 centimeters, has been virtually 
reduced to 2 centimeters in the infra-red portion of the spectrum by the expedient 
of interposing across it at the proper time a brass grill-shaped diaphragm, which, 
being fixed upon pivot bearings on the slit mounting, always occupies tlie same 
l)lace when interposed before the slit. The factor of this diajihragm can be meaa- 
ureil by the aid of data found on each curve, but the results are constant within the 
limits of measurement. Bolometer No. 20, of 0.08 millimeter width and snl)tend- 
ing 10 seconds of arc, has been used for the entire year. This bolometer has been in use 
nearly all the time since it was made in 1896, and alwa\s witli great freedom from 
drift and other disturbance. Soon ■aHvy my return from Sumatra I suggested, and 
you caused to be constructed at the Observatory shop, a more improved type of 
mechanical rheostat for the bolometer, which lias been used since with great satis- 
faction. Drift of the galvanometer spot now rarely reaches 4 centimeters in a day, 
and it is rarely in excess of 2 millimeters upon an energy curve taken in fifteen 
minutes. So firm is confidence in the behavior of the bolometer that the unshunted 
galvanometer is left in connection with the circuit weeks at a time. No rebalancing 
of the circuit is required for a month at a time. One can now prejiare for holo- 
graphic work one day and the next merely start the siderostat and the driving clock 
with practical certainty of securing a good holograph. 

Tlie absorption of the ajyparatus. — In order to know the true distribution of the 
radiations throughout the spectrum, it has been necessary to determine the absorp- 
tion of the spectroscope. As mirror surfaces deteriorate, this has to be done not 



88 UEPOKT OF THE SECRETARY. 

infrequently. The procedure adopted has given the absokite loss by reflection at 
the siderostat mirror for all wave lengths, and the relative loss for the several wave 
lengths in the remainder of the apparatus. Without here detailing the procedure at 
great length, it is sufficient to say that the operation consists of two parts. First a 
second spectroscope is set up whose spectrum is formed at the slit of the first. Here 
the bolometer is placed and its indications read for several points in the spectrum. 
The bolometer is then replaced at its usual stand and energy curves of the small 
portions of spectrum it has just been measuring are taken. These bits of spectrum, 
it will be seen, have suffered absorption in the main spectroscope since the corre- 
sponding deflections were first taken in the first spectrum at the slit. Therefore the 
several quotients of the areas under the bits of energy curve to the deflections 
obtained prior to absorption are in proportion to the transmission of the spectrost'ope 
at the several wave lengths. 

In the second part of the procedure two freshly silvered mirrors are placed jiarallel 
to each other ni such a way that the beam of the siderostat mirror strikes the first, 
is reflected to the second, and thence to the spectroscope. This causes the spectrum 
to be weaker at all wave lengths by loss experienced from two reflections than when 
obtained with the beam from the siderostat mirror direct. Thus is the absorption of 
the two mirrors determined, and by replacing the siderostat mirror temporarily by 
one of them, its al)sorption follows at once. These determinations of the al)sorption 
of the apparatus have been made several times, but I will not here give their results 
more in detail, which are in general accordance with those already reached by you. 

Absorption of the atmosphere and selective absorption of imter vapor.— ^mcQ January 20 
all favorable opportunities have been used to take quick speed energy curves. These 
have been made with quite different altitudes of the sun. Sometimes as many as 15 
have been taken in one day, and 160 were secured between January 20 and July 1. 
These curves are studied from two points of view, first, as regards the variation in 
height for single wave lengths with different altitudes of the sun; second, as regards 
the variation in area and especially the areas of the great regions of water- vapor 
absorption. The first kind of examination leads to the determination of the general 
absorption of the air, the second to fixing the variations in amount of the solar radia- 
tion and of the special selective absorption of water vapor. 

To illustrate the first method of study, let us suppose several energy curves to have 
been taken in a single clear day, during which the barometer height was (B), and 
let (Bq) be the standard barometric height, generally taken as 76 cm. From the 
altitudes of the sun as com})uted from the hour angles and declination, the air mass 
(m) is determined. This (juantity represents the ratio which the mass of air traversed 
by the solar l)eam bears to that mass of air which would be traversed if the sun was 
directly overhead. If we suppose [e) to represent the amount of radiant energy per 
square centimeter of a certain wave length which reaches the earth's surface, and 
(fj the amount prior to absorption by the earth's atmosphere, and let [a) be the 
proportion transmitted per unit air mass, then by the well-known formula of 
Bouguer:" 

B 
e^e^a B^ 

But since the height {d) of the holographic energy curve at the wave length in 
question is projjortional to {e), we may write: 

B 
d^};e=ke,a^'^B, 

«As you have pointed out, this formula is grossly abused frequently in that (a) is 

treated as if constant for all wavelengths. Thus entirely erroneous results are 

reached. The present use of the forimda merely assumes {a) constant over the 

extremely narrow region of spectrum covering the bolometer strip at any given 

instant. As thus ap])lied it is bi^lieved that good results are reached. If single wave-

where (A) is an inytrumentaliactor connected with the vvidtli of the sHt, the absorji- 
tion of the optical surfaces, the (luality of the bolometer, and the sensitiveness of the 
galvanometer. We may assume {rj and (k) to be constant for the short si)ace of 
time occupied by one day's observations. We then obtain the following equation: 

log. {d)=myr log. (rt)+ log. (Av',j) 

of which the last term is I'onstant. This etjuation is in the form of the ecjuation of a 
straight line, so that if we make a plot in whicii heights are proportional to 

T> 

logarithms of ((/), and horizontal distances to values of (m=f> ), the various observa- 
tions should determine a straight line the tangent of whose inclination is the quan- 
tity log. («). 

The procedure has l)een followed with many of the energy curves already taken, 
and from results of four of the clearest days I select the following data for a few 
wave lengths, graphically rei)resented in Fig. 'A. The coetlicients of transmission are 
the jiercentages of the solar radiation of the given wave lengths which are transmitted 
by a vertical colunni of air at standard ])arometi'ic i)ressnre. It is not the selective 
transmission in bands, but the general transmission at the given wave lengths which 
is here in (juestion.

90 REPOET OF THE SECRETARY. 

It will be noted that though the agreement of these values would not be held 
very close in some lines of physical investigation, yet when it is taken into account 
that an invisibly thin cloud or an unaccountable disturbance of the galvanometer is 
sometimes suflicient to make an energy curve erroneous, the results pronuse well. 
It is yet too early to do more than call attention to the depression in the curve in 
the yellow and green at about 0.55//. This may be due to the absorption of water 
vapor, but experiments here given are preliminary. Results of interest appear 
probable in relation to the applicability of Bouguer's formula to wave lengths where 
selective absorption is active, and relating to the variation of atmospheric absorption 
through the day and through the year. It will be observed from the preceding table 
that the general absorption is least at wave lengths 1.05 /< and 1.30/< in the infra red, 
where the transmission coefficient rises to 95 per cent. 

As an illustration of the results obtained from measures of areas, and representing 
total radiation for considera))le ranges of wave lengths, I call attention to the diagrams 
of Plate IX. In these diagrams the horizontal distances represent the time of the year, 
the vertical distances the corrected areas or total radiation received, corresponding to 
certain selected portions of the curve. The observations on which these selected areas 
are based were all made at or near noon. In order that the several spectrum energy 
curves might be comparable as regards instrumental conditions, all the directly meas- 
ured areas were nmltiplied by a factor chosen so that, as corrected, the curves w'onld 
all be of a uniform height of 10 centimeters at 1.05 /<, where the transmission, as I 
have just pointed out, is greatest. The upper line in Plate IX represents the total area 
included under the energy curve between wave lengths 0.76 /< and 1.98 /<. The lower 
full line includes thesummation of several portionsof this area known to be least subject 
to diminution by the absorption of water vapor, namely, the regions 0.97 i-i to 1.10 /<, 
1.16/< to 1.33 /1, 1.49 /< to 1.82/1. Crossing itat manypointsis a dotted line represent- 
ing the summation of the remaining areas, including the great water vapor bands of the 
infra red to a wave length of 1.98 /<. These curves (prolonged through July and August 
for additional interest) show how important are the effects of water vapor on the direct 
radiations we receive from the sun. In order to compare the several parts of the 
curves justly, times equidistant from the June solstice should be .selected so that 
equal air masses are traversed. The differences in air mass are not sufficient to pro- 
duce much effect upon the general absorption in this region, l)ut affect the water- 
vapor absorption appreciably. It will be seen that the total solar radiation in the 
region between 0.76 // and 1.98 // was on an average fully 15 per cent greater in March 
of this present year than in August, on account of the greater absorption of water 
vapor. Comparing the separate points, it may be seen that the variation in water- 
vapor absorption, while, as Ave have just seen, on the whole seasonal, is j'et very fluc- 
tuating from day to day. Thus, for example, it could be inferred from a discussion of 
the curve in March that in two api)arently equally clear days of the same week there 
was a difference of 15 per cent in the solar radiation received, owing to the difference 
in water-vapor al)sor))tion. In sharp contrast to the variability of the areas of the 
water-va])iir absdrption regions is the In'hux ior df llic remaining i)ortion-of the spec- 
trum. This contains some secondary hut still considerable water-vapor bands, 
so that some fluctuation still remains. I>ut it seems possible as a result of this study 
that certain large regions, notably that between wave lengths 0.97 // and 1.10 /<, are 
so nearly unaffected in area by any terrestrial atmospheric absorptimi that they can 
serve to indicate if the total solar radiation fluctuates from year to year. 

Absorption of tlie ml ar envelope. — The experiments on the absorption of the solar 
envelope briefly mentioned in last year's report were continued as far as i>racticable 
with the apparatus available. Fig. 4 shows the results thus far reached. Hori- 
zontal distances are proportional to wave lengths, vertical distances to transmission 
coefficients. These transmission coefficients are not exactly similar to the ones just 
given f(jr the earth's atniosphere. If we represent the intensity of the radiation we

receive from the center' of the solar disk as unity, then as we measure farther and 
farther from the center the intensity will diminish, owing to the absorption the rays 
experience in the ever-increasilig length of path they traverse in the solar envelope. 
Different wave lengths are differentlv diminished. The figure gives the fractions 
remaining for the intensity at points distant 95 per cent and 98 per cent of the radius 
from the center. Referring to Fig. 3, we see that in both the solar and the terrestrial 
atmosphere the absorption is least in the infra red, and indeed follows a somewhat 
similar curve throughout the range of wave lengths here investigated. The accuracy 
of the results is not great enough to insist on the significanc* of the inflections which 
appear in the curves given, but here also there is a similarity between the terrestrial 
and solar curves. Owing to the imperfection of the large solar image, due to "l)oil- 
ing" of the air, to the rotation of the field ]iy the siderostat, and to the fact that the 
image was enlarged l)y a convex mirror from about 3 centimeters diameter to 40 
centimeters, it seemed useless to attempt iirojected further measurements, including 
some on the radiation of sun spots, until some better way of producing the solar 
image was arranged for. Experiments which have been made for this purjiose will 
be descril)ed under another ca})ti(in.

I take mucli pleasure in sajdng that the work of taking energy curves foi' deter- 
mining solar and terrestrial absorption, the measurements <if oi'dinates and areas, 
and preliminary reductions, onlj' a very few of which 1 have here given, have bccti 
etiiciently done by the junior assistant, Mr. F. I']. Fowle. 

iSt'iidtipc (jdlniiiiintrtir. — In my last report I stated at s<iine leiiglli tlie |)rogr(.'ss made 
and looked for in increasing tlu^ working sensitiveness of the galNaiiomctcr. it was 
stated that a modified form of needle system was projiost'd, mucli iieavier and 
probably not less sensitive than those then in use. Tiie (k'sign there referred to was 
based j^artly on experiments which had been made wliich showed that two f^mall 
thin magnets could be placed within a distance ecpial to their own dianaeter without 
suffering nmch loss of combined magnetic moment. If this proved ai>plicable to a 
system of numerous magnets it would be possible to increase the nund)er of mag- 
nets to a hundred or more without loss of sensil)ility overbalancing the gain which 
would result from decreasing the relative moment of inertia of tlie nouuiagni'tic 
material. Shortly after my return from Sumatra a needle system of this kind was 
constructed, containing 120 magnets, 60 at each end, separated b}^ spaces equal to 
the thickness of the needles. The problem of arranging them thus proved a pretty 
difficult one, but w^s solved, though after a fashion not quite satisfactory. It was 
a disappointment to find, however, that the sensitiveness of this sy.stem was only 



92 REPOET OF THE SECRETARY. 

one-third as great as that of the very light system then in use. To discover the 
cause of this a hirge number of experiments were made on the magnetic moment of 
needles of various sizes and shapes between weights of 0.0006 and 0.0030 milligrams, 
and on combinations of them at various distances. In the course of this investigation 
it was again shown (as had already been accepted here) that for magnets between the 
limits of five and fifty times as long as thick, the magnetic moment is directly propor- 
tional to the product of the weight by the ratio of the length to the diameter. This 
relation is, and has been for some years, a fundamental consideration in the construc- 
tion of galvanometer needles here. But though no error appeared in this assumption, it 
was found that the other, that a great number of magnets could be combined Avithout 
much lo.ss within a distance apart equal to their diameter, was quite unsound. AVhile 
this is the case for two magnets, it is not so for a larger number. They can not 
advantageously be placed at a distance apart less than 3 diameters without a consid- 
erable loss of total magnetic moment. This is the case whether the needles are first 
magnetized and then approached or magnetized in position. It is slightly better to 
keep them 4 diameters apart. This condition prevented making needle systems such 
as were proposed, but a greater we'ight of system seemed so very desirable that new 
devices were discussed. Six needles in a group seemed to be about the limiting 
numl)er which could be used with advantage, so that to get more than 12 needles to 
a system retiuired more than 2 groups to put them in. It was proposed to use 16 
coils instead of 4 in the galvanometer, thus allowing 8 groups of needles or 48 in all. 
This involved a deliberate sacrifice of sensitiveness. Allowing for the several coun- 
terbalancing effects, it was computed that the sensitiveness at a time of swing of one 
second would be only about one-half or two-thirds as great for a 16-coil instrument 
as for a 4-coil instrument of equal resistance. But it was confidently believed that 
the steadiness of the former and its better capacity for use at higher times of swing 
would more than compensate this loss. 

Accordingly a 16-coil galvanometer, with needle system containing 48 magnets and 
weighing nearly 10 milligrams, was constructed. Its sensitiveness was found to be 
about as computed, and its steadiness is so much superior to that formerly employed, 
both as regards drift and tremor, that it has been used since December with most 
marked advantage for holographic work. So entirely satisfactory has it proved that 
another 16-coil galvanometer with needle system, weighing 0.012 grams, has been 
constructed for use on the great suspension system of which I spoke last year. A 
large number of separate needles are weighed, measured, and their magnetic 
moments determined before the 48 are selected, so that no opportunity is allowed for 
a few weak ones to lower the sensitiveness and injure the astaticism of the combi- 
nation. The system is strongly magnetized after its completion by the aid of a 16- 
coil electro-magnet. In the making up of these needles to form the system, a new 
process of fastening the magnets has been devised by which results very superior to 
any heretofore obtained here are reached. 

Further experiments on the exhaustion of the air from the galvanometer case have 
been made. It was found extremely difficult to prevent leakage of air into the instru- 
ment, and this when it occurred caused "drift." This difficulty has at length been 
practically overcome. It had been supposed that a pressure of 1 millimeter or there- 
abouts would be (juite as low as would be necessary with a 10-second single swing. 
But even with the heavy needle system now in use, the damping became excessive at 
2.5 secondssingle swingand 0.08 millimeter pressure. The pressure was reduced to0.20 
millimeter, and next the time of single swing was raised to 5.5 seconds, before damp- 
ing became excessive. The very promising result was reached that the deflection was 
proportional to the .square of Ike time of .wing up to a time of single swing of above 5 
seconds. Further exhaustion of the air proved impossible at the time, owing to the 
vapor pressure of the wax and grease used about the galvanometer. But by a modi- 
fication of the outer case, it is believed that this difficulty can be overcome, and that 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 93 

the aim last year set forth to carry the proportionahty Ijetween deflection and square 
of tlie time of swing np ti> lOl^econds single swing will at length be reached. (Ireat 
steadiness was observed at 5:5. seconds swing. A deflection of 1 millimeter (in the 
scale then actually corresponded to a current of only ioooo(r()oon(]o amperes in the 
galvanometer. The resistance of the instrument is only 1.6 ohms. A current of one- 
tenth this magnitude — or 5X10 " amj)eres — could actually have lieen measured. 
Further advance is confidently expected. 

Permnal-etjiKtfion iti<irji!iu\ — You have placed at the (Jl)servatory for trial an instru- 
ment of your own design intended to eliminate the so-called personal equation of 
individual observers in transit observations. The principle of this instrument con- 
sists in substituting a judgment of the place where a sudden phenomenon occurred 
for the time when it occurred. To use an illustration which you have already 
employed, in case the dark field in which only the star is seen moving were illumi- 
nated every two seconds by a self-recording flash whicli showed the central wire, 
and if by pure accident the star was caught in an exact bisection when the flash 
came — an accident against which the chances are perhaps more than a hundred 
to one — it is evident that in this rare and improbable event there would be no jier- 
sonal equation to allow for, if the time of flash within two seconds were noted by 
the observer. Now, the object of the following mechanism maybe said to be to 
make this accident hap])en every time. 

This being understood, as first tried with the apparatus which you furnished, the 
design was to ilUiminate the cross wires of the transit instrument by automatically 
recorded electric flashes occurring at regular intervals equal to the time elapsing 
between passages of the star acro.ss successive wires. An adjustal)lemechanism allowed 
the ol)server to hasten or defer the whole system of flashes until by successive adjust- 
ments he caught the exact instant when the star was bisected by the dark wire in 
the instantaneously l)right field. Several such adjustments could l)e made (hiring a 
single star transit across the numerous wires of the tally, and immediately after each 
satisfactory l)isection a signal was made on the chronograph by a key in the hand of 
the observer, so that only such recorded flashes as were thus distinguished were used 
in determining the time of transit. 

In order to test the value of this instrument an artificial star was caused to move 
through the field at a rate about equal to that of a real equatorial star. This star 
was moved by a screw and clockwork of great accuracy, and always through the 
same portion of the screw. It was also provided that when the star was exactly 
bisected l)y the middle wire an electrical contact was broken, so that the star recorded 
its own transit upon the chronograpli. The adjustment of the contact for this 1)isec- 
tion was made at leisure with the star stationary, and was therefore not su])ject to 
the personal error of transit observations. Accordingly, after determining all the 
wire intervals, it was entirely easy to measure the personal etiuation of the observer, 
whether he used the personal-equation machine or the ordinary method, merely by 
comparing his observed time of transit with that recorded by the star itself. Fpon 
trial it was found that the personal equation of the several observers was not wholly 
l)revented by employing the machine in the manner described; that is, by bisections 
judged during instantaneous flashes. The writer, for example, observed about G. 1:.* 
second too early by both methods. 

It seemed probable that the observer was still l^iased in his judgment by watching 
the march of the star through the field across the very faintly showing wires, which 
are always to be made out by the stray light of the star and sky, even though there 
is no illumination by the flash. Accordingly it seemed to promise success to alter 
the arrangement so that the star would be hidden except at the instants correspond- 
ing to those when the flash had formerly appeared, and to steadily illuminate the 
field as is usual in transit instruments. In the test this was easier than in actual 



94 REPOKT OF THE SECRETARY. 

practice, for the artificial star itself could be obscured by a shutter immediately in 
front of it, which could be removed instantaneously by the electric signal from the 
personal-equation machine. The same thing could, however, be done at the focal 
plane of the telescope in real use. 

Upon trial this device justified all hopes. Three observers whose habit is to 
observe, one too early, one too late and the other very close to the true time, were 
found all to observe as close to the truth as the accidental errors would admit, 
which in the case of the 3-foot focus transit instrument employed was generally 
within 0.03 second. In other words, personal equation seems to be wholly eliminated 
by this procedure. The general design may be applied without great expense to any 
outfit of transit and chronograph. 

Provininn for- great solar image.— As already said, the experiments on solar absorp- 
tion, nature of sun spots and other phenomena required for their successful continu- 
ation a large solar image free from rotation and as free as possible from "boiling" 
and from ojjtical defects. Among these latter it will be evident that variations in 
absorption and in magnification at different portions of the image were quite serious, 
as well as the ordinary defects of definition. To magnify a small image to the 
required diameter seemed to be very undesirable, for several reasons, chief of which 
were the optical defects just spoken of and the increased "boiling" due to the 
heating at the small focal image. The use of the siderostat was objectionable on 
account of its rotating the field. 

You have therefore decided to use the coelostat and a concave mirror of long 
enough focus to form the image of the desired size without a second magnifica- 
tion. The coelosfat, which I understand you to have been first employed by you 
as a working instrument on a large scale (in 1882), is essentially a plane mirror 
rotating on an axis parallel with the axis of the earth at the rate of one revolution 
in forty-eight hours. It is unable to send the reflected beams from objects at dif- 
ferent declinations in the same direction, and if used to provide a horizontal 
reflected beam from the sun, must send it in a more southerly direction in summer 
than in winter. In this latitude the extreme directions reached by a horizontal 
coelostat beam would be, respectively, about 30° north and 30° south of an east and 
west line. To avoid moving the concave mirror and other apparatus to suit the 
shifting direction of the coelostat beam, it has been determined to place a second 
moval)le plane mirror close to the coelostat to reflect the beam to the concave mirror, 
retaining the latter fixed. This mirror is so mounted that it can be wheeled north 
or south along a track situated as close to the coelostat as possible. This track is 
designed to curve round the south end of the coelostat so that the second mirror can 
be either east or west of the coelostat as desired, and it is intended to use it east in 
the morning and west in the afternoon. A concave mirror of 18 inches aperture and 
140 feet focus which you have ordered will be placed about 60 feet north of the 
coelostat. Its beam on the way to its focus will pass directly under the coelostat 
mirror and between the morning and afternoon positions of the second plane mirror. 
The coelostat mirror is thus about 2 feet higher than the concave mirror and about 
1 foot higher than the second mirror, so that the latter casts no shadow on the 
coelostat mirror except for very low sun at the times of the equinoxes. On account 
of the unfavoral:)le inclinatioji of the coelostat mirrors at certain times of the year 
and day, it is determined also to provide for the use of the two plane mirrors as a 
polar sidero.stat, since only slight changes are required to alter a polar siderostat into 
a coelostat, and the reverse. If used as a polar siderostat, the gain in effective mirror 
surface will be offset by having a rotating image. 

In either case, as thus arranged, it is possible to c(jmpletely inclose the beam of 
light in suitable tubes after it reaches the coelostat, and even before, by a tube moved 
to follow the sun. The only use of such tubes is to jirevent the "boiling" or appar- 
ent motion around the edges of the image due to air waves in the path of the beam,

and several (juite ileciKJve experiiiientH wi're made ))y Vdiir direi-tion to determine 
their effectiveness. 

Expcrimenis on "boiling^^ r>f llic image. — 1 add a few words, partly in anticipation, 
in reference to your newly-introduced device for preventing the well-known effect 
of "boiling" the telescopic image, a ditficnlty due to the earth's atmosphere and 
which has existed always and everywhere, and which has seemed until lately so 
insurmountable that it has not even been thought of as subject to correction. Tlie 
device that you have suggested consists essentially not in keeping the air still within 
and without the telescope tube, \mi in violently agitating it over as great a range as 
possible. For this inirpose, under your iiistructions and with the object of rehears- 
ing on a small scale what, if the device is successful, will be later tried on a large one, 
a silvered glass mirror of 5 inches diameter and 40 feet focus has been set uj) in a tube 
with several concentric walls, so as to leave the interior air as still as possible. In 
jireliminary experiments the air, in spite of these precautions in the installation, gave 
such "l)oiling" of the image as to seriously i)rejudice the delinition, and this, 
although the 40-foot tube had no less than three walls, being 7 inches in interior 
diameter and 15 inches in exterior diameter, and inclosing the beam all thcAvay from 
a second plane mirror near the coelostat to the concave mirror and thence to the focus. 
Though this tube containing the stillest air of the most uniform temperature was 
sheltered throughout l)y a canvas tent, the "boiling" was but a little diminished. 
Nothing was gained by diminishing the a])erture of the several mirrors down to 1 
inch in diametei', and all this was only what had l)een anticipated from the ordinary 
experience of astronomers. A 12-inch blower run ])y an electric motor was now 
caused to exhaust air from tlic inner tube at a half dozen [loints along the tube, and 
to force air in at other points alternate with these, so as thus violently to disturb or 
"churn" the air by forcing a vigorous circulation of it along the whole path of the 
beam from the ccelostat to the solar image. 1;^\m unquestionably reduced the "boil- 
ing." An artificial star was now provided at the focal plane, the plane mirror near 
the C(X'lostat was placed at right angles to the tube, and thus the concave mirror, act- 
ing as both collimator and oljjective, broug])t the star image to focus at the star itself. 
Here it was exanuned with an eyepiece. With still air the definition was often very 
poor. The image assumed very variable shapes, with wings or streamers; and being 
also colored by diffraction effects, reminded one of a kaleidoscope field. On starting 
the blower the definition immediately became sharp. Violently stirring the air in 
the tube, therefore, eliminates the "boiling" within the tube and (i)aradoxically) 
produces a still image. As before said, the solar image was clearly imjiroved liy the 
stirring; but further improvement was still to be desired. Accordingly a tin tul)c 44 
feet long, with two walls of 11 inches interior diameter and Ifi inches exterior 
diameter, was provided and arranged to point toward the sun, as sliown in Plate VI, 
so that the beam passed down through it before reaching the mirror system. This 
tube was connected to the blower exactly like the horizontal one, and l)oth could 
bestirred at once. There was very marked "Iwiling" before starting the blower. 
This nearly disappeared while the blower was running. One observer estimated 
the "boiling" as four-fifths overcome; another thought little more than a quarter 
remained, and all were unanimous that what was left was very little prejudicial to 
the definition. This last result is so surprising that I feel constrained to add that 
the experiments so far are not exhaustive, having been carried on but a short time, 
and without that solidity of piers which would allow of exact estimate or photo- 
graphic determination of the " l)oiling" of the solar image before and during agita- 
tion of the air in the tube, as distinguished from mechanical jarring. Further experi- 
ments are in progress. That agitation is of very great advantage to diminish "boil 
ing" there is no question, but the exact measure of the advantage for all circum- 
stances of bad seeing requires further study. Incidentally, the air blast has the added . 
advantage of keeping the mirrors at uniform temjxirature. This and the abolish- 



96 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

mentof "boiling" in the tul.)e are found to prevent those vexatious changes of focus 
so common in solar work. 

These experiments, which 1 am free to say seemed to me when first proposed by 
you of a kind to increase rather than diminish "boiling," have in fact proved 
thus far almost wholly successful in eliminating it. The experiment with an ordi- 
nary equatorial has not yet been tried, but for a horizontal telescope, such as is here 
proposed, the scheme is demonstrable and feasible. 

Radiation of the (Juhan fireflij. — In continuance of your observations on the 
cheapest forn^ of light, two specimens of Pi/ropJiorns noctilvxus were loaned to 
the Observatory by kindness of Professor Howard, of the Agricultural Depart- 
ment. The radiation of the thoracic-light regions of these insects was l)riefly 
studied by the aid of the bolometer and photometer. The insect was placed 
in the center of curvature of a concave mirror of 50 centimeters aperture and 1 
meter focus. In the conjugate focus was the most sensitive bolometric arrange- 
ment in the possession of the Observatory, connected to the galvanometer used for 
holographic work. A glass plate was placed before the bolometer to cut off body 
radiation. Nothing whatever could be observed to indicate any heating effect from 
the light of the insect. A portion of the flame of a standard sperm candle equal in 
area to the light spot of the insect gave such a deflection that had the radiation from 
the insect been g-Q^xr o ^^ great in amount it could not have escaped observation. On 
comparing the light from the candle and that from the insect by the aid of a pho- 
tometer it was found that area for area the insect's light-giving capacity was one- 
eighth as great as that of the candle. Its actual candlepower was igVo- ^^^ 
counting the very considerable candle radiation not transmissible by glass, it there- 
fore appeared that the firefly gave his light at less than xoffijo the expenditure of 
energy required for an equal light from the standard sperm candle. You will be 
gratified that while these observations^evidently confirm your earlier experiments 
they show the great advance since then in the sensitiveness of the bolometer. 

PERSONNEL. 

The observing staff has l)een unchanged with the following exceptions: Dr. C. E. 
Mendenhall was employed as temporary assistant up to August 3, 1901, and Dr. 
N. E. Gilbert as temporary assistant, beginning June 16, 1902. 

SUMMARY. 

During the past year satisfactory progress lias l)een made in the improvement of 
the galvanometer. Successful exjieriments have l)een made under the system first 
proposed l)y you bj' which personal equation in transit observations is avoided, and 
still others, which seem to be of great practical importance, by which the "boiling" 
of the telescopic image either of sun or star shows promise of being largely overcome. 
A comparison of the light and heat of the standard sperm candle with that of the 
firefly showed the latter to be more than 10,000 times more economical as a source 
of light. 

The great purpose of the observatory — the investigation of the sun and of its influ- 
ence on the earth — has been at all times continued.

The accession numbers run from 438,893 to 445,523. 

The greater part of these publications have been .sent to the Library of Congress, 
amounting during the past year to something over 188 boxes, 25 bags and packages, 
which are estimated to have contained the equivalent of 8,520 octavo volumes, this 
being a sending independent of that of the International Exchanges. 

The decrease in the numl)er of entries in the accession book and the periodical 
record as compared with last year will l)e accounted for by the large number of 
strictly Government documents which the Smithsonian Institution now sends direct 
to the Library of Congress thr(jugh the Bureau of International Exchanges. This 
arrangement has ])een carried on in accordance with the imderstanding had between 
the Secretary and the LiVjrarian of Congress. 

The additions to the libraries of the Secretary, the Ottice, and the Astrophysical 
Observatory number 496 volumes, pamphlets, and charts and 2,587 parts of volumes, 
making a total of 3,083 and a grand total of 29,741. On the card catalogue of serial 
publications about 22,234 entries were made. 

The universities at the following places have sent inaugural dissertations and 
academic publications: 



Baltimore (Johns Hopkins). Halle a Saal.

98 REPOKT OF THE SECRETARY. 

The policy of increasing the library by exchange has been continued with favor- 
able results. In carrying this out, 877 letters were written for new exchanges and 
for completing series already in the library; 317 periodicals were added to the list; 
451 defective series were either completed or partly filled, according to the pub- 
lisher's ability to supply the numbers requested. About 1,800 letters were received 
and filed in jackets on which a synopsis of each letter is given. 

The card catalogue of correspondence for reference has been continued, as well as 
the issuing of orders for Smithsonian puljlications sent in exchange. When single 
numbers are reported as missing, postal cards are forwarded requesting that they be 
supplied. Corresponding postal cards are sent as acknowledgments of receipts. 
About 1,090 numbers were asked for, and 703 supplied. 

The reference room and the reading room, the proceedings and transactions of 
learned societies being in the former and the scientific periodicals in the latter, have 
been used not only by the staff of the Smithsonian Institution, l)ut by many other 
departments of the Government. In the reading room alone 3,208 periodicals and 
25 bound volumes were withdrawn for consultation. 

The sectional library at the National Zoological Park has been added to, and the 
collection is growing in importance. 

In the Institution there are maintained, besides the Secretary's library, the office 
library, the employees' library, three sectional libraries— Aerodromics, International 
•Exchanges, and Law Reference. 

In the Astrophysical Observatory attention has been given to the sets of period- 
icals. These were gone over, missing parts ordered, and 46 volumes bound. 

The employees' library has increased in popularity, and during August last a 
branch extension was made to the Zoological Park. The books are i:)laced in an 
upright box made for the purpose, with a ca2;)acity of 40 volumes, and sent out once 
a month. The library now contains 1,370 volumes, and during the year 2,379 l)ooks 
were borrowed. 

The librarian having, with the permission of the Secretary, relinquished his posi- 
tion as custodian of the Smithsonian deposit at the Library of Congress, to render 
possible his attention to certain duties outside of the Institution, Mr. Paul Brockett 
was on April 1, 1902, appointed assistant librarian of the Smithsonian Institution 
and custodian of the Smithsonian deposit. 

Mr. Brockett will attend to matters relating to the Smithsonian Institution 
library and the Institution's interests at the Library of Congress. During the few 
months he has been in the library he has made himself familiar with the various 
details of the office and the Smithsonian deposit. 

Early in November, 1901, Gen. John Watts dePeyster presented to the Institution his 
magnificent collection of books and pamphlets relating to Napoleon Bonaparte, to be 
known as the "Watts de Peyster Collection, Napoleon Bonaparte." It is a very 
complete one, containing books from all countries and in all languages. In it I have 
noticed many rare volumes, and the valuation of $10,000, i)ut upon it by General de 
Peyster, I think very low, for a number of the books were long ago out of print and 
have now reached the point where no price can be jiut upon them. There have 
been received from General de Peyster nearly 2,000 volumes, whi<'h are now in tem- 
porary cases, but the number of l)ooks has outgrown the space provided. A running 
list has been made and sent to General de Peyster for his information, and at a 
very early date suggestions for the permanent care and the making of a card cata- 
logue of this collection will be presented for your consideration. 

The art room has received considerable attention, and, in accordance with the Sec- 
retary's wish, the collection of i)hotographs of representative portraits by the old 
masters has been returned from the Buffalo Exposition and hung njion the walls in 
chronological order. The question of extending the Parthenon frieze around the 
entire room has been taken nj) and it is IiojhmI that it will l)e in j)lace during the 
summer. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 



99 



With the allotment from the Smithsonian Institntion funds for the maintenance 
of the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature, a regional bureau has been 
established and the work carried o'li. The temporary provision for the coming year 
will warrant only the employment of the same force, which is entirely inadequate 
to properly care for the numerous duties irajjosed. A sum of at least $10,000 per 
annum is needed for the United States Regional Bureau, and it is hoped that Congress 
will, now that the publication is actually begun, appropriate the necessary funds for 
the representation of the United States in an undertaking which will render aid to 
all branches of scientific learning throughout the country. 

The work done for the year ending June 30, 1902, is in l)rief as follows: (1) The 
general organization of a regional bureau, including means of collecting and dispos- 
ing of all scientific matter pul)Iished in the United States; (2) making a list of the 
periodicals of the United States coming within the scope of the catalogue; (3) pre- 
paring and classifying index reference slips to the scientific i)uI)lications of 1901 and 
forwarding these slijis to the London Central Bureau. The slips forwarded up to 
June 30, 1901, number 0,990. The first two volumes of the International Catalogue 
of Scientific Literature for 1901 have appeared. They are: Botany, Part I, of 1901, 
and Chemistry, Part I, of 1901, and were published in May and June of the present 
year. 

The crowded condition of the National ^Museum Library has been relieved by the 
addition of galleries in two of the halls of the Museum building. These contain a 
total floor space of 2,592 square feet. During the coming year the entire series of 
scientific publications will-be rearranged, thus increasing the usefulness of the library. 

The files of periodicals have been gone over and the missing numbers olitained. 
Owing to the small force, this has been done at odd times when the regular work 
would allow, and has resulted in the completing of 31 of the 106 sets examined. 

The accessions number a total of 19,553 books, pamphlets, and periodicals, of 
which 3,660 were a portion of the Smithsonian deposit; 23,149 books were borrowed. 
The number of periodicals entered was 9,297, and 2,189 cards were added to the 
Authors' Catalogue of the Museum Library. Tliis last does not include, however, 
1,605 cards for books and pamphlets recatalogued. 

The sectional liliraries estal)lished in tiie Museum are as follows:

Appendix VIII. 

REPORT OF THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTI- 
TUTION AND NATIONAL MUSEUM, PAN-AMERICAN EXPOSITION, 
BUFFALO, NEW YORK, 1901. 

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the Pan-American Exposi- 
tion, held at Buffalo, N. Y., from May 1, 1901, to November 2, 1901, incliisive: 

Participation in this exposition by the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum 
was provided for in the act of Congress, approved March 3, 1899, appropriating the sum 
of $200,000 for a Government building and the sum of $300,000 for a Government 
exhibit. Of the latter sum $50,000 was allotted to the Institution and INIuseum, and 
$2,500 was transferred from the allotment of the Interior Department for the joint 
preparation of a restoration of the gigantic extinct American reptile known as Tri- 
ceratops. Subsequently the Smithsonian allotment was assessed $1,960.79 for a gen- 
eral exhibit from the Philippine Islands to be prepared under the supervision of a 
special committee of Government board, and $200 was transferred to the allotment 
of the War Department. The net Smithsonian allotment was, therefore, $50,339.21. 

All the dependencies of the Institution were represented by separate displays 
except the Bureau of American Ethnologj', which cooperated with the Department 
of Anthropology in the National Museum. 

The space in the Government ])uilding assigned to tlie Institution and INIuseum was 
at the northwest corner and comprised about 7,500 square feet, having a frontage on 
the main aisle of about 133 feet and a deptli of 56 feet. 

The act of Congress providing for the Government exhibit stipulated that it should 
comprise "such articles and material as illustrate the function and administrative 
faculty of the Government in time of peace and * * * tending to demonstrate 
the nature of our institutions and their adaptation to the wants of the people." 
Following out the spirit of the law, the exliibits of the Institution and INIuseum were 
planned to show their scope and methods of work, and at the same time to indicate 
tlu'ir resources. 

In the case of the National Museum such topics were chosen for illustration as 
were germane to the central idea of the exposition, namely, a display of the prod- 
ucts of nature and the works of man in the Western Hemisphere. The Museum on 
this occasion, as previously, prepared much larger exhibits than the other bureaus 
of the Institution, on accoui^t of its peculiar functions and resources which fit it to 
participate extensively in enterprises of this kind. The disjjlays of the other bureaus 
were necessarily limited, for the most part, to such pictures, models, and publications 
as would serve to indicate the material with which and the conditions under which 
their work is carried on, and some of the results of their activities. 

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION PROPER. 

The work of the Smithsonian Institution covers fields more varied than is gener- 
ally supposed. It may be a surprise to many to know that by the Congressional act 
of its foundation it is devoted primarily to art and only secondarily to science. One 
of its interests, which has not hitherto been presented in a temporary exposition, is 
the fostering of art. To impress on the minds of the i)ublic the fact that this is a 
110 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Ill 

feature of the work of the Institution, two series of reproductions of paintings were 
exhibited, one representing the history of painting and the second tiie history of 
portraiture. These two important topics could be illustrated only in outline on 
account of limited space, Init the series included reproductions of a considerable 
number of the greatest paintings and portraits of all epochs and schools. 

In addition, the exhibit of the Institution included a comi)lete set of its publica- 
tions and those of its bureaus; portraits of the secretaries; personal relics of James 
Smithson; a cast of the bronze tablet recently i:)laced on the tomb of Smithson at 
Genoa, Italy; a copy of the seal of the Institution; objects and papers relating to 
the Hodgkins fund, including publications, medals, and a portrait of the founder, 
Thomas G. Hodgkins; two large photographs of the aerodrome of Secretary Lang- 
ley; a picture of the Smithsonian building; and co])ies of the history of the first 
half century of the Smithsonian Institution. 

The exhibit of the Institution was installed in the extreme northwest corner of 
the building. It was asseml)led, under the direction of the Secretary, by Dr. Kichard 
Rathbun, Assistant Secretary. 

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETIIXOLOGY. 

As already stated, this Bureau made no separate exhibit at Buffalo, l)ut coi)perated 
with the department of anthropology of the National Museum. Dr. W J McGee, 
of the Bureau of American P]thnology, made an expedition to Sonora, Mexico, for the 
purpose of ol>taining a collection representing the arts of the Seri Indians. On 
reaching their country, however, he found that the tribe was exterminated, and he 
then turned his attention to the Cocopa Indians, from whom he obtained an impor- 
tant collection. 

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK. 

The chief exhibit of the park was an elaborate relief model showing the topo- 
graphical features of the grounds and the location of the animal houses, paddocks, 
ranges, and cages. This was sui^pleniented by photographs of some of the principal 
houses and of picturesque points in the ])ark. 

HUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL EXCIIAN(iES. 

It will be appreciated that the work of the Bureau of Exchanges does not lend itself 
to exhibition by material objects. The exhiljit at Buffalo consisted of a set of Govern- 
ment publications such as are distributed annually to other governments throughout 
the world, and a series of photograjjhs showing the interior of the offices of the Bureau 
in Washington and the recei])t and dispatch of consignments of scientific publications. 

ASTKOPII YSICA L OBSERVATORY. 

The exhibit of this Bureau was selected and prejjared, under the direction of the 
Secretary of the Institution. 

The princij)al object in the exhibit was a photograph of the infra-red end of the 
solar spectrum, showing the work of the Observatory on this subject for a period of 
years. The photograph was enlarged so as to have a length of about 20 feet, and 
was displayed on the north wall. There was also exhibited a series of i)hotograplis 
of the solar eclipse, as observed at Waynesboro, N. C. 

In a table case near by was shown a copy of Volume I of the Annah of the Astro- 
physical Observatory, a new serial publication containing the results of the work of 
the Observatory. The following objects were also exhibited: The bolometer, or 
electric thermometer, an extremely sensitive instrument, the invention ot Mr. 
Langley, used in measuring the heat of the invisible spectrum of the sun, the tem- 
perature of the stars, etc. ; photographs of other instruments used in the Observatory, 
Buch as the siderostat, galvanometer, and spectrometer; photographs ot the exterior 
and interior of the Observatory buildings in the Smithsonian grounds. 



112 REPOKT OF THE SECEETAEY. 

NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

The exhibit of the National Museum, as on previous occasions, occupied very 
much more space than those of the other bureaus of the Institution. 

It was planned to show the scope and methods of the Museum and at the same 
time to illustrate as far as practicable some topic germane to the general idea of the 
exposition implied in the name Pan-American. The three administrative depart- 
ments made separate exhibits, but the lines of separation between the various sub- 
divisions in these departments were not recognized in every instance. 

Department of Anthropology. — The exhibit of this department of the Museum was 
planned and prepared by Mr. W. H. Holmes, head curator, assisted by the scientific 
staff. It occupied the south end of the Museum space. 

This exhibit was planned with the view of representing the various aboriginal 
peoples of America and the material products of their activities. 

Groups of lay fgnrex. — Twelve of these groups were exhibited, each representing a 
family (man, woman, and children), and each with an appropriate setting, indicating 
customs, arts, and general environment. Many of the figures were prepared espe- 
cially for this exposition by skilled sculptors and preparators, under the personal 
direction of the head curator, and were the best objects of the kind the Museum has 
ever exhibited. The two largest groups— those of the Greenland Eskimo and Pata- 
gonians— occupied cases 12 feet long and 8 feet wide. The other 10 groups were 
somewhat smaller. A comjilete list is as follows: (1) North Greenland Eskimo; (2) 
Eastern Eskimo; (3) Alaskan Eskimo; (4) Ghilcat Indians, Alaska; (5) Hupa Indians, 
California; (6) Sioux Indians of the Great Plains; (7) Navajo Indians of the arid 
region of the United States; (8) Zuni Indians of the arid region; (9) Cocopa 
Indians, Sonora, Mexico; (10) Maya Quiche Indians, Guatemala; (11) a Zapotec 
Indian woman, Mexico, a Jivaro Indian man and a Piro Indian man, Brazil; (12) 
Tehuelche Indians, Patagonia. Nos. 2, 8, and 11 were not completed as family 
groups. 

DweUing gronp models. — This series consisted of thirteen models, each about 4 feet 
long and 2 feet wide, representing the houses and outbuildings and appurtenances 
occupied by a family or communal group. The following is a list of those models : 

(1) Snow houses of the Eskimo: ^2) earth house of Alaskan Eskimo; (3) Avooden 
dwellings of the northwest coast Indians; (4) skin and bark covered lodges of tlie 
Montagnais Indians, Labrador; (5) dwellings of the Sierra Digger Indians, California; 
(6) skin lodges of the ({reat Plains Indians; (7) grass liouses of the Wichita Indians 
of Indian Territory; (8) earth lodges of the Pawnee Indians, Dakota; (9) cliff dwell- 
ings (ruins), Arizona; (10) grass and adobe houses of Papago Indians, old style, 
Arizona; (11) grass and adobe houses of Papago Indians, late forms; (12) pile dwell- 
ings of the Venezuela tribes; (13) skin shelters of the Patagonians. 

E.rhibits ilhistrating leading activities of American aborigines. — These exhibits, thir- 
teen in number, were designed to show the status of various American native races 
as regards culture. The series presented were as follows : ( 1 ) Fire-making apparatus; 

(2) bows and arrows; (3) throwing sticks; (4)*liarpo(ms; (fi) water craft; (0) bas- 
ketry; (7) woven fal)rics; (8) pottery; (9) sculjiture; (10) personal-ornament neck- 
laces; (11) tobacco pipes; (12) pictography and writing; (13) musical instruments. 

These series were shown in standard IMuseum cases, 85 feet long and 7 feet high, 
and comprised many hundred objects of importance and general interest. 

Department of Biology. — The exhibit of this department of the Museum was planned 
and prepared by Dr. F. W. True, head curator, with the assistance of the staff of 
the divisions of mammals, birds, reptiles, and fishes. 

The exhibit of the department was projected in harmony with the general theme 
of the exposition and only American animals were exhibited. As space was limited 
only vertebrate animals were included. In order to fill gaps in the series as far as 



REPORT OF THP: SECRETARY. 118 

possible and to make tl^ie collection more significant, small collecting exix'ilitions 
were sent out to Cuba, Porto.Rico, Florida, and the Amazon River. These obtained 
many fine characteristic specimens , Dot previousl}' well represented in the Museum 
collections. The exhibit as t Avhole represented very satisfactorily the most impor- 
tant, interesting, and attractive American vertebrates, both large and small. 

Mamntal.t.- — The collection of mammals included such large forms as the moose, 
elk, musk ox, Caribl)ean seal, Kodiak l)ear, wolf, puma, manatee, mduntain sheej), 
mountain goat, etc. A considera])le number of specimens were mounted especially 
for the exposition, and represented the best efforts of modern taxidermy. Several 
imi)ortant species recently discovered, such as the (llacier bear, Kodiak Ix'ur, Stone's 
sheej), etc., were included in the exhi))it. 

Bird.f. — The collection of birds was the largest series disi)layed by the department. 
Such large characteristic l)irds as the condor, wild turkey, whooi)ing crane, Cali- 
fornia vulture, etc., were represented by exceedingly fine specimens, mounted in the 
very best maimer. The smaller birds included numerous species remarkal)le for 
their l)rilliant colors, peculiar habits, or grotesque form, an<l as a whole tlu' series 
was calculated to give the visitor an excellent idea of the variety and beauty of the 
American bird fauna as a whole. An extensive collection of humming liinls, an 
exclusively American family, was shown in a special case. 

Ilt'ptUcs <tnd hatnichUnu. — The collection of these two classes was nmch smaller 
than the others, as the Museum had no considerable exhiljition series ready at hand 
to draw upon, and to olitain suital)le material within a sjtecified time is a matter of 
the greatest difficulty. Th('num))er of suitable sj)ecimens finally obtained, however, 
proved greater than could ])e accommodated in the small space which it seemed 
prudent at the outset of the enteriirise to allot to these two classes, which sjiaci' was 
at the last moment still further reduced to provide tlie necessary aisle roo.m. Some 
such remarkable forms as the mata-mata tortoise and the large Amazon Ki\-er tor- 
toise, though ready for exhiliition, were finally crowded out. 

Tlie exhibit included the more important American poisonous and nonpoisonous 
snakes, various fresh-water and land tortoises, cliaracteristic lizards, including the 
large Cuban iguana, and a few toads, frogs, salamanders, and other amphibians. 
Among the largest specimens was a tortoise known as the alligator snapper, wliicli is 
the largest of American fresh-water tortoises, and a boa constrictor. 

Fishes. — The collection of American fishes was in three divisions: (1) A general 
series of painted casts of characteristic marine and fresh- water sjiecies; ( 2 ) a series of 
subtro])ical marine fishes from Key West, Fla., jireserved in formalin; and ( 'A ) a series 
of the fishes of the Amazon River, also preserved in formalin. Tlie collection 
included the best casts in the Museum permanent series. It is impiactica])l(' to 
mentirm the species in detail in this place, lint the series as a whole was esi^ecially 
strong in important food and game fishes of the lakes and rivers of North America, 
and (jf the Atlantic coast, and characteristic South American species. 

A special exhibit in this class consisted of an enlarged model of a remarkable phos- 
j)horescent deep-sea fish, so installed that the luminous sjuits in the sides and the 
lantern-like protuberance on the head were made to glow as in life. 

The mammals exhibited by the Department of Biology were installed in two large 
wall cases, each 40 feet long, in the center of the Museum space, the fishes in a 
similar but shallow case at the west end, the birds in eight standard Museum "door- 
screen" cases, and the reptiles and batrachians in four standard "slope-top" cases. 

A large proportion of the specimens in each of the five classes were provided with 
descriptive labels in nontechnical language, in which the habits and geographical 
range of each species were cited, together with other items of general interest. 

Department of Geology. — The exhibit of this department was planned ami arrangeil 
by Dr. George P. Merrill, heail curator, with the assistance of the scientilic staff. It 
occupied the north end of the IMusenm space.

114 REPORT OF THE 8ECRETARY. 

The exhibit followed, an far as circumstances would permit, the lines of the 
permanent exhibition series of the Museum. Each division of the department was 
represented, and in addition there was included a full-sized restoration of the skeleton 
of the huge extinct American reptile Trkeratopg, prepared and exhibited conjointly 
by the Museum and the United States Geological Survey. 

Division of Geology. — The display made by this division comprised three seeris, (1) 
a collection of rocks from the Hawaiian Islands, (2) a series of native elements, (3) 
a series of concretionary forms. The collection of Hawaiian rocks, which occupied 
one case, consisted mainly of specimens obtained by the United States Exploring 
Expedition in 1840, by Mr. A. B. Lyon in 1892, and Prof. C. H. Hitchcock in 1899. 
The rocks of these islands are all of igneous character, except the limestones of the 
coral reefs along the shores. 

The series of native elements comprised those sixteen, such as sulphur, arsenic, 
gold, etc., which occur in an uncombined state in the earth's crust. The full series 
was as follows: Carbon, sulphur, selenium, telurium, arsenic, antimony, bismuth, 
gold, silver, copper, lead, mercury, platinum, iridosmine (iridium and osmium), and 
iron. This collection was installed in a special case, and particular care was taken 
with the details of mounting to emphasize its significance. Among the most inter- 
esting objects included were a very perfect crystal of diamond from South Africa 
(representing carbon) and a nugget of platinum from Russia weighing 4-14 grams. 

The series of concretionary forms included specimens of orbicular granites from 
Rhode Island, Sweden, and Finland, and of septarian concretions of clay ironstone 
from New York, Kansas, and Weymouth, England, and other locahties. These 
occupied a wall case. 

Division of Mineralogy. —The exhibit of this division consisted of an extensive series 
of ininerals, very carefully classified', arranged, and labeled to illustrate the methods 
employed by the Museum when exhibiting large, systematic collections. Tlie series 
comprised about 500 specimens and was accompanied by 47 group labels in addition 
to individual labels for each specimen. It occupied four standard Museum "slope- 
top" floor cases. 

Division of Strailgrapliic Paleontology— Section of Invertebrate Fossils. — This section 
exhibited two series of invertebrate fossils, crinoids and cephalopods. 

The crinoids, or stone lilies, were represented by specimens of 94 genera, and the 
cephalopods (cuttlefish, squids, etc.) by specimens of 146 genera. They were 
accompanied by descriptive labels, the technical terms in which were explained by 
a special series of specimens artificially colored to draw attention to the particular 
parts referred to. The collection was installed in five standard Museum "door 
screen" cases. 

Section ofVerlebrale Fonstls.— On account of the limited space, but few vertebrate fos- 
sils could be exhibited. The exhibit consisted of a full-size restoration of the skel- 
eton of the Tertiary American reptile, Triceraiop.v, mention of which has already been 
made; a skeleton of a cretat'cous fossil toothed bird, Hesperornis; a restoration of the 
skeleton of Zeiiglodon, an extinct whale-like mammal from the Eocene, and bones 
and skulls of the mastodon, mannnoth, and titanotherium. 

In the case of Triceratops, a small model and painting showing the ])robabIe 
external appearance of the animal were exhibited with the restoration of the skel- 
eton, and a large oil painting representing the creature in its native fields was dis- 
played on an adjacent wall. 

Dr. V.W . True, nprcsentative for the Institution and Museum on the (iovernment 
board, was also chairman of the siM'cial committie on exhibits from the Outlying 
Possessions of the I'nitc d States. Mr. W. V. Cox, chief special agent, was also sec- 
retarv of the < ioveiiiment board.

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1902.

ADVERTISEMENT. 



The ol)ject of the (texeual Appendix to the Annual Report of the 
Smithsonian Institution is to fui'uish ])rief accounts of scicntitic discov- 
ery in particular directions; reports of investio-ations made by collab- 
orators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character or on 
special topics that are of interest or value to thc^ numerous corrt^spond- 
ents of the Institution. 

It has been a prominent ol)jectof the Board of Regents of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual report 
required of them by law with memoirs illustrating- the more remarka- 
ble and important developments in physical and biological discovery, 
as well as showing the general character of the operations of the Insti- 
tution; and this purpose has, during the greater part of its history, 
been carried out largely l)y tlie publication of such papers as would 
possess an interest to all attracted by scientific ])rogress. 

In 18S0 the Secretary, induced in part l)y the discontinuance of an 
annual summary of progress which for thirty years previous had been 
issued by well-known private })ublishing tirms, had prepared l)y com- 
petent collaborators a series of a})stracts, showing concisely the prom- 
inent features of recent scicntitic progress in astronomy, geology, 
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, und 
anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether 
satisfactorily, down to and including the year iSSS. 

In the rc^port for l<S8i> a return was made to th(» earlier method of 
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original) 
embracing a considei'a])le range of scientific investigation and discus- 
sion. This method has been continued in the present report for 1902.

RECENT AERONAUTICAL PKO(}RESS. AND DEDUCTIONS 
TO BE DRAWN THEREFROM, RE(J ARDlNd THE FUTURE 
OF AERLVL NAVKIATION. " 



r>v Mil]. 1). F. S. P)Ai)EN-lVnvKix. 



It Is with fcolinys of tlio ^'reiitcst stitisfaction that I aiii now al)lo 
for the tirst time to address tlio society in the cai)aeitv of its [)resi- 
dent, and I must sei/e this opportunity of expressinu- to you my 
heartfelt thanks foi- th(^ very y-reat honor whieli you have conferred 
upon mc hy (dectiiiL^ me to this position. I can not but feel that my 
laljors in the past, thoui;-h \'ari(Ml and dip})ing into almost every branch 
of aeronautics, have not l)een so extensive or so prominent as to war- 
rant my selection for this important post, l)ut n(>vertlieless 1 .sincerely 
hope that, with freer opportunities. I may, in the inmiediate future, 
be able to accomplish nuich moi'e in the work we ha\'e before us. 

My absence from Enoland during- the last three years, on active 
service in South Africa, has ])revente(l my fulfilling many iniportant 
duties for tlu^ society during a |)eriod of unusual activity and impor- 
tance, but, on the other hand, the time I have spent on the "'trackless 
veldt," and in the monotony of camp life, has not, 1 hoj)e, l)een 
wasted, as ample opportunity has been atforded for careful meditation 
and consideration of the whole subject which it is the object of this 
society to study. I therefore propose not so imich to gi\'e a technical 
lecture on the various experiments of ](>cent y(>ars — you have had 
better opportunities than I of studying these — as to endea\()i' to make 
clear our present position. 

During these three years many great events have taken ])lac(^ in the 
aeronautical world. Count Zepi)elin's monster air ship, built on sound 
sci(Mititic principles, of enormous size and ([uite ditl'er(M>t in design to 
anything made before, has been completed, and has made successful 
ascents, although, J nuich ri^gret to have to add, has not succeeded 
in traveling through the air at a sufBcient speed to warrant its l)eing 
considered a practical success.

122 RECENT AERONAUTICAL PROGRESS. 

Then we come to M. 81111108-01111)011^8 maii}^ more or less successful 
trips in his navigable balloons, which, if not demonstrating any new 
principles, has shown what perseverance and attention to detail can 
ichieve. Though we have learned some useful practical lessons, and 
have been given data of great value for future experimenting, unfor- 
tunately the actual results attained cany us so little beyond what was 
accomplished twenty years before by MM. Renard and Krebs that 
one begins to think whether we have not nearly reached the end of the 
tether as regards the propulsion of lialloons. 

The unfortunate calamities to M. Severo's and more recently to M. 
de Bradsky's balloons, as well as the absolute failure of M. Roze and 
others, only tend to confirm this growing opinion. The latest 
accounts of M. Lebaudy's balloon seem to make out that it has accom- 
plished more, but we must await the results of more prolonged trials 
before we can come to an}" decision. Mr. Stanley Spencer's trip over 
London in a navigable balloon, though it proved nothing as regards 
the dirigibility or inherent speed of the machine, attracted some 
interest in the matter. 

Besides these we have heard of various experiments with flying 
machines proper. Herr Kress is said to have risen off the surface of 
the water, but owing to some mismanagement the machine turned 
downwards and fell in the water again. In Australia Mr. Hargrave 
has constructed a large machine. In America Mr. Wilbur Wright 
and his brother have been making wonderful progress with gliding 
machines, and Professor Langley has been hard at work constructing 
a large new machine. He informed me the other day that in a very 
short time we might expect to hear something of this — something ))ig. 
It might, he added, be a big smash! But he wisely intends trying it 
over water. 

Then, too, like the invisible universe of dark stars that Sir Robert 
Ball talks about as being possibly more extensive than that of those 
seen, there are probably more inventions being worked at in private 
than we ever hear of publicly, and many of them are doubtless of 
great importance. It is only recently that the results have been pub- 
lished of the valuable experiments with aerial-screw propellers which 
Mr. W. G. Walker conducted for Mr. Alexander. 

Another sign of progress in the subject of aeronautics during the 
last few years has been the establishment in England of two more 
])ul)lic bodies, the Aero Club and the Aeronautical Institute, the for- 
m(>r having ))een esta})lished for the encouragement of ballooning (and 
possibly flying) as a sport, while the latter aims at interesting the 
working classics in the sul)j(M-t. 

I may here sei/.e the opportunity of explaining to our visitors and 
others the objects of our society, and why it is that we make so much 
of a studv which to them niav secMU somewhat chimerical and of no 



RECENT AERONAUTICAL PROGRESS. 128 

veiy special merit, a'lid by explaining- these I hope to enlist their sym- 
patic and support to the movement. For I have before now been 
asked: '" Why should itbe necessar}' to have a society for the study of 
ac^'ial navigation? AMiere is the importance of iti AVhy not institute 
a society for submarine navigation, for wireless telegraphy, or for the 
encouragement of any other novel invention for the improvement of 
means of communication or warfare?" But useful as many such 
inventions may be, none can have the great importance which may 
some day be attached to the machine which navigates the air. 

And there are two reasons why this subject is a large one. The tir^t 
is that the science of aeronautics is one combining many branches and 
spreads into many ramitications. We have aerial machines as they 
exist to-day. The balloon, forming a unique and fascinating mode 
of tra\'el, enables us to mount high into the skies to obtain glorious 
views of earth and cloudscape, giving us a laboratory for the study of 
many intricate problems of the atmosphere, and forming a valuable 
instrument of war. We nuist study how this passive buoy may be 
impro\'ed upon, what new materials may l)e applied to its construction, 
gases, methods for causing it to rise and sink, and means of directing 
it out of the course of the wind. But we also have the more diHicult 
})roblem of how to drive it through the air so as to make it inde- 
pendent of the wind and go in any desired direction. Closely con- 
nected with this is is the subject of kite Hying, whether for man lifting 
or meteorological observation, of parachutes, and of soaring machines. 
All these necessitate a certain knowledge of the various branches of 
meteorology, which is to aeronautics as hydrogaphy is to marine nav- 
igation. Then we have the studv of birds and other tiding animjds as 
a natural se([uel to the science. 

The second reason for the importance of this su))ject is the vast 
future which appears open to it. If such an a])paratus can be con- 
structed as will enat)le man to make pr;u-tical use of the highway of 
the air, there is promise of the sut)ject becoming of even more impor- 
tance than marine navigation or railways. 

We have, then, not merely to consider the ))r()ad principles of the 
general form of the aerial machine of the future — whether it is to take 
the shape of an artiticial bird, a propelled kite, or a dirigible l)ailo()n. 
We have to study the subject of aerod3'namics, the effect of air pres- 
sures on plane or curved surfaces traveling at various speeds and at 
various angles of incidence. We have to investigate the efficiency of 
aerial propellers of ditierent forms, the strengths of materials, the 
energy and weights of various forms of motors. Then we must also 
study the natural currents of air, the variability of air strata, the 
trends of winds, and so on. 

The great range of su))jccts to be gone into by our society is thus 
patent. Many of our members and others are busily at work in some 



124 RECENT AEKONAUTICAL PROGRESS. 

particular oroovo, making- steady progress in hiiilding up their portion 
of the foundation of tliat great structure which we all hope to see rise 
up in the future. 

But to return to the question of the recent progress in aerial navi- 
gation, I will now endeavor to point out and explain the present posi- 
tion we hold, and by considering the state of the subject as it at 
present exists to judge whether or not there is any real prol)al)ility of 
our attaining that great goal which most of us look forward to. 

Though it is impro])able there are many here present to-night who 
do not look forward with feelings of confidence that artificial flight 
will some day be accomplished, yet there are still some few skeptics 
(most, if not all, of whom have never looked deeply into the subject) 
who ])elieve it inipossil)le. For this reason it may not perhaps be out 
of place in such an address as this to point out our reasons for main- 
taining this belief. 

The first great argument in favor of it is that ])irds fly. If we had 
never seen such a thing as a bird, many of us might reasonably argue 
the thing to be impossible. But there they are. Not only can they 
rise in the air, not only prog-ress at a very rapid rate through it, but 
they can continue the movement for long" periods and in almost any 
weather. It is quite certain now that birds do not possess any very 
extraordinary power; ))at if they did we could probably ''go one 
better'' with the modern very compact and light oil engines. We have 
now compressed the strength of a horse into a little motor weighing 
no more than a large bird. There is the ])ower. Can it be ai)i)lie(l^ 
Manv people have argued that the flight of a bird is dependent on 
some valvular action of its feathers. Let it l)e so; but how do you 
account for the flight of the bat and of the flying fox^ Others have 
thought that flight is only possible up to a certain weight, maintaining 
that the ostrich and the emu are beyond that limit. But geologists 
will point you out the fossil remains of a huge reptile which they 
declare flew in the air and weighed fai- more. 

l^ut, leaving nature, we may consider what has been done by man to 
justify our hop(\s. 

Thougli 1 believe it may be said that nearly all the authorities on 
the subject are now of opinion that the balloon can not be considered 
as much more than an aid — to act as a step])ing stone — to true flight, 
3^et there are many workers who consider that \ cry nuu-h may b(^ 
accomplished by propelled balloons. Souk^ authorities hav(^ calculated 
that a speed of 44 miles an hour might ])o practically attain(Kl, but not 
more. 

M. Santos Dumont and others have shown us what can })e done with 
a little cigar-shaped balloon. Th(\v have clearly demonstrated the 
difficulties to l)e overcome. It is very palpable that the sui'face of 
such a balloon nuist l»e still and rigid. Once it gets flal)l)v it can not

unless distended l)v framework, will l)e dri\en in and oiler o-roat 
resistance: the lias will he driven haek toward the after end. and the 
]>alaiice l)e disturlx'd. To j)rescrve this necessary rigidity all the 
earlier iiaviiiabic balloons were kei)t taut by means of the l)alloiiet, 
but Count Zeppelin eliected this ])y an internal framework. 

Count Zc})pelin, as I haxc said, struck out a new line. l>v greatly 
increasin*^" the size of the balloon, he had obtained so much more lift- 
ing- power as to be able to add a complete fi^uuework that stitiened it. 
But it was probably solely owiii*^' to this ureat size that the apjiaratus 
faileci to be practically manageable. It may be compared to the (jreat 
Kdiifcrit steamship, 1)ut with the diti'erence that at the time of its con- 
struction we had l)ut the most elementary experience of air vessels 
propelled by engines. At the same time this enormous ca])acity had 
its advantages. Ibid it been of half the diameter and half th.e length, 
though the resistance to pro})ulsioi! might have been only one-(piarter, 
the \olume and the lifting })()wer would only have been one-eighth. 
So that, instead of carrying engines of 82diorsepower, as was done, it 
might have only lieen possible to carry some of -idioi'sepower. Dr. 
Pole, in his most valual)le little treatises, years ago point(>d out the 
advantages of very large volume. 

One result, then, of recent experiments is that it seems quite practi- 
cable to build a navigable balloon to go, we will say, 15 miles an hour. 
This, however, is not quite enough. As the wind so often blows faster 
than this, it is unsafe to let the balloon out on any l)ut a very calm 
day; else, though only blowing 16 miles an hour, the machine will 
inevitably ))e carried oft' and have to descend in strange fields far from 
its shed, and the ditliculties of transporting it back may be so great 
that it may even have to be taken to ])ieces. Having successfully 
accomplished this much, however, it certainly looks as if we could 
improve a little titid get the balloon to travel 20 or 'Ih miles an hour, 
which would be suliicient to stem the ordinary light lueezes. 

We have learned many practical lessons from these recent experiences. 
It is necessary to make efficient provision against the balloon ca\ing in 
or buckling up. It is, of course, most important that the engine shall 
be so constructed as not by any possible means to lie able to ignite the 
gas in the balloon. I)ut (\specially we have learned that — speaking in 
general terms — for a cigar-shaped vessel some 20 feet in diameter it is 
necessary to apply a power of more than 1(1 horsepower (presuming 
no exceptionally efficient propeller l)e found) for it to be really etli- 
cient. This practically means that you must lune a larger balloon. 

MM. Lebaudy have now adojited a larger balloon, enabling them to 
carry an engine of -to horsepower, or more than double the power of 
that of M. Santos Dumont. C-olonel Renard, also, is ahout to build 
one larger still, of some '.»o,ooo cubic feet. Dr. Barton's proposed air 
ship is also designed to be of great size. 



126 RECENT AERONAUTICAL PROGRESS. 

Passing from the balloon — that is to say, any apparatus which dis- 
places a volume of air weighing as much as or more than its own 
weight (and many thoughtless inventors are apt to neglect this defini- 
tion) — we find several different types of machmes which show promise 
of success. 

Beginning with the simplest, we have the gliding or soaring machine. 
One of the greatest paradoxes in nature is soaring flight. I have said 
how doubtful many people might be about aerial navigation if they 
had never seen a })ird fly, but we can confidently assert that no man 
would believe it possible for a bird to maintain itself for hour after 
hour in mid-air without the slightest movement of its wings were the 
actual demonstration of it not visible every day. I will not now enter 
on a discussion as to how this is accomplished, but will only say that 
there are inventors who hope to be able to emulate the albatross and 
soar away into the heavens without any motive power or propeller. 
It seems so paradoxical that many laugh the idea away. But the hard 
fact remains that birds can do it, and therefore why not men^ I 
received a lettei- only a few days ago from Mr. O. Chanute, than whom 
there is probably no greater authority living on soaring flight. He 
sa3^8 that he had just returned from witnessing this season's gliding 
experiments of the Brothers Wright, and that "they have made a 
very considerable advance since last year, and now glide at angles of 
6° to T'-", sustaining 125 to 160 pounds per net horsepower. Wright 
is now doing nearly as well as the vulture, is not far from soaring 
flight, and I am changing my views as to the adA'isability of apph'ing 
a motor." 

I think this is a n)ost remarkable statement, and there realh" seems 
no reason why such experts, having attained proficiency in the delicate 
art of balancing themselves according to the various puffs and currents 
of air, should not be able to soar away on the wings of the wind and 
remain indefinitely in mid-air. 

The next general type of apparatus tiiat I may refer to is that of 
rising in the aii' by means of a screw proptdier mounted on a vertical 
shaft W^e all have seen little toys ascend in the air working on this 
principle. A large machine of this sort was recently constructed in 
Paris. l)at the exp(M-iments of Mr. W. (t. Walker, of carefully tt^sting 
the thrust and lifting powei- of various screws, have Ix^en among the 
most important conti'ibutions to this science. He has clearly shown 
that it is possil)l(> to practically obtain a thi'ust of 25 })ounds per horsc- 
powiM'. As engines art^ now made weighing no more than 1(> })oiuids 
per horsepower, it is dearly denioiisti'able that a niacliine on this prin- 
ciple coidd be construct(^d to lift itself", carrying some 15 pounds per 
horsepower over and al)o\(^ llu^ w(Mght of the (Migines. Even if not a 
practical form of machine for tra\M'ling thi'ough the air. it would l)e a 
most interesting experiment to try. 



RECENT AERONAUTICAL I'ROGRESS. 127 

Finally we come to that variety of aerial inachiiie which has been 
adopted ])y most inventors and which .seems to promise the most satis- 
factory results. I mean what is known as th(^ aeroplane. Sir Hiram 
Maxim brouyht this prominently forward many years auo. and both 
he and Professor Lano-ley have ])roved theoretically that it is the most 
economical form of apparatus; that is to say, that a uiven weight can 
be supported with less engine ])ower than by other methods. 

Great progress has also been achieved in recent years in this line. 
Lilienthal pointed out the g-reater efficiency of curved surfaces as com- 
pared to Hat ones. Phillips and Hargraves experimented further with 
aerocurves. Considering how nuich more we know about the sul)ject 
now than when Maxim Hi'st l)uilt his machints it looks as though we 
might really hear of gi'eat results shortly from America or Australia. 

Our present position is, then, a hoi)eful one. Hallf)ons have been 
gradually improved until we can practically rely on ])uilding one to go 
15 miles an hour and probal)ly more. Large flying machines, giving 
practical experience of their construction, have been 1)uilt. Ciood- 
sized models have flown well through the air. Gliding machines, bal- 
anced and controlled by human eti'ort, have been maintained in the air 
for considerable periods and have descended at very gradual angles. 
And. what is of the greatest importance, small engines, giving great 
power for their weight, have steadily improved 3'ear by year, leaving 
but little for us to desire in this respect. 

All that we require, then, to attain practical flight, is to make a 
machine only slightly })etter than those already in existence. To 
accomplish this all that is recfuii'ed is a certain amount of skill and a 
good deal of monev- 

There has often been a lot of wild speculation about what might 
happen when flying machines are introduced into everyday life, but it 
may be worth while considering for one moment what is likely to 
result, so as to judge whether the matter is one really demanding an 
effort to accomplish; whether, in fact, '*the game is worth the candle." 

A\ hatever the exact form the apparatus may take, w^e ma}' assume 
that it will possess certain characteristics. The first of these is that it 
will travel very fast. There are several reasons for supposing this. 
Not only nuist it be able to stem ordinary liglit breezes, ])ut to ])C 
really useful it should be capable of going against any ordinary wind, 
and to do this at any useful speed implies a rate of lo or 50 miles an 
hour. Then, high speeds are economical in aerial machines. Lang- 
ley, by his ela])orate experiments, has shown that the faster our aero- 
plane is propelled through the air the less force in pro[)ortion is 
required to sustain it. Again, the air ship, unlike its prototype on the 
water, is not impeded l)y skin friction, so that the power re(piired to 
drive it at high speeds does not increase in the same proportion. A 
bullet can be propelled through the air at inmiense speed, I>ut if it 



128 RECENT AERONAUTICAL PROGRESS. 

enters the water its way is soon stopped. One more reason why we 
may hope for greater speeds than are usual in traveling- on land and 
sea is that in the latter pace must l)e kept within hounds for fear of 
collif^ion, hoth Avith other conveyances and also with irregularities 
(whether in rails, emhankments, and ridges, or rocks and sand ])anks) 
which may exist beside the track. 

In the aerial highway we have greater latitude. We have height as 
well as length and breadth. We can choose our particular altitude 
and stratum to travel in, so that perhaps l.dOU machines could cross 
over the same spot at the same time without colliding. In fact, it 
would decrease the chance of collision by a thousandfold, in addition 
to the lateral route not being so circumscribed. There are no police 
traps up there. 

Taking into consideration the speed at which birds travel, that at 
which models have been flown, and the theoretical calculations which 
have been made, we niay reasonabl}' suppose that 1(»0 miles an hour 
will l)e no excessive speed for a flying machine. 

Those who think this estimate oversanguine may ponder over an 
extract I recently came across from an old newspaper published seventy- 
eight years ago, referring to the railway then about to be constructed 
from London to Woolwich. In this reference is made to the possibil- 
ity of the train being able to attain the terrific speed of IS to 20 miles 
an hour; but it concludes, with sarcastic incredulity. "We should as 
soon expect the people of Woolwich to be tired ott on one of Con- 
greve's rockets as to trust themselves to the mercy of such a machine 
going at such a rate." 

Once a practical flying machine existed, the uses to which it might 
be api)lied are varied and important. 

Primarily, it would form an iucalculal)ly valuable engine of war. 
One can scarcely imagine any invention which could have a greater 
efl'ect on the conduct of warfare. 

^^'c can now a})preciate nuich moit- than we could three years ago 
of what vast importance such a machine would be. It is worth 
dreaming for a moment to realise what might have happened had we 
in iSUi) had some machine capable of ti-aveling rapidly through the 
air. First of all, for mere reconnoitering, how nmch could have been 
done! In Natal, on the outbreak of war, such a vessel, ascending at 
Ladysmith, could have cruised around up to Laing's Nek, noting 
every Boer and e\erv gun within, say, 5 miles of the track passed 
over, taking a tui-n round along the frontier, and have been back to 
report within a few hours. We would then, at "oiu^, fell swoop," 
have had certain, reliable, aiul full information of what was doing, 
instead of going on mere I'umors and the vague observations of a few 
scouts. Another machine at Orange River could have moved forward, 
noted the position of the enemy at Belmont, Alodder liiver, and 



recp:nt aeronautical rKUGRESs. 129 

Mageisfontoin. could have gone into be.sieged Ki]nl)crley and heard 
their news, and could have run l)ack to report to Lord Methuen. 1 
need not repeat the many instances that occur to me of the extreme 
value of such an apparatus for reconnoissanee. We might really sny 
that none of those avvlcward reverses which we suffered in the earl}^ 
part of the war would have occurred liad we known the exact where- 
a])outs of the enemy. Latterly, how easily the evasive commanders 
coukl ha\e been located and followed up. Reconnoissanee by captive 
balloon may be considered dangerous, but an apparatus traveling 150 
feet a second runs an intinitely smaller chance of being hit l)v pro- 
jectiles. If the dropping of explosives on the heads of an enemy is 
not now considered ""fair play'' (though it is difficult to see why this 
should 1)6 less humane than throwing lyddite shells from a howitzer), 
yet there are many more uses to which the aerial tighter might ]>e put. 

He could blow up the railway lines and bridges, even if he had to 
descend to do so. He coidd cut all the telegraph wires in the comitry, 
and could set light to stores and do other damage. A machine soaring 
about over a town or camp occupied by the enemy would certainly 
have a very decided moral etfect on him. Communication could be 
kept up with, and even, perhaps, a few stores introduc(>d into a 
besieged place. 

I need not go further into the possibilities of the future. The more 
we think the matter over the more can we realize the extraordinary 
effect such an innovation would produce in war, 1 do not think any- 
one would deny that, had we been in possession of such apparatus 
during the late war, the operations would have been so greatly facili- 
tated that the campaign would have been ended in a comparatively 
short time, and that we should have })een saved an expenditure of 
many millions of pounds. 

Even in naval warfare, if such speeds as 1 have mentioned were 
possible, the aerial machine should prove of intinitel}' more value than 
a submarine or a torpedo boat. If the invention of the Brennan 
torpedo was considered worth £110,000, how nuich more would ])e the 
value of a dirigible aerial torpedo! 

Another important purpose to which flying machines could be 
applied would be for the exploration of unknown lands. With a 
rapidly traveling apparatus, the North Pole could T)e reached in a few 
hours. From the north of Noi-way it is about 1,300 miles to the pole. 
It would then be almost possible to go there and back in twenty -four 
hours. When we think of the large sums which have been devoted to 
arctic and antarctic explorations, and remember that very possibly a 
tenth of this amount might produce a machine capable of thoroughly 
exploring both these regions in a few weeks, it seems really worth 
considering whether such money is not wasted. The trackless deserts

1,30 RECENT AERONAUTICAL PBOGRESS, 

of Asia and Africa could be traver.sed and ro-travert^ed, the mysteries 
of Mecca and of Lassa laid at our feet. 

But over and above these most important and far-reaching possibili- 
ties of aerial navigation, there is the likelihood of a revolution in our 
ordinarv modes of travel by one intinitel}^ more rapid, cheap, and con- 
venient. 1 have alread}^ given my reason for supposing that such ti 
means of travel would be rapid. There is also good reason for sup- 
posing it would be economical. No rails or permanent way need be 
laid on the ])illows of the clouds. No roads need be constructed or 
kept in order through the realms of blue. P^ven expensive har})ors, 
dredged channels, light-houses, and beacons need not be maintained 
by the owners of air ships. Going from place to place '' as the crow 
flies" shortens the route and adds to the economy. The convenience of 
the svstem is also evident. Already we are ))eginning to appreciate 
the value of the motor car going from door to door instead of our 
having to get to the train at a fixed moment. But when we can order 
round our aerial motor to take us straight to our destination, passing 
equally well. over land or water, towns or cornfields, independent of 
traffic and roads, then only shall Ave realize what real convenience of 
travel is. 

Speed, economy, and convenience are ])ig factors in a new mode of 
travel. 

But there is one consideration which 1 ])elieve is greatly responsible 
for the tardiness with Avhich this subject progresses. Perils and 
dangers loom before us as a skeleton contaminating and haunting our 
castle in the air. The mere idea of being poised high up in the sky. 
and of falling from the machine through thousands of feet to mother 
earth, is so terrible to contemplate. But the aeronaut of to-day soon 
gets accustomed to being at a giddy height, and without doubt the 
people of to-morrow will have no ([ualms. Imagine the feelings of 
the savage who for the first time sees an express train rush through a 
station at (>() miles an hour, ])anging and clattering with fiendish uproar, 
shaking the very ground, and darting along at a speed incomparable 
to anything he has ever seen before. Would he trust himself to travel 
by that means ^ Though to Hit through the air with the speed of a 
swallow may seem highly dangerous to our inexperienced minds, how 
often do we see a l)ird fall headlong to the ground!' 

What we see, then, looming in the future, more or less near, accord- 
ing to the energies of, and the encouragement we give to, those ])ush- 
ingthe matter forward, is the introduction of a new invention forming 
an invaluabh^ and all-|)owerful weapon ol' war. an important aid to 
science and the ])ractical knowledge of our glob(\ and a speedy, eco- 
nomical, and i)leasant mode of getting from place to place, such as 
will pro}>ably complc^tely revolutionize our present methods of travel. 
Is this to be hastened and (>ncouiag(Hl ^ If so, how can we help to

further the cauf^o^ Like most matters in tliis world, what is most 
wanted is money. Man}' x>lever inventors and engineers are quite 
ready with their plans, but have not the means to complete them. 
We see millions of pounds spent on etpiipment for war. Hundreds 
of thousands devoted to the building of small war ships. We see thou- 
sands sui)seribed for geographical exploration. But for the encourage- 
ment of that invention which msiy ])e paramoiuit over all these we see 
practically nothing dov^oted. When I say '* practically nothing" I 
am not forgetful of a certain few who have devoted nuich to this cause. 
We do not forget the very generous donations which Mr. Alexander 
has given to this societ}', nor the valua])le time and energy which our 
worthy secretary has devoted so gratuitous!}' to further the objects of 
the society. Others, too, are helping as best they can with limited 
time and money; l)ut what we would like to see would be a real solid 
fund built up, such as would enal)le us to get really useful work done. 
Then I feel sure it would not ])e long before the British nation would 
owe a debt of gratitude to the Aeronautical Societv of Great Britain.

INTRODUCTION liV TRESIDENT CIIANUTE. 

''Enoinoers have, until recent years, fought shy of anything- relat- 
ing to aerial navigation. Those who ventured, in spite of the odium 
attached to that study, to look into it at all became very soon satisfied 
that the great obstacle in the way was the lack of a motor sufficiently 
light to sustain its weight and that of an aeroplane upon the air. Fif- 
teen years ago the lightest steam motor was the marine engine, weighing 
60 pounds to the horsepower, while the gas engine weighed very much 
more; the locomotive weighed 200 pounds per horsepower. During 
the past fifteen years a great change has taken place. Steam motors 
have been produced weighing only 10 pounds per horsepower, and gas 
engines have been lightened down to 12^ to 15 pounds per horsepower, 
so that the status, so far as engineers are concerned, is very greatly 
changed, and there is some hope that, for some limited purposes at 
least, man will eventually be able to Hy through the air. There is, 
however, Ixd'ore that can be carried out — l)efore a motor can be ap])lied 
to a Hying machine — an important prol)lem to solve - that of safety or 
that of stability. 

"] had the honor of tidling you, some foui' or five years ago, some- 
thing al)out the progress that had l)een made up to that time. Since 
then further advances have been made by two gentlemen from Day- 
ton, Ohio— Mr. Wilbur Wright and Mr.'Orville VV^-ight— who tried 
some very interesting experiments in Octol)er, 1900. These experi- 
ments were conducted on the seashore of North Carolina, and were 
again resumed last July. These gentleiuen have been bold enough to 
attempt some things which neither Lilienthal. nor Pilcher, noi- myself 
dared to do. They have used sui'faces very uuu-h greater in extent 
than those which hitherto had Ix'en deemed safe, and they have accom- 
plished very remarkal>le results, part of which it was my privilege to 
see on a visit which 1 made to their cam}) about a month ago. 

"1 thought it would l)e interesting to the mendiers of this society to 
be the first to learn of the results accomplished, and therefore I have 
the honor of presenting to j'ou Mr. Wilbur ^Vright."'

134 SOME AERONAUTICAL EXPERIMENTS. 

The difficulties which o]).struct the patliwa>' to success in ilying- 
machine construction are of three general classes: (1) Those which 
relate to the construction of the sustaining- wings; ('2) those which 
relate to the generation and application of the power required to driv^e 
the machine through the air; {?>) those relating to the balancing and 
steering of the machine after it is actuall}- in flight. Of these difficul- 
ties two are already to a certain extent solved. Men already know 
how to construct wings or aeroplanes which, when driven through the 
air at sufficient speed, will not only sustain the weight of the wings 
themselves, ])ut also that of the engine and of the engineer as Avell. 
Men also know how to l)uild engines and screws of sufficient lightness 
and power to drive these planes at sustaining speed. As long ago as 
iSO-t a machine weighing 8,000 pounds demonstrated its power both to 
lift itself from the ground and to maintain a speed of from 30 to 40 
miles per hour, but failed of success owing to the ina])ility of the 
operators to balance and steer it properh*. This inability to balance 
and steer still confronts students of the flying problem, although nearh' 
eight 3'ears have passed. When this one feature has been worked out, 
the age of flying machines will have arrived, for all other difficulties 
are of minor importance. 

The person who merely watches the flight of a bird gathers the 
impression that the ])ird has nothing to think of l)ut the flapping of 
its wings. As a matter of fact this is a very small part of its mental 
lal)or. To even mention all the things the bird must constantly keep 
in mind in order to fly securely through the air would take a consid- 
erable part of the evening. If 1 take this piece of paper, and after 
placing it parallel with the ground, quickly let it fall, it will not settle 
steadily down as a staid, sensil)le piece of paper ought to do, ))ut it 
insists on contravening every recognized rule of decorum, tu)'ning 
over and darting hither and thither in the most erratic manner, nuich 
after the style of an unti-ained horse. Yet this is the style of steed 
that men n^.ust learn to manage before flying can ])ecome an everyda}'^ 
sport. The bird has learned this art of e(iuilibrium, and learned it so 
thoroughly that its skill is not apparent to our sight. ^^^' only learn 
to appreciate it when we try to imitate it. Now, there are two Avays 
of learning how to j-ide a fractious horse: One is to get on him and 
learn by actual practice how each motion and trick may be best met; 
the otli'M- is to sit on a fence and watch the beast a while, and then 
retii'e to the house and at leisure figure out the best way of ovei'com- 
ing his jumps and kicks. The latter S3'stem is the safest, but the 
former, on the whole, turns out the larger proportion of good riders. 
It is very much the same in learning to ride a flying machine; if you 
are looking for perfect safety, 3'ou will do well to sit on a fence and 
watch the birds; but if you really wish to learn, you nmst mount a 
machine and Ix^-ome ac(]uain((>d with its tricks by actual ti'ial. 



SOME AERONAUTICAL EXPERIMENTS. 185 

Herr Otto Lilioiithal seems to have been the first man who loally 
comprehended that balancing was the tirst instead of the last of the 
great prol)lems in connection with human liiglit. He l)egan where 
others left oil', and thus saved the many thousands of dollars that it 
had theretofore l)een customary to spend in ])uilding and fitting 
expensive engines to machines which were uncontrollable when tried. 
He ])uilt a pair of wings of a size suitable to sustain his own weight, 
and made use of gravity as his motor. This motor not only cost him 
nothing to begin with, l)iit it i'e(|uired no expensive fuel while in 
operation, and never had to be sent to the shop for repairs. It had 
one serious drawback, however, in that it always insisted on fixing the 
conditions under which it would work. These were, that the man 
should first ])etake himself and machine to the top of a hill and fly 
with a downward as well as a forward motion. Unless these condi- 
tions were complied with, gravity served no better than a ])alky horse — 
it would not work at all. Althougth Lilienthal nuist have thought tiie 
conditions were rather hard, he nevertheless accepted them till some- 
thing better shoidd turn u}); and in this manner he made some two 
thousand flights, in a few cases landing at a point more than 1,000 feet 
distant from his place of starting. Other men, no doubt, long before 
had thought of trying such a plan. Lilienthal not only thought, Init 
acted; and in so doing pro])a})ly made the greatest conti'ibution to the 
solution of the flying pr()l)ltMn that has ever ])een made by any one man. 
He demonstrated the feasibility of actual practice in the air, without 
which success is impossible. Herr Lilienthal was followed by Mr. 
Pilcher, a young English engineer, and by Mr. Chanute, a distin- 
guished member of the society I now address. A few others have 
built gliding machines, but nearly all that is of real value is due to the 
exi)erimcnts conducted under the direction of the three men just 
mentioned. 

The 1)alancing of a gliding or flying machine is vtny sim})le in 
theory. It consists in causing the center of gravity to coincide with 
the center of pressure. But in actual practice there seems to be an 
almost ))oundless incompatibility of tempiu' which prevents their 
remaining peaceably together for a single instant, so that tho oi^^rator, 
who in this case acts as peacouakei', often suffers injury to himself 
while attempting to Ijring theui together. If a wind strikes a vertical 
plane, the j)ressure on that part to one side of th(>, center will exactly 
balance that on the other side, and the part al»ove the center will 
l)alance that below. But if the plane be slightly inclined, the pi'(>ssure 
on the part nearest th(^ wind is iiu'r(Mis(>d and the pressure on the other 
part decr(>ased, so that the c(Miter of pressui-e is now located, not in 
the center of the surface, but a little toward the side which is in 
advance. If tho plane be still further inclined the center of pi'essure 
will move still farther foiward, and if the wind blow a little to one 



136 SOME AEKONAUTICAL EXPERIMENTS. 

side it will also move over as if to meet it. Now, since neither the 
wind nor the machine for even an instant maintains exactly the same 
direction and velocit}', it is evident that the man who would trace the 
course of the center of pressure nmst l)e very quick of mind; and he 
who would attempt to move his bod}' to that spot at every change 
must ))e very active indeed. Yet this is what Herr Lilienthal attempted 
to do, and did do with most remarkable skill, as his two thousand 
glides sufficiently attest. However, he did not escape l)cing over- 
turned l)y wind gusts several times, and finally lost his life as the 
result of an accidental fall. The Pilcher machine was similar to that 
of Lilienthal. On one occasion, while exhi})iting the flight of his 
machine to several members of the Aeronautical Society of (Jreat 
Britain, it suddenly collapsed and fell to the ground, causing injuries 
to the operator which proved sadly fatal. The method of managment 
of this machine differed in no imyjortant respect from that of Lilien- 
thal, the operator shifting his Ijody to make the centers of pressure 
and gravity coincide. Although the fatalities which befell the design- 
ers of these machines may have been due to the lack of structural 
strength rather than to lack of control, nevertheless it had l)ecome 
clear to the students of the problem that a more perfect method of 
control must be evolved. The Chanute machines marked a great 
advance in both respects. In the nudtiple wing machine the tips 
folded slightly backward under the pressure of wind gusts, so that 
the travel of the center of pressure was thus largely counterbalanced. 
The guiding of the machine was done by a slight movement of the 
operator's 1)ody toward the direction in which it was desired that 
the machine should go. The double-deck machine, built and tried 
at the same time, marked a very great structural advance, as it was 
the first in which the principles of the modern truss bridges were 
fully applied to Hying-machine construction. This machine, in addi- 
tion to its greatly improved construction and general design of i)arfs, 
also differed from the machine of Lilienthal in the operation of its 
tail. In the Lilienthal machine the tail, instead of being fixed in one 
position, was prevented b}' a stop from folding downward beyond a 
certain point, but was free to fold upward without any hindrance. In 
the Chanute machine the tail was at first rigid, but afterwards, at the 
suggestion of Mr. Herring, it was held in place by a si)i'ing that 
allowed it to move slightly either upward or downward with reference 
to its normal position, thus modifying the action of the Avind gusts 
upon it, very much to its advantage. The guiding of the niachint^ 
was effected by slight movements of th(> operator's body, as in fh(» 
multiple-wing machines. Both these machines were nuich more man- 
ageable than the Lilienthal type, and their structural strength, not- 
withstanding their extreme lightness, was such that no fatalities or 
ev<Mi accidiMits mai-ked the slides in;ide with them, although Avinds 



SOME AKROlsrATTTlCAL EXPERIMENTS. 187 

were successfully encountered nuich g-reater in violence tliiin an}' 
which previous experimenters had dared to attempt. 

My own active interest in aeronautical problems dates hack to the 
death of Lilienthal in 1S1X3. The l)rief notice of his death which 
appeared in the telegraphic news at that time aroused a passive inter- 
est which had existed from my childhood and led me to take down 
from the shelves of our home library a l)ook on Animal Mechanism, by 
Professor Marey, which I had already read several times. From this 
I was led to read more modern works, and as ni}^ brother soon became 
ecpially interesti^d with myself we soon passed fi'om the reading to the 
thinking, and linally to the working stage. It seemed to us that the 
main reason why the problem had remained so long unsolved was that 
no one had l)iM'n aV)le to obtain any adequate practict'. We figured 
that Lilienthal in live 5'ears of time had spent only al)out live hours 
in actual gliding through the air. The wonder was not that he had 
done so little, but that he had accomplished so much. It would not be 
considered at all safe for a bicycle rider to attempt to ride through a 
crowded cit>^ street after only live hours' practice, spread out in bits of 
ten seconds each over a period of live years; yet Lilienthal with this 
brief practice was remarkably successful in meeting the fluctuations 
and eddies of wi)id gusts. We thought that if some method could be 
found b}' which it would )>e possil)]e to practice by the hour instead of 
by the second there would be hope of advancing the solution of a very 
difficult problem. It seemed feasil)le to do this by building a machine 
which would be sustained at a speed of 18 mil(\s per hour, and then 
finding a locality where winds of this velocity were connnon. \\'ith 
these conditions, a rope attached to tlie machine to keep it from floating 
backward would answer very nearly the same purpose as a propeller 
driven hy a motor, and it would be possible to practice by the hour, 
and without any serious danger, as it would not be necessary to rise 
far from the ground, and the machine would not ha^■e any forward 
motion at all. We found, according to the accepted tables of air 
pressures on curved surfaces that a machine spreading 200 square feet 
of wing surface would ])e sufficient for our purpose, and that places 
could easily be found along the .Vtlantic coast where winds of 10 to 25 
miles were not at all unconnnon. When the winds were low it was 
our plan to glide from the tops of sand hills, and when they were suf- 
ficiently strong to use a rope for our motoi- and Hy over one sj ot. 
Our next work was to draw up the, plans for a suitable machine. 
Aft(M- much study we finally concluded that tails were a source of 
trouble i-ather than of assistance; and thei-(>foi'(> we decided to dispense 
with them altogether. It seemed I'easonable that if the Itody of the 
operator could be ])laced in a horizontal position instead of tlu^ uprighl, 
as in the machines of Lilienthal. Pilcher. and Chanute, the wind resist- 
ance could be^ very matei'ially i-edu((Hl. since only f scjuare foot

instead of 5 would be exposed. As a full half horsepower could 
be saved by this change, we arranged to try at least the horizontal 
ponition. Then the method of control used l)y Lilienthal, which con- 
sisted in shifting the body, did not seem cjuite as ({uick or effective as 
the case reqnired; so, after long study, we contrived a system consist- 
ing of two large surfaces on the Chanute double-deck plan, and a 
smaller surface placed a short distance in front of the main surfaces in 
such a position that the action of the wind upon it would counter- 
balance the effect of the travel of the center pressure on tiie main sur- 
faces. Thus changes in the direction and velocit}^ of the wind would 
have little disturl)ing effect, and the operator would be required to 
attend only to the steering of the machine, which was to be atfected 
])y curving the forward surface up or down. The lateral equilibrium 
and the steering to right or left was to l^e attained by a peculiar torsion 
of the main surfaces, which was equivalent to presenting one end of the 
wings at a greater angle than the other. In the main frame a few 
changes were also made in the details of construction and trussing 
employed by Mr. Chanute. The most impoi-tant of these were 
(1) the moving of the forward main crosspiece of the frame to the 
extreme front edge; (2) the encasing in the cloth of ail crosspicces and 
ribs of the surfaces; (3) a rearrangement of the wii'es used in trussing 
the two surfaces together, which rendered it possible to tighten all the 
wires l)y simply shortening two of them. 

With these plans we proceeded in the summer of 190* » to Kitty 
Hawk, N. C. , a little settlement located on the strip of land that 
separates Albemarle Sound from tlie Atlantic Ocean. Owing to the 
impossi))ility of obtaining suitable material for a '2(H) s(juare foot 
machine, we were compelled to make it only lOf) scpiare feet in area, 
which according to the Lilienthal tabl(\s would be su]i])orted at an 
angle of ?> in a wind of a])out 21 miles ])er hour. On the very day 
tliat the machine was completed the wiiul bh^w from 2;") to oO miles per 
hour, and we took it out for trial as a kite. We found that, while it 
was su])ported with a man on it in a wind of about 25 miles, its angle 
was much neanM' 20 than 3 '. Even in gusts of oi) miles the angle of 
incidence did not get as low as 8 . although the wintl at this speed has 
more than twic(* the lifting ])ower of a 21 -mile wind. As winds of ?>(> 
miles pel' hour are Jiot plentiful on cleai' days, it was at once evident 
that our plan of ])racticing by the hour, day after day. would have to 
be postponed. Our system of twisting the surfaces to regulate the 
lateral balance was tried and found to be much more elective than 
shifting th(^ operatoi's body. On subseciuent days, when the wind was 
too light to su])|)()rt the machine with a man on it, wo tested it as a 
kite, working the rudders by cords reaching to the gi'ound. The 
results were very satisfactory; yet we were well aware that this method 
ot" testing is never wholly convincing until the I'csults are continued

We th(Mi turned our {ittention to nisiking a series of actual nietisure- 
ments of the lift and drift of tlie machine under various loiuls. So far 
as we were aware this had never previously i)een done with any full- 
size machine. The results obtained were most astonishino-, for it 
appeared that the total horizontal pull of the machine, while sustain- 
ing a weight of 52 pounds, was oidy S.5 pounds, which was less than 
had previously been estimated for head resistance of the framing alone. 
Making allowance for the weight carried, it appeared that the head 
resistance of the framing was but little more than 50 p(>r cent of the 
amount which Mr. Chanute had estimated as tho head resistance of 
the framing of his machine. On the other hand, it appeared sadly 
deficient in lifting power as compared with the calculated lift of curved 
surfaces of its size. This deficiency we supposed might be due to one 
or more of the following causes: (1) That the depth of the curvature 
of oui" surfaces was insufficient. l)eing only about 1 in 22 instead of 1 
in 12. (2) That the cloth used in our wings was not sufficiently air 
tight. (?)) That the Lilienthal tables might themselves be somewhat 
in error. AVe decided to arrang(> our machine for the following year 
so that the depth of curvature of its surfaces could l)e \aried at will 
and its covering air-proofed. 

Our attention was next tui'ued to gliding. })ut no Iiill suitable for 
the purpose could be found near our camp at Kitty Hawk. This com- 
pelled us to take the machine to a point 4 miles south, where the Kill 
Devil sand hill rises from the flat sand to a height of more than 100 
feet. Its main slope is toward the northeast and has an inclination of 
about 10'. On the day of oui' arrival the wind l)lew about 25 miles 
an hour, and as we had had no experience at all in gliding we deemed 
it unsafe to attempt to leave the ground. But on the day following, 
the wind having subsided to li miles per hour, we made about a dozen 
glides. It had been the original intention that the operatoi- should 
run with the machine to ol)tain initial velocitv and assuuK^ the hori- 
zontal position only after the machine was in free flight. ^\ hen it 
came time to land he was to resmne the upright position and light on 
his feet, after the style of previous gliding experimenters. But on 
actual trial we found it much better to employ the help of two assist- 
ants in starting, which the peculiar form of our machine enabled us 
readily to do. and in landing we found that it was entirt^ly practicable 
to land while still reclining in a horizontal position upon the machine. 
Although the landings were made while moving at speeds of more than 
20 miles an hour, neither machine nor operator sufl'ered any injury. 
The slope of the hill was 9.5-. or a drop of I foot in C). We found 
that after attaining a speed of al)out 25 or 80 miles with reference to 
the wind, or lo to 15 miles over the ground, the machine not only 
glided parallel to the slope of the hill, but greatly increased its speed, 
thus indicating its ability to glide on a somewhat less angle than i^.5^, 
when we should feel it safe to rise higher from the surface. The con- 
trol of the machine proved even blotter than we had dared to expect, 



140 SOME AEKONAUTICAL EXPERIMENTS. 

responding- quickly to the slightest motion of the rudder. With these 
glides our experiments for the year 1900 closed. Although the hours 
and hours of practice we had hoped to o})tain tinall}' dwindled down to 
about two minutes, we were very much pleased with the general results 
of the trip, for, setting out as we did, with almost revolutionary theo- 
ries on many points and an entirely untried form of machine, we con- 
sidered it quite a point to be able to return without having our pet 
theories completely knocked in the head by the hard logic of experi- 
ence, and our own brains dashed out in the l)argain. Everything 
seemed to us to confirm the correctness of our original opinions, (1) that 
practice is the key to the secret of flying; (2) that it is practicable to 
assume the horizontal position ; (3) that a smaller surface set at a negative 
angle in front of the main bearing surfaces, or wings, will largely count- 
eract the efi^ect of the fore and aft travel of the center of pressure; (1) 
that steering up and down can be attained with a rudder without mov- 
ing the position of the operator's ))ody; (5) that twisting the Avings so 
as to present their ends to the wind at dift'erent angles is a more prompt 
and efficient way of maintaining lateral equilibrium than shifting the 
body of the operator. 

When the time came to design our new machine for 1901, we decided 
to make it exactly like the previous machine in theory and method of 
operation. But as th<>, former machine was not able to support the 
weight of the operator when flown as a kite, except in very high 
winds and at very large angles of incidence, we decided to increase 
its lifting power. Accordingly, the curvature of the sui'faces was 
increased to 1 in 12, to conform to the shape on which LilienthaFs 
table was based, and to he on the safe side we decided also to increase 
the area of the machine from 165 square feet to 30S square feet, 
although so large a machine had never l)efore ])een deemed con- 
tr()llal)le. The Lilienthal machine had an area of 1.51 scpiare feet, 
that of Pilcher 1(55 square feet, and the Chanute double-decker 131 
s(|uare feet. As our system of control consisted in a manipulation of 
the surfaces themselves instead of a shifting of the operator's body, 
we hoped that the new machine would l)c controllable, notwithstand- 
ing its great size. According to calculations, it would o])tain support 
in a wind of 17 miles per hour with an angle of incidence of only 3 . 

Our experience of the previous year having shown the necessity 
of a suitable l)uilding for housing the niachin(\ we erected a cheap 
frame building, 1(5 f(H't wide, 25 feet long, and 7 feet high at the 
(Mives. yVs our machine was 22 feet wide, 11 feet long (including the 
iiiddcr). :ui<l al>out t! feet high, it was not necessary to take the ma- 
chine apart in any way in order to house it. Both ends of the build- 
ing, except the gable parts, were made into doors, which hinged 
above, so that wIkmi ()})(Mied they formed an awning at each end and 
left an entrance the full width of the building. We went into camp 
al)out the middle of July, aiul were soon joined by Mr. E. C. Ilufl'aker,

of Teiincssei', un exjx'rieiiccd iioioiKiuticul iiivestij^ator in the ciiiploy 
of Mr. Chanutc bv whom hiw servk-es were kindly h^incd, and l>y Dr. 
G. A. Spratt, of Peinisylvania, a young nian who has math' ,sonie val- 
ual)l(^ investigations of tlie properties of variously curved surfaces 
and the trav(d of the center of pressure thereon. Early in August 
Mr. Chanute came down from Chicago to witness our experiments 
and spent a week in canlp with us. These gentlemen, witli my ))r<)ther 
and myself, formed our cam})ing party, but in addition we liad in 
many of our ex])eriments the valuable assistance of ^Jr. A\ '. ,) . Tate 
and Ml-. Dan. Tate, of Kittyhawk. 

The machine was completed and tried for the first time on the 2Tth 
of 'luly, in a wind blowing al)out 13 miles an hour. The operator 
having taken a ])o.sition where the center of pressure was supposed to 
be, an attempt at gliding was made, l)ut the machine turned downward 
and landed after going onl}' a few 3'ards. This indicated that the 
center of gravity was too far in fi'ont of the center of pressure. In 
the second attempt the operator took a position several inches fartiier 
back, but the result was nmch the same. lie ke|)t moving farther and 
farther back wdth each trial, till tinally he occu})ied a position nearly a 
foot l>ack of that at whicli we had expected to find the center of pressure. 
The machine then sailed off and made an undulating flight of a little more 
than 800 feet. To the onlookers this flight seemed very successful, ))ut 
to the ()})erator it was known that the full power of the rudder had been 
re([uired to keep the macliine from either running into the groimd or 
I'ising so high as to lose all headway. In the IDOO machine one-fourth 
as nmch rudder action had been sufficient to give nmch ])etter control. 
It was apparent that something Avas radically wrong, though we Avere 
for some time unable to locate the trouble. In one glide the machine 
rose higher and higher till it lost all headway. This was the position 
from which Lilienthal had always found difficulty to extricate himself, 
as his machine then, in spite of his greatest exertions, manifested a 
tendency to dive downward almost vertically and strike* the ground 
head on with frightful velocity. In this case a warning cr}' from the 
ground caused the operator to turn the rudder to its full extent and 
also to move his l)ody slightly forward. The machine then settled 
slowly to the ground, maiTitaining its horizontal position almost per- 
fectly, and landed without any injury at all. This was very encourag- 
ing, as it showed that one of the very greatest dangers in machines 
with horizontal tails had })een overcome by the use of a front rudder. 
Several glides later the same experience was repeated Avitli the same 
result. In the latter case the machine had o\on commenced to move 
backward, but was nevertheless brought safely to the ground in a 
horizontal position. On the whole, this da^^'s experiments were 
encouraging, for while the action of the rudder did not seem at all like 
that of our 1900' machine, yet we had escaped without difficulty from 
positions which had proved very dangerous to preceding experiment-

ers, and after less than one minute's actual practice had made a glid( 
of more than 300 feet, at an angle of descent of 10-, and with { 
machine nearly twice as large as had previously been considered safe 
The trouble with its control, which has been mentioned, we believec 
could be corrected when we should have located its cause. Severa 
possible explanations occurred to us, l)ut we tinally concluded that th( 
trouble was due to a reversal of the direction of th(^ travel of the centei 
pressure at small angles. In deeply curved surfaces the center o: 
pressure at 90° is near the center of the surface, but moves forvvart 
as the angle becomes less, till a certain point is reached, varying witl 
the depth of curvature. After this point is passed, the center o: 
pressure, instead of continuing to move forward, with the decreasing 
angle, turns and moves rapidly toward the rear. The phenomena ar( 
due to the fact that at small angles the wind strikes the forward pari 
of the surface on the upper side instead of the lower, and thus thi.- 
part altogether ceases to lift, instead of being the most effective 
part of all, as in the case of the plane. Lilienthal had callec 
attention to the danger of using surfaces witli a curvature as greai 
as 1 in 8, on account of this action on the upper side; but h( 
seems never to have investigated the curvature and angle at whicl 
the phenomena entirely cease. My brother and I had never madf 
any original investigation of the matter, but assimied that a curvatu ( 
of one in twelve would be safe, as this was the curvature on whicL 
Lilienthal l)ased his tables. However, to he on the safe side, insteac 
of using the arc of a circle, we had made the curve of our machine 
very abrupt at the front, so as to expose the least possible area to thi.- 
downward pressure. While the machine was Iniilding Messrs. Huff- 
aker and Spratt had suggested that we would lind this reversal of the 
center of pressure, but we believed it sufficiently guarded against. 
Accordingh^ we were not at first disposed to believe that this reversa, 
actually existed in our machine, althougli it offered a perfect exphma- 
tion of the action we had noticed in gliding. Our peculiar plan oi 
control by forward surfaces, instead of tails, was leased on the assump- 
tion tiiat tlic center of pressure would continue to move farthei' and 
farther forward as the angle of incidence became less, and it Avill be 
readily perceived that it would make quite a difference if the front 
surface instead of counteracting this assumed forward traxel should 
in reality be expediting an actual 1)ackward movement. For seNcral 
days we were in a state of indecision, but wtn'e tinally convinced by 
o])serving the following phenomena (tig. 1): We had removed the 
upper surface from the machine and were flying it in a wind to see at 
what angles it would be supportcnl in winds of different strengths. 
We noticed that in light winds it tlew in the upper position shown in 
the figure, with a strong upward pull on the cord r. As the wind 
became stronger the angle of incidence became less, and the surface 
tlew^ in the position shown in the middle of the figure, with a slight

hoi'izontal pull; hut when the wind l»ecanic still stronger it took the 
lower position shown in the ligure, witli a strong- downward ])ull. It 
at once occurred to me that here was the answer to our problem, for 
it is evident that in the tirst case the center of pressure was in front of 
the center of gravity, and thus pushed up the front edge; in the second 
case they were in coincidence and the surface in e([uilibriuni, while in 
the third cas(^ the center of pr(>ssure had reached a ])oint e\ en behind 
the center of gravity, and there was therefore a downward })ull on the

cord. This point having been delinitely settled, we proceeded to truss 
down the ribs of the whole machine, so as to reduce the depth of 
curvature. In tig. 2 line 1 shows the original curvature; line 2, the 
curvature when supporting the opei'ator's weight, and line ;>, the curv- 
ature after trussing. 

On resuming our gliding, we found that the old conditions of the 
preceding year had returned, and after a few trials made a glide of 
3G6 feet and soon after one of 881) feet. The machine with its new

curvature never failed to respond promptly to even small movements 
of the rudder. T1k» operator could cause it to almost skim the ground, 
following the undulations of its surface, or he could cause it to sail 
out almost on a level with t\\v starting point, and passing high above 
the foot of the hill, gradually settle down to the ground. The wind 
on this day was blowing 11 to 14 miles per hour. The next day, the 
conditions lacing favorable, the machine was again taken out for trial. 



144 SOME AERONAUTICAL EXPERIMENTS. 

This time the velocity of the wind was 18 to 22 miles per lioiir. At 
first we felt some doubt as to the safet}^ of attempting- free flight in so 
strong" a wind, with a machine of over 300 square feet, and a practice 
of less than live minutes spent in actual flight. But after several pre- 
liminary experiments we decided to try a g'lide. The control of the 
machine seemed so good that we then felt no apprehension in sailing 
boldly forth. And thereafter Ave made glide after glide, sometiiues 
following the ground closely and sometimes sailing high in the air. 
Mr. Chanute had his camera with him and took pictures of some of 
these glides, several of which are among those shown. 

We made glides on subsequent days, whenever the conditions were 
favorable. The liighest wind thus experimented in was a little over 
12 meters per second — nearly 27 miles per hour. 

It had been our intention when building the machine to do the larger 
part of the experimenting in the following- manner: When the wind 
]>lew IT miles an houi' or more we would attach a rope to the machine 
and let it rise as a kite with the operator upon it. When it sliould 
reach a proper height the operator would cast off the rope and glide 
down to the ground just as from the top of a hill. In this wa}" we 
woidd l)e saved the trouble of carrying the machine up hill after each 
glide, and could make at least ten glides in the time required for one 
in the other way. But when we came to tr}" it we found that a wind 
of IT miles, as measured by Richard's anemometer, instead of sus- 
taining- the machine with its operator, a total weight of 240 pounds, 
at an angle of incidence of 3 , in reality would not sustain the 
machine alone — 1(»0 pounds — at this angle. Its lifting capacity seemed 
scarcely one-third of the calculated amount. In order to make sure 
that this Avas not due to the porosit}^ of the cloth, Ave constructed two 
small experimental surfaces of equal size, one of Avhich Avas air-proofed 
and the other left in its natural state; but Ave could detect no differ- 
ence in their lifting- poAvers. For a time we were led to suspect that 
the lift of curved surfaces little exceeded that of planes of the same 
size, but further investigation and experiment led to the opinion that 
(1) the anemometer used bv us overrecorded tlu* true velocity of the 
Avind by nearly 15 per cent; (2) that the well-knoAvn Smeaton coeffi- 
cient of 0.00.5 V" for the wind pressure at !M) is prolmbly too great Ija'' 
at least 20 p(M- cent; (3) that LilicMithars estimate that the })ressure on 
a curved surface having an angle of incidence of 3 e([uals 0.545 of the 
pressure at 90 ' is too large, being nearly 50 per cent greater than very 
recent experiments of our own with a s])(>cial ])ressure-testing- machine 
indicate: (4) that the supei'position of the surfaces somcAvhat reduced 
the lift per scjuare foot, as compai-ed with a single surface of ecpial 
area. 

In gliding experiments, however, the amount of lift is of less 
relative importance than the ratio of lift to drift, as this alone decides 
the angle of gliding deseent. In a plane the pressure is alwaAs per- 



SOME AERONAUTICAL EXPERIMENTS. 145 

pcndicular to the surfuce, and the ratio of lift to drift is therefore tlie 
same as that of the coskie to.the sine of the angle of incidence. But 
in curved surfaces a ver^^ remarkable situation is found. The pressure, 
instead of being uniformly normal to the chord of the arc, is usually 
inclined considerably in front of the perpendicular. The result is 
that the lift is greater and the drift less than if the pressure w(>re 
normal. Lilienthal was the first to discover this exceedingly important 
fact, which is fully set forth in his book, Bird Flight the Basis of the 
Flying Art, but owing to some errors in the methods he used in making 
measurements, question was raised by other investigators not only as 
to the accuracy of his figures, but even as to the existence of any tan- 
gential force at all. Our experiments confirm the existence of this 
force, though our measurements difl'er considerably from those of 
Lilienthal. While at Kitty Hawk we spent much time in measuring 
the horizontal pressure on our unloaded machine at various angles of 
incidence. We found that at lo the horizontal pressure was about 
2?) pounds. This included not only the drift proper, or horizontal 
component of the pressure on the side of the surface, but also the head 
resistence of the framing as well. The weight of the machine at the 
time of this test was about 108 pounds. Now, if the pressure had 
been normal to the chord of the surface, the drift proper would have 
been to the lift (108 pounds) as the sine of 13° is to the cosine of 13°, or 

.22 X 108 

-— —21+ pounds; but this slightly exceeds the total pull of 23 

• y i 

pounds on our scales. Therefore it is evident that the average pressure 

on the surface instead of being normal to the chord was so far inclined 

toward the front that all the head resistance of framing and wires 

used in the construction was more than overcome. In a wind of 14 

miles per hour resistance is l)y no means a negligible factor, so that 

tangential is evidently a force of considerable value. In a higher 

wind, which sustained the machine at an angle of 10°, the pull on the 

scales was 18 })ounds. With the pressure normal to the chord the 

.IT X 98" 
drift proper would have been - — qo = IT pounds, so that, although 

the higher wind velocity must have caused an increase in the head 
resistance, the tangential force still came within 1 pound of over- 
coming it. After our return from Kitty Hawk we began a series of 
experiments to accurately determine the amount and direction of the 
pressure produced on curved surfaces when acted upon by winds 
at the various angles from zero to 90°. These experiments are not 
yet concluded, but in general they support Lilienthal in the claim 



c The travel of the center of pressure made it necessary to i)ut sand on the front 
rudder to bring the centers of gravity and })ressnre into coincidence. Consequently 
the weight of the machine varied from 98 pounds to 108 ])ounds in tiie different 

tests.

that the curves give pressures more favorable in amount and direction 
than planes; but we find marked differences in the exact values, 
especially at angles below 1(P. We were unable to obtain direct 
measurements of the horizontal pressures of the machine with the 
operator on board, l)ut b}^ comparing the distance traveled in gliding 
with the vertical fall it was easily calculated that; at a speed of 24 
miles per hour the total horizontal resistances of our machine when 
bearing the operator amounted to 40 pounds, which is e(iuivalcnt to 
about 2i horsepower. It nuist not be supposed, however, that a motor 
developing this power would be sufficient to drive a man-l)earing 
machine. The extra weight of the motor would require either a 
larger machine, higher speed, or a greater angle of incidence in order 
to support it, and therefore more power. It is probal)le, however, 
that an engine of «> horsepower, weighing loo pounds, would answer 
the purpose. Such an engine is entirely practicable. Indeed, work- 
ing motors of one-half this w^eight per horse]X)wer (9 pounds per 
horsepower) have been constructed by several different l)uilders. 
Increasing the speed of our machine from 24 to l>3 miles per hour 
reduced the total horizontal pressure from 40 to about 35 pounds. 
This was quite an advantage in gliding as it made it possible to sail 
about 15 per cent farther with a given drop. However, it would ])e 
of little or no advantage in reducing the size of the motor in a power- 
driven machine, because the lessened thrust would be counterbalanced 
by the increased speed per minute. Some years ago Professor Lang- 
ley called attention to the great economv which might be obtained 
by using very high speeds, and fi'om this many were led to sup- 
pose that speeds of 50 or OO miles an hour were essential to suc- 
cess; but the introduction of curved surfaces as 'su])stitutes for 
planes has very greatly reduced the speed of greatest economy. The 
probability is that the first flying machines will have a relatively low 
speed, pcirhaps not nuich exceeding 20 miles per hour. l)ut the i)rol)- 
lem of increasing the speed will be much simpler in some respects 
than that of increasing the speed of a steamboat; for, whereas in 
the latter case the size of the engine must inci'ease as the cube of the 
speed, in the flying machine until extremely high speeds are reached 
the capacity of the motor increases in less than simple ratio; and there 
is even a decrease in the fuel consumption per mile of travel. In 
other words, to double the speed of a steamship (and the same is true 
of the balloon type of air ship) eight times the engine and l)oiler capa- 
city would be required and four times the f\wA consumption per mile 
of travel; Avhile a flying machine would recjuire engines of less than 
(loul)h' tlie size, and there would ho an actual decrease in the fuel con- 
sum})ti()ii per mile of trav(d. Hut, looking at the matter conversely, 
the great disad\'antage of the Hying machine is apparent; for in the 
latter no flight at all is possil)l(> unless liie ))r(>])()rti()n of horsepower 
to flying caj)acity is \-ery high; but, on the other hand, a steamship is

•4 miles an hour even if the engines were reduced to 1 horsepower. 
The pro])lenis of land and water travel were so1v(m1 in th(>, nineteenth 
century, hecause it was possible to begin with small achievements and 
gradually work up to our present success. T\\o Hying problem was 
teft over to the twentieth century, l)ecaus(> in this case the art nuist Ije

ol)taiiuKl. 

Howevei'. there is anotluu' way of flying which re(|uires no artificial 
motor, and many workers Ixdieve that sucec^ss will first come by this 
road. 1 refer to the soai'ing Hight, ])y which the machine is perma- 
nently sustained in the air by th(^ same means that are em])loyed 1)y 
soaring l)irds. They s})read their wings to the wind, and sail T)V the 
hour, with no perceptible exertion ])eyond that reciuired to balance 
and steer themselves. What sustains them is not dc^finitely known, 
though it is almost certain that it is a rising current of air. But 
whether it be a rising current or something else, it is as well al)le to 
support a fl^nng machine as :i bird, if man once learns the art of util- 
izing it. In gliding experiments it has long ])een known that the rate 
of vertical descent is very nuich retarded and the duration of the 
flight greatly prolonged if a strong wind blows u\) the face of the hill 
parallel to its surface. Our machine, when gliding in still air, has a 
rate of vertical descent of nearly 6 feet per second, while in a wind 
blowing 26 miles per hour up a steep hill we made glides in whicli the 
rate of descent was less than 2 feet per second. And during the 
larger part of this time, while the machine remained exactly in the 
rising current, there was no descent at all, l)ut even a slight rise. ]f 
the operator had had sufficient skill to keep himself from passing 
beyond the rising current, he would have been sustained indetinitely 
at a higher point than that from which he started. The illustration 
shows one of these very slow glides at a time when the machine was 
practically at a standstill. The failure to advance more rapidly causinl 
the photogi'apher some troutjle in aiming, as you will perceive. In 
looking at this picture 3'ou will readily understand that the excite- 
ment of gliding experiments does not entireh^ cease with the breaking 
up of camp. In the photographic dark room at home we pass moments 
of as thrilling interest as any in the field, when the image begins to 
appear on the plate and it is yet an opon ([uestion whether we liave a 
picture of a Hying machines or merely a ])atcli of open sky. These 
slow glides in ri.>>ing currents probably hold out greater hope of exten- 
sive practice than any other method within man's reach, but they have

the di,siidvantao"o of reciiiirino- ratliei" .sti'ono- winds or very laro-e sup- 
porting- .surfaces. However, when oliding- operators have attained 
greater skill, the}^ can, with comparative safet}', maintain themselves 
in the air for hours at a time in this way, and thus by constant prac- 
tice so increase their knowledge and skill that the}' can rise into the 
higher air and search out the currents which enable the soaring ])irds 
to transport themselves to any desired point l)y tirst rising in a circle 
to a great height and then sailing off at a descending angle. The last 
illustration shows the machine, alone, il^'ing in a wind of 35 miles per 
hour on the face of a steep hill 100 feet high. It will be seen that the 
machine not only pulls upward, but also pulls forward in the direction 
from which the wind blows, thus overcoming l)oth gravity and the 
speed of the wind. We tried the same experiment with a man on it, 
but found danger that the forward pull would l^ecome so strong that the 
men holding the ropes would l)e dragged from their insecure foothold 
on the slope of the hill. So this form of experimenting was discon- 
tinued after four or five minutes' trial. 

In looking over our experiments of the past tw^o years, with models 
and full-size machines, the following points stand out with clearness: 

1. That the lifting power of a large machine, held stationary in a 
wind at a small distance from the earth, is much less than the Lilien- 
thal table and our own lalioratory experiments would lead us to 
expect. When the machine is moved through the air, as in gliding, 
the discrepancv seems much less marked. 

2. That the ratio of drift to lift in well-shaped surfaces is less at 
angles of incidence of 6° to 12° than at an angle of 3"-. 

3. That in arched surfaces the center of pressure at 90° is near the 
center of the surface, l)ut moves slowly forward as the angle becomes 
less, till a critical angle, varying with the shape and depth of the 
curve, is reached, after which it moves rapidly toward the rear till the 
angle of no lift is found. 

•1. That with similar conditions large surfaces may be controlled 
with not nuich greater difficulty than small ones, if the control is 
effected b}' manipulation of the surfaces themselv(^s, rather than l)y a 
movement of the bod}^ of the operator. 

5. That the head resistances of the framing can ])e hi-ought to a 
point nuich below that usually estimated as necessary. 

6. That tails, both vertical and horizontal, may with safety l)c clinfi- 
nated in gliding and other Hying experiments. 

7. That a horizontal position of the operator's l)ody may be assumed 
without excessive danger, and thus the head i-(\sistan<-(^ rcxluccd to 
a))out one-fifth that of the upright position. 

8. That a pair of superposed or tandem surfaces has less lift in pro- 
portion to drift than either surface separately, even after making 
allowance for weight and head resistance of the connections.

Mai\y attempts ImNc Ix^en inad(^ to sum iq) tho work of tho nine- 
teenth century and to detine its principal lines of }jros4ress. In esti- 
mates of the relative importance of the books pul)lis]u>d during- this 
period there has l)een some diverg-ence of view, but regarding- one of 
them no element of doul)t seems to have entered the minds of the 
critics. By unanimous consent Darwin's Origin of Species is accorded 
a conunanding- position among the works wliich have influenced the 
intellectual life of the century. It would be difficult to overestimate 
the effect which the doctrine of evolution has wrought. The principle 
of orderl}^ and harmonious development which it embodies has found 
application, not only in explaining the wide diversity of organic 
species, but in unifying the events of history, in elucidating the 
origin of language, and in throwing* light on difficult (juestions in 
every department of human knowledge. The idea of evolution may 
indeed })e traced back through the writings of many centuries. The 
early philosophers, though not possessed of the inmiense collection 
of recorded phenomena by which modern men of science may test 
their theories, were constantly occupied with great problems demand- 
ing the wid(>st generalization. In attempting to account for the earth 
audits inhabitants they made the lirst steps in the direction which 
Darwin subsequently pursued. 

It would l)e interesting to recall the strange traditions in which 
primitive peoples have recorded theii' vague imaginings of the origin 
of things. But the absence of even an attempt at careful reasoning 
renders such tales of no value for our present ])urpose. The (ireek 
philosophers were not oblivious to the value of ol)servation as a check

available were too crude to give aeciirate positions of the heavenly 
bodies. Even Copernicus, though he estal)lished the sun at the center 
of our system, and thus paved the way for the nel)uiar iiypothesis, 
retained the epic^n-les of the Greeks. Kepler, ))asino- his investiga- 
tions upon the observations of Tycho Brahe, proved that the planets 
move in ellipses with the sun at the focus, and reuioved all vestige of 
doul)t as to the general plan of the solar system. The harmony which 
characterizes the motions of the planets and a knowledge of the ell'ect 
of gravitation led Kant to formulate an explanation of the origin of 
the solar system, which subsequently found more perfect expression 
in the nebular hypothesis of Laplace. 

In this h3'pothesis Laplace seeks to account for the formation of 
the sun and planets through the contraction of a vast nebulous cloud 
which once tilled -the entire solar system, extending to the orbit of 
Neptune. This mass, which he considered to be tiery hot, vyas sup- 
posed to be in rotation. As it cooled, through radiation into space, it 
contracted toward the center. The result of this contraction was to 
increase the velocity of rotation, and when through increasing velocitj^ 
the centrifugal force at the periphery counterbalanced the attraction 
of the central mass a ring was thrown oil'. Further contraction 
resulted in the formation of other rings, in each of which the mattin* 
collected about its densest part, and thus produced a planet. Before 
the}^ had time to cool these planets in turn threw oil' rings, which, 
with the single exception of Saturn's ring system, condensed into 
satellites. 

This celebrated hypothesis, though unsupported ])y mathematical 
proof, has occupied n dominant position since the time of its pul)lica- 
tion, more than a century ago. It has been subjected to much criti- 
cism, but most of the objections raised by Faye and others have been 
met by modifications of the hypothesis. C^f late it has encountered 
fresh attacks on the part of Chaml)erlin and Moulton, and it now 
seems doul)tful whether it will be possible to overcome their criticisms, 
which ar(» ])ased on dynamical considerations. It may ]5rove to be 
sufficient, however, to foi'sake the lenticular mass of va])()r predicated 
by Laplace in favor of the spiral form which Kecder has shown to 
characterize so many nebuhe. 

The nebular hypothesis seeks to account for a system like our own, 
wherein a ccMitral sun is surrounded by planets and satellites, originally 
self-luminous, l>ut ultimately cooled to the point where they are lumi- 
nous only through reflected light. The stars are so distant from us 
that an}' jdanets which may attend tlu^ni are beyond the reach of the 
most powerful telescopes. In some of the planetary and spiral nebuhe, 
such as the Great Nebula in Andromeda (PI. I), we perhaps observe 
the earlier stages of the process of condensation, l)ut no distinct (>vi- 
clence of progressive change has y(^t ])een gathei(>d from telescopic

obsemation. In seekino" foi' oviciciu-c of stellar evolution, on a plan 
conipreheu.sive enoiiyb to'include a place for every star in the heavens, 
we may begin with visual and' |)hotographii' observations with the tele- 
scope. Such reniarkal)le photoo-raphs as that of the Andromeda nebula 
seem to bring us into the very presence of a greater system, perhaps 
more nearly compai'able in size with the Milky Wa}' than with the solar 
system, in the actual process of formation. But on ticcount of the long 
periods of time which must elapsi^ before changes in this distant mass 
may become sufficiently great to be appreciable, and for many other 
reasons, we could not hope to l)ase a complete scheme of stellar evolu- 
tion on such photographs alone. Our observational methods must also 
include the means of solving physical, chemical, and gravitational 
problems as they present themselves, not close at hand in the labora- 
tory, ])ut in inconceivably distant regions of space. For this reason 
it would have been impossible prior to the invention of the spectro- 
scope to arrange the stars according' to any clearly defined system of 
development. The principal advances which have been made in the 
study of stellar evolution are therefore confined to the period which 
has elapsed since the middle of the nineteenth century. 

Thus the investigation of stellar evolution has been contemporaneous 
with the investig'ation of organic evolution. Indeed, the epoch-making- 
discovery of the chemical comp()sitit)n of the sun 1)v Kirchhofl and 
Bunsen was made in the year of the pul>lication of the Origin of Spe- 
cies. Before this discovi^w the meaning of spectral lines had been as 
obscure as the meaning of Egyptian hieroglyphs ])rior to the discovery 
of tlu> Kosetta stone. After it the chemical analysis of a star l)ecame 
hardly less difficult than the analysis of an uidvnown su))stance in the 
la1)oratorv. Furthermore, it soon ])ecame apparent that the light of a 
star, as decomposed by a prism, was competent to define the star's posi- 
tion in a general scheme of development, in which exery ad\ance from 
the unformed neladous (doud on through the highest degree of stellar 
brilliancy to such a final stage as is typified by the moon can be ilefined 
with but littl(> danger of (M-ror. Before we proceed to considin* some 
of the evidences of stellar evolution, let us examine some of the instru- 
ments and methods without which the discoveries to ])o subse((uently 
described would have been impossible. 

1 shall confine my remarks on modiM'n asti-ophysical instrinnents to 
those at present (Muployc^l at the Yerkes ()t)ser\atory, j)artly becaus(> 
nearly all the celestial ph()tograi)hs reproduced in the figures were 
taken with these instruments and })artly because of the cotivenience of 
illustrating tliem. Hut befoi'e describing the great t(descop(\ which 
forms tlie principal a])paratus of the obser\atory, I wish to [)oint out 
that many of the most important results of astronomy, results which 
could not be obtained wi(h a i)owei'f"ul telesc()])e foi- the \-erv rt^ason of 
its great power, have Ikhmi dei'i\'ed from the use of an ordinary c:un(Ma

with ju8t such a lens as is found in the possession of thousands of 
amateur photographers. If we take an ordinary camera and point it on 
a clear night toward the North Pole, it will l)e found after an exposure 
of one or two hours that the stars which lie near the pole have drawn 
arcs of circles upon the plate (PI. II). This is due to the fact that the 
earth is rotating upon its axis at such a rate as to cause ever}" star in 
the sky to appear to travel through a complete circle once in twenty- 
four hours The nearer the star to the pole the smaller does this circle 
become. As we move away from the pole we find the curvature of the 
star trails growing less and less, until at the equator they appear as 
straight lines. 

Just such photographs as these are frequently employed in astro- 
nomical investigations; e. g., for the purpose of recording variations 
in a star's brightness, which would "be shown on the plate b}- changes 
in the brightness of the trail. But for most purposes it is desirable 
to have photographs of stars in which they are represented as points 
of light rather than as lines. To obtain such photographs it is neces- 
sary to mount the camera in such a wa}'^ that it can 1)e turned about an 
axis parallel to the earth's axis once in twenty-four hours. A camera 
so mounted becomes an equatorial photographic telescope, differing in 
no important respect save in the construction of its lens from an 
instrument like the i()-inch Yerkes telescope. 

But the scale of the photogra[)hs obtained with such a camera differs 
in marked degree from that of the photographs furnished b}^ the tele- 
scope. Here, for example, is a region of the Milky Way, photographed 
by Professor Barnard with one of the old-fashioned lenses formerly 
emploj^ed in portrait galleries (PI. III). Such a picture as this is of 
the greatest service in all studies of the structure of the Milky Way, 
for it brings before us at a single glance an immense region of the 
sky, thus permitting us to trace the general features which are com- 
mon to this area. You will notice in the midst of this star cloud a 
little cluster of stars, here so denseh' packed together that no details 
of the cluster can be distinguished. If our investigations required us 
to single out some individual star in the cluster, perhaps for the pur- 
pose of analyzing its light, it is evident that the portrait lens would 
prove inadequate for our purpose. It is in such a case as this that an 
instrument like the 40-inch telescope comes into play. The camera 
with which this photograph was taken has a lens 6 inches in diameter, 
of 81 inches focal length. The great telescope has a lens 40 inches in 
diameter, of 64 feet focal length. Thus the scale of the photographs 
made with the telescoi)e is about twenty-five times that of the photo- 
graphs made with the portrait lens. The portrait lens covers a large 
area of the sky on a very small scale, while the tield of the telescope 
is limited to a small region, which is depicted on a large scale. Let 
us see the difference between the two instruments as illustrated by

the photoo-raphs theniselves (compiiiv PI. Ill with PI. TV). The sniiiU 
chi.ster, which in reality contains several thousands of stars, is resoh (hI 
l)}^ Mr. Ritehey's photograph, taken with the larye telescope, into all 
its constituent parts, stars less than one secoml of arc apart ))einu' 
clearly separated on this ereat scale. 

Having seen this illustration of the superior power of the large 
telescope you may periiaps lie interested to become more closely 
ac(juainted with the instrument itself (PI. V). The great weight of 
the 4()-inch lens, amounting with its cell to half a ton, requires that 
the tube which supports it. here taking the place of the camera box of 
the previous instrument, shall be of immense rigidity and strength. 
This tube, H4 feet in hmgth, is supported at its middle point by the 
declination axis, which in its turn is carried l)y tlie })olaraxis, adjusted 
to accurate parallelism with the axis of the earth. By means of driv- 
ing mechanism in the upper section of the iron column the whole 
instrument is turned about this polar axis at such a rate that it would 
complete one revolution in twenty-four hours. Although the mov- 
ing parts weigh" over 'H) tons, thc^ telescope can be directed to an}" 
part of the sky by hand, but this operation is much facilitated by the 
us(> of electric motors provided for th(^ purpose. When once directed 
toward the object to be observed it will frequently happen that the 
lower end of the telescope is far out of reach above the o))server's 
head. For this I'eason the entire floor of the observing room, 75 feet 
in diameter, is constructed like an electric elevator, which, by throw- 
ing a switch, can he made to rise or fall through a distance of 23 feet. 
Thus th<^ lower end of the telescope is rendered accessible even for 
o])jects near the horizon. In order that the o})serving slit may be 
directed to an}" part of the sky the dome, 1»() fe(^t in diameter, is 
mounted on wheels and can })e turned to any desired position by means 
of an electric motor controlled from the rising-floor. 

The telescope is used for a great variety of purposes in conjiuiction 
with appropriate instruments, which are attached to the lower end of 
the tu})e near the point where the image is formed. 1 have already 
shown a photograph of a star cluster taken with this telescope, but 
without describing the process of making it. As a matter of fact the 
object-glass of the 40-inch telescope was designed for visual observa- 
tions, and its maker, the late Alvan (1. Clark, had no idea that it 
would ever be employed for photogra})hy. Without dwelling upon 
the distinguishing features of visual and photographic lenses 1 may 
say that the former is so (h'signed l)v the op'"ician as to unit(^ into an 
imago those rays of light, particularly tlu^ yellow and the green, to 
which the eye is most sensitive. With the only \ arieties of optical glass 
which can be obtained in large pieces it is impossible to unite in a sin- 
gle clearly deflned image all of the red, the yellow, the green, the blue, 
and the violet rg,ys which i-each us from a star. Therefore when the 



154 STELLAR EVOLUTION. 

optician decides to produce an iniai^e nio.st suitable for eye observations 
he delil)erately discards the blue and violet rays, simph' because tliej" 
are less ini])()rtant to the eye than the yellow and green rays. For 
this reason the iniag-e of a star produced by a large refracting telescope 
is surrounded ])y a 1)1 ue halo containing the rays discarded l>v the 
optician. These very rays, however, are the ones to which the ordi- 
nar}^ photographic plate is most sensitive; hence in a photographic 
telescope the blue and violet rays are united, while the yellow and 
green rays are discarded. 

The 40-inch telescope is of the lirst type, constructed primarily for 
visual observations. In order to adapt it for photography Mr. G. W. 
Ritchev, of the o})servator3^ staff, simply places before the (isochro- 
matic) plate a thin screen of yellow glass, which cuts out the blue rays, 
but allows the yellow and green rays to pass. As isochromatic plates 
are sensitive to yellow and green light, there is noditficulty in securing 
an image with the rays which the oljject glass unites into a perfect 
image. During the entire time of the exposure a star which lies just 
outside the region to be photogiuphed is observed through an eye- 
piece magnifying l.OUO diameters. This eyepiece is attached to the 
frame which carries the photographic plate, and is sasceptibk; of 
motion in two directions at right angles to each other. In the center 
of the eyepiece are two very iine cross hairs of spider wel) illuminated 
by a small incandescent lamp. If the observer notices that through 
some slight irregularity in the motion of the telescope, or through 
some change of refraction in the earth's atmosphere, the star image 
is moving away from the point of intersection of the cross hairs, 
he instantly brings it back b}' means of one or both of the screws. As 
the plate moves with the eyepiece it is evident that this method fur- 
nishes a meiuis of keeping the star images exactly at the same point 
on the plate throughout the entire exposure. With such apparatus 
certain data are gathered for the study of stellar development. 

It is easier to trace the successive steps in the development of a star 
after it has been formed than it is to account for its origin, but all the 
evidence that has ))een accunuUated up to the present time tends to 
show that stars are condensed out of the cloud-like masses whi<'h we 
know as nel)ulii'. Less than half a century has passed since the true 
nature of a gaseous n('l)ida was determined. In his extensive obser- 
vations of astronomical plieiioinena Sir William Herschel examined a 
great number of star clusters similar to that shown in Plate 1\'. His 
telescope was a large one, but it can safely be said that he nm cr saw a 
cluster so well as this object can be perceived through the aid of pho- 
tography, lie found in studying object aftei- o])ject in all parts of the 
heavens that many (lusters could be ivsolved into their constituent 
stars. In some of lliesc clusters the stars are widely sejiaraled by a 
powerful instrument, as (hey :i])pear in this photograph. In others,

either on aecount of tlieir or(»ater distance or heecUise thc^ stars are 
less widely spaced, the eentral reiij;ions are no lonoer dearly resolval)le 
as separate objects. It is thus ([uite possil)le to imaoiue a cluster in 
which the stars are so closely o-rou]X'd that no telescope, however 
powerful, could distinguish them separately. 

Now, as a matter of fact, we tind in all parts of the heavens lumin- 
ous objects which can i)ot l)e separated into stars. Some of these are 
of definite outline and are perfectly synmietiical in form, in many 
cases with a brilliant star-like nucleus at their center. These are 
knowni as the planetary ne])ula'. Other nebuhe, like the yi^nit nebula 
in Orion (PI. VI), are diffuse and irregular and extend over great 
regions of the sky. It was long a question whether such ol)jects were 
capable of resolution into stars with a sufficiently powerful telescope. 
Herschel rightly concluded that an impoi'tant distinction can be drawn 
between a nebula and a star cluster, though his son did not admit this 
distinction. 

It was only after Iluggins had applied the spectroscope to an analy- 
sis of the light of a nelnda that it could be said without danger of con- 
tradiction that the })henomenon is not one produced by the crowding 
together of separate stars, l)ut is due to the presence of a mass of incan- 
descent gas. Sir William lluggins's account of his first spectroscopic 
examination of a nebula is recorded in the first volume of the Publica- 
tions of the Tulse Hill OV)servatory : 

""On the evening of August 29, 18(i4, I directed the spectroscope for 
the first time to a planetary nebula in Draco. I looked into the spec- 
troscope. No spectrum such as I had expected! A single bright line 
only! At first 1 suspected some displacement of the prism and that I 
was looking at a reflection of the illuminat(Kl slit from one of its faces. 
This thought was scarcely more than momentary; then the true inter- 
pretation flashed upon me. The light of the nebula was monochro- 
matic, and so, unlike any other light 1 had as yet subjected to prismatic; 
examination, could not be extended out to form a complete; spectrum. 
After passing through the two prisms it remained concentrated into a 
single bright line, having a Avidth corresponding to the width of the 
slit, and occupying in the instrument a position at that part of the 
spectrum to which its light belongs in rcd'rangibility. A little closer 
looking showed two other bright lines on the side toward the blue, 
all three lines being s(»p;irated by intervals relatively dark. The riddle 
of the nebuhe was solved. The answer, which had come to us in the 
light itself, read: Not an aggregation of sfars, but a luminous gas.'' 

With this achance a new era of progi'css began. The power of the 
spectroscope^ to disfingnish between a glowing gas and a. mass of j)ar- 
tially condensed vapors like a star established it at onci; in its ])lace as 
the chief instrument of the student of st(dlar evolution. Jt became 
apparent that the unformed nebula might furnish flu; stulV from which 
stars are made. Obsei'vations tendinu" to this conclusion were not lonii"

in presentino- themselves. In the heart of the Orion nebula are four 
samll stars which constitute the well-known Trapezium, Situated as 
they are in the midst of this far-reachino- luass of g-as, it is not hard to 
picture them as centers of condensation, toward which the play of 
gravitational forces tends to concentrate the gases of the nebula. It 
might therefore be expected that stars in this early stage of growth" 
should show through the spectroscopic analysis of their light some 
evidence of relationship with the surrounding nebula. Now, this is 
precisel}" what the spectroscope has demonstrated. Mot only these 
stars, but man}" other stars in the constellation of Orion are shown by 
the spectroscope to contain the same gases which constitute the nebula. 
For this and other reasons they are considered to represent one of the 
earliest stages of stellar growth. 

It may ha many 3'ears before the exact nature of the process by 
'A'hich a star is formed from a nebulous mass is clearly understood. 
Shortly before his death the late Professor Keeler made a most impor- 
tant discovery in the course of his photographic work with the Crossley 
reflector of the Lick Observatory. Spiral nebula? have long been 
known, but it was not supposed that they were sufficiently numerous 
to be j-egarded as type ol)jects. The great spiral nebula illustrated 
b}^ one of Mr. Ritchey's recent reflector photographs (PI. VII) has long- 
been regarded as one of the most remarkable ol)jects in the heavens, and 
the possible significance of its form had b}" no means been overlooked. 
But few astronomers were prepared for Professor Keeler's announce- 
ment that the majority of nebuUe are of the spiral form and that many 
thousands of these objects are within the reach of such an instrument 
as the Crossle}^ reflector. It does not seem improbable that this spiral 
form may prove to represent the original condensing mass more truly 
than the lenticular form from which Laplace imagined the solar system 
to be evolved. 

Enough has already been said to indicate how large a part the 
methods of spectroscopj^ must play in the stud}' of the life history of 
stars. In spite of the common opinion that the spectroscope is an 
intricate instrument and that the principles of spectroscopy are obscure 
and difficult of comprehension, it is a fact that the processes used in 
this fleld of investigation can be easily understood by anyone who will 
devote a very small amount of time to the subject. As you dou])tless 
know, the essential feature of a star spectroscope is the prism or train 
of prisms by which the star light is divided into its constituent parts. 
After passing through the pi'isnis the light of the star is spread out 
into a long band, which shows all the colors of the rainbow, beginning 
with red at one end and passing through orange, yellow, green, and 
blue to violet at the other. This band is crossed by lines, and the 
problem of the spectroscoi)ist is to interpr<'t the lueaning of these lines.

If the lilies are dark he. knows that the lioht of the star after orioinat- 
\n<x in an interior incaudest'ent bod}' lias passed throiig-h a mass of 
cooler vapors, and that during- its transmission some of the light has 
suffered al)sorption. If, on the other hand, the lines are })right, he 
knows that the region wliere they are produced is hotter than that lying 
below. Thus a single glance at the spectrum of a star is suffici(Mit to 
give important information regarding the physical condition of its 
atmosphere. 

But the spectral lines are a])le to tell a far more complete story of 
stellar conditions. If their exact position in the spectrum can be 
measured it becomes possible to detei mine tlie chemical composition 
of the star's atmosphere. And here the spectroscopist may ])e said to 
have the advantage of the archeologist, in that the key to stidlar 
hieroglyphs is a master key. capal)le of interpreting not nierel}^ the 
language of a single people or a single age, but of laying l)are the 
secrets of the most distant portions of the universe and applying with 
e(iual force to the primitive and to the most highly developed forms of 
celestial phenomena. If we ttike a piece of iron wire and turn it into 
vapor in the intense heat of an electric arc lamp we tind that the light 
which the glowing iron vapor emits, when spread out into a spectrum 
b}'^ a prism, consists of a series of lines characteristically spaced and 
always occupying the same relative positions. In the same way every 
other element when transformed into vapor l)y a sufhciently intense 
heat emits characteristic radiations, consisting of groups of lines 
occupying definite positions in the spectrum. It is thus easy to see how 
the presence of iron vapor can be detected in the atmosphere of Sirius 
or in that of the sun. In the spectrum of each of these stars we find 
a group of lines occupying the same relative positions as the lines fur- 
nished by the iron vapor in an electric arc. Hydrogen gives an even 
more characteristic group of lines, which grow closer and closer together 
as we pass from the red end of the spectrum toward the violet. This 
group occurs in the spectra of thousands of stars and serves as an 
important guide in determining a star's place in a general scheme of 
stellar evolution. 

The practical means of carrying out this method of research may 
be illustrated by a reference to the stellar spectroscope employed with 
the 4()-inch Yerkes telescope. The spectroscope is rigidly attached to 
the lower end of the telescope tube. The image of a star formed by 
the 4U-inch lens passes into the spectroscope through a slit aliout one 
one-thousandth of an inch wide. After analysis by a train of three 
prisms an image of the resulting spectrum is formed liy a suitable lens 
upon a photographic plate. In making the photograph it is only 
necessar}^ to keep the image of a star exactly on the slit throughout 
the exposure, which may occupy from one minute to several hours, the 
duration dep3nding upon the brightness of the star. 



158 STELLAR EVOLUTION. 

We have seen tliat a single glance at the spectrum of a star is suffi- 
cient to give us important information as to the structure of its atmos- 
phere, while a study of the position of the lines tells what chemical 
elements are present. We might go on to consider how the width and 
sharpness of the lines, together w^ith shifts in their position toward the 
]'ed end of the spectrum, furnish the means of estimating the density 
of the vapors and the pressure to which the}" are subjected. The rela- 
tive intensities of certain lines also serve as a clew to the temperature. 
Thus in the spectrum of magnesium there is a pair of lines, one of 
which is the stronger at the temperature of the electric spark, while 
the other is the stronger at the lower temperature of the electric arc. 
In the spectra of certain stars the greater intensity of the first line 
may indicate that the temperature is high and approximates that of the 
electric spark, while in other stars the relative intensities are reversed, 
suggesting that the temperature is lower and corresponds more closely 
with that of the electric arc. In addition to all this, certain easily 
measureable changes in the position of the spectral lines are known 
from Doppler's principle to indicate motion of the star in the direction 
of the earth. Thus, if the lines are shifted toward the red with refer- 
ence to their normal position, and if we haA^e evidence that the shift is 
not due to pressure, we may conclude that the distance between the 
earth and the star is increasing, while if the lines are shifted toward 
the violet we conclude that the distance betw een the earth and the star 
is decreasing. As the earth's motion is known, the velocity of the star 
in the line of sight can therefore be accurately determined. 

After this glance at the methods employed by the spectroscopist, we 
may return to a further consideration of the stages of stellar evolution. 
We have seen that the long-continued action of gravity tends to pro- 
duce condensation of a cosmical cloud. The constellation of Orion 
contains many examples of stars in this early stage of development. 
As the mass condenses its temperature rises, and corresponding with 
this rise in temperature and in the density of the vapors which consti- 
tute the star we find characteristic changes in the spectrum and also in 
the star's color. Such a brilliant white or bluish-white star as Sirius 
or Vega may be taken as representative of the next stage of stellar 
development. Here the broad bands of hydrogen, which constitute a 
beautiful series expressible by a simple mathematical formula, serve 
as the chief mark of distinction. The conditions are not 3^et ripe for 
the marked development of metallic lines, though doubtless the numer- 
erous eUmKMits which constitute the sun, and which for the most part 
are familiar to us on the earth, are present in such stars, though they 
are not revealed through a study of the spectrum. It is true that evi- 
dence exists of the presence of iron and a few other su])stances. ])ut 
the lines are thin and few in number, and might be overlooked in a 
casual examination of the spectrum. The period for their greatest 
development has not yet arrived. The light gas hydrogen, reaching 



STELLAR EVOH'TION. 15',) 

far al)ovc the wliitc-Jiot mass of condeiised vapors which (•onstitute 
the iniclens of tlie star, is at this stage the predominant (denuMit, at 
least so far as we may jvldge from a study of the light radiation. 

An interesting question has arisen regarding the period in a star's 
life at which the highest temperature is attained. The appai'ently 
paradoxical statement of Lane's law that the temperature of a cooling 
mass of incandescent vapors, instead of falling, actually increases until 
a certain stage has passed, applies in the present instance. We, indeed, 
know that a condensing nel^ula, losing heat by radiation into space, will 
continue to rise in temperature for thousands and even millions of 
years. A question which has received some discussion of late is with 
regard to the precise period at which the maximum ttMuperature occurs. 
Shall we seek it in white stars like Sirius or in yellow stars like the 
sun, which i-epresents the next well-dehned stage of stellar evolu- 
tion 'i Witli an instrument of extraordinary' delicacy Professor Nichols 
has recently measured at the Yerkes Observatory the amount of lieat 
which we receive from Vega and Arctui'us. Tho distance of these 
stars is so inconceivably great that the quantity of heat which they 
send to the surface of the earth has hitherto been too small to be 
detected by the most sensitive instruments. Professor Nichols's radi- 
ometer, which, in coml)ination with a large concave mirror, renders it 
easy to measure the heat radiated from a man's face 2,000 feet away, 
pro\ed adequate for the task. He found that Arcturus sends us about 
as nuich heat as we should get from a candle (3 miles away if there were 
no intervening atmosphere to reduce the candle's intensity. Vega, which 
to the eye is precisely equal to Arcturus in l)rightness, was found to 
send us only half as nuicli heat. If the absorbing atmospheres of 
Arcturus and Vega were similar in character, it would follow, from 
Professor Nichols's results, that Vega, though it sends us less heat, is 
really the hotter of the two stars. For we know from laboratory 
experiments that the proportion of long (heat) waves to short (light) 
waves is greater in the radiation of the cooler of two bodies heated to 
incandescence. In this case the fact that Arcturus sends the greater 
amount of heat would be ascribed rather to greater size than to lesser 
distance, as there is good reason to l)elieve that it is farther from us 
than Vega. 

But unfortunatidy the dissimilarity of the atmospheres of th(^ two 
stars renders it unc(M'tain whether such conclusions can safely be drawn. 
This is particularly true in view of the fact that Sir William Huggins 
concludes from his spectroscopic studies that the highest stage of stellar 
temperature is reached in stars likc^ Arcturus aud the sun, while stars 
like Vega are still in an earlicn- and less highly h(>ated condition. 

While some uncertainty nuist therefore pi-evail until furtluM- investi- 
gations have been conqileted I'egarding the (^xact stage at which the 
highest stellar temperatur(>s are attained, there can be little doubt as 



IGU STELLAR EVOLUTION. 

to the path which iis followed when through the long continued action 
of gTa\dtation a young star like Vega develops into a star like the sun. 
We are fortunate in possessing examples of a great nuni])cr of inter- 
mediate stages in this orderly progress (PI. VIII, fig. 1). As condensa- 
tion continues, and as the vapors which constitute the star continue to 
crowd upon each other, the stellar nucleus becomes denser and denser 
and the vast atmosphere of h^^drogen gradually gives place to a nuich 
shallower atmosphere, in which h3'drogen is still conspicuous, though 
it no longer predominates in a very striking manner over the other 
elements. The spectral lines of such elements as iron, magnesium, 
sodium, and calcium, rise into prominence as the hj^drogen lines fade. 
Meanwhile the light of the star undergoes a change of color, com- 
pletely losing its bluish cast and assuming a distinct!}" j^ellow hue. 
There can be little if any doubt that the development of our own ,sun 
must cause it to pass through some such stages as are represented l)y 
the spectra shown in PI. VIII, tig. 1. The time which has elapsed 
since it acquired its present size and density as the result of the con- 
densation of the great nebula in which the earth and the other planets 
also had their origin, covers mau}^ millions of j^ears. It is fortunate 
for the study of stellar evolution that the stages through which the 
sun once passed are all exemplified in existing stars, which for unknown 
reasons began their stellar life at widely different times. 

It will be profitable to consider for a moment some of the remark- 
able phenomena which are presented to us by the sun, not only because 
of their intrinsic interest, but also because it is perfecth^ safe to assume 
that similar phenomena, sometimes on a much greater scale, would be 
presented by other stars, were they not at so great a distance from the 
earth as to reduce them to mere points of light, even in the most power- 
ful telescope. The sun has a diameter of 860,000 miles and, as its dis- 
tance from the earth is onl}" 93,000,000 miles, an extremely small frac- 
tion of the distance of the other stars, it is possible to observe and to 
study in detail its extraordinary phenomena, which are incomparably 
more violent than anything observed on the earth. When we sjjcak of 
the sun w^e speak collectively of a great number of phenomena, some 
of which extend for millions of miles from the sun's visible disk. Chief 
of these is the corona, a vast filmy atmosphere so rare that it offers 
little or no resistance to the passage of a comet, as it sweeps around the 
sun under the action of gravitation and returns into the space from 
which it came. The polar streamers of the corona (PI. VIII, fig. 2) sug- 
gests the action of magnetic forces and offer material for long continued 
study of this, the most mysterious of all the solar appendages. At the 
base of the corona, rising out of a sea of Hanie Avhich coniph^el}' 
encircles the sun, are tiie prominences, some of which occasionally 
attain a height of nearly 400, 0()(» miles. Like the corona, the promi- 
nences are hidden ))y the brilliant iiluniiuation of our own atmospherCj

and are visihlc to tlu' nuked eye only when the diiHH't llu'Iit of the sun's 
di.sk is cut ott' l)y the intm-position of the moon at a total eclipst\ But 
methods have been devised by which tbey can be observed or photo- 
graphed on any clear day through the agency of a modified form of 
spectroscope. The prominences are constantly changing in form, 
sometimes slowly, as in the case of this group (PI. IX. tig. 1), a photo- 
graph of which, taken at the eclipse of May 28, 11 loo, by the astronomer 
royal of England in Spain, is shown for comparison with the photo- 
graph taken about two hours earlier l)v the Yerkes Observatory party 
in North C'arolina. Here the change in the foim of the mass of gas 
which constitutes the prominence is comparatively small, but that 
violent forces are sometimes at work nuw be illustrated by photographs 
of an eruptive prominence tak(>n at the Kenwood Obsei'vatory in 1895 
(PI. IX, fig, 2). At the moment when the first photograph was made 
the prominence had attained a height of 1(>0,000 miles and was rising 
rapidl}. Eighteen minutes later another picture was taken; during 
the interval the prominence hadl)een going upward at the rate of 6,000 
miles a mimite, and when the exposure was made it had reached an 
elevation of 280,000 miles. When looked for a few minutes later it 
had completely disappeared. 

The constitution of the chromosphere, the sea of flame some lo,000 
miles deep from which the prominences rise, increases in complexity 
as the surface of the solar disk is approached. In its upper part only 
the vapor of calcium and the light gases, hydrogen and helium, are 
found. But in proceedi ng downward the vapors of magnesium, sodiinn, 
iron, chromium, and last of all, carbon, are successively encountt'red. 
At this ])artof the solar atmosphere the dark lines of the solar spectrum 
take their rise through the effect of absorption. 

Time does not permit a detailed description of the phenomena of the 
sun's disk. When photographed with an instrument which excludes 
from the sensitive plate all light except that Avhich is characteristic of 
the vapor of calcium, its surface is found to be dotted over with exten- 
sive luminous regions. Associated with these are the sun spots, the 
minute study of which has revealed some strikingly beautiful phenom- 
ena, which have been most successfully drawn by Langley. The 
surface of the sun in the regions devoid of spots is show n by the pho- 
tographs of Janssen to consist of brilliant granules separated b}" darker 
spaces. Much might l)e said of the peculiar law of rotation of the 
sun, which causes a point near the e((uator to complete an axial rota- 
tion in much less time than a point nearer the poles. Much might 
also be said of the periodicity of sun spots, which at times are very 
numerous and again, as at present, are absent from the sun's disk for 
weeks together. But enough has already been told to indicate some 
of the chief eharacteristics of this central star of the solar system, 

SM 1902—11 



1B2 STELLAR KVOLITTION. 

which has thou.stinds of counterparts juiioiig" other stars of the same 
spectral class. 

We are now approaching the last chapters in the life history of a 
star. After the solar stag-e has passed the color changes from yellow 
to orange, and subsequentl}' to red, as the temperature falls, 'riie 
spectral lines of hydrogen become fainter and fainter and finally dis- 
ajopear completely. The lines of the metallic elements, on the con- 
trary, become more and more complex and the changes in their 
relative intensities are those which arc characteristic of lower temper- 
atures. But curiously enough, there are two well-detined classes of 
these older stars, which until recently were not known to have any 
points in common except their red color. These are the stars of 
Secchi's third and fourth types. In general appearance their spectra 
are whollj^ unlike, particularly on account of the absertce from third- 
class spectra of the broad dark bands due to the a]:)Sorption of carbon 
vapor, the most characteristic feature of the fourth t3'pG. But in 
spite of this apparent dissimilarit}^, photographs recentl}- taken with 
the •iO-inch Yerkes telescope show that in certain regions of the spec- 
trum stars of the two types are practicall}^ identical and are thus 
probably more closely related than formerly appeared to be the case. 
The measurements and reductions of a long series of photographs of 
fourth-type spectra now in progress at the Yerkes Observatory should 
soon permit us to form an opinion of the nature of these interesting 
stars. 

In both the third and fourth types it is easy to trace the successive 
stages of development. In stars of the fourth type the signs of increas- 
ing age are particularly striking. The carbon vapor which produces 
the broad dark bands becom(\s denser and denser, until it is not ditii- 
cult to imagine that through the further increase of such absorption 
the light of the star might be almost completely extinguished (PI. X). 

The phenomena of the red stars indicate that this final stage is close 
at hand, and curiousl}" enough, in further testimon}^ of the remarkable 
power of the spectroscope, the total extinction of a star's light does 
not always prove sufficient to place that star beyond the reach of this 
instrument. It is true that the spectroscope can not reveal the cheniical 
composition of a solid body which is devoid of intrinsic light, but such 
a body may form a system with another object which is still luminous, 
and its gravitational power may cause the luminous I)ody to move in 
an orbit. As we have already seen, the spiM-troscope is ca[)able of 
revealing the motions of such a body. From a knowledge of thes(» 
motions and Ihe time in \vhich the revolution is effected it is possible 
to det(M"mine the mass and dinKMisions of the system, and in some spe- 
cial cases, like that of Algol, the diameter and density of the invisible 
component of" the pair.

We must look to tlio >u^)lar system for exampk's of stars in the last 
stage of development. Each of t\w planets may, in fact, he regarded 
as an object of this kind. Jhc bare and rocky surface of the moon 
affords a desolate pictui-e of what may result from this long-continued 
process of condensation. The volcanic region, which is shown to 
excellent advantage in a photograph recently taken with the Yerkes 
telescope (Fl. XI), gives no evidence of the existence of life; in fact, 
the spectroscope indicates that if there is any air on the moon it is 
much too rare to support life as we know it. 

Fortunately, the moon is not the only example of a worn-out star. 
The earth, which probably has many counterparts in the universe, is 
another example of a less desolate kind. Here, though the process 
of condensation which is the chief cause of celestial phenomena has 
ceased, the problem of evolution has not ended. In fact, though the 
cosmical problems which we have considered in their barest elements 
will not be completely solved for centuries, it may be truly said that 
the questions raised by the countless living organisms in a single drop 
of ditch water are still more complex and will require a still longer 
time for their solution. 



A NEW SOLAR 'PITKOKY."

Jioi/dl OliHcrnUoi'i/, I'jJiHhiin/li. '' 



It i.s a r(.Miiaiktit)k' fact that in the numerous theories wliieli have 
been propounded in explanation of the periodic changes of the sohir 
])henoniena no account has yet been taken of so important an ehMuent 
as the light and heat absorbing- envelope surrounding the photosphere. 
The attention which this so-called solar atmosphere has hitherto 
received, on the part even of our most eminent in^•estig■ators, in con- 
nection with the econom}" of radiant enei'gv on our luminary, is utterly 
disproportionate to the importance of the suljject. In spite of the fact, 
which was first accurately estal)]ished by Langley's oliservations and 
was afterwards confirmed by others, that the sun, if deprived suddenly 
of this protecting screen would radiate into space as much as double 
its present amount of energy, solar physicists failed to perciMve that 
changes in the absorptive power of this envelope must entail conse- 
quences of the most far-reaching chiiracter with respect to the thermal 
conditions on and in the sun. That such changes — and these, too, of 
no inconsideral)le magnitude — must inevitabh^ occur, is a conclusion 
which it is hardly possi})le to evade when it is rememliered that the 
supreme control over the dispensation of solar energy depends entirely 
on a thin, shallow surface layer, the matter of which is constantly 
tossed about by vehement eruptions and acted upon ])y a most com- 
plicated and pow^erful system of convection currents to and fi-oni the 
sun's center. 

The possil)ility of variations of the opacity of the solar atmosphere 
was, it is true, strongl}- urged, more than twenty years ago, by one 
of the greatest authorities on this ([uestion. Shoi-tly aft(>r his well- 
known res(>arches into the a})sorbing faculty of tiie solar envelope, 
Langley pointed out the decisive inilnence on the sun's I'adiation into

166 A NEW SOLAR THEORY. 

But his attention was at the time solel}' directed toward their proba- 
ble effects on the temperature of our own planet. He found that an 
increase of absorption by as much as 25 per cent would diminish the 
mean surface temperature of our globe by 100^ F.. while a like 
diminution in the solar envelope would produce a corresponding 
change in the opposite direction. 

Now, if the influence of a change in the a])sorptiYe power of the 
solar atmosphere is so enormous on a planet at a distance of almost a 
hundred million of miles, of what inconceivable importance must it 
not be for the sun itself? Drawing the very natural inference that a 
deficit of outside radiation means a surplus of energies working upon 
the solar matter, and vice versa, we are forcibl}^ led to conclude that 
even slight changes of opacity, such as would elude our must refined 
observations, are bound to greatly influence the state of thermal equi- 
librium on our luminary. 

Hence, if changes in the absorptive power of the sun's atmosphere 
exist, as can not but be the case, the question presents itself: What 
happens with those energies which, by a condensation of the solar 
envelope, are prevented from escaping into space? No doul)t the}^ 
are preserved to the sun, but in what form? Do they raise the tem- 
perature of the solar mass, or augment its store of potential energy, 
or have the}' a share in the generation of those marvelous dynamical 
displays which we perceive in periodic succession on the solar surface? 
Questions such as these must tend to convince the investigator that a 
research into the causes of the variability of the forces which we see 
acting on the sun, if not identical with, is at least ciosely akin to, the 
investigation of the origin and the physical properties of the sun's 
atmosphere. 1 shall endeavor in these colunms to demonstrate the 
possibilit}" of such changes in the densit}' of the solar envelope as 
would lead to alterations of the thermal conditions of the sun's mass, 
and shall make an attempt to answer the (juestion as to how far these 
changes nuist be conducive to variations in the dynamical phenomena 
at the sun's surface. 

There is perfect unanimity among astronomers as regards the 
nature of the force which, by a continuous generation of heat, com- 
pensates for the loss of energy into space. Helmholtz's theory, which 
attri})utes this heat generation to the progressive contraction of the 
solar mass as a consequence of gravitation, may be regarded as one of 
the most probable hypotheses ever propounded in the history of 
physical science. But this theory does not yet enable us to form an 
idea of the evolution of a celestial body. It explains the existence of 
a heat-generating force within the star's bulk, but it gives no answer 
to the (jucstion as to Avhether the loss of energy bj' radiation is exactly 
com])ensated for by the generation of energy through contraction, or 
whether th(> conditions of contraction peculiar to the sun may not

pci'hap.s produce iiiore ot less heat than is i-ecpiired for compensation. 
It is, indeed, inconeeiV-able that the conditions of contraction can 
remain tlie same throughout the lifetime of a star. The spectroscope 
has revealed the fact that the photospheres of diHerent stars exhibit 
widely different stages as regards temperature. Ther(^ are doubtless 
suns hotter than ours, and others considerably cooler. And we may 
confidently assume that the various conditions of temperature now 
recognized in the different types of star-specti'a represent the i)ha8es 
which successively apjx'ar in the evolution of each of these bodies from 
its orioin as a far-extended nebula down to its complete obscuration. 
In the life of each of these stars there will be a period when its tem- 
perature is on the ascent, and when, consequently, the heat-generating 
effect of the contractile force exceeds the loss by outward radiation, 
as well as another period when the declining temperature of the star 
indicates an excess of the heat-dissipating over the heat-producing 
forces. Which of these conditions, at the present moment, prevails 
on our sun can so far be only ;i matter of conjecture. In this respect, 
therefore, an assumption has to be made. The following inquiry 
applies to the case of a star on which the generation of energy by con- 
traction falls short of the loss of energy l)v radiation. Whether the 
results of this investigation may be applied to the case of our sun 
must, then, depend on the further question whether the sun really 
belongs to those stars the temperature of which is declining. So far 
as I know, this latter opinion is at present held by the great majority

If on a star the loss of energy exceeds the production, the kinetic 
energv of its molecules, and consequently its absolute temi)erature, 
must decrease. Hence if the temperature of a layer, ^/,,, at a certain 
distance, p,,. from the center was Tj at the epoch Z^, it will be T^ at a 
later epoch 4, where T2<Ti. Now let a^ bo the level of the photo- 
sphere — or the level of maximum incandescence, and therefore also 
of maximum radiation — at the e})Och f^. In consequence of deficient 
contraction the temperature of this layer must decrease, and the mate- 
rials composing it must cool down, so that, at the subsequent epoch 
4, the level of maximum incandescence will have shifted toward a 
layer m., nearer to the star's center, where the temperature is still 
sufficiently high to maintain the incandescent state of all the particles. 
The space between a^ and cl, will then be occupied by particles in a 
less luminous state which act as an absorbing screen on the radiation 
emanating from a.,. Whatever fraction of the total radiation which 
originally left the photosphere at a„ is thus stopped in its outward 
progress will be in part absorbed bv, and in part reflected from, the 
intervening particles of the layer a^d.^, and there can be no doubt that 
some at least of this arrested energv will ultimatel}^ be thrown back 
to r<.^ from which it started. The layer a^a., must therefoic act on the

photospheric radiation in tho same way as do our atmosphere and its 
clouds on the radiation from the soil. We are (juite familial" with tlie 
fact that clear nights are, as a rule, cooler than cloud}" ones, and we 
explain this phenomenon 1)y the assumption that on clear nights radia- 
tion from the soil into space goes on more freely than when clouds 
offer an effective impediment to the dissipation of radiant energy. 

We conclude, then, that the progressive cooling of the star leads to 
the formation of an absorbing envelope above its photosphere, by 
which the disproportion ])etween the generatio'n and loss of energy is 
reduced. But if, under the conditions at the epoch /,, the amount of 
energy actually radiated into space still exceeds what is produced by 
contraction, the photosphere will move to a^, still nearer to the centre, 
and the quantity of al)sorbing matter in the layer <i^a.^ will be further 
increased. Now, although a.^ enuts the same quantity of energy as did 
f/^ and <i^ at the former epochs, the total amount of radiation emerging 
into space must, at the epoch f.^^ be less than it was at t, and t^. Thus 
the opacity of the cooled atmosphere gradually increases as time goes 
on, and the total radiation of the star l)ecomes less and less. Since no 
force is present to interfere with the cooling of the layers a^^ a., . . . , 
a moment t,^ must eventually be reached at which the photosphere at 
r/^^, through reflection from all the hwers above it, receives back so 
much of its radiation that its total expenditure of energy is exactly 
counterbalanced by the energ}' contributed by the contractile forces. 

This result appears to be of eminent importance, for it shows that 
even on a star with deficient contraction the exact compensation of the 
loss of energy ma}" still be possi])le from a certain layer downward. 
This state, so exceedingly important for the conservation of energy 
within the star, is brought al)out by the progressive cooling of its 
superlicial layers, which thereb}" increase their power of absorption, 
and thus offer a more and more effective check to the radiation from 
the incandescent layers below. 

Here, now. we are confronted with a question which leads us at 
once to tiie principal o])ject of this in((uiry: Can the state of thermal 
e([uilihriiun thus eventually attained l)y the layer a^, be permanent^ 
Th(^ answer is clearly negati\'e. For when a^, has arrived at this state, 
none of the layers «j, a,^ . . . a^^.^ outside (t,, have reaclnMl tlu^ same 
condition. Th(>ir cooling is bound to go on, and consecpuMitly their 
al)ility to absorb and reflect the heat emanating from the laycnw/^^ nnist 
still fui'ther increase ev(Mi after the establishnuMit of th(M'mal e(|uili- 
brium at (/,,. Hut, owing to this increasing amount of reflection 
toward it, the layer a^-^ will now dissipate e^ (>n less energy than is 
requii'ed for the maintenance of thermal e(iuilibriuni, and therefore 
nuist ])ecome overheated. It thus comes to pass that, while the func- 
tion of the a])s()r])ing envelope is that of reducing as much as possible 
the waste of imergv from the photosi)hei'ic layers, it is, by the very 



A NEW SOLAR THKORY. 1(')9 

iiaturo of this process, couipollcd to overdo its work, and lo })resoi'vc 
tiiiiilly too imicli eneriiv within. the star. 

Now, l)y this gradual overheatiiiu' of th(^ inner hiyers t\w vertical 
teniperature-gradient iiiiist increase more and more, until it reaches a 
deg-ree of steepness at which the permanence of a mechanical equilib- 
rium l)ecomes impossil)le. In such a case the overheated gaseous 
matt( !• will force its wayoutward and will break through the "'cloak'''' 
of absorbing elements above it. lUit th(> overheated matter will not at 
once obey its molecular impulse to escape^ into higher levels. We 
nuist remember thiit there exists a powerful system of convection cur- 
rents between the interior and the surface of the sun. and that the 
overheated particles may for some time lie swept along the paths of 
these currents and may thus be forcibly detained in levels inconsistent 
with their increased temperature, so that their state of equilibrium is 
rendered unstable. This will produce a tension which increases in 
course of time until the upward tendency of the overheated particles 
l)ecomes strong enough to overcome the resistance of the currents. 
At such a critical moment even a slight disturbance will be sufficient 
to induce the upward motion so long restrained, thus giving rise to a 
solar eruption. The cause of a solar outburst is therefore to be found 
in the temporar}' existence of an excessively great vertical tempera- 
ture-gradient, caused V)v progressive cooling of the outer atmospheric 
layers and the ensuing overheating of the inner photospheric layers. 

From this exceedingly simple principle we are able to deduce an 
analytical demonstration of the periodicity of solar phenomena, which 
explains all the characteristics of the sun-spot curve hitherto obs(n'ved. 
Obviously, the problem consists in demonstrating the changes in the 
amount of outward radiation which are caused, oti the one hand, 1)y 
the increase of absorpti\e power of the atmosphere in conse(iuenc(^ of 
its progressive cooling, and, on the other, b}^ the reduction of al)sorp- 
ti\-e power of this same atmosphere in consequence of the "clarifying''"' 
action of eru])tions which, b}' lireaking through the "veil,'' diminish 
the munher of cooled absorbing elements at the localities of einiption. 
I shall not enter upon this part of my investigation in the present note 
beyond stating that it is a simple application of Ikniguer-Lambert's 
fonnula for the (extinction of light and heat in an a))S()rbing mcMlium. 
The energy -S* of the radiation leaving the u])pei' linnt of the atmos 
phere is found hy the differential e({uation 

where t denotes the time reckoned from the moment when the i)hol()-

A NEW SOLAR THEOEY. 



The integ-ral of this e({uatioii will thus give us the changes in the radiat- 
ing- power of the sun toward a point in the universe. Considering that 
the intensity of the dynamical phenomena at the solar surface must 
depend on the excess of energy preserved to the sun beyond what he 
requires for the maintenance of thermal equilibrium at r/,,, we arrive at 
the following theoretical equation for the frequency of eruptions and 
spots : 

where ^> is the period and 



/\i = —\a-\- x/i^"^ + aft 
\ — — h:Oc — y/\a^ -\- afS 

It is readily seen that /• starts froiu zero at the moment t=o^ and that 
it reverts to zero at the moment t=2^- Between these two moments ;' 
attains a maximum, and we find the time when this occurs from the 
equation.

Now, it can be shown that the right-hand side of this equation is 
under all conditions <.e''-'''^~^-^~_, and this the more so the greater the 
difference between \{' and A/. Hence we deduce 2^„i<i_/^/ i. e. , the 
ascent from zero to the maximum must take place in an interval of 
time shorter than half the period. This constitutes the first theoret- 
ical proof of the well-known property of the observed spot-curve that 
the ascent is steeper than the descent.

be made to represent the observed facts, 1 sul)join a plate (iig. 1) in

A NEW SOLAR THEORY. l7l 

The theory also accoqjits satisfactorily for the existence of a "great" 
period of solar phenouiena. , This greater cycle is brought about by 
the influence of the • surface fluctuations of temperature described 
above on the intensity of the convection currents which regulate the 
interchange of ht^at between the intmior and the surface. It is incon- 
ceival)le that in a gaseous body lik(» the sun, governed ))y a gigantic 
convection, changes o-f temperature of parts of its mass can be con- 
hned merely to the surface. Hence we nuist conclude that the distri- 
bution of temperature throughout a considei'able part of the sun's 
bulk will l)e more or less affected l)y the fluctuations of temperature 
at the surface, and that, consequently, the intensity of the S3\stem of 
convection currents, which depend on this distribution of temperature, 
must undergo variations similar to those exhibited l)y the dynamical 
phenomena at the surface. Now these variations must react on the 
development of eruptions and spots. If the currents are weak — viz, 
if the transfer of heat from the interior to the surface^ is comparatively 
small — the cooling of the atmosphere must proceed ra})idly, and hence 
the development of eruptions, which are a direct consequence of this 
process of cooling, nmst lie energetic. At such times w^e have, there- 
fore, to expect solar c3a'les with a powerfiil display of dynamical phe- 
nomena. If, on the otlier hand, the currents are intense — viz, if the 
heat supply from the interior is vigorous — the rate of atmospheric 
cooling will be small, and we have then to expect cycles with only a 
weak development of surface phenomena. 

Since the quantity ^r depends on the rate of cooling of the atmos- 
pheric la3a^rs, it will attain high values at times when the spot develop- 
ment is powerful, and vice Aersa. Now, the greater (v the greater will 
be the dift'erence Ix^tween A^" and A.^-, and, conse({uently. the earlier 
must the time of maximum, ?',^,, occur. Hence the position of the max- 
imum in the spot period relatively to the preceding miniuium must 
depend on the greater or less vigor of spot development during the 
cycle, inasmuch as the time of maxinnun nuist be the more in advance 
of the center of the period the greater the disph\y of tlie dynamical 
phenomena. This important conclusion, arrived at by purel>" theoret- 
ical considerations, is amply corro))orated ])y the facts. I refer in 
this respect to a recent pul)lication of Dr. W. Lockyer, in which this 
peculiar shift of the maximum is pointed out as a feature of the 
olxserved spot curves. 

Professor Wolfer. of Zurich, in the Monthly Weather lieview of 
April. 19(l!^. has also veriticd this peculiar th(M)retical I'csult l)y a 
thorough discussion of the sun-spot observations from 174i> to liM)l. 
"Only one result,'*' he says, "which Dr. Lockyei- has bi-ought out is 
certain, and one which was also (((Muoiistrated by Dr. Halm, both from 
the ohsei'ved facts and as a c()nse(iuen(;e of his now theory of the 
periodicit}" of the solar phenomena, namel}', '^^ * * that a maximum 



172 A NEW SOLAR THEORY. 

follows a ininiinum quicker in proportion as the maximum is higher. 
* * ■"' That the interval between minima and maximsi depends inti- 
mately upon the intensity of development of the spots during that 
period would seem, therefore, to ])0 quite certain, according to Lock- 
yer's and Halm's investigations.''' 

In this connection another interesting consequence of the theory 
may be mentioned. The above expression for v, as already pointed 
out, shows that the theoretical spot-curve, after having passed 
through a maximum, returns to zero when t=p. At this moment the 
status quo ante appears to be reestablished, inasmuch as the photo- 
spheric layers, by the assistance of atmospheric reflection, once more 
receive an exact compensation for their loss of energy sustained by 
outward radiation. If the oj^acity of the absorption la3^ers above tlie 
photosphere could henceforth be supposed to remain constant, a repe- 
tition of spot-activity would l)e impossible. But since the cooling of 
these absorptive layers, l)eing the necessary consequence of deficient 
contraction, is bound to proceed, it must eventuall}^ lead to a new 
sequence of phenomena similar to those of the previous cycle. The 
principal condition for the initiation of a new spot cycle must there- 
fore be sought in the rate of cooling of the outer atmosphere at the 
moment of the reestablishment of thermal equilibrium in the photo- 
spheric layers. If the cooling proceeds rapidly the overheating of the 
inner layers will be indicated by a comparatively early renascence of 
eruptive activity. If, on the contrary, the cooling progresses slowly 
a more considerable interval of time will elapse ])efore the state of 
unstable equilibrium favorable to the formation of new eruptions 
and spots can make its appearance. In the first case the mininuuu 
will ])e of short duration and the cycles will follow each other in rapid 
succession, whereas in the second case the minimum will appear pro- 
tracted and the distance 1)etween consecutive cycles lengthened. In 
other words, the length of the period must depend on the rate of cool- 
ing of the atmospheric layers. Hence, from what has been said above, 
it nuist also vary with the intensity of spot development. Cycles 
exhibiting excessive spot activity must have less extended minima 
and must therefore be of shorter duration than others distinguished 
by a feel)le display of dynamical activity. This consequence of the 
theory, too, appears to be contiraied by the observations. Thus the 
mean length of period of the cycles 1 7(56. 5 — 1775.5 — 1781. 7 and 1833.9 — 
1813.5, during which the display of spots was far above the average, 
em])raccs not more than 9.3 years, while the feebl}^ developed cycles 
1781.7 — 1798.3 — 1810.6 show a mean period of no less than 13.0 j^ears. 

The object of this brief abstract l>eing mereh" an exposition of the 
main principles upon which I have ventured to build a new solar 
theory, I shall not entcM' upon its various applications to the phenomena 
coimected with the pei-iodic changes in the display of forces at the

,sutr,s .surface. In this rt'8})ect tli(^ theory will l)e submitted to an 
exhaustive test in ui.v pTiper in the Annals. In one important point it 
involves a radical deviation from the views hitherto held. So far 
investigators have almost unanimously adhered to the traditionaUiew 
that an increase in the dynamical forces at the sun\s surface indicates 
at the same time an augmentation of his light and lieat radiation into 
the universe. A theory founded on this assumption would ha\'c to 
account not only for the extra expenditure of force into s])ace. but 
also for the simultaneous increased development of force in the sun. 
But in the theory here proposed the exactl}' opposite conclusion is 
arrived at. Here the forces which we see acting on the sun are called 
into existence hy the accunuilation of such parts of his radiating energy 
as have been prevented from being thrown oti' into the universe. Thus, 
a surplus of energy working on the sun means a deficit of energy com- 
municated to space. 

It will be important, then, to ascertain how far this conclusion can 
be verified b}' observed facts. Modern researches seem, indeed, to

corrol)orate this theoretical result. If the theor\ ))e true, the tem- 
})eratui'eof the solar layers inside the al)sor)>ing atmospliere should be 
higher at the maxima than at the minima of solar activity, while the 
temperature of a bod}" in space, which receives its heat from the sun, 
should vaiy inversely. In proof of the first conclusion I may refer to 
Sir Norman Lockyer's results with regard to the beha\ior of the lines 
widened in the spectra of sun spots, from which he infers that the 
luatter composing the spots unist be of higher temperature at the 
times of maxima. The second conclusion, on the other hand, is cor- 
roborated ])y all the more important researches which have recinitly 
been made regarding a connection b(>tween the changes of terrestrial 
temperature and solar activity. Of some of these I subjoin the main 
results in tigure 2, which exhibits the ()bserv(>d changes in the mean 
annual temperature at tropical and subtropical stations and the corre- 
sponding variations of solar activity. It will ))e seen that for the whole 
period from 1821 until 18*,)S the temyjerature curve follows most accu- 
rately the fluctuations of the inverted spot curve, thus so far proving 



174 A NEW SOLAR THEORY. 

the validity of the second conclusion, that space receives less heat at 
the maxima that at the minima of solar activity. 

The solar theory here advanced is based on the assumption that the 
sun is a "coolinj>-" star, viz, that his contractile force is not sufficient 
to compensate for his loss of energy b}" radiation. Now strong reasons 
can be adduced in favor of the assertion that the sun's mass must be 
mainly gaseous. But it has been urged by astronomers whose opinion 
on this point may claim earnest consideration, that, in accordance with 
a well-known theorem first enunciated by Lane, the temperature of a 
gaseous body should rise through shrinkage. The assumption here 
advocated would therefore appear to be in opposition to Lane's law. 
It must be borne in mind, however, that Lane's theorem supposes the 
conditions of a perfect gas. The question then arises as to whether 
this perfect state can be assumed to exist in the gaseous bulk of the 
celestial bodies. To make the question clearl}' intelligible, I shall first 
have to point out the main difference between the so-called perfect 
gaseous state and the gaseous state as we actually observe it. On this 
point 1 ((uote a few passages from Professor Andrews's important 
treatise in the Philosophical Transactions for 1876, Part II, pages 
448-41* >: 

1. In the ideal, or, as it is eominonly called, the perfect gaseous state matter would 
obey implicitly the external forces which act upon it, the vokime being always 
inversely as the forces externally applied. In this state it would neither offer resist- 
ance to volume « nor, from the action of internal attractive forces, would it undergo 
a greater diminution of volume than that due to the external pressure. 

2. In the gaseous state, as we observe it, there are. two distinct causes of internal 
disturbance whose results are directly opposed, and, according to the nature of the 

gas and the conditions of pressure and temperature, sometimes the one and some- 
times the other predominates. One of these disturbances is due to the action of 
internal forces tending to jiroduce a diminution of volume; the other is due to 
molecular conditions jiroducing a resistance to diminution of volume other than that 
which occurs in a perfect gas. 

We have, then, to consider three possible conditions: Either the 
gases in the sun are in that ideal state mentioned under (1), which is 
characterized ])y the rigorous fulfillment of Boyle's law: or {<() the 
molecules attract each other and thereby enhance the diminution of 
volume under increasing pressure; or (h) the molecules repel each 
other and thereby counteract the diminution of volume. Now, with 
regard to the attractive molecular forces, the researches of Clausius, 
van der Waals, and man}^ other physicists, have shown conclusivel}^ 
that they diminish with increasing temperature. At ordinary tem- 
peratures all the gases, except hydrogen, show a preponderance 
of molecular attraction. If the temperature is raised, the mutual 
attractive influcMice of the molecules becomes smaller, and the gas 



«By resistance to change of volume is to be understood a resistance from internal 
causes whereliy the gas undergoes a loss diminution of volume under increased pres- 
sure than would occur in the case of an ideal gas obeying Boyle's law. 



A NEW SOLAR THEORY. 175 

;H)})roach('s ;i stsitc in which attfiiclioii is coiintcThiilaiict'd hy I'cpuisive 
forces ])ot\V{HMi the inoJcculcs. When this state is reached the o-as 
would appear to obey Boyh^'s law, because th(^ molecular forces, to 
which a (le^•iatioll from the law is due, neutralize each other. !^)ut 
from this behavior of the gases at low^ timiperatures we may not yet 
conclude that an augmentation of temperature will more and more 
approach the gas to its ideal state as a limiting condition, and that 
conse([uently the incandescent gases in the sun must be in the perfect 
condition which was assumed by Lane when he derived his remarkable 
law. Such a conclusion would take no account of the possibility of an 
increase in the repulsive molecular forces with rising temperature. 
That indeed the perfect state is not the final state at w hich the gas 
arrives when its temperature is raised is clearly shown in the case of 
hydrog"en. 

The researches of Wroblewski havo demonstrated that at very low 
temperatures hydrogen behaves liki^ the other gases, showing a pre- 
ponderance of molecular attraction. But already at ' Celsius the 
gas exhil)its the predominating influence of repulsive forces, which 
become more and more pronounced when the temperature rises. In 
a yet un]:)ublished paper I have investigated, for a number of gases, 
the behavior of the molecular forces with changing temperature. By 
a simple modification of the equation of van der Waals T have suc- 
ceeded in representing the isothermal curves of these gases up to the 
highest pressures hitherto attainable (3,000 atm.). The new equation 
of state, which is in accordance with Clausius's equation of the virial, 
enal)les us to study the influence of temperature on the attractive and 
repulsive molecular forces. In all cases the atti'active forces have 
been found to diminish with increasing temperature, a result in 
accordance with the outcome of the researches of Clausius and van 
der Waals. But the repulsive forces, or to us(^ Andrews's expression: 
"The forces w'hich tend to produce a resistance to diminution of vol- 
ume," appear to increase very rapidly when the temperature is raised. 
The investigation leads to tho conclusion that at the temperature of 
the sun the preponderance of repulsive forces between the molecules 
of the gases must be very consideral)le. But it can be shown that 
under such conditions Lane's law loses its validity, so that a celestial 
body, although gaseous, may shrink under loss of temperature. This 
would remove an objection to the solar theory hei'e advanced, which 
otherwise might be urged on the ground of its being in opposition to 
a theorem Indd by many to constitute one of the fundamental laws in 
the evolution of stars. 

An objection may also bc^ rais(Hl against the assunqition that sohir 
eruptions are real outbursts of mattei- into the higher regions of the 
solar atmosphere. To many astrophysicists it appears difficult to 
account for the erjormous velociti(\s exhibited l)y these phenomena on 



176 A NEW SOLAR THEORY. 

the ussiiniption of their representing real di.sphicement of matter. It 
has been urged that the speed with which matter can ))e thrown up 
can not exceed the velocity of sound. l)ut that the maximum speed 
which can he reasonabh' assigned to the propagation of sound in the 
incandescent gases at the sun's surface falls considerably short of the 
velocities observed in solar prominences. Here, however, we must 
again bear in mind that the computed velocities of sound which have 
been used as an argument against the eruption theory are based 
entirely on Boyle's law. If repulsive molecular forces are taken into 
consideration, the velocity of sound appears to Ijc greater than in the 
case of a perfect gas. In fact, it is then no longer possible to assign 
an upper limit to the velocity of the sound wave, and hence this argu- 
ment against the reality of the displacement of matter in solar erup- 
tions loses its force. 

As I shall demonstrate in my paper, a careful investigation of the 
behavior of gases at such temperatures as we may obtain in oui' lab- 
oratories, points conclusively to the fact that at solar temperatures 
gaseous matter must be far from the ideal state to which Boyle's law 
ref(U"s. Many of our views, hitherto based on this law, may have to 
be altered, Init the changed aspect only removes serious difficulties 
without introducing others. I have found it advisable to add these 
few remarks on the state of gaseous matter in the sun to the original 
text of my investigation, as printed in Nature, February 13, 1902, in 
order to show briefly that the assumption upon which this solar theory 
mainl\' depends, viz, that our sun belongs to the class of "cooling'" 
stars, is reconcilable with the gaseous constitution of his mass. 



AN EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF THE PRESSURE 

OF LKJHT. " 



Bv Peter Lebedew 



Kepler was prol)!i))ly the first (in 10Li») to attril)iite tlie form of 
comets' tails to a repulsive force from the sun, and to explain this 
repulsion as the I'esult of the pressure exerted by the sun's rays on the 
matter in the tail. The same phenomenon also h'd Euler. in IT-ifi, 
to ascribe a pressure to the solar radiation, and in ITri-l De Mairan 
made the first attempts to test these ideas experimentally. 1)ut he did 
not obtain a po.sitivt^ result. 

A dual theoretical basis for the pressure of radiation was indej)end- 
ently and almost simultaneously given l)y Maxwell in isTo, as a con- 
sequence of the magnetic theory of light, and l)v Bai'toli in IST*!, as a 
consequence of the second law of thermodynamics. 

If a beam of parallel rays is normally incident on a plane surface, 
the amount of the Maxwell-Bartoli light-pressure^^ is determined if 
we know the quantity of energy ^received per second, the reflecting 
p(nver p of the surface, and the velocity -" of light. For then 

where I) varies between for an absolutely black surface and 1 for a 
perfectly reflecting surface. 

This pressure is very small; for solar rays falling normally at the 
earth's distance uj)on a s([uare meter, the pressure exerted is 0.4 mg. 
for a I)lack surface and 0.8 mg. for a mirror. 

In the experimental investigation of the pressure of light two large 
sources of disturbance arise, the one due to the well-known radiometric 
forces discovered l)y Crookes and the other to convection in the 
residual gas. It is possil)le, however, to diminish these disturbing 
forces and to make their efi'ect on the observations harndess, if the 
experiments are made with very thin metal \anes and the exhaustion 
is carri(Kl as far as possible by using a mercury pump and condensing 
the mercury- \a})or by fi'cezing mixtures.

178 EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF THE PRESSURE OB^ LIGHT. 

Without entering into the details of the experimental arrangements, 
the principle of the method emplo3^ed ma}^ be briefly explained as 
follows: A torsion thread hangs in a highl}^ exhausted l>ell jar and 
carries a vertical glass rod. Thin disks of 5 mm. diameter, of the 
metal to be investigated, are attached to this rod at a distance of 10 mm. 
from its axis. If the radiation from an arc lamp is (concentrated on 
one of the disks the incident radiation will exert a pressure upon it, 
and it will retire until the pressure due to radiation is balanced b}' the 
torsion of the glass thread; the angle of torsion is measured by a 
mirror and scale as for a galvanometer. This observation permits the 
determination of the absolute magnitude of the pressure (in d3nies) if 
the directing force of the torsion thread is measured in absolute units 
by one of the well-known methods. 

In order to compare the observed pressures with those computed, 
according to Maxwell and Bartoli, from the amount of energy incident 
and the reflecting power of the vane used, the same beam of light was 
directed upon a circular aperture of exactly the same size as the 
vane, and the rays passing through Avei-e caught by a calorimeter. If 
we divide the quantity of energy incident per second, as measured by 
the calorimeter, l)y the velocity of light, we obtain the amount of 
pressure in dynes exerted by the light upon a perfectly absorbing 
body, according to Maxwell and Bartoli. 

The measurements which were made repeatedly and with difl'erent 
apparatus jdelded accordingly the following results:

For such complicated and difficult measurements a better agree- 
ment between observations and computation can not be (expected. A 
discussion of the possil)le errors of o])servati(>n shows that they are 
considerable, hut that within the limits of error the existence of the 
light pressure of Maxwell and Bartoli are quantitatively confirmed.

thetical ones of electrical charges. A tirm basis, amenable to compu-

150REALIS." 



By Prof. John Cox, 

Mr a ill Uiiin-rxili/. 



There is und('iiia1)le fascination a1>out a th(M)r\' wiiicli includes within 
its sweep the time-honored problems of astrononi}' connected with 
comets' tails and the reason why the}' point awa}^ from the sun; the 
solar prominences and the corona; the source of th(^ lig-ht hy which 
the nebula' shine; the origin and structure of meteor swarms; and the 
aurora borealis; besides solving incidentall.v half a dozen minor out- 
standing mysteries of the heavens. 

Such a theory has been ad\'anced by Sweden's distinguished chemist 
and phj'sicist, Svante Arrhenius, in a paper pul)lished in the Physi- 
kalische Zeitschrift for November, l!»0(). Its main points were brietly 
mentioned with appro\'al by no fess an authority than Prof. J. J. 
Thomson at the end of his captivating article on "'Bodies smaller than 
atoms" in the August number of the Popular Science ^Monthly. All 
the physical principles on which Arrhenius relies, with one exception, 
are explained at length in that article, and are now very generally 
accepted. We may therefore say that the theory is based on *'vene 
causi\?,'' and its accordance with known facts is so impressive when 
the comparison is made in detail that I venture to think the readers 
of Professor Thomson's article will ])e interested in a more complete 
statement of Arrhenius's views than time permitted him to give. 

Let us begin by taking stock of the physical principles already to 
hand. We know (Professor Thomson's paper) that corpuscles, about 
1,000 times smaller than hydrogen atoms, and each l)earing a chai'ge 
of negati\ e electi'icity, are discharged with high velocity: 

(1) From the negative electrode in a Crookes tube (catiiode rays). 

(2) From hot ))odies, such as glowing nu'tals. 

(3) From cold metals under the iuHuence of ultra-\iolet light. 

(4) From the radio-active substanc(^ radium. 

Again we know that these corpuscles, or ions, in passing through a 
ga> produce other ions by collision with the molecules of the gas, and 
that the negatively charged ions are capable of ser\'ing as nuclei for 
the condensation of ordinary matter.

comets' tails. 

The (single new principle introduced ])y Arrhenius arises in connec- 
tion with the problem of comets' tails. ^' Astronomers have always felt 
that the phenomena exhibited by these .strange oljjects could onl}" be 
accounted for b}^ making the sun the seat of a violent radial repulsive 
force, but were entirely at a loss to account for this repulsion. So long 
as light was supposed to consist of myriads of corpuscles discharged 
with a speed of 186,000 miles per second, it was eas}^ with Kepler, to 
regard the corpuscles as carrying with them in their rush the materials 
vaporized from the comet by the heat of the sun. But the establish- 
ment of the wave theory of light put an end to this idea. Thus 
Newcomb .says (Popular A.stronomy): "If light were an emission of 
material particles, as Newton su})posed it to be, this view would have 
some plausibility. But light is now conceived to consist of vibrations 
in a ethereal medium; and there is no known way in which they could 
exert any propelling force on inatter!" 

Now, Arrhenius points out that according to the electro-magnetic 
theory of light a ray of light does exert a pressure on any surface on 
which it impinges. Maxwell not only proved this in his original pub- 
lication of the theory in 1873, but showed how to calculate its value.* 
With the known constants of solar radiation he found that sunlight at 
the surface of the earth should exert a pressure of 0.592x10"^*^ grams 
on eveiy square centimeter. This is too small a force to be detected, 
though it has been looked for,'" 

« Thi.s principle was first suggested as an explanation of comets' tails by P. Lebedew 
in 1891 ( Wied. Ann., 45, p. 292), where it is pointed out that Maxwell's formula can 
only be applied strictly to a perfectly absorbing black body wlio.se dimensions are 
small compared with the wave length of the incident light. 

?' Maxwell's formula was deduced on thermodynamical grounds V)y Bartoli (1876; 
see also Exner's Repert. d. Phys., 21, p. 198, 1885), Boltzmann (Wied. Ann., 22, pp. 
81, 291; and 31, p. i;)9, 1884), and Galitzine (Wied. Ann., 47, p. 479). 

'Until the appearance of Arrhenius's papers (Phys. Zeitschrift, Nov. 10 and 17, 
1900) all attempts to detect the pressure of light experimentally had failed, since the 
effect to be looked fur liad ))een masked by convection and radiometric effects of 
much greater magnitude in the high vacua employed. But immediately afterwards 
it was successfidly measured ))y Lebedew (Drude, Ann., (5, p. 433, 1901) and by E. F. 
Nichols and Ci. F. Hull (Physical Review, Nov., 1901, p. 397), employing different 
methods, but in both cases reaching results which accord with the calculated values 
within the limits of error of the observations. 

Arrhenius applied the formula) for comparatively large and perfectly absorbing 
spheres to jjarticles ranging down to molecrular dimensions which could not be 
regarded as absorbing. K. Schwarzschild (Miinch. Ber.. 31, pp. 293-338, 1901), 
employing Spherical Harmonic Series, has given a complete mathematical discus- 
sion of the problem for perfectly reflecting spheres of any size. He finds that the 
pressure reaches a maximum when the diameter of the particle is one-third of a 
wave length, and then falls off rapidly; but that this maxinmm pres.-ure (about 
18 times the value of the solar gravitation) is all that is required for Arrhenius's 
tlu'iiiy. In fact, the agreement with the numbers (luoted from Bredichin in the 
text, in ignorance of !8cliwarzschild's analysis, is curiously exact. 



comets'' tails, the cokona, and the aurora. 181 

But at the surface of the sun the pressure would mount up to '2.75 
niilligranis per square ceutinietpr. On the other hand, a cul)ic centi- 
lueter of water, which vveiohs 1 o-ram at the surface of the earth, 
would weig'li 27.47 o-rjuus at the surface of the sun — i. e.. the attrac- 
tion of the sun would draw it inward with about 10,0()() times the force 
with which the sun's light would tend to drive it away. 

Ver}' difterent is the cas(^ if. instead of a cul)ic centimeter, we con- 
sider a much smaller cube. The pressure on its base would fall ofi' as 
the square of its edij-e. but the weio-ht would diminish as tiie cube. 
There must come a point at which the ])r(\ssure of the liyht would just 
balance the weight; and still smaller particles would be driven off with 
a force greater than their weight. Thev would behave, in fact, as if 
gravity had become negative. 

For example, a cube of water measuring one-thousandth of a milli- 
meter (10~^ cm.) in the edge would weigh 27.47 X 1(>~^'- gnis. ; and the 
pressure of light on its base would be 2.75X 1()--^X !«»-% — 27.5xl()-^- 
gms. — i. e., slightly more than its weight. 

In measuring wave lengths of light physicists denote one-thousandth 
of a millimeter by the symbol /'. The critical value of the vdge of a 
cube of water, i. e., the value for which its weight is exactly neutralized 
b}^ the pressure of light at the sun's surface, is thus approximately //. 
For a spherical drop the critical diameter may be calculated to be 1.5 // 
for water. For other sul)stances the critical value is inversely propor- 
tional to the specific gravity. 

A similar effect of extreme minuteness is familiar to us as the expla- 
nation of the long time required by very small particles to settle 
through the atmosphere, amounting to many months in the case of 
the tinely-divided dust thrown u[) during- the eruptions of Krakatoa; 
but the resistance to suspended dust particles can never exceed their 
weight, since it is only called forth by the motion produced by the 
weight itself. The pressure of light now" considered may enormously 
exceed the weight, provided the paiiicles are small enough. 

Fi'om the motions, and especially the curvature, of comets' tails the 
magnitude of the repulsive forces to which they are subject may be 
calculated. Thus Bredichin tinds in fo'ur instances that the repulsion 
must have been about 18.5, 3.2, 2, and 1.5 times the sun's gravitational 
attraction. Now, the vapors emitted by comets are largely hydro- 
carbons of specilic gravity al)out 0.8. To account for these repulsions 
on Arrhenius's principle the drops nmst have had diameters of 0.1 /<, 
0.59 ju, 0.94 yw, and 1.25 //, respectively. In another case, where the 
tail curved toward the sun, Bredichin foimd the repulsion to be 0.;') 
times gravity. This would indicate partitdes of diameter (> //. Par- 
ticles of this ordei' of magnitude, and far smaller, arc familiai' enough 
to us, especially in combustion and in the early stages of condensation. 

The theory suggested is, then, as follows: As the comet approaches 
the sun the intense heat causes a \ ioleiit eru])tioii of hydi'ocai'bon 



182 comets' tails, the corona, and the aurora. 

vapors on the sido toward the sun. The hydroo-en t)oils off and the 
vapors condense into small drops of hydrocarbons with higher l)oiling' 
points, or idtiuiately solid carbon is thrown out, linelv divided as in 
an ordinary Haine. The largest of these particles fall back to the 
comet, or. if they are not condensed till at a great distance from it, 
they form tails turned toward the sun. The smaller are driven rap- 
idly from the sun l)y the pressure of its light, with a speed depending 
on their size, and form the ordinary tails pointing" away from it. 
That particles of different sizes should ])e formed from the same 
comet is natural, since the comet is likeh- to be formed of heteroge- 
neous matei-ials and there must be great variety in the circumstances 
of condensation. Thus the comet of 1744 had no less than live tails of 
different curvature. Occasionally the calculated repulsion on the 
same tail is not found to follow exactly the law of the inverse square 
of the distance from the sun throughout its whole length. This puz- 
zling circumstance is at once explained if the particles should for any 
reason change their state of aggregation, and coiseciuently their size, 
during their headlong career. In the light of this theoiy the follow- 
ing passages will l)e found ^'ery suggestive. 
Herschel, Outlines of Astronomy (p. 376): 

""It is for the most part after thus passing the sun that they shine 
forth in all their splendor, and that their tails acquire their greatest 
length and development, thus indicating plainly the action of the sun's 
rays as the exciting cause of that extraordinary emanation." 

Again (p. 560): 

"The tail of the great comet of 1680 immediately after its perihe- 
lion passage was found by Newton to have been no less than 20,000,000 
leagues in length and to have occupied only two days in its emission 
from the comet's bod}^ — a decisive proof this of its Ijeing darted forth 
by some active force, the origin of which, to judge by the direction of 
the tail, nuist be sought in the sun itself.'' 

Now, a particle with one-half the critical diametei* would in the 
course of traveling from the sun's surface to a distance equal to his 
radius acquire a speed of 430 kilometers per second. With this 
velocity it would cross a space equal to the diameter of the sun, 
865,000 miles, in less than an hour. In comets' tails we probably 
have to do with particles having less than one-eighteenth of the crit- 
ical diameter. Such particles would cover the same distance in less 
than four minutes. With a force majiy times the sun's attraction 
driving them into space, they would make little of 20,000,000 leagues 
in two da3's; whereas if this were to be accomplished against gravit}' 
the velocity of projection required might well stagger the astronomers. 

Referring to Ilalley's comet, Hersclud says (p. 381): 

"On the 2d of October (the very day of the first observed com- 
mencement of the tail) the nucleus, which had been faint and small, 



comets' tails, the corona, and the aurora. 183 

was observed suddenly to h:ive become much brighter and to ])e in 
the act of throwino- out a Jet or strc^am of light from its anterior ])art, 
or that turned towartl the sun. This ejection, after ceasing a while, was 
resumed, and with nmch greater apparent violence, on the 8th, and 
continued with occasional intermittences so long as the tail itself con- 
tiiuied ^•isible. '^ "'^' ■• These jets, though very bright at their 
l)oint of emantition from the nucleus, faded rapidly away, and l)ecame 
ditiused as they expanded into the coma, at the same time cur\ing 
backward as streams of steam or smoke would do if thrown out from 
narrow oritices more or less obliquely in opposition to a powerful 
wind, against which they were unable to make way, and ultimately 
yielding to its force, so as to be drifted back and confounded in a 
\aporous train, following the general direction of the current. 

"It seems impossible to avoid the following conclusions: First. 
That the matter of the nucleus of a comet is powerfully excited and 
dilated into a \aporous state l)v the action of the sun's rays, escaping 
in streams and jets at those points of the surface which oppose the 
least resistance. Second. That this process chiefly takes place in that 
portion of the luicleus which is turned toward the sun, the vapor 
escaping chielly in thtit dii'ection. Third. That when so emitted it 
is prevented from proceeding in the direction originally impressed on 
it by some force directed from the sun drifting it back and carrying 
it out to vast distances behind the nucleus, forming the tail. Fourth. 
That this force, whatever its nature, acts unequally on the materials 
of the comet. Fifth. That the force thus acting on the materials of 
the tail can not "possibly ])e identical with the ordinary gravitation of 
matter, being centrifugal or repulsive, as respects the sun, and of an 
energy very far exceeding the gravitating force toward that lumi- 
nary. This will l)e evident if we consider the enormous velocity with 
which the matter of the tail is carried backward, in opposition l)oth 
to the motion which it had as part of the nucleus and to that which it 
acquired in the act of emission.'" 

Again, descrit)ing the long, straight tail of the great comet of 1843, 
from which a lateral tail, nearly twice the length of the regular one, 
was shot forth in a single day, Herschel says: 

''The projection of this ray, which was not seen either before or 
after the daj" in question, to so enormous a length (nearly 100-) in a 
single da}' conveys an impression of the intensity of the forces acting 
to produce such a velocity of material transfer through space, such as 
no other natural ])henomenon is capable of exciting. It is clear that 
if we have to deal here with matter, such as we conceive it, viz., 
possessing inertia, at all, it nuist be under the dominion of forces 
incompara))ly more energetic than gravitation and (juite of a different 
nature." 

And finally (p. 106): 

"There is beyond question some profound secret and m}\ster.v of 
nature concerned in the phenomenon of their tails. In no respect is 
the C[uestion as to the material it\' of the tail more forcibly pressed on 
us for consideration than in that of the enormous sweep which it makes 
round the sun in perihelio, in the manner of a straight and rigid rod, 
in defiance of the law of gravitation, nay, even of the received law^s of 
motion, extending (as we have seen in the comets of lOSU and 1813) 



184 comets' tails, the corona, and the aurora. 

from near th(^ sun's surface to the earth's orl)it, 3'et whirled round 
unl)roken, in the latter case throuj^h an angle of 180-* in little more 
than two hours. It seems utterly incredible that in such a case it is 
one and the same material object which is thus brandished. If there 
could be conceived such a thin^ as a neg-ative shadow, a momentary 
impression made upon the luminiferous ether behind the comet, this 
would represent in some degree the conception such a phenomenon 
irresistibly calls up. But this is not all. Even such an extraordinary 
excitement of the ether, conceive it as we will, will alt'ord no account 
of the projection of lateral streamers; of the effusion of light from the 
nucleus of a comet toward the sun, and of its subsetpient rejection; 
of the irregular and capricious mode in which that effusion has been 
seen to take place." 

These passages give a vivid picture of the utter puzzledom of 
astronomers over difficulties which arise from precisely those phe- 
nomena which fit most naturally into the theory of Arrhenius. 

THE PROMINENCES AND THE CORONA. 

At the moment when the sun's disc is obscured in a total eclipse 
enormous red flames, sometimes curving over toward the sun and 
sometimes floating like clouds at heights up to •i(),000 miles above his 
surface, are seen projecting over the reg-ion of sunspots, where the 
sun's eruptive activity is greatest; and silvery streamers with a radial 
structure form a lens-shaped envelope about the same region, often 
extending to a distance of several times the sun's radius. These are 
known as the prominences and the corona. 

The sun must itself project vapors into space. When these con- 
dense, the drops will, if larger than the critical size, fall back to the 
sun, g'iving rise to the curved prominences; and if smaller, they will 
be driven off' into space, and l)e seen as the streamers of the corona. 
Since the eruptions will not always be perpendicular to the sun's sur- 
face, the prominences will often exhibit parabolic curves, and the 
streamers may not alwa3-s be strictly radial, though the greater part 
of this effect is to be attributed to the foreshortening under which 
some of them are viewed from the earth. 

Those particles which have approximately the critical diameter will 
float as clouds, sustained by the pressure of light. This point is 
specially interesting, since it has been difiicult to account for the main- 
tenance of the cloudlike prominences without assuming the existence 
of a considerable atmosphere about the sun. Yet the comet of 1843 
described 300,000 miles within a distance of less than one-third of the 
sun's radius from his surface with a velocity of 350 miles per second, 
and came out without having suft'eredany visible damage or retardation. 

The corona has ))een as great a stumbling-block to astronomers as 
the comet's tail. Thus Newcomb (Popular Astronomy, p. 263) says: 

"•The corona is not a mass of foggy or milky light. ])ut has a hairy 
structure like long tufts of flax. * * "" (3f this appendage we may 



comets' tails, the corona, and the aurora. 185 

say with coiilideiu-t' that U can not he an atniosphor(\ tliat is, a con- 
tinuous mass of elastic gas hold up by its own elasticity. " ■■■ * 
What, tlien, is the i-oroua^ Probably dotaclu'd particles partially or 
wholly vaporized by the intense heat to which they are exposed. * '^ '^' 
The difficult cpiestion which we meet is. How are these particles held 
up;' To this cpiestion only conjectural replies can be o-iven." 

Three conjccturesarc then mentioned, of which wc may note the lirst: 

""That the matter of the corona is in what we may call a state of 
projection, being- constantly thrown up by the sun, while e;ich particle 
thus projected falls down again according to the law of gravitation. 
The difficulty we encounter here is that wo nmst suppose velocities of 
projection rising as high as 2(H) miles per second constantly maintained 
in ever}' region of the solar globe. 

"The prominences are of two classes — the cloud-like and the erup- 
tive. The first class presents the a]3pearance of clouds floating in an 
atmosphere: 1)ut as no atmosphere dense enough to sustain anything 
can possibly exist there, we find the same difficulty in accounting for 
them that we do in accounting for the susptMision of the matter of the 
corona.'' 

Professor Young is frankly despairing: 

"I do not know what to make of tiie corona. * ■'" "* By what 
forces the peculiar radiated structure of the corona is determined I 
have no definite idea. Th(^ analogies of (■/>/iir/,s' fails avd (Uiroral 
stre((mers both appear suggestive; but on the other hand, the spc^ctra 
of the corona, the aurora borealis, the comets, and the nel)uhe are all

to propose to account for the c<:)i<i!ii foniwrfion ht-tireoi (Usfurlxiiices 
of tJie solar siD'facc and of frrrrsfrtal magio'tlxinS^ 

The words we have underlined in this passage have almost a Sopho- 
clean irony to a reader acquainted with the further developments of 
Arrhenius's theorv, to which we now turn. 

THE ZODIACAL EKJHT AND TUK ( iEOENSCHEIN. 

Not only is the sun the source of those eru})tions of ordinary matter 
which form the ])rominences, ))ut we have every reason to be b(dieve 
that he nmst emit strt'ams of electrically charged c()ri)uscles both 
directly, as a hot 1)ody. and indirectly, since th(^ (dectrical dischai'ges 
which, according to all terrestrial analogies, nmst accompany the 
violent chemical actions going on near his surface, will, when they take 
place in the higher and rarer regions of his afmosphei'e, give ris(^. to 
kathode rays, and these, in turn, to Rontgen rays. As l*rofessor 
Thomson says: '•As a very hot metal emits these cor])nscles, it does 
not seem an imi)roba])le hypothesis that they are emitted by that very 
hot l)ody, the sun.'' 

Now the negatively charged corpuscles are preeminently htted to 
serve as nuclei for the condensation of the ordinary mattcM-. Hence 
those particles of the latter which, having more than the ci'itical diam- 
eter, fall back to th(^ sun, will carry back a negative charge to him; while 



186 coMpyrs' tails, the corona, and thk aurora. 

those which have less than the critical diameter will carr}- a nei>ative 
charge off into space. On both counts the corona will be left with a 
surplus of positive charge. The same arguments hold for the vapors 
emitted by the nucleus of a comet. Thus comets' tails should consist 
of negatively charged particles. 

Let us follow the career of the particles launched into space. They 
proceed radiall}^ from the sun alcove the regions of sun spots with 
rapidl}' increasing speed, which, however, ma}^ })e shown to approach 
a finite limit at a distance of about ten radii from the sun. If thej'' 
encounter another bodv, such as the earth, they charge its outer atmos- 
phere negatively, and when this charge reaches a certain value, it will 
begin to repel them. The oncoming rush will l)e deflected, and stream 
past the earth on each side in hyperbolic orbits. Far out in space they 
must sooner or later meet particles from other bodies, and, if by col- 
lision or agijregation they increase beyond the critical diameter, they 
will first lose speed and then drift back with ever increasing velocity 
past the earth, clirectl}- toward the sun. The space immediately ])ehind 
the earth would be screened b}" her, and so be void of particles. Could 
we take our stand on the moon, we should thus see the earth attended 
by a faint double tail with a dark dividing line (so conspicuous a fea- 
ture in comets), immediatel}^ behind it, pointing from the sun; and a 
similar, though perhaps fainter, tail, pointing toward him. Not only 
so, but the earth helps to form her own tail. For when the negative 
charge in the upper atmosphere is high enough, discharges are })rought 
about by the powerful ultra-violet radiation from the sim, and parti- 
cles are driven off' radiall}' from the earth on the side turned toward the 
sun, only to l)e drifted back with the other streams into the tail. The 
effect will be as if a sheaf of light projected from her toward the sun. 

Compare with this the description of the zodiacal light (Newcomb, 
Popidar Astronomy, p. -iH)): 

"This object consists of a very soft faint column of light, which may 
be seen rising from the western horizon after twilight on any clear 
winter or spring evening; it may also be s(^en rising from the eastern 
liorizon just before daybreak in the summer or autumn. It really 
extends out on each side of the sun, and lies nearly in the plane of the 
ecliptic. * ''" " Near the equator, where the ecliptic always rises 
high above tiie horizon, the light can be seen about equally well all 
the year round. * "" '^^ It is due to a lens-shaped appendage of 
some sort surrounding the sun, and extending out a little beyond the 
earth's orl)it. 

"The nature of the su])stance from which this light emanates is 
entirely unknown. * * '^^ Professor Wright, of Yale College, finds 
its sp(H'trum to be continuous. Accepting this, we should be led to 
the conclusion that the phenomenon in question is due to reflected sun- 
light, probabl}' from an inuuense cloud of meteorites, filling up the 
space between the earth and the sun.'' 



comets' tails, the coeona, and the attrora. 187 

The diHicnlty in this A'iew is that tho ()r])its oi" such swarms of 
meteorites as ar(^ known to ns are distributed irrey'idarly with regard 
to the eeliptie. On the other hand, Arrhenius's streams of particles, 
when near enough to be visible, necessarily lie in or near the ecliptic, 
as recjuii'ed 1)}^ observation. Moi'e than this, the particles emitted Ijy 
the earth herself should be most abundant o\er those regions which 
have been exposed for many hours to the sun. Now it has l)een 
observed that the zodiacal light is stronger on what Arrhenius calls the 
"evening side" of the earth (i. c. , that side which is in the act of 
turning away from the sun, and has the sun in the west) than on the 
"morning side.'' 

Even at night, when the sun is below the horizon, faint reflections 
should reach us from the streamers behind the earth, and by an effect 
of persp ctive, these should have a maxinnun in the point opposite to 
the sun, where they will appear most dense. Let Professor Newcomb 
describe the Gegenschein; 

"Another mysterioQs phenomenon associated with the zodiacal light 
is known by its German appellation, the Gegenschein. It is said that 
in that point of the heavens directly opposite the sun there is an (^llip- 
tical jjatch of light, a few degrees in extent of such extreme faintness 
that it can be seen only })y the most sensitive eyes, under the best con- 
ditions, and through the clearest atmosphere. This phenomenon secMus 
so difficult to account for that its existence is sometimes doubted; yet 
the testimon}' in its favor is difficult to set aside." 

How is it that the moon does not exhil)it such tails ^ The moon has 
no atmos-phere, so that the particles which reach her give up their nega- 
tive charge to her directly, and it spreads equally all over her surface. 
When in turn she herself discharges the particles, it will be uniforndy 
in all directions, and she should appear surrounded with a uniform 
sheath. Possibl}" this sheath of cosmical dust affords the reason that 
in a lunar eclipse the shadow of the earth can bt> traced a short distance

THE aurora B(JREALIS. 

Perhaps the most interesting application of Arrhenius's theory is his 
explanation of the Aurora. In a well-known experiment the streams 
of negative particles forming cathode rays in a Crookes tu])e are 
exposed to a magnetic field, when they are seen to describe h(dices 
round the lines of force. If the field is powerful enough they may 
thus be bent into a complete cir(de inside a moderately large tube. 

Now the negative particles discharged from the sun arrive most 
thickly over the equatorial regions of the earth, wdiich ai'(^ most 
directly exposed to him. Long before they reach any atmosjjhere 
dense enough to excite kHuinescence, the}' are caught by the lines of 
force of the earth's magnetic field, which are horizontal over theecpia- 
tor, and have to follow them, winding round them in helices whose 



188 (;OMETS' TAILS, THE CORONA, AND THE AURORA. 

radii are so much less than their height above us that the eflE'ect to a 
beholder on the earth is as if the3" moved along the lines of force. 
Over the equator there is little luminescence, for lack of atmosphere. 
But as the lines of force travel north and south they dip downward, 
making for the magnetic poles, over which thej" stand vertical. Soon 
the particles find themselves in lower la^^ers of the atmosphere, com- 
parable in density with our highest artificial vacua, and begin to give 
out the darting and shifting lights of the cathode ray. But this can 
only be at the cost of absorption, and )yy the time the denser la3"ers of 
air are reached their energy is exhausted. Hence the dark circles 
roiuid the magnetic poles from which, as from behind a curtain, the 
leaping pillars of the Aurora rise. From this point of view it is sig- 
nificant that Dr. Adam Paulsen, who has made a special study of the 
northern lights, found so many points of correspondence between 
them and cathode ra^^s that in ISO-i he was led to regard the aurora 
as a special case of the latter, though unable to give an\^ account of 
their origin in the upper atmosphere, such as is supplied Vjy Arrhenius's 
theory. 

The most ol)vious test to which we can .subject such a theory is to 
ask from it some explanation of the very remarkable periodic varia- 
tions in the frequency of aurorie. If they are caused b}" streams of 
particles ejected from the sun, there should be some connection 
between the changes in the sun's activity, as indicated by the number 
of sun spots, and the number of aurorie observed. Again, since a 
negative charge in motion is (pace M. Cremieux) equivalent to a nega- 
tive current, the passage of electrified particles through the upper 
atmosphere should affect magnetic instruments on the earth. Sun 
spots, aurora?, magnetic storms should therefore var}" together. 

It has long been known empirically that they do agree in a general 
way. Arrhenius''s discussion of the mass of statistics of ol)served 
aurorte forms so striking an example of the "Method of concomitant 
variations" that at the risk of wearying the reader we shall give it in 
some detail. 

i. jS/"ir .sccnliir pcrtodx. — {<() Both sun spots and auror;v show marked 
maxima at the middle of the eighteenth and the end of the nineteenth 
centuries. 

{h) Sun spots, uuroric, and magnetic storms go through a simul- 
taneous increase^ and decrease in the well-known period of 11.1 years. 

The source of these slow variiitions nuist be looked for in the little 
understood variations of the sun's activity. 

2. ihniaxd j>eriod. — The number of aurorte is greatest in March and 
September, and least in .lune and December; and the mean frequency 
for Ijoth hemispheres is somewhat less in June than in December. 

Now the sun's activity, as indicated l)v the nunil)er of sun spots, is a 
mininnim at his ecjuatoi", the s})ots occurring j)rincipally in l)elts about 



comets' tails, the corona, and the attrora. 1<S9 

15 north and south of hiy (Hiuator. Since the streams of particles 
issue radiall}' from the sun, tliQ earth will be most exposed to them 
when she is most nearly opposite the active^ belts. But the earth stands 
opposite the sun's ecjuator on June 4 and December (>, and is at her 
farthest north and south of it (7 ), i. e., most nearly opposite the sun- 
spot l)elts, on March 5 and on Septem]>er o. Moreover, she is some- 
what nearer to the sun in. December than in June. 

As between the two hemispheres, the same conditions apply as those 
which regulate the seasons, viz, altitude of the sun above the horizon, 
and leng'th of time durin^- which h(^ remains al)ove it daily. Aurorte 
should therefore be more frequent in summer than in winter, a result 
which is >eritied by the records. And just as the hig'hest daily tem- 
perature occurs from two to three hours after midday, so we ou^ht to 
tind a daily maximum of aurorte about 3 p. m. It is not possible to 
verify this directly, since aurorse are not visible in daylii^'ht. Hut 
Arrhenius remarks (1) that the majoritv of them occur ))efore mid- 
night and not after it, whitdi is so far in general agreement with the 
theory; {'2) that Carlheim-(Tyllenskir)ld. discussing the observations 
made at Cape Thordsen in Spitzbergcn during the winter of iSSii-SS, 
with a view to correcting the mimbers recorded for the eti'ect of day- 
light in concealing thcin, deduces a probable maximiunfor the nund)er 
jictually occurring at 2.4<) p. m. 

But though we can not observe aurorte in daylight we are not with- 
out resource, for even when invisible they give notice of their presence 
by disturbing the ordinary course of the records photograj)hic;dly taken 
in our magnetic observatories. In lSi>l> Van Benunelen discussed the 
records of such magnetic storms taken in Batavia. He found thtit they 
show maxima in March and September, minima in January and flune, 
and a daily maximum at 'S p. m., and mininuun at i a. m. 

•>'. Aloiit/ih/ rarliit/oiis. -H is only recently (ISi)S) that the collection 
of statistics of aurone published by pA-kholm and Arrhenius has 
l)rought to light two curious monthly variations in their number. 

One of these, with ii variation of 20 per cent on each side of tin; 
mean, depends on the revolution of the moon in her orbit, showing in 
the northern hemisphere a maximum when the moon is fai'thest south 
of the equator, a minimum when she is farthest north; and vice versa 
for the southern hemisphere. 

The explanation appears highly ingenious. It is as follows: The 
moon, being unprotected by an atmosphere, is charged by the sti'cams 
of particles that reach her much as the outer layers of our own atmos- 
phere are charged, and therefore, as we have good reason to belie\i', to 
a far higher negative potential than is o))served at the surface of the 
earth. If so, she will seriously affect th(> munbei- of aurovie at any 
place over which she stands, by lowering the potential gradient, and 
thus reducing thcnumberof negative discharges in the highest regions 
of our atmosphere. 



190 COMETS TAILS, THE CORONA, AND THE AURORA. 

The other variation of some 1») per cent each wa}" has a period of 
25,03 (lays and affects both hemispheres alike. At first sig-ht it is 
natural to refer this to the synodical time of revolution of the sun on 
his axis as determined by observations of sun spots. But this is 27.3 
days. Remembering- that the earth never departs more than 7'^ from 
the sun's equator, we should rather take the time of revolution of the 
equatorial belt for comparison. As estimated by the motion of the 
facula\ this is 2<>.06 days, the equator moving faster than the sun-spot 
l)elts, and prol)ably the time of revolution of the outermost layers, 
from which the particles stream, is yet a little shorter. The agreement 
with the period of the aurora (2.5.93 da3'S) would thus be within the 
limits of error of the observations. 

ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 

Let us now trace the effect of the auroras on the earth's atmosphere. 
If they are really cathode rays on a grand scale, they must ionize the 
air; the neg-ative "ions will form centers for condensation, and sinking 
to the earth by gravitation, will charge it negatively, leaving the layers 
at moderate heights positively charged. This agrees with the results 
of recent observations made from balloons up to heights of 3,000 
meters. 

Since condensation will depend on the number of ions available for 
nuclei, we have at once an explanation of the curious fact that cloud 
formation in the upper atmosphere is more copious in j^ears of frequent 
aurora^ than when they occur rarely. In this connection another odd 
coincidence ma}^ be mentioned. When sun spots are numerous Jupiter 
shines with a white light; when the}^ are few his light has a reddish 
tinge. Now, it is agreed that Jupiter is still at a high temperature. 
If, therefore, sun spots cause auror;e on Jupiter, and consequent cloud 
formation, we must see less of the heated interior in sun-spot years 
than we do when his cloud layers are not so opaque. 

In isiil) Von Bezold showed that the daily variation of the compass 
over the earth's surface could l)e simply represented as follows: 
Imagine two points, one in latitude -lO'^ N., and one in 40^ S., to move 
round with the sun. Then it is as if the north end of the compass 
needle were attracted toward the northerly point and the south end 
toward the southerly. Remembei'ing that the air immediately above 
the earth has a positive charge, we see that this effect would follow by 
Ampere's rule, if the sun's heat caused two air whirls, one in the 
northern and one in the southern hemisphere, over the places of highest 
temperature, the former rotating counter-clockwise, the latter clock- 
wise. Such whirls would result from the sucking in of currents from 
the slower-moving north latitudes and the faster-moving south lati- 
tudes toward the mean latitude of 40^, in the northern hemisphere, 
and similarly for the southern. If this ])e the true explanation, then 
for a given f requenc}^ of sun spots the amplitude of the diurnal varia- 



comets' tails, the corona, and the aurora. 191 

tioii should increase by the same fniction of itself for all parts of the 
earth. Thus, if A' is the amplitude at a given place in a year of no 
sun spots, and A its \'alue in a year for which Wolfs nunil)er ex})ress- 
ing' the relative fre([uency of spots is f, wo ought to lind A = A"^ 
(l-\-ai). Now, the value of the coefKcient a conies out O.OIHU from 
whatever part of the wx^rld the observations be taken from which it is 
calculated. 

]\ietkokitp:s and nebul.e. 

To the man of science this discussion of terrestrial details will 
pro]>ably be the most convincing part of the evidence adduced by 
Arrhenius for his theory. But it is time to turn from it and follow 
with lagging imagination the destinies of those particles, by far the 
greatest number, which miss tht^ earth and the planets and launch 
forth into interstellar space. 

Many of them will meet similar streams ejected from othei' suns, 
and, overcoming the mutual repulsion of their negative charges b^- their 
mighty velocities, will clash together, like Lucretius's atoms, and unite 
to form larger masses. But this aggregation must have an end. For 
if, in the void of space, the}' are unable to get rid of their eh^ctric 
charges, the potential of the growing mass nuist rapidly increase, since 
the charge increases as the cube of the radius, being proportional to 
the total numl)er of particles, while the capacity for holding electricity 
oidy increases as the radius itself. To put this in popular language, 
each particle brings to the account the whole charge it can bear on its 
surface; l>ut in the mass, since electricit}' flies to the surface, oidy the 
outer parts of those particles which are actually in the surface can be 
useful in harboring the accunmlating charge, and hence the electric 
pressure rises. When it becomes intense enough to prevent fresh 
particles from approaching, accretion will cease. Space will thus be 
sown with masses of moderate size, formed irregularly, particle l)y 
particle, in spite of I'epulsive forces. These are the meteorites Avhich 
blaze for a moment in the upper air, or in rare cases reach the earth 
to puzzle philosophers with their [)or()us structure. 

Another nudtitude of the particles will at last reach otluu* suns. 
For if in their wanderings they have united with others till they are 
beyond the critical size, they will be drawn in, and raise the charge of 
the bodies they reach, till they in turn discharge thc^ir streams into 
space. 

In these we see the "greyhounds" of the abyss, engaged in dis- 
tributing the materials of the universe, forever busied in a cosmic 
trafHc by whose exchanges the stellar hosts are mad(^ more and more 
alike in constitution, \vhatev(M- may hav(> l)een theii' difi'erences in the 
beginning. 

For those myriads which are fated to escapi^ all visible suns, far out 
in the ""flaming bounds of space" tlui iu>l)uhv lie in wait, spreading 
spider-like their impalpable webs across inuneasurable breadths of sky. 



192 comets' tails, the cokona, and the aurora. 

Ever since the spectroscope showed that man}' nebuke are gaseous, and 
3^et shine by their own light, two problems have vexed the astronomers. 
How can they be hot enough to send light to us. and yot be hold 
together against the expansive force of the hi^ated gas ))\ the feelile 
gravitation which such inconceivably diffuse masses can exert at their 
borders? If they arc really at a temperature of not less than 500° C, 
so as to shine, or, indeed, if the}" are much above absolute zero, their 
own gravitation should not be able to prevent their speed}^ dissipation 
into space. 

Again, why do they show the spectroscopic lines of so few gases, and 
those the lighter ones, such as hydrogen and helium;' 

According to Arrhenius, the nebnhe are cold, with the cold of empty 
space. Their light is due to the rain of negatively charged particles 
which, plunging into their outermost regions, give rise to electric 
discharges and make their gases shine as the gases in a vacuum tube. 
To this the intense cold is no bar, for Stark has shown that the inten- 
sity of light excited in a vacuum tiil)e is greater the lower the tem- 
perature at which the experiment is tried. And this process should 
take place at the surface of the ne])ula, where the lighter gases would 
be found, the heavier settling inward. Hence the few lines found in 
the spectrum of a nebula, and the c<)mparati\o brightness of the out- 
lying parts, especialh' to be observed in the planetary and the ring 
nebula?. 

Such is Arrhenius's theory. It is too early, as 3'et, to pronounce 
any judgment upon it, but glancing l)ack over the array of hitherto 
unexplained facts which fall into order, without forcing, at its touch, 
we nmst admit that it is at least plausible. It springs from a single 
principle, itself a necessary theoretical conseciuence of the accepted 
electromagnetic theory of light — viz. that light must exei't a pressure 
which, in the case of small })articles, ma\' very greatly exceed their 
weight. By means of this principle in conjunction with recent views 
a])out the nature and properties of ions, which can all be exjierimen- 
tally veriiied, this theory gives a rational cx})laiiation of the astounding 
behavior of comets' tails; accounts for the "hairy"' structure of the 
corona; shows us how the prominences can float whei'e the existence 
of a supjxn-ting atmosphere is inadmissible; Avhat is the origin of the 
zodiacal light and the (xegenschein; of '"the certain connection" 
between sun spots and magnetic storms; of the aurora, and why it is 
subject to such complicated periodical variations; why nu>teoi'ites are 
porous and limited in size; how the nebuhe shine in the absolute cold 
of interstellar space, and yet hang togethei-; and why their constitu- 
ents appear to be so restricted, while the suns among which Ihcy are 
strewn give evidence of most of the (demiMits known on ( arlh. 

A theory which swee])s the asti'onomicai horizon of so many mys 
terics nuist not oidy arouse our profound interest, but claim the 
respectful consideration of men of science. 



'.GOOD sep:ing."« 



Bv S. p. LAN(!r.KY 



Evciyone who has used a teh^scopc knows that our atmosphere is 
forever in pulsating" motion, and troiiltlini;' oiii- \ ision of tiie hea\enlv 
])odies, during- the most ck)udh'ss day or niglit, so that observatories 
are ])ut even on higli mountains, to get rid of th<> (listurl)ances in this 
atmosphere, whieli tend to make the image of eveiy object trenudous 
and indelinite, and to prevent what the astronomer terms "'good >^eeing/' 

I desire to speak to the academy about a device which I hav(^ recently 
essayed for preventing this universally known and dreaded •"boiling"'' 
of the telescopic image, a dilticulty which has existed always and every- 
where since telescopes have been in use, and which has seemed so insur- 
mountable that I l)elieve it has hardly ever been thought of as subject 
to correction. 

Hitherto it has l»eeii the endeaAor of astronomers, so far as I know, 
to secure a more tranfjui! image l)v keeping the aii in the telescope 
tube, through which the rays pass, as (|uiet as possible, and for this 
purpose the walls of tiic tube have been made nonconducting, and 
extreme j)ains hax'e l>een t;d<en not to set up currents in the lube. 
With these precautions the '•seeing" is perha})s a little better (but 
very little) than if noiu:- were used at all. the main dirticulty having been 
always found insurmounta])le. 

I ha\'(^ l)een led for some years to considin' the conditions under which 
this •• boiling'''' presents itself. It is not necessarily due to a high tem- 
perature of the (External air. for the most perfect definition I ha\'e ever 
seen of any terrestrial object was obtained l)y me long since in the 
Harvard College ()i»ser\atory at Cambi-idge. with its great e((uatorial 
telescope, when, on the hottest day that I e\'er knew in a New Kngland 
sununer. I directed it with a high power on the distant '"south mark,"" 
which 1 exp(H'ted to find almost indistinguishable from the '" boiling."'' 
I icmeniber my extreme surprise when, under a magnifying powei' of 
o'H), 1 found the im;ige as still as the lines of an (Uigi'aving. This was 
an extraordinary exc(>ption to ordinaiy experience, and led me to take

an interefst in the subject. I have since pursued an iiK^uiry to which 
this circumstance first directed my attention, and I have done so at all 
altitudes, at one time residing on ^Etna for this purpose, noting- that 
even on high mountains telescopic vision was so far from V)eing always 
clear that it was sometimes even nuich worse than at sea level. 

I have since come to the important conclusion that while the ordinary 
" )»oiling"' is due to all the air between us and the sun or star through 
which the rays pass, the greater portion of it is due to the air imme- 
diately near us, probably within a few hundred yards or even feet 
from the telescope, and this has led me to ask whether it was not pos- 
sible that some way to act upon this air could l)e found. Its nonuni- 
formity leads to deformations of the image too com];)lex to analyze here, 
which are caused not onh' by lateral vibrations of the cone of rays l)ut 
by its elongation and contraction. 

For this purpose I have, within the last few months, l)een making 
experiments at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory; tirst with 
a horizontal tube having three successive walls Avith air spaces between, 
which was intended to give the maximum security which freedom from 
changes of temperature could afford. . This observatory, being princi- 
pally concerned with rays best studied in an image formed by reflection, 
has no large dioptric telescope, on which account these experiments 
have been made with a reflector. I have no reason to suppose, how- 
ever, that they will not be equally successful with a dioptric telescope. 

A large part of the ""boiling" of the image is due to air without the 
tube, but a not unimportant part to the air within it; and in the pre- 
liminar}^ experiments the air, kept still in the tube by treating it with 
the ordinary precautions, was found to have little effect on the ordinary 
''l)oiling" of the image, which so serioush' prejudices the detinition. 
An image-forming mirror, fed by a coelostat, was placed at the end of 
this triple-walled tube, which was itself sheltered by a canvas tent and 
contained the stillest air of the most uniform temperature which could 
be obtained. The " boiling" was but little diminished merely by inclos- 
ing the beam by this tube, which was only what had been anticipated 
from the ordinary experience of all astronomers. 

The device which I had determined to try was one of a paradoxical 
character, for it proposed to substitute foi- this still air. which gave 
the usual troubled image, agitated air which it Avas hoped would give 
a still image." B^'or the purpose of this new expei'inuMit, the horizontal 
telescope using a reflector of 40 feet focus, fed by a coelostat through 
the above tube, was connected with a fan iiiii by an electric motor, 
which was arranged to draw out the air from the iinuM' tube at the 

same time that it forced air in at diffcicnt ])()iiits in its length, so as to 

^ 

"I may mention here that my laiiicnti'd I'riiMul, lleurv (.'. Draper, once showed me 
that agitating the oontentH of a hisulphide of carbon prism improved its detinition.

This first experiment g-ratifyino-ly reduced the "hoiling" and pro-

a further test, a series of artificial double stars was now jMovided, and 
the concave mirror, acting both as collimator and objective, ])rought 
the images to focus, where they were examined with an eyepiece. 
With the stillest air obtainable the images were not siiar}). and only 
the coarsest dou]>les were resolva])le. Then tho ))lower was stai'ted 
and the definition inunediatidy ])ecame sharj). \ iolently stirring the 
air in the tube, then, eliminates all or nearly all the "boiling" of the

ON THE RADIO-ACTIVITY OF MATTP:R.' 



By Henki BKCguEKKi., D. C. L.. Pli. I). 



The property })()s.s('ssed by certuiu Ixxlics of ciiiittiiiy- invisible iind 
penetrating rays was univnown six years a<i(). The speculations 
l)ronoht alxHit l»y tlie experiments of M. lioentii'en led to tlu^ exam- 
ination of material bodies to see if any of them had (lie power of emit- 
ting simihir radiations; tlic phenomenon of phos])h()rescence naturally 
was first thought of, being a known method for the transformation 
and emission of energy. This idea, however, could not be applied to 
the phenomena with which we ai'e occu|)ied, but it was xcry fruitful. 
It led to the choice, among phosphorescent bodies, of the salts of 
uranium, of which the optical constitution is remarkable on account 
of the harmonic series of the bands of their absoi'btion and phosj)hor- 
escent spectra. It was vvdiile exj)erimenting with these bodies in iSiH) 
that I first o})served the new phenomena which 1 am about to bring 
before 3'()U this e\'ening. I have here the ])lates of the double sulphate 
of uranium and potassium, obtained by Li])manirs metliod. wliicli I 
used for my iirst experiments.

198 THE KADIO- ACTIVITY OF MATTER. 

in the luhorutory several ^^ears ago, caused me to think that the phe- 
nomenon would have been the same at an}- time it might ha^'e Ijeen 
observed; it should, therefore, be permanent, that is to say, there 
should not be any appreciable weakening after a very long time. This 
is, in fact, what I have pro^'ed during the past six years. I will show 
you thehrst proof I had of the spontaneity of the rays; these ra3^s have 
traversed the black paper which covered the photographic plate, and 
a thin strip of copper in the form of a cross (lig. 1). Here, again, is 
the radiograph, made about the same time, of an aluminum medal, 
fig. li; tlie unequal absorption of the different thicknesses has caused 
the appearance of the efhgy thereon. After the \'ery iirst observation 
J observed that the new radiations would discharge electrified bodies 
at some distance in the air, a phenomenon which gives us a second 
method for studying these rays; the photographic method is specially 
qualitative, while the electrometer furnishes numerical elements of 
comparison. 

In the course of these first ol)servations, I was led away from the 
path toward which later experiments brought me back l)y several facts, 
of which the following is the principal: Having protected a photo- 
graphic plate by means of a sheet of aluminum '2 nuu. in thickness, 
and having arranged on the aluminum several samples of phosphor- 
escent powders, placed on separat(^ plates of glass, and co^'ered with 
small tubes like clock shades (fig. 3), the photographic proof, obtained 
after forty-eight hours, showed silhouettes of the plates of glass (fig. 4), 
just as if the}^ had been produced by the total refraction and reflection 
of rays identical with those of light, ])ut which nmst have traversed 
the 2 nmi. of aluminum. This photograph is unique: 1 have never 
been able to reproduce it or obtain any action with the same sample 
of sulphide of calcium, nor with any other phosphorescent pi'cparation. 
At about the same time M. Niewenglowski obtained an impression 
with sulphide of calcium, and M. Troost with hexagonal l)lende. To 
this day I do not know the cause of the activit}^ of these products or 
its disappearance. These facts, and some others, gave me the idea that 
the new rays nnght ))e a transversal movemcMit of the either analogous to 
that of light; ))ut the absence of refraction and a large numbei- of other 
experiments made me abandon this hypothesis. 

In this same year, iSiXi, 1 found that all the uranium salts emitted 
rays of n. similar nature, that the radiant ])roperty is an atomic one 
belonging to the ehMuent uranium, and electric measurements showed 
me that metallic uranium was about thre(> and a half tim(\s more active 
in ionizing air than is th(> double sulphate of uranium and i)otassium. 
The same method enables us to study the role played ))v tho gases in 
the discharge, and to observe that a sj)here of electrified uranium 
retains its charge in vacuo, while in air it loses it. The rate of the 
fall of potential is s(Misi])ly ])ro])ortional to the potential if the latter is

V, luMi this is very high. Gas renjlered conducting- In' these rays retains 
this property for some instants. Between two conductors maintained 
at constant potentials these rays set up in ;iir a continuous current. 

These experiments were taken up and elaborated by Lord Kelvin in 
l.S!»T, then by Messrs. Beattie and 8. do Smolan. In 189!> ^Nlr. Ruther- 
ford showed how the phenomena due to the conductivity communicated 
to gases by uranium, and the existence of a maximum in the current 
produced, could he explained by the hypothesis of ionization, to which 
the Ix'autiful work of Mr. J.J. Thomson has given the seal of authorit3% 

In ISDS M. Schmidt and Mnie. Curie observed, quite independently, 
that thorium has properties analogous to those of uranium, properties 
wiiich were specially examined by Mr. Owens and Mr. Rutherford. 
Mme. Curie having measured the ionizing activity of a large numlter 
of minerals containing uranium or thorium, announced the rt'markal)le 
fact that several minerals wer(^ more active than metallic uranium. 
]Vl. and ]\Iine. Curie concluded that there nuist be a more active ))ody 
than uranium in the mineral, and they undertook the task of isolating' it. 

By treating one of the most active of these minerals, A'iz,pitch})lende 
from Joaciiimstal, they first separated an active l)ismuth, to which 
they gave the name of polonium, then shortl}' afterward they obtained 
a ver}' active l)arium containing a new element, radium. 

These ])odies are prepared hy fiactional precipitations, in which one 
is guided l>y the indications of the electrometer; the activity of these 
pi'oducts is 100,000 times greater than that of uranium. 

At)out the same time M. Giesel succeeded in preparing some very 
active sul)stances, and in 1!»0() ]\I. I )ebierne announced the existence of 
a new element, actinium, about which, however, we have not heard 
many ])articulars. Of all these new bodies radium alone is character- 
ized as a new element; it has an emission spectrum consisting of lines 
which do not Ixdong to any other known l)ody, and tiie atomic w(Mght 
of the active salts of barium was found to increase* with the })ro))ortion 
of radium present. 

Tlie activity of uranium was not sufficient to excite phosphorescence 
in otiier 1)odies; M. and Mme. C-uric*. however, observed this ])henoni- 
enon with the rays from radium, and further, that the salts of radium 
were themselves luminous, their luminosity being, like their radio- 
activity, spontaneous. The activity of radium pi'oduces \arious 
clicmical reactions; it colors glass, it transforms oxygen into ozone, 
it changes white ])h<)sph()i-us to red, it ionizes not only gases but also 
liquids, such as petroleum and li((uid air. and insulating solid bodies, 
such as paraffin, de\('lo})ing in this latter body a residual conductivity 
which lasts a long time after the rays have ceased to act. It also 
causes on organic tissues sei'ious l)urns analogous to those produced 
oy X-rays. 



200 THE RADIO-ACTIVITY OF MATTER, 

The sample of rudiuni that M. and Mnie. Curie have h'lit me for the 
purpose of this leetuve enabh^s me to show y<^'ii ^ f^^v "f these phe- 
nomena — ionization of the air. himinosity, and pliosphoreseenee. 

I have observed by means of th(^ photoomph I now show (tio-. 5), 
that the radio-activity of polonium will not traverse a thin sheet of 
black paper forming- a small cylinder closed l)y aluminium or mica, 
and at the bottom of which was placed the powdered material. The 
rays from radium easily pass through this envelope. We shall see 
that still more profound differences exist l)etween these two kinds of 
YSiys. 

The radio-activity of radium restores to certain crystals and to glass 
the property of becoming phosporescent l)y heat, which th(\v have lost 
owing to a previous elevation of temperature. 

The phenomena of al)sorption, examined either by means of photog- 
raphy, ]>y phosphorescence, or by ionization of the air, showed the 
heterogeneitv of the class of radiations emitted. Sul)se([ue::t ()t)serv- 
ations have enlarged the field of this research. 

Toward the end of the year 1899 M. Giesel, and then MM. Meyer 
and Schweidler, observed that the rays of radio-active preparations 
were deviated 1)V a magnetic held in the same manner as are the 
cathodic rays. For ni}^ part, at about the same time, vrithout having 
heard of these experiments, I observed the same phenomenon with 
radium. The experiment can be made in the following manner: A 
small paper box containing a few grains of the radio-active body is 
placed horizontally on a photographic plate covered with black paper, 
between the poles of a magnet; the rays are thrown entirely to one 
side of the plate. I here show my two lirst photographs, one of which 
shows a concentration on one pole of the magnet. 

Very shortly afterwards 1 observed thatth(^ rays from Y^oloniuni are 
not deviated, and consequently that two kinds of rays exist, one (levi- 
able and the other nondeviable. M. and Mme. Curie have made an 
electric examiinition of this subject, which has proved the simultaneous 
existence of these two kinds of rays in the radio-activity of radium, 
their unequal permeability varying with the distanci^ from the absor))- 
ing screens. The accompanying photograph (tig. (i) show.s these two 
kinds of rays from i-adiun\ I have recently obser\ ed that uranium 
emits only deviable raj's — that is, saving the existence of much less 
active, nondeviable rays. In fact, there does exist a third kind of 
rays which are not deviable, but are extremely penetrating; tlu\v have 
been shown more particularly by M. Villard. 

Thus the activity of radio-active bodies c()m})ris(\s thr(H> kinds of 
rays — rays which are deviable in a magnetic field, which appear to be 
identical with cathodic rays, and two sorts of nondeviable rays, one 
kind being ver}' easily' absorbed, the other resembling X-rays and

the consequences can be veritied with th(> ureatest facility. In a uni- 
form magnetic field the trajectories perpendicular to the iield are cir- 
cumferential to the path'p which leads the rays to the point of emis- 
sion. For an oblique (^mission making an angle with the field, the 
trajectories are helices enveloping the cylinders with rays p sin a.

the. plate are al^le to traverse this same screen when it is interposed at 
a point near their source. 

These experiments leave no douht as to the identity of the devial)le 
rays with cathodic rays. However, it was necessary to prove that 
they carry charges of negative electricity, and that they are deviated 
by an electric field. 

M. and Mme. Curie, in a beautiful experiment, have shown that 
the rays of radium charge negatively the bodies that receive them, 
and that the source becomes charged positively. For this dou])lc 
experiment it is necessary that all the conductors and the source itself 
be completely enveloped in an insuliiting material, such as paraffin. 
For the active body examined the charge was 4.10^^ C. G. S. units 
per square centimeter of radiating surface per second. 

For my part, I have shown and measured the electrostatic deviation 
l)y projecting the deviated shadow of a screen placed perpendicular to 
the field, on a photographic plate. One of these apparatus is here 
shown (fig. io), as well as one of the prints obtained (fig. 11), in which 
on the two halves of the same plate ap})eiir the two deviated shadows 
corresponding to the reversal of the electric field, of which the inten- 
sity was 1.02 : 10^^ 

The l)allistic hypothesis attributes these phenomena to material 
.masses transjjorting charges of negative electricity with very great 
rapidity. Let /// be the material mass of a particle, e its charge, and 
V its velocity. We know that in a magnetic field of aii intensity 
//", the radius of curvature p of the circular trajectory is given ])y the 

equation ///:> = — v. The luunerical value of the product Ifp serves 

to siiow the charact(n- of each simi)le i-ay. On the other hand, in an 
electric field of an intensity J\ the parameter of the parabolic traject- 
ory is 1" ' The knowledge of th(\se two values gives — and v. 
With a \alue of Up = 1,550 I obtained approximately ?' = 2.21x10'", 

and ' = L.4^XlO'. These figures ai-e entirelv of the same order in

and the theoretical considerations with regard toZeeman's experiment. 

From the above figures we deduce that, from the fact of the deviable 
radio activity under consideration, there escapes from each stjuare 
centimeter of radio-active surface l.ti milligrams of matter in a thou- 
.sand million years.

THE RADIO-ACTIVITY OF MATTER. 203 

Kaufmanii has attempted to elucidate the matter. Tie comhincd. at

expei'iment. which is very difficult to perform, did not ui\'e him one 
plate tit to measur(\ For the values of T/p comprised between l.SOO 

and 4.<iO(), he found that the i-ejation ' xaried from 1.;! : lo', to 

().() : lU', and the speed r from '2.'.) : 1(>"' to L\.S : lo'". 

The ])ro()f of a reu'ular \ariatioii in the calculated relation ' is of 

/;/ 

considerable theoretical importance; if this relation was constant, as it 
seemed to l)e as ih' result of a lar^'e number of measurements, we 
might conclude that (lie slig-htly deviable rays, for which ///' is more 
than 5,000, haA'e speeds consid(M'a])ly greater than that of lieht. 

On the other hand, theoretical considerations have oiv(Mi the idea 
that the spec^l could not surpass that of the pi'opagation of eU^ctro- 
magnetic disturl)ances — that is to sa}', the speed of light — and we have 
been led to consider the mol)ile masses in a magn<»tic tield as endowed 
with a particular inertia, which is a function of the speed. Tiider 
those conditions the calculated mass ought to be appai'ent, or at least 
partly so, and it should increase indetinitely as the actual speed 
approaches that of light. The figures ])ublisii(Ml by M. Kaut'mann 
bear out this hypothesis. 

Another consequence of this manner of looking at the question 
would l)e that there should l)e continuity f)etween the deviable rays 
and those which are not, as the radius of curvature of the ti-ajectories 
l^ecomes intinite at the same time as the apparent mass. 

The photographic print alread}' mentioned (tig. 0). as well as one of 
the following ones (tig. 18), bowed, on the contrary, a \ery distinct 
discontiiuiity, although in the second one the exposure was sufficiently 
prolonged for the impression of the least active rays, snch as the 
penetrating nondeviable ones to be distinctly visible. 

This proof was obtained in (be following maimer: In the uniform 
magnetic field of a permanent magnet I placed, normally to the tield, a 
photographic plate; then on this latter I arranged screens of h^id fixed 
on a sheet of glass, as shown in iig, 12. These screens are pierced 
with openings normal to the plate, and destined to limit (he width of 
the beam; in the path of these beamslai'ianged other screens, such as 
aluminium oiu>s. l)elow the plate o^jposite a narrow slit in a strip of 
lead a small bloc;k of lead is placed ha\inga deep cavity normal to the 
plate, and in which the radiant ])ody is ])laced. ^V'e have thus a nar- 
row lineai' source normal to the plate and sev(M-al millimetei's in length. 
The cavity is covered with a thin sheet of aluminium to s(o]) the light 
rays. 

The tigure represents a section made iiorinaliy so the tield of the 
beam, of which a part is deviated. Each beam corresponding to a 
determined speed gives an impression which is noticeably curved, as if 



204 thp: kadio-activity of matter, 

the entire trajectoiy was marked on the plate. In these photographs 
the interior of the c^ylinders forming- the screens is strongly atiected 
ii}' the .secondary emission from the h^ad. The first pictnre (fig. 13) 
shows that throngh each opening there passes an infinity of raj^s, con- 
stituting portions of the yjure spectra. These meet with a strip of 
aluminium 0.1 mm. in thickness, and traverse it without deviation, 
but not all with equal facility. The slightly deviated rays are pene- 
trating, and excite secondary radiations when leaving the aluminium. 
The ver}?^ deviable rays are stopped and give rise to points afl'ected by 
an intense secondary radiation. 

One only of the two categories of nondeviable rays appears in the 
I'orm of two fine lines opposite the source; these are very penetrating- 
rays, the others were arrested quite near the source. 

Another picture (fig. 14) shows the simple beam obtained ])y a double 
sei'ies of openings: l)v one of them we can sometimes pass two distinct 
trajectories. 

The third figure is of interest*as it shows the straight beam travers- 
ing, without deviation, a sheet of aluminium placed obliqu(dy to the line 
of trajectory; and, finally, the fourth one shows the transmission of 
simple rays through aluminium, and the secondary effects they produce. 

The same method has enalded me to observe that the secondary rays 
were themselves deviated by the magnetic field in the same wa}' as 
the exciting rays. 

The radiations from radium also comprise some which are very pene- 
trating, consisting- of the least deviable and the nondeviable rays, of 
which the properties seem to be the same as Rontgen rays. These 
penetrating rays are but very slightly absorbed, and consequently 
their action on a photographic plate or on the air is ver}^ feeble, so 
that by th(^ preceding methods we can get no very exact idea of their 
intensity. If we interpose in their path a very absorbent screen, they 
ti averse it partially, l)ut at the same time they ])ecome partially trans- 
foi-nied into more absoi'bable rays. This transformation recalls that 
of fluorescence, and, through the sccondai-y action, the effect immedi- 
atel}' behind the screen is strongei- than if this latter was not there. 
The photographic plate receiving the radiations — filtered through a 
thickn(^ss of lead of 1 cm. — gives a strongei' impression through a 
sheet of lead of 1 nmi. thickness than in the uncovered regions. The 
diagram (tig. 15) shows the effect of the radiations coming from the 
sides of a leaden box after having traversed ;"> to 12 mm. of tlu^ metal. 

These secondary i)henomena may partially account for the ap})eai-ance 
of shadows given by the edges of all the trans))arent screens placed 
ovei' the photographic ])lates. 

All th(» facts I have just i-elated ha\ c exclusively to do with the 
obscure i-adiations which traverse opaque bodies, such as metal, glass, 
mica, etc. But there exists also anothei", (juite different, phenomenon, 
of which the effects are arr(\ste<l by glass and mica; they are compar-

ablr to tliosr produciMl by a vapor of a special nature. This phciioine- 
noii was (liscovored in lSl»t) ]iy Mr. Kutlierfoi'd and l»y M. and Mnic. 
Curie simultaneously. 

Mr. Kutlierford, while exaniinino- the radiations t'l'oni thorium, 
observed that, besides the ordinary rays, there was another eileet pi'o- 
duced by an "emanatiorr"' consisting of a sort of vapor ionizing the 
air. This \apor is deposited on bodies, principally those electrified 
negatively, and makes them momentarily radio-active. Mr. Ruther- 
ford made some very interesting measurements of this phenomenon. 

At the same time, M. and ]\im(\ Curie discovered that, under the 
inf1uenc(» of radiun;. bodies became temporarily radio-active. This is 
not the secondary effect already described, ])ut a persistent phenome- 
non which disappears comparatively slowly from the moment when 
the action of the I'adium ceases. M. Curie has called this "' induced 
radio-activity." and has made a \ery complete examination of it. He 
hiis observed that the phenomenon is produced with great intensity in 
a close space, that induced activity is the same on all l)odies and prac- 
tically independent of the pressure inside the inclosed space, but that 
the phenomenon is not produced if we maintain a complete vacuum l)y 
removing the gases produced; solutions of salts of radium produce the 
same eti'ect with greater intensity than the solid salts. Li(juids, water 
of crystallization extracted from active salts, or the water separated 
from an active solution by a semipermeable membrane of celluloid, 
remain strongly radio-active; it is the same with the gases. These 
excited bodies produce the same effects as radium; they emit a i)ene- 
trating ray which traverses the glass vessels which contain them and 
makes these lattei' luminous. Induced activity is gradually propagated 
in gases in a sealed tube, even through capillary tul»es and imperceptible 
cracks; bodies are excited the more as the volume of gas is greater in 
proportion to their surface. Phosphorescent l)odies become luminous 
wdien excited. In a recent work MM. Elster and (ieitel have observed 
that atmospheric air has properties analogous to those of excited gases, 
and M. Ceitel has been able to collect on win's, negativelt' electrified, 
traces of radio-active products. The cause of this radio-activity is a 
prol)lem of the greatest interest. 

Finally, there is a remarkable method of induction, which is of such 
a nature as to demand the gi-eatest res(M\(' in the conclusions which 
might be fornmlated relative to the presence of new elements in radio- 
active bodies. Evei'v inacti\'e substance which has been added to a 
solution of a uranium or I'adium salt, and which has subseciuently 
been removed by [)recipitation, has b<>come radio-active, and loses this 
radio-activity very slowly. This fact was first observed by M. Curie 
and M. Giesel, who rendered bisnmth radio-active in this manner. 
In the case of uranium, a trace of l)arium, precii)itated in the form of 
sulphate, became jiotably more active than the uranium; barium thus 
excited emits onlv deviable ravs like uranium. 



200 THE RADIO-ACTIVITY OF MATTER. 

After this precipitation the uranium salt brought back to the solid 
state is less radio-active than before; this loss of radio-activit}- can 
even be accentuated by successive operations, but the products gradu- 
all}" and spontaneously regain their original activit•\^ The temporary 
dimiiuition' of activity after solution is a general fact for salts of 
uranium and radium. With salts of actinium M. Debierne has com- 
numicated a very great activity to barium. The barium thus excited 
can be separated from inactive barium; it can be fractioned like radif- 
erous chloride of barium, the most active portions l^eing the least 
soluble in water and h3^drochloric acid. M. Debierne in this manner 
obtained a product a thousand times more active than uranium. 
Barium thus excited behaves as a false radium, but it differs from the 
true radium in the aV)sence of the spectrum and in gradually losing its 
power with time. 

Among the radio-active preparations a large number may be tem- 
porarily excited bodies. Such is the case with "polonium," which is 
apparently only excited bismuth. 

Uranium and radium are characterized by their emission spectra 
and by the stability of their radio-activity. The spontaneous growth 
that is observed in the salts deposited by the solutions " might tind an 
explanation in a phenomenon of auto-induction of the active molecules 
on the inactive one they are associated with. 

The oi'igin of the radiant energy of these radio-active bodies is still 
an enigma. By the material hypothesis it does not appear imreason- 
able, by applying the phenomenon of the evaporation of an odorifer- 
ous body to compare the emanation to a sort of gas of which the 
molecules would have masses of the same order of size as electroh'tic 
ions, and to identify the radiations with the cathodic rays resulting 
from the dislocation of these ions and causing at the same time the 
emission of X-rays. We might thus ascribe the expenditure of energy 
to the dissipation of active matter. Although this hypothesis will 
account for most of the known facts, still there does not exist any 
precise experiment which sanctions it. 

I must not, however, dwell longer on this subject, of which 1 have 
incompletely summarized the present position, by emphasizing the 
physical part, which comes more especially within my province, 
although the chemical side has given rise to work of the greatest 
interest. 

These (luestiouH have raised new h<)})es on the transformation of 
matter, B(\sides the exceptional conditions under which they enable 
us to examine the cathodic rays, they have raised, and continue to 
raise, fresh ])ro])leins every day of which the Hi'st and most mysteri- 
ous is the spontaneity of the radiations.

HISTORY OF COLD AND THK ABSOLUTE ZERO. 



By Prof. James Dewak, M. A., LL.D., D. Sc, F. R. S. 



It Wii.s Tj'ndair.s good fortune to appear before you at a moment 
when a fruitful and comprehensive idea was vivifying the wliole 
domain of scientitie thought. At the present time no such broad gen- 
eralization presents itself for discussion, while, on the othiM- iiaiid, the 
numl)er of specialized studies has enormously increased. Science is 
advancing in so Inoad a front ])y th(^ eti'orts of so great an army of 
workers that it would be idle to attemj)t, within the limits of an 
address to the most indulgent of audienc<\s, anything like a survey 
of chemistry alone. But 1 have thought it might ])e instructi\e, and 
perhaps not iminteresting, to trace briefly in broad outline the devel- 
opment of that l)ranch of study with which my own lal)ors have been 
recently more intimatel}' connected — a study which I trust I am not

it in deep Ciives or hig-h mouiitiiiiis, and when all is done wc can not 
obtain it in any gTeat degree, for furnaces of fire are far hotter than 
a summer sun, but \'aults and hills are not much colder than a winter's 
frost." The great Robert Boyle wa ; the first experimentalist who 
followed up Bacon's suggestions. In 1()82 Boyle read a paper to the 
Ro3"al Societ}' on "New experiments and observations touching cold, 
or an experimental history of cold."' pul)lisbed two years later in a 
separate work. This is really a most complete history of ever^/thing 
known about cold up to that date, but its great merit is the inclusion 
of numerous experiments made by Boyle himself on frigorific mix- 
tures and the general efi'ects of such upon m.atter. The agency chiefly 
used by Bo3'le in the conduct of his experiments was the glaciating 
mixture of snow or ice and salt. In the course of his experiments he 
made many important observations. Thus he observed that the salts 
which did not help the snow or ice to dissolve faster gave no efi'ective 
freezing. He showed that water in ))ecoming ice expands hy al)Out 
one-ninth of its volume, and bursts gun barrels. He attempted to 
counteract the expansion and prevent freezing by completely filling a 
strong iron ball with water before cooling, anticipating that it might 
burst the bottle by the stupendous force of expansion, or that if it did 
not, then the ice produced might under the circumstances be heavier 
than water. He speculated in an ingenious way on the change of 
water into ice. Thus he says, "'If cold be but a privation of heat 
through the recess of that ethereal substance which agitated the little 
eel-like particles of the water and thereby made them compose a fluid 
body, it ma}^ easily be conceived that they should I'cmain rigid in the 
postures in which the ethereal substance (putted them, and thei'eby 
compose an unfluid ])ody like ice; yet how these little eels should by 
that recess accpiire as strong an endeavor outward as if they were so 
many little springs and expand themselves with so stupendous a force, 
is that which does not so readily appear." The greatest degree of 
adventitious cold Boyle was able to produce did not make air exposed 
to its action lose a full tenth of its own volume, so that, in his own 
words, the cold does not " weaken the spring by anything neai" so con- 
siderable as one would expect." After making this remarkable obser- 
vation and conmienting upon its unexpected nature, it is strange Boyle 
did not follow it u]). He (piestions the existence of a l)ody of its own 
nature supremely cold, by ])ai'ticipating in which all other ])odies 
obtain that quality, although the docti'ine of a prinuun frigidiun had 
been accepted by many sects of philosophers; for, as he saj^s, '"if a 
body being cold signify no more than its not having its sensible parts 
so much agitated as those of our sensorium, it suffices that the sun or 
the lire or soiue other agent, whatever it weie, that agitated more 
\eheniently its parts ))efore, does either now cease to agitate them or 
agitates them but very remissh'^, so that till it be determined whether

The whole elal)orate investigation cost Boyle immense labor, and he 
confesses that he '"never handled any part of natural philosophy that 
was so troublesome and full of hardships." He looked upon his 
results l)ut as a "l)eginning'"' in this held of incpiiry, and for all the 
trouble and patience expended he consoled himself with the thought 
of "'men being oftentimes obliged to sutler as much wet and cold and 
dive as deep to fetch up sponges as to fetch up pearls." After the 
masterly essay of Boyle the attention of investigators was <'hieiiy 
directed to improving thermometrical instruments. The old air ther- 
mometer of Galileo being inconvenient to use, the introduction of 
Huid thermometers greatly aided the inquiry into the action of heat 
and cold. For a time great difhculty was encountered in selecting 
proper tixed points on the scales of such instruments, and this stinui- 
lated men like Huygens, Newton, Hooke, and Aniontons to suggest 
remedies and to conduct experiments. By the beginning of tlie eight- 
eenth century the freezing point and the boiling point of water were 
agreed upon as tixed points, and the only apparent dithculties to be 
overcome were the selection of the fluid, accurate calil)ration of the 
capillary tube of the thermometer, and a general understanding as to 
scale divisions. It must be confessed that great confusion and inac- 
curacy in temperature observations arose from the variety and crudc- 
ness of the instruments. This led Amontons in 1702-3 to contribute 
two papers to the French Academy which reveal great originality in 
the handling of the subject, and wdiich, strange to say, are not gener- 
ally known. The hi'st discourse deals witli some new proptM-ties of 
the air and the means of accurately ascertaining the temperature in 
any cliuiate. He regarded heat as due to a movement of the j)articles 
of ))odies, though he did not in any way specify the nature of the 
motion involved, and as the general cause of all terrestrial motion, so 
that in its al)sence the earth would be without movement in its smallest 
parts. The new facts he records are observations on the s})ring or 
pressure of air brought about ])v the action of heat. He shows that 
different masses of air measured at the same initial s])ring or pi-es- 
sure, when heated to th(> l)oiling point of water, acquire <Mjual incre- 
ments of spring or pressure, provided the \olume of tlu^ gas ]k\ kept 
at its initial value. Further, he proves that if the ])ressure of the 
gas before heating be doubled or tripled, then the additional s[)ring 
or ])ressure resulting from heating to the boiling |X)int of water is 
equally doubled or tripled. In other words, the ratio of the total 
spring of air at two definite and steady temperatures and at con- 
stant volume is a constant, independent of the mass or the initial 
pressure of the air in tlie thermometer. These results led to the

210 HISTORY OF COLD AND THE ABSOLUTE ZERO. 

increased perfection of the air thermometer as a standard instru- 
ment, Amontons's idea being to express the temperature at any locality 
in fractions of the degree of heat of boiling water. The great nov- 
elty of the instrument is that temperature is defined by the measure- 
ment of the length of a column of mercury. In passing, he remarks 
that we do not know the extreme of heat and cold, but that he has 
given the results of experiments which establish correspondences for 
those who wish to consider the subject. In the following 3'ear Amon- 
tons contributed to the Academy a further pa]5er extending the scope 
of the inquiry. He there pointed out more explicitly that as the 
degrees of heat in his thermometer are registered b}- the height of a 
column of mercury, which the heat is able to sustain by the spring of 
the air, it follows that the extreme cold of the thermometer will be 
that which reduces the air to have no power of spring. This, he saj^s, 
will be a much greater cold than what we call "very cold," because 
experiments have shown that if the spring of the air at ])oiling point 
is 73 inches, the degree of heat which remains in the air when l^rought 
to the freezing point of water is still very great, for it can still main- 
tain the spring of 51^ inches. The greatest climatic cold on the scale 
of units adopted by Amontons is marked 50, and the greatest summer 
heat 5S, the value for boiling water being 73, and the zero being 52 
units below the freezing point. Thus Amontons was the first to rec- 
ognize that the use of air as a thermometiic substance led to the infer- 
ence of the existence of a zero of temperature, and his scale is nothing 
else than the absolute one we are now so familitir with. It results' from 
Amontons's experiments that the air w ould have no spring left if it were 
cooled below the freezing point of water to about two and one-half times 
the temperature range which separates the T)oi]ing point and the freez- 
ing point. In other words, if we adopt the usual centessimal difference 
between these two points of temperature as 100^, then the zero of 
Amontons's air thermometer is mimis 240-. This is a i'emarkal)le 
approximation to our modern value for the same point of minus 273°. 
It has to be confessed that Amontons's valuable contribntions to knowl- 
edge met with that fate which has so often for a time overtaken the 
work of too-advanced discoverers; in other words, it was simply 
ignored, or in any case not appreciated by the scientific world either 
of that time or half a century later. It was not till Lambert, in his 
work on Pyrometrie, published in 1779, repeated Amontons's experi- 
ments and indorsed his results, that we find any further reference to 
the absolute scale or the zero of temperature. Lambert's observations 
were made with the greatest care and refinement, and resulted in cor- 
recting the \alue of the zero of the air scah^ to mimis 270' , as compared 
with Amontons's miiuis 240 . Ljind)ert points out that the degree of 
temperature which is equal to zero is what owo may call absolute cold, 
and that at this temperature the volume of the air would l)e ])ractically 
nothing. In other Avords, the particles of the air would fall together

aiul touch viivh other :iiul hrcoinc chaise like >viit(M', aiul from this it 
niiiy he inferred that the gaseous condition is caused by heat. Lam- 
bert says that Amontons' discoveries had found fcAV adherents, ])ecause 
the}' were too beautiful and advanced for the time in which he lived. 
About this time a remarka])le observation was made by Professor 
Braun at Moscow, who, during the severe winter of 17;>'.), succeeded 
in freezing men-ury ])y the use of a mixture of snow and nitric acid. 
A^^len we remember that mercury Avas regarded as (|uite a peculiar 
substance possessed of the essential (quality of fluidity, wo can easily 
understand the universal interest created by the experiment of Braun. 
This was accentuated by the ol)ser^'ations he made on the temperature 
gi\'en by the mercury tluM'mometer, whicli appeared to record a 
temperature as low as miiuis 200^ 0. The experiments were soon 
repeated b}' Plutchins at Hudson Bay, who conducted his work with 
the aid of sugg-estions gi\'en him l)v Cavendish and Black. The result 
of the new observations was to show that the freezing point of mer- 
cury is onh' minus -iO"' C, the errors in former experiments having 
been due to the great contraction of the mercury in the thermometer 
in passing into the solid state. From this it followed that the enor- 
mous natural and artiticial colds which had generally been believed in 
had no proved existence. Still the possible existence of a zero of tem- 
perature very different from that deduced from gas thermometry had 
the supi)ort of such distinguished names as those of Laplace and 
Lavoisier. In their great memoir on Heat, after making- what they 
consider reasonable hypotheses as to the relation l)etween specific heat 
and total heat, they calculate values for the zero which range from 
1,5()(» to ;;,()(I0 below melting ice. On the whole, the^^ regard the 
absolute zero as l)eing in any case 600° below the freezing point. 
Lavoisier, in his Elements of Ch(Miiistrv. published in 1702, g-oes fur- 
ther in the direction of indefinitely lowering the zero of temperature 
when he says: 

'"We are still very far from being al)le to produce the degree of 
a])solute cold, or total deprivation of heat, being unacquainted with 
any degree of coldness Avhicli we can not suppose capable of still fur- 
ther augmentation; hence it follows we are incapable of , causing- the 
ultimate particles of bodies to approach each other as near as possible, 
and thus these particles dt) not touch each other in any state hitherto 
known.'' 

Even as late as the beginning- of the nineteenth century we find Dal- 
ton, in his new system of Chemical Philosophy, giving- ten calculations 
of this value, and adopting finall}' as the natural zero of temperature 
minus 3,000- C. 

In Black's lectures we find that he takes a very cautious view with 
regard to the z(n-o of temperature, but as usual is admirably chnir with 
regard to its exposition. Thus he says: 

''AVe are ignorant of the lowest possible degree or l)eginning of 
heat. Some ingenious attempts haxe been made to estimate what it 



212 HISTORY OF COLD AND THE ABSOLUTE ZERO. 

may be, but they have not proved satisfactory. Our knowledge of 
the degrees of heat may be compared to what we shoidd huxe of a 
chain, the two ends of which were hidden from us and tlie middle only 
exposed to our view. We might put distinct marks on some of the 
links, and nmnber the rest according as they are nearest to or further 
removed from the principal links; but not knowing the distance of 
any links from the end of the chain we could not compare them 
together with respect to their distance, or say that one link was twice 
as far from the end of the chain as another." 

It is interesting to observe, however, that Black was evidently well 
acquainted with the work of Amontons and stronglj' supports his 
inference as to the nature of air. Thus, in discussing the general 
cause of vaporization, Black says that some philosophers have adopted 
the view "that every palpable elastic tliiid in nature is produced and 
preserved in this form by the action of heat. Mr. Amontons, an 
ingenious member of the late Royal Academy of Sciences, at Paris, 
was the first who proposed this idea with respect to the atmosphere. 
He supposed that it might be deprived of the whole of its elasticity 
and condensed and even frozen into a solid matter were it in our 
power to apply to it a sufficient cold; that it is a substance that dijSers 
from others by being incomparably more volatile, and which is there- 
fore converted into vapor and preserved in that form by a weaker 
heat than any that ever happened or can obtain in this globe, and 
which therefore can not appear under any other form than the one it 
now wears so long as the constitution of the woi'ld remains the same 
as at present." The views that Black attributes to Amontons have 
been generally associated with the name of Lavoisier, who practically 
admitted similar possi))ilities as to the nature of air; but it is not 
likeh^ that in such matters Black would counuit any mistake as to the 
real author of a particular idea, especially in his own department of 
knowledge. Black's own special contribution to low-temperature 
studies was his explanation of the interaction of mixtures of ice 
with salts and acids by applying the doctrine of the latent heat of 
fluidity of ice to account for the frigoritic effect. In a similar way 
Black explained the origin of the cold produced in (/ullen's remarka- 
ble experiment of the evaporation of ether under the receiver of an 
air pump by pointing out that the latent heat of vaporization in this 
case necessitated such a result. Thus, l)y applying his own discov- 
eries to latent heat, Black gave an intelligent explanation of the cause 
of all the low-temperature phenomena known in his day. 

After the gaseous laws had been delinitely fornudatod bv Ciay- 
Lussac and Dalton, the ([uestion of the absolute zero of temperature, 
as deduced from the ]iroperties of gas(\s, was revived by (^lenient and 
Desormes. These distinguished investigators presented a paper on 
the subject to the French Academy in isi^}, which, it appears, was 
rejected by that body. The authors sul)se([ueiitly elected to publish it 



HISTORY OF COLD AND THE ABSOLUTE ZERO. 213 

in 1S19. Kelyino' on Avhat we know now to have been a faulty 
hypotlie.si.s, they deduced from ol^servations on th(> hcnitino- of air 
rushing- into a \aeuuni th(» temperatui'e of niimis iJllT as that of the 
absohite zero. They further endeavored to show, by extending- to 
lower temperatures the volume or the pressure coetiicients of gases 
given by (xay-Lussac, that at the same temi)erature of minus i^67- the 
gases would contract so as to possess no appreciable volume, or, alter- 
nati^'ely. if the pressure was under consideration it would become so 
small as to be nonexistent. Although full reference is given to pre- 
vious work bearing on the same subject, yet curiously enough no 
UKMition is made of the name of Amontons. Ltcertaiidy gave remark- 
able suppoi-t to Amontons's notion of the zero to find that simple 
gases like hydrogen and compound gases like ammonia, hydrochloric, 
carbonic, and sulphui'ous acids should all ])oint to substantiallv the 
same vahu; for this tem))(M'atui'(\ IJut the most curious fact about 
this research of Clement and Desormes is that (iay-Lussac was a 
bitter op})onent of the validity of "the inferences they drew either 
from his work or their own. The mode in which (Iay-Lussac 
regarded the subject may be succinctly put as follows: A (juick 
compression of air to on(> rifth volume raises its temperature to 800 , 
and if this could be made much greater and instantaneous the temper- 
ature might rise to 1,000 or !i,000 \ Conversely, if air under five 
atmospheres were suddeidy dilated it would absorb as much heat as it 
had evolved during compression and its temperature would be low- 
ered l)y 300 . Therefoi'e if air were taken and compi'essed to 50 
atmospheres or more, the cold ])roduced by its sudden expansion 
would have no limit. In ordcn* to meet this positioii Clement and 
Desormes adopted the following reasoning: They pointed out that it 
had not been pro^'ed that (xay-Lussac was correct in his hypothesis, 
but that in any cas'.> it tacitly involves the assumption that a limited 
quantity of matter possesses an unlimited supply of heat. If this 
were the case, then heat would be uidike any other measurabh* thing or 
(juality. It is, therefore, more consistent with the course of nature to 
suppose that the amoimt of heat in a body is like the quantity of elas- 
tic riuid tilling a vess(>l, which, while definite in original amount, one 
may make less and less by getting nearer to a complete exhaustion. 
Further, to realize the at)solute zero in the on(> case is just as impos- 
sibl(» as to realize the absolute vacuum in the other; and as we do not 
doubt a z(M'o of pressure, although it is unattainable, for the same rea- 
son we ought to accept the reality of the absolute zero. We know 
now that (Jay-Lussac was wrong in supposing the increment of tem- 
perature arising from a gi\en gaseous compression would produce a 
corresponding decrement from an identical expansion. After this 
time the zero of temperature was generally recognized as a fixed ideal 
point, but in or^er to show that it was hypothetical, a distinction was

drawn between the use of the expressions zero of absokite tempera- 
ture and the absohite zero. 

The w'hole question took an entirely new form when Lord Kelvin, 
in 1848, after the mechanical equivalent of heat had been determined 
by Joule, drew attention to the great principles underlying Carnot's 
work on the Motive Power of Heat, and applied them to an absolute 
method of temperature measurement which is completely independent 
of the properties of any particular substance. The principle was that 
for a difference of 1° on this scale between the temperatures of the 
source and refrigerator, a perfect engine should give the same amount 
of work in every part of the scale. Taking the same fixed points as 
for the Centigrade scale, and making 100 of the new degrees cover 
that range, it was found that the degrees not only within that range, 
but as far beyond as experimental data supplied the means of com- 
parison, differed by only minute quantities from those of Regnault's 
air thermometer. The zero of the new scale had to be determined by 
the consideration that when the refrigerator was at the zero of temper- 
ature the perfect engine should give an amount of work equal to the 
full mechanical equivalent of the heat taken up. This led to a zero of 
273° below the temperature of freezing water, substantially the same 
as that deduced from a stud}^ of the gaseous state. It was a great 
advance to demonstrate by the application of the laws of thermody- 
namics not only that the zero of temperature is a reality, but that it 
must be located at 273° below the freezing point of water. As no one 
has attempted to impugn the solid foundation of theory and experi- 
ment on which Lord Kelvin based his thermodynamic scale, the exist- 
ence of a definite zero of temperature must be acknowledged as a 
fundamental scientific fact. 

LIQUEFACTION OF GASES AND CONTINUITY OF STATE. 

In these speculations, however, chemists were dealing theoretically 
with temperatures to which the}^ could not make any but the most dis- 
tant experimental approach. Cullen, the teacher of Black, had indeed 
shown how to lower temperature by the evaporation of volatile bodies, 
such as ether, by the aid of the air pump, and the later experiments of 
Leslie and Wollaston extended the same principle. Davy and Faraday 
made the most of the means at command in liquefying the more con- 
densable gases, while at the same time Davy pointed out that the}^ in 
turn might be utilized to procure greater cold l)v their rapid recon- 
version into the aeriform state. Still the chemist was sorely hampered 
by the want of some powerful and accessible agent for the production 
of temperatures nuich lower than had ever been attained. That want 
was supplied by Thilorier, wdio in 1835 produced li(|uid carbonic acid 
in large quantities, and further made the fortunate discovery that the 
li(|uid could be frozen into a snow ))v its own exaporation. Faraday 
was prompt to take advantage of this new and potent agent. Under 



HISTORY OF COLD AND THE ABSOLUTE ZEEO. 215 

exhaustion he lowered its boilino- point from minus 7(S^ C. to minus 
110 ' C, and by (•oni))ining this low temperature with pressure all the 
gases were liquetied b}- the year 1841, with the exception of the three 
elementary gases — hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen, and three com- 
pound gases — carbonic oxide, marsh gas, and nitric oxide. Andrews, 
some twenty-tive years after the work of Faraday, attempted to induce 
change of state in the uncondensed gases by using much higher pres- 
sures than Farada}" employed. Combining the temperature of a solid 
carbonic acid bath with pressures of 30(» atmospheres, Andrews found 
that none of these gases exhibited any appearance of liquefaction in 
such high states of condensation; but so far as change of volume 
by high compression went, Andrews confirmed the earlier work of 
Natterer ))y showing that the gases become proportionately less com- 
pressible with growing pressure. While such investigations were 
proceeding, Regnault and Magnus had completed their refined inves- 
tigations on the laws of Boyle and Gay-Lussac. A very important 
series of experiments was made by Joule and Kelvin ''On the thermal 
efi'ects of fluids in motion " al)out 1862, in which the thermometrical 
eflects of passing gases under compression through porous plugs fur- 
nished important data for the study of the mutual action of the gas 
molecules. No one, however, had attempted to make a complete study 
of a liquefiable gas throughout wide ranges of temperature. This was 
accomplished by Andrews in 1869, and his Bakerian lecture ''On the 
continuity of the gaseous and liquid states of matter" will always be 
regarded as an epoch-making investigation. During the course of this 
research Andrews observed that liquid carbonic acid raised to a 
temperature of 31^ C. lost the sharp concave surface of demarcation 
between the liquid and the gas, the space being now occupied by a 
homogeneous fluid which exhibited, when the pressure was suddenly 
diminished or the temperature slightly lowered, a peculiar appearance 
of moving or flickering striae, due to great local alterations of density. 
At temperatures above 31'^ C. the separation into two distinct kinds 
of matter could not be eflected even when the pressure reached 400 
atmospheres. This limiting temperature of the change of state from 
gas to liquid Andrews called the critical temperature. He showed 
that this temperature is constant, and difi'ers with each substance, and 
that it is alwa^'s associated with a definite pressure peculiar to each 
bod}^ Thus the two constants, critical temperature and pressure, 
which have been of the greatest importance in subsequent investiga- 
tions, came to be defined, and a complete experimental proof was 
given that "the gaseous and liquid states are only distinct stages of 
the same condition of matter and are capable of passing into one 
another by a process of continuous change." 

In 1873 an essay '"On the continuity of the gaseous and li([uid state," 
full of new and suggestive ideas, was published by van der Waals, who, 
recognizing the value of Clausius's new conception of the virial in 



216 HISTORY OF COLD AND THE ABSOLUTE ZERO. 

dynamics, for a long-continued series of motions, either oscillator3^ or 
changino- exceedingly slowly with time, applied it to the consideration 
of the molecular movements of the particles of the gaseous substance, 
and after much retined investigation, and the fullest experimental 
calculation available at the time, devised his well-known equation of 
continuity. Its paramount merit is that it is based entirely on a 
mechanical foundation, and is in no sense empiric; we may therefore 
look upon it as having a secure foundation in fact, but as being capable 
of extension and improvement. James Thomson, realizing that the 
straight-line breach of continuous curvature in the Andrews isother- 
mals was untenable to the physical mind, propounded his emendation 
of the Andrews curves — namely, that they were continuous and of S 
form. AVe also owe to James Thomson the conception and execution 
of a three-dimensional model of Andrews's results, which has been of 
the greatest service in exhibiting the three variables by means of a 
specific surface afterwards greatly extended and developed by Prof. 
Willard Gibbs. The suggestive work of James Thomson undoubt- 
edly was a valuable aid to van der Waals, for as soon as he reached the 
point where his equation had to show the continuity of the two states 
this was the first difficulty he had to encounter, and he succeeded in 
giving the explanation. He also gave a satisfactory reason for the 
existence of a minimum value of the product of volume and pressure 
in the Regnault isothermals. His isothermals, with James Thomson's 
completion of them, were now shown to be the results of the laws of 
dynamics. Van der Waals applied the new equation to the considera- 
tion of the coefficients of expansion with temperature and of pressure 
with temperature, showing that although they were nearl}^ equal, nev- 
ertheless they were almost independent quantities. His investigation 
of the capillarity constant was masterly, and he added further to our 
knowledge of the magnitudes of the molecules of gases and of their 
mean free paths. Following up the experiments of Joule and Kelvin, 
he showed how their cooling coefficients could be deduced, and proved 
that they vanished at a temperature in each case which is a constant 
multiple of the specific critical temperature. The equation of conti- 
nuity developed by van der Waals involved the use of three constants 
instead of one, as in the old law of Boyle and Charles, the latter ))eing 
only utilized to express the relation of temperature, pressure, and 
volume, when the gas is far removed from its point of liquefaction. 
Of the two new constants one represents the molecular pressure aris- 
ing from the attraction between the molecules, the other four times 
the volume of the molecules. Given these constants of a gas, van der 
Waals showed that his equation not only fitted into the general char- 
acters of th(> isothermals, but also gave the Aalues of the critical tem- 
perature, the critical pressure, and the critical volume. In the case 
of carbonic acid the theoretical results were found to be in remarkable

agreement with the experimental values of Andrews. Tliis o-ave 
chemists the means of ascertainino- the critical constants, provided suf- 
ficiently accurate data derived from the study of a few ])roperly dis- 
tributed isothermals of the gaseous substance were available. Such 
important data came into the possession of chemists when Amagat 
pul)lishcd his valuable paper on "The isothermals of hydrogen, nitro- 
gen, oxygen, ethylene, etc.,'"' in the year 18.S0. It now l)ecame possi- 
ble to calculate the critical data with comparative accuracy for the 
so-calk'd piM'manent gases oxygen and nitrogen, and this was done l)y 
Sari-au in ISS'i. Jn the meantime a great impulse had been given to a 
further attaclc upon the so-called permanent gases by the suggestive 
experiments made by Pictet and Cailletet. The static lic[uefaction of 
oxygen was efl'ected by Wroblewski in 1883, and thereby the theo- 
retical conclusions derived from van der Waals's ecpiation were su))- 
stantially confirmed. The liquefaction of oxygen and air was achieved 
through the use of liquid ethylene as a cooling agent, which enabled a 
temperature of minus l-to'^ to be maintained l)y its steady evaporation 
in vacuo. From this time liquid oxygen and air came to l)e regarded 
as the potential cooling agents for future research, commanding as 
they did a temperature of 200'^ below melting ice. The theoretical 
side of the question received at the hands of van der Waals a second 
contribution, which was even more important than his original essay, 
and that was his novel and ingenious development of what he calls 
""The theory of corresponding states." He defined the corresponding 
states of two sul>stances as those in which the ratios of the tempera- 
ture, pressure, and volume to the critical temperature, pressure, and 
volume, respectively, were the same for the two substances, and in cor- 
responding states he showed that the three pairs of ratios all coincided. 
From this a series of remarkable propositions were developed, some 
new, some proving previous laws that were hitherto only empiric, 
and some completing and correcting faidty though approximate laws. 
As examples, he succeeded in calculating the boiling point of carbonic 
acid from observations on ether vapor, proved Kopp's law of molec- 
ular volumes, and showed that at corresponding temperatures the 
molecular latent heats of vaporization are proportional to the absolute 
critical temperature, and that under the same conditions the coeffi- 
cients of liquid expansion are inversely proportional to the absolute 
critical temperature, and that the coefficients of liquid compressibility 
are inversely proportional to the critical pressure. All these proposi- 
tions and deductions are in the main correct, though further experi- 
mental investigation has shown minor discrepancies requiring expla- 
nation. Various proposals have ^been made to supplement van der 
Waals's equation so as to bring it into line with experiments, some 
being entirely empiric, others theoretical. Clausius, Sarrau, Wro- 
blewski, Batteli,> and others attacked the question empirically, and in

the main preserv^ed the co-vohmie (depending- on the total xolimie of 
the molecules) unaltered while trying- to niodif}" the constant of molec- 
ular attraction. Their success depended entirely on the fact that, 
instead of limiting the number of constants to three, some of them 
have increased them to as many as ten. On the other hand, a series 
of very remarkable theoretical investigations has been made by van 
der Waals himself, l)y Kammerlingh Onnes, Korteweg, Jaeger, Boltz- 
mann, Dieterici, and ileinganum, and others, all directed in the main 
toward an admitted variation in the value of the co-volume while pre- 
serving the molecular attraction constant. The theoretical deductions 
of Tait lead to the conclusion that a substance below its critical point 
ought to have two different equations of the van der Waals type, 
one referring to the liquid and the other to the gaseous phase. One 
important fact was soon elicited — namely, that the law of correspond- 
ence demanded only that the equation should contain not more than 
three constants for each body. The simplest extension is that made 
by Reinganum, in which he increased the pressure for a given mean 
kinetic energ}" of the particles inversely in the ratio of the diminution of 
free volume, due to the molecules possessing linear extension. Eerthelot 
has shown how a " reduced" isothermal may be got by taking two other 
prominent points as units of measurement instead of the critical 
coordinates. The most suggestive advance in the improvement of the 
van der Waals equation has been made by a lady, Mme. Christine 
Meyer. The idea at the base of this new development may be under- 
stood from the following general statement: van der Waals brings the 
van der Waals surfaces for all substances into coincidence at the point 
where volume, pressure, and temperature are nothing, and then 
stretches or compresses all the surfaces parallel to the three axes of 
volume, pressure, and temperature until their critical points coincide. 
But on this plan the surfaces do not quite coincide, ))ecause the points 
where the three variables are respectively nothing- are not correspond- 
ing points. Mme. Meyer's plan is to bring all the critical points first 
into coincidence, and then to compress or extend all the representative 
surfaces parallel to the three axes of volume, pressure, and temperature 
until the surfaces coincide. In this wav, takmg twenty-nine different 
substances, she completel}' verifies from experiment van der Waals's 
law of correspondence. The theory of van der Waals has been one of 
the greatest importance in directing experimental uivestigation and in 
attacking the difficult pro])lemsof the li(]ucfaction of the most perma- 
nent gases. One of its greatest triumphs has been the proof that the 
critical constants and the boiling point of hydrogen theoretically 
deduced by Wroblewski from a study of the isothermals of the gas 
taken far above the temperature of li(|uef action are remarkably near 
the experimental values. We may safely infer, therefore, that if here- 
after a gas be discovered m small (quantity even four times more volatile

than li([iiid hydrogen, yet by a study of its isotherinals at low tein])er 
aturc we shall succeed in tinding- its most important Tuiuid constants, 
althoui^h the isolation of the real liquid may for tlu^ time he impossible. 
It is perhaps not too much to say that as a prolitic source of knowledg-e 
in the department dealini>- with the continuity of state in matter, it 
would be necessary to go l)ack to Carnot's c^'^cle to find a proposition 
of greater importance thaji the theory of van der Waals and his devel- 
opment of the law of corresponding states. 

It will be apparent from what has just been said that, thanks to th(^ 
labors of Andrews, van der Waals, and others, theory had again far 
outrun experiment. We could calculate the constants and predict 
some of the simple physical characteristics of liquid oxygen, hydrogen, 
or nitrogen with a high degree of confidence long before any one of 
the three had been obtained in the static liquid condition permitting of 
the experimental verification of the theory. This was the more tanta- 
lizing, because, with whatever confidence the chemist may anticipate 
the substantial corroboration of his theory, he also anticipates with 
almost e(|ual conviction that as he ap])roaches more and more nearly to 
the zero of absolute temperature he will encounter phenomena com- 
pelling modification, revision, and refinement of formulas which fairly 
covered the facts previously known. Just as nearh^ sev^enty years ago 
chenusts were waiting for some means of getting a temperature of 100-' 
below melting ice, so ten years ago they wei'e casting about for the 
means of going 100'- lower still. The difficulty, it need hardly l)e said, 
increases in a geometrical rather than in an arithmetical ratio. Its 
magnitude ma}^ be estimated from the fact that to produce liquid air 
in the atmosphere of an ordinary laborator}^ is a feat analogous to the 
production of licjuid water starting from steam at a white heat and 
working with all the implements and surroundings at the same high 
temperature. The problem was not so much liow to produce intense 
cold as how to save it when produced from being immediately leveled 
up by the relativel}' superheated surroundings. Ordinary nonconduct- 
ing packings were inadmissible because they are both cumbrous and 
o})aque, while in working near the limits of our resources it is essential 
that th(» product should be visible and readily handled. It was while 
puzzling over this mechanical and manipulatiNe difficulty in 18*J2 that it 
occurred to me that the principle of an arrangement used nearly twenty 
years before in some calorimetric experiments." which was based upon 
the work of Dulong and Petit on radiation, might be employed with 
advantage as well to protect cold substances from heat as hot ones from 
rapid cooling. I therefore tried the efi'ect of keeping liquefied gases in 
vessels having a double wall, the annular space between l)eing very 
highly exhausted.'' Experiments showed that liquid air evaporated at

220 HISTORY OF COLD AND THE ABSOLUTE ZERO. 

only one-tifth of the rate i)revailin<4- when it was placed in a similar 
unexhausted vessel, owing to the convective transference of heat by 
the gas particles being enormously reduced })y the high vacuum. But, 
in addition, these vessels lend themselves to an arrangement b}' which 
radiant heat can also be cut off. It was found that when the inner 
walls were coated with a bright deposit of silver the influx of heat was 
diminished to one-sixth the amount entering without the metallic coat- 
ing. The total effect of the high vacuum and the silvering is to reduce 
the ingoing heat to about 3 per cent. The efficiency of such vessels 
depends upon getting as high a vacuum as possible, and cold is one of 
the best means of effecting the desired exhaustion. All that is iieces- 
sar}^ is to fill completel}^ the space that has to be exhausted with an easily 
condensable vapor, and then to freeze it out in a receptacle attached 
to the primary vessel that can be sealed off'. The advantage of this 
method^ is that no air pumy) is required and that theoretically there is 
i\o limit to the degree of exhaustion that can be obtained. The action 
is rapid, provided liquid air is the cooling agent, and vapors like mer- 
cury, water, or benzol are employed. It is obvious that when we 
have to deal with such an exceptionally volatile liquid as hydrogen, 
the vapor filling may be omitted because air itself is now an easily 
condensable^ vapor. In other words, liquid hydrogen, collected in 
such vessels with the annular space full of air, immediately solidi- 
ties the air and thereby surrounds itself with a high A-acuum. In the 
same way, when it shall be possible to collect a liquid boiling on the 
absolute scale at about 5°, as compared with the 20^ of hydrogen, then 
you might have the annular space filled with the latter gas to begin 
with, and yet get directly a very high vacuum, owing to the soliditica- 
tion of the hydrogen. Many combinations of vacuum vessels can be 
arranged, and the lower the temperature at which we have to operate 
the more useful they become. Vessels of this kind are now in general 
use, and in them liquid air has crossed the American continent. Of the 
various forms, that variety is of special importance which has a spiral 
tube joining the bottom part of the walls, so that any liquid gas may 
be drawn off' from the interior of such a vessel. In the working of 
regenerative coils such a device becomes all important, and such special 
vessels can not ])e dispensed with for the liquefaction of hydrogen. 

In the early experiments of Pictet and Cailletet, cooling was i)ro- 
duced by the sudden expansion of the highly compressed gas preferably 
at a low temperature, the former using a jet that lasted for some time, 
the latter an instantaneous adiabatic expansion in a strong glass tube. 
Neither process was practicable as a mode of producing liquid gases, 
but both gave valuable indications of partial change into the liquid 
state by the pi'oduction of a temporary mist. Lindc, however, saw 
that the continuous use of a jet of highly compressed gas, combined 
with regenerative cooling, must lead to liquefaction on account of what 
is called the Kelvin-Joule effect; and he succeeded in making a machine, 



HISTORY OF COLD AND THE ABSOLUTE ZERO. 221 

based on tlii.s princii)lo, capable of })r()diu'ino- li((ui(l air for industrial 
purposes. These experimenters, had proved that, ovviny' to niolecuhir 
attraction, compressed gas(es passing through a porous plug or small 
aperture were lowered in temperature l)y an amount depending on the 
difference of pressure and inversely as the square of the absohite tem- 
perature. This means that for a steady difference of pressure the 
cooling is greater the lower the temperature. The only gas that did 
not show cooling under such conditions was hydrogen. Instead of 
being cook'd it became actually hotter. The reason for this apparent 
anomaly in the Kelvin-Joule effect is that every gas has a thermometric 
point of inversion above which it is heated and lielow which it is 
cooled. This inversion point, according to van der Waals, is six and 
three-quarter times the critical point. The efficiency of the Linde 
process depends on working with highly compressed gas well below 
the inversion temperature, and in this res})ect this point may be said 
to take the place of tiie critical one, when in the ordinary way direct 
rK[uefaction is Ijeing effected by the use of si)eciffc liquid cooling 
agents. The success of both processes depends upon working within 
a certain temperature range, only the Linde method gives us a much 
Avider range of temperature within which liijuefaction can be effected. 
This is not the case if, instead of depending on getting cooling by the 
internal work done ])y the attraction of the gas molecules, we force 
the compressed gas to do external work as in the well-known air 
machines of Kirk and Coleman. Both these inventors have pointed 
out that there is no liujit of temperature, short of liquefaction of the 
gas in use in the circuit, that such machines are not capable of giving. 
While it is theoretically clear that such machines ought to be capable 
of maintaining the lowest temperatures, and that with th(> least 
ex})enditure of power, it is a very different matter to overcome the 
l)ractical difficulties of working such machines under the conditions. 
Coleman kei)t a machine didivering air at minus S?>'- for hours, but 
he did not carry his experiments any further, Kecently M. Claude, 
of I'aris, has, however, succeeded in working a machine of this tj])G 
so efficiently that he has managed to produce 1 liter of li(|ui(l air per 
horsejwwer expended per hour in the running of the engine. This 
()u(])ut is twice as good as that givtMi l)y thv Linde machine, and there 
is no reason to doubt that tlie yiehl will be still furtluM' improved. It 
is clear, therefore, that in the innncHliate t'utui'c the production of 
liciuid air and hydrogen will b(> effected most economically by the use 
of machines producing cold by the expenditure of mechanical work. 

LiyUH> HYDROCEN AND HELILTM. 

To the physicist the copious ])ro(luction of li(|uid aii- by the methods 
described was of peculiar intei'cst and value as affording the means of 
attacking the far iilore dithcult |)roblem of the liquefaction of hydro- 
gen, and even as encouraging th(> hope that liquid hydrogen might in

tiuie be emplo^^ed for the liquefaction of yet more ^•olatile elements, 
apart from the importance which its liquefaction must hold in the 
process of the stead}^ advance toward the absolute zero. Hydrogen is 
an element of especial interest, because the study of its properties and 
chemical relations led great chemists like Farada}^ Dumas, Daniell, 
Graham, and Andrews to entertain the view that if it could ever be 
brought into the state of liquid or solid it would reveal metallic char- 
acters. Looking to the special chemical relations of the comljined 
hydrogen in water, alkaline oxides, acids, and salts, together with the 
behavior of these substances on electrolysis, we are forced to conclude 
that hydrogen liehaves as the analogue of a metal. After the beautiful 
discovery of Graham that palladium can absorb some hundreds of times 
its own volume of hydrogen, and still retain its luster and general 
metallic character, the impression that hydrogen was probabh^ a mem- 
ber of the metallic group became ver}^ general. The only chemist who 
adopted another view was my distinguished predecessor, Professor 
Odling. In his Manual of Chemistr3% published in 1861, he pointed 
out that hydrogen has chlorous as well as basic relations, and that they 
are as decided, important, and frequent as its other relations. From 
such considerations he arrived at the conclusion that hydrogen is essen- 
tially a neuti'al or intermediate body, and therefore we should not 
expect to find liquid or solid hydrogen possess the appearance of a 
metal. This extraordinary prevision, so characteristic of Odling", 
was proved to ])c correct some thirty-seven years after it was 
made. Another curious anticipation was made by Dumas, in a letter 
addressed to Pictet, in which he says that the metal most analogous to 
h3^drogen is magnesium, and that probably both elements have the 
same atomic volume, so that the density of hydrogen, for this reason, 
would be al)out the value elicited by subsequent experiments. Later 
on, in 1872, when Newlands began to arrange the elements in periodic 
groups, he regarded hydrogen as the low^est member of the chlorine 
family; but Mendeleef, in his later classification, placed hydrogen in 
the group of the alkaline metals; on the other hand, Dr. Johnstone 
Stoney classes hydrogen with the alkaline earth metals and magne- 
sium. From this speculative divergenc}^ it is clear no definite con- 
clusion could be reached regarding the j^hysical properties of liquid 
or solid hydrogen, and the only way to arrive at the truth was to 
prosecute low^-temperature research until success attended the efiorts 
to produce its liquefaction. This result I definitely obtained in 1898. 
The case of liquid hj^drogen is, in fact, an excellent illustration of the 
truth alread}' referred to, that no theoretical forecast, however 
apparently justified by analogy, can ])c finally accepted as true until 
confirmed by actual experiment. Licjuid hy<lrogen is a colorless trans- 
parent })ody of extraordinary intrinsic interest. It has a clearly 
defined surface, is easiW seen, di'o\)s well, in spite of the ftu't that its

surface tension is only tho thirty-tiftli part of that of water, or about 
one-tifth that of li([ui(l air, and can be poured easily fi-oni vessel to 
vessel. The lii^uid does not conduct electricity, and. if anything, is 
slightly diamagnetic. Compared with an equal volume of liquid air, 
it requires only one-tifth the quantity of heat for vaporization; on the 
other hand, its specilic h(>at is six times that of liquid air or three times 
that of water. The coefficient of expansion of the fluid is remarkable, 
l)eing al)()ut ten times that of the gas. It is 1)y far the lightest liquid 
known to exist, its density being only one-fourteenth that of water. 
The lightest licfuid pre\iously known was rujuid marsh gas, which is 
six times heavier. The only solid wliich has so sn)all density as to 
float upon its surface is a picM-e of pith wood. It is by far the coldest 
liquid known. At ordinary atmospheric pressure it boils at minus 
252..5- or 20. o absolute. The critical point of the liquid is from 
30* to 82 absolute, and the critical pressure not more but probably 
less than fifteen atmospheres. The vapor of the hydrogen arising 
from the liquid has nearly the density of air ; that is, it is fourteen 
times that of the gas at the ordinary temperatui-e. Reduction of 
the pressure by an air pump brings down the t(Mnp(>rature to minus 
258 , when the liquid ])ecomes a solid reseml)ling frozen foam, and 
this l»y further exhaustion is cooled to minus 259.. 5" or 13.5 absolute, 
which is the lowest steady temperature that has been reached. The 
solid may also be got in the form of a clear transparent ice, melting 
at about 15 alisolute, under a pressure of 55 mm., possessing the 
unique densitv of one-tenth that of water. Such cold involves the 
soliditication of every gaseous substance but one that is at present 
definitely known to the chemist, and so liquid hydrogen introduces the 
investigator to a world of solid l)odies. The contrast between this 
refrigerating sul)stance and liquid air is most remarka])le. On the 
removal of the loose plug of cotton wool used to cover the mouth of 
the vacuum A'essel in which it is stored, the action is followed by a 
miniature snowstorm of solid air. formed by tho freezing of the atmos- 
phei-e at the point where it comes into contact with the cold vapor 
rising from the liquid. This solid air falls into the vessel and 
accumulates as a white snow at the 1)ottom of the li([uid hydrogen. 
When the outside of an ordinary t(?st tube is cooled by innnersion in 
the liquid, it is soon observed to fill up with solid air, and if the tube 
be now lifted out a doulde effect is visible, for liquid air is produced 
both in the inside and on the outside of the tube — in the one case b}^ 
the melting of the solid and in the other by condensation from the 
atmosphere. A tuft of cotton wool soaked in the liquid and then held 
near the pole of a strong magn(>t is attract(>d, and it might be inferred 
therefrom that Tuiuid hydrogen is a magnetic body. This, however, 
is not the case. The atti'action is due neithin- to tlu; cotton wool nor 
to the hydrogen — which indeed cvaporat(\s almost as soon as the tuft 



224 HISTOEY OF COLD AND THE ABSOLUTE ZERO. 

is taken out of the liquid — but to the oxygen of the air, which is 
well known to be a magnetic body, frozen in the wool by the extreme 
cold. 

The strong condensing powers of liquid hydrogen afford a simple 
means of producing vacua of very high tenuity. When one end of a 
sealed tube containing ordinary air is placed for a short time in the 
liquid, the contained air accumulates as a solid at the bottom, while 
the higher part is almost entirely deprived of particles of gas. So 
perfect is the vacuum thus formed, that the electric discharge can ])e 
made to pass only with the greatest difficulty. Another important 
application of liquid air, liquid hydrogen, etc., is as analj'tic agents. 
Thus, if a gaseous mixture be cooled b}^ means of liquid oxygen only 
those constituents will be left in the gaseous state which are less con- 
densable than oxygen. Similarl}^, if this gaseous residue be in its 
turn cooled in liquid hydrogen a still further separation will be 
effected, ever3^thing that is less volatile than hydrogen being con- 
densed to a liquid or solid. By proceeding in this fashion it has 
been found possible to isolate helium from a mixture in which it is 
present to the extent of only one part in one thousand. By the 
evaporation of solid h3^drogeu under the air pump we can reach 
within 13° or 14° of the zero, but there or thereabouts our progress 
is barred. This gap of 13° might seem at first sight insignificant in 
comparison with the hundreds that have already been conquered. 
But to win one degree low down the scale is quite a different matter 
from doing so at higher temperatures. In fact, to annihilate these few 
remaining degrees would be a far greater achievement than any so 
far accomplished in low-temperature research. For the difficulty is 
twofold, having to do partly with process and partly with mate- 
rial. The application of the methods used in the liquefaction of 
gases becomes continually harder and more troublesome as the working 
temperature is reduced; thus, to pass from liquid air to liquid hydro- 
gen — a difference of 60° — is, from a thermodynamic point of view, as 
difficult as to bridge the gap of 150° that separates liquid chlorine and 
liquid air. By the use of a new liquid gas exceeding hydrogen in vola- 
tility to the same extent as hydrogen does nitrogen, the investigator 
might get to within 5° of the zero; but even a second hypothetical 
substance, again exceeding the first one in volatility to an equal extent, 
would not suffice to bring him quite to the point of his ambition. 
That the zero will ever be reached by man is extremely improbable. 
A thermometer introduced into regions outside the uttermost confines 
of the earth's atmosphere might approach the absolute zero, provided 
that its parts were highly transparent to all kinds of radiation; other- 
wise it would be affected b}^ the radiation of the sun, and would there- 
fore become heated. But supposing all difficulties to be overcome, 
and the experimenter to be able to reach within a few degrees of the

zero, it is ])y no ineiins certain tiiat he would find tlie near apj)rotieh 
of the death of matter sometimes pictured. An}- forecast of the phe- 
nomena that would 1)0 seen nuist be l)ased on the assumption that 
there is continuity l)etween the processes studied at attainable temper- 
atures and those which take place at still lower ones. Is such an 
assumption justitied? It is true that many chanoes in the properties 
of substances have been found to vary steadil\' with the degree of cold 
to which thev are exposed. But it would be rash to take for granted 
that the changes wdiich have been traced in explored regions continue 
to the same extent and in the same direction in those which are as yet 
unexplored. Of such a In-eakdown low-temperature I'csearch has 
already yielded a direct proof at least in one case. A series of experi- 
ments with pure metals showed that their electrical resistance gradu- 
ally decreases as they are cooled to lower and lower temperatures, in 
such ratio that it appeared probal)le that at the zero of absolute tem- 
perature they w^ould have no resistance at all and would become perfect 
conductors of electricity. This was the inference that seemed justifi- 
able ])y o])servations taken at depths of cold which can ])e obtained I)}' 
means of liquid air and less powerful refrigerants. But with the 
advent of the more powerful refrigerant liquid hydrogen it became 
necessary to revise that conclusion. A discrepancy was tirst observed 
when a platinum resistance thermometer was used to ascertain the 
temperature of that liquid ])oiling under atmospheric and reduced 
pressure. All known liquids, when forced to evaporate quicklv by 
being placed in the exhausted receiver of an air pump, undergo a 
reduction in temperature, but when hydrogen was treated in this wa}' 
it appeared to l)e an exception. The resistance thermometer showed 
no such reduction as was expected, and it became a question whether 
it was the h^'drogen or the thermometer that was behaving abnormallj'. 
ritimately. ])y the adoption of other thermometrical appliances, the 
temperature of the hydrogen was proved to be lowered bv exhaustion, 
as theory indicated. Hence it was the platinum thermometer which 
had broken down; in other words, the electrical resistance of the metal 
employed in its construction was not, at temperatures about minus 
250'- C, decreased I)}' cold in the same proportion as at temperatures 
about minus 200 . This being the case, there is no longer an}^ reason 
to suppose that at the absolute zero platinum would become a perfect 
conductor of electricity; and in view of the similarity between the 
behavior of platinum and that of other pure metals in respect of tem- 
perature and conductivity, the presumption is that the same is true of 
them also. At any rate, the knowledge that in the case of at least one 
property of matter we have succeeded in attaining a depth of cold 
sufficient to bring about unexpected change in the law expressing the 
variation of that propert}" with temperature, is sufficient to show the 

6M 1902 — ^15 



226 HISTORY OF COLD AND THE ABSOLUTE ZEEO. 

the necessity for extreme caution in extending our inferences regard- 
ing the properties of matter near the zero of temperature. I^ord 
Kelvin evident!}" anticipates t':c possibility of more remarkable elec- 
trical properties being met Avith in the metals near the zero. A theo- 
retical investigation on the relation of "electrions" and atoms has led 
him to suggest a hypothetical metal having the following remarkable 
properties: Below 1 absolute it is a perfect insulator of electricity; 
at 2'-^ it shows noticeable conductivity, and at 6° it possesses high con- 
ductivity. It ma}' safely be predicted that liquid hydrogen will l)e 
the means l)y which many obscure problems of physics and chemistry 
will ultimately be solved, so that the liquefaction of the last of the old 
permanent gases is as pregnant now with future consequences of great 
scientific moment as was the liquefaction of chlorine in the early years 
of the last century. 

The next step toward the absolute zero is to tind another gas more 
volatile than hydrogen, and that we possess in the gas occurring in 
clevite, identified by Ramsay as helium, a gas which is widely distrib- 
uted, like hydrogen, in the sun, stars, and nebuki?. A specimen of 
this gas was subjected by Olszewski to liquid air temperatures, com- 
bined with compression and subsequent expansion, following the 
Cailletet method, and resulted in his being unable to discover any 
appearance of liquefaction, even in the form of uiist. His experi- 
ments led him to infer that the boiling point of the substance is proli- 
ably below 9 -' absolute. After Lord Rayleigh had found a new source 
of helium in the gases which are derived from the Bath springs, and 
liquid hydrogen became available as a cooling agent, a specimen of 
helium cooled in liquid hydrogen showed the formation of fluid, but 
this turned out to be owing to the presence of an unknown admixture 
of other gases. As a matter of fact, a year before the date of this 
experiment I had recorded indications of the presence of unknown 
gases in the spectrum of helium derived from this source. When sub- 
sequently such condensable constituents were removed, the purified 
helium showed no signs of liquefaction, even when compressed to SO 
atmospheres, while the tube containing it was surrounded with solid 
hydrogen. Further, on suddenly expanding, no instantaneous mist 
appeared. Thus helium was definitely proved to be a much more 
volatile substance than hydrogen in either the liquid or solid condition. 
The inference to l)e drawn from the adiabatic expansion etfected 
under the circumstances is that helium must have touched a temper- 
ature of from 9° to 10^ for a short time without showing any signs 
of liquefaction, and consequently that the critical point must be still 
lower. This would force us to anticipate that the Ijoiling point of the 
liquid will be about 5° absolute, or liquid helium will l)e four times 
more vohitile than liquid hydrogen, just as liquid hydrogen is four 
times more volatile than liciuid air. Although the liquefaction of the

giis is ji pro])l(Mn for the futur(\ this does not prevent us from antiei- 
])at'mi;- some of th(^ pnyperties of the liuid body. It would ))e twice 
as dense as liquid liydroj^-eu if the ratio of the critical constants has 
the same value as in the case of h^'drogen — that is to say, the critical 
])ressure will not exceed 4 or 5 atmospheres. The liijuid would on 
this assumption possess a very feeble surface tension, and its compress- 
ibility and expansibility would be about four times that of liipiid 
hydrogen, while the heat re({uired to vaporize the molocule would be 
a1)out one-fourth that of li({uid hvdrog-en. If the critical pressure 
should turn out to ]>e as high as that of nitrogcni or oxygen, th(>u the 
iluid density would exceed that of water, and the surface tension 
increased, while the compressibility would be diminished. Heating 
th(^ li({ui(l 1 a))Ove its boiling point woidd raise the pressure b}" If 
atmospheres, which is more than four times the increment for li([uid 
hydrogen. The liquid would be only seventeen times denser than its 
vapor, whereas li({uid hydrogen is sixty-five times denser than the gas 
it gives oti'. Only some S'-* or -i would separate the critical tempera- 
ture from the l)oiling point and the melting point, whereas in licpiid 
hydrogen the separation is respectively lo- and 15"'. As the li([uid 
refractivities for oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrog(Mi are closely propor- 
tional to the gaseous values, and as Lord Rayleigh has shown that 
helium has only one-fourth the refractivity of hydrogen, although it 
is twice as dense, we may infer that the refractivit}' of liquid helium 
would also be about one-fourth that of liipiid h\"drogen, uidess the 
critical pressure is high, wdiich would necessitate an increase in the 
value. Now hydrogen has the smallest refractivity of anv known 
licpud. and yet li<}ui(l helium will have only about one-fourth of this 
value — comparable in fact with liquid hydrogen just below its crit- 
ical point. This means that the licpud will be quite exceptional in its 
optical pro])erties, and very difficult to see. This may be the explana- 
tion wdiy no mist has been seen on its adiabatic expansion from tlie low- 
(\st temperatures. Taking all these remarkal)le properties of the liquid 
into consideration, one is afraid to predict that we are at present able 
to cope with the difficulties involved in its producti(.)n and collection. 
Provided the critical point is, however, not below 8 absolute, then 
from the knowledge of the conditions that are successful in produc- 
ing a change of state in hydrogen through the us(^ of li(piid aii', we 
may safeh' predict that helimn can be liquefied l)y following similar 
methods. If, however, the critical point is as low as 6° absolute, then 
it would be almost hopeless to anticipate success b}" adopting the pro- 
cess that works so well with hydrogen. The present anticipation is 
that the gas will succuml) aftei l)eing subjected to this process, only, 
instead of liquid air under exhaustion being used as the primary cool- 
ing agent, liquid hydrogen evaporating under similar circumstances 
must be employed. In this case the resulting liquid would require to 



228 HISTORY OF COLD AND THE ABSOLUTE ZERO. 

be collected in a vacuum vessel the outer walls of which are iuiinersed 
in liquid hydrogen. The practical difficulties and the cost of the oper- 
ation will be ver}^ great; but on the other hand, the descent to a tem- 
perature within 5' of the zero would open out new vistas of scientific 
inquir}^ which would add immensely to our knowledge of the proper- 
ties of matter. To command in our laboratories a temperature which 
would be equivalent to that which a comet might reacli at an infinite 
distance from the sun would indeed be a great triumph for science. 
If the present Roj^al Institution attack on helium should fail, then we 
must ultimately succeed b}' adopting a process based on the mechan- 
ical production of cold through the performance of external work. 
When a turbine can be worked by compressed helium, the whole of the 
mechanism and circuits being kept surrounded with liijuid hydrogen, 
then we need hardly doubt that the liquefaction will ])e efl'ected. In 
all probability gases other than helium will ))e discovered of greater 
volatility than h^^drogen. It was at the British Association meeting, 
in 1896, that I made the first suggestion of the probalile existence of 
an unknown element which would be found to fill up the gap between 
argon and helium, and this anticipation was soon taken up by others 
and ultimately confirmed. Later, in the Bakerian Lecture for 1901, 
I was led to infer that another mem))er of the helium group might 
exist having the atomic weight a])out 2, and this would give us a gas 
still more volatile with which the absolute zero might be still more 
nearly approached. It is to l)e hoped that some such element or ele- 
ments may yet be isolated and identified as coronium or nebulium. If 
among the unknown gases possessing a very low critical point some 
have a high critical pressure instead of a low one, which (uxlinary 
experience would lead us to anticipate, then such diflicultly li([uefiable 
gases would produce fluids having difi'erent physical properties from 
any of those with which we are acquainted. Again, gases ma}^ exist 
having smaller atomic weights and densities than hydrogen, yet all 
such gases nnist, according to our present a lews of the gaseous state, 
be capable of liquefaction before the zero of temperature is reached. 
The chemists of the future will find ample scope for investigation 
within the apparently limited range of temperature which separates 
solid hydrogen from the zero. Indeed, great as is the sentimental 
interest attached to the licpiefaction of these refractory gases, the 
importance of the achievement lies rather in the fact that it opens out 
new fields of research and enormously widens the horizon of physical 
science, enabling the natural philosopher to study the properties and 
behavior of matter under entirely novel conditions. This department 
of inquiry is as yet only in its infancy, but speedy and extensive devel- 
opments may be looked for, since within recent vears several special 
cr3^ogenic laboratories have been established for the prosecution of 
such researches, and a licjuid-air plant is becoming a common adjunct 
to the equipment of the ordinar}^ lal)oratory. 



HISTOKY OF COLD AND THE ABSOLUTE ZERO. 229 

THE I ITEK AIR AND AURORAS. 

The present liquid oreaii, neglet'ting eveiything for the inoiuent but 
the wat-er, was at a previous period of the earth's history part of the 
atmosphere, and its condensation lias ])een brought about b}' the grad- 
ual cooling of the earth's surface. This resulting ocean is subji^cted 
to the })ressure of the remaining uncondensed gases, and as these are 
slightly soluble they dissohe to some extent in the fluid. The gases 
in solution can be taken out by distillation or by exhausting the water, 
and if we compare their volume Avith the volume of the water as steam, 
we should find about 1 volume of air in 60,000 volumes of steam. This 
would then he about the rough proportion of the relatively permanent 
gas to condensable gas which existed in the case of the vaporized ocean. 
Now h't us assume the surface of the earth gradually cooled to some 
200^ below the freezing point; then, after all the present ocean was 
frozen and the climate l)ecame thrcn^ times more intense than any arctic 
frost, a new ocean of liquid air would appear, covering the entire 
surface of the frozen glol)e about 35 feet deep. We may now appl}' 
the same reasoning to the liquid-air ocean that we formerly did to the 
water one, and this would lead us to anticipate that it might contain in 
solution some gases that may be far less condensable than the chief 
constituents of the fluid. In order to separate them we must imitate 
tlie method of taking the gases out of water. Assume a sample of 
liquid air cooled to the low temperature that can ])e reached ])y its own 
evaporation, connected by a pipe to a condenser cooled in liquid hydro- 
gen; then any volatile gases present in solution will distill over with 
the flrst portions of th(^ air, and can be pumped oft', being uncondensable 
at the temperatui'e of the condenser. In this way a gas mixture, con- 
taining, of the known gases, free hydrogen, helium, and neon, has been 
separated from liquid air. It is interesting to note in passing that the 
relative volatilities of water and oxygen are in the same ratio as those of 
licpnd air and hydrogen, so that the analogy between the ocean of 
water and that of liquid air has another suggestive parallel. The total 
uncondensable gas separated in this way amounts to al)()ut one flfty- 
thousandth of the volume of the air, which is about the same propor- 
tion as the air dissolved in water. Tiiat free hydrogen exists in air in 
small amount is conclusively proxed. I)ut tlu^ actual proportion found 
by the process is xcry much sinall(>r than (fautim' has estimated by 
the cond)ustion method. The recent experiments of Lord Rayleigh 
show that (lautier, who estimated the hydrogen present as on(^ ftve- 
thousandth, has in some way produced more hydrogen than he can 
manage to extract from pure air by a repetition of the same process. 
The spectroscopic examination of these gases throws new light upon 
the question of the aurora and the nature of the upper air. On pass- 
ing electric discharges through the tul)es containing th(» most volatile 
of the atmospheric gases, they glow with a bright orange light, which 



230 HISTORY OF COLD AT^D THE ABSOLUTE ZERO. 

is cspcciiilly marked at the negative pole. The spectroscope shows 
that til is light consists, in the visil)le part of the spectrum, chiefly of 
a succession of strong ra} s in the red, orange, and yellow, attributed 
to hydrogen, helium, and neon. Besides these, a vast number of rays, 
generall}' less brilliant, are distributed through the whole length of 
the visi))le spectrum. The greater part of these rays are of, as yet, 
unknown origin. The violet and ultraviolet part of the spectrum 
rivals in strength that of the red and yellow rays. As these gases 
prolmldy include some of the gases that pervade interplanetary space, 
search was made for the prominent neljular, coronal, and auroral lines. 
No definite lines agreeing with the nebular spectrum could be found, 
but many lines occurred closely coincident with the coronal and auroral 
spectrum. But before discussing the spectroscopic problem it will l»e 
necessary to consider the nature and condition of the upper air. 

According to the old law of Dalton, supported by the modern 
dynamical theory of gases, each constituent of the atmosphere while 
acted upon by the force of gravity forms a separate atmosphere, com- 
pletely independent, except as to temperature, of the others, and the 
relations between the common temperature and the pressure and alti- 
tude for each specific atmosphere can be definitely expressed. Jf we 
assume the altitude and temperature known, then the pressure can be 
ascertained for the same height in the case of each of the gaseous con- 
stituents, and in this way the percentage composition of the atmos- 
phere at that place may be deduced. Suppose we start with a surface 
atmosphere having the composition of our air, only containing two 
ten-thousandths of hydrogen, then at 37 miles, if a sample could be 
procured for analysis, we believe that it would ]je found to contain 12 
per cent of hydrogen and only 10 per cent of oxygen. The carl)onic 
acid practically disappears, and by the time we reach 4T miles, where 
the temperature is minus 132'. assuming a gradient of 3.2° per mile, 
the nitrog(>n and oxygen have so thinned out that the only constituent 
of the upper air which is left is hydrogen. If the gradient of temper- 
ature were dou])led, the elimination of the nitrogen and oxygen would 
take place by the time 37 miles was reached, with a temperature of 
minus 220°. The permanence of the composition of the air at the high- 
est altitudes, as deduced from the basis of the dynamical theory of gases, 
has been discussed ))y Stoney, Bryan, and others. It would appear that 
there is a consensus of opinion that the rate at which gases like hydro- 
gen and helium could escape from the earth's atmosphere would be exces- 
sively slow. Considering that to compensate any such loss the same 
gases are being supplied by actions taking place in the crust of the earth, 
we may safely regard thorn as lu^cessarily permanent constituents of the 
upper air. The temperature at the elevations we have been discaissing 
would not be sufHcient to cause any liquefaction of the nitrogen and 
oxygen, the pressure being so low. If we assume the mean temper- 



HISTOKY OF COLD AND THE ABSOLUTE ZERO. 281 

atiiro as al)Out the ])oilinj^ point of oxygen at atmospheric pressure, 
then a coiisidera])le amount of the carbonic acid nuist solidify as a 
mist, if tlie air from a lower lev^l be cooled to this temperature; and 
the same result miglit take place with other gases of relatively small 
volatilit}' which occur in air. This would explain the clouds that have 
been seen at an elevation of 50 miles, without assuming* the possi])ility 
of water vapor being carried up so high. The temperature of the 
upper air must be above that on the vapor pressure curve corre- 
sponding to the barometric pressure at the locality, otherwise liquid 
condensation must take place. In other words, the temperature must 
be above the dew point of air at that place. At higher elevations, on 
any reasonal)le assumption of temperature distribution, we inevitably 
reach a temperature where the air would condense, just as Fourier 
and Poisson supposed it would, unless the temperature is arrested in 
some wa}" from approaching the zero. Both ultra-violet absorption 
and the prevalence of electric storms may have something to do with 
the maintenance of a higher mean temperature. The whole mass of 
the air above -10 miles is not more than one seven -hundredth part of 
the total mass of the atmosphere, so that any rain or snow of liquid or 
solid air, if it did occur, would necessarily be of a very tenuous descrip- 
tion. In any case, the dense gases tend to accumulate in the lower 
strata, and the lighter ones to predominate at the higher altitudes, 
always assuming that a steady state of equilibrium has been reached. 
It must be observed, however, that a sample of air taken at an eleva- 
tion of 9 miles has shown no difference in composition from that at the 
ground, whereas, according to our hypothesis, the oxygen ought to 
have been diminished to 17 per cent, and the carbonic acid should also 
have become much less. This can onl}^ be explained b\" assuming that 
a large intermixture of different layers of the atmosphere is still taking- 
place at this elevation. This is confirmed by a study of the motions 
of clouds about G miles high, which reveals an average velocity of the 
air currents of some To miles an hour; such violent winds must be the 
means of causing the intermingling of different atmospheric strata. 
Some clouds, however, during hot and thundery weather, have been 
seen to reach an elevation of 17 miles, so that we have direct proof 
that on occasion the lower layers of atmosphere are carried to a great 
elevation. The existence of an atmosphen^ at more than loo miles 
above the surface of the earth is revealed to us by the appearance of 
meteors and fireballs, and when we can take photographs of the spec- 
trum of such apparitions we shall learn a great deal about the compo- 
sition of the upper air. In the meantime Pickering's solitar}' spec- 
trum of a meteor reveals an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium, and 
so far this is corrol)orative of the doctrine we have been discuss- 
ing. It has long been recognized that the aurora is the result of elec- 
tric discharges within the limits of the earth's atmosphere, but it was 



232 HISTORY OF COLD AND THE ABSOLUTE ZERO, 

difficult to undcrstuiid why its spectrum should be so entirely difi'er- 
ent from anything which could l)e prodviced artificially by electric dis- 
charges through rarefied air at the surface of the earth. Writing in 
1879, Kand Capron, after collecting all the recorded observations, was 
able to enumerate no more than nine auroral ra3^s, of which but one 
could with anj^ probabilit}^ be identified with rays emitted by atmos- 
pheric air under an electric discharge. Vogel attributed this want of 
agreement between nature and experiment, in a vague way, to differ- 
ence of temperature and pressure; and Zollner thought the auroral 
spectrum to be one of a different order, in the sense in which the line 
and band spectra of nitrogen are said to be of different orders. Such 
statements were merely confessions of ignorance. But since that time 
observations of the spectra of auroras have been greatly multiplied, 
chiefly through the Swedish and Danish polar expeditions, and the 
length of spectrum recorded on the ulti-a-violet side has been greatly 
extended by the use of photography, so that, in a recent discussion of 
the results, M. Henri Stassano is able to enumerate upward of one 
hundred auroral rajs, of which the wave length is more or less approxi- 
mately known, some of them far in the ultra-violet. Of this large 
number of rays he is able to identify, within the probable limits of 
errors of observation, about two-thirds as rays, which Professor Live- 
ing and myself have observed to be emitted by the most volatile gases 
of atmospheric air unliquefiable at the temperature of liquid hydrogen. 
Most of the remainder he ascribes to argon, and some he might, with 
more probability, have identified with krypton or xenon rays, if he had 
been aware of the publication of wave lengths of the spectra of those 
gases, and the identification of one of the highest rays of krypton 
with that most characteristic of auroras. The rosy tint often seen in 
auroras, particularly in the streamers, appears to be due mainly to 
neon, of which the spectrum is remarkably rich in red and orange 
rays. One or two neon rays are among those most f requenth' observed, 
while the red ray of hydrogen and one red ray of krypton have been 
noticed onl}'^ once. The predominance of neon is not surprising, 
seeing that from its relatively greater proportion in air and its low 
density it nuist tend to concentrate at higher elevations. So large a 
number of proba))le identiffcations warrants the belief that we may 
yet be able to reproduce in our laboratories the auroral spectrum in 
its entirety. It is true that we have still to account for the appear- 
ance of some, and the absence of other, rays of the newly discovered 
gases, which in the way in which we stimulate them appear to be 
equally brilliant, and for the absence, with one doubtful exception, of 
all the rays of nitrogen. If we can not give the reason of this, it is 
because we do not know the mechanism of luminescence — nor even 
whether the particles which carry the electricity are themselves lumi- 
nous, or whether they only produce stresses causing other particles 



HISTORY OF COLD AND THE ABSOLUTE ZERO. 233 

which encounter them to \'ibnite; yet we ure certain that an electric 
(lischarg-e in a hio-hly rarefied mixture of g-a.ses lights one element 
and not another, in a way wliich, to our ignorance, seems .capri- 
cious. The Swedish North Polar Plxpedition concluded from a great 
iuun])er oi trigonometrical measurements that the average above the 
ground of the base of the aurora was 50 kilometers (34 miles) at Cape 
Thorsden, Spitzbergen; at this height the pressure of the nitrogen of 
the atmosphere would be only about one-tenth of a millimeter, and 
Moissan and Deslandres have found that in atmospheric air at pressures 
less than 1 mm. the rays of nitrogen and oxygen fade and are replaced 
by those of argon and hy five new rays which Stassano identities with 
I'ays of the more volatile gases measured by us. Also Collie and 
Kamsay's observations on the distance to which electrical discharges 
of equal potential traverse diil'erent gases explosively throw much 
light on the question; for they find that, while for helium and neon 
this distance is from :^5(i to 300 mm., for argon it is 45^ nun., for 
hydrogen it is ol> mm., and for air and oxygen still less. This 
indicates that a good deal depends on the very constitution of the 
gases themselves, and certainly helps us to imderstand why neon and 
argon, which exist in the atmosphere in larger proportions than helium, 
kr3q:)ton, or xenon, should make their appearance in the spectrum 
of auroras almost to the exclusion of nitrogen and oxygen. How 
nmcli depends not onl}^ on the constitution and it may be temperature 
of the gases, but also on the character of the electric discharge, is evi- 
dent from the diii'erence between the spectra at the cathode and 
anode in different gases, notably in nitrogen and argon, and not less 
remarkabl}' in the more volatile compounds of the atmosphere. 
Paulsen thinks the auroral spectrum wholly due to cathodic rays. 
Without stopping to discuss that question, it is certain that changes in 
the character of the electric discharge produce definite changes in the 
spectra excited \)y them. It has long been known that in many spectra 
the rays which are inconspicuous with an uncondensed electric dis- 
charge become very pronounced when a Leyden jar is in the circuit. 
This used to be ascribed to a higher temperature in this condensed 
spark, though measurements of that temperature have not borne out 
the explanation. Schuster and Hemsalech have shown tliat these 
changes of spectra are in part due to the oscillatory cliaracter of the 
condenser discharge which ma}" be enhanced by self-induction, and 
the corresponding change of spectrum therel)y made more pronounced. 
Lightning we should expect to resemble condensed discharge nuich 
more than aurora, but this is not borne out by the spectrum. Pick- 
ering's recent analysis of the spectrum of a flash obtained l)y photog- 
raphy shows, out of nineteen lines measured b}" him, only two which 
can be assigned with prol)al)ility to nitrogen and oxygen, while three 
hydrogen rays most likely due to water are very conspicuous, and 



234 HISTORY OF COLD AND THE ABSOLTTTE ZERO. 

eleven may be reasonabl}^ ascril)cd to aroon, krypton, and xenon, one 
to more volatile gas of the neon class, and the brightest ray ol" all is 
but a very Uttle less refrangi))le than the characteristic auroral ray, 
and coincides with a strong- ray of calcium, but also lies between, and 
close to, an argon and a neon ra}'^, neither of them weak rays. There 
ma}" be some doubt about the identification of the spectral rays of 
auroras because of the wide limits of the proba1)le errors in measuring 
wave lengths so faint as most of them are, but there is no such dou])t 
about the wave lengths of the ra3^s in solar protuberances measured 
by Deslandres and Hale. Stassano found that these rays, forty-four 
in number, lying between the Fraunhofer line i'^and 3148 in the ultra- 
violet agree very closely with rays which Professor Liveing and' 
myself measured in the spectra of the most volatile atmospheric gases. 
It will be remembered that one of the earliest suggestions as to the 
nature of solar prominences was that they were solar auroras. This 
supposition helped to explain the marvelous rapidity of their changes, 
and the apparent suspension of l)rilliant self-luminous clouds at enor- 
mous heights above the sun's surface. Now, the identification of the 
rays of their spectra with those of the most volatile gases, which also 
furnish many of the auroral rays, certainly supports that suggestion. 
A stronger support, however, seems to be given to it by the results 
obtained at the total eclipse of May, 1901, by the American expedition 
to Sumatra. In the Astrophysical Journal for June last is a list of 
339 lines in the spectrum of the corona photographed by Humphre^^s, 
during totality, with a very large concave grating. Of these no fewer 
than 209 do not differ from lines we have measured in the most volatile 
gases of the atmosphere, or in krypton or xenon, by more than one 
unit of wave length on Armstrong\s scale, a quantity within the limit 
of probable error. Of the remainder, a good many agree to a like 
degree with argon lines, a very few with oxygen lines, and still fewer 
with nitrogen lines; the characteristic green auroral ray, which is not 
in the range of Humphreys's photograj^hs, also agrees within a small 
fraction of a unit of wave length with oiie of the rays emitted by the 
most volatile atmospheric gas. Taking into account the Fraunhofer 
lines iT, /r, and G^ usually ascribed to calcium, there remain only 55 
lines of the 339 unaccounted for to the degree of probability indicated. 
Of these considerably more than half are very weak lines which have 
not depicted themselves on more than one of the six films exposed, 
and extend but a very short distance into the sun's atmosphere. There 
are, however, seven which are stronger lines, and reach to a consid- 
erable height above the sun's rim, and all have depicted themselves on 
at least four of the six films. If there be no considerable error in 
the wave lengths assigned (and such is not likel}^ to be the case), these 
lines may perlfaps be due to some volatile element which may yet be 
discovered in our atmosphere. However that may be, the ver}' great

iuiiu])L'i' of close coiiicidciici^s l)ctwoon the auroral rays and those 
which arc ciiiittetl under electric exciteuieut by <i'as(\s of our atinos- 
[)here almost constrains \if* to believe, what is indeed most probable on 
other grounds, that the sun's coronal atmosphere is couiposed of the 
same substances as the earth's, and that it is rendered luminous in the 
same way — namely, by electric discharges. This conclusion has plainly 
an important bearing- on the explanation which should be given of the 
outburst of new stars and of the extraordinary and rapid changes in 
their spectra. Moreover, leaving on one side tho question whether 
gases ever become luminous ]>y the direct action of heat, apart from 
such transfers of energy as occur in chemical change and electric dis- 
turbance, it demands a revision of the theories wdiich attribute more 
permanent diti'erences l)etween the spectra of diti'erent stars to difi'er- 
ences of temperature, and a fuller consideration of the (juestion 
whether they can not with better reason ])c explained ))}' dilferences 
in the electric conditions which prevail in tlu^ stellar atmosphere. 

If we turn to the question what is th(^ cause of the electric discharges 
which are generally believed to occasion auroras, but of which little 
more has hitherto been known than that they arc^ comiected with sun 
spots and solar eruptions, recent studies of electric discharges in high 
vacua, with which the names of Crookes, Rontgen, Lenard, and J. J. 
Thomson will always be associated, have opened the way for Arrhe- 
nins to suggest a definite and rational ansvv(n'. He points out that the 
frequent disturbances which we know to occur in the sun must cause 
electric discharges in the sun's atmosphere far exceeding any that 
occur in that of the earth. These will be attended with an ionisation 
of the gases, and the negative ions will stream away through th(^, outer 
atmosphere of the sun into the interplanetary space, becoming, as 
Wilson has shown, nuclei of aggregation of condensaljle ^'apors and 
cosmic dust. The liquid and solid particles thus formed will be (^f 
various sizes; the larger will gravitate I)ack to the sun, whih^ those 
with diameters less than one and a half thousandths of a millimeter. l)ut 
nevertheless greater than a wave length of light, will, in accordance 
with Clerk-MaxwelTs electro-magnetic theor}^, be driven away from 
the sun l)y the incidence of the solar rays upon them, with v(docities 
which may beconn^ enormous, until they meet other cel(\stial bodies, 
or increase tluMr dimensions by picking u]) more cosmic dust or 
diminish them by e\'aporation. The earth will catch its shar(> of such 
particles on the side wdiich is turned toward the sun, and its upper 
atmosphere will thereby become negativtdy el(>ctritied until the 
potential of the charge reaches such a point that a discharge occurs, 
which will be repeated as more charged particles reach the earth. 
This theory not oidy accounts for the auroral discharges, and the 
coincidence of their times of greatest frequency with thosi^, of the 
maxima of sun spots, but also for the minor maxima and minima. 
The vernal and autunuial maxima occur when the line throut>-h the 



236 HISTORY OF COLD AI^D THE ABSOLUTE ZEEO. 

earth and sun has its greatest inclination to the solar equator, so that 
the earth is more directly exposed to the region of maximum of sun 
spots, while the twenty-six da3"s period corresponds closely with the 
period of rotation of that part of the solar surface where facula^ are 
most abundant. J. J. Thomson has pointed out, as a consequence of 
the Richardson observations, that negative ions will be constantly 
streaming from the sun merely regarded as a hot body, but this is not 
inconsistent with the supposition that there will be an excess, of this 
emission in eruptions, and from the regions of faculas. Arrhenius's 
theor}" accounts also, in a way which seems the most satisfactory 
hitherto enunciated, for the appearances presented by comets. The 
solid parts of these objects absorb the sun's rays, and as they approach 
the sun become heated on the side turned toward him until the volatile 
substances frozen in or upon them are evaporated and diffused in the 
gaseous state in surrounding space, where they get cooled to the 
temperature of liquefaction and aggregated in drops a])out the nega- 
tive ions. The Jarger of these drops gravitate toward the sun and 
form clouds of the coma al)out the head, while the smaller are driven 
by the incidence of the sun's light upon them awa}^ from the sun and 
form the tail. The curvature of the tail depends, as Bredichin has 
shown, on the rate at which the particles are driven, which in turn 
depends on the size and specific gravity of the particles, and these will 
var}^ with the density of the vapor from which they are formed and 
the frequency of the negative ions which collect them. In any case 
Arrhenius's theory is a most suggestive one, not only with reference 
to auroras and comets, and the solar corona and chromosphere, but 
also as to the constitution of the photosphere itself. 

VARIOUS LOW TEMPERATURE RESEARCHES. 

We may now summarize some of the results which have already 
been attained by low-temperature studies. In the lirst place, the 
great majority of chemical interactions are entirelj^ suspended, l)ut an 
element of such exceptional powers of combination as fluorine is still 
active at the temperature of liquid air. Whether solid fluorine and 
liquid hydrogen would interact no one can at present say."' Bodies 
naturally become denser, but even 51 highly expansive substance like 
ice does not appear to reach the density of water at the lowest tem- 
perature. This is confirmatory of the view that the particles of mat- 
ter under such conditions are not packed in the closest possil)le way. 
The force of cohesion is greatl}^ increased at low temperatures, as is 
shown b}^ the additional stress required to rupture metallic wires. 
This fact is of interest in connection with two conflicting theories of 

«Note by author, April 16, 1903. In a recent communication to the French 
Academy by Professor Moissan and myself it is shown that violent combinations 
take plaet', so that chemical action can in certain cases take place near the zero of

matter. Lord Kc^lviu's view is that the forces that hold together the 
particles of bodies iiiay be accounted for without assuniino- any other 
agency than gravitation or any other law than the Newtonian. An 
opposite view is that the phenomena of the aggregation of molecules 
depend upon the molecular vil)ration as a plwsical cause. Hence, at 
the zero of al)solute temperature, this vibrating energy being in com- 
plete a))eyanc(\ the phenpmena of cohesion should cease to exist, and 
matter generally ])e reduced to an incoherent heap of cosmic dust. 
This second view receives no support from experiment. 

The photogra|)hic action of light is diminished at tlu^ temperature 
of liquid air to about i^o per cent of its ordinary etliciency, and at the 
still lower temperature ot" licjuid hydrogen only about 10 per cent of 
the original sensitivity remains. At the temperature of li((uid air or 
liijuid hydrogen a large range of organic bodies and many inorganic 
ones accpiire under exposure to violet light the property of phosphor- 
escence. Such l)odies glow faintly so long as they are kept cold, but 
become exceedingly l)rilliant during the period when the temperature 
is rising. Even solid air is a phosphoresc-ent body. All the alkaline 
earth sulphides which phosphoresce brilliantly at th(^ ordinary temper- 
ature los<' this property when cooled, to be revived on h(niting; but 
such bodies in the first instance may be stimulated through the absorp- 
tion of light at the lowest temperatures. Radio-acti\'e l)odies, on the 
other hiuid, like radium, which are naturally self-luminous, maintain 
this luminosity unimpaired at the very lowest temperatures, and are 
still capable of inducing phosphorescence in bodies like the platino- 
cyanides. Some crystals become for a time self-luminous when cooled 
in liquid air or hydrogen, owing to the induced electric stimulation 
causing discharges between the crystal molecules. This phenomenon 
is very pronounced Avith nitrate of uranium and some platino-cyanides. 

In conjunction with Professor Fleming a long series of experiments 
was made on the electric and magnetic properties of Ixxlies at low 
tempin-atures. The subjects that haxe been under investigation may 
be classified as follows: The Thermo-Electric Powers of Pure Metals; 
the Magnetic Properties of Iron and Steel; Dielectric Constants; the 
Magnetic and Electric Constants of Licpiid Oxygen; Magnetic Sus- 
ceptil)ility. 

The investigations have shown that electric conductivity in pure 
metals varies almost inversely as the absolute temperatun^ down to 
minus 200"'^, but that this law is greatly ali'ected b}-^ the pi-esence of the 
most minute amount of impurity. Hence the results amount to a 
proof that electric resistance in pure metals is (dosely dependent upon 
the molecular or atomic motion which gives rise to temperatur(% and 
that the process by which the energy constituting what is calked an 
electric current is dissipated essentially depends upon non homogeneity 
of structure and 'Ui)on the absolute temperature of the material. ' It 
might be inferred that at the zero of absolute temperature resistance

would vani-sh altogether, and all pure metals become perfect con- 
ductors of electricity. This conclusion, however, has been rendered 
very doubtful by subsequent observations made at still lower temper- 
atures, which appear to point to an ultimate iinito resistance. Thus 
the temperature at which copper was assumed to have no resistance 
was minus 223-, but that metal has been cooled to minus 253^ without 
getting rid of all resistance. The reduction in resistance of some of 
the metals at the boiling point of hydrogen is very remarkable. Thus 
copper has only 1 per cent, gold and platinum 3 per cent, and silver 
4 per cent of the resistance they possessed at zero C. , but iron still 
retains 12 per cent of its initial resistance. In the case of allo3^s and 
impure metals cold brings about a much smaller decrease in resis- 
tivity, and in the case of carbon and insulators like gutta-percha, glass, 
ebonite, etc., their resistivity steadil}' increases. The enormous 
increase in resistance of bismuth when transversely magnetized and 
cooled was also discovered in the course of these experiments. The 
study of dielectric constants at low temperatures has resulted in the 
discovery of some interesting facts. A fundamental deduction from 
Maxwell's theory is that the square of the ref racti\'c index of a Ijody 
should be the same number as its dielectric constant. So far, however, 
from this being the case generally, the exceptions are far more numer- 
ous than the coincidences. It has been shown in the case of many 
substances, such as ice and glass, that an increase in the frequency of 
the alternating electromotive force results in a reduction of the dielec- 
tric constant to a value more consistent with MaxwelFs law. B}^ 
experiments upon many substances it is shown that even a moderate 
increase of frequency brings the large dielectric constant to values 
quite near to that required b}^ Maxwell's law. It was thus shown that 
low temperature has the same effect as high frequency in annulling the 
abnormal dielectric values. The exact m(>asurement of the dielectric 
constant of liquid oxygen, as well as its magnetic permea])ility, com- 
bined with the optical determination of the refrative index showed 
that Tuiuid oxygen strictly obeys Maxwell's electro-optic law even at 
very low (>lectric frequencies. In magnetic work the result of great- 
est ^ahie is the proof that magnetic susceptibility varies inversely as 
the absolute temperature. This shows that the magnetization of para- 
magnetic bodies is an affair of orienttition of molecules, and it sug- 
gests that at the absolute zero all the feebly paramagnetic bodies will 
be strongly magnetic. The diamagnetism of l)isnuith was found to b(^ 
increased at low temperatures. The magnetic moment of a steel mag- 
net is temporarily increased by cooling in liquid air. but the increase 
seems to have reached a limit, because on further cooling to the 
temperature of liquid hydrogen hai-dly any further change was 
observed. The study of the thermo-electric relations of the metals 
at low temperatures resulttnl in a great extension of the well-known 
Tait Thermo-Electric Diaoram. Tait found that the thermo-electric

power of the inetals .coiTld be expres.sed l)v a linear function of the 
al)S()lute temperature, hut at ' the extreme range of temp<'rature now 
under consideration this hiw was found not to hold o(Mierally; and, 
further, it appeared that many al)rupt electric changes take place, 
which originate probably from specific molecular changes occurring 
in the metal. The thermo-electric neutral points of c(M-tain metals, 
such as lead and gold, which are located at or below the ])oiling point 
of hydrogen, have l)een found to l)e a convenient means of defining 
specific temj^eratures in this exceptional part of the thermo-metric 
scale. 

The effect of cold upon the life of living organisms is a matter 
of great intrinsic int(M-est, as well as of wide theoretical impor- 
tance. Experiment indicates that moderately high tcMuperatures 
are much more fatal, at least to the lower forms of life, than are 
exceedingly low ones. Professor McKendrick froze for an hour 
at a temperature of 182° C. samples of meat, milk, etc., in sealed 
tu]»es. When these were opened after lieing kept at blood lieat for 
a few days their contents were found to l)e quite putrid. More 
recently some more elaborate tests were carried out at the flenner 
Institute of Preventive Medicine on a series of typical liacteria. 
These were exposed to the temperature of licjuid air for twenty 
hours. ])ut their vitality was not affected, their functional activities 
I'cmained unin)paired, and the cultures which they yielded weiv normal 
in every respect. The same result was obtained when licpiid hydrogen 
was substituted for air. A similar persistence of life in seeds has 
been demonstrated even at the lowest temperatures. They were 
frozen for over a hundred hours in liquid air, at the instance of 
Messrs. Brown and Escoml>e, with no other result than to afi'ect their 
protoplasm with a certain inertness, from which it recovered with 
warmth. Subsequently connnercial samples of barley, pea, vegetable- 
marrow, and mustard seeds were literally steeped for six hours in 
li(iuid hydrogen at the Royal Institution, yet when they were sown by 
Sir W. T. Thiselton Dj^er at Kew in the ordinary way the proportion 
in which germination occurred was no less titan in the other batches of 
the same seeds which had suti'ered no abnormal treatment. Bacteria 
are minute vegetable cells, the standard of measurement for which is the 
'' mikron." Yet it has been found possible to completely triturate these 
microscopic cells wdien the operation is carried out at the temperature 
of liquid air, the cells then being frozen into hard, breakable masses. 
The typhoid organism has been treated in this way and the cell plasma 
obtained for the purpose of studying- its toxic and immunizing- prop- 
erties. It would hardly have been anticipated that liquid air should 
find such immediate application in biological research. A research by 
Professor Macfadyen," just concluded, has shown that many n arieties 

« Note by author, April 16, 190;-5. This important paper has recently appeared in 
the Proceedings of the Royal Society. 



240 HISTORY OF COLD AND THE ABSOLUTE ZEEO. 

of microorganisms can be exposed to the temperature of liquid air for 
a period of six months without any appreciable loss of vitality, although 
at such a temperature the ordinary chemical processes of the cell 
must cease. At such a temperature the cells can not be said to be 
either alive or dead in the ordinary acceptation of these words. It is 
a new and hitherto unobtained condition of living matter — a third 
state. A final instance of the application of the above methods may be 
given. Certain species of bacteria during the course of their vital 
processes are capable of emitting light. If, however, the cells be 
broken up at the temperature of liquid air, and the crushed contents 
brought to the ordinary temperature, the luminosity function is found 
to have disappeared. This points to the luminosity not being due to 
the action of a ferment — a " Lucif erase ^ — ])at as being essentially 
bound up with the vital processes of the cells and dependent for its 
production on the intact organization of the cell. These attempts to 
study b}' f rigoritic methods the physiology of the cell have alread}^ 
yielded valuable and encouraging results, and it is to be hoped that 
this line of investigation will continue to be vigorously prosecuted at 
the Jenner Institute. 

And now, to conclude an address which must have sorely taxed your 
patience, I may remind you that I commenced by referring to the 
plaint of Eliza])ethan science that cold was not a natural available 
product. In the course of a long struggle with nature, man, by the 
application of intelligent and steady industry, has acquired a control 
over this agency which enables him to produce it at will and with 
almost any degree of intensity short of a limit delined by the very 
nature of things. But the success in working what appears at first 
sight to be a quarrv of research that would soon suffer exhaustion, 
has onl}^ brought him to the threshhold of new labyrinths, the entan- 
glements of Avhich frustrate with a seemingly invulnerable complexity 
the hopes of further progress. In a legitimate sense all genuine scien- 
tific workers feel that they are "the inheritors of unfulfilled renown." 
The battlefields of science are the centers of a perpetual warfare, in 
which there is no hope of final victory, although partial conquest is 
ever triumphantly encouraging the continuance of the disciplined and 
streiuious attack on the seemingly impregnable fortress of nature. To 
serve in the scientific army, to have shown some initiative, and to be 
rewarded by the consciousness that in the eyes of his comrades he 
bears the accredited accolade of successful endeavor, is enough to sat- 
isfy the legitimate ambition of every earnest student of nature. The 
real warranty that the march of progress in the future will be as glo- 
rious as in the past lies in the perpetual reenf orcement of the scientific 
ranks 1)}' recruits animated by such a spirit and proud to obtain such 
a reward. 



p]xpp:rimental phonp:tk^s. 



By Prof. John G. McKendkick, F. H. 8.*^ 



The movomont.s of the org'an.s of voice and speech are so complicated 
as to require for their ehicidation the application of nuiny methods of 
research. When one speaks there are movements of the lips, tonoue. 
soft palate, and larynx, and sometimes movements of the muscles of 
expression. Then, again, there are special characteristics a])out vowel 
sounds which apparently distinguish these from the sounds of musical 
instruments. Thus questions arise as to the true nature of vowel 
sounds and as to what is the physical constitution of a word of several 
sjdlables. It has also ])een suggested that language might be recorded, 
not by letters or syllal)les, but by signs or symbols which would indi- 
cate what had to l>e done l)y the vocal and articulating organs for the 
production of an}" given sound. There might thus l)e a physiological 
method of expressing speech l)y a series of alphabetical sym))o]s for 
sounds varying in pitch, intensity, and ({uality. It will ])e seen that 
experimental phonetics constitutes a wide tield of research, not only of 
great scientific interest, but also one having practical aspcx-ts not at 
first apparent. From the nature of the investigation, also, the prol)- 
lems seem to l)e specially suited for the application of the graphic 
method of research. 

In 1875 an investigation was cai'ried out by Havet and Rosapelly'' 
in tlie la})oratory of Professor Marey^, in Paris, in which the pressure

An ideal method tor recordin<;- vibrations was devised by Rops in 
1893. ideal inasmuch as it does not use any vibrating membrane or lever 
or anything having inertia. A diagram is given in tig. 22 

It is based on the principle of photo- 
graphing the effects of interf(>rences of 
light waves. Kays from a luminous 
source A pass through the lenses y y so 
as to become parallel. They then pass 
through a slit d and a hole in a dia- 
phragm I. and they are focused by a 
lens / (of 15 centimeters focal length) so 
as to fall on a glass plate S^. The ray 
divides into two, a^ and '/.,. and they run 
])arallel, the ra}' a^ passing through the 
air while (/.. passes along a tube </ (15 
centimeters in length), the ends of which 
are closed by the glass plates h and //j. 
A few centimeters from the tube there 
is a resonator. /, into which the vowels 
are sung, thus causing condensations and 
rarefactions of the air. disturbing the 
ray /( h^ while the rav passing through 
the tube g is unaffected. The two rays 
are again united by Sji they then pass 
through an objective c and a lens z to a 
slit in a screen so as to fall on sensitive 
paper on the drum T. A diaphragm h 
cuts off' secondary reflections. Thus 
beautiful images are formed correspond- 
ing to the vowels spoken or chanted into 
the resonator. 

The invention of the tin-foil phono- 
graph ])y Edison in 1877 and the improve- 
ment of the instrument by the labors of 
Edison, Graham Bell, and others in more 
recent years has made it possible to in- 
vestigate phonetic phenomena with the 
aid of this instrument. In 1878 Fleem- 
ing Jenkin and Pawing" devised a method 
of recording curves from the imprints 
on the tin-foil covering the drum of the phonograph, and these curves 
were submitted to harmonic analysis. This was also attempted bv

imestigation of the nature of vowels l)e- 
gins with "\\'illis," who, in lS2i), imitated 
the larynx l)y means of a reed, above 
which he placed a resonator, tuned to one 
of the harmonics of the reed. He also 
imitated vowel tones by holding an elastic 
spring against the edge of a toothed wheel. 
and he placed the vowels in the following 
order — oa^ o, «, e, and /. In each case a 
compound tone was produced which re- 
tained the same pitch so long as the wheel 
revolved at the same rate. By keeping 
the wheel revolving at a uniform rate, and 
at the same time changing the length of 
the spring which was allowed to vibrate, 
AN^illis found that the qualities of various vowels were imitated with 
considerable distinctness. In 1837 Wheatstone,'' in a criticism of 

Willis, made some important sug- 
gestions. In 1854: Grassmann' an- 
nounced a theory as follows: The 
vocal chords excite th(^, resonances 
of the cavity of the moutlif the 
tonality changes with the degree of 
opening of the mouth ])y the devel- 
opment of some of the harmonics 
of the fundamental tone emitted by 
the larynx. According to this view 
the ])uccal cavity adds by its reso- 
nance certain harmonics to the fundamental laryngeal sound. Grass- 
mann classiiied the vowels according to the number of hat-monies 
which they contained in the following ta])le:

In soundinjj- <i the mouth is widely opened and the funduniental and 
eight harmonics are produced; in the third series, on the contrar}', 
there is only one harmonic sounded, which is more and more acute as 
we pronounce the vowels in the order <ni^ u, and /. The vowels of the 
second series, o, eu, and e, are transitional between the first and the 
third. Thus we pass from a to ou by o, from a to f/ by ett, and from 
a to l by e. 

Donders -' showed that the cavity of the mouth, as arranged for the 
giving- forth of a vowel, was tuned as a resonator for a tone of a cer- 
tain pitch, and that different pitches corresponded to the forms of the 
cavity for the different vowels. This he discovered b}" the peculiar 
noise produced in the mouth when the different vowels are whispered. 
The cavity of the mouth is then blown like an organ pipe and by its 
resonance reinforces the corresponding partials in the rushing wind- 
like noise. Then the question was taken up by Helmholtz. ^ He 
attacked it both by analysis and bj' synthesis. He analyzed the A'owel 
tones by his well-known resonators, aided by his own singularly acute 
ear, and he attempted to combine, by means of tuning forks, the tones 
'\\liich he thought existed in a vowel, so as to reproduce the sound of 
the vowel. In the latter part of the investigation he was by no means 
successful. These investigations led Helmholtz to put forward in 
succession two theories as to the formation of vowels. The first was 
that, as in all musical instruments, the quality or timl)re of the vowel 
depends on the fundamental tone, reinforced by certain partials or 
overtones, of which a num])er are produced ])y the vocal cords along 
with the fundamental tone, the reinforcement depending on the reso- 
nance of the cavities a))ove tlie vocal cords. This theory was upset I)}' 
the use of the phonograph. If a vowel is sung to the })honogiaph 
while the cylinder is traveling at a certain speed, the vowel tone will 
be reproduced with exactly the same quality if the cylinder is driven 
at the same speed; l)ut if it is driven faster, then the quality t)f the 
vowel will be changed, so much so as to be scarcely recognizaI)le. 
M. Marey narrates that Donders and he first made this obser\;ition 
when it so happened that the two savants were present in Paris at a 
public demonstration of the phonograph soon after its invention. 
Donders sang the vowel tones to the instrument, and then asked the 
operator to vary the speed of the cylinder during reproduction. Tlien 
the vowel (/ became o, and e ))ecame on. Thus while the phonograph 
reproduces in a wonderful way the tones of musical instruments with- 
out change of quality, it can not transpose \owel tt)nes without alter- 
ing their character. This special character or quality can not. then,

depend on the overtones reinforced ))v the oral cavities being" simple 
multiples of the fundamental tone, and Helmholtz's first theor}' had 
to be abandoned. 

This led Helmholtz to advance a second theory, as follows: P^ach 
vowel is characterized by a certain harmonic or partial tone, of con- 
stant pitch, whatever may be the pitch of the note on which the vowel 
is sung or spoken. Attempts were then made, notably by Hemholtz 
and Konig, to fix the pitch of the characteristic partial tone or vocable, 
and there appeared to be considerable ditt'erences in the results of the 
two distinguished observers, differences amounting to as much, in 
some cases, as three semitones. 

The next step was, as has already been explained, to transcribe the 
marks on the wax cylinder of the phonograph, made on singing or 
speaking a vowel, into simious curves and to subject these to harmonic 
analy^^is. It is not difficult, in comparativel}' simple cases, to obtain 
a curve which is the algebraic sum of the ordinates of several sinus- 
soidal curves, but it is not so easy to do the reverse operation, namely, 
to analyze the curves. Fleeming Jenkin, and Ewing, afterwards 
Schneel)eli, Hensen, Pipping, and Hermann, have done this in accord- 
ance with the theorem of Fourier and the law of Ohm. In particular, 
Hermann, b}^ a beautiful and ingenious method, has analyzed the 
curves obtained l)v his photographic device, and has modified the 
theory of Helmholtz. His statement is that the oral cavity produces 
independently a harmonic or partial tone which has no definite relation 
to the fundamental tone emitted by the larynx. A vowel, according 
to him, is a special acoustic phenomenon, depending on the intermittent 
production of a special partial, or '"''formant," or "characteristique." 
The pitch of the "formant" ma} vary a little without altering the 
character of the vowel. For a, for example, the '"formant" may var}^ 
irom fa^ to hf^, even in the same person. He has also attempted, but 
not with complete success, to reproduce the vowel tones by synthesis. 

There are thus three theories: (1) The first of Helmholtz, now aban- 
doned, that the pitch of the partials is represented by simple nudtiples 
of the vi])ration periods of the fundamental; (2) the second of Helm- 
holtz, that the pitch of the characteristic partial is always fixed, but 
has a definite relation to the pitch of the fundamental; and (3) that of 
Hermann, that the pitch of the characteristic ])artial or ''formant" is 
not absolutely fixed. 

The difficulty of harmonizing these theories has stinudated the zeal 
of many workers, and in particular Dr. Marage" has ])een remarkably 
successful in his researches into the nature of vowels. He first of all 
criticizes the second theory of Helmholtz, pointing out that the failure 
to reproduce the vowels by synthesis is strongly against it. Thus while, 

« Marage: Tlieorie de la Formation des Voyelles, op. cit. 



256 EXPERIMENTAL PBONETICS. 

liy tuning forks, the pitch of which is that of the partials of the funda- 
mental tone, oii^ 0, and a may be badly reproduced, it has l)een found 
impossible to reproduce e and i. He then o1)]ects to the theory of 
Hermann, namel}^, that the vowel is an oral intermittent and oscillating 
tone; first, that the method of recording the vowel on the wax cylinder 
of the phonograph causes grave errors, because the mouthpiece, tube, 
air chamber, and vibrating disk all profoundl}' modify the vowel; 
second, that the method of analj'sis by Fourier's theorem assumes 
that the vowel curves are constituted by superposed simple curves, 
which is precisely the question at issue, and therefore the arginuent is 
a petitio principii; and third, that the data obtained by his method 
have not enabled Hermann to I'econstruct the vowels with greater 
success than Helmholtz. Marage then enters upon his own method, 
which consists essential 1}^ of using a special apparatus constructed on 
Konig's principle of manometric flames, but so simple as to bo practi- 
cally free from sources of error; that is to say, there is no mouthpiece, 
tube, or lever. The pictures of the flames were yjroduced photo- 
graphically by feeding the flame with acetjdene gas, and chronojihoto- 
metrical records were taken with each experiment. He then finds that 
the flame pictures of i, u, and ou show one flame, e, eu, and o two flames, 
and A three flames. So that the classification of the vowels by flames is 
exactly that of Grassmann. P^ach vowel, when all errors have thus been 
got rid of by simplifying the apparatus, always gives the same picture 
for any given note. The picture is that of a continuous periodic curve, 
and the number of periods in a second corresponds to the laryngeal 
note, while the form of the period characterizes the vowel. With the 
same vowel the period changes with the note. When the note is near 
the pitch of ordinary speech the period varies very little. This is 
not so when the vowel is sung; the period then disappears until there 
is onl}^ the laryngeal note. Marage has also b}^ synthesis reproduced 
the vowels with remarkable success. His first experiments with 
resonators were not quite satisfactory; he could reproduce ou, o, and 
A, but not E and i. He ascertained, however, that to reproduce a the 
resonator must be tuned to the third harmonic or partial of the note 
on which a was sung; that to reproduce e, eu, and o the best result 
was ol)tained when the resonator gave the second partial; and i, u, 
and ou were imitated (but not successfully) when the resonator was in 
unison with the lar3^ngeal tone. 

Marage finally devised a syren rotated by an electric motor and 
consisting of a disk having in it a triangular window representing the 
glottis. The air is driven under pressure through this aperture and 
then falls on another disk having windows cut out of it in groups 
according to the nature of the vowel to })e synthetically reproduced. 
Thus the disk for a has four groups, each group consisting of three 
triangular slit-like windows; for o and e the disk shows five groups, 



EXPERIMENTAL PHONETICS. 257 

each coMsistin^^ of two slits; and for i and ou there are many slits, 
without these being arranged in groups. The slits are very large for 
o and narrow for k, and large for ou and narrow for i. He then 
molded a series of casts of the interior of the oral and pharyngeal 
cayities of a human subject, as these were adapted for the singing of 
the different vowels, and from them constructed masks or headpieces 
which could l)e placed over the syren so that the air escaping from it 
passed through the cavities of the mask. He found that if air was 
driven through the masks under a pressure of only 7 centimeters of 
water the timlire of the corresponding vowel was at once perceived, 
as in whispering. Marage's view is that to form a vowel the true 
vocal cords vibrate in a horizontal plane, in such a way as to influence 
by their greater or less degree of approximation the escape of air. 

If the air escapes in three little putt's as it were (the cords vi])i'ating 
during each putf a number of times equal to the pitch of the note on 
which the vowel is spoken or sung), so that there are inttn-vals between 
the groups of putfs, then the vowel a is the result. The oral resonater 
is in unison with the sum of the vibrations and the vowel is emitted. 
If the resonater (eithiM- artiticial or the oral cavit}', as in life) is turned 
to the third harmonic of this note, then the vowel a is uioditied; the 
same applies to e and o, which have the second harmonic, and in 
passing from the one vowel to the other it is sufficient to change the 
aperature of the glottic opening. Thus for a, if the fundamental note 
is J), the oral resonator nuist l)e tuned to 3;/; for Vj and o, if the funda- 
mental is /)', the oral resonator gives 2//; and for land ou the resonater 
is in unison. If this is not so, then the (juality of the vowel is nmch 
altered. Thus if the syren gives a, and the plate used is that for ou, 
then the sound is a moditied. This agrees with the experience of 
teachers of singing, who hold that a badly sung vowel is a vowel 
sound emitted into a cavity adjusted for another vowel. Marage has 
also found that wdien the sounds of his syren, aid<Kl I)y the masks, are 
examined l)y the manometric method, the flamc^ pictui-es ajipear as 
they may be expected to do — that is, groups of three flames for a, of 
two for E, EU, and o, and of one for i, u, and ou. Vowels then, 
according to him. are due to an intermittent aero-laryngeal vibration, 
strengthened by the oral cavity and producing ou, o, a, p:, and i, 
when it is in unison with the sum of the \'il)i'ations; transformed by 
it, and giving origin to other vowels, when there is no unison; and 
the number of intermittences gives the fundanuMital notc^ on which the 
vowel is emitted. If the oi'al cavity acts alone, the Nowel is whispered; 
if the larynx acts alone, the \owel is sung; and if the two act, the vowel 
is spoken. Marage has applied his method with much success in test- 
ing the ear and in the treatment of unites who are not absolutely deaf. 
His memoir is characterized l)y great simplicity and at the same time 
by thoroughness. ^

258 EXPEEIMENTAL PHONETICS. 

But the study of vowels is not the only result of recent research in 
phonetics. The analysis of consonantal sounds is now being carried out 
by various workers, such as Pipping, Scripture, and Lloyd. Meyer, 
in Hermann's laborator}^ has investigated the pitch of words, sen- 
tences, and syllables in speech. This has also been studied by phono- 
graphic tracings by Marichelle. The wdiolc subject has also a i)ractical 
bearing, as the knowledge acquired enables the teacher of deaf uuites 
so to instruct his pupils in the use of their organs as to avoid the 
dreary monotone of those who learn to speak by watching only the 
movements of the lips. 

It only remains to notice the remarkable monograph of Jespersen. 
This is an attempt to aid the study of phonetics by the use of a scien- 
tific nomenclature to express sounds, so that just as the chemist 
represents by letters and figures the nature of a chemical substance 
of complex constitution so the student of phonetics may be able to 
express the sounds of words by symbols. The visible-speech system 
of Melville-Bell consisted of symbols which expressed more or less 
accurately the physiological movements to be made, or the posi- 
tion to be assumed during the pronunciation of a given sound; ])ut 
the symbols of Jespersen are letters and figures. The letters or 
figures, however, to be useful must have a physiological meaning. 
Strictly speaking, the symbols denote, not sounds, l)ut the elements of 
sounds. Thus so simple a sound as )ii is physiologically the result of 
{a) lips shut; {h) |3oint of tongue resting in the ])ottom of the mouth; 
(c') surface of tongue not raised toward the palate; {(I) nasal passage 
open; {e) vocal cords vibrate, and {f) air expelled from lungs. The 
attempt of Jespersen may be called an alphabetic system of writing, 
symbolizing, not sounds, but the elements of sounds. At present it 
is severely technical, but it seems to ''provide a means of writing 
down and descri})ing phonetic minutia' in a comparatively easy and 
unaml)iguous manner.'' It will do for the i)honetician what symbol- 
ism does for the mineralogist. It is a kind of algebra for speech 
sounds. 

In advocating the establishment of a photographic nuiseum, to be a 
visual register of the past, Janssen recently Avrote as follows: ''Pho- 
tography registers the chain of phenomena during time, just as 
writing registers the thoughts of men during the ages. Photogi-aphy 
is to sight what writing is to thought. If there is any difference, it 
is to the advantage of photography. Writing is subject to conven- 
tionalities from which photography is free; writing em})loys a partic- 
ular language, while photography speaks the universal language." 

But if ther(» is to l)e a museum of photographs, appealing to the 
sense of sight, why should Ave not have a nuiseum of sounds, in the 
shape of phonograph records, appealing to the sense of hearing? 
HoAv little can Ave tell from written characters the exact sounds of

ancient Sanskrit, or how Demosthenes spoke in Greek or Cicero in 
Latin? Would it not now be interesting^- to hear the exact iiccent of 
old English, or the Scotch of the tifteenth century? All dialects 
should be carefully registered and put aside for future consultation, 
and thus we would do for the ear what we do for the eye. No dou])t 
such a collection of phonographic records would help onward the 
science of language. 



WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY— ITS PAST AND PRESENT 
STATUS AND ITS PROSPECTS. " 



By William Mavek, Jr 



Long- before the dawn of the Christian era wireless methods of com- 
municating intelligence to a distance were employed — not electric tele- 
graphs as the term is generalh' understood, it is true, but wireless they 
certainly were, and perhaps as this article proceeds it will not }»e diffi- 
cult to perceive a close relationship, as regards the nature of the com- 
municating medium employed, between some of the wireless telegraph 
systems in vogue thousands of years ago, especially those that 
employed the luminiferous ether as the communicating medium, and 
the wireless telegraph systems of to-day. in which case it would simpl}' 
be another verification of the old proverb, "There is nothing new 
under the sun." 

Polybius, the Greek historian, describes a telegraph S3^stem 
employed for military purposes, 300 B. C, in which torches were 
placed on high walls in prearranged positions to correspond to letters 
of the Greek alphabet, and by a suitable manipulation of the torches 
messages were thus transmitted to a distance. The Gauls, too, were 
wont to transmit important intelligence to a distance by a cruder but 
simpler method. A messenger was sent to the top of a hill, where he 
shouted his message, appai'ently to the winds. Soon from afar a 
voice answered him, and this voice repeated the message to another 
listener farther on, and thus, from one to another, the message sped, 
and it is recorded that in three days a message calling all the tribes of 
the Gauls to arms traveled in this way from Auvergne to the forests 
of Amorica in one direction and to the banks of the Rhine in another. 

Later on came another wireless telegraph system — the semaphore 
telegraph — which was in operation all over Europe prior to and for 
some time after the introduction of the electric telegraph. This sem- 
aphore telegraph emplo3'ed arms on posts akin to those seen to-day 
along every railway in the world, and a certain position of the arms,

262 WIRELESS TELEGEAPHY. 

like the torches in the Polybiiis system, corresponded to certain let- 
ters of the alphabet, and by varying the position of the arms as 
required experts were able to transmit messages from one station to 
the other at the rate of two or three words per minute. The towers 
on the top of which the semaphores were erected were often 50 to 60 
feet high, and were placed on eminences about 6 or 8 miles apart. In 
Russia alone there was a string of these towers from the Prussian 
frontier to St. Petersl)urg, a distance of 1,200 miles or more. Then, 
after the electric wire telegraph, came the electric wireless telegraph, 
and perhaps even a cursory review of this subject will show that it is 
not of as recent origin as it is popularly thought to be. For instance, 
it is known that over one hundred and fifty years ago electric signals 
were sent Avithout wires across lakes and rivers. Dr. Watson, bishop 
of Landorff, then sent electric shocks across the Thames, and, subse- 
quentl}^ through the New River at Newington. Similar experiments 
were made by Franklin in 1748 across the Schuylkill at Philadelphia, 
and by Du Luc, a yeav later, across the lake of Geneva. In these 
instances, however, the water or earth was the conductor of the elec- 
tric impulses. 

It is fairly well known also that during the past fifteen or eighteen 
years there have l)een in limited use a numl)er of wireless telegraph 
systems which have sometimes been termed induction telegraph sys- 
tems, and in which electromagnetic impulses, or waves, are employed. 
Such systems are ])ased upon the phenomena of mutual induction 
between wires, discovered b}" Faraday and Henr3\ Henry's experi- 
ments, made half a centur}^ ago, were chiefly with flat coils of wire, 
one opposite the other. When the circuit of one of such coils, con- 
taining a battery, was opened and closed, it was found that an electric 
current was set up in the other coil. This action also takes place 
between two straight, parallel wires, and when these parallel wires are 
sufficient]}^ h)ng, and the electromotive force in the transmittnig wire 
is powerful enough, signals may be received in a telephone or other 
sensitive receiver, even when the wires are separated a distance of 
several miles. 

In 1892 Sir William II. Preece succeeded in transmitting Morse 
signals by this method to a distance of more than 3 miles, between 
Penarth, on the mainland, and the island of Flat Holm, in the British 
Channel, using a telephone as the receiver. More recently the same 
experimenter has met with success in establishing a wireless telephone 
circuit by means of which speech is transmitted between the Skerries 
light-ship and the mainland of Anglesey — a distance of nearly 3 miles — 
the parallel wiie on the Skerries Islands being 750 yards in length and 
that on the mainland 3.5 miles in length, the ends of each wire terminat- 
ing in the sea. On these systems both magnetic induction and electric 
conduction through the earth and water are utilized.

electric waves, or ether Waves, are utilized, and of which the Marconi 
wireless telegraph S3^stem is the best known. It is of this latter sys- 
tem, as representing-, so far as the writer is aware, the most advanced 
development of this art, that the present article will briefly treat. Tt 
would obviously be far beyond the scope of a necessarily limited 
account to deal with all the wireless telegraph inventions tliat have 
been announced witliin the past few years. 

A\'luMi, in 1804:, Clerk-Maxwell, who Avas, perhai)s, tlie most noted 
mathematician of his day, made announcement of his celel)rated elec- 
tromagnetic theory of light, which theory involved the existence of 
electric waves in free space, many of the prominent physicists of the 
time set themselves the task of demonstrating l)y experiment the truth 
of this theory. It was not, however, until 1887 that the actual exist- 
ence of electric waves in free space was demonstrated, the great 
honor of this accomplishment falling to Prof. H, Hertz, after whom 
such electric waves are now almost generally termed '"'' Hertzian" 
waves. The old popular idea of electricity hardl}^ conceived it as 
existing outside of a wire or other metallic conductor. The air was 
an insulator, and how, therefore, could electricity exist apart from a 
wire! Maxwell overturned this view.j and told us that just as under 
the undulatory theory of light that which we call light is a result of 
ether vibration, so also is electricit}^ a resiilt of ether vibration, and 
that in so far as light and electricity differ it is onh" a question of 
the rate of vibration of the ether, those undulations of tlie ether 
which the eye recognizes as light occurring at a rate varying from 
4UO,0(H),000,00(),000 to 700,000,000,000,000 per second, while the fre- 
quency of the electric undulations of the ether vary from a few hun- 
dreds or thousands to 200,00(»,000,0(X),0(>() per second. 
' According to the undulatory theory of light, the undidations of the 
ether, of the frequency just mentioned, are set up by any source of 
light. Similarly, according to Maxwell's theory, undulations are set 
up in the ether by any source of electric oscillations — analogously, for 
example, as waves are set up in the atmosphere b}- a source of sound. 
Also, as those ether waves which correspond in freqmMicy to light 
afiect an organ of sight when they fall upon it, and as sound waves 
aft'ect an organ of hearing when the}- fall upon it, so, it was reasoned, 
should the electric waves of the ether affect a suitable electric ''eye," 
or receiver, when they fall upon it. 

The manner in which Professor Plertz proceeded to show the exist- 
ence of electric waves in free space was, briefly, as follows: It was 
already known that electric oscillations could be set up in a well- 
insulated Avire or conductor; in fact, that the discharge of the I^eyden 
jar is made up of a series of electric oscillations, as had been shown 



264 



WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY. 



by Lord Kelvin in 1853. Hertz set up electric oscillations by means 
of an electric oscillator, shown in lig. 1. This consists of an ordinar}^ 
large induction coil, A, the terminals of the secondary coil being- con- 
nected to brass balls, or knol)s, and to which short metal rods, or 
wings, ?/;, are attached. The knobs are separated by a small air space, 
across which sparks jump when the coil is in operation. At such 
times electric oscillations are set up, the rate of which varies with the 
electrical dimensions of the circuit. 

Hertz assumed that if the electric oscillations thus produced set up 
corresponding waves in the ether of free space, these waves should, 
in turn, set up electric oscillations of corresponding frequency in 
a suitable receiver, or "eye,'' within the range of their influence. 

He therefore adopted as a detector 
of these waves a copper wire, D 
(tig. 1), of nearly circular shape, 
about IG inches in diameter, but 
broken at one point. On the ends 
of this wire he placed small metal 
knobs, the distance between which 
could be easily regulated. This wire 
was held by an insulated handle,' a 
few feet from the oscillator. With 
the room darkened, minute sparks 
were observed passing between the 
discharge knobs of the receiver; and 
the results of this simple experi- 
ment have ])een generally accepted 
as proof of the existence of electric 
waves in free space. 

Hertz, however, was not satisfied 
with this demonstration of the accu- 
racy of Maxwell's theory, but also, 
in the course of his su])sequent mas- 
terl}' experiments, showed that, like sound, heat, and light waves, 
the Hertzian waves could also be reflected, refracted, concentrated in 
paralhd rays, and to a focus, etc. 

By the Hertz receiver the distance at which electric waves could 
))e detected was very limited, perhaps 10 or 12 feet at most, and 
hence it is not likely that much would have been done in the utiliza- 
tion of Hertzian waves for telegraphic purposes had progress rested 
there. Fortunately, it did not. Shortly after the experiments of 
Hertz, Dr. Branly discovered that loose metal tilings, which in a 
normal state have a very high electrical resistance, lose this i-esistance 
in the presence of electric oscillations and become practically conduc- 
tors of electricity. This he showed by placing metal filings in a glass

tube and niaking- them part of an ordinary electric circuit (see tig. 2). 
AVhen electric waves are set up in the iieighl)orhood of this circuit, 
electromotive forces are generated in it, which !i})])eai' to l)ring tiie 
tilings more closely togethtu' — that is, to cohere- and thus tlieir elec- 
trical resistance decreases, from which cause this piece of ai)paratus — 
the tu))e and its tilings-^is termetl a ''"coherer/' Hence, the receiv- 
ing instrument, (I, in tlu^ tigure, 
wliieh may be a galvanometer or 
a telegraph relay, that normally 
would not manifest any sign of 
current from the small battery, 
B, will be o])erated when electric 
oscillations are set up. Profes- 
sor Branh' further found that 
when the tilings had once cohered 
they retained their low electrical resistance until shaken apart, for 
instance, by tapping on the tube. 

In 1894 Dr. O. J. Lodge showed that the Branly coherer could be 
employed to transmit telegraphic signals, and in order that the tilings 
mig-ht not remain '"cohered'' after tlie cessation of the electric oscilla- 
tions, he devised a mechanical ''tapper." on the principle of the 
common electric doorl)ell, the hanmier of which was caused to tap 
the glass tube as long as the electric oscillations continued (tig. '.'>). 
The tilings thus virtually take the place of a key in the ordi- 
nary telegraph circuit. In the normal state the key is open; in 
the presence of electric oscillations the key is closed. Thus, 
by opening and closing the key for a longer or shorter period, 
PQ^gpgp signals corresponding to dots and 

dashes may be i)roduced. In othiM' 
words, by setting u|) electric oscil- 
lations for periods of time corres- 
pondijig to dots and dashes, mes- 
sages may be transmitted, and if

existence of atmospheric electricity, using for the purpose a vertical

While Dr. Lodge has since done important work in connection with 
wireless telegraphy, he was, at the time mentioned, presumably more 
absorbed in the subject from the purely scientific standpoint than 
otherwise, and although he then, in 1894, intimated that signals 
might be transmitted to a distance of half a mile by Hertzian 
waves, it was not until Marconi began his memorable work that 
really practical results were obtained. 

In the operation of his wireless telegraph system Marconi uses 
an electric oscillator (figs. 4 and 5), the Branly coherer k, the Lodge 
tapper /, in a local circuit, and the Poppott' vertical wire A, at 

the sending and receiving stations, all of 
which devices, as has been shown, were 
well known, and it has been by modify- 
ing, improving, and perfecting these 
devices, and by adding others, that 
Marconi has been enabled to obtain his 
excellent practical results. The im- 
provements and additions that have, 
perhaps, conduced more than anything 
else to the first successful results ob- 
tained by Marconi were those that re- 
lated to the coherer and the vertical 
wire. The sensitiveness of the coherer 
he increased greatly by diminishing its size, compared with the Branly 
coherer, and by employing a mixture of nickel filings and silver — 90 
per cent of the former and 10 per cent of the latter metal. He 
also placed the few filings used in a vacuum. The other instru- 
ments, shown in fig. 5, are the relay, R, controlled by the 
coherer, and an ink-recording instrument, E, controlled by 
the relay. This figure illustrates the earlier arrangement of 
Marconi's devices. In it the coherer is 
directly connected with the lower end of 
the vertical wire by one of its terminids 
and with the earth by its other terminal. 
In his later work, Marconi has dispensed 
with the filings coherer, now employing 
a magnetic detector, which is much more 
sensitive than the coherer and does not 
reciuire tapping. 

Beginning his experiments in Italy in 
1S95 with vertical wires 20 feet in height, 
Marconi foiuid that he could get signals 
at a distance of 1 mile, and that by dou- 
bling the height of the vertical wire at both stations signals could be 
transmitted to four times that distance. Thus, with wires 40 feet 
high he could signal 4 miles, and with wires 80 feet high, 1(3 miles.

devices.

Since then Marconi luis .steadii}' increased the height and nunilxn- of 
the vertical wires, and also the distance to which signals can he trans- 
mitted through fi-ee space, and in his latest tests about 50 vertical 
wiies over 250 feet high are used, and the distance to which signals 
are transmitted is over 2,000 miles. 

The amount of electrical energy emplo}^ed in setting up the electric 
oscillations for a distance of, say, 200 miles is about 150 wiitts (lo volts 
and 15 amperes), or about one-tifth of a mechanical horsepower. The 
source of the electrical enei-gy is a storage battery, which latter is 
usually charged by a largt^ munber of dry cells. In ])assing, it may l)e 
remark(Hl that an oi'dinary telegraph relay may be operated 
at a distance of 200 miles at an expenditure of o watts at 
the transmitting end of a telegraph wire, or with one-fiftieth 
of the energy used in operating the electric oscillator in 
question. The actual energy required to operate the tele- 
graph relay is about 0.2-t of a watt, the rest of the energy 
A 1)einp" consumed in the wire itself. 

] It nuist not, however, be assumed 
• ; from this that the coherer is a less 
sensitive electric receiver than the 
relay; nor will it be, when it is 
reflected that the electrical energy 
expended in the case of the relay 
is, so to speak, mainly confined 
to the wire, as, analagously, sound 
waves are confined within a speak- 
ing tube, whereas the electrical 
energy of the oscillator is radi- 
ated into space in every direction, 
and thus but a small portion of the total energy reaches the receiv- 
ing vertical wire. It has )>een calculated that the electrical energy 
received on a surface 1 foot scjuare at a distance of but 1 mile from 
the oscillator is less than one three-hundred-millionth of the total 
energy radiated, and it may ])e noted the energy actually radiated as 
electric waves is a mere frsiction of the energy consumed in and at the 
oscillator. 

P^'om the results ol)tained l>y Marconi and others it appears that 
the etiect of increasing the length of the vertical wires is to give a 
greater radiatnig surface at the transmitting end and to present at the 
receiving end a larger surface upon which a greatiu- luuuber of circles 
of waves may fall, each circle of waves adding to the electrical energy 
set up in the receiving vertical wire. This view is seemingly borne 
out by experiments made by Marconi with a metal cylinder 4.1 feet 
high and 1.3 feet in diameter, with which arrangement signals have 
been transmitted over 31 miles (tig. 6). The chief object of this

arrangement, however, is to secure a radiator having- large capacity 
for s^'ntonic purposes, to be referred to presently. 

The vertical wire is usually of stranded copper, about one-fourth inch 
in dianietc]', although Marconi for this purpose uses also strips of wire 
netting sihout 2 feet broad. On land the wire or netting is supported 
by masts of proper height, securely guyed. On ships the ordinary 
masts suffice. It is not necessary that the wire be suspended strictly 
vertically so long as the desired vertical height is ol)tained. The Avire 
is thoroughl}" insulated from the mast at the top by sticks of ru])ber or 
ebonite, and is led in througli an open window or -hatchway to the 
room where the transmitting and receiving appai'atus are situated. 
This thorough insulation is necessary, because, although the discharge 
knobs of the oscillator ai'e separated by an air space of only half an 
inch or less, the induction coil used in connection with the oscillator 
is often capable of producing a spark that will jump 10 or 12 inches 
through air. The actual appearance of the induction coil, discharge 
knobs, vertical wire, etc., is well illustrated l)y the upper figure on 
Plate III. The heavy current and high pressures in the circuits of the 
oscillator have necessitated the employment of a much larger key for 
manipulating the oscillator circuits than is used in ordinary Morse 
telegraphy. 

At an early period of the practical history of Hertzian- wave teleg- 
raphy it was seen that the usefulness of this art might l)e considerably 
curtailed by the fact that but one message could be transmitted 
between any two stations within the sphere or "radius" of influence 
of a transmitter, since tlie attempt to transmit even two messages at 
one time would result in an unintelligible mixture of both messages. 
Several inventors have been at work trying to overcome this defect, 
and, it is claimed, with success, notal)ly Dr. Lodge, Sig. Marconi, and 
Dr. Slaby, The plan followed })y these gentlemen has l)een that of 
emplo^'ing a syntonic or tuning method; that is, the transmitting and 
recei\'ing circuits are adjusted or "attuned"" to a given rate of 
electrical oscillations. 

It is a well-known experiment that when two' tuning forks having 
an identical fundamental rate of vibrations are placed in suitable 
proximity either fork may ])e set into vibration by air waves set up 
by the other foi'k and neither will be set into vibration by another 
fork of a difl'erent note. The tuning fork is a persistent vibrator ]>y 
virtue of two (lualities which it possesses — elasticity and inertia. 
When struck a smart blow, it moves from its point of rest; directly 
its elasticity i-eturns it to its point of rest, its inertia carries it past 
that point, its elasticity returns it to zero point, inertia carries it past, 
and so on, until the resistance of the air and other causes stop it. 
Analogously, an electrical circuit may be given, in almost an}' desired

proportion, the e([iiival(Mits ot" iiUH-hiinical iiicrtia, elasticity, aiul resist- 
ance, in inductance, capacity", and ohniic resistance, respectively; and 
the rate ot" electric oscillation of a circuit may be yaried by 
^'aryino• these factors — the smaller the factors the higher the 
rate of oscillation. 

When, then, the receiving- circuit of a wireless telegraph 
system is accurately tuned to oscillate in harmony with the 
transmitting circuit, which can ])o done by giving the respec- 
tive circuits practically equal inductance, capacity, and resis- 
tance, the receiving circuit will respond only to the oscillations 
set up l)v a transmitter corres]^ondingly tuned. At least, this 
is, l)rietly, the theory on which these experiments are ])ased. 
'"") In experimenting, Marconi and others have, it is stated, found 
") that perfect syntony between the respective stations is not 

absolutely essential, l)ut that if ther(> is 
a marked divergence of frcNjuency of 
oscillation between them the receivers 
will not respond to any Init their cor- 
respondingly attuned transmitters. 

The arrangement of Marconi's tuned 
transmitting and receiving circuits is 
outlined in tigs. 7 and S. It will there be 
seen that the oscillator and the coherer 
/• are not connected to the earth, as in 
Marconi's first experiments, but arc 
kept in electrical connection tiierewith 
by a small induction coil 7'. In tig. 7, .1 is the Acrtical wire, which is 
attached at its lower end to a coil of wire //'. The end of the wire d 
which forms part of the secondary wire of the induction coil T, 
may be connected to any desired turn of the coil /r. By this 
means the inductance of the vertical wire circuit may be varied, 
and its oscillation period thereby be made to correspond with 
that of the circuit y5, of the oscillator, which includes the pri- 
mary \vire of T; C is an adjustable condenser of very small 
capacity, ])y varying which the oscillation period of the circuit 

uiay readily l)e varicnl. An 
electrical condenser is vir- 
tually a Ley den jar, arranged 
in a con\-eni(Mit foi-m. In this 
case it consists of a few siiects 
of tin foil or copper, th(» alter- 
nate sheets ])eing se])arated 
from each other by thin sheets 
of paraffin paper. A key controls tlu^ storage battery circuit, as 
shown in tig. 7, and, thereby, the oscillator circuit; J/is the induction 
coil of the oscillator.

270 WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY. 

The tuned receiving apparatus is shown in fig. 8. In this figure, A 
is again the vertical wire with the turns of wire v\ to which is attached 
the primary wire p of the induction coil T; d is the secondar\' of the 
same induction coil; ck are "choke'' coils; A- is the coherer, c is a con- 
denser, and R is the relay. The induction coil T acts virtuallj^ as a 
step-up transformer, materiall}^ enhancing the electromotive forces of 
the received oscillations, and thus increasing the signaling distance. 

Marconi has found it important that the oscillation period of the 
coherer circuit, shown in the figure in solid lines, shall be the same as, 
or an octave of, the oscillation period of the vertical wire circuit, 
shown by the dotted lines. This can be done by making the secondary 
coil ^j), of the coil T^ equal the length of the vertical wire A. The 
transmitter circuit is then adjusted so that its oscillation period cor- 
responds with that of the receiving circuit. This is brought al)out by 
varying the capacity of the condenser in fig. 7. The method of obtain- 
ing this "balance," as practiced by Marconi, is to begin with very 
little capacity in the condenser, and adding to it until the best results 
are obtained at the receiving station. If, when the best results are 
obtained, still further capacity is given to the condenser in the trans- 
mitting circuit, the signals fade away, showing that then the two circuits 
are out of harmony. 

Marconi also found that b}^ means of tuned apparatus a much greater 
distance may be reached, with a given soui'ce of electrical energy and 
height of wires. For example, a transmitter which would ati'ect a 
tuned receiver 30 miles away would not afi'ect a nontuned receiver 
160 feet distant. This, it may be assumed, is because in the case of 
the tuned receiver the faintest oscillations, or electromotive forces, set 
up in the receiving circuit by the incoming waves are in unison with 
those waves, and successive incoming waves amplify the oscillations in 
the receiver circuit until they affect the coherer; whereas the oscilla- 
tions which the same waves tend to set up in the nontuned receiver 
circuit are, so to speak, out of step with the natural rate of oscillation 
of the nontuned circuit, and thus as frequently oppose as assist the 
natural oscillations of the circuit. 

In connection with the experiments carried on by Marconi, it is 
reported that two difi'erent messages have been received at one time 
on a vertical wire, two sets of receiving apparatus, each attuned to a 
different rate of oscillation, being connected with the same wire. To 
those who have had experience with (Iray's harmonic system of wire 
telegraphy," in which three and four instruments, attuned to transmit 
and to receive different rates of electrical current pulsations, have 
been successfully and separately operated on one wire, this Avill not 
appear astonishing, since it is quite conceivable, if it be granted that 
wireless transmitting and receiving apparatus can ))e successfully 
attuned, that two or more receiving instruments might be connected

271 



with one vertical wire, and each set of apparatus select and respond 
only to the particular rate of oscillations to which it is attuned. 

However, while the successful operation of contig-uous tuned cir- 
cuits is quite within the possibilities, it is reported, as a result of 
numerous tests in France and elsewhere, that freedom from inter- 
ference with tuned apparatus is not yet secured. But if by the use of 
tuned, apparatus nothing else were gained than the abilit}^, with a 
given amount of electrical energy and a given height of vertical wire, 
to transmit signals to a greater distance than is possil)le with untuned 
apparatus, it imist be considered a decided advance in the art, and, 
judging by the whole progress of electrical telegraphy, it is safe to 
say, when so much has already been achieved, that the necessary 
improvements to obtain at least practical freedom from interference 
between adjacent apparatus will ultimately follow. 

The specimen of a dot and dash wireless telegraph record given in

yacht races of 1899 in New York Harbor. Mr. Marconi had his

Clarke wireless telegraph apparatus which the writer was siii)ervis- 
ing on the steanishi]) Le Li randc l)nche><x!e. This was proljably the 
Hrst instance of tapping Hertzian wave signals, in the United States 
at least. It will ])e understood that Shr. is an ab])reviation for Shant- 
rocl: Other al)breviations were used in these bulletins, as Col. for 
(hlwinhia; abt. for al)out; l)d. for board, etc. The present si)eed of 
signaling by wireless telegraphy when the tilings coherer is used, is 
from 10 to 20 words per minute; but it seems reasonable to expect 
that, with further improvements in the art, expert manipulators 
of the key should eventually attain a considerably higher speed of 
transmission. 

For practical purposes there is not much doubt that wireless teleg- 
raphy will find its greatest tield of usefulness between vessels at sea, 
or between vessels and the mainland, or between points divided by 
the sea where it is not deemed feasible or profitable to lay a cable. 
Numerous examples of such uses are already in evidence. There is, 
for example, a wireless circuit between some of the Sandwich Islands; 
another between the Lizard, Cornwall, and St. Catherines, Isle of 
Wight, 186 miles apart, and between Poole and St. Catherines, 31 
miles apart. The British Admiralty have also adopted the system for 
many of their war ships and for some of their land stations. In all, 



272 WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY. 

they have about -io sets of such wireless telegraph apparatus installed. 
The length of vertical wire of these stations is about 150 feet. The 
war ships thus equipped have signaled each other when 100 miles 
apart. The wireless system is also installed at different points on the 
continents of P^urope and America — at La Panne, Belgium, for exam- 
ple, and at Dorkum Island in the North Sea off the mouth of the Ems. 

A niun])er of light-ships have also been equipped with the wireless 
telegraph systems; for instance, the Goodwin Sands light-ship, the Bor- 
kum light-ship, 25 miles from the island of that name, and the Nan- 
tucket light-ship, off the Massachusetts coast, from which station 
passing vessels are daily reported to the mainland. 

Many mercantile steamships have also been equipped with the same 
sj'stem, notably the Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse^ of the North German 
Llo3^d Steamship Company, the DeidscMavd, of the Hamburg-Ameri- 
can Line, and the vessels of the Cunard Line, and many others. Fre- 
quently vessels thus equipped have communicated with one another 
]>3* wireless telegraphy in mid ocean, and while out of sight of each 
other, communication being thus kept up for hours while the vessels 
were passing in opposite directions. 

There is little doubt that the use of wireless telegraph systems by 
the navies of the world will become general in the near future. There 
are several reasons why such systems are especiall}" applicable to, and 
desirable on, war vessels, which depend so largely on signaling. For 
instance, signaling by the Hertzian waves is more successful over 
water than over land, greater distances being reached over water. 
The vessels already carry the necessary masts for the vertical wires; 
the apparatus, including batteries, does not require to 1)e portable; 
there is at present no other practicable method of signaling at sea to 
a distance of even a few miles in foggy or hazy weather. 

With regard to the use of wireless telegraphy for military purposes 
in actual warfare, the problem is somewhat different and the obsta- 
cles to its use are considerable. Thus the question of obtaining and 
transporting the masts for the vertical wires is a serious one. This 
was one of the difficulties met with in the South African war. The 
matter of providing in an easily porta])le and reliable form the elec- 
trical energy reciuired for the operation of the oscillator is also likely 
to be rather difficult under some circumstances. Should the cjdinder 
arrangement enq)loyed by Marconi be found suitable for land work, 
this would be a decided gain, and if by this means a reasonal)le dis- 
tance, say iT) to 50 miles, could be covered ]»y wireless telegraphy, it 
would be a very valuable addition to military signaling in the ffeld. 

There is, however, nearly always in land operations the alternative 
of wire telegraphy, and while the dilliculties of transporting the poles 
and wires for such systems arc frecjuently very great, they have rarely 
been found insurmountable, and where this may be the case, as when

ail enemy i.s between ii roliovino- jinny and a heleai^'uered (garrison, it 
is very probable that the enejptiy, ])y keeping- up a "'cross tire" of 
electric waves, could prevent coniniunication by means of wireless 
telegraphy with the beleaguered army. 

As to the commercial or monetary value of wireless toleg-raphy, it 
is yet too early to comment. Commercial trans- Atlantic wireless 
telegraphy has been promised since the early part of 1001, but it is not 
yet, at the end of 1902, accomplished. It is understood that the ^lar- 
coni Compan}^ receives from the British Admiralty £HH) \)ov annum 
for lifteen years, presumably during the life of patents, for each sta- 
tion equipped. The Borkum lightship is what may l)e termed a wire- 
less telegraph ''pa}" station," and according to the German postal 
authorities, which control this station, 565 messag'es were handled 
during live and a half months, or al)out three messages per day. of 
which 518 messages came from ships at sea, while 17 were transmitted 
to ships. A large percentage of these messages were to and from 
North German Lloyd steamers. 

Since the tirst announcement of Marconi's successes with wireless 
telegraphy many aspirants for honors in the same field have naturally 
arisen, but so far as actual commercial results are concerned Marconi 
has hitherto kept well ahead of other workers along this line. But 
more recently such companies as the De Forest in this country and 
the Slabo-Arco and the Braun in Europe are operating in numerous 
instances with success. 

To obtain the greatest deg-ree of usefulness from wireless telegraphy, 
when it is employed to prevent collisions at sea and to send informa- 
tion from vessels in distress or when approaching or departing from 
their respective harbors, which are popularly supposed to ])e the func- 
tions for which this system is especially adapted, it would appear to be 
essential that every vessel sailing the main should be ecpiipped with 
the apparatus. The writer can say from experience that it requires 
a considerable degree of expertness to maintain the apparatus in proper 
working order, and even when code' signals only are employed a fair 
amount of intelligence is recpiired. It is therefore a question whether 
the reipiisite skill and intelligence would l)e available at all times on 
all kinds of craft. 

There are, however, d()u))tless a great many places where the neces- 
sary ex[)ertness of operators is available, and in which, therefore, the 
full value of the system will be realized. In fact, it may ])e stated 
that a vastly larger employment of wireless telegraphy is already 
assured, since the Lloyds, whose extensive maritime interests are 
world-Avide, have <Mitered into a contract with the Marconi Interna- 
tional Marine Communication Company to equip all their coastwise 
signaling stations with this system, jind to transmit and recene mes- 
sages to and from all })assing vessels similarly e(|uipped, at a regular

tarili' rate of about 12 cents per word, this ag-reeiiient to extend over 
a period of fourteen years, and in this countr}^ as well as in Europe. 
Already in the comparatively few instances where the system has 
been introduced its great utility and importance have been amply 
demonstrated, 

A number of vessels equipped with wireless telegraph apparatus 
have signaled for aid for themselves and for other vessels in distress; 
necessary supplies for light-houses have by this means been procured

TELPHERAGE. « 



Bv Chari.es M. Clark/' 



Definition. — Telpherage is derived from two Greek words "• r^A^f " 
aud " (/>6/3&7/' "Tele" means far, and '"ferro" means to l)ear 
or to carry. Therefore, tel\:)tierag"e means far-carrying. The same 
word '"tele" appears in telegraph and telephone. The word was 
originally invented l)y the late Prof. Fleeming Jenkin. who was 
the early spirit of telpherage, and but for his nntimely death tel- 
pherage woukl be even more extensively used. Like many other 
words, its meaning has varied. In the l)eginning it meant, practicalh', 
aerial electrical transportation, but now it has been brought back to 
its original meaning, which is the transportation of material to a dis- 
tance by electricity, overhead, or sometimes on the surface, or even 
underground. In the latter case,, it is termed "tubular dispatch." 
Therefore, telpherage may l)e. concisely defined as the electrical trans- 
portation of material. The method of applying it' is an engineering 
problem and must depend upon local conditions, and even to-day the 
term "telpherage engineering" is becoming a common expression. 
It will be noticed that the word "automatic" is left out in these 
definitions. The reason for this is that it is a commercial (juestion, 
and in cases where a man is requirc^d to attend to certain ])ortions of 
the w^ork, it is often cheaper for the man to go with the load than to 
use automatic devices. As to whether it is better to make an installa- 
tion automatic or otherwise, depends entirely upon the comparative 
cost of the two methods of operation. In this connection it may be 
said that with telpherage plants the word " telpherman " is now often 
used.

276 TELPHERAGE. 

many men had experimented, and it i.s well known that some fort}" 
years ago an electric railway was operated having a speed of several 
miles per hour. It seems that it is necessary, with all successful 
applications of power to the transportation problem, that much pre- 
liminar}^ work, seming-ly unproductive, must be done. It often hap- 
pens, as in the case of early telpherage, that the times were not ripe 
for its commercial adaptation. In the history of telpherage in Eng- 
land, a telpherage line was installed using what was then called the 
series system, whereby it was necessary to use a telpher with a num- 
ber of trailers. One section was positive and the next negative, the 
current passing from one section of the track to the other through the 
motor, thereby completing the circuit. In passing over the insulator 
between the positive and the negative sections, there necessai'ily 
occurred considerable sparking, which greatly increased the cost of 
maintenance. It was also necessary to always have trains of certain 
lengths. There were many other disadvantages, such as having to use 
a track made of round bar rail and the difficulty of manufacturing 
reliable electric motors. If it was desired to install a telplierage 
plant it was alwa3^s necessary to put in an engine, boiler, and d>mamo. 
In comparison with its early history telpherage to-day possesses the 
advantage that every factory, where there is need for telpherage, 
either has its own electrical plant or the power ma}^ be rented from 
existing central stations or even street-railway stations. There are 
also to-day for aerial transportation most excellent cables made 
especially for telpherage work, and likewise, where it is more desir- 
able to use than solid rail cable, special shapes have been devised 
which give most excellent results. Motors, controllers, and carriers 
of great reliablity are now manufactured following the methods 
developed by the best railroad practice. 

Before it was decided to enter into the present commercial adapta- 
tion of telpherage, an engineer visited all the electrical manufacturing 
plants and electrical installations in Europe, and found that nothing 
was being done in the transportation of materia! electrically. In the 
United States many experiments had been made, but the inventors 
were always seeking the unobtainable. Upon careful research, it 
wa.s found that there were 450 })atents directly applying to telpherage 
and several hundred more which pertained indirectly to this sul)ject. 
Most of these original inventors were, however, too ambitious, and 
there was hardly any limit to the luimber of miles pei' minute which 
was to be achieved l)y the new and wondei'ful agent, electricity. Not 
only material was to be transported, ))ut also i)assengers, and ))eauti- 
ful cars of mahogany were built and put in e.\p(>rimental operation. 
Cigar- shapt'd cari'icu's were de\ise<l, some of which made a speed of 2 
miles per minute or more, and when it was impossible to attain a 
greater speed there was great discouragement. There are no authentic

veying material Ix'tween two points, o'encrally in a straig-ht line, 
placed in some vacant lot or loft, and tluu'ii seemed to he a desire to 
force the method of transportation according to certain preconceived 
ideas, rather than to pay the necessary attention to its commercial 
adaptation. 

Coihstru<'th»i. — On account of various advantages in regard to the 
distribution of material — such as depositing at an elevation — most of 
the telpherage plants thus far installed have l)een overhead. As engi- 
neers, you will be most interested in hearing what has been accom- 
plished. The descriptions are, therefore, contined to overhead work. 
Under the head of construction, it may be stated that the track is made

The cal)le tracks are supported every 100 feet, provided it is con- 
venient to ei-ect poles or structures. Wher(\ thei'e ar(>. deep ravines 
or l)etween u[)])er stories of factories, the span is made to correspond 
with the distance, and ctui be made of any reasonable length. In 
addition to th(> track cable, upon which the telpher runs, thcM'e is also 
what is known as the suspension cable. As is well known, it would 
be impossible to prevent considerable sag in the track cable and then^- 
fore the track cable is suspended from this suspension cable by means

of hangers. The numbei- of these hang-ers would depend upon the 
length of the spans. It will be easily seen that it is possiljle to have the 
center of the spans higher than the ends by merely raising the sus- 
pension cable and the hanger. This obviates one of the early diffi- 
culties met in the use of cable for telpherage, as there is now no 
objectionable deflection in the cable when the telpher approaches a 
bracket. There are several methods of connecting the track and sus- 
pension cables by means of the hangers. The sizes of the ca))le, 
hangers, and brackets vary, depending upon the weight which comes 
upon each individual span. The support was either simple poles with 
a bracket, or what is known as the ''A'' construction or ordinary cross 
bents. Cable construction costs less than solid rail, except where

supported by another cable, which is called the suspension cable. It would be impossible with 
long spans to stretch a cable so that under load there would not be con.siderable deflection. This 
deflection or sag is taken up by the suspension cable. Not only ca!i we make the track cable 
horizontal but even higher in the center than at the terminals. 

there are many switches, in which cases the })riccs of solid rail and 
cable appi'oach each other. In general, cable lines arc recommended 
for straight lines, except where the weight is excessive. 

In solid rail construction, the supports are ordinarily placed 16 
to 20 feet apai't; longer spans are used if it is not convenient to erect 
supports. On long spans, the track consists of a girder rail with the 
track rail above it. It is not possible to give any general rule as to 
what kind of track it is advisable to use, as this is a factor of the 
length of the spans and the weight. The weights conveyed thus far 
})y tcli)h(M-age vary from 125 to LO.OOO pounds, and the cost varies 
accordingly. It will be readilv understood that when the weights are

279 



greater, the supports must l)e iieurcr together, mid the cuhles oi' gir- 
ders heavier. Running parallel to the track rail, either above or at 
the side, and depending upon the amount of head room, are stretched 
one or more trolley wires; one wire, if the track be used as a return. 
If, however, it is desired not to use the track as a return, or to use 
alternating current, two trolley wires are employed. There are many 
other details of construction which the illustrations show better than 
any description. 

Telplwrx. — According to the construction, telphers are divided into 
three distinct classes, center-hearing, side-bearing, and alternate-bear- 
ing. The center-bearing has two motors, one on each side of the 
track; the side-bearing has l)oth motors on the same side, and the 
alternate has one motor upon one side of the track and the other 
motoi- upon the other side, l)ut not upon the same shaft. Illustrations 
of some of these telphers are shown, also the same in operation. All 
the weight in the side-bearing telpher is utilized for traction, and the 
load is suspended beneath the driving wheels. Sometimes two telphers

to 1, 200 feet per minute. Side-dumping bucket operated by telpherman; controlled from either end. 
Telphers can be operated separately. Three of these double telphers have a capacity of 250 tons

are connected up together in a single truck, this giving what is called 
a double telpher; or a trailing wheel is used after a double telpher in 
order to distribute the weight over a greater portion of the track. 
This is ne(*essary when the weight of the load to l)e carried is great. 
Fig. 8 shows quite fully this weight distribution. In all telpherage 
work gears are rarely used except for very heav,y work or on steep 
grades. The frames of the later telphers are made in one casting, and 
the driving wheels are of steel, this having ))een (h^termined to be the 
best material. 

JIotoTH. — The motors are waterproof and dust proof and are com- 
pound wound for automatic work. When a telpherman goes with the 
telpher the series winding is employed. There is also used a special 
series coil to give greater tonjue when starting. The telpher is placed 
above the track, thereby keej)ing the motors from injury, while there 
is also no danger of their coming in contact with the carriers or being- 
otherwise injured. 



280 



TELPHERAGE. 



Hoists. — The hoist is suspended below the telpher, or sometimes 
from a trailer drawn by the telpher. Special attention has been paid 
in the later designs of hoists to use as little head room as possible. It 
was deemed best at first to combine the telpher and hoist all in one, 
but there were so many cases where it was necessary to use the telpher 
alone without the hoist, and also where it was advisable to put the 
hoist on the trailer instead of on the telpher, that experience has shown 
it is better to make the telpher and hoist two separate pieces of appa- 
ratus. Greater simplicity has also been obtained and a correspond- 
ingly lower maintenance reached. There are many other interesting 
details concerning hoists, as to the speed, lift, and construction, which 
it is necessary to omit here. 

brakes. --Two distinct types of brake are used on telphers, either 
hand brakes or solenoid brakes, both of which are arranged to apply

pressure to the wheels or to grip the track. In regard to the solenoid 
brake, it is only necessary to explain that it works automatically, the 
solenoid being placed in series with the armature. A spring normally 
holds the brake on the wheel or the track. If, however, from any 
cause the amount of current passing through the solenoid is reduced, 
whether by means of external resistance^ or ])V reason of the additional 
counter-electromotive force generated by the armature, due to running 
at a high speed, the solenoid becomes weakened ami the brake is applied. 
An air cushion is arranged so that the brakes will be applied gradually.

to be carried, especially over one track, to use trailers. These con-

may require. For heavy traflic it is customary to arrange a long train

with four or live trailers, then anoJiier telpher and four or five trailers, 
and a telpher at each end. The placing- of these telphers at intervals 
greatly adds to the traction, while the distribution of weight over the 
whole span, or over two or three spans, enables much lighter construc- 
tion to be used for greater capacity.

liy means of space-covering or movable telpher tracks coal can be 
deposited or removed from any portion of the storage yard, and not 
merely from beneath the telpher track. This track, mo\al)le by hand

line should be single or double and the weight to be carried by each 
unit. The installations should be so planned that the expense will be 
reduced to a miiiinuuii, and, further, that the track will not interfere 
with existing machinery or buildings, taking care to avoid an excessive 
number of curves and switches, as these add more or less to the expense, 
particularly to the cost of erection. 

Method of operation.- -It is difficult to treat in a general way of the 
method of operation. In automatic lines it is necessary to provide 
appliances whereby it is impossible for an unskilled operator to injure 
the telpher. In order, therefore, to provide for contingencies, a 
"dead section" is placed at each end of the line, the middle of the 
line being generally left alive. Upon closing a spring sAvitch, the 
dead section is energized so long as the operator keeps his hand on the 
switch, which is usually only a few seconds, during which time the tel- 
pher passes to that portion of the line which is always aliv^e. When 
it reaches the other end it comes upon the dead section and then either 
slows down of its own accord, or else a mechanical or solenoid brake is 
applied. The telpher then passes under the reversing arrangement 
and it is therefore reversed, either with no current in the line or else 
with a high resistance. If the telpher is at the farther end of the line, 
the operator at the near end, by closing a switch, can bring it 1)ack to 
him. The dead sections at the end of the line, which have current 
only so long as the hand is held upon the spring switch, render the 
line as safe as possible against the telpher coming in contact with the 
terminal posts. An automatic block system prevents collision of 
telphers. 

Carves. — The curves are solid rail and likewise the trolley track, 
where there is a curve, especially when it has a short radius. Where- 
ever it is necessary to pass around a curve, to take turnouts or cross- 
overs, a resistance is inserted in the trolley circuit, where])y the telpher 
automatically I'educes its speed while it is traversing the curve or turn- 
out or approaching a cross-over switch. As soon as it reaches the 
other side of the curve it receives full voltage and continues at its nor- 
mal speed. In regular service the speed yaries from 8U<J or 800 feet 
per miiuite up to 20 miles per hour, or even more, when required. 
The slower speeds are used when the lines are short and where there 
are many curves, particularly for factory and foundry work. For 
lines running across the country a speed in excess of 20 miles per hour 
can l)e obtained, but with the higher speeds the cost of the construc- 
tion increases, certain special devices being necessary. Even for 
installations which are termed "cross-country work," 15 to 20 miles 
per hour has been foiuid amply sufficient. 

As to what the ultimate capacity on grades niay be, this has not 
been fully determined. Experimentall}^ more than 20 per cent has 
been reached. In actual practice the greatest grade equipped has been 
12 per cent, and thus far there seems to be ample traction.

what in the nature of a surprise when we consider that to carry half a 
ton on a level track at a speed of 6 miles per hour, nnich less than a 
horsepower is requin^d. including all losses. This is a revelation to 
most manufacturers. The aljsence of gearing, the motors being 
attached directly to the driving wheels, gives th(> highest efficiency 
pos.sible, as well as freedom from noise. 

The actual power consumed, according to the table given above, at 
6 miles per hour for 1,(HH) pounds on a level is only 0.16 horsepower. 
It is therefore seen that ample allowance is made for losses and extra 
weights not provided for in the load, such as down-comes, buckets, or 
carriers. The po^ver required increases greatly with the grades, and 
when this reaches certain limits it is deemed advisa))le to use gears in 
order to reduce weight of motoi's. 

Maintenance. — Although telpherage has not as yet been in operation 
for a sufficient number of years to determine exactly what the main- 
tenance will be, 3^et, at the same time, in lines that have been operated 
for a j^ear and a half the maintenance has been exceedingly small. As 
stated above, the driving wheels being of steel, none of them has thus 
far shown any signs of wear, and trailer wheels are of the same material 
and type which have l)een used on mechanical cable lines foi- ten yc^ars 
and are still in good serviceable condition. The motors, on account 
of their elevated position, have shown a better mainteniince than sta- 
tionary motors of the same type. This may possibly be from the 
extra care taken in their construction. In regard to the track, this 
has also shown most excellent results, also due to the fact that it is 
above grit and dirt and crossing teams and, when well painted, has 
shown little signs of wear or depreciation. Wherever a change is

brackets it is protected b}- what are called "shields," these being' 
arranged so that they can be readily replaced. The cable is also pro- 
tected at the hanger and l)rackets b}^ steel shields. 

Capacity. — An important feature in telpherage is the capacity of 
the line. In general, I can say that there is no other form of con- 
vej'or known which shows such flexibility. This is due to the use of 
electricity, and the features which apply to the street railway apply 
also to telpherage. There are two factors of special importance in 
relation to the capacity of the line: First, the speed, and second, the 
number of telphers and trailers. The line may be laid out with one

ing, cab for telpherman. The side elevation shows method of attachment to side of building and 
loading chute. 

telpher and a few trailers. More telphers or trailers may l)e added, 
and, if upon a single line, coupled in long trains. If it is desired still 
further to increase the capacity, the line may be made double, while, 
if desii'cd, the carriers may also b<> made continuous so as to take 
boxes and barrels or other freight as fast as they can l)e tlelivered to 
th(> carriers of the telphers and trailers. 

The lle.xibiiity of telpherage in r(>gar(l lo capacity is wonderful, and 
is a most im])()rtant Feature. In fact, it may ])e said that there is 
practically no limit to (lexibility. In one plant, about to be installed, 
the proposed capacit}' is jJ5() tons pei' hour, over a distance of one-half 
a mile, the material to be distributc^l ovei" an area of about an acre. 
An3'one who is familiar with conveying will note that there is no>

other system that can do this so economically, cheaply, and in a way 
so thoroughly satisfactory a manner as telpherag-e. 

The nature of installation varies with the amount of material to t)e 
carried, so that if the amount to l)e carried is small, the expenditure 
need not l)e great. 

Apph'caf/'ons of tclpheriKje. — There arc few factories where the 
installation of an overhead telpherage system would not prove a valu- 
able investment. The question is often asked: Is telpherage suited for 
carrying specitic articles? And the reply may be that it is adapted to 
the conveying of the products of almost every kind of manufacturing. 




Fjg. 9.— In sewer or trench excavation the method of operation is as follows: The bucket has 
attached to it a trailer wheel. The huckets and wheel are lowered into the excavation and the 
bucket, when filled, is raised by the electric hoist so that the wheel of the trailer engages the gravity 
rail. The load then passes by gravity to the place desired and is automatically dumped. This may 
be along the line of excavation, for refilling the trench, or to the right or left, for unloading into 
carts, or in connection with the telpher to any desired distance. The telpher has the (lexibility of a 
trolley car. This method is a comliination of telpher and gravity lines, and the amount of work that 
can be accomplished by it with the miniumm of labor is remarkable. 

In these days of consolidation of companies, factories cover immense 
areas. The individual buildings are frequently large enough in them- 
selves to utilize a tel})h('r liiH\ In many cases, on account of fire risks 
or of convenience in matuifacturing, the buildings are widely se})arated 
from each other, and yet constant communication is necessary. Over- 
head telpherage, therefore, in manufacturing establishments is used 
for carrying the law material, implements, and tini.shed products from 
one part of the gi'ounds to another, from one building to another, or 
even from one.part of a building to another part, moving raw material 
from cars or vessels to the works and then taking the finished i)roducts

to the railway station or the wharf for shipment, and for conveying 
refuse away from the factory. In this connection we might mention 
the conveying of ashes or slag to the dump heap. 

Telpherage may also be extensively used for handling coal. It 
serves to reduce greatly the cost of transportation on plantations and 
farms and may be economically used for handling coffee, sugar cane, 
tobacco, fruits, and hay and other like products. 

In general, it nia}- l)e $aid that wherever material is to be carried to 
a, distance there is no power so flexible, so economical in first cost of 
installation, costing so little for power or the expense of maintenance, 
and with such great capacit}^ as telpherage. It may, therefore, be 
designated a material transportation by an immaterial fluid, and may 
well be called one of the most important of the many adaptations of 
electricity.

any kind of material in any plant, plantation, or mine, each can be 
saved by the installation of telpherage. Any condition at any manu- 
facturing establishment which presents a requirement for hauling by 
man or team, whether in transmission of product during the various 
stages of manufacture, the movement of materials by which the prod- 
uct is to be treated, or the handling of fuel and ashes or other waste, 
is a logical opening for the installation of telpherage. 

When you install telpherage you employ a machine to do the work 
of men. Machinery is the most powerful factor for economy in pro- 
duction. Tclphcirage is almost human in its operation, w^orks any 
number of hours per day, and never tires. In many cases you start 
the telpher, it conveys, automatically leaves its load at the destina- 
tion, and returns for another load. Telpherage conv^eys 50 pounds or 
50,000 pounds, solids or liquids.

THE EVOLUTION OF PETROLOdlCAL IDEAS.' 



By J. J. Harris Teall, Esq.. M. A., V. P. R. 8. 



INTRODUCTION. 



The nineteenth centuiT, whose obsequies Me have so recently cele- 
brated, was born in what has been aptly termed b}^ Professor Zittel, 
our latest historian, the heroic age of geology. Geological societies and 
geological survejs did not then exist. Cooperative work was unknown; 
but a few individuals, of great power and originality, were laying the 
foimdations of our science on a firm basis of accurate observation 
Pallas had recently carried out his remarkable researches in eastern 
Russia, and had noted the extraordinary abundance of the remains of 
the mammoth, rhinoceros, and bison in the superticiai deposits of the 
Siberian plains. De Saussure had climbed Mont Blanc, and published 
his unrivaled descriptions of Alpine scenery and Alpine structure. 
Werner was still acting as an exponent of the science which he had 
done so much to foster, and had fired his two most illustrious pupils, 
L. von Buch and Humboldt, with that enthusiasm for natural knowl- 
edge which was destined to produce such glorious results. Hutton had 
just passed away, after giving to the world his Theory of the Earth, 
the main features of which form the basis of modern geology. Smith 
and Cuvier, both born in the same year (1769), were in the prime of 
life, and actively engaged in those researches which placed stratigraph- 
ical geologv on a secure foundation. These are some of the heroes of 
our science. 

The early history of geology is mainly a record of fantastic specu- 
lations; but in the heroic age it was beginning to be recognized that 
no solid advance could l)e made except on a basis of carefully observed 
fact. A reaction against the wild speculations of the seventeenth and 
the greater portion of the eighteenth centuries had set in, and this led, 
among other things, to the foundation of our society — the parent of all 
such societies — in 1807.

288 THE EVOLUTION OF PETROLOGICAL IDEAS. 

That it was necessary to put a curl) on the unbridled license of 
geological speculation, and to emphasize the importance of diligence 
and accuracy in the observation of facts, will be admitted by all students 
of the history of our science; but it is well to remember that there is 
a scientific, as well as an unscientific, use of the imagination. The chief 
glory of science is, not that it ])roduces an amelioration of the condi- 
tions under which we live, but that it continually enlarges our view, 
introduces new ideas, new ways of looking at things, and thus con- 
tributes in no small degree to the intellectual development of the 
human race. 

■ It is now generally recognized that the state of advancement of a 
science must he measured, not by the number of facts collected, but liy 
the niunber of facts coordinated. The old Baconian idea that it was 
only necessary to collect facts and pigeonhole them according to rule, 
in order to make the most brilliant discoveries, has been somewhat 
discredited b}" the history of scientific progress. Speaking on this 
subject, De Morgan saj^s: 

"Modern discoveries have not been made b}^ large collections of 
facts, with subsequent discussion, separation, and resulting deduction 
of a truth thus rendered perceptible. A few facts have suggested an 
hypothesis which means a supposition proper to explain them, the 
necessary results of this supposftion are worked out, and then, and not 
till then, other facts are examined, to see if these ulterior results are 
found in Nature. * * * What are large collections of facts for? 
To make theories from, says Bacon; to tr}^ ready-made theories by, 
says the history of discovery; it's all the same, says the idolater; non- 
sense, say we." 

Hutton appears to have been of De Morgan's way of thinking. He 
pondered over the facts that he had observed in England, France, and 
Scotland, and formulated his theory of the earth. He then went again 
into the field to test the consecjuences of his theor}^, and verified them. 
He never seems to have thought it worth while to describe isolated 
facts, or the structure of particular districts, except in so far as they 
illustrated his theory, although no one was l)etter qualified to do this, 
as all readers of his description of the unconformity at Siccar Point, 
of the granite veins in Glen Tilt, or of the geological features of 
Arran will readily admit. His joy at the discovery of the granite 
veins in (xlen Tilt can l)e easily understood. His theory required that 
they should exist, and they were found, not by chance, but because 
they were looked foi'. And we may ))e sure that the joy did not arise 
from gratified vanity, for, as Phiyfair says. h(> was one of thos(^ who 
took more delight in the coiitemi)lation of trutii than in the praise of 
having disc(>\-ered it. 

In thus calling attention to the inipoi-tance of ideas in scientific 
research, 1 trust it will not })c thought that 1 am advocating a return 
to the condition of things which prevailed in the early days of geolog- 



THE EVOLUTroN OF PETROLOGICAL IDEAS. 289 

ical liistoiy. AriiK-h:iir philo8<)[)liizing', apart from actual woi-k in the, 
field, the hiboratorv, and the museum, is by no means to be com- 
mended. But the worship of fact, as fact, may easily be overdone. 
The num])er of discoverable facts is practically intinit(\and it is there- 
fore possible to get into such a condition as not to Ije a])le to see the 
wood for the trees, to lose the due sense of proportion, and to become 
mere machines for tal)ulatino- intermina))le trixialities. 

On the other hand, it should ])e remembered that every worker 
endowed with imagination nuist fornudate, in his own mind, man}^ 
theories that will not stand the test of verification, and that it is quite 
unnecessary for him to trouble other workers with such theories. lie 
can test them for himself, and relegate them to oblivion if necessarv, 
without l)urdening our overcro^^ded bookshelves with crude specula- 
tions and unverihed hypotheses. 

It is only when a th(H)ry has proved its usefulness as a coordinator 
of fact that it becomes worthy of the dignity of pul>lication. It mav 
be true or false, most likely the latter; l)ut if it coordinati^s more facts 
than anv other it is at any rate useful and may be conveniently retained 
until replaced 1»y a Ix'tter. Controversy as to the truth or falsity of 
a theory often seems to me l)eside the mark, for if a given theory coor- 
dinates more facts than any other it is at least worthy of respect, and 
niay be tentatively held as a Avorking hypothesis, along with the con- 
viction that it is not true, or only partially true. Indeed, the contro- 
versial spirit is. in my judgment, inimical to the best interests of 
science. It makes a man more eager to refute than to understand the 
views of his opponents: it tends to check the flow of sympathy, and 
thus often ^jrevents that friendly cooperation which is so desirable in 
the interest of scientific progress. When controversy becomes acute, 
I alwa3's feel inclined to exclaim "'a plague on both your houses." 

Ever}^ branch of our man\"-sided science has l>enefited l)y the zeal 
for collecting facts which manifested itself during the earl}' vears of 
the nineteenth century. ^Methods of observation have been perfected, 
national survej's and private individuals have examined and are exam- 
ining- the geological structure of every civilized State, and explorers 
have penetrated to almost every <[uarter of the globe. Our li))raries 
and nmseums are being rapidly filled with records of all this scientific 
activity. Side ])y side with the registration and cataloguing of facts 
there has taken place an evolution of scientific ideas, and it is on this 
aspect of the subject, so far as my own special branch is concerned, 
that I propose to offer a few remarks. 

Rocks may be studied from two more or less distinct points of view, 
the descriptive and the aetiological. But it is well to note that the 
distinctness of these two points of view is but the expression of our 
ignorance as to.the genetic relationships of the different types. Facts 

SM 1902 19 



290 THE EVOLUTION OF PETROLOGICAL IDEAS. 

as to composition, structure, and the like, accumulate faster than 
they can be interpreted; and our classifications are therefore neces- 
sarily more or less artificial. But there is that within us which compels 
us to bring our classifications into accord with our views as to genesis. 
Phylogen}^ must in the end control classification both in the organic 
and inorganic worlds. As soon as we realize that any scheme of classi- 
fication places together objects which ha\ e no genetic relationship, or 
groups them irrespective of such relationship, we become dissatisfied 
with it. The old classifications need not be thrown over the moment 
that their imperfections are glimpsed; but in the end they have to be 
discarded, and the new ideas find expression in a new classification. 
Thus 

Thro' the ages one increasing pari;)Ose runs, 
And the thoughts of men are wideneil with the i>rocess of the suns. 

How far Hutton was in advance of his time on matters relating to 
petrogenesis is illustrated l)y the fact that more than half a century 
elapsed before his ideas found expression in systematic treatises. Yet 
the separation of rocks into igneous, sedimentary, and metamor})liic, 
and the further sul)division of the igneous rocks into plutonic and vol- 
canic, follow naturally and logically from his fundamental conceptions. 

The reason for the tardy recognition of what is now generally 
admitted to l)e the true basis of classification is not far to seek. 
Hutton was no systematist. Werner, on the other hand, was not onl}^ 
a keen observer, but he possessed in quite an exceptional degree the 
power of describing what he observed in precise and definite terms 
and of grouping his facts according to their supposed relationship. 
He was, in short, a born systematist, and this, combined with his elo- 
quence and enthusiasm, gave him a connnanding influence. In looking 
back at these two striking figures of the heroic age, Werner and 
Hittton, it is almost impossible to avoid a feeling of regret that the 
one did not possess what the other lacked. But such regrets are use- 
less. Let us honor them both. 

The authors of systematic treatises on rocks published during the 
first half of the century were all under the spell of Werner, and they 
were still further hampered b}' their ignorance of the composition of 
those rocks which are of so fine a grain that their constituents can not 
be determined with the naked eye or with the aid of a simple magni- 
fying lens. The treatises of Haiiy, Brongniart, and Leonhardt clearly 
recognized the great natural group of fragmental rocks; but the true 
limits of the other equally natural groups were, so far as general 
treatises are concerned, ])rouglit into prominence for the first time in 
the work by Von Cotta, the Knglish translation of which appeared in 
1866. 



THE EVOLUTION OF PETROLOGICAL IDEAS. 291 

PROGRESS DURING -T^HE FIRST HALF OF THE CENTURY. 

Igneous rocks played but a suiall part in the Wernerian system. 
They were regarded as stratified rocks melted by heat, due to the 
burning of coal ])eneath volcanic districts. We now recognize that 
they are of great importance, and probably represent the original 
source of all the other ro.cks. The clearing up of our ideas as to their 
nature and mode of origin centers round two controversies — one as to 
the origin of basalt, the other as to the origin of granite. 

It is difficult for us to realize the condition of things which prevailed 
during the early years of the century, when the martial spirit of the age 
seems to have affected the scientific world and a furious controversy 
raged between the Neptunists and the Yulcanists as to th(> origin of 
l>asalt. We look with a feeling of astonishment at the controver- 
sialists, condenm their methods, and admire the calm tigure of the old 
man Desmarest as he sits there refusing to be dragged into the con- 
troversy, and ([uietly replies to his challengers, ''Go and see." Now 
and again, in looking through some neglected cabinets of our nmseums, 
we come across dust-covered specimens labeled " Annnonites in basalt 
from Portrush,'' and are thus forcibly reminded of those stirring times. 

The controversv a^s to the origin of granite lasted hunger, and (hiring 
its later stages, at any rate, was conducted with dignity and a due 
regard to the amenities of scientific discussion. It resulted, moreover, 
in a very decided enlargemtmt of our conceptions as to su])terranean 
phenomena. The Wernerian \'iew that granite was a precipitate from 
a primordial ocean was compelled to give way as soon as the tectonic 
relations of granitic masses, so well described l)y Hutton, Playfair, 
and Sir James Hall, were clearly realized. The phenomena of granite 
veins, the occurrence of inclusions of the surrounding rocks, and the 
sharpness of the junctions between granite and the strata with which 
it is in contact prove beyond all doubt that th(^ material of which 
many granite masses are conjposed nmst have l)een intruded from 
l)elow in a plastic state. Toward the middle of the century these facts 
were generally recognized for all those masses \vhich occur outside 
areas of ciystalline schist. But their recognition, although conclusive 
as against the view that granite was eveiywhere a ])rim<)rdial sediment, 
by no means involved the necessity of accepting the Huttonian theor}' 
that it resulted from the consolidation of a mass of matter in a state of 
pure igneous fusion. 

The earlier phases of the discussion as to the origin of granite cen- 
tered mainly round the tectonic relations of the rock masses; but the 
later phases had reference rather to the composition and structure of 
the rock itself. The ])apers on this subject, and especially th(> discus- 
sion between Scheerer and Durocher, are well worthy of the attention 
of modern petrologists. 



292 THE EVOLUTION OF PETKOLOGICAL IDEAS. 

Scheerer maintained that the purel}' igneous origin of granite was 
disproved ))y three lines of argument. Thus he contended that the 
very presence of quartz was opposed to the theory, for this mineral 
could not be formed by igneous fusion, and was absent from lavas 
containing an excess of silica, such as obsidian, even when these lavas 
must have cooled more slowlj'^ than some granite veins. 

Again, the order of consolidation of the minerals, as determined by 
mutual interference, was not the order of their fusibilities. Fournet 
had endeavored to remove this objection by supposing that quartz, like 
water and sulphur, could be cooled below its proper melting point. 
But this theory of the surfusion of quartz was untenable, because the 
amount of overcooling was too great and the complete rest which was 
necessary could not be postulated. Scheerer admitted that the o])jec- 
tions to Fournet's theory were rendered less forcible by a considera- 
tion of the fact pointed out by Durocher, that the magma of granite 
did not contain the material of the separate minerals in a fused state, 
but consisted of a homogeneous liquid — a solution as we should say — 
so that the overcooling did not ati'ect quartz as such. This, however, 
in his opinion, did not justify the theory, for, to use a free translation 
of his own words: ""It is evident that the point of solidification of the 
silicate forming the magma out of which the different compounds are 
separated ought to approach the fusion point of silica as the quantit}' 
of bases in the liquid portion decreases." 

According to Durocher's view, the ultimate base of granite should 
consist, not of quartz, but of a substance like petrosiiex. 

A third line of argument, founded on the occurrence in some gran- 
ites of the peculiar p^a-ognomic minerals, such as gadolinite, was also 
brought forward by Scheerer. If a chip of isotropic gadolinite be 
heated to redness, a sudden and remarkable change takes place. It 
glows brightly for a few moments, and after cooling is found to have 
become denser and strongly birefringent. Thus gadolinite occurs in 
two phases; a lighter isotropic phase and a denser birefringent phase. 
The change from the former to the latter takes place at a red heat, 
and the reaction is accompanied by a considerable loss of energy, but 
little or no loss of material. The occurrence of this mineral in some 
granites proves, therefore, according to Scheerer. that they nuist have 
consolidated below a red heat. 

These three lines of argument, based on the presence of ((uartz. on 
the mutual relations of the constituents, and on the presence in some 
granites of pyrognomic minerals, concur, he considers, in disproving 
the theory of pure igneous fusion. 

Scheerer then propounds his own theory of a(|uco-igneous fusion, 
basing it on the fact that some of the granitic minerals, such as mica, 
contain water. The presence of even small quantities of water would, 
he maintains, lower the consolidation point considerably, and during 



THE EVOLUTION OF PETROLOCIICAL IDEAS. 298 

consolidation tho watci" would concentratt^ in tlic mother li(|U()r, and 
ultimately m th(> silica. Final consolidation would take place on the 
escape of tlie water. Thus tlu^ paradoxical ordei- ol' crystallization 
would be explained, and the oranite nught consolidate at a temperature 
which would admit of the formation of the pyronnomic nnnerals. 

The theory of 8cheer(>r was opposed by Durocher, and the contro- 
versy between these two distinguished men extended over a period of 
three or four years. Durochei" considered that a close exand nation 
of th(^ structure of graniti*. does not bear out the view that there is a 
well-defined order of consolidation. The minerals mutually interfere 
one with the other, sometimes one and sometimes another having' the 
advantage. The magma appears to have cooled down to a compara- 
tivelv low temperature, and tlien to have separated into definite com- 
pounds-which did not solidify instantaneously. Tln^ relative perfec- 
tion of form would, on this view, be largely determined l»y the relative 
power of crystallization of the different constituents. In this respect 
quartz is at a disadvantage. It possesses, moreovcn-, as shown by M. 
Gaudin, a great i-ange of viscosity, and when fused can be drawn into 
threads like glass and sealing wax. He agrees with Sche(>r(U- in reject- 
ing Fournet's theory of surfusion, and considers that the paradoxical 
order of consolidation can be explained l)y taking into consideration 
the wdde range of viscosity of (juartz and its slight t(Mid(Micv to crys- 
tallize. A similar view has recently been advocated by Professor doly. 
Durocher replies to Scheenn-'s argument derived from the absence of 
(juartz in obsidians by pointing to its presence in trachytes, and 
attempts, somewhat unsuccessfulh . to explain away th(> presence of 
the pyrognomic minerals. In his criticisms of Scheerer's views as to 
the amount of water present in granite he is often effective, for he 
shows that sufficient allowance had not been made for the effects of 
alteration. 

Scheerers view became the popular one, and is now generally held. 
It was greatly strengthened by Dr. Sorby's discovery of the widespread 
distribution of liquid ca\ ities containing water in the ([uartz of gran- 
ites, and 1)}^ the well-known synthetic experiments of Daubree and 
others. The failure of all attempts to produce granite is also still felt 
to be a strong argument against the theory of dry fusion. 

Scheerer concludes the discussion with some obser^'ations which I 
can not refrain from (pioting. He says: 

"To avoid misuiulerstanding, I desire to make; some remarks on the 
value which I attacdi not only to my theory of the origin of granite, 
but also to geological theories in general. I am far from believing 
that the igneous theory, which M. Durocher defends with so nmch 
vigor, is finally disposed of, or that my theory is completely satisfac- 
tory. Such deffnite conclusions can not lie reached in the presiMit state 
of our science. . More than one point of" view is possible on almost 
every subject of this kind. ;uid thus it must ever b(\ for mathematical 
certainty is unattainable. 



294 THE EVOLUTION OB" PETEOLOGICAL IDEAS. 

"A short time ago it seemed as if the Neptunean theories had com- 
pletely abandoned the field in favor of those volcanic theories which 
appeared so absurd to our ancestors. Now the Neptunean theories are 
beo-innini>- to show sions of life. I have endeavored to conciliate tiie 
two sister enemies by suogestino- that water may play an important 
part in the formation of fused rocks. * * * I do not prc^tend, 
however, that my theory is unassailable, or that it has been a])solutely 
demonstrated. * * * In my opinion a geological theory should 
not be considered as absolute; but it becomes probable when a consid- 
erablo number of facts group themselves around it, and its degree of 
probal)ility can be measured l\y its power of assimilating the new facts 
brought to light by the progress of science.'" 

These are wise words, and may well be remembered when differ- 
ences of opinion tend to become sharply accentuated. The path of 
science is littered with discarded theories, and this fact should serve to 
remind us that "we are none of us infallible, not even the youngest." 

In the discussion between Scheerer and Durocher attention was 
directed to the mutual relations of the constituents of granite and to 
the inferences Avhich could })e drawn from a study of those relations 
as to the order of consolidation of the minerals. 

THE CONSOLIT>ATTON OF IGNEOUS MAGMAS. 

At the time when the discussion took place this kind of reasoning 
could ])e applied oidy to coarse-grained rocks, l)ut with the advent of 
the microscope it became possible to extend it to the important group 
which had l)een designated in the earlier classitications as "apparentl}^ 
homogeneous rocks.'' In the early part of the century Cordier had 
proved, by the microscopic examination of the powder of l)asalt, that 
this rock was heterogeneous; but it was not till the examination of 
thin sections had been introduced that the nuitual relations of the con- 
stituents of the liner-grained rocks could ))e studied. In those rocks 
which have resulted from the consolidation of homogeneous silicate 
magmas, and in which the consolidation has been unaccompanied by 
the plieiiomcMia of resorption — that is, in which there has always been 
ecpiilibrium between tho constituents during the process of consoli- 
dation — the order of separation can l)e inferred from the microscopic 
struct ui'(\ 

It has thus beiMi estal)lished that the process of consolidation can )iot 
be divided into a number of sharply defined periods, each characterized 
by the separation of some one miiKM'al only, but that the times during 
which the diU'erent minerals are s(>pa rating out overlap to some extent. 
The amount of overlapping varies in different cases, and in one and 
the same magma is most marked in ])lutonic masses; whence we con- 
clude that it is largely determined by physical conditions, and especially 
pressure. 

The order of consolidation as determined by an examination of the 
mutual relations of minerals is, therefore, the order in which they com-

nionre to form, and this order may or may not a^roc with that in which 
they cease to form. The lawsyvhich expi-ess the ordei- of formation 
of minerals and the cheniical and physical conditions which conti'ol 
that ordor ha\'e not as yet Ikmmi detinitcdy established. 

One of the most important papers on theoretical peti'ology is un- 
doubtedly that by Professor Rosenbusch on the signiticance of the 
granular and porphyritic structures in massive rocks. The importance 
of this paper must not be judged simply by the amount of truth in the 
principles enunciated, but rather b}^ the stimulus which it gave to 
theoretical considerations and to researches directed toward a partic- 
ular end. The constitu(Mits of massive I'ocks are di\'ided by Professor 
Kosenbusch into four groups: 

1. The ores and accessory constituents (matiiictitc, liamatitc, ilmenitc, apa- 

tite, zircon, s])inel, and titanite). 

2. The I'erroinagncsiaii constituents (l)iotiti', lnn-nlilt'iidf, i>yi-()xcnt', aiid 

olivine). 
?>. The felspathic constitticnts ( rt'lsi»ar, uephelin*'. Incite, TncliUte, sndalite, 

and iiaiiyne). 
4. Free silica. 

Professor Kosenbusch pointed out that members of the iirst group 
precede those of the other grou])s; that in granites and syenites the 
members of the second group precede those of the third; but that in 
the diabases and ga))))r()s the order is inverted, and that in l)oth groups 
silica is the last. The general conclusion is reached that ""the order 
of consolidation of the silicates and, consequently, their crv>!tallo- 
graphic development (idiomorphism), corresponds to a law of decreas- 
ing basicity; the ores and accessor v minerals are the earliest, and 
quartz is the latest, product of the rock-forming process,'" 

This empirical law expresses, in a broad and general way, the main 
facts observed with regard to the sequence of minerals in the large 
and important group of intermediate rocks, but it breaks down when 
applied to the most acid and the most basic rocks; quartz is often 
formed before felspar in the former, and iron ores are not inf re((uently 
formed after felspar in the latter. 

The views that we hold regarding the laws which express the order 
of consolidation in igneous magmas will necessarily Ije colored by our 
conceptions as to the nature of these magmas. A great advance in 
the evolution of ideas on this subject is marked by a short letter, 
wi'itten by Bunsen to Streng, and published in tlu^ Journal of the 
(Terman Geological Society for ISOI. In this letter Punsen })oints out 
that the arguments against the igneous origin of granite, so far as they 
rest ujK)n the so-called anomalous order of consolidation of the miner- 
als, are based on a misconception of the nature of the process of con- 
sohdation. He says, 

"The temperature at which a substance consolidates from a state of 
fusion is never that at which it separates from a solution in aiKjther 



296 THE EVOLUTION OF PETKOLOQICAL IDEAS. 

substance. The temperature at which a definite sul)stance ciystallizes 
from its own liquid depends only on the substance and on the pressure 
to which it is subjected; whereas the temperature at which the same 
su])stance separates from its solution in another snl)stance depends 
principally on the relative proportions of the two substances. No 
chemist Avill fall into the error of assumino- that a solution ceases to be 
a solution at i^oo ,, 300'-, 400, .500 ,, or even when heated to a tempera- 
ture at which it becomes self-luminous; or will suppose that a crystal- 
line aggregate of ice and calcium chk)ride which has become tiuid is a 
solution, but that a mixture of quartz and felspar which has been f nsed 
is not." 

He then proceeds to point out that the laws which govern the solidi- 
fication of aqueous solutions must hold good also for igneous solutions; 
that by the addition of a certain amount of calcium chloride to water 
the teuiperature may be lowered to —10*^ C. without the separation of 
any solid substance; that by the addition of further amounts the tem- 
perature of consolidation of water ma}' be lowered as much as oif- and 
that of calcium chloride 100^. Other salts, such as the sulphates and 
nitrates of potassium, may be made to separate from aqueous solutions 
at temperatures from (JOO to 800 l)elow their freezing points; more- 
over, the order of consolidation is determined by the relative amounts 
of the two substances present; thus watei- may l)e made to consolidate 
before or after a dissolved salt by varying the concentration of the 
solution. 

I have given a somewhat full abstract of this important letter 
because 1 believe that the expansion of the idea which it contains will 
be the characteristic feature of the next great advance in petrological 
science, an advance which will come about, not so nmch Iw adding to 
our already large store of facts as b}^ dint of experiment controlled 
by the modern theory of solution, and carried out for the express 
purpose of testing the consequences of that theory and discovering the 
modifications which may be necessary to adapt it to igneous magmas. 

Almost all recent writers on theoretical questions relating to the 
igneous rocks have accepted the solution theoiy, and the condition of 
foiination of minerals has been discussed from this point of view. 
Crystals tend to form in a homogeneous liquid mass when the liquid 
becomes supersaturated with any definite compound. As soon as crys- 
tals arc developed the liquid in their unmediate neighborhood ceases 
to- be supersaturated, and there is thus esta))lished an osmotic force 
producing molecular flow from the supersaturated portions toward the 
growing crystals. 

From a consideration of the work of Pelouze on glasses, comluned 
with his own work on igneous rocks, Lagorio arrived at the conclusion 
that the ordinary rock forming compounds tend to separate out in the 
following order: Oxides, pure iron silicates, magnesian and ferro-mag- 
nesian silicates (olivine and rhombic pyroxenes), calc-magnesian sili- 
cates (monoclinic pyroxenes and hornblende), silicates of magnesium

iuul potiissiuin or of ii'on and ])otassiuiii (l)iotit<>). calciuin silicate 
(aiiorthite). silicates of sodium and calcium (plaii'ioclasc). sodium sili- 
cates (uci)heliuc and albitc). and lastly, potassium silicates (orthoclasc) 
in conjunction with ([uaitz. 

In his important work on slaos. Professor Vo^t has (dearly estab- 
lished the intluenceof the ridative ])r()portions of the bases to each other 
and to silica in determinintj;- the nature of the comi)ounds which sep- 
arate out. Thus in sla<4S in which the ratio of bases to silica corre- 
sponds approximately to that found in ])isilicates the ratio of C^a():MgO 
determines the foi-mation of such minerals as enstatite, auoit(\ and 
wollastonite. When th(^ ratio of MgO-fFeO : C'aO is o-reat(>r than 
2.44 : 1, enstatite forms: when the same ]-atio is less than 1.4 : 1, augite 
separates out. and continues to do so until this ratio ])ecomes less than 
.;^5 : 1; with a still further diminution in the ratio of mauiu^sia to lime, 
wollastonite is formed. 

In slags having approximat(dy the composition of nionosilicates the 
ratio of MgO+Mn04-FeO : CaO determines {\\o formation of olivine 
or melilite. When the above ratio is greater than J : 1.1 (in slags with 
al)out 2*) per cent of ahunina), olivine is formed; but when it is less 
than 1 : 1.2.5, melilite is ])roduced. 

The general concdusion arriv(Hl at as a result of the work of \ ogt, 
Lagorio, and others is that mass action and the affinities of the bases 
to ea(di other and to silica are the two factors of primary importance 
in determining the mohn-ular grouping, so long as the pressure 
remains constant. The action of alumina may 1)e espiM-ially referred 
to as illustrating tlu^ intiuencc^ of the mutual affinities of th(^ so-called 
bases. In the sorting of partners in accordance with the law of mass 
action this substance, when present in sufficient ([uantity, practically 
takes the whole of the alkalies and as much of the lime as is necessary 
to make felspathoid molecules. So marked is this action that 
M. Michel Levy and M. Osann. in calculating the results of 'analyses, 
cond)ine the whole of the alumina with the alkalies, when the latter 
are present in sufficient <|uantity, and associate any excess of alumina 
with lime in the form of fidspathoid molecules. It is only in those 
rocks that contain an abnormal percentage of alkalies that minerals 
like ivgirine and riel)eckite occur. 

This controlling influence of alumina, which has also been empha- 
sized ]>y Professor Iddings, has the most far-reaching eti'ects in determ- 
ining petrographical s|)ecies. It is as if there were a kind of repulsion 
between the ferromagnesian and alumino-alkaline constitutents. Dark 
rocks rich in the former, and light ro(d<:s ri(di in tla^ latter, represent 
the extreme forms of many internu'diate types; and Professor 
Brogger has recently proposed that this should receive expression by

the application of the terms me hi noc ratio atul leucocratie to these two 
strong!}^ contrasted varieties. 

The results already obtained leave no doiil)tthata properly- directed 
series of experiments will throw great light on the laws which control 
the formation of minerals during the consolidation of igneous rocks. 
The classic researches of Professor Foucpie and M. Michel Levy on 
the synthesis of such rocks as basalt, andesite, and nephelinite ])y pure 
igneous fusion show that we can control the necessary physical con- 
ditions, and that the whole suljject, so far at least as these rocks are 
concerned, lies within the range of experiment. 

The work of Morozewicz, to which I have directed attention in 
another place, may be mentioned as proving that a rich harvest of 
results may be confidently anticipated from experimental work in this 
direction. 

To return to the question of the order of consolidation of minerals 
in igneous I'ocks. If the solution theory l)e true, no order based solel}' 
on a consideration of the properties of the minerals can hold good in 
all cases. In the ease of aqueous solutions of two substances the order 
of separation, as pointed out l)v P)unsen, depends on the relative pro- 
portions of these two substances. Tliis subject, so far as alloys, fused 
salts, and aqueous solutions are concerned, was investigated with gr<^at 
skill ])y Professor (luthrie, the importance of whose work on aUoys 
has been brought into prominejice of late 1)V the researches of Rol)erts- 
Austen, Le ('hatclier, Osmund, J. E. Stead, Heycock and Neville, 
Alder Wright, and others. 

It is too early yet to discuss the full bearing of this recent work on 
petrographical questions, but it is impossible to examine the beautiful 
photographs which illustrate the structure of allo3\s — such, for example, 
as those accompanying the fifth report of the alloys research conmiit- 
tee,^' or those illustrating Stead's paper on iron and phosphorus,'' or 
Heycock and Neville's paper on gold-aluminium alloys,'' without being 
struck by the resemblance of many of these structures to those met 
with in rocks. 

Some years ago 1 directed attention to the possible application of 
Guthrie's work on cryohydrates and eutectics to petrographical ques- 
tions, and the experience since gained has tended rather to confirm me 
in the views which I then expressed. Fused salts which do not act 
chemically upon each other show, when mixed in eutectic proportions, 
a marked tendency to form spherulitic, and what may be called micro- 
pegmatitic, intergrowths. It has since been proved that the same is 
true of alloys. Thanks to the kindness of Mr. J. E. Stead, I am able 
to give two figures, drawn from photographs, which illustrate this

From this i)oint of view it becomes of interest to determine the

that fused micropegmatite melted .somewhat more i-eadily than ortho-

negative it, as tlie conditions of the experiment are cei'taiiily very 
different from those under which the rocks are produced. 

Quartz and ortlioclase have not as yet l)een formed by pure igneous 
fusion. IMie melting point at atmospheric pressure of a mixture of 
quartz and orthoclase is a])Ove tliat of ])asalt, and yet we know from 
the occurrence of anguUu" fragments of l)asalt in granophyre that the 
consolidating point of the mixture under certain conditions of pressure 
is below that of the fusing point of basalt under the same conditions. 
If, as Professor La^winson-Lessing's calculations suggest, the forma- 
tion of felspathic minerals is accompanied by an increase in volume, 
and the formation of ferro-magnesian minerals by a decrease in volume, 
pi'cssure will lower the fusing point of the former and raise that of 
the latter, so that under plutonic conditions the relative order of con- 
solidation of acid and basic magmas may be the reverse of that under 
volcanic conditions. Magmas usually contain water, and somc^times 
other volatile constituents (such as chlorine, boron, fluorine, etc.), 
whose importance in determining the fluidity and the molecular group- 
ing of the constituents has been generally rec'ognized since the pul)li- 
cation of the classic paper "'' Sur les Emanations Volcaniques et Metal- 
liferes," by Elie de Beaumont. When separated from the magma 
these constituents exercise most important metamorphosing and min- 
eralizing effects, as is well seen in the phenomena accompanying the 
formation of tinstone and apatite veins, in the development of zeolites, 
and in the production of large masses of kaolin. But so long as they 
remain in the magma they must be regarded as belonging to it and 
playing their part along with the other constituents in producing the 
final result. 

The application of the theory of solutions to igneous rocks is com- 
l^licated in many ways. We are ignorant of the manner in which the 
constituents revealed Iw analysis are distributed in the molten magmas, 
and of th(^ changes which take place in the molecular groupings as the 
temperature approaches the point of saturation. M. Le Chatelier has 
recently suggested that granite furnishes an illustration of the phase 
rule, and may be regarded as a stable system of three phases ((juartz, 
feldspar, and mica), made up of the three components — silica, alumina, 
an^ potash. Few petrographers will admit that the case can be put 
as simply as this. No d()u])t the consolidation of igneous magmas is 
governed by the phase rule, but in the majority of cases the number 
of components, on any view as to their nature, is too great to make 
the rule of much practical value. Another cause of complication arises 
from the fact that the physical conditions have often changed during 
the process of consolidation, thus giving rise to the phenomena of 
resorption; and yet another from the absence of assurance that the 
minerals seen in a rock have in all cases been developed fi-om a magma 
having the composition represented by the hulk analysis. 



THE EVOLUTION (W PETKOLOGICAL IDEAS. 301 

1 can not leave this portion of the suliject without calling" attention 
to the recent work of Professor Joly on the melting- points of the 
rt)ck-forniino- minerals, anclhis proof of the enormous rang-e of viscosity 
possessed by quart/ and other minerals. 

Whatever view we take as to the nature of silicate magmas, there 
can be no doubt that in general the process of consolidation is a process 
of dijftcrentiation. Detinite compounds separate out, either succes- 
sively or simultaneously, from a homogeneous magma, and at the time 
of their formation are in equilibrium with the surrounding liquid; 
but owing to changes in temperature and pressure the equilibrium 
established at one period may ho destroj^ed at another, and the igneous 
rock as we see it may not contain a record of all the operations which 
have taken place during the process of consolidation. So far as indi- 
vidual rocks are concerned, we look to experiment rather than to 
observation to give precision and deliniteness to our ideas regarding 
the nature of the changes which accompany solidification. 

THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES. 

The geologist, however, has to deal not only with igneous rocks as 
individuals, l)ut as groups, to consider their mutual relations, their 
geographical distribution, and mode of origin. But to give anything 
like a full account of the growth of ideas on this subject would 
expand this address to an inordinate length, and would, moreover, be 
a work of supererogation, for the whole question has been admirably 
reviewed by Professor Iddings and Professor Lcewinson-Lessing. 

The germs of all the theories which are now struggling for existence 
can be discovered in the writings of our predecessors. Scrope (1825) 
held the view that lavas were formed from previously crystallized 
rocks, such as granite, and maintained that in the process of eruption, 
or intumescence, as he termed it, a kind of differentiation might take 
place, giving rise to trach^'te and ))asalt. Darwin (1844). in his impor- 
tant work on Volcanic Islands, also discussed the origin of petrograph- 
ical species. He directed attention to two causes of ditferentiation 
which may ultimately prove to be of great importance — (1) the move- 
ment of crystals in a magma under the intluence of gravity, and (2) 
the squeezing or leaching out of the more fusible constituents from a 
partially consolidated or partially fused mass. The first of these he 
illustrated by the well-known Pattinson process for desilverizing lead, 
and the second might be illustrated by another metallurgical process 
often known as lifjuation (but quite distinct from the process referred 
to by Durochei- under the same name), by means of which silver is 
separated from blister copper. The copper is fused with a cei-tain 
proportion of lead, and the bars are maintained at a temperature al)ove 
the fusing point of the silver lead alloy and below that of copper. The 
silver lead alloy is thus leached out of the copper, which remains as a 



302 THE EVOLUTIOlSr OF PETROLOGICAL IDEAS, 

solid porouy mass. Such a separation might be eli'ected in the case of 
a plutonic mass, if a partially solidified magma were subjected to pres- 
sure under conditions which admitted of the escape of the still liquid 
portions into the surrounding rocks. As a matter of fact, it has been 
so applied by Mr. Barrow, who thus explains the relation between 
pegmatites and certain oligoclase-biotite-gneisses in the southern High- 
lands of Scotland. The eurite veins in granite are generally supposed 
to owe their origin to a somewhat similar action, but in this case the 
separation is due to the leaching out of the still liquid eutectic into 
cracks in the nearly consolidated mass, and not to orogenetic move- 
ments. It is comparable, therefore, to the liquation process above 
mentioned. 

Bunsen explained the varieties of igneous rock revealed by his 
analyses b}" assuming the independent existence of two magmas — the 
"normal pyroxenic'' and " normal trachytic'' — and supposing' a process 
of intermixture to account for the intermediate varieties. Von Walter- 
shausen thought that igneous magmas were arranged in a series of 
concentric shells, according to specific gravity. Durocher, in his cel- 
ebrated essay on (Comparative Petrolog}', maintained "that all igneous 
rocks, modern and ancient, were derived from two magmas which 
coexist l)elow the solid crust of the globe, and occup}' there each a 
definite position."" His two magmas — basic and acid — do not difler 
materially from those of Bunsen, and his idea of their arrangement in 
the earth's crust is practically the same as that of Von Waltershausen. 
He compared the tAvo magmas to baths of fused metals, which separate 
into distinct alloys on cooling. He does not give actual illustrations, 
but we ma}^ consider one, in order to give precision to the idea. A 
mixture of 48.6-1- per cent of bismuth and ,50.86 per cent of zinc sepa- 
rates at a temperature between TOO- and 800" C. into two alloys, which 
arrange themselves according to specific gravity. On cooling, the 
heavier is found to contain S-i.S'J per cent of bisnuith and 15.18 per 
cent of zinc; the lighter 2.47 per cent of bisnuith and l»7.o3 per cent of 
zinc. If silver be added to the mixture, there is also a separation into 
two alloys, so long as the amount of silver is less than about 40 per 
cent; when it exceeds this amount, there is no longer any separation. 

Durocher speaks of eruptions which derive their supply from the 
primary magmas as belonging to the first order, and those which draw 
their material from more or less isolated magma basins as belonging 
to the second order. The latter furnish rocks which depart from the 
normal type, and this he explains, in part at least. l)v assuming a 
process of separation analogous to that by wiiich the j)rimary magmas 
were produced. Thus he says: 

"It is therefore probable that phonoliticand trachytic porphyry are 
only the two opi)Osite products of a liquation which took place in 
the midst of the fluid mass; they are, as it were, the two inverse alloys 
into which we so often see a metallic batii divide itself,'' 



THE EVOLUTION OF PETROLOGICAL IDEAS. '^03 

The type of inag-matic differentiation conceived by Durocher may 
be ilkistrated 1)}^ a very simple experiment. Place some phenol and 
water in a Florence flask; two immiscible conjugate solutions will be 
formed — a solution of water in phenol at the bottom and a solution 
of phenol in water at the top. Now heat the mixture to 69° C, and a 
perfectly homogeneous solution will be produced. On cooling, this 
will again break up into two. Clouds are tirst formed in the cooler 
portions of the liquid, and after the coalescence of the minute drops, 
gravity is able to effect a perfect separation of the two solutions. 

Do silicate solutions behave in the same way '( Backstrom has 
recently argued that they do; but until the fact has ])een definitely 
established by experiment, there will always remain a certain element 
of doul)t. The sharj) separation of basalt and granophyre, which 
is so striking a feature of the Brito-Icelandic [)rovince, suggests 
that the two magmas represented by these rocks may separate in the 
manner just descri])ed. But the great viscosity of fused granophyre 
at atm()s})heric pressure and easil}^ accessible temperatures would 
prol)ably prevent the attainment of an}^ decisive result. 

Clarence King maintained that local lakes of fusion were formed 
hy relief of pressure, and that differentiation took place partly l)y 
liquation in Durocher's sense, and i)artly l)y the rise or fall of crystals. 

The physico-chemical speculations, which played so important a })art 
in the science of rocks during the nuddle of the century, were neglected 
for a time, in consequence of the opening- up of a new field of observa- 
tion l)y the introduction of the microscope; but of late years we have 
returned to these specidations with renewed vigor, and with a wealth 
of facts at our disposal which the earlier theorists would have envied. 

The mineralogical composition and microscopic structure of all 
kinds of igneous rocks have been determined, reliable chemical 
anal3'ses have been made, and the problem of th(^ origin of petro- 
graphical species has resolved itself into the (juestion of the evolution 
of the magmas. Especially noteworthy is the stinnilus given to the 
chemical side of petrology by the magnificent work of the Ignited 
States Geological Survey. We have now some four or five new and 
original classifications of igneous rocks largely based on the analyses 
of Clarke, Hiilel^rand. and their assistants, and the cry is, "Still thej' 
come!" But the authors of these analyses have hitherto refrained- — 
perhaps wisel}" — from attempting- any general classification of rocks 
from a chemical point of view. The number of constituents is so 
large that there is no reason, so far as I can see, why eveiy petrog- 
rapher should not have his own classification and his own method of 
graphical representation. 

The idea that petrogra])hical sju'cies ha\ e originated by diffcrtMitia- 
tion from homogeneous magmas, and possibly in the first instance 
from some one primordial magma, has been greatl}' developed during 
the last decade of the century, especially by American and Norwegian 



304 THE EVOLUTION OF PETROLOGICAL IDEAS. 

petrographers. Thus Professor Iddings, in the introduction to his 
important memoir on the Origin of Igneous Rocks, says: 

''The object of the present paper is to give the writer's reasons for 
concluding that all of the volcanic and other igneous rocks of any 
region are so intimately connected together by mineralogical and 
chemical relations that they must have originated from some single 
magma Avhose composition may be different in different regions; and, 
further, that it is the chemical differentiation of this primary magma 
which has given rise to the various kinds of igneous rocks." 

The fact that the diverse igneous rocks of certain districts are often 
bound together by common mineralogical and chemical characters 
which distinguish them from the corresponding rocks of certain other 
districts was clearly recognized by Professor Judd in his well-known 
paper on the Volcano of Chemnitz, and subsequently crystallized by 
him in the happy expression petrographical province, as applied to 
any district in which the igneous rocks have certain common charac- 
teristics. The idea has been still further extended and ela])orated T)y 
Professor Iddings, who sees in the conunon characteristics the indica- 
tions of a kind of blood relationship or consanguinity, which can onlv 
be explained on the assumption that the different species of one and 
the same province have originated by differentiation from a single 
homogeneous magma. 

Professor Brogger, in his remarkal)le series of studies on the rocks 
of the Christiania district, has still further generalized this idea, and 
much of his work is directed toward the evolution of a genealogical 
tree, in which the twigs shall correspond to the final products of dif- 
ferentiation, the larger branches to some of the plutonic masses, and 
the trunk to the primordial homogeneous inagma. The idea is a fas- 
cinating one: se non e vero, e ben trovato. But it must be admitted 
that we know very little about the causes of the assumed differentia- 
tion. These are supposed to be of two types: (1) those which affect 
the licpiid magmas, and (2) those connected with the separation of the 
minerals. Magmatic differentiation is generally regarded as the most 
important, but it is the type of which we know least. Soret's princi- 
ple, to which I have appealed, will, I fear, help us veiy little, though 
it is undoubtedly a vera causa. Mr. Harker has clearly shown that, 
as applied to a mass like the Carrock-Fell gabbro, it breaks down 
hopelessly when subjected to a quantitative test. The principle of 
Gouy and Chaperon is even more unsatisfactory. Durocher's liipia- 
tion theory is, perhaps, more promising, but until it has been proved 
by actual experiment that there is a real analogy between baths of 
fused metals and silicate-magmas, it can not be said to rest upon an 
assured basis. Faraday's researches on lead glass "certainly suggest 
that gravity may act differentially on the constituents of silicate- 
magmas, independently of the principle of Gouy and Chaperon. Thus 
he found that glass taken from the top of pots not more than 6 inches

deep might liave a density of 8. 28 while that from the bottom iniu-ht 
have a density of 8.85; hut there is some d()ul)t as to whether the 
constituents were ever nniforml\' mixed in the molten state, and if 
not, whether sufficient time was allowed for diffusion to establish 
homogeneity. It is certain, however, that they were unifonuly mixed 
in the solid state, and the experiments are therefore of great interest; 
for, if they do not prove differentiation in a molten mass they prove 
tliat a uniform solid mass may l)ecome differentiated as it liquefies by 
a kind of liquation process analogous to that which takes place in the 
extraction of silver from copper. 

Professor Iddings has carefully considered the chemical composi- 
tions of groups of rocks belonging to several different petrographical 
provinces from the point of view of the differentiation hypothesis, 
and has arrived at the conclusion that ""tlK^ simple oxide molecules 
shift about independently of one another to a great extent." If this 
conclusion be cori'ect, it is clear that the phenomena can not be 
explained by the h^^pothesis of a differentiation solel}^ connected with 
the formation of known minerals. But this view does not appear to 
be accepted l)v Professor Brogger, who l)elieves "that the process of 
differentiation must be referred to magmatic diffusion of definite 
chemical compounds to and from the cooling surface; further, that 
these diffusion phenomena in all probability stand in direct relation 
to the order of crystallization of minerals in the corresponding magma, 
and, lastly, that the order of crystallization, the nature of the dif- 
ferentiation, and the sequence of eruptions are all closely related 
phenomena.*" 

Differentiation dependent upon crystallization rests on a somewhat 
firmer basis, and it was this kind of differentiation that first attracted 
my attention. Mr. Clough, while mapping the Cheviot district, proved 
that the widespread series of andesitic lavas is cut by a numbei' of 
quartz-felsite dikes. Why did ([uartz-felsite succeed andesit(^ in the 
Cheviot district? This was the question which kept contiimally recur- 
ring to me during my examination of the rocks of the district. Now. 
a microscopic examination of the andesites pro\'ed that the })henocrysts 
taken together nuist have the composition of a basic rock, for they 
were composed of lal)radorite, augite, and hypersthene, and therefore 
the glassy l)ase present in some of the andesites nmst be allicni to 
(luartz-felsite in composition. The se([uence esta])iished by Mr. Clough 
could therefore ]>e explained l>v the assum])tion that t\\o (|iiai'tz-felsite 
magma represented the mother li([U()r of the andesitic magma, after 
tlie phenocrysts had separated out. Thus, if crystallization had ])ro- 
gressed in the phitonic mass to tiie stage repr(\sented by the ])heno- 
crysts of the la\a, or a bttle further, and the mother li(|uoi- had tluMi 
been scpieezed out as one s(|uee/es watei' out of a sponge, or s<'[)ai'ate(l 
in any other way, and I'oi-eed ui)ward into ei'acks in the o\(Mlyuig 
series of andesitic lava flows, the tiuestion above i-el'erred to could be

satisfactorih^ answered. I was fortunatel}^ able to test the theory 
quantitatively^ for Mr. Waller had already analyzed one of the quartz- 
felsites, and Dr. Petersen had published analyses of the glass v base of 
one of the andesites and of the devitriiied base of another. On com- 
paring the mean of the two analyses of the base with the analysis of the 
quartz-felsite, it was found that of the eight constituents six differed 
by less than 0.4 per cent, silica differed by 2.2, and soda by 1.46."

Differentiation dependent on crystallization is a fact which can not 
be denied; for the igneous magma, except when it cools as a gla.ss, 
separates into distinct minerals which do not, as a rule, consolidate 
simultaneously. But the acceptance of this fact does not involve the 
acceptance of the differentiation theory of the origin of petrographical 
species, for, as M. Michel Levy points out, the crystallization of a 
magma under ordinary circumstances does not commence until it has 
reached a pasty state. MM. Fouque and Levy observed no tendency to 
differentiation, of the kind required to produce petrographical species, 
in their celebrated synthetical experiments. The centers of crystalli- 
zation were uniformly distributed throughout the masses, which were 
too viscous to allow of any apprecial)le movement of the first-formed 
minerals. Nevertheless, the facts observed by Darwin and others 
clearly prove that in large masses of lava, even at the surface of the 
earth, movement of crystaL> is possible in igneous magmas, and M. 
Michel Levy himself admits that sucii movement may becomt> an 
important factor under certain circumstances. 

Mr. llarker has suggested another way in which crystallization may 
operate so as to produce variation in a mass of rock. He has shown 
that the Cari'ock Fell gabbro varies in conquxsition from the center to 
the sides, and that, as so frequently happens in eruptive masses, the 
latter are more basic than theforniei-. He considers "that the differ- 
entiation took i)lace by diffusion m a tluid magma, but not as a process 
distinct from and quite anterior to crystallization. It was, as I believe, 
effected in a quasi-saturated magma, concuirently with the crystalliza- 

'^ A.S the figures were not j)laeed side by side in tlie original i)ai>er (Cieol. Mag., 1885,

tion of the earlior-formed minerals; * * * i\^q characteristic of 
all [such occurrences] is that tlie sev(>ral constituents are concentrated 
in a detinite order, which is identical with the order in which they 
crystallize out from the mao-ma." 

All theories which depend on diffusion or molecular How liavt^ been 
criticized by Mr. Becker on the ground that the rate of ditiusion is 
too sh)w to produce the results attributed to it in any reasonal)le time. 
He shows that, in the case of a column of water resting upon a layer 
of copper sulphate, th(^ lapse of 1,000, 000 years would be recjuired to 
produce sensible discoloration at a height of 850 meters, or semisat- 
uration at a height of 84 meters; and he considers that the molecular 
How of any compound in a silicate magma w^ould probably ])e at least 
tifty times less rapid, so that a mass of lava 1 cubic kilometer in vol- 
ume ''would not have had time to segregate into distinctly dili'erent 
rocks l)y molecular flow if it had been kept melted since th(> close of 
the Archican period." 1 am by no means averse to making h(>a\ y drafts 
on the bank of time for geological purposes, but unless some elective 
answer to Mr. Becker's arguments can be found 1 think that we shall 
liave to give up unaided molecular flow as an important factor in the 
origin of petrographical species. 

Mr. Becker has not, however, simply confined himself to destructive 
criticism. He has proposed a theory of differentiation dei)endent on 
'•fractional crystallization." During the cooling of a mass of molten 
matter in a dike or laccolite, convection currents will be established. 
These will act as stirrers, and, aided by diffusion, will tend rapidly to 
restore homogeneity in the liquid mass after it has been destroyed l)y 
the deposition of the first-formed crystals on the walls of tlu^ cooling- 
surfaces. He compares a laccolite, in which the marginal parts are 
different from the center, to a barrel of cider which has l)ecn frozen 
from the outside. During the earlier stages nearly pure ice is foiined 
on the walls, while the alcohol is concentrated in the central portion; 
from this a licjuor, gradually increasing in strength, may be drawn off 
as consolidation progresses. Here we see a furtlier dc\-eiopnient of 
the idea originated ))y Darwin. 

Ail forms of the dilfei-cntiation theory Uiko as Ihcir starling point a 
homogeneous magma, and then proceed to deri\'e from it the dillci'ent 
varieties of igneous rocks as we now see them l)y magmatic or some 
other form of differentiation. Are we justified in taking this view '^ 
As ap})licd to certain districts, and (\specially to the ('hi'istiania dis- 
trict which Professoi' I^i'cigger has done so nuich to (^lucidat(\ it has 
j)roved of great value. But if we look at the general ([uestion, there 
are many facts which should gi\<> us })ause. The earth's crust is cer- 
tainly heterogeneous, and if magmas are, in any case, formed by the 
refusion of solid'rocks,- it is probable, as Mr. Beck(M- has })ointed out, 
that such magmas would be hetci'ogeneous at t\w start. K\'cn the 



308 THE EVOLUTION OF PETROLOGICAL IDEAS. 

refusion of homogeneous rocks niuy give rise to ;i heterogeneous 
inagniii, comparable to that produced by Faraday in his experiments 
on glass. The cause of some of the variations^ in igneous rocks is 
therefore probably to be sought for in actions which antedate the 
formatioi\ of the magmas. But even homogeneous magmas may 
become moditied b}^ the al)soi'ption or assimilation of the rocks 
through which the}' pass. This point has been clearly established and 
especially emphasized by M. Michel Levy, Professor Barrois, and 
Professor Lacroix in France, and by Dr. Johnston Lavis, Professor 
Sollas, Professor Cole, and Mr. Harker in this country. 

That it is a vera causa is admitted on all hands, but ditierences of 
opinion exist as to the extent to which it should be applied in explain- 
ing the origin of petrographical species. 

If we stud}'^ igneous rocks which have appeared at the surface as 
lavas, or have been intruded at moderate depths as dykes, sills, 
laccolites, or bosses, the evidence of absorption is, in m}' judgment, 
so slight as to be practicall}' negligible; but if we pass from such 
regions to others in which plutonic rocks are found in relation with 
crystalline schists and study 'Mes appareils granitiques a racines 
prof ondes " of M. Michel Levy, the case is different. It may be that 
the final solution of the problem of the origin of igneous magmas will 
be found in these regions; but here we touch a question which belongs 
to the future rather than to the past, and lies, therefore, beyond the 
scope of this address. So far as I am concerned, I will confess that 
my ideas are not tixed. At present I am not disposed to attach much 
importance to theories involving differentiation in situ by unaided 
molecular flow in dikes and laccolites; but rather to attri))ute such 
variation as does occur to successive eruptions, or to a continuous 
change in the nature of the material during the process of intrusion. 
The great difficulty in applying any theory that involves ditt"er(Mitia- 
tion in situ to such cases arises from the slight effect of the igneous 
magmas on the containing walls — a fact which negatives the idea that 
the material arrived at the place where we now hnd it in a condition 
of superfusion, or that it remained fluid long enough to enal)le any 
considerable difl'usion to take place. 

Qui- ideas as to the origin of igneous rocks are still "en pleine 
evolution," Conditions are rapidly changing in consequence of dis- 
coveries in geology and physical chemistry. Rival theories are strug- 
gling for existence, and although it is safe to predict that some will 
become extinct, that others will be modifled, and that natural selection 
will finally bring about the survival of the fittest, it is impossi))le to 
determine at ])rcsent tli(^ r(^lativ(> inij)ortanc(> of those wliicli claim 
oui" attention. 

The origin of ])etrographical species, so far as the igneous rocks 
are concerned, is a problem the final solution of which has been 
handed on by the nineteenth century to its successor. 



rKELIMlNARY REPOirr ON THE RECENT ERUPTION OF 
THE 80UFRIERE IN ST. VINCENT, AND OF A VISIT TO 
MONT PELEE. IN MARTINIQUE. " 



P>v Tempest Anderson, M. I)., B. St-., F. C. S., ami -Iuiin S, Flett, 
M. A., I). Sc, F. G. S.^' 



[Dr. Tempest Anderson and Dr. John S. Flett, who reeeiv^ed a eom- 
niission from the Royal Society to investigate the recent volcanic 
eruptions in the West Indies, more especially in St. Vincent, submit 
the following preliminary report:] 

Wo arrived at Bar])ados on June 8 (having- left London on May 28), 
and thence proceeded to St. Vincent, where nearly- four weeks were 
spent, mostly at Chateaubelair and Georgetown, in the vicinity of the 
Soufriere. On June 29 Dr. Tempest Anderson went to Grenada to 
examine the lagoon at St. George's, returning some days latei'. Dr. 
Flett remaining at St. Vincent to complete his investigations. 

On July 6 we arrived at Martinique, and on the 12th left that island 
for Dominica, where we remained until July IT, when wo returned to 
Barbados. In all six weeks were spent in the West Indies. 

In the Windward Islands, in the month of fluly — the middle of the 
rainy season — the work of a geological expedition is necessarily attended 
with many difficulties, hut these were greatly mitigated by the kind- 
ness rendered by all with whom we came in contact. To Sir Rol)ert 
Llewelyn, K. C. M. G., the governor of the Windwai'd Islands, and to 
the administrators of St. Vincent, St. Lucia, and Dominica, and other 
officials connected with the colonial office, we are especially indel)ted 
for information, advice, and assistance. Di'. Morris, C. M. G., of the 
im})erial department of agriculture for the West Indies, and the 
members of this department in the \arious islands received us Avith the 
greatest kindness and gav<» us invaluable help throughout. The many 
planters and overseers of estates, medical men, and merchants to whom 
we made application for information or for assistance received us with 
that courtesy and hospitality which are characteristic of the colony, and

did everything in their power to forward our work in every way. In 
Martinique the governor of the island gave us every facilit}^ for con- 
ducting our scientific investigations. In this brief preliminary report 
it is impossible for us to mention by name even a small proportion of 
those who, often at considerable inconvenience to themselves, lightened 
our labors by their kind provision and forethought. In every place 
we visited we found friends who Avere willing to direct, assist, and 
accompany us; and without their help it would often have lieen impos- 
sible for us to make satisfactory arrangements or to accomplish our 
work. In this way what might have been a very arduous undertaking 
was greatly lightened, and we wish to place on record our deep 
indebtedness to our many kind friends in the Windward and Leeward 
islands. 

The island of 8t. Vincent is of oval form, 18 miles ]\y 11 miles, the 
longer diameter being nearly north and south. A mountain chain 
stretches along the main axis of the island and reaches to a height of 
2,000 to 1,000 feet, the highest point being just over 1,000. It is 
entirely composed of volcanic materials, the beds of lava and tutf dip- 
ping away in all directions from the central mass toward the sea. In 
the southern part of the islantl volcanic action has long l)een extinct 
or dormant, l)ut at the northern end stands the still active Souf riere, 
a striking volcanic cone 1,018 feet in height, with a crater nearly cir- 
cular in form and about 1 mile in diameter. Along the leeward side 
of the island very fine sections are exposed, and these show it to con- 
sist of volcanic rocks, of which by far the commonest is a coarse ande- 
sitic agglomerate or tuft', though there are many lava streams which 
may be traced as vertical cliffs along the valley sides, alternating \\ ith 
the gentler slopes due to the thick beds of ash. The scenery is bold 
and picturesque, the heav}' tropical rains acting on steep slopes having 
effected rapid and intense erosion. As a consequence, deep valle3^s 
radiate out from the central ridge, separated })y high, narrow spurs 
running down to the sea. On the windward side, below the level of 
700 feet above the sea, there are considerable stretches of flat or gentl}^ 
sloping ground on which stand many of the most important arrowroot 
and sugar estates. The first glance at these lower grounds suffices to 
show that they are very distinct in configuration from the highly eroded 
and deeply sculptured uplands, and further investigation reveals the 
presence of more or less well-marked l)eaches or terraces — a system of 
old sea beaches or rock platforms partly obliterated ])ysubaerial ero- 
sions and in some places covered with debris. On both sides the sub- 
marine slopes are steep, but most so on the leevvai'd coast, as on the 
east or windward side there is a considerable expanse of shallow water 
in which a sul)merged terrace at a depth of 150 feet can be traced b}' 
means of soundings, as indicated on the charts. There are no raised 
coral beaches here, as in some of the other islands, and the latest move- 
ments of the land have probably been in a downward direction. 



ERUPTIOK OF THE SOUb'RIERE IN ST. VINCENT. 811 

The Soufrieve Mountain forms the northern extreniity of the 
ishind, and its g-eneral form at once suggests a comparison with Vesu- 
vius. It is a simple cone witiiout hiteral or })arasitic craters. The 
one at its summit is surrounded on the north side by the remains of 
a gigantic crater ling. which has tiie same rehition to the present 
crater as Somma has to Vesuvius. On the northeast lip of the main 
crater there is a smaller one known as the New^ Cratei', as it is ))elieved 
to have originated in the eruption of 1812. It is only one-third of a 
mile in diameter. It is dou))tful whether the New Crater was active 
duilng the late eruption, and there can ))e no doubt that it w^as from 
the principal or ''Old Ch-ater,"" that the materials mostly were emitted. 
Deep valleys, often with })recipitous sides, have been cut in the slopes 
of the mountain, especially on its southern side, and it is in tlu'se — 
and particularly in the Wallibu, Rozeau, and Ka])aca Dry River that 
the greater part of the ejecta of the recent eruption have collected. 

The eruption of May, 19o2, though sudden in its outburst and dis- 
astrous in its effects, was far from imexpected. In the north of St. 
Vincent there were two settlements of the a))original Caril)s, and 
these had been so startled by the frequent violent earthquakes, that 
in February of last year they were considei'ing- the adxisalnlity of 
deserting the district. But the first signs of actual \olcanic activity 
were on Tuesday, ]\Iay 6. The inhabitants of the leeward side were 
fortunate in having a clear view of the crater, and, warned Ijy the 
outbursts of steam, they fled to Chateaubelair and other places along 
the coast line to the south, so that few lives were lost in this quarter. 
But, on the windward side, the summit of the mountain, as is fre- 
([uently the case, was wrapped in cloud. Here, at the base of the 
mountain, there is an extensive stretch of flat land, known as the 
Carib countrv, on wdiich were situated some of the largest and richest 
estates in the island, with a dense population mostly black or colored. 
8o little alarm was felt here that even on the morning of Wednesday, 
May 7, when the leeward side was practically deserted, sugar making 
was in progress on several estates, and all the operations of tropical 
agriculture were being conducted as usual. From Kingstown tele- 
phonic messages were sent to Georgetown, which is not far from the 
base of the hill, stating that the Soufriere was in eruption, but they 
appear to have occasioned little anxiet3\ And when, about midday 
on Wednesday, the danger was too obvious to be overlooked, the 
Rabaca Dry River, and some of the streams on the windward side, 
usually dry except after rains, were running boiling hot, and could 
not be crossed. Many fugitives in this way found their escape cut ofl'. 
It was here that the loss of life was greatest, which, though many 
escaped, is estimated to have amounted to 2,000, including about a 
dozen white men — the overseers of the plantations. The exact luun- 
ber will never be known, as many Avere entombed in the ashes where 
they fell. 



812 EUUPTION OF THE SOUFRIERE IN ST. VINCENT, 

About midda}" on Tuesday the tirst signs of the eruption were 
observed by those dwelling on the southwestern side of the mountain. 
At 2.40 that afternoon there was a considerable explosion, and a large 
cloud of steam ascended into the air. By 5 o'clock a red glare was 
visil>le in the steam cloud on the summit. Activity continued during 
the evening, and at midnight there was a great outburst and red 
flames were noticed on the lip of the crater. Next morning from 
Chateaubelair a splendid view could be obtained of gigantic nuishroom- 
shaped clouds rising to a great height in the air — estimated at 30,000 
feet — and drifting away before the northeast trade wind. As the da}" 
advanced the eruption increased in violence; hy 10.30 a. m. enormous 
clouds of vapor were being emitted with loud noises, accompanied by 
much lightning. It is remarkable that at that time the inhabitants of 
the windward side were still in doubt about the reality of the erup- 
tion, since they mistook the dark cloud covering the mountain for a 
thunder cloud. The mountain was now in a state of continuous 
activit}", and from Chateaubelair it could be seen that the materials 
were mostly discharged from the old or principal crater. Vast clouds 
of steam, showers of dark matter (probably mud), and of stones, could 
be seen projected from it, partly on the leeward, but mostl}^ on the 
windward side. At midda}^ the slopes of the mountain were still green 
and the rich mantle of tropical vegetation had not yet been destroj^ed. 
A thin layer of fine ash had fallen over the lower ground, only sufii- 
cient to give the leaves a grayish color. The enormous columns of 
vapor continued to ascend from the crater, with frecjuent violent out- 
bursts, projecting showers of stones and mud. 

About this time it was noticed that steam was rising from some of 
the valleys on the south side of the hill, and this increased till at 12.50 
the whole mountain was suddenlj^ enveloped in a dense cloud of vapor. 
Just Ix^fore this the rivers Wallibu and Kal)aca had been seen rushing 
down in raging floods of boiling water. It is most probable that these 
phenomena were due to the escape of the crater lake, which was driven 
over the lower or south lip of the crater between 12 o'clock and 1 
o'clock on the Wednesda}^ afternoon, and poured down the valleys to 
the sea. So far as we know there were no mud la^'as, in the ordinar}^ 
sense, flowing down these valle3's, but only a tremendous rush of l)oil- 
ing water, which left no traces which wo could recognize when we 
visited the district. 

B}' 1 o'clock the roaring of the volcano was tremendous. Showers 
of stones were being projected both to windward and to leeward. The 
enormous colunms of steam continued to ascend from the crater. The 
lightnings were terrific, and after the large outl)ursts which took place 
eveiy few minutes volumes of vapor might be seen covering the 
whole area. Hitherto the eruption had been of a type with which 
geologists are familiar, and the destruction done was confined to the 
higher parts of the mountain in the close vicinity of the crater. 



ERUPTION OF THE SOUFRIERE IN ST. VINCENT. 313 

But about '2 o'clock — to ([uoto the words of an cycw itiicss (Mr. T. 
M. McDonald, of Richmond \'ale Estate)— ''tlicr<' was a ruinhlinoand 
a large black outburst with showers of stones, all to windward, and 
enormously increased activity over the whole an^a. A territic, huge 
reddish and purplish curtain advanced to and over Richmoiul Estate." 
This was the strange black cloud which, laden with hot dust, swept 
with territic velocity down the mountain side, burying the country in 
iiot sand, suffocating and burning all living creatures in its path, and 
devouring the rich vegetation of the hill with one burning l)iast. 

On the leeward coast few w^ere overtaken by th(> black cloud, as the 
inha])itants had tied and taken refuge in the villages south of Chateau- 
l)elair. Those who were caught were killed or badly l)urned. One 
boat was near Richmond at the time the blast swe})t down. They 
descri])e the heat as fearful. Hot sand rained into the ]»oat and the 
sea around was hissing with its heat. The darkness was so complete 
that a man could not see his hand. They saved their lives ])y diving 
into the water: Avhen they retui'ned to the surface the air was suffo- 
cating, 1mt they contimied to dive again and again, and, when at their 
last gasp, tiiey found that the air cleared and they could breathe 
again. This occupied only a few minutes-— probably nuich less in 
reality than it appeared to them. One man was too exhausted to con- 
tinue diving; he clung to the gunwale of the ])oat, and the tops of his 
ears were severely scorched. 

It may be worth while to quote the descriptions of a few^ spectators 
who saw^ this cloud from a safe distance. Dr. Christian Branch, of 
Kingstown, writes: 

'" We saw a solid black wall of smoke falling into the sea about 2 
or 3 miles from us. It looked like a promontory of solid land, but 
it rolled and tuml)led and spread itself out until in .i little time it 
extended quite 8 miles over the sea to the west. * * * Then 
began the most gorgeous display of lightning one could conceive. 
* * * It was still bright daylight, but the whole atmosphere 
quivered and thundered with wavy lines intersecting one another like 
trelliswork. We wei'e encircled in a ring of tiery bayonets." 

Another eyewitness (the Rev. Mr. Darrell. of Kingstown), who 
was in the same l)oat with Dr. Branch, describ(\s it as follows: 

'"•AVe were rapidly proceeding to our point of observation when w'e 
saw an inuuense cloud — dark, dense, and apparently thick with vol-

and warning us to proceed no farther. This gigantic l)aid< of sul- 
phurous vapor and smoke assumed at one time tlu; shape of a gigaiitic 
promontory, then as a collection of twisting, revolving cloud whirls, 
turning with rapid velocity — now assuming the shape of gigantic 
cauliflowers, then efflorescing into beautiful llower shapes, some dark,

illumined b}- electric flashes." 



314 ERUPTION OF THE SOUFRIERE IN ST. VINCENT. 

On the windward side of the island an uninterrupted view of the 
progress of the eruption could not be obtained, owing- to the veil of 
cloud which obscured the summit. By midda}- on Wednesday even 
the most skeptical were convinced that the Soufriere was in eruption, 
and that the noises heard continuously were not due to a thunder- 
storm. Before midday there had been very heavy rain showers, and 
it was noticed that the raindrops carried down line particles of ash. 
Work ceased on. the plantations, and those laborers who still remained 
endeavored to escape to Georgetown or shut themselves up in their 
houses. Bv 2 o'clock fine ashes, with occasional larger stones, were 
falling steadily, but, as yet, little damage had been done, and no one 
had been injured. Then came the climax of the eruption, and those 
who were in the open air saw a dense black cloud rolling with terrific 
velocity down the mountain. They took refuge in their houses and 
in the plantation works, where they crowded together in such num- 
bers that in one small room 87 were killed. The cloud was seen to 
roll down upon the sea, and was described to us as flashing with light- 
ning, especiall}^ when it touched the water. All state that it was 
intensely hot, smelt strongly of sulphur, and was sufl'ocating. They 
felt as if something was compressing their throats, and as if there 
was no air to breathe. There was no fire in the ordinary sense of 
the word, only the air was itself intensely hot and was charged with 
hot dust. The sufl'ocating cloud only lasted a few minutes. Those 
who survived this ordeal mostly escaped, though man}^ died within a 
few hours from shock, or from the severit}^ of their injuries. In 
some cases a few survived, entirely or almost entirely uninjured, 
in a room in which many others died. Most of those who escaped 
had shut themselves up in the rum cellars or in substantialh" built 
houses, and had firmly closed all doors and windows. By the time 
the hot blast had reached the coast the sand it contained was no longer 
incandescent, and though still at a very high temperature it did not 
set fire to wood or burn the clothes of those exposed to it. The burns 
on the survivors were chiefly on the outer aspect of the arms and legs, 
and on the faces, and confined to parts not protected l)v their clothes. 

Complete darkness now covered the whole north end of St. Vin- 
cent — a darkness moi'e intense than an}- that the iidial)itants had ever 
before experienced. The fugitives had to creep along the roads or 
feel their way along the roadsides. The roaring of the mountain was 
terrible — a long, drawn out, continuous sound resembling the roar of 
a gigantic animal in great pain. Fine ash and sand rained down over 
the whoU^. country, with occasional showers of large stones. Some of 
these were so hot as to set fire to the "trash" roofs of huts in the 
south end of Georgetown, at a distance of T miles from the crater. In 
Kingstown, 12 niiles from the Soufriere, the ash was at first moist, 
but afterwards dry. It had a strong sulphurous smell, and pattered 



ERUPTION OF THE SOUFRIERE IN ST. VINCENT. 815 

on the roofs liko a h('a\ v shower of tropic;il rain. Around the volcano 
the earth shook and trembled continuously, and the motion was 
described to us as undulatino- rather than resemblino- the sharp shock 
of an earthquake. Only in one or two cases were the walls of houses 
injured. What was taking place on the sunmiit of the mountain no 
one can tell, but all who passed that night in the vicinity of the Sou- 
friere agree tlr.it then* was one l)lack sutl'ocating cloud, and onlv one. 
In all probabilitv the eruption had reassumed the ordinary phase, and 
the showers of ash and stones were produced l)v violent u})ward explo- 
sions of steam. By half past 5 o'clock the ash was falling in Barlxi- 
dos, 100 miles to the eastward, whither it had been carried by the 
upper currents of air in a direction opposite to that of the trade winds. 
In St. Vincent the darkness lessened slightly before nightfall, but the 
rain of dust and the noises lasted till early in tlu^ ensuing morning, 

When day l>roke it was seen that in St. Vincent, and even in Bar])a- 
dos, everything was covered with tine gra}' ash, resembling a fall of 
snow. The dust had penetrated into the interior of the houses, where 
it lay in a thin tilm on walls and furniture. In Kingstown tliere were 
stones as large as a hen's egg; in Georgetown and Chateaubelair some 
had fallen as nuich as 1 foot in diameter. Little damage, however, 
ai)pears to have been done to growing crops, except in the north end 
of the island. In fact, many believe that the sulphurous ash had 
insecticidal properties, and benetited the vegetation. From Chateau- 
l)elair it could be seen that the volcano was still emitting putt's of slat}^- 
coloi'ed steam, and show^ers of tine dust were falling on the leeward 
side of the mountain. For several days these discharges of vapors 
continued, Init a new phenomenon now attracted more attention. 
The ra\ ines which furrow the south side of the mountain were found 
to be discharging clouds of vapor, and this gave rise to reports of 
tissures having opened on the ttanks of the Soufriere, of subsidiary 
eruptions arising from these ttssures, and of streams of lava flowing- 
down the valleys. As a matter of fact, they were really due to the 
action of water flowing through the hot sand, which in some places 
had almost ot)literated the old stream courses, as will ))e explained 
more fully later on. By the J 5th the volcanic activity had apparently 
subsided, and the mountain reujained clear and uncloud(Hl. The 
explosions of steam in the \alleys continued, and are prol)ably still 
going on. 

The state of quiescence continued till Sunday, May 18. Confldence 
was being restored, and the inhabitants of those districts near the 
mountain which had not sufl'ered severely were returning to their 
homes. On the windward side the work of burying- the l)0(lies had 
been completed and things were resuming their normal course. But 
about S o'clock that evening an ominous sound was heard from the 
crater. Its nature was at once recognized and struck the l)Iack popu- 



316 ERUPTIUN OF THE SOUFRIERE IN ST. VINCENT. 

lation with terror. The noises were as loud as those of the tirst erup- 
tion, iind th(> lightning was ver}^ vivid. On the leeward side complete 
darkness prevailed, and ashes and sand fell freely for some hours. In 
Georgetown the fall of ashes was (piite inconsiderable, not exceeding 
a thin film on the roofs of the houses. Gradually the noises lessened, 
the darkness lifted, and the moon appeared again. No lives were lost 
and practically no damage was done, but exactly what happened on 
those parts of the mountain nearest the crater it is, under the circum- 
stances, impossible to say. This second eruption was the last which 
proceeded from the main crater. Clouds of steam were sometimes 
seen gently rising for some days later, but nothing of the nature of a 
volcanic outl)urst has since taken place. 

We arrived at Kingstown on Tuesday, June 10, and proceeded at 
once to Chateaubelair, where Mr. James E. Richards, of Kingstown, 
kindly placed a house at our disposal. The geological products of this 
eruption proved to be of very simple charactei*. The Soufriere and 
the surrounding country were covered with a layer of ashes mostly in 
the form of tine, dark-colored sand, but mixed with spongy bombs of 
various sizes, and many ejected blocks composed of fragments of the 
old rocks of the hill. Lapilli and scoria are there in plenty, as is 
obvious where the heavy rains have washed away the finer material, 
but the greater part of the ejecta consists of fine sand, which when dry 
and hot is yellowish gray in color, but when wet becomes almost 
black. This sand, as has already })een noted by many observers, con- 
tains plagioclase feldspar, hypersthene, augite, magnetite, and frag- 
ments of glass, and represents a fairly well cr3^stalized hj^persthene- 
andesite magna which has been l)lo\vn to powder by the expansion of 
occluded steam. 

The coarser material is mostly a slaggy andesite with crystals of 
plagioclase and pyroxene. There is little pumice, though we obtained 
a few fragments which floated on water and contained but few crystals 
visible to the naked eye. The larger bombs are often black, highly 
lustrous, and glassy when broken across. Some were seen at Wallibu 
(1 miles from the crater) 3 feet in diameter. The ejected blocks con- 
sist of weathered andesites and andesitic tuflFs such as can be seen in 
the walls of the crater. They are ver}' numerous, and some are over 
5 feet across. In addition to these, fine-grained, dark-green banded 
rocks occur, which appear to be baked and indurated sediments, prob- 
ably the nmd from the bottom of the crater lake or the finer beds 
intercalated in the older volcanic series. Another tyi)e of ejected 
block which is very common in some parts of the hill is a coarse- 
grained aggregate of feldspar, hornblende ())rown under the micro- 
scope), and perhaps olivine. It is not vesicular and contains little or 
no glass, being apparently holocrystalline. These rocks are very fria- 
ble, and the crystals are loosely aggregated together. Tlie}^ seemed 



EKUPTION OF THK SOUFKIERE TN ST. VINCENT. 817 

to US to be coiupiiraMc to the siinidinites of tlic Kit'cl iiiid many other 
modern volcaiuc districts. Tbev are eertaiidy (luitc uidike true plu- 
tonic diorites, lioth in th(Mr structure and in tln^ character of their 
minerals. 

It ma}'^ l)e noted that none of these rocks are characteristic of this 
eruption, but all ckii be found among" the older materials of the hill. 
The hardened, baked sediments were well known to the C'aribs, who 
have long used them for the manufacture of their Hner stone imple- 
ments. The feldspar-horid)lende blocks were found by us among the 
older rocks, and in some [)laces even as rounded masses enveloped in 
the old lavas. Some of th(^ fresher bond)s in the river beds and on 
the seashore can hardly l)e distinguished from those which were the 
product of this eruption, though undoubtedly of much old(>r date. 

At Kingstown, as in Barbados, the deposit t)f xolcanic dust and sajid 
was so slight that, owing to the heavy tropical rains and the rapid 
growth of tropical vegi^tation, it readily disai)peared, and when we 
arrived it was necessary to make careful seai'ch to find traces of it. 
In St. Vincent, to the south of Chateaid^elair, on the leeward side, and 
from ^ miles south of (leorgetown, on the windward side, the country 
had very much its normal appearance. To the north of these points, 
however, a sheet of volcanic ejecta covered the ground. Where it 
was thin it was rapidly disappearing. Every shower washed nuich of 
the liner matter into the streams, which were flowing full of sand and 
lapilli to the sea. In the fields the arrowroot was pushing up through 
the layer of ash and covering it with a mantle of green leaves. 
Around Georgetown the deposit is from 1 to ;> feet deep, and some of 
the blocks are a foot in diameter. On some of the sugar-cane flelds 
in the Carib country the ash lies -t feet deep, while on the higher 
slopes of the hill it is fi'oni ."> feet to over 1^ feet (where it has gath- 
ered in the hollows). On the leeward side the ash is very deep in the 
valleys of the Wallibu and Kozeau Dry rivers, but north of Larikai it 
is much thinner — not above a foot or two. Phe north side of the 
mountain has, for reasons to be subsequ(Mitly discussed, received 
conn)aratively little of the deposit, and at Point Espagnol, Owia, 
Fancy, and (^uashie Point, along the north shore, the clifl's and the 
country' for sonu^ short distance behind them are perfectly green and 
flourishing. 

On the south side of the Soufriere a deep and broad valley has been 
eroded in the soft volcani(; ash and ag-glomerate of which this part of 
the hill consists. It runs almost across the island, betweiMi the Morne 
Garu Mountain and the Soufrier(\ and it is this \allcy which has 
received the gicater part of the (\)ecta of this erii])tion. The streams 
which flow into it the Wallibu River on the west and (he IJabaca Di'v 
River on th(^ east have had tluMr courses Hlled with line, hot sand 
mixed with coarse bond)s and ejected blocks. We were told that on 



818 ERUPTION OF THE SOUFRIERE IN ST. VINCENT. 

the west side the i-avine of the Rabaoa Dry River had been about 200 
feet deep. It is now almost entirely filled up, and the river is slowly 
cutting its way throug-h the hot sand which occupies it. The same 
thing- is happening in the Wallibu Valle}', but here erosion is more 
advanced, and cliffs of gray, hot ash, some 80 feet high, overlook the 
stream at a point about a mile above its mouth. On the flatter ground 
between the river gorges which trench these broad valley bottoms the 
deposit is very much thinner, perhaps 3 to 5 feet on the windward side, 
but often 12 feet, and sometimes 30 or 1:0 feet on the leeward side. 

The distribution and thickness of the recent ashes is not at all such 
as would have been expected had these materials merely rained down 
from above. Wherever there is a hollow it has been filled up, however 
deep. For some days after the eruption the stream valleys were level 
with their lianks. On the flat ground the deposit is much thinner, and 
on the ridges and spurs which stand up prominently there was com- 
paratively little accunudation. To the mind of a geologist examining 
these valley s one comparison was irresistibly suggested — they resembled 
nothing so much as a rugged country covered with ])lown snow. The 
ash had drifted into and filled up the depressions, while comparatively 
little had rested on the ridges between. It is conceivable that mud 
lavas flowed down at an early period in the eruption, and occupied the 
lower parts of the gorges; but we saw no evidence of this, and as 
wherever the deeper layers of the ash are exposed they are still burn- 
ing hot, it is obvious that they could never have reached their present 
position in the condition of a mud lava. AVhen we saw this country 
its surface had been deeply scored by the rains, but those who visited 
it shortly after the first eruption described it as having a smooth, 
gently rolling surface like that of blown sand. 'This is well shown in 
photographs taken by Mr. Wilson, of Kingstown, on Ma}' 11. The 
conclusion was forced upon our minds that innnensc quantities of hot 
sand had rushed down the hill into these valleys in an avalanche wliich 
carried with it a terrific blast and piled the ashes deep in the sheltered 
ravines, at the same time sweeping everything ofl' the exposed ridges 
which lay between. The rain of volcanic material, which lasted for 
hours after the hot blast had passed, then covered the surface of the 
country with a final sheeting of fine dust and scoria. 

When we ascended the Soufriere, the evidence of the passage of a 
hot blast laden with sand was overwhelmingly clear. The various 
stages of its action, and its varying intensity at different spots, are 
most easily observed on the windward side, where the country is more 
flat and open and there are fewer ravines and spurs to modify the 
course of its operations than in the Walli])u Valley. 

The track to the summit passes across the llabaca Dry Valley near 
the shore, then turns upward through the sugar-cane fields of Rabaca 
and Lot 11. These were covered with 3 or 4: feet of sand and scoria. 



ERUFTION OF THE SOUFEIERE IN ST. VINCENT. 319 

the trees all bare, their leaves stripped b}- the falling- cinders; Imt few 
branches were broken, and no tpees had been uprooted or cast down. 
The woodwork of the houses was unburnt, thoug^h the roofs of some 
of the verandas and of the laborers' huts had collapsed from, the 
weight of ashes that had fallen on them. Many people were killed on 
these estates. The survivors described to us how" the dark cloud had 
rolled down from the mountain, and how hot and suiiocatino- the air 
had been when it enveloped them. But it was evident that the veloc- 
ity of the blast was not above that of an ordinary gale, and the dust it 
carried, though hot, was not incandescent. 

At Lot 14 it was seen that many trees had their limbs twisted ofl' 
and broken, and some of the negroes' houses had taken fire (probably 
mostly from hot falling bombs). The blast was more violent here, 
but not hot enough to set tire to the woodwork or char the givoii wood 
of the standing timber. 

On the Hat ground above the plantation l)uiklings (at an (devation 
of a])out 1,000 feet) a further stage of devastation was encountered. 
The tields were here swept bare, the trees broken down, though not as 
a rule uprooted, and their smaller branches swept away; a deep layer 
of bhick sand covered the crops of sugar cane. The ])last Avas here a 
violent gale. 

A little farther up the etiects of the blast were remarkable. Enor- 
mous trees had been uprooted and cast down. Their leaves and tiner 
))ranches, of course, had disappeared. In every case the fallen trunks 
pointed directly away f i-om the crater. Even the great cotton trees, 
10 feet or more in diameter, were broken otf or uprooted. The smaller 
trees had in a few cases been swept away like straws. The larger 
were merely cast down, and lay side b}' side, their tops dii'ccted down 
the valley, their roots toward the summit of the mountain. Most 
were charred, some deeply, ])ut, as the wood was green, ou\y the 
smaller branches had been consumed. The eti'ect was like that pro- 
duced by a violent hurricane, only more complete, for many of these 
trees had withstood the hurricane which ruined St. Vincent in 1898. 
At the lower limit of this region some curious effects of the hot sand 
blast could be seen. Where any branches or trunks were still stand- 
ing they invariably showed themselves to be burnt and eroded on one 
side — that next the crater — the wood having been charred and the 
charred material removed by the action of a hot sand l)last. On the 
side away from the crater the original bark was still left unburnt, 
but dry and peeling off; that is, there had been no erosion on the 
sheltered or lee side of th(^ stems. The wood was too green to take 
tire, but the sand had been sufficiently hot to char the surfaces which 
were exposed to it. 

Farther up the hill — that is to say, above the 1,500 feet level — there 
was little left of the rich ti-opical vegetation which had covered it 



320 EKUPTION OF THE SOUFKIERE IN ST. VINCENT 

from fsunuiiit to base. Blackened remains of tree trunks were to be 
seen, overturned or broken off near the ground and Imried in dark 
sand. The highest parts of the mountain are as bare and desolate a 
scene as could be imagined. The ash is 5 to 12 feet deep, and though 
full of large Idocks and spongy bombs, is mostlj" so fine that when 
thoroughly wet it l)ecomes a mud, very tenacious and slippery, in 
which one sinks to the knee. In it there is a good deal of burnt 
timber, utterly blackened and converted into charcoal. Everything 
has been mown down, and at the same time the intense heat has con- 
sumed all the smaller fragments and charred the larger. There is 
nothing to show what was the velocity of the blast when it left the 
crater. After a couple of miles it was that of a hurricane or tornado. 
The limits ])etween the zone of uprooted trees and that of trees still 
standing, but broken and much damaged, is surprisingly sharp. At 
4 miles from the crater the blast was traveling at 20 to 40 miles an 
hou]", and rapidly slowing down. This agrees with the evidence of 
an eyewitn(\ss who saw it when it reached the sea near Chateaubelair. 
It came over the water with a wave before it, but it did not overturn 
the small boats which la}^ in its course. 

Another peculiar feature of this blast is the manner in wliich its 
course was modified l)y irregularities in the configuration of the 
ground over which it passed. To the north of the crater stands the 
encircling crater wall already referred to as the Somma. There can 
be no dou])t that a black cloud descended over this side of the 
mountain, though here the devastation is comparatively slight, and it 
is inferred that the high intervening ridge overlooking the crater 
served as a ram})art and helpiMl to protect the country behind it from 
the effects of tlie blast. The southern lip of the crater, on the other 
hand, is the lower, and the avalanche of hot sand seems to have 
poured over this lip almost like a fluid. Down the deep open valley 
between the Soufriere and the Morne (xaru Mountain it rushed, ever 
following the steepest descent. It clung to the valh^y bottoms and 
coursed along them in a manner which somewhat recalls a raging 
torrent in a ri\er. The streams in these valleys, after descending the 
first part of the hill, tui"n sharply at a right angle toward the coast, 
deflected i)v the opposing mass of the Morne Garu. The hot l)last 
mostly followed these valleys, and in them it piled up enormous 
deposits of sand, but part of it swe})t u]) the shoulders of Morne 
Garu and tore up the heav}' timl)er which was growing there. The 
dii'ection in which the fallen trunks point shows that tlie l)last was 
split into two parts — one taking the east and one tUv west side of the 
mountain rushing upwaixl o])li(pudy from below. The mountain 
pi'otectfed the country behind, and the line of demarcation between the 
burnt and the green forest almost corres])on(ls with tlu» di\i(ling ridge. 
The south side is green; the north side toward the Soufriere is 
devastated and burnt. 



ERUPTION OF THE SOUFRIERE IN ST. VINCENT. 321 

The etfec't of even comparatively small rido-es in detleetin<i' the }>last 
and pi'otectino- the country ))ehind them is still moi'c noticeable near 
Chateaubelair. Between the rivers Wallibu and Richmond there i.s a 
high diA'iding- ridg-e. The northern valley (the Wallihu) is tilled with 
ash and utterl}* burnt up, that to the south (Richmond Valley) is in 
large part green. One side of the dividing ridge is blasted; on the 
other the arrowroot is again putting out its green leaves. Another 
ridge separates Richmond Valley from Chateaubelaii'. This ridge has 
been in many places scorched, but the country ])ehind it has been per- 
fectly protected, and, though co^'ered with the rain of ash, has resumed 
its normal ap[)earance. There can l)e little doubt these ridges served 
to direct the path and intercept the vioknce of the hot blast. 

For some days after the eruption no rain fell, and the first to visit 
the district were able to observe the eflt'ects of the eruption unmoditied 
by the erosive action of ruiming water. But on May 25 5:f inches of 
rain fell. On the previous day the rainfall had l)een 2^ inches, and 
the rainy season now set in in earnest. The effect of these deluges 
acting on loose material lying on steep slopes was phenomenal, and by 
the time we reached the island the surface of the sheets of ash had 
been sculptui'ed into innumerable furrows and runnels. They cut 
down through the incoherent sand to the layer of burnt vegetation on 
the old soil beneath, or even into this, forming new channels, which 
varied from a few inches to many feet in depth. To one fresh from a 
temperate climate and unaccustomed to the power of tropical rains the 
rapidity of denudation under these conditions was astounding. On 
the upper part of the Soufriere beautiful feather patterns of rain rills 
converging toward a central main axis everywhere characterized the 
surface. The knife edges between the valleys were the only parts 
retaining the original smooth surface, and they formed excellent 
paths, as the sand was firm, except near the siunmit of the hill. 

On the windward s'ide of St. Vincent so much material is b(Mng 
swept into the sea by the streams that the coast is covei-ed with black 
sand, and near Overland Village it is possible to walk for a mile 
beneath the sea cliffs on a broad, sandy beach, where formerly the 
heavy surf of a weather shore beat against their base. In the arrow- 
root fields the original surface is often to a large extent uncovered, 
and on the upper slopes of the Soufriere there are man}^ places where 
none of the new ash is left, but the bare surface of the old rocks is 
everywhere exposed to view. After a heavy tropical shower valleys 
which are usually dry may be filled with a thundering torrent several 
feet deep and 20 or HO feet across. Under these circumstances it will 
easily he understood that ali'cady many of the streams have thoroughly 
cleaned out the ash from the upper parts of their channels where the 
gradient is steepest. 

But when sucli a torrent reaches the lower valleys, which have l)een 
filled with thick masses of hot sand, a strange conflict between tire and 
SM 1902 21 



322 ERUPTION OF THE SOUFRIEKE IN ST. VINCENT. 

water can be witnessed. The river plows its way deeper and deeper, 
constantl}^ sweeping- the material into the sea. The valleys, at first 
almost obliterated, are now reassuming their old appearance. Ter- 
races on their sides give evidence of former levels at which the streams 
flowed. There are five or six such terraces on the Wallilni. This 
river flows in gushes of hot steaming black mud, its intermittent flow 
being due to small landslides temporarily damming up its channel, 
only to be swept away as the pressure of the water increases. On the 
Rabaca Dry River ,here has been less erosion, and only after heavy 
rains does it reach the sea, as the water from the smaller showers is 
apparently eva})orated in its passage through the banks of hot ashes. 
After rains Ijoth rivers can be seen steaming all along the lower parts 
of their courses. 

When one of these streams comes down in force it undermines its 
banks by washing out the soft new ashes at their base. Then land- 
slides take place, and a curious spectacle results. When the hot ash 
tumliles down into the water an immense cloud of steam rises in the 
air to heights of hundreds of feet. It expands in great glol)ular 
masses exactly like the steam explosions from a crater, and as it drifts 
away before the wind fine dust rains from the cloud. We had the 
good fortune to witness a magnificent series of these explosions one 
day as we were descending from the summit of the Soufriere. It was 
in the valley of the Rozeau Dry River. After every landslip a column 
of nuiddy water rose to about 200 feet, carrying Avith it pieces of stone. 
Immense, quantities of steam shot up to 700 or SOO feet in the air. It 
resembled an enormous geyser of l)lack mud and steam. In the Wal- 
libu River after every shower these steam explosions may be wit- 
nessed taking place on a large scale. After a few hours of dry 
weather they cease, though the river can still be seen to be steaming 
strongly as it flows along. 

The structural modifications produced ui)on the hill by this ci'iiption 
have been astonishingly slight. W^e saw no fissures, no parasitic 
craters or cones, and no lava streams. Even the craters at th(> sununit 
retain essentially their old configuration. All the evidence points to 
the supposition that it was from the large or old crater that this 
eruption for the most part proceeded. But the snialU>r cratiM- has not 
disappeared, nor has it been filled up. We did not see it. hut we can 
rely on the evidence of several observers who knew it well before the 
eruption and have seen it since. The narrow ridge between it and 
the large crater still stands, though probably somewiiat lower than 
before, and possibly is slipping down in landslides on l)()tli sides. 

Like all the higher mountains of the Windward Islands, the Soufriere 
has usually its sununit capped with cloud, especially during th(> rainy 
season, and this was the case on both the daj^s on which we made the 
ascent. On the flrst occasion the mist lifted for a few miiuites and

The crater was formerly nine-tenths of a mih^ across and about 1,100

The low^er part is a i)recipice of bare rock. The bottom of the crater 
is nearly flat or slightly cupped. When we saw it, it contained three 
small lakes of water, greenish and turbid; that in the southeast coi-ner 
was throwing up jets of mud and steam with a hissing noise. It was 
in very much the same condition as when seen by the party which first 
ascended the mountain on May 31 — that including Mr. T. ]M. McDonald 
and Professor Jaggar — and on a slightly later date ))y Lieutenant Rob- 
inson, R. E. Mr. McDonald thought that there was rather less steam 
and the lakes of water were somewhat larger than when he saw it })re- 
viously. In his opinion and that of Mr. Powell the crater was oidy 
slightly larger than before the eruption, but considera])ly deeper. 
The estimates of the depth varied a good deal, but it seems, on the 
whole, to be generally agreed that it is al>out l,f)00 feet. 

Accurate measurements of the breadth or depth of the ci-ater were, 
under the circumstances, impossil)le. As seen from Chateaubelair the 
outline of the lip of the crater has suffered many modifications, though 
none of these is of any great importance. It is agreed that the soutli- 
ern edge is now somewhat lower than it was befoiv, the eruplion. and 
this is confirmed ])y our barometric measur(uneiits. 

It is reported that since we left St. Vincent the amount of water in 
the crater has increased; and should this contimie, a lake will ulti- 
mately be formed not uidike that which previously existed there. 
When the cliti's which form the north wall ha\e i'(>ached, by j-ep(>ated 
rock falls, a condition of adjustment and stability, and when \'(>get:i- 
tion has again covered the interior slopes, it is ])ossil)le that the crater 
of the Soufriere will have regained very much of its old appeai'ance. 
Should anyone vyho knew it before then n^turn to visit it, ho will have 
dilhculty in believing that it formed the orifice from which were

emitted the tremendous explosions of May T, 19(»2, It was. as we 
saw it, an impressive spectacle, its naked, rug-ged walls of rock looking 
down on the steaming lakes below. 

Apart from the changes which have taken place within the crater 
and tlie deposits of ash which have formed in the river valleys and on 
the surface of the hill, the only other important geological modifica- 
tion of the country has been the disappearance of a narrow strip of 
coast along the leeward side of the island. Near the mouth of the 
Wallilni, and from thence northward to Morne Ronde, the sea has 
encroached on the land for perhaps 200 yards. Below Wallibu plan- 
tation there stood a village of laborers' huts on a low, fiat beach with 
a blufi" behind. Here the sea now washes the foot of a clitf some 30 
feet high. This clifl* consists of soft tuffs covered with several feet of 
new, hot ashes, and is in an unstable condition, as masses are con- 
stantly falling down from its face. In this way a new beach is now 
forming in front of it. It is agreed by those who knew the district 
before the eruption that not onl}^ has the old beach disappeai-ed, which 
carried the village and the public road, but that part of the blufi" 
behind has also subsided. We were informed by Mr. T. M. McDon- 
ald, who is intimately accpiainted with this coast line, that similar 
subsidences had also taken place, though on a nnich smaller scale, at 
several places farthei north. There is no evidence elsewhere of any 
changes of level of land and sea. The tide marks on the rocks and the 
landing stages at the villages enabled us to ascertain that the level of 
high water was at any rate within a few inches of what it had been 
before. It was clear that the alterations in the coast line were due to 
local subsidence of the foreshores, and that they had mostly affected 
loose and ill-consolidated deposits, such as beach gravels and the fans 
of alluvium which had formed at the mouths of the streams. 

The submarine slopes on the leeward side of St. Vincent are A^er}^ 
steep, averaging about 1 in 4. Often within half a mile of the shore, 
or sometimes even less, the depth is over 100 fathoms. It seems most 
probable that, owing to the concussions and earthquakes produced })y 
the explosions, some of the less coherent accumulations on these steep 
slopes slipped bodily into the deep. On this supposition most of the 
facts would be explained, l)ut at the same time it is possil)le that at 
Wallibu the inner margin of the depressed tract may be a fault line. 
It has a very straight trend, and it is a curious fact that this shore was 
formerly known as Hot Waters. This might indicate the existence of 
a fissure up which hot springs were rising. 

When we arrived at Martinique we had the ])leasure of meeting 
Professor Lacroix, the head of the French scientific conunission, which 
had spent some tinu^ in making a preliminary survey of Mont Pelee and 
the north end ot th(^ island, and from him we obtained nuich valu- 
able information regarding the sequence of events and the geological 



ERUPTION OF THP: SOUFEIERE IN ST. VINCENT. 325 

eonsequencos of the oruptions in that qiuirter. It was our intention 
to make merely such I'eeonnoissance.s as would enable us in a general 
way to ascertain the points of ditierence and of similai'ity between the 
outburst of Mont Pelee and that of the Soufriere and to see what 
light the phenomena in Martini([ue threw" on the e\'ents which had 
happened in St. Vincent. 

Both volcanoes are of the same type, simph^ cones with a large vent 
near the sunnnit, tmd without parasitic craters. They are both deeply 
scored with ravines, and on their southwest sides there is a 1)road 
valley — occupied at Martinique by St. Pierre City; at St. Vincent by 
the AVallilni. It is in these valleys that the destruction has been most 
pronounced. In both, the recent eruptions have been characterized by 
paroxysmal discharges of incandescent ashes and a complete al)sence 
of lava stream .. 

In St. Vincent, however, the mass of material ejected has been much 
greater, and a consideral)ly larger area of country has \}oeu dtnastated 
than in Martinique. That the loss of life was not so great can be 
accounted for l)y the absence of a populous city at the foot of the 
mountain. Had St. Pierre been planted at the mouth of the Wallibn 
Valley, there can l)e no dou])t it would have been no less completely 
destro3^ed. 

On Mont Pelee we understand that a fissure has opened on the south 
side of the mountain between the summit and St. Pierre, from which 
the blast was emitted which overwhelmed the city. But on the Sou- 
friere the old oriiices have l)een made use of. The eruption of Pelee 
began with the flow of mud lavas, but none such were seen in St. 
Vincent. On the other hand, the hot blast which swept down on the 
devoted city was essentially similar to that which we have descril)ed 
as having taken place at the Soufriere. Both eruptions produced 
principally hot sand and dust with a small propoi'tion of bombs and 
ejected l)locks. The evidence of the captain of the Roddum and of 
the survivors of the Rorahiui afl'ords a very good idea of what hap- 
pened in St. Pierre on May 8. An avalanche of incandescent sand was 
launched against the city. In the north end, which was nearest the 
crater, the inhabitants were instantaneously killed, the walls of the 
houses leveled with the ground, and the town was al)laze in a moment. 
In the south end the ruin was less. Those Avails of the houses which 
faced the crater were demolished; those which ran north and south 
still stood, even when we were there, after the second eruption. In 
this quarter also all were killed, except a prisoner who was contined 
in an ill-ventilated cell in the j)rison, but we were told that for some 
minutes after the blast had passed people were seen rushing about in 
the streets, crying aloud with pain, and many threw themselves into 
the sea to escape the agony of their burns. It must be rememl)ered 
that a terrible conflagration followed the eruption, and for thirty -six 



326 EKUPTION OF THE SOUFKIERE IN ST. VINCENT. 

hours the city was a burning pile. Another eruption followed on the 
20th, and cast down many of the l)uilding's which were loft. Hence 
it was difficult to be sure exactly what were the effects of the volcanic 
blast, and what had to be ascribed to the conflagration. But we saw 
enough to satisfy us that the hot blast was proliably no less violent 
here than at St. Vincent. An iron statue of the Virgin, standing on a 
stone pedestal on the wooded clitf overlooking the town, had been 
broken off and carried 40 feet away. It lay with the head pointing to 
the mountain, and the direction of the statue showed that the l)last 
was traveling straight from the crater over the city. The cannon in 
the fort had l)een overthrown and had fallen away from the mountain, 
that is to say, in the same direction as the statue. The projecting 
ironwork of the verandas of the houses was twisted and bent. The 
light-houses were razed. The ships riding at anchor in the harbor 
were lying side-on to the blast. Some were capsized, others had their 
rigging cut clean away; only the Roddain escaped, and she was near 
the south end of the town. It was said that one man was ])lown clean 
off' the Rovdima. The trees which were growing in the streets were 
uprooted and cast down. Many of them showed charring and sand- 
blast erosion on the side which faced the crater, while the lee side was 
still covered with the original l)ark. 

During the minute or two which this blast lasted, so much dust fell 
on the Roddam that Captain Ford, the harbor master at St. Lucia, 
estimated that 12(» tons were removed f rom'her decks when she arrived 
there, and the chief engineer of the R. M. S. Esk^ who inspected her 
for Lloyd's, told us that the depth of the layer of ash was in some 
places 2 or 8 feet. Enough has been said to indicate the general simi- 
larity of the volcanic phenomena in Martinique and in St. Vincent. 
A fuller comparison, and more particularly the investigation of the 
outstanding points of difference, is best deferred till the detailed 
results of tlie French counnissioners' investigations are to hand. 

We were fortunate in having an opportunity of witnessing one of the 
more important eruptions of Mont Pelee l)efore we left Martini([ue, 
and this enabled us to see how far the actual phenomena corresponded 
with the ideas w^e had been led to form from an inspection of the effects 
of the earlier outbursts. On the i>th of July we were in a small sloop of 
10 tons, the Minerva^ of Grenada, which we had hired to act as a con- 
venient base for our expeditions on the mountain. The morning was 
spent in St. Pierre City and among the sugar-cane plantations on the 
lower slopes of the mountain, on the banks of the Riviere des Peres. 
The volcano was beautifully clear. Every ravine and furrow, every 
ridge and crag, on its gaunt, naked surface stood out clearly in the sun- 
light. (See pi. 1.) Thin clouds veiled the sunnnit, but now and then 
the mist would lift sufficient!}^ to show us the jagged, l)roken cliff' 
which overlooks the cleft. From the triani»"ular fissure Avhich serves 



ERUPTION oK THK SOUFKIERK IN ST. VINCENT. 327 

as the crater hardly a whiti' of steam was seen to rise, and the o-reat 
heap of hot bowlders which lies on the north side of and above this 
fissure could be perfectly made out. (See pi. JI.) Small landslides 
took place in it occasionally, and small jets of steam rose now and again 
from between the stones. 

A little after midday large steam clouds ])egan to rise, one every ten 
or twenty minutes, with a' low rumble. As they rose they expanded, 
becoming club-shaped, and consisting of many glol)ular rolling masses, 
constantly increasing in luunber and in size as they ascended in the 
air. They might ))e compared to a ])unch of grapes, large and small, 
or to a gigantic cauliflower. When their upward velocity diminished 
they floated away to leeward, and tine ash rained down in a dense mist 
as they drifted over the western side of the mountain. They occa- 
sioned no anxiety in our minds, as we had found that the mountain 
was never long without exhi1)iting these discharges, and they were due 
merely to an escape of steam, carrying with it fine dust. They rose, 
as a rule, to heights of 5,(100 oi- <;,000 feet above the sea. 

That afternoon, as the sun was getting lower in the heavens and the 
details of ravine and spur showed a contrast of light and shadow which 
was al)sent at midday, we sailed along from St. Pierre to Frecheur, 
intent on obtaining a series of general photographs of the hill. The 
steam pull's continued, and a])out (> o'clock, as we were standing l)ack 
across the Bay of St. Pierre, they became more numerous, though not 
much larger in size. We ran down toCarbet, a village li miles south 
of St. Pierre, where there is a supply of excellent water and good 
anchorage. About half past it was oV)vious that the activity of the 
mountain was increasing. The cauliflower clouds were no longer dis- 
tinct and se])arate, each folloAving the other after an interval, but arose 
in such rapid succession that they were blended in a continuous emis- 
sion. A thick cloud of steam streamed away l)efore the wind, so laden 
with dust that all the leeward side of the hill and the sea for miles 
from the shore was covei'cd with a dense pall of line falling ash. 
(See pi. 111.) The sun setting behind this cloud lost all its brightness 
and became a pale yellowish-green disk, easily observal»le with the 
naked eye. Darkness followed the short twilight of the Tropics, but a 
four days old moon shed sufficient light to enal)le us to see what was 
happening on the hillside. 

Just before darkness closed in we noticed a cloud which had in it 
something peculiar hanging over the lip of the fissure. At first glance 
it resembled the globular caulifiower masses of steam. It was, how- 
ever, darker in color, and did not ascend in the aii' or fioat away, but 
retained its shape, and slowly got larger and larger. After observing 
it for a short time we concluded that it was traveling straight down 
the hill toward us, expanding sonu>what as it came, but not rising in 
the air, onlv rolling over the surface of the ground. It was sototallv 



328 ERUPTION OF THE SOUFRIERE IN ST. VINCENT. 

distinct in its behavior from the ascending- steam clouds that our 
attention was liveted on it, and Ave were not without apprehension as 
to its character. It seemed to take some time to reach the sea (several 
minutes at least), and as it rolled over the bay we could see that 
through it there played innumerable lightnings. We weighed anchor 
and hoisted the sails, and in a few minutes we were slipping southward 
along the coast with a slight easterly wind and a favorable tide. 

We had, however, scarcely got under way when it became clear that 
an eruption was impending. As the darkness deepened, a dull red 
reflection was seen in the trade-wind cloud which covered the mountain 
summit. This became brighter and brighter, and soon we saw red-hot 
stones projected from the crater, bowling down the mountain slopes, 
and giving ofl' glowing sparks. Suddenly the whole cloud was ))rightly 
illuminated and the sailors cried, "The mountain bursts!" In an 
incredibly short space of time a red-hot axalanche swept down to the 
sea. We could not see the sununit, owing to the intervening veil of 
cloud, l)ut the fissure and the lower parts of the mountain were clear, 
and the glowing cataract poured over them right down to the shores 
of the bay. It w-as dull red, with a billowy surface, reminding oiu3 of a 
snow avalanche. In it there were larger stones which stood out as 
streaks of l)right red, tumbling down and emitting showers of sparks. 
In a few minutes it was over, A loud, angry growl had burst from 
the mountain when this avalanche was launched from the crater. It is 
difficult to say how^ long an interval elapsed l)etween the time when 
the great glare shone on the summit and the incandescent avalanche 
reached the sea. Possibly it occupied a couple of minutes; it could 
not have l)een nuich more. Undoubtedly the velocity was terrific. 
Had any buildings stood in its path they would have bc^en utterl}' 
wiped out, and no living creature could have survived that blast. 

Hardly liad its red light faded when a rounded l)lack cloud began 
to shape itself against the star-lit sky exactly where the avalanche 
had been. The pale nioonlight shining on it showed us that it was 
globular, with a bulging surface, covered with rounded protuberant 
masses, which swelled and nudtiplied with a terrible energy. It 
rushed forward over the waters, directly toward us, boiling, and chang- 
ing its form every instant. In its face there sparkled innumei'able 
lightnings, short, and many of tlu^m horizontal. Especially at its l)ase 
there was a continuous scintillation. Th(> cloud itself was black as 
night, dens(> and solid, and the flickering lightnings gave it an inde- 
scriV)ably venomous appeai'ance. It moved with great velocity, and 
as it appT'oached it got larger and larger, hut it retained its rouncUnl 
form. It did not spread out laterally, ncitluM- did it rise into the air, 
but swept on over the sea in surging globular masses, corruscating 
with lightnings. 

When about a mile from us it was perc(^ptibly slowing down. We 
then estimated that it w^as 2 miles broad and about 1 mile hiuh. It

l)ei^-;in to cliano-o its foriii; fresli protiiheraiu-f's cea.sed to shoot out or 
grew but slowly. They were loss gloljular, and the face of the cloud 
more nearly reseinl)led a ])lack curtain dniped in folds. At the same 
time it ])ecamei)alerand more gray in color, and for a time the sui-face 
shimmered in the moonlight like a piece of silk. The particles of ash 
were now settling down, and the white steam, freed from entangled 
dust, was beginning to rise in the aii'. 

The cloud still traveled forward, but now was mostly steam, and 
rose from the surface of the sea, passing over our heads in a great 
tongue-shaped mass, which in a few minutes was directly al)ove us. 
Then stones, some as large as a cliestnut,'l)egan to fall on the ])oat. 
They were followed l)y small pellets, which rattled on the deck like a 
shower of peas. In a minute or two tine, gray ash, moist and clinging 
together in small globules, poured down upon us. After that for some 
time there was a rain of dry, gray ashes. But the cloud had lost most 
of its solid matter, and as it shot forward over our heads it left us in a 
stratum of clear, pure air. \\'hen the Wuo ash began to fall, there was 
a smell of sulphurous acid, but not wry marked. There was no rain. 

The volume of steam discharged must have V)een enormous, for the 
tongue-shaped cloud broadening, as it passed southward, covered the 
whole sky except a thin rim on the extreme horizon. Dust fell on 
Fort de France and the whole south end of Martinique. The display 
of lightning was magniticent. It threaded the cloud in ever}' direction 
in irregular branching lines. At the same time there was a continuous 
low ruml)le overhead. 

AVhat happened on Mont Pelee after this discharge can not be 
definitely ascertained. For some hours afterwards there were 1>rilliant 
lightnings and loud noises which we took for thunder. That night 
there was a heaxy thunder stoi'm over the north end of Mai'tini([ue, 
and much of the lightning was atmospheric, but probably the eruption 
had something to do with it. and the noises may have Ijccmi in })art of 
volcanic oi'igin. 

There can l)e no doubt that the eruption we witnessed was a counter- 
part of that which destroyed St. Pierre. The mechanism of these dis- 
charges is obscure and many interesting problems are invoh cd, but 
we are convinced that the glowing avalan<'he consisted of hot sand and 
gases, principally steam; and when we passed the hill in R. M. 8. Vdrc 
a few days later we had, l)y the kindness of the captain, an excellent 
opportunity of making a close examination of the shore from the bridge 
of the steaml)oat. The southwest side of the hill, along the course of 
the Riviere Seclie, was covercnl with a thin coating of freshly fallen 
tine gray ashes, which appeared to l)(> thickest in the stream valleys. 
The water of the rivers tlowing down this })art of the hill was steaming 
hot. This was undoubtedlv the material emitted from tho crater on 



330 ERUPTION OF THE SOUFRIEKE IN ST. VINCENT. 

the night of the eruption. There was no hiva. We saw no explosions 
of combustil^le gases and nothing like a sheet of flame. We were 
agreed that the scintillations in the cloud were ordinary lightnings, 
which shot from one part of its mass to another, and partly also struck 
the sea beneath. 

The most peculiar feature of these eruptions is the avalanche of 
incandescent sand and the great black cloud which accompanies it. 
The preliminary stages of the eruption, which may occupy a few days 
or onl}^ a few hours, consist of outbursts of steam, flne dust, and stones, 
and the discharge of the crater lakes as torrents of water or of nuid. 
In them there is nothing unusual, but as soon as the throat of the 
crater is thoroughly cleared and the climax of the eruption is reached, 
a mass of incandescent lava rises and wells over the lip of the crater 
in the form of an avalanche of red-hot dust. It is a lava blown to 
pieces by the expansion of the gases it contains. It rushes down the 
slopes of the hill, carrying with it a terrific blast which mows down 
everything in its path. The mixture of dust and gas beha\es in many 
ways like a fluid. The exact chemical composition of these gases 
remains unsettled. They apparently consist principally of steam and 
sulphurous acid. There are many reasons which make it unlikel}^ 
that the}' contain much oxygen, and they do not support respiration. 

After visiting Martinique we proceeded to Dominica, where Dr. Flett 
visited the Soufriere at the south end of the island and the famous 
Boiling Lake and Grand Soufriere. There have been few signs of 
increased volcanic activity here or in St. Lucia during the recent erup- 
tions. Dr. Tempest Anderson spent some dtiya in Grenada in an exam- 
ination of the lagoon at St. Georges, but particulars regarding these 
islands may be I'eserved till a fuller report appears. 

DESCRIPTION OF THK Pi.ATKS. 

Plate I. — Mv)d Pelfr from the west. — Taken from the sea near I'rechenr, a village 
north of St. Pierre. This view shows how the mountain is cut up into deep ravines 
by the tropical rains. Part of the summit is concealed by clouds, and the fissure 
from which the eruption was proceeding was apparently behind and to the ri^ht 
of the small central peak in the background. 

Plate II. — Mont Pelee from the southwest. — This photo,i,napli \\as taken from the sea 
off the mouths of the Riviere Seche and Riviere Blanche, which are about 2 miles 
north of St. Pierre. It shows the rugged character of the mountain, the summit 
of whit-h is concealed by clouds. The slope in the foreground is the track of the 
avalanches which descended from the triangular (dark-colored) fissure to the right 
of the central peak. 

Plate HI. — 3font Pelee in erxeptUm. — Taken from a sloop off St. Pierre on the after- 
noon of July 9. It shows the "cauliflower" shapes assumed by the clouds of dust 
and steam as they drifted westward out to sea. The lightei'-colored cloud to the 
east (or right) is the trade-wind cloud which so constantly cdvcrcd the summit. 
A small light-colored cloud patch just below this, (m the right-hand (eastern) side, 
indicates the fissure from which the eruption chiefiy i)roceeded. The eruptive 
" avalanche" of volcanic material descended the slopes in the center and rather to 
the left of the foreground. St. Pierre is to the right, outside the picture.

The continuation of activity in the case of Mont Pelee and La 
Soufriere of St. Vincent makes it evident that it is yet too early to 
write a final report on their recent eruptions. Vfhat may he termed 
a first approximation. howe\er. to the sig-nificance of the observa- 
tions concerning- them already in hand,^ may be of interest to the 
members of the National (Teographic Society. 

The numhei' of (letlve crato's. — The first question to which an answer 
is sought concerning both Mont Pelee and La Soufriere is: Ha\e the 
recent eruptions occurred from a single and essentially a summit 
crater in each instance, or have secondary or subcraters ])een opened 
on the sides of the volcanoes, which had a connection with their con- 
duits:! In the case of La Soufriere no ditferences of opinion in this 
connection have arisen among* the several observers who have \ isited 
the mountain. The eruptions have all occurred in a single crater, the 
so-called old crater, in distinction from the one formed in 1812. This 
crater is near the sununit of the mountain, but is partially encircled 
on the northeast l)y a reumant of a nuich older and far lai'ger crater, 
which corresponds with Mont Sunnuaat \'(>su\ ins, and may be teiined 
a ''sonuiia." 

At ^lont Pelee there is also a sonuna, and on its southwest side is 
the crater known as Etang Sec, which is now in eru})tion. A smaller 
sunnuit crater, formerly occupied ]>y Lac des Palmistes, occui's to the 
northeast of the one now active, and corresponds in a general way 
with the crater of 1812 on St. Vincent. While several observers 
have reported the existence of at least two sulx^raters — onci on 
the east and the other on the southwest slope of Mont Pelee, 
the former termed the ^'Falaise crater'' and the latter the "Riviere 
Blanche crater" — a careful considcM'ation of the evidences presented 
tails to show that these are true centers of eru[)tion having deep

sources. Gi'eat explosions have occurred, however, at each of the 
localities referred to, which have thrown large quantities of dust and 
mud to a height of several hundred feet, and sent out vast volumes of 
steam to a height of many thousands of feet; but these phenomena 
are seemingly the same, although marked by greater energy, as have 
been observed in a large num))er of instances on both Martinique and 
St. Vincent, where the hot dust, lapilli, stones, etc., ejected from the 
summit crater in each instance, have accumulated to a great depth and 
been invaded by surface water. While the subcraters mentioned 
should not, in my opinion, be considered as true volcanoes, they sinui- 
late many of the phenomena attending actual eruptions from deep 
conduits. The columns of steam, heavily charged with dust and mud, 
which arise from them have the convoluted or cauliiiower structure, 
and at times expand at the top and take on nuishroom shapes in nuich 
the same maimer as do the columns of steam similarly charged with 
rock fragments that are blown into the air from a primary crater. 
In each case the proximate cause is the same, namely, a steam explo- 
sion. The solid material blown into the air in each instance is also of 
the same natui'c for the reason that tbe hot dust and stones, to which 
the superlicial explosions are due, were supplied by the eruption of the 
summit crater. Since the o])served pheriomena are so similar, it may 
be asked: What is the crucial test by which a true crater may ))e distin- 
guished from a pseudocrater ? To formulate a definite answer to this 
question is difficult. Perhaps the best reply that can be offered is that 
the pscnidocraters are later in the time of their appearance than tiie 
main eruptions which supplied the hot material necessary for their 
production, and that they occur when the topographic conditions 
previous to the eruptions favored the accunudation of a deep deposit 
of hot debris. In addition, on ])oth Martinique and St. Vincent a com- 
plete gradation in size and energy of the superticial steam explosions 
has l)e(Mi observed, ranging from small ge3'ser-like spoutings (PI. I), 
such as have occurred at hundreds of localities in valleys that were 
deeply tilled with hot debris, and even on broad and comparatively 
smooth surfaces covered with a thick sheet of similar material, up to 
the markedly energetic explosions in the valleys of the Falaise and 
Riviere Blanche. In many instances the smaller surface explosions 
have been observed to follow heavy rains, and the same is true also of 
the larger ex})losions referred to. The main ex})losions from the 
summit craters have not only been vastly more energetic than anj^ 
that have occurred at the sites of the ps(uidocraters, but the debris 
blown out was incandescent, while the material thrown into tlie air by 
the explosions in the hot accunudations in the ri\(M- valleys has not 
been observed to be even red hot. The minor eruptions from the 
summit crater, however, may l)e due to precisely the same immediate 
cause as the eruptions of the pseudocraters — namely, the access of

surface water to hiohly Jieated rocks, so that an a])i)arently coniplete 
sequence may V)e observed V)etiWeen the escape of steam from hot 
del)ris and the dischar<«(>s from true volcanic conduits. It is thus seen 
that the discovery of th(^ crucial test asked for is ditticult, and the final 
decision, if one is reached, nuist rest on a judicial ])alancino- of all the 
evidence and the weij^ht to l)e given to the judgment of individual 
observers. An insti'uctive fact furnished l)y the pseudocraters (even 
when the larger and, as some persons may think, questionable exam- 
ples are not considered) which has a bearing on the theories of the 
ultimate causes of volcanic eruptions is the close similarity and, in 
fact, identity that exists between the explosions due to surface water 
gaining access to beds of hot debris and the explosions during primary 
eruptions in the sunuuit portions of true volcanic conduits. In the 
former instances surface water descends into hot-rock debris; and, 
from the fact that water is present in the superficial portion of the 
earth's crust, it seems equally manifest in the latter instance that 
highly heated rock rises fi'om deep within the earth and meets the 
surface waters. In each instance steam explosions result. 

The conditions favoring the ociairrence of pseudo-eruptions and the 
character of the topographic changes produced by them are clearly 
shown in the sketch and section forming fig. 2, PI. II, which accompa- 
nies an instructive article on the "Secondary Phenomena of the West 
Indian Volcanic Eruptions,'"' by G. C. Curtis," pul)lished since the 
pi'esent essay appeared. Some of the secondary craters, or "ash- 
geyser cones," on Martinique and St. Vincent are stated l)y Curtis 
to ])e 4U feet high and IHO feet in diameter, with slopes averaging- 
's^ to 3(»-. 

Y((r!<it!<m t n iJic ci-KptloHs of the prima rij crater^. — The variations 
presented by the steam colunms that ascend from acti\e volcanoes — 
of which the so-called pine tree of Vesuvius is a well-known exam- 
ple — and which in many instances afford the most spectacular of the 
awe-inspiring phenomena associated with them, have been described 
by several observers who have recently visited Martinique and St. 
Vincent, but most graphically l)y Georg'e Kennan. The variations 
referred to are indicative of what takes place in an active crater and 
in the upper part of the conduit leading to it, and furnish evidence in 
reference to the changes there in progress. A classification of the 
various phases presented 1)}^ the steam colunm rising from Mont Pelee 
lias been presented b}^ the gifted traveler just referred to, which is 
instructive: 

" The vapor column ascending from Mont Pelee," writes Kennan, 
"varies greatly from day to day and sometimes from hour to hour, 
not only in density, 1)ut in color, form, and general ai)i)earance. In 
its varying aspects it may be desci'ibcd as follows:

white steam, which has neither sharp, clearlj' defined outlines, nor 
pufi-like convohitions, and which suggests steam rising* from the hot 
water of a geyser basin or from the escape pipe of a big ocean steamer." 

The explanation of the occurrence of such a column from a crater 
of the t3'pe of the one at the summit of Mont Pelee, a sketch of which 
by Varian is herewith given (fig. 1, PI. II), seems to be that the top 
of the lava column is well below the bottom of the crater, and that 
the hot rocks are discharging steam, owing to the contact with them 
of water percolating in from the crater walls or falling as rain. The 
generation of steam is a surface phenomena, and due essentially to the 
same cause as the escape of steam from hot del^ris ejected by a volcano 
and accumulating in valleys, etc. The notable feature is the absence 
of convolutions and more or less individualized fleece-like masses in 
the ascending column, such as are produced ])y small steam explosions 
from li(juid lava, as is frequently the case at Vesuvius. 

'■'2. The vapor of modei-ate activity: A cohinui of greater density 
and somewhat darker color, which rolls and unfolds a little as it rises, 
and looks like steam mixed with brownish or yellowish smoke from 
the chimney of a manufactory." 

This stage may reasonabl}' be supposed to indicate conditions simi- 
lar to those mentioned in the first instance, but more intense. A con- 
siderable volume of water gaining access to the deep funnel-shaped 
crater might not be vaporized before descending to the sununit of the 
column of liquid or but partiallv congealed column of rock Avithin the 
conduit, and energetic explosions result. The steam coknnns indica- 
tive of moderate activity thus correspond with the columns produced 
by the maximum explosions of pseudo-craters. The inner slope of the 
crater of Mont Pelee is precipitous, and, as several observers have 
reported, portions of its walls overhanging. The fall of blocks of 
rocks from the crater walls would no doubt cause a conspicuous col- 
umn of dust-laden steam to ascend. 

'■'3. The vapor of dangerous activity: A sharply defined dark- 
yellow column of what a])pears to be li(|uid mud, which l)()ils out of 
the volcano in huge, rounded masses, swelling and evolving in inunense 
convolutions as it rises — one gigantic nuid bubble breaking u}) out of 
another in tui"n — until over the crater there stands a solid opacjue })il- 
lar of ))oiling, unfolding, evolving mud vapor 500 feet in diameter 
and eight or ten thousand feet in height." 

'^riie a})pearanc(^ of the volcano duiMiig the stage here descril)ed is 
illustrated by sketch by Varian, forming PI. IV, and by fig. 1, PI. MI. 
When such a debris-charged steam column rises from a crater there 
is no (pu^stion as to the presence of a conduit leading down deep into 
the earth. The pseudo-craters never reach such intensity.

with ;i tienuMidous volocitv, like the smoke of a collossiil piece of 
artillery tired heavenward. This shaft goes to a height of tifteen or 
twenty thousand feet, and then mushrooms out laterally, so as to 
cover a circle 50 nnles or more in diameter, with a Nolcanic canopy 
which is as dark as the ))lackest thunder cloud and whii-h shuts out 
the light of day like a total eclijjse. The projectile force in eruptions 
of this kind is so great tiiat it throws the black vapor far above the 
influence of the trade winds, and the advancing edge of the volcanic 
mantle moves swiftly eastward 2 miles or more above the fleecy trade- 
wind clouds that are drifting in the opposite direction."'' 

Something of the teri'ifying grandeur of a, great eruption described 
al)ove is suggested by a sketch forming PI. \. In tlu^ making of such 
a cohnnn the voliune of water and of comminuted rock reijuired is 
enormous. The volume of the colunni is in tlie neigliborhood of 
4,000.000,000 cu])ic feet. 

If 1 per cent of the cohmm is solid matter, it e([uals -io.doo.ooo cubic 
feet— eipiais 8,000,000 tons. 

If 10 per cent of the colunm is solid matter, it e((uais 400,000.()0() 
cubic feet— eijuals 30,000,000 tons. 

To be sure, we have no accurate measures, oio' information being 
almost entirely qualitative; but as such a column as is referred to has 
l)een o])served to reach a height by estimate of 10.000 feet in two 
minutes, it may seemingly l)e safely assumed that it rcMiched its full 
de\elopment in less than five minutes. The coarser of the solid mat- 
ter first shot out then begins to fall, and the form of the colunm is 
maintained by new matter dri\en upward from the crater. Thus 
during eacii five minut»»s of an eruption some 4,000, 000,000 cul)ic feet 
of debris-laden steam were expelled from the crater. The average 
duration of such eruptions is not known. l)ut in certain instances the}^ 
continued for a considerable^ fraction of an hour. During oavh hour 
that Mont Pelee or La Soufriere was in full blast something like 
4S, 000, 000. 0(10 cubic feet of dust and stone laden steam were driven 
out. Only guesses can be made as to the amount of solid matter the 
steam contained. Shall w^e assume 1 pn- cent or lo per cent^ Most 
observers would agree, I fancy, not only that the lattei- was nearer 
the truth than the former estimate, but that the ti'ue measni'e is in 
excess of the larger of the two. 

The material extruded in a solid condition, as will be shown laO.'r, is 
fresh lava which came from deep within th(^ earth; but mingled with 
it are rock fragments that were torn from the Avails of the conduits 
through which the discharges occurred. The per cent of old la\a 
among the ejected solids seems to l)e greater on St. Vincent than on 
Maitinique. In harmony with this is the larger size of the ci'ater of 
La Soufriere in comparison with that of Mont Pelee. 

The columns of steam of Kennan's type No. 1 thus show that great 
volumes of rock' are rising from deep within the earth and l)eing blown

inu) the air. If, as .seems probable, the energy displayed by steam 
columns of the No. 2 tj^pe is all than can be supplied by the steam pro- 
duced from rain and jjercolating water in the upper part of the con- 
duit, it follows that durino- explosions of the No. 3 type both rock and 
steam are rising from a depth in the volcanic conduits. Presumably, 
then, during- eruptions of the types No. 3 and No. -i molten rock is being- 
forced up within the conduit of a volcano and, owing to relief of pres- 
sure as it rises, the steam dissolved in the molten magma escapes with 
tremendous violence. There are thus two sources for the steam which 
furnish the energy displayed in the summit portions of ascending lav^a 
columns — one from the rain and percolating water, and the other from 
a deeper but unknown source. But this attempt to follow the volcanic 
conduits downward in fancy has brought us to the region of specula- 
tion and it is time to stop, at least for the present. 

To the four types of volcanic-steam columns dcscriljcd above, a lifth 
might be added to include volcanic explosions like that of Krakatoa. 

Prodiidx. of the eruptions. — The material discharged from Mont 
Pelee and La Souf riere may be divided into two portions — lirst, steam 
and gases, and, second, solid rock debris. Up to the present time no 
observations indicate that molten rock has been extruded; that is, no 
lava streams have flowed over the surface from the crater of either 
volcanoes or issued from fissures in their sides. 

As to the discharge of vast volumes of steam, there is no difi'erence 
of opinion to be formed in the various reports already rendered. 
Observers who have visited the craters from which the recent erup- 
tions came, and have even ventured within them, report onh' faint 
traces of gases. The conditions, however, between the time when a 
crater is quiescent and when violent explosions occur within it are 
no doubt different, and as yet but little evidence concerning the gases 
that mav have been present during the times of most violent activity 
has been ol)taincd. The most that can be accepted in this connection 
is a plainly perceptible odor of sulphui'ous acid noticealde in the air, 
even at a distance of some 8 miles at sea, when the \<)l('anoes were in 
a compai'ativ(dy mild state of activity and while walking over the 
debris they sliowered on their respective islands. A nuich fainter 
odor of sulphuretted hydrogen is reported to have l)een present, as, for 
example, among the ruins of St. Pierre, but whether due to gas emit- 
ted from the volcano or arising from organic matter buried beneath 
the still hot debris is not clear. The presence of carbon dioxide, 
although asserted or surmised to have been discharged during the 
greater eruptions, has not been proven. The consideration of :dl the 
available evidence points strongly to the conclusion that steam was the 
chief vaporous or gaseous substance^ emitted, but mingled with it were 
minor (juantities of sulphurous and no doubt other gases. 

In the above connection it should be noted that flames above the

jsumnut of ))oth Mont Pelee and La Soiifriere have been reported h}" 
several trustworthy" witnesses. If the a])pearances referred to were 
in realit}' tlame, and not glowing dust or the reflection of the light 
from incandescent rocks on vapor, it is evident that inflammable gases 
were present. No spectroscopic observations seem to have been made, 
however, and until this is done the evidence as to the presence of 
inflammal)le gases in notable (quantity must l)e received with caution. 

The reports that Alont Pelee and I^a Soufriere discharged nuid are 
proba))ly correct so far as would appear from a distance, yet the true 
meaning would seem to be that sucii eruptions were of the nature of 
the explosions in the pseudo-crater or in the true craters during inter- 
vals l)etween the eruptions from a deep source. Hot dust and lapilli 
accunudating in a crater during quiescent stages wouhl furnisli most 
favorable c(nKlitions for the producing of superficial explosions where 
rain occurred or s})i-ings entered a crater from its sides, as has been 
observed, and would produce eruptions similar to those of the pseudo- 
crater, and nuid flows might result. It is evidently not to be inferred 
that either of the ^'olcaIloes in question has erupted mud from a 
deeply seated source. 

The solid matter discharged from Mont Pelee and La Soufriere is 
almost entirely in the condition of angular fragments ^■arying in size 
from those weighing in the neighborhood of 1.000 tons to the rinest 
of dust particles. The fragmental material is of two classes: First, 
fragments of the rocks torn from the walls of the conduits through 
which the upward rush of debris-charged steam occurred; and, second, 
fragments of hardened la\a which had JK'en forced upward into the 
conduits in a plastic condition and shattered and blown out by the 
escaping steam. In addition to the angular fragments of fresh lava, 
minor quantities of more or less si)herical masses of similar material, 
which were projected into the air M'hile yet moderat(dy plastic, have 
also been observed. Wliile the term volcanic bomi) has been a})plied 
to much of the ejected material, it is evident that only the somewhat 
'spln'rical masses referred to deserve to Ix^ so called, and even in such 
instances there is doubt as to tlu^ pi'oi)ricty of using the term. Typ- 
ical \olcanic bombs ha\'e a round or oval form, with extended and 
spirally twisted proj(>ctions at the ends of the longer axis, the spher- 
ical or more connnoidy oval form and the spii'ally twisted extremities 
being due to the rotation of the mass during its aC-rial flight and while 
yet plastic. No projectiles answei'ing this description lia\'e as yet 
been reported as occuiring on Martini<|ue or St. \'incent. The near- 
est ap})roa('h to a characteristic bond) are certain rud(dy s])herical 
masses of lava with ci-acked surfaces (fig. 2, PI. IIJ) and without ])i'o- 
jectionsoi- indicationsof a sjjiral twist. L\'identiy thesis ])oorl\- sha[)ed

rigid to acquire the typical shape frequentl}' to be seen in large 
numbers of bombs about certain basaltic craters. 

The absence of characteristic bom))s on Martinique and St. V^incent 
is in keeping with the composition of the lava thrown out. The fresh 
lava is an andesite, having in a general way the composition of a 
refractory brick, and unless very highly heated woukl not be plastic. 
The dark color of the columns of steam rolling up from the craters 
when in violent eruption, and the vast quantities of fragmentai 
material showered on the adjacent land and sea is evidence that as 
molten rock was forced up the volcanic conduits it became cooled and 
stiffened before reaching the summits of the volcanoes and was shat- 
tered by steam explosions, and the fragments blown into the air. Not 
only are true volcanic bombs absent, but clots and splashes of plastic 
or fluid rocks, such as are common about many volcanoes that have 
erupted easih' fusible material, are also lacking. 

The fragments ejected were in many instances blown to a height of 
many thousands of feet, the finer lapilli and dust being carried perhaps 
5 or () miles high, and on falling were distri])uted in part through tlie 
influence of the winds, in a general way in reference to size and weight. 
The larger and heavier masses fell near the craters from which they 
were projected, while much of the finer and lighter material was car- 
ried great distances. Variations in the method of distribution were 
caused by the direction of the hurricane-like blasts which swept down 
from bothMont Pelee and La Souf riere during their mightier eruptions, 
by the direction of the trade winds and upper-air currents, and by 
tornado-like swirls in the greatly disturbed atmosphere. Immediately 
following each great eruption, also, there was a strong indraft of cool 
air from about the region covered with hot debris. The vastness of the 
area on which the ejected material fell is indicated l)v the fall of 
dust on Barbados, Trinidad, and on ships 275 miles southeast of St. 
Vincent. 

Observations ri'|)()rtod by E. O. Honc}^ show that, contrary to earlier 
accounts, written in part by myself, coarse material fell in St. Pierre. 
The riddling of boiler plates one-fourth inch thick (PI. VI), in the 
northern portion of the stricken city, by stone shot against them from 
Mont Pelee, is evidence that the hurricanes of steam charged with hot 
dust, which swept down from that volcano on May S or May 20, and 
perhaps during later eruptions, were acconjpanied by a bombardment 
of stones, no doubt hot, which were as di^adly as solid shot tired from 
a cannon. 

Causes of dcat/i. —Respecting the gencM'al cause of death in St. 
Pierre, the reports of various observers ditter more widely than in 
connection with any other occurrence associated with the eruption of 
Mont Pelee, unless it be in reference to the secondary craters referred 
to above. Obviouslv manv deaths occuri-ed in St. Pierre from the

])ombai'dnient of missiles thirt swept throuoh the city, as just men- 
tioned, from the falling of walls and other objects, from the tire that 
followed the volcanic blast, from nervous shock, etc.; but opinions 
diti'er as to the principal cause of the loss of life. The opinions 
referred to fall in two groups: ((/) Those favoring- the idea that gases 
were the deadly agency, and (/>) those which refer the loss of life 
to the eiiects of steam charg-ed with hot dust. 

{(() Certain observers are strongly inclined to the opinion that Mont 
Pelee, or moreaccuratel}', the " Riviere Blanche su])crater," discharged 
gases which asphyxiated the inha])itants of St. Pierre. As to the 
nature of the supposed gases, at least two suggestions have hoou made — 
one that it was mainly sulphureted hydrogen, and the other, carlwn 
dioxide or some siiuilar gas. Coupled with the tirst of these sugges- 
tions is the further hypothesis that gas explosions took place within 
the cit}" and added to the deadly effect of the asphyxiating gases. The 
hypothesis that gases were the direct cause of the greater part of the 
loss of life, as claimed at St. Pierre, has not, so far as I am aware, l)een 
extended to St. Vincent, l)ut the dead and the injured on the two 
islands met their fate in precisely similar ways. The evidence bearing 
on the question under consideration has been judiciously discussed by 
George Kennan, and the testimon}' of the sole survivor of the disaster 
of May S placed on record. Had noxious gases, tuid especially such 
heav}' ones as carbon dioxide and sulphureted hydrogen, been swept 
over the city in suthcient quantiti(\s to kill nearly all the inhabitants, 
it is evident that the occupant of a cell below the level of the adjacent 
street would have been in a most dangerous position. The t(\stimony 
of the prisoner referred to, as summarized by Kennan, after a critical 
eross-examination, is that he "" heard no explosions or detonations; saw 
noHanie; smelled no sulphurous gas; and had no feeling of suffocation. 
He was simply burned 1)}' hot air and hot ashes which came into his 
cell through tlie door grating." 

It is impracticable to review in this essay all the evidence wliich it 
is claimed sustains the h^qoothesis of asphyxiation by gases. This 
side of the discussion, however, has been well presented l)y K. T. Hill 
in the National Geographic Magazine, in the Century Magazine, and 
in Collier's Weekly, and b}" Angelo Heilprin" in McClure's Magazine. 
(See list at end of this essay.) 

(A) The efficiency of steam charged with hot dust, or of cither of 
these agencies alone, to cause scalds, burns, and cvcmi instantaneous 
death, is not open to dou))t. The question is: Was the steam and hot 
dust swept overtho portions of Martinique and St. Vincent at the time 
so many thousand people were killed the chi(^f agency in their desti'uc- 
tion :! Cumulative evidence has been added to the \'arious classes of

facts presented b}^ me in the July nunil)er of this magazine/' which 
sustains conclusions then reached. I refer to the narrative of George 
Keunan pul)lished in the Outlook for August 16, the preliminary report 
made by Tempest Anderson and J. S. Flett to the Roj^al Societ}^ of Lon- 
don, and the preliminary report made by E. O. Ilovey to the American 
Museum of Natural Histor3\ Although f rankh^ confessing that I am 
not an unbiased judge of the printed testimon}', yet it seems fair to 
claim that the evidence presented is conclusive as to the important 
part taken by steam and hot dust in the sudden destruction of the peo- 
ple of St. Vincent on May 7 and of the inhabitants of St. Pierre on 
May 8. 

Dovjmnard volc<inu'hlaf<ts. — Intimately associated with the destruc- 
tion of St. Pierre is the direction taken by the blast of dust-charged 
steam, with its volleys of stones, which swept over the city. The 
hypothesis that St. Pierre was destro3xd b}'^ an eruption from the 
"Riviere Blanche subcrater"" being rejected, and the further sugges- 
tion, based on the earlier reports in reference to the opening of a fis- 
sure in the side of the mountain, not finding support in later evidence, 
the way is cleared for a better understanding of the true cause of the 
direction 'taken by the down blast that came, as now seems definitely 
proven, from the Etang Sec, which is essentiall\" a suuunit crater. 

To 'understand the nature of the A'olcanic blast which destroyed St. 
Pierre, one needs to visit the region swept by a similar eruption on 
St. Vincent. The volcanoes on these two islands have not only shown 
a direct relationship in the times of their eruptions, but the surface 
phenomena exhibited by one is the counterpart of what took place in 
the case of the other. Happily on St. Vincent, however, there was 
no densely populated city within the radius of greatest destruction. 

On St. Vincent the region throughout which the previously luxu- 
riant vegetation, plantations, etc., were swe})t away or l)urie(l beneath 
hot dust and stones, encircles the mountain. The direction in which 
trees wei'e swept down, and on the peripheiy of the devasted area the 
erosion of the l)ark of trees still standing, on the side facing the vol- 
cano, as well as luut-h other evidence, show in a most conclusive man- 
ner that a blast charged with dust and stones .swept down the sloj)es 
of Ija Soufriere in all directions. The infiuenc(^ of hills at a distiince 
of some -i or .5 miles from the volcano in shielding the veg(*tation on

from destruction of a narrow fringe aT)Out the northeast l)orderof the 
island. The outward direction that the ])last took from the mountain, 
its decreasing intensit}' with increase in the distance it traveled, and 
the absence of even hypothetical subcratei's. all Ix^ar witness that Ihe 
heavily dust and stone charged steam from the old crater near the 
sunnnit swept downward and outward with hurricane force, in a 
similar way to the more localized blast from Mont Price which 
destroyed St. Pierre. 

The one conspicuous feature of Mont Pelee which diliers from any- 
thing on La Soufriere is the presence in the southwest })ortion of its 
active crater of a deep notch — the Fente or Terre Fendue which, as 
stated by lleilprin. has been a conspicuous feature of the mountain 
since the eru})tion of ls5I. and may have existed pre^'ious to that 
event. This cleft is in plain \iew from St. Piin're, and during my 
visit to the dead city one could look into it and plaiidy sec^ tlie ruddy 
cone of eruption with its ascending steam column that was being built 
within the crater. The area rendered desolati^ l>y the hot blast from 
Mont P(dee on May 8, and again swept ov<m' by a similar blast on May 
-!0, is fan-shaped, the apex of tln^ triangle being essentially at the 
sunnnit of the mountain. The coincidence Ix'tween the position and 
direction of the Fente and the apex of the expanding Aolcaiiic ])lasts 
may well be considered signiticant. From the various accounts of the 
eruptions of Mont Pelee a\'aila]>le, it now seems e^•ident that the 
blasts which destroyed so nuich of the vegetation of Marlini(|ue and 
wrought ha\'oc in St. Pierre ctune fi'om the crater with a (h^'ply 
notched rim, and that the direction taken by the blasts, at least on 
May 8 and May i?»», was determined by that rift in the crat(>i"s rim. 

As stated by T. A. Jaggar, the downward blasts from xolcanoes do 
not require a horizontal iiozzle to project them. "'They are simpl}- 
the result of the down ])last after the heavy gravel has begun to fall, 
acting against the upl)last from the throat of the volcano, and both 
together deflected and thrown into terrific whirls or tornadoes." This 
explanation, although briefly stated, ma}' seemingly ]h\ taken as the 
leading cause of the downward sweep of the steam chai'ged with rock 
fragments on both Mont Pelee and La Soufriei-e. It does not seem 
clear, however, that the down blasts occur only after a towering 
colunm of debris-charged steam has reached a great height and the 
fall of the hea^Mer material within it has l)egun. Then, again, it may 
be ask(Hl why it is that every strong ei'uption is not followed l)\' a 
down blast. 

Variations in 'the character of ^•olcani(■ eruptions of the ty]>e under 
consideration occur on account of variations in the eneri-'v of the 



342 VOLCAlNriC eruptions on MARTINIQUE AND ST. VINCENT. 

explosions and the degree to which the ascending steam is debris- 
charged. If the energ}" is great and the upward propelling force 
essentially constant, it may well be inferred that the column, as 
explained bj' Jaggar, will attain a great height before the resistance it 
offers to the ascent of fresh material causes an expan>?ion at the base. 
If, howe^'er, the steam driven out at any stage in an eruption is exces- 
sively loaded with debris, an expansion and overflow at the rim of a 
crater might occur, no matter whether the fall of previously discharged 
material from aloft had begun or not. The essential feature in a down 
blast from a crater seems to be that heavily debris-charged steam 
behaves in many ways like a fluid and will flow down steep gradients 
and acquire great velocity when the slope and other features of the 
surface over which it progresses are favora])le. The gradients on 
the slopes of Mont Pelee and La Souf riere, within the zone of destruc- 
tion in each case, are about l.OOO feet to a mile. and. as seems evident, 
the Anally accepted explanation as to the contrt)lling condition which 
gave direction to the blasts which swept them will include the prin- 
ciple just stated. In this connection it is instructive to note certain 
observations made by Messrs. Andei'son and Flett, conmiissioners sent 
l\y the Iloyal Society of London to study the recent eruptions. On 
the evening of rTidy i) these genthMueii were on a vessel near C4irl)et 
and witnessed an eruption of Mont I^elee. 

''As the darkness deepened, a dull red reflection was seen in the 
trade-wind cloud which covered the mountain summit. This became 
brightcM' and brighter and soon we saw red-liot stones i)rojected from 
the crater, l)owling down the mountain slopes and giving oft" glowing- 
sparks. Suddenly the cloud was brightly illuminated, and the sailors 
cried, 'The mountain bursts!' In an incredif)ly short space of time a 
red-hot avalanche swept down to the sea. We could not see the 
sunnnit owing to the intm'vening veil of cloud; l)ut the Assure and 
the k)wer parts of the mountain were clear, and the glowing cataract 
poured over them right down to the shore of the l)ay. It was dull 
red, with a billowy surface, reminding one of a snow avalancii(\ In 
it there were large stones, which stood out as streaks of bright red, 
tuml)ling down and emitting showers of sparks. In a few miiuites it 
was over. A low, angry growl had burst from the mountain when 
this avalanche was launched from the crater.'' 

The time occupied by the avalanche^ to reach the sea was "possibl}^ 
a couple of minutes. It could not have been much more." * * "' 

"There is no doubt that the eruption we witnessed was a counter- 
part of that which destroyed St. Pierre. * * * The most peculiar 
feature of these eruptions is the avalanche of incandescent sand and 
the great black cloud which accompanies it. The preliminary stages 
of the erui)tion, which may occu])v a few days or oidy a few hours, 
consist of outbursts of steam, ftne dust and stones, and the discharge of 
the crater lakes or torrents of water or nuid. In them there is noth- 
ing unusual, but as soon as the throat of the crater is reached, a mass 
of incandescent lava rises and rolls o\'er the lip of the c-i'ater in the 



VOLCANIC ERUl'TFONS ON MAKTINK^IfE AND ST. VIN(^ENT. 843 

t'oi'iii of ;iii a\ alaiiche of rcd-liot dust. It is a lava Mown to pieces by 
the ex])ansion of the y-as(\s it contains. It rushes down the slopes of 
the hill, carrying- with it a teri'itic blast, which mows down e\'(>rvthin<>- 
in its path. The mixture of dust and gases behaves in many ways 
like a fluid. The exact chemical composition of these o-ases remains 
unsettled. They ap})arently consist principally of steam and sulphurous 
acid." * ■• * 

The account just ([uoted of a typical (lown-l)last from a volcano, 
seen under faxorable conditions by trained ot)ser\ers. is perhaps the 
best evidence on record from which to judo'e of the nature of certain 
phases of several of the recent eruptions. In the instance cited there 
does not seem to ha\'e l)een a lofty column of dust-charg-ed steam 
standing- al)ove the summit of the mountain wdiicli deliected the 
upward 1)last from the vertical conduit of tlu^ volcano, but. owing to 
the density of the mixture of steam ;ind dust driven out, it o\'ertlowed 
the lip of the crater and rolled down tlie mountain side. That is one 
condition, as previously stated, which may bring about a marked vari- 
ation in tli(> nature of an erui)tion, and in fact furnish the chief con- 
trol t)f the secondary phenomena — the density with which the steam 
extruded is charged with solid matter. This condition may obtain 
control even when the explosi\'e violence is not enough to drive the 
dust-ladi'n steam to a great height. The degree' of comminution would 
no dou))t be another factor influencing the result. The tiner the solid 
material was connniimted, the more fluid-like would be th(^ mixture. 

In an eruption like that descri}:)ed al)ove the topogra})hy may exert 
a decided influence. During cnniptions of great, but of not the maxi- 
nuun, intensity the deep notch in the southwest })()rtioii of the rim of 
the active crater of Mont Pelee would give direction to the escaping 
dust-charged steam and determine the course the expanding avalanche 
would take. In the absence of such a notch, as in the case of La Sou- 
friere, the ONcrflow would be radial. A more intense eruption from 
Mont Pelee might also be radial, tlie notch in its riiu failing to influ- 
ence so completely the direction takcMi l)y the greater discharge. This 
is what seems to have occurred during the later eruptions of the vol- 
cano, when Morne Rouge and other \illages were destroyed; but in 
addition, the grow^th of the cone of eruption al)ove the' rim of its 
encircling crater destro3'ed the influence of the vents, and the later 
eruption spread in all directions in the same manner as on St. Vincent. 

3[ud f(ji/:s. — The \'alleys on the lower slopes of both Mont Pelee 
and La Soufriere have, in numerous instances, been filled to a depth of 
40 to 60 or more feet with hot dust and stones. The streams have 
thus been displaced and are striving to regain their right of wa}', but 
as 3'et, owing largely to the washing down of dust, lapilli, etc., from 
bordering slopes, are making but slow progress with thidr work. lu 
many instancies, in fact, the high-grade rills are bi-inging to the main 
drainage channels more debris than the master streams can remove, 



344 VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS ON MARTINIQUE AND ST. VINCENT. 

and the process of valley tilling- continues. Water linding- its Avay into 
these beds of hot debris, as already mentioned, causes steam explo- 
sions, sometimes of such energy as to resemble a primar\" ei'uption 
from one of the main or true craters. These eruptions at times hurl 
larg-e quantities of debris into the stream channels which have been 
partially cleared, thus producing dams and causing small lakes to form. 
These water bodies rise until they overflow the accunudation of loose 
material restraining them, when they are rapidly drained, and floods 
of water heavily charged with debris occur below where the tempo- 
rary dams were formed. The mud flows originating in these and 
other similar ways have been frequent on both Martinique and St. 
Vincent, and have in several instances been referred to as lava flows. 

Ero.von. — Much that is highly instructive centers about the manner 
in which the surface waters are removing the freshly added material 
from the surfaces of Martinique and St. Vincent. Instead of l»eing a 
protection to the surface on which it rests, the fresh debris is in many 
instances of assistance in its more rapid erosion. On steep slopes, and 
even when the surface is nearly level, the rills formed during the 
numerous tro})l('al showers quickly cut through the loose surface mate- 
rial and, aided by the angular particles in suspension, corrade tlu^ soil 
or rocks beneath. The rains, as it seems, are heavier than usual, 
owing to two causes: First, the g-reat amount of water contril)utetl to 
the atmosi)her(> as steam, and, second, the vast amount of dust l)lown 
into the air, each })article of which serves as a center for condensation. 
The process, of fashioning the topography throughout the extensive 
areas from which all vegetation has been removed is greatly acceler- 
ated. This more rapid erosion will, no doul>t, continue until the sur- 
face is again plant-clothed. 

The volcanic eruptions have claimed so nuich iimnediate considera- 
tion from the several geologists and geographers who have visited the 
stricken islands that the indirect geographical changes resulting from 
them have not received the attention they deserve. Not only the pul- 
sating streams of steaming water and their occasional great discharges 
of hot mud demand detailed study, but the way in which tlie undei'- 
mining of l)aidvs of loose debris leads to landslides, the development of 
consequent and subse([uent streams, the manner in which streams 
develop and rapidly pass from youth to old age. etc., deserve to l)e 
carefully recorded. The streams are not only eroding, but depositing. 
Deltas are })eing formed and additions made to the land. The final 
resting places of the fresh debris which fell on the islands will ))e in 
the adjacent sea, where great <iuantities of fragmental volcanic mate- 
rial is being spread out to form stratified tufl's. 

Tlyr/V'.v '/;/ tJie i<ea. — Reports have appeared in the newspapers, from 
time to time since earl}^ in Ma}', of so-called tidal waves. As is well 
known, the waves referred to have no connection wdth the tides, 



VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS ON MARTINIQUE AND ST. VINCENT. ^-545 

but are .similar to those occasioually ticcompanyinj^' earth(iiiake.s. So 
far as can l)e judged, however, the unusual waves that have recently 
broken on the shores of Martinique^ and St. Vincent have not ])een due 
to movements in the earth's crust, sui'h as commonly produce earth- 
quakes, although some of them may have been of that nature. The 
waves refei'red to have been caused, in most instances, by the distur!)- 
ances produced in the water of the sea l)v the l)lasts of dust-laden 
steam that have swept down from the craters of Mont Pelee and La 
Soufriere. Similar waves ha\-e also ])een generated h.y the entrance 
into the sea of stupendous nuid Hows, or, perhaps more properly, 
avalanches of rock debris and water, like the one which destroyed the 
Guerin sugar factory on May 5. Again, landslides lia\'e occurred in 
the loose dejiosits on the Caribbean shores of both Martini([ue and St. 
Vincent, and similar slides, as indicated by the ))reaking of telegraph 
cables, have probably taken place on the steep submerged slopes of the 
mountains whose sununits form the islands mentioned. In these several 
ways waves in the sea appear to have been generated, ])ut in all instances 
they have been low and but little damage from them has resulted. 
The earthquake shocks that accompanied (he recent ei-uj)ti()ns have 
been comparatividy light, and, so far as can be judged, not of such a 
nature as to cause large; waves in the adjacent sea. The earthcjuake 
shocks, however, may and probably did ])ring about the descent of 
some of the landslides on the margin of the sea and on the steep sub- 
merged slopes, and in this way are indirectly accountable for some of 
the sea waves. 

La/idslides. — The landslides just referred to occurred principally on 
the west side of St. Vincent, to the north of Chateaulxdair, where 
strips of nearly flat alluvial land, adjacent to the sea, have disapp(>ared, 
leaving fresh blulfs of loose deV)ris some Ho or 40 feet high. It has 
been suggested that this disappearance of land, ajul in one instance 
of the site of a village, was due to moviMuent along a fault — that is, 
the subsidence of the rocks on one side of a deep fracture in the 
earth's crust — Init the evidence does not seem to sustain this hypoth- 
esis. The lands that have disappeared, as shown by the escarpments 
remaining, were composed of unconsolidated de])ris, deposited for the 
most part directly by streams as deltas. This loose matiu-ial, resting 
on the steeply inclined rocks beneath, Avas in a })osition to be easily 
dislodged bj- earthquake shocks, by the rush of nnid avalanches down 
the valley, at the mouths of which the deposits had btM>n made, and by 
the return waves when the sea was disturl)cd by the volcanic Idasts or 
by mud avalanches. The changes made by subsidence of the land are 
not great, and, as several observers have stated, may reasonably be 
accounted for in the manner just referred to. 



346 VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS ON MARTINIQUE AND ST. VINCENT. 

The breaking of telegraph cables a few miles offshore from St. 
Pierre at the time the city was destroyed and during subsequent erup- 
tions of Mont Pelee seems best accounted for on the supposition that 
landslides occurred on the steep sul)merged slopes, similar to those 
observed at the margin of the adjacent land. 

Electrical d I H2}lay^. — The graphic accounts that have been published 
of the recent eruption gi^'e a better idea of the magniiicence of the 
electrical phenomena accompanjdng volcanic explosions than was pre- 
viousl}" attainable. These observations show that an interesting and 
difficidt problem here awaits solution. The most striking phase of 
what is assumed to have been an electrical displa}^ during a primary 
eruption of Mont Pelee on the evening of May 26 is thus described ])y 
George Kennan: 

"The feature of the eruption that made the deepest impression upon 
me was the stellar lightning. The uprush of black smoke, the glow 
over the crater, and the shower of incandescent stones and cinders 
were all phenomena that had been observed and described before, but 
the short, thin streaks of lightning, followed by star-like explosions 
in the volcanic mantle — not only above the crater, but miles away from 
it — were entirely new. The distinctive characteristics of this light- 
ning were the shortness of the streak, the comparatively great size and 
brilliancy of the spark, or light burst, at the end of the streak, and the 
single l)ooming report that followed. Sometimes three or four great 
sparks, connected l)y fiery streaks, would flash together in this way, and 
at other times the stars would burst so far back in the cloud that the 
streaks were invisible and there was only a circular irradiation of 
the vapor. If there was any storm lightning of the ordinary kind 
in the earlier stages of the eruption, it was so much less noticeable 
than the stellar lightning that it escaped my observation, and I am quite 
sure that there was no rolling, reverberating thunder at all until near 
the close of the display, when reddish lightning bolts began to dart 
down on the volcano from the developing stoi-ni cloud over the crater. 
Before that time all, ov nearly all, of the electric discharges had ended 
in stellar ligiit bursts, and all of the thunder had been made up of 
separate and distinct reports, like the thunder of a heaxv and rapid 
caimonade."" 

Supplementing the above account we are fortunate in having an 
instructive picture of a night eruption of Mont Pelee, drawn b}^ 
George Varian (PI. V), in which the appearance of the so-called 
stellar lightning is well shown. 

In reading Kennan's vivid description with the aid of Variants 
equally faithful sketch one can scarcely avoid making the tentative 
suggestion that the streaks of light and brilliant explosions, appar- 
entl}^ resembling the trails and occasional bursting caused by meteoric 
bodies entering the earth's atmosphere, may have been due to intensely 
heated solid projectiles blown out of the volcano and entering the 
oxvgen-charged air.

Other pJit'Doinenti.-^-X tiiuil report on the recent :uul .still continuiiio- 
eruptions of jNIont Pelec and Lti Soufriere must include the evidence 
in ret'orence to the sounds o-enerated, the eartlKpiuke shocks, the areas 
on which dust fell and its relation to the direction and force of air 
currents, gravity waves in the air, intiuence of dust in the air on sun- 
light, and, luost interesting of all, as well as the most novel, the magnetic 
waves generatiHl, which were recorded almost instantaiu^ously at prac- 
tically all the automatically recording magnetic stations of the world. 

TJte xfudy of the eartJi.s interior. — Perhaps the chief lesson taught 
by the recent volcanic eruptions in the Antilles is the meagerness of 
our knowletlge concerning the interior of the earth. In this more 
pointedly perhaps than in related tields is the saying true that ''the 
known is l>ut a small fraction of the unknown.'' In the study of the 
earth's interior, the search for thc^ ultimate causes of volcanic tM-up- 
tions, etc., a visit to an active volcano is most instructive and sug- 
gestive, but such investigations should not end with the cessation of 
the outbreaks. 

The manifestations wdiicli reach the earth's surface and on which 
our judgment as to the condition of its interior nuist l)e cliietiy based 
are movements in the rocks, (earthquakes, escape of heat, magnetic 
changes, etc. While several of the phenomena referred to become 
especially prominent during Nolcanic eruptions, they are not confined 
to such occurrences or to the vicinity of Aolcanic vents, but may be 
studied at all times and at any locality. Among the records which it 
is desiral)le to ol)tain and from which some judgment in reference to 
the condition of the earth's interior may be had are the occurrence of 
earthquakes, tiieir character, direction of motion, location, l)oth geo- 
graphical and vertical, of their centers and all else concerning them, 
and changes in the uiagnetic condition of the earth. Observations in 
these directions are highly desira])le in th(^ vicinity of volcanoes in 
order that they may serve as danger signals, but may yield valual)le 
returns when carried on at a distance from all centers of xolcanic 
disturbance. 

In this connection 1 wish to suggest that the National Geographic 
Society can make a substantial addition to our knowledge of the earth 
by maintaining a magnetic and seismographic observatory. Let a 
start be made by placing in our Hubbard Memorial Building the best 
instruments of the nature just referred to that can l)e had, and extend 
assistance to individuals, colleges, etc., at as many other localities as 
practicable, in estal)lishing similar observatories.

one short space both the scattered records of recent oeoy-raphical his- 
tory and to present to you at the same time illustrations of some tixed 
priiu'iple which in the course of the development of our geographical 
knowledge must govern the progress of it. Last year you heard 
from Dr. Mill ;i most excellent sunuuary of the present phase of that 
devt'lopmeiit in this country. You heard not only of gn^at acti\'ity in 
the wide world of the unex})l()red and unknown, hut of new etforts to 
train up a fresh generation of exph)rers; of new schools springing up 
among us: fresh evidence of the faith that is in us tiiat geographical 
knowledge points the road to conunercial success; happy intimations 
of th(^ existence of a yet higher faith — the faith which Ixdiexcs that 
scientitic knowledge of the world's physiology is worth the getting for 
its own sake, whether it paves the wtiy to golden success or not. 
And now, while I'ecalling the chief geographical events of the year 
that has passed, while counting tiie hmdmarks on the road to a higher 
geographical education. I would also claim your attention for a brief 
space to a few technical problems which beset the l)usiness aspi^ct of 
future procedure, and which, so long as we nrake it our boast that we 
belong to the biggest empire in the world, ought most ciM'tainly to 
attract our earnest attention. 

The unknown woi'ld is growing daily smaller. It is, indeed, nar- 
rowing its area with a I'apidity which is absolutely regretta))le. If

352 THE PROGRESS OF GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE. 

the destinies of the P^ast, 3^)11 will lind it ahiiost impossible to look at 
the well turned out maps of to-day, wondering" where next it may be 
possible to strike a new feature or unfold a new vista to geographical 
enterprise, without something like a sigh. But it is with the world as 
we find it mapped to-day that we have now to do, searching out the 
position of such l)laiik spaces as still exist and considering the best 
means of dealing with the vast area of its half -exploited surface so as 
to obtain the best results for the time and labor spent on completing 
our knowledge of it. 

ANTARCTIC PROSPECTS. 

To the polar regions we naturally turn first, for they form the 
special domain of modern initial exploration. We are very far yet 
from having elucidated the great geographical problems of sea and 
land distribution which lie hidden under the depths of paleocrystal 
ice. We only know, indeed, from inference that at one end of the 
world there exists an unmapped sea and at the other an unmapped 
continent, round the edges of which we are even now feeling our wa}". 
When the Discovery left the New Zealand port of Chalmers on Decem- 
ber 24 last for the South Polar regions, this was the quest which, in 
the modest language of her originator, Sir Clements Markham, lay 
before her: "To determine as far as possible the nature and extent of 
the South Polar lands" and to "conduct a magnetic surve3\'" If we 
look at the unexplored area of these South Polar lands as a whole and 
examine the plan of international geographical campaign which has 
now been directed against them, we shall find, T think, that the pres- 
ent enterprise is 1)y far the most complete and systematic, as it is the 
most scientific, that has j^et been undertaken in the far south. It is 
impossible but that great results should be attained from so complete 
an investment of the unknown continent. 

With the Discorerys investigations, which will he directed to Vic- 
toria Land — the land of the historic volcanoes Erebus and Terroi' — 
from the side of Tasmania and New Zealand, will ln' associated at least 
three otlusr expeditions, all aiming at a hnal solution of the South 
Pole problem. From South America Otto NorchMiskiold's expedi- 
tion has taken the shortest sea route past the South Shetlands to 
Grahams Ijaiul and has ali'eady ])assed a winter amid the ice. From 
South America, again, the Scottish expedition under Bruce will work 
its way past Sandwich Island, skirting the Antarctic Circle, some 
50-' to the east of Nordenskiold, almost on the Greenwich meridian 
and as nearly opposite as possil)le to the I)/',sc(j/'('ry's attack from the 
other side of the pole, while between the two will be the German 
expedition of the (rau-%s, pushing southward about (lie meridian of 
IM)'^ E., a worthy rival in scientitic (MjuipnuMit to our own shi]), the 
Discovery. And there is no bi-anch of scientitic inquiry which will be

advHticcd by tliis international attack on tlic gTcat unknown soutliern 
land of more intsM-ost tlian that which pertains to the history of tiie 
world's o-eot>ra[)hy. Independently of securino- a tirnier outline to the 
vao'ue definition of southern land areas of the present day, it is there 
that we hope to hnd evidences of another distribution of those areas 
in primeval times. Shall we be aide to trace the Pataoonian forma- 
tions, those recent basaltic lavas which overlie trees, beyond that 
point in Grahams Land whei'e we know that they occur ayain, to the 
Australian side of the Southern Pole? Shall we rind that Krebus and 
Terror are ])ut the natural extension of that mai^'niricent array of vol- 
canic cones which overlook the Paciric from the Patayoniaii Andes? 
AVill the Miolania, the i^-reat turtle of Patagonia, not unknown in Aus- 
tralia, complete with his bones another liidv in that chain of many 
evidences that Patagonia and Australia once met across the extreme 
south? You may say this is not geography. I hardly know" whether 
in these days it is still necessary to plead that between geography and 
natural sciences, whether of geology, biology, or anthropology, the 
connection is so intimate that in the actual held of research it is 
impossibh^ to disconnect them. Modern geography is but a develop- 
ment, and while the process of its evolution is perhaps to ))e found in 
strictly geological rields, it has so modiried and influenced the prob 
lems of lif(^ and the distribution of it throughout the world that a col- 
lector of facts like myself rinds it convenient to accept, for the mere 
sake of simplicity, the science of geography as the l)est basis for 
divergent iiKjuiries into many other scientiric rields, which can l)e dif- 
ferentiated at leisure ])v the natural philosopher. 

NECESSITY FOR STUDY OF GEOGRAPHICAL HISTORY. 

But while we are justiried in expecting nuich from this great inter- 
national movement, we nuist still moderate our ex})ectations. AVe 
nuist admit that in the rield of purely naval exploration we hav(^ not 
the same developments in mechanical and instrumental accessories 
which place within our reach the possibility of conducting land expe- 
ditions on far more scientific and exact methods tlian wert^ possible to 
our grandfathers. Wireless telegraphy, for instance, will not yet ena- 
l)l(^ a ship fast bound in arctic ice to determine her longitude, and the 
restless ocean still precludes the use of many of the more rintdy gradu- 
ated instruments which are essential to the exact measurements per- 
taining to triangulation. Methods and instruments, indeed, will not 
differ materially from those adopted b\' Franklin oi' by Ross more than 
half a century ago. Better insti'uments of their class no doubt are 
within I'cach, owing to the extraordinary accuracy of modern pi'oduc- 
tion; but better hands to hold them it would be impossi])le to rind. 
We are often so pleased with ourselves in these days that we art' apt 
to forget what has been done by our geographical forerunners in the

same Held a,s ourselves. 1 hav^c l)ut lately letunied from a journey 
full of oeographieal interest which has carried nio over souk^ of the 
tracks left many years ago hy :i 15ritisli scientific expedition to the 
South Seas, which will l)c ever associated in the memory of all geog- 
raphers with the names of Charles Darwin, and H. M. S. BedgJr. With 
the wider scope for gathering information which is afforded in these 
days by the growth of civilization and the shooting out of its long ten- 
drils into tlie waste i)laces of Patagonia, it has been possible to verity 
some of the suggestions as to the structure and geographical configura- 
tion of that southern continent which were offered })y the observations 
of Darwin, and to examine here and thei'c, in some detail, the results of 
recent local surveys in testing the accuracy of the coast outline and of 
the coast soundings established by the Beiujlv. Of the former I can 
only say that they seem to me prophetic; of the latter, so little change 
has taken place in South American coast configuration during the last 
fifty years that practically the charts of the Beagle arc the charts of 
the Chilian and Argentine admiralties of to-day, with hardly a notice- 
able variation. Such magnificent results as were achieved then are 
hard to beat at any time. We do not hope to beat them. We can 
only hope to imitate them. They stand good for all time, and it is 
useful to recall them now and then in order to emphasize a truism which 
is occasionally overlooked by modern geographical explorers. It is 
not the most recent work in the field of exploration which is necessa- 
rily the most valuable. One of the great sins of omission in modern 
exploration is that of a failure to apjDreciate the efforts of preceding 
geographers in the same field of research as ourselves — the want of a 
patient absorption of all available previous knowledge before we 
attempt to add to the sum of it. We are not all of us gifted with the 
patient determination of that great travcder Sven Hedin, who spent 
three years in reading about central Asia before he wrote a word on 
the subject. It can not be too strongly urged in these days of narrow- 
ing fields for activity that although geographical research is essentially 
an active function of an active life it demands yet more and more, as 
time goes on, the application of the scholar added to the determined 
energy of the explorer. 

FORMATION OF A CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF GEOOKAl'lIICAL ADVISERS. 

It is in this coimectloji that 1 would advance a suggestion which I 
have alread}' heard discussed l)y travelers anxious to apply their ener- 
gies in well-directed efforts toward the aciiuisition of really useful 
scientific information. It concerns the possibility of establishing a 
central geographical committee which should gather together expert 
knowledge in all branches of natural scii^ice, and be prepared to give 
technical advice to travelers and explorers, not only as to the literary 
sources from which the best information may be derived, but also to

fiii'uisli hints as to tli(^ best localitios for reseaivli in tin}' special branch 
of science. This wouhl certainly shoi'ten the preliminarv hihor of 
collectino- information; and in many cases when expeditions are phmned 
at short notice it would be lin'alua])le in indicating- opportunities for 
special research which would otherwise ])e o\'erlooked. It is so much 
more freijuently want of time, rather than want of incliinition, which 
prevents the actjuisition of that preliminary and most essiMitial knowl- 
edge which alone can riyhtly direct the ctibrt to thi; ()})portunity and 
tit tht> two together, that 1 have much sympathy with the pathetic 
appeal of more than one younj;- explorer who has comjjlained that it is 
necessary to travel all around London in order to tind the man (to say 
nothing" of the 1)()ok) who will t(dl you in concise langiiage exactly what 
to look for in the land which you are visiting. 

CONTKACTION OF TIIK WORLD's '"TEKKA INCOCNITA.'' 

It is, however, when wo leave the high seas with their almost inex- 
haustible store of unexplored ocean tloors and icebound coast line, and 
turn from oceanography to the more familiar aspects of land geog- 
raphy that we tind those spaces within which ""pioneer" exploration 
can 1)0 usefully carried to be so rapidly contracting year by year as to 
force upon our attention the necessity for adapting our methods for a 
progressive s^^stem of world-wide map making, not only to the re(|uire- 
ments of al)stract science, but to the utilitarian doujands of commercial 
and political enterprise. 

ASIA. 

Take Asia, for example. Nearly half of the great continent pertains 
to Siberia, and within the limits of Russian territor}^ the admira1)lG 
organization of her own system of geographical exploration leaves no 
room for outsiders to assist usefully, even if political objections did 
not exist. In central and southern Arabia there is undoul)todly still 
much to learn, but of the remaining countries which intervene between 
the Mediterranean and India, of Persia, Afghanistan, and Baluchistan, 
it can only be said that the work of the geographical pioneer has already 
ended where that of the engineer and surveyor has commenced. In 
the Farthest East again — in Manchuria, China, Tonkin, and Siam — there 
is much more room for the practical exploration of the road and rail- 
way maker than there is for the irresponsible career of the geograph- 
ical traveler. The highway from China to India is almost as well 
known as that from London to India, and the activit}^ of railway enter- 
prise in the south of Asia bids fair to rival the triumphs of Sil)eria. 
It is only in the central deserts of Mongolia and the wastes of Tibet 
spreading southward to the Himalayas that we can find untrodden areas 
of any great magnitude, and even in central Asia before venturing on 
a statement of future possibilities in the tield of exploration, it would 



356 THE PROGRESS OF GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE. 

be well to wait for the records of that most intrepid traveler, Sven 
Hedin, who promises us material of scientitic and historical interest 
as the result of his last three years' travel far in excess of the monu- 
mental contri])utions which he has already made public. Historically 
the interest of the world of inquir}^ in Asia where we find the origin 
of the great races of the world and the birthplace of all religions must 
alwa3"s be immense; but that history can only be elucidated by a clear 
illustration of the great highwa3"s of the continent whicli were open 
to the vast migrator}^ movements of mankind in prehistoric periods. 
We do not in the least understand the condition of climate, nor are we 
quite certain even of the relative distribution of land and water in 
high Asia in the days when its swarming population first began to flow 
south and west, carrying the elements of a language which we have 
been accustomed to regard as primeval into the swamps and plains 
which lay beyond the Himalayas or the Caspian. It is onl}^ through 
geographical research that some dim outline of those early stories can 
be realized; and although the researches of Stein and the marvelous 
discoveries of Sven Hedin around the ancient lake district of Lob Nor 
will, after all, only throw the world's history back for a few centuries, it 
is by means of these lirst steps backward that we can feel our way to an 
appreciation of the earlier processes of this phase of human evolution. 
Nor in the interests of utilitarian conunercial speculation is geograpiiical 
research in Asia yet to be set aside. We indeed know comparatively 
nothing of its resources in mineral wealth. It is quite within the 
bounds of possibility that one of the groat central treasure houses of 
nature lie enveloped in the geological axis of the highest mountains of 
the world, and that we may yet be enaV)led to explain why every river 
which flows from Tibet washes down gold in its bed. But this will only 
be when the Tibetan Lama is prepared to shake hands with the Uit- 
lander; and I fear that recent South African history will not encoui'age 
the em))race. Meanwhile there is no more promising field still open to 
the bona fide explorer than that of Tibet and the farthest ranges 
of the Himalayas. Few people are aware how vast an extent of the 
Himalayan area still remains untrodden by any P^uropean. This is 
due to no want of enterprise on the part of our Indian surveyors and 
political officials. It is due partly to physical inaccessibility and partly 
to that intense (and easily understood) objection to the interference of 
the stranger in which many of our transfrontier neighbors permit 
themselves to indulge. Nevertheless would I commend to those who 
still desire to walk in the rough and thorny i)ath of pioneer geograph- 
ical discovery a similar enterprise to that of our aforetime secretary, 
Mr. Douglas Freshfleld, who latel}' succeeded in passing beyond the 
bounds of official exploi'ation into the eastern Himalayas. We have 
had many travelers in the Himalayas, but they have not always dis- 
tinguished between the fascinating pleasuivs of romantic adventure 
and the earnest pursuit of geographical l)usiness. 



THE PROGRESS OF OEOaRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE. 357 

STUDY OF (!r.A(-IEKS. 

To Mr. Fre.shtield wo certainly ow(> :in introduction to a new vista of 
great scientific interest in the study of the formation and niovenients 
of "hu'iers. Here perhaps, we are treading- gently on the skirts of 
geological science; but I have never 3'et found that part of the world 
where the careful study of local geographical conformation will not 
inevitably invoke an inquiry into geological consti'uction. We must 
accept the inevitable criticism and go on with our glaciers. Where in 
the world can there be such an area for research into the conditions of 
glacial formations as is presented ])y the Himalayas^ I grant the 
physical and political difficulties in the way to whicli 1 have referred, 
but still well within the limits of our own red !)order there are glaciers 
yet to be studied, which, if not t\w largest, are yet large enougli to 
satisfy the loftiest aspirations, and beyond that border the dithculties 
of approach are lessening day by day and are no longer so formidable 
that they need hinder the steps of any determined explorer. 

SOUTH AMERICAN GLACIP^RS. 

The speculative interest in glacial movements and their influence on 
the geoo;raphical conformation become far greater when one moves in 
a country which has been recently shaped and polished, grooved, and 
fashioned I )y glacial action; when huge blocks of granite or porphyry, 
standing sentinel over terraces and ancient glacier beds, witness to the 
passing of icebergs in prehistoric seas. Such conditions one may find 
in two widely separated areas, viz, in the Pamirs and In Patagonia. 
What causes led to the formation of the first vast ice cap of which the 
glacier is the latest evidence; what caused its disappearance, its reap- 
pearance; why are the glaciers again withdrawing from the mountains, 
and what causes the universal process of modern desiccation, of which 
there is such ample evidence in the Pamirs, in Baluchistan, in Pata- 
gonia;' It is to the Himalayas that we turn first for an answer to this 
question, but there are other fields almost equally promising, and one 
of them is to be found in South America. No one now can pretend 
any longer that we know nothing of Patagonia. Probably no country 
in the world has been described by so many geographers in so many 
(lifi'erent ways; there, at any rate, is a land of glaciers and snow fields 
awaiting research which presents few of the physical difficulties of the 
Himalayas. Here is a wonderful country truly, wher(^ glaci(us reach 
down to the sea in low latitudes, casting little icebergs into waters 
fringed by green banks of fuchsia and myrtle, and of bam])oo, where 
the laurel grows into magnificent timl)ei', competing with the Patago- 
nian beech for roothold on the moss-covered soil. The round gray 
heads of the granite hills, scratched and seamed ])y a discarded ice cap 
on one side of the narrow straits l)alance the snow-bound peaks of the

Cordilleras on the other. No phj^sical difficulties 1)ar the way to the 
iuvestij^ation of glacial phenomena amidst some of the most striking 
coast scenery in the world. Near the parallel of 51' south are two Pata- 
gonian lakes closely associated — Argentina and Viedma — which offer 
opportunities for the study of glaciers such as are probably not to be 
found an^'where else in the same latitude. For here the phenomenon 
of disappearance is in the stage of natural illustration. Glaciers are 
disappearing rapidly which but a few years ago seemed to be a per- 
manent feature of the surrounding mountains, and the lake surface is 
checkered with their debris. There, too, may be studied for hundreds 
of miles northward the natural sequences of their disappearance — the 
formation of fresh-water lakes and their gradual desiccation in turn — 
whilst all around there is the continued story of geographical evolution 
due to the alternate forces of glacial and volcanic action written in 
gigantic characters on the face of natui'e. 

CENTRAL SOUTH AMERICA. 

Not very much has l)een added of late years to our practical knowl- 
edge of the hiddeii depths of central South America except from the 
inexhaustible mine of information possessed by that eminent geogra- 
pher, Colonel Church. A Brazilian expedition in ISIHJ, the explorations 
of a commission sent to investigate the interior with a view to the 
establishment of new political capital to Brazil in 1892-98, the discov- 
eries of Dr. Ramon Paz in 1891:, and a checkered journey in the val- 
ley of the Orinoco by Stanley Paterson in 1897, form the principal 
records of modern days. There is doubtless much which is of the 
greatest connnercial and political interest still tx^ unravel in connection 
with the geography of the great river l)asins of tiie continent. But in 
South America we are threatened with perhaps the greatest develop- 
ment of what I may call artificial geography that the world has ever 
seen. Not only will the consunnnation of the Panama Canal project 
change the whole system of our Western sea couununications and prol)- 
ably exercise a more enduring effect on the world's conmierce than 
even the Suez coimection between East and West, but the possibilities 
of linking up by a central canal system the three great river biisins of 
the South — that of th(> Orinoco, the Amazon, and the Plata — is under 
serious considei'ation, and t\\o mere project will in itself lead to an 
exhausti\'e (examination of much untravelcd counti'v. Thus, even 
South Am(M-ica no longer offers a large Held for the geographical 
pioneer of the future. With its narrowing areas of terra incognita and 
its almost ])h('n()in(MiaI advance toward a leading position as the pastoral

KOHTH AMERICA. 

In the geographical tields presented ])y North America, as also b}' 
Australia, magnificent as are the opportunities for acquiring that per- 
sonal ac(piaintance with the great depositions of nature which environ 
new conditions of life, and shape the course of human existence to its 
appointed ends; or, in other words, to acquire a geographical educa- 
tion from original sources of instruction, there is but little opening for 
the enterprise of the pioneer who aspires to show the way into new 
fields. There is no lack of native enterprise in colonies peopled by 
the stout-hearted descendants of generations of explor(^rs. Neither 
Canadians nor Australians wait for p]ngland to show them how to 
develop the resources of their own country or pilot the road to new 
ventures. On the contrary, we have to turn to Canada now for instruc- 
tion in the higher art of geographical map making and to admit that 
England has been left far behind in the development of the special 
branch of science which deals with the illustration of the main fea- 
tures of geographical configuration in relation to their geological 
construction. 

AFKICA. 

In Africa the advanct^ of our knowledge of the main outline of the 
geographical features of the continent has l)een so rapid since the days 
when the Nile was first traced to its source l)y Speke that a perfect 
network of explorers' lines of travel now embraces the continent in its 
meshes, and it is only in the intermediate spaces that room for enter- 
prise on the part of the poineer is left, even if it may not be said 
altogether to haxe \aiiished. A reference to the little map })ul)lished 
by Mr. Kavenstein in the Royal Geographical Society Journal for last 
December will show you at once that the hydrcjgraphy of Africa has 
been fairly well traced out in all its main arteries, leaving but few 
unexplored spaces of any great extent, and that such spaces, where 
tlie}^ occur within the area which is especially oj)en to Englishmen, 
demand an organized system of exploration more complete in its 
results, mor(^ carefully balanced in its relation to th(» g(H)gra])hic;il 
illustration of those lands which are l)egiiuiing to form centers of 
ci\ilization than can l)e securc^l by tli(? process of poineer route mak- 
ing. In short, we want a system of geographical sur\(\ving allicnl to 
those systems which Iuiac been perfected after years of careful experi- 
ment by Canada, or Russia, or France, or b}' England in India. This, 
however, l)rlngs us into a field of technical in([uirv of great importance, 
into which, so far as it deals with geogi'aphy — i. e.. with the measure- 
ment of the earth's surface and the illustration of its contiguration l)y 
means of maps, I proposi^ to enter brielly in this ad<lress. 



360 THE PR0C4RESS OF GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE. 

MODEf!N KEQUIREMENTS IN GEO<;ilAPlI10AL MAI' MAKING. 

Yon will ag-ree with me that geography in the aljstract, without 
illustration — the geography which used to he taught ])y geograph}^ 
books without maps — is but a poor and ineffieient l)ranch of academic 
knowledge, hardly worthy even of an infant school. It does not mat- 
ter what branch of this comprehensive science .you approach, whether 
it is historical, or i)hysical, or political, modern or ancient, the oidy 
substantial presentment of the sul)ject to man's understanding is that 
which has recourse to map illustration. Words (especiall}" words 
bearing such indefinite applications as our modern geographical termi- 
nology) can never conve}' to the imagination the same substantial 
illustration as maps conve}^ to the eye. You may think that all this is 
mere truism; so it may be; Imt 1 assure you that what I may call 
descriptive geography — that is to say, geography without the aid of 
maps, has more than once nearly precipitated national disaster in quite 
modern times — disaster quite as perilous as any which in military lields 
has been caused l)y blank, wholeside ignorance of th(^ features of a 
country in which strategic movements are undertaken. There comes 
a time in the history of every developing country wlien tlie increase of 
its people, and the consequent distribution of land, demands surveys 
for the purposes of fiscal adnnnistration. C'onsecjuently such surveys 
are connnon everywhere; and from thesc^ have been built up, piece bv 
piece, like a chikrs puzzle, the ge()gni[)liical maps of many half- 
occupied lands, illustrating only such portions as are adaptable to 
economic development, and leaving blank all that promised to l)e 
unproductive and unprofitai>le. 

FIEED OK (;E0DESY. 

It was only when it was discovered that the sum total of such a pro- 
duction was apt to cause great confusion in land assessment, inasnmch 
as it often did not e([ual the actual area of the land distributed, tliat 
there arose ii school of mathematicians who concerned themselves with 
determining the dimensions and figure of the earth, and founded that 
apparently complicated system of primary miq) making which now 
fakes count of such matters as the cui'vaturc of the earth's surface, the 
con\-ergency of mci'idians, and other spheroidal problems which aft'ect 
th(» construction of iho map. 'i'hus arose '"'geodesy," iind ginxli^sv has 
numbered among its aposth's many of the greatest mathematicians of 
the age. Geodesy, the science which deals with exact measurements, 
was never an embodiment of abstract mathematical investigation. 
It had always a utilitaiian side to it, and if is unfortunate that this 
view of the science has been occasionally lost sight of in late years. 
For we have not done with gi^odetic investigation yet. ]\Iagiuticent as 
are the results obtained by the mathematicians of the past, there are 



THE PROGRESS OF GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE. 861 

still further relinements to l)e introduced into those factors which we 
dail}' use for the reduction of our terrestial observations ere we obtain 
perfect mathematical exactness (if we ever attain it) in our results; 
and we still must look to the processes of geodesy to gi\'e us that back- 
bone, that main axis of indi,sputal)le values from which our network of 
trianoulations may spread durino- the tirst steps in ocog-raphical map 
making-. To a certain extent geodes>' is the support of technical 
geography, and a short inquiry into its present conditions of existence 
ma}" not be out of place. 

It is to North America that we must now turn for instruction in the 
latest development of the science, and to South Africa that we nmst 
look for its future application. Russia has not lost sight of the 
necessity imposed on her for an extension of her magniticent Europeon 
geodetic system through the vast l)readth of her Asiatic possessions, 
but we ourselves in India are concerned nowadays rather with scientific 
observations on collateral lines, and with the collating and perfecting 
of the results attained by the great achievements of past 3'ears, than 
with any developments in fresh fields of geodetic triangulation. 
Germany and France, ever alert where colonial interests are concerned, 
are busy in Africa, but I am not prepared to say how far their geo- 
graphical efforts are based on the strict principles of geodesy. 

In North America, along the meridian of 1)8 through Texas, 
Kansas, and Nebraska, geodetic triangulation still forms one of the 
most prominent schemes of modern work undertaken ])y the Coast and 
Geodetic Survey, and in South Africa thei'e is growing northward 
into the Transvaal slowly, but we hope surely, the framework of a 
gigantic arc which one day will be extended by Sir David Gill from 
the Cape to Cairo. 

I am anxious to impress on you that the science of geodesy is not a 
science of the past. It is still active, and with all its refinements of 
minute accuracy and exact precision in ol)servation and in calculation 
it shoidd be the initial mainstay, and it must be the final court of 
appeal, as it were, for all those less rigorously conducted surveys of 
the reconnaissance and exploration class which we term geographical. 

But this accurate framework, this rigorously exact line of i)recise 
values which ultimately becomes the l)ackbone of an otherwise inverte- 
brate survey anatomy, is painfully slow in its progress, and it is 
usually haunted by the bogey of finance. It does not appeal to the 
imagination like an Antarctic expedition, although it may lead to far 
more solid results, and it generally has to sue in forma pauperis to 
government for its support. 



362 THE PEOGEESS OP GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE. 

(4EOGKArniCAL SURVEYS. 

And thus it happens that long- before the tedious and expensive 
processes which are involved in the term o-eodetic trian^ulation can 
possibly be carried to an eftective end the cry goes up for a geograph- 
ical survey. It is wanted by the administrator to whom it is all 
important that he should know the roads and river communications, 
and tlie productive areas of the land he has to administer, and be able 
to locate the various tribal sections or peoples with whom he has to 
deal. In the political department a geographical map may l)e said to 
])e al)s()lutely necessary for the political purpose of defining limits and 
boundaries. It has been, I am aware, occasionally dispensed with, 
but never with satisfactory results. To the officer on whom rests the 
responsilnlity of preserving peace and good order it i-; most desir- 
able that the ndlitar}' features should be fairly represented in such 
a manner that at least a genei'al plan of action can l)e arranged at 
short notice. For the economic development of the country it can not 
be too strongly urged that a general geographical outline of its surface 
is indispensable to the selection of lines for special technical examina- 
tion, whether for roads, railways, canals, or telegriiphs. How often 
lately in the history of our colonial or frontier progress have vast 
suras been expended on special lines of railway in ignorance of the 
fact that better alignments of infinitely less physical difficulty would 
have been at once revealed Ijy a general geographical map even on the 
smallest scale? In short, the cheapest, the quickest, the surest, indeed 
the only satisfactory method of regulating the progression of public 
works, the development of commerce, the proper recognition of the 
frontier boundaries, the administration of justice, and the military 
control t)f a large and growing colony, or of a long stretch of military 
frontier, is to be armed with a perfect sunmiary of what that country 
contains in the shape of a geographical map; and yet it is only ((uite 
lately that this fact has been recognized by English administrators and 
English generals in their dealings with new colonies and new fi'onticrs. 
Russia learned the lesson a generation ago at least. When she reached 
out a hand for Constantinople her aimy was accompanied across the 
Balkans by whole com})anies of surveyors, who worked on no sketchy 
system of indicating lines of route Ium-c and there. They pushed at 
least seven series of ti'iangidation across the mountains, and on that as 
a basis they mai)ped th(> whole country in detail on a good military 
scale (al)out an inch ])cr nnh^) right up to the \(M-y gates of the 'I'tiik- 
ish cai)ital. For years her ])rigad(^. of topogiaphers has ht>en busy 
along hei- Afghan and Siberian frontiers. In Persia, Baluchistan, the 
Pamirs, and China. wher(>ver in fact there may be in the future some 
prospective view of a closer political, conunercial. or nuiitaiy interest 
than exists at ])resent, therc^ they aiv to !)(> fouiuL France^ has always 
been strong in the geogra))hical tield. and the late achievements of 



THE PROGKESS OF WEOGRAPHTCAL KNOWLEDGE. 863 

Frenchmen in the world of exploration and of exploratory map- 
making are only equaled by the seientitic knowledge and literary abil- 
ity displayed in their technical literature on the sul)ject. Colonel 
Lairssedat's contribution to the History of Topograph}' is to b(^ reck- 
oned with as a standard work. In C-anada and North America ^vo have 
perhaps a practical exposition of the art of oeographical surveying 
which is as unequaled in completeness and compreliensiveness as the 
country with which it has to deal is luiecpialed as a subject for its 
application. There the close association between geological structure 
and geographical conformation is so fully recognized that the same 
technical process of surveying is applied for the ])urp()se of the double 
illustration. The Canadian geological survey is their geographical 
survey, and I think that it is t(^ Canada (if not to India) that wt^ ow(» 
the first recognition of th(^ fact that geographical sur\'eying is a sepa- 
rate, distinct, and most important branch of the general art, which 
should form the basis — the mother survey as it were — from which all 
other surveys should spring. In India 1 am hap])v to think that this 
advance in the science of geography is now wcdl understood. It has 
been more or less forced on us l)y the necessity for such rapid and 
comprehensive surveys as are recpiired for frontier military operations, 
for the purposes of boundary demarcation, and for the important duty 
of keeping our own transfrontier information up to the level of that 
of our neigh))()rs. In our African colonies it has, alas, been discov- 
erinl a little too late thiit geographical surveys are a sound preliminary 
to ndlitary operations; l)ut the discovery once made it is not likely to 
be overlooked. Here, indeed, was presented a most forcible illustra- 
tion of the danger of building up a geographical puzzle map; of piling- 
one on to another the results of local tiscal surveys in the hope that 
when they were all put together they might make a good topograph- 
ical guide to the country. Needless to say the result was disastrous 
from the scientific point of view, and it might almost l)e said of it that 
it was disastrous from the military point of \ie\v as well. Imagine 
for an instant that the Canadian system of a geological survey (involv- 
ing of course accurate topography) had been applied ab initio to South 
xVl'rica, who can possibly say what the result might not have been by 
this time^ The expansion of the Randt mines, foi' example, depends 
at present on local experiment carri(Hl out no doubt by most al>le engi- 
n('(>rs with ail the knowl(>dge of scientific miiung that is to be acciuired 
in tiiese days of advanced spiM-ialism. Hut all the same J may be per- 
mitted to suggest that tlunr experimental ventures, their tentative 
borings, are su))ject to a good deal that is almost gu(\sswork for theii- 
application, and that a com[)rehensive, carefully conducted geological 
surv(\y of the whole countiy would ))robal)ly have afforded valual)le 
indications in many unexpected directions. So also as regards schemes 
for local irrigation. Take the northw (\stern part of Cape CV)lony, for

instance, the district known as the Karoo, where the Ijest military map 
existing- at the time of the war did not even pretend to sliow the main 
roads through the country. The stage of development at which that 
part of the colony has arrived in the all-important matter of local irri- 
gation is only worthy of the Dark Ages. It would })e laughed at in 
Persia or Afglianistan. The Arabs of median^al times were experts in 
the art of the conservancy and distribution of water in dry lands com- 
pared to the modern South African (or South American) farmer. 
Now, I do not say that schemes foi merely local irrigation require geo- 
graphical maps to support them. Such schemes onl}' require a little 
entei'prise, a littU^ common sense, and a little capital, but I do say that 
the geographical map would long ago have revealed the opportunity 
for comprehensive schemes, such as exist in India, just as it would 
have pointed out the best alignment for roads and railwaj's, the best 
means for dealing with an enemy who can move 50 miles in a night, 
and who can make, not merel}^ a few square miles, but a whole district 
the theater of his operations. What was wanted (and is still wanted) 
in South Africa is what is wanted in every part of the continent sub- 
ject to British suzerainty. I know that I am but echoing the urgent 
demand which has been made by every connnissioner and governor 
within the limits of that vast area — not for elal)orate or special maps 
for fiscal and revenue purposes, all of which will come in due time — 
but for scientific geograph}^ which shall now take the place of the pre- 
liminary work of pioneer explorers, and deal Avith the country as a 
whole instead of tracing it in outlines and in disjointed parts. In short, 
they require all gaps filled up. They want to know what the country 
contains in the way of forests, of open land suitable for agriculture, 
of desert and swamp, of opportunities for roads and railways, for tele- 
graphs and irrigation, before deciding on the right portion for the 
center of an arterial system of i)ul)lic works which shall pervade in 
natural and orderly sequence, and in due time, every part of the l)ody 
of the country of their administration. Now, this is scientific geog- 
raphy. It is not oi'dnance map making nor anything very nuich like 
it. It is ii comparatively new demand on tlic scicMitific resources of 
England, and those resources are by no means e(|ual to the demand. 
Before considcM-ing resources, however, we nuist look to the scientific 
means to this geographical end. I have alr(Muly referred briefly to the 
subject of geodes}^, and I have told you that what is termed geodetic 
triangulation is a function of high scientific order, demanding not only 
minute and painstakinj>; care on the part of an able stafi' of ol)servers, 
])ut A'(>ry considerable time and very considerable expense to carry it 
to a satisfactory issue. I have also pointed out that inasumch as the 
exact distribution into parts of any large space of the world's area 
must ultimately depend on the exact measurements which are a fiuic- 
tion of onl}^ the highest class of geodetic triangulation, we must look 



THE pr()gkp:ss of geogkaphical knowledge. 365 

finally to oi'odesy to support the framework of our geography and to 
give it its rightful place in the great total of the world's iuapi)ing. 
But the demand for geographical mapping is not satisfied with the 
prouuse of an elaborate basis for the work which has fii'st to be con- 
structed with the expenditure of much time and mon<'y before any- 
thing in the nature of a final map can be produced for purposes of 
administration. The political world, too, can not always sit patiently 
through all the international disagreements, the losses, the unrest, and 
the positive national danger to which an unsettled boundary' gives 
rise, while the geodesist works slowly through the country year after 
year, piling up sheaves of equations and folios of observations. ])ut 
never a square mile of practical topography. As for the military 
department I hardly know what to say. There is the example before 
us of Germans, Russians, French, and Americans, all conducting their 
campaigns with maps in their hands, taking every special means at 
their command in order to acquire such maps before they commence 
operations; while the Boers have fought us to the bitter end with a 
practical knowledge of the country which is even better than maps, 
and which is exactly that class of knowledge which maps are supposed 
to replace or supplement. None of them wait for geodes3^ 

Certainly the attitude of the military department is not one of neu- 
trality. They would like the maps, they are even anxious to get 
them, Init they are not quite certain that they are worth paying for. 
However that ma}^ be, 1 can only express my own conviction that 
geographical mapping will be found to be an urgent necessity in every 
corner of the unmapped world sul»ject to British infiuence. We 
would like to wait for those accurate determinations of geodesy which 
would at once furnish us with the best of all possible means for com- 
mencing a comprehensive geographical survey. But we can nottitt'ord 
to wait, and the great geographical i)roblem of the age is how to 
reverse the natural sequence of scientific procedui'e and to obtain 
maps of the unmapped world which no sul)se([ui'nt geodetic opera- 
tions shall condemn as inaccurate. It is not a (juestion of expediency; 
it has been one of necessity ft>r many years ])ast; and inasnmch as 
necessity is the mother of invention, 1 thiidv that it will tinally be 
conceded that means have been found for insuring sufiicient accuracy 
in geographical work to render it capable of enduring the subsecjuent 
tests of coni[)leted geodetic measurement without dislocation and 
without interference with the general utility of th(» maps, even if 
that accuracy be not scientifically perfect. 

It is not ni}^ intention to bore you with technical (h^tails. I only 
wish to impress upon you that in the field of scientific geography, as 
in other fields, "the old ord(>r changeth." We must work on new 
principles in arder to meet new demands. 



3(36 THE PROGRESS OF OEOGRAPHTC^AL KNOWLEDGE. 

USE OF THE Ti:LE(iKAI'II IN (JEOGKAPHY. 

One ot" the chief mean.s to this end is the tek^gT;ii)h. Ft'w people 
appreciate the important role ^vhieh is played by the telegraph in 
these da3"s in the tield of geography. It was not so very long ago 
that the iirst step toAvard regenerating a natural wilderness, or for 
securing access to new commercial ojx'nings or centers of uncivilized 
population was held to be the construction of roads and railways. 
Moans of physical access was the tirst step toward the development 
of a country which was regarded as unenlightened from the stand- 
point of European civilization. It is so no longer, for the telegraph 
often threads its way through many a di'earv waste of unpeopled 
earth, uncoiling its length for hundreds of miles in advance of any 
railway, or indeed of any road, which can in the ordinary sense of 
the term be described as a constructed road. 1 will give you an illus- 
tration. On the Patagonian pampas not so vcn-y long ago, in the 
midst of a wide wilderness of snow, after losing our way in a blinding 
snowstorm and camping on our tracks for the night, we struck the 
end of the telegraph line which is now being ]:)ushed across Patagonia, 
and which will eventuall}^ connect the Atlantic with the Paciiic. We 
had seen no roads whatever for a great part of the distance we had 
traversed. Our daily procedure was the simple j^rocess of foLowing 
a guide over the illimitable stretches of bush-covered uplands which 
reach down from the eastern foot of the Andes in gentle grades to the 
Atlantic shore; and when we did at last fall in with the great central 
line of transcontinental communication we found it to consist of the 
wheel marks of certain previous wagons which had drifted along that 
way — a sort of road which it was exceedingly easy to lose in the fading- 
light of a stormy winter's day. On this road there was nothing but a 
telegraph end and the tents of a few telegraph officials, and we were 
some 150 miles from our destination on the Atlantic coast. And so it 
happened that after weeks of absence from any means of comnuinica- 
tion with the outside world we were thus suddenly put in possession 
of its very latest news, and the very first message that passed from 
the end of that line into my hands was the message of peace with 
South Africa, signed an hour or two ])reviously. I accepted that 
message as a happy omen for th(> result of our Patagonian mission. 
And thenceforward (thanks to the courtesy of the telegraph chief at 
Buenos Ayres) niglitly as we sat in the snow we read all that was 
important from the London evening ]>ap(M's of that selfsame da}'. 
We were not starving by any means, but had we wanted a loaf of 
bread in that unbroken stretch of snow covertnl bush land Ave certainly 
could not have got it, while here was information lloAving in with a 
daily ease and regularity that 1 greatly missed Avhen once again i Avas

ill the field ot" f^coo-rapliy, iiowexor. is not contincd to the transfer 
of news to easuiil travelers. It is the faeility whieli it plaees in the 
hands of the geoo"ra})her for deterniininu- his position in lono-itudc that 
renders it so important a factor in the proseention of a y'eoo-raphical 
sui'vev. Everyone knows that tlu> tirst duty of a o-eooraplier is to 
diseover his latitude and his longitude. Hitherto the deterinination 
of the tirst has been a matter of no o-reat uncertainty, but as reg-ards 
the latter one can only say that the contidcncc expressed by most 
explorers in the results of their observations has nexer l)een justitied 
by the tinal verdict of a su1)se([uent determination. It is, in truth, 
most difficult even for the most practiced observer to ol)taiii an abso- 
lute \alue in lon^•itud(^ on which he can rely within such limits of 
accunicy as are essential to the construction of a ma]) where these 
values have to be employed diU'erentially. The telegraph places in 
our hands the means of ditierential determinations within a decree of 
exactness that surpasses even that of the most careful determination 
of latitude: and the telegraph is everywhere. Supplementary to the 
facilities of time sig-naliug- by telegraph is the wonderful accuracy of 
graduation introduced into the smaller classes of new instruments 
which in these davs rei)lace the cumbersome eiiuipment of the past. 
A\'ith a small O-inch theodolite fitted wdth a complete vertical circle, 
time values can ])e determined within a fraction of a second and lati- 
tude values to within two seconds of arc, always provided that that 
great bugbear of the astronomical geographer, level deflection, does 
not interfere with his results. But the same minute accuracy in 
graduation which has so improved the ordinary little instruments 
which you find in the hands of the professional g-cographer has, when 
combined with new methods for accurate linear measurement, also 
placed it in his power to carry out a fairly coheivnt and systematic 
triangulation with great rapidity and accuracy over large areas of 
country whenever the configuration and characteristics of that coun- 
try are favorable. Usually they are favorable, Large ex})anses of 
flat desert, of undulating ^■eldt, or of unbroken forest are the excep- 
tion, not the rule, and they must of course be dealt with as their 
special peculiarities demand; and for the normal conditions of land 
configuration, given that tli(^ explorer is specially carc^ful about his 
l)ase measurements and his initial data, he can certainly, with modern 
instruments and the facilities for check given him by the telegraph, 
carry on a rapid and comprehensive geographical survey which will 
fulfill all the conditions required by the administrator, (M-onomist, 
political geographer, or military commander within such limits of 
accuracy as will insure its standing all the sul»se(|ueiit tests that 
geodesy may apply without any apparent map dislocation. And 
practically that is all that is wanted for a first ma[). I have used the 
word " rapidly.'' Few people, even scientific geographers, have really

grasped the full meaning of the term as applied to ,surve3',s on geo- 
graphical scales (i. e., 1:250000, or about -i inches per mile, or less) 
under normal conditions. Such surv^eys can be completed (piite as 
fast as an arm}- can advance in the tield, even granting that the 
advance is continuous. They can even to a certain extent precede 
that advance in face of an enemy. A single triangulator with a staff 
of two or three topographers in a fairly favorable country will l^e 
responsible for an out turn which may l)e counted ])y hundreds of 
square miles per day. The records of both American and Canadian 
surve3^s will prove that the marvelous progress made in the frontiin- 
reconnoissance surveys of India is nothing al)normal or unexpected. 

NECESSITY FOR TRAINING SCHOOLS. 

So far I have spoken a})out the system only, a S3^stem which has 
been nearly perfected by experiments in Canada, Russia, India, and 
elsewhere. Now we have to turn from the work to the workmen. It 
is only lately, quite lately, that England has discovered that such work- 
men are wanted at all. FIac or six years ago there was not a topog- 
rapher nor a topographical school in England. But the demand 
during late years has been insistent and constant, with the result, I 
am glad to say, that efforts have ))een mad(; in various directions to 
start topographical schools, and a distinct change is apparent in our 
methods of instruction at military headcpiarters. No purely technical 
central civil schools, such as exist on the Continent, are to be found 
in England, and the natural result is that at present England possesses 
no finished topographers and not many men who know what is meant 
by a geographical surve3\ In the wilds of Patagonia (which is. I nuist 
premise, a country beset with special climatic difficulties but not 
otherwise one unsuitable to the t()i)()grai)her's art) I met many men of 
great intelligence and exceptional skill who had been gathered from 
various quarters for the purpose of topography. There were Italians, 
Argentines, Germans, French, and Swiss, but not an Englishman 
among them. Russians of the type of my old and unforgotten friend 
Benderski have long been famous for their skill; but, although 
English administrators and soldiers are alike crying out for more and 
better assistance in the active tield of topography, the}' can not get it 
from England. 'I'he establishment of a school of practical geography, 
such as must eventuall}' guarantee the existcMice of a military topo- 
graphical corps, woidd be a mattei- of congratulation deserving to be 
noted as an important step in the advance of tHe geographical educa- 
tion of the country, no less than the school at Oxford which deals more 
directly with civil interests and is rightly most concerned with the 
academic aspects of geographical instruction. Even this, however, is

IM 1()T< )T(n'( )( ; RAPIIY. 

Certain devtdopnients in the practical fi(dd of si-eoo-raphy have lately 
been brought to the test of continued experimental api)lication, and 
the progress of these experiments deserves a passing recoi'd. Nota))ly 
the application of photogra})hy to purposes of geographical illustration 
has received immense impetus from the apparent facility with wliich 
the experimentiil media can be handled. In fa\'or of tlu' hapliazard 
landscape illustrations, with wdiich we are usually deluged by travelers, 
there is little to be said. They are far more frequently illustrations 
of the personal progress of the author than of the general character of 
the country he progi-esst'd through. Neither is there umch more to 
conmiend in photographs designed to reproduce geological or tectonic 
features, glacial contiguration, si)ecial orographical conditions, or the 
like, unless the position of them and the direction of the line of sight 
from the point of view are very clearly indicated on a corresponding 
map. At the l)est they are apt to l»e deceptive for the reason that they 
can but deal with one side of a subject and with only a partial \iew of 
the ])articular feature they re])resent. Everyone knows that an appar- 
ent range, or even a system of ranges, of mountains may be nothing 
but the revetment of a high plateau or ta))ledand, 1)ut the photograph 
of such a mountain system will give no indication of the platt^au beyond 
wdiich can indeed only be determined l)y a surA'ey and proj)erly illus- 
trated by a ma}). I need hardly say that a to})ogra})hical deliiunition 
of ground derived from ol)servations made by the aid of photograi)hy 
demands as much technical skill on the part of the topographer and as 
much systematic application of the use of instruments as any other 
survev. It nuist be a cond)ination of careful ti'iangulation and skillful 
plane tabling precisely us is the product of a topographical survey. 
It demands, if anything, moi'c special training and :i more elaborate 
method of procedure than does oi-dinary survey. So far as the results 
of experiments made over suitable titdds in Canada can teach us, the 
verdict is in favor of the process only undei- certain conditions of light 
and climate when it is desirable to obtain a i-(H'ord of observations in 
as short a space of time as possible, either in high altitudes, when 
passing clouds afford but a fleeting view of the landsc,a|)e, or in low- 
lying districts, wdiere active tribal hostility in the tield or some similar 
condition renders it desirable to curtail oi)erations as nmcli as i)ossible.

370 THE rKOGRp:ss OF gp:(>graphical knowledge. 

Under all other ordinary conditions it is maintained hy Canadian sur- 
veyors that, although both time and l-ahor may l)e saved on the held 
operations, the resulting maj) can never attain the same standard of 
accuracy in detail that distinguishes good topographical illustration of 
the usual variety of natural features. I am, of course, now speaking- 
of geographit-al surveying as an art, not of mere g-eographical exploi- 
tation. In the lattei" case doubtless every traveler who can ''pull the 
string'' in these days can add innncMisely to the personal interest of his 
journeys by his illustrations of them. Hut I would earnestly impress 
upon all travelers that if they desire those illustrations to be of any 
use for geographical com})ilation it is aI)S()lutely necessary to know 
the point from which they were taken and the direction of the \ iew. 

BAROMETRIC RECORDS. 

Once again, too, would 1 warn travelers of the utter uncertainty of 
all classes of barometric; determinations for altitude. Very little has 
been done in recent years toward improving- instruments of the ])aro- 
mctric class, and meteorological science has not yet taught us how to 
deal with the constant variations in air ])ressure produced over local 
areas by changeable weather. There are some countries where l)aro- 
metric records can hardly be regarded as offering a clue e\en to 
differential heights. It can not be too often insisted on that the 
determination of the relative heights of mountain peaks and of the 
local value of refraction by means of the theodolite is as much the 
duty of the triangulato? as is the fixing of those peaks in position for 
the use of the topographer. Fi'om these, again, the altitude of posi- 
tions in the plains can be safely determined by small instruments of 
the clinometer class without resorting to the barometer at all, although 
it may still be necessar^^ to ascertain the value of one initial (or final) 
point Avhich nuist be determined l)y many observations spread over a 
considerable length of time and synchronous with another set of obser- 
vations determined at sea, or some already known, level. This, of 
course, will occur only when a new geographical area is opened up to 
survey at some distance from the sea. 

UNIVERSAL MAlT'INi;. 

It will l)e i'ememl)ered that a scheme was set afloat some years ago 
by Dr. Penck, the eminent (lerman geogra})her, for the mapi)ing of 
the whole world on the seale of one-millionth, which is very nearly 
e(|uivalent to the scale of It) miles to 1 inch. Substantial ])r()gress has 
now be(Mi made in supi)ort of this scIkmuc^ by English map makers, 
especially in India, wh(>re all the traiis])oi-d(M- countries \vhicli ha\'e 
lallen geographically into tlu^ hands of Indian sur\eyors an* now ]>eing 
mapped on this scale. In the commencement of all great colonial 
."urvey schem \s it is much to be hoped that this project for one 
homogeneous and universal map will not be lost sight of.

TKHxMINOLOCn. 

There is yet another subject of world-wide interest to the Li'eograph- 
ical student eipially with the practical y;eo<j;raphor which recpnres 
somethino- of tho erudition of the philolog-ical scholar to be brought 
to bear upon it in order to arrive at a satisfactory issue. 1 refer to 
the su])ject of geoo-raphical tei'minology. It mav seem an easy thing 
to be satisfied with such general definitions as arc involved in the terms 
"range of mountains,'' "coastlines," "main channels," "watersheds,'' 
''slojjes," " affluents," and the like; but when these terms, and terms 
similar to them, are employed in international agreements and treaties, 
carrying with them the nece.ssitv for identifying on tlie face of nature 
the feature which corres})onds to the term employ<Hl, ther(> is always 
to he found room for discussion as to what its exact meaning may l)e; 
for the variations of nature are infinite, and no two features classified 
under the same generic name are alike. AVere 1 to give you examples 
of only a few of the geographical expressions whic)i, carelessly used, 
have led up to serious international disagreements you would, I am 
assured, agree with me that it is liigh time that geogi'aphers all the

deepest from time to time, or is it a lixture among a seore of minor 
channels that shift and changed Perfect definition is, of course, hope- 
less. It is not in the power of man to deal with all the inlinite vari- 
ations of geographical feature and to classif}' them as he would speci- 
mens of botanical origin or of natural histor3^ But we might arrive 
at a much more satisfactor\' dictionary of geographical terms in our 
own language than at present exists, and we might offer that dictionary 
to the geographers of the world at large and say, ""Here we hiive at 
least endeavored to explain our meaning when wo make use of geo- 
graphical expressions. This is what is taught in our schools as the 
best means of translating the general idea into a distinct mental con- 
ception of natural features; and in future when we use these terms 
you will know on the best authorit}- that England can produce what it 
is that we mean by them." Then, possibly, instead of having to turn 
to Germany and France for assistance in expressing ourselves clearly 
when drawing up legal documents dealing with geographical condi- 
tions, we may find the English language become the standard for this 
special class of literature in spite of its verbal poverty. This, at any 
rate, is what is now being attempted by the Geographical Society, 
which spares no effort in order to obtain the best literary assistance in 
its compilation that the country aft'ords. AVe shall soon have a geo- 
graphical dictionar}^, 1 trust, and be able to enter with a little more 
ease and confidence into the field of literary discussion of geograjjli- 
ical subjects. ' 

PltOGKP:8S OF (!EOGKA]'HICAL EDUCATION. 

The progress of geographical education in the covmtry, although it 
is b\' no means so universally appai'ent as might l)e considered desir- 
able, yet sliows encouraging s3'mptoms of vitality in many directions. 

Tlie Civil Scb.ool at Oxford, for inst:uice.conductedl)y ]\lr. ]\Iackinder. 
has already made most successful efforts to produce exj)ert teachers of 
geography. Here, in addition to Kio undergi-aduates attending courses 
during the past year, five students have already won the post-graduate 
diploma gi'anted ])y the university, and it is encouraging to note that 
four out of the live have already obtained distinctively geographical 
work. Others similai'iy ([ualified, if of sulHcient al)ility, would prol)- 
al»ly not have long to wait for oppoi'tunities. In addition to its r(\gu- 
lar university functions, the Oxford school has this year organized a 
sunuuer course of three weeks' study. This has l)een well attended 
by teachei's and instructors from all parts of the country, and even 
from America. 

In London a department of economic geography is in course of 
organization at the School of Economics and Political Science, and 
gcograpln' will become a com[)uls()r}' subject in examinations. Tn the

niiittcr of cxuiiiiiKitioiis \n'o liiuc to chroniclo the issue of u most (excel- 
lent syllabus for the new London matriculation which should ultimately 
have <;'reat influence on the teachino" in many schools. 

Further, the (reoo-raphical Association, a body now of sc\'cral hun- 
dred teachers, has made great progress. It has riM-ently conuncnccMl 
th(e issue of a journal known as the "(Teographical Teacher," one of 
whpse functions appears to l)e the criticism of the cpipstions set in 
various })ul)lic examinations. 

In the University of Cand)ridge the interests of geography are 
doubtless not overlooked, but they are not conspicuouslv in e\i(lence, 
and I have no trustworthy data of tln^ ])r()gress made in their main- 
tenance. 

In military scliools the report of the late connnittec appointc^d to 
consider the education of army officers shows clearly enough that 
among all the necessary subjects for a cadetAs education Avhicli have to 
be cranuned into the exceedingly short course of his military school- 
ing that bi'anch of geography which is em])raced l)y the term "mili- 
tai'v topography"* finds a ^'ery conspicuous place. The short course 
of a military school will never turn out an accomplished geographical 
surveyor; n(n' does it in any way outflank the necessity for a military 
school for professional topogra])hers. But it teaches the young officer 
how maps are made and instructs him in the use of topograj)hical 
sym]»ols. It would be w(dl if it could be pushed a little further — if it 
could teach him how to make use of the maps when th(\v are made — 
for personid experience convinces me that the apathy shown l>y many 
of our foremost generals and leaders on the subject of maps arises 
chiefly from a well-founded doul)t of their own ability to make use of 
them. As for the broader basis of general geograpliical instruction 
wdiich would deal with th(> disti'ibution of im])ortant military posts 
and strategic positions throughout the Empire and teach officers the 
functions of such }K)sitions, either individually or in combination, during 
military or naval o])erations, it is perhaps; l)etter that such a sti-afegic 
aspect of geography should be relegated to a later age, when the aver- 
age intelligence of the cadet has Ixn-ome more fully de\'eloped. 

Taking it for all in all, thei-e ari^ distinct signs of a luoi-e genei'al 
interest and more scholarly standard of thought in the sul)j<'ct of 
geogra]ihy. This is probably due to the efi'orts of a comparati\'ely 
small gn.up of workers at a time of general educational reform, |)ossi- 
bly partly stinudated by the disclosures in connection with the late war. 

The methods of further improvemcMit an^ simple — ])etter tc^achiM-s 
and better examining —and for both it is probable that we must look 
more directly to civil sourc(\s than to the tentative efi'orts of the mili 
tar\- schools. 



THE DISCOVERY OF THE F[^TURE.« 



Bv H. (I. Weli.s. 



It will load into my subject most comoniontly to contrast and 
separate two divergent t\"pe.s of mind, types which are to he distin- 
o'liished chiefly by their attitude toward time, and more particularly 
by the relative iuiportance they attach and the relative amount of 
thought they give to the future of things. 

The tirst of these two types of mind, and it is, I think, the predominant 
type, the type of the majority of living people, is that which seems 
scarcely to think of the future at all, which regards it as a sort of black 
nonexistence upon which the advancing present will presently write 
events. The second type, which is, I think, a more modern and nuich 
less abundant type of mind, thinks constantly and by preference of 
things to come, and of present things mainl}' in relation to the results 
that must arise from them. The former type of mind, when one gets 
it in its purity, is retrospective in hal)it, and it interprets the things of 
the present, and gives value to this and denies it to that, entirely with 
relation to the past. The latter type of mind is constructive in habit, 
it interprets the things of the present and gives value to this or that, 
entirely in relation to things designed or foreseen. While from th;it 
former point of view our life is simply to reap the consequences of the 
past, from this our life is to prepare the future. The former t}' pe one 
might speak of as the legal or submissive type of mind, because the 
business, the practice, and the training of a lawyer dispose him toward 
it; he of all men must most constantly refer to the law made, the right 
established, the precedent set, and most consistently ignore or con- 
demn the thing that is only seeking to establish itself. The latter type 
of mind 1 might for contrast call the legislati\(\ creativ(\ organizing, 
or masterful t^'pe, because it is perpetually attacking and altering the 
established order of things, perpetually falling away fi'om respect for

87r> THE DISCOVERY OF THE FUTURE. 

whiil the past has given u.s. It sees the world as one great workshop, 
and (ho present is no more than material for the future, for the thing 
that is yet destined to be. It is in the active mood of thought, while 
the former is in the passive; it is the mind of youth, it is the mind 
more manifest among the western nations, while the former is the mind 
of age, the mind of the oriental. 

Things have been, says the legal mind, and so 'we are here. And 
the creative mind says we are here because things liave yet to be. 

Now I do not wish to suggest that the great mass of people belong to 
either of these two types. Indeed, I speak of them as two distinct 
and distinguisha])le types mainly for convenience and in order to 
accentuate their distinction. There are probably very few people who 
brood constantly upon the past without any thought of the future at 
all, and there arc pro1)ably scarcely any who live and think consistenth" 
in relation to the future. The great mass of people occupy an inter- 
mediate position between these extremes, they pass daily and hourly 
from the passive mood to the active, they see this thing in relation to 
its associations and that thing in relation to its consequences, and the}' 
do not even suspect that they are using two distinct methods in their 
minds. 

But for all that they are distinct methods, the method of reference 
to the past and the method of reference to the future, and their min- 
gling in many of our minds no more al)olishes their difference than the 
existence of piebald horses proves that white is l)lack. 

I believe that it is not sufficiently recognized just how different in 
their consequences these two methods are, and just where their differ- 
ence and where the failure to appreciate their difference takes one. 
This present time is a period of (juite extraordinary uncertainty and 
indecision upon endless questions — moral questions, a?sthetic questions, 
religious and political questions — upon which we should all of us be 
happiei- to feel assured and settled, and a ^'erv large amount of this 
floating uncertainty al)out these important matters is due to the fact 
that with most of us these two insufficiently distinguished wa3's of 
looking at things are not onl>' present together, but in actual conflict 
in our minds, in unsuspected conflict; we pass from one to the other 
heedlessly without any clear recognition of the fundamental diflerence 
in conclusions that exists between the two, and we do this with disas- 
trous r(\sults to our confldenct^ and to our consistency in dealing with 
all sorts of things. 

But before pointing out how diN-ergent thes(> two types or habits of 
mind really ar(% it is necessary to meet a possibU'. o])jection to what 
has been said. 1 may put that objection in this form: Is not this dis- 
tinction between a type of mind that thinks of the past and of a type 
of mind that thinks of the futur(> a sort ol" hair splitting, almost like 
distinguishing between people* who have hd't hands and [X'ople who

have rinlit? Ev(MTl)()dy holicves tliiit the prcsciit is (Mitiroly dcter- 
iiiiiiMl }»y the })iist you say; hut then everyhody Ix^lieves also tliat the 
present determines th(^ future. Are we simply separatino- and contrast- 
ino' two sides of e\'ervh()dy's opinion ? To whieh one replies that we 
are not diseussing what we know and believe about the relations of 
past, present, and future, or of the relation of cause and eli'ect to each 
other in time. We all know the ])resent depends for its causes on the 
past, and that the future depends for its causes upon the })res(Mit. Hut 
this discussion concerns the way in which we aj)proach thinos upon 
this common o-round of knowledge and belief. We may all know there 
is an east and a W(\st, but if some of us always approach and look at 
things from the west, if some of us always approach and look at things 
from the east, and if others again wander about with a pretty disre- 
gard of direction, looking nt things as chance determines, some of us 
will get to a westward conclusion of this journey, and some of us will 
get to an eastward conclusion, and some of us will get to no detinite 
conclusion at all about all sorts of important matters. And yet those 
who are traveling east, and those who are traveling west, and those 
who are wandering haphazard, may be all upon the same ground of 
belief and statement and amidst'the same assembly of pro^•en facts. 
Precisely the same thing will happen if you always ai)proach things 
from the point of view of their causes, or if vou approach them always 
with a view to their probable etfects. And in several x'cry impoi'tant 
groups of human affairs it is possible to show ((uite clearly just how 
widely apart the two methods, pursued each in its ])urity. take those 
who follow them. 

I suppose that three hundred vears ago all people who thought at 
all about moral ({uestions, about questions of right and wrong, dinluced 
th(>ir rules of conduct absolutely and unreservedly from the past, from 
some dogmatic injunction, some finally settled decr(^e. The great 
mass of people do so to-day. It is written, they say. Thou shalt not 
steal, for example — that is the sole, complete, and suihcient i-cason why 
you should not steal, and even to-day there is a strong aversion to 
admit that there is any relation between the actual conscMiuences of 
acts and the imperatives of i-ight and wrong. Our lives are to rc^ap the 
fruits of determiiiate tilings, and it is still a fundamental presumption 
of the established morality that one nuist do right though the heav<'ns 
fall. But there are people coming into this world who would r(>fuse 
to call it right if it brought the heavens about our heads, however 
authoritativtJ its sources and sanctions, and this new disposition is, I 
t)elieve, a growing one. 1 supi)ose in all ages people in A, timid, hesi- 
tating, guilty way have t(Mnpered the austerity of a dogmatic moral 
code by small infi'actious to secure obxiously Icindly ends, but it was,

moral interpretation of aets 1)y a consideration of their results. To-day 
there are few people \n ho have not more or less clearly discovered the 
future as a more or less important factor in moral considerations. 
To-da}" there is a certain small proportion of people who frankly regard 
morality as a means to an end, as an o\-erridino- of inmiediate and per- 
sonal considerations out of regard to something- to be attained in the 
future, and who break away altogether from the idea of a code dog- 
matically established for ever. Most of us are not so definite as that, 
but most of us are deeply tinged with the spirit of ♦compromise between 
the past and the future; we profess an unbounded allegiance to the 
prescriptions of the past, and we practice a general observance of its 
injunctions, but we (Qualify to a vague, variable extent with considera- 
tions of expediency. We hold, for example, that we must respect our 
promises. But suppose we tind unexpectedly that for oiu^ of us to 
keep a promise, which has l)een sealed and sworn in the most sacred 
fashion, must lead to the great suifei-ing of some other human [)eing, 
must lead, in fact, to practical evWi Would a man do right or wrong 
if he broke such a promise? The practical decision most modern peo- 
ple would mak(^ would ])e to l)reak the promise. Most would say that 
the}' did evil to avoid a greater e\\\. liut suppose it was not such very 
great suffering we were going to inflict, })ut only some sufi'ering? 
And suppose it was a rather important promise? With most of us it 
would then come to be a matter of weighing the promise, the thing of 
the past, against this unexpected bad consequence, the thing of the 
future. And the smaller the overplus of evil consequences the more 
most of us would vacillate. But neither of the two types of mind we 
are contrasting would vacillate at all. The legal type of mind would 
obey the past unhesitatingly, the creative would unhesitatingly sacri- 
fice it to the future. The legal mind would say, "" they who break the 
law at any point break it altogether," while the creative mind would 
say, "let the dead past bury its dead." It is convenient to take my 
illustration from the sphere of promises, l)ut it is in the realm of 
sexual morality that the two methods are most acutely in coiiHict. 

And I would like to suggest that until you have definitely deter- 
mined either to obey the real or imaginary imperatives of the past, or 
to set yourself toward the demands of some ideal of the future, until 
you have made up your mind to adhere to one or otiier of lli('s(> two 
types of mental action in these matters, you are not e\(Mi within hope 
of a sustained consistency in the thought that underlies your acts, that 
in e\-ery issui^ ol' principle that comes upon you, you will be entirely 
at the mei'cy 'of the intellectual mood that happens to be ascendant at 
that particular mouKMit in your mind. 

In the sphere of pul)lic affairs als(^) these two ways of looking at 
things work out into ecpially divergent and incomi)atible conseciuenees. 
The legal mind insists u])on treati(»s, constitutions, legitimacies, ;ind

charters; the legislati\'ie iiicessuntly assails these. ^Vhenever soine 
period of stress sets in, some o-reat eonflict In'tween institutions and 
the forces in things, there conies a sorting between these two types of 
mind. The legal mind becomes gJoi"itied and transrtgured in the form 
of hopek^ss loyalty, the ci'eatix'e mind inspires revolutions and recon- 
structions. And particularly is this ditference of attitude accentuated 
in the disputes that arise out of wars. In most modern wars there is 
no doubt quite traceable on one side or tlui other a, distinct creative 
idea, a distinct regard for some future conse([uence; but the main 
dispute even in most modern wars and the sole dispute in most mediae- 
val w^ars will be found to be a reference, not to the future, but to the 
past; to turn upon a ((uestion of fact and right. The wars of Plan- 
tagenet and Lancastrian England with France, for (>xample, were based 
entirely upon a dummy claim, su})ported by obscure legal arguments, 
upon the crown of France. And ti\o arguments that center about the 
present war in South Africa ignore any ideal of a great united South 
African state almost entirelv, and (|uil)ble this way and that al)()ut 
wdio began the lighting and what was or was not written in some 
obscure revision of a treaty a score of years ago; yet beneath the 
legal issues the ))road creati\'e idea has l)een \'erv apparent in the pub- 
lic mind during this war. It will be found more or less definitely 
fornudated beneath almost all the great wars of the past century, and 
a comparison of the wars of the nineteenth century with the wars of 
the middle ages will show, I think, that in this tield also there has !)een 
a discov(n'y of the future, an increasing disposition to shift the refer- 
ence and values from things accomplished to things to come. 

Yet though fori^sight creeps into our politics and a reference to 
consequence into our morality, it is still the past that dominates our 
lives. But why? Why are we so bound to \t( It is into the future 
we go, to-morrow is the eventful thing for us. There lies all that 
remain's to be felt by us and our children and all those that are dear to 
us. Yet WQ marshal and order men into classes entirely with regard 
to the past, we draw sliame and honor out of the past; against th(» 
rights of property, the vested inter(\sts, the agreements and estal)lish- 
ments of the past the future has no rights. Litcn-atui'e is for tli(> most

political theories, all witness to the binding power of the past upon 
our inincls. Yet we do not serve the past as the Chinese have done. 
There are degrees. We do not worship our ancestors or prescribe a 
rigid local costume; we venture to enlarge our stock of knowledge, 
and we qualify the classics with occasional adventures into original 
thought. Compared with the Chinese we are distinctly aware of the 
future. But compared with wdiat we might l)e the past is all our 
world. 

The reason wh}- the retrospective habit, the legal habit, is so domi- 
nant, and always has been so predominant, is of course a perfectly 
obvious one. We follow the fundamental human principle and take 
what we can get. All people believe the past is certain, dehned, and 
knowable, and only a few people believe that it is possible to know 
anything about the future. Man has acquired the habit of going to 
the past l)ecause it was the line of least resistance for his mind. While 
a certain variable portion of the i)ast is serviceable matter for knowl- 
edge in the case of everyone, the future is, to a mind without an im- 
agination trained in scientific hal)its of thought, nonexistent. All 
our minds are made of memories. In our memories each of us has 
something that without any special training whatever will go back 
into the past and grip firmly and convincingly all sorts of workable 
facts, sometimes more convincingly than firmly. But the imagina- 
tion, uidess it is strengthened by a very sound training in the laws of 
causation, wanders like a lost child in the l>lackness of things to come 
and returns empty. 

Many people believe, therefore, that there can be no sort of cer- 
tainty about the future. You can know no more about the future, I 
was recently assured by a friend, than you can know which wav a kit- 
ten will jump next. And to all who hold that view, who regard the 
future as a ])ei'petual source of convulsive surprises, as an impenetra- 
ble, incural)le. perpetual blackness, it is right and reas()nal)le to derive 
such values as it is necessary to attach to things from the events that 
have certaiidy ha})pened with regard to them. It is our ignoi'ance of 
the future and our persuasion that that ignorance is absolutely incura- 
ble that alone gives the past its enormous predominance in oui' 
thoughts. But through the ages, the long un])roken succession of 
foi'tune tellers — and they flourish still — witness(\s to the [)erpetually 
smoldering feeling that after all there may ho a better sort of knowl- 
(Hlg(» — a more servicealde sort of knowledge than that we now possess. 

On the whole there is sonn^thing sym[)athetic for tin* du))e of the 
fortun(>-teIlei' in tlu^ spii'it of modern science; it is one of the persua- 
sions that come into one's mind, as one assimilates the broad concep- 
tions of science, that the adecjuacy of causation is universal; that in 
absolute fact, if not in that little bubl)le of relative fact, which consti- 
tutes th(^ iiidixidnal life, in al)solut(^ fact the futui'(^ is pist as fixed and 



THE DISCOVERY OF THE FUTURE. 381 

dcteriiiinato, ju.st as settled and iiicvital)le, just as p()ssil)lc a matter of 
kii()wled»i,e as the past. Our personal memory ii"i\ es us an impression 
of the superioi- reality and trustworthiness of things in the past, 
as of things that have finally eommitted themselves and said their say, 
but the more clearly we master the leading conceptions of science the 
better we understand that this impression is one of the results of the 
peculiar conditions of our lives, and not an absolute truth. The man 
of science comes to believe at last that the events of the year A. D. 
4000 are as tixed, settled, and unchangeable as the e\'ents of the year 
1G<I<>. Only al)out the latter he has some material for belief and about 
the former pi'acticaliy none. And the cpiestion arises how far this 
ab^ohdc ignorance of the future is a lixed and necessary condition of 
human life, and how far some application of intellectual methods may 
not attenuate even if it does not absolutely set aside the ^'eil between 
ourselves and things to com(\ And I am venturing to suggest to you 
that along certain lines and with certain (lualilications and limitations 
a working knowledge^ of things in the future is a possible and })racti- 
cable tiling. And in order to support this suggestion I would call 
your attention to certain facts about our knowledge of tiie jjast, and 
more particularly I would insist upon this, that al)out the ])ast our 
range of al)solute certainty is \ery linuted indeed. Al)out the past I 
would suggest we are inclined to ov^erestimate our certainty, just as I 
think we are inclined to underestimate the certainties of the future. 
And such a knowledge of the past as we have is not all of the same 
sort or derived from the same sources. Let us consider just what an 
educated man of to-day knows of the past. First of all he has the 
realest of all kiiowledgc — the knowledge of his own personal expe- 
riences, his memory. Uneducated people believe their memories 
absolutely, and most educated people believe them with a few reserva- 
tions. Some of us take up a critical attitude even toward our own 
memories; we know that they not onl}' sometimes drop things out, but 
that sometimes a sort of dreaming or a strong suggestion will put 
things in. But for all that, memory remains vivid and real as no other 
knowledge can be, and to have seen and heard and felt is to be nearest 
to absolute conviction. Yet our memory of direct impi-essions is only 
the suiallest part of what we know. Outside that bright area conies 
knowledge of adifierent order — the knowledge brought to us by other 
people. Outside our innuediate personal memory there comcvs this 
wider area of facts or (juasi facts told us l)y more or less trustworthy 
people, told us by word of mouth or ])y the written word of living 
and of dead w^riters. This is the past of report, rumor, tradition, and 
history — the second sort of knowledge of the past. The nearer knowl- 
edge of this sort is abundant and clear and detailed, reniotcn* it becomes 
vaguer, still more remotely in time and space it dies down to l>rief, 
imperfect inscriptions and enigmatical traditions, and at last dies away, 



382 THP] DISCOVERY OF THE FUTURP]. 

SO far as the records and traditions of liunitinit}" g-o, into a don)»t and 
darkness as 1)lack, just as l)lack, as futurit}'. And now let nic remind 
you tliat this second zone of knowledge outside the ])rio-ht ai"ca of 
what we have felt and witnessed and handled for ourselves — this zone 
of hearsay and liistory and tradition — completed the whole knowledge 
of tlie past tliat was accessible to Shakespeare, for example. To these 
limits maiTs knowledge of the past Avas absolutely confined save for 
som(> iid<lings and guesses, save for some small, almost negligible 
beginnings, luitil the nineteenth century began. Besides the correct 
knowledge in this scheme of hearsay and history a man had a certain 
amount of legend and error that rounded off the picture in a very satis- 
fying and misleading way, according to liisliop Ussher, just exactly 
400-i years B. C. And that was man's unixersal history — that was his 
all — until the scientific epoch Ijegan. And l)evond those limits — ? 
Widl. I su})i)ose the educated man of the sixteenth century was as cer- 
tain of the nonexistence of anvthing before the creation of the world 
as h(^ was, and as most of us are still, of the practical nonexistence of 
the future, or at any rate he was as satisfied of the impossil)ility of 
knowledge in the one direction as in the other. 

But modiM'ii science, that is to say the rel(Mitless systematic criticism 
of phenomena, has in the past hundred years a])solutely destroyed the 
conce})ti()n of a finitely distant beginning of things; has abolished such 
limits to the past as a dated creation set, and added an enormous vista to 
that limited sixteenth century outlook. And what I would insist upon 
is that this further knowledge is a new kind of knowledge, obtained 
in a new kind of a way. We know to-day. cjuite as confidently and 
in many iesi)ects more intimately than we know Sargon or Zenobia 
or C^aractacus, the form and the hal)its of creatures that no living being- 
has ev(M' juet, thiit no human eye has ever regarded, and the characti^r 
of scenery that no man has ever seen or can ever possibly see; we pic- 
ture to ourselvi^s the lal)yrinth()don raising its clumsy head above the 
waters of the carl)()niferous swamps in which he lived, and Ave figure 
the pterodactyls, those g-reat bird lizards, flapping their way titliwart 
the forests of the Mesozoic age with exactly the same certainty as that 
with which we picture the rhinoceros or the \ ulture. 1 doid)t no more 
about the facts in this further pictui'e tluui 1 do alwut those in the 
nearest. 1 Ixdieve in the megatherium which T have never s(>en as 
confidently as I believe in the hippopotanms that has engulfinl buns 
from my hand. A vast amount of detail in that further picture is now 
fixed and finit(> foi' all time. And a countless number of iin-estigators 
are persistently and confidcMitly enlai'ging, anii)iifying. correcting, and 
])ushitig furtlierand furtluu' luick the boundaries of this greater past — 
this pi'ehuman ])ast — that the sciiMitific criticism of existing phenomena 
has discovered and restored and brought for the first time into the 
world of human thought. We have become possessed of a new and 



THE DISCOVEKY OF THE FUTUKK. 383 

once unsuspected history of the world — of which all the history that 
was known, for example, -to Dr. rTohihson is only the ])v\vi concluding- 
chapter; and even that concludino- chapter has been o-reatly enlarged 
and cori'ected by the exploring archieologists working strictly upon 
the lines of the new niethotl — that is to say, the comparison and criti- 
cism of suggestive facts. 

I want particularlv to insist upon this, that all this outer past- this 
nonhistorical past — is the product of a new and k<'ener habit of 
inquiry, and no sort of revelation. It is simply due to a new and 
more critical way of looking at things. Our knowledge of the geolog- 
ical i)ast, clear and delinite as it has become, is of a different and lower 
order than the knowledge of our memory, and vet of a (piite practica- 
ble and trustworthy order — a know^ledge good enough to go ui)on; 
and if one were to speak of th(^ private memory as the ])crs()nal past, 
as the next wider area of knowledge as the traditional or historical 
past, then one might call all that great and inspiring background of 
remoter geok)gical time the inductive past. 

And tins great discovery of the inductive past was got, by the dis- 
cussion and rediscussion and elective criticism of a number of existing 
facts, odd-shaped lum})s of stone, streaks and bandings in quarries and 
clili's. anatomical and developmental details that had always becMi about 
in the world, that had been lying at the feet of mankind so long as 
mankind had existed, but that no one had ever dreanu^d before could 
supply any information at all, much more reveal such astounding and 
enlightening vistas. Looked at in a new w^ay they became sources of 
dazzling and penetrating light. The remoter past lit up and became 
a picture. Considered as effects, compared and criticised, they yielded 
a clairvoyant vision of the history of interminable years. 

And now, if it has been possible for men by picking out a number 
of suggestive and signiticant looking things in the ])resent, ])v com- 
paring them, criticising them, and discussing them, with a perpetual 
insistence upon wdiy ? without any guiding tradition, and indeed in the 
teeth of estal)lished beliefs, to construct this amazing search light of 
inferenc(> into the remoter past, is it really, after all, such an extrava- 
gant and hopeless thing to suggest that, by seeking for operating- 
causes instead of for fossils, and by criticising them as persistently and 
thoroughly as the geological rcM'ord has b(>en ci'iticised, it may be pos- 
sible to throw a search light of infei-ence forwai'd instead of backward, 
and to attain to a knowledge of coming things as clear, as uni\ersally 
convincing, and inlinitely more im])ortant to mankind than the clear 
vision of the past that geology has opened to us during the inneteenth 
century ( 

Let us grant that anything to correspond witii tiie memory, anything 
having the sam« relation to the future that memory has to the past, is 
out of the (juestion. W(> can not imagine, of course, that we can ever 



384 THE DISCOVERY OF THE FUTURE. 

know liny personal future to correspond with our personal past, or 
any traditional future to correspond with our traditional past; but the 
possibility of an inductive future to correspond with that great induct- 
ive past of geology and archaeology is an altogether different thing. 

I must confess that I believe quite firmly that an inductive knowl- 
edge of a great number of things in the future is becoming a human 
possiliility. I believe that the time is drawing near when it will be 
possible to suggest a systematic exploration of the future. And you 
must not judge the practicabilit}^ of this enterprise by the failures of 
the past. So far nothing has been attempted, so far no first-class 
mind has ever focused itself upon these issues; but suppose the laws of 
social and political development, for example, were giv^en as many 
brains, were given as much attention, criticism, and discussion as we 
have given to the laws of chemical combination during the last fifty 
years, what might we not expect? 

To the popular mind of to-day there is something very difficult in 
such a suggestion, soberly made. But here, in this Institution which 
has watched for a whole century over the splendid adolescence of 
science, and where the spirit of science is surely understood, you will 
know that as a matter of fact prophecy has always been inseparably 
associated with the idea of scientific research. The popular idea of 
scientific investigation is a vehement, aimless collection of little facts, 
collected as the bower bird collects shells and pebbles, in methodical 
little rows, and out of this process, in some manner unknown to the 
popular mind, certain conjuring tricks — the celebrated wonders of 
science — in a sort of accidental way emerge. The popular conception 
of all discovery is accident. But you will know that the essential 
thing in the scientific process is not the collection of facts, but the 
anal3'sis of facts. Facts are the raw material and not the substance of 
science. It is analysis that has given us all ordered knowledge, and 
you know that the aim and the test and the justification of the scientific 
process ts not a marketable conjuring trick, but prophecy. I'util a 
scientific theory yields confident forecasts you know it is unsound and 
tentati^■e; it is mere theorizing, as evanescent as art talk or the phan- 
toms politicians talk about. The splendid body of gravitational 
astronomy, for example, establishes itself upon the certain forecast of 
stellar movements, and 3'ou would absolutely refuse to believe its 
amazing assertions if it were not for these same unerring forecasts. 
The whole body of medical science aims, and cltums the ability, to 
diagnose. Meteorology constantl}' and persistently aims at prophecy, 
and it will never stand in a place of honor until it can certainly fore- 
tell. The chemist forecasts elements l)efore he meets them — it is very 
properly his boast — and the splendid manner in which the mind of 
CU^'k Maxwell reached in front of all experiment and foretold those 
chings that Marconi has materialized is familiar to us all. 



THE DISC()VP]KY OF THE FUTURE. 885 

And if 1 iiiii i'i<^ht in .sining- that .science aims at prophecy, and if the 
specialist in each science is in fact doing" his ]>est now to prophesy 
within the limits of his field, wliat is there to stand in the way of our 
building- up this u-rowing hody of forecast into an ordered picture of 
the future that will be just as certain, just as strictly science, and per- 
haps just as detailed as the })icture that has been built up within the last 
hundred years to make the geological past ^ Well, so far and until 
we bring the prophecy down to the affairs of )nan and his children, it 
is just as possil)le to carry induction forward as back; it is just as sim- 
ple and sure to work out the changing orbit of the earth in the future 
until the tidal drag hauls one unchanging face at last toward the sun 
as it is to work ])ack to its blazing and molten })ast. Tntil man comes 
in, the inductive future is :is real and convincing as the inducti\ e past. 
But inorganic forces are the smaller part and the minor interest in 
this concern. Directly man becomes a factor the nature of the prob- 
lem changes, and our whole present interest centers on the ({uestion 
whether man is, indeed, individually and collectively incalculable, a 
new element which entircdy alters the nature of our iiKpiiry and stamps 
it at once as vain and hopeless, or whether his presence complicates, 
but does not alter, the essential nature of the induction. How far may 
we hope to get trustworthy inductions al)out the future of man^ 

Well, I think, on the whole, we are inclined to underrate our chance 
of certainties in the future, just as I think we are inclined to be too 
credulous about the historical past. The vividness of our personal 
memories, which are the very essence of reality to us, throws a glamor 
of conviction over tradition jind past inductions. But the personal 
future nuist in the very nature of things be hidden from us so long" as 
time endures, and this black ignorance at our very feet — this black 
shadow that corresponds to the l)rightness of our memori«>s b«diind us — 
throws a glamor of uncertainty and unreality over all the future. 
We are continually surprising" ourselves by our own will or want of 
will; the individualities abt)ut us are continually producing the unex- 
pected, and it is very natural to reason that as we can never be pre- 
cisely sure before the time comes what we are g^oing to do and feel, 
and if we can never count with absolute certainty upon the acts and 
happenings e\'en of our most intimate friends, how nuich the more 
impossible is it to anticipate the behavior in any direction of states 
and connnunities;' 

In reply to which I would advance the suggestion that an increase 
in the number of human l)eings considered may positively simplify 
the case instead of complicating it; that as the individuals increase in 
number they begin to average out. Let me illustrate this point b}^ a 
comparison. Angular pit sand has grains of the most varied shapes. 
Examined microscopically, 3^ou will find all sorts of angles and out- 
lines and variations. Before you look you can say of no particular 
SM lOOL^ -lb 



386 THE DISCOVEKY OF THE FUTUKE. 

g-rain wnat its outline will l)c. And if you shoot ii load of such sand 
from a cart you can not foretell with any certainty where any partic- 
ular o-rain will be in th(^ heap that you make; l)ut you can tell — you 
can tell prett}' definitely — the form of the heap as a whole. And fur- 
ther, if you pass that sand through a series of shoots and linall}" drop 
it some distance to the ground, you will be a]>le to foretell that grains 
of a certain sort of form and izt^ will for the most part be found in 
one part of the heap and grains of another sort of form and size will 
l)e found in another part of the heap. In such a case, you see, the 
thing as a whole may be simpler than its component parts, and this I 
submit is also the case in many human affairs. So that because the 
individual future eludes us completeh^ that is no reason why we 
should not aspire to, and discover and use, safe and serviceable gen- 
eralizations upon countless important issues in the human destiny. 

But there is a very grave and impoi'tant-looking difference between 
a load of sand and a multitude of human beings, and this I nuist face 
and examine. Our thoughts and wills and emotions are contagious. 
An exceptional sort of sand grain, a sand grain that was exceptionally 
big and heavy, for example, exerts no influence worth considering 
upon an}" other of the sand, grains in the load. They will fall and roll 
and heap themselves just the same whether that exceptional grain is 
with them or not; l)ut an exceptional man comes into the world, a 
Caesar or a Napoleon or a Peter the Hermit, and he appears to j)er- 
suade and convince and compel and take entire possession of the sand 
heap — I mean the comnmnity — and to twist and alter its destinies to 
an almost unlimited extent. And if this is indeed the case, it reduces 
our project of an inductive knowledge of the future to very small lim- 
its. To hope to foretell the birth and coming of men of exceptional 
force and genius is to hope incredi])ly, and if, indeed, such excep- 
tional men do as nuich as they seem to do in warping the path of 
humanity, our utmost prophetic limit in human ati'airs is a conditional 
sort of })rophecy. If people do so and so, we can sa3% then such and 
such results will follow, and mc nuist admit that that is our limit. 

But everybody does not l)elieve in the importance of the leading 
man. There are those who will say that the whole world is diHerent 
b}' reason of Napoleon. But there are also those who will say the 
whole world of to-day would be very much as it is now if Napoleon 
had ne\(>r been born. There are those who believe entirely in the 
individual man and those who believe entirely in the forces behind the 
indiA'idual man, and for my own part I must confess myself a rather 
extreme case of the latter kind. I umst confess I l)elieve that if \)y 
some juggling with space and time Julius Ca\sar, Napoleon, Edward 
IV, William the C'Oncjueror, Lord Rosebcn-y, and Robert Burns had 
all been changed at biith it would not ha\e produced any serious dis- 
location of the course of destiny. I ))elie\e that these great men of 



THE DISCOVERY OF THE FUTUKE. 887 

our.s arc no more than inuii>"os and synihoLs and instrunuMits taken, as 
it were, haphazard by the ijiccssant and consistent forces behind them; 
they are the pen nibs Fate has used for her writing, the diamonds 
upon the drill that pierces through the rock. And the more one 
inclines to this trust in forces the more one will believe in the pos- 
sibility of a reasoned inductive view of the future that will .serve 
us iji yjolitics, in morals, in social contrivances, and in a thousand 
spacious wa3^s. And even those who take the most extreme and per- 
sonal and melodramatic view of the ways of human destiny, who see 
life as a tissue of fair}^ godmother births and accidental meetings and 
promises and jealousies, will, I suppose, admit there comes a limit to 
these things — that at last personality dies away and the greater forces 
come to their own. The great man, however great he l)e, can not set 
Inick the whole scheme of things; what he docs in right and reason 
will remain and what he does against the greater crcatiN'e forces will 
perish. We can not foresee him; let us grant that. His personal 
difference, the splendor of his effect, his dramatic arrangement of 
events will be his own — in other words, we can not estimate for acci- 
dents and accelerations and delays — 1)ut if only we throw our web of 
generalization wide enough, if only we spin our rope of induction 
strong enough, the final result of the great man, his ultimate sur\'i\ing 
consequences, will come within our net. 

Such, then, is the sort of knowdedge of the future that 1 belie^'e is 
attainable and worth attaining. I believe that the deli))erate direc- 
tion of historical study and of econoiuic and social studj' toward the 
future, and an increasing reference, a deliberate and courageous ref- 
erence, to the future in moral and religious discussion, would ])c enor- 
mously stimulating and enormously profitable to our intellectual life. 
I have done my best to suggest to you that such an enterprise is now 
a serious and practicable undertaking. But at the risk of repetition 
I would call your attention to the essential difference that nuist always 
hold between our attainable knowledge of the future and our existing 
knowledge of the past. The portion of the past that is l)rightest and 
most real to each of us is the individual past — the personal memor3\ 
The portion of the future that must remain darkest and least acces- 
sible is the individual future. Scientific piophecy will not be fortune 
telling, whatever else it may l)e. Those excellent people who cast 
horoscopes, those illegal fashionable palm-reading ladies who abound 
so much to-day, in Avhom nobody is so foolish as to ])elie\e, and to 
whom everybody is foolish enough to go, need fear no competition 
from the scientific prophets. The knowledge of the future we umy 
hope to gain will be general and not individual; it will Ik^ no sort of 
knowdedge that will either hampei- us in the exercise of our individual 
free will or relieve us of our personal responsibility. 

And now, how far is it possible at the present time to. speculate on 



388 THE DISCOVERY OF THE FUTURE. 

the particular outline the future will assume when it is investigated in 
this way ^ 

It is interesting, before we answer that (question, to take into account 
the speculations of a certain sect and culture of people who alread}^ 
before the middle of last century, had set their faces toward the 
future as the justifying explanation of the present. These were the 
positivists, whose position is still most eloquently maintained and dis- 
played b}^ Mr. Frederic Harrison, in spite of the great expansion of 
the human outlook that has occurred since Comte. If you read Mr. 
Harrison, and if you are also, as I presume your presence here indi- 
cates, saturated with that new wine of more spacious knowledge that 
has been given the world during the last fifty years, you will have 
been greatly impressed by the peculiar limitations of the positivist 
conception of the future. So far as I can gather, Comte was, for all 
practical purposes, totally ignorant of that remoter past outside the 
past that is known to us by histor}", or if he was not totally ignorant 
of its existence, he w^as, and conscientiously remained, ignorant of its 
relevanc}^ to the history of humanity. In the narrow and limited past 
he recognized men had always been like the men of to-day; in the 
future he could not imagine that they would be anything more than 
men like the men of to-day. He perceived, as we all perceive, that 
the old social order Avas breaking up, and after a richly suggestive and 
incomplete analysis of the forces that were breaking it up he set him- 
self to plan a new static social order to replace it. If you will read 
Comte, or, what is much easier and pleasanter, if 3'ou will read Mr. 
Frederic Harrison, you. w411 iind this conception constantly apparent — 
that there was once a stable condition of society with humanity, so to 
speak, sitting down in an orderly and respectable manner; that 
humanity has been stirred up and is on the move, and that finally it 
will sit down again on a higher plane, and for good and all, cultured 
and happy, in the reorganized positivist state. And since he could 
see nothing beyond man in the future, there, in that milleimial fashion, 
Comte had to end. Since he could imagine nothing higher than man, 
he had to assert that humanity, and particularly the future of humanity, 
was the highest of all conceivable things. 

All that was perfect!}^ comprehensible in a thinker of the first half of 
the nineteenth century. But we of the earl}'^ twentieth, and particu- 
larly that growing majority of us who have been born since the 
Origin of Species was written, have no excuse for any such limited 
vision. Our imaginations have been trained upon a past in which the 
past that Comte knew is scarcely more than the concluding moment. 
We perceive that man, and all the world of men, is no more than the 
present phase of a development so great and splendid that beside this 
vision epics jingle like nursery rhymes, and all the exploits of hinnanity 
shrivel to the propoi-tion of castles in the sand. We look back through 



THE DISCOVERY OF THE FUTURE. 389 

countless millions of years and see the jj;reat will to livestruoolini.- out 
of the intei'tidal slime, struggling from shape to shape and from power 
to power, crawling and then walking contidcntly ujion the land, strug- 
gling generation after generation to master the air. creeping down 
into the darkness of the deep; we see it turn u[)on itself in rage and 
hunger and reshape itself anew; we watch it draw nearer and more 
akin to us, expanding, elaborating itself, pursuing its relentless, incon- 
ceivable purpose, until at last it reaches us and its being l)eats thi'ough 
our brains and arteries, throbs and thunders in our battle shi})s. roars 
through our cities, sings in our music, and iiowers in our art. And 
when, from that retrospect, we turn again toward the futur(\ surely 
any thought of linality, an}" millennial settlement of cultured peisons, 
has vanished from our minds. 

This fact that man is not final is the great unmanageal)le. distui-hing 
fact that rises upon us in the scientific discov(MT of the future, and to 
my mind, at any rate, the question what is to come after man is the 
most persistently fascinating and the most insoluble (|uestion in the 
whole w^orld. 

Of course we have no answei'. Such imaginations as wo have refuse 
to rise to the task. 

But for the nearer future, while man is still man, there are a few 
general statements that seem to grow more certain. It seems to be 
pretty generally believed to-day that our dense populations are in the 
opening phase of a process of diffusion and aeration. It seems pretty 
inevital)le also that at least the mass of white population in the world 
will be forced some way up the scale of education and personal (efficiency 
in the next two or three decades. It is not difficult to collect reasons 
for supposing — and such reasons have been collected — that in the near 
future, in a couple of hundred years, as one rash optimist has written, 
or in a thousand or so, humanity will ])e detinitely and consciously 
organizing itself as a great world state — a great world state that will 
purge from itself much that is mean, nmch that is bestial, and much 
that makes for individual dullness and dreariness, grayness and 
wretchedness in the world of to-day; and although ^\'o know that 
there is nothing linal in that world state, although we see it oidy as 
something to l>e reached and passed, although we iU'c sure there will 
be no such sitting down to restore and ixM'fect a culture as the posi- 
tivists foretell, yet few people can persuade themselves to see anything 
beyond that except in the vaguest and more genei-al t(>rms. That 
world state of more efficient, more vivid, beautiful, and eventful people 
is, so to speak, on the brow of the hill, and we can not see over, though 
some of us can imagine great uplands l)eyond and something, something 
that glitters elusively, taking first onc^ form and then another, through 
the haz(\ We cxm see no detail, we can see nothing detinable, and it 
is simply, 1 know, the sanguine necessity of our minds that makes us

believe those uplands of the future are still more f^raeious and splendid 
than we can either hope or imagine. But of things that ean be demon- 
strated we have none. 

Yet 1 suppose most of us entertain eertain necessary persuasions, 
without which a moral life in this world is neither a reasonable nor a 
possible thing. All this paper is built finally upon certain negative 
beliefs that are incapable of scientific establishment. Our lives and 
powers are limited, our scope in space and time is limited, and it is 
not unreasonable that for fundamental beliefs we must go outside the 
sphere of reason and set our feet upon faith. Implicit in all such 
speculations as this, is a very definite and quite arbitrary belief, and 
that l)elief is that neither humanit}^ nor in truth any individual human 
being- is living its life in vain. And it is entirely l)y an act of faith 
that we must rule out of our forecasts certain possibilities, certain 
things that one may considei' improbable and against the chances, l)ut 
that no one upon scientific grounds can call impossible. One must 
admit that it is impossible to show why certain things should not 
utterly destroy and end the entire human race and stor}^, why night 
should not presently come down and make all our dreams and 
efforts vain. It is conceivable, for example, that some great unex- 
pected mass of matter should presently rush upon us out of space, 
whirl sun and planets aside like dead leaves before the breeze, and 
collide w^ith and utterly destroy every spark of life upon this earth. 
So far as positive human knowledge g'oes, this is a conceivaV)ly possible 
thing. There is nothing in science to show why such a thing- should 
not be. It is conceivable, too, that some pestilence may presentl}' 
appear, some new disease, that will destroy, not 10 or 15 or 20 per 
cent of the earths' inhabitants as pestilences have done in the past, but 
100 per cent, and so end our race. iS^o one, speaking from scientific 
grounds alone, can say. That can not be. And no one can dispute 
that some great disease of the atmosphere, some trailing cometary 
poison, some great emanation of vapor from the interior of the earth, 
such as Mr. Shiel has made a brilliant use of in his "Purple Cloud," 
is consistent with every demonstrated fact in the world. There may 
arise new animals to pre}^ upon us l)y land and sea, and there may 
come some drug or a wrecking madness into the minds of men. And 
finally, there is the reasona})le certainty that this sun of ours nuist 
some day radiate itself toward extinction; that, at least, nuist happen; 
it will grow cooler and cooler, and its planets will rotate ever more 
sluggishly until some day this (^arth of ours, tideless and sknv moving', 
will be dead and frozen, and all that has lived upon it will l)e frozen 
out and done with. There surely man nmst end. 'I'lial of all such 
nightmares is the most insistently convincing.

going the profoundest changes themsehes. In the })ast c(Miturv there 
was more change in the conditions of human life than there had been 
in the previous thousand years. A hundred y(>ars ago iinentors and

the imagination. 

Jt is possible to Ixdieve that all the past is ])ut the l)eginning of a

there is no need for us to see, what this world will be like when the

APPARENT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LIVING AND BRUTE BODIES — THE 

TWO KIXCDOMS. 

That there should 1)0 any ossontial similarity between an inanimate 
o))jeet and a living' l)eino- seems at tirst imp()ssil)le. AVhati'eseml)lances 
can be discovered between a stone, a lion, and an oak? A comparison 
of the inert and inmiovable pe])l)le with the animal that bounds and 
the plant that eaidi year extends its foliaye gives an impression of 
strong' contrast. Uetween the organic and the inorganic worlds is an 
apparent ahyss. 

The lirst impressions we receive confirm this \iew; superficial studies 
furnish arguments for it. There is thus created in the mind of the 
child, and later in that of man, a sharply marked distinction l)etween 
the natural objects of the mineral kingdom on the one hand and those 
of the two kingdoms of living beings on the other. 

But a more intimate knowledge tends every day to throw dou))t 
upon the strictness or al)solute character of such distinction. It shows 
that gross or brute matter can no longer be placed on one side and 
living- binngs on the other. Scientists deliberately speak of " tiie life 
of matter," which seems to the uninstructed a contradiction in terms. 
They discover m certain classes of mineral bodies almost all the attri- 
))utes of life. They tind in others fainter, 3-et recognizable, indications 
of an undeniable relationship. 

We propose to pass in review these analogies and resemblances, as 
has already been done in a fairly complete manner by MM. Leo 
Errera, Ch. Ed. (luillaume, L. Bourdeau, Ed. Ciritfon, and others. 
We will take as guides the excellent studies of Rau))er, of Ostwald, 
and of Tanunann upon crystals and crystalline germs, studies which are 
merely a continuation of those oF Pasteur and of Gernez. These 
show that crystallni'e bodies are endowed with the princi[)al attributes 
of living beings — that is to say, with a definite form, an apitude for 
acquiring it, and for reesta])lishing it ])y repairing nmtilations that

may be inflicted upon it; a nutritive increase in size at the expense of 
the mother liipior which constitutes its culture medium; tinall\ , a still 
more incredible property, all the characteristics of reproduction b}'^ 
generation. Other curious facts observed by skillful physicists — 
W. Roberts- Austen, W. Spring, Stead, Osmond, Guillemin, Charpy, 
Ch. Ed. Guillaume — show that the immutability and inunol)ility of 
bodies supposed to l)e the most rigid, such as glass, the metals, steel, 
and brass, are only false appearances. Beneath the surface of the 
metal that seems to us inert there is struggling a swarming population 
of molecules that displace each other, move about, and arrange them- 
selves so as to form dctinite ligures, taking on forms adapted to the 
conditions of the environment. Sometimes it is 3'ears before the}'' 
arrive at a state of ultimate and tinal e(]uilil)rium which is that of 
eternal rest. 

However, in order to understand these facts and their interpreta- 
tion it is necessary to recall the fundamental characteristics of living 
beings. These are precisely the ones which it is believed have been 
found in inanimate matter. 

I. 

UNIVERSAL LIFE— OPINIONS OF THE PHILOSOPHERS AND P0S:TS. 

1. pmMiTivE beliefs: ideas of the foets. 

The teachings of science regarding the analogies l)etween brute 
bodies and living bodies accord with the conceptions of the philoso- 
phers and the fancies of the poets. The ancients conceived that all 
bodies in nature, l)oth living and inert, were the constituent parts of 
a universal organism, the macrocosm, which they compared to the 
human microcosm. They attributed to it a principle of action, the 
jjsyche^ analogous to the vital principle, which directed phenomena, 
and an intelligent principle, the iions^ analogous to the soul, which 
comprehended them. This universal life or this universal soul played 
an important part in their metaphysical system. It was the same 
with the poets. Their tendency has always ])een to animate nature 
for the purpose of l)ringing h(>r into harmony with our thoughts and 
feelings. They seek to discover the life or soul hidden at the bottom 
of things. 

List to the voices. Everything has voice. 

\Vinds, waves, and flames, trees, reeds, and roc-ks rejoice. 

They live, indeed, ea(;h thing instinct with soul. 

After making proper allowance for emotional exaggeration, ought 
we to consider these ideas as the prophetic divination of a truth Avhich 
science is only just beginning to dimly perceived Not at all. As 
Kenan has said, this universal animism, instead of being a product of 
refined reflection, is merely a legacy from the most primitive of men- 
tal processes, a lenmant of conceptions belonging to the childhood of 



THE LIFE OF MATTER. 395 

liuniiiiiity. It rocalLs the time when men conceived external thin^-s 
only in terms of themselves, when they made from each object of 
nature a li\-ino- Ix'ino-. Thus they personitied the sky, tlie earth, the 
sea, the mountain, the rivers, the fountains, and t\m tields. They 
likened to animate voices the murnmr of the forest: 

* * * The <.ak cliidcs and tlic birch 

Is \vhis|)erin<,''. * * * 

AikI the heec'li inuriiuirs. There ;vn> voices low 

Lost in the willow's shiver, slight, half-heard: 

AVhile the lone pine tree moans some mystic word. 

For primitive man, as for th(» poet of all times, ever^'thino- is alive, 
and every voice, every noise, is th(^ expression of the activity of a 
living being- who has feelings similar to our own. The sighing of the 
breeze, th(^ moan of the wave upon the strand, the l)abbling of the 
brook, the roaring of the sea. and the pealing of the thunder are 
nothing loss than sad, joyous, or angry, living voices. 

These imj^ressions were eml)odied in a mythology whose ])l<'asing 
features can not conceal its iniukxjuacy. Then they passed into phi- 
losophy and approached the field of science. Thales believed that all 
bodies in nature were animate and living. Origen considered all the 
stars as actual l)eings. Even Kepler himself endowed with animate 
life all the l)odies of i\ature. He especially attributed to the celestial 
bodies an interior principle of action, which, it may ]>e said in passing, 
is contrary to the law of the inei'tia of matter, which has wrongly been 
ascril)ed to him to the detriment of Galileo. The terrestrial globe 
was, according to him, a great animal, sensitive to astral infbiences, 
frightened at the ap]n-oach of other planets, and manifesting its terror 
by tempests, hurricanes, and earthquakes. The wonderful tlux and 
reflux of the ocean was its breathing. The earth had its blood, its 
perspiration, its excretions; it also had its foods, among which was 
the sea water which it absorbed b}' jiumei'ous channels. It should be 
said that at the end of his life Kepler retracted these vague dreams, 
ascribing them to the influence of J. C Scaliger. He explained that 
by the soul of the celestial bodies he meant nothing but their motive 
force. 

2. OPINION OF THE I'Hir.OSOl'FIERS. 

Transition f pom hrufe f<> lirhuj JxxHrs. — The lowering of tne barrier 
between ])rute bodies and living ))()dies began with those philosophers 
who introduced into the world the gr(»at princii)les of contimiity and 
evolution. 

Thejyritic/jjic ofcoiUiimUij. — Among these Leibnitz should l)e ])laced 
first. According to the doctrine of that illustrious philosopher, as 
interpreted by M. Fouillee, ''there is no inorganic kingdom; onlj^i 
great organic kingdom, of which mineral, vegetalde, and animal forms 
are the various developments. * " "" Continuity exists everywhere 



396 THE LIFE OF MATTER. 

throughout the world, und life, together with organization, also exists 
everywhere. Nothing is dead; life is universal." It results from 
this that there is no interruption or hreak in the sueeession of natural 
phenomena; that ever3^thing develops gradually, and, tinallv, that the 
origin of the organic being must be sought in the inorganic. Life, 
properly so called, has not in fact always existed on the surface of the 
globe. It appeared there at a certain geologic epoch, in a purely 
inorganic medium, ))y reason of favoral)le conditions. The doctrine 
of continuity ol)liges us, however, to admit that it preexisted there 
under some rudimentar}' form. 

The modern philosophers who are imbued with the same principles, 
MM. Fouillee, L. Bourdeau, and A. 8al)atier, expre; s themselves in 
terms like those of Leibnitz. ""Dead matter and living matter are not 
two absolutely different entities, luit represent two forms of the same 
matter, differing only in degree, sometimes Init ver}" little." When 
there is only a question of degree it can not be held that there is an 
opposition. We ought not to take inequalities for contrary attributes, 
renewing here the error that leads the vulgar mind to consider heat 
and cold as objective states qualitatively opposed to each other. 

Contlntilfii hij ii'dnsition. — The reasoning which induces us to remove 
the barrier between the two kingdoms and to consider that minerals 
are ejidowed with a sort of rudimentary life is the same as that which 
obliges us to admit that there is no fundamental difference between 
other natural phenomena. There are transitions between that which 
lives and that which does not, between the animate being and the 
brute body. There are even such transitions between that which 
thinks and that which does not think, between thought and no thought, 
between the conscious and the unconscious. This idea of insensible 
transition, of continuous passage between apparent opposites, raises, 
at first, insurmountable resistance in minds not prepared for it by a 
long comparison of facts. It is slowly realized and at last accepted 
by those who, in the world of things, follow the infinity of gradations 
which natural phenomena present. The principle of continuity comes 
at last to constitute, as one may say, a sort of mental attitude. The 
man of science may, then, be led, like the philosopher, to entertain the 
idea of a rudimiMitary form of life that animates matter. He may, 
like the philosophei', l)e guided by this idea; h(» may attribute a i)riori 
to l)i-ute matter all the really essential (jualities of living beings. liut 
this must )>e on the condition that he must afterwards dcMuonstrate 
these attributed ((ualities by ukmuis of ()})servation and experimenta- 
tion. He UHist show that molecules and atoms, far from being inert 
and dead masses, ai'e in reality active elements, endowed with a sort 
of int'erioi- life, which is manif(>sted ))v all tlie nmtations that are 
oltserN'cd in brute matter: by attractions and repulsions, by move-

and prodiu-ini4' ditl'erent species of chemical compounds. 

Continu/fij }>ij siiiKiiKtftnn. —The idea of summation leads by another 
way to the same result. It is another form of the ])rinciph' of con- 
timiity. A totality of etl'ects, obscure and indistinct in themselves, 
produces a })henomenon apprecial)le, perce})tible. and distinct, seem- 
inji'lv heterot»eneous in its compoiuMits without. ho\ve\er, Ixdno- ,so. 
The manifestations of atomic or molecular activity thus )>ecomc 
manifestations of vital activity. 

This is another conse(|uence of the Leibnitzian doctrine. For, 
according' to that philosophical doctrine, individual consciousness, like 
indi\idual life, is the collective ex}iressioii of a multitude of elementary 
lives or consciousnesses, inappreciable ])ecause of their low degree, 
and the real i)henomenon is found to be the sum, oi* rather the integral, 
of all these insensible ett'ects. The elementary conseiousnesses are 
harmonized, uuitied, integrated in an eti'ect that l)ecomes manifest, in 
the same way as **the noises of waves, not one of which would ))o 
heard if ])y itself, yet, when united together and perceived at the same 
instant, become the resounding voice of ocean." 

Ideas of thr p]i!I()si>2>Ju'i'.s c/.s- to sensihllity mid r(oisci'ou.'</h'.w In hnite 
hodien. — The philosophers have gone still further in the way of analo- 
gies, and have recognized in the play of th<^ forces of brute matter, 
particularly in the play of the chemical forces, a humble rudiment of 
the appetences and tendencies that regulate, in their opinion, the func- 
tional activity of living beings — a trace, as it were, of their sensil)ility. 
The reactions of matter indicate, in their e3a's, the existeuce of a sort 
of hedonic consciousness, that is to say, a consciousness reduced simply 
to apprehension of distinction ))etween \vell-l)eing and its opposite, a 
desire for good and repulsion from harm, which they supi)Ose to be 
the universal principle in the activity of things. This was the opinion 
of Empedocles in anti([uity, it was that of Diderot, of Cabanis, and, in 
general, that of the modern materialistic school, eager to lind, even in 
the most degraded representatives of the inorganic world, the first 
traces of the vitality and intellectual life which blossoms out at the 
top of the li\ing world. 

8imilai' ideas are clearly apparent in the early history of all natural 
sciences. It was this same })rinciple of appetition, or of love and 
repulsion, or hate, that, luider the names of attinity, s(dection, and 
incompatibilit}-, was thought to direct the mutations of bodies at the 
time of the origin of chemistry; when Hoerhaave, for (example, com- 
pared chemical combinations to voluntary and conscious alliances, in 
which the rc^spective elements, drawn together by sympathy, contracted 
appropriate marriagi>s. 



398 THE LIFE OF MATTER. 

Genci'dl pfhtdple of the hoiiuxjciieltij of tlic coiiipJci' diid Its ron.stit- 
ue/its. — The ussimiliition of l)ruto bodies to living bodies, iind of the 
inorganic kiiiodoni to the organic, was, in the mind of these phih)so- 
phers, the natural consequence of positing a priori the principles of 
continuity and evolution. There is, however, a principle underlying 
these principles. 

This principle is not expressed in an explicit manner by the philos- 
ophers; it is not formulated in precise terms, l)ut is more or less 
unconsciously im})lied; it is everywhere applied. It, however, appears 
cleai'ly l)ehind their apparatus of philosophical reasoning. It is the 
affirmation that no arrangement or combination of elements can put 
forth any new activit}^ essentially different from the activities of the 
elements of which it is composed. Man is a living clay, say Diderot 
and Ca})anis, and, on the other hand, he is a thiidving being. As it is 
impossi))le to produce that Avhich thinks from that which does not 
think, the ela}' nmst possess a rudiment of thought. But is there 
not another alternative? Ma}' not the new phenomenon, thought, ])e 
the effect of the arrangement of this clay ? If we exclude this alterna- 
tive we must then consider that arrangement and organization are 
incapable of producing in arranged and organized matter a new prop- 
erty different from that which it presented ])efore such arrangement. 

Living protoplasm, says another, is merely an assemblage of brute 
elements; "these brute elements must, therefore, possess a rudiment 
of life.'' This is the same implied supposition which we have just con- 
sidered; if life is not the basis of each element it can not result from 
their simple assemldage. 

Man and animals ;ire coml)inations of atoms, says M. Le Dantec. It 
is more natural to admit that human consciousness is the result of the 
elementary consciousnesses of the constituent atoms than to consider 
it as resulting from mere construction derived from elements destitute 
of an}^ trace of consciousness. "Life," says Haeckel, " is univei'sal; 
we could not conceive its existence in definite aggregates of matter if 
it did not })elong to their constituent elements."" This time the postu- 
late is almost expressed. 

The reasoning is always the same; there an* e\-en the same words; 
the fundamental hypothesis is the same; only it remains more or less 
unexpressed, more oi' less unperceived. ]t may be stated as follows: 

ArrangenuMit, asseml)lage, construction, and aggregation are pow- 
erless to develop, in a couiphix, anything new, essentially heterogeneous 
to what alrcadj^ exists in the elements. Reciprocally, grouping brings 
out in a complex a property which is the gradual development of an 
analogous property in the elements. It is in this sense that thei-e 
exists a collective soul in crowds, of w hich the manifestations have 
been set forth by M, G. Le Bon. In the same way many sociologists, 
adopting the idea advanced by P. de Lilienfeld in 1805, attribute to

natioiLs a (•(M'taiii foi'iiiaf iiuliyidiiality, f()ll()\vin<4" the type of that pos- 
sessed })V each of their eonstituetil iiieiuhei's. M. Izolet consulers 
society as iui organism, which he calls a " liyperzoarv."" Herhei't 
Spencer lias developed the comparison of the collective or<>anism with 
the individual oroanism, insisting- on its resendjlances and ditt'erences, 
Th. Ribot has dwelt especially on the resemblances. 

The postulate that we have clearly stated here is understood as an 
axiom by many minds. But it is not an axiom. In saying that ther(>. 
is nothinu' in the complex that can not be foinid in the pai'ts they think 
they are expressing a self-evident trutir. they are, in fact, merely stat- 
ing an hypothesis. That arrangement, aggregation, and (•om])licated 
and skillful grouping of elements can produce nothing really new in 
the order of phenomena is an assertion that needs to be \-eritied ineach 
particular case. 

The pruiriph' of (-(till i n ll'lilj^ (I Clj)iSrqilrilCr (if fill Jlfiri (/I IK/.- \A'i US 

a})ply this principle to organized beings. All beings in nature are 
actually ari'angements, aggregates, or groupings of the same unixcrsal 
matter: that is to say, of the same simple cliemical bodies. It results 
from the preceding postulate that their activities can ditfer only in 
degree and form, and not fundamentally. Ilien^ is no essential ditl'er- 
ence of nature between the activities of various categories of beings, 
no heterogeneity, nf) discontinuity. ^Ve may pass from one to another, 
encountering no hiatus or impassable gulf. The law of continuity 
thus appears as a simple conseciuence of the fundamental postulate; 
and so is the law of evolution, for exolution is merely continuity in 
action. 

Such are the origins of the philosophical docti'ine which uiii\crs:ili/.es 
life and extends it to all bodies in nature. 

It may be remarked that this doctrine is not confined to any partic- 
ular school or .sect. Leil)nitz was not at all a materialist, and endowed 
his nuindane elements, his monads, not (ndy with a sort of life, but 
even with a sort of soul. Father Boscowich. though he was a Jesuit 
and a professor in the Colh^ge of Kome, did not deny to his indivisible 
points a species of inferior vitality. St. Thomas, too. the angelical 
doctor, according to M. (Jardair. accorded to inanimate sul)stances 
a certain kind of activity, native inclinations, and a real appetition 
toward certain acts.

There should be two ways of proving the doctrine of the essential 
identity of brute matter and livmg matter — one slowei- and more 
laborious, the other moi'c rapid and decisive. 

Identification (f th<' tiro iiiatteri^, hri'te (iiid li'imig. — The laborious 
method, that whic->h we shall l)e obliged to follow, consists in examin- 
ing attentively the various activities by which life is manifested and

attcinptino' to find more or less erude (.'([uivalents for them in l)i'ute 
bodies or in ecrtain of them. 

Decisive veri/ficatkm — Spontaneous generation. — The rapid and deei- 
sive method, which unhappii3'is beyond our resources, would consist in 
showing' unquestionable, clearly marked life, the superior life, arising- 
from the kind of inferior life that is attributed to matter in general. 
It would only be necessary to completely construct in all its parts, b}" 
a suitable combination of inorganic materials, a single living l;eing, 
even the humblest plant or the most rudimentary animal. This would 
indeed be an irrefutable proof that the germs of all vital activity are 
contained in the molecular activity of brute bodies and that there is 
nothing essential to the latter that is not found in the former. 

L'nluippily this demonstration can not be given. Science furnishes 
no example of it, and we are forced to have recourse to the slow method. 

The question here involved is that of spontaneous g-eneration. It is 
well known that the ancients believed in spontaneous generation even 
for animals high in the scale of organization. According* to Van 
Helmont, mice could be born by some incomprehensible fermentation 
in dirty linen mixed with wheat. Diodorus speaks of animal forms 
which were seen to emerge partly developed from the mud of the Nile. 
Aristotle believed in the spontaneous birth of certain fishes. Rejected 
as to the higher forms of animals, this belief was for a long time held 
with regard to the lower ones, such as bees, which the shepherd of 
Virgil saw coming out from the flanks of the dead bullock; such as 
flies engendered in putrefying meat; such as fruit worms and intestinal 
worms; finally with regard to infusoria and the most rudimentar}^ 
vegetables. The hypothesis of spontaneous generation of the living- 
being at the expense of the materials of the environment has been 
successively driven from one classificatory group to another. The 
histor}^ of the sciences of observation is also a history of the defejits 
of this doctrine. Pasteur gave it the flnishing stroke when he show^ed 
that the simplest micro-organisms obeyed the general law which 
declares that a living being is formed only by filiation; that is to say, 
by the intervention of a preexisting living organism. 

Spontaneous generation was an episode In the Jilstory of t/tr glot>r. — 
Though we have been unable to effect spontaneous generation in the 
present time, it has been put back, by Haeckel, into a more or less dis- 
tant past, to the moment when the cooling- of the globe, the solidifica- 
tion of its crust, and the condensation of aqueous vapor upon its sur- 
face created conditions compatible with the existence of living beings 
similar to those with which we are acquainted. Lord Kelvin has tixed 
these geologic events as occurring from twenty to forty millions of years 
ago. Then circumstances becatne propitious for the appearance of the 
first organisms whence were successively derived those which now 
people the earth and the waters.

Circuiustaiiccs t'jixoriihlc to the iippearaiice of the tii'st Ihmiio-s ii])pai'- 
oiitly occurred on!}' in a far distant past. l)ut the o-roator nunihci' of 
physiolooists admit that if wo knew exactly these circumstances and 
could reproduce them, wo mio-ht also expect to produce their etfect, 
wdiicli would l)e the creation of a livin<>- heinj^-, formed in jill its parts, 
developed from the inorj^-anic kinj^-dom. For ail tiiose who think thus 
the impotence of experimentation at the present time is purely pro- 
viso r}-. It is compai'alde to that of })rimitive men, before the time 
of Prometheus, who not kno\vin>i- how to produce tire, could only get 
it ])y traiismittin*^- it from one to anotlier. It depends upon the insuf- 
ficiency of our knowledti'c and the wcsiknes-^ of our means; it does not 
esta))lish the inherent imj)ossil)ility of accomplishinu- the matter in 
(juestion. 

C 'ont/'(irf/ (>j>u}l(>n — Life <ll(l not or/jj/'iuifc o/i our (jlolx'. — But all l)iolo- 
ji'ists do not share this view. Some, and not the least amono- them, hold 
it to be an establisluMl fact that it is impossibh^ for life to arise from a 
concurrence of inoroanic materials and forces. This was the opinion 
of the eminent l)otanist, Ferdinand C-ohn; of the Saxon physician, H. 
Richter, and of W. Preyer, a physiologist well known from his noted 
researches in biological chemistry. According to these scientists life 
on the surface of the globe can not have })een occasioned l)y redactions 
of brute matter and the forces that continue to dominate it. 

According to F. Cohn and H. Richter life has had no beginning 
on our planet. It was transported to the earth from another world, 
or fr(mi the cosmic environment, under the form of ccjsmic germs, or 
cosmozoans. more or less comparable to the living cells with which we 
are acquainted. They may have made the journey either included in 
meteorites or floating in space in the form of cosmic dust. The doctrine 
in ({uestion has been presented under two forms, thi^ hypothesis of 
meteoric cosmozoans, due to a French writer, the C'ount de Salles- 
Guyon, and that of cosmic i)ansi)ermia, advanced in 1S(!5 and 1872 by 
F. Cohn and II. Richter. 

IIill><>th< fi'ix of tht (•oiiinozodii.'i. — The hypothesis of the cosmozoans, 
li\ing particles, j)rot()plasmic germs emanating from other worlds and 
reaching the earth ])y means of stones falling from the sky, is due to a 
French w riter. Count de Salles-Guyon. It is not so destitute of proba- 
bility as one might at first suppose. Lord Kelvin and Ilelmholtz gave 
it the support of their high authority. Spectrum analysis shows in 
cometary nebula' the four or live lin(>s characteristic of hydrocarl)ons. 
(/osmic matter must then contain compoimds of carl)ou, of the sub- 
stances that are especially typical of organic chemistry. P)esides, car- 
bon and a sort of humus have been found in several meteorites. As 
to the objection that these aerolites are heated while passing through 
our atmosphere, Helmholtz responds that this elevation of temperature

may he (|irite supcrticial and allow micro-organisms to su))sist in their 
interior. But other objeotions retain their force: First, that of M. 
Verworn, who considers the hypothesis of cosmic germs as inconsistent 
with the laws of evolution: then, that of L. P^rrera, who denies that 
the conditions necessary for life can exist in interplanetary bodies. 

IlypofJiesis of cosmic pan><pei'in(a. — Du Bois-Reymond has given the 
name of cosmic 2)(m-^J^<'Tmia to a doctrine \ery similar to the preced- 
ing, fornudated by H. Richter in 1S65, and by F. C'ohn in 1872. 
According to this, the first living germs arrived on our globe mingled 
with the cosmic dust that floats in space and Tails slowly to the sur- 
face of the earth. If they escape by this gentle fall the dangerous 
heating of meteorites, L. Eri'era observes that they must remain ex- 
posed to the action of the luminous rays, which is generally destruc- 
tive of germs. 

Hypothesis of pyrcjzocuis. — W. Preyer was not willing to accept this 
cosmic transmigration of even the most simple living beings, nor to 
bring other worlds into the history of our own. Life, according to 
him, must have subsisted for all time, even when the globe was an 
incandescent mass. But it was not the same life as at present. 
Vitality must have undergone many profound changes in the course 
of ages. The pyrozoans, the first living beings, vulcanians, were 
quite difl^erent from the beings of the present day that are disorgan- 
ized by a slight elevation of temperature. 

This theory of pyrozoans proposed by W. Preyer in 1872 certainly 
seems quite chimerical, and similar to the imaginings of Kepler, yet 
in a certain way it accords with contemporary ideas concerning the 
life of matter. It is related to them l)y the evolution which it implies 
in the materials of the terrestrial globe. 

According to Preyer. primitive life existed in the fire. Being 
igneous masses in fusion the pyrozoans lived after their own manner; 
their vitality, slowly modified, finally took on the form which it pre- 
sents to-day. Yet, in this profound transformation their numl)er has 
not varied, and the total quantity of life in the universe has remained 
the same. 

We recognize here the ideas of Button. These cosmozoans. these 
pyrozoans, have a singular resemblance to the organic molecules of 
'•live matter" of the illustrious naturalist — everywhere distriouted, 
in(lestructil)le, and forming, by their concentration, living structures. 

But it is time to abandon scientific theories and to come to arguments 
based upon facts. 

It is with a spirit quite difterent from that of the poets, the meta- 
physicians, and the more or less philosophical scientists that the sci- 
ence of our days looks at the obscure vitality of inanimate bodies. 
It thinks that there is to be recognized there, in a more or less rudi- 
mentary state, the action of the same factors which operate in living 
beings, the manifestation of the same fundamental properties. 



THE LIFE OF MATTER. 403 

111. 

ORGANIZATION AND CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF LIVING AND 
BRUTE MATTER. 

Enumeration of the principal characters ofliviia/ heings. — The pro- 
gramme which we have just sketched oblig-es us to seek in the brute 
being for the properties of living beings. What, then, are, in fact, 
the characteristics of an authentic, complete, living being? What are 
its fundamental properties? We have enumerated them above as fol- 
lows: A certain chemical composition, which is that of living matter; 
a structure or organization; a specitic form; an evolution which has a 
duration and an end, death; a property of growth or nutrition; a 
property of reproduction. Which of these characters counts for the 
most in the definition of life? If some of them were wanting, w-ould 
that suffice to put liack a lieing, w^ho might possess the others, from the 
animate world to that of minerals? That is precisely the question 
that is under consideration. 

Organization and chemical composition of living heings. — On the 
whole, all that we know concerning the constitution of living matter 
and its organization is contained in the laws of the chemical unity and 
morphologic unity of living beings. These laws seem to be a legiti- 
mate generalization from all the facts observed. The first declares 
that the phenomena of life are manifested only in and through living 
matter, protoplasm; that is to say. in and through a substance which 
has a certain chemical and physical composition. Chemically it is a 
proteid complexus with a hexonic nucleus. Physically it shows a 
frothy structure analogous to that resulting from the mixture of two 
granular, immiscible liquids difiering in viscosity. The second law 
declares that the phenomena of life can only be maintained in a proto- 
plasm which has the organization belonging to a complete cell, with 
its cell body and nucleus. 

Helative value of these laws — Edruptions. — What is the signification 
of these laws of the chemical composition and organization of living- 
beings? Evidently that life in all its plenitude can only occur and be 
perpetuated under their protection. If these laws were abst)lute, if it 
were true that no life were possible except in and through albuminous 
protoplasm, except in and through the cell, the prol)lem of ''the life 
of matter" would be decided in the negative. 

May it not be, however, that fragmentai'y and incomplete vital 
manifestations, progressive sketches of a true life, may occur under 
different conditions; for exam[)le. in matter which is not protoplasm, 
and in a body which has a structure differing from that of a cell — that 
is to say, in a being which would be neither animal nor plant? This is 
the very question we have to considei-. and we must seek its solution 
by the way of experimentation. 



404 THE LIFE OF MATTER. 

Without leaving the animal and vegetable kingdoms — that is to say, 
among veritable living beings — we already perceive attenuation in the 
rigor of the laws governing chemical constitution and cellular 
organization. 

The experiments of merotomy, that is to say of amputation, tried by 
Waller on nerves, on infusoria by Brandt, Gruber, Nussbaum, Bal- 
biani, and Verworn, teach us the necessity of the presence of the cellu- 
lar body and the nucleus — that is to say, of the integrity of the cell. 
But they also teach us that when that integrity no longer exists death 
does not inunediately ensue. A part of the vital functions continues 
to be performed in denucleated protoplasm, in a cell which is nuitilated 
and incomplete. 

Yltal j^henotnena in. eruHhed protopbt^m. — It is true also that grind- 
ing and crushing suppress the greater part of the functions of the 
cell. But tests with pulps of various organs and with those of certain 
yeast plants show that protoplasm, even though ground and dis- 
organized, can not be considered as inert, and that it still exhibits many 
of its characteristic phenomena; for example, the production of dias- 
tases, specific agents of vital chemistry. Finally, while we do not 
know enough about the actions of which the secondary elements of 
protoplasm are capable — its granulations, its filaments, which one or 
another method of destruction might disclose — to be able to deny that 
protoplasm has power of action independent of its own integrity, we 
at least know that actions of this kind exist. 

To summarize, we are far from being able to deny that rudimentar}^, 
isolated, vital acts mav not be executed b}^ the various bodies that 
result from the dismemberment of protoplasm. The integrity of the 
cellular organization, even the integrity of protoplasm itself, is not 
indispcnsal)le for these manifestations of vitality. 

Besides, naturalists admit that within the protoplasm are aliquot 
parts, elements of an inferior order, which possess special activities. 
These secondary elements must have the princii)le of th(>ir activity 
within themselves. Such are the biophores to which Weissniann 
attributes the vital functions of the cell, nutrition, growth, and nmlti- 
plication. If there are biophores within the cell they may be imagined 
as outside of it, and since the}^ carry within themselves the principle 
of their activity, they may exercise it in an independent manner. 
Unhappily the biophores, and other elements of that kind, are purely 
hypothetical. TKey are like the gemmules of Darwin, the bioblasts 
of Altmann, and the pangenes of De Vries. They have no relation to 
facts of observation and to real existence. 

Ylfal pliriioinena in brute IxxVnx. — TIkm'c^ is no (loul)t but certain 
])h('n()inena of" vitality may occur outside of the cell and its neighbor- 
hood. To carry this fai'ther we may admit tiiat they may be produced 
in certain unorganized l)odies, in certain brute bodies. In ever}^ case 
there are surely produced effects similar at least to those which are

IV. 

KVOLTTIOX AND 3*rrTAP.rLlTY OF LIVTNd MATTKIi AND lUvTTK 

MATTER. 

One of the most remarkable characteristics of a li\ine- l)einu- is its 
evolution. It undergoes a continuous change. It starts with ii feeble 
beginning; it is formed, grows, then in ordinary cases declines and 
disappears, having followed a predictable course, regulated as to time, 
a sort of ideal trajectory. 

Sii2>2>'>s((l !iii)uoh!lify i>f hratc hf>dle.'<. — It may be asked whether this 
evolution, this directed mobility, is so exclusively a feature of tlie 
living being as it appears, and if many brute ])odles do not present 
something analogous to it. The response is not at all dou))tful. 

Bichat was mistaken when he cojitrasted in this respect brute l)odies 
with living bodies. Vital properties, he said, are temporary; it is 
their nature to exhaust themselves; in time they are used up in the 
same l)ody. Physical properties, on the contrary, are eternal. Brute 
bodies have neither commencement nor necessar}' end, neither age nor 
evolution; thev remain as inunutal)k> as death of which they are the 
image. 

JSl<>l>Uifij and rtnitahility of the sidereal uH>rld. — This is not true, in 
the first place, of the sidereal bodies. The ancients V)elieved that the 
sidereal world was immutable and incorruptible. The doctrine of the 
incorrui)til)ility of the heavens prevailed up to the seventeenth cent- 
ury. The ol)servers who at that epoch directed toward the heavens 
the first telescope, which Galileo had just invented, were struck with 
astonishment at discovering change in the celestial firmament that 
they had believed incorruptil)le and by perceiving a new star that 
appeared in the constellation of Serpentarius. Such changes no longer 
sui'prise us. Th(> cosmogonic system of Laplace has become familiar 
to all culti\ated minds and everyone is accustomed to the idea of the 
mobility and <-<)ntinual e\'olution of the celestial world. ''The stars 
have not always existed," writes M. Faye; ''"they have had a p(M-i()d 
of formation; they will likewise have a period of decline, followed 
by a final extinction.''' 

All th(^ bodies of inanimate nature are not, then, eternal and imnui- 
table; th(» celestial bodies are (>minently susceptible of e\'olution, slov/ 
indeed compared with that we observe on the surface of our globe; j)ut 
that dispropprtion, coiresponding to the iuunensity of time and of 
cosmic spaces as compared with our terrestrial measurements, should 
not mislead us as to the fundanienlal analogy of the phenomena. 



406 THE LIFE OF MATTER. 

1. THE movj:ment of particles and molecules in brute bodies. 

It is iKjt only ill the celestial spaces that we must search for that 
niol)ilitv of brute matter that imitates that of living' matter. In order 
to lind it we have only to look about u,s or to interrogate physicists 
and chemists. 

As to the geologists, M. le Dantec speaks somewhere of one of them 
who divided minerals into living rocks, those susceptible of changing- 
their structure, of undergoing- an evolution under the influence of 
atmospheric causes; and dead rocks, those which, like clay, have found 
at the end of all their changes a final state of repose. Jerome Cardan, 
a celebrated scientist of the sixteenth century, at once mathematician, 
naturalist, and physician, declared not only that stones live, but that 
they sufi'er from disease, old age, and death. The jewelers of to-day 
speak in this way concerning certain precious stones, turquoises, for 
example. 

The alchemists carried these ideas to an extreme. It is not neces- 
sary here to recall the past, to evoke hermetic beliefs or the dreams 
of the alchemists, according to whom the difl'erent kinds of matter 
lived, developed, and were transmuted into each other. 

We refer to precise and recent data, established })y the most expert 
investigators, and related by one of them, Ch. Ed. (xuillaume, three 
years ago, before the Helvetic Society of Natural Sciences. These 
data show that the determinate forms of matter may live and di(>. in 
the sense that they may become modified in a slow and continuous 
manner, always in the same direction, until they have attained an 
ultimate and definite state which is that of eternal repose. 

TJie hitestinal inocejuents of hodles. — The reply of Swift to an idle 
fellow who spoke slightingly of work is well known; ''In England,'' 
said the author of Gulliver, "men work, women work, horses work, 
oxen work, fire works, and beer works; there is only the pig who 
does nothing at all; he must be, therefore, the only gentleman in Eng- 
land." We know veiy well that English gentlemen also work. 
IiuUhhI, eveiybody and everything works. And the celeln'ated humor- 
ist was nearer right than he supposed in comparing in this respect men 
and things. Everything is at work; everything in nature toils and 
strives, at every stage, in every degree. Innno))ility, repose, are 
usually, in natural things, merely a false appc^arance; the seeming 
quietude of matter is caused by our inability to appreciate its interior 
agitation. Because of their miiuiteness we do not perceive the swarm- 
ing particles that compose it, and which, inider the impassable surface 
of l)odies, oscillate, displace each other, move to and fro, and group 
themselves into forms and positions adapted to the conditions of the 
environment. In comparison Avitli thes(> microscopic (dements we are 
like the giant of Swift in the midst of the people of Lilliput; and this 
is fai' Ixdow the actual facts. 



THE LIFE OF MATTEK. 407 

K'nu'i'ic conceptual (.)J: moh'ciilar iiKircmcntx. — Tho idea of tliis peculiur 
ugitation is by no means- ne\V" to us. Wo wore familiarized with it 
in scientitic theories during our colicgo days. The atomic theory 
teaches us that matter behaves, from a chemical point of \ imv, as if it 
were divided into molecules and atoms. The kinetic theory explains 
the constitution of gases and the effects of heat by supposing that 
these particles are endowed with movements of rotation and displace- 
ment. The wave theory explains luminous phenomena by supposing 
peculiar vibratory movements in a special medium, the ether. But 
these are merely hypotheses which are not at all necessary; they are 
the images of things, not the things themselves. 

Reality of the morements of particles. — Here there is no question of 
Iwpotheses. This intestinal agitation, this interior work, this inces- 
sant activity of matter are positive facts, an objective reality. It is 
true that when the chemical or mechanical equilibrium of bodies is 
disturbed it is restored more or less slowly. Sometimes days and 
3"ears are required l)efo!e it is regained. Scarcely do they attain this 
relative repose when they are again disturbed, for the environment 
itself is not fixed; it suti'ers variations which react in their turn upon 
the body under consideration; and it is only at the end of these varia- 
tions, at the end of theii' respective periods, that they together attain, 
in a universal uniformity, an et(M'nal repose. 

We shall see that metallic alloys undergo contimial physical and 
chemical changes. They are always seeking an e(|uilil)rium which more 
or less escapes them. Physicists in modern times have given their atten- 
tion to this intestinal activity of material })odies in pursuit of stal)ility. 
Wiedemann, Warburg, Tonilinson. MM. Duguet, Brillouin, Duhem, 
and Bouasse have revived tiie oldex})erimental studies of C'ouloml) and 
Wertheim upon the elasticity of bodies, the etiects of ])ressure, traction, 
hanuiiering of metals, tempcn-ing, and annealing. 

The intestinal actixity manifested under these circumstances pri\sents 
quite remarka])le characteristics which have been almost necessarily 
compared to the analogous phenomena presented by living bodies. 
There has been created, e\ en in physics, a iigurati\e terminology, and 
metaphorical expressions have been borrowed from biolog\'. 

Conepartsoii of the actirlty (fpartlclcx mit/i tufaJ act ir it//. -It was 
Lord Kelvin who first spoke of the fatigue of metals, or \\\v fatigue of 
elasticity, and, since then, Bose showed for these same l)odies the 
fatigue of the electric touch [tact electricjue]. The term acconnnodation 
has been employed in the study of torsion, and according to 'I'ondinson, 
for preciseh' those [)henomeiui which are the inverse of those of fatigue. 
The phenomena pres(>nted by glass when it is sul)jected to an exterior 
force which slowly bends it, have Ihmmi considered as thost> of adapta- 
tion. The m.ethods by which a bar of steel resists wire-drawing ha\'c 
been legarded as means of defense against threatened rupture. And 



408 THE LIFE OF MATTER. . 

M. Charles Edward (hiillaiune speaks somewhere of "the heroic resist- 
ance of the bar of nickel-steeL"" The term "defense" has been also 
applied to the behavior of chloride or iodide of silver when exposed to 

There has ])een no hesitation in using- the term "memory" concur- 
rently with that of hysteresis to designate the behavior of bodies sub 
mitted to the action of magnetism or of certain mechanical forces. It 
is true that M. H. Bouasse protests in the name of the phj^sico-math- 
ematicians against the emploj'ment of these figurative expressions. 
But has he not himself written "a twisted wire is a watch wound up," 
and elsewhere " the properties of ))odies depend at every moment upon 
all anterior modifications f Is this not to say that they retain in some 
manner the impression of the changes the}^ have experienced? Power- 
ful deformative agencies leave a trace of their action, they modify the 
state of molecular aggregation of the bod}-, and some physicists go so 
far as to say that the}' even modif}- its chemical constitution. With 
the exception of M, Duhem, the mechanicians who have studied elas- 
ticity admit that the effect of an exterior force upon a body depends 
upon the forces to which it has been previously sul)jected, and not 
merely upon those which are acting upon it at the time. Its present 
state can not be predetermined, it is the recapitulation of preceding- 
states. The effect of a torsional force upon a new wire will be differ- 
ent ironi that of the same force upon a wire previously subjected to 
torsions and detorsions. It was with reference to actions of this kind 
that Boltzmann in 1876 declared that a wire that has been twisted or 
drawn out remembers for a certain time the deformations to which it 
has been subjected. This memory is defaced and lost after a certain 
definite period. Here then, in a problem of static equilibrium, there 
is introduced an unexpected factor — time. 

To summarize, it is the physicists themselves who have indicated 
the correspondence l)etween the state of existence in many l)rute 
bodies and that in many living bodies. It can not be expected that 
these analogies will in any wav serve as explanations. We should 
rather seek the dciixation of the vital phenomenon from the physical 
phenomiMioii. This is [ho sole ambition of the physiologist, and the 
inverse of this would be unreasonable. We do not assume to do tiiis 
here. It is nexcrtheless true that analogies are of ser\ice, were it 
oidy to shake th(> confidence which, smce the time of Aristotle, has 
l)een accorded to the division of the bodies of nature into jjs>/('/i/(/ and 
ajMur-/r!a, that is to say, into li\ iiig and brute bodies.

The i-xixttucr of lh< Ilrownhdi in<tr( nunt. — The most simple means 
of judging of th(> working activities of matter is to observe it in the 
case where the liberty of the particles is not interfered with by the

Mction of the lu'ighboriiio- particles. We ti|)pr():ich that coiKliiioii 
when we observe through "the microscope grains of dust suspended in 
a li(juid or g-lobules of oil suspended in water. Now the result of 
this case is well known to all niicroscopists. If the granulations are 
sufficientl}' small, they are seen to be never at rest. Thev are 
animated l)v a sort of incessant tremor; we see the phenomenon 
cidlcHl the "'Brownian movement."" The spectacle of this agitation 
has sti'uck all ol)servers since the invention of the loupe or simple 
microscope. But the Englishman, Hrt)\vn, in 18:^7, made it the object 
of a special study and left it his name. The exact explanation of it 
remained for a long time obscui'e. It was given in 1S',I4 ]>y the learned 
ph3'sicist of the faculty of Lyons, M. Uouy. 

The observer who for the first time looks through the microscope 
at a drop of water from the river, from the sea, or from any ordinary 
source — that is to say, water not specially puritied — is struck with sur- 
prise and admiration at the spectacle of the motion that appears in it. 
Infusoria, microscopic articulata, various micro-organisms, people the 
microscopic tield and animate it with their movements; but at the 
same time all soi'ts of particles are also agitated, particles which can 
not be considered as living beings and which are, in fact, nothing but 
organic detritus, mineral dust and debris of every description, (^uite 
often the singular movements of these g"ranulations, w^hich sinndate up 
to a certain ])oint those of living- beings, have perplex(Kl the observer 
or drawn him into error, and the bodies that manifest them ha\'e Ixmmi 
taken for animalcules or for l)acteria. 

Charactei'K of thh inot'einent. — But it is ordinarily quite easy to 
avoid this confusion. The Brownian movement is a sort of oscillation, 
a treadmill of to and fro movement not accompanied by translation. 
It is a Saint Guy's dance executed in one spot, thus distinguished from 
the movements of displacement habitual to animate beings. Each 
particle executes its own special dance. Each one acts on its own 
account independently of its neighbor. Theri^ is, however, in the 
execution of these individual oscillations a sort of connnon and regular 
character which arises from the fact that their amplitudes ditiei- little 
from each other, Th(> largest particles are the slowest; alK)\'e four 
one-thousandths of a millimeter in diameter they almost cease to be 
mobile. The smallest are most active. WhiMi so small as to be barelv 
visible througi) the microscope the mo\ ement is extremely rapid and 
can only occasionally be perceived. It is proba])l(^ that it would be 
still more accelerated for smaller ot)j(H-ts. but the latter ai-e destined 
to eternally escape our observation. 

Its iiid('ju'ii<hnc(' of tin' )t(ifin'(' (ftJir Jxid'us oiid <f the eiirlroiniKiif. — 
M. Gouy has remarked that the movement depends neither on the 
nature nor on. the form of the j)articles. Even the nature of th(> 
liquid has but little intluence. Its degree of viscosity aloiu^ is of etle(!t. 



410 THE LIFE OF MATTER. 

The inovomciits uro, indeed, more lively in alcohol or eth(M'. which are 
very mo))ile liquids. They are slow in sulphuric acid and o'lyccrin. 
In water, a j^rain one two-thousandth of a inilliineter in diameter tra\ - 
erses, in a second, ten or twelve times its own lenuth. 

The fact that the Brownian movement is seen in liquors which have 
been boiled, in acids and in concentrated alkalis, in toxic solutions of 
all degrees of temperature, shows conclusively that the phenomenon 
has no vital significance; that it is in no wa>^ connected with vital 
activity so (tailed. 

Its indefinite duration. — The most remarkable character of this 
phenomenon is its permanence, its indefinite duration. The move- 
ment never ceases, the particle never arrives at repose and equilib- 
rium. Granitic rocks contain quartz crystals which at the moment of 
their formation included within a closed cavity a drop of water which 
contained a ))u))l)le of gas. These bubbles, contemporar}^ with the 
Plutonian age of the globe, have never from that time ceased to mani- 
fest the Brownian movement. 

Its independence of external conditions. — What is the cause of this 
eternal oscillation ^ Is it a tremor of the earth ^ No. M. Gouy siw 
the Brownian movement exist far from cities, where the mercurial 
mirror of a seismograph showed no subterranean vibration. It did 
not increase when these vibrations appeared and became quite appre- 
ciable. Neither is it changed by variation in light, magnetism, or 
electric influence«; in a word, by external occurrences. The result of 
observation is to place before us the paradox of a phenomenon wdiich 
is kept up and indefinitely perpetuated in the interior of a body with- 
out known exterior cause. 

The Brovminn movetnent mast he the p'r.st st(/(/r of moJecidar inove- 
nu'tit. — When we take in our hands a shcM't of (luartz which contains 
a gaseous inclusion we seem to ))e holding a pm'fecth^ inert object. 
When we have placed it upon the stage of the microscope and have 
d(Mnonstrated the agitation of the bul)blc wc mi"c (•()n\inccd that this 
seeming inertia is merely an illusion. 

The repose exists only in the limitations of our vision, ^\'e s(>e the 
objects as we see from afar a crowd of peo})le; we perceive them as 
a whole, without being able to discern the individuals or their move- 
ments. A visible object is, in the same way. a mass of i)articles. It 
is a molecular ci-owd. It gives us the iiupi'ession of an indivisible 
mass, of a block in repose; but as soon as a lens l)rings us nc^ar to this 
crowd, as soon as the microscope enlarges for us the minute elements 
of the ])rutebody, then it appears to us, and we ])erceive the contiiuial 
agitation of those who are at least four one-thousandths of a millimeter 
in diameter. The smaller the particles under consideration, the more 
lively are their movements. From this we infer that if we could per- 
ceive molecules whose probable dimensions are about one thousand

tiiiiGs less, theii- prol);il)le velocity woukl he, as re((uire(l by tiie kiiu'tic 
theory, some hundreds of- milKnieters per seeoiid. The Browiiiun 
velocity of the smallest objects we can perceive is l)iit some thou- 
sandths of a millimeter per second. Doubtless, concludes ]\I. (Jouy, 
the particles that show this movement are really enormous when com- 
pared with true molecules. Looked at in this way, the Hrownian 
movement is ])ut the tirst degree and a gross manifestation of the 
nioleculsir \ibrations which th<» kinetic theory sup})oses. 

3. THE INTESTINAL A(^TI\ITY OF ]U)1)IES. 

Mkjrat'uni of inaferidl p<uiivlix. — In the Brownian movement wo 
take into account only very siuall, isolated masses, small free frag- 
ments; thitt is to say, material particles which are not hampered by 
their relations to neighboring particles. Any cither but a physicist 
might believe that in true solids endowed with cohesion and tenacity 
in which the molecules are l)ound one to the other, in which the form 
and th(» volume are Hxed, then^ could l)e no longer any movements or 
changes. This is an error. Physics teaches us the contrary, and, 
especially in these latter j^ears, has furnished us characteristic exam- 
ples. There are veritable migrations of material ])articles throughout 
solid bodies — miorations of consideral>le extent. Thev are accom- 
plished through the agency of diverse forces acting from the exte- 
rior — pressures, tractions, torsions — sometimes under the action of 
light, sometimes under the action of electricity, sometimes under the 
intiuence of forces of diffusion. The microscopic observation of alloy's 
by MM. H. and A. Lechatelier, J. Hopkinson, Osmond, Charpy, 
J.-K. Benoit; the studies of their physical and chemical properties by 
MM. Calvert, Matthiessen, Riche, Roberts Austen, Lodge, Laurie, 
and Ch.-Ed. (uiillaume; the experiments in the electrolysis of glass, 
and the curious results of Bose upon the electric touch [tact-electrique] 
of metals show in a striking manner the chemical and kinetic evolu- 
tions which occur in the 'interior of bodies. 

]\f!<jr((f!())i iindrr the ijirfJnence of irc/(jJit. — An experiment of 0])er- 
meyer which dates from 1877 furnishes a good examj)le of the migra- 
tions of solid bodies through a hardened viscid mass under the influence 
of weight. Shoemaker's wax, the black wax that shoemakers and 
boat builders use, is a kind of resin extracted from the pine and other 
resinous trees, melted in water, and separated from a more fluid part 
which rises above it. It is colored by the lampblack produced by the 
combustion of straw and fragments of bark. At an ordinary temper- 
ature it is a mass so hard that it can not always be indented easily by 
the finger nail; but if it is left to itself in a receptacle it finally yields, 
spreads out as if it were a liquid, and conforms to the shape of the 
vessel. Suppose we place within a cavity hollowed out of a piece of 
wood a portion of this wax and keep it there by means of a few pcb- 



412 THE LIFE OF MATTER. 

))l(\s, having- proviousl\' placed at the ))()ttoin of the cavity some frag- 
ments of a light substance, like cork. The piece of wax is thus between 
a light body below and a heavy body above. If we wait a few days 
this order is reversed — the wax has filled the cavity by conforming to 
it; the cork has passed through the wax and appears upon the surface, 
while the stones are at the bottom. We have here the celebrated 
experiment of the flask with the three elements, in which are seen the 
liquids mercury, oil, and water superposed in the order of tluMr 
densit}", demonstrated in this case by means of solid bodies. 

Influence of dlfiision. — Ditt'usion, which disseminates li({uids 
throughout each other, ma}^ also cause solids to pass through other 
solids. W. Roberts Austen places a little cylinder of lead upon a disk 
of gold and keeps the whole at the temperature of boiling water. At 
this temperature both metals are perfectly solid, since gold does not 
melt up to 1,200 V. nor lead up to SSO*-^. Still, after this contact has 
been prolonged for a month and a half, analysis shows that the gold 
has become dili'used to the top of the cylinder of lead. 

Inflnenee of electrolysis. — Electrolysis ofll^'ers another means of trans- 
portation no less remarkable. By its means we ma}^ force metals, 
such as sodium or lithium, to pass through glass walls. The experi- 
ment may be performed in the method indicated by M. Charles Guil- 
laume. A. glass Inilb containing mercury is placed in a bath of .sodium 
amalgam and a current is then made to pass from within outward. 
After some time it can be shown that the metal has penetrated the 
wall of the bidb and become dissolved in the interior. 

Iiiflaence of riiecJKniical jyressure. — Mechanical pressure is also capa- 
ble of causing one metal to pass into another. We need not recall the 
well-known experiment of Cailletet, who, by emplo^nng considerable 
pressure, caused mercury to sweat through a block of iron. In a 
more simple manner W. Spring showed that a disk of copper could be 
welded to a disk of tin by pressing them strongly one against the 
other. There is formed, up to a certain distance from the surfaces of 
co'ntact, a veritable alio}'; there is a layer of bronze of a certain thick- 
ness which unites the two metals, and this could not take place did not 
the i)ai'ticl(>s ol" both metals mutually intei'peneti'ate. 

4. INTKSTINAI. ACTIVITY OF ALLOYS. 

fStnictare of alloys. — Metallic alloys hiive a reiuarkalde structure 
which is essentially mobile and which we have now begun to und(M'- 
stand, thanks to the employnuMit of the microscope. Microscopical 
examination justifies to a certain degree tlu^ supposition of Coulomb. 
That illustrious physicist explained th(» physical properties of metals 
by imagining that they were formed of two kinds of elements — inte- 
gral particles, to which the metal ow(\s its ])roperties of elasticit>% and 
a cem(>nt which binds the ])articles and to which it owes its coherence. 



THE LIFE OF MATTER. 413 

i\I. Brillouin has a^'ain tHkeii up this hypothesis of (hiaiity of stiucture. 
The metal is supposed to b^ foiHued of very small, isolated, (nystallinc 
oiaius embedded in an almost continuous netwoi'k of viseous matter; 
a more or less compact mass surrounding more or less distinct crys- 
tals is the conception which may be formed of an alloy. 

ChatK/t's of struct u t')' 2)i'odueed hy defoi'tii'nxj (((/mdcx. — It has l)een 
shown that profound chano-es of crystalline structure can be produced 
by \ arious mechanical means, such as hammering and the traction of 
metallic bars carried as far as rupture. Some of these changes are 
\ cry slow, and it is only after months and y^ears that they are completed 
and the metal attains the definitive equilibrium corresponding to the 
conditions in which it is placed. Tliough there may be disi-ussions 
concerning the nature of the transformations to which it is subjected, 
though some believe they affect the chemical condition of the alloy, 
while others limit its power to physical effects, it is nevertheless trui; — 
and this brings us back to our sul)ject — that the mass of these metals 
is at work and that it only slowly attains the phase of complete repose. 

TJie .slow reestahllslMnent of equlllhrlioii — Hesidiud ejf'txt. — These 
operations by which the physical characters of metals are changed, 
and by which they are adapted to a variety of industrial needs — com- 
pression, hanuuering, rolling, traction, and torsion — have an inunedi- 
ate, \Qvy apparent effect; l)ut they have also a consecutive effect, 
slowly produced, much less marked and less evident. This is the 
residual effect or "Nachwirkung" of the Germans. It is not with- 
out importance even in practical applications. 

Heat also creates a sort of forced equilibrium. This becomes but 
slowly moditied, so that a body ma}^ remain for a long time in a state 
which is nevertheless the uiost stable for the conditions under which 
it is considered. The number of these bodi(\s out of e(|uilil)rium is as 
great as that of the matters which have been submitted to fusion. 
All the Plutonian rocks are in this condition. Glass pres(Mits a simi- 
lar one. Thermometers placed in melting ice d(^) not always mark the 
z(Mo of centigrade. This displacement of the zero point falsities all 
their indications if care is not taken to correct it. This correction 
usually demands a long observation. The theory of the displacement 
of the thermometric zero is not entirely established, but we may sup- 
pose with the author of the Traite de Thermometrie that thei'(> exists 
in glass, as in alloys, compounds which vary according to the tempera- 
ture. At each temperature glass tends to assume a determinate com- 
position and a corresponding state of equilibrium, but the pixnious 
temperature to which it has been subjected has e\idently an influence 
upon the rapidity with which it attains its state of repose. The effect 
of vai'iation is more marked as we ol)ser\e glasses of luore complicated 
composition. We can readily understand that those which contain 
comparable (quantities of the two alkalies, soda and potash, may be 



414 THE LIFE <)t MATTER. 

more subject to tliese inoditication.s than those having a more simple 
composition based on a single alkali. 

Effeds of annealing. — A piece of brass wire that has been drawn and 
then heated is the theatre of very remarkable internal changes that 
liaA^e been only recently recognized. The violence done to the metallic 
thread in forcing it through the hole in the die crushed the crystalline 
particles; the interior state of the wire is that of broken crystals sur- 
rounded by a gj-anular mass. Heating changes all that. The crystals 
separate, repair themselves, and reform; they are then hard, geomet- 
rical bodies, plunged in an amorphous mass, relatively soft and plastic; 
their number keeps on increasing; equilil)rium is not established until 
the entire mass is crystallized. One may imagine how many displace- 
ments, enormous when compared with their dimensions, the molecules 
have to undergo when transporting themselves throughout the resisting 
mass and arranging themselves in definite places in the crystalline 
edifices. 

In the sanie way, too, in the manufacture of steel, the particles of 
coal at first applied to the surface tra\'erse the iron. 

This faculty of molecular displacement permits in some cases the 
metal to modify its state at one point or another. The use made of 
this faculty in certain circumstances is very curious, greatly resem- 
bling the adaptation of an animal to its environment, or the methods 
of defense which it employs to resist agents that might destroy it. 

Effect of fraefhyn and str lei ion — Exmrhnent of Hartniann . — When a 
cylindrical rod of metal, held firmly at either end — a test rod, as it 
is called in metallurgy — is subjected to a powerful traction it often 
elongates considerably, part of the elongation disappearing as soon as 
the strain stojjs, another part remaining. The total elongation is thus 
the sum of an "elastic elongation," which is temporary, and a "per- 
manent elongation." If we continue the traction there appears at 
some point of the rod a narrowing, a striction. It is there that the 
rod will l)reak. 

But in place of continuing the traction. Mr. Hartmann suspends it. 
He stops, as if to give the metal being time to rally. During this 
delay it would seem that the molecules hasten to the menaced point to 
reinforce and harden the weak part. In fact, the metal which was 
soft at other points has here taken on the aspect of tempered metal. 
It is no longer extensible. 

When the experimenter reconunences traction after this rest, the 
narrowed bar having been submitted to the action of a roller and 
returned to a cylindrical form, a second narrowing forms at another 
point. If another rest is given this striction also will become resistant. 

If we renew this experiment a sutficient number of times there will 
result a total transformation of the rod, which will become hardened 
throughout its entire extent. It will break rather than elongate if 
the traction is sutficientlv energetic. 



THE lifp: of mattkk. 415 

yicl'eJ sfeeJx — Tlietv heroic defence — Nickel .steels ])resent this phe- 
nomenon in iui exao-gerafed deg-ree. The altei'iiatioii of operations 
which we have just described, which bring the various parts of an ordi- 
nary steel rod into a tempered state, is not necessary with nickel steel. 
The etiect is produced in the course of a single trial. As soon as 
there is any narrowing at any point the alloy hardens at that precise 
place; the striction is hardly marked; the movement is stopped at this 
point to attack another feeble point, stops there again and attacks a 
third, and so on; and finally the paradoxical fact appears that a rod of 
metal which was in a soft state and could be considerably elongated 
has now 1)ecome throughout its whole extent hard, fragile, and inex- 
tensible like tempered steel. It is in connection with this fact that 
M. C'has. Edward (xuillaume spoke of heroic I'csistance to rupture. 
It would seem, in fact, as if the bar of nickel iron had reenforced each 
weak point in proportion as it was menaced. It is oidy at the end of 
these efforts that the inevitable catastrophe occurs. 

Effect of teutperatiirc. — When the temperature changes it is seen 
that these nickel irons elongate or retract, modifying at the same time 
their chemical constitution. But these effects, like those which occur 
in the glass reservoir of a thermometer, are not acquired all at once. 
They are produced rapidly for one part and more slowly for a small 
remainder. Bars of nickel iron which have been kept at the same 
temperature change gradually in length during the course of an entire 
year. Can we ffnd a better proof of intestinal activity occurring in 
a substance greatly differing from living matter^ 

Nature of the activity (fjiai-ticte-'i. — These are examples of the intes- 
tinal activity that occurs in brute bodies. Besides, these facts that we 
are citing merely to refute the assertion of Bichat relative to the 
immutability of brute bodies and to show their iictivity l)ring us, in 
addition, another proof. They show^ that this activity, like that of 
animals, is a guard against foreign intervention, and that this guard, 
again like that of animals, is adapted for the defense and preservation 
of the brute mass. 

If we accord a special \alue to the adaptati^•e or teleological char- 
acteristic of vital phenomena, a characteristic which is so eaiuly abused 
in biological interpretations, we may also ffnd it again in the inanimate 
world. To this end we may add to tlie preceding examples a last one 
which is no less remarkable. This is the famous case of the photog- 
raphy of colors after BecquereTs method. 

Photogra,2jhy of colors. — A grayish plate, treated with chloride or 
iodide of silver and exposed to a red light, rapidly becomes red. It is 
then exposed to green light and after passing through some dull and 
obscure tints it becomes green. If w^e wished to explain this remark- 
able phenomenon we could do no better than to say that the silver salt 
protects itself against the light that threatens its existence; that light 



41() THE LIFE OF MATTER. 

caut^es it to pass through all .states of coloration before redueiiio- it; 
the salt stops at the state which protects it best. It stops at red, if it 
is red light that assails it, because by becoming- red it repels by reflec- 
tion, that light; that is to say, it absorbs it the least. 

It ma}^ then be advantageous, for the purpose of comprehending 
natural phenomena, to regard the transformations of inanimate matter 
as manifestations of a sort of internal life. 

Conclusion — Rdations of the Hurro'Widbuj nicdhnu to tlic I i ring 
7)('/' /if/ 0)id f/te hri/fehodj/.— Brute f)odies then are not imnuitable any 
more than are living bodies. Both depend upon the medium that 
surrounds them, and they depend upon it in the same way. Life 
brings together, puts in conflict, an appropriate organism and a suita- 
lf)le environment. Auguste Comte and Claude Bernard have taught 
us that vital phenomena result from the reciprocal action of these two 
factors Avhich are in close correlation. It is also from the reciprocal 
action of the environment and the brute body that inevitably i-esultthe 
phenomena which that body presents. The living body is sometimes 
more sensitive to ambient variations than is the brute body, but at 
other times the reverse is the case. For example, there is no living 
organism as impressionable to any excitant whatever as is the bolometer 
to the slightest variations of temperatui-e. 

There can only be, then, one chemically immutable body, which is 
the atom of a simple bod}-, since according to its very definition it 
remains unaltered and unalterable in combinations. This notion of an 
unaltera])le atom has, however, itself been attacked l)y the doctrine of 
the ionisation of particles advanced by J. J. Thomson; and })esides, 
with very few exceptions — those of cadmium, mercury, and the gases 
of the argon series — the atoms of simple ])()dies can not exist in a free 
state. 

So it is that, as in the vital struggle, the ambient medium furnishes 
to the living being, in whole or in part by alimentation, the materials 
of its organization and the energies which it puts in play. It also 
furnishes to brute bodies their materials and their energies. 

It is also said that the ambient medium furnishes the living l>eing a 
third class of things, the stinmlants of its activities — that is to say, its 
"provocation to action." The protozoan flnds in the aquatic environ- 
ment which is its habitat the stimulants which provoke it to move and 
to absorb its aliments. The cells of the metozoan enccmnter in the 
same way in the lymph, the blood, and the interstitial li(juids which 
bathe them the shock, the excitation which brings their energies into 
pl:iy. They do not have in themselves, by a mysterious spontaneity 
without example in the rest of nature, the ca|)ri('ious principle which 
sets them in motion. 

Vital spontaneity, so readily admitted by persons ignorant of biology, 
is disproved by all the history of the science. Ever}' vital manifesta-

tion is a response to iu sthnulation, a provoked plienoinenon. It is 
not necessary to say that jb is tille same with ])rute })odies, since that 
is precisely in what consists the great principle of the inertia of matter. 
It is plain that it is also as applicable to living as to inanimate matter.

SPECIFIC FORM. LIVINCi BODIES AND CRYSTALS. 
1. SPECIFIC FORM AND CHEMICAL (CONSTITUTION. 

In the enumeration which we have made of the essential features of 
vitality there are three that have, so to speak, a prime value. These 
are, in the order of their importance: The possession of a specific 
form; the faculty of growth, or nutrition; and linaily, the faculty of 
reproduction by generation. By restricting our comi)arison l^etween 
brute bodies and living bodies to these truly fundamental characters 
we restrict the field, but we shall see that the resemblances do not 
disappear. 

Wide distrihutlon of erystalUne foriii.^. — In the mineral world we 
have only to consider crystallized bodies, they being almost the only 
ones that possess definite foruL In restricting ourselves to this cate- 
gory we do not limit our field so much as might be supposed. Crys- 
talline forms are widely distributed. They are, in a manner, uni- 
versal. Matter has a decided tendency to assume these forms whenever 
the physical forces which it obeys act with order and regularity and 
their action is not disturbed b}' accidental occurrences. In the same 
wa}^, too, living forms are onl}- possible in regulated environments, 
under normal conditions, protected from cataclysms and convulsions 
of nature. 

The possession of a specific form is the most significant feature of 
an organized being. Its tendency, from tlie time it begins to develop 
from the germ, is toward the acquirement of that foruL Tiie pro- 
gressive manner in which it seeks to realize its architectural plan in 
spite of the obstacles and difficulties that arise — healing its wounds, 
repairing its nmtilations — all this, in the eyes of the philosophical 
naturalist, forms what is perhaps the most striking characteristic of a 
living being, that which best shows its unity and its individuality. 
This property of organogenesis seems preeminently a vital property. 
It is not so, however, for crystalline bodies possess it in an almost 
equal degree. 

The parallel between the crystal and a living being has been often 
drawn. We will not reproduce it here in detail. We wish only, after 
having sketched its principal features, to call attention to the new 
matters concerning it that have been brought out by recent investi- 
gations.

418 THE LIFE OF MATTER. 

Organization of crystals — Vietos of TTauy, Delafosse and Bravah^ 
and of ^\aUera,nt. — In botany, zoology, and crystallogTaphy we 
understand by form an assemblage of material constituents coordi- 
nated in a definite system; that is to sa}^, it is organization itself. 
The body of man, for example, is an edifice in which 60 trillions of 
cells ought each to find its own place fixed in advance. 

In crystallography also we understand ]jy form the organization 
which cr3'stals present. The grouping of the elements of cr3\stals is, 
perhaps, more simple. They are none the less organized, in the same 
sense that living bodies are. 

Their organization, while more uniform than that of living bodies, 
still show\s a considerable amount of variation. It should not be 
assumed that the area of a crystal is completel}' filled with contiguous 
parts applied one to the other by plane faces, as might be supposed 
from the phenomena of cleavage which dissociates the parts of the 
crystalline body into solids of this kind. In realit}^ the constituent 
parts are separated from each other b}* spaces. They are arranged 
in quincunx, as Haiiy says, or along the lines of a network, to use the 
terms of Delafosse and Bravais. The intervals left between them are 
much larger than their diameters. So it is that in the organization of 
a crystal it is necessary to take into account two quite diflerent 
things: An element, the crystalline particle, which is a certain aggre- 
gate of chemical molecules having a determinate geometrical form, 
and a more or less regular, parallelopipedic network, along whose 
crests are arranged in a constant and definite manner the aforesaid 
particles. The external form of the crystal indicates the existence of 
the network. Its optical properties depend upon the action of the 
particles, as M. Wallerant has shown. There are, therefore, to ])e 
distinguished in a crystal two kinds of geometrical figures — that of the 
network and that of the particle — and their characters of symmetry 
may be either concordant or discordant. 

The crystalline particle, the element of the crystal, is then a cei'tain 
molecular complex that repeats itself identically and is identicalh' 
placed at the nodes of the parallelopipedic network. It has l)een given 
difi'erent names well calculated to produce confusion — the crystallo- 
graphic molecule of Mallard, the complex particle of other authors. 
Some have separated this element into subordinate elements (the 
fundamental particles of Wallerant and of Lapparent). 

These very general outlines will suflice to .show how complex and 
adjusta])le is the organization of the crystalline individual, which, in 
spite of its geometric regularity and its rigidity, may be compared 
with the still more flexible organization of the living element. The 
mineral individual is more stable, less prone to undergo change than 
is the living individual. We ma}^ say with M. Lapparent that '•cr3\s- 
tallizcd matter presents the most perfect and stable orderly arrange- 
ment of which the particles of bodies are susceptible." 



THE LIFE OF MATTER. 419 

Lair i>f relation (>_f specific fop ii to chein'icdt const Itutlon. — Crystalli- 
zation is a method of aoquiririg specific form. The geometric archi- 
tecture of the mineral individual is l)ut little less than marv(dous and 
no less characteristic than that of the living individual. Its form is 
the result of the mutual reactions of its substance and of the medium 
in which it is produced; it is the condition of material eciuilihriuni cor- 
responding to a given situation. 

This idea of a specific form that belongs to a given substance under 
given conditions should be retained. We may consider it as a sort of 
principle of nature, an elementary law, which may serve as a point of 
departure for the explanation of phenomena. A particular sul)stance, 
imder identical conditions of environment, must always assume a cer- 
tain form. This close linking of substance to form, aduntted as a 
l)ostidate in physical sciences, has been carried ])y some philosophical 
naturalists, such ds M. Le Dantec, into the biological field. 

Let us imitate them for a moment. Let us cease to seek in the liv- 
ing ])eing for the prototype of the crystal; let us on the contrary seek 
in the crystal the prototype of the living l)eing. If we succeed in this, 
we shall then have ol)tained a physical basis for life. Let us say, then, 
with the biologists of whom we have l)een speaking, that the substance 
of each living individual is peculiai- to it; that it is specific, and that 
its form — that is to say its organization- follows from it. The mor- 
phology of any being whatever, of an animal — of a settx'r dog, for 
example — or even of a detei-minate being — of Peter, of Paul — is the 
""crystalline form of its li\'ing matter.'' It is the only foi'm of e(|ui- 
librium that can be assumed under the given conditions by the sul)- 
stance of the setter dog, of Peter or of Paul, just as the cube or the 
hopper form is the crystalline form of sea salt. In this mamiei- these 
biologists have supi)osed that they could carry back the problem of 
living form to the problem of living substance and at the same time 
throw back the biological mystery upon the physical mystery. 

Value of form as a cluiract eristic of li')fin<j an</ hrnte hein(js. — How- 
ever this may be, it can be affirmed without fear of exaggeration, that 
the crystalline form chai'acterizes the mineral with no less precision 
than the anatomical foi-m characterizes the animal and the })lant. In 
these two cases foriu — considered as a method* of disti'ibution of the 
parts — signalizes the individual and allows us to diagnose it with more 
or less facility. 

Parentage of living heings and mineral jxtroitage. — Still another 
analogy has been noted. In animals and plants similarity in form 
indicates similarity in descent, conununity of origin, and })roximity in 
any scheme of classification. In the same way identity of crystalline 
form indicates mineral relationship. Su])stances chemically analo- 
gous show" identical, geometrically superposable forms, and are thus 
arranged in family or generic groups recognizable at the first glance. 



420 THE LIFE OF MATTER. 

homorpliiHin and the faculty ofc7x>ssing. — Besides, the possibility, 
in the case of isomorphous bodies, of replacing each other in the same 
crystal during the process of formation and of thus mingling, so 
to speak, their congenital elements, may be compared with the pos- 
sibility of interbreeding with living beings of the same species. 
Isomorphism is thus a kind of faculty of crossing. And as the impos- 
sibilit}^ of crossing is the touchstone of taxonomic relationship, as it 
is the proof of it, separating stocks that ought to be separated, so the 
operation of crystallization is also a means of separating from an acci- 
dental mixture of mineral species the pure forms which are there 
blended. Crystallization is the touchstone of the specific purity of 
minerals; and it is an important process in chemical purification. 

Other aiioloyic.s. — The analogies between cr3"stalline and living forms 
ha^•e been pushed still further, even to the verge of abuse. 

The internal and external symmetry of animals and plants has been 
compared to that of crystals. Transitions or intergradations have 
been sought between the rigid and faceted architecture of the latter 
and the flexible structure and curved surfaces of the former; the utric- 
ular form of sublimated sulphur on the one hand and the geometrical 
structure of the testa of radiolarians on the other are thought to show 
an exchange of typical forms between the two systems. An effort 
has even been made to draw a parallel between six of the principal 
main stems of the animal kingdom and the six crystalline systems. 
Pushed to this degree the proposition takes on a puerile character. 
Real analogies will suffice. Among these the curious facts of crystal- 
line lenewal deserve first place. 

'•1. CICATRIZATION IN LIVING BEINGS AND IN CRYSTALS. 

We know that living beings not only possess a typical architecture 
that they have themselves constructed, ))ut that they defend it against 
destructive agencies and that at need they repair it. The living- 
organism cicatrizes its wounds, repairs losses of substance, regener- 
ates more or less perfectly the parts tluit have been removed: in other 
terms, when it has been mutilated it tends to reconstruct itself accord- 
ing to the laws of its own morphology. This phenomenon of recon- 
stitution oi- redintegration, these more or less successful efforts to 
reestablish its form in its integrity, appear, at first sight, to be a char- 
acteristic feature of living beings. That is not the case. 

M.utilatiooi and redintegration of eri/xtals. — Crystals — let us say 
crystalline individuals — show a similai- aptitude for repairing their 
mutilations. Pastcnir, in an (^arly work, discussed these curious facts. 
Other ex])(M'iment(n's, Gernez a little liit(M" and Rauber (|uite recenth', 
took \\\) the same subject and were only ahle to extend and confirm his 
observations. Crystals are formed from a primitive nucleus as the 
animal is foi-med from an Qgg\ their integral particles are disposed

according- to efficient -^geometrical laws so as to produce the typical 
form b}^ a constructive process that ma}^ be compared to the em))rvo- 
genic process that l)uikls up the body of an animal. Now this opera- 
tion may be disturbed ])y accidents in the surrounding medium or by 
the predetermined intervention of the experimenter. The crystal is 
then mutilated. Pasteur saw that these mutilations repaired them- 
selves. "When/' said he, "a crystal from which a piec(> has been 
broken otf is replaced in the mother liquor, we s(>e that while it 
increases in every direction by a deposit of crystalline particles, an 
excessive activity occurs at the place where it was broken or deformed; 
and in a few hours this suffices not only to build up the regular amount 
required for the increase of all parts of the crystal, but to reestab- 
lish regularity of form in the mutilated part." In other words, the 
woi"k of formation of the crystal is carried on much more actively at 
the point of lesion than it would have been had there been no lesion. 
The same thing would have occurred with a living being. 

Meclmnism of the reparution. — Gernez some 3^ears later made known 
the mechanism of this reparation, or at least its immediate cause. He 
showed that on the injured surface the crystal becomes less soluble 
than on the other facets. This is not, however, an exceptional phe- 
nomenon. It is, on the contrary, quite frequently observed that the 
difl'erent faces of a crystal show marked differences in solubility. 
This is what occurs in evei-y case for the nuitilated face in comparison 
with the othei's; the matter is less soluble there. The consequence of 
this is evident; the growth must preponderate on that face, since there 
the mother liquor will become supersaturated })efore being so for the 
others. We may make this result understood in another wa}. Each 
face of the crystal in contact with the mother liipior is exposed to tw^o 
antagonistic effects: The matter deposited upon a surface may betaken 
away and redissolved if, for any reason whatever, such matter becomes 
more soluble with reference to the liquid stratum in contact with it; 
in the second place, the matter of that liquid stratum may under con- 
trary conditions be deposited and thus increase the body of the crystal. 
There is, then, for each point of the crystalline facet, a positive oper- 
ation of deposit which results in a gain and a negative operation of 
redissolution which results in a loss. One or the other effect predom- 
inates according as the relative solubility is greater or less tor the 
matter of the facet under consideration. On the nuitilated surface it 
is diminished; deposition then prevails. But this is only the imme- 
diate cause of the phenomenon, and if we wish to know why the solu- 
bility has diminished on the mutilated surface M. Ostwald will explain 
it to us by showing that crystallization tends to form a polyhedron in 
which the .surface energy is a minimum relative. 



422 THE LIFE OF MATTER. 

VI. 

NUTRITION IN THE LIVIN(I BEING AND IN THE CRYSTAL. 

It has been said with justice tliat the property of nutrition may be 
considered as the most characteristic and essential one of living- beings. 
Such beings are in a state of continual exchange with the surrounding- 
medium. They assimilate and disassimilate. By assimilation the 
substance of their })eing increases at the expense of the surrounding- 
alimentary matei'ial, which is rendered similar to that of the being 
itself. 

Af<x!iiill<ition and (jrointh in the cryxtal. — There exists in the crystal 
a property analogous to nutrition, a sort of nutrility, Avhich is the 
rudiment of this fundamental property of living beings. The develop- 
ment of a crystal starts from a primiti\'e nucleus, the germ of the 
crystalline individual that we will shortly conjpare to the ovum or 
embryo of a plant or an animal. Placed in a suitable culture medium — 
that is to say, in a solution of the su))stance — this germ goes on to 
develop. It assimilates the matter in solution, incorporates the parti- 
cles of it, and increases, preserving at the same time its form, repro- 
ducing its specific type or a variety of it. Its growth proceeds without 
interruption. The crystalline individual may attain quite a large size 
if we know how to properly nourish it — we might say, to purvey to it. 
Very frequently, at a given time, a new particle of the crystal serves 
in its turn as a primitive nucleus, and becomes the point of departure 
for a 'new crystal engrafted upon the first. 

Taken from its mother liquor, placed where it can not be nourished, 
the crystal, arrested in its growth, assumes a state of rest which is not 
without analogy with that of a seed or of a revivified animal. It 
awaits the return of favorable conditions, the l)atii of solu])le matter, 
in order to resume its evolution. 

The crystal is in a relation of continual exchang«Mvith th(> surround- 
ing medium, which feeds it. These exchang(\s are regulated l)v the state 
of this medium, or, more exactly, ])y the state of the liciuid stratum 
which is in inmiediate contact with the crystal. It loses or it gains in 
su])stancc if, for example, that layer becomes heated or cooled more 
ra})idly than it. In a general way it assimilates or disassimilates 
according as its environment is saturated oi- diluted. There is, then, 
in this a sort of mobile eciuilibriuni. conq)arable, in some May, to that 
of the living being. 

Methods of growth of the cnjdid and of tJie litung hehty — Intnssuscep- 
tlon — Apposition. — In truth, there seems to l)o a complete opposition 
between the crystal and the li\ ing- being as regards their mannei" of 
nutrition and growth. The latter performs this by intussusception; 
the former by appositicMi. The crystalline individual is all surface. 
Its mass is impenetrabh^ to the nutritive materials. Since only the 



THE LIFK OF MATTEE. 423 

surface is accessible, tke incorporation of similar particles is possible 
only l).v exterior juxtaposition,' and the ediiice increases only because 
a new layer of stones has been added to those which were there before. 
On the contrary, the body of tin animal is a mass eminently penetrable. 
The cellular elements that compose it have forms that are more or less 
rounded and flexible. Their contact is by no means perfect. They do 
not have either the stift'ness or the precision of adjustment that the 
crystalline particles have. Li([uids and gases from without can insin- 
uate themselves and circulate within the meshes of this loose construc- 
tion. Assimilation can therefore take place throughout its whole depth, 
and the editice increases because each stone increases by itself. 

The secondary and eo mi no n place character of the process of intussus- 
cept'ion. — The apparent opposition of these two processes is doubtless 
diminished if we compare the simple mineral indixidual with the ele- 
mentary living- unit, the crystalline particle with the protoplasmic 
mass of a cell. AMthout carrying an analysis so far as this, it is yet 
easy to see that apposition and intussusception are mechanical means 
that living beings employ at one and the same time and combine accord- 
ing to their necessities. The hard parts of the interior and exterior 
skeleton increase, ])oth by interposition and superposition at once. It is 
by the last method that bones increase in diameter, and that are formed 
the shells of mollusks, the scales of reptiles and tishes, and the testa of 
many radiate animals. In these organs, as in crystals, life and nutri- 
tion occur at the surface. 

Apposition and intussusception are then secondary, mechanical 
arrangements having relation to the ph^'sical characters of these bodies: 
Solidity in the crystal, semifluidity in the cellular [)rotoplasm. If we 
compare the inorganic liquid matter with the semifluid organized 
matter, we recognize that the addition of substance is made in the same 
manner in each, that is to say, by interposition. If we add a soluble 
salt to a fluid, the molecules of the salt separate and interpose them- 
selves between those of the fluid. There is, therefore, nothing espe- 
cially mysterious or particularly vital about the process of intussus- 
ception. Applied to fluid protoplasm it is mereh^ the diffusion that 
ordinarily occurs in mixed li({uids. 

VII. 

GENERATION IN BUUTK BODIES AND LIVING BODIES— SPONTANEOUS 

GENERATION. 

We have not yet exhausted the analogies between a crystal and the 
living being. The possession of a specitic form, the tendency to 
reestablish it by redintegration and the existence of a sort of nutri- 
tion do not suffice to constitute a complete similarity. It still lacks a 
fundamental character, that of generation. Chaufl'ard, some time ago. 



424 THE LIFE OF MATTER. 

in an attack which he made upon the physiological idea8 of that time, 
characterized the weakness of that point. "Let us disregard," he 
said, "those interesting facts relative to the acquisition of a typical 
form — facts that are common to the mineral world as well as to living 
beings. It is none the less true that the crystalline type is in no way 
derived fi'om other preexisting types, and that nothing in crystalliza- 
tion recalls the actions of ascendants and the laws of heredity." 

Since his time this gap has been filled. The works of Gernez, of 
Violet, of Lecoq de Boisbaudran, the experiments of Ostwald and of 
Tammann, the observations of Crookes and of Armstrong — all this 
series of researches, so well summarized by M. Leo Errera in his 
essays upon philosophical botanj^, had for their result the establish- 
ment of an unsuspected relation between the processes of crystallization 
and those of generation in animals and plants. 

Protoj)lasni is a continuing siihdance — the case of the crystal. — Under 
the conditions of the present time a living being of any kind springs 
from another living being similar to itself. 

Its protoplasm is alwa^'s a continuation of the protoplasm of an 
ancestor. It is an atavic substance which we do not see begin, which 
we onl}^ see continue. The anatomical element comes from a preced- 
ing anatomiciil element, and the superior animal itself comes from a 
preexisting cell of the material organism, the &gg. The ladder of 
filiation reaches back indefinitely into the past. 

We shall see that there is something analogous to this in certain 
crystals. They are born from a preceding individual; they may be 
considered as the posterity of the antecedent crystal. If we speak of 
the matter of a crystal as the matter of a living being is spoken of in 
cases of this kind, we should Ik: led to say that the crystalline sub- 
stance is an atavic substance of which we see oidy the continuation, as 
occurs in the case of protoplasm. 

(Jhm-acterUt'ics of generation in theliringhelng. — Growth of the liv- 
ing substance, and consequently of the being itself, is the fundamental 
law of vitality. Generation is the necessar}" consequence of growth. 

Living elements or cells can not subsist indefinitely without increas- 
ing and multiplying. There is certain to be a time when the cell 
divides, eithei* directly or indirectly, and soon instead of one cell there 
are two. This is the method of generation for the anatomical element. 
In a complex individual it is a more or less restricted part of the 
organism, usuall}' a simple sexual cell, that takes on the formation of 
th(^. new being and consecjuently assures the perpetuit}' of the proto- 
plasm and, through that, of the species. 

Projjertij (f grotcth — Its .'<upposed restriction to living heings. — At 
first it would appear that nothing like this occurs in inanimate nature. 
'The physical machine, if we furnish it matter and energy, would seem 
to go on working indefinitely without h(>ing ol)liged to increase and 



THE LIFE OF MATTER. 425 

reproduce itself. There is, then, in this tin entirely new condition 
peculiiir to the organized being-^ a property well adapted, it would 
seem — and this time without any possible doubt — for separating liv- 
ing matter from brute matter. It is not so. 

It would not be impossible to imagine a system of chemical bodies 
organized like the animal or vegetable economy, so that a destruction 
would be compensated for by a growth. What is imi)ossible is to 
realize the supposition of M. le Dantec, a desti'uction that would at 
the same time be an analysis. And an additional perplexity occurs 
when he supposes that in the successive acts that have taken place 
exchanges of material may occur. 

There is no necessity for making this impossible chemistry a char- 
acteristic of the living being. The chemistry of the living being is 
general chemistry. Berthelot repeated this after Lavoisier. These 
teachings of the masters should not l)e lost sight of by us. 

Let us return to generation, properly so called, and tind there the 
characteristics of brute bodies — of crystals. 

Tlie Hoiving of 'micro-organisms. — When a micro-biologist wishes to 
])ropagate a species of micro-organisms he charges a culture medium 
with a siuall number of individuals (one is all that is actually neces- 
sary) and soon o})sei'ves their rapid multiplication. Usually, if only 
ordinary microbes that exist in atmospheric dust are wanted, the oper- 
ator is not o))ligcd to take the trouble of charging the culture; it' the 
cultui'e tul)e remains open and the medium is suitably choscMi, some 
germ of a common species will fall in and the licjuid will become col- 
onized. This has the appearance of a spontaneous generation. 

The sowing of cnjxUtls. — Concentrated solutions of various sub- 
stances, supersaturated solutions of sulphate of soda, sulphate of 
magnesia, and chlorate of soda are also wonderful culture media for 
certain mineral organic units — certain crystalline germs. Ch. Dufour, 
expin'imenting with water cooled below ' C, its point of solidihca- 
tion, Ostwald, with salol kept below 39.5^, its point of fusion, Tam- 
mann. with betol, which melts at IHi , and, before them, (xernez, with 
melted phosphorus and sulphur — all these pli3\sicists have shown that 
liquids in surfusion are also media specially appropriate for the cul- 
ture and propagation of certain kinds of crystalline individuals. 

Some of these facts have become classic. Lowitz showed in 1785 
that a scjiution of sulphate of soda could be concentrated by evapora- 
tion so as to contain more salt than was conformable with the temper- 
ature, yet without depositing the excess. If, however, a solid 
fragment, a crystal of salt, Avas thrown into the liquor, that excess 
would soon pass into the state of a crystallized mass. The first crys- 
tal engendered a second similar to itself; the latter engendered a 
third, and so on from one to the other. If we compare this phenom- 
enon with that of the rapid multiplication of a speci(\s of microbes in 



426 THE LIFE OF MATTEE. 

a suitable culture medium, but one important difference will be per- 
ceived — the extreme rapidity of propagation of the crystalline germs 
as opposed to the relative slowness of the generation of the micro- 
organisms. 

The crystalline individual gives birth, then, to another individual 
that conforms to its own type, or even to varieties of that type when 
such exist. Into the right branch of a U tube tilled with sulphur in a 
state of surfusion Gernez dropped octahedric crystals of sulphur, and 
into the left branch prismatic crystals. On either side were produced 
new crystals conforming to the type that had been sown. 

StcrHizatloii of eryiitallme media and living mtdia. — Ostwald varied 
these experiments with salol. He melted the substance by heating it 
above 39.5° CI; then, protecting it against an}- crystals, he let the 
solution stand in a closed tube. The salol remained liquid indefi- 
nitely — until it was touched with a platinum wire that had been in 
contact with solid salol; that is to say, until a crystalline germ was 
introduced. But if the platinum wire has been previously sterilized 
after the manner employed l)y l)acteriologists, l)y passing it through 
a flame, it can then be introduced into the liquor with impunity. 

The dimensions of cryst(dline gernis are voinparahle to those of 
iiiicrohes.—'SVe may dilute the solid salol with an inert powder — sugar 
of milk, for exanqjle — dilute the tirst mixture with a second, the sec- 
ond with a third, and so on; then, throwing into the solution of sur- 
fused salol a tenth of a milligram from one of these various mixtures, 
we And that the production of crystals will not take place if the frag- 
ment thrown in weighs less than a millionth of a milligram or meas- 
ures less than ten thousandths of a millimeter on a side. It would 
seem, then, that these are the dimensions of the crystalline particle or 
crystallographic molecule of salol. In the same way Ostwald became 
assured that the crystalline germ of hyposulphite of soda weighs 
about a billionth of a milligram and measures a thousandth of a nuUi- 
meter; that of chlorate of soda weighs a ten-millionth of a milligram. 
These dimensions are entirely com[)arable with those of microbes. 

All these phenomena have been studicnl with a detail into which it 
is impossible to enter here, and which cleai'ly shows more and more 
clos(^ analogies between tlu^ formation of crystals and the generation 
of micro-organisms. 

Extension and ][yiro'pagation of crystallization — Optimum, tempera- 
ture of inciibation. — Crystallization which has commenced around a 
germ is propagated more or less rapidly and ends by in\ading the 
entire liquor. 

The rapidity of this movement of extension depends upon the con- 
ditions of the environment, particularly u])on its temju'rature. This 
is shown very well by the experiments of Tannnann with betol. This 
body, a salicylate of naphthyl. fuses at 9(1' C. If it is meltonl in tubes 



THE LIFE OK MATTER. 427 

sealed at a temperature (vf lOU . it may be cooled to lower and lower 
temperatures, to+7<» , to^-25'-','{o+l'* , to — 5 , without solidifying'. 
Let us suppose that by some combination of circumstances a small num- 
ber of centers of crystallization — that is to say, of crysttdline germs — 
has appeared in the solution. Solidification will extend slowly at the 
ordinary temperaturi's of 20'- to 25" and tho neighboi'hood. On the 
other hand, it will ])e propagated with great rapidity if the liquor is 
kept at about 70 . This point, 70 , is the thermic o})tinunu for the 
propagation of germs. It is the most favora))le temperature for what 
might be called their incubation. As soon as tiie germs tind them- 
selves in a licjuor at 7o they increase, nudtiply. and sho\\ that they 
are in the best conditions for growth. 

Span tcnu Otis generdthni of cry dais — Optimuui toirpiivtiire for the 
apjjeai'antr <f <jt-riiis. — If we consider various supersaturated solu- 
tions or liquids in surfusion, we shall soon discover that they can be 
arranged in two categories. Some remain indefinitely liquid under 
given conditions unless a crystalline germ is introduced into them. 
Others solidify spontaneously without artificial intervention; and such 
crystallization may even be pr-opagated very rapidly under determinate 
conditions. These are for them conditions favoring the spontaneous 
appearance of germs. 

This distinction ])etween substances possessing crystalline gem^ra- 
tion l)y tiliation and substances having crystalline generation that 
arises spontaneously is not specific. The same substance may present 
the two methods of generation according to the conditions in which it 
is placed. Betol furnishes a good example of this. Liquefy it at 
loo in a sealed tube and keep it by means of a stove abo\'(> 30 , and 
it will remain liquid almost indefinitely. On the other hand, lower 
its temperature and leave it for one or two minutes at 10' and germs 
will appear in the liquor; prolong the exposure to this degree of heat 
and the number of these spontaneously appearing germs will rapidly 
increase. On the other hand, 3"Ou will observe that propagation by 
filiation, that is to say, by extension from one to another, is almost 
absent. The temperature of IC-' is not fa\'orable to that method of 
generation, and we have just seen, in fact, that it is at a temperature 
of about 70^ that extension of crystallization from one to another is 
best accomplished. The temperature of 70' was the optimum for 
propagation by filiation. Inversely, the temperature of 10' is the 
optimum for s})ontaneous generation. Above and below this optimum 
the action is slower. We may count the centers of crj^stallization 
which slowl}' extend farther and farther, as in a microbic culture one 
counts the colonies corri'sponding to the germs primitively formed. 
To recapitulate, if there is an optinuun for the formation of crystals 
there is also one^ difi'erent fi'om the tirst, for th«Mr rapid extension. 



428 THE LIFE OF MATTER. 

The irietastable and lahile zones.- — This fact is general. There is for 
each snl)stance a set of conditions (temperature, degree of concen- 
tration, volume of the sohition) in which the cr^'stalline individuals 
can V)e produced oidy l)y germs or by tiiiation. This is what occurs 
for betol above the temperature of 30'. The body is th<Mi in what 
Ostwuld has called a nietastahle zone. There is, however, for the 
same body another set of circumstances more or less complex, in 
which its germs appear spontaneously. This is what happens for betol 
at about the temperature of 10°. These circumstances are those of the 
lah'de zone or of spontaneous generation. 

Crystah of glycerin. — We may g-o a step further. Let us suppose, 
as does L. Errera, that we have a liquid that is found in a state of 
metastable equilil)rium and whose labile equilibrium is yet unknown. 
This is what actuall}^ occurs for a very widel}" known l:)ody, glycerin. 
We do not know under what conditions glvcerin crystallizes spon- 
taneousl3\ If we cool it, it becomes viscous; we can not obtain its 
crystals in that way. We did not even obtain its crystals in any way 
before the year 1867. In that year, in a tun sent from Vienna to 
London during winter, crj^stallized glycerin was found and Crookes 
showed these crystals to the Chemical Society of London. What cir- 
cumstances had determined their formation? We were ignorant of 
them then and are still ignorant of them. It ma}^ be said that this 
case of spontaneous generation of the crystals of glycerin has not 
remained isolated. M. Henninger has noted the accidental foi'mation 
of gl3^cerin cr3^stals in a manufactory^ of St. Denis. 

It may be remarked that this crystalline species appeared, as living 
species may have done, at a given moment in an environment in which 
a favorable chance combined the conditions for its production. It is 
also quite comparable to the creation of a living species; for having 
once appeared, we have been able to perpetuate it. The crystalline 
individuals of 1867 have had a posterity. The}" hav^e been sown in 
glycerin in a state of surfusion and there reproduced themselves. 
These generations have been sufficiently numerous to spread the species 
throughout a great part of Europe. M. Hoogewerf showed numerous 
examples of them filling a great flask to the Dutch naturalists who 
met at Utrecht in 1891. M. L. Errera presented others in June, 1899, 
to the Society of Medical and Natural Sciences at Brussels. To-day 
the great manufactory of Sarg & Co., of Vienna, engages in their pro- 
duction on a grand scale for industrial pur[)oses. 

We have been al)le to study this crystalline species of glj^cerin and 
to determine with precision the conditions which permit it to subsist. 
It has be(>n shown that it does not resist a temperature of 18 , so that 
if precautions were not taken to preserve it, a single suuuuer would 
suffice to annihilate all its crystalline individuals that exist on the 
surface of the globe, and thus extinguish the sp<H-ies. 



THE LIFE OF MATTER. 429 

Possible extinction of a-ci'ystnJUne species.— Kt^ these crystals melt at 
18"^, that toiiiperuture represents the point of fusion of solid glycerin 
or the point of solidification of liquid glycerin. Yet the liquor does 
not solidify at all if its temperature falls below 18'-', nor does it solid- 
ify at zero, nor even at 18"^ below zero, it merely thickens and ))ecomes 
pasty. We only know gh^cerin, then, in a state of surfusion, a fact 
which chemists have not learned without amazement. 

With these conditions, so analogous to the appearance of a living 
species, to its unlimited propagation and to its extinction, the mineral 
world offers a quite faithful counterpart to the animal world. The 
living being illustrates here the history of the brute body and facili- 
tates its exposition, and, inversely, the brute body in its turn thiows 
a remarkable light on the subject of the living body and upon one of 
the most serious problems relative to its origin, that of spontaneous 
generation. 

Conclusion. — These facts lead to a single conclusion. Up to the time 
when the concourse of propitious circumstances favorable to their 
spontaneous generation was brought al)Out, crystals were obtained only 
by filiation. Up to the time of the discovery of electro-magnetism 
magnets were made only by filiation, by means of the simple or double 
application of a preexisting magnet. Before the discovery which fable 
attributes to Prometheus, every new fire was produced onl}- by means 
of a spark deriv(Hl from a preexisting fire. We are at the same his- 
torical stage as regards the living world, and it is for this reason that 
never up to this time has there been formed a single particle of living 
matter except l>y filiation, except by the intervention of a preexisting 
livino- organism.

other manuscripts, we can harcll}^ doubt that craniology was a subject 
in which he was deeply interested, or it would not have held so promi- 
nent a position in this famous picture. It would therefore seem that 
on an occasion such as the present we can do no higher honor to 
Hunter's memory, and to that of some of the able men of science who 
have followed him, than by endeavoring to give, in as few words as 
possible, a resume of their labors, with especial reference to the sub- 
ject of craniology and the light which it is capable of throwing on the 
prehistoric inhabitants of western Europe and of the evolution of the 
race of men to which we belong. One of the most brilliant and orig- 
inal thinkers who have occupied the presidential chair of this college, 
Sir William Lawrence, in his ever memorable lectures on the natural 
history of man, delivered in this college in the year 1819, from his 
researches in comparative anatomy foreshadowed the idea that man 
and apes were derived from common ancestors. Lawrence's opinions 
were received with a storm of adverse criticism. Mr. Abernethy, for 
instance, charged him with "-propagating opinions detrimental to 
society, and endeavoring to enforce them for the purpose of loosening 
those restraints on which the welfare of mankind depend.'' Time, 
however, has proved that Lawrence was right, and in the course 
of lectures delivered in this theater in February, 1891>, Professor 
Keith, from a careful analysis of the maximum number of anatomical 
characters conmion to man and apes, arrived at tlie conclusion that 
they are derived from an identical or a kindred stock. While admitting 
without reserve that man and apes are structurally almost identical, 
nevertheless, as ])()inted out by Professor Huxley in the year 1803, 
thev differ ver}^ material 1}^ as regards the relative size and weight of 
their })rains, as well as in the complexity of its convolutions. The 
carcass of a full-grown gorilla is heavier than that of an average-sized 
European, but it is doubtful whether a healthy adult European's ))rain 
ever weighed less than 32 ounces, or the brain of the heaviest gorilla 
ever exceeded 20 ounces in weight." Although at the present time 
there is this marked relative ditl'erence between the weight of the 
brain and the form of the skulls of Europeans and apes, this was not 
always the case, for the calvaria of the earliest discovered human 
beings were in form not very far removed from those of contemporary 
anthropoid apes. This fact leads us to in((uii(' into the nature of the con- 
ditions which have led to the increased capacity of the human cranium, 
and to the \ast superiorit}^ of man's intelh^ctual endowments over 
those of all the other primates. If we turn to Hunter's prt^i)aratit)ns in 
our museum* we find .among them some reinarka))l(> specimens, which 
he describes as "compressed," "unsynuneti'ical" human crania, 
which he believed were the result of premature consolidation of one

or more of the sutures of tlie skull, l^rofcssor Virchow states that 
''in the too early ossitieation of a suture of the skull the develop- 
nieut of the cranium is arrested in the diameter perpendicular to that 
center/' Since Hunter's day various authorities have devoted much 
time to the subject of the abnormal closure of the cranial sutures in 
man. Prominent among' them are the names of the chief of England's 
craniolog-ists, Drs. Thurnam, Beddoe, and Barnard Davis (the splendid 
collection of prehistoric and other skulls made by the latter g'entleman 
is now in the possession of our college), and we have come to learn 
that the size and shape of the skull depend,- to a large extent, on the 
growth of the bones of which it is formed along the lines of the 
various cranial sutures, a subject to which I have referred at some 
length in my book on The Origin and Character of the British 
People. 

]t is well known that the frontal bone, which forms the vault of the 
anterior part of the cranium in the 3'oung of man and apes, is divided 
by a suture, and so long as this line of growth, together with the cor- 
onal and other sutures l>y which the frontal is separated from sur- 
rounding bones, remains open, the fore part of the skull, and with it 
the anterior fosste which it incloses, c;ui expand. But if the frontal 
and the other anterior sutures of the cranium consolidate early in life 
the fore part of the skull can not increase in capacity l)eyond the size it 
had reached in infancy. Professor Deneker" in his woi-k on the embry- 
ology and development of anthropoid apes has shown that in conse- 
quence of the early closure of the anterior siitures of the skull of these 
animals the foi'c i)art of their brain does not increase beyond the size 
it had attained at the end of the tirst year of life; but in man these 
sutures do not consolidate until a nmdi later period, so that the ante- 
rior lobes of his brain are enabled to expand, and actually become far 
more perfectly developed than the corresponding lobes among anthro- 
poid apes. 

Among these apes, in consequence of the great size of their frontal 
sinuses and the roofs of the or))its rising more oblicjuely into the 
cranial cavity, the anterior and the inferior walls of the anterior fossre 
of their skulls intrude upon and lessen the capacity of this space, and 
therefore of the anterior lobes of the brain which are contained in 
these fossa'.'' Virchow states that ''of all parts of the ape's head, it 
is the brain that grows least;" even "the largest ape keeps its baby 
brain." Although we have not sufficient data to tix the absolute 
duration of the life of anthi-opoid apes, it is doubtfid if they, as a 
rule, attain the age at which man arrives at his full growth. It is,

however, certain tliiit the laroest apes are perfeetlj^ developed when 
man i.s .still in his youth, and that the ape\s l)rain has I'eached perfec- 
tion before the period of shedding- its teeth, while in man it then takes 
its real first step to perfection, men of the same bulk as these apes 
having- four times as uuich siiperficial brain surface." 

Whatever other functions the anterior lol)es of the bi-ain perform, 
the specific structure of their cortical nerve elements, in conjunction 
with those of the other lobes of the brain, controls our associative 
memory and our higher intellectual faculties. If we study the collec- 
tion of preparations of the brains of apes in our museum we nuist 
arriA'e at a similar conclusion to that expressed b}" Professors Edinger 
and D. J. Cunningham, which is that the g^^ri (or convolutions) of the 
l)rain of man and of the anthropoid apes are to a large extent similar 
in anatomical characters, with the marked exception of those con\olu- 
tions which enter into the formation of the frontal lobes. The supe- 
rior and the middle gyri of these lol^es in anthropoid apes are alwa^^s 
much shorter than the}" are in the lirains of average Europeans, and 
what is of especial importance in the brains of anthropoid apes, the 
inferior frontal gyri exist only in a rudimentary condition of devel- 
opment. This deficiency is xevy marked with i-espect to that area of 
the left inferior gyrus which contains the nerve elements which con- 
trol our faculty of articulate language. It seems prol)al)le that the 
rudimentary condition of this gyrus in apes is .therefore the anatom- 
ical expression of the inferiority of these animals to man in intelligence, 
our intellectual development depending mainh' on oui- possessing the 
faculty of speech.'' It may ])e. anthropoid apes having oidy rudimen-

^The Anatomy of the Central Nervous System of Man, Prof. Ludwig Edinger, 
M. D., translated from the fifth (7erman edition hy Prof. W. 8. Hall, 1889, pp. 194, 
210. Edinger remarks that "very gradually the mantle of the embryonic brain 
increases in extent, ascending in the vertebrate series. In the apes belonging to the 
class of j)rimatesit has attained an e.xpansion which l)orders clo.sely on the relations 
found in man. Nevertheless, an important factor, besides more unessential relations, 
still separates it from the stage reached by man. The frontal lobe, still very small 
in the lower apes, attains a large size in the higher apes, but always remains much 
inferior to that of man. In man, even, this developmental process is nowise ter- 
minated as yet. Differences still plainly occur in the region of the frontal lobe 
which allow us to infer the possibility of further perfecting. The inferior region of 
the frontal lobe, which (!ontains the centers of articulate speech, and siiows very 
marked variations in development, is tlie part more particularly concerned." 

Prof. D. .1. Cunningham state.s that "one of tlie most reuiarkal)ie characters of tha 
cerebrum of the chimpanzee and orang is the total absence of the frontal and orbital 
opercula," or the pars triangularis, which contains Broca's nerve center for articulate 
speech. ('()ntril)uti(rtis to the Surface Anatomy of the Cerebral Ilemisplieres, by

reo-ulatc the apiiiiratiis' iicccssarv for the pi-odiu-tioii of articulate 
speech, that the other pai'ts of their anterior lobes lia\(^ reiiiaiiied in 
a comparatively undevelojx'd condition; whercnis the left inferior 
frontal lolte of nian's l)rain haA'in"' l)econie hiohly s])ecialized, and 
with it his })o\ver of language, the other convolutions of liis anterior 
lobes, which govern his intellectual faculties, have been stimulated to 
increased action, and in this way the characteristic expansion of the 
fore brain has been evolved among all the more highly civilized races 
of the human family. 

Hut our contention is that the factors which govern the growth of 
the skull diti'er from those which deveh)p the l)rain, and that the 
im})erfect evolution of the frontal lobes among anthropoid apes is to 
a large extent due to the premature ossification of that part of the 
skull which incloses the fore brain and to the remarkable convexity 
of the orbital plates of thi^ frontal ])one. Howevei" this may be, the 
possession of fully developed anterior lobes of the brain, especially of 
its left inferior gyrus, is the distinctive character of the central ner- 
vous system of all those families of mankind who possess Avell-developed 
intellectual capacities. On the other hand, if we compan^ the skull of 
an Englishman (with a cranial capacity of 1,575) with that of one of 
the natives of northern Australia (with a cranial ca])acity of 1,160), 
we see what a wide diti'erence there is between tlu^ development of 
their frontal regions and also as to the nature of tlie sutures of their 
skulls." (This point is clearly illustrated in the photographs taken from 
the skulls of "" existing races of men,"' as shown in the lower seciion 



"Professor Huxley held that the organization of the human brain had more to do 
with man's intellectual superiority tlian either its weight or size, anil there can be 
no question that men having suiall heads are by no uieans necessarily wanting in 
mental capacity; but a well-developed frontal region is a characteristic feature of all 
the more highly civilized connnunities of the world, and among such i^eople low 
intellectual endowments or even idiocy is found to be comparatively frequent in those 
with abnormally small frontal lobes (see note, p. 103, Man's I'lace in Nature). We 
agree fully with Professor Iluxley that among all the known races of human beings 
the brain and its including case, the skull, grow together, and the former does not 
exercise an absolutely predominating influence over the development of the latter. 
But it is certain that if the anterior part of the skull becomes a " shut i')\" early in 
life, it must control the subsequent size and development of the brain which it con- 
tains. Professor Weh^ker, who studied this subject in a thorough Teutonic spirit, 
arrived at the conclusion that in European races the frontal suture remains opens up 
to the adult period of life in one out of nine persons. Among Afri(;an races it is not 
found open at the adult period of life in more than one in one hundred and fifty 
persons; and among the aborigines of Australia no adult skull has yet been observed 
with an open frontal suture. The well-known French anatomist Gratiolet states as 
a result of his researches that "not only tlu^ growth of the brain ceases sooner in 
those races in which the sutures (dose early, hut also that there is a difference between 
the higher and lower races as to the order in which the sutures :ire closed normally 
In the latter the anterior sutures consolidate before the posterior, and in the higher 
races it is the reverse; the posterior sutures close earlier than the anterior." M. 
Gratiolet Imses an argument for the greater perfectibility of the higher races upon

specimens in our museum that the inhabitants of western Europe in 
the later Tertiary and early Quaternarv period, as regards the ossifi- 
cation and form, especially of tlie frontal region of their skulls, more 
closely resembled that of the chimpanzee than the race of men now 
inha biting P^urope. " 

Since Hunter's and Lawrence's time considerable progress has been 
made in the sciences of geology and anthropology. Nevertheless, in 
our search for knowledge concerning the origin and development of 
prehistoric man in western Europe, we are still hampered l)y the lim- 
ited supply of his remains. It could hardly have been otherwise, 
considering the perishable nature of the human skeleton and the vast 
length of time and the great geological changes which have occurred 
since man appeared in our part of the world. But we have additional 
evidence concerning the prehistoric inhabitants of this part of Europe, 
for they have left us some of their imperishable handiwork in the 
shape of flint and stone implements, which, during- the past century, 
have been carefully studied in relation to the geological strata in 
which the}^ were discovered, by Lord Avebur}^ Professors Bo\'d 
Dawkins and Prestwich, Sir John Evans, the late Sir William Flower,* 
together with many other English and foreig-n anthropologists. A 
few characteristic specimens of these Paleolithic Hint instruments 
which have been unearthed in pre-Glacial and in inter-Glacial forma- 
tions in various parts of F^ngland may be seen on the shelves of our 
uuiseum, which also hold.s casts and the skulls of the Neanderthal group 
of men. From the form and workmanship of these stone implements 
we are now able to classify and assign them to the various periods in 
which they were manufactured ])y the early inhabitants of our part of 
the world.

late Professor Perls, that not a few men of preeminent intelle(>tual power have in 
early life been affected with slight hydrocephalus, which, having abnf)rmally 
e.\'panded their skulls, has then receded. The brain of such young people has been 
al)le to attain a greater capacity than it would have acquired had there been no 
hydrocei)halus to cximnd the skull cap. (The Anatomy of the Central Nervous

Up to within recent times it was held that no human be.ngs existed 
on the earth before the Quaternary geological epoch. But in the year 
1867 the Ahh6 Burgeois exhibited a coIU'ction of chipped flint weapons 
whicli he had discovei'ed in a prt'viously undisturbed Tertiary forma- 
tion; it was not, however, until isTi^ that these instruments were 
admitted to have l)een made by man or some other animal living pre- 
viously to the conunencement of the Quaternai-y |)eriod. Precisely 
similar Hint weapons have siuce been discovered in Tei-tiary strata in 
various localities in Europe, and in Asia. 

In the year 1S!)-I: Dr. Eugene Dubois found tiic upper part of a 
hiuuan skull (calvaria) in close proximity to a fenmr, and two molar 
teeth in a well-defined Tertiary geological formation in the island of 
Java. Dr. Dul)ois was emplo3"ed by the Dutch Government to 
examine and report (»n the fossil-bearing strata of Java, and while 
engaged on this work he discovered embedded in a hard mass of Ter- 
tiary tutis the bones al)ove referred to. He brought these fossils to 
Europe and sul)mitted them for examination to the leading anatomists 
of this and other countries. They concurred in the opinion that the 
femur was a human bone belonging to a man of a very low type, and 
which showed ' " that while it rendered its possessor capable of the bipedal 
mode of locomotion, he still retained some vestiges of adaptation to an 
arl)oreal existence.''" There was a dilierence of opinion concerning 
the calvaria, for it was calculated the capacity of this skidl did not 
exceed S50 c. c. The cranial capacity of the largest anthropoid ape 
is Goo c. c. Until the Java skull was found the earliest known human 
skulls had cranial capacities of about 1,220 c. c. After a complete and 
exhaustive analysis of the anatomical characters of the Java calvaria, 
as compared with the skulls of man and apes. Professor Schwalbc has 
arrived at the conclusion, in which T fully concur, that the Ja\'a skull, 
taking both its form and capacity into consideration, "" is on the border 
line l)etween that of man and anthropoid apes;" it is more closely allied 
to the skulls of th(^ Neanderthal group of men than it is to the ciania 
of the higher apes, but it is much nearer in anatomical characters to 
the skull of the chimpanzee than it is to the cranium of the a\'erage 
adult P^uropeati of the present day.* Nevertheless, from a study of 
the impressions of the convolutions of the brain on the interior of the 
Java calvaria. Dr. Dubois has demonstrated that the inferior gyri of 
the frontal lobes are well marked, and approach in form those of man; 
and although the superficies of this convolution of the brain in the 
Java skull is less than half the dimensions of that of F^uropeans of the 
present day, it is doul)le that possessed b\' the largest known anthro- 
poid ape. This fact suggests that the Jav^a man had in some slight 
degree the faculty of speech, and that his intellectual capacity was

higher than that of any anthropoid ape we are acquainted with." The 
po8tor])ital index, or narrowing of the Java calvaria, is 19.8 as com- 
pared witli an average index of existing Europeans of 12. In this 
respect the Java skull comes nearer to the Neanderthal group than it 
does to that of anthropoid apes; it also possesses indications of the 
existence of that characteristically human feature, frontal eminenc(\s. 

In the employing of skulls which we believe to be the most reliable 
test of human races, we classify them under three heads, according to 
the measurements of their cranial indices; in other words, the meas- 
urement of the greatest breadth of the cranium expressed in percent- 
age of its greatest length is our guide as to the race to which an 
individual belongs from a craniological point of view. When the 
cranial index rises above 80 the head is called l)rachycephalic, a broad 
head; when it falls below 75 the term dolichocephalic, or longhead, is 
applied to it. Indices between 75 and 80 are characterized as meso- 
cephalic, intermediate heads. Assuming the length of the cranium to 
be loo, the width is expressed as a fraction of it, and is known in the 
living su])]'ect as being the cephalic, and in the ])are skull as the cranial 
index. For instance, if the greatest breadth of a skull is 152 mm. 
and its length is 190 mm., we multiply the breadth (152) 1)y 100, and 
divide the product b}^ its length (190), which gives us the cephalic 
index 80. 

We have in our museum casts of two crania and other bones, form- 
ing part of human skeletons which were found resting on a ridge of 
calcareous rock overlooking the river Orneau, in the commune of Sp}', 
Belgium. These remains were unearthed with great care, and there 
is CA'ery reason to believe they were originally deposited Avhere they 
were discovered, b(Mngcoveredover with four well-detined l)edsof dt'bris 
and clay, in which were found the bones of the rhinoceros and the 
mammoth, also Hint wc^apons of the Mousterian epoch.'' One of these 
skulls has characters which resemble those of the higher apcvs, :uul 
assimilate still more nearly to the flava skull, indicating the low tyi)e

'I'he anterior surface of the lower jaw among the existing races of 
Europe projects to foi'in the chin. Among apes the revi^'se is the

those of human beings. They were found in geological formations

It should be clearly understood that up to the present time no bona 
fide human remains belong-ing to the early Paleolithic period haye 
been discovered in western Europe which were not of the same type 
as those above described. 

When the glaciers which had extended over the greater part of 
Europe moved northward, the reindeer j)assed away with them from 
our part of the continent. These animals, which could be easily cap- 
tured by man, had roamed in vast herds over the surface of the coun- 
try, and had pro])ably alforded the human inhabitants of that period, 
living" in western Europe, an ample supply of food. The climate of 
our part of the world at the termination of the Glacial period became 
such as we now experience. Britain was separated from France by 
sea, and fine rivers containing mnnerous fish filled the valleys of our 
land: the red deer, wild horse, and various fieet-footed animals abounded 
in the splendid forests which overspread the country. Rut these ani- 
mals and the fish of our lakes and rivers were not easily captured, and 
the human inhabitants of western Europe were therefore compelled 
to exert their intellectual capacities to an extent not heretofore neces- 
sar}^ in order to supply themselves with food and with the skins of 
animals for clothing. Man was able to overcome the ditticulties he 
had to face, possessing an innate power by means of which, as already 
explained, his brain was able to develop and so meet the increased 
demand made upon it in the struggle for existence. That such was 
the case we judge from the discovery, in geological foimations of the 
Post-Glacial period, of the skulls of men having the same physical type 
as those of the strictly early Paleolithic epoch of western Europe, but 
with increased brain capacity. These Post-Crlacial human skulls indi- 
cate, in my opinion, a gi'adual transition in form from the ape-like 
characters of the previous period to a higher standard, and certainly 
to a much greater skull capacity, esp(>cially in the frontal region, ^^'itil 
this improviMuent in the form of tlu^, human skull, the fiint, stone, 
])one, and horn instruments made by the Post-t Jlacial inhabitants of 
western Eui'ope becoiui^ moi-e highly linished than those bc^jonging to 
the previous age. indicating the posst^ssion of increasing intellectual 
power on the part of those who luadi^ them. 

The Engis skull, of which we have a cast, i)resented to this college 
by Sir Charles Lyell, is a well-known exam])le of a human cranium of 
the early Neolithic" or Post-Glacial period. Huxley, in his dcscrij)- 
tion of this skull, observes, "It takes us at least to the further side of 

"The term Neolitliic is used to signify that period in which the stone, bone, and 
horn iniplenientH made ])y man indicate a consideral)le advance in the arts of life 
beyond thcjse discovered in the previous PaleoHthic ei)och. In the Neolithic period 
the remains of the mammoth, rhinoceros, and other prevalent extinct forms of the 
Paleiilithic series had almost, if not completely, disappeared from western iMirope. 
Tile dei)osits in which these Neolithic remains are found consist of river gravels,

the l)ioloo"ical limit whidi separates the present geolooical epoch from 
that which preceded it:'* that is, from the (ihicial period." The Borris 
skull prol)al)ly also hcUxius to this pei'iod, its charactei's beino- similar 
to the Tilbury cranium described hy Sir Richard Owen, and of which 
we have a cast in our nuiseum. To this list of Post-Glacial — or it may 
be of the later (Uacial — period we may add the Ko-isheim calvaria, 
or so much of it as has been preserved. This specimen, of which 
we have a cast, was discovered in a hii>h river Ijed near Colmar with 
the bones of extinct animals and Mousterian flint weapons. These 
and various other skulls found in ^eoloo-ical formtitions of the time 
referred to are all of tlie same type, and lead us to believe that the 
inhabitants of pAirope in the earl}^ Neolithic j)erio(l consisted of only 
one race — the descendants of the human beings who inhabited our 
part of the world during the previous or Paleolithic epoch. They 
had long (dolichoce})halic) skulls, with slightly projecting supraor])ital 
lidges, well-formed noses, and a fairly developed frontal region as 
compared with the far more ancient Java, Spy, and Neanderthal 
crania. Their mandibles and the bones of their legs were less simian 
in character than those of their remote progenitors. They wore a 
small race of l)eings. We find no metal weapons or instruments with 
their remains, and we therefore conclude that they were ignorant of 
the use either of bronze or of iron, nor do they seem to have possessed 
domestic animals or to have had any knowledge of agriculture. 

This race of primiti\e iidiabitants of western Euro])e are best 
described as the I])erians, and we may conveniently employ this term 
so long as it is understood to d(>signate the At'rico-P^uropean stock, 
who were, so far as we know, the sole human inhabitants of western 
Europe after the termination of the (xlacial epoch. 

As we pass from the early to the mid-Neolithic epoch, we come 
upon the remains of a race of uhmi who, as regards their physical 
character and state of civilization, essentially difl'er from the people 
above referred to. The stone implements found with their skeletons 
aie beautifully formed, many of them ))eing highly polislKnl and hav- 
ing shar}) cutting edges. A few of the ])urest bronz(> ax heads have 
been discovered with these remains, and also the bones of domestic 
anhnals belonging to species indigenous to Asia, but foreign to the 
Paleolithic fauna of Europe. Lastly, we have evidence that these 
people were acquainted with agi'iculture ;ind with the mamifacture of 
sun-dried pottery. They paid great respect to their dead chiefs, 
burj'ing their l)odies in natural caves, or in tombs formed of huge 
flagstones placed edgewise side by side, with similar stones laid on 
the upright ones to form the roof of the building. These structures, 
the well-known long dolmens, have been found, built on .precisely the

same plan, in Ireland, England, the greater part of Europe, the west 
of Asia, India, Arabia, and northern Africa. The construction of 
these dolmens, wherever met with, is so similar in style that we 
conclude the}^ were the work of one race, or at least of one special 
confederacy of races. They were not onl}" sepulchers for tlu^ dead, 
but many of them also contained an altar, a place of mourning and of 
offering, where intercession was made to the spirits of departed chiefs 
by their relations and tribesmen. The Rodmarton long dolmen or 
temple toml) (near Cirencester) affords us a good example of one of 
these structures; it is 180 feet in length and TO feet l)road. We have 
in our museum a fine human skull which was found in this dolmen, 
with sonu^ well-polished stone implements. If we compare this skull 
with that of the fJava or the Neanderthal grou)3 of men or with the 
skulls of the early Neolithic human inhabitants of western Europe, 
we are struck by the marked difference that exists between them and 
the Rodmarton skull. Dr. Thurnam's unique collection of crania may 
be seen in the Anatomical Museum, Cambridge. These crania for the 
most part were unearthed by himself from various English long 
dolmens and barrows, and they resemble in form, although thc}^ are 
of a higher t3^pe than, the skulls found in the caves of Cro-Magnon 
and Mentone; they are identical in character with skulls found in the 
long dolmens of France and other countries of Europe. The cranial 
index, capacity, and other features of the bones of these skulls lead us 
to assign them all to one and the same race, of which the Cro-Magnon 
are probably some of the earliest specimens as yet discovered in 
western Europe. The three Cro-Magnon and three Mentone skele- 
tons were those of people some feet 4 inches and upward in stature, 
so that a race of giants in far distant times was no myth. Their 
cranial ca])acity was above that of the average Europeans of the 
present day. From their physical conformation and from th(^ I'cmains 
of the animals found buried with th(>m. which are of Asiatic species, 
and from other c\idence, we arc led to the conclusion that the Cro- 
Magnon race represent the advance guard of the proto-Ai-yan human 
family, of which tlu^ Rodmarton" and many other long dohnen skulls 
show a more advanced type. Tiu^si^ people in far distant ages migrated 
from t\\o East into western Euroi)e, and from thence spread into our 
islands; southward they passed into India, Persia and Arabia, Asia 
Minor, and northern Africa. Over this vast area and far away in 
eastern Asia we find their remains, with Hint and stone implemcMits of 
the early Neolithic type, buried in long dolmens or barrows. The 
roots of many of the words used by this ancient people exist in most

of the liinyiiaoe.s now s^joken in Europe; their religious .sentiments, 
myths, and. above all, their racial, mental, and physical characters, as 
portrayed in the Rio-Veda and on the ancient monuments of Egypt, 
are pronounced features in the existing Teutonic and Anglo-Saxon 
people. Erom the form of the crania found in many of these long 
dolmens we know that this tall, fair, handsome, long-skulled race 
intermarried with the preexisting short, dark Ih(»rian inhal)itant,s of 
Europe. The fair,. tall race probably did not at any time, unless in 
the north of Europe, form a large proportion of the po])ulation. They 
were a dominating, lighting, and priestly caste, who compelled the 
pi'imitive. small, dark (Ibei'iati) iidiabitants of western Europe to 
work as their sla\'es. 

During the Neolithic era. while the descendants of the })roto-Aryan 
stock were slowly feeling theii' way from the East along the valley t)f 
the I)amd)e into Europe, a very diti'erent race were ])assing from 
northern Asia into the Baltic provinces. These peo})h' foi-med settle- 
ments on tile islands of Demuark and westward as far as the north 
of Ireland. They were the lirst of the broad-skulled races of the 
human family who had entered Europe. Their skulls were brachy- 
cephalic in foi'in. with l)road faces and noses, the latter being deeply 
concave at the base. Their remains are found in the islands of Den- 
mark, especially that of Moen.also in Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Statlord- 
shire," and in Cos. Antrim and Tyrone,-' in which localities their 
descendants may still be recognized l>y their physical characters. 
The_y l)ui'i<Ml their dead and did not practice cremation, as did the 
Mongolians of the l)ronze age in Europe. These people belonged to 
the ston(> age of Europe, and by compai'ing their skulls with those of 
the Kodmarton or Cro-Magnon crania we see the great diti'erence in 
form of the j)r(diistoric long and the broad-headed races of men. 

Cntil the close, therefore, of the Neolithic epoch there were three 
])ure races who formed the sole luiman inhabitants of Europe, so far 
as we can judge from theii" sknlls and othei' remains, with the excep- 
tion of those who were the outcome of th(^ intcM-marriage of these 
three races of people with one another. 

Passing fi'oin the Neolithic to the succeeding bronze age, we believe 
that Europe was overrun by a small, broad-skulled people ha\ing 
characteristic Mongoloid featui'cs. These people were probably, in 
their Asiatic home, originally derived from th(> same stock as tlu^ tall, 
fair, broad-skulled North Mongolian race above referred to. But the 
southern Mongoloid people of the bronze age in Europe were a small 
race of men with dark liair and eyes. These were the early lalce 
dwellers of Switzerland and other parts of Europe. Prof. A. C.

444 THE CRANIOLOGY OF MAN AND ANTHROPOID APES. 

Haddon i.s disposed to thiuk that before their arrival in our ishiiids 
these people had beconie a mixed stock through intermarriage with the 
Iberian or Mediterranean race. (In the dolmen at Meudon we find 
the remains of a man of the broad and a woman of the long skulled 
race placed side b}^ side.) They were traders in bronze, and probal)ly, 
as Prof. G. Mortillet and other authorities hold, gradually replaced 
stone, horn, and bone with bronze instruments and weapons, eti'ecting 
in this way a great revolution in the social and industrial habits of the 
preexisting inhabitants of western Europe. In these far distant times 
deep mining operations were out of the (Question. Superficial ores of 
copper were abundant in most parts of Europe and in Asia, but alluvial 
tin was extremely scarce, and it is still only found in large quantities 
in southeastern Asia. Cornwall, the Sciily Isles, the south of Ireland, 
and some few other places on our continent also contained superficial 
ores of tin. It seems probable that the Mongolians inhabiting the high- 
lands of southeastern Tibet, long before the commencement of the 
bronze age in Europe, spread into Burma, the Malay Peninsula, and 
Cochin China, and there acquired the art of mixing copper and tin in 
such prop(jrtions as to form bronze, the weapons and instruments 
which they manufactured of this metal being a ready and profitable 
source of barter in Europe. These people, without doubt, made 
bronze weapons both in the south of England and of Ireland, for clay 
molds have been found there in which weapons of the early ]>ronze 
period in Europe were cast. 

Togeth(n" with the broad skulls and other remains of these people 
we find in the debris of the lake dwellings numerous ornaments of 
jade, nephrite, and chloromelanite, minerals found in large quantities 
in southeastern Asia, ])ut not in Europe; and lasth', vases on which 
are depicted people in Oriental costume, and instruments used onl}' l)y 
the soutlieastern Tibetans have been discovered in connection with the 
remains of the lake dwellers. It is almost unnecessary to remark that, 
althougii many millions of Hindus iia\ (> in successive periods occupied 
the greater j)art of PxMigal, it wouhl be impossible to discover their 
bones in the soil, for the simple reason that they ha\e either burnt the 
bodies of their dead or else cast them into one of the sacred rivers of 
India. And so it is with the skeletons of these southern Mongoloid 
people of the bronze age in Europe. As a rule their Inxlies were cre- 
mated after death, and numerous cinerary urns containing their 
remains are found scattered over the Wiltshire and other ranges of 
hiUs in the south of England. Some few of their skeletons, however, 
have been found in the round barrows which are so numerous, espe- 
cially in the south of England, of Ireland, and throughout various other 
parts of Europe, and in Asia. With these remains and cinerary urns 
very man}^ bronze instruments have been met with, indicating, like 
the stone implements of .the Palaeolithic period, dift'erent stages of

excellence in workniannhip." The size of the hundles of the bronze 
knives and other weapons, as well as the bangles, prove that the peo- 
ple who used them were a small race of men and women, we believe 
best represented in Europe by the prehistoric short inhabitants of 
AuvevgneJ' 

One of the finest skulls m our nuiseum was taken from a round ])ar- 
row at Codford, Wilts, and although this skull must be at least live 
thousand years old it still seems as if it were full of life and fun (see 
illustration), characteristic features of the race to which it belonged. 
The form of this 1)rachycephalic skull, together with its nasal bones 
and orlnts, are clearl}^ Mongoloid in character, and nvo well known to 
those of us who have lived in India as representing the Ghurkhas 
and Burmese of the present day. A lazy, bright, rollicking people, 
intensely superstitious and home loving — "the Irish of the East," as 
they have been aptly called. In the course of many centuries the 
southern Mongolian people of western Europe have unquestiona])ly 
become absorbed into the preexisting Ibero-Aryan population: a cross 
breed has resulted, and from this stock the ancient British people of 
our islands were derived. Their skulls are mesocephalic (a comlnna- 
tion of the long and l>road skull), and are amply represented in our 
nuiseum. the cephalic indices being about seventy-eight.'' Sul)se<|uent 
to the bronze age the ancient Britons were well-nigh exterminated in 
England by Teutonic races, who in\'aded oui' country from the north 
of Europe, the Anglo-Saxons taking the })lace of the preexisting 
ancient British population of England and Scotland. Nevertheless, 
in some districts of England, sucli as North BtMlfordshire, a luuuber 
of the descendants of the ancient British stock contiiuie to tlourish up 
to the present day, as also in the greater part of South ^^'ales, nuich 
of Cornwall, and the south iuid west of Ireland, the upper classes in 
Ireland being clearly derived from the ancient Aryan stock who passed 
fi'om Gallia into that country during the Neolithic period. The illus- 
trations show a characteristic head and face of one of the desciMidants 
of the ancient British race and also of a typical Anglo-Saxon. 

Passing from prehistoric to the present time, we have come to pos- 
sess the measurements of the heads of some 25, ()()(), 00<» of the existing 
inhabitants of Europe.'' Eroiu these nu^asurements we learn that a 
large })r()p()rti()n of the people now dwelling in the countries Ijorder- 
ing on the Mediterranean Sea are a short, brunette, long-skulled race,

descended, we l)elieve, from those who, from the form of their skulls 
and other physical characters, occupied that part of P^urope and the 
north of Africa in far distant a*»"es — the Iberian race, 

Scandinavia and North German^' are inhabited bj- a tall, fair, lon^- 
skulled people derived from the proto- Aryan races who settled in that 
part of our continent in the Neolithic epoch. A vast triangle having 
its base in eastern Russia and its apex on the Atlantic in southwestern 
France is inhabited by the broad-skulled people derived from Mon- 
goloid or Turanian ancestors. We do not for a moment affirm that 
these races, as such, have remained pure — far from it; ])ut the results 
of the measurements of the heads of a great number of the existing 
inhabitants of Europe point to the conclusions above indicated; and 
this idea is confirmed by the cranial indices of the splendid collection 
of crania which occupy so large a space in the museum of this college — 
a collection which was commenced by John Hunter, and upon which 
during the past century a great amount of time and labor has been 
spent in describing and classifying the skulls which it contains." Our 
collection has been added to and kept well up to date b}^ Prof. C. 
Stewart, and might, 1 think, with advantage to science, be utilized in 
an eli'ort to solve the debatable question of the connection l>etween the 
Neanderthal group of men and the postglacial inhabitants of western 
Europe. 

The characteristic physical type of paleolithic man may be still 
recognized among the inhabitants of western P^urope, although their 
skulls have grown more capacious, especially in the frontal region. 
This change in the form of the ci'anium marks a corresponding advance 
in the capacit}^ and organization of the ])rain and of the intellectual 
ability of man; it is in truth evidence of his inherent power to over- 
come the demand made on his mental capacity in order to cope success- 
fully with his ever-increasing struggle for existence, i-onsequent on 
the growth in number of his fellow-creature!^ and the more compli- 
cated social conditions of his surroundings. Doubtless the form of 
skull of a large proportion of the inhabitants of our island indicates a 
cross breed formed by the intermarriage of the long and broad skulled 
families of man who in distant ages met and intermarried in western 
Europe, thereljy improving the stock of their descendants. Races of 
men, such as the natives of Australia, who have remained in an 
unchanged environnunit and without intermarriage with other people, 
have made but little progress in their intellectual capacity, the form 
of their skulls continuing of the same type as those possessed by the 
paleolithic inhabitants of Europe. 

" We have about 4,000 skulls in our inusciuu, arnuij^'cd according: to the eountries of 
which they are presumably native. All these specimens have been accurately meas- 
ured and described in our catalogue, either by Sir W. Flower or by Mr. L. McAra, 
under Prof. C. Stewart's supervision. 



THE CRANIOLOGY OF MAN AND ANTHKOPOID APES. 447 

The same causes to whiclrwe have referi'ed, acting for long periods 
of time on people of the sainC' race, have not only led to the heredi- 
tary transmission of their physical characters, such as thosc^ existing 
respectively among thi^ northern, central, and southern inhabitants of 
Europe, but have also developed specialized areas of nerve structure 
in their l»rains, by means of which they have come to think, feel, and 
reason alike; thus having an inherent, widely-ditfused individuality. 
In this way we are able to comprehend the source and the meaning of 
hirge bodies of men ])elonging to the same race being freiiuently 
moved to take conunon action on matters affecting the well-being of 
their race; they possess, in fact, like innate sentiments, or racial char- 
acteristics, although separated from one another by great distances 
and living undei' diverse climates and environment. Their emotions 
and ideals harmonize, because their progenitors existed for many ages 
under similar external conditions, and consequently developed like 
specialized nerve centers, which have been transmitted, together with 
their physical characters, to their successors, and become crystallized 
in their laws, and reflected in their conceptions of religion as well as 
in their social institutions." 

In illustration of our meaning we may refer to those revolting 
l)ages of history during which Belgium and the Netherlands passed 
under the dominion of Spain, the Iberian dominating foi" the time 
being over a thoroughly Teutonic race. Or we may contrast the (wist- 
ing condition of the Iberian ])opulation of Soutli America with the 
Teutonic Anglo-Saxon inhabitants of the I'^nited States, or that of the 
latter with the negro population of America. 

We have a chart here which shows the result of the recent general 
election held in this country; the question at issue was one in which 
the whole of tlu> people of Great Britain w<>re deeply int(M-ested. It 
is i-emarkable what a large proportion of the inhal)itants of England 
ana of Scotland, mainly of Anglo-Saxon origin, voted together on this 
sulqect: whereas a contrary opinion regarding this same question was 
held by the gueater })roportion of the people of Ireland, and to a large 
extent by th(> Welsh, most of whom are derived from Ibero-Mongolian 
ancestors. It is difficult to account for the diversity in the sentiments 
of the people above referred to, unless we consider it due to their 
racial mental qualities.'' Environment has doubtless ])laye<l an impor-

*This idea is confirmed by tlie result of the elections that have lately taken i)lace 
in Canada and in the United States of America. The younger brandies of our Anglo- 
Saxon race, forming by far the larger proportion of the inhabitants of these vast and 
riourishing dominions, had to solve a similar (piestion to that ])laced before the ])eo- 
ple of (ireat Britain, and they have res]>ondi'd by a vast majority to this call, on 
precisely the same* lines as those follo\vf<l hy Knglishmen, moved, \v<^ believe, by 
common racial inherent sentiments.

tant part in the evolution of these people, but their inherited racial 
character has had more to do with the position which the Anglo-Saxon 
race has gained in the world than the mineral wealth, climate, or 
protection afforded us b}' our seagirt coast. 

The environment under which even a few generations of men exist 
would seem capable of influencing the structure of their central nerv- 
ous system, as illustrated by comparing the mental qualities of our 
rural and urban population. The conditions under whicli the cit}'- 
bred child and man live engender in the course of a few generations 
an unstal)le state of nerve structure, resulting in an excitable charac- 
ter, which, if carried beyond a certain point, leads to unsoundness of 
mind, and may account for the increasing number of lunatics in this 
and the other large cities of Europe. Gen. Sir Redvers Buller again, 
in speaking of the soldiers under his command in South Africa, refers 
to the fact that our city-born men have imperfect sight compared with 
men reared in the open plains of the Transvaal, thus affording us 
another example of the effects of environment on the race." These 
are a few of the many interesting and important subjects which arise 
in connection with the study of anthropology, including craniology; 
and the contents of our museum and library offer unrivaled oppor- 
tunities to the student seeking for knowledge in these branches of 
.science. 

In conclusion, as already stated, much of Hunter's reputation was 
founded on the result of his lal)ors in those ])ranches of science which 
tend to elucidate man's nature; and during the past century a succes- 
sion of English surgeons have carried on the work commenced by our 
great master, enriching our museum and endeavoi'ing to make this 
college not only an examining and licensing body, but what it cer- 
tainly should be — an imperial institution for the cultivation and diffu- 
sion of those departments of knowledge which l)ear on comparative 
anatomy, physiology, or surger}'. The ideas entertained by John 
Hunter's immediate successors on this subject were ably stated by Sir 
William Lawrence, in his lectui-es already referred to. when he 
observes that " our own individual credit and the dignity, honor, and 
reputation of our body, which we are bound to maintain, demand that 
surgeons should not be behind any other class of the community in 
the possession either of the cultivation of those branches of knowl- 
edge which are direct!}'' connected Avith surgery or in any of the col- 

«Sir Redvers Buller in one of his speeches is reported to have stated that "in the 
first instance, many of our men are city born, and England is not a very large coun- 
try. We went out to a region where the ])rincipal number of our enemies were 
born in a very open country, a very large country, and it is not untrue to say that 
practically the vision, the ordinary sight, of otu" enemy was 2 miles, at least, farther 
than the average sight of the English who were fighting against them. That is a 
matter of actual isuit. An ordinary Dutchman or African can see a man coming 
toward him 2 miles before the man approaching c3,n detect him."

liiteial pursuits less iiHHiecTiateh' .ittached to it." Sir William con- 
tinues: ''It is only in reference to such views and objects that the 
Hunterian collection could have been accepted or can be of any use to 
this college."" Huute^r would, had he still been with us, have thrown 
all his indomitable energies into the successful working of such an 
institution, and amidst the turmoil, strife, and competition going on 
around him, would, as we see him in this picture, have been engaged 
in the earnest, accurate, patient study of nature. It remains for our 
younger members to emulate the example set them by flohn Hunter, 
and by such service secure for themselves lasting satisfaction and add 
to the real dignity and utility of this college and of their profession.

THE BAOUSSE-ROUSSE EXPLORATIONS: STUDY OF A 
NEW HUMAN TYPE, BY M. VERNEAU.« 



By Albert Cf audrt, 

Member of the Institute of France. 



The Prince of Monaco deli*^hts not only in exploring- the depths of 
the oceans of to-day, he also loves to explore the depths of the past. 
He has undertaken to excavate the Baousse-Rousse on so vast a scale 
that the place is destined to throw much lig-ht on the history of primi- 
tive man. 

The name Baousse-Rousse (Red Rock) is well known to scientists since 
the discoveries of M. Emile Riviere. A largo quantity of material 
has been taken from its various grottoes; in one of them was found 
the celebrated skeleton of the Jardin des Plantes, known as the Man of 
Mentone. The Prince of Monaco enlisted as his assistants several 
French scientists: The Abbe do Villeneuve methodically directs the 
excavations, removing each stratum separatel}^ so as to clearly estab- 
lish the succession of the phases of prehistoric times; M. Marcelin 
Boule, so well versed in quaternary paleontology, assumes the exam- 
ination of the various fossil animals; M. Emile Cartailhac, the eminent 
corresponding' mem])er of the Institute, works at unearthing the human 
skeletons which M. Verneau, the assistant of M. Hamy at the Museum, 
is studying w^ith his usual skill. It would l)e impossible to bring 
together scientists more capable of successfully carrying out the great 
enterprise of the Prince of Monaco. 

One of the grottoes in particular has furnished to the Abbe de Ville- 
neuve results of considerable importance. This is the Grotto des 
Enfants, so called because, in 18Ti,M. Emile Riviere discovered there 
two skeletons of children which to-day are in the collection of the 
Catholic Institute directed by M. de Lapparent. In the accompany- 
ing figure (see p. 452) there is shown a section of the various do- 
posits and levels of domestic occupation down to the rocky floor of 
the grotto. In the flrst seven meters the Ahbc de Villeneuve found 
abundant remains of animals, human utensils, and ev(Mi two human 
skeletons. Thes(^, specimens added nothing particularly new to what

had already been found in the Baousse-Rou.sse by MM. Emile Riviere, 
Verneau, and others. At the depth of 7 meters and below, however, 
M. de Villeneuve made some curious discoveries whose true value has 
been brought out by the discernino- mind of Dr. Verneau. At that 
level there is a stratum in which are found the remains of the cave 
hyena and Mousterian implements." Nothing- is disturbed, and we 
are therefore certain that we are well within the paleolithic age. 
Here the Al^bo de Villeneuve has wholly uncovered what he calls a 
double sepulture. As shown in the accompany ing plate, there are 
two skeletons — one that of an old woman, the other that of a young 
man — placed side by side, in a perfect state of preservation, the limbs

of the cave hyena whose descendants inha]>it southern Africa, there 
are found human remains with crania having- in the lower part negro 
characteristics, in the upper those of th(^ white race. Is it possible 
that Dr. Verneau has found a connecting link between the Afi'ican 
and the Caucasian types, and that we have here the skeletons of two 
beings who represented this transition? Such a conclusion would be 
premature, but we ma}' at least say that he has foiuid a negroid ele-

FOSSIL HUMAN REMAINS FOUND NEAR LANSING, 

KANSAS." 



By W. H. Holmes. 



The fo.ssil remains of two hunian being's were discovered while 
diogino- a cellar tunnel for the storage of fruit on the farm of Mr. 
Martin Concannon, near Lansing, Kansas, in February, 1902. During 
the past summer the site was visited b>' a number of geologists, arche- 
ologists, and others interested in the history and antiquity of man in 
America, and alread}' several more or less elaljorate accounts of the 
discovery have been published in our scientific joui'nals. The last and 
by far the most critical study is that of Prof. T. C. Chamberlin, which 
appeared in the Journal of Geology for October and November, 1902. 
Other papers are b}^ Prof. S. W. Williston (Science, AugUf,t 1), Mr. 
Warren Upham (Science, August 29; also American Geologist, Sep- 
tember), and Prof. N. H. Winchell (American Geologist, Septem])er). 

1 had the good fortune to accompany Professor Chamberlin on his 
first visit to the site, and to meet there also Prof. R. D. Salisbury, 
Prof. Samuel Calvin, Dr. Erasnms Haworth, Dr. George A. Dorsey, 
and Mr. M. C. Long. Careful examinations were made of the tunnel 
and of the geological formations in the vicinity, as well as of the 
cranium preserved in the Kansas C-ity Museum, and it was found that 
the accounts of the discovery previously published were essentially 
correct in every important particular. The human remains consist of 
a skull and a number of the larger bones of an adult man and the 
lower jaw of a child of some ten years. 

Owing to the difficulty of studjnng the formations in the tunnel, 
already well tilled with farm [)roducts at the time of our visit, tiic idea 
of making additional excavations was suggested, and through the kind 
offices of Mr. Long it was arranged with Mr. Concannon that the 
Bureau of American Ethnology should undertake this work. Mr. 
Gerard Fowke, who, under my supervision, had been conducting 
researches in the well-known fossil bone beds of Kinnnswick, Missouri, 
was called in. and during the month of October a trench was opened 
into the relic-bearing deposits from the west at right angles to the

tunnel cluji; by the Concannon^^, expo.sing- the full depth of the deposits 
for a horizontal distance of about 40 feet. Besides this the main 
cellar tunnel was carried some 12 feet farther, and a chanilier was 
excavated on the east side of the tunnel, opposite the point where the 
remains of the man were found. When this work was completed 
Professor Chamberlin joined me in a second visit to the site, and 
examinations of all the phenomena were made under the most favor- 
able conditions. 

In the following- brief summary 1 rely for geological interpretations 
largely on the views of Professor Chamberlin, whose mastery of the 
intricate problems of glacial and post-glacial geology is everj^where 
acknowledged. 

The remains were found })eneath 20 feet of undisturbed deposits 
forming a little bench on which the Concannon dwelling stands. The 
child's jaw was encountered about 00 feet from the entrance of the 
tunnel and the skull of the man 10 feet farther in. There can be no 
doubt of the correctness of these observations. 

The skull is well preserved and corresponds closely in type with 
crania of the historic Indians of the general region. It presents no 
unique features and oifers no suggestion of great age or of inferior 
organization. Front and back views are presented in PI. I and profile 
and top views in PI. II. Its characteristics are briefly summarized by 
Dr. Dorsey as follows: 

"The specimen, after such reparation as has been possible, lacks all 
the bones of the face and small i)ortionsof the occipital, temporal, and 
frontal bones; hence no observations are possil^le on the face or hase 
of the skull. 

"The ])ones are firm, hard, and comparatively thin. The sutures 
are moderately serrated, 

"From above the skull is ovoidal in form, with somewhat Inilging 
parietals and occiput. The glabella is only fairly high; the supra- 
orbital ridges near the glabella are well marked. The forehead retreats 
gradually and is uniformly convex. The vault reaches a considerable 
height and retr(>ats rapidly to near inion. The occipital region ))ulges 
decidedly. 

"The t(Mnporal lines are fairly well marked, l)ut not pronounced, 
and extend slightly above the middle of the parietals. The mastoids, 
though nuich damaged, were evidently not al)()ve medium. The occip- 
ital ridges, with the exception of the superior one. and the ordinary 
occipital depressions are very faint. 

"The skull is of an individual probably from 40 to 5(> years of age, 
and, I am inclined to believe, that of a male. In its general shape the 
skull b(nirs a striking resemblance to the crania of the Plains Indians, 
foi' (^xample, the Blackfoot. Its measurements are as follows: 

"Maxiiniiiii lenu;th 1S9 mm.

the aii'e of the fonnations witii which the remains were nssociated. and

to thi.s point 1 shall give chief attention. The bench occupied by the 
Concannon dwelling" is sqiiarish in outline, having- a horizontal extent 
of about 150 feet from ea.st to west and perhaps IHO feet from north 
to south, and its highest point is about 3<> feet above the present flood 
plain of the river (see tig. 2). It rests against the base of a limestone 
spur of the river blutf, on the south side of a little valley that opens 
out into the river bottom at this point. The upper surface of the 
bench slopes away at a low angle from its junction with the limestone 
spur (a). Facing the river it presents a steep slope continuous with 
the face of the river blutf. On the north it descends abruptly to the 
bed of the rivulet, and on the west the slope is somewhat gentle to the 
small lateral valley on that side.

An excellent photographic view of the Concannon trench is given in

of the little stream that passes out to the river bottom at this point. 
The entrance to the cellar tunnel is well marked by the figure of a 
lady near the center of the picture. The point of view is so low 
that the promontory which rises behind the terrace does not appear. 
The trench made by the Rureau entered the l)ench a few feet l)eyond 
the gate seen in the picture.

The cellar tunnel enters the north face of the bench near the base 
ijj, figs. 1 and 2). The skull was found at f, 70 feet from the entrance, 
20 feet from the upper surface of the terrace, and about IS inches 
above the floor of the tunnel. The lateral trench is indicated at d in 
both illustrations. 

The deposits composing the bench, so far as exposed, rest on the 
nearly level surface of a stratum of Carboniferous limestone {e-e)^ and 
the tunnel is dug so that this surface forms its floor. The deposits are 
believed hy some to be true alluvial loess, derived directly from the 
ice front in the valleys above; they would thus represent one of the 
Glacial stages. Others regard them as consisting of finely comminuted 
material derived from the loess beds of the neighboring slopes and of 
other coarser materials from the hillsides spread out in comparatively 
recent times ])y local agencies in and about the entrance to the little 
valley. The first of these views has been adopted by Prof. S. W. 
Williston, Mr. Wairen Upham, and Prof. N. H. Winchell; and the sec- 
ond is held by Prof. T. C. Chamberlin, Prof. R. D. Salis])ury, and Dr.

Samuel Calvin. I am inclined to favor this latter view, not only because 
it appears to be sustained ])y the geological evidence, but because it is 
in harmony with what we already know of the history of man in 
America. The skull corresponds in type with crania of the historic 
occupants of the region — the Indian tribes — which fact carries with it, 
according to the view of some biologists, a presunn)tion against its 
great antiquity; and again, there is as yet no substantial and unecjuiv- 
ocal evidence that men of any race existed in America during the 
(xlacial period. 

The geological features of the site, in so far as they relate io the 
(juestion of human occupancy, may be briefl}^ reviewed and their inter- 
pretation may be presented in the same connection. The first step in 
the histoi-y of the site re(|uiring attention is the exposure or partial 
exposure of the nearl}^ level limestone floor on which the materials of

the Concaunon bench were afterwards deposited. This probably took 
place when the river channel" curved sharply in against the bluft's at 
this point, peruiittino- the cnrrentsto break down and partially remove 
the superior beds of shale and limestone well within the entrance to 
the little valle^^ When this active erosion ceased the limestone sur- 
face was strewn with rocky debris a foot or two deep, and in against 
the ])lufl' at the southern margin there were heaps of coarse talus mate- 
rial upon which the two human bodies were cast or in which they were 
rudely buried; and just here we reach the point of divergence of the 
two interpretations with respect to the period at which these events 
occurred. The first view assumes that we are probabh^ dealing with 
the lowan epoch of the Glacial period. If this is correct, the events 
following the deposition of the bodies would be about as follows: Dur- 
ing this period the river, becoming burdened with silt from the reced- 
ing ice front, buried the bodies and began to till up its channel. Step 
by step the surface rose until the immediate valley was tilled and ol)lit- 
erated and the waters flowed out over the highest l)lufl's. depositing 
everywhere the mantle of silt known to geologists as loess. As the 
ice receded to the far north deposition gradually ceased in this part of 
the valley, and the river, step by step, cut its way down again through 
the vast deposits that tilled its former channel, leaving a succession of 
loess terraces more or less well delined against the hillsides, and finally, 
after many fluctuations, reaching its present level, which at extreme 
high water is from 5 to 10 feet lower than our datum level — the lime- 
stone floor indicated at e-e^ tig. 2. 

But are we warranted in supposing that the two human bodies 
became associated with the debris on the limestone floor during this 
great epoch in glacial history, or are we to adopt the opposing view 
that at the end of this episode, or long after its close, when the river 
had descended to nearly its present level, the floods uncovered the 
limestone surface within the entrance to the little valley, and that at 
this time the aborigines, the ancestors of our historic tribes, left their 
dead among the heaps of debris? 

The latter view assumes that the river prolxilfly had little to do, 
directly, with depositing the materials that Imried the human bodies 
and now form the Concannon bench; that after clearing the limestone 
floor the current proba])ly followed its habit of rapid change and 
shifted for a time to the eastern side of the broad flood-plain, leaving 
other agencies to control the destinies of the litth^ valley now occu- 
pied by the Concannon fai-m. Naturally, the deposits of the ])ench 
have been examined with mimitt^st care with the view of d(^termining 
the story of their accumulation. If laid down in water tliey should 
show decided evidence of assoi-tment and bedding; il" tiie result of 
redistribution of loess and other local materials tiirough surface 
agencies, the deposits would present little evidence of assortment and 



4H0 FOSSIL HUMAN REMAITSTS FOUND NEAR LANSING, KANSAS. 

no evidence of systematic stratiti cation. Tliroughont the entire depth 
of these formations, as exposed in the tmmel and in the trench, there 
appears to be but one feature that can be construed as giving decided 
support to the view which favors fluvial origin. A thin seam of clay 
appears in the west wall of the tunnel, some 3 feet above the lime- 
stone floor, and extends from the entrance far back toward the south, 
rising at a low angle. The earlier examinations of this deposit led to 
the conclusion that the lower part, at least, of the formation had been 
laid down by the river, but subsequent investigations show that the 
la3^er is not continuous, that it is not found in the east wall of the tun- 
nel opposite its appearance on the west side, and that it pinches out 
quickly to the west, no trace of it having been discovered in the walls 
of the great trench dug by the Bureau. It is just such a layer of 
water-laid claj^ as would accumulate in the bed of a sluggish stream 
running with the trend of the tunnel at this point, or through the 
presence of a small oblong i)ool of water left during a season of flood 
before the river finally deserted this level. 

The deposit is composed for the most part of loess-like silt, through 
which, at all levels, are scattered fragments of limestone and shale, 
the whole presenting much variety of composition and irregularity of 
accumulation; hence it is surmised that the history of its deposition 
may be somewhat as follows: When at a period indefinitely later than 
the close of the lowan epoch, and possibly much later than even the 
close of the Glacial period, the river retreated from the west side of 
the valley, leaving the limestone floor at the entrance to the little 
valley freshly exposed, the steep slopes of the valley, half a square 
mile in area, were mantled with loess deposits, and these, with coarser 
materials from the general surface, were carried down by creep and 
wash to the gateway of the little valley, where, since active erosion 
b}' the river had ceased, they accumulated, burying the exposed rock 
surface and the human remains to a depth of 20 feet or more and 
spreading out in a fan-shaped delta on the river flood-plain about the 
mouth of the valley. The narrow entrance to the valley probably 
favored accunuilation, and the weak intermittent rivulet nuist have 
been quite incapable of clearing the way and carrying the accumulated 
material far out over the plain to the river channel. At any rate it 
seems altogether reasonable to suppose that 20 feet or more in depth 
of this material could have been deposited within and about the 
entrance to the little valley. The amount of accumulation would be 
limited oidy by the length of time that the river channel remained far 
away to the east and by the supply of easily eroded material. It is 
readily understood, however, that between the period of the burial of 
the human bodies and the present time the river may have returned 
once or several times toward the west bluff, permitting active work in 
undermining and cutting- down the limestone face. That it did return 



FOSSIL HUMAN REMAINS FOUND NEAR LANSING, KANSAS. 461 

is stroiio-ly suo-gestccl by the apparent leecntness of the i-iUtin^- and 
the fact that the Cowarnion liench, the surface of which was at one 
time continuous with tlT,e floott-plain surface, is truncated on the face 
uniformly with the nmin Iduti'. This return of the channel to the 
west side would give the little stream the opportunity of lowering- its 
channel to the present perfect adjustment with the river, and especially 
so since, as the centuries passed, the loess deposits had been largely 
removed from the slopes of the valley above and rapid accunudation 
about its mouth by creep and wash had necessarily ceased. 

The preferred interpretation of the phenomena, then, is that the 
relic-bearing deposits of the Concannon bench were not laid down in 
Glacial times by the silt-charged waters of the Missouri, ])ut that they 
are a remnant of delta-like accumulations formed in comparatively 
recent times within and about the mouth of the tributary valley by 
local subaerial agencies, all save the more protected portions having 
been removed by late encroachments of the ever-changing river. 

The time involved would not be that required by the Missouri to 
lower its flood plain from the upper level of the bench to the present 
high-water mark, a descent of 3U or 35 feet, but the period re<[uired 
to depress the flood plain from a little al)ove the surface of tlie lime- 
stone floor on which the l)odies rested to its present level, a descent of 
from 5 to 10 feet. The measure of this amount of erosion in years is 
the measure of the age of the Lansing man; this may be thousands of 
years, but at most it can lie but a fraction of the time re(juired by the 
other view, for, according to that view, the river, after burying the 
human bodies, filled its channel with glacial deposits until it over- 
flowed the highest blufl's, and then descended again to tlie present 
level. The time required to All up the valley, 8 or more miles in 
width and nearly 200 feet in depth, and then to cut this filling all out 
again can never l)e determined, since chronologic criteria are largely 
wanting; but it might well reach ten, twenty, or even thirty thousand 
years. On the other hand, the time recpured by the river to lower its 
bed 5 or 10 feet might possibly l)e expressed in hundreds rather than in 
thousands of years. It may be of importance to note, however, that 
even this amount of lowering need not be assumed in accounting for 
the facts. The high-water mark to-day along the Concaiuion blufl', 
with the river a mile or two away across a wooded plain, might well 
be several feet lower than the highest level reached l>y a strong cur- 
rent driven dir(>ctly or even obliquely against the blufl.'. 

The anthro] ologist may readily find other than pui-ely geological 
criteria to aid him in reaching his conclusions. It is a part of our 
common knowledge that men have occupied the AnuM-ican continent 
for a long period, but that they occupied it during the (Jlacial ei)och, 
or ev(Mi at the period when the (ilacial front linsdly receded northward,

well preserved and fresh looking, and is nearl}^ identical with crania 
of our historic tribes. Now when, as in the present case, two some- 
what equall}" supported interpretations of the geological phenomena 
are possible — the one making it appear that remains of men occur in 
formations where they could reasonably be expected, and the other 
carrying human occupancy back ten thousand or twenty thousand 
years — the anthropologist may consistently accept, tentatively at least, 
the first of these interpretations, and the non-professional student of 
the subject may find it wise to at least withhold his full acceptance of 
either view until those geologists best qualitied to discuss the special 
problems involved shall have reached practical unanimity. 

As a result of my own observations at Lansing, and considering also 
the conclusions reached by Professor Chamberlin and his associates, I 
find it ditficult to come to any other conclusion than that the human 
remains under consideration are properly classed as of Post-Glacial age, 
interpreting that term to cover all time subsequent to the final retreat 
of the ice from the region south of the Great Lakes. 

The Lansing skull, illustrated in Plates I-II, belongs to Mr. M. C.

THE WILD TRIBES OF THE MALAY PENINSULA." 



Bv W. W. Skeat, M. a. 



In addition to the civilized brown-skinned Muhamniadan ]Malavs, 
who are a distant oti'shoot of the Mongolian stock, there are at least 
three groups of savage and heathen tribes in the Mala^y Peninsula, 
which nui}' be roughly distinguished as follows, according to the char- 
acter of their hair: 

1. Woolly-haired Negrito tribes, called Semang. 

2. ^Vavy-haired tribes, called Sakai. 

3. Straight-haired tri])es, called Jakun.'' 

Of these, the Negritos (Semang) are found in northern Perak, 
Kedah, Kelantan, Trengganu, and the northern districts of Pahang 
(PL 1, 1); the Sakai in southern Perak, Selangor, and Pahang (PI. I, 2), 
and the Jakuns (mixed with other tribes) in all districts south of the 
States mentioned down to flohor and Singapore, and also, generally 
speaking, along the coasts (PI. I, o). 

The lirst of these groups — the Semang — is a fairly pure branch of 
the Negrito race, which includes the natives of the Andaman Islands, 
in the Bay of Bengal; the Negritos, of the Philippine Islands, in the 
China Sea, north of Borneo, and the Semang, of Malaya. 

A curious point about this group is that it still remains a moot (jues- 
tion — as our most recent authorities declare — whether any Negritos 
occur in Borneo, which would naturally be the connecting link between 
the Malay Peninsula and the Philippines. 

Some day it may be possible to answer this question, but meanwhile 
it is no less difficult to say who the Negritos really are. They seem to 
have received their name from the Spaniards, who regarded them as a 
sort of dwarf negro race, although they have nothing in common with 
the true Negroes but their woolly hair and black skin. The old idea

cThis classification is practically base<l upon that of Prof. Rudolf Martin, of Zurich, 
who for some years past has l)een preparin<^ an important monograph on the very 
difficult anthropology of these tribes. It differs solely in the isolation of the third 
(Jakun) type, which is included in Martin's third group under the heading of 
"Mixed tribes.^'

464 THE WJLD TRIBES OF THE MALAY PENINSULA 

seems to have been that they were the otl'sprinjj of African negroes who 
had escaped from slave dhows which had been wrecked in the Eastern 
Archipelago; indeed, I have heard of one widely recognized authority 
who maintained that the Negritos were the descendants of African 
slaves brought over by Alexander the Great when he visited India. 

Nowadciys, however, anthropology takes a more sober view of racial 
relationships, and it is pretty generally acknowledged that the Negritos 
are not Negroes, nor even a branch of the Melanesian or Papuan race, 
as others have held, although, if there is to be guessing, the hypothe- 
sis that would appear to have the most likelihood of being some day 
substantiated is the brilliant suggestion of Sir William Flower, who 
thought that the Negritos might possibly represent an infantile type 
of a woolly-haired race, of which the Negro on the one hand and the 
Papuan on the other were higlily specialized derivatives. Even this, 
however, as I have said, is but guesswork, and for our present pur- 
poses we must be content to regard the Negro, the Negrito, and the 
Papuan as the representatives of three very different and separate 
racial types. 

It may perhaps be of interest to add that for many 3^ears, perhaps 
on account of the tree-dwelling habits of some of these tribes, it was 
hoped that the Semang might possess some ape-like attributes. 
Though these expectations have been shattered, and the Semang can 
not henceforth be regarded as possessing an abnormally pithecoid 
character, he still retains the interest which attaches to him as a rep- 
resentative of one of the wildest races of mankind now extant. 

The second type of which these races are composed is represented 
b}' the Sakai tribes, who offer, if possible, a yet more difficult problem. 
An attempt has recently been made to identify them, mainly, it seems, 
on the strength of linguistic evidence, with what is called the Mon- 
Annam group of races, i. e., with the tribes who possessed till about 
six hundred years ago the country which is now Siam, and some of 
whom still occupy Pegu and Camboja. 

Linguistic evidence has, however, repeatedly proved a blind guide 
in the elucidation of racial problems, and I do not think we can depend 
upon it in the present case. Racial classitications must be based on 
racial facts, and in the present case we have the more crcdable 
alternative suggested by Professor Virchow for what appears to ))e a 
very different grouping. 

Virchow's theory is simply that the Sakai may (juite possibly belong 
to what he calls the Dravido- Australian race, the chief reprt^sentatives 
of which are the Veddas or wild tribes of Ceylon, the civilized Tamils 
of southern India, the Australian black fellows, and the Sakai of the 
Malay Peninsula. 

In the essential characters of the hair aiul head, there is certainly a 
remarkal)le agreement, and the only gn^at difficulty about this group- 
ing seems to arise From the color of the skin, which among the Sakais

often approaches a light shade of 3"ellowish-brown, whereas among 
th(> Tamils black skins commonly occur. Professor Virchow meets 
this difficulty by pointings out that the Sinhalese of Ceylon, although 
admittedly Aryans, are frequently so dark in color as to be called 
quite black. 

This point let authorities decide; all that can be said at present is 
that it appears an eminently sane and arguable hypothesis; and that 
it seems to have already found some acceptance. If it is correct, we 
may perhaps suppose that these aboriginal Dravidians once extended 
far north into Indo-China and there acquired the dialects of the local 
(Mon-Annam) tri]>es. an idea about which there is at least nothing- 
fantastic. 

The third racial group to which I have referred consists of the 
Jakuns, an aboriginal race closely related to the Malay, and which, in 
its pure type, possesses markedly Mongolian features. They belong- 
to what the Germans would call the "Ur-Malay'"' race, but which we, 
in the absence of any such convenient prefix, are constrained to call 
by some such clumsy substitute as Pr{\?-Malay or Proto-Malay — the 
"savage Malays" of Alfred Russell Wallace. The simplest name to 
give them is perhaps ''Malayan." 

This ''savage Malav" or Jakun race, or whatever we prefer to call 
it, is divided into two main groups, (1) the Jakuns of the Jungle, or 
Hill Jakuns, and (2) the Jakuns of the Sea, or Orang Laut. The lat- 
ter set of tribes now consist of the broken reumants of the Pirates or 
Sea-gypsies of the Straits of Malacca, who for so many years were 
the scourge and terror of those far eastern seas. 

From what 1 have said it will, I think, l)e evident how important 
are the issues which may depend for solution upon our proper stud}^ 
of these tribes. Before closing- these notes on the general relation- 
ship })etween these three races and their neighbors. I will therefore 
give a few more details concerning each of the several types described. 

The physical contrast between all three races is most fortunately 
sharply drawn. 

The men of the first -mentioned race (Semang or Negritos) are about 
4: feet 9 or 10 inches in height, their women being a])out 8^ inches 
.shorter. The color of their skin is very dark brown or black. Among 
the purest-])red Semangs 1 have seen it a glossy jet black, not unlike 
the color ascribed to the Andamanese, viz, that of a newly black- 
leaded stove. The shape of the head is mesaticephalic and brachy- 
cephalic (i. e., either rounded or intermediate between the long and 
round types). The forehead is low and rounded and i)rojects over 
the root of the nose, which is short and depressed and ])yranii(l shaped. 
The eyes are round and wide opiMi and show no trace of obli(|uity, the 
iris being of a very rich deep-brown color. The lips \'ary fi'om mod- 
erate to full, the mouth is rather large, the chin but feebly developed, 
SM 1DU2 30 



466 THE WILD TRIBES OF THE MALAY PENINSULA. 

and a side view of the face sometimes shows some prognathism or 
projection of the lower part of the facial area. 

The hair is of a very dark brownish black (never blue black, as 
among Chinese and Malays). It grows in short spiral tufts, curling 
close!}' all over the scalp, if not shaved off, as it very frequently is. 

The height of the Sakai does not materially differ from that of the 
Semang," but the color of the skin is very much lighter than that of 
the Negritos, and sometimes shows a reddish tinge about the breast 
and extremities. The head is dolichocephalic, or long shaped. The 
face is inclined to be long, and would be hatchet shaped Init for the 
breadth of the cheek bones, which help to give it rather an elliptical 
outline. The chin is commonly long and pointed; the forehead rather 
high and flat, but brows often beetling, the notch above the nose being 
very deep; the nose small, often slightly tilted or rounded off at the 
tip, but at the same time broad and with very deep-set nostrils. The 
beard usually consists of a few long and frizzly chin hairs, remarkabh' 
like that of the Veddas of Ceylon, but in some cases it certainly grows 
long and bushy. 

The third class (the savage Malays or Jakuns) is hard to identify, as 
it has received a large admixture of Semang and Sakai blood. Never- 
theless, the pure type is, I think, recognizable and will be found to 
differ widely from both of the two types already mentioned. 

They (the Jakuns) are a little taller than the Sakais or Semangs. 
Their head is brachycephalic or rounded, their skin olive brown to 
dark copper. Their face has a flattened appearance, and their lower 
jaw is inclined to be square. Their nose is somewhat stumpy — i. e., 
thick and short— but with wide-open nostrils. Their cheek bones are 
high and well marked, like those of the Malays and Chinese. Their 
eyes are black and of moderate size. Their mouth is large and broad. 
Their hair straight or lank, and with a bluish-black tinge to it, not 
unlike that of the Malays themselves. Their beard is scanty. 

In addition to the foregoing three main types we have perhaps 
naturally, in spite of their antagonistic elements, a good many instances 
of mixed tribes, most of which can, if the purest types be taken as 
standards, be resolved with a fair amount of certainty into their 
original ingredients. 

There are many physiological points about all these tribes which 
would be of great interest if 1 had time to go into them. Their arm 
stretch, for instance, is almost always greater, sometimes much greater, 
than their height. Their feet are unusuallv short and stum})v and 
splayed, with a remarkable inward curve of the great toe, the prehen- 
sile character of which enables them, when spoiled by domestication, to 
ibecome v^ry clever at stealing. I have seen Semangs run u\) trees by

very deeply indebted to my iriend Jiudolf JNJartiu-

placing- the tiat of tljc foot against the trunk and putting their arms a 
good way around it. . TiTe eyesight of the Sakais, as tested with tlie 
army tests, though not ahnomial, is distinctly good and seems to com- 
pare very favorably with our own. The fFakun power of scent is 
exceptionally keen, and I was frequently astonished at the great dis- 
tance at w^hich they would notice the smoke of a camp fire in the 
jungle many minutes befon^ I could detect the least trace of smoke 
myself. Their walk is very peculiar, the foot being lifted very high, 
almost as in dancing, and by this, and a certain restless expression 
about the eyes, even those Jakuns whose features are most like those 
of the ^Malays, can be inmiediately distinguished when thev are met 
crossing open country. 

The food of these jungle tribes — their lirst and most vital considera- 
tion — consists mainly of vegeta})le products, such as the roots and fruits 
which they dig up in the jungle, as well as (among tribes who have 
reached the first stage of agriculture) of the product of light crops, 
such as yams, sweet potatoes, maize, sugar eane, and bananas, and, at 
a later stage, of rice. Meat food, consisting of game In'ought down by 
the ])lowgun or the ))ow, is also largely employed for food, but this is 
mainly among the Semangs, some tiibes of Sakais neglecting to go in 
pursuit of game until their supply of vegetable food is beginning to 
run out, though even among a good man}' Sakai tribes ])oth hunting 
and trapping are energetically carried on. Some of the yams eaten 
are jwisonous and require careful preparation to render them tit for 
human consumption; some kinds are buried for days together in a bag- 
in the swamps of the jungle {or in running water), when they are dug 
up and have the juice squeezed out of them with a lever before l)eing 
cooked and eaten; other kinds are grated on an ingenious natui'al grater 
made of the young growing shoot of a highly i)rickly rattan or calanuis, 
the grated mass being kneaded with a spatula upon a banana leaf and 
mixed with. slaked lime in order to destroy its poisonous properties, 
when it is wrapped u[) in a strip of green ])an;ina leaf, inserted in a 
split stick, and roasted over the tire. At meals the Semang men, 
from the oldest to the youngest, all feed together l)efore the females, 
the latter, who have done the cooking, looking on with hungry eyes 
until their lords and masters have tinished their repast. 

In the matter of animal food l)oth Sakais und Semangs cat c\ery- 
thing that comes in their way — monkeys, deer, wild pig. hirds, fish, 
porcupines, lizards, siiuirrels, rats, and mice; not even snakes are 
excepted from the menu, which, it will thus b«; seen, is a sutiiciently 
varied one. 

In hunting and trapping, which are employed solely for food ))ur- 
poses, these tribes are, as might be ex])ected. exceedinglv expert. 
They have a marvelous knowledge of the jungle and its inliabitants, 
and seem to, have an instinctive knowledge of the presence of animals. 



468 THE WILD TRIBES OF THE MALAY PENINSULA. 

being able, when no one else can, to tell the exact whereabouts of a 
bird or animal moving- a great way oflf in the forest. Their sight, as 
I have said, is naturally good, and through training becomes wonder- 
fully quick. The same is true of their hearing, and, as they are 
believed to be able to track snakes by their smell, it is evident that that 
faculty is in no way inferior. They know^ their way al)out the jungle 
better than anyone, and their intimate knowledge of the life history 
of the jungle beasts is turned to account in the methods by which they 
hunt and trap their game. 

HUNTING AND TRAPriNG. 

The chief weapon of the Seniang (as among Negrito tribes else 
where) is the bow, which closely resembles that used in the Little 
Andamans," and with which poisoned arrows are used. That of the 
Sakai and Jakun is the ])lowgun or blowpipe. This latter is com- 
monly a long slender tube, often 6 or 8 feet long, composed (when- 
ever so long a piece is obtainable) of a single joint or internode of an 
exceedingly rare species of bamboo, which is found in the peninsula 
on two or three high mountains only, and which is called Bambusa 
Wrayi.'^ This tube is protected and strengthened by being inserted 
in a similar bamboo tul)e or case of slightly larger caliber. The darts 
are made of fine slivers obtained from the midrib of the leaf of certain 
kinds of palm. The}^ are about tlie size and thickness of a steel knit- 
ting needle, and are furnished at one end with a small, conical butt 
which is made to tit (rather loosely) the bore of the inner tube or 
blowpipe. The point is about an inch or more long and as .sharp as a 
needle, and just above it a nick is cut in the shaft of the dart, which 
causes the point to break off in the wound when the quarry attempts 
to escape through the tangled undergrowth. The point is, moreover, 
thickly coated with poison compounded from some of the most deadly 
poisons known, among which are the sap of the well-known Upas tree 
{Antiarh foxicarta) and the sap of a shrub called Ipoh Akar, Avhich is 
a species of Strychnos. 

The blowpipe is a breechloader, the dart l)eing inserted in the ori- 
fice, with a light Avad of a Hutiy sul)stance ()])tained from the loaf 
bases of a palm {canjoia) packed bciiind tiu» butt end for the preven- 
tion of ""windage." It IS sliot l)y taking part or the whoh^ of the ■ 
mouthpiece into the mouth and siiarply expelling the air from the 
lungs. The dart thus poisoned and ready to break otf in the wound 
may in fact be not inaptly compared to the sting of a bee, from which 
it may quite possibly, to some extent, have been copied. 

«E. H. Man, The Andaiuaii Islanders. 

^A very nnicli rarer kind is the woodi-n hlow^nin of Kuautan, whicli is made by 
lashnig together tliroughout their entire length two half cylinders of wood. One of 
these latter, measuring 5 feet 2 inches in length, has recently been jiresented to the 
British Mnsenni by Mr. F. W. Douglas, of the F. ,M. S. service. 



THE WILD TRIBES OF THE MALAY PENINt^llLA. 4()9 

Even the l)lowpipe itself is not without its iiutural jirototype in th(^ 
Miihiy l*eiiiiisulii, in the I'lA'ers of which there h\(^s a small lish calltMl 
Td.rofcs j(tcidaf(»\ which Lha\.e/inyself seen shoot a tly otf a leaf sev- 
eral inches above the surface of the river ])y means of a small drop of 
water forcibly expelled from its mouth. 

By the Sakais each of the darts is carried in a separate reed, al)out 
30 to 50 of these reeds beino- lashed tooi^thcM', rolled up into a bundle, 
and fitted into an ornate bamboo ((uiver. The Imtt ends of the darts 
are fre((uently marked to distino-uish the- strength of the |)()ison. 

The Semano- ([uiver contains fewer darts than that of the Sakai, and 
is without r<M'd bundle, cap, or rino-s; in fact, it is a mere internode or 
joint of hand)oo which is oidy remarkable for the beauty of the 
designs with which it is decorated. Various compounds of the two 
main poisons to which I lun e referred are used by the wild tril>es, the 
ingredients varying according to the fancy of the maker. Thus, 
venom from the fangs of serpents, centipedes, scorpions' stings, etc., 
is frequently added, though it is in no way really reciuired. Fur- 
nished with these darts, both Sakais and Semangs regularly brincj 
down their quarry at short distances up to about 30 paces, and have 
even l)een known to kill 1 irds and monkeys on high trees at a dis- 
tance of t)0 yards. The method of collecting and applying the coat of 
poison to the dart point in its siuq)lest form is as follows: The l)ark 
of the tree (when the tree poison is used) is slashed with a jungle 
knife in the shape of a big V. Th(^ poisonous sap, which immediately 
collects at the apex of the \', is then drawn otf into a bamboo vessel 
and carried home, where it is either, when small (juantities are used, 
as among the Semangs of Kedah, merely heated and applied to the 
dart points or prepared by boiling until a sutficient consistency is 
obtained. In the former case it is poured out into a bamboo tray and 
applied U) a l)road wooden spatula, which is heated over a tire until 
it begins to dry, when the point of the dart is rolled upon the spatula, 
the dart being then deposited against a fallen tree trunk to dry in the 
sun in a safe place. Among some Sakai and Jakun tribes an elaborate 
kind of drying i-ack is used, which prev(Mits the darts, wdiich are very 
light, from IxMng carried away in a high wind while drying. 

HABITATIONS. 

The most ])iimitive forms of dwelling emplo3"ed by the wild tribes 
are rock shelters (sometimes caves, but more commonly natural shel- 
ters under overhanging rocks) and leaf shelters, which are sometmies 
formed on the j'-'-ound, sometimes between the branches of trees, riic 
simplest form of these leaf shcdters consists of a singh^ big palm leaf, 
which is planted in the gi'ound to atl'ord the wanderer some flight 
shelter for a single night. Tlie more elaborate leaf shelters, used 
especially by St'inangs, sometmies take the form of a rude lean to. 



470 THE WILD TRIBES OF THE MALAY PENINSULA. 

consisting- of three or four uprights planted in the ground at an angle 
of about 60' to YO'^, with palm leaves or branches lashed horizontally 
across them. Other kinds consist of palm leaves planted in the 
g-round in the form of a semicircle or circle, the leaves, which are 
frequently a))out 6 feet long, drooping over toward the center, and 
thus forming a shelter of the circulai- or beehive type. The most 
developed form is a long communal leaf shelter in which all the mem- 
bers of the tribe reside. 

The Malayizing tribes who come more into contact Avith civilization 
insensibly adopt the Malay type of hut, but oven here some striking 
departures from the normal Malay type are to be seen, e. g., in the 
low or almost totally absent side walls and in the projection of one 
side of the gable over the other, so as to allow the roof to remain 
open at the top. These huts are generally liarricaded with fallen 
trees. 

The tree huts or "human bird nests," as they have been called, are 
built at a heig-ht of from 20 to 30 feet from the ground, chiefly as a 
means of escape from wild elephants. 

ARTS AND CRAFTS. 

The craftsmanship of these wild tribes, though extremely primitive, 
is excellent of its kind, and shows that they ])y no means lack inge- 
nuity. 

The manufacture of the blowpipe, its darts and quiver, as already 
described, forms an important industry of both Semang and Sakai. 
The tree-bark cloth of the wilder tribes is made by hammering (with 
a wooden mallet) the ])ark of a big jungle tree called Terap {^IrfocarjHis 
Kunstlcrl, a species of wild breadfruit tree), the outer surface of which 
is tir.st removed b\' scraping it with a knife. The mallet is frequently 
improved hy transverse grooves or teeth, which assist in the separa- 
tion of the ti))ers. 

A not less interesting type of cloth is manufactured from the cuticle 
of the Upas tree {Ajitinrlx) itself, a tree which belongs, I believe, to 
the same older as the Artocarpus. In this case a young sapling (of 
the L'pas tiee) is felled and a ring cut round the ])ark a few feet from 
the base. The Inirk is then scraped and pounded in situ with a 
rounded wooden mallet or clul) for a space of al)out a foot below the 
incision. The pounded part is then pull(»d away from the stem, sep- 
arating at the point where the bark meets the wood, and is turned 
down (not rolled) and skinned oil' like a stocking, the scraping and 
pounding being continu(Hl at intiu'vals, as re(|uircd, until all the l)ark 
is completely separated. 

As regards other forms of industry, mat work, basket work, and 
netting, are all found among these tribes, but no kind of weaving or 
pottery whatever. A high artistic sense is, however, shown (by the 



THE WILD TRIBES OF THE MALAY TENINSTILA. 471 

Somang' especially) in the l)eautil'ul and finely executed designs with 
which they decorate theii' blowpipes and quivers, and the magic combs 
worn ])y the women. An,anuising example of the skill of the Jai^uns 
was furnished me in the form of a set piece, representing the use of 
the blowpipe. 

DKKSS. 

The commonest form of clothing worn by the men of all these tribes 
is the waistcloth of tree ])ark, which consists <^f a long narrow strip of 
hammered bark. That of the women, on the other hand, is usually a 
sort of short petticoat or wrapper of the same material. Hut the most 
interesting form of girdle worn ])y these tribes is undoul>tedly one 
wiiich is beautifully woven from the long, black, shining strings or 
cords called rhizomorphs. which ar*^ in reality the vegetative parts of 
a toadstool. (PI. ], 4.) 

Leaving the question of girdles, there are several other slight, but 
otherwise important items of attire worn by th(\se tribes, such as arm 
bands, necklaces, and combs. Arm bands and even leg bands are fre- 
quently w^orn, apparently for the purpose of bandaging and so 
strengthening the nuiscles. They vary from a simple tie of jungle 
fiber to metal circlets or spirals, which latter are usually obtained 
from the Malays. 

The necklaces, which are worn chiefly by the women, it would 
appear mainly for magical purposes, consist at times of as many as 
nine strings, and are composed of such objects as monkeys' teeth, 
tufts of hair from s(|uirrels' tails, black and whiti^ beads, seeds of jun- 
gle fruits, shells, etc. 

The coml)s, Avhich bear magical designs, and are worn solely l»y 
women, are of the kind which I txdieve are termed l)ack cond)s in 
England, but which are onl}' worn to defend the wearer against poison 
or sickness. To complete the picture, tattooing or rather scaritication 
is practiced ovev a limited area among the wilder trit)es of the interior, 
with face and body painting (apparently as a substitute for tattooing) 
in places where Malay influence has begun to enter. The usual pat- 
tern consists of four or Ave horizontal stripes on the cheeks, with a 
sort of trident or pitchfork design on the forehead or chin. For the 
stripes on the cheeks are often substituted rows of ))lack and white 
dots, supposed to represent what are called the spores, or perhaps 
more correctly the sori, of a fern. The tattooing is performed by 
drawing the flnely serrated edge of a sugar-cane leaf across tlie skin 
and rubl)ing into it powdered charcoal. 

In addition to th(^ foregoing the septum of the nosc^ is frequently 
(among th(^ Seniang and Sakai only) ])ierced to admit the (piill of a 
porcupine. l)()ne. or })iece of stick, or sonn^ other decorative object of 
the kind.

MUSIC AND DANCING. 

It would take too lon^- to describe in an}" sort of detail the musical 
instruments of these ti'ibes. Suffice it to say that they are almost 
always made of Ijamboo, some of the most primitive kinds being- of 
sj^ecial ethnographical interest, notably the bamboo jews-harp and the 
nose flute. One or two of these latter (PI. I, 5) may be played at a time, 
the performer l)reathing- into the mouth hole of the flute through the 
nostrils. This instrument is found among- tribes who do not use the 
blowgun, as well as among those tribes who do, but the accomplish- 
ment sliould be an easier one for the latter, i. e., the Sakais, to acquire, 
from the healthy development of the lungs with the blowpipe exer- 
cise. Simpler forms of instruments are represented by a couple of 
sticks which are struck together, producing a sound like castagnettes, 
and (among the Semang) l)y big internodes or '"joints'" of baml)oo, 
which are closed naturally b}" the node at the lower end and played 
by being ))eaten at the upper end with a fan-shaped palm-leaf beater. 

The most important instrument of the Jakuns is the drum, which is 
made of a hoUowed-out trunk of screw pine, headed with the dressed 
skins of mouse deer or monkeys. 

On festive occasions, e. g. , for singing and dancing, both sexes 
decorate the person profusely with festoons of leaves. The Sakais 
and Jakuns in addition wear upon the head a curious circlet made of 
strips of palm-leaf (licuala) in the form of a plait with long streamers 
so depending from it as partially to conceal the face of the dancer. 
That of the woman has in addition a number of short sticks on which 
are spitted fragrant leaves or flowers, on a principle of which we seem 
to have the counterpart in the design of some of our peers' coronets. 
In the girdle, head-band, and festoons (which arc crossed upon l)ack 
and breast) are inserted bunches or bou(]uets of cunningly W()\<'n 
strips of palm-leaf representing nooses, etc., which are said to l)e 
intended to entrap evil spirits when they make assault upon the person 
of the dancer. 

Finally a short wand or scepter is can-ied. which takes at times a 
most peculiar shape, reseml)ling a series of crescents and double axes.

Here is one of the fTakun song's, which is one out of a set of about 
thirty ditferent ones wldch 1 took down in Selangor: 

" 'Impit-impit' is the cry of the rhinoceros, 
The rhinoceros of the herd (calling) to the reclnsi' rhinot-eros, 
He calls his comrades to seek for fooil. 
He walks the forest and climbs the hills. 
He walks abroad when the dew dries on the granite. 
What skills it for me to resist the rhinoceros? 
I call my comrades, but my comrades are not there. 
I am terrified and clind) up into a tree. 
But the rhinoceros waits at the tree's foot. 
I break off a bow and throw it down to him. 
The rhinoceros champs it, and j^asses onward.

I take my gun and shoot the rhinoceros. 
The bullet has hit him! The rhinoceros has fallen! 
I roast him next and cut up the rhinoceros, 
And give of the meat a little U) everyone. 
But the horn J sell to the Chinese foreigners." 

Other song's in my collections describe the tiger, (dcphant, beai', 
crocodile, birds and l»ats, tish, \arious reptiles, and fruit. A Ncrv

Marriiig'c, among all these triV)e,s, is said to he l>ased on purchase. 
Of the actual ceremonies the most interesting is the form of wedding 
rite which is usual!}- described as the ant-heap ceremony. The bride- 
groom is required to overtake the bride before she has run seven times 
round the ant-heap, and in the event of his failing to do so the marriage 
has to l)e postponed for a future occasion. 

This is the usual account given by people who have recorded it from 
hearsa}". I was, however, on one occasion fortunate enough to be 
present at one of these weddings, and I then discovered that the 
orthodox ol)ject round which the chasing took place was not really an 

ant heap, but a small arti- 
ficial mound, the cause of 
the confusion being the use 
of the Malay word Busut, 
which may bear either 
meaning. The artificial 
moimd (tig. 3) which was 
used on this occasion was 
about 3i feet high with 
al)out the same diameter 
at the base. Its shape was 
that of a truncated cone, 
surmounted by a small 
globe and knob. It re- 
sembled not remotely a 
gigantic bell and })ell han- 
dle. It was decorated with 
jungle flowers, and the 
Jakun chiefs assured me that this was the "genuine article,'' and that 
it was the eml)lem of their religion, and I see no reason for d<)u)>ting 
the statement. 

Before the pursuit of the bride takes place the man or his i)rox3' is 
subjected to a severe catechism by the woman's representatives, the 
questions asked l)eing of a most s(^arching description, e. g. : 

"Can you fell trees? 

"Can you climl) for fruit? 

"Can you tind turtles' eggs? 

"Are you clever at using the )»l()wpipe? and 

"Can you smoke cigarettes?" 

This li\st (luery doubtless relates to the fact that the ceremony some- 
times concludes with the smoking of a cigarette jomtly by ])ride and 
bridcgi'oom. 

Among tiic Orang-Laut or sea gv])sies the pursuit sometimes takes 
the form of a canoe race, in which the woman is given a good start, and 
must be overtaken hv the man Ix'fore she has o-one a certain distance.

At !i Sakai or Jakiiii fimejral the l)ody of the deceased is shiiiu;' from 
a pole and carried to a distant spot in tiie juni^le at h'ast a cock's 
crow from the nearest house. Here it is wrajjped in a new cloth and 
buried in a shallow trench, the clothes worn duiinu- the life of tiie 
deceased lieing- ])urned in a tire which is lighted near the <;rave. The 
grave l)eing- tilled up, rice is sown ujjon it and watered, some herbs 
and young bananas, etc., are planted round it (all of these being for 
the deceased's soul to feed ui)on), and linally a small three-cornered 
hutch, not unlike a doll's house, ))ut raised on very high posts, is 
erected near the foot of the grave for the soul to reside in. The soul's 
house itself is about a foot and a half high, is thatched M'ith palm 
leaves, and provided with a ladd(M' for the soul to climb up bv. It 
contains in addition dimiuuti^'e emblems of the sex of the deceased (in 
the case of a man, th(^ model of a hatchet and a jungle knife, etc.; in 
the case of a woman, the model of a ])ack basket or wallet, such as is 
carried 1)}" the women of the tribe), as well as a supply of food (a little 
rice and lish, etc.) for the deceased's soul to feed upon, to])acco for it 
to smoke, and betel leaf for it to chew. 

The Semang, on the other hand, practice a simple form of interment, 
a supply of food and drink being placed in the grave along with the 
body. There is, however, a tradition that the}' used to devour their 
dead and bury the head only, and although this assertion is certainly 
untrue now, and probabl}^ always was so, it is more than probable 
that like their close kinsmen the Andamanese they may once have been 
in th(^ habit of disinterring the ])on(»s of their dead and l)reaking them 
into short segments to string on to their neckhices, in which cas(^ the 
skull may have once l)een worn, as among the Andamanese, as a sort 
of pendant attached to the necklace. 

MAOIO. 

The chiefs of the tribe were often, if not always, medicine men or 
magicians, their power in this respect being greatly feared by the 
Malays, who believed them to l)c capable of slaying jx'ople at a distance 
b}' means of what are called "sendings," which were small slivers of 
bamboo apparently representing darts, which l)eing placed on the 
palm of the hand would (it was thought), at the magician's bidding, 
fly through space until the}- reached their intended victim, whom they 
would pierce to the heart and kill even at a distance of two or three 
days' journey. 

The Biduh Perindu or "'love and longing" bamboo was said to 
grow vipon almost inaccessil)le mountain peaks. Slivei-s of this plant 
were form(>rly obtained from tlui Jakuns by the mem})ers of Malay 
traveling theatrical troupes, who inserted them between the teeth, 



476 THE WILD TRIBES OF THE MALAY PENINSULA. 

this being believed to render the voice of the wearer irresistible. This 
custom, however, led, it was said, to such abuses that formerly in some 
parts of the peninsula the possession of any portion of the *'Huluh 
Perindu'' was punished with the death penalty. 

The chinduai or chingkuai is a small fragrant plant with minute 
inflorescences (sometimes it is descril)ed as a small white iive-petaled 
blossom) which is believed to ))e one of the rarest and most fragrant 
flowers in the world. 

The story goes that it formerly grew undernt^ath a ledge of over- 
hanging rock on one of the crags of the Ulu Klang mountains. 
Although the exac-t spot where it grew could be seen from the ledge, 
it was nevertheless inaccessible, and it was said that the wild man who 
wanted it had to ascend the mountain and there keep his fast possibly 
for weeks or months upon the summit of this ledge until a kite, which 
used the chinduai as niedicine for its young, should drop a piece in 
flying over him. Whatever may be the facts, this particular charm 
is well known in coimection with the Klang country, and is alluded to 
in the local quatrain which says, "Set not your foot upon the Klang 
mountains; if j^ou do you will suffer from their charm." 

Both Semang and Sakai are great adepts at the exorcism of demons; 
and on one occasion I saw an apparently Avonderful cure effected b}" 
this simple means, the patient being a woman belonging to one of the 
tribes of Semangs in Kedah. We were all sitting and talking quietly 
in the long communal leaf-shelter in which the tribe lived, when one 
of the Avomen, who suffered at intervals from agonizing pains in the 
limbs, was seized with a sudden paroxysm (which made her scream 
with pain) and presently leaped to her feet and fled into the jungle. 
The remainder of her companions, who declared that she had gone 
into the jungle to die there, slipped out one by one after her, and 1 
decided to follow them to see whether an3'thing could l)e done. When 
I arrived I found the woman seated on the ground, whil(>, the chief, 
in his capacity of medicine man to the tribe, was digging away for 
dear life with a pointed stick to try and unearth the stump of a small 
sapling which grew near the spot. This he presently succeeded in 
doing, and on examining the root found what he pronounced to be 
clear evidence of the demon's recent presence in the curious pinching 
in of i)art of the root. He next took (Mirth out of the hole and rubl)ed 
it over the i)atient's stomach and back, muttering charms as he did so, 
in order to induce the demon to return to the spot whence he had come. 
In a few minutes the woman began to get better, })ut as the demons 
were not yet quite done with, the chief proceeded to dig up the stump 
of another tree, this time a creepcn-, whose root proved in shape to bear 
some resem})lance to a mandrak<\ He then repeated the former pro- 
cess, and chanted his incantations more xigorously than (ner, at the

away into the jungle tliQ. stCms of two saplings which had ])een l^^ing 
near the spot, in order, they said, to get rid of the (h^non's presence. 
By this time the woman had ceased hen* lamentations, and in a1)out ten 
minutes' time was })ron()iniced cured, after which she (piietly returned 
to the encam])ment as if nothing had happened. 

The wlioh^ performance was an excellent exanipl(> of sympatla^tic 
magic or make-h(die\e. 

The most remarkal)le de\ elopment, however, of the wild magician's 
alleged powers is connected w'ith the ** tiger man'' beliefs, which are 
analogous to former European ideas about werewolves. One of the 
Semang men wiiomMr. Laidlaw and I met at Ulu Aring, in Keiantan, 
had the i-e})utation of being a notorious tiger man, or IVlian, and gave 
me some interesting information al)out the performance. "You go," he 
said, "a long way into the jungle" (usually, he added, into the lu^xt val- 
ley), '"and there, when you are <pnte alone, you scpiat dowai upon your 
haunches. Ixirn incense, and, makmg a trumpet of your hand, blow 
some of th(^ smoke of the incense through it, at the level of 3'our face, 
in three directions. You then repeat this process, holding your hand 
close to the ground; all you now have to say is, 'Ye chtip" ('I am going 
abroad'), and presently your skin will change, the sti'ipes will appear, 
your tail will fall down, and you will become a tiger. AVIkmi you wish 
to return say, 'Ye wet' ('I am going home'), and you will })resently 
return to your natural form." It sounds easy enough, and th(^ oidy 
wonder was that one so s(ddom heard in that i)art of the world of the 
disappearance of an obnoxious rival or a scolding wife. 

The most interesting point about this ceremony, however, is its 
apparent universality, for it is found, nmtatis mutandis, in all parts of 
the globe. In passing, it may be noted that a small \'ariety of ripping 
knife {helfulo/), shaped like a tiger's claw, and fitted with a hole in the 
haft to pass the finger through, is well known and used to this day 
both in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, in both of which coiuitries 
the were-tiger belief is still held strongly. 

KEIJCJION. 

The religion of the Avild tril)es is a form of shamanism such as 
prevails in other parts of southeast Aasia. They l>elie\ e in certain 
greater spirits, who ma}' perhaps, when Ave have found out all about 
them, })ro\'e to be a sort of gods in the making. But they have, of 
cours(% nothing which (^xactly corresponds to our own idea of God, 
and the cAidenc*^ on tiiis sul)ject is more than usually conflicting, owing 
to the extriMuc^ reticence and timidity of thes(^ wild men tliemselves, of 
whom it would be ])ut litth^ exaggeration to say that they w<M'e as wild 
as deer. Most of them believe that th(> soul shoi-tly aftei- dcalli pro- 
ceeds to a place called the Island of Fruits (the jungle man's id(\'i of

a paradise), which they not iint"re(iuently identity with the moon. To 
reach this island they are compelled to cross a boiling lake resembling 
a copper, by means of a narrow bridge formed of a fallen tree trunk, 
and the souls of the wicked, failing to accomplish this in' safety, fall 
off the log into the lake, where they swim about desperatel}- for three 
long years, clutching at the smooth sides of the lake, after which the 
chief of the Island of Fruit Trees, if he so thinks fit, contemptuously 
lets down to them one of his feet so that they may catch hold of his 
great toe, in which undignified fashion they are at length permitted to 
escape from piirgator^^ and to enter paradise. 



THE PYGMIES OE THE GREAT CONGO EOKEST. 



Bv Sir Harhy H. Johnston, G. C. M. G. 



[In the recesses of the great ConKO forest have been discovered two tribes of men, tlie most baclc- 
ward in their development froni lower forms of all the savage races of the Dark Continent. The 
following article is an account of their appearance, modes of life and speech, together with some 
vastly suggestive theories of their descent from the prehistoric invaders of Africa from Asia.] 

THE INFLUENCE OF A (IKEAT FOKE.ST ON THE EVOLUTION OF MAN. 

The great Congo forest of west-central Africa must undoubtedly 
be regarded as a very important factor in the past history of Africa. 
By "history" I do not mean the record of man's doings only, or of 
the progress of the civilized races of men, Avhose adventures chroni- 
cled l)y writing have narrowed the use of the word to records of the 
progress of humanitv' during, let us say, seven thousand years, a mere 
half minute in the hour of man's existence. For not only in the 
'•prehistoric" movements of man, but also in the preceding migra- 
tions of great beasts and anthropoid apes has this mighty forest 
checked and deflected the distribution of si)ecies or received into its 
l)OSom hunted, defenseless forms, which have thus been enal)led (as in 
the case of the Okapi) to linger on into the present day. 

Before, therefore, I proceed further with my description of remark- 
able negro types which are to be found on the eastern limits of this 
forested region, it may be well if 1 define clearly the area of forested 
Africa at the present dux. Roughly speaking, the whole basin of the 
Congo, the enormous area of relatively low-lying land (once possibly 
the site of inland seas or of an extension of the ocean), is a region of 
dense forest. On the southwest the forest stretches, with here and 
there a break, over to the upper waters of the Zambesi River, and on 
the northeast it overlaps the Nile watershed, the southwestern fringe of 
which is covered with forest that .spreads uninterruptedly from the 
Congo. In countries to the east, and even here and there near the 
littoral of the Indian Ocean, patches of primeval forest exist which 
scarcely differ from that of the Congo. It is possible, therefore, that

the whole of Africa south of the northern tropic mny once liave been 
one continuous primeval forest. 

Certain regions, however, on the north and south and, above all in 
the eastern half of the continent, proA'ed less capable, from conditions 
of soil or moisture, to support this growth of vegetation. In these 
regions the great mammals that invaded Africa during the Pliocene 
epoch, through southern Asia and Arabia, found less resistance to 

their progress and conditions, such as the 
growth of grasses, more favorable to the 
development of herbivores; while of course 
the great carnivorous animals could exist 
onl}^ where the big vegetarian beasts would 
thrive. The mighty forests still existed, 
however — existed possibly with small inter- 
ruptions — right across the continent from 
west to east. They therefore received into 
their safe recesses the anthropoid apes and 
the more timid and defenseless mammals of 
large size, w^hich in the more open country 
would have been completely exterminated. The anthropoid apes had 
no doubt been driven away from western Asia and southern Europe 
by their successful compeer and offshoot, man, who can have been the 
only serious enemy of these ancestors of the gorilla, chimpanzee, and 
orangutan. 

Some long while after the scared chimpanzees and gorillas had found 
a secure refuge in the dense woods of West C^entral Africa the earli- 
est types of humanity who had entered the 
Dark Continent were also pushed toward 
this gloomy forest b}' the inroads of superior 
tribes, and some of their descendants exist 
there at the present day. 

THE ANCESTORS OF THE APE-IJKE MEN. 

It ma}^ be assumed as the most probal)lo 
of all the theories on the subject that the 
human type emerged from the ape some- 
where in Asiii, possibly in Southern Asia, AiK-i.ke type, MumuKie. veiiow- 
inasmuch us the real missing link, Pithe- 

canthro])us crfx-tus, has be(^ discovered fossil in flaAa. In any case 
early man a))poars to have had an inunense de\'el()])nu'nt in and around 
th(^ Indian Peninsula, and ])()ssihly there or thereabouts developed the 
three main tyi)es which he exhil)it.s at the present day — the ^Vlongolian, 
th(> Caucasian, and the negro. Tlie pressure of superior races drove 
the negro types out of Southern Asia eastward to the Andainans, 
Malacca, New (Tuiiuvi. the I'acilic Islands, and Tasmania, and westward 
across Baluchistan, Mesopotamia, and Arabia to Africa. * * *

Suniniing- up the o:^pei'iences of many Afrk-an travelers, tooether 
with my own observati.onti,'4 should venture to say tliat there is a prog-- 
nathous beetling-browed, \short-le<4'ged, long-armed ''ape-like" type 
of negro, dwelling in pariah tribes or ei'opping up as reversionary 
individuals in a l)etter-loolving people, to be 
met with all down Central Africa, from tiie 
Bahr-al-Clhazal to the upper waters of the 
Zaml)ezi and westward from the Blount 
Elo-on and I)ritish East Africa to Portuguese 
Guinea. I have seen during my experience 
in British Central Africa very prognatlious 
ape-like negroes coming from the regions 
roundabout tiie Congo-Zambezi watiU'shed. 
They were slaves in Arab caravans. Messrs. 

Grogan and Sharp noticed this strange I'ygmy wnman. 4 foot i.; inchr.s in 
simian type between Lake Kivu and Lake "wgu. 

All)ert Pxlward. on tiie eastern edge of the C-ongo forest. Knowing 
nothing at the time of their ol)servations in this respect, I was much 
struck on entering the countries west of Kuwenzori at the ape-lilce 
appearance of some of the negroes whom I encoun- 
tered. These were ostensibly members of the 
Bakonjo or Baand)a trilies on the western Hanks of 
that snowy range, or they were pariahs dwelling 
by themselves on the fringe of the great Congo 
forest, west of the Semliki River. This a])e-like 
t3'pe was generally known to the surrounding 
negroes as "'" Banande.'" Whenever I encountered 
a rather brutish individual in this part of the 
country, he always turned out to be a ^lunande, 
l)ut I am not able to s'ay that tlun-e was any deli- 
lute ape-like tribe known as '* lianande." On the 
contrary, whilst here and ther(> prognathous short- 
logged individuals existed in separate conununi- 
ties in a pariah like condition, \ery often they 
might be the oti'spring of l)akonjo, Babira, 
Baamba, Lcndu, or Bambuba peoples, who, in 
their ordinary type, were decidedly not simian, 
but who may have mingled in times past with the 
lowest stratum of the aboriginal population, with 
from Semliki forest (Mui.- the Tcsult that the apc-Hkc stiU cropped up by 
^'^""""'^ occasional reversion. I should also observe that 

similar prognathous, long upper-lipped, short-legged negroes reap- 
pear, though in a less marked form, among the Bantu people on the 
western slopes of Mount Elgon, in the dense forests clothing the 
thinks of that huge extinct volcano. ''^ * *

482 THE PYGMIES OF THE GREAT CONGO FOREST. 

So far I have given the result of a general impression on the e3"e of 
various travelers when I have spoken of these negroes in the forested 
regions and border lands of the Uganda Protectorate l)eiu2" "ape-like." 
But I should state that the skulls examined, the photographs of the 
physical appearance studied, the measurements of head and body 
analyzed do not enable scientific anthropologists to indorse the term 
" ape-like " which has been used by myself and others to describe these 
negroes of degraded aspect. They offer sufficient general resemblance 
to the forest Pygmy type to be classed with them, perhaps in a group 
which I have st3ded (for want of a better name) the "Pygmy-Prog- 
nathous." '^ * * The resemblance between the pygmies and these 
Banande would appear to be osteological. Outwardly there is no 
special likeness between the two groups. Further evidence may show 
that the ape-like type may crop up in any negro race, whereas there 
can be do doubt that the forest pygmies are a well-marked and distinct 
type of negro. 

Even before the negro quitted Arabia to invade and occupy the 
greater part of Africa he ma}' have developed a pygmy t} pe, or have 
had a tendency to generate races of stunted stature. Remains which 
have been found in Sicil}^, in Sardinia, in Liguria, and the Pyrenees, 
including a curious little statuette fashioned bv men of the Stone Age 
discovered in the last-named locality, hint at the possibilit}?^ of men of 
this p.ygmy negro type having spread over part of P^urope. It has 
been even suggested by more than one anthropologist of authorit}^ that 
a dwarf-negroid race ma}^ have at one time existed in northern Europe, 
and by an exaggeration in legend and story of their peculiar habits — 
habits strangely recalling the characteristics of the little dwarf people 
of the Congo of the present day — have given rise to the stories of 
kobolds, elves, sprites, gnomes, and fairies. Like some of the Bush- 
men (who are, however, an independent development or an arrested 
type of negro) who inliabited South Africa when it Avas first discov- 
ered by Europeans, and who still exist iii the southwestern part of 
that continent, like the P^uropean and Asiatic races of the early Stone 
Age, these negro dwarfs in bleak or poorly forested regions no doubt 
lived in caves and holes, and the rapid manner in which they disap- 
peared into these holes, together witli their baboon-like adroitness 
in making themselves invisible in squatting immobility— a faculty 
remarkabl}' present in the existing dwarfs of the Congo forest — gave 
rise to the belief in the existence of creatures allied to man who 
could assume at will invisibility. Traits in the character of the Congo 
dwarfs of the present day recall iiresistibly the tricks of Puck, of 
Kol>in Goodfellow, of the gnome.5 and fairies of German and Celtic 
tradition. ^ * '^

lects of the bettor-looking- people who are nearest to them. Some of 
these ape-like men have skins of a dirt}- yellowish brown. The head 
hair is hlack and thick. .Beard, mustache, and whiskers are fairl}- abun- 
dant. The eyes are deep set and the overhung- brow ridge is extremely 
marked. The upper lip is long, and neither of the lips is so much 
everted as in the ordinary negro. The body is covered nearly all over 
b}' a tine 3'ellowish down, not apparent at any great distance, but tend- 
ing to accentuate the yellow appearance of the skin. There is great 
prognathism, and the chin is weak and retreating. They appear to be 
rather stupid, timid, and unintelligent. They live in very rude hab- 
itations of boughs and leaves and spend their time chieHy luuiting and 
trapping small mammals. They also live a good deal on honey and 
bee grubs. It would seem, however, on the western tlanks of Kuwen- 
zori and in the forests northwest of the Semliki Riv(M- as though 
superior I'aces had occupied the country once given over to the ape- 
like type and had mixed with this inferior people, so that the ape-like 
physiognomy may crop out again and again in races whose average 
numbers exhibit a higher type of feature and tigure. 

THE DESCENDANTS OF THE PYGMIES OF HERODOTUS. 

The Congo forest also shelters within its recesses at the present da}' 
those curious l\ygmy negroes who appear to be connected distantiv 
with the Bushmen of South Africa. These p3^gmies were, in all prob- 
al)ility. well known to the ancient Egyptians. Traders and slave 
traders who journeyed up the Nile from Egypt in ancient dav-v, and 
who brought back curious beasts from the black man's coiuitrv. also 
returned with specimens of these little dwarfs. The pygmies also are 
written about by Herodotus, as everybody knows. The ''cranes ' with 
whom they fought were probably the ostriches of the Sudan. Per- 
sistent stories have been circulated from time to time of the existence 
of pygmy race-, or pygmy types in the forests of the Atla> Mountains 
in northwest Africa. Still more remaikable, fos>il remains in Sicily, 
Sardinia, and the Pyrenees would seem to indicate the existence in 
Mediterranean Europe at one time of a negrito type, and a rude stat- 
uette found in the Pyrenees, and attributed to the Stone Age, would 
seem to show that these pygmies lingered on long after the invasion 
of the country l\y -uperior races. ^" '' ''" 

The little ])ygmies of the Congo forest do not lliemsclves cultivate 
or till the soil, but live mainly on the Hesli of beasts, bird<, and lep- 
tiles, on white ants, bee giubs, and larv.x^ of certain burrowing beetles. 
Nevertheless they are tond of i)ananas, and to satisfy their hankering 
for this sweet Iruit they will come at night and rob the plantations of 
their Dig, black agnculturai neighbors. If the robbery is taken m 
good part, or if gifts in the shape of ripe bananas aie laid out in a 
likely «-pot for the pygmy visitor who comes silently <n the darkness

or dawn, the little man will show himself grateful and will leave 
behind him some night a return present of meat, or he will be found 
to have cleared the plantation of weeds, to have set traps, to have 
driven off apes, l)aboons, or elephants while his friends and hosts 
were sleeping. Children, however, might be lured away from time' 
to time to follow the dwarfs, and even mingle with their tribe, like 
the children or men and women carried off' by the fairies. On the 
other hand, it is sometimes related that when the negro mother awoke 
in the morning her bonn}^, big, l)lack child had disappeared and its 
place had been taken b}^ a frail, 3'ellow, wrinkled pygmy infant, the 
changeling of our stories. Anyone who has seen as nmch of central 
Africa as I have and has noted their merry, impish ways, their little 
songs, their little dances, their mischievous pranks, unseen, spiteful 
vengeance, quick gratitude, and prompt return for kindness can not 
but be struck by their singular rescm})lance in character to the elves 
and gnomes and sprites of our nursery stories. At the same time we 
must be on our guard against reckless theorizing, and it may be too 
much to assume that the negro species ever inhabited Europe in spite 
of the resemblance between the stone implements of paleolithic man 
and those of the modern Tasmanians, and the Tasmanians were negroid 
if not negro. Paleolithic man in Europe may have been more like 
the Veddah, the Australian, the Dravidian, the Ainu than the Bush- 
man or Congo p.ygmy. Undoubtedly (to my thinking) most '-fairy" 
m^^ths arose from the contemplation of the mysterious habits of dwarf 
troglodyte races lingering on still in the crannies, caverns, forests, 
and mountains of Europe after the invasion of neolithic man. But 
we must not too widely assume that these extinct P3'giuy races were 
negroes. They might well have been the dwarfed descendants of 
earlier and less definite human species; they may have been primitive 
Mongols or Eskimos. All the three species, or su))species, of IFoiiio 
have developed separately, repeatedly, and concurrently dwarf and 
giant races. Tall peoples have arisen inde[)endently one after the 
other in Patagonia, in equatorial Africa, in north Africa, Syria, north- 
ern P^urope, and Polynesia. Stunted races have been evolved in 
several parts of Africa, in Scandinavia, Japan, the Andaman and 
Philippine archipelagoes, or among the Eskimos. 

I am not inclined now to advocate the theory that the Congo pyg- 
mies of equatorial Africa are necessarily connected in origin with the 
South African Bushman. Some Bushmen tribes in southwest Africa, 
where better food conditions prevail, are scarc(dy dwarfs. The Bush- 
men and Hottentots are obviously closely interrelated in physical 
structure, but I can see no physical features (other than dwarfishness) 
which arc obviously peculiar to both Bushmen and Congo pygmies. 
On the contrary, in the large and often protuburent eyes, the l)road, 
flat nose with its exaggerated aloe, the long upper lip and but slight

deo-ree of oversion »of the inner mucou.s .surface of tlie lips, the 
abundant hair on heatl aiid body, relative absence of wrinkles, of 
steatopyoy, and of hig-li, protruding cheek bones, the C-ongo dwarf 
differs markedl}^ from the Hottentot-Bushman t3q3e. It is true that 
some of the Congo pygmies intercalate their speech with faucal gasps 
in place of guttural consonants, but this defect in pronunciation need 
not necessarily contain any reminiscence of the Bushman clock. There 
is one language spoken in eastern equatorial Africa (in the German 
sphere) which has the clicks — the Sandawi. But this, though it may 
be a relic of extremely ancient days, when the ancestors of the Hot- 
tentots were dwelling in east Africa, is not at the present time spoken 
by a people offering marked physical resemblances to the Congo 
pygni}" or to the south African Hottentot. 

In short, it w^ould seem to the present writer that there is at present 
no evidence of any more relationship between the forest pygmies of 
equatorial Africa and the desert pygmies of southwestern Africa than 
the fact that both are early branches of the negro stem which prol)ably 
diverged simultaneously at a remote period from the Ethiopian st(X'k— 
sharing a few similar features in conunon — the one to hide in the 
forests between the Sahara and the Zambezi watershed, and the other 
to range over the prairies, steppes, and deserts of eastern and southern 
Africa. Perhaps the forest pygmies of to-day are more ninirly allied 
to the west African Bantu and Nile negroes than they are to the Bush- 
man-Hottentot group, which last is a section of the negro subspecies 
somewhat clearl}' marked off and separated from other negro races. 

Many centuries ago these stunted little negroes — of yellowish skin 
and somewhat hairy bodies, of large heads, and of noses not oidy flat 
but with the wings much developed, and rising as high as the central 
cartilage of the nose — must have been the principal inhabitants of the 
Uganda Protectorate, sharing these wide and varied territories of 
forest, swamp, steppe, and park land with the prognathous t3"pe aljove 
described. At the present day, however, the number of actual t3^pical 
pygmies existing in th<? Uganda Protectorate is very small, and theii" 
range is probably confined to a belt of forest lying to the east and 
west of the Semliki River, and perhaps to the dense woods on the 
southeast shores of the Al])ert Edward Lake. They are much more 
abundant in the Congo Free State, in whose forests they exist in a 
more or less undilated type southward to the verge of Angola, and 
north and noi'thwest to the vicinity of the Barh-al-(<hazal and the 
German Cameroons. This pygmy type is also found within the terri- 
tory of the German Cameroons, and in the interior of French Congo 
and (Taboon. It may even be found still to exist in the very remote 
parts of British Nigeria. 

Dwarf negro races, possibly related to the Congo pN'gmies, are found 
m the vicinity of Lake Stephanie, in northeastern Africa, while the

dwarf type makes its appearance here and there in the eastern part of 
the Kingdom of Uganda (in tlie forests of Kiag-^e), in the nomad of 
the Andorobo (a people of hunters which, in half-servile connection 
with the Masai, wanders over the greater part of eastern Africa 
between the Victoria Nyanza and the vicinit}" of the Indian Ocean), 
and amongst the people on the west and north of Mount Elgon/' No 
doubt, as Africa becomes more closely examined, the Pygmy type may 
be found to crop up elsewhere, either living as a separate people or 
reappearing as a re vei'sionary type in tribes of more typical negro appear- 
ance, who in times past have absorbed antecedent dwarf races, " "'■' * 

AN HISTORICAI. EXPLANATION OF THE (INOMES AND DWARFS OF FOLK- 
LORE. 

Other dwarf races of humanit}', belonging to the white or the Mon- 
golian species, may have inhabited northern Europe in ancient times, 
or it is just possible that this type of pygmy negro which survives 
to-day in the recesses of inner Africa may even have overspread Europe 
in remote times. If it did, then the conclusion is irresistible that it 
gave rise to most of the myths and beliefs connected with gnomes, 
kobolds, and fairies. The demeanor and actions of the little Congo 
dwarfs at the present day remind one over and over again of the traits 
attributed to the brownies and goblins of our fairy stories. Their 
remarkable power of becoming invisible by adroit hiding in herbage 
and behind rocks, their probable habits in sterile or open countries of 
making their homes in holes and caverns, their mischievousness and 
their prankish good nature, all seem to suggest that it was some race 
like this which inspired most of the stories of Teuton and Celt regard- 
ing a dwarfish people of quasi-supernatural attributes. The dwarfs of 
the Congo forest can be good or bad neighbors to the big black people 
according to the treatment they receive. If their elfish depredations 
on the banana groves or their occasional thefts of tobacco or maize are 
condoned, or even if they are conciliated by small gifts of such food 
left exposed where it can be easily taken, they will in return leave 
behind them in their nightly visitations gifts of meats and products of 
the chase, such as skins or ivory. I have been informed by some of 
the forest negroes that the dwarfs will occasionally steal their children, 
and put in their phices pygmy babies of ape-like appearance — change- 
lings, in fact — bringing up the children they have stolen in the dwarf 
tribe. These collections of pygmies, which one can scarceh^ call tribes, 
certainly exhibit from time to time individuals of ordinary stature, and 
with features not strongly resembling those of the pygmy type. 

«The resemblance of the dwarf types in West Elgon to the Congo pygmies is 
unquestionable; but I am not sure that the dwarf element in the Dok(j of northeast 
Africa and the Andorobo is not of Bushman rliaracteristics.

TWO rVl'KS Ol' DWARFS. 



The Coiig'o pygmies' appear , to be cli\ isihle into two types, acc-ording- 
to my own observations' and to tliosi^ of })i*eceding travelers — one with 
a reddish or 3^ellowish-brown skin and a tendenev to red in the head 
hair, and the other a blaek-skinned type with entirely black head haii". 
It is possible that the original type of dwai'f had a dii'ty l)rown skin, 
and a tendency to red ])oth in the body and head hair, and that this 
t^'pe mingled anciently with th(> tirst true negro invaders of the forest — 
a people with decidedly 1)lack skins — and produced a black type of 
dwarf, which now seems to exist conjointly with tlie red or yellow 
P3"gmy; that is to say, in the same 
family of pygmies there may be 
both types. In stature, perhaps, 
the black type tends to be slightly 
taller than the other. The tallest 
specimen of pygmy measured l)y me 
or b}' ni}' assistants was about 5 
feet in height; but the average alti- 
tude for men was -i feet 7 inches, 
and for women 4: feet "2 inches. 
Several of the men measured b\^ 
me wen^ only 4 feet 2 inches in 
height. One adult woman was just 
under 4 feet. There are two fea- 
tures which markedly' distinguish 
these dwarfs from other negroes — 
the shape of the nose and the long- 
upper lip. The nose has a very low 
bfidge, and is exceedingly broad. 
The upper lip, besides being long 
and prognathous, is not so much 
everted as in the ordinary negro. 
The chin is ver}^ weak and receding. 
The neck is short, and the head 
is sunk rather l)etween the shoul- 
ders, though not so markedly as in 
the ape-like types referred to in the lirst part of this article. The legs 
are short in proportion to the bod}^ though they are usually sturdy 
little limbs. The feet are rather large, and nmch inclined to turn in, 
with the big toes pointing inward when they are l)rought together in a 
standing attitude. Hair on the face is present in many of the dwarfs. 
Some of the dwarfs have distinctly long beards, l)ut 1 have myself seen 
only one with a beard of (> inches in length. Belgians and Ai'abs who 
have traveled through the Congo forests have, however, assured me 
that the}^ haVe met dwarfs at times who possessed l)eards of consider- 




iMeasuring the height of .ijiNgin}. TheEnglish- 
iiian is 5 feet 11 iiirhes; the pygmy, 4 feet 6 
inches. 



488 THE PYCiMIES OF THE GREAT 0()N(JO FOREST. 

able leng'th. The hair on the bod}' is reall}- of two Iviiids. There is, 
first, in man}' of the dwarfs — men and women — a sur\'ival in the adult 
of that hair which appears in the fetus in all human races, a soft 
brownish down. In addition to this survival of prehuman hair, the 
dwarfs possess, very often markedly, a development of hair that is 
peculiarlj" associated witli the human species — namely, a fairly thick 
growth over the chest and stomach, in the armpits, and in the pubic 
region; also on the arms and legs. It is on the under parts of the 
body, curiously enough, that apes and monkevs tend to a decrease of 
hair. It is therefore somewhat curious that where bod}' hair most 
frequently appears in the human race, it should be so often on the 
under side of the body, where (especially in the slightly stooping atti- 
tude which earl 3^ man assumed) the hair is of less protection to the 
skin from the rain than if it grow on the back. In the p3'gmies this 
human ))ody hair on the chest and stomach is black or blackish brown, 
and curly, like the hair of the head. 

The dwarfs seldom wear an3^thing in the wa3' of ornament, and go 
about in their forests quite naked; but when in contact with negroes 
who wear a certain amount of clothing, the dwarfs will put on an apron 
of leaves or bark cloth sulhcient to serve the purposes of decency. 
Their ears are not pierced. The only aesthetic adornment which they 
appear to adopt is the piercing of two holes in the upper lip. (Tliis 
can be clearly' seen in the head and bust of a dwarf woman.) Into the 
punctures the3' insert iiow^rs, teeth, or porcupint^ (juills. 

HOW THEY JAYY. IN THE FOREST. 

The dwarfs are excessiveh' shv in the forest, and are only visited 
with the greatest difficulty. The3' usually seem at the present da3' to 
attach themselves in thiMr conmmnities to the outskirts of the tribes 
of big negroes, with whom they usually cnti'r into friendh' relations. 
For a white man to see them in their homes it requires that one of 
these big negroes who is in friendly relations witli the pygmies should 
go out into the forest and call to them loudly and repeatedly before a 
P3'gmy has suflicient confidence to show himself. Once theii' confi- 
dence is gained they will, no doul)t, come in numbers. Even then it 
is extremely difficult to make inquiries of them concerning their life 
and customs. 

The Congo p3'gmies keep no domestic animals, and do not practice 
agriculture. They live entindy ])y hunting, and cat the ilcsh of mon- 
keys, of almost all other beasts, and ))irds, which they capture in their 
snares or shoot with their arrows, and thev also feed on c(n'tain grubs, 
on hone3', and on the bee grubs found in the honeycomli. Tlu^v range 
the forests far and wide, indiilerent Avhether they l()s(> thcdr wa;'' or 
not, since the3^ sleep and feed in the forests and are in a sense alwa3\s

at home. Seeniiiig-lj they have only kiu)wii the une of metal (iron) by 
their contact with negroes of .superior i*ace. Before this contact they 
seeni to have used weapons and iiuplenients of wood, possibly also of 
ston(\ iM'cn at the present day tliey not infrequent!}' use wooden 
arroNvs. 

Their huts are about -t feet high and about -i feet in diameter, and 
are usually built of withes or l)ranches stuck into the ground at ])oth 
ends, in a semicircle. Over this framework of l)ent l>oughs a thatch 
of large leaves is laid on, and a small hole is left at the side, through 
which the little pigui.v crawls in to lie on his bed of leaves. The hus- 
band and wife (they seldom marry more than one wife) may share the 
same hut, but the children as soon as they have left the breast are put 
each into little huts l)}- themselves. Some of those tiny habitations are 
absurdh' small. 

NO LANGUAGE OF THEIK OWN. 

The dwarfs appear to hav«* no language of theii- own, ))ut simply to 
talk more or less imperfectly the tongue of the l)ig negroes who are 
their nearest neighbors. Thus the dwarfs whom Stanley encountered 
on his various journeys across C'ongoland were always found to ))e 
speaking corrupt P)antu dialects, or in one instance a language scarcelv 
difi'ering fi'om ^lanyema. Tludr pronunciation of these languages is 
imj)erfect, and they are uuich given to replacing certain consonants 
by little gasps, and sometimes by a sound which faintly recalls the 
South African click. They speak with a singularly uuisical intonation, 
their speech being almost intoned. Their pronunciation of words is 
rather staccato, each syllable l.)eing pronounced separately and dis- 
tinctly. •'• ■" ■'• 

It is, of course, a hard thing to believe that prior to the invasion of 
the great west central African forest ])y the l)ig black agricultural 
negroes the pygiiiy autochthones possessed no language but inarticulate 
cries and gestures." Nevertheless, it would seem to be a fact that the 
pygmies, though so distinct a race, have no language peculiar to their 
race, but, wherever they are, speak (often imperfectly) the tongue of 
their nearest agricultural, settled, normal-sized neighbors. Again, it 
is strange that this little people should speak impcn'fectly these bor- 
rowed tongues, because individuals transported from the pigmy milieu 
have picked up rapidly and spoken correctly Sudanese Arabic, Kun- 
yoro, Luganda, Kiswahili, and Kinyaiuwezi. ]t is, however, l(\ss sin- 
gular an anomaly than the contrast between the brutish lives led hy 
the pyguiies in their wild state — lives, perhaps, in al)sence of human 
culture nearer to the beast than is the case with any recently existing

race of men known to us — and the vivacious intellig-ence, mental adroit- 
ness, almost fairy-like deftness they exhibit when dwelling- with Euro- 
peans. No one can fail to be struck with the mental superiority they 
exhibit under these novel circumstances over the big- negro, whose own 
culture in his own home is distinctly higher than that of the forest 
pygmies. * "' " They are very fond of singing and dancing, and 
the little songs that they croon are distinct!}^ melodious, while specta- 
tors are kept in tits of laughter by their truly droll and elfish antics. 
When they give a musical performance they are fond of seating them- 
selves in a semicircle. In their own homes, on these occasions, they 
beat drums, which are made of sections of hollow trees covered with 
skin. While thus seated, and beating drums, they chant songs, and 
dance, so to speak, all over their bodies, striking the ground with their 
elbows and hips, knees and hands, wagging their heads, and heaving 

their stomachs up and down. 
The dances which they per- 
form upright are sometimes 
of a markedly indelicate 
kind, though the dwarfs seem 
only to be carrying out the 
ancient traditions.

AN IMPORT4TION OF DWARFS INTO THIS COUNTRY. 

American readers liia}' be interested to learn tliat it is possible 
there still exist at the pi"esent day traces of African dwarf races in the 
negro population of the West Indies. This, at any rate, was the case 
forty or fifty years ago. There is a tradition to the effect that 
among the slaves shipped from the Congo regions at the end of the 
eighteenth century were specimens of dwarf races from the far inte- 
rior. In Trinidad and some of the southern islands of the West 
Indies these little people remained for a time distinct from the other 
slaves, and people of my ac([uaintance still living have seen and spoken 
to them. They were recognized at the time as being quite distinct 
from the ordinary negro type, and were generally known as the 
" Conp-o dwarfs." 



GUAM AND ITS PEOPLE." 



l^v AV. E. Saffoki). 



The Marianne Ishuuls, or Ladrones, form a chain about 420 miles 
long in a north and .south din^ction and lying about four days' run Iw 
steamer to the eastward of the Philippines. More definitely speaking, 
they extend from 18 ' 14' to 20' 30' north latitude and lie between 
142 ;-)!' and 143" 40' east long'itude. They are of voleanie origin and 
are surrounded by eoral reefs. In the northern islands there arc^ a 
num])er of volcanoes in full activity, but in the south volcanic action 
had ceased long before their discovery. 

(luam, the largest and most important member of the group, is the 
only island belonging to the United States, the remainder having been 
sold by Spain to Germany after the close of the late war. It is at the 
extreme south of the chain and at present has a population of t>,r)76.'' 
The island is of irregular shape and is about 21) miles long from north- 
northeast to south-southwest. At its narrowest part, near the middle, 
it is less than 4 miles across; near the ends the breadth is from T to 
miles. 

The northern |)()rti()n ot" the island consists of a mesa, or plateau, an 
ancient coral reef, elevated al)out 150 feet above the sea level, with 
one or two peaks of no great height extending through it. It is with 
out streams or springs, owing to the porous nature of the coral, except 
in the immediate vicinity of th(^ peaks referred to, where in the wet 
season there is for a time a supply of water. Near the middle t)f the 
island, m the inunediate vicinity of Agana, the ca[)ital, there is a large 
spring from which a copious sup])ly of water issues. This, after slowly 
oozing through an extensive swamp — an ancient lagoon tinds its way 
into the sea by means of a river, the channel of which las been 
artiticially lengthened and turned for a mile parallel to the c nist for 
the convenience of the natives. The southern portion of the island is 
principally of volcanic formation, with several peaks which scarcel}' 
exceed a thousand feet in height. It contains a number of streams,

some of which lose themselves beneath the surface for a time and 
reappear issuing from caverns. As in most calcareous formations, 
funnel-shaped sink holes are of frequent occurrence, the water drain- 
ing into them sometimes reappearing near the beach in the form of 
springs, or spurting forth in places from beneath the sea. 

Soil. — Near the junction of the volcanic and coral formations the 
limestone presents a crystalline structure, pure crystals of carbonate 
of lime being frequently found; and nodules of flint similar to those 
from European chalk formations are met in certain localities. The 
soil of the greater part of the island is thin and red. It owes its color 
to the oxide of iron present in the disintegrated coral of which it is 
principally composed. In the valleys and forests there is an accumu- 
lation of vegetable mold, and in swampy places the soil is black, rich, 
and suitable for the cultivation of rice. 

Climate. — Guam is situated on the dividing line between the north- 
east trade winds and the area of the monsoons of the China Sea. From 
December to June the prevailing winds are from the northeast, the 
temperature is agreeable, the nights cool, and the air is refreshed by 
occasional showers. The most agreeable months are March, April, 
May, and June. During July and August southwest winds are fre- 
quent and are accompanied ))y heav}" rain squalls. Hurricanes may 
occur at almost an}^ time of the j^ear. They may be expected at the 
changes of the monsoons and are most frequent in the months of Octo- 
ber and November. They are often of such violence as to blow down 
the greater part of the native houses, la^nng waste the maize and rice 
fields, uprooting or breaking oil cocoanut trees, destro3ang the bread- 
fruit crop, tearing to shreds plantains and banana plants, and killing 
fowl and cattle. Vessels at anchor in the harbor are frequently swept 
from their moorings and cast upon the reef, as the letter books of the 
Spanish governors of the island will show. Hurricanes are usually 
followed b}^ scarcity of food. The natives, who ver}^ seldom have a 
reserve on hand, are obliged at such times to go to the forest for wild 
yams and cycas nuts. 

Earthquakes are also frequent, but are not often violent. One of 
the most severe the island has known in historical times was that of 
1849, which destroyed the church and the government house in the 
village of Umata. Not long afterwards a number of natives of the 
Caroline Islands ai)peared at (luam, stating that their islands had been 
swept by enormous waves, and l)egging the governor for an asylum. 
The most recent occurred September 22, 1902, causing serious injury 
to the ])uilding used as the marine barracks, and killing several 
natives. 

Vegetation. — The flora of Guam, though possessing a number of 
species not known from other localities bears a general resemblance to 
that of many other volcanic, coral-fringed islands of the Pacific. In the

small tree, and a cycad, resembling a tree fern, with glossy, plume- 
like fronds.'' In the savannas, or places devoid of forest growth, 
occur A'ast stretches of a coarse grass called neti, patches of a l)rake- 
like fern,'' and scattered ironwood trees.' The iron wood grows also 
along the sandy beaches, especially on the east coast of the island, 
where the trees present a twisted and battered appearance, from the 
constant trade winds and the effects of the frequent hurricanes. In 
the rich \'alleys the betel-palm is plentiful; '"and near the banks of 
streams grow a tree fern (Alsophila) and giant arums.'-' Twining in 
the thickets are several species of morning-glories, plants of the bean 
family, wild yams, with sharp, wiry branching thorns, and a peculiar 
leafless, wir^^ parasite.'' In the swamps are dense growth of reeds 
and marsh ferns. The vegetation along the beach is like that of most 
tropical shores, made up of goats-foot convolvuhis, sea beans, and 
shrubby plants with fleshy and hairy leaves. On the rocky islets, 
besides the Cycas mentioned above, grows a fine hard-wood tree called 
chopag by the natives.' In the swamps are tangled growths of man- 
groves propped up on aerial roots and crimson-flowered Lumnitzeras. 

It may be of interest to those unfamiliar with Pacific insular floras 
to note the absence of pines, cedars, willows, walnuts, birches, cacti, 
and plants belonging to the I'ose famil}'; there are few composites and 
but one or two crucifers. It is prohable that none of the palms are 
indigenous, with perhaps the exception of a wild rattan (Calanms) of 
no economic value. 

Fauna. — Besides rats and mice the only mannnals are a large fruit- 
eating bat, or flying fox;-* a small insectivorous bat which during the 
daytime remains in caves; wild hogs, and a species of deer introduced 
into the island by Don Mariano Tol)ias, who w\as governor from 1771 
to 1774. The deer are now so al)undaiit as to cause serious damage to 
the corn crops and young cocoanuts. Goats are also to be ft)und on 
several of the outlying islets. Cattle and carabaos, or water buffalo, 
have been introduced and are used both for food and as beasts of 
burden. 

Among the l)irds are sc\'eral speci(\s of fruit doves, a pretty little 
fan-tailed fl^^catcher, scarlet-and-]»iack honey eaters with long, slender

iur\'('d beaks, black starling.s, a crow, a tawny-and-blue kingfisher 
(Halc3^on), which preys on lizards and insects instead of fish, the swift 
that makes edible nests, a little flycatcher named for De Freycinet, a 
small Zosterops with olive-green and yellow plumage, two rails (Hypo- 
tffinidia and Poliolimnas), and a gallinule, which frequent the swamps 
and taro patches; and along the shores a heron, a bittern, two curlews, 
the Pacific godwit, several sandpipers, plover, the wandering tattler, 
sanderling, snipe, and turnstones. The only bird of prey known to 
occur is the widely spread short-eared owl,'^' called momo by the 
nati\'os. The most beautiful of the ])irds are the fruit doves, one of 
which '' belongs to a group widcl}' spread in the Pacific, having rosy 
crowns, green backs, and yellow, purple, and orange plumage on the 
under surface. The onl}^ song l)ird is the reed warbler,^' a modest 
bird Ijearing a general resemblance to our catbird and having an 
exquisite song. 

Among introduced species arc the l)cautit"ul little Chinese partridge,'' 
brought to the island in recent years by Don Pedro Duarte, and the 
Philippine turtledove. There is also a fruit-eating dove, interesting 
from the great dissimilarity between the adult male and the female.' 
The former, called "apaka" by the natives, is considerably the larger 
and has a white head. The latter, called "paloman kunau," is of an 
almost uniform chocolate color. The natives think them to be dift'er- 
ent birds which live together. 

The best game bird is a wild duck, Anaj^ oi/sttdet/, a species peculiar 
to the island, but closely allied to Ajias ,<<tij)ercili(iris, which occurs in 
Samoa. Curlew, gallinules, plover, and doves are also hunted by the 
natives for food.-^ 

Among the reptiles are a large lizard (Varannus) which rol)s bird's- 
nests and eats 3'oung chickens and pigeons, a blue-tailed skink, one or 
two geckos which frequent the houses of the natives and run al)out 
the ceilings and walls catching insects, and a small snake (Tvphl<)])s), 
very nuich in general appearance like an earth worm, but with a hard, 
glossy skin composed of minute scales. 

Several species of land crabs occur, including the curious Biiyus 
latro^ or "robber crab," kept by the natives in captivity and fattened 
on cocoanuts for the table. In the streams there are shrimps and on 
the shores spiny lobsters; both of thes(^ are highly esteemed for food.

of the Bernice I'uuahd Bishop Museum of Hawaii for 11)00, the result 
of the work of Mr. ALviirSeale, who collected on the island in IIHH). 

Discovery. — The island -of Guam was discovered by Magellan on 
March (5, 1521, after a passage of three months and twenty days from 
the strait which bears his name. Among the accounts w ritten of his 
expedition, that of Antonio Pigafetta, of Vicenza, who accom})anied 
him, is full of valuable and interesting details, Pigafetta tells of the 
terrible suffering of his companions on their way across the waters of 
the unexplon^d occ^an; lunv their food failed, until they had oidy 
crumbling biscuit full of maggots to eat, all foul from the excrement 
of rats; how they were forced to eat the rats themselves, which ])rought 
a price of half a crown each, and, moreover, "enough of them could 
not be got;" how they even resorted to sawdust of wood, and the ox- 
hides used as chating gear in the rigging luider the main 3'ard, all 
stiffened and hardened by sun, rain, and wind, soaking them for sev- 
eral days in the sea, and then putting them "'"a little on the embers,''' 
The water thej^ had to drink was yellow and stinking, and the gums 
of nearly all were swollen with scurvy, and nineteen died, and twenty- 
ffve or thirty others fell ill "of divers sicknesses, both in the arms 
and legs and other plac(\s, in suih manner that ver}'^ few remained 
healthy.*' 

Two islands were sighted. l)ut only birds and trees were fouiul upon 
them and no su])plies could ]>e o))tained. These they called the Tnfor- 
tunate Islands. Finally three other islands were sighted, covered with 
rich vegetation and inhabited by many peopl(\ who came out to meet 
them in wonderful canoes, which seem to fairly Hy over the water. 
The sails were triangular-shaped mats woven of pandanus leaves and 
were supported on a yard after the manner of lateen sails. The mast 
was amidships. Instead of going about in tacking they simply shifted 
the sheet of the sail from one end of the canoe to the other, so that 
which had been the bow became the stern, and the stern ])ecame the 
bow. Parallel to the fore-and-aft line tliert^ was an outrigger or log, 
rigidly connected with the hull by cross pieces and resting upon the 
surface of the water. This served, both by its weight and buoyancy, 
to keep the nariow craft fiom <apsizing, and was kept always on the 
windward side by shifting th(> sheet as descrii)ed above. All of the 
boats were painted, some black and others red. They had paddles of 
the form of hearth shovels, which could l»c used for steering oi' pro- 
[)elling the boats." 

The ships came to anchor near a village on the soutiiernniost island, 
and the natives brought them refreshment of fruits. The sails were

furled and preparations were made to land, Avhen it was discovered 
that the skiff which rode astern of the Hag'shi'p was missing'. Siispect- 
inu- that the natives had stolen it, the captain-general went ashore with 
40 armed men, burned forty or lifty houses and many boats, and killed 
seven or eight native men and Avomen. He then returned to the ship 
with his skiff' and immediately set sail, continuing his course to the 
westward. 

"Before we went ashore [says Pig-afetta] some of our people who 
were sick said to us that if we should kill any of them, whether man 
or woman, that we should bring on l)oard their entrails, being per- 
suaded that with the latter they would be cured. 

"When we wounded souie of those islanders with arrows, which 
entered their bodies, they tried to draw forth the arrow now in one 
way and now in another, in the meantime regarding it with great aston- 
ishment, and thus did they who Avere wounded in the breast, and they 
died of it, which did not fail to cause us compassion. 

"Seeing us taking our departure then, they followed us with more 
than a hundred boats for more than a league. They approached our 
ships, showing us ffsh and pretending to wish to give them to us; l)ut 
when they Avere near they cast stones at us and fled. We passed under 
full sail among" their boats, Avhich with greatest dexterity escaped us. 
We saw among them some women who were weeping and tearing their 
hair, surely for their husbands killed l)y us." 

Ahor!(jin((l rnJiahUiOits. — The natives Avere described l)y the early 
navigators and missionaries as people of the stature of Europeans. 
They were lighter in color than the Filipinos, and the Avomen and 
children Avere fairer than the men. At the time of the discovery 
the men Avore their hair loose or coiled in a knot on top of the head. 
Later they are described as shaving the head, Avith the exception of a 
crest a1)Out a ffnger long, Avhich they left on the croAvn. Some of 
them Avere bearded. Pigafetta says that they Avere Avell formed, and 
in the I'eport of the earl}^ missionaries they were said to be n^ore cor- 
pulent and robust than Europeans, but with a tendency to obesity.

GUAM AND ITS PEOPLE. 499 

In their j^cmumiiI iippeiirance, lanoiuio-e, and customs tho people of 
Guam bore a resemblance- to the Tagalos and Visayans of the Philip- 
pine Islands. The vocabulary, however, was distinct, with the excep- 
tion of a few words of ^lalayan afiinity widely spread over the I'acitic 
(such, for instance, as th(^ names of sky. fowl, liiv. and a few others). 
Their grammatical form,, were very diti'erent from those of the Polyne- 
sians, tenses ])eino- expressed by the reduplication of syllables and the 
insertion and prehxing- of particles to the root of th*^ verb. 

Befon^ marriage it was customary for yovuig men to live in concu- 
binage with girls, whom they purchased from their parents by pres- 
ents. This did not injure a girl's prospects for marriage afterwards. 
Frequently a luimber of young men and young girls would live 
together in a large public house. Aft(M' marriage^ a husband contcMited 
himself with one wife and a wife with one husband at a time. 
Divorces were fre([uent, the children and household propert}" always 
going with the wife. The most frequent cause of divorce was jeal- 
ousy. If a woman disco^■ered her husl)an(l to be unfaithful, she called 
together the other women of her village, who armed themselves with 
spears and proceeded to th(^ house of the otfender. They would them 
destroy any growing cro[)s he might own and menace him with the 
spears until he was forced to tlee from tho house. Then th(\y took 
possession of everything they could tind, and sometimes even destroyed 
the house itself. AVhen a wife was unfaithful, the husband had a 
right to chastise her paramour, l)ut she went free from punishment. 

Caste distinctions were recognized and very strictly observed. The 
chiefs, called chamorris, owned vast plantations and cocoanut groves, 
which were handed down generation after generation to the heirs. A 
chief's rightful successor was his brother or his nephew, who, on 
coming into possession of the familv estate, changed his name to that 
of the chief ancestor of the family. 

The people were naturally superstitious. They venerated the bones 
of their anc(\stors, keeping the skulls in their houses in small baskets, 
and practicing certain incantations before thenr when it was desired 
to attain certain objec-ts. The spirits of the dead were called aniti, 
and were supposed to dwell in the forests, often visiting the villages, 
causing bad dreams and haviuii" especial sway over the fisheries. 
People dying a violent death went to a place called Zazarraguan, or 
the house of Chayh, where they sutfered torture fi'om i\ro and inces- 
sant blows. Those dying natiu'al death went to a subterranean })ara- 
dise where there were groves of cocoanuts, plantations of bananas, 
sugar cane, and other fruits in abundance. Certain men called 
makahna resembled the kahunas of the Hawaiians. They were sup-

posed to have power over the health of the natives, eould cause rain, 
and bring hick to the fishermen. As among' many Indian, Mahwan, 
and Polvnesian peoples, the}' were vcr}' careful not to spit near the 
house of another, undoubtedly through fear of sorcery, should an 
enemy possess himself of the spittle. 

Violent grief was shown on the death of a friend or relative, the 
people wailing and singing dirges expressive of their sorrow and 
despair, and recounting the n()])le (jualities of the dead. In the case 
of a chamorri's death the wailing was prolonged for several days. 
Small mounds were raised over the grave and were decorated with 
flowers, palm leaves, canoe paddles if the deceased was a fisherman, 
and spears if he was a warrior. The body was sometimes anointed 
with fragrant oil and taken in procession from house to house, as 
though to allow the spirit an opi)ortunity of choosing an abiding place 
among the homes of its kindred. 

On occasions of festivity the men and women would collect in 
groups, each l)y thems(dves, and, forming semicircles, sing and chant 
their legends and fa))les. Sometimes these songs would be in three- 
part harmony, '' treble, contralto, and falsetto." The songs were 
accompanied by appropriate gestures and movements of the body, the 
women using certain rattles and castanets made of shells. On these 
occasions the women adorned their foreheads with wreaths of flowers 
like jasmines, and wore belts of shells and bands from which hung 
disks of turtle shell, which was much prized among them. They 
wore skirts of fringe-like roots, which the earh" missionaries de(dared 
were '''rather like cages than garments.'' 

Though called Ladi'ones (thieves), the}' were so honest that their 
houses were left open and without protection, and very seldom was 
anything found missing. They were very hospitable and kind, as all 
the early accounts testify. It was not until they were given just cause 
that th(Mr attitude toward the Spanish changed, whereupon the latter 
declared that they had been mistaken in attrit)uting virtues to them. 

They dcclariHl that the foreigners l)rought to the islands rats, flies, 
mos(iuitoes, and strange diseases. The}^ liv(Hl with little restraint, 
matters of impoi'tance to the villages or to the general pu})lic being 
decided by assemblies of their chiefs and old men: l)ut these had little 
authority, and a native did pretty much what he pleased unless pre- 
vented from doing so by some one stronger than himself. 

Their arms were wooden spears pointed with' bones, and slings with 
which they threw oval-shaped stones with remarkable force and accu- 
racy, "as far," says one observer, "as an anjuebus can shoot." From 
their earliest 3'Outh they were accustomed to practice with these weap- 
ons, and often had contests of spear throwing, fencing, and throwing 
at marks. Often the stone was hurled with such swiftness that it 
would become embedded in the trunk of a tree. The women went to 
sea with their husbands for s))()rt. 'Hh"}' were line swinmiers, and as

thoy throw themselves into the water and came hounding- from wave 
to wave they reminded Pigarfetta of dolphins. 

Their houses were well nlade, thatched with palm leaves, and raised 
on wooden posts or on pillars of stone." They were divided into sev- 
eral rooms by partitions of mats. Their beds were mats woven from 
Pandanus leaves divided into strips of great fineness. Their boats 
were kept under shelter, large sheds being constructed for them near 
the sea, the stone or masonry pillars of which ma}^ still be seen. These 
stone pillars are held in awe by the present natives of the island, who 
think it unlucky to disturb them or even to linger near them. 

J^ire. — It was asserted by the early missionaries that the aboriginal 
inhabitants were ignorant of tire before the advent of the Spaniards. 
That this is a mistake is shown not only by the fact that their princi- 
pal food staples could not 1)e eaten without cooking, l)ut also by their 
words pertaining to tire and cooking, as guqfi (tire), <(p(^ (ashes), ((.so 
(smoke), twio (roast), nmrllla {^ame), plnigan (live coal), mTUjije (burn, 
V. t.), luuion. (burn v. in.), 8<>tne (boil), j)eha (cook in embers), vltnlidn 
(bake in ancient oven), and other words. Many of these words are 
to be found with slight modifications in other languages of Malayan, 
Melanesian, and Polynesian atiinities. 

Food. — The food of the aborigines consisted of tish, fowls, rice, 
l)read fruit, taro, yams, and bananas (Pigafetta calls them "figs a palm 
long""), cocoanuts, and mits of CyaiK clrc/nal/x.^ the poisonous prop- 
erties of which they removed by soaking and repeatedly changing the 
water, after wdiich they were cooked. For relishes they ate certain 
seaweeds, the nuts of the wild "almond," '' and a species of screw j)ine.'' 
Pandanus drupes, which are an important food staple^ in some Pacific 
islands, were not a })art of their domestic economy; and, although 
they had pigs at an earl}' date, it is probable that these were intro- 
duced after the diseovery, as some of the early navigators declare that 
the natives could not I)e induced to eat Hesh. The creamy juice 
expressed from the meat of ripe cocoanuts entered into the composi- 
tion of several of their dishes. They were ignorant of the manufac- 
ture of fermented tuba from the sap of the cocoanut, and had no 
intoxicating beverages before the arrival of the Spaniards. As was 
nearly the universal custom throughout the tropical Pacific, they 
cooked by means of stones which they heated in a hole in the ground, 
making alternate layers of food, leaves, and heated stones, souicwhat 
aft(M- th(^ manner of a New England clambake. 

N<(rcotics. — The kava pepper {Piper iiirthijxtictnn) was unknown to 
them; but its place may be said to have been taken by the betel pe})per, 
the leaves of which the}^ chcwcnl wrapped around a fragment of the

nut of the betel palm, with the addition of a pinch of lime. This habit 
is still universal among the natives of Guam. The betel thus pre- 
pared has an agreeable aromatic pungency, not unlike that of nutmeg. 
It imparts a fragrance to the breath, which is not disagreeable, but 
it discolors the teeth in time and causes them to crumble away, while 
the constant expectoration of saliva, red like blood, is a disagreeable 
habit. 

CuUt vated plants, — The principal plants cultivated ])y the natives 
before the discovery were the bread fruit — a sterile form of Arfocar- 
2?ux colli niuiuH, which is propagated by cuttings, or sprouts, from the 
roots; the dugdug, or fertile form of the same species, which also 
grew wild upon the island, 3nelding an edilde, chestnut-like seed, logs 
from which they made their largest canoes, bark for their aprons or 
loin cloths, and gum which served as a medium for mixing their paints 
and as a resin for paying the seams of their canoes; the betel palm 
{Areca catechu) and the ])etel pepper {Piper hetle),, which were undoubt- 
edly brought to the island in prehistoric times, as also were rice, sugar 
cane, and the species of Pandanus called aggak, from the leaves of 
which they made their mats, baskets, hats, and boat sails. Of this 
plant only one sex occurs on the island, and it nuist consequently be 
propagated by cuttings. Cocoanuts were also, in all probability, 
brought hither, as were several varieties of yams," separated by them 
into two groups, which, according to the shape of the leaf, they call 
nika and dago. A third species,* called gado, which now grows wild 
in thickets, is characterized by sharp, wiry, branching thorns near the 
ground, which serve to protect its starchy tubers from wild hogs. 
Several varietic^s of taro were cultivated, both in swampy places and 
on dry hillsides. Among the less important plants were the Polynesian 
arrowroot, called gabgab;" turmeric {Curcurna loriga), called mango; 
wild ginger oi- asngod halom-tano; and a species of red pepper, called 
doni. There were no edible oranges, mangoes, mangosteens, nor 
locpiats. A fruit nmch relished by the fruit-eating pigeons was the 
piod {Kimenia americana),, which resembles a small yellow plum with 
a slight flavor of bitter almond. 

Agricidtaral and otlter 'useful a?is.—Yov growing taro little art is 
required. Yams require more care; while bananas, breadfruit, and 
the textile pandanus, propagated by cuttings or sprouts, have to be 
severed from the parent stock, stuck into the ground, and occasionally 
watered. For the cultivation of rice — the only cereal of the aborig- 
ines — far greater skill is required on account of the necessary prepara- 
tion of the fields and the consti'uction of irrigating ditches. Rice was 
the principal staple furnished to vessels in considerable quantity. 
Oliver van Noort, who visited the island in 1(100, mentions it in his 
narrative, and the Nassau fleet in 1(525 bought it in bales containing

7o to SO ponnds cacli. At this time it was cultivated in many places 
oil the island, which iiulK-atcs no little industry and ontci'priso on the 
part of the natives. I dwell, on this point because the aborigines of 
Guam have been described as very indolent and of the lowest order 
of civilization, iotK)rant even of the art of making tire. Surely tlie 
people who constructed such marvelous "flying praos."" who dw(dt in 
commodious and well-l)uilt houses, and who carried on the art of agri- 
culture to the extent indicated by the narratives of the early expedi- 
tions of the Dutch, can not be classified as al)|ect savages. e\'en though 
their bodies were covered )>y very scant clothing. If encounters took 
place betwe(Mi them and the crews of visiting ships — and these crews, 
fresh from pillaging the coast of South America and accustomed to 
deeds of violence and nuirder, were in all prol)ability far from gentle 
in their treatment of the natives — they were designated as miserable 
infidels, to ''slay" whom was a legitimate pastime; while, if a Euro- 
pean was killed l)y one of them, without investigating the cause, he 
was declared to have ])een murdered, and his death was avenged by 
the burning of villages, ))oats, and boathouses, and by killing men, 
women, and children." They were branded with the name "Lad rones" 
for stealing a boat and some bits of iron; yi^t the Spaniards did not 
hesitate to steal human l)eings to sei've as slaves at their pumps.'' 

Arriral of Jcxu'ii ni/N.s/ti/Kir/ex. — For nearl}' a centurv and a half after 
the discovery no attiMupt was luade to colonize the island. Spanish gal- 
leons on their annual trips from New Spain to the Philippines stopped 
regularly at Guam for fresh water and provisions. On one of these a 
Jesuit priest, Padre Diego Luis de Sanvitores, was passenger. His 
heart was moved with pity for the natives living in spiritual darkness 
in this earthly paradise, and when he reached Manila he begged that 
he might be sent to them as a missionary. His request was refused, 
and it was not until he succeeded in getting a direct order from the 
King. Phili)) IV, that his wish was realized. A ship was ])uilt at 
Cavite, and Padre Diego was sent, together with several companions, 
to carry the faith to the Ladrones. 

He arrived at Agafia on March 3, 1(3()8, the ship having first pro- 
ceeded to Acapulco, Mexico, as was the custom, owing to the easterl}^ 
wdnds and the cui-rents wdiich prevail in the latitude of Guam. 
Sanvitores was full of zeal jind woi'ked with phenomenal success 
among the nati\'es. They received him with great kindness, giving 
him a dwelling })lace and l)uilding for him a church at Agana. Let- 
ters written by him to his superiors are full of interesting informa- 
tion concerning the nativ(\'^. He tells of their great regard for caste 
distinctions, their \eneration for the bones of th(>ir dead, their

practice of sorcery, and he regrets their lo\'e of worldly pleasures, 
their disinclination for serious occupations, and complains that their 
histor}' is ''obscured b}^ a thousand fables." 

After a time trouble arose between the missionaries and the natives. 
At first the chiefs insisted that the benefits of baptism should not be 
extended to the common people; then they began to doubt its 
efficiency, and man}' who had been baptized reverted to their former 
beliefs and practices. They resented the efforts of the missionaries 
to change their marriage customs, the destruction of the sacred bones 
of their fathers, and the forcible detention of children whom the mis- 
sionaries had taken to educate. Finally, after four years of unceasing- 
labor among them, Padre Sanvitorcs was killed while l)aptizing a child 
against the will of its father. 

Active measures were now taken to reduce the natives. The Queen 
of Spain, Maria Ana of Austria, widow of Philip IV, became inter- 
ested in their conversion and founded a college for the education of 
native youth, which she endowed with an annual income of 3,000 
pesos. In honor of her the group was named "Las Islas Marianas." 
The income from the fund bestow^ed by the Queen continued until the 
seizure of the island of Guam by the United States. 

The Jesuits continued in the island for a century. At their expul- 
sion, in 1769, in conformity with the edict of Carlos Til, their place 
■was taken by Recollet friars of the order of San Agostino. During 
their stay the Jesuits not onh^ introduced many useful plants and 
fruits from Mexico and from other countries, but the}^ taught the 
natives many useful arts and habits of industry, established extensive 
plantations, and brought to the island cattle, horses, mules, donkeys, 
goats, and carabaos, or water buffalo. The youths under their care 
were instructed in the elements of learning and in the Christian doc- 
trine, and were trained to serve as acolytes. They instructed thmn 
also in music. The inventory of their effects, taken at the time their 
property was seized by order of the King, is still in Guam. Among 
the items are "seven violins with their bows, three sweet flutes, two 
harps, and one viol." The inv^entory also includes a list of black- 
smith's tools, axes, planes, chisels, saws, and appliances for tanning 
lcath(M-, together with a good supply of agricultural implements, and 
the list of live stock and articles found on th(Mr farms showed that the 
latter were in a flourishing condition.

duced by the missionaries were maize, or iiidian corn, tobacco, 
oranges, lemons, limes, pineapples, cashew nuts, or maranones, pea- 
nuts, egg plants, tomatoes, and several species of Anona, besi(l(>s a 
numb(M' of leguminous vegetables and garden herbs. 

With maize, the chief article of cultivation, came the Mexican 
metatl and miuio for niakino" tortillas. Tobacco leaves were uscmI for

paying- the natives for their work. Most of the sweet potatoes grown 
wert^ sold to ships, t*lie natives contentino- themselves w^ith yams and 
taro, or breadfruit. Among the njedieinal plants brought from Mex- 
ico was Cassia alatd^ which is still called "acapulco;" and Pithecolo- 
hluiii (hdce^ called '■• kamachilis," was brought for the sake of its bark, 
which is used in tanning. Coffee and cacao were introduced later, 

3£<>dei'ii agi'U-ultiirc. — Maize is cultivated in patches varying from 
1 to 10 acres. It is planted on the highlands at the beginning of 
the rainy season. A second crop is obtained from the lowlands in the 
dry season. It must Ije shelled as soon as gathered, carefully dried to 
prevent molding, and stored in large earthen jars (brought from 
Manila, Japan, or China) for protection against weevils. In the low- 
lands, with deep soil, the fields may be plowed. In plowing, bullocks 
or carabaos are used, the latter preferaljly in wet places; the plow is 
of wood, with a single handle, and tipped with iron, usualh' forged 
by the village blacksmith from an old musket barrel. 

Coffee produces most prolitically, and in sheltercHl valleys whei'c the 
soil is deep and rich cacao of excellent quality is grown. 

Rice is cultivated very much as in the Philippines. The crop is 
frequenth" a failure, owing to drought or a blasting hurricane; and 
even in good seasons the crop is insufficient for the consumption of 
the inhabitants. It is one of the food staples of the island; and is 
now imported from Japan and the United States. 

Taro is cultivated both in Avet and in dry ground. It is nuuh eaten 
by the natives, as also are several species of yams. There are at least 
four varieties of sweet potatoes. It is interesting to note that the 
vernacular name for sweet potatoe — camote — is of American origin, 
and is still coumionly used among the Spanish-speaking people of our 
extreme Southwest. 

Tobacco is planted l)y nearly every family. It nuist be caivfully 
weeded and kept free from insect larvte, the most destructive of which 
is that of a sphinx moth. It is never cured nor allowed to ferment, 
but is simpl}^ hung under shelter and left to dry. The natives prefer 
their tobacco to all other kinds. They will not smoke foreign tobacco 
unless their own gives out. It is usually smoked in the form of loosel}' 
rolled cigars, made without paste, and wrapped with aga\(» or pine- 
apple ffber. 

Several kinds of Leguminos;e ar(^ cultivated both for the sake of 
their green pods and for their ripe seeds. One of the best is l^opJio- 
cavpus tetragoti()lohi(s^ the pods of which, eatc^n green and tender, have 
four longitudinal ruffle-like wings. Peanuts grow readily, in places 
lining the road from Agana to the port. Mandioc and arrowroot 
{Maranta ai'an<liiiacea) are cultivated, but not on an extensive scale; 
and tumeric and tacca, though gi'owing wild, are sometimes [)Ianted. 

The natives ha\'e become essentially an agricnlliiral and psistoi'al

people. Some of the changes brought a)>out ])y Spanish occupancy 
are shown in the accompanying iHustrations. Navigation is scarcely 
practiced by them. The wonderful flying praos have been replaced 
by small canoes of inferior type, which arc now used by the natives 
only for tishing. There are scarcely more than a dozen native boats 
in the whole island. For years what traffic was carried on between the 
islands of the group was by means of large canoes from the Caroline 
Islands. 

Another ligure shows the manner in which corn is spread out to dry 
in the streets upon mats of Pandanus leaves. The cast net shown in 
the figure of the lisherman is make of thi'ead twisted by hand from 
pineapple fiber; and the hide in process of tanning has been treated 
with an infusion of the bark of Plthecolohium dulct\ which, like the 
source of the leather itself, is an intrusion from America. 

With the exception of a few families living in rancherias, the natives 
inhaliit villages and go to their ranchos, or country places, for the 
purpose of feeding and watering their stock or for cultivating their 
fields. The town houses are well constructed; the}^ are raised from the 
ground on substantial, durable posts, or built of masonry with a base- 
ment or ""bodega," which is used as a storeroom, taking up the 
ground floor. Some of them are surrounded by balconies inclosed hy 
shutters or by windows with translucent bivalve shells for panes. The 
roofs are either of thatch or tile, the best thatch being that made of 
the leaflets of nipa palm. Many of the houses are provided with gar- 
dens, in which grow perennial eggplants, red peppers, bananas, plan- 
tains, ^'arious kinds of beans, squashes, and ornamental and useful 
shru))s and trees, including lemons, limes, pomegranates, sour sops, and 
sugar apples {Anona squiunosa). Frecjuently under the eaves, so as to 
receive the drippings from the roofs, are planted rows of bright-colored 
foliage plants; and among the fragrant-flowered species are the mil- 
leguas," the Egyptian henna ^' — a great bush covered with flowers which 
bear a general resenil)lance to and have the odor of mignonette — and 
the llangilang tree,'' from which the celebrated perfume is made. 

liancbos, as the country houses are called, may be constructed for 
the use of one or two persons or for a whole family. Many of them 
are intended oidy for temporary occupancy, the adjoining ground 
being allowed to lie fallow after crops have been raised on it for four 
or five years in succession. The usual form of a small rancho is that 
of a shed, with walls of cocoaiuit matting or wo\'en reeds and a roof of 
cocoanut thatch. Half of the hut is taken up by a split-])amboo plat- 
form, raised about 2 feet from the ground. This is the famil}^ ))ed. 
Beneath it are penned up each night the 3'oungest broods of chickens 
with their mothers, to protect them from rats, cats, and lizards. The 
larger fowls fly to the spreading limbs of a neighboring tree (the site

There are few masters and few servant- in (juam. A-, a lule. the 
farm is not too extensive to be cultivated b\' the family, all of whom, 
even the little children, lend a hand. Often the owners of neighbor- 
ing" farms work together in comnmnal fashion, one day on A*s corn, the 
next on B's, and so on, laughing, singing, and skylarking at their work, 
and stopping whenever they feel like it to take a drink of tuba from a 
neigli boring cocoanut tree. Each does his share without constrairtt, 
nor will one indulge so freely in tuba as to incapacitate himself for 
work; for experience has taught the necessity of temperance, and 
every one must do his share if the sen'ices are to be reciprc^cal. liy 
the time the 3'oung men have finished their round, the weeds are (piite 
high enough once more in A*s corn to require attention again. In the 
evening the}' separate, each going to his own rancho to feed his bulloek, 
p'i'^^, and chickens; and after a good supper they lie down for the 
night <jn a Pandanns mat spread over the elastic platform of s{>jit 
bamboo. 

If wealth consists in the abilit\' to gratify one's wants, the people 
of Guam may be called rich; and were it not for the frerjuent occur- 
rence of hurricanes life on the island would be almost ideal. None 
of the natives depends for his livelihood on either c-onmierce or a 
trade. There are men who can make shoes, tan leather, and cut 
stone for building purposes, but such a thing as a shoemaker, tanner, 
or mason who supports his family by his trade is unknown. In the 
midst of building a stone wall, the native who has consented to help 
do the work will probably sa\': " Excase me, Senor, but 1 must go to 
my rancho for three or four days; the weeds are getting ahead of my 
corn." And when one wishes to get some lime, the native to whom 
he goes for it may sav: "'After I have finished gathering my cocoa- 
nuts for copra I will get my boys to cut wood and make a kiln. 
Never fear, Senor, j'ou shall liave the lime within six weeks." 

The result of this condition of societv is that when a father dies the 
wife and children are not left destitute, as would be the case if they 
depended on the results of his handiwork alone. The crops continue 
to ripen and are gathered in due time by the family; the ^eeds and 
worms are kept out of the tobacco; the coffee bushes bend each year 
undei- their weight of berries, and the cocoanuts, as asual. yield their 
annual dividend.. Indeed, in most cases the annual income in pro-

visions is amply sufficient to keep the family supplied with its simple 
clothing, some Hour and rice Ijrought b}- the traders from flapan or 
America to exchange for copra, and perhaps a few delicacies, a ribbon 
or two, and a new picture of the patron saint to place in the little 
alcove of the side room, where the light is always kept burning. 

While in Guam 1 knew of onh" one person on the island dependent 
upon charity, and she w^as an old blind woman without children or 
near relatives. Even blindness does not make beggars of the natives. 
On one occasion, while crossing the island to" report on the suitability 
of a certain ba}" as a landing place for the proposed telegraph ca])le, I 
visited a house in which a man and his wife were both blind. He was 
engaged in twisting pininxpplc til)ei' into thread for cast-nets. The 
surrounding farm was in a tiourishing condition — here a field of corn, 
there a patch of tobacco, a little farther away a grove of y ovuig cocoanuts 
set out evenly in rows; near the house a thicket of coli'ee bushes red 
with l^erries; about the door betel nuts drying in the sun; at the edge 
of the forest a cow, very much like an Alderney, tethered to a tree to 
keep her out of a neighl)oring patch of sweet potatoes, and in a newly 
cleared spot, where the stumps of trees were still standing, I saw a 
rich growth of taro and some yam vines twining up a circle of poles 
inclined against a tree. 

A tine, strapping youth came in to prepare dinner. He was the son 
of the, old people and had been born before the\' were stricken with 
the disease which caused their blindness. It was he who planted the 
garden, who'cleared the forest, cared for the cow, the pigs, and chick- 
ens, and collected the l)etel nuts. He climbed a cocoanut tree near the 
house and l)rought in a bam])oo joint full of tuba, delicious as cider 
just 1)eginning to turn sharp, which, after putting across the top .some 
leaves to strain it, heoliered us withtheniaiuierof aSoanish caballero. 
The next day, on my return from the opposite shore of the island, he 
saddled the sleek little cow and insisted on my riding her back to the 
city, he and the little calf running along by my side as the cow trot- 
ted over the good roads, and wading through the deep mud, as our way 
led across marshy places overarched by great bamboos. On all the 
farms we passed the natives were planting cocoanuts. There were fields 
of corn, sweet potatoes, and tol)acco. The young tobacco plant*^, 
recently transplanted, were each sheltered from the sun by a section 
of cocoanut leaf stuck into the ground at an angle. Every l)ody 
seemed contented and all had a pleasant greeting for the stranger. 
Some of the shy little children brought out by their parents to see us 
took my hand to kiss it, as is the custom in the island on the occasion 
of a visit from a dignitary of the church or state or the head of a 
famil}'. It seemed to me th:it I had discovered Arcadia, and when 1 
thought of a letter 1 had received from a friend asking whether 
1 believed it would l)e possible to ''civilize the natives," 1 felt like 
exclaiming, '"God forbid!"

The intimate cultural connection between tlie ancient peoplet^ since 
the beji'innino- of history is an undeniabh^ fact. It is almost a truism 
that original ideas are l)ut exceptions to the overwhelming- num])er of 
reproduced ones, and yet even learned men are strono-ly disinclinc^d to 
acknowledge indebtedness for elements of culture, lest it interfere 
with the pleasino- thought of development within one's own narrow 
circle. It is ))ut natui'al to delight in a structure l>uilt in the course 
of many years from the (luarries of oiu^'s own field, l)ut it is (Miually 
true that this sentiment rests on suppositions l)ased on anything but 
facts. A migrating idcni, in the purely ideal sphere at least, could 
remain the same only under the assumption of perfect identity of 
national characteristics and entire suspension of development. This 
not being the case, the variation of the contents of an idea among dif- 
ferent peoples is no proof against its modification from without. Nor 
is it necessary to refute the strange yet conunon view thiit the })ossi- 
))ility of the construction of an internal development makes the 
assumption of external intiuences unnecessary.''' 

In the religious field the victorious course of Christianity from East 
to West is not an isolated phenomenon. Not onl}' did tiie Mithra 
cult pursue a similar course, but we continually see religious ideas 
from the Orient penetrating Occidental culture spheres. It is not 
difficult to trace to the influence of the old Persian Dualism'' the

•^'I was led to these views especially b}' the comparative study oi Persian and 
Arabic poets. Notice, for instance, the frequency of the epithet 'pcik (clean) in con- 
nection with the name of Allah in Persion poetry and search for Arabic parallels. 
Many Persian conceptions liave survived in Mohanmiedan writings; thus the later 
Turkish Kyrk sual point to contact with middle Persian sources. On the other 
hand, old Persian concejitions were later forced into the Koran hy conneciling them 
with such words as sidra (Sure 53, 14, 16), kauthar (108), sirut (37, 23), sfdiira 
(79, 14).

antitheses between God and the devil, between this world and the 
other world, l)etween clean and unclean, which were l)ut g-radually 
adopted into the monotheistic religions. Old Persian ideas, especially 
those pertaining- to iinal things, as death, the judgment, and events 
connected therewith, pervade Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, and 
through the medium of the former reached even the heathen Ice- 
landers, so that we again meet their ideas point for point in 
the Edda. We need only think of the world -tree (the tuija of 
the Mohammedans = Yggdrasil), the well containing the miracle- 
working water at its foot (called al-Kauthar, often only al-haud, 
"the cistern" = Urd;s well), the bridge of heaven (Avestan chinvat, 
Ara))ic as-sirat, old Norse Bifrost), but particularly the Dusk of the 
gods, w^hich agrees in all points with the last judgment as described by 
Moslem theologians. Here we have the blowing of the horn, known 
from the Koran, which in the Edda is performed l)y Heimdall, and 
the wdde plain (ai'sat al-arasat, or sahra-i-mehscher=Wigrid); the 
"beast of the earth," which is to come out from a rock lis.sure near 
Mecca, corresponds to Feni-is, and Daggal to the Antichrist and Loki. 
I could enumerate a long- list of such parallels." For some of their 
ideas the Persians may have received the first suggestions from the 
l^alndonians, though it is at present the fashion to overestimate the 
Ba])ylonian influences.^' The world view of the Babylonians still sur- 
vives in our seven da3's' week; in fact, onlj" through this world v'ww 
can the astrology of previous centuries be rightly understood. 1 have 
already called attention to it in ni}' initial pul)lication (1S8T). AVinck- 
ler'' has explained the symbolical numl)er seven and the unlucky luim- 
ber thirteen from Babylonian conceptions. The latter have to the 
present day exercised a mighty influence upon our economic life, and 
thus on human culture in general, through the fact that for the ratio 
of silver to gold the old norm from the mint regulation of Darius 
remained in force till the fall of silver. Winckler'' has shown that this 
relation represents the time of revolution of the planets correspond- 
ing to the two metals, the moon and sun; that is, 27:360 (=1:13^), 

« Of the literature bearing on this subject maybe mentioned: Kohut, Ueber die 
ji'idische Angelogie und Diimonologie in ihrer Abhiingigkeit vom Parsismus in 
A))handlungen der Deutschen Morgenliindischen Gesellschaft 4, LS66, and Was hat 
die lahimdisehe lOscliatologie aus dem Parsismus aufgenonnnen? in Zeitschrift der 
Deutsdien ^Morgenliindischen Gesellscliaft 21, 1867; Ernst Boklen, Die Verwantschaft 
der jiidisch-christlichen mit der persischen Eschatologie, Goettingen, 1902. Com- 
pare also Elard Hugo Meyer, Voluspa, Berlin, 1899. 

''So, for instance, Hugo Winckler, Die babylonische Kultur in ihren Beziehungen 
zur unsrigen (Leipzig, 1902), goes too far when he (p. 22) derives our clock face from 
the F>abylonian double hour. The division in twelve hours rather goes back to the 
sun clock and is to be explained from the fact that the sun does not shine during the 
night. So also our bock beer (p. 43) has nothing to do with the signs of the Zodiac, 
but is due to corruption by popular etymology of Eimbecker Bier.

times prevail against the tradition. 

But we can trace the connecting threads still further hack. The 
Buddha legend as "•Barlaam and flosaphaf' was during the Middle 
Ages a book of edification to Christians, -Tews, and Mohannn(Hlans,and 
at present the Hindu world \ie\v is ])eginning to play a role in the 
Occident through the medium of Schopenhauer" and the preaching 
of Buddhism by the theosophical societies.'' 

The literature which occupied our youthful minds, and influenced 
perhaps more than we are aware the development of our taste, orig- 
inated to a great extent in the Orient, not only the Biblical narra- 
tives and the stories of the Thousand and One Nights, but also 
many of the tales which tlie uninitiated considers of German origin.'' 
German lyric poetry, whose creations form an important part of the 
literar}" wealth of the people, was during the period of the flour- 
ishing of the church hymn })redominantly uiuler the inliuence of the 
Hebrew Psalter. And in the niiu'teenth century Hafiz, less through 
Goethe's West-Ostliclien Diwan than through liodenstedt's Mirza 
Schafl'y, which was printed in more than a hundred editions, exer- 
cised an influence upon our lo\e |)()etry which can not ])v over-estimated. 
The magic-lantei-n theater (ombres chinoise), esjiecially culti\'ate(l l)y 
the Romanticists magic-lantern plays were written, among others, 
by Justinus K(>rner. and an after])lay to it by Uhland, Ohr. Bientano, 
Achim ^ on .Vrnim, Count Pocci — came from Italy to Germany in the 
seventeenth century, l)ut was already flourishing in Egypt in Saladin's 
time and can be followed uji till the eleventh century in east Asia.'' 
Goethe borrowed the ideas for the prologue of his Eaust fi-om the old 
Hindu theater and the Book of »lob.

of the antique is soniethino- which does not occur in nature, and 
a violent crossing of it and the flat roof arc una?sthetic in the 
highest degree. The grand development of (lothic architecture is 
due to the man}" methods of overarching the columns which made 
the pointed arch possible. Now where does this element, which 
enabled oui' great masters to produce their wonderful creations, 
tirst appear as an artistic means of architecture? In the Mosque 
of Ibn Tulun, at Cairo, which was erected between 876 and 878; 
))ut })robably even earlier in the Miqyas (Nilometer), on the Nile 
island Roda." In art industry our dependence is still more appar- 
ent. With all our technical aids we are still far from attaining the 
noblest productions of the oriental textile industry. This is brought 
home to us, with regard to the Middle Ages, by the raiment of 
old (irerman emperors bearing Arabic inscriptions, and with regard 
to the present time by examining the colors of genuine carpets, 
or the gloss of genuine Brussa silks. And as in textile industr}' 
China gave us silk, so also in ceramics that country taught us to pro- 
duce the tinest material — porcelain. Rut the influence of oriental art 
industry reaches far beyond the mere production of material. Every 
connoisseur of our modern decorative art knows that it owes most 
of its suggestions to Japan. "At the Paris exposition,'' the expert, 
Ad. Fischer, says, ''everyone familiar with Japan could have con- 
vinced himself that the artists of the various countries often adopted 
the ideas of some Japanese artist. Thus, for instance, the porcelain 
factory of lioezendael appropriated the glorious flower and bird 
sketches of Schigemasa." Fortunately, we have learned at last to give 
the Eastern patterns a Western surrounding, but one familiar with 
flapanese art will frequently discern the exotic master even in the 
creations of modern naturalism, which again lovingly studies our own 
flora and fauna, for which the classicists lacked perception, so that we 
ari' justified in asking whether this whole tendency, wdiich api)eals 
to us as something native, does not after all owe its development to 
the intelligent study of a foreign culture.'' One who saw tiie plates 
of the elegant Vienna edition of Schmoranz, Altorientalische (Jlas- 
gefilsse, which appeared in 1898 (e. g., XXIX), will re( ognizc^ that 
also this branch of our modern art industry has, in its noblest crea- 
tions, copied the Orient with greater luck than the antique. This 
opens wider vistas concerning the influence of the Orient through 
art industry. Thus Wilhelm Bode'' points out how Venice, which 
in tlie fifteenth century reveled in the glory of Oriental carpets, 
matui-ed the grandest school of colorists in painting, and indeed the

tulip, the imperial lily, and the lihic, transmitted to us by the tlower- 
loving Turks, to whom we probably also owe the horse chestiuit. The 
eggs of the hen, a fowl originally from India,'" and the spices and 
other prodiicts of the Tropics have become indispensable necessities for 
our kitchen. Even tiie old (Tcrman millet-pa}) had to give way to the 
Arabic coHee. Nay, even our idle pastimes bear the stamp of .Moslem 
custom, for we owe the games of chess, checkers, and playing cards'' 
to the Moluunmedans. 

But let us turn our attention from these small m.atters to more impor- 
tant eleuients. The idea of phonetic writing, as is well known, had 
only one source. All the Indo-Oermanic alphabets have a conuuon 
origin in the North Semitic (PlKcnician or, more correctly, the 
Canaauitish-Aramean). That also the South Arabic characters are 
but secondary forms of it was pr<)\"en by Lidz])arskil,' notwithstand-

consists the culturiil value of phonetic or letter writing? It is not, as 
many assume, in facilitating the reading, for psychophysics has experi- 
mentally established the fact that we, no less than the Chinese, read 
not letters but wordy. Moreover, anyone can easily convince himself 
of this by the inaliility to at once read fluently a .sentence in an entirely 
foreign language." 

The circumstance that we read words explains the tendency to revert 
to ideographic writing which we can observe in all cursives and espe- 
cially in the name chiti're whose dissolution into their letter constitu- 
ents must be foregone. This is the only excuse for the mischief called 
orthography, which greatly nullities the use of the invention by com- 
pelling us to express the same sound through diti'ercMit signs, as in 
German v and f and ditierent sounds through the same sign, etc. Still, 
even in English, wdiere a ditierent vowel from the one meant is fre- 
quently written, letter witing has considerably simplitied and fac-ili- 
tated the acquisition of reading, and that means the spread of culture. 
Its effect also reaches beyond the limits of nationality and age, and, 
finallv, only through it could printing with movtil)li^ type have become 
eti'ective. To be sure, our writing is phonetically still far from perfect. 
The forms should in the tirst place indicate the articulation, and similar 
processes, such as modulation and aspiration, should he ex|)ressed h}^ 
the formation of the letters themselves; further development of the 
sounds is conceivable which would render the writing simpler and 
more practical. 

The invention of the letter alph:il)et which we owe to the practical 
sense of the Semites, and which was not essentially modified through 
the Classical and Christian Germanic culture periods, is such an 
important achievement that its historical aspect is worth consid- 
eration. To the spread of the Semitic alphal)et in the regions 
known as its home, the find of Tell-el-Amarna furnishes the furthest 
limit in time, for as it proves that cuneiform writing was then in 
such exclusi\'e use in Canaan that even the Canaanitish glosses 
are expressed in this cumbersome script, a Semitic consonantal writ- 
ing could hardly have existed there prior to 1400 B. C. ^' The iloso 
relationship between the writing of the Moabite Stone (840 B. C.) and 
the old-Aramean monuments of Senjirili (eighth century B. C.) seems 
to establish a conmion origin which we can not well push back Ijeyond 
the eleventh century B. C. I see, therefore, no cogent chronological 
arguments against the recentlj' asserted hypothesis of the innnigration 

«The Greek avcxyiyvcodKEiv (properly, to recognize again) expresses, therefore, 
more correctly the process than the Latin " legere" and the German " lesen," which 
represent only the elementary phase of reading if legere suggests the collecting of 
the single letters and dvayiyvchdKEiv the recognizing of whole words.

Orient much older systems of writing, besides it is far from settled 
that the ([uestion is here of a purely letter alphabet. The Aery num- 
ber !t8 of the })ictoiira[)hs discussed ])y Evans is against this assump- 
tion. II. Kluge,"'who reads them as Greek clraracters, had to employ 
arbitrary identifications of different signs in order to reduce their 
niuiiber. Of the many improbabilities of this attempt at decipher- 
ment may be mentioned tho assumption that the original vowels 
became Semitic lai'ynga! signs, while the opposite de\('lo[)ment appears 
as the only natural one. Furthermore, according to the original 
forms assumed by him for the Cretan lineal signs, they should have 
something" in conunon with the later Greek writing in contrast to the 
Canaanitish, but on the contrary the dependence of the (ireek forms 
on the Canaanitish has been proven with great acumen by Lidzbarski. 
The testimony of the ancients themselves that the letters of Cadnuis 
went back to an Oriental hero would have little weight if it had not a 
strong support in the unmistakably Semitic names of the Greek 
characters. 

In the Middle Ages another scarcelv less grand achievement of the 
human mind w^as transmitted by the Saracenes to the Occident — the 
Arabic system of numerals. To estimate the importance of reducing 
to a consistent system the position value of the signs which rest on the 
invention of the Zero, we must recall the utter impossibility of calcu- 
lating a logarithmic table with Greek or Roman numerals, and the 
absolute necessity of this auxiliary for all modern mathematical 
sciences. Even the simplest arithmetical operations, as dixision, could 
not possibly be carried on with the antique mmierals, and it rec[uires, 
indeed, a kind of fanaticism to prefer, even at present, on title pages 
such modes of writing as CIOIOCCCLXXXVIII, etc., instead of 1888. 

The form of the Ara])ic ciphers exhibit in many directions remark- 
able relations. There was, of course, many attempts to refer them to 
an Occidental origin, but these attempts are to ]>e taken still less seri- 
ously than those concerning letter script. The graphic e\olution of 
the Arabic numerals from the Roman, defended with much skill by

Arabic miinorals reseniUU^ ours as well as thoso of India, l)ecaiise 
they have more faithfully ])reserve(l the old Arabic forms. The his- 
tory of writing otl'ei-s ifi this respect a paralUd, since the ]\Iaghrib 
alphabet stands in many respects nuich nearer th(^ Gutic than does 
the Neskhi. The ciphers of a Shiraz maiuiscript of tlu^ tenth cen- 
tury" shows the transition of the older Islamic forms into those at 
present in use in th(^ East. 

In earlier times the zero was n^presented by a point; the circular 
form is secondary. R. Iloei-ide'' l)elieyes he recoo-nizes the beginnino- 
of this sio-n in India in the fragments of an Indian arithmetic recently 
discovered, wliicii he would ascribe to the third or fourth c(Mitury A. D., 
and in which the point is also still employed for the unknown cpian- 
tity. If it must be admitted that there is no inscriptional evidence 
for the zero before the eighth century, still theiv ar(> indications of its 
existence in India even in previous centuries. 1 also Ixdieve that there 
is anoth(M- <eries of pluMiomena connected with th(^ history of the

uiuhn- this aspect. The (xreek philologians used at first to mark pas- 
sages which they considcn'ed as not genuine l)y a horizontal line called 
ofteXog. In the Ihwapla of Origen the o/ifAo? appears in various 
forms without any addition, as hypolemniscus with a point under- 
neath, as lenuiiscus with two points, one above and the other underneath 
the line. As these signs are used promiscuously, thos(> provided with 
points ])rol)ably did not originate with Origen himself, but represent 
jittempts at explanation l)y the scril)es. The coiuiection between the 
()))elos points and tlie canceling point, which writers of different lan- 
guages of the Orient and Occident place oyer letters which we would 
erase, is evident. In Latin this process was already in the fifth cen- 
tury in vogue.'' As regards (ireek."' Syriac, Armenian, I can only assert 
the fact without being a})le to tix the date of its beginning. In the 
Hebrew Old Testament, too, our texts mark every lettcn- to l)e can- 
celed by a point over it (compare, for instance, (ienesis xvi, a), and if 
an entire word should not be read the point is repeated over every 
letter of it (compare, for instance, (Tcnesis xxxiii, 4). In Psalm 
xxvii. 3, is even found a mark corresponding to th(^ lenuiiscus; that is, 
points a))ove and under every letter. The mentionmg of these points

system which the Tahnud does not yet know. The circle (circellus) is 
met with in the Old Testament canon when the reading- of the text is 
supplanted by a Masoretic marg-inal correction, whicli appears in our 
editions as a footnote. A small circle with neoating force is also 
known to the Arabic popular script which arose in the period of the 
Omeyads. The well-known Aral)ic sign of vowellessness, calh^d sukun 
or jezma, is perhaps not an unimportant connecting link in the histor}' 
of the zero. It differs, it is true, from the other cases in so far that 
it negates the vowel, not the consonant, but Noldeke, in his Geschichte 
des Qorans, page 316, has also adduced an instance of the latter; in the 
Cuhc codex, Wetzstein, n. s., No. 5, a yellow zero appears as a can- 
celing mark of a consonant." In addition to the paleographical wit- 
nesses come also historical ones. 

In a poem composed by a Bedouin during an expedition to Cyprus 
under the Calif Al-Walid Ibn Yazid (12.5-2(3 A. H.=743 A. D.)V the 
author deprecated the sea voyage, which he would gladly exchange for 
a camel's ride, resigning wages and heavenly reward to others — if he 
had but firm land lieneath his feet, he would at once desert: " Veril}"," 
he exclaims, "my name at the roll call will receive a circle.''' Positive 
evidence for the existence of the zero sign in the Occident and its Latin 
name cifra can be shown onl\" since the twelfth century.' In the six- 
teenth century a division of meaning takes place so that the word in 
the form of " Zero" preserved the old signification of null (zero), 
while in that of " chift're," cipher, it was used for any numeral. ' ^^'hile 
I readily agree with Krumbacher that the word sipos, which twice 
made its appearance in the Occident, can onh^ be ij'i/qjo?; (psephos) 
I know of no phonetic Arabic parallel to the derivation of sifr from 
tptfq)o{^qjo)picx (pscphophoria). 8ifr occurs in the meaning of '•empty," 
even in pre-Islamic time.'' We shall therefore have to accept the old 
explanation-' that Arabic sifr in the meaning of zero is a translation of 
the corresponding Indian sui^ya.'' As in the case of the sign for no vakie, 
so also from the Orient comes the sign for the unknown valu(\ Here,

tlio antique culture !?phero, and each theory had adherents. Thus, 
according to Prouhetj-wjioiii C. Henry still praises" for his "inoe- 
nious" idea, we must believe that our X was the Roman sign for 1,000, 
viz, oo( = CIO), for one says: "He eats for 4," etc. One would 
expect that mathematicians, and especially arithmeticians, would ])e a 
little more precise in handling numbers and not write 1,000 for any 
other number. Lagarde, as is well known, has proven'^ that the X of 
the mathematicians is an ab])reviation of the Arabic word shei, '^a 
thing," "something.''' which as early as the eleventh century was used 
to designate the uidciiown, and wliich in the then prevailing Western 
transcription was rendered by xei and still appears in this form in 
Pedro de Alcala. 

We have thus seen that two of the most important foundations of 
our culture, the alphabet and the ciphers, were gifts of the East. In 
order to obtain a more definite judgment of the share of the Orient 
and Occident in civilizing humanity, let us now turn to those discov- 
eries and iiuentions which have contributed most to the mighty mental 
progress of the last centuries. 

We begin to outgrow the ideals of so-called Humanism. Our age 
is in transition from classicism to universalism. Mental achievements 
are never formed ivoni cloud mists, but need a concrete l)asis. The 
broad foundation of our modern world view is the result of familiarit}" 
with the spirit of foreign civilizations, and these could enter into our 
horizon only after the invention of the compass, which made naviga- 
tion on the ocean possible. The magnet needle was known to the 
Chinese even in the ])egimiing of Ihe second century A. D., the most 
important evidence of this fact being given in Klaproth's famous let- 
ter to Alexander von Humboldt. Sur Tinvention de la bussole,'' Ibn 
'"Adhari quotes an Arabic verse of 85-1 A. D., in which the qaramit 
( = calamita) is mentioned in a connection which would imply its refer- 
ring to the ship's compass.'' 

The work of civilization needs periods of peace. These we owe to 
the improvement of our military ati'airs, which have made war more 
terrible, but also less frecpient. This, again, was made possible only

by the invention of g-unpowder, which gave to the intellectual element 
the sole mastery in warfare. The a priori conviction of many that 
only the Greeks or Romans could have invented gunpowder led to a 
dire confusion in this question. Combustibles like naphtha, etc., to 
which class also Greek fire belongs, were in use in the armies of the 
Califs" and were confounded with explosives. Marcus Graecus, who 
had a receipt for making gunpowder from saltpeter, coal, and sulphur, 
being credited to the ninth century, while he actually wrote al)out 1250, 
and this under Arabic influence. The monk Berthold Schwarz is 
naturall}" a counterpart to the pretended inventor of the compass, 
Flavio Gioja, the historical facts about both l)eing in doubt. In any 
case, their lives are placed in a time when the inventions which the}" 
are said to have made had long been known. Those who would recon- 
cile this discrepancy try to reserve for these men some improvement 
which they might have applied, but as a rule with little success. 
A critical sifting- of the evidence begins only with liomocki's excel- 
lent history of explosives, ^^ followed by a summarizing lecture by 
Dr. Ednuind O. von Lippmann at Halle.'' Both specialists arrived at 
the same conclusion, that saltpeter was first known in China, but not 
before about the middle of the twelfth century. We have old Chinese 
accounts of the brave and successful defense of the Chinese cit}" of 
Pian-king (K'ai-fuug) on the Lower Hwang--ho against the Mongols 
under Ogotai in 1232.'^ Here we first find explosives, blasting bodies, 
and rockets employed 1)}^ the Chinese against the enem}". Of their 
form we get an idea from the cuts in Chinese fire books. In the 
thirteenth century the Arabs became acquainted with saltpeter, 
through China, for they designate it as thelg as-Sin (Chinese snow), 
and the rockets as sahm Khatai (Chinese arrow). In the fire book of 
Hasan ar-Ranuuah (Paris National Library, de Slane's catalogue No. 
2825 fi\), which originated l)etween 1275 and 1295, saltpeter already 
forms the 'Mjasis of fireworks'' (Komocki). The same Hasan ar- 
Rammah for the first time describes a torpedo as ])aida takhrug wa-tah- 
ru(( (an egg which comes forth burning) with a cut in one of the Paris 
manuscripts, reproduced ])y Romocki,p. 71.'

glory. In tln^ first i)lace, as regards the fundamental idea of printing, 
it can hardly be called a feat of genius, for thi' idea already existed in 
the use of ancient seal signs and mint stamps. The Babylonians 
who, as is well known, used clay as writing material, knew a method 
of multiplying texts analogous to ])ook printing. We have old 
oriental seal cylindei's" covered with longer or shortei- texts that were 
impressed in soft clay as the cylinders rollefl o\(>r it. Writing mate- 
rials of classical anticpiity were too costly to make the general appli- 
cation of this process feasible. The art died out until East Asia 
soh'ed the problem of material in a way Ixd'ore unsurpass(^d. As 
recently as 1ST5 \Vatteid)ach, in the second edition of his Schrift- 
wesen im Mittelalter (p. 114), said: ''Paper '■ ■• " wraps its 
origin in thick darkness which will pro])al)ly never l)e dissipated.''' 
How strangeh" this sentence now reads since the history of pa})er has 
come to be perhaps more unfolded to us than the history of any other 
anci(Mit invention. We owe this progress abo\e all to the fortunate 
circumstance that the greater })art of the papyrus tind in the Fayum 
came into the hands of investigators at Vienna who undtn'stood it well 
enough to make a scientific use of it, while thi^ pai't which sti'ayed to 
Berlin has contributed nothing to the numerous iind surprising results 
gained in Vienna. 

Ancient civilized nations at lirst used for wi'iting matei-ials what 
nature produced in a condition already suited to tiiat purpose. So 
the Chinese formerly em\)loyed bamboo, as we can infer from the 
composition of some of th(^ charactcn's of tluMr indeographic wi'itings,^ 
The employment of color contrast must also be considered as a step 
forward, for at tirst the signs were merely scratched, as was the cus- 
t<Mn of our ancestors. I surmise that the invention of the pit (or

of a softer writing material which, according to Chinese accounts 
found in Hirth, was, even in pre-Christian time, made from silk scraps. 
About 100 A. D. Ts ai Lun, the director of the imperial manufactor}^ 
of arms, made his immortal invention. Finding silk too expensive and 
})and)()o unhand}', he devised a new writing material and manufac- 
tured paper out of bark, hemp, rags, and tish nets. It is well known 
that paper can })e obtained from various plant fibers by freeing them 
from foreign su))stances, vigorously stirring when in a moist condition 
and drying in thin layers. The older processes show a similarity to the 
manufacture of felt, except that felt is made from raw animal mate- 
rials while the paper industry uses vegetable fiber. As felt manu- 
facture was particularly at home among the East-Turkish nomads, it 
may be supposed that the suggestion for the preparation of paper 
came from them to China, the more so as we first of all hear of raw 
animal materials (silk scraps). The most important source on Ts'ai 
Lun is his biography in the annals of the later Han, which treats of 
the period of 25-220 A. D. The great importance of the new inven- 
tion was already recognized in his lifetime, and succeeding years did 
not forget his merit. In 105 A. D. Ts'ai Lun was officially praised 
by a cabinet order, and his house and the stone on which he stamped 
his paper were for many centuries considered as celebrated sights. 

To the Vienna orientalist, Hammer-Purgstall, belongs the merit of 
having first brouglit to light from Islamic sources the important 
account of the spread of Chinese paper by way of Samarkand to the 
West;'' the precise date was established by Karabacek.^ The most 
important source, Tha'tilibrs Lataif al-ma'arif,'' relates of the paper 
industry of Samarkand, which superseded papyrus and parchment, 
that it was transplanted thither by Chinese prisoners of war, captured 
by Zivad, son of Salih. There is a parallel account in Qa/wnifs 
Athar al-bilad.'' Karabacek^s somewhat free translation seems to me 
to have nuich obscured the meaning of the ittakhadha. 1 should ren- 
der the ([notation from Qazwini: "The author of Kingdoms and 
Traveling-routes relates that prisoners of war from China were trans- 
planted to Samarkand, among Avhom were some who understood the 
manufacture of paper and choose it,-' etc. The refercMice here is evi-

clcntly to the Mukatftba, or right of t^laves to buy thv'iv liberty, for as 
intidel prisoners of Avar were by Ishmiie law retained as serfs until 
they could accumulate the necessary ransom, the}" had to be uiven an 
opportunity for carrying- on a trade. In the present case some of the 
Chinese paper makers chose the paper industry. The enterprise was 
successful and became a ptu-manent accjuisition for Samarkand. Ziyad 
Ibn Salih is therefore not to be considered a genius in economics who 
wished to turn the skill of the foreignei's into the service of his own 
state. From both Aral)ic and Chinese sources, which agree ev^en as 
regards the month, we learn that Ziyad gained a great victor}- over 
the Turkish princes, who were waging war against each other, and the 
auxiliaries sent by tlu^ Chinese Emperor under the conmiand of the 
Korean Kao Hsien-fa in fluly of 751, Only on this occasion could 
those prisoners of war have come to Samarkand. 

The Barmecide Al Fadl Ibn Yahya, brothei'of thegrtmd \'izier (la far 
who is known from the Thousand and One Nights, had as governor of 
Khurasrui opportunities to become acquainted with the Samarkand 
paper and transplanted this industry, as is related by Ibn Khaldiln 
under the reign of Harun-ar-Rashid, between TH4 and TDS to Baghdad. 
By this step the Barmecide accjuired great praise for himself, the city 
of the Califs having taken the lead in paper manufactories that spread 
into all Islamic countries, as far as Spain. The Museum Erzher/og 
Rainer possesses two Arabic letters on rag paper (Nos. HIT and i»lS) of 
about S(K) A. D., which are prol)al)ly two specimens of the Bagdad 
paper factory a few }'ears after its establishment. Tlu> excaxations of 
M. A. Stein in Chinese Turkestan may have l)rought to light still older 
paper samples." By a chronological sifting of the Fayum documents, 
the gradual use of paper in place of papyrus can be distinctly fol- 
lowed, and in the middle of the tenth century the latter is entirely 
superseded. At the beginning of the eleventh century we tirst meet 
in th(^ Fustat l)azar with packing paper'' in i)lace of the coarse pap}rus 
of which IM.in}', xiii, 23, says: Nam emporica inutilis sc.ril)endo invo- 
lucris chartarum segestriumque mercibus usum pru'lx^t, ideo a merca-

Still, according to the data given l)y him, it seems that paper produc- 
tion came from the Arabs to Southern Europe in the twelfth centur}^ 
and in the fourteenth to Germany (p. 145). How tlioroiighly the 
invention, the history of which we have just sketched, now pervades 
all our relations in life is shown among- other things by the cognomen 
of "paper age" given to our time. Borrowings of civilization have 
also their traces in the language. And indeed our paper measures, 
"quire'' and "ream," go l)ack to old- Aral)ic time. "ReanrMs the 
Arabic rezma, '•package," which passed into Spanish as resma, into 
Italian as risma, into German as ries, into French as rame. For 
"quire'' the French say "main de papier," the Russian "dyest 
bumagi." Dest is the Persian word for hand and in Arabic also 
denotes a pan'' and a measure.'' On the other hand, for tlie miaterial 
itself the languages of the Occident did not receive a new word l)ut 
transferred the Egyptian designation of the older writing material 
to the new descendant which in connnon with the former is of vege- 
table nature, just as the name " pen" was inherited l)y the more perfect 
steel writing instrument. 

Like the art of paper making, so also that of printing wandered from 
the Orient to the Occident in the form of faliric printing (Zengdruck). 
Nol)ody has thus far made a study of this industr\' in China; in fact, 
there is a general dearth of w^orkers in the field of sinology. It is 
well known of the Dayaks of Borneo that they first cut the designs of 
their tattooings in wood, then, with the aid of a pigment, impressed 
it on the skin and performed the operation after tliis pattern. '' We 
possess Egyptian fabric prints of the sixth century. What is perhai)s 
the oldest samphi comes, it is true, from the tomb of St. Ca?sarius at 
Aries, but is very prol)abl}^ of Egyptian origin' and is preserved in 
the Germanic Museum at Nuremberg. •' This same institution possesses 
a valuable collection of fabric prints of the sixth and seventh centuries, 
which Dr. Forrer, of Strasburg, excavated at Ikhmim, in Upper 
Egypt; also two fabric print models from the same place. A shred 
reproduced by Forrer--' seems to represent the l)eginnings of the art 
in the Occident and dates, according to him, from the Carolingian

Printing" on paper arost> in'C'hina as a consequence of pa})er iii\en- 
tion. As early as 175 A. I), the text of theChin(\se classics was })osted 
on tlie out(M' walls of the uni\'ersity and ini})ressi()ns were taken of it. 
At the end of the sixth century ])rintini4- was cari'ied on in C'hina with 
wooden plates, for at that time the iXMunaiits of the classical books 
were cut in wood l)y order of the founder of the Sui dynasty.''' At 
an early period the Chinese invention niig-rated to dapan. On the 
beginnino's of dtipan(\se pi'inting Satow gi\'es a thorough study. We 
learn from it that in 7M the flapanese Empress Slio-toku ordered a 
million of small wooden pagodas, each containing an imprint of a })as- 
sage from the l)uddhist book A'imahi nirbhasa Sutra, to be distributed 
among the lUiddhist temples and monasteries. The carrying out of 
this connuand was brought to an end in TTo. A iuunl)t'r of these 
pag'odas ha\e been r(»discovered in the lloryu monastery at Vamato. 
They contain on long rolled-up strij)s Sanskrit texts, but in Chinese 
characters. Facsimiles so far exist only in Japanese works.' Wo 
also possess metal printing plates of the year SK;, with Chinese signs 
in relief.'' Mirth found a book oii'ered for sale in China wdiich was 
printed from plates in 1054 A. D.. containing })oems by a poet of 
the Sung dynasty, with a portrait of the author in woodcut.' For 
the succeeding centuries information on book printing in Fast Asia 
becomes more and more abundant. 

Although the geographer Kitter pointed out the anticiuity of the 
art of l)()ok })rinting in the monasteries of the Lamas,' no headwa\', it 
seems, has been made in lixing the dates of the old Tibetan prints, as 
the persons mentioned in them as the i)rinters or })atronsare otherwise

Mongolia and there l)ecame priest of the ruler mentioned above. " He

of Chinese blacking. Tlie Lama rejoiced over it. Bloghsal of dRus 
and others printed with the plates thus sent the bKa-'gyur and the 
bsTan- gyur at T'ugs-k u and reconnnended the placing of these copies 
in the Manyughosha temple at sNar-t'an._ After that the copies of the 
Kagyur and Tan-gyur ])ecame very abundant." 

Of the further spread of i)rinting in the Occident notiiing was known 
until a few years ago. On the other hand, it was well known that the 
Islamic Orient for a long time opposed the introduction of the printing 
press. Their opposition was founded on the apprehension — not offi- 
cially acknowledged — that the hogs' l)ristles, which the Mohanmiedans 
always suspect in the brushes used for the cleaning of the types, might 
touch in the type the name of Allah. Even at present the Koran is 
not being printed in the Orient, and lithography is generally given 
the preference, and the Moslem prints ])v reason of the imperfect clean- 
ing of the types are much inferior to those of the flesuits in Beyrout. 
In Constantinople a printing establishment came in existence only in 
1727 in ct)nsequence of a hatt-i-sherif of the Sultan Ahmed III." The 
accounts of the Euclid in Arabic, supposed to have l)een printed in the 
sixteenth century at Constantinople,'^ rests, as I have been a])le to ascer- 
tain in the library of the Deutsche Morgenlandische (Jesellschaft, on 
an erroneous interpretation of the statements on the last leaf of ;i folio 
edition at Rome in 1594. 

Great, therefore, was the surprise when the Fayum iind brought to 
light thirty Ara])ic plate prints from Egypt belonging to the tenth 
Christian century, two of them perhaps even to the ninth c(Mitury.*' In 
the excellent Fiihrer durch die Ausstellung (guide to th(^ exhibit) 
Karabacek d(Hdar(\s, page 247, that "they are, as regards the cut of the 
forms and the process of printing, perfectly identical with the Chinese.'' 
But I must contradict him wlum he goes on to say, "Thus our col- 
lection preserves the oldest prints in the world so far known," for, as 
I have shown above, older Japanese prints were th(Mi known. The

white on black; No. 0^0 is printed in red. In one case (No. U-il) tiiere 
are Coptic characters in addition to the Aral)ic. Thev are without 
anv vahie as regards their contents. A y)rinte(l ])iece of the Koran, 
reproduced by Karabacek in the Fiihrer, page i^4s. shows that the 
Mohammedans were not then pi-i'judiced in this respect. 

The historical continuity of printing can not be Droxcn with the 
same certainty as that of the use; of paper. Still, to show that the 
knowledge of printing on ])aper remained alive in tiie Orient, tiic fol- 
lowing witnesses can b(> achhtced. According to Karabacek, who 
refers to Abu Shama's Kitab ar-raudatain," tlie compulsory bank 
notes, each of one dinar, issued in 1147 in north(M-n S_\ria, were pro- 
duced 1)V plate })rinting. and in the i)aper money printing laireau 
established in 12'.t;; A. D. at Tebriz the woi'k was carried on after 
Chinese patterns.'' Furthermore, the Persian historian Kaslud-ed-din 
(died 1318 A. D.) gives a description of the Chinese piocess of print- 
ing.' We learn from this description the interesting fact that at that 
time editions of a certain number of copies were not jjrinted, but the 
i:)lates were kept unchu- lock in the libraries. Anyone who wished to 
buy a book went thither and had an impression made. The cultural 
value of the edition should not be underestimated. Thus, for instance, 
the importance of book printing for the Reformation would have been 
much impaired by the old Chinese process of nudtiplylng. 

As long as paper had to be imported into the Occident it could not 
be cheap, because of limited means of communication in the ^liddlo 
Ages. From Wattenbach'' we learn that in G(>i"many. at least, the use 
of paper became more general only after the fourteenth century. 
After paper production was established in the OccidiMit we ol)serve 
here, as among the Chinese and the Arabs, that printing followed in 
its train.' 

The step from printing from })lates to that with movable types was, 
wnth our phonetic system of only two dozen signs, still less a feat of 
genius than the invention of the printing process at large. In the 
Wegweisser durch das Germanische Museum, Nuremb(M-g, 1I»01, page

have found proofs that the Ronians of the hiter periods of the Empire 
were acquainted with the art of printing with mdvable tj^pes, or that at 
least attempts in that direction were then made." I could lind no light 
on this paragraph which is apt to stir up the emotion of the visitors. 
The statement is made in such a timid manner that one suspects it 
could stand th(> test no better than the analogous assertions discussed 
above. But it is true that Gutenberg was not the first in the Occident 
to conceive the idea of printing Avith movable types, foi" initials, 
prefixed letters, seem to have been earh^ in use," and the Dominican, 
Conrad Forster, born at Ansbach, was emploj'ing movable types at 
Nuremberg ])etween 1437 and 1-157 in bindings, copies of Avhich are still 
extant at Leipzig, Nurembei'g, and Wiirzburg.* Chinese sources name 
as the inventor of printing with movable types of da}' the smith 
Pi-Shr)ng between 101:1 and 1019 A. D.' Though we have no positive 
indications of a migration of this art to the A^'est, still there recently 
came to light books in East Asia which had been printed with movable 
ty})es long before Gutenberg. The oklest east Asiatic print from types 
which Satow personallv examined dates from the pei'iod between 1317 
and 1321; whether it is of Korean origin or Chinese can not be decided 
with certainty.'' In a supplement to his study just referred to Satow 
describes Korean ])ooks printed from metal types, '^ which furnishes 
another proof for the priority of printing from types in East Asia. 
One of these, ])]'inted in 1409, contains, in an epilogue, an important 
contribution to the history of tj^pe printing, for in it tlie King of 
Korea relates how, having recognized the inadequac}" of printing from 
wood plates, he had for the presei'vation of literature ordered the 
manufacture of copper types at his personal expense and that of his 
court and not at the expense of his subjects. The memorable epilogue, 
which is dated between Deccm])er 11, 1403, and January 12, 1404, 
closes with prayers for the future prosperity of the luidertaking. 
Still, even tliis most important of all human inventions could not 
thrive in its own home, since the Chinese ideographic writing recjuired 
su(;h a large mass of type material that it almost outweighed the advan- 
tages of the innovation. Only through our Semitic phonetic alphabet 
could the idea become the factor in civilization that it now represents.

the g'reat AVorld-traiis't'oVniino- consequences of those achievements 
which we. without question, owe to the Orient, wc shall have to 
acknowledge that they form the presuppositions of a very important 
part of our mental life. Of course, our civilization is for all that 
no more oriental than anticiue. Each people lives its own life of cul- 
ture; oidy iujpulses come from the outside. To gain a right estimate 
of their importance* we must not allow ourselves to l)e misled by 
enthusiastic phrases, hut, standing on the solid ground of facts, 
investigate how far the effect of the impulses reach, particular!}^ 
whether they touch oidy a caste or the m;iss. While Hellenism did 
not reach the people — a Greek name in a ]x>pular song would at once 
characterize it as not genuine" — ])ut continues its existence chiefly 
within certain scholastic circles, the usefulness of the compass, apart 
from indirect wa^s, directly benctits the entire seafaring population, 
and the advantages of explosives are appreciated by exovy soldier, while 
writing and printing may be considered as the connnon pro})erty of 
all mankind. 

We do not cultivate the languages of the Orient because of the 
mighty influence of its people over the Occident in centuries past, but 
because we hope from these studies there maj^ come even greater 
beneflts in the future. As Humanism once meant a considerable 
widening of the mental horizon, so it means at present for our state 
of civilization an artiflcial nai'rowing, having crystalized into a cold 
classicism'' and, according to the well-known law of human de\elop- 
UKmt, resembling in many res})ects the old scholasticism which it once 
conquered. But we expect, analogous to the Humanists, that our 
science, after removal of certain external obstacles wliich of late have 
hindered its progress, will have the mission, in union with other 
sciences which are more and more being developed from decade to 
decade, to deliver mankind from a one-sided woi'ld view and to give 
it back the understanding for the beautiful in all its manifoldness. 

"Entirely erroneous is the theory propounded at present tliat popular poetry 
arises solely from the more or less learned class. Where is the art form of the 
<lra\ving-room from which, for instance, the popular ditties ("Schnaderhiipfei") 
could have developed? There is only so much truth in this theory that no hard and 
last lines can be drawn between both, and that they frequently influence one another, 
though the really good conu's more often from below tiian from above. 

'' Ttie enrichment tlinniLili subjective assimilation of foreign elements is the latest 
phase of development which is as yet in its beginning.

ronnded by dikes with water taken from the Nile River dnrino- time 
of Hood. These l)asins vary in size from less than 5 acres to over 
oO.iMio acres, and in a noi-mal flood year are tilled with water to an 
a\erao-e depth of 4 feet for a period of about six weeks, after which 
th(^ water is drained away and the seed sown in the newly (h^posited

ful of water and pcn-niits the oTOwth of but one crop per year.

has been planned. As earl}^ as the time of Mohammed Ali this plan 
was under consideration, but it was not until Mr. W. Willcocks was 
appointed director-general of reservoirs that the storage of water on 
the Nile was thoroughly considered. 

In 1S90 Mr. Willcocks presented a report on the subject to the 
Egyptian Government, in 1894 issued a second report, and in 1895 a 
final report, with plans and estimates. The central feature of this 
system of flood control provides for a dam across the Nile at the head 
of the lirst cataract, or 5 miles aboxe the town of Assufin. In 1898, a 
short time after Mr. Willcocks had left the service of the Egyptian 
Government, contracts were signed by Sir John Aird & Co. for the 
construction within five years of the Assuan dam, upon the plans pre- 
pared by Mr, Willcocks. Sir Benjamin Baker acted as consulting 
engineer, and Mr. Maurice Fitzmorris was appointed resident engineer. 

The dam as completed during the present sununer conforms almost 
throughout to the plans of Mr. Willcocks. His original plans pro- 
vided for the construction of a dam following the line of soundest 
rock across the stream, with 0<» undersluices having an area of 21,500 
square feet, or sufficient to carry oti' the maxinmm floods of the river. 
In the plan of 1891, 100 undersluices were provided of the same 
capacity. In the final design there are 140 undersluices, each 23 by Oi 
feet, and 40 at a higher level, Hi by Oi feet, giving a sluiceway of 
24,000 square feet. 

The question of the height of the dam involved a vexatious pro])lem; 
the island of Phihe, which lies just above the cataract, contains 
some of the l)est preserved tompU\s and buildings of ancient Egypt. 
Mr. Willcocks' plan of a dam, ^ 00 feet a})ove the zero of the Assutln 
gage, with a capacity of 85,000,000,000 cubic feet of water, would 
submerge these temples to a depth of 2G feet for a portion of each 
year. In his book upon the dam, Mr. Willcocks says: "The Inter- 
national Commis.sion held widely divergent views about Phihe temple. 
M. Boule refused to have anything to do with a project which in 
any way deranged the temple. Signor Torricelli said that \\v had 
been asked his opinion about the dam, and about the dam he would 
give his opinion, regardless of templets and antiquities, which were 
outside his province. Sir Benjamin liakcr proposed raising the whole 
temi)le. like a great Chicago hotel, cle:in above tlie high level of the 
resei'voir. Savants and antiquaries, and many who weie neither 
savants norantitpiaries, butto whoni IMiihe offered an easy opportunity 
of obtaining notoriety, all joined in the fray. Eventually, in a moment 
of great weakness, the Pvgyptian (Jovernment, buoyed up by a suc- 
cession of good summers, accepted the lowering of the level of the 
reservoir, so that only a part of Phihe temple should l)e drowned. 
The new reservoir level was to-be 26 feet below that hitherto proposed, 
and the capacity of the reservoir was to })e reduced from 85,000,000,000

to 35,000,000,000 cubic feet of water. Fortunately the conditions of 
stability- laid down by the Jnternational Connnission on the initiative 
of Si<inoi- Torricelii were so severe that I was able to design a dam 
nominally capable of lujlding* up 35,000,000,000 cubic feet of water, 
hut actually strong- enough to hold up 70,000,000, 000."' 

The dam i> located 5 miles stjuth of Assuan, or about 550 miles south 
of Cairo, at the head of the first cataract. At this point the Nile falls 
about 16 feet in 4 miles, the ))ed of the river ])eing granite rtjck. The 
fall is so sligiit that the cataract throug-h most of the year is practically 
no more than rapids. The Nile boats go down the rapids and are 
towed up at nearly all stages of the rivei". 

The dam is almost exactlv one and a (|uarter miles Irjng and has a 
maximum height above the foundation of 147 feet. The foundation 
was laid upon solid granite throughout. The rock was decomposed to 
a great depth; in some cases as nmch as 45 feet were remo\ed before 
solid rock was found. This large amount of excavation increased the 
actual cost of the work beyond the original estimate. No drill holes 
were made in the underlying rock l)efore the v.ork of construction 
was commenced, so that the information upon which the original esti- 
mate was made was not as complete as it might have been in this 
respect. The dam is :23 feet w^ide at the top and allows for a roadway 
13 feet wide, on which is laid a narrow-guage track. The rock is 
granite, quarried near by, and laid in Portland cement. It is said that 
♦jO0.<m»0 barrels of cement were used in this masonry — an order suffici- 
ently large to materially affect the market value of cement in England. 
It is interesting to note that although the volume of masonry is very 
large, yet it approximates only one-fourth of the cubic contents of the 
Great Pyramid near Cairo. 

The building of the dam was rendered especially difficult l)y the 
higli floods which annually come down the Nile. The normal difl'er- 
ence in level between high and low water at Assutin is 38 feet, and 
work could be carried on to advantage only during low Avatei'. 

To expose a portion of the river bed, dikes were ])uilt. and the por- 
tion of the bed thus laid bare was excavated to solid rock. The foun- 
dation was then built up to about normal flood level, and a new portion 
of the l)ed dried. In this manner the foundation was completed across 
the river, and later the superstiiicture was added to the desired height. 
As will be seen l)v the accompanying illustrations, there Avas a great 
deal of hand labor, as many as 12.000 workmen being employed at one 
time, about one-tenth of whom were skilled Italian masons. 

The sluices are arranged in tiers at three levels. Iron gates of the 
Stoney system, running on rollers in steel grooves, permit the closing 
or opening of all the sluices in a very few moments, the gates being 
suspended on steel wire cable and Sailing by their own weight. The 
winches are operated by hand. A few of the sluices are lined with 



534 THE NILE RESERVOIR DAM AT ASSUAN. 

iron, but the greater number are lined witli dressed granite blocks of 
large size. 

Around the western end of the dam a ship canal 32 feet wide, with 
four locks, has been completed. This canal added very materiall}' to 
the total cost of the dam. The gates in the canal are said to be con- 
structed on plans drawn for lock gates on the proposed Nicaraguan 
Canal. 

The sluice gates in the dam are opened during the tirst part of the 
flood season. In this time the muddiest part of the flood pu.sses 
through the dam. As the river commences to fall — and fortunately 
the water carries much less sediment at that time — the gates are 
gradually lowered. As the flood subsides, a portion of the water is 
thus held up, and when the season of low water arrives, with its con- 
sequent scarcity in the perennial canals lower down the river, the 
reservoir is full. Then the gates are slowly opened, and as the river 
continues to fall the reservoir supply is drawn upon and the flow 
downstream from the dam maintained sufficiently to irrigate the 
d(\sired acreage of land. The flow out of the dam is arranged so that 
the reservoir will be empty and the gates of the sluices open when the 
flood again comes tlown the river. There are no canals of large size 
taken from the river near the dam, so the water which is stc)r(>d is 
turned into the river and taken out again farther down the stream. 

By this system of managing the gates in the sluices, it is hoped to 
allow the greater part of the nuuldy water to go below the dam and 
to store the clearer waters of the later part of the flood. These later 
waters are known to be much clearer and to carr}' a sediment which 
will r(Mnain in suspension for a long time; yet the ])roblem of silt in 
this reser\oir is a serious one and the results which are ohtaininl from 
this t3'pe of dam will be watched with interest by American irrigation 
experts. 

The reservoir as now completed has a capacity of SOU, 000 acre-feet, 
or, according to Mr. Willcocks, enough water to irrigate »)00,000 acres 
of cotton and sugar cane. As has Ixhmi stated, this water is not to be 
used for tln^ extcMision of the irrigated area in Egypt, but is intended 
to he used in extending the area of perennially iri'igated land at the 
expense of the area under basin irrigation. 

The cost of the dam can not l>e stated accurately. The oi'iginal 
estimate was $S, 750,000, but this sum was exceeded. The total cost 
to date is Ix^tween the at)ove sum and $10,000,000, making the cost 
about i|^12..50 per acre-foot. The \'alue of this water to EgN'pt is said 
to h(^ $100,000,000, or ten times th(» actual cost. 

'i'lie Assuan dam is but one of a lai'gc luunherof engineering works 
planned for the complete sulijugation and conti'ol of th(> Nile. It is 
hoped to build weirs and controlli^ig works on the Nileata luunherof 
points ah<)\-e Assuan for t\\o irrigation of desert land in th.e Sudan and

and one its under constinictjon at Zit'ta. Tbe.se weirs are desi^'iied to 
raise the level of the Nile at low water to till the irriuating- canals 
already in operation or to he consti'ucted. As a safety valve, to let 
the hig-hestand destructive Hoods escape, a plan is under consideration 
to construct a canal to Wady Rayaii, a depression in the Sahara to the 
Avest of the Nile Valley, and drain into it the excess of water which 
w<mld otherwise damage Middh^ and Lower Egypt. . 
To again (juote from Mr. \Villcocks: 

"The Assuan dam is a work of a type designed for the conservation 
of the Hood waters and wdiich is new in the world. If successful it 
will mark an epoch in dam building. There must be sites on the tor- 
rential rivers of the arid and semiarid regions of South Africa, Aus- 
tralia, and North America, where dams of the type of the one at 
Assuan will supply a want which has long l)een recognized. 

"A reservoir dam, which will allow the earlier floods laden with 
deposits a free and unimpeded passage and which will afterwards 
captivate the comparatively clear waters of the terminal inundations 
and early percolations and store them for subseiiuent use, ought to put 
new life into many abandonetl projects for perennial irrigation. But 
the provision of perennial irrigation is not the only ()l)ject for which 
this type of dam may be employed. Provided with its numerous Hood 
openings, it may be looked upon as a weir capable of controlling the 
mightiest rivers in Hood just as ordinary weirs control them in times 
of low supply; it may thus \)o utilized for the regulation of Hood sup- 
plies of rivers and for their employment in basin or inundation irriga- 
tion. As designed for Assuan, its use is restricted to sites where 
broad platforms of sound rock can be coimted upon, but designed in 
'l)cton armee' or "ribbed concrete.*' I hope to see it utilized in 
narrow gorges and throttled valleys, where £20 will go as far as €50 
in a broad platform." 

Unfortunately, in America the characteristics of our rivers, their 
Hoods and the amount of sediment carried, are not as well known as 
they should be; but each yt^ar adds volumes to our knowledge of these 
streams, and by the time any extensive system is to be put in opiM-ation 
our knowledge will be much more complete.

point, was made the Atlantic port in 1597 for this isthmian line of 
transit. The harbor of Porto Bello is excellent, and the location was 
more healthful, although Porto Bello itself was subsequently aban- 
doned, laroely on account of its unhealthfidness. 

As early as 1534, or soon after that date, boats l)egan to pass up 
and down the Chagres River between Cruces and its mouth on the 
Caribbean shore, and thence along the coast to Nombre de Dios and 
subset [uently to Porto Bello. The importance of the commerce which 
sprang up across the isthmus and in connection with this isthmian 
route is well set forth in the last paragraph on page ""IS of the Report 
of the Isthmian Canal Commission: 

The commerce of the isthmus increased during the century and 
Panama Ix'came a place of great mercantile importance, with a protit- 
able trade extending to the Spice Islands and the Asiatic coast. It was 
at the height of its prosperity in 15^5, and was called with good reason 
the tollgate between western Europe and eastern Asia. Meanwhile 
the commerce whose tolls only brought such benefits to Panama, 
enriched Spain, and her people were generously rewarded for the aid 
given by Ferdinand and Isalxdla in the effort to open a direct route 
westward to Cathay, not\\ithstanding the disadvantages of the isthmian 
transit. 

This conmiercial prosperity suggested to those interested in it, and 
soon after its beginning, the possil)ility of a ship canal to connect the 
waters of the two oceans. It is stated even that Charles V direct'ed 
that a survey should be made for the purpose of determining the feasi- 
bility of such a work as early as 1520. "The governor, Pascual Anda- 
goya, reported that such a work was impracticable and that no king, 
however powerful he might be, was capable of forming a junction of 
the two seas or of furnishing the means of carrying out such an 
undertaking." 

From that time on the city of Panama increased in WH^alth and popu- 
lation in consequence of its commercial importance. Trade was estab- 
lished with the west coast of South America and with the ports on the 
Pacitic coast of Central America. In spite of the fact that it was made 
l)y the Spaniards a fortress second in strength in America only to ohi 
Cartagena, it was sacked and burned by Morgan's buccaneers in leb- 
ruar}', 1671. The new city, that is, the present city, was founded in 
1678, it not being considered advisable to rebuild on the old site. 

The project of a canal on this route was kept alive for more than 
three centuries by agitation sometimes active and sometimes appar- 
ently dying out for long periods, until there was organized in Paris, 
in 1S7(), a company entitled "Societe Civile Internationale du C'anal 
Interoceanique," with Gen. Etienne Tin-r as president, for the purpose 
of making surveys and explorations for a ship canal between the two 
oceans on this route. 

The work on the isthmus for this company was prosecuted imder 
the direction of Lieut. L. N. B. Wyse, a French naval officer, and he

obtained for his coiifpan^^ in L8T8 a concession I'l-oni the CA)h)nit)ian 
Government, conferr}iro-,tlK' requisite rights and ])i'ivileiL;es for tiie 
construction of a ship canal on the Panama loute and the authority to 
do such oth(M' tilings as might ^)o necessary or a(l\isa))le in coTuiection 
with that project. This concession is oi-dinariiy known as the Wyse 
concession. 

A general ])lan for this trans-Jsthmian canal was the subject of con- 
sideration at an international scit'iititic congress conxcned in Paris in 
May, 18Ti*, and composed of b'55 delegates from France, (Jermany, 
Great Britain, tho Tnited States, and other countries, hut the major- 
ity of whom were French. This congress was con\-ene(l imder the 
auspices of Ferdinand (l(> Lesseps, and after remaining in session I'or 
two weeks a decision, not unanimous, was i-eached that an intiU'na- 
tional canal ought to be located on the Panama rout(\ and that it 
should be a sea-levtd canal without locks, l^hc^ fact was a])parently 
overlooked that the rang(^ ])etwcen high and low tides in the I)ay of 
Panama, al)out 20 f(H^t, was so great as to require a tidal lock at that 
terminus. 

A conq)any entitU^d " (lom])agnie l^ni\erselle dn Canal Interocea- 
nicpie'' was organized, with Fei'dinand de Lesseps sis ])resi(lent, inun<v 
diately after the adjournment of the international congress. The 
purpose of this conq)any was the construction and o))eration of the 
canal, and it pui'chased the Wyse concession from the original com- 
pany for the sum of l(),(ioo, (»(»() fi'ancs. An immediate but unsuccess- 
ful atteni})! was made to iinance the company in August, bsTl*. This 
necessitated a second attempt, which was made in December, ISSO, 
with success, as the (Mitire issue of <!()(), O()0 shares of nOO francs each 
was sold. Two years were then devotcnl to examinations and sur\'eys 
and preliminary work upon t\\o canal, ])ut it was iss."! hefoi'c opei'a- 
tions upon a larg(>- scal(> were Ix^gun. The })lan adopted and followed 
by this company was that of a sea-levcd canal, allording a depth of 
29.5 feet and a bottom width of 72 feet. It was estimated that the 
necessai'v excaxation would amount to 1 57,* '( )<>.(»( 10 cubic yai'ds. 

The .\tlantic tei'iuiinis of this canal route was located at Colon, and 
at Panama on the Pacific side. The line passed through the low 
grounds just north of jVloid-cey Hill to (iatun. (! miles from the Atlan- 
tic terminus, and where it lii-st met tlu^ ('hagics I\i\-er. For a dis- 
tance of 21 miles it followed the general course of tln^ Cliagres to 
Obispo, but left it at the latter point and ])assing u[) tlu^ \'alley of a 
small tributary cut through the continental di\ide at Cul(d)ra, and 
descended thence by the valley <>f the Rio (iraruh^ to the mouth of 
that river where it enters Panama W.vy. The total length of this line 
from 30 feet depth in the ,\tlantic to the same depth in tln^ Pacific 
was about -t7 miles. Tlu^ maxinuun lu^ight of the contiiKMital di\ide 
on the center line of the canal in the Culebra cut was about y>o-i feet 
above the sea, which 'is a little higluM- than the lowest point of the 



540 THE PANAMA KOUTE FOR A SHIP CANAL. 

divide in that vicinit}'. ImportcXiit con.siderations in connection with 
the adjacent alignment made it advisable to cut the divide at a point 
not its lowest. 

Various schemes were proposed for the purpose of controlling the 
floods of the Chagres River, the suddenness and magnitude of which 
were at once recognized as among the greatest difficulties to be 
encountered in the construction of the work. Although it was seri- 
ously proposed at one time to control this difficulty l),y building a dam 
across the Chagres at Gaml)oa, that plan was never adopted, and the 
problem of control of the Chagres floods remained unsolved for a long 
period. 

It was estimated by De Lesseps in ISSO that eight years would l)e 
required for the completion of the canal, and that its cost would be 
$127,000,000. The companj^ prosecuted its work with activity until 
the latter part of 1 SS7, when it became evident that the sea-level plan 
of canal was not feasible with the resources at its conunand. Changes 
were soon made in the plans, and it was concluded to expedite the 
completion of the canal by the introduction of locks, deferring the 
change to a sea-level canal until some period when conditions would 
be sufficiently favorable to enable the company to attain that end. 
Work was prosecuted under this modifled plan until ISSH, when the 
company became l)ankrupt and was dissolved i)y judgment of the 
French court called the Tribunal Civil de la Seine, on February 4, 188'.>. 
An officer, called the li<(uidator, corresponding quite closely to a 
receiver in this country, was appointed by the court to take charge of 
tho company's afl'airs. At no time was the project of completing the 
canal abandoned, but the liquidator gradually curtailed operations and 
finally suspended the work on May 15, ISSD. 

He determined to take into careful consideration the feasibility of 
the project, and to that end appointed a "commission d'etudes," com- 
posed of eleven French and foreign engineers, headed I)y Ins[)ector- 
General (Tuillemaiii, director of the Ecole Nationah^ des Pouts et 
Chaussees. This commission visited the Isthmus and made a careful 
study of the entire enterprise, and subsecjuently submitted a plan for 
the canal involving locks. The cost of completing the entire work 
was estimated to be $112,500, 00(», but the sum of $r)2, 100,000 more 
was added to cover administration and flnancing, making a total of 
$174,600,000. This commission also gave an a})proximate estimate^ of 
the value of the work done and of the plant at $S7,8O0.O0O, to which 
some have attached uuich more im])oitance than did the commission 
itself. The latter appears simply to have made the ''estimate"' one- 
half of the total cost of completing thi> work added to that of tinancing 
and administration, as a loose approximation, calling it an "intuitive 
estimate;" in other words, it was simply a gu(\ss l)ased upon such 
information as had Ix^en gain(*d in connection with tlu* work done on 
the Istlnnus.

I>3' this time tlic period spccitied for coinpletion uiidcr the oriyiiiul 
W3'se concession hiid yearly expired. The liquidator then souoht 
from the Colombian Government an extension of ten years, >vhieh was 
granted under the Colombian law dated December 2(!, IS'HI. Tliis 
extension was based upon the provision that a new (•oni})any siiould 
be formed and work on the canal resumed not later than Fe])ruar3' 2S, 
18!>o. The latter condition was not fuitilled, and a second extension 
was obtained on April 4, ISl))), wdiich })rovided that the ten-\'ear exten- 
sion of time granted in 1S!H) might })egin to run at an\' time |)i'i()r to 
Octol)er 31, 1804, but not hiter than (hat date. When it becaiiu; 
apparent that the provisions of this last extension would not be car- 
ried out an agreement l)etweeji the Colombian Government and the 
New Panama Company was entered into on April 2<'), I !»()(), which 
extended the time of completion to Octo])er 31, 1910. The validity of 
this last extension of time has been questioned. 

A new company, commonly known as the New' Panama Canal Com- 
pany, was organized on the iJOth of October, 1S94, with a ca])ital stock 
of 650,000 shares of 100 francs each. Under the provisions of the 
agreement of December tiO, 1890, authorizing an extension of time for 
the construction of the canal, 50,000 shares passed as fidl-paid stociv to 
the Colombian Government, leaving the actual working capital of the 
New Panama Company at 60,000,000 francs, that amount having Ixhmi 
subsci'il)ed in cash. The most of this capital stock was subscribed for l)v 
certain loan assocititions, administrators, contractors, and others against 
whom suits had been l)rought in consequence of the tinancial difficul- 
ties of the old companv, it having been charged in the scandals attend- 
ing bankruptcy proceedings that they had protited illegally. Those 
suits were discontinued under agreements to sul)scril)e by the parties 
interested to the capital stock of the new company. The sums thus 
ol)tained constituted more than two-thirds of the 60,000,00i.> francs 
remaining of the share capital of the new company after the Colond)iaii 
Government received its 50,000 shares. The old company had raised 
by the sale of stock and bond not far from $24(J,O0O.00O, and the num- 
])er of p(>rsons holding the securities thus sold has been estimated at 
over i;o(),ooo. 

The l*anama Uailroad Company holds a concession from the CoK)m- 
bian Government giving it rights prior to those of the Wvs(> concession, 
so that th(» latter could not become eil'ective without th(> concurrence 
of the Panama Railroad Company. This is shown l)v the language of 
Article III of the W3^se cgncession, Avliich reads as follows: 

"If the line of the canal to be constructed from sea to sea should 
pass to the west and to the north of the imaginar3" straight line wliicii 
joins Cape Tiburon with (iarachine Point, the grantees must (Miter 
into some amicable arrangement with the Panama Uaih'oad CompanN^ 
or pay an indemnit3', which shall be established in accordance with the

provi.sion.s of law 46, of August 10, 1867, ' approving the contract 
celebration on July 5, 1867, reformatory of the contract of April 15, 
1850, for the construction of an iron railroad from one ocean to the 
other through the Isthmus of Panama.'" It became necessary, there- 
fore, in order to control this feature of the situation, for the old 
Panama Company to secui-e at least a majority of the stock of the 
Panama Hail road Company-. As a matter of fact the old Panama 
Canal Company purchased nearly 69,000 out of the 70,000 shares of 
the I*anama Railroad Company, each such share having a par Aalue of 
$100. These shares of Panama Railroad stock are now held in trust 
for the l)enelit of the New Panama Canal Company. A part of the 
expenditures of the old company therefore covered the cost of the 
Pananni Railroad Company's shares now held in trust for the benefit 
of the new compan3^ 

Immediately after its organization the New Panama C-anal Company 
resumed the work of excavation in the Emperador and Cule])ra cuts 
with a force of men which has been reported as varjdng between 1,!»00 
and 3,600. It also gave thorough consideration to the subject of the 
best plan for the completion of the canal. The company's charter 
provided for the appointment of a special engineering commission of 
five members by the company and the liquidator to report upon the work 
done and the conclusions to be drawn from its stud3^ This report 
was to be rendered when the amount expended Ijy the new company 
should reach about one-half of its capital. At the same time the com- 
pany also appointed a ""Comite Technique," constituted of 14 eminent 
European and American engineers, to make a study of the entire pro- 
ject, which was to avail itself of existing data and the results of such 
other additional surve3^s and examinations as it might consider neces- 
sary. The report rendered l)v this committee was elaborate, and it 
was made No\'eml)er 16, 1898. It was referred to the statutor}^ com- 
mission of five, to which reference has already been made, which com- 
mission reported in 1899 that the canal could be consti'ucted within 
the limits of time and money estimated. On December oO, 18!>9, a 
special meeting of the stockholders of the new company was callinl, 
but the licjuldator, who was one of th(^ largest stockholders, declined 
to take part in it, and the report ('onse(|uently has not received the 
reipiired statutory consideration. 

The plan adopted by the compan}" placed the miiiinuun elevation of 
the summit level of the canal at 97^ feet above the sea, and a maximum 
at 102i feet above the same datum. It provided for a dei)th of :i9i 
feet of water and a l)()ttom width of canal prism of about 98 feet, 
except at special places where this width was increased. A dam was 
to be built near Bohio, wdiich would thus form an artificial lake. Avith 
its surface varying from 52.5 to 65.6 feet above the sea. Under this 
plan there would be a flight of two locks at Bohio, about 16 miles 



THP: PANAMA ROUTE FOR A SHIP CANAL. 543 

from the Atlantic end'of the canal, and another Hi^-ht of two locks at 
Obi.spo, about 14 miles from Bohio. thus reachinj>- the .summit level; a 
single lock a^ Paraiso, between (> and 7 miles from Obispo; a ilight of 
two locks at Pedro Miguel, about 1.25 miles from Paraiso, and linally 
a single lock at Miraflores, a mile and a (juarter from Pedro Miguel, 
bringing the canal down to the ocean ele^■ation. The location of this 
line was practically the same as that of the old company. The a\'ail- 
able length of each lock cluunbtM' was 738 feet, while the available 
width was 82 feet, the de})th in the clear l)eing 82 feet 1(» inches. The 
lifts were to vary from 2«) to 33 feet. It was estimated that the cost 
of finishing th(> canal on this plan would ])e $101, 850, 0(H), exclusive of 
administration and financing. 

In order to control the floods of tlu^ C'hagres Kiver, and to furnish 
a sup})ly of water for the summit le\'el of the canal, a dam was planned 
to l)e ])uilt at a point called Alhajuela, about 12 miles from Obispo, 
from which a feeder about 10 miles long, partly an open canal and 
partly in tunnels or pipe, would conduct the water from the reservoir 
thus formed to the summit level. 

Although the plan as described was adopted, the "Comite Tech- 
nicpie" a])parently favored a modification by which a nuu-h d(M^per 
exca\ation through Ckdebra Hill would be made, thus omitting the 
locks at l)oth Obispo and Paraiso and making the le\el of tlu> artificial 
Lake Bohio the sunnnit level of the canal. In this modified plan the 
l>ottom of the sunnuit level would 1)e al>out 32 feet al)ove the sea, and 
the mininuun elevation of the sununit le\el (51.5 feet al)o\e tlu^ sea. 
This modification of plan had the n.aterial advantage of (diminating 
l)oth the Obispo and Paraiso locks. The total estimated cost of com- 
pleting the canal under this plan was about $105,500,000. Although 
the Alhajuela feeder would be omitted, the Alhajuela reservoir would 
be retained as an agent for controlling the Ohagres floods and to form 
a reserve water supph'. The difference in cost of these two plans was 
comparatively small, but the additional time required to compl(>te 
that with the lower sununit lev(d was probably one of the main 
considerations in its rejection by the conunittee having it under 
consideration. 

This brings the project u|) to the tim<' when the Isthmian ( anal 
Commission was created in isitll and when the forc(\s of the New 
Panama (^anal C'ompany were employed either in taking cai'c of the 
enormous amount of plant bequeathed to it by the old company or in 
the great excavation at pjUiperador and Culebra. The total (\\ca\ation 
of all classes, made up to the time when that Commission i'endei'(Ml its 
report, amounted to at)out 77,00<»,000 cu])ic yards. 

The work of the Connnission consisted of a conq)rehensive and 
detailed extunination of the entire project and all its accessoi'ies, as 
contemplated by the New Panama Canal Company, and any moditica- 



544 THE PANAMA ROUTE FOR A SHIP CANAL. 

tions ot its plaiif^, either as to alignment, elevations, or suosidlary 
works, Avhich it inig-ht determine advisable to recommend. In the 
execution of this work it was necessary, among- other things, to send 
engineering parties on the line of the Panama route for the purpose 
of making surveys and examinations necessary to confirm estimates of 
the New Panama Canal Company as to quantities, elevations, or other 
physical features of the line selected, or required in moditications of 
alignment or plans. In order to accomplish this portion of its work 
the Commission placed live working parties on the Panama I'oute with 
20 engineers and other assistants and 41 lal)orers. 

The Commission adopted for the purposes of its plans and estimates 
the route selected by the New Panama Canal Company, which is essen- 
tially that of the old company. Starting from the O-fathom contour 
in the harbor of Colon the line follows the low marshy ground adjoin- 
ing the Bay of Limon to its intersection with the Mindi River; thence 
through the low ground continuing to Gatun, about miles from 
Colon, where it first meets the Chagres River. From this point to 
Obispo the canal line follows practically the general course of the 
Chagres River, although at one point in the marshes below Bohio it is 
nearly 2 miles from the farthest bend in the river, at a small place 
called Ahorca Lagarto. Bohio is about 17 miles from the Atlantic 
terminus, and 01)ispo about 30 miles. At the latter point the course 
of the Chagres River, passing upstream, lies to the northeast, while 
the general direction of the canal line is southeast toward Panama, the 
latter leaving the former at this location. The canal route follows up 
the general course of a small stream, called the Camacho, for a distance 
of nearly 5 miles, where the continental divide is found and in which 
the great Culebra cut is located, about 8(3 miles from Colon and 13 
miles from the Panama terminus. After passing through the Culebra 
cut the canal route follows the course of the Rio Grande River to its 
mouth at Panama Baj^ The mouth of the Rio Grande, where the 
canal line is located, is about a mile and a half westerly of the city of 
Panama. 4'he Rio Grande is a small, sluggish stream throughout the 
last r> miles of its course, and for that distance the canal excavation 
would be made mostly in soft silt or mud. 

Although the line selected by the French company is that adopted 
by the Isthmian Canal Com})any for its purposes, a niunber of most 
imj)ortant features of the general plan have been materially modified 
by the Commission, as will be easily understood from what has already 
been stated in comiection with the FrcMich ])lans. 

The feasibility of a sea-level canal, hut with a tidal lock at the 
Panama end, was carefully Qonsidered by the Commission, and an 
approximate estimate of the cost of completing the work on that 
plan was made. In round luuubers this estimated cost was about 
$250,000,000, and the time required to complete the work A\ould 



THE PANAMA EOUTP: FOR A SHIP CANAL. 545 

probably be nearly or quite twice that needcnl for the construction of 
a canal with locks. The Conuiiis.slon therefore adopted a project for 
the canal with locks. Both plans and estimates were carefully devel- 
oped in accordance therewith. 

The harl)or of Colon has been fairly satisfactory for the conniierce 
of that port, but it is open to the north, .and there are probably two 
or three days in every year during which northers blow into the har- 
bor with sucli intensity that ships anchored there must put to sea in 
order to escape (huiiag'e. Tlie western limit of this harbor is an arti- 
ficial point of hmd formed by material deposited by the old Panama 
Canal Company; it is called Christo})!! Colon, and near its extreme 
end are two large frame residences 1)uilt for De Lesseps. The entrance 
to the canal is immediately south of this artificial point. The CV)m- 
mission ]irojected a canal entrance from the (i-fathom contour in the 
Bay of Limon, in which the harbor of Colon is found, swinging on a 
gentle curve, G,5(><) feet radius, to the left around behind the artilicial 
point just mentioned and then across the shore line to the right into 
the lowland southerly of Colon. This channel has a width of 5(H» feet 
at the bottom, with side slopes of 1 on 3, except on the .second, curve, 
which is somewhat sharper than the first, where the bottom width is 
made SUO feet for a length of SOU feet for the purpose of a turning- 
basin. This brings the line into the canal proper, forming a well- 
protected liar])or for nearly a mile inside of the shore line. The 
distance from the 6-fathom line to this interior har1)or is about 'J. .miles. 
The total cost of constructing the channel into the har])or and the 
harbor itself is 18,057,707, and the annual cost of maintenance is 
placed at $30,000. The harbor would be perfectly protected from the 
northers which occasionally blow with such intensity in the Bay of 
Limon, and it could readily be made in all weathers ])y vessels seek- 
ing it. 

The harbor at the Pacitic end of the channel where it joins l*:mania 
Bay is of an entirely different character in some respects. The Bay 
of Panama is a place of light winds. Indeed it has been asy-rted that 
the dithculties sometimes experienced by sailing vessels in (inding 
wind enough to take them out of Panama Bay are so serious as to 
constitute a material objection to the location for a shi}) canal on the 
Panama route. This difficulty undoubtedly exists at times, but the 
simple fact is to be rememl)ered that Panama was a port for sailing- 
ships for more than two hundred years b(>foi-e a steamship was known. 
The harbor of Panama, as it now exists, is a large area of water at 
the extreme nortlun-n limit of the bay, immediately adjacent to the 
city of Panama, protected from the south by the three islands of 
Perico, Naos, and Culebra. It has been called a roadstead. There is 
good anchorage for heavv^-draft ships, but for the most part the water

is shallow. With the Commission's requirement of a mininnim ciepth 
of water of 35 feet, a channel about i miles long from the mouth of 
the Rio Grande to the 6-fathom line in Panama Ba}- must be exca- 
vated. This channel would haVe a bottom Avidth of 200 feet with side 
slopes of 1 on 3 where the material is soft. Considerable rock would 
have to be excavated in this channel. At 4.41 miles from the (Vfathom 
line is located a wharf at the point called La Boca. A branch of the 
Panama Railroad Company runs to this wharf, atid at the present time 
deep-draft ships lie up alongside of it to take on and discharge cargo. 
The wharf is a steel frame structure, founded upon steel cylinders,

carried down to bed i-ock by the ])n('umatic process. Its cost was 
about $1,284,00(». The total cost of the excavated channel leading 
from Panama Harbor to the pier at I^a Boca is estimated by the Com- 
mission at $1,464,513. As the harbor at Panama is considered an 
open rcxidstead, it requires no estimate for annual cost of maintenance. 
Starting from the harbor of Colon, the prism of the canal is exca- 
vated through the low and for the most part marshy ground to the 
little village called Bohio. The prism wouJd cut the Chagres River 
at a number of points, and would require a diversion channel for that 
river for a distance of about 5 miles on the westerly side of the canal.

Levees, or protective eijihankments, would iilso l>e rcMiuired on the 
same side of the eanfll between Bohio and (latiui. the C'hag'res River 
leaving' the canal line at the latter point on its way to the sea. 

The principal (Migineering feature of the entire route is found at 
Bohio; it is the grc^it dam across the Chagres Rixer at that Point, 
forming Lake liohio, th(^ sunnnit level of the canal. The new Panama 
Canal Company located tiiis dam at a point about 17 mil(>s from Colon, 
and designed to make it an earth structure suitably pa\-ed on its faces, 
but without any other masonry feature. Some borings had been made 
along the site, and test i)its were also dug by the Fi'ench engineers. 
It was the conviction of the Isthmian Canal (Jommission, however, 
that the character of the pi'oposed dam might be affected l)y a further 
examination of the subsurface matei'ial at the site. Consecjuently the 
boring' parties of the Conmiission sunk a lai'ge mnnbei' of ))ore holes 
at six different sections or possible sites along the river in the vicinity 
of the French location. These borings revealed great irregularity in 
the character and disposition of the m-aterial below the ))ed and l)anks 
of the river. In some places the upper stratum of material was 
almost clear clay, and in other places clear sand, while all degrees of 
admixture of clay and sand were also found. At th(» French site the 
bed rock at the deep(\st point is 143 feet below sea level, with large 
masses of per\'ious and semipervious sand, grayel, and mixtures of 
those materials with clay. Apparently there is a geological valley in 
the rock along the general course of the Chagres River in this vicinity 
tilled with sand, gravel, and (day, irregularly distributed and with all 
deg-rees of admixture, large masses in all cases being of open texture 
and pervious to water. The site adopted by the Conmiission for the 
purposes of its plans and estimates is located nearly half a mile down 
the course of the rivm- from that selected by the New Panama Canal 
Company. The geological valley is nearly 2,000 feet wide at this loca- 
tion, but the deepest rock disclosed b}' the borings of the Conmiission 
is but 128 feet below sea levcd. The actual channel of the river is not 
more than 150 feet wide and lies on the extreme easterly side of the 
valley. The easterly or right bank of the river at this place is clean 
rock and rises abruptly to an elevation of about 40 feet above the river 
surface at ordinary stages. The left or westerly bank of the river is 
compacted clay and sand, and rises equally as a])ru})tly as the rocky 
bank of the other side, and to about the same elevation. From the 
top of the abrupt sandy clay bank a plateau of ratlun* remarkable uni- 
formity of elevation extends for about 1,200 feet in a southw^esterly 
direction to the rocky hill in which the Bohio locks would be located. 
The rock slope on the easterl}^ or northerly baidv of the river runs 
down under the sandy river bed, but at such an inclination that within 
the limits of the channel the deepest rock is less than 100 feet below 
sea level.

THE PANAMA KOUTE FOR A SHIP CANAL. 



After the coinpletion of all its exaiuiiiation.s, and after a careful 
study of the data disclosed by them, the Commission deemed it advis- 
able to plan such a dam as would cut ofi' absolutely all possible sub- 
surface flow or seeimg'e through the sand and gravel below the river 
surface. It is to be observed that such a subsurface flow might either 
disturl) the sta))ility of an earth dam or endanger the water supply of 
the sununit level of the canal, or both. The plan of dam finally

I'rofilc (if Bohio dam site, selected fur plans and estimate, with section of dam. 

adopted by the Commission for the purposes of its estim'ates is shown 
by the accompanying plans and sections. A heavy core wall of con- 
crete masonry extends from bed rock across the entire geological 
valley to the top of the structure, or to an elevation of 100 feet above 
sea level, thus absolutely closing the entire valley against any possible 
flow. The tliickness of this wall at the bottom is 30 feet, but at an 
elevation of 30 feet below sea level its sides begfin to batter at such a 



THE PANAMA ROUTE FOR A SHIP CANAL. 549 

rate as to make the thiekness of the wall S feet at its top. On either 
side of this wall are heavy masses of earth embankment of selected 
material properly deposited in Ia3'ers with surface slopes of 1 on 3. 
As shown by the plans, the lower portions of the core wall of this 
dam would be sunk to bed rock by the pneumatic process, the joints 
between the caissons being closed and sealed by cylinders sunk in 
recesses or wells, also as shown by the plans. 

The profile of this route shows that the sunuiiit level would have an 
ordinary elevation of 85 feet al)Ove the sea, but it may be drawn down 
for uses of the canal to a minimum elevation of 82 feet above the 
same datum. On the other hand, under circumstances to be discussed 
later, it may rise durino- the floods of the Chagres to an elevation of 
90 or possibly 91 or 92 feet above the level of the sea. The top of the 
dam, therefore, would be from 8 to 10 feet above the highest possible 
water surface in the lake, which is sufficient to guard against wash or 
overtopping of the dam by waves. The total width of the dam at its 
top would be 20 feet, and the entire inner slope would be paved with 
heavy riprap suitably placed and bedded. 

This dam would create an artificial lake having a superficial area 
during high water of al)out 40 square miles. The water would l)e 
backed up to a point called Alhajuela, about 25 miles up the river 
from Bohio. For a distance of nearly 14 miles — i. e., from Bohio to 
Obispo — the route of the canal would lie in this lake. Although the 
water would be from 80 to 90 feet deep at the dam for several miles 
below Obispo, it would be necessary to make some excavation along 
the general course of the Chagres in order to secure the minimum 
depth of 35 feet for the navigable channel. 

The feature of Lake Bohio of the greatest importance to the safe 
and convenient operation of the canal is that by which the floods of 
the river Chagres are controlled or regulated. That i-iver is but little 
less than 150 miles long, and its drainage area, as nearly as can be 
estimated, contains about 875 square miles. A])()ve Bohio its current 
moves some sand and a little silt in times of flood, but usually it is a 
clear-water stream. In low water its discharge may fall to 350 cubic 
feet per second. 

As is well known, the floods of the Chagres lia\c at times l)een 
regarded as almost, if not quite, insurmountal)le obstacles to the con- 
struction of a canal on this line. The greatest flood of which there is 
any semblance of a relialfle record is one which occurred in 1879. No 
direct measurements were made, but it is stated, with apparent 
authority, that the flood elevation at Bohio was 39.3 feet above low 
water. If the total channel through which the flood flowed at that 
time had been as large as at pres(>nt, actual gaugings or measurements 
of subsequent floods show that th(> maxinumi dischargt; in 1879 might 
have been at the rate of 13(!,0(l0 cubic feet per second. As a matter 



550 THE PANAMA ROUTE FOR A SHIP CANAL. 

of fact, the total channel section in that year was less than it is at the 
present time. Hence, if it be assumed that a Hood of 140,000 cubic 
feet per second must be controlled, an error on the safe side will be 
committed. Other g-reat floods of which there are reliable records are 
as follows:

The maximum measured rate of the 1890 flood was 74,998 cubic feet 
per second, and that of 1893, 48,975 cubic feet per second. It is clear, 
therefore, that a flood flow of 75,000 cubic feet per second is very rare, 
and that a flood of 140,000 cubic feet per second exceeds that of which 
we have any record for practically forty years. 

It is obvious that the dam, as designed by the Commission, is of such 
character that no water must be permitted to flow over its crest or even 
in immediate proximity to the downstream embankment. Indeed, it 
is not intended by the Commission that there shall be any wasteway or 
discharge anywhere near the dam. At a point about 3 miles southwest 
of the site of the dam at Bohio is a low saddle or notch in the hills, 
near the headwaters of a small stream called the Gigante River. The 
elevation of this saddle or notch is such that a solid masonry weir, with 
a crest 2,000 feet long, iiuw readily be constructed with its foundations 
on bed rock without deep excavation. This structure is called the 
Gigante spillway, and all surplus flood waters from the Chagres would 
flow over it. The waters discharged would flow down to and through 
some large marshes, one called Peiia Blanca and another Agua Clara, 
before rejoining the Chagres. Inasmuch as the canal line runs just 
easterly of those marshes, it would be necessary to protect it with the 
levees or embankments to which allusion has already been made. 
These embankments are neither much extended nor very costl}^ for 
such a project. The })rotection of the canal would be further aided 
b}^ a short artificial chiuinel between the two marshes, Pefia Rlanca and 
Agua Clara, for which })rovision is made in the estimates of the Com- 
mission. After the surplus waters from the Gigante spillway pass 
th(\se marshes they again enter the Chagres River or How over the 
low, half-su})merged country along its borders, and thence through its 
mouth to the sea near the town of Chagres, about ti miles northwest 
of (Jatun. 

The masonry crest of the(iigant(^ spillway would be [)laced at an 
elevation of 85 feet above the sea. identically the same as that which 
ma}^ be called the normal sununit level of the canal. It is estimated 



THE PANAMA ROUTE FOR A SHIP CANAL. 551 

that tbe total usc^s ot'watcj in the canal atWed to the loss by o\'apoTa- 
tion, taken at <! in('li(\'=! in depth per month, from the surface of the 
lake will amount to about 1,()T(» culjic feet per stn-ond if the traftic 
through the canal should amount to 10, 000, 000 tons per annum in 
ships of ordinary size. Tiiis draft per second is th(^ sum of -iot! cul)ic 
feet per second for lockage, '207 for evaporation. ^."Xi for leakage at 
lock gates, and '200 for power and other j)urposes, making a total of 
1,063, which hsis l)een taken as 1,070 cul)ic feet per second. The 
amount of storage in Lake Bohio ])etween the cdevations of 85 and 82 
feet above sea level, as designed, is suthcient to suppl}" the needs of 
that traffic in excess of the smallest I'ecorded low- water How of the 
Chagres River during the dry season of a low-Vainfall year. The 
lowest monthh' average tlow of the Chagres on record at Bohio' is 
600 cubic feet per second for March, 181)1, and for the purposes of 
this computation that minimum tlow has been supposed to continue 
for three months. This includes a sensible margin of safet}^ In not 
even the driest 3'(nir, therefore, can it b(^ reasonably expected that the 
summit level of the canal would fall below the elevation of 82 feet 
until the total traffic of the canal carried in ships of the present ordi- 
nary size shall exceed Lo,0()0,000 tons. If the average sizt^ ot ships 
continues to increase, as will prol)ably be the case, less water in pro- 
portion to tonnage will l)e required for the purposes of lockage. This 
follows from the fact that with a given tonnage the greater the capacity 
of the ships tlu^ less the numlxn- recpiired, and consequently the less 
will be the numl)er of lockages made. 

On the other hand it can be shown that Avitli a depth of 5 feet of 
water on the crest of the (xigante spillway the discharge of that weir 
2,000 feet long' will be at the rate of 78,2()0 cubic feet per second. 
If the flood waters of the Chagres' shoidd flow into I^ake Bohio until the 
head of water on the crest of the Gigante weir rises to 7i feet, the rate 
of discharge over that weir would be 140,000 cubic feet per second, 
which, as already shown, c^xceeds at least by a little the highest flood 
rate on record. The operation of Lake Bohio as a flood controller or 
regulator is therefore exceinlingly simple. Hie flood waters of the 
Chagres would pour into the lake and inuuediiit(>ly begin to flow over 
the Gigante weir, and contimie to do so at an inci'inising rate as the 
flood continues. Th(> discharge of the \v<Mr is augnuMited by the 
increasing flood, and decrease^ only at'tei' the passage of the crest of 
the flood \va\'e. No Hood (n'cn as great as the greatest supposablo 
flood on recoi'd can increas(> the elevation of the lake more than 02 to 
92^ feet above sea level, and it will only \)o at long intervals of time 
when floods will rais(! that elevation more tiian al)out 90 f^'et above 
sea level. The control is automatic and unfailingly certain. It pre- 
vents a1)solutely any damage from the highest supposable floods of 
the Chagres, rfnd reserves in Lake Bohio all that is required for the

purpo.ses oi the canal and for wastag-e by evaporation through the 
lowest rainfall seasoi. The floods of the Chag-res, therefore, instead 
of constituting the obstacle to construction and convenient mainte- 
nance of the canal heretofore supposed, are deprived of all their 
prejudical effects and transfornKnl into beneficial agents for the opera- 
tion of the waterwa}". 

The highest floods are of short duration, and it can be stated as a 
general law that the higher the flood the shorter its duration. The 
great floods which it is necessary to consider in connection with the 
maintenance and operation of this canal would last but a comparatively^ 
few hours only. The great flood flow of 140,000 cul)ic feet per second 
would increase the current in the narrowest part of the canal below 
Obispo to possibly 5 feet per second for a few hours only, but that is 
the only inconvenience which would result from such a flood discharge. 
That velocity could be reduced l^y additional excavation. 

Inasmuch as this system of control, devised and adopted by the 
Isthmian Canal Commission, is completely effective in regulating the 
Chagres floods, the reservoir proposed to be constructed by the new 
Panama Canal Company at Alhajuela, on the Chagres about 11 miles 
above Obispo, is not required, and the cost of its construction would 
be avoided. It could, however, as a project, be held in reserve. If 
the traflic of the canal should increase to such an extent that more 
water would be needed for feeding the summit level, the dam could 
be built at Alhajuela so as to impound enough additional water to 
acconnnodate, with that stored in Lake Bohio, at least five times the 
10,000,000 annual traflic already considered. Its existence would at 
the same time act with substantial effect in controlling the Chagres 
floods and relieve the Gigante spillwaj^ of a corresponding amount of 
duty. 

The locks on the Panama route are designed to have '•■ " * a 
usable length of 740 feet and a clear width of S-t feet. They would be 
])uilt chiefly of concrete masonry, while the gates would be of steel 
and of the miter type. 

The great dam at Rohio raises the water surface in the canal from 
sea le\el in th(> Atlantic maritime soetion to an oi'dinaiy maxinuim of 
90 feet above sea level; in otluM- words, the maxinuun ordinary total 
lift would be 1)0 feet. This total lift is divided into two ])arts of 45 
fe(4 cacli. There is th(M'(^foi-e a flight of two locks at IJoliio; indeed, 
there are two flights side b>^ side, as the twin a^rrangement is designed 
to be used at all lock sites on both routes. The typical dimensions 
and arrangements of these locks, with the re()uisite culverts :uul other 
features, * ■" " are not essentially different from other great mod- 
ern ship-canal locks. The excavation for the Bohio locks is made in 
a rocky hill against which the southwesterly end of the proposed 
Bohio dam rests, and tliev are less than 1,000 feet from it. 



THE PANAMA ROUTE FOR A SHIP CANAL. 553 

Aftei leaviiiij; Bobto Luke at Obispo a tlight of two kx-ks is found 
at Pedro Miguel, about- 7,9 miles from the former or '21h miles from 
Bohio. These locks have a total ordinary maximum lift of 60 feet, 
divided into two lifts of 30 feet each. The fifth and last lock on the 
route is at Miratiorcs. The average elevation of water between Pedi-o 
Miguel and Miratiores is ;:>0 feet above mean sea level. Inasmuch as 
the range of tide between high and low in Panama Ba}" is about 20 
feet, the maximum lift at ]\Iiratlores is 40 feet and the minimum about 
20. The twin locks at Miratiores l)ring the canal surface down to the 
Pacific Ocean level, the distance from those locks to the 0-fathom 
curve in Panama Ba}' being 8.54 miles. There are therefore five locks 
on the Panama route, all arranged on the twin plan, and, as on the 
Nicaragua route, all are founded on rock. 

Near Obispo a pair of guard gates are arranged '' so that if it should 
become necessary to draw off the water from the summit cut the level 
of Lake Bohio would not l)e affected." 

An unprecedented concentration of heav}" cutting is found between 
Obispo and Pedro Miguel. This is practically one cut, although the 
northwesterly end toward Obispo is called the Emperador, while the 
deepest part at the other end, about 3 miles from Pedro Miguel, is the 
great Cule])ra cut, with a maximum depth on the center line of the canal 
of 286 feet. On page 93 of the Isthmian Canal Commission's report 
is the following reference to the material in this cut: " There is a little 
ver}" hard rock at the eastern end of this section, and the western 2 
miles are in ordinary materials. The remainder consists of a hard 
indurated clay, with some softer material at the top and some strata 
and dikes of hard rock; In fixing the price it has been rated as soft 
rock, but it must be given slopes equivalent to those in earth. This 
cut has been estimated on the basis of a ])ottom width of 150 feet, with 
side slopes of 1 on 1.'' When the old Panama Canal Company ))egan 
its excavation in this cut considerable difiiculty was experienced by 
the slipping of the material outside of the limits of the cut into the 
excavation, and the marks of that action can be seen plainly at the 
present time. This experience has given an impression that nmch of 
the material in this cut is unstable, but that impression is erroneous. 
The cla>' which slip})ed in the early days of the work was not drained, 
and, like wet clay in numerous places in this country, it slipped down 
into the excavation. This matei'ial is now drained and is perfectly 
stable. There is no reason to anticipate any future difiiculty if reason- 
able conditions of di'ainage are maintained. The high faces of the cut 
will probably weatiier to some extent, although experience with such 
cla}^ faces on the isthmus indicates that the amount of such action will 
be small. As a matter of fact, the material in which the Culebra cut 
is made is stable, and will gi\(' no sensible dilficulty in maintenance.

the easterly .side of the canal the French plan contemplated an exca- 
vated channel to receive a portion of the waters of the Chagres as well 
as the tlow of two smaller rivers — the Gatuncillo and the Mindi — so as 
to conduct them into the Ba}' of Manzanillo. immediately to the east 
of Colon. That so-called diversion channel was nearly completed. 
Under the plan of the Commission it would receive none of the Cha- 
gres flow, l)ut it would be available for intercepting- the drainage of the 
high ground easterly of the canal line and the flow of the two small 
rivers named, so that these waters would not find their way into the 
canal. There are a few other small works of similar charactei' in dif- 
ferent portions of the line, all of which were recogiiized and provided 
for by the Commission. 

The total length of the Panama route from the 6-fathom curve at 
Colon to the same curve in Panama Bay is 49.09 miles. The general 
direction of the route in passing from Colon to Panama is from north- 
west to southeast, the latter point being about 22 miles east of the 
Atlantic terminus. The depression through which the line is laid is 
one of easy topography, except at the continental divide in the 
Culebra cut. As a consequence, there is little heav}^ work of excava- 
tion, as such matters go, except in that cut. A further consequence 
of such topography is a comparatively easy alignment; that is, one in 
which the amount of curvature is not high. The smallest radius of 
curvature is 3,281 feet at the entrance to the inner harbor at the 
Colon end of the route, and where the width is <S( )() feet. The i-adii of 
the remaining curves range from 6,284 feet to 19,()29 feet.

The Culebra cut with steamer Dcutucldami in it. 



As is well known, the entire Central American isthmus is a volcanic 
region, and in the past a considerable number of destructive volcanic 
eruptions have taken place at a number of points. There is a line of 
li\'e volcanoes extending southeasterly through Nicaragua and Costa 
Rica. Many earthquake shocks have occurred throughout Nicaragua, 
Costa Rica, and the State of Panama, some of which have done more 
or less damage in large |)ortions of those districts. * * * Xhe 



556 THE PANAMA KOUTP: FOR A SHIP CANAL. 

conclusions of the Commission us to this feature of the matter are 
concisely stated in the following paragraphs of its report: 

"It is possible and even probable that the more accurately fitting 
portions of the canal, such as the lock gates, may at times be distorted 
by earthquakes, and some inconvenience may result therefrom. That 
contingency may be classed with the accidental collision of ships with 
the gates, and is to be provided for in the same way, by duplicate gates. 

" It is possible also that a fissure might open which would drain the 
canal, and, if it remained open, might destroy it. This possibility 
should not be erected b}^ the fancy into a threatening danger. If a 
timorous imagination is to be the guide, no great work can be under- 
taken anywhere. This risk may be classed with that of a great con- 
flagration in a city, like that of Chicago in 1S71, or Boston in 1872. 

" It is tiie opinion of the Commission that such danger as exists from 
earthquakes is essentially the same for l)oth the Nicaragua and Panama 
routes, and that in neither case is it sufficient to prevent the construc- 
tion of the canal.-' 

The Nicaragua route crosses the line of live volcanoes running from 
northwest to southeast through Central America, and the crater of 
Ometepe in Lake Nicaragua is about 11 miles onh^ from the line. The 
eruptions of Pelee and Souf riere show that such proximity of possible 
volcanic action may be a source of great danger, although even the 
destruction by them does not certainly indicate damage either to 
navigation or to canal structures at the distance of 11 miles. What- 
ever volcanic danger may exist lies on the Nicaragua route, for there 
is no volcano nearer than 175 miles to the Panama route. 

* * * There is a wide-spread, popular impression that the Cen- 
tral American countries are necessarily intensely unhealthful. This 
is an error, in spite of the facts that the construction of the Panama 
Railroad was attended with an appalling amount of sickness and loss 
of life, and that records of man}^ epidemics at other times and in other 
places exist in nearly all of these countries. There are the best of 
good reasons to believe that with the enforcement of sanitar}" regula- 
tions, which are now well understood and completely available," the 
Central American countries would be as healthful as our Southern 
States. A proper recognition of hygienic conditions of life suitable 
to a tropical climate would work wonders in Central America in reduc- 
ing the death rate. At the present tim(> the domestic administration 
of most of the cities and towns of Nicaragua and Panama, as w(41 as 
the generality of Central American cities, is characterized by the 
absence of practically everything which makes for public health, and 
by the presence of nearly every agency working for the diseases which 
fl^oui'ish in tropical climates. When the United States Government 
reaches the point of actual construction of an isthmian canal the sani- 
tary features of that work should l)e administered and enforced in 
cyery detail with the rigor oi" the most exacting military discipline. 



THE PANAMA ROUTE FOR A SHIP CANAL. 557 

Under such conditioiw, epideniict^ could either l>e avoided or reduced 
to manageuble dimensions, but not otherwise. * * * 

The time required for passing' through a transisthmian canal is 
affected by the length, ])y the numl)er of locks, by the number of 
curves, and by the sharpness of curvature. The speed of a ship, and 
consequently the time of passage, is also affected ])y the depth of 
water under its keel. It is well known that the same power applied 
to a ship in deep Avater of unlimited width will produce a nuich higher 
rate of movement than the same i)ower applied to the same ship in a 
restricted waterway, especially when the draft of the ship is but little 
less than the depth of water. Tlies(^ considerations have important 
bearings both upon the dimcMisions of a ship canal and upon the time 
required to pass through it. They were most carefully considered l)y 
the Connnission, as were also such other niatters as the delay incurred 
in passing through the locks on each line, the latter including the dela}^ 
of slowing or approaching the lock and of increasing speed after pass- 
ing it, the time of opening and closing the gates, and the time of 
emptying and tilling the locks. It is also evident that ships of various 
sizes will require different times for their passage. After giving due 
weight to all these considerations it was found that what may I )e called 
an average ship would require twelve hours for passing through the 
Panama Canal. * * * 

The prospective industrial and commercial value of the canal also 
occupied the attention of the Conmiission in a l)road and careful study 
of the elements which enter that part of the prol)lem. It is difficult if 
not impossible to predict just what the effect of a transisthmian canal 
would be either upon the ocean commerce of the United States or of 
other parts of the world, but it seems reasonable to suppose from the 
result of the Commission's examinations that had the canal been in 
existence in 1890 at least 5,000,000 tons of the actual traffic of that 
year would have been accommodated ]>v it. The opening of such a 
watiM'way, like the opening of all other traffic routes, induces the 
creation of new trathc to an extent that can not be estimated, Ijut it 
would appear to ])e' reasonable to suppose that within ten years from 
the date of its opening the vessel tonnage using it would not be less 
than 10,(»UO,0(»0 tons. * * * 

The effect of this ship waterway upon the well-being of the Ihiited 
States is not altogether of a commercial character. As indicated by 
the Commission, this additional bond ])etvveen the two portions of the 
country will have a beneffcial effect upon the unitv of the political 
interests as well as upon the commercial welfare of the country. 
Indeed it is the judgment of many well-informed people that the com- 
mercial advantages resulting from a closer touch l)etween the Atlantic 
and Pacific coasts of the country are of less consequence than the 
unifying of political interests. 



THE PROBLEMS OF HEREDITY AND TIH^Hi SOLUTION/' 



By W. Bateson, M. A., F. R. S. 



An exact detoriiiination of the laws of hci'cdit}' will probably work 
more change in man's outlook on the world and in his power over 
nature than any other advance in natural knowledge that can be 
clearly foreseen. 

There is no doubt whatever that these laws ean l)e determined. In 
comparison with the la])or that has l)een needed for other great discov- 
eries we may even expect that the necessary etiort will be small. It is 
rather remarkable that while in other branches of physiology such great 
progress has of late been made, our knowledge of the phenomena of 
heredity has increased but little; though that these phenomena consti- 
tute the basis of !ill evolutionary science and the very central problem 
of natural histoiy is admitted by all. Nor is this due to the special 
ditficulty of such inquiries so much as to general neglect of the subject. 

It is in the hope of indu'-ing- others to follow these lines of investi- 
gation that I take the prol)lems of heredity as the subject of this lec- 
ture to the Royal Horticultural Society. 

No one has better opportunities of pursuing such work than iiorti- 
culturists and stock breeders. They are daily witnesses of the phe- 
nomena of heredity. Their success also depends largely on a 
knowledge of its laws, and obviously every increase in that knowledge 
is of direct and special importance to them. 

The want of systematic study of heredity is due chiefly to misappre- 
hension. It is supposed that such- work requires a lifetime. But 
though for adequate study of the complex phenomcMia of iidieritance 
long periods of time must be necessary, yet in our present state of

5G0 THE PROBLEMS OF HEREDITY AND THEIR SOLUTION. 

deep ignorance tilmcst of the outline of the facts, observations care- 
fully planned and faithfully carried out for ev^eu a few3a^ars ma}' pro- 
duce results of great value. In fact, by far the most appreciable and 
definite additions to our knowledge of these matters have been thus 
obtained. 

There is besides some misapprehension as to the kind of knowledge 
which is especialh'^ wanted at this time, and as to the modes ])y which 
we ma}' expect to obtain it. The present paper is written in the hope 
that it may in some degree help to clear the ground of these difficul- 
ties by a preliminary consideration of the question, How far have we 
got toward an exact knowledge of heredity, and how can we get 
farther 'i 

Now, this is preeminently a subject in which we must distinguish 
what we can do from what we want to do. We want to know the 
whole truth of the matter; we want to know the physical Ijasis, the 
inward and essential nature, "the causes," as they are sometimes 
called, of heredity; but we want also to know the laws which the out- 
ward and visible phenomena obey. 

Let us recognize from the outset that as to the essential nature of 
these phenomena we still know absolutely nothing. We have no 
glimmering of an idea as to what constitutes the essential process by 
which the likeness of the parent is transmitted to the offspring. AVe 
can study the processes of fertilization and development in the finest 
detail which the microscope manifests to us, and we may fairly say 
that we have now a considerable grasp of the visible phenomena; ])ut 
of the nature of the physical basis of heredity we have no conception 
at all. No one has yet any suggestion, working hypothesis, or mental 
picture that has thus far helped in the slightest degree to penetrate 
beyond what we see. The process is as utterly mysterious to us as a 
flash of lightning is to a savage. We do not know what is the essen- 
tial agent in the transmission of parental characters, not even whether 
it is a material agent or not. Not only is our ignorance complete, but 
no one has the remotest idea how to set to work on that part of the 
problem. We are in the state in which the students of physical science 
were in the period when it Avas open to anyone to believe that heat 
was a material substance or not, as he chose. 

But apart from any conception of the essential modes of transmis- 
sion of characters, we can study the outward facts of the transmission. 
Here, if our knowledge is still very vague, we are at least beginning 
to see how we ought to go to work. Formerly, naturalists were con- 
tent with the collection of numbers of isolated instances of transmis- 
sion — more especially, striking and peculiar cases — the sudden appear- 
ance of highly prepotent forms, and the like. We are now passing 
out of that stage. It is not that the interest of particular cases has in 
any way diminished^ — for such records will always have their value —

but it has lKM't)in(' likely that o('noral oxpivssions will tx^ t'ouiKl capable 
of sulHciently wide application to be justly called "laws'' of heredity. 
That this is so was till recently due almost entirely to the work of 
Mr. F. (Talton. to whom we nvo indebti^d for th(^ tirst systematic 
attem})t to enunciate such a law. 

All laws of heredity so far propounded ai'e of a statistical character 
and have been obtained by statistical methods. If we consider for a 
moment what is actually meant by a "law of heredity" we shall see 
at once w hy these investigations nuist follow statistical methods. For 
a "law" of heredity is simply an attempt to declare the course of 
heredity under given conditions. But if we attempt to pnxlicate the 
course of heredity w(^ have to deal with conditions and groups of causes 
wholly unknown to us, whose presence we can not recognize, and 
whose magnitude we can not estimate in any particular case. The 
course of hei'edity in particular cases therefore can not be foreseen. 

Of the many factors which determine the degree to which a given 
character shall be present in a given individual only one is usually 
known to us, namely, the degree to which that character is present in 
the parents. It is connnon knowdedge that thiu'e is not that close cor- 
respondence between parent and oti'spring which would r(\sult were 
this factor the only one operating; but that, on the contrary, the 
resemblance between the two is oidy an uncertain one. 

Ill dealing with phenomena of this class the stud\' of single instances 
r(>\ cals no regularity. It is only by collection of facts in great num- 
bei-s, and by statistical treatment of the mass, tliat an}' order or law 
can be percei\'ed. In the case of a chemical reaction, for instance, l)y 
suitable means the conditions can be accurately reproduced, so that in 
every individual case we can predict with centainty that the same 
result will occur. But with heredity it is somewhat as it is in the case 
of the rainfall. No one can say how nmch rain will fall to-morrow in 
a given place, but we can jiredict with moderate accuracy how much 
will fall next year, and for a period of yeai's a prediction can Ix^ made 
which accords v(>ry closely with the truth. 

Similar predictions can from statistical data be made as to the dura- 
tion of life and a great variidy of events, the conditioning causes of 
which are very imperfectly undei'stood. It is predictions of this kind 
that th(^ study of heredity is beginning to make possilile, and in that 
sense hiws of hcu'edity can be perceived. 

We are as far as ever from knowing w liy some characters are trans- 
mitted, while others are not; nor can anyone yet foretell which indi- 
vidual parent will transmit characters to the oflspring and Avhich will 
not; nevertheless the progress made is distinct. 

As yet investigations of this kind ha\(^ Ikhmi made in Only a fc^v 
instances, the most notable being those of Galton on human stature

and on the tran.siiiisfsion of colors in Basset hounds. In racli of these 
cases he has shown that the expectation of inheritance is such that a 
simple arithmetical rule is approximatel}' followed. The rule thus 
arrived at is that of the Avhole heritage of the ofi'sprino- the twx) parents 
tot^ether, on an avei'a^-e, contribute one-half, the four tiiand parents 
one-fourth, the eight great grand parents one-eighth, and so on, the 
remainder l)eing eontri})uted by the remoter ancestors. 

Such a law is obviously of practical importance. In any case to 
which it applies we ought thus to be able to predict the degree with 
which the purity of a strain may be increased by selection in each 
successive generation. 

To take a perhaps impossibly crude example, if a seedling show any 
particidar character W'hich it is desired to tix, on the assumption that 
successive self-fertilizations are possible, according to Galton's law 
the expectation of purity should be in the first generation of self- 
fertilization 1 in "2, in the second generation ?> in 4. in th(> third 7 in 8, 
and so on." 

But already many cases are known to which the rule in any simple 
form will not apply, (lalton points out that it takes no account of 
individual prepotencies. There are, besides, numerous cases in which 
on crossing two varieties the character of one variety almost always 
appears in each member of the tirst crossbred generation. Examples 
of these will be familiar to those who have experience in such matters. 
The oti'spring of the Polled Angus cow and the Shorthorn bull is 
almost invarial)ly polled or with very small loose "scurs.'"' Seedlings 
raised by crossing Airopa Ix^lhuJonua with the 3'ellow-fruited variety 
have without exception th(» blackish-purple fruits of th(» type. In 
several hairy species, when a cross with a glabrous variety is made, 
the tirst crossbred generation is altogether hairy.''' 

Still more numerous are examples in which th(> characters of one 
variety very largely, though not exclusiAely. predominate in the 
offspj-ing. 

These large classes of exceptions — to go no further — indicate that, 
as we might in any case expect, the principle is not of unixcrsal ai)pli- 
cation, and will need various modihcations if it is to be extended to 
more complex cases of inheritance of varietal characters. No more 
useful woi-k can Ix^ imagined than a systematic determination of the 
precise ''law of luM'edity'^ in numlxM-s of particular cases. 

Until lateh' the work which (Jallon accomplished stood almost alone 
in this lield, but ((uit(> recently r(>markable additions to our knoAvledgc 
of these questions have been made. In the year 1900, Professor de Vries

|)ut)lisli(Ml ;i ])riet' account" of experiincnts which he lias for several 
years been carrying on,- giving' results of the highest value. . 

The description is A'er3',>short, and there are several points as to which 
more precise information is necessary, both as to details of procedure 
and as to statement of results. Nevertheless, it is impossil)le to dou])t 
that the work as a whole constitutes a marked step forward, and the full 
})ublication which is promised will ])e awaited with great interest. 

The work ndates to the course of heredity in cases where dotinite 
varieties ditiering fi'om each other in some one detinite character are 
crossed together. The cases are all examples of discontimious varia- 
tion — that is to say. cas(>s in which actual intermediates l)etween the 
parent forms are iiot usually produced on crossing.'' It is shown that 
the subsequent posterity ol)tained ]}y self -fertilizing these crossbreds 
or hyl)rids, or by breeding them with each other, break up into the 
original i)arent fornis according to fixed numerical rule. 

Professor de Vries begins by reference to a remarkable miMuoir by 
(iregor ^lendel.' giving the results of his experiments in crossing 
varieties of /Vsv//// s(/f//u///i. These experiments of MendeFswere car- 
ried out on a large scale, his account of them is excellent and complete, 
and the })rinciples which he was a})le to deduce from them will cer- 
tainly play a conspicuous })art in all future discussions of evolutionary 
])r<)hlems. It is not a little remarka])le that MendeFs work should 
have escaped notice and been so long forgotten. 

For the purposes of his experiments Mendel selected seven ])airs of 
characters, as follows: 

1. Shape of ripe seed, whether round or angular and wrinkled. 

2. Color of ' ' endosperm " (coty ledonsj, whether some shade of yellow 
or a more or less intense green. 

3. Color of the seed skin, whether various shades of gray and gray- 
brown or white. 

4. Shape of seed pod, whether simply inHattnl oi- deeply constricted 
l)etween the seeds. 

5. Color of unripe jxhI, whether a shade of green or hi'ight yellow. 
(>. Nature of inflorescence, whether the flowers are arranged along 

the axis of the plant or nvv terminal and form a kind of uml)el. 

7. Length of stem, whether al)out <> or 7 feet long or about three- 
fourths to li feet. 

Large numbers of crosses were made between pease ditiering in 
respect of one of each of th(\se paii's of characters. It was found that 
in each case the otfspring of the cross exhi])ited the character of one of 
the parents in almost undiminished intensity, and intermediates which

could not he at once referred to one or otlierol' th(^ parental tonus were 
not found. 

In the case of each pair of characters there is thus one which in the 
first cross prevails to the exchision of the other. This prevailing 
character Mendel calls the dominant cliaiactiM-, the other heino- the 
recessive character." 

That the existence of such •"dominant" and *' r(>cessiv(> " characters 
is a frequent i^henomenon in cross hi-eedin*^-, is well known to all who 
have attended to these subjects. 

By letting the crossbreds fertilize themselves Mendel next raised 
another generation. In this generation were individuals which showed 
the dominant character, but also individuals which presented the 
recessiv(> character. Such ii fact also was known in a good many 
instances. Rut Mendel discovered that in this generation the numer- 
ical pi'opoi'tion of dominants to recessives is on an average of cases 
a])proximately constant, l)eing in fact as three to one. AN'ith very 
considerable regularit}' these numbers were ap})r()ached in the case of 
each of his pairs of chai'acters. 

There are thus in the first generation raised from the crosshi'cds 75 
per cent dominants and 25 per cent recessives. 

These plants were again self-fertilized, and the offspring of each 
plant separately sown. It next appeai'cd that the ofl'sjning of the 
recessives remained pu,re recessive, and in subse(|uent genei-ations 
never produced the dominant again. 

But Avh(Mi the seeds obtained ])y self-f(M-tilizing the dominants were 
examinetl and sown it was found that the dominants were not ail alike, 
but consisted of two classes, (1) those which gav(> rise to pui(> domi- 
nants, and (2) others which gave a mixed otfspring, compos(>d ])artly 
of recessives, ])artly of dominants. Here also it was found that the 
average mun(M-ical proportions were* constant, those with pui-e domi- 
nant oH'spring being to those with mixed oll'spring as one to two. 
Hence it is seen that the 75 per cent dominants ar(» not really of simi- 
lar constitution, but consist of twenty-tive which nvv \m\v dominants 
and fifty which are really crossbreds, though, like the cr<)ssl)r(Hls raised 
by crossing th(^ two original varieties, they only exhibit the dominant 
character. 

To resume, then, it was found that by self-fertilizing the original 
crossbreds the same proportion was always ai)i)roached, namely, 25 
dominants, 50 crossbreds, 25 recessives, or l/> : 2/>7? : 1^. 

Like the pure recessives, the pure dominants are thencefortli i)ui'e, 
and only give rise to dominants in all succeeding generations studied. 

On the contrary the fifty crossbreds, as stated al)ove, ha\-e mixed 
oflspring. But these otl'spring, again, in their muuerical proportions,

5Gr) THE PROBLEMS OP HEREDITY AND THEIR SOLUTION. 

The details of these experiments and of others like them mad(> with 
three pairs of dilferentiating characters are all set out in Mendel's 
memoir. 

Professor de Vries has worked at the same problem in some dozen 
species belonging to several genera, using pairs of varieties charac- 
terized by a great num])er of chai'acters: for instance, color of Howers, 
stems, or fruits, hairiness, length of style, and so forth. He states 
that in all these cases Mend(d's principles are followed. 

The iuiml)ers with which Mendel worked, though large, were not 
large enough to give really smooth results;" but with a few rather 
marked exceptions the observations are remarkably consistent, and 
the approximation to the numbers demanded by the law is greatest in 
those cases where the largest numbers were used. When we consider, 
l^esides, that Tschermak and Correns announce detinite contirmation 
in the case of PiHum^ and de Vries adds the evidence of his long series 
of observations on other species and orders, there can be no doubt that 
Mendel's law is a substantial reality; though whether some of the 
cases that depart most widely from it can be brought within the terms of 
the same principle or not, can only be decided by further experiments. 

One may naturally ask, How can these results be brought into hai'- 
mony with the facts of hybridization hitherto known; and if all this is 
true, how is it that others who have carefully studied the phenomena 
of hybridization have not long ago perceived this law? The answer 
to this question is given by Mendel at some length, and it is, I think, 
satisfactor3\ He admits from the first that there are undoul)tedly 
cases of hybrids and cross-breds which maintain themselves pure and 
do not break up. Such examples ai'e plainly outside the scope of his 
law. Next he points out, what to anyone who has rightly compre- 
hended the nature of discontinuity in variation is well known, that the 
variations in each character must be separately regarded. In most 
experiments in crossing, forms are taken which diiier from each other 
in a multitude of cli:iracters — some continuous, others discontinuous, 
some capaljle of blending with their contraries, while others are not. 
The observer on attempting to perceive any regularity is confused by 
the complications thus introduced. INIenders law, as he fairly says, 
could only appear in such cases by tli(^ use of overwhelming num])ers, 
which arc beyond the possibilities of practical experiment. Lastly, no 
previous observer had applied a strict statistical jnethod. 

Both these answers should be acceptable to those Avho have studied 
the facts of variation and have appreciated the naturt^ of species in the 
light of those facts. That dili'erent species should follow different 

" ProfeHsoi- Woklou (p. 232) takes great exception to this statement, ■\vhicli he 
considerately attributes to "some writers." After examining the conchisions he

laws !uk1 thut tho same Lnv should not apply to all characters alike i.s 
exactly Avhat we have every right to expect. It will also ])o reinem- 
])ere(l that the principle is only explicitly declared to apply to discon- 
tinuous characters." As stated also, it can only l)e true where 
reciprocal crossings lead to the same result. Moreover, it can oidy he 
tested when thei'e is no scMisiblt^ diminution in fertility on crossing. 

I'^pon lh(^ appearance of de \'ries's paper announcing Ihe •"redis- 
covery" and conlii'mation of ^lendeFs law and its extension to a great 
numl)er of cases, two other observers came forward almost sinudtane- 
ously and indi^pendently described series of exp(M"iments fully conlirm- 
ing Mendel's work. Of these pap(n's th(^ iirst is that of Correns, who 
repeated Mendel's original experiment with pease having seeds of dif- 
ferent colors. The second is a long and \ery \alu;d)le memoir of 
Tschermak, Avhich gives an account of elaborate researches into the 
results of crossing a number of varieties of Pi^urn xiitiruin. These 
experiments were in many cases carried out on a large scale, and prove 
the main fact emmciated ))v Mendel bevond an}' possibility of con- 
tradiction. The more exhaustive of these researches are those of 
Tsch(n-mak on peas and correns on several varieties of mai/e. lk)th 
these elaborate investigations have abundantly pro\'ed the general 
applicability of Mendel's law to the chai'acter of the plants studied, 
though both indicate some few exceptions. Th(> details of de Vries's 
experiments are promised in the second \olume of his most \'aluable 
JfutattonxfJiro/'!, . Corrims in regard to maize and Tschermak in the 
case of ]\ x(it!rHiii have obtained further proof that Mendel's law 
holds as well in the case of varieties ditt'ering from each other in two 
pairs of characters, one of each pair being donnnant, though of course 
a more complicated expression is needed in such cases.'' 

That we are in the })res(Mice of a new principle of the highest impor- 
tance is manifest. To v;hat further conclusions it may lead us can not 
yet be foretold. But ])()th IVIendel and the authors who ]ia\(' followed 
him lay stress on one conclusion, which will at once suggest itself to 
anyone who reliects on the facts. For it will be seen that the results 
are sucli as we might expect if it be imagined that th(^ cross-bred plant 
produced pollen grains and egg cells, each t)f which bears only one of 
the alternative varietal characters and not both. If this were so, and 
if on an average the same i\und)er of pollen grains and Q\f;\y cells trans- 
mit each of the two characters, it is clear that on a random assortment 
of ^pollen grains and Qg^ cells Mendel's law would l)e obeyed. For 25 
per cent of ''dominant" pollen grains would unite with 25 per cent

568 THE PROBLEMS OF HEREDITY AND THEIR SOLUTION. 

"dominant''' egg' colls; ^6 per cent " reces.sivo" pollen grains would 
similarly unite with 25 per cent "recessive'' eg-g- cells; while the 
remaining' 50 per cent of each kind would unite together. It is this 
consideration which leads both Mendel and those who have followed 
him to assert that these facts of crossing prove that each egg cell and 
each pollen g'rain is pure in respect of each character to which the law 
applies. It is highly desirable that varieties ditiering in the form of 
their pollen should l)e made the subject of these experiments, for it is 
quite possi])le that in such a case strong conlirmation of this deduction 
might be obtained. [Preliminary trials made with reference to this 
point have so far given negative results. Remeiubering that a pollen 
grain is not a germ cell, but only a bearer of a germ cell, the hope of 
seeing pollen grains differentiated according to the characters they 
bear is probably remote. Better hopes may perhaps be entertained 
in regard to spermatozoa, or possibly female cells.] 

As an objection to the deduction of purity of germ cells, however, 
it is to be noted that though true intermediates did not generally occur, 
yet the intensity in which the characters a})peared did vary in degree, 
and it is not easy to see how the hypothesis of perfect purit}^ in the 
reproductive cells can ])e supported in such cas(^s. Be this, however, 
as it may, there is no doubt we are beginning to get new lights of a 
most valuable kind on the nature of heredity and the laws which it 
obeys. It is to be hoped that these indications will be at once followed 
up by independent workers. Enough has been said to show how 
necessary it is that the subjects of experiment should be chosen in such 
a way as to bring the laws of heredity to a real test. For this pur- 
pose the tirst essential is that the differentiating characters should be 
few, and that all avoidable complications should be got rid of. Each 
experiment should be reduced to its simplest possible limits. The 
results obtained by (ialton, and also the new ones especially described 
in this paper, have each l)een i-eached by restricting the i-ange of 
observation to one character or groUp of characters, and it is certain 
that by similar treatment our knowledge of heredity may be rapidly 
extended. 

To the above popular presentation of the essential facts, made for 
an audience not strictly scientiffc, some addition, however l)ri(>f. is 
called for. First, in regard to the law of ancestry, spoken of on a 
preceding pag(^ Those who are acquainted with Pearson's Gi'ammar 
of Science, second edition, published early in 1900, the same author's. 
paper in Proceedings Royal Society, volume Q6, 1800, page l-tO, or the 
extensive memoir (published October. IHOO), on the inheritance of 
coat color in horses and e3'e color in man (Phil. Trans., 11)5, A, 1900,, 
p. 79), will not need to be told that the few words I have given above 
constitute a most impcn-fcct diagram of the operations of that law as 
now developed. Until the appearance of these treatises it was, 1

believe, oc'iH'r;illy coiisidered that the law of aiiceslral heredity was 
to he taken as :i[)plyiiijj- to phciioineiia like these (coat eolor, eye color, 
etc.) where the inheritance is i;-enerully alternative, as well as to the 
phenomena of blended iidieritance. 

Pearson, in the writings referred to, besides withdrawino- other 
large cateo-ories of phenomena from the scope of its operations, points 
out that the law of ancestral heredity does not satisfactoi'ily express 
the cases of alternati\'e inheritance. He urges, and with reason, that 
these class(\s of jjhenomena should be separately dealt with. 

The whole issu*^ as regai'ds the various possibilities of heredity now 
recognized will be made clearer l)v a \ ei'v brief exposition of the 
several conceptions involved. 

If an organism [)roduciiig germ-cells of a given constitution, 
uniform in resp(H't of the charactei's they bear, breeds with another 
organism " hearing pi-ecisely similar gei-m-cells. the otfs})ring resulting 
will, if th(> conditions are identical, he uniform. 

In i^ractice such a j)henomenon is seen In pure breeding. It is true 
that we know no case in natur(^, where all the germ-cells are thus 
identical, and where no variation takes place l)eyond what we can 
attribute to conditions, l)ut we know many cases where such a result 
is appioached, and v(U'v many where all the essential features which 
we regard as ct)nstituting the characters of the breed are reproduced 
with approximatt^ certainty in every member of the pure-bred race, 
wdiich thus clos(dy api)r()ach to uniformity. 

But if two germ-cells of dissimilar constitution unite in fertilization, 
what oifspi'ing are we to expect^'' First let us premise that the 
answer to this question is known experimentally to differ for many 
organisms and for many classes of characters, and may almost cer- 
tainly he in part determined by external circumstances. But omitting 
the last (lualitication, certain j)rinciples are now tdearly detected, 
though what principh^ will apply in any given case can only be 
determined hy direct experiment made with that case. 

This is th(^ plHMiomenon of cross breeding. As generally used, this 
tei'm means th(^ union of nuMubcrs of dissimilar vai'ieties, or species; 
though when dissimilar gametes'' produced hy two individuals of the 
same variety unite in fertilization, we have essentially cross breeding 
in res|)ect of the character oi' characters in which tliost^ gametes 
diii'er. We will suppose, as before, that these two gametes bearing 

a For gimj)lic'ity the case of .self-fertilization is omitted from this consideration. 

& In all the cases discussed it is assumed that the "jametes are similar except in 
regard to the "heritage" they l)ear, and that no original variation is taking place. 
The case of mosaics is also left wholly out of account (see later). 

''The term "gamete" is now generally used as the e(|uivalent of "germ-eell," 
whether male or female, and the term " zygote " is here used for brevity to denote 
the organism resulting from fertilization. 



5<0 THE PROBLEMS OF HEREDITY AND THEIR .SOLITTTON. 

properties unlike in respect of a given character are borne ny 
different individuals. 

In the simplest case, suppose^ a gamete from an individual present- 
ing any character in intensity .1 unite in fertilization with another 
from an individual presenting the same character in intensity </. For 
brevity's sake we may call the parent individuals A and ^/ and the 
resulting zygote Ao. What will the structure of ^\(f be in rc^gai'd to 
the character we are considering!' 

l^p to Mendel no one proposed to answer this question in any other 
way than by reference to the intensity of the character in the pi'ogen- 
itors and primarily in the parents, A and c/, in whose l)odies the 
gametes had been developed. It was well known that such a refer- 
ence gave a very poor indication of what Aa would l)e. Both A and 
a may come from a population consisting of individuals manifesting 
the same character in various intensities. In the pedigree of either A 
or a these various intensities may have occurred few or many times. 
Common experience leads us to expect the probability in regard to 
Aa to be influenced by this histor3^ The next step is that which 
Galton took. He extended the reference beyond the immediate par- 
ents of Aa to its grandparents, great-grandparents, and so on, and in 
the cases he studied he found that from a knowledge of the intensity 
in which the given character was manifested in each progenitor, even 
for some few generations back, a fairly accurate prediction could be 
made, not as to the character of any individual Aa, but as to the aver- 
age character of ^l^'s of similar parentage in general. 

I^ut suppose that instead of individuals presenting one character in 
differing intensities, two individuals breed together, distinguished by 
characters which we know to be mutually exclusive, such as ^1 and Jj. 
Here again we may speak of the individuals producing the gametes as 
A and B and the resulting zygote as ^i/>. What will AB be like? 
The population here again may consist of many like ^1 and like £. 
These two forms ma}' have been breeding together indiscriminately, 
and there may have been many or few of either type in the pedigree 
of either A or I). 

Here again (lalton applied iiis method with remarkalile success. 
Referring to the progenitors of A and />. detiM-niining how many of 
each type there were in the direct pedigree of ^1 and of B, he arrived 
at the same formula as ))efore, with the simple difference that instead 
of expressing the ^irobable average intensity of one character in sev- 
eral individuals, the prediction is given in terms of the prol)able mmi- 
))er of ^Ts and ^'s that would result on an average Avhen partieuhir 
^I's and B'h of known pedigree breed together. 

The law as Galton gives it is as follows: 

"It is that tiie two parents conti'ibute l)etweeii iheiii on tlie average 



THE PKOBLEMf^ OV HEREDITY AND THEIR SOLirTION. 571 

one-hiilf or (O.f)) of tho total boritag'e of the otfspriiio-; the four o-rand- 
parents, one quarter or (»».5)''; the eight oroat-grandparents, one- 
eighth or (0.5)^ and so on. Then the sum of the ancestral 
contrilnitions is expressed by the series 

{((l.5) + ((l.5f + (().5f, etr.}, 

whicii. being equal to 1. accounts for the whole hei'itage." 

In the former case where ^1 and (/ are characters which can be denoted 
by reference to a conuuon scale, the law assumes of course that the 
inheritance Tvill be. to use (lalton's term, blended; namely, that the 
zygote resulting from the union of ^1 with (f will on the average be 
more like (f than if J had been united y^'ith A; and, conversely, that 
an ^[(( zygote will on the average l)e more like .1 than an (h/ zygote 
would be. 

But in the case of A's and i>\s, which are assumed to be mutuall}' 
exclusive characters, we can not speak of blending, l)ut rather, to use 
Galton's term, of alternative inheritance. 

Pearson, finding that the law, whether formidated thus or in the 
moditied form in which he restated it," did not express the phenomena 
of alternative inheritance known to him with sufticient accuracy to 
justify its strict application to them, and also on general grounds pro- 
posed tliat the phenomena of blended and alternative inheritance 
should l)e treated apart — a suggestion'' thc> wisdom of which can 
scarcely be questioned. 

Now the law thus imperfectly set forth and every modification of it 
is incomplete in one respect. It deals only with the characters of the 
resulting zygotes and predicates nothing in regard to the gametes 
which go to form them. A good prediction may be mad(^ as to any 
given g'roup of zygotes, but the various possible constitutions of the 
gametes are not explicitly treated. 

Nevertheless a definite assumption is implicitly madi^ regarding the 
gametes. It is not in question that diflerences l)etween these gametes 
may occur in respect of the heritage they bear, yet it is as-umed that 
these differences will be distributed among the gametes of any indi- 
vidual zygote in such a way that each gamete remains capal)le on fer- 
tilization of transmitting all the characters (both of the parent zygote 
and of its progenitors) to the zygote which it then contrilmtes to form 
(and to the posterity of that zygote) in the intensity indicated l)y the 
law. Hence, the gametes of any individual are taken as collectively a 
fair sample of all the racial characters in their appropriate intensities, 
and this theory demands that there shall have ])een no qualitative 
redistribution of characters among the gametes of any zygote in such

;i wav that some yainotes shall he liiially cxcliuled from partakiti*^- of 
and traiisiiiittiny- any specitic psirt of the lu^ritaj^e. The theory further 
demands and by the analogy of what we knoAV otherwise not only of 
animals and plants, but of physical or chemical laws, perhaps this is 
the most serious assumption of all — that the structure of the gametes 
shall admit of their being capable of transmitting any character in any 
intensity varjang from zero to totality with equal ease, and that 
gametes of each intensity are all e([ually likely to occur, given a pedi- 
gree of appropriate arithmetical composition. 

Such an assumption appears so improbable that even in cases where 
the facts seem as yet to point to this conclusion with exceptional clear- 
ness, as in the case of human stature, I can not but feel there is still 
room for reserve of judg-ment. 

However this may l)e, the law of ancestral heredit}- and all modifi- 
cations of it yet proposed falls short in the respect specified above — 
that it does not directly attempt to give any account of the distribution 
of the heritage among the gametes of any one individual. 

Menders conception differs fundamentally from that iuAolved in the 
lavr of ancestral heredity. The relation of his h3^pothesis to the fore- 
going may be most easily shown if we consider it first in application 
to the phenomena resulting from the cross breeding of two pure 
varieties. 

Let us again consider the case of two varieties, each displaying the 
same character, but in the respective intensities A and (/. Each gamete 
of the A variety bears A, and each gamete of the a variety bears a. 
When thoy unite in fertilization they form the zygote Aa. What will 
be its characters!' The Mendel ian teaching would reply that this can 
only be known by direct experiment with the two forms ^1 and //, and 
that the charactei's ^1 and a perceived in those two forms or vari(>ties 
need not give an}^ indication as to the character of the zygote Aa. It 
may displa}' the character ^1 or </ or a character halfwav between the 
two, or a character beyond A or })elow </. The charactei* of Aa is 
not regarded as a heritage transmitted to it by A and by a, but as a 
character special and peculiar to At/, just as NaCl is not a body half- 
way between sodium and chlorine, or such that its properties can l»e 
predicted from or easily stated in terms of theirs. 

If a concrete case may help, a tall pea A crossed with a dwarf (/ often 
produces not a plant having the height of either A or </, but some- 
thing taller than the pure tall variety ^1. 

But if the case obeys the Mendel ian piinciples — as does that here 
quoted — then it can be declared, first, that the gametes of Aa will not 
be bearers of the character proper to A(// but, generally sj^eaking, 
each ganu^e ^v'ill eitlu^r bear the pui'e .1 character or the }>ure a char- 
acter. There will in fact be a redisti'ibution of the characters brought 
in by the gamet(\s which united to form the zygote Aa, such that each 
gamete of Aa is pure, as the parental gametes were. Secondly, this

redistrilnition will uccur in such :i way that of the li-aiiictes j)r<)(lucod 
b}^ such ^I^^s, on an average ihoro will ])e e(iual miinlxn-s of .1 o'ainete.s 
and of a g-ametes. 

Consequent!}' if Acrs breed together, the ikmv .1 ganietes niav meet 
each other in fertilization, forming a zygote ^1^1, namely, the pure ^1 
variety again. Similarly two </ gametes may meet and form aa^ or the 
pure (f variety again. But if an ^1 gamete meets an </, it will once 
more form At(^ with its special character. This Aa is the hybrid or 
"mule'' form, or, as I have elsewhere called it, the heterozygote, a« 
distinguished fi'om A^l or (/(f the homozygotes. 

Similarlv if the two gametes of two varieties distinguished l)v char- 
acters A and /). which can not be described in tin-ms of any com- 
mon scale — such as, for example, the '"rost^" and "" single" combs of 
fowls — imite in fertilization, again the character of the nude form can 
not l)e predicted. Before the experiment is made the •'nud(^" may 
present any form. Its character or properties can as yet l)e no more 
predicted than could those of the compounds of unknown (diMuents 
before the discovery of the periodic law. 

But again — if the case be Mendelian — the gametes ])orne ])y AB will 
be either ^I's or ^'s," and the cross-bred .l/>'s breeding together will 
form viol's, ^UTh, and BB\. Moreover, if, as in the normal Mende- 
lian case, AB\ bear on an tiverage e(pial numbers of ^1 gametes and 
B gametes, the munerical ratio of these resulting zygotes to each 
other w ill be 

l.Ll :!^.l/; : 1 BB. 

We have seen that Mendel makes no prediction as to the outward 
and \ isible characters of ^Itj, but only as to the essential constitution 
and statistical condition of its gametes in regard to the characters A 
and B. Ne\ertheless in a large luimber of cases the character of AB 
is known to fall into one of three categories (omitting mosaics). 

(1) The cross-l)red may almost alw^ays resemble one of its pure par- 
ents so closely as to be i^ractically indistinguishable from that pure 
form, as in the case of the yellow cotyledon-color of certain varieties 
of peas when crossed with green-cotyledoned varieties; in w Inch case 
the parental chara»-ter, yellow, thus manifested by the cross bred is 
called "dominant," and the parental character, green, not manifested, 
is called recessi\(\ 

(2) The crossbred may present some condition interU'cdiate between 
the two parental forms, in which case we may still retain the term 
"blend" as applied to the zygote. 

Such an '* intermediate" may ])e the appariMit mean betwecMi the two 
parental forms, or be nearer to one or other in any degree. Such a 

«ThiH conception was clearly formed by Nandin sinuiltaneously with Mendel, but 
it was not wor]«Mt out by him and remained a mere suggestion. In one jilace also 
Focke came very near to the same idea. (See Bibliography. ) 



574 THE PROBLEMS OF HEREDITY AND THEIR SOLUTION. 

case is that of a cross between a rich crimson magenta Chinese prim- 
rose and a clear white, giving- a flower of a color appropriately 
described as a " washy" magenta. 

(3) The crossbred may present some form (juite different from that of 
either pure parent. Thougli, as has been stated, nothing can be pre- 
dicted of an unlvnown case, we already know a considerable nmnber 
of examples of this nature in which the nuile form approaches some- 
times with great accuracy to that of a putative ancestor, near or 
remote. It is scarcely possible to doubt that several — though perhaps 
not all — of Darwin's "reversions on crossing" were of this nature. 

Such a case is that of the "wild gray mouse" produced by the 
union of an albino tame mouse and a piebald Japanese mouse." 
These "reversionary" mice bred together produce the parental tame 
types, some other types, and "reversionary" mice again. 

From what has lieen said it will now be clear that the applicability 
of the Mendelian hypothesis has, intrinsically, nothing whatever to 
do with the question of the inheritance being blended or alternative. 
In fact, as soon as the relation of zygote characters to gamete charac- 
ters is appreciated, it is difficult to see any reason for supposing that 
the manifestation of characters seen in the z3"gotes should give any 
indication as to their mode of allotment among the gametes. 

On a previous occasion I pointed out that the terms "heredity" 
and "inheritance" are founded on a misapplication of metaphor, and 
in the light of our present knowledge it is becoming clearer that the 
ideas of "transmission" of a character by parent to offspring, or of 
there being any "contri])ution" made ])y an ancestor to its posterity, 
must only be admitted under the strictest reserve, and merely as 
descriptive terms. 

We are now presented with some entirely new conceptions: 

(1) The purity of the gametes in regard to certain characters. 

(2) The distinction of all zygotes according as they are or are not 
formed by the union of like or unlike gametes. In the former case, 
apart from variation, they breed true when mated with their like; in 
the latter case their offspring, collectively, will be heterogeneous. 

(3) If the zygote be formed by the union of dissimilar gametes, we 
may meet the phenomenon of (a) dominant and recessive charac- 
ters; {h) a 1)lend form; (e) a form distinct from either parent, often 
reversionary.'' 

«See von Guaita, Ber. Naturf. Ges. Freiburg, X, 1898, and XI, LS99, quoted by 
Professor Weldon (see later). 

'' This fact sufliciently indicates the difficulties involved in a superficial treatment 
of the plienomenon of reversion. To call such reversions as those named above 
"returns to ancestral type" would In-, if more than a descriptive phrase were 
intended, (juite misleading. It is not the ancestral type that lias come back, but 
something else has come in its guise, as the offspring presently i)rove. For the first 
time we thus begin to get a rationale of "reversion." 



THE PROBLEMS OF HEREDITY AND THEIR SOLUTION. 575 

But there are additjonal and even more sij>'nitieant doduetions from 
the facts. We have seen that the o-amctes are difi'erentiated in re.spect 
of pui'e eharacters. Of these pure characters there may conceivabl}^ 
})e any numl)er associated together in one organism. In the pea Men- 
del detei'ted at least seven — not all seen by him eoml)ined in the same 
plant; but there is every likelihood that they are all capable of being 
thus combined. 

Eacli such character, which is capal)le of being dissociated or replaced 
by its contrary-, nuist henceforth ))e conceived of as a distinct unit 
character; and as we know that the several unit characters are of such 
a nature that any one of them is capable of inch^pendentl}' displacing 
or being displaced ))V one or more alternati\e characters taken singly, 
we may recognize this fact b}' naming such unit characters allelomorphs. 
So far wo know very little of an}' allelomorphs existing otherwise 
than as pairs of contraries, but this is probably merely due to experi- 
mental limitations and the rudimentary state of our knowledge. 

In one case (coml)s of fowls) we know three characters — pea comb, 
rose comb, and single comb, of which pea and single, or rose and sin- 
gle, behave toward each other as a pair of allelomorphs, but of the 
behavior of pea and rose toward each other we know as 3^et nothing. 

We have no reason as yet for affirming that any phenomenon prop- 
erh' described as displacement of one allelomorph l)y another occurs, 
though the metaphor may be a useful one. In all cases where domi- 
nance has been perceived wt^ can affirm that the members of the 
allelomorphic pair stand to each other in a relation the nature of which 
we are as yet wholly unable to apprehend or illustrate. 

To the new conceptions already enumerated we may therefore add: 

(4) Unit characters, of which some, when once arisen l)y variation, 
are alternative to each other in the constitution of the gametes, 
according to a dehnite system. 

From the relatious subsisting between these characters it follows 
that as each zygotic union of allelomorphs is resolved on the formation 
of the gametes, no zygote can give rise to gametes collectively repre- 
senting more thtui two chai-acters allelomorphic to each other, apart 
from new variation. 

From the fact of the existence of the interchangeable chai'acters we 
must, for purposes of treatment and to complete the ])os,sibilities, nec- 
essarily form tlie conception of an irresoluble base, though whether 
such a conception has any objective reality we have no means as yet of 
determining. 

We have now seen that when [\\o varieties ^1 and // are crossed 
together, the lieterozygolx^ A/) [)i'oduces gametes bcai'iiig the pure A 
character and the pure 7/ characbM'. In such a case we speak of such 
characters as simple allelomor})hs. In many cases, however, a more 
complex j)henomen()n happens. 'Hw. character brought in on fertili- 
zation b}' one or other })areiit may be of such a natui'e that when the

zygote ABiovms its j^ametes, these arc not individually bearers nierel}'^ 
of A and ^, but of a number of characters tliemselves ag-ain integral, 
which in, say ^1, behaved as one character so long as its gametes united 
in fertilization with others like themselves, but on cross fertilization 
are resolved and redistributed among the gametes produced by the 
cross-bred zygote. 

In such a case we call the character ^1 a compound allelomorph, and 
we can speak of the integral characters which constitute it as hypallelo- 
morphs. We ought to write the heterozygote {AuVA"...) B and the 
gametes produced bv it may be of the form ^1, A! ^ A!\ ^1'",... B. Or 
the resolution may be incomplete in various degrees, as we already 
suspect from certain instances', in which case we may have gametes 
.4, A A", A"'A"'\ MA'AC^.-.B, and so on. Each of "these may meet 
a similar or a dissimilar gamete in fertilization, forming either a homo- 
zygote or a heterozygote with its distinct properties. 

In the case of compound allelomorphs we know as yet nothing of 
the statistical relations of the several gametes. 

Thus we have the conception 

(5) of a Compound character, borne l)y one gamete, transmitted 
entire as a single character so long as fertilization only occurs between 
like gametes, or is, in other words, "symmetrical;""' but if fertilization 
take place with a dissimilar gamete (or possilily by other causes), 
resolved into integral constituent characters, each separately trans- 
missible. 

Next, as, by the union of the gametes ])earing the various hypallelo- 
morphs with other such gametes, or with gametes bearing simple 
allelomorphs, in fertilization, a number of new zygotes will be formed, 
such as may not have been seen before in the l)reed. Thes<; will ine-.i- 
tably be spoken of as varieties; and it is difficult not to extend the 
idea of variation to them. To distinguish these from other ^iu•ia- 
tions — which there must surely be — we may call them 

(6) Analytical variations in contradistinction to 

(7) Synthetical variations, occurring not })y the separation of pre- 
existing constituent characters, but by the addition of new characters. 

Lastly, it is impossible to be presented Avith the fact that in Mende- 
lian cas(\s the cr()ss])red produces on an average e([ual numlxu's of 
gametes of each kind — that is to say, a synunetrical result — without 
suspecting that this fact must correspond with some symmetrical figure 
of distribution of those gametes in th(> cell divisions by which the}' 
are produced. 

At the present time these are the main conceptions— though by no 
means all — arising directly from MendePs work. The first six are all 
more or less clearly embodied by him, though not in ever}' case devel- 
oped in accordance with modern knowledge. The seventh is not a 
Mendelian conception, but the facts before us justify its inclusion in 



THE PROBLEMS OF HEREDITY AND THEIR SOLUTION. 577 

the iibove list, though for the prcsmt it is litth^ more tiiiiii a mere sur- 
mise. ' , 

In MeudeUan eases it will now 1>e pcreeivt'fl that all the zygotes 
eoniposing the population consist of a limited number of possible 
types, each of definite constitution, bearing gametes also of a limited 
and definite number of types, and definite constitution in respect of 
preexisting characters. It is now evident that in such cases each sev- 
eral i)rogenitor need not ))e ])i'ought to account in reckoning the prob- 
able characters of each descendant; for the gametes of crossbreds arc 
difi;'erentiated at each successive generation, some parental (Mendelian) 
characters being left out in the composition of each gamete produced 
by a zygote arising ))y the union of l)earers of opposite allelomorphs. 

When from these considerations we return to the phenomena com- 
prised in the law of ancestral heredity, wliat certainty have we that 
the same conceptions are not applicable there also^ 

It has now been shown that the question whether in tlie crossbred 
zygotes in general the characters l)lend or are nmtually exclusive is an 
entirely subordinate one, and distinctions with regard to the essential 
nature of heredity l)ased on these circumstances ])ecome irrelevant. 

In the case of a population presenting continuous variation in regard 
to, say, stature, it is easy to see how ])urity of the gamt>tes in respect of 
any intensities of that character might not in ordinary circumstances 
be capable of detection. There are doubtless more tiian two pure 
gametic forms of this character, but there may ([uite conceiva])ly be 
six or eight. AVhen it is remem])ered that each heterozygous combi- 
nation of any two may lune its own appropriate stature, and that 
such a character is distinctly dependent on external conditions, the 
mere fact that the obser\ed curves of stature give "chance distribu- 
tions'' is not surprising and may still be comi)atible with purity of 
gametes in respect of certain pure types. In peas {I\ .saflvu///)^ for 
example, from MendeFs work wa know that the tall forms and the 
extreme dwarf forms exhil)it gametic purity. 1 liave seen at Messrs. 
Sutton's strong evidence of the same nature in the case of the tall 
sweet pea {LatJti/i'us odordfux) and th(^ dwarf or procuml)ent ''Cupid" 
form. 

But in the case of the sweet pea we know at h'ast one pure form of 
definitely intermediate height, and in the case of /*. .satlvinii there are 
many. ^Yhen the extreme types breed togetlnn- it will be remembered 
the heterozygote commonly exceeds the taller in height. In th(> next 
generation, since there is in the case of extremes, so nuicli margin 
between the types of the two pure forms, the return of the ofi'springto 
the three forms, of whicli two are homozygous and one heterozygous, 
is clearly perceptil)le. 

If, however, instead of pure extreme varieties, we were to take a 
pair of varieties differing normally by only a foot or two, we might,

owing" to the masking effects of conditions, etc., have great difficult}" 
in distinguisliing the tliree forms in the second generation. There 
would, besides, be twice as many heteroz^^gous individuals as honio- 
z3"gous individuals of each kind, giving a symmetrical distriljution of 
heights, and who inig-lit not — in pre-Mendelian days — have accepted 
such evidence, made still less clear by influence of conditions, as 
proof of continuous variation both of zygotes and gametes ( 

Suppose, then, that instead of two pure types, we had six or eight 
Ijreeding tog-ether, each pair forming their own heterozygote, there 
would be a very remote chance of such purity or fixity of type, whether 
of gamete or z3^gote, being detected. 

Dominance, as we have seen, is merely a phenomenon incidental to 
specific cases, between which no other common property has 3^et been 
perceived. In the phenomena of blended inheritance we clearly have 
no dominance. In the cases of alternative inheritance studied by 
Galton and Pearson there is evidentl}' no universal dominance. From 
the tables of Basset hound pedigrees there is clearly no detinite domi- 
nance of either of the coat colors. In the case of eye color the pub- 
lished tables do not, so far as I have discovered, furnish the material 
for a decision, though it is scarcely possible the phenomenon, even if 
only occasional, could have been overlooked. We must take it, then, 
there is no sensible dominance in these cases; but whether there is or 
is not sensible gametic purity is an altogether different question, which, 
so far as I can judge, is as 3"et untouched. It may i)erfectl3^ well be 
that we shall be compelled to recognize that in many cases there is no 
such purit3% and that the characters ma3" be carried 1)3' the gametes in 
an}^ proportion from zero to totalit3", just as some substances ma3' be 
carried in a solution in any proportion from zero to saturation without 
discontinuous change of properties. That this ma3" be found true in 
some cases is, on any hypothesis, certain; but to prove the fact for an3" 
given case will he an exceedingly difficult operation, and I scarcely 
think it has been yet carried through in such a wa3" as to leave no 
room for doul)t. 

Conversely, the absolute and universal purity of the gametes has 
certainly not 3'et been determined for an}" case; not even in those cases 
where it looks most likel}" that such universal purit3' exists. lm])air- 
ment of such })ui-ity we mav conceive either to occur in th(^ form of 
mosaic gametes, or of gametes with l)lended properties. On analogv 
and from direct evidence we haA'c ever3" right to believe that gametes 
of both these classes ma}" occur in rare and exceptional cases, of as 
3"et unexplored nature,^' but such a phenomenon will not diminish the 
significance of observed purity. 

" It will be iiiKk'rstood from what follow.s that the i-xistence of mosaic zygotes is no 
proof that eitlier c(Miii)()nent gamete was mosaic. 



THE PROBLEMS OF HEREDITY AND THEIR SOLUTION. 579 

We have now .seen the essential nature of the Mendel i;in prineiples 
and are able to appreeiate the exact rehition in wliicli they stand to 
the group of eases inchided in tlie law of aiu-estral luM-edity. In 
seeking any general indieatioii as to the eonnnon properties of the 
phenomena whieh aTe already known to obey Mendelian principles we 
ean as yet point to none, and whether some sueli eonnnon features 
exist or not is unknown. 

T'here is, however, one group of cases, delinite though as yet not 
numerous, where we know that the Mendelian principles do not apply. 
These are the phenomena upon which Mendel touches in his brief 
paper on Hieraciuni. As he there states, the hy])rids, if they are fertile 
at all, produce otfspring like themselves, not like their parents. In 
further illustration of this phenomenon he cites Wichura's Salix hybrids. 
Perhaps some dozen other such illustrations could be gi\'en which rest 
on good evidence. To these cases the Mendelian principle will in 
no wise ai)ply, nor is it easy to conceive any moditication of the law 
of ancestral heredity which can express them. There the matter at 
present rests. Among these cases, however, we perceive several more 
or less eonnnon features. They are often, though not always, h^ybrids 
between forms dift'ering in many characters. The lirst cross fre- 
({uently is not the exact interuK^diate ])etween the two parental types, 
l)ut may, as in the few Hieracium cases, be irregular in this respect. 
There is often some degree of sterility. In the al»sence of fuller and 
statistical knowledge of such cases further discussion is impossil)le. 

Another class of cases, untouched ])y any hypothesis of heredity yet 
propounded, is that of the false hybrids of Millardet, where we have 
fertilization without transmission of one or several pai'ental characters. 
In these not only does the first cross sliow, in some respect, the char- 
acter or characters of one parent only, ))ut in its posterity no reap- 
pearance of the lost character or characters is ()bser\ed. The nature 
of such cases is still ({uite obscure, l)ut we luu'e to suppose that the 
allelomorph of one gamete only develops after fertilization to the exclu- 
sion of the corresponding allelomorph of the other gamete, nuich — if 
the crudity of the com])arison may be pardoned —as occurs on the 
female side in parthenogenesis without fertilization at all. 

To these as yet altogether unconformable cases we can scarcely 
doubt that further experinuMit will add many more. Indeed, we 
already have tolera])ly clear e\idence that many phenomena of inherit- 
ance are of a much higher ordei- of complexity. When the paper on 
Pisum was written Mendel apparently inclined to the view that with 
modifications his law might be found to include all the phenomena of 
hybridization, but in the brief subsequent paper on Hieracium he 
clearly recognized the existence of cases of a difi'erent nature. Those 
who read that contribution will be int(U'ested to see that he lavs down

a principle which may be extended from hybridization to liercdit}" in 
general, that the laws of each new case must be determined by separate 
experiment. 

As regards the Mendel ian principles, which it is the chief aim of 
this introduction to present clearly before the reader, a professed 
student of A^ariation will easily be able to till in the outline now indi- 
cated, and to illustrate the various conceptions from phenomena 
already familiar. To do this is beyond the scope of this short sketch, 
but enough perhaps has now l)cen said to show that l^y the applica- 
tion of those principles we are enabled to reach and deal" in a compre- 
hensive manner with phenomena of a fundamental nature, lying at the 
very root of all conceptions not merely of the physiology of reproduc- 
tion and heredity, l>uteven of the essential nature of living organisms; 
and I think that I used no extravagant words when, in introducing 
Mendel's work to the notice of readers of the Royal Horticultural 
Society's Journal. I ventured to declare that his experiments are 
worthy to rank with those which laid the foundation of the atomic 
laws of chemistrv.

It is now twenty-oio-ht years since this association last assemliled in 
Belfast, and to those present who can recall the meeting, tlie proceed- 
ings of Section D will be ]>est renieni])ered for the deliviny of an 
address by Huxley "On the hypothesis tliat animals ar(> automata, 
and its history.'"' one of the finest philosophic products of liis mind. 
At that date the zoological woi'ld was a})Out to emlmrk on a period of 
marked activity. Fired l)y the intlucMice of the "Origin of Species," 
which had survived a})use and was taking immediate effect, the 
zoological mind, accepting tlic^ doctrine of evolution, had l)ecome 
eager to determine the lines of descent of animal forms. Marine 
observatories were in tlieir infancy; the (JJudh'iu/cr was still at sea; 
the study of comparati\'e ein})ryology was but then becoming a science; 
and wIkmi, refits-ting on this, we briefly survey the present held, we 
can but stand astonished at the enormity of th(» task which has beeji 
achieved. 

Development has proceeded on every hand. The leavciiing influ- 
ence, spreading with sure effect, has in due course extended to the 
antipodes and the East, in each of which poi'tions of the globe there 
have now arisen a l)and of earnest workers pledged to the investiga- 
tion of th(Mr indigenous fauna, with which they are proceeding with 
might and main. Of the flapanese, let it be said that not oid}' have 
they filled in gaps in our growing knowledge, for which they alone 
have the materials at hand, but that, with an acumen deserving the 
highest praise, they have put us right on first })rinciples. I refer to 
the fact that they have shown, with respect to the embryonic mem- 
branes of the common chick, that we in the West, with our historic 
associations, our methods, and our skill, contenting ours(dves with 
an ever-reciu"ring restriction to the germinal anni, have, by an error 
of orientation, missed an all-important s(>ptum, displaced under an 
ine(^uality of growth.

582 M0EPH0L0C4ICAL METHOD AND RECENT PROGRESS IN ZOOLOGY. 

Those ol" us who have li\'c'd and worked throu^^hout this memorable 
period have had a unique experience, for never has there been prog- 
ress SO rapid, accumuhition of observations so extensive and exact. 
Of the 386,000 living- animal species, to compute the estimate low, 
every one available has been lain under hand, with the result that our 
annual literarv output now amounts to close upon lO.OOO contri})utions, 
the description of new genera and sul)g'enera, say l.TOt). ^Nlore than 
one-half of this vast series refer to the Insecta alone; l)ut notwith- 
standing- this, the I'ecords of facts of structure and development, with 
which most of us are concerned, now amount to a formidable mass, 
calculated to awe the unlettered looker-on, to overwhelm the earnest 
devotee, unless by specializing- he can s(H'ure relief. As an example 
of what may occur, it ma}^ be remarked that a recent exploration of 
the g-reat African lakes has resulted in the discovery of over 130 new 
species. 

As to the nature of this imprecedented progress, it will suffice to 
consider the Earthworms. In 1874 few were known to us. An ad- 
vance in our knowledg-e, which had then comiuenced. had made known 
but few more which seemed likely to ^^ield result. Darwin's book 
upon them liad not appeared. -Some were exotic, it is true, but no 
one susj)ected that a group so restricted in their ha])its could reveal 
aught beyond a dull monotony of form and structure. Never was 
surmise more wide of the mark, for the coml)ined investigations of a 
score of earnest workers in all parts of the world have in the interval 
recorded some Too odd species of al)out 110 genera. Mainly exotic, 
they exhibit among themselves a structural variation of the widest 
possible range. Not only do we recognize littoral and l)ranchiate 
forms, ))ut others acluetous and leech-like in ha))it. to the extent of 
the discovery of a morphological overlap with the leeches, under 
which we are now compelled to remo\e them from their old associa- 
tion with the flat worms, and to luiite them with the earthworms. 
And we even lind these animals, as represented by the AeantJiodriUdm^ 
coming prominently into considerations which involve the theory of a 
former antarctic continent, one of the most revolutionary zoo-geogra- 
phical topics of our time. 

This case of th(> earthworm may be taken as typical of the rest, since 
for each and evei-y class and order of animal forms the progress of the 
period through which w(> have })assed since last we assembled luM-e has 
produccnl revolutionary results. Our knowledge of facts has become 
materially enhanced; our classifications, at best but the woi'king ex- 
pression of our ideas, have be(Mi to a large extent replaced in clearer, 
more couiprehensive, schemes; and we are to-day ena])l(Hl to deduce, 
with an accuracy proportionate to our increasinl knowledge of fact, 
the nature of the interrelationships of the living forms which with 
ourselvc\s iniiabit the (\'U-th. 



MORPHOLOGTOAL METHOD AND EECENT PROGRESS IN ZOOLCX^Y. 583 

Siitisl'actoi'v as is this i'(>sult. it imist be clearly horn in mind that its 
realization could not .have coni(> about ')ut I'or a knowledge of the 
animals of the past. And turnino- now to paleontology, it may be said 
that at the time of our last meeting in this city the scientific world 
was just l)ecominw- entninc(>d by the promise of unexpected results in 
the exploration of the American Tertiary beds, then beino- first 0})ened 
up. The Rocky Mountain district was the area under investigation, 
and witli this, as with the prog'ress in our knowled^^'e of recent forms, 
no one livino- was prepared for the discoveries wdiicli shortly came to 
pass. To consider a concrete case, we may premise^ that study of the 
placental nuunmals had justified the conclusion that their ancestors 
nuist have had e(|ual and pentadactyle limbs, a complete ulna and 
fibula, a com})lete clavicle, and a skull with 44 teeth- nuist have 
realized, that is, the ])redoniinant term of the living insecti\ora 
as generally unchn'stood. Who among the zoologists of ourtinu^ does 
not recall with enthusiasm the revelation which arose from the dis- 
covery, during these early days, in the Eocene of central North 
America, of the genc^-a at first desci'ibed as Eo- iwnX JLIohyii.s/ The 
evidence of the existence, in the locality named, of these 44-toothed 
peccaries, as they were held to l)e, rend(>red clearer the I'ecords 
of the later Tertiary deposits of the Old World, which were those of 
hogs, and, in corrcdation with the facts then known, suggestcnl that 
the Rocky Mountain area was the home of the ancestral porcine stock, 
and that in early Tertiary times their descendants must hav(Mnigrated, 
on the one hand, across the northern l)elt, of wdiich the Aleutian 
Islands now mark the course, into the Old World, to beget, l)y compli- 
cation of their teeth, the pigs and hogs; and on the other into central 
South America, to give rise, ])y mnuerical reduction of t(>eth and toes, 
to the peccaries, still extant. 

Migration in opposite directions with diversity of modification was 
the refi'ain of this remarkable find, far-reaching in its m<)r))hological 
and zoo-geographical effects. Nor can we allude^ with less fervor to 
the still more striking case of the horses, which proved not merely a 
similar, though p(M-haj)s a later, migration. l)ut a parallelism of modi- 
fication in both the Old and New worlds, culminating in the latter in 
extinction, whereby it became necessary, on the advent of civilized 
man, to cai'ry l)ack the Old World horse to its ancestral American 
home. No wonder that this should hav(^ provoked our Huxley to the 
remark that in it we have the ''demonstrative evidence of the occnr- 
rencc^ of (W'olution,'' and that the facts of paleontology came to be 
regarded as certainly not second to those of the fascinating but seduc- 
tive department of (Mubi-yology, at the time making giant strides. 

I have endeavored thus to ])ietiire that state of zoological science at 
the time of our last meeting here, and 1 wish now to confine myself to 
some of the l^roader results since achieved on the morphological side. 



584 MORPHOLOaiOAL METHOD AND RECENT PROGRESS IN ZOOLOGY. 

But let US lirj^t digress, in order to be clear as to the meaning oi' this 
phrase. 

We do not expect the public to be accurate in their usage of scien- 
titic terms; but it is to mo an astounding fact that among traincnl 
scientilic experts, devotees to branches of science other than our own, 
there exists a gi'oss misunderstanding as to the limitations of our 
departments. I quote from an official report in alluding to "com- 
parative anatomists, or biologists, as they call thiMusehes." and 1 l)ut 
cite the words of an eminent scientitic friend in referring to biology 
and l)otany as coequal. In endeavoring to get rid of this prevailing- 
error, let it be once more said that the term "biology " was introduced 
at the beginning of the nineteenth century ])y Treviranus and Lamarck, 
and that in its usage it has come to signify two totally distinct things 
as employed by our continental contemporaries and ourselves. By 
" biologic '' they understand the study of the organism in relation to 
its environment. We, following Huxley, include in our term l)iology 
the study of all phenomena manifested ly living matter; botany and 
zoology; and by morphology we zoologists mean the study of struc- 
ture in all its forms, of anatomy, histology, and development, with 
paleontology — of all, that is, which can be preferably studied in the 
dead state — as distinct f rom ph\\siology, the study of the living in action. 
Comparative morphology, the study of likeness and unlikeness, is the 
basis of our w^orking classifications, and it is to the consideration of 
the morphological method and the more salient of its recent results that 
I would now proceed, in so far as it may be said to have marked prog- 
ress and given precision to our ideas within the last eight and twent}' 
years. I would deal in the main with facts, with theories only where 
self-evident, ignoring that type of generalization to which the exclu- 
sive study of embryology has lent itself, which characterizes, ]>ut does 
not grace, a vast portion of our recent zoological literature. 

To the earnest student of zoology intent on current advance, the 
mental image of the interrelationships of the greater groups of aniiual 
forms is ever changing — kaliMdoscopically it may be — but with dimin- 
ishing etfect in proportion as our knowledge Ix'comes the more precise. 

Returning now to American paleontology, we may at once continue 
our theme. In this vast field expedition after expedition has I'eturned 
with material rich and plentiful. And while l)v study of it oui' knowl- 
edge of cNcry li\'ing manunalian order, to say the least, has been 
extended, and in some cases nnolutionized, we ha\e come to r(\gard 
the eai'ly TcM'tiary period as the heyday of the mannnals in the sense 
that the present epoch is that of the smaller birds. No wonder, then, 
that there should have ])een discovered group after group which has 
become extinct, or evidence that in mattcM-s sucii as tooth sti'ucture 
there is reason to t)elieve that types identical with those of to-day 
have been ])i-(n'i()usly cxolved. l»iit to disappear. To contemplate the

di,sc(n'eiy of the 'ritiniotliciiu. tlic Aiul)lyopod:i, tho Dinoceratu, with 
their .stnuioe diiiiimitive brain, cliiei" amono-the heavier imgiilato forms, 
is to consider the Manuualia anew; and when it is found that among 
late discoveries we have (1) that of a series of Rhinoceratoidea, which, 
though not yet known to extend so far hack in time as the primitive 
tapirs and horses, are complete as far as they go; (2) that among the 
Ruminants we have, in the Oreodontida^ of the American Eocene, 
primitive forms with a dentition of 44 teeth, an absence of diastemata, 
a pentadactyle manus, a tetradact>de pes with traces of a hallux, and, 
as would appear from an example of ^Lxoreodon^ a bony clavicle, such 
as is unknown in any later ungulate, we are aroused to a pitch of eager 
enthusiasm as to the outcome of labors !iow in hand; for as I write 
there reaches me a letter to the effect that for most of the great ver- 
tebrate groups, and not the mannnals aJonc. collections are still coming- 
in, each more wonderful than the last. 

In the extension of our knowledge of the Ancylopoda, an order of 
mannnals named after the AncyJ()therinin. of Pikermi and Samos, which 
occur in the early Tertiaiy deposits of Europe, Asia, North America, 
antl alnuidantly in Patagonia, we have been made aware of the exist- 
ence of genera w^iose salient structural features combine the dentition 
of an ungulate with the possession of pointed claws, believed to have 
))een retractile, like those of the living cats. Conversely to these 
unguiculate herbivores, which include genera with limbs on both the 
artio- and perisso-dactyle lines, there have been found among the 
so-called Mesonychida? undoubted primitive carnivores, indications of 
a type of terminal phalanx seal like and approximately nonunguiculate; 
from all of which it is clear that we have in the rocks the remains 
of forms extinct which transpose the correlations of tooth and claw 
deducible from the living orders alone. Further among the primitive 
pentadactyle Carnivora we meet, in the genus Pat riof ills, with a 
reduction of the lower incisors to tw^o, and characters of the fore limb 
which, with this, suggest the seals. It is, however, prol)able that 
these characters are in no way indicative of direct genetic relationship 
betw(^en the two, for inasmuch as tliese animals were accustomed to 
seek their food in the water of the lake by which they dwelt, their seal- 
like characters may be ])ut the expression of adaptation to a partially 
aquatic modc^ of life of parallelism of moditication with the seals, and 
nothing more. 

Early in the history of their in(]uiry our American confreres recorded 
from the Pliocene lh(> discov(My of camel-like forms possessed of a full 
upper incisor dentition — for exampl(\ the genera Protohihix and Ithi/- 
graiDitiodon — and now they have ari'i\(Hl at the conclusion that while 
the camels ai'c of American origin one of their most characteristic 
ruminants, the Prongbuck {A)ifU()aipv(t)^ would con\'ersely appear to 
l)e the descendant of an ancestor {Blusfoniery,!) that migrated fi'om the 
Old World. 



586 MORPHOLOGICAL METHOD AND KECENT PROGRESS IN ZOOLOGY. 

Sufficient this concernino- the work in nuuunialoyy of the American 
paleontologists. Whih' wo return them our devout and learned admi- 
ration, we would point out that the l)rilliance of their discoveries has 
but beclouded the recognition of equally" important investigations 
going on elsewhere. In Argentina there have proceeded, side b}" side 
with the Nortli American explorations, researches into the Pleistocene 
or Pampa fauna, which in result are not one whit behind, as has l)een 
proved by the recognition of a whole order of primitive ungulates, 
the Toxodontia, ])y that of toothed cetaceans with elongated nasals, as 
in the genera Prosqualodon and Argyrocetus^ and of sperm whales with 
functional premaxillary teeth, viz, PJujsodon and IhjixK-diix^ to say 
nothing of giant armadillos and pigmy gl3"ptodons. 

It will l>e remembered hy some present that from Patagonian deposits 
of supposed Cretaceous age there was exhibited at our Dover meeting 
the skull of a horned chelonian Melolmvla^ which animal, we were 
informed, is barely distinguishable from the species originally dis- 
covered in Cooks Island, one of the Society group, and which, being 
a marsh turtle highly specialized, would seem in all probabilit}' to 
furnish a forcible defense for the theory of the Antarctic continent. 
But more than this the results of renewed investigation of the Argen- 
tine beds by the members of the Princeton University of North 
America have recently resulted in collections which, we are informed, 
seem likely to surpass ail precedent in their bearings upon oui- current 
ideas, not the least remarkable preliminary announcement being the 
statement that there occurs fossil a mole indistinguishal)le, so far as is 
known, from the golden mole {Glvnj meld oris) of South Africa. 

Before I dismiss this fascinating subject let me disarm the notion, 
which may have arisen, that the paleontological work of the Old 
World is done. Far from it! Even our American cousins have to 
come to us for important fossil forms as, for example, the genus 
PHoJii/rax of Samos and the Egyptian desert, while among the rodents 
and smaller carnivores there are large collections in our national 
nuiseum waiting to be worked over afresh. 

If one part of the globt^ more than another is just now the c(Miter of 
interest concerning its vertel)rate remains, it is th(> Egyptian desert. 
Here there have recently l)een found the l)ones of a huge cetacean 
associated, as in South America, with those of a giant snake, one of 
the longest known, since it nuist have reached a length of 30 feet. 
There also occur the remains of other snakes, of chelonians of remark- 
able adaptive t3qje, of crocodilians, lishes, and other animals. Interest, 
however, is greatest concerning the Mammalia, which for novelty are 
quite np to the American standard, as with an upper and a lower jaw 
of an anomalous creature, concerning which we can oidy at present 
remai'k that it may be a marsupial, or more pro])ably a carnivore, 
which has talaui on tlie rodent type in a manner peculiarly its own. 



MORPHOLOGICAL METHOD AND RECENT PROGRESS IN ZOOLOGY. 587 

linporhiiit Ix'yond this, however, arc a series of Koeeiie forms which 
more than till a loiio'-staiulinj;- ^ap, viz, that of the ancestors of the 
elephants and niastodon.s, which hitherto stopped short in the Middle 
Miocene of both Old and New Worlds. As represented by the genus 
Mperttheriwii^ \h^Y have three incisors abo\-e and two below, of which 
the second is in each case converted into a short but massive tusk. 
An upper canine is present, and in both upper and lower jaws a series 
of six cheek teeth, distinct and bunodont in type. In the allied Bary- 
therium, of which a larg-o part of the skeleton is known, the upper 
incisors were presumalily reduced to two, the tusks enlarg-ed, with 
resemblances in detail to the Dinoceratan type. 

So far as these remains are known, they appear to present in their 
combined characters all that the most ardent evolutionist could desire. 
There are with them Mastodons, which simplify our knowledge of this 
group, and among the last-discovered remains Sirenians, which, in 
presenting a certain similarity to the afore-mentioned Mteritherium, 
strengthen the belief in the pro))Oscidian relationships of these aquatic 
forms. Finally, and perhaps most noticeable of all, there is the genus 
ArsinoitlK'i'hiui^ a heavy brute with an olfactoi'v vacuity which out- 
rivals that of Gi'ypotlicr'nnii itself, and is surmounted l)y a monstrous 
fronto-nasal horn, swo11(mi and bitid, for which the most formidal)le 
among the Titanotheres might yearn in vain. There is an occiput to 
match! The suggestion that this extraordinary })east has relationships 
with the llhinoceridie is absurd, since its tooth pattern alone inverts 
the order of this type. Tliat it is prol)Oscidian may be nearer the 
mark, and if so it show^s once more how su])tle were the mammals of 
the past. Great as is this result much remains to be done or done 
again, if only from the fact that in seeking to determine homologies 
our American l)rethren, in the opinion of some of us, have placed too 
much reliance on a so-called tritul>ercular theory of tooth genesis, of 
which we can not admit the proof. How, we would ask, is it conceiv- 
a])le that a transversely ridged molar of the T)i protodoii type can be 
of tritubercular origin? 

Sufficient for the moment of paleontological advance, except to 
remark that the zoologist who neglects this branch of mor})hology 
miss(^s the one leavening influence; neghM'ts th(^ coui"t on whose ruling 
arguments deduced from eml)rvological data alone must either stand 
or fall. W(> may form our own conclusions from facts of the order 
before^ us, but it is when we find their intiuence on the master mind 
prompting to action, like that of Huxley with his mighty memoir of 
1880, in which he revised our sulx-lass terms, that we a})pr(M'iate th(Mn 
to the full. 

With this consideration w(> pass to the living forms, and 1 have oidy 
time in dealing with these to conunent on advance which atfects our 
broadest conceptions and classilications of the past. 



588 MOEPHOLOGICAL METHOD AND RP^CENT PROGRESS IN ZOOLOGY. 

To commence with the Mammaliii, we now know that the mammaiy 
o-land when tirst it appears is in all fornjs tnl>ular, and that this t3"pe 
is no longer distinctive of the Monotremata alone. We know, too, 
that the intranarial position of the epiglottis when at rest, long- known 
for certain forms, is a distinction of the class. It explains the pres- 
ence of the v^clum palatinum by its association with the glottis for the 
restriction of the respiratory passage, the connection being lost in 
man alone under specialization of the organ of the voice. 

Similarl}' the doubly ossified condition of the coracoid ma}^ now be 
held diagnostic, for it is known that the epicoracoidal element, origi- 
nally thought to characterize the monotremes alone, is always present, 
and that reduction to a varying degree characterizes the metacoracoid, 
which retires, as in man, as the so-called coracoid epiphysis. 

Our conceptions of the interrelationships of the Marsupialia and 
Placentalia have, during the period we are considering, been delimited 
bej'ond expectation by the discovery of an allantoic placenta in a poly- 
protodont marsupial in place of the vitelline, present in its allies. 
When it is remembered that in the formation of the placenta of the 
rabl)it and a l)at there is realized a provisional vitelline stage, it is 
tempting to suggest that the evidence for the direct relationship of 
the two mannnalian subclasses first named overlaps (there being a pla- 
cental marsupial on one hand, a marsupial placental on the other), 
nnu-h as we have come to regard Archwopteryx as an avian reptile, 
the Odontornithes as reptilian birds. These facts, moreover, prove 
that the type of placenta inherited by the Placentalia nuist have been 
discoidal, and that from that all others were derived. 

Equally important concerning our knowledge of the Marsupialia is 
the discovery, first made clear by Professor Symington, of this col- 
lege, that Owen was correct in denying them a corpus callosum. How 
Owen arrived at this conclusion it is diificult to conceive, but in these 
later days the history of discovery is largely that of method, and it is 
by the employment of chrome silver, methylene blu(>, and other 
reagents, which in dift'erentiating tlie fil)er tracts enable us to delimit 
their course, that this conclusion has been proved. By the corpus 
callosum we now understand n series of neopallial fibers which tran- 
sect the alveus and are present only in the Placentalia. 

There is no department of mammalogy in which recent work has 
been more luminous than this which concerns the brain, and, to men- 
tion but one residt, it may be said that in the renewed study of the 
conunissures there has been found a fil)er tract characteristic of the 
Diprotodontia alone, so situated as to prove that they and the Placen- 
talia must have specialized on diNcrse lines from a polyprotodont 
stock. Interesting this the more, since the phalaiigers and kangaroos 
are known to l)e polyprotodont when 5^oung. And when we add the 
discovei-y that in the detailed relationship of its conunissures the l)rain 



MORPHOLOGICAL METHOD AND IIKCENT ]'ROGRESS IN ZOOLOGY'. 589 

of the Elephant Shrew, a lowl}' in.sectivore, alone among- that of all 
Placentalia known realizes the marsupial state, as does its accessory 
organ of smell, we have to admit the discovary of annectant conditions 
just where they should occur. 

The morphological method is sound! 

The master hand which has given us this result has also reinvesti- 
gated the Lemurs. From an exhaustive study of the brain or its cast 
of all species of the order, living and extinct, there has come the 
proof that the distinctive^ characters of the lenmroid l)rain are intelli- 
gible only on a knowledge of the pithecoid type; that its structural 
simplicity in the so-called lower lemurs is due to retrogressive change, 
in some species proved to 1)0 ontogenetic, and that the Tarsier, recently 
claimed to be an insectivore, is a lemur of lemurs. It is impossi})le 
to overestimate the importance of this conclusion, which receives con- 
firmation in recent paleontological work; and there is demanded a 
reinvestigation of those early described Tertiary fossil forms placed 
on the Ungulo-lemuroid border line, as also a reconsideration of cur- 
rent views on the evolution of the primates and of man. 

In dismissing the Mammalia we recall the capture during the period 
we review of three new genera, a fourth, the so-called Ncoiuylodo)), 
having proved by its skull to ])e (TPypotlierluiii ddrnun!!^ already 
known. The African Okapi, an object of sensation beyond its deserts, 
has found its place at last. To have l)een dubbed a donkey, a zebra, 
and a primitive hornless giratt'e is distinction indeed; and we can not 
refrain from contrasting the nonsensical statement that its discovery 
is "the most important since Archa^opteryx" with the truth that it is 
a giraffine, horned for both sexes; annectant between two groups well 
known. As a discovery it does not compare with that of the Mole- 
marsupial, and it falls into insigniticance beside that of the South 
American diprotodont CamoleKifei^, the survivor of a family which there 
flourished in Middle Tertiary tunes. 

Passing to birds and reptiles, it will be convenient to consider them 
together. A knowledge of their anatomy has extended on all hands, 
and in respect to nothing more instructively than their organs of res- 
piration. Surprise nmst ])e expressed at the discover^' in the chelo- 
nian of a mode of advancing complication of the lung suggestive of that 
of birds. On looking into this I find that Huxley, who rationalized 
our knowledge of the avian lung and its sacs, was aware of the fact 
that in our connuon water tortoise (7i)j///.^ orhioi/aris) the lung is 
sharply difi'erentiated along the l)ronchial line into a postero-dorsal 
more cellular mass, an antero-ventral more sacculai', of which the 
posterior vesicle, in its extension and bronchial rcdationships, 
strangely simulates the so-called abdominal sac of birds. He had 
alread}^ institutcnl com])arison with the crocodiles, and was clearly 
coming to the'conclusion that th" ai'ranoement in the bird is but the 



590 MORPHOLOGICAL METHOD AND RECENT PROGRESS IN ZOOLOGY. 

result of extreme specialization of a type common to all Sauropsida 
with a "cellular" lung. The respiratory process in the bird may be 
defined as transpulmonary, and it is an interesting coincidence that as 
I write there comes to hand a memoir supporting Huxley's conclusion 
and establishing the fact that there is a fundamental principle under- 
lying the development and primary differentiation of all types of 
vertebrate lung. 

The discovery of the Odontornithes in the American (Jretaceous is 
so well known that it is ))at necessary to remark that nine genera and 
some twenty species are recognized. To Arc/ueoj)te/'i/,r I shall return. 
Before dismissing the Chelonia, however, it nuist be pointed out that 
paleontology has detinitely clenched their supposed relationship to the 
Plesiosaurs. Of all recent paleontological collections there are none 
which, for care in collecting and skill in mounting, surpass the rep- 
tilian remains from the English Jurassic (Oxford clay) now public in 
our national uuiseum. The Plesiosaurs of this series nuist ])e seen to 
be appreciated, and nothing short of a merciful Providence can have 
interposed to insure the generic name Cnjptodeldux^ which one of 
them has received, since the hiding of the clavicle, its diagnostic char- 
acter, is an accomplished fact. It is due to secondary displacement 
under the approximation in the middle line of a pair of proscapular 
lobes, present in the Plesiosauria and Ciielonia alone, and until the 
advent of this discovery misinterpreted. Taken in conjunction with 
other characters of little less importance, conspicuously those of the 
plastron and pelvis, this decides the question of affinity, and proves 
the Chelonia to have had a lowly ancestr}", as has generally been 
maintained. 

Recent research has fully recorded the facts of dexelopment of the 
rare New Zealand reptile Sphenodon^ and it has more than justified 
the conclusion that it is the sole survivor of an originally extensive 
and primitive group, the Rhynchocephalia, as now understood. To 
confine our attention to its skeleton, as that portion of its body which 
can alone l)e compared with both th(^ living and extinct, it may ))e said 
that positive proof has ))een for the first time obtained that the devel- 
oping vertebral body of the terrestrial vertebrata passes through a 
pair(Ml cai'tiiaginous stage and tliat in its (h^tails th(> latcu- dcvidopment 
of this bod}" is most ncai'ly identical with that of the h)wcr Patrachia. 
There has long Ix'cn a consensus of opinion tiiat the forward exten- 
sion of th(> pt(>ryg()i(ls to meet the vomers in the middle line, known 
hitherto in this animal and the crocodiles alone, is for the terrestrial 
verte])rata a primitive character, and ]iroof of this has been obtained 
by its ])resence in all tlu^ Rhynchocei)halia known. The same condi- 
tion has also been found to exist in the IMesiosaurs, the Ichthyosaurs, 
the Pterodactyles, the Dicy^nodontia, the Dinosaurs, and with modific*a- 
tion in some chelonians. It has, moreover, been found in li\ing ])irds;

a iiio.st welcome fact, -i^mcQ^ ArrJneojjIcnj.i'^ in the possession of a plas- 
tron, carries the a\'ian tj^pe a stage lower than the Dinosaurs. It is 
pertinent here to remark -that, inasmuch as in those Dinosaurs (e. g., 
Coi/tj).s(>(/nafh>fx) in which the characters of the hind limbs are most 
nearly a^■ian, th(^ pelvis, in respect to its pubis, is at the antipodes of 
that of all known birds, and the fore limb is shortened in excess of 
that of Archcvoptt'nj.r itself, the long supposed dinosaurian ancestry 
for birds must l)e held in a])e3"ance. 

Passing through the Rhynchocephalia to the Batrachia we ha^'e to 
countenance progress most definite in its results. Th(> skull, the limbs 
and their girdles are chielly concerned, and this in a very remarkable 
way. 

In the year 1881 there was mad(^ known ])y Professor Froriep, of 
Tiiljingcn, the discovery that the hypoglossus nerve of the embryo 
mammal is possessed of dorsal ganglionated roots. Again and again 
ha^'e 1 heard Huxley insist on the fact that the ventral roots of this 
nerve are seiial with the spinal set, but uever did he suspect the rest. 
It is, however, a most intensely interesting fact that, whereas by a 
Huxleian triumph the vertebral theory of the skull was overthrown, 
•n these later Huxleian da3^s the proof of the incorporation of a portion 
of the verte])ral region of the trunk into the mammalian occiput 
should ha^'e marked the succeeding epoch in advance, The existence 
of twelve pairs of cranial nerves which all the Amniota possess in- 
volves them in this change, and the fact that in all Batrachia there 
are but ten, enal)les us to draw a hard-and-fast line between ]>atrachian 
and amniote series. 

It may be urged as an objection that since we have long l)een famil- 
iar with a fusion of vertabne and skull in various piscine forms, the 
force of this distinction is weakened. But this can not be, since in 
respect to the investing sheaths and processes of development which 
lie at the root of the genesis of the vertebral skeleton, the fishes stand 
distinct from the Batrachia and Anmiota, which are agreed. So forci- 
ble is this consideration that it behooves us to express it in words, and 
I have elsewhere proposed to discriminate between the series of terres- 
trial vertebi'ate as archa^ craniate and syncraniate. 

Similaily, there is no proof that any 1)atrachian, living or (>xtinct 
(and in this 1 indude the Stegocephala as a whole), poss(^sses a costal 
sternum. So far as their d(>velopment is known, the cartilages in these 
animals called "sternal*' are either coracoidal or sui generis. The 
costal sternum, like the syncraniate skull, is distinctive of the Anmiota 
alone. Had the Stegocephala possessed it even in cartilage, there is 
reason to think it might have ))een preserved, as it has been in the 
collossal Mososaur Tylosanrnx of the American (cretaceous. When to 
this it is added that wlnu'eas, in the presence of a costal sternum, the 
mechanism of inflation of the lung involves the body wall, in its absence 



592 MORPHOLOGICAL METHOD AND EECENT PROGRESS IN ZOOLOGY. 

it mainly invohcs the mouth (as in all tiyhcs and batrachians), the hard 
and sharp line between the Batrachia and Amniota may be expressed 
by the formula that the former are arcluecraniate and stomatophysous, 
the latter s^ncraniate and somatoph3'sous. 

There are allied topics which might l)e considered did our time per- 
mit, l)ut one certain outcome of this is that there is an end to tlie notion 
of a batrachian ancestr}^ for the Mammalia. And when, on this basis, 
we sum up the characters demanded of the stock from which the Mam- 
malia have ])een derived, Ave find them to ])0 precisely those occurring 
outside the Manmialia in the Anomodont reptiles alone. Beyond the 
sternum and skull the chief characters are the possession of short and 
equal pentadactyle lindjs, with never more than three phalanges to 
a digit, a complete libula and clavicle, a doubly ossilied coracoid, a 
heterodont dentition — a combination which, wholl}" or in part, we now 
associate with the Permian genera Procolophm^ PurHimarus^ and 
others which might be named, the discovery of which constitutes one 
of the morphological triumphs of our time. 

Beyond this, it may l)e added concerning the Batrachia, that among 
living pedate forms the anura have alone retained the pentadactyle 
state and the complete maxillo-jugal arch, and that the Eastern Tylo- 
totrlton, in the possession of the latter, becomes the least modified 
urodele extant. These facts lead to the extraordinar}- conclusion that 
the living Urodela, while of general lowh" organization, are one and 
all aberrant; and it is not the least important sequel to this that, despite 
their total loss of liml)s, the Apoda, in the retention of the dermal 
armor and other features which might be stated arc the most primitive 
Batrachia that exist. 

The ])atrachian phalangeal formula 22343 was luitil ((uite recently 
a difficulty in the determination of the precise zoological position of 
the class, but it has now been overcome l)y the discovery of a Kera- 
ter2>eton. in the Irish carboniferous having three phalanges on the second 
digit of both fore and hind limbs, and by that in the Permian of Saxon}'^ 
of a most remarkal^le creature, Scleroceplialus^ which, if rightl}^ 
referred to the Stegocephala, had a head encased, as its name implies, 
in an armature like that of a fish, and the phalangeal formula of a 
reptile, 23454:. 

Passing from the ])atrachia to the fishes, we have still to admit a 
gap, since an intermina])lc discussion on figures and fins lias not nar- 
rowed it in the least. In compensation for this, however, we have to 
record within the fish series itself pi'ogress greater, perhaps, than with 
the higher groups. Certainly is this the case if, as to l)ulk, the litera- 
ture in syst(»matic sand paheontology Ix^, alone taken into account. 

Of the Dipnoi our knowhHJge is fast becoming comi)lete. AVe kiiow

monstrous proposal to regard this animal, with its .56 paii-s of ribs.

and Pi'otoptcrii^, with its 30 to 85, us varieties of a specie's, it is the 
more interesting- to tindthat the Congo has hitely 3'ielded a Pi'otoptrinm 
{P. Dollof) with the k^pidosiren rib fonnida, viz, 54: pairs. 

As a foremost result of American paleontok)oical research we have 
to record the occurrence, in the Devonian of Ohio, of a series of 
colossal fishes known as the Arthrodira, the supposed dipnoan affinities 
of which are still a matter of douljt. 

A\^e have evidence that the osseous skeleton in a plate-like form first 
appeared as a protection for the eye of a primitive shark, and coming- 
to recent forms having special ])earings on the teachings of the rocks, 
we have to acknowledge the capture in the Japanese seas of a couple 
of ancient sharks, of which one {CladoNelachus), since ol)served to 
have a distribution extending to the far north, is a survivor from 
Devonian times; the other {Mlt,suhur/na)^ a genus whose grotesque- 
ness leaves no dou])t of its identity with the Cretaceous lamnoid 
^Sca pernor hyncJiits. In the elucidation of the Sturiones, and the deter- 
mination of their affinities with the ancient Paheoniscida^ a master 
stroke has been achieved. In the Old Red genus l^ahv.osipomlylKS we 
have become familiar with an unmistaka])le marsipobranch, possessing, 
as do certain living fishes, a notochord, anmdated, but not vertebrated 
in the strict sense of the term. The climax in Ichthyopaheontology, 
however, has been reached in the discovery of Silurian foi'ms, which 
there is every reason to believe explain, in an unexpected wa}^ the 
hitherto anomalous Pteras- and Cephalaspidians, by involving them 
in a conununity of ancestry with the primitive Elasmobranchs. The 
genera Thehxlus^ Dn-panaspis, Afeleaspls, and Zanarkh, chief among 
these annectant and ancestral forms, are among the most remarkable 
vetc})rate fossils known. 

Passing to the Recent fishes alone, the discovery which must take 
precedence is that of the mode of origin of the skeletogenous tissue of 
their vertebral column. The fishes, unlike all the higher Vertebrata, 
have, when young, a notochord invested in a dou])le sheath, there 
being an inner chordal sheath, an outer cuticular, which latter is alone 
present in all the higher groups. The skeletogenous cells, by whose 
activit}' the cartilaginous vertebral skeleton is formed, arise outside 
these sheaths; but whereas when proliferating they in one series 
rcmtiin outside, they in the other, ])y the rupture of the cuticular 
sheath, invade the chordal. This distinction enal>les us to discrimi- 
nate l)etwcen a Ch/mlal series, which embraces the Cliinueroids, Elas- 
mobranchs, and Dipnoi, and a Perickordal, consisting of the Teleosts, 
Ganoids, and Cyclostomes. 

In consideration of the enormity of the structural gap between tlio 
Cyclostomes and the higher Vertebrata this is an extraordinar3M'esult. 
For be it remembered that, in addition to their well-known characters.

the lampreys and hags (1) in the total a])sence of paired tins; (2) in the 
presence of branehia% ordinarih' 7 in num])er, l-i in Bdellodoma 
polytrema^ nuniericall}' variable in individuals of certain species 
between 6 and 14, and doul)tfully asserted in the young of one to be 
originall}" 35; and (3) in the carr^-ing up of their oral hypopophysis 
by the nasal organ, whereb}" it perforates the cranium from above, as 
contrasted with all the higher Vertebrata, in which, carried in with 
the mouth sac, it perforates it fi-om ])cneath, exhibit morphological 
characters of an extraordinary kind. And if we are to express these 
characters in terms we may distinguish the Cyclostomes as cqyteryglal 
and cpH-i'an'iate^ the higher Vertebrata as Jiypocraniate." But this, 
notwithstanding the aforementioned subdivision of the Pisces into 
two series, which would associate the teleosts and ganoids with the 
cyclostomes, as distinct from the rest, receives support from recent 
study of the head-kidney b}^ a Japanese, who seeks to show that the 
organ so called in the Elasmobranchs is of a late-formed tj^pe peculiar 
to itself, and it is also in agreement with one set of conclusions 
previously deduced from the study of the reproductive organs. 

To deal further with the fishes is impossible in this address, except 
to remark that recent discovery in the Gambia, that the young of the 
Teleostean genera lleterotis and GymriarcJms bear tilamentous exter- 
nal gills, renders significant beyond expectation the alleged presence 
of these among the loaches, and shows that adaptive organs of this 
t3'pe are valueless as ci'iteria of affinity. 

In paleontology, as in recent anatomy, our records of detail have 
increased beyond precedent, often but to shoAV how deficient in knowl- 
edge we are, how contradictory are our theories and facts. 

In dismissing the fishes, I wish to comment upon our accepted terms 
of orientation. To speak of the median fins as dorsal, caudal, and 
anal, of the pelvic as ventral, and of the pectoral in its varj-ing degrees 
of forward translocation as abdominal or thoracic, though a conven- 
tion of the past, is to-day inaccurate and absurd. I question if the 
time has not come at which the terms thoracic (pulmocardiac) and 
abdominal are intolerable, as expressing either the subdivisions of the 
body cavit}" or an^'thing else outside the Mammalia, which alone 
possess a diaphragm. Kven in the birds, to grant th(> utmost, the 
subdivision of the cd'lom. if accurately described, nuist be into pul- 
monary, hyper-pulmonary, and cardio-abdominal chambers, while 
with the reptiles the modes of subdivision are so complex that a special 
terminolog}' is necessary for each of the several types extant. 

^' It i^! an interesting circumstance, if their "ciliated sac" is rightly homologized, 
that ^l/;;;>/y/o.n(,s- and the Tunicata i)resent a corresponding dissimilarity, allowance 
being made for the fact that in Butrylhis, Cioodf^irid, and J'ohicdvjHi the sac overlies 
the ganglion. It is pertinent here to recall the ammoccete-Hke condition of the 
"endostyle" in Oikopleurajlahellum. 



MORPHOLOGICAL METHOD AND RECENT PROGRESS IN ZOOLOGY. 595 

In the fishes, where the pericardhiin is ulone sliut oli', the retcMitioii 
of the iiuunniiilian terms but hampers progress. This was indeed 
felt hy Dumeril when, .in 1>SH5, he attempted a revisionary scheme. 
Since, however, one less fantastic than his seems desiralile, 1 would 
propose that for tlu> future the ""anal"" lin be termed venti'al, the 
"ventral" pelvic, and that for the several positions of the pelvic, that 
immediately in front of the vent, primitive and eml)ryonic (which is 
the position for the Elasmobranchs, Sturiones, Lower Siluroids, and 
all the hioher Vertebrata), be termed proctal, the so-called ''aljdomi- 
naV pro-proctal, the so-called '"thoracic'' jug-ular (in that it denotes 
association with the area of the "collar ])one"), and the so-called 
"jugular"" mental. Th(^ necessity for this becomes the more desirable 
now that it is known that a group of Cretaceous fishes (the Ctenothris- 
sida'), hitherto regarded as Berjx-oids, are in reality of clupcoid 
affinity, despite the fact that at this t^arlv geologic period they had 
translocated, their pelvic fin into the jugular ("thoracic'"') position. 

The sum of our knowledge acquired during the last twentA'-eight 
years proves to us that among the bony fishes the structural combina- 
tion which would give us a premaxillo-maxillary gape dentigerous 
throughout, a proctal pelvic fin, a heart with conal valves, would be 
the lowest and most primitive. Inasnmch as this character of the 
heart, so far as at present known, exists only among the Clupesoces 
(pikes and herrings and their immediate allies), these must be regarded 
as lowly forms, wherefore it follows that the possession of but a single 
dorsal hn is not, as might appear, a necessary index of a highly modified 
state. 

Before I dismiss the vertebrates, a word or two upon a recent result 
of morphological iit(|uiry which concerns them as a whole. I refer to 
the development of the skull. Up to 1878 it was everywhere thought 
and taught that the cartilaginous skull was a compound of paired 
elements, known as the trabecuhv cranii and parachordals, and that 
the former contributed the cranial wall. Huxle}^ in 18T-I-, from the 
study of the cranial nerves of fishes, had reiterated the suggestion he 
made in ISOi, when dealing with the skidl alone, that the trabecuhy 
might be a pair of pra^-oral visceral arches, serial with those which 
support the luouth and carry the gills. The next step lay with the 
sturgeon, in which, in 1878, it was found that the cranial wall is orig- 
inall}' distinct. And latei', when the facts were mon; fully studied in 
sharks, ])atrachians, reptiles, and birds it became evident that the 
trabeculie, though ultimately associated with the cranial wall, take no 
share in its formation, and that when first the}' ap})ear they arc dis- 
posed at right angle's to the parachoixlals and the axis scM'ially with 
the visceral arches behind. Huxley was right, and although this con 
sideration by no means exhausts the cat(\gory of independent carti- 
lages now known to contribute to the formation of the skull, it proves 



596 MORPHOLOGICAL METHOD AND RECENT PROGRESS IN ZOOLOGY. 

that the cartilaginous cranium, like the bony one which in the hio'her 
vertebrate forms replaces it, is in its essence compound. 

I now pass to the invertebrata. Of the Oligocha^ta and Leeches I 
have spoken, and we may next consider the Arthropods. Of the 
Insecta our knowledge has gained precision by the conclusion that 
the primitive number of their Malpighian tubes is six, and b}^ the 
study of development of these in the American cockroach Doryphora^ 
which has rendered it proba])le they may be modified nephridia, carried 
in as are those of some oligochivtcs with the proctodeal invagination. 
An apparent cervical placenta has been discovered in the orthopteran 
Ileini'inerm^ which would seem to suggest homology with the so-called 
"trophic vesicle" of the Peripatoids, as exemplified by P. Novse- 
Brltannica. In this same orthopteran there have been recognized, 
in secondary proximity to the "lingua,"' reduced maxillula^, which, 
fully developed and interposed between the mandible and first maxilla, 
in Japyx^ Mavldlh^ Forficida^ and the Ephcincra larva, give us a fifth 
constituent for the insectan head. And when it is found that all the 
abdominal segments of the conn'non cockroach, when young, are said 
to bear appendages, of which the cerci are the hindermost, we have a 
series of facts which revolutionize our ideas. Little less striking is 
the discovery that in the caterpillar of the liombycine genera Lagan 
and Chrysoj)yga seven pairs of pro-legs occur. 

The fuller study of the apertures of the tracheate body has resulted 
in the discovery that the Chilopoda are more nearly related to the 
Hexapoda than to the Dij^lopods; wherefore it is proposed to reclas- 
sify the Tracheata, in accordance with the position of the genital 
orifice, into Pro- and Oj)istJiO-gonata. In a word the "Myriapoda," 
if a natural group, are diphyletic. 

Our knowledge of the Peripatoids {Arfhropoda vialacopoda) has 
increased in all that concerns distriliution and structure. The}^ are 
now known, for example, from Africa, the West Indies, Australia, 
and New Zealand, and for examples from the two latter localities and 
Tasmania the generic name Oojyei'ijx'dns has but lately been proposed, 
to include three species, characterized by the possession of an ovi- 
positor, of which two have been observed to la}" eggs. 

Work upon the Crustacea in our own land, notorious for the ten 
dencies of some of its devotees in their stickling for priority, has 
within the last twelve years advanced beyond all expectation. Much 
of our literjiturc has been systematized, and an enormous increase in 
our knowledge of new forms has to be admitted, thanks to memoirs 
such as those of the "Investigator,'' "Naples Zoological Station,'' and 
others which might be named; while in the discover}' and successful 
monographing, in the intervals of six years' labor at other groups, of 
a new family of minute Copepods (the Choniostomatida^), parasitic on 
the Malacostraca, eml)racing forty-three species, difficult to find, we 
have an almost unique achievement. The hand w^hich gave us this 



MOKPHOLOGICAL METHOD AND RECENT PROGRESS IN ZOOLOGY. 597 

has also provided a report which eiiihnices the description of a 
nauplius of exceptioimL type, which, by a process of reasoning- ))y 
elimination, masterly in- its niethod, has been ''run to ground ■" as in 
every degree of probability the larva of Darwin's apodal barnacle 
Protolejxm hivlncta^ of which only the original specimen is known. 

There is but one other crustacean record equal in rank with this, 
viz, the discovery of the genus Ana.'ipidex. Originally ol)tained from 
a fresh-water pool on Mount Wellington, Tasmania, at 4,000 feet, it 
has since l)een found in two other localities. It is uni([ue among all 
living forms, in com])ining within itself characters of at least three 
distinct suborders of "prawns," for Avith a schizopod body it com- 
bines the double epipodial lamella of an amphipod, th(^ liead of a 
decapod (pedunculated eyes and antennulary statocysts) apart from 
characters peculiarly its own. There is reason to I)elieA'e that the 
nearest living ally to this remarkable creature is a small eyeless species 
{BatJiyneUa natana) obtained from a Bohemian well; and if its pre- 
sumed relationships to the Paheozoic '"pod-shrimps'' I )e correct, this 
heterogeneous assemblage may perhaps l)e the rei)resentatives of a 
group of primitive Malacostraca, through which, ])y structural diverg- 
ence, the establishment of the higher crustacean sul)orders may have 
come about. 

It is pertinent to this to note that work upon cave dwelling and 
terrestrial forms, upon "well shrimps"'' and the like, has produced 
important results. And interesting indeed is the recent discovery of 
three species, living at 8(><) to 900 feet above sea level, in Gippsland, 
one an amphipod, two of them isopods, which, though surface dwell- 
ers, are all ])lind. While they prove to be species of genera normally 
eyed, they in their characters agree with well-known American forms; 
and the bleaching of their bodies and atrophy of their eyes proclaim 
them the descendants of cave-dwelling or subtei'ranean ancestors, 
among whom the atrophy took place. 

Iluxlev in ISSO rationalized our treatment of thi^ higlun' C'rustacea, 
by devising a classitication l)y gills, expressive of the relati()nsliii)s of 
these to the limb-bases, interarticular meml)ranes, and body wall. 
Hardly had his influence taken eft'ect when, by work extending over 
the years 18S(; to 18!>3, in the study of Pena'us, the riiyllopods, 
Ostracods, and other forms, evidence had Ixmmi accunndating to show 
that the crustacean appendag(% even to the mandible Itself, has prima- 
rily a basal constituent (protopodite) of three s(\gments: that the 
l)ranchiie one and all are originally ai)pendicular in origin; and that 
the numerical reduction of the basal (protopoditic) segments to two, 
with the assumption of a nonappendicular relationship ])y the gills, 
is due to coalescence of parts, wdth or without suppression. The e\i- 
dence for this (^poch-making conclusion, which simplifies our conc(^p- 
tions and brings contradictory data into line, is as ii-re.sistihie as it is 
important, and there has been nothing finer in the whole history of 



598 MORPHOLOGICAL METHOD AND RECENT PROGRESS IN ZOOLOGY. 

crustacean morphology. With it, the attempt to explain the supposed 
anomalous characters of the anteniuil(> by appeal to embryology goes 
to the wall; and. taking- a deep bi-eath, we view the Crustacea in a 
new light. 

There remains for l)rief consideration one carcinological discovery 
second to none which bear on the signiticance of larval foi'ms. It is 
that of the trilobite TrlartJirns Bevhi^ ol)tained in abundance from 
the Lower Silurian near New York, with all its limbs preserved. In 
the simplicity of its segmentation and the biramous condition of its 
limbs it is primitive to a degree. Chief among its characters are the 
total absence of jaws in the strict sense of the term, and the fact that 
of its three anterior pairs of appendages the tliird is certainly and the 
second is apparently Inramous, the tirst uniramous and antenniform. 
In this we have a combination of characters known only in the nau- 
plius larva among all living crustacean forms; and the conclusion that 
the adult trilobite, like that of the Euphausiacea, Sergestidte Penaiida^, 
the Ostracods, and Cirripedes of to-day, was derived by direct expan- 
sion of the nauplius larva can hardly bo doubted. Much 3'et remains 
to be done with the stud}" of the Triarthrus limbs; and the suggestion 
of a f oliaceous condition by those of the pygidium, which are the young- 
est, is a remarkable fact, the meaning of which the future must decide. 
We should expect the condition to be a provisional one, since while 
we admit the primitive nature of the phyllopods as an order, we can 
not regard the foliation of their appendages as anything hwt a special- 
ization. Be this as it may, the structural community lietween the 
nauplius larva and the trilobite is now proved; and when we add that 
in the yolk-bearing higher Crustacean types (e. g., Astacu-s) a percept- 
ible halt in the development may be observed at the three-limb- bearing- 
stage; that in Ift/s/s the vitelline membrane is shed but to make wa}^ 
for a nauplius cuticle; and that the median nauplius eye has long ])een 
found sessile on the adult brain of representative members of the 
higher crustacean groups, up to the lobster itself, our belief in the 
aricestral significance of the nauplius larval form is established l)eyond 
doubt. 

The thought of the nauplius suggests other larval forms. The gas- 
trula is no longer accepted without reserve; the claims of the ])histula, 
planula, parenchymella, not to say the plakula, have all to be borne 
in mind. It is of the Trochophore, however, as familiar as the nau- 
plius, that I would rather speak, as influenced by recent research. It 
is supposed to be primitive for the molluscs and cliietopod worms at 
least; and various attempts have been made to ])olstei' it up, and to 
show that if we allow for adaptive^ change, its chai'acters, well known, 
are constant within the limits of its simpler forms. 

It is now more than forty years ago that the late Lacaze-Duthiers 
described for Doiiidnnn a larv:d stage, characterized by the j)()sses- 



MORPHOLOGICAL METHOD AKD RECENT PROGRESS IN ZOOLOGY. 599 

sion of recurrently ciliatecl zones, which by reduction, with union and 
translocation forwards,' give rise to the trochal lol)e. It is now known 
that in th-e American pelccypod Vol did Jinuttula a siniihir stage is 
found, in v.diich a ''test'' of tiA'e rows of ciliated cells is present; and 
of the young of I><ni<l< rxhi Ixi mjuJcuxix i\w like is true. But whereas 
in the Yold'id the ciliated sac is ultimately shed, in the Myzomenian 
the escape of the eml^ryo is accompanied ))y rupture, which liberates 
the anterior series of ciliated zones in a manner strongly suggestive of 
forward concentration, Itniving the posterior circlet with its cilia 
attached. 

This "test'' has also been seen in two species of ±{vrnhi^ and pend- 
ing fuller in(|uiiy into the Myzomenian and a reinvestigation of Den- 
talium, I would suggest that this recurrently ciliated sac is represent- 
ative of a larval stage antecedent to the trocliophore, for which the 
term protrochal may suffice. This term lias indeed been already 
applicnl to a larva of certain Polycha'ta, which might well represent 
a modification of that for which J am arguing; and quite recent!}' it 
ai)pears to have been observed near Cevlon for a species of the genus 
2Ln'pJnjs<(. 

The discovery of this larva in Dondersia was accompanied hy that 
of a later-formed series of dorsal spiculai" })lates, which for once and 
for all, in realizing a chitonid stage, demolish the heresy of the 
" Solenogastres," mischi(>vous as suggesting an affinity with the worms. 
Like that of the supposed cephalopod affinities of the so-called " Pter- 
opods," it must be ignored as an error of the past. 

Returning to the protrochal stage, whatever the future may reveal 
concerning it, by bringing together the Lamellibranchiata, Scaphopoda, 
and Polyplacophora, it associates in one natural series all the l)ilater- 
ally symmetrical Mollusca except the cephalopods. In doing this, it 
deals the death l)low to the supposed Rhipidoglossan affinity of the 
Lamellibranchiata; and in support of this conclusion I woidd point 
out that the recently discovered eyes of the mytilids are in the posi- 
tion of those of the embryo CJiJtoii, and that just as J)<'/daJhiiii, in tiie 
formation of its mantle, passes through a lamellibranchiate stage, so 
are there lamelli])ranchs in munber in which a tubular investment is 
found. 

This protrochal larva has an important part to play. It may very 
possibly explain phenomena such as the compound nature of the tro- 
chal lobe of the limpet, the presence of a post-oral ciliated band in the 
larva of the shipworm, and of a pra'-anal one in that of various mol- 
luscan forms. In vic^w of it, we must hesitate before we fully accept 
the belief in the ancestral significance of the trochophore. And it is 
certain that an idea, at one time entei'taiiu^d, that the Rotifer {Tro- 
chosp/Ki'rd), which so clos<dy rescMubh's it as to bear its name, is its 
persistent repVesentati\(\ is wiong, since this is now known to bo but 
the female of a species ha\ ing a \ cry ordinary male.

Through the Rhipidoglossa we pass to the Gastropods, which are 
one and all as3'nimctrical, for even Flssm'eJla^ Patella^ and Dofis, 
when 3'oung-, develop a spiral shell; while Huxley in 1877 had observed 
that the shell of Ajdi/sia, in its asymmetry, betra3^s its spiral source. 

The notion, which until recentl}' prevailed, that among these gastro- 
pods the nontwisted or so-called euthyneurous condition of the visceral 
nerve cords, as exemplitied by the Opisthobranchs, is a direct deriva- 
tive of that of the Chitons, has l)een proved to ])e erroneous, since 
the nerves in Acia^on and ('Jiilina^ like those of the prosoljranchs, are 
twisted or streptoneurous. And as to the torsion of the gastropod 
body, recent research, in which one of mv pupils has played a part, 
involving the discovery of paired reno-pericardiid apertures in llali- 
otis^ Patella^ and TrocJms^ has resulted in proof that the dextral tor- 
sion which leads to the monotocardiac condition, does not uniformly 
affect all organs l3'ing primitively to the left of the rectum, as we have 
been taught; since, concerning the renal organs, it is the primitivel3^ 
(pretorsional) left one which remains as the functional kidnev, its 
ostium as the genital aperture. Nor is the primitively right kidne3^ 
necessarily lost, for while its ostium remains as the renal orifice, its 
body, 1)\^ modification and reduction, mav become an appendage of the 
functional kidnev, the so-called nephridial gland. And we now know 
there are cases of sinistral torsion of the visceral hump, in which the 
order of suppression of the organs is not reversed, the arrangement 
being one of adaptation of a dextral organization to a sinistral shell. 

Though thus specialized and as3'mmetrical as a group, the gastro- 
])ods are 3'et plastic to an unexpected degree. Madagascar has 3'ielded 
a Ph3^sa (/*. lioneUata) with a neomorphic gill, a character shared by 
species of PlanoiMs {P. corneus and P. marghutfuK), and an Ancylus 
in which the lung sac is suppressed; while St. Thomas Ishmd has 
given us a snail {ThyrojjJivrelJa tJtomcnsls)^ the peristome of whose 
shell is produced into a protective lid. 

In paleontology, history records the fact that in 1801 ITuxle3' 
o))served that the genus BeJehinHcfi appears to have borne but six free 
arms, a startling discover^" which la3' dormant till the present 3'ear. 
And the recent study of the fauna of the great African lakes, in ])ring- 
ing to light the existence of a halolimnic molkiscan series in Lake 
Tanganyika, has opened up now possil)ilities concerning the paleon- 
tological I'osources of enormous a<iu(M:)us deposits, recently discovered 
in the interior, and has entirelv changed our geological conceptions of 
the nature of equatorial Africa. 

Time prevents my dealing Avitli other groups, and it nuist suffice to 
say that witli those ] liave not considered su))stantial woi'k has Ijeen 
done. From what has ])een said, it is natural to expect that in some 
dir(>ction or another so vast an accunudation of facts nuist ha\"e 
extended the Darwinian teaching; and it is now quite clear that this

species, ])V specialization of the muscular system of the trunk oi' tail, 
or, as in the case of J\[<(l<(2>trnti'(is^ of ''tegumental glands/" In this 
we have a difficulty admitted by Darwin himself, wliicli now becomes 
clear and intelligil)le, since there is nothing n(Mv. There lias simi)ly 
come a])outthe conversion, in one case of the energy of muscular con- 
traction, in the other of glandular seci'etion, into tliat of (dectrical 
discharge, with accompanying structural change. The blind locust 
{PdcJiyridiiind fu^clfer) of the New Zealand lim(\stone caves ])res(Mits 
an allied case, since here, under the reduction of the ey<', the antenna', 
elongated to a remarkalde degive, have become the more efficiently 
tactile; and it is an interesting question whether this principU^ may 
not explain the attenuation of the liml)s in the recently discovered 
American proteoid {Tyj'/iloinohja rdlJihunu) of the Texan subtiM'ra- 
nean waters. 

And as to isomorphism, by which we mean the assum])tion of a 
similar structural state by nuMubers of diverse^ or independent groups, 
1 would recall the case of the Kocene C'reodont Pulrlofdix and the 
Seals, and that of the Myriapods to which I have already alluded, and 
would cite that of the Dinosaui's and Rirds, heterodox though i( may 
iippear. for reasons 1 have given. 

As our knowledge incr(^ases, there is evei'y I'eason to belie\e that, 
in the nonap|)i-eciation of tlu>se pi'inciples in the past, not a fiMV of 
our classitications are wrong. We have ev(Mi had our bogies, as, for 
example, the so-called Physemaria, which deceixcd the very (dect; and 
before I close 1 wish to diMil briefly with a t|uestion of serious doubt 
which these considerations suggest. 

It is that of the position in the zoological series of tlu^ Linudoids, 
])o])ularly termed the King ci-abs. These cnMitui'cs. best known fi-om 
th(» opposite shores of the noi'thei'n Pacilic, but found in the oi'iental 
s(>as as widl as far south as Toi'i'cs Strait, ha\ c Ikm'u since 1S20 the 
subject of a dilfei'ence of opinion as to their zoological })ositi()n and 
athnities. Within the last twcMity years there have been thrcu^ detci'- 
mined advances u])on them, and of these the third and most recent 
may be lii'st discussed. It has for its object the attem])t to ])ro\(^ 
that they are .intimately associated with tlu^ cephalaspidian and other 



602 MORPHOLOCJICAL METHOD AND RECENT PROGRESS IN ZOOLOGY. 

shield- lunirino- Ushcs of the Devonian and Sihirian epoeh.s, and that 
through them the}^ are ancestral to the Vertebrata. The latest phase 
of this idea is based on the supposed existence in a Ce}>h<tJ(ix}>ix of a 
series of twenty-live to thirt}' lateral appendages of arthropod type. 
When, however, it is found that the would-be limbs are ])ut the edg-es 
of body scutes misinterpreted, suspicion is aroused; and when, work- 
ing back from this, an earlier attempt reveals the fact that the author, 
compelled to lind trabecular, in order to force a presupposed compari- 
son between the architecture of the Cephalaspidian head shield and 
the Linuilus' prosonial hood, resorts to a comparison l^etween the 
structure of the former in general and that of the cornu of the latter, 
with details which on the piscine side are not to date, the argument 
iimst be condemned. It violates the tirst principles of comparative 
morphology, and is revolting to connnon sense; and as to the lishes 
concerned, we know that they have nothing Avhatever to do with the 
Linudoids, for we have already seen that, with their allies the Pteras- 
pidia;, they are a lateral l)ranch of the ancestral piscine stem. 

The second advance upon the King crabs has very nuich in common 
with the tirst. It has engrossed the attention of an eminent physiolo- 
gist for the last six or seven 3'ears, and by him it was in detail set 
before Section I at our meeting of 18iM). Suffice it to say that it specially 
aims at estal)lishing a structural conmuuiity between the king cral)s 
and certain vertebrates, favorable to the conviction that the vertebrata 
have had an arthropod ancestry. When we critically sui'vey the 
appalling accumulation of words l)egotten of this task, it is sufficient 
to consider its opening and closing phases. At the outset, under the 
conclusion that the vertebrate nervous axis is the metanior2)hosed 
alimentary canal of the arthropod ancestor, the necessity for tinding 
a digestive gland is mainly met by homologizing the so-call(^d li\ er of 
the arthropod with the cellular arachnoid of the larval lamprey, in 
violation of the first principles of comparative histology. \i the close 
we find ingenious attempts to homologize nerve tracts and commissures 
related to the organs of sense, such as are invariably present wherever 
such organs occur. Sufficient this to show that the coujparison, in 
respect to its leading features, is in the opening case strained to an 
unnatui'al degree, in the closing case no comparison at all. Finding, 
as we do, tiiat the rest of the work is on a pai' with this, \v(» are com- 
pelled to reject the main conclusion as unnatural and unsound; and 
when we seek the explanation of this rcmarka])le cours(> of action, we 
are forced tobeliev(> that it lies in the failure to unchu'staiid the nature 
of the m<)i[)hol()gi('al method. For the projx'r pursuit of comparative 
in()i))li()l()gy, it is not sulficient that any two organisms chosen here 
and there should b(> compared, with total disregard of (>v(mi elementary 
})rincii)les. Comparison should be first close and with neaily iclated 
foinis, passing later into larg(>r groups, with the progressive

eliiiiiiiatioii oi' tliosc chanjicters which arc found to he least con- 
stant. And necessary is it, aho\e all thino-.s, that in institutino- com- 
parison it should he tirst ascertained wh .t it is that constitutes a 
crustacean, a niarsipobranch, a c^^clostonie, and so on for the rest. 
We have tried to acc(>pt this theory, fascinated both by the arguments 
employed and by the idea itself, which for inuenuit}' it would be ditti- 
cult to ])eat, but we can not; and we dismiss it as misleading, as a 
fallacy, ])eg-otteh of a misconception of the nature of the morphologi- 
cal method of research. It is of the order of events which led Owen 
to compare a cc[)halopod and a verte})rate, led Lacaze-Duthiers to 
regard the Tunicata and Lam(dlibranchs as allied; and with these and 
other heresies it must he denounced. 

Passing to the third advance, extending over the last twenty years, 
it may be said to consist in the revival of a theory of 182!), which 
})oldly asserts that Linudus is an Arachnid. In the development of 
the d(>fense there have l)een two weak points ])ut lately strengthened, 
viz, the insufiicient consideration of the pal(\?ontological side of the 
([uestion and of the presence of trachea^ among the Arachnida. Under 
the former there was, until recently, assumed the a])sence of the tirst 
l)air of appendages in the Eurypterida; but it may be said that they 
have since been observed in E'>/r>/j)ft i'l/s p'sr/u't'/ of the Russia Silurian, 
and K KCoticK^t from the Pentland Hills, in both of which they consist 
of small chelate appendages Hexed and llmuloid in detail, somewhat 
reduced perhaps, and inclosed by the bases of the succeeding limbs, 
which l)ecome apposed as the anterior end is reached. Since by this 
discovery the Limuloids, Eurypterids, and Scorpionids are 1)rought into 
a numerical harmony of limb-])earing parts, we may at once proceed 
to other points at issue. So far as the broader structural plan of Lim- 
ulus and the Scorpion are concerned, all will agree to a general com- 
munity, except for the organs of respiration; but concerning the 
c(clom, the mobile spermatozoa, and the more detailed features under 
which Lumdous is held to diti'er from the Crustacea and to resemble the 
Arachnida, I would remark that while motile spermatozoa are charac- 
teristic of the Cirripedes, the rest of the argument is weakened, by the 
prol)ability that the "arachnidan''' characters which remain may well 
have ])een possessed ])y the crustacean ancestors, and that Limulus, 
though s])ecialized, being still an ancient form, might have retained 
them. The difficulty does not seem to mo to li(^ in this, nor with the 
excretory organs, if we are justified in accepting the aforementioned 
argument that tli(» so-called Malpighian tubes may be inturned neph- 
ridia, ectodermal in origin, and in knowledge of the existence of 
endodermal excretory diverticula in the Amphipods. Thes(» facts 
would seem to suggest that as our experience widens, diflerenccs of 
this kind will disappear. 



604 MORPHOLOGICAL METHOD AND RECENT PROGRESS IN ZOOLOGY. 

As to the tracheal system, now adequately recognized by the 
upholders of the arachnid theory, the presumed origin of trachea3 
from lung })ooks, the probability that the ram's-horn organ of the 
Chernetid^ ma}^ be tracheal, the presence of tracheae in a simple form 
in the Acari, and, by way of an anomaly, in a highly organized form 
on the tibise of the walking legs of the iiarvest men (Phalangidt^), are 
all features to be borne in mind. While I am prepared to admit that 
this wide structiu'al range and varied distril)ution of the trachese less- 
ens their importance as a criterion of affinity, I can not accept as 
conclusive the evidence for the assumed homology between lung l^ooks 
and gills. And here it may be remarked that a series of paired 
abdominal vesicles, recently found in the remarkable arachnid luBjien ia, 
invaginate as a rule, but in one example everted, seized upon in 
defense of this homology, have not been so regarded l)y those most 
competent to judge. 

There remains the entosternite, an organ upon wliich nuich empha- 
sis has been placed. Not onl}" does a similar organ exist, apart from 
an endophragmal system, in Ajjus, Lhjelops^ some Ostracods and Deca- 
pods: but, regarding the question of its histology, it may l)e pointed 
out that from all that is at present known the structural differences 
between these several entosternites do not exceed those between the 
cartilages of the Sepia body. And when it is found that the figures 
and descriptions of the entosternite of Mijiiale (" My gale sp. ," " M^^gal- 
omorphous Spider," <7^^c?^.) have been thrice presented upside down, 
the reliability of this portion of the argument is lessened, to saj^ the 
least. 

Recent observation has sought to clench the homology of the four 
posterior pairs of limbs of the King crab and Scorpion, by appeal to a 
furrow on the fourth segment in the former, believed to denote an 
original division into two; but I hesitate to accept this until myologi- 
cal proof has been sought. 

Returning, amidst so much that is problematic, to the sure ground 
of paleontology, 1 wish to point out that when all is considered in 
favor of the arachnid theory there still remains another way of inter- 
preting the facts. 

In both Linmlus and the Scorpion the first six of the eighteen seg- 
ments are well known to be fused into a prosoma l)earing the limbs, 
but while in the Scorpion the remaining twelve are free, in Linuilus 
they are united into a compact opisthosomal mass. In dealing with 
the living arthropods, there is no chiiract(M- determinative of position 
in the scale of this or that series more trustworthy than the antero- 
posterior fusion of segments. It has been called the process of 
" cephalisation,'' and tlu; degree of its l)ack\v'ard extension fui'iiishes 
the most reliable standard of higlmcss or lowiiess in a given assem-

hhiiic ot" r<>niis. Ill }):issiiij^- rroiii (lie lower to the liiiilicr C'rustticea, 
we find this fusion increiisiiiu- as we Hsceiid; and it theret'oro, 
l)ocoines necessarv to compare the Scorpion with tli(> other Arachnida, 
Limidus with tht^ Kurvptorifbi, in older the liettcn- to doterniine the 
position of eacli in its respective series ])y the a[)[)lication of this 
rule. 

As to the nunil)er of seeinents present, variation is a matter of small 
concern, in consideration of the mode of orig'in of segmentation and 
the Avide numerical range — from seven in the Ostracods to more than 
sixty in Apus - the st^gments of the crustacean class present. 

On the arachnidan side, in the Solifugte l)iit the third and fourth 
segments are fused; the remaining four of the prosomal series with 
the ten which remain are free. Tn Kn'iKiua four of the prosomal seg- 
ments alone unite; the fifth and sixth Avith the rest are free. And 
when we pass to the Limuloids and the descending series of their 
allies, we find it distincti^'e of the Eurypterida that all the opistho- 
somal segments are free. If we can trust thes<> comparisons, w^e must 
conclude that the Eurypterida of the past, in respect to their segmen- 
tation, simplify the Limuloid type, on lines similar to that on which 
the 8olifugi\3 and Kcenenia simplify the Higher Arachnid and Scor- 
pionid type, and that therefore if the degree of antero-posterior fusion 
of segments has the significance attached to it, L'ntmlnx and Scorpio 
must each stand at the summit of its respective series. If this be 
admitted, it has next to be asked if, in comparing them, we may not 
be comparing culminating types, which might Avell be isomorphic. 

The scorpions are known fossil by two genera, PaJceopJionus and 
Prof<cor2^tt/s^ from the Silurian of Gotland and Lanarkshire, the Pent- 
land Hills, and New York State; while recenf research, in the discov- 
ery of the genus Sfralwps, has traced the Eurypterida back to the 
Cambrian, leaving the scorpions far behind. One striking feature of 
the limbs of the Pala?ozoic Eurypterids is their constantly recurring- 
shortness and uniformly segmented character, long known in Sliino- 
nla^ and less conspicuously in Pferygotii.s itself, retained with devel- 
opment of spines in three of tive known appendages of the recently 
described eurypterid giant Styfonurns. The minimum length yet 
observed for these appendages is that of the Silurian species Euvup- 
terus fischerl^ discovered by Holm in Russia in 1S!)S. This creature 
is one of the few eurypterids in which all the api)endages are pre- 
served, and it is the more strange, therefore, that tiie advocates of the 
arachnid theory should ignore it in their most recent account. Allow- 
ing for the specialization of its sixth prosomal appendage for swim- 
ming, the tifth is but little elongated; the second, third, and fourth 
are each in total length less, by far, than the transverse diameter of 
the prosoma, and unifonnly segmented, giving the appearance of 



606 MORPHOLOGICAL METHOD AND RECENT PROGRESS IN ZOOLOGY. 

short antenna?. The}" seem to ])e seven jointed, iind are just sueh 
appendages as exist in the simpler erustacean and tracheate forms; 
and in the fact that their structural simplicity is correlated with the 
independence of the whole series of opisthosomal segments they lend 
support to the argument for isomorphism. 

With this conclusion we turn once more m the Scorpions, if per- 
chance something akin to it may not be in them forthcoming. The 
Silurian genus l\dn^ophonun^ especially as represented ])y the Gotland 
specimen, reveals the one character desired. Its body does not appear 
to be in any marked degree simpler than that of the living forms; but 
on turning to its limbs we find the four posterior pairs, in length 
much shorter than those of an}^ living species, all but uniformly seg- 
mented. In this they approximate toward the condition of the limits 
of the Eurypterida just dismissed, and their condition is such that had 
they been found fossil in the isolated state they would have been 
described as the liml)s of a Myriapod, and not of a scorpion at all. 
Indeed, their very details are what is required, since in the possession 
of a single terminal claw they differ from the limbs of the recent scor- 
pions as do those of the Chilopoda from the hexapods. 

With this the scorpionid type is carried back, with a structural sim- 
plification indicative of a parallelism with the other arthropod groups; 
and while the facts do not prove the total independence of the scor- 
pionid and linuUoid series they bring the latter into closer harmou}' 
with the Eurypterida of the past. They prove that the Silurian Scor- 
pions simplify the existing Scorpionid type on precisely the lines on 
which the Eurypterida simplify the Linudoid; and they do so in a 
manner which suggests that a distinction l)etween the Cradacea vera 
and the Crustacea glgcmtostraca (to include the Eur3'pterida and 
Xiphosura) is the nearest expression of the truth. It becomes therein' 
the more regrettable that in a recent revision of the taxonomy of the 
Linudoids the generic name CarcinoscorjnuH should have found a 
place. 

I foresee the objection that the anteiniiform condition of the shorter 
limbs may be secondary and due to change. There is no proof of this. 
Against it, it may be said that the number of the segments is normal, 
and that where nature effects such a change elongation is with the 
multiarticulate state the only process known; as, for example, with 
the second V^^^ of the Phrynida\ the so-calU^d second pareiopod of the 
Polycarpidea, and the last abdominal appendage of Apmudcx. 

That advances such as we have now considered should lead to new 
departures is a necessity of the case, and it but remains for me to 
remind you that within the last decade statistical and experimental 
methods have very properl}^ come more prominently into vogue, in the 
desire to solve the problems of variation and henHlity. Of the statis-

tical method, l)v no lueaiis now. I luno )>iit time to reeall to you the 
presidential address of IS'IS ]»y m}' friend and pred(H'essor in this 
cliair, himself a pioneer; and of the experlmcMital method T eaii but 
eite an example, and that a most satisfactory one, justifying- our con- 
tidence and support. It eoneerns the late Professor Milne-Edwards, 
who in lS()4r deseri])ed, from the Paris Museum, the head of a rock 
lol)ster {I'dl/HHnix 2><'>>(<''Uafns) havini;- on th(> left side an antenniform 
eyestalk. With the perspicuity distincti\e of his ]-ac(\ he argued in 
favor of the '* fundamental similarity of parts susceptible to revert to 
theii- o})posite states." The matter remained at this till, on the 
removal of th(> ophthalmite of certain Crustacea, it was found that in 
regeneration it assumes a uniramous multiarticulate form, and it is an 
interesting circumstance that in the connnon crayfish the biramous 
condition normal to the antennule may occur — an example this of a 
fact which nO other method could explain. 

When all is said and done, however, it is to the morphological 
method that 1 would appeal as most reliable and soimd. And when 
we tind (1) that in certain Compound Tunicates the atrial wall, in the 
Ggg d(>velopment delimited by a pair of ectoblastic invaginations, in 
the ]>ud development may be formed from the parental endodennic 
branchial sac; (2) that regenerated organs are by no means derivative 
of the l)lastemata whence they originally arose; (;')) that in the devel- 
opment of a familiar starfish the inner cells of the earliest S(>gmenta- 
tion stages, by intercalation among the outer, contribute half the fully 
formed blastula; (4) that thertMire Diptera in existence in which, while 
it is well nigh impossible to discriminate between the adult forms, 
there is reason to believe the pupa cases an^. markedly and constantly 
distinct, it becomes only too evident that the later embryonic and 
adult states are those most reliable for all purposes of comparison, 
and that it is by these that our animals can best be known and judged. 
Caution is, however, necessary with senility and age, since certain 
skulls have been found to assume at this period characters and pro- 
portions strikingly a1)normal, and l)y virtue of th(^ most important 
discovery, which we owe to the Japanese, that in certain Holothu- 
rians the calcareous skeletal deposits may so change^ with age as to 
render specitic diagnoses based on their pr(\sumed innnutability 
invalid. Advance, real and progressive, is in no de})artment of 
zoological inijuiry better marked than comparative morphology, and 
it is for the preeminence of this that I would plead. Educationalh^ 
it affords a mental discipline second to noin*. 

We live by ideas, we advance by a knowledgi' of facts, content to 
discover the meaning of phenomena, sinc(> the nature of things will 
be forever beyond our grasp.

crude state showed color and l)loom. It was also known that it was 
renewed by growth, for after several years it could again 1)e gathered 
from a place that had previously been raked and worked. Its appear- 
ance and growth seemed to indicate that it was really a tree — a special 
sort of vegetable that grew at the bottom of the sea. It was classed 
with other living forms of diverse characters: Gorgonias, Antipathes, 
Madrepores, curious alga' encrusted with calcareous matter, and these 
singular productions of nature were termed ''lithophytes," a name 
that accurately expressed the prevailing ideas concerning their nature. 
The}' were all nuich sought for. either as ornaments oi" as curiosities; 
but coral was l)y far the most valued. Its puiplish tint, its hardness, 
the luster and polish which it readily took on, gave it the preeminence. 

An Italian, Marsigli, who had ])een dri\en by political struggles 
into exile on the coasts of Provence, and his friend Reyssonel, a phy- 
sician of Marseilles, were the first to recognize, a century and a half 
ago, the real nature of coral. Their observations, though accurate 
and sagacious, were so at variance with the beliefs of that period that 
Reaumur, to whom they were submitted, would not accept them, and 
thought it charitable to advise their authors to be more circumspect. 
According to them, coral was neither a stone nor a marine plant.

610 CORAL. 

Their studies, especially those of Peyssonel, led them to consider it 
as an animal. Having- taken coral recently gathered, they put it in a 
basin filled with sea water and examined it with care. The arbores- 
cent stone was covered with a softer flesh, likewise colored red, and on 
that flesh were living numerous animalcula; provided with movable 
tentacles. These creatures really formed a part of the flesh which 
ensheathes the stone, producing it as the organism of man}' animals 
produce the mineral substance of their shell or their skeleton. Peys- 
sonel thus corrected one of the most serious errors of natursd history. 
He not only placed in its true position an important group of marine 
creatures, but also corrected a mistaken view which had led to search 
in the wrong field for connecting links between the two great kingdoms 
of nature. 

These investigations were so searching and thorough that an entire 
century passed before much was added to this discovery. It was 
about the middle of the last centur}' that our knowledge of coral was 
increased b}^ new acquisitions derived from the patient and persevering 
studies of an eminent French zoologist, H. de Lacaze-Duthiers, who 
has just left us after a life devoted wholl}' to science. From that time 
coral was understood. 

The red stone is nothing less than the skeleton produced hy minute 
animals, and serving for their support. Thanks to it they lift them- 
selves above the rock to which this skeleton is attached, and maintain 
themselves erect in the water which surrounds them. This skeleton 
is arborescent, and its tree- like appearance gave rise to the ancient 
error concerning its nature. It has a trunk fixed on a solid support 
and knotted branches that extend in ever}" direction. It is sometimes 
several feet in height and the thickness of its principal branches may 
be half an inch or more. Each trunk and branch carries, scattered 
over its surface, some millimeters apart, arranged without any 
apparent order, animals similar to each other, having the structure 
that characterizes the group of polyps. The bases of these creatures 
enlarge, thicken, and unite, forming by this union a sheet that sur- 
rounds the skeleton like a sheath, enveloping it wholly, following all 
its branches and nodosities. Together with the polyps, this is the 
living and fleshy portion, the "sarcosome" of the collection. Its 
internal surface is closely applied to the stony skeleton to which it 
gives origin; it produces it and continually secretes new la,}"ers in 
addition to those alrcnidy existing. These laj^errf are made of calcareous 
matter colored ]-ed by a special substance; the sarcosome secretes 
them as the mantle of a mollusk produces the shell that protects the 
animal. 

The structui'c of each ])olyp is \'ery simple. It is from 8 to 4 mm. 
in height and 2 to 8 mm. in diameter. Withdrawing at the slightest

him alone, he shares it with his neighbors. They subsist upon small 
creatures which are digested and rendered assimilable in the interior 
cavity of the body. The polyps annually produce eggs upon the thin 
septa which divide this interior cavity. After fecundation is accom- 
plished these eggs go on to develop without leaving the cavity, becom- 
ing free-swimming larva' resembling microscopic worms whose surface 
is covered with vibratile cilia. These embryos swim about in the 
maternal cavity, finally pass out of the mouth, abandon their singular 
shelter, and wander forth at random. These beings are of such 
elementary structure that one organ performs all their functions. 

Many of these larva' are pursued, seized, and eaten by marine crea- 
tures stronger than they. Those which escape fix themselves, after a 
period of vagabond existence, to a rock or a shell and there become 
modilied into polyps, growing external tentacles and internal septa. 
Then each polyp, far from remaining solitary, produces at its base 
expansions or buds which increase, develop, and in turn become 
polyps. This budding gives rise to a 3'omig colony, as yet minute and 
spread out over its support. The little sarcosome then commences to 
display its peculiar activity. It forms by secretion an outline of a 
calcareous skeleton, which it attaches to the support and constantly 
enlarges l)y the addition of new layers. On this it erects itself as on 
a protu])erance. The colony contiimes to bud, the sarcosome to 
increase and to deposit new calcareous matter. The skeleton enlarges, 
elongates, and ensheaths itself with sarcosome, which constitutes for it 
an axis of support, this term being often used to designate it. It 
ramifies. The polyp conununity thus aiises; it constantly increases, 
and it derives its oi-igin fi'om the minute lai'va engendei'cd by one of 
the polyps of a neighl>oring comnuimty.

Coral is thii.s the product of an animal association. It is not the 
only one; other inferior creatures belonging to the class of polyps 
sustain and protect themselves liy means of calcareous rods or envel- 
opes produced in the same' wa}". This is, however, one of the most 
characteristic and best known. Its history, save some variations of 
slight importance, applies to an entire group, and its principal interest 
depends upon the contrast between the weakness of the polyps and the 
great size of the polyp community. There, as everywhere, union is 
strength. The isolated individual counts for but little, but association 
and nuitual aid produce great results. Man often might searcli in 
nature, even among the most minute beings, for rules for his conduct. 



REINDEER IN ALASKA."

Twelve years ago Dr. Sheldon frackson hroiiglit his first h(U'd of 16 
reindeer across Bering Strait from Si))eria and started his reindeer 
coh:)ny at Unalaska, off the bleak coast of Ahiska. Many then smiled 
at the experiment ;ind dechired his plan for stocking the great barrens 
of northwestern Alaska with thousands of the animals which for cen- 
turies had been indispensable to the natives of Lapland and Sil)eria 
was impracticable and wasteful of time and good money. But the 
experiment prospered from the very first. Other reindeer, number- 
ing nearly l,fK)() in all, during the succeeding years were ])rought over 
from Siberia. To-day there are nearly 6,()()(> head in the various herds 
distributed along the Alaskan coast from Point Barrow to Bethel. 
The existence of the 80,000 natixes of northwestern Alaska, as well as 
the success of the miners who arel)eginning to throng into the interior 
of the Territory in the far north, are dependent upon thes(^ domestic 
reindeer; their clothing, their food, their trans})ortation, their uten- 
sils, and their shelter are all furnished them ])v the I'lMudeer. 

The reindeer entcn-prise is no longer an experiment, although still in 
its infancy. There are 400,000 sipiare miles of barren tundra in 
Alaska where no horse, cow, sheep, or goat can find pasture; but 
everywhere on this vast expanse of frozen land the reindeer can find 
the long, fibrous, whit(> moss which is his food. There is plenty of 
room for 10,000,000 of these hardy animals. The time is coming 
when Alaska will have great reindeer ranches like the great cattle 
ranches of the Southwest, and they will be no less profitable. 

The story of the inception and growth of the reindeer enterprise in 
Alaska is very interesting and is not generally known. During an

extended trip of inspection of the missionaiy .stations and Government 
schools in Alaska in the summer of 1890," Dr. Sheldon Jackson was 
impressed with the fact that the natives in arctic and subarctic Alaska 
were rapidly losing- the sources of their food supply. Each year the 
whales w^ere g'oino- farther and farther north, beyond the reach of the 
natives, who had no steamships in which to pursue them; the walrus, 
which formerly had Ijeen seen in herds of thousands, were disappear- 
ing-; the seals were becoming- exterminated, and in winter the Eskimo 
had to tramp 15 to 20 miles out on the ice before he could catch one. 
The modern hunter, with his steam launches and rapid-fire guns, had 
found the w^hales, walrus, and seals such easy pre}^ that he was ruth- 
lessly destroying- them. Also the wild caribou, that the native had 
easily captured before, had been frightened away and was rarely seen. 

Not only was the P^skimo losing his food, but w^hat in an arctic cli- 
mate is no less important, his clothing as well. The whalebone, the 
ivory tusks of the walrus, the seal skin, and the oil had given him 
means of l)arter with the Siberian traders across the strait, from whom 
he obtained reindeer skins to keep him warm in winter. 

Dr. Jackson saw that unless something was done at once the United 
States would have to choose between feeding- the 20,000 and more 
natives or letting them starve to death. The latter course was impos- 
sible, the former rather expensive, as supplies would have to be carried 
some 8,000 miles from Seattle. The more enterprising Siberian, liv- 
ing-" on the opposite side of the strait under practically the same condi- 
tions of arctic cold, got along- very nicely, as he had great herds of 
domestic reindeer to fall back upon when game was scai'ce. The same 
moss which covered so man}- thousands of miles of the plains of arctic 
Siberia was seen everywhere in Alaska. The tame reindeer of Siberia 
was practically the same animal as the wild caribou of Alaska, changed 
by being domesticated for centuries. Could not the Eskimo be made 
self-supporting by giving him reindeer herds of his own? 

On his return to the ITnited States in the winter of 1891 Dr. Sheldon 
Jackson, in his annual report to Congress, asked for an appropria- 
tion to provide the money for importing a few deer. Congress was 
not convinced of the wisdom of such action, but several private per- 
sons were so interested that they placed $2,000 at Dr. Jackson's dis- 
posal to begin the experiment. The first deer were brought over that 
year. It was not long, however, before the Oovei-nment realized the 
importance of the movement, and in 1891 appropriated the sum of 

« Dr. Sheldon Jackson first visited Alaska in 1877, in the interest of schools and 
missions. He made a second trip in 1879. Other visits followed, and since his 
appointment as jjeneral ajjent of edncation in Alaska in 1885 he has made annnal 
visits to the Territorv.

$6,000 to continue tlie work. Later the appropriation was increased, 
and durino- the last severat years has amounted to $25,000 annually/' 

The Siberians were at Hrst unwilling to part with any of their rein- 
deer. The}' were superstitious and, above all, afraid of competition 
and loss of trade across the strait. In 1891 Capt. M. A. Healy, Revenue- 
Cutter Service, commandino- the U. S. S. Thetis, was instructed to 
convej' Dr. Sheldon Jackson to Siberia and furnish him every possi))le 
facility for the purchase and transportation of reindeer from Siberia 
to Alaska. 

In carr^'ing- out these instructions Captain Heal}^ was obliged to sail 
from village to village for 1,500 miles along the Siberian coast before 
he found an owner willing to barter his reindeer for American goods. 
None would sell the deer for cash. Of recent years the Siberians 
have been but little less reluctant to part with their deer, though they 
could easily spare many thousands from their vast herds without 
knowing it. 

The first deer brought over were from the Chukches herds— a tough 
and hardy breed. Two yenvH ago Lieutenant Bertholf, Revenue- 
Cutter Service, was commissioned to go to Siberia and to purchase some 
of the Tunguse stock, which are larger, stronger, and sturdier. Start- 
ing from St. Petersburg, after a long journey across Sil)eria, nuich of 
it bj^ sled, he succeeded in purchasing several hundred Tunguse rein- 
deer near Ola, hired a steamer, embarked the reindeer at Ola with 
2,500 bags of reindeer moss, and iinally landed 200 of the animals in 
good condition at Port Clarence. His experiences during his remark- 
able journey were most interesting, and are admira])ly described in 
his report to Dr. Sheldon Jackson, published in 1902.''

which Dr. William T. Harris is the distinguished head; the formulation of ])lans and 
their execution is intrusted to Dr. Sheldon .Jackson, general agent of education in 
Alaska. Dr. Harris, in his annual reports to Congress, has vigorously urged the 
importance of the work, and U> him credit is due for a large share of its success.

THE ESKIMO AS HERDERS. 



With careful training- tlie Eskimo make excellent herders. Thej-^ 
are by nature good imitators, though not inventive, and readily learn 
how to take care of the reindeer, to throw the lasso, to harness and 
drive the deer, and to watch the fawns. Siberian herders were at 
first imported to teach them, and later the more intelligent and effi- 
cient Laplanders, who have learned by centuries of experience to give 
to the breeding of reindeer the care that we give to the breeding of 
cattle. In the winter of 1898 sixty-three Laplanders and their fami- 
lies volunteered to go to Alaska, the United States GoAermiient pa}-- 
ing' the expenses of their long journey of 10,000 miles. When their 
term of enlistment expired some reenlisted, some of them went home 
again, ])ut the majority turned miners. Evervone will ])e glad to 
know that at least two-thirds of the whole number made fortunes in 
the Cape Nome gold fields. 

The reindeer herders have to l)e watchful. Now and then reckless 
miners try to plunder the herds, or l)y their carelessness set fire to the 
moss. A fire will sweep over the moss barrens, licking up every fiber 
of the moss, as it sweeps over our westei'n prairies. A moss fire is 
even more destructive, for many years pass before the moss will grow 
again. 

At the end of a year's service the Government makes a gift to 
deserving herders of two or more reindeer. 

REINDEER RAISING AS AN INDUSTRY. 

When one considers that raising- reindeer in Alaska is simple and 
the profits enormous, one is surprised that as yet no one has really 
gone into the reindeer business, especially at Nome, where a rich 
market awaits the reindeer farmer. 

A fawn during the first four years costs the owner less than $i a 
3^ear. At the end of the four years it will bring at the mines from 
$50 to $100 for its meat, or if trained to the sled or for the pack, is 
easily worth $100 to $150. 

The fawns are ver}' healthy and but few die. The do(\s are prolific, 
and after they are 2 3"ears of age add a fawn to the herd each year 
for ten years. Last year, out of 50 does 2 years and more of age in 
one herd, 48 had fawns, and of these only five died, three of which 
were lost through accidents or by the carelessness of the herder. 

The reindeer are so gregai-ious and timid that one herder can easily 
g-uard 1,000 head. The hercfer knows that if a few stray off he need 
not look for them, as they will soon become frightened and rejoin the 
main herd. 

The does make almost as good sled deer as the bulls and geldings, 
though they are slightly smaller and less enduring.

The Chukchos deer cost in Siberia about |4 a head for a full-g-rown 
doe or buH. The fawus Irorii in Alaska are larovr and heavier than 
the parent stock. The Tunu-use deer cost nearl}^ $7.50 apiece. By 
the addition of the Tuno-u.se breed it is hoped tliat the Ahiska stock 
will be improved and toughened. 

The reindeer cow gives about one teacupf ul of ver}- rich milk, nearly 
as thick as the best cream, and making delicious cheese. Mixed with 
a little water, the milk forms a refreshing drink. The Sil)erians and 
Laplanders save the blood of slaughtered deer and serve it in powdeivd 
form. From the sinews tcnig-h thread is obtained.

The Alaskan reindeer can hai;dly eiiual the speed of the Lapland 
deer, which Paul I)u Chaillu " describes as making- from 150 to 200 
miles a day, and sometimes 20 to 25 miles down hill in a single hour. 
A pair of them can pull a load of 500 to 7oO pounds at the rate of 35 
miles a day and keep it up weeks at a time. W. A. Kjellmann drove 
his reindeer express one winter 95 miles in a single day. 

In the winter of 1S91> and 1900, between St. Michael and Kotzel)ue, 
under the Arctic Circle, and between Eaton and Nome, Alaska, and 
in the winter of 19<)1 and ]902, between Nome and Candle, on the 
Arctic Ocean, the United States mails were carried with reindeer 
teams. ^ Upon the latter route the teams had heavy loads of passen- 
gers and freight and made the distance in eight days. Dog teams 
would have required tifteen to twenty days for the trip. 

The reindeer can travel at night as well as in the daylight, and thus 
during the long arctic night, when dogs are inefficient, transportation 
is always possible with a reindeer team. 

The reindeer make good packei-s in summer. One hundred and 
fifty pounds is a fair load. They also can l)e ridden in the saddle, but 
not with nuich comfoi't until the rider learns how to adjust himself. 
In the Tunguse country the natives use their deer in sunnner as we 
would a mule or horse. It is no unconunon sight to see a Tunguse 
trotting along the shore deerback. 

Lieutenant Rertholf describes the caravans of reindeer sleds in 
northeastern Siberia. Over 1,000 sleds leave Ola during the winter 
in cara\ans of about lOO each. A caravan of 100 sleds is managed by 
10 men. Some years ago the Ilussian (unernment used horses on the 
caravan route from Ola to the Kolinia River, but recently substituted 
reindeer, and now saves $60,000 yearl}' by the change.

& Since the above was written the United State-s Government has given a contract 
to Mr. S. R. Spriggs, of Point P>arrow, Alaska, to carry the winter mail l)etwecn 
Kotzebue and P>arro\v with reindeer teams. This is the most northern mail route;

The illustration, Figure 2, PL VI, .shows the leaders of Lieutenant 
Bertholf 's party l)reaking a path through snow that reached to the 
belly of the deer. A strong wir}' deer, unmounted, was driven first. 
In the deep snow lie could advance only by jumps, but his leaps broke 
the way somewhat for the next few deer, who were also unmounted. 
After a dozen or more unmounted deer had passed T)}', deer ridden b}" 
a bo}' and girl broke the path still further until deer with heavy 
loads could pass. Lieutenant Bertholf in this way broke his path for 
160 miles through the deep snow. 

When the caravan halts the deer are turned out to pasture untethered 
and allowed to wander as they will. The driver uses a switch to touch 
up the slothful, but "some of the old deer do not seem to mind a 
switch any more than does an army mule.'- 

The illustration, Plate XI, shows 'a number of reindeer digging up 
the snow with their powerful hoofs to get at the moss beneath the 
snow. As soon as spring comes the deer abandons his diet of moss, 
which seems to be most nutritive in winter, for willow sprouts, green 
grass, and mushrooms. The hoof of the reindeer is as wide as that of 
a good-sized steer and prevents him from settling down into damp 
snow or miry soil. 

KEINDEER LOANED BY THE (JOVERNMENT. 

The United States Govei'nment loans a certain number of the rein- 
deer to the mission stations, or to individuals who have shown their 
ability, reserving the right, after three or live years, of calling upon 
the mission station or the individual for the same numlier of deer as 
composed the original herd loaned. In 1891 the Congregational mis- 
sion at Cape Prince of Wales was granted the loan of 100 deer. The 
mission has since paid l)ack the loan, and now possesses in its own 
right 1,000 head. 

A few of the herds, notably that at Cape Prince of Wal(\s, have 
grown so large that the owners are al)le to kill oti' some of the extra 
males for food for the families of the herders and to sell others to the 
l)utchers in the neighboring mining camps. Last year deer for slaugh- 
ter brought at some of the mining cami)s from $(50 to $100 each, while 
for male deer trained to harness miners gave as much as §150 apiece. 
The herders at this same station earned last winter $()00 in gold for 
freighting with their reindeer to the mining camps. The deer were 
work(Ml in (loul)le trace harness like horses, and hauled on sleds 7'.>0 
pounds each. 

Of the (10 individual owners of domestic reindeer in Alaska to-day 
11 are Eskimo. Most of them have served a live-year ai)prenticeship, 
and having earned their deer are competent to care for them. 

Each owner has his own individual mark, which is l)raiided on (he 
left or riiiht car of each of his deer.

The Huivau of Kducation h()p(\s that in time oacii mission station will 
possess a herd of at least 5,(i(>() head. A reindeer herd at a mission 
station in arctic or sul)arctic Alaska means, says Dr. Jackson: 

'"First. The permanence^ of th(^ mission. Without it the natives 
are away from home a laroer portion of the year in search of food, 
and, since the ad\ent of the miners, are inclined to leave their homes 
and congreoate in the American villages at the mines, where they live 
by begging" and immorality and soon disap|)ear from the face of the 
earth. 

"Second. It ati'ords the missionary the opportunity of rewarding 
and encouraging those families that give evidence of being teachable 
by establisliing them in the reindeer industry, and thus greatly pro- 
moting their material interests. 

"Third. With the increase of the herd it ))ecomes a source of reve- 
nue through the sale of the surplus males at remunerative prices to 
the miners and butchers. In a few years this revenue should be suf- 
ficient to entirely support the mission and thereby relieve the treasury 
of the central missionary society. 

"Fourth. The possession of a herd insures to the mission family 
a continuous supply of fresh meat. This, to a family which is com- 
pelled to li\e largely upon salted and canned meats and caimed vege- 
tables, is of no small benetit, promoting their comfort, health, and 
usefulness. 

"Fifth. Reindeer trained to harness and sleds greatly increase the 
efficienc}" and the comfort of the missionary in ministei'ing to outlying- 
native settlements."' 

REINDEER FROM EAEEAND. 

The vast majority of the American people have an idea that the 
reindeer exi)eriment in Alaska provi^l a failure long ago, simply 
because of the widely advertised attempt in 1S!»S. 

In December, 1897, rumors were started that American miners in 
the Yukon ^"allev were in danger of starvation. Congress appropri- 
ated a large sum for their relief, and commissioiKKl Dr. Sheldon Jack- 
son to go to Norway and Sweden to yjurchase r)(>0 rcMiideer broken to 
the harness, with sleds, harness, and drivers, foi- hauling supplies from 
the head of Lynn Canal to the d(\stitute minei's. l,(i(i(i miles away. 

Dr. Jackson reached Bosekop, Lapland, in January, purchased Hiiti 
trained deer, gathered 08 Lapp drivers with theii- families, emt)arked 
them all on one ship, and sailed for New York from Trondhjem Fel)- 
ruary 4. Only oik^ deer died on the voyage of tw(Mity-four days, 
though the trip was a most tempestuous one, and the (h'ci- in jxmis on 
the deck were drenched day and night b^^ the seas that brok(^ over 
them. At New York special trains met i\w expedition and carried 
them across the continent to Seattle without th(^ loss of a single deer. 
Then the troubles began. The supply of moss I)rought from Norway 
became exhaust,ed; and the deer did not like the grass of Seattle. There

was dela}^ in securing a vessel to transport the expedition to the head 
of Lynn Canal, and further dela3^s at Lynn Canal and no moss to be 
found there. 

Nearly 300 of the reindeer died of starvation after reaching the coast 
of Alaska, because of the failure of the Government to have readj^ 
suitable arrangements for pushing the herd from the seashore to the 
moss fields at the head of Chilkat River, 50 miles distant. The remain- 
ing 200, weakened by starvation, were driven to the Yukon Valley l)y 
easy stages, and the relief expedition was abandoned, but, fortunately, 
not before the country had learned that the miners in the Yukon had 
abundant supplies and that the relief expedition had been unnecessaiy. 
The Laplanders who had been l)rought over were distriljuted among 
the reindeer stations and employed to teach the natives. 

This expedition to Lapland was in no way connected with the gen- 
eral plan of introducing domestic reindeer into Alaska. The reindeer 
procured by it were all geldings trained to harness. The reindeer for 
breeding purposes have all ])een brought from Siberia. 

REIJEF OF WHALERS AT POINT BARROW. 

The first forcible realization of the wisdom of the Government in 
stationing reindeer herds in Alaska came to the American people in 
the winter of 1897-98. In the fall of 1897 word was received that 
eight whaling ships had been imprisoned in the ice near Point Barrow, 
and that the 400 American seamen aboard were stranded without food 
for the long winter till the ice should open in July. No vessel of 
relief could get within 2,000 miles of the party, or nearer than Denver 
is to Boston. There was no known method by which provisions could 
be dragged overland. If the Government had not Hve 3'ears before 
commenced the introduction of the reindeer, most of these -iOO men 
would have starved to death before help reached them. Fortunately, 
there were large herds of reindeei' at Cape Nome and at Cape Rodne}', 
over 1,000 miles l>y land from Point Barrow, or farther than Chicago 
is from New York. The Government hurried the revenue-cutter Hcm'^' 
north from Seattle, carrying three ])rave volunteers — Lieut. David H. 
Jarvis, Lieut. Ellsworth P. Bertholf, and Dr. Samuel J. Call. The 
three men were landed December 16, 1897, at Cape Vancouver-, obtained 
some dog teams from the natives, and conunenced their dreary journey 
of 2,000 miles through the arctic night to Point Barrow. They collected 
al)out 450 reindeer from the herds at Rodney and Nome, and then, with 
reindeer instead of dog sleds, and with Mr. W. T. Lopp, agent of the 
American Missionary Society at Cape Prince of Wales, and Charlej" 

«For twenty years the revenue-clutter Bear has been engaged in Arctic work. It 
has saved the Hves of hundreds of wrecked whalers, and contributed more to the 
comfort and safety of the settlements along the Alaskan coast tjian any vessel in the 
service.

Arisartook, ;i nativ(\ iuid several herders, they pushed on throuoh 
the storms and ])itter eold of an arctic winter, driving- the deer before 
them. After a journey of three months and twelve days, on March 
29, 1898, they reached the destitute whalers, just in time to save them 
from great sutfering- and death. 

In heroism, pluck, and endurance the journey of these men has 
rarely been equaled. Congress voted its thanks to the gallant res- 
cuers and awarded them special medals of honor, but in the excite- 
ment aroused throughout the countr}' ])y the rapid succession of events 
of the Spanish- American war their work was almost unnoticed. 

Since that time a reindeer herd has been kept at Point Barrow, so 
there is no longer danger of ice-imprisoned whalers perishing from 
starvation. The experience also showed the faithfulness of the 
Eskimo. Mr. Lopp had left his wife at the station, the onh^ white 
person among lOo natives, but during* his absence of nearly five 
months she received nothing but constant courtesy and kindness from 
them. 

DEVELOPMKNT OF ARCTIC AND SUBARCTIC ALASKA DEPENDENT ON THE 

REINDEER. 

The original motive in bringing the reindeer to Alaska was purely 
philanthropic — to give the native a permanent food supply. 

Since then the discovery of large and valuable gold deposits upon 
the streams of arctic and subarctic Alaska has made the reindeer a 
necessity for the white man as wqU as for the Eskimo. Previous to 
the discovery of gold there was nothing to attract the white settler to 
that desolate region, Init with the knowledge of valual)le gold deposits 
thousands will there make their homes, and towns and villages are 
already springing into existence. 

But that vast region north of the arctic circle, wdth its perpetual 
frozen sul)soil, is without agricultural resources. (Iroceries, )>i'ead- 
stuft's, etc., must be procured from the outside. Steamers upon the 
Yukon can bring food to the mouths of the gold-bearing streams, but 
the mines are often many miles up these unnavigable streams. Already 
great difhculty is experienccnl in securing sufficient food ))v dog-train 
transportation and the packing of the natives. The development of 
the mines and the growth of settlements upon streams hundreds of 
miles apart necessitate some method of speedy travel. A dog team on 
a long journey will make on an average from 15 to 20 miles a day, and 
in some sections can not make the trip at all, ))ecause they can not 
carry with them a sufficient supply of food for the dogs, and can pro- 
cure none in the country through which the}' travel. To facilitate 
and render possible frequent and speedy communication between these 
isolated settlements and growing centers of American civilization, 
where the ordinary roads of th(^, States have no existence and can not

1)0 iiiaiiitaincd, excoi)t iit an enormous expanse, roindetn' teams that 
re(|uire no beaten I'oad.'^, and that at tlie close of a day's work can l)e 
turned loose to t'ora^'e for themselves, are essential. The introduction 
of reindeer into Alaska makes possil)Ie the development of the mines 
and support of a million miners. 

The reindeer is to the far north what the camel is to desert regions, 
the animal which God has provided and adapted for the peculiar, 
special conditions Avhich exist. The greater the degree of cold, 
the better the reindeer thri\es. Ltist winter a party with a reindeer 
team made a day's journey with the temperature at 73"" l)elow zero. 
On a long- journey thi'ough an uninhabited country a dog team can 
not haul sutHcient provisions to feed themselves. A deer with '200 
pounds on the sled can travel up and down the mountains and over the 
plains without a road or trail from one end of Alaska to^the other, 
living on the moss found in the country where he travels. In the four 
months' travel of 2,000 miles, from Port Clarence to the Kiiskokwim 
Valley and back, by Mr. W. A. Kjellmann and two Lapps, with nine 
sleds, 1890-07, the deer were turned out at night to find their own 
provisions, except upon a stretch of the Yidvon Valley below Anvik, a 
distance of 40 miles. 

The great mining interests of central Alaska can not I'ealize their 
fullest development until the domestic reindeer are introduced in suf- 
ficient numbers to do the work of supplying the miners with provi- 
sions and freight and giving the minei- speedy connnunication with 
the outside world. 

The reindeer is equally impoi'tant to the prospector. Prospecting 
at a distance from the ])ase of supplies is now impossible. The pros- 
pector can go onl}^ as far as the 100 pounds of provisions, blankets, 
and tools Avill last, and then he must return. With ten head of rein- 
deer, which he can manag(> single handed, packing 10«) pounds each, 
making half a ton of supplies, he can go for months, piMieti'ating 
regions hundreds of miles distant. 

FUTURE OF REINDEER INDUSTRY. 

Even if no moi-e reindeer are imported from Siberia, if the present 
rate of inc;rease continues, doubling every three years — and 
there is no reason why it should not — within less than twenty-tive 
years there will ])e at least 1.(>0(),(H)0 domestic reindeer in Alaska. 
This is a consei'vative estimate* and allows for the deer that die from 
natural causes and for the many that will be slaughtered for food. 
In thirty-tive years the muuber may reach nearly 10,000,000 head and 
Alaska will l)e shipping each year to the TnitcHl States anywhere 
from 500.000 to 1,000.000 reindeer carcasses and thousands of tons of 
delicious hams and tongues. At no distant day, it may l)e safely 
predicted, long reindeer trains from arctic and subarctic Alaska

[While the jilan of tliis article, an<l especially tiie introductory and concluding 
paragraphs, is original, tlie rest is largely adapted and extracted from an article in 
Harper's Monthly Magazine for March, 1902, by Professor Osborn, for some time 
president of the trustees of the Marine Biological Laboratory, suijplenn'nted by 
extracts from the ninth rejiort of the Marine Biological Laboratory ff)r the years 
1896-1899, and from Prof. E. G. Conklin's article in Science, March 2, 1900.] 

The prevailing spii-it sit Woods Hole is the spirit of exploration. 
The pnre delio-ht of discovery sustained Darwin in his classic voyage 
on the BciKjle and Iliixley in his cruise on the Rdtth'smil-c. These 
great names indorse the statement that even in themselves, from the 
simple natural history standpoint, the phenomena of marine life are 
worthy of intimate and ardent study. But Darwin is forever famous 
not cliieHy for his liiV-long natural history observations, hut for tiie 
grand theory gleaned therefrom — the theory of evolution by means of 
natural selection; and the most enduring monuments to Huxley are 
not oidy his brilliant contributions to S} stematic zoology, but espe- 
cially his clear statement of all life phenomena as essentially protoplasm 
l)henomena. Accordingly the spirit of exploration at Woods Hole 
manifests itself in the sinudtaneous pursuit of {n) natural history and 
evolution, and (/>) l)iology, the study of the nature of life itself as 
found in protoplasm. 

The enthusiasm for natural history at the Marine Biological Labo- 
ratory is in part an inheritance from Ix)uis Agassiz, who may l)c 
considered in a sense as its foimder. With Carl Vogt, of (Jeneva, 
Huxley, Dohrn, and other great naturalists, Agassiz realized the 
important residts which would How from the study of marine life in 
the living and fresh condition allorded oidy by a close proximity to 
the seashore. This idea ha[)p!ly culminated in 1S7<>, when I'rof. Anton 
Dohrn foimded the beautiful and resourceful station of Niii)les — the 
great Mecca of all students of marine life. 

Agassiz brought with him, therefore, to Ameiica, ah)ng with his 
other enthusiasms that for marine stations. In 1ST8 an ekKjuent

address of his cuvight the eye of a New York mercliant, Mr. John 
Anderson. Our first seaside laboratory was established on the little 
island of Penikese, off the coast of Massachusetts, and for one mem- 
orable season a orouj) of men who have since exerted a profound 
influence upon natural history worked under this inspiring master. 
All have become leaders, but notal)ly A. Agassiz, Brooks, Jordan, 
Lyman, Mayer, Morse, Putnam, Whitman, and Wilder. "Study 
nature, not books" and other mottoes embodying Agassiz's Socratic 
theor}^ of teaching zoology adorned the walls of this plain pine 
building, and have fortunately been preserved to perpetuate their 
influence at Woods Hole. After a second season, following the death 
of Agassiz in December, 1873, this laboratory, somewhat too isolated, 
as it proved, was abandoned. All the credit for reviving the work 
belongs to Boston, especially to a number of ladies, Avho, in financial 
cooperation with Professor Hj^att and the Boston Societ}' of Natural 
History, founded a new laboratory at Annisquam, wdiich in 1888 was 
finally transplanted to Woods Hole. With Prof. C. O. Whitman, 
one of the distinguished pupils of Agassiz, as its director, and with 
the Penikese mottoes upon its walls, we may thus consider Woods 
Hole as the offspring of the Anderson school. Prof. Charles L. 
Minot, of Harvard, and Mr. Edward G. Gardiner, of Boston, have 
been active in its support. But the administration has gradually 
become thoroughly national in character, including representatives of 
all the larger Eastern and Western universities. 

Almost midway between the island of Marthas A^ineyard and the 
mainland, and separating Buzzards Ba}^ from Vineyard Sound, is the 
long chain of the Elizabeth Islands, wdiich are strung out from 
the southwestern extremity of Cape Cod. W^oods Hole is situated at 
the apex of this extremity and just at the beginning of the chain. Of 
all points along the coast this is the best adapted physically for a sea- 
shore laboratory. About ten years after the abandonment of Penikese, 
Spencer F. Baird selected this spot after having investigated almost 
every available point on the Atlantic coast Here he succeeded in 
establishing the splendid station of the United States Fish Conuuission, 
with its fleet of vessels and extensive laboratory facilities, designed 
for the investigation and artificial culture of all cdilJe forms of sea 
life, and a S3nnpathetic and active factor in the prosecution of pure 
scientific research. This national station under the administration of 
Goode, Bumpus, and others has l)een a resourceful and willing ally 
of the biological laboratory. 

The natural advantages of W^oods Hole deserAc especial emphasis. 
The waters of Buzzards Bay and Vineyard Sound are cjf exceptional 
purity. In the immediate vicinity of Woods Hoh^ are luuuerous har- 
bors and lagoons, with muddy, sandy, or rocky bottoms, while the 
coast is so broken by ])ays, ])roniontorics. sti'aits. and islands as to 
afford the most varied enviromnents for marine life. In addition the

tide currents whicli sweep in throiio-h the ''hole" brino- in nniltitude.s 
of floating animals and plants, nian}^ of which are tropical forms, car- 
ried in from the Gulf Stream, which is distant only about 100 miles. 
The proximity of the Gulf Stream to this portion of the New P^no-land 
coast gives a laljoratory located at this point numy of the advantages 
of a tropical station without any of the accompanying disadvantages. 
There are also many fresh-w\ater ponds and lakes in the vicinity which 
contain a rich fauna and flora. 

In these ideal collecting grounds the trained investigator naturally 
flnds abundant and widely var^'ing material, and the beginner in zool- 
ogy, during the frequent excursions which form so prominent a 
feature of the instruction, sees something under natural conditions 
of the teeming life of the shore and of shallow water, of the delicate 
fauna foiuid on spiles and floating timl)ers, and of the products of 
the dredge and drag net. It is under such circumstances that one enthu- 
siastically realizes the meanings of various structures mad(> out in the 
dissecting pan in the laboratory, and the nicety of the adaptations of 
each animal to the conditions under which it lives. Much of the col- 
lecting is carried on in the steam launch Sagttta, suggestively named 
after a swift-swimming marine worm of ai'row-like shape. 

The naturalist and the student are also fortunate in th(^ material 
and educational equipments of the la])orator3'. It is true that in con- 
trast with the beautiful Renaissance building at Naples our gra^'- 
shingled laboratory buildings seem somewhat barn-like externally. 
However, this is not incompatible with the true scientiflc spirit of 
"plain living and high thinking." Certainly the very best e(|uipment 
and facilities that ingenuity, stimulated by necessity, can provide is 
most generousl}^ devoted to the advancement of science. Fifty private 
rooms, for example, are reserved each year for independent investiga- 
tors, and these are free of expense. 

Under the heading "equipment" one should l>riefly touch upon the 
department of supply, the museum, and the library, and especially 
upon some of the various courses of instruction. 

The department of supply was established in order to make accessi- 
ble to teachers and others at a distance, who desire to obtain material 
for study or class work, the products of the teeming colle(;ting grounds 
at ^^'oods Hole. All the types generally used in both zoological and 
botanical instruction, such as algjr, sponges, h} droids, starflshcs, sea 
urchins, marine worms, crustaceans, mollusks, smaller marine verte- 
brates, etc., as well as mounted sets of seaweeds, are kept in stock. 
A special laboratory for this departnuMit, supplied with salt and fresh 
water for aquaria, has been prepared, and a curator appointed to keep 
the department open throughout the year. The department is also 
securing materials for the museum, illustrating the fauna and flora of 
the surrounding waters and ('ountiy. There is a rapidly growing col- 
lection of dissections largely prepared hj the classes in zoology,

another collection of microscopical preparations, and finally an herba- 
rium. All who have taught or studied biology do not need to be told 
the. immense educational value of these collections. The li])rary — in 
any institution, the fount to which all constantly repair — is provided 
with many works of reference and the more important journals on 
zoology and l)otany; but the expansion of science is so rapid that a 
library of this kind is alwa3^s urgentl}^ in need of f requentl}' called-for 
titles. 

All these ela})orate adjustments for studying the morphology and 
evolution of marine organisms furnish the data for another set of 
studies, al)ove alluded to under the term "biology." 

In his famous address "On the physical basis of life," Huxley said: 

Thus a nucleated mass of protoplasm turns out to be what may be termed the 
structural unit of the human body. * * * Beast and fowl, reptile and fish, mol- 
lusk, worm, and polype are all composed of structural units of the same character, 
namely, masses of protoplasm with a nucleus. * * * Hent-e it apjiears to l)e a 
matter of no great moment what animal or plant I lay under contribution for proto- 
plasm, and the fact speaks volumes for the general identity of that substance in all 
living beings. 

The unity of protoplasm is the ultimate raison d'etre for the Woods 
Hole la])oratory. In the protoplasm of a polypii may be wrapped up 
a secret of vast importance to the welfare of the human race. 

This is the thought imderhnng the courses in comparative physiol- 
ogy and embryology, as shown in the following (Quotations:" 

* * * It is our problem to get an imderstanding of the various life phenomena. 
It happens that while the solution of one physiological i^roblem is almost impossible 
among certain vertebrates or certain arthrojiods, tlie conditions in one definite arth- 
ropod or in an ascidian, or some other animal may be such as to make the solution 
almost self-evident. In the various forms of the animal kingdom nature has prepared 
just as many experiments as we might wish to accomplish by our vivisectional method, 
but without the disadvantages of that method. We can, for example, study the 
automaticity of contractile tissue far more readily in the pulsatile bell of the medusa 
than in the vertebrate heart. In the medusa, by one snip of the scissors, we have a 
contractile tissue deprived of nerves without elaborate vivisection. The influence 
on protoplasm of lack of oxygen may also be readily studied from a comparative 
standpoint. From the (chemical transformations going on in large masses of similar 
cells the inference" may be drawn that cells deprived of oxygen undergo hydrolytic; 
splittings by which insoluble bodies may Ijecome soluble. But by placing various 
infusoria or developing eggs under the microscope this fact may with ease be ren- 
dered visible. The membranes and more solid portions of the infusorian may be 
seen to dissolve and disappear, leading to a complete disorganization of the cell. 
* * * It may truthfully be said that the problem of heredity is one of the most 
important i)roblems of physiology at the present time. The reasons why a given 
mass of cells devcdops into a given organ of a certain sliaj)e, size, and position can 
evidently only be ascertained by experimental physiology. The study of the phe- 
nomena of development and organization must bcnce form a part of any cmurse in 
comparative i)hysiology.

Accordingly, ^ye learn, al)Out two weeks of the course uitMlevoted to 
this study. The experiments d(nd witli th(> influence of \:irious factors 
in the environment (light, heat, gravity, chemicals, etc.) and in the 
organism which determine the devcdopment of given organs and the 
attainment of the })r()per animal form; with regeneration of animals; 
with the intiuence on protoplasm of various (^xternal factors, such as 
lack of oxj'gen, temperature, ion etiects. and so on. This is followed 
b}' an experimental course illustrating tropisms," geoti'opism, helio- 
tropism, stereotropism, chemotropism, galvanotropism. Among the 
forms studied will l)e copepods, worms, linudus lai'\'ie, arcMiieola larva^, 
fundulus and arbacia <-^ggf<, the shi'imp, etc. 

A fourth week of the course is given to "the study of the compar- 
ative physiology of the central nervous system. Phenomena of 
automaticity, coordination, and of reflexes, th(^ transmission of nerve 
impulses independent of nerves, and reactions to Injury, Avill ))e illus- 
trated in man_y forms of life, l^nusual facilities are ottered for work 
of this character owing to the immense nundx'i- and variety of the 
animals availal)le. '^' * ■■'" In the comparative physiology of the 
blood, the corpuscles, proteids, iind respiratory pigments of the l)lood 
of different animals are studied, together with the comparatixe physi- 
ology of blood clotting. The chief forms used ai'e th(^ starfish, sea- 
urchin, Scycotypus, l()l)ster, Limulus, and the dogfish. In the com- 
parative physiology of secretion the \ arious mechanisms of secretion 
will be illustrated as far as possible b}" the glands of inverte))rates.'" 

As an example of the prolilems of regeherdt'ton mentioned above we 
ma}^ cite the following: "If a worm normally produces a head, a 
series of segments, and a tail, what will happen if you cut the worm 
in pieces and then graft the head on the tail end^ Or a hermit crab, 
iitted into its conch shell, and well known to rapidly regenerate its 
large exposed claws, wdiat will happen if 3'ou cut ofl' one of the 
apparently useless hidden claws which hav(> been lyiug for thousands 
of generations within the conch?" The purposi\'e (pialitv in living 
things, the apparent determination to overcome all oI)stacles and attain 
an end is best illustrated in the remarkalde experiments of the above 
kind, in which Prof. T. H. Morgan has becomt> a leader in this coun- 
try. These have culminated in his recently published work, Regen- 
eration, a hopeful and o})timistic counterpart of Nordau's pessimistic 
volume upon human society. The moral of lln^se experiments is 
briefly expressed in Handc'fs aphorism ''There's a divinity that 
shapes our ends, rough hew them how we will,'' a moral so strong 
that quite a school of young natural philosophers in (Jerman}" arc 
reviving the older teleological and vitalistic th(M)ry of li\ing things as 
opposed to the chemical and nuH-hanical tlieory. 

« A tropisni is the tendency shown l)y an organism to react in a deiinite way to 
certain external stiinnli, as of sun-liglit ( licliotropisin ), i^iavitation ( >;cotro|iisni'), 
electricity (galvanotro](isni), etc. 



630 A MARINE UNIVERSITY. 

Another line of research in the solution of which America, thanks 
chiefly toE. B. Wilson, C^onklin, and Mead, is an acknowledoed leader, 
is suggested by the following question: If a developing egg (for exam- 
ple, the minute and delicate little surface-floating egg of some sea- 
urchin) normalh^ divides into two, four, eight, and ad infinitum cells 
to form the adult, what will happen if you shake these cells apart after 
the first, second, etc., cleavage? 

The initial step is to stud}- the undisturbed process of cell division 
through "cell lineage." The transformation of the simple fertilized 
egg cell is always accomplished by splitting into man}^ cells, which 
ultimately constitute the various tissues. It is obvioush" a matter of 
great interest and importance to trace the lineage of the tissues back- 
ward towartl the undivided egg. This has been done to such an extent 
that we can designate the particular cells that give rise to the outer 
covering of the body, to the nerves, alinientar}' canal, and to the repro- 
ductive and germ cells. Ver}" .early in the histor}- of the embryo the 
future functional and structural regions are marked ofl', and there is a 
beginning of what Spencer termed the physiological division of labor. 
Some biologists are inclined to carry this back still further into the 
components of the egg itself. 

One would suppose that any rude disturbance of this beautiful pro- 
cess would al)ruptl3^ terminate life. Quite the contrary; the general 
answer to all such questions as the above l)eing that the unex])ected 
will happen. Out of the patient observation of the unexpected, how- 
ever, is coming the rationale of the life processes. 

The remarka))le general result has been obtained that upon shaking 
apart the segments after the egg has divided into four or eight parts, 
these isolated cells do not die, but again subdivide and form a lot of 
twin or quadruplet indi\'iduals, as the case may be. In the early 
experiments of this kind by Wilson and others each separate cell pro- 
duced a minute Init entire individual. But when. Crampton happened 
to repeat the experiment on certain snails' eggs, the main result was 
that only one-half or one-fourth of an em])r3 snail was produced. 
In sea-urchins, in which shaking also produced fractional animals, the 
missing fractions were supplied })V regeneration — another verv strik- 
ing example of Handet's aphorism. 

In 1000, Prof. Jacques I^oeb announced the remarkable discoverv 
that in starfishes and other forms, by suital)le treatment with solu- 
tions, not only of various salts, but also of such substances as sugar 
and urea unfertilized eggs may give rise to swinnning Iarv;e. This dis- 
covery, like mostotliers of similar character, was the natural se<iuence 
of experiments which had started lin(>s of thought in this direction. 
Richard Hertwig in 1896, in Germany, had shown that strychnine 
starts the eggs of sea-urchins on the course of development. And 
Moroan. Itctwcen ISDOand IIHIO. at Woods Mole, had shown that the 



A MARINE irNIVf:KSITY, ' 631 

unfertilized egg-sof 'Arl)aQi((, a sea-urchin, when treated with sohition.s 
of .sodium and magnesium chlorides, would 8egn)ent and advanc(> into 
much later stages than those observed by Hertwig, though no swim- 
ming emljryos were produced. Thus to Morgan and Lo(^l), of Woods 
Hole, belong a large share of the credit of what has been called one of 
the most epoch-making disco\eries of modern times, that of artiticial 
fertilization. 

Parthenogenesis, or the development of a female eg^ without the 
access of a male element or spermatozoon, had long been known 
among various lower types of animals; instances are to be found in 
the bees, social wasps, ^c>yy/(6y,/'^>.syc7/r, Daphnia, plant lice, and others. 
Here was a case of artiticial parthenogenesis, and Loeb was led to 
compare these natural and artiticial phenomena, reaching the conclu- 
sion that fertilization carries into the o^gg a catalytic substance which 
accelerates a process which would otherwise proceed too slowly. Thus 
fertilization, from having a purely vital aspect, assumes a chemico- 
physical aspect, and the hitherto mysterious phenomena of i)artheno- 
genesis finds a partial explanation. 

In his discussion of this development without the male element, 
Loeb says it has !in important l)earing upon the theory of life 
phenomena: 

If we siUTeeil in tindinii a sul)staiice w hifli aceelerak's thr process of cell (Uviyion 
at the normal temperature, this will at the same time lead to a suppression or reduc- 
tion of the antagonistic process that shortens life. It is not impossible that " natural 
death" is comparable to the situation on the mature ej^g after it leaves the ovary. 
Nature has shown us the way by whicli at this critical point death can he avoided 
in the case of the egg. 

It is safe to j)r()phcsy tiiat the ))earing of these and similar discov- 
eries on medicine and pathology will l)e no less important than the 
experiments of Pasteur on ])acteria. 

The eti'ects of ditferent solutions upon the development of the egg is 
illustrated l)y an experiment conducted l)v nature herself: BninvluppuH 
stcK/iuiUs is a fi'esh-water crustacean, which, if raised in concentrated 
salt solutions (salt lakes), becomes smaller, undergoes some other 
changes, and transforms into a species Avhich has l)een known as 
Artein!(( SI// /'//(/, -a classic case of transformation under the action of 
external conditions, tirst observed by Schmankewitsch. This observer 
kept Art<'iiu<i \v. salt water, which \\q constantly diluted by adding 
fresh water until at last it was perfectly fresh; the ciiistaceans had 
meanwhile gon<' through several generations, and had gradually so 
completely changed tlunr characters that tinally they accpiired those of 
the genus BranehipjxtH. 

The artiticial pr()c(\ss has be(m errou(H)usly spoken of in the press as 
"chemical '''' fcrtdization. The single fact that Dr. Albert Mathews has 
been able to initiate development by the shaking of the (\'^)^ indicates 



632 A MARINE UNIVERSITY. 

that artilicial fertilization is as iinich physical as chemical. Mead, 
Conklin, and mail}' others, following- the l^elgian, French, and German 
schools, had long been studying the internal changes in natural ferti- 
lization, and as a sequel to these discoveries are the recent researches 
and experiments of Prof. Edmund B. Wilson on the changes which go 
on in the egg after artilicial fertilization. These were presented before 
the International Zoological Congress at Berlin and atti'acted much 
attention. They show that the unfertilized egg, by the addition of 
magnesium salts, is aljle to create a complete mechanism of cell division. 
But under this unaccustomed stinuilus, in the words of Wilson, "the}^ 
manifest a nuiltitude of aberrations which constitute a veritable 
carnival of development, which one can hardl}^ witness without a sense 
of amazement." These aberrations are of high interest on account of 
the side light they throw on many debated problems of normal cell 
function and structure. 

The value of all these observations hinges, of course, upon the 
essential unit}' of protoplasm throughout the animal kingdom; as in 
Huxley's prophec}', whatever applies to the protoplasm of sea-urchins 
we may be sure applies in some degree to the protoplasm which con- 
stitutes the basis of human life. 

The life and the social congress at Woods Hole are almost as varied 
as the problems investigated there. School teachers from all over the 
Union, students from the smaller inland colleges and the largest uni- 
versities, young aspirants for the doctor's degree, older men of inter- 
national reputation in botany, zoology, physiology, ps^T'hology, all 
come under the magnetism of the ''M. B. L.," as it is familiarly 
known. Work is not too streinious, it is tempered ])y the undercur- 
rent of the feeling that, after all, this is sunnner vacation time and 
one must not be too serious. In fact, at Woods Hole, as with our 
English and continental scientitic brethen, life is well ])alanced and 
altogether reasona])le while no less productive. 

Among the things evidently of supreme value in the modern univer- 
sity are: the traditions and history of the institution; its appropriate 
location and housing; the availability of the sources and instruments 
of knowledge; the presence of a cosmopolitan assemblage of the stu- 
dents and teachers of numerous sciences — ail of which, we have seen, 
constitutes the charm of our "marine universUv."

JOHN WESLEY POWELL/' 



By (t. K. (tii.bkkt. 



John Wesloy Powell was l)orii March 24, ISS-t, at Mount ]\Iorris, 
N. Y. He died September 23, 1002, at his sunnner home in Haven, 
Me. He was married in 1862 to Emma Dean, of Detroit. His wife 
and daug'hter, an only child, survive him. 

His parents were Enolish. having- readied this country only a few 
years before his birth. His father was a Methodist preacher and soon 
removed from New" York, living- successively in Ohio, Wisconsin, and 
Illinois. His father's occupation took him nmch from home, and 
upon the son, while yet a boy, devolved the duty of conducting- the' 
farm from which the family derived its principal support. PowelTs 
early schooling was that ordinarily obtainabl(> in a rural comnumity. 
His later education was largely independent of schools, but he attended 
Illinois College, at Jacksonville, 111., for a short time, and was at 
01)erlin College two yeai's pursuing a special course. In early man- 
hood he supported himself l>v teaching, being at th(^ same tiuK^ a hard 
student and pursuing natural history studies with enthusiasm. He 
traversed portions of V-^isconsin. Illinois. Iowa, and Missouri on foot, 
collecting plants, shells, minerals, and fossils, and these collections 
brought him into relation with various colleges of Illinois. At the 
out])reak of the civil war he enlisted in the TwcMitieth Regiin(Mit of 
Illinois Volunteers, and abruptly changed the course of his studies to 
military science. His successive commissions ranged fi-om second 
lieutenant to colonel, l)ut the rank of major gave the title ])y which he 
was known colloquially in later years. His service was chiefly with 
artillery, but some of his most important work was of a character 
commonly assigned to engineer officers. In the battle of Shiloh he 
lost his right arm, and the resulting physical disability atl(H;ted his life 
in important ways. On the one hand, the wounded arm caused him 
at various periods much pain, and tlius weakened an exceptionally 
strong constitution. On the other, lu^ was led in early manhood (o 
employ an amanuensis, and the resulting freedom from tlu^ mechan- 
ical factor in writing was a distinct advantage to his literary work.

634 JOHN WESLEY POWELL. 

At the close of the war he prompth'^ returned to civil life, dropping 
the study of military science as abruptly' as he had beg-iin it. An 
attractive opportunity to enter political life was declined in favor of 
scientific work. He became professor of geology at Bloomington, 
111., and lecturer on geology at Normal, 111. In 1867 he organized and 
led the first important geological excursion of American students, 
taking a jjarty of 16 to the mountain region of Colorado. This was 
before the building of transcontinental railways, and the journey 
across the plains was long. He remained among the mountains as an 
explorer after the party had returned East, and in the following 3'ears 
organized a second expedition with geologic and geographic explora- 
tion and research as its chief objects. The necessary funds were fur- 
nished by various educational institutions in Illinois, and Congres- 
sional authority was obtained for supplying the party with provisions 
from the military posts of the West. His expedition wintered west 
of the Rocky Mountains in the valley of White River, and the long- 
period thus spent in a permanent camp was occupied in the scientific 
study of Indians. In the following spring four ])oats were l>rought 
from Chicago to the point where the newly constructed Union Pacific 
Railway crossed Green River, and a party was organized for the 
exploration of the canyons of the Green and Colorado rivers. When 
this work was begun it was known that the rivers here descend in a 
distance of TOO to 1,000 miles through the vertical space of 5,000 feet, 
coursing most of the way between unscalable walls, but the nature of 
the rapids, cascades, and cataracts by which the water falls from the 
upper to the lower level was altogether unknown. The undertaking 
was therefore of phenomenal boldness and its successful accomplish- 
ment a dramatic triumph. It produced a strong impression on the 
public mind and gave Powell a national reputation which was after- 
wards of great service, although based on an adventurous episode b}' 
no means essential to his career as an investigator. 

The voyage through the canyons was a reconnoissance in an unex- 
plored area and led to the organization of a geographic and geologic 
survey, for which appropriation was asked and obtained from Con- 
gress, the work being initially placed under the supervision of the 
Smithsonian Institution. By the advice of Professor Henry, the gath- 
ering of ethnologic data was made a leading function of the oi'ganiza- 
tion. In 1869 a boat party began a second voyage through the 
canyons, the plan ])eing to spend two years in their mapi)ing, and land 
parties were at the same time organized to cooperate with them. The 
river was abandoned as a base of operations in the middle of the sec- 
ond season, but the land work continued, with progressive develop- 
ment of plan, for a period of ten 3'ea''s. About the middle of this 
period the study of the problem of the utilization of tiie arid region 
tln'ouoh irri<>ation and otherwise became a function of the oi'oariiza- 



JOHN WESLEY POWELL. 635 

tion, and a special iiiNcstipitioii was made of tlic water sii])i)ly of the 
Territory of IJ^tali. 

Of parallel growtli were the surveys (h'xclojxMl under the initiative 
of Dr. Hayden, Clarenee Kinu-, iiiid Lieutenant AN'lieeler. Theii- func- 
tions were similar, and witli the exception of the work by Kino-, which 
had a detinite limit, their ambitions included the exploration and 
survey of all the western domain of the ITnited States. They thus 
became rivals, and there was need of reorganization. After luisuc- 
cessful eii'orts to arrange for the partition of the ti(d(l and fritMidly 
cooperation between the ditierent corps, Powell advocated their merg- 
ing into a single bureau of the Interior Department, and it was largely 
through his initiative that the work ^vas finally reorganized in 1879. 
The Powell, Hayden, and Wheeler surveys were abolished and the 
present United States Geological Survey created, Mr. King becoming 
by presidential appointment its tirst director. At the same time the 
Bureau of Ethnology was created to carry forward the ethnologic 
work, and of this Powell l>ecame director. The Geological Survey 
was made a bureau of the Interior Department, and the Bureau of 
Ethnology was attached to the Smithsonian Institution. 

The study of water supply in relation to irrigation led to the con- 
clusion that the land laws of the United States were ill adapted to the 
conditions obtaining in all the drier portions of the country, and 
Powell l)ecame nuu-h interested in the legislative problems thus arising. 
Partly at his instance a conunission was appointed to codify tlie land 
laws and recommend such modifications as seemed to be re([uired. 
Powell gave nuu'h of his time for two years to the work of this com- 
mission, and a comprehensive report was prepai'ed, which, however, 
led to no legislation. 

In ISSI Mr. King resigned the directorship of the (T(M)logical Sur- 
vey, and Powell was immediately named as his successor. He retained 
the direction of the Bureau of Ethnology and conducted both l)ureaus 
until lS9-i, when he resign(Hl from the Geological Survey. During 
his administration the work of the Survey was greatly enlarged, espe- 
cially in its geographic l)ranch, and the investigation of water supply 
with special referenc(> to utilization for irrigation was added to its 
functions. 

In the last years of his life Powell ])ractically relinijuished adminis- 
trative responsibility, intrusting the management of th(> Bureau of 
Ethnology to his |)rincipal assistant, Mr. McCiee, and de\()ting his 
time to personal studies, which passed gradually from anthropology 
into the fields of ps3"chology and general philosophy. 

In summarizing the results of his active life it is not easy to separate 
the product of his [x'rsonal work from that which he accomplished 
through the organization of the ^vork of othei's. He was (^xtriMiiely 
fertile in ideas; so fertile thai it was (juitc impossible' that he slioukl 



C36 .TOHK WESLEY POWELL. 

personally develop them all, and realizing- this he gave freely to his 
collaborators. The work which he inspired and to which he con- 
tributed the most ini])()itaiit creative elements. ] believe to be at least 
as important as that for which his name stands directly responsible. 
As he always drew a})out him the best a])ility he could command, his 
assistants were not mere elal)orators, l)ut made also important original 
contributions, and the ideas which he gave the world through others 
are thus so merged and mingled with theirs that they can ncA'er be 
separated. If we count the inspiration of his colleagues as part of his 
work of organization, then the organization of researches may prop- 
erly be placed Hrst in the list of his contributions to the progress of 
science. Other terms of the list pertain to the fields of geolog}'', 
physical and economic geography, anthropology, and philosophy. 

The creation of the United States Geological Survey belonged to the 
logic of events and would undoubtedl}- have taken place within a few years 
without PowelFs assistance, but his active advocacy hastened the change 
and his ideas had greater influence than tiiose of any other individual 
in determining the mode of reconstruction of the national scientific 
work. He was so prominent as a promoter of reorganization that when 
it had been accomplished he felt that his motives might l)e impugned 
if he l^ecame a candidate for the directorship of the Survey, and he 
therefore declined to have his name pi'esented. It is proper to add 
that the scheme of reorganization which he advocated was not adopted 
in full. His plan included the organization of three bureaus to con- 
duct investigation in the fields of geology, geography, and ethnology, 
but Congress created only two bureaus, lea\ing geography without 
si)ecial provision. The work of geographic mapping w^as taken up by 
the (leological Sur\'ey as a means for providing base maps for the use 
of geologists, and thus the Survey has become a 1)ure'ui of geograph}" 
as well as geology. 

Two years later, when Powell succeeded King in the administration 
of the (leological Survey, he found the su])divisiou of the work 
arranged largely on geographic lines. There were branch offices at 
Denver, Salt Lake City, and San Francisco, each in charge of a chief 
who directed the geologic and topographic work of a large district. 
For til is classification Powell gradually substituted one l)ased upon 
function, a))olishing the districts and sei)arate offices and creating divi- 
sions of topography, general geology, and economic geology, coordi- 
nate with divisions of paleontolog}^ physics, and chemistry. A r«Mil or 
geographic classification was still used, but was su])ordinated to a 
subject classification. 

Careful attention was given to the financial S3^stem of the liureiui, 
the machinery by which the })ublic funds were paid out and accounted 
for, and the wisdom of this attention was afterwards fully justifiiMl. 
AN'hcn in later years the affairs of the Survey avci-c subjected to

unfriendly and f^oiirchin^j;' investigation the accounts were found in 
such perfect condition as to elicit the hig-hest praise of the Comptroller 
of the Treasur}-. to whom tlie results of tlie iuN-estiji-ation were tinally 
referred. The reputation of the Survey for oood business methods 
inspired the confidence of le<;islators and led them to provide for the 
growth of the Bureau, not only by the increase of appropriations for 
existing- functions, l)ut tlu'ough the gradual eidargement of function. 
The most iuiportant single addition to its duties Avas that of studying 
the water supply of tlie country with reference to \'arious economic 
problems. 

Except for the original suggestion or instruction l)y Professor Henry, 
and except for the votes of funds by Congress, the Bureau of Ethnology 
may be regarded as PoweJl's creation. Work on American ethnology 
had previousl}' Ijeen discursi\e, unorganized, and to a large extent 
diletanti. He gave to it definite purposes conformable to high scientific 
standards, und personally trained its corps of investigators. To men 
who had pre^■iously interested themselves in the study of Indians he 
gave new methods and a new point of view, and he succeeded in divert- 
ing to ethnology men already trained in scientific methods l)y work in 
other fields of research. He realized, as perhaps few had realized 
before him, that the point of view of the savage is essentially ditit'erent 
from that of the civilized man, that just as his nuisic can not be recorded 
in the notation of civilized nuisic, just as his words can not be written 
with the English alphabet, so the structure of his language transcends 
the formulte of Aryan grannnars, and his philosophy and social organ- 
ization follow lines unknown to the European. He also realized most 
fully that the savage is the embryo of the man of highest culture, and 
that the study of savagery is therefore a fundamental contribution to 
the broadest study of humanity. With these ideas he informed his 
ethnologic corps, and in consequence of them the organ izjition of the 
Bureau marks the most important e])Och in American ethnology. 

The same personal inlluence extended to thv work of tlie Anthropo- 
logical Society of \\'ashington. Over the proceedings of this society 
Powell presided for many years, taking part in all its discussions and 
making it his special function to point out the l)earing and relation of 
each comnnuiication to the greater problems and broader aspects of 
the science. As the l)ureau was and is a lal)oratoiy of ethnology, 
devoted to the stud}" and record of the character and culture of the 
fading tribes of North America, so the society, including the same 
group of students, was and is an arena for the discussion of the 
broader s<,'ience of anthropology. 1 but echo th(> general sentinuMit of 
those students in saying that the high intellectual and scientific })lane 
on which the work of this society is conducted is a result, direct and 
cumulative, of Powell's influence and example. 



638 JOHN WESLEY POWELL. 

Bet'oi'o turning" to Powcirs direct contrihutions to science, mention 
should be made of his studies in biolooy. In early manhood he was 
an assiduous collector of plants, fresh-water shells, and reptiles, and 
this Avork was accompanied by studies in distribution, l)iit the results 
of such studies do not constitute a contril)ution to botany and zoology .- 
The work was properly a part of his education, a training- in tlie art 
of ol)servation, which bore fruit only when his attention was turned to 
other branches. 

Tlis contributions to geology include a certain amount of descriptiye 
work. He pul)lished the stratigraphy, structure, and part of the areal 
geology of the Colorado plateaus and the Uinta Mountains. In con- 
nection with the field studies in tliese districts he developed a new 
classification of mountains, by structure and genesis; a structural clas- 
sification of dislocations; a classification of valle3^s; and a genetic 
classification of drainage systems. His classification of drainage 
recognized three modes of genesis, of Avhich two were new. With 
the novel ideas involved ii\ the terms "superimposed drainage" and 
"antecedent drainage" were associated the broadei- idea that the phy- 
sical histor}' of a region might be read in part from a study of its 
drainage system in relation to its rock structure. Another broad idea, 
that since the dc^gradation of the land is limited downward by the level 
of the standing water which receives its drainage, the types of land 
sculpture throughout a drainage area are conditioned by this limit, 
was formulated by means of the word " base level." These two ideas, 
gradually developed by a younger generation of students, are the f im- 
damental principles of a new sul)science of geology sometimes called 
geomorphology, or physiographic geology. 

The scientific study of the arid lands of our AVestern domain in rela- 
tion to human industries practically began with Powell. Early in his 
govermuental woi'k he issued a volume on the lands of the arid region, 
and he continued their discussion in one way or another for twenty' 
years, setting forth the physical conditions associated with aridit}^, 
th(^ paroxysmal character of rainfall, th(^ depiMulence of arable low- 
lands on the rainfall and snowfall of uplands, and the generous 
response of the vegetation of arid regions to the artificial application 
of Avater. Emjihasizing the necessity of irrigation to successful agri- 
culture, he ])olnted out the need of conserving storm waters b}' artifi- 
cial reservoirs, the need of ap])lying new principles in legislation for 
the regulation of water rights, and tln^ need of a new system of hiAVS 
for th(» conti-ol of title in arid lands. These ideas when first advanced 
were the su1)ject of hostile criticism because they antagonized current 
opinions as to the availal>ility of our Western domain for settlement; 
])ut he afterwards found himself part of a gemu'al movement for the 
intelligent develo})ment of the West, a movement whose latest achieve- 
ment is the so-called reclamation law. 



JOHN WESLEY VOWELL. 639 

He }H)iiit(Ml out also that oui' land laws did not jxMiuit the lean ])as- 
tiire lands of the West to l)eac(|uired by pi'ivate owners in tracts laroe 
enough for eeononiic nianagenient. and that o\-ersto<'kiiig and ])(>riodie 
disasters were the log-ical results of public ownership; and his i(l<?as 
as -to remedial leg-i^^lation weri^ embodied in the unheeded i-epoi-t to 
the Pul>lic Lands Comnussion. 

In descriptive ethnology PowelFs published conti'it)utions are meager 
in comparison with his body of observations and notes. Th(>y are 
compriscnl in a magazine article on the IMoki. an essay on tlu^ Wvan- 
dot, and a few myths, chiefly Shoshonian, introduced in various 
writings for illustrative purposes. In his "Introduction to tlu^ Study 
of Indian Languages'" he gives instructions for American ethnologic 
observation, covering not only the subjectof language. l)ut arts, insti- 
tutions, and mythology. Other writings belong moi(> })ro})(M"lv to 
anthropology, and deal with its broader principles. In a. series of 
essays, (lesigi\ed as i-ha})ters of a manual of anthro])()logy but aciualU' 
publislunl as occasional addresses and never assem])led, he ])oints out 
the lines of e\'olution in th(> various tields of human thought and 
activity, philosophic, linguistic, esthetic, social, and industrial. The 
ground covered l)y these essays is so broad that a brief summai'v is 
impossibl(\ They include the ideas which have dinn'ted th(> work of 
the Bureau of Ethnology, and they include also nuuh which has found 
no immediate application, belonging to tields of thought as vet un- 
touched by others. As to their ultimate value futui-e generations 
must decide, but they stand nearly or quite unicpuMis a comprehensi\ c 
body of philosophic thought founded on the c()m])ai'ison of aboriginal 
with advanced culture. 

In latter years attention was gradually turned from anthropologv 
to psychology and the fundamental concepts of natui-al ])liilosophv. 
His interest in these sid)j(X'ts began in early manhood, and the>- ai'e 
l)riefly touched in various writings; but he ga\ c the last eight v(mii-s 
of his life almost wholly to their study. Two books were written and 
a third planned. "'Truth and Error,'' wdiich appeai-ed in lS',»l), trcMits 
of matter, motion, and consciousness as related to the external uni\ crse 
or the field of fact. " Good and Evil," printed as a series of essavs 
in The Anthropolog-ist with the intention of eventual assemblage in 
book form, treats of the same factors as r(dated to humanity or to 
welfare. The field of the emotions was assigned to th(^ thii-d 
volume. His i)hilosophy was also endxxlied in a series of poems, of 
which only one has received publication. 

In much of his scientific writing PowelTs style is terse to a fault. 
Usually he is satisfied with the simplest statement of his conclusions. 
Sometimes he adds illustrations. Oidy rarely does he explain them 
by setting forth their premises. It has thus happened that som(> of 
his earlier work\ though eventually recognized as of high importance, 



640 JOHN WESLEY^ TO WELL. 

was atfir.st cither not appreciated or ini.sunder.stood. Tlie value of hi.s 
anthropologic philosoph}^, though now widely appreciated, was recoo-- 
nized but slowl}^ outside the sphere of his personal iutiuence. His 
philosophic writings belong to a field in which thought has ever found 
language inadequate, and are for the present, so far as nia}^ be judged 
from the review of "Truth and Error," largely misunderstood. Ad- 
mitting myself to be of those who fail to understand nnich of his 
philosophy, I do not therefore condemn it as worthless, for in other 
fields of his thought events have proved that he was not visionary, but 
merel}' in advance of his time. 

To the nation he is known as an intrepid explorer, to a wide public 
as a conspicuous and cogent advocate of reform in the laws affecting 
the development of the arid \yest, to geologists as a pioneer in a new 
province of interpretation and the chief organizer of a great engine 
of research, to anthropologists as a leader in philosophic thought and 
the founder, in Amei'ica, of the new regime.

Germany of tbo latter half of the nineteenth century is so entirely 
(liHerent in almost every respect from (lermany of the period which 
preceded it that it is difficult to realize the actual transition of the one 
into the other. The bustling political and economic movements of 
to-day, and the general uplifting of the whole condition of culture, 
were preceded l)y a period when either an apathetic or a friendly 
idealic life might be called forth according to local conditions. And 
yet the two decades immediately preceding the 3M»ar 1S50 were ])y no 
means a dead tune, for although but little apparent upon the surface 
stUl there was a deep and regular, untiring and fresh mo\'ement in 
those daj^s, the activity of work. A work for culture was being com- 
pleted which had consciously for its purpose the awakening and prog- 
ress of the nation. It is no accident that the generation which then 
grew up lived to see greater changes in their fatherland than any that 
had preceded. Pure-mind(Hl German science, untrou])lcd by chauvin- 
istic jealousy, has never failed to recognize th(^ mighty intellectual 
stinudus which she has ofttimes owed to foreign lands; ])ut she ever 
recalls wdth just pride the purely national development which has gone 
on unceasingly from the time of her own intellectual giants of the 
eighteenth century. This movement matured its l)est I'epresentatives 
in the years of external pressure, for it was in these very periods of 
stress that intellectual actl\'ity found the tinit^ to ripen. Living on in 
the traditions of the undying classics, the German s<-h()ol formed the 
men to whom we owe the Germany of the present. One ]>y one they 
pass away — these landmarks of the Germanic culture of the nineteenth 
century who brought it to b(d'ore ludvnown excellence — :uid now, in 
his turn, is Rudolf Vii'chow departed from this life. 

Rudolf Ludwig Karl Virchow was born on Octol)er 18, 1S21, in the

set down in the Easter vacation of 1830. This first literary produc- 
tion deserves in more than one respect the publication awarded to it 
by the Prussian minister of education in the eightieth year of its 
author's age, for the reader can see depicted in the child's inner life 
many of the germs of character which unmistaka)>ly developed in the 
work of later j^ears. 

. The youth of 17 expresses deep gratitude for the loving care of his 
father, the treasurer of the town, who was enabled to meet with help- 
fulness all the difficulties which rose up to oppose the eager humanistic 
ambitions of the son. Reading and writing were learned from the 
father; and at the town school and with the clergyman of the parish 
he continued his preparation for college. But the way was not made 
easy for him. The methods of instruction of the rector must have 
been quite peculiar. "He so overrated nw knowledge that he gave 
over the instruction of some l)eginners in Latin to me, so that I myself 
forgot what little I had learned." The young teacher was at that time 
but 11 years old. Private instruction with the preacher, Gantzkow, 
remedied these defects, however, so that the happy student entered 
the third class of the gymnasium at Koslin on May 1, 1835. 

In the pul)lication of the minister of education there is a portrait of 
the boy at about ■! years of age which shows a friendly child face with 
large, wide-opened eyes, the corners of the mouth a little drooping, 
and the expression one of interested attention. The presence of certain 
anatomical peculiarities which appear in later photographs, indicate 
that the portrait must have been well drawn. By the aid of this like- 
ness the reader can picture to himself the student at the gymnasium 
who discloses in his diary his thoughtful spirit, and in whom the 
extraordinary eagerness for knowledge, the sharp self-criticism, and 
the love of truth havQ left the impress of an early maturitv. 

The undesirable influences of unworthy fellow-students upon his 
impressionable and vivacious temperament during the second year 
were overcome as a senior. He was certainly an exception among 
young men of his age in that he realized what threatened him. He 
writes " I can at least assure you that in the pursuit of pleasure 1 have 
always sought to keep within proper bounds, and I believe I have 
generally succeeded, at least so far that my studies have not suffered, 
nor even has ni}^ health been impaired. The good spirit which rules 
among my classmates of the senior year has aided me in this endeavor." 

His favorite studies were the natural sciences, history, and geog- 
raphy, as well as the ancient classic writings of Cicero, Sallust, and 
among the Greeks, Sophocles. To these he devoted his spare hours, 
but at the same time ho did not neglect to improve himself f)y reading 
French and German authors. The highly gifted lad early showed a 
strong tendency to r(>ll(»ction, and soon acciuired a solidly grounded 
and copious store of knowledge, which enabled the 3'oung student to

brino- to ln"> studies a ripe uiidorstandino- and a critical discrimination. 
Far better grounded in tHe older tongues, especially the Latin, than 
our modern students, Rudolph Virchow retained through life secure 
mastery of them, and in his later years he exhi))ited a keen sensitive- 
ness to the barbarisms of which the present scientitic generation is not 
guiltless. In tiie year 1S8H he gave an earnest exhoi'tation to his fel- 
low-workers and the readers of hispcn-iodical" in regard to this matter, 
and still later he again uttered a word in favor of a good tf^rminology.^ 

At Easter tiiue, 1S81), at the age of IT years and »i months, Kudolph 
Virchow passed first among eight students at the examination, and in 
the autumn entered as a student of medicine at the Koniglich medizi- 
nisch-chirurgische Friedrich Wilhelurs Institut at Berlin. (This was 
the so-called Pepiniere, now Kaiser Wilhehu's Academic fiir das mili- 
tarjirztliche Bildvmgswesen.) He went through the regular course of 
the •' Eleven," ])ut found time for })rivate research. It is an interest- 
ing iHustration of his habit of mind that the future militar}" surgeon 
heard the lectures of Friedrich Riickert's colleague upon Arabic poetry. 

April 1, 1843, he was appointed "'Charite-Chirurgus," which cor- 
responds with the present position of assistant physician. He (Mitered 
immediately into practical work which l)rought u}) a host of sugges- 
tions calculated to develop the germinating ideas of his student da3's. 
He felt that he nuist still learn, and that a thorough scientitic education 
was a necessity for him, and was, therefore, not content mertdy to 
follow on with his comrades, but chose for himself his own course. 

The one who exercised the most intlucnce upon the student was 
Johannes Midler, the many-sided master, preeminent in each of the 
several lines of work which he undertook. He early l>ecame Vir- 
chow's ideal, and so he remained. In the masterly memorial address 
which he delivered'' after the untimely death of Midler, July 24, 
1858, Virchow gave fitting utterance of the deep feelings of gratitude 
which he ever cherished toward the master. Appreciating ol)jectively 
the extent of Midler's talents and achievements, he raised for him an 
undying memorial. Eminent as an anatomist, zoologist, and physiolo- 
gist, Midler was not less eminent in pathology; but the pupil wlio was 
to carry forward his work to unimagined furthcn* development crowns 
him who had destroyed the false philosophy of Schelling witii ''the 
laurel of th(> tvxw natural philosopher of the real liesh and ])lood."' He 
sketched with firm hand Miillers development from almost mystical 
tendencies to the true spirit of exact scientitic research, and attri))uted 
to ''Nature and doethe'' a powerful intluence on Midler's intellectual

development, perhaps recalling his own experiences, for Virchow's 
own thoughts had grown up in Goethe's school. 

It fell to Virchow also to deliver a memorial address for the other 
master, who, next to Midler, had exerted the greatest influence upon 
him. This was for Johann Lukas Shonlein, and was delivered at the 
Berlin University in 1865." In ]K)th these addresses we find many 
things indicative of Virchow's own course of growth, but still more 
numerous are the interesting historical references. Particularly valu- 
able are notes on the development of medicine as a science in the first 
half of the nineteenth century. While yet a student Virchow had 
aided in this, and before the end of his student da3^s he engaged 
actively in research along these lines. On October 21, 1848, the 
degree of doctor was conferred upon him by Johannes MiiUer (then 
dean of the faculty of medicine) for his work on the inflammation of 
the cornea (De rheumate pra?sertim cornea^). Kudolph Virchow 
remained for a long time assistant at the charity hospital, but on 
March 20, 1846, he passed the state examination, with the added com- 
mendatory words "very good" and "as operative surgeon." The 
time preceding this, however, had been a very important period of 
his life, for he had l)egun his career as a student of nature. More 
and more he occupied himself with the scientific treatment of the 
anatomic m-aterial of the hospital, assisting the demonstrator of 
anatomy, RoV)ert Froriep, who, with just respect for his ability, 
shared man}" operations with him. At the solicitation of this dis- 
criminating friend, the general physician, Grimm, appointed Virchow 
to the position of assistant at the dissecting laboratory of the hospital 
in the year 1844. His gratitude to Froriep is suitably expressed in 
the preface of a volume of collected works'^ dedicated to his master 
and friend, and doing honor to l)oth master and pupil. Almost ten 
years after he himself had ]>ecome in his turn demonstrator of anatomy 
at the hospital, this volume, in which his scattered and often diflicultl}^ 
accessil)le papers are ))rought together, was dedicated by Virchow to 
the man who had guided his first steps in the line of scientific in<|uiry. 

On Ma}' 11, 1846, not two months after passing the state examina- 
tion, Virchow became acting demonstrator of anatomy at the hospital 
in the place of Fi'oriep, who had retired, although the definitive 
appointment was made conditional on his separation from the military 
connection. The impression had been current that Virchow's depar- 
ture from the Pepiniere was not voluntar}', but in consequence of dif- 
ferences there; l)ut, In I'eality, the case was exactly the reverse. His 
departure was accompanied by the cabinet order of April 6, 1847, 
which expressed in a most gracious way the appreciation of his scien- 
tific labors and released him from some years further military service

for which he was .still lia])le." Not 3"et 26 yciirs of aoc, Yirchow had 
now the opportunity of developing his powers in his own way. 

The position of demonstrator of anatomy had grown up from a 
rather slender ])eginning. The somewliat infrecjuent opportunities of 
confirming and broadening diagnosis by post-mortem examination had 
])een almost exclusively coniined, during the eighteenth century and 
the first third of the nineteenth, to the physicians to whom the care of 
the patient had l)een committed. Only of late had tlie need l)ecome 
apparent of physicians specially prepared for this purpose. The first 
demonstrator who had ])een attached to tlie hospital stafi' was 1*. Pholjus, 
but he remained little more than a year in this t-apacity" and had 
resigned because he could not defend himself from the occasional 
encroachments of a military surgeon. He was succeeded l)y Robert 
Froriep, w^ho was appointed, on December 22, 1881, as "Demon- 
strator, illustrator, and curator of pathological preparations at the 
Royal Charity Hospital.'' There were set apart for his use only a 
room and In^d chaml)er, and it was not till ls;U that upon a detailed 
memorial of Froriep's to the ministry, in which he stated clearly and 
at considerable length the pressing need of it, that a good microscope 
was procured. A single attending nurse, Frau Vogelgesang, was, at 
the time Virchow succeeded Froriep. the most important personage in 
the administration of the little realm. In the occasional corres])ond- 
ence relating to the purchase of improvements or to other internal 
arrangements her signature was never lacking, l)ut appeared together 
with those of the physicians and hospital director. The considerable 
reputation which ''Madam Vogelgesang'' enjoyed far l)eyon(l the 
boundaries of (Termany was due to her great skill in dissecting opera- 
tions.'' At first a voluntary assistant, Virchow was soon intrusted by 
the management of the charity hospital with the chemical and micro- 
scopic investigations necessary for the sick wards. These duties, now' 
divided in all great hospitals ])etween special laboratories with trained 
personnel, w^ere very extensive and lal)orious, l)ut witli characteristic 
energy and inspired by an illustrious exam})le, \ irchow soon show^ed 
a complete conunand of the situation. He saw in a comlMuation of 
chemical with anatomical researches the possibility of attaining an 
object of capital importance — namely, the cnnition of a pathologic 
physiology as the r(\sult of prearranged studies in anatomy and 
patholog}', combined witii experimental i)athologv and clicmical expe- 
rience. This experimentally founded science he sought losubslilute 
for the confused speculation then ruling (xcM-man medical })racticc.

the charity hospital was rewarded in 18-t5 by the great success of his 
investigation on ""white blood."" Continued studies led him to the 
description of a hitherto unknown form of disease to which he later 
gave the name of Leucocytha^mia. Meanwhile Virchow had already 
become lecturer on pathologic anatomy, and had given practical courses 
on the cadaver, in which he developed the technique of dissection, and 
which later fonued the basis of the Prussian "Regulations for the 
practice of medical jurisprudence in examinations of the human cada- 
ver." Other countries framed regulations modeled after these, so that 
the practices here promulgated have become to considerable degree 
the standards for the whole world. 

Virchow early became the center of a circle of congenial friends, of 
whom the more prominent were Ludwig Frankc, the great clinical 
physician of that day, Kudolf Leubuschei', and especially Benno 
Keinhardt. The latter was of a resei'v^ed, quiet, studious nature, but 
still capable of being stirred to passionate outbreaks in the warmth of 
scientific enthusiasm, and stood with Virchow in the eager search for 
truth and in revolt against the authoritative beliefs and the artificial 
systems which then prevailed in the medical science.''' From this 
friendl}^ alliance grew up that powerful instrument in the warfare for 
the new experimental science of medicine, the "Archiv fiir pathologic 
Anatomic und Ph3'siologie und fur klinische Medizin." "Had it not 
been for Miillers Archiv," writes Virchow later, "we should scarcely 
yet have known in Germany how a scientific journal should be con- 
ducted. "*" But Miiller's journal occupied another field, being chiefly 
concerned with normal anatoni}- and physiology, so that pathology 
found only occasional place in it. The "Archiv fiir physiologische 
Heilkunde," published in south Germany, as well as the "Zeitschrift 
fiir rationelle Medizin," were so one-sided in their editing that the 
friends were refused a place in these columns and found themselves 
ol)liged to found a journal of their own. Virchow recalled with grat- 
itude how in these circumstances the publisher, George Kcimer, came 
their aid; who, as he says, "had the courage to lA'dce his means at the 
disposal of two almost unknown young men." Their pro.spiH-tus 
appearing with the first num])er in April, 1847, is signed: Dr. Rudolf 
Virchow, Prosektor V)eim Gharite-Krankenhause, Dr. Benno Rein- 
hardt, Practischer Av/A.

fourteen articles Vireliow contributed eight, ay])eare(l in the course of 
the year 1847, the second in 1849. Both editors had hecii carried 
awa\' })y the political storm of 1848, and thus the regular progress of 
their work was interrupted, but, notwithstanding this, Virchow and 
Leubusoher started in the interim the Medizinische Reform, a weekly 
periodical, whose tirst number appeared July 10, 1848, and whose last 
num])er, 52, was dated June 29, 1840. It was a lighting sheet, which 
had for its object general reform in the care of health. 

This work for reform was the main result of the journey to Upper 
Silesia, which Virchow had ])egun with the Geheimen Obermedizi- 
nalrat, Barez, on February 2t>, 1847, at the behest of the Prussian 
ministry, to study the epidemic of typhus fever which had broken out 
there in the summer of 1846. He returned to Berlin on March 10, 
Barez having preceded him on February 29. This journey is become 
famous from Virchow's report, which soon after appeared under the 
title, ''^Mitteiiungen iibcr die in Oberschlcsian herschende Typhus- 
epidemie."" Virchow had been charged by the authorities with ''the 
investigation of the scientitic signilicance of the nature of the epi- 
demic." But l)esides a pathologic, anatomic, and clinical investigation 
of sick and dead, which would have satistied any other investigator, 
the report contains much more. He gives a monograph on the con- 
ditions of society in Upper Silesia in which the whole social and 
educational history of the province is set forth, and makes proposals 
for the treatment of the contagion. Painstaking accuracy, warm- 
hearted sympathy and courageous frankness are ever^'where in evi- 
dence. Virchow recognized that the common medicines and dietetic 
regulations suitable to sporadic cases were of little avail against the 
epidemic; and that the endemic disease owed its dangerous spreading 
character to the deplorable social conditions; the ignorance of people 
and authorities alike favoring the diffusion of contagious matter, and 
all contributing to diminish the resistance of individuals to contagion. 
Only through radical political and social reform, he maintained, could 
there come an effectual remedy. The same matter which the Paris 
Academie de Medecine had brought to the attention of the Egyptian 
Government he laid l)efore the authorities in the following terms: 
"The logical answer to the (piestion of the prevention in future of 
conditions similar to tho>^e we now see in Upper Sil(\sia is tlierefore 
easy, and is simply this: Education, with her two daughters, freedom 
and prosperity." This measure whicli he here adxocatcs led to the 
development of a thoroughly democratic programme. In his t'ornuda- 
tion of it, there were, to l)esiire, some fantastic features resulting from 
the disturl)ecl condition of th(^ times, but in the struggle of the next 
ten years not a little of it was adopted. The present l)eneticent

operation of niodical legislation is the immediate consequence of the 
fiery exhortations of the young charity hospital demonstrator, and 
later on he took a leading part as medical expert and as parliamenta- 
rian in the drafting of this legislation. 

It was at this time that the "Medizinische Reform'' began the battle 
for the health of the people. Questions of legislation and conditions 
were chiefl}" treated b}^ R. Leubuscher and S. Neumann, while educa- 
tion and medical science were in the hands of Virchow. All these 
prol)lems were connected with the political background, and the con- 
ditions out of which they grew and which were necessary factors of 
their solution w^ere never lost sight of. In the article with the title 
"Conclusion," in No. 52 of the periodical, there is a note of resigna- 
tion. Like the other contents of the last numbers, it is unsigned, but 
is unquestionably' the work of Virchow, who had carried the whole 
weight of responsibility ^ince the first of the 3'ear. The article begins 
with a verse from Ecclesiastes, and this also appears in the concluding- 
paragraph, which is a solemn pledge sincerely adhered to b}' Virchow 
in the remaining fifty-three years of his life: 

"We recognize therefore only the question of the healthful daily 
existence and daily bread for the people, and dedicate ourselves to 
making the broadest preparations with which the battle can be fought 
to ultimate success. The medical reform which we ha^e advocated 
was a reform of science and of societ}-. We have outlined its prin- 
ciples, and they will force their own way without the aid of this organ, 
})ut every moment shall find us working for them and ready to do 
])attlcfor them. We do not change the thing, but only the place. It 
would be not only useless but foolish to sow young seed among stones 
or to plant it in the earth in winter. ' To everything there is a season, 
and a time to ever}' purpose under the heaven."' 

Virchow was thus so deepl}^ connected with political questions, oven 
though not occupying himself with the minor details, but only with 
the main princi])ies, that his pay and allowances were suspended for 
a short time in the spring of 1849 on account of his activity as an 
agitator, but still with all this his scientific work never wholh^ ceased. 
The epidemic of cholera in that luducky year furnished him rich 
material for his investigations. 

Soon after the above-mentioned oixlers and their })artial repeal (tlie 
fre(; lodging in the hospital was not restored to him) ^'ir(•h()^v was 
called to the University of Wui-z])urg, and he gladly acce])ted (his 
opportunity of freeing himself from a situation which had l)ecome so 
unphvisaiit. In A\"ui'zj)ui'g began that rai)id rise to the same degree of 
leadership in the woild which he already enjoyed in a more limited 
circle. Before leaving Berlin he ])u])lislied in the autumn of 1841) his 
famous i)hiloso])hic statement, " Die Einheitsl)estrebungen in der wis- 
seuschaftlichen ^ledizin,"" in which he ga^'e i)roof to fi-iend and foe

alike that ho had deliherately chosen his mission and never " either at 
the dissecting table or l)ehind the microscope, at the sick l)ed or in 
puldic life, in the manifoldness of details forgotten the unity of prin- 
ci])les/' The "'law of the unity of human existence and its conse- 
quences'' he had treated in a iuunl)er of sketches entitled, Man, Life, 
Medicine, Sickness, and Contagion, and later he placed thest^ essays, 
enlarged l)y ilkiminating notes, at the beginning of his collected works. 
It is not possible in a l)rief account to go deeply into the '" Einheits- 
bestrebungen," which embraces the connection of medical research 
with the most fundamental things of human existence. Much that 
now is accepted as self-eyident stands here in the center of the field 
al)out which the battle betwt'cn the contending schools of science raged. 
Questions of belief, the doctrine of \'ital force, which with that of the 
spontaneous generation is now long since laid aside, and the system of 
medicine which had bound medical thought in hard and fast dogmatism, 
all find thoughtful and for the time keen and counigeous criticism. 
There neyer appears any semblance of personal animosity, however 
sharp the criti<'ism, and all the positions are taken wholly on ol)]ecti\e 
grounds. • 

Thei-e has recently been a widespread discussion as to the position 
of Virchow in relation to fundamental religious (jiu'stions, and many 
utterances have been attrit)uted to him whose cynicism would make it 
apparent that they could ne\er have come fi'om him. The position 
which he tirmlyheld is completely given in the follow ing passage^ from 
his '• Kiidieitsbestrebungen:'"' 

"There can not be any issu(^ between faith and science, for science 
and faith mutually exclude on(> anothe)-; not in the sense that the one 
renders th(> other impossil)le, or vice versa, but rather that so far as 
science extends faith does not exist, and faith begins whei-e science 
leaves otf. It can not l)e denied that beyond this limit there may be 
real objects to be embraced by faith. It is therefore not the object of 
science to destroy faith, l)ut rather to define the ])oimdaries to which 
knowledge extends, and within these to estal)lisli a uniform system.'' 

He strongly attacked the materialism of Karl \'ogt, whose assaults 
upon his own tolerant position toward faith are unjustitia])le. Though 
opposing dogmatism where it came in liis way, he much more strongly 
opposed materialism, for ht^ ])elieved it to be more dangerous than the 
views of tlie church or those of the idealist, but nevertheless he 
declined as a student of nature to follow with this latter party upon 
transcendental ground. While desiring himself to associate with 
science the strongest ol)jectivity, he yet showed in his later years 
unreserved i-espect for such degrees of subjecti\ity as did not spring 
from unexcusable violation of scientific truth. He is ey(,'n charged 
with inconsistiMicy l)ecause of his enei'getic o})position to Krnst 
Haeckel at the scicMitific conxocation at Munich in 1877. Haeckcl had 



650 RUDOLPH VIRCHOW, 1821-1902. 

deiiiiuided" the introduction of lii.s monistic teaching in the schools. 
Virchovv declined to teach these proV)lematic matters as results of 
science, for there rose up against it not only the scrupulous regard of 
the scientist for certainty, but also his revolt against any measure of 
compulsion in matters of belief. He remarked at the time privately 
to the writer of these lines that Haeckel forgot that he (Virchow) as 
the representative of the people must be considerate for the feelings 
of those of a different belief. 

In Wiirzburg a time of most diligent scientific activity for Virchow 
occupied the period of political paralysis following the outbreak of 
1SJ:8. His fame was securely founded upon his Berlin investigations, 
and especiall}^ upon the fearless and successful attack which he made 
upon the then prevailing teaching of Rokitansky upon crasis. The 
investigations begun in Berlin on disorders of the blood and the blood 
vessels and on parenchymatous intiammation, whose first germs had 
appeared in his thesis, besides other investigations of the biology of 
the cells and tissues were completed in Wiirzburg. Here also Virchow 
devoted himself with great success to researches in experimental 
pathology, to which he gave a place with pathologic .anatomy and 
chemical investigation. His greatest achievement in this field is the 
explanation of the processes of thombosis and embolism (stoppage of 
the ])lood vessels by clotted blood and the importation of sittdi 
obstructing masses by the circulation). Such conditions might, as he 
showed, arise from the cause of wounds. He sharply distinguished 
between the consequences of infectious thrombosis and the beneficial 
ones, and this and much of his other work was of great importance in 
leading to better understanding of the infectious diseases. These 
investigations, with those already mentioned upon the fever epidemic 
in Upper Silesia, and his studies in 1852 on the famine in Spessert,* 
gave the impetus to Virchow's work on epidemics, and with it the 
remarkable revolution of the practice of medicine in Pi'ussia and 
throughout Germany in the next ten years. 

Still another field in which Virchow's work was to he of the greatest 
value, he first entered while at Wiirzburg. His first publications in 
this field were entitled: '' ITntersuchung iiber den Cretinisnms, nament- 
lich in Franken und iib(>r pathologische Schadelformen.''^' and "Uber 
die Verbreitung des Cretinismus in Unterfranken.'''^ In these Vir-

chow commenced that great .series of anthropological papers in the 
strict sense, from which grew up the modern combination of Anthro- 
pology, Ethnology, and Archa'ology. But i)rincipally he occupied 
himself at this time with special studies of the most varied pathologic 
anatomic and chemical pro])lems. The}" all had for their common aim 
to provide an impregnable material basis for theoretical deductions 
through the strict application of the scientitic method of exact descrip- 
tion of observed conditions. Most of this work appeared in the 
"Archiv"" and in the "' Verhandlungen der Wiirzburger physikalisch- 
medizinischen Gesellschaft,'' which latter Yirchow had founded shortly 
after his call to Wurzburg together with Albert Kolliker and Kiwisch. 
He also undertook a great literary work in the editing of the "Iland- 
])uch der speziellen Pathologic und Therapie,""' in whose lirst volume 
he contributed a long article on ""general distur))ances of aliiuination,'" 
together with an ai)pendix treating of parasitic plants and animals. 
For the other parts of this great work, which int-luded f lom lsr)4 to 
1876 six large volumes, he gained the cooperation of a iuuul)er of 
eminent contril)utors. Since then many similar compilations have 
appeared, having for their object an encyclopicdic presentation of the 
knowledge and science of medicine up to the time of their publication. 
All these have in Virchow's hand])()()k their precui'scr and example, 
but it is here impossi])le to discuss even its main features. 

In the autumn of 1S.")0 Yirchow accepted a call to Berlin, whicii thus 
led him ]>ack to the original scene of his lal)ors, but now under ({uite 
altered conditions. Ho found himself at the head of an institute 
founded on the woi'k which he had done at Wurzl)urg and specially 
devoted to the interests of pathologic anatomy, experimental pathology, 
and particularly to chemical researches. To be sure the ])uilding 
which had been hastily and economically erected by the hospital direc- 
tors, Horn and Esse, was not up to his requirements. There were 
necessary many changes and many renovations, one even as late as 
1873 which greatly extended its usefulness ])ut not without seriously 
disturl)ing the work. Particularly the increase of the collection of 
pathologic anatomic preparations suffered greatly and it cost its author 
great trouble to again bring it up with other ])ranches of the work. 
But ho succeeded in creating a center for pathologic ijivestigations, 
which with all its branches, among them the instruction of young stu- 
dents, was the forerumun- and exani])le of all the similar institutions 
now to 1)0 found not onl}" in (iermany l)ut in all ci\ilized lands 
throughout the world. It would not b(> too much to s:iy that within 
his institute pulsed the heart of science which sent the ideas of the 
master inspiring and broadening through the labors of his pupils oyer 
the whole circuit ot th(> earth. Here Virchow's genius and wonderful 
forcefulness found their full greatiu'ss and his life work took on its 
lasting proportions. 



652 RUDOLPH VIRCHOW, 1821-1902. 

A 3^ear before Vii'chow left Wiirzburg he had coined the word "cel- 
lular-pathology'' which briefl}^ designates the nature of his life w^ork. " 
The researches of the previous years, in particular those upon the 
connective tissues, had graduall}' brought to light the principle which 
was to occupy the place before shared by patholog}" and general medi- 
cine. But it was not till Felu-uarv, March, and April of 1858 that Vir- 
chow delivered before an audience composed chiefly of the medical 
men of Berlin the twenty lectures w'hich he published in the same year 
under the title "'Cellular ]mthology as founded upon the ])hysiology 
and pathology of tissues."^ 

When Virchow commenced his scientific career, the art of medicine 
was under the stamp of dili'erent systems, pathology being dominated 
by Rokitansky, the great pathological anatomist of Vienna. He was 
the founder of the so-called Viennese school of pathology and had 
given to it a doctrine of dyscrasia, constructed like its predecessors on 
a priori rather than experimental grounds. Although excellent in the 
descriptions of diseased conditions and well grounded in its anatom}^, 
as Virchow readily admitted, yet the third volume of Rokitansk^^'s 
hand})ook of pathologic anatomy completely ignored the method of 
exact research. He remained in the error of speculation, reviving the 
old humoral pathology in his theory, and attributing all diseases to 
impurity of the blood, from which they were connmmicated to the 
solid parts of the l)ody. According to this doctrine these latter were 
practically excluded from pathologic considerations, while on the other 
hand under the rule of the doctrines of solid pathology the opposite 
had been the case, liokitansky had made little use of the microscope, 
an instrument first introduced in pathologic studies near the end of 
the eighteenth century ly the great Frenchman Bichat and used 
increasingly in Virchow's program with the efl'ect, as he says,'' "of 
bringing the path of general medicine at least three hundred times as 
close to the natural course of procedure." The figure, of course, 
refers to the magnifying power then employed. A\'e now use powers 
at least three times as high, l)ut a power of three hundred would suf- 
fice readily to disclose the elements of animal structure ^vliicli corres- 
pond to the generally much larger cells of plants. 

Moreover, the discoveries of Schleiden and Schwann had come to 
recognition, and the anatomists l)egan to think of cells, although the 
conception of the origin of single cells expressed in Schwann's "Th«>orv 
of free cell building'' was by no means the true one. Accoi'ding to 
this theory the cells arose from a condensation of matter, or blastema,

naniod for its connection with the cells the "cytol)ljist.'' This sub- 
stance Avas supposed to form first the cell nucleus and tluMi the inclos- 
ino- sheath or cell nieni])ran(\ after which a new yerni collected between 
the nucleus and cell inend)rane. The cui-rent ideas of life were shaped 
entirel}^ upon the theory of generatio a'ljuivoca, and for all forms of 
life not possessing" special generative organs parentl(\ss generation had 
to be assumed. This view^ has long since been overthrown; for the 
ferments by Eilhard Mitscherlich, and for the vegetable parasites prin- 
cipally by Louis Pasteur; while in the attack upon the theory of spon- 
taneous generation of aidmal parasites Rudolf Virchow })articipated 
with Rudolf Leukart in clearing up the develo})nient of the trichina?. 
Spontaneous generation was assumed in the theory of the formation of 
the cell from the l)lastema, and the subsequent formation of a new cell 
involved a second process of the same kind. According to the prevail- 
ing idea there were in the bodies of men and animals a group of tissues 
nearly destitute of cells, l)ut Yirchow's proof of the presence of cells 
ill th(> bones and cartilage, as well as of their ])ersistent presence in 
the connective tissues, dealt a heavy l)low to the tjieory of free-cell 
formation, and this theory collapsed completely aft(M- his researches 
on the connective tissue and parenchymatous iiitlanunation. That 
which had l)een known as the cytoblast, a more or less regular sul)stance 
lying between the cells, was recognized as lifeless. In young, grow- 
ing, and particularly in end)ryonic tissues, the cells were found to be 
more exclusively cellular the younger the tissue, and only after the 
tissues reached a considera])le age did the intercellular masses ap})ear. 
These latter, according to Virchow"s theory, were not simply dejiend- 
cnt for their formation but for their very substance upon the cells, 
which are the only living pails, and which are formed, as experiments 
show(xl, oidy from living cells already present. Virchow, usually an 
enemy to formula', coined for this I'clationship the expression onui'is 
celluJa (h ('clluhi. 

By mmierous tests of the constitution and behavior of diseased tis- 
sues he showed that the action of disease consists in the alteration of 
cells, and that the life of the individual depends upon the lif(^ of his 
cells. Nourishment, specitic functions (work), and growth are all reg- 
ular actions of cells, while disease is an anomalous cell iU'ti\ ity. 

Virchow, aided l>y all the medical investigations which had been 
stinudatcd by his experimental school of thought, coutimied to l)uild 
up his pidhology upon the foundations which his discov(u-ies in cellu- 
lar pathology had laid, and the cellular princi})le has ])een th(> basis of 
the greatest advances of the last decade. Indeed, it would not be too 
nuich to say that the whole modern science of biologv is built upon 
the law of the cell succession, and it is this which has assured to Vir- 
chow's work its undying value beyond the l)oundaries of strictly med- 
ical science. To Ix^ sure tlu-rc has come foi-ward occasionallv the view 



654 RUDOLPH VIRCHOW, 1821-1902. 

that the life processes Jo not reside in the cell as a whole, but are 
proper to certain smaller parts, the nature of whose activity deter- 
mines disease or health, but these views have not been maintained. 
Biolog-}' is cellular, and medical thought remains cellular in its pathology. 

We have hitherto been tracing- the course of Virchow's life and 
noting the principal achievements, which stand like milestones to mark 
his advance. Continuing in this wa}', we nmst now take note of one 
of his greatest works, namel_y, "Die krankhaften Geschwiilste."" It is, 
to be sure, incomplete, for only 25 of the proposed 30 lectures composing 
it appeared in the two and a half volumes published. But what Virchow 
has set down in these three books remains to-da^^, after almost forty 
years, an indispensable reference work and a guide to those working 
in this subject. The exempli tication of the scientific i:>rinciple of pro- 
ceeding to the understanding of a thing from an investigation of its 
development, the deep thorough discussion of a wealth of confirmed 
experimental material, all this coml)ined with the Ijrilliant presentation, 
have caused the " Oukologie " to take rank as the greatest of Virchow's 
works. 

Just as he chose the genetic method in seeking the explanation of 
the significance of all discoveries by an inquiry into the nature of their 
origin, so also Virchow did not neglect to employ the same method to 
investigate the causes of phenomena. He studied the a?tiology of 
diseases in the widest sense, and his investigations of the parasitic 
diseases, the causation of affections b}^ the action of animal or vege- 
taljle parasites within the tissues, formed a considerable part of his 
etiological researches. It is not possible to enter upon them within 
the limits of this article, but in the interest of truth it should be stated 
that at no time in his life did Virchow mistake the importance of 
plant forms of disease germs, and never opposed any movements of 
thought leading in this direction. Thus, in 1858, we find in the Archiv ^ 
"Beitrage zur Lehre von den l)ei Menschen vorkonmienden ptlanz- 
lichen Parasiten.'' He gives here, among other observations, the first 
good description of fungus diseases of the lungs and bronchial tubes 
{Broncho- an (LPneuinotioni yl'osls aspergilllna and Pn. Harcinica). 

His theories furnished the ground work for the later rise of l)acteri- 
ology. It was supposed by many that there was an outspoken oppo- 
sition, or at least a distrust, on Virchow's part of the revolution in 
bacteriological methods which was going on under the leadership of 
Robei't Koch. Nothing could l)e more incorrect. Virchow, who had 
himself done much in the interest of a scientific explanation of the 
many facts which lie had brought to light, had pointed out the direc- 
tion which this ])i-anch of general patholog}'^ was to take, and gladly 
recognized all contributions to the science. It was onl}^ against the 

"I'.crliii, lSt;;5-lS(i7. ''Arcliiv, vol. 9, pp. 557-593. 



RUDt)LPH VIRCHOW, 1S21-1902. 655 

recognition of unproved assumptions, against one-sided investigations 
and conceptions, and ag'aihst premature generalizations that he pro- 
tested, l^he real advances of ivtiological knov.dedge he sought con- 
tiiuially, witli all the weight of his iniluence, to i)roniote and to bring 
t^o general recognition. 

Similar imputations liave been current in regard to liis position 
I'ehitive to another disputed cpiestion, namely, that of Darwinism. He 
had numerous objections to some of the single propositions of the 
Darwinian theory; partieularlj^ as the result of his own obser\'ations 
he recognized more fully than Darwin the pathologic side of the 
(juestion of heredity. According to Virchow the rise of a variety of 
a transmissible character presupposes a ''deviation from the type 
and therefore a pathologic (though l)y no means a diseased) condition 
of the progenitor.''" The role of atavism he was inclined to belittle 
as one of a number of unproved assumptions, l)ut he was a no less 
firm belicAcr in transformism than Darwin and .lohann Fricdrich 
Meckel, whose great service to the theory of descent Virrliow repeat- 
edly and properly emphasized.'' 

How could a man fail to accept Darwinism wiio was so influenced in 
his intellectual development by Goethe '" and under whose hand modern 
anthropology has become what it now is, the scientific stud}^ of man. 
Starting with somatic anthropology, in natural expansion of his field 
of work, in 186G he l)egan his investigations in prehistoric archteology. 
At first he occupied himself with the primitive history of his Ponnne- 
ranian home region, to which as a student he had already devoted some 
historical studies that appeared in the " Baltischen Studien '' and the 
"Pommerschen Volksblatt.*" From this the field of liis investigations 
extended over the whole earth. Contributions from every quarter, 
some gathered in long journeys through Europe, Avestern Asia and 
Egypt, which he took during the vacations, and morc^ collected by the 
arm}^ of scientific discoverers who in the last forty yc^ars have pene- 
trated to all parts of the earth, furnished him with his material. He 
himself grasped the spade and introduced the scientific method in 
archadogical investigation. It is impossible even to mention hei'e all 
his more important investigations and puldications in this and related 
fields during the four busy decades wdiich followed. Only a few can 
l»e touched upon, among them the inc^uiry concerning the origin of 
the luunan race and its dispersion in the course of ages. He published 
numerous articles filled with rich material in the " Zeitschrift fiir 
Ethnologic," largely conducted l)v him, and in the '"'• Verhandlungen 
der Berliner Gessellschaft fiir Anthropology, Ethnologic und

Urgeschichte," of whicli he was almost sole editor. These oomnnini- 
catioiis enil)ra('e, ]>osicles more than a thousand shorter artieles. a series 
of extensive independent pul>lieations of the highest importance. 
Among these latter can he mentioned here only the third volume of 
the magniticent puldieation b}' Stiihel and Reiss on the burial field at 
Ancon and the great work Crania etimica Americana which appeared 
in commemoration of the discovery of America by Columl)us. 

Virchow devoted himself to ethnographic studies no less than to 
other branches of anthropology, and here he became a center to which 
the material streamed in from all sides, and from which went forth 
suggestion, criticism, and energetic assistance. This never-idle man 
did not disdain to teach travelers schooled in other lines of investiga- 
tion the anthropometric methods; and indeed he found time for every- 
thing, and never left a piece of work to others that he could possibly 
undertake himself. Thus, for example, for ten years following its 
inception by him in 1876, he worked up alone the data recorded in 
German schools as to the color of the eyes, the hair, and the skin which 
has proved of such \'alue for the knowledge of the difterent l^ranches 
of the German race. He has reduced ^he ethnology of his homeland 
to a practically complete s^'stem, and his work in this line has fortu- 
nately Ijeen put in shape for popidar appreciation in the Museum fiir 
deutsche Volkstrachten. 

Perhaps one of his greatest services to the science was that he per- 
suaded the visionary dilletante Heinrich Schliemann to undertake with 
Dorpfeld's help a rationally conducted excavation at Troy, and, still 
more, that he succeeded in bringing the treasure digger back with his 
unicpie and invaluable discoveries to the fatherland. They have been 
placed permanently in the Schliemami hall of the Museum fiir Volker- 
kunde where they will riMuain as an enduring monunuMit to J^udolf 
Virchow as well. 

But investigating and collecting were not his only activities, for all 
this time he remained in the first rank of academic teachers, expound- 
ing not only the facts, but the philosophy of medical science. The 
method he em])loyed of teaching pathology was quite his own, but has 
become the example, not only for Germany, but for other civilized 
lands. He has discussed the teaching of pathology in weighty papers," 
and, indeed, on several occasions entered into the discussion of general 
academic instruction and its extension. He was no inflexible supporter 
of the old classic system of education, for in his Rectorates address he 
remarked that linguistic studies might be very well supplanted from a 
pedagogical point of view " l)y the golden triad mathematics, philoso- 
phy, and the natural sciences," ])ut still from consideration of the

sources of our Western culture he could not subscribe to a t-oiuplete 
displacement of classic studies by the modern practical subjects. 

The great pathological and anatomical collections, which are the 
results of the manifold labors of his long life, nuist (^tand in the front 
rank for purposes of instruction in his own brancli of science. 
Although nuich of the material there assembled is primarily adapted 
to purposes of pure scientific inquiry , still the objects were gathered 
by him chiefly with a view to their educational vahu\ It nuist, there- 
fore, have been a g-reat satisfaction to liim to see in tlie newly erected 
pathologic museum a worthy depository for this unecjualed collection. 
In the arrangement of this museum it is not ojdy the directly interested 
scientific circle, but quite as nmch the popular audience whose instruc- 
tion is considered. He formed a special easily accessible exhil)it to 
illustrate to the widest circles the knowledge most valuable to the 
general welfare, just as in his younger days he had not disdained to 
endeavor to awaken in the popular mind by the simplest ways and 
appreciation for the value of science. It would require a special 
article to tell how nmch work he spent on the objects of this collection, 
but an idea of the innnensity of it can l)e gathered from the fact that 
about 23,0()<) preparations in the pathologic nmseum bear labels written 
by Rudolf Virchow. These labels give in the most concise ti^-ms the 
chief result of an often extensive investigation devoted to each sing'le 
object. 

In all the pro])l<MUs to whose investigation he devoted himself, in all 
practical matters which came to his attention, and in every branch of 
science with which Kudolf Virchow engaged he kept in mind the rela- 
tions of th(^ subject to the })ublic life. If at the first attack upon a 
new problem it was the love of knowledge for its own sake which 
spurred him on, yet in every case the wider ap})lication appealed at 
length to the warm heart and ideal loving mind that kept in view in all 
that he did the good of his fellow-men. lie put away each little ego- 
istic striving and devoted his whole strength to the work, never hesi- 
tating to take up matters which hardly required the powers of a Rudolf 
Virchow to accomplish them. He knew that even in our German 
fatherland, penetrated as it is by Kant's philoso})hy, not all men pos- 
sess that degree of trustworthiness which he desired to see in all, but 
which in men of science he held indispensable. Whenever he failed 
of finding exactly the man to do a piece of work he undertook it him- 
self where any particular degree of responsibility rested upon him in 
the matter. A deep inbred modesty kept him from any feeling of 
vanit}^ but it is easy to understand why h(% the deep ])hilosopher and 
the minute observer, after he became acquainted with the real situa- 
tion entered into the political arena. With the keen vision of the stu- 
dent of nature he recognized the real cause of public ill-health could 
only be removed* by a general uplifting of public intelligence, and only 
SM 1903 42 



658 RUDOLPH VIRCHOW, 1821-1902. 

thus could further political degeneration be prevented. His journey 
of investigation in Upper Silesia guve him the first incentive to his 
political activity. Although not naturalh' com>)ative, but rather con- 
templative and conciliatory, he did not lack in personal courage and 
self-f orgetf ulness, and entered into political action without fear of the 
consequences of his outspoken thinking, and the more readily, per- 
haps, when his actions cost him dear. It was thus he entered at first 
into the political agitation and speedily ])ecame the representative of 
the people. The characteristics Avhich distinguished his scientific 
work he placed at the service of the common weal, so that his enemies 
could })ut admit in him an uncommon fullness of knowledge and a sure 
memory, a never satiated desii-e and capacity for work, and, finally, the 
thorough conscienciousness and unassailable veracity of the man of 
science. To be sure he was no political seer, and the practicability of 
many of his reconunendations was disproved in the trial, but on the 
other hand it is certain that he was in many points in the right and 
that it was his scientific habit of thought and the thoroughness of his 
methods of work which, in the thorny paths of the nonprofessional 
parliamentarian as also in municipal life, yielded those results which 
have been of such incalculable value to the hygiene of Berlin. 

Rudolf Yirchow always strove after results, l)ut was little concerned 
for the mere outward signs of them. The presence of the battle steeled 
his courage and sharpened his desire. Small vanity was wholly for- 
eign to him, and ho could detect a flatterer at the first meeting. He 
was receptive only to such recognition as indicated in itself that he was 
rightlv understood, and he made use of such recognition for his own 
guidance, for it showed him the measure of the usefulness of his work 
for the general good better than, in his modesty, he could himself 
have estimated it. It was in this s])irit that ]>oth in politics and in his 
scientific work ho accepted the homage which flowed to him more and 
more as, in the course of the decades, his work widened. He is cele- 
brated in foi-eign lands no less than in (lermany, and he appreciated 
the national signiticance of his honors and n>frained from ])utting them 
off that the prestige of his fatherland might not lack. The more 
Rudolf Virchow became the critical controlling center of (lerman sci- 
ence, as evidenced by his official standing and in particular in his con- 
duct of the great " Berliner Medizinischen Gesellschaft," the " Berliner 
Gesellschaft fiir Anthropologic, Ethnologic und Urgeschichte,'' his 
leading place in (icrman and international scientific congresses," and 

« With his tact and cleverness he chose for tlie subjects of his addresses in foreign 
lands actual or historical presentations from the national tradition of the country in 
question. Thus in Kn<i;lan(l he spoke of (ilisson in "ITber den Wert des pathologi- 
schen Experinieiites." In this address he supported the p]nglish medical profession 
in its battle against the antivivisectionists. In Italy, among others, he chose the 
theme " Morgagni und der anatomische Gedanke" (address before the eleventh inter- 
national medical congress at Rome, 1894). 



RUDOLl'H VIRCHOW, 1821-lJt()li. 859 

hi.s place as an educator, the more be achieved cosmopolitan greatness. 
At this time when hehae but just ceased his heretofore unbroken lal)ors 
it can not yet be appreciated how great he had ])econie and how much 
science lost by his death. 

In this short sketch only the main points can l)e indicated; a later 
time must furnish the historian who shall truly interpret Rudolf Vir- 
chow and his epoch. Then, when all the dociunentary material now 
scattered in contemporary periodicals and in correspondence and 
notices throughout the world is brought together, an adcMpiate view 
can ])c taken of the s[)lendid comliination of human tjualities which 
made the foundation of Rudolf Mrchow's greatness." 

His spirit will ever reside in the fundamental revolution which he 
brought about in medical science^ and ])i'actice, and his work will go on 
in the new paths he opened in all departments of science which he 
entered, and in the methods of investigation which he so unweariedly 
taught. Herein rests the tradition which remains with his disciples, 
and this is their weapon to use for the full freedom of learning and 
objective teaching.
