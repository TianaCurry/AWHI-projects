Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring'), That there be printed 
of the Report of the Smithsonian Institution and of the National Museum for the years 
ending June 30, 1886 and 1887, in two octavo volumes for each year, 16,000 extra copies 
of each, of which 3,000 copies shall be for the use of the Senate, 6,000 copies for the 
use of the House of Representatives, aud 7,000 copies for the use of the Smithsonian 
Institution.

REPORT UPON THE CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE U. S. NATIONAL 
MUSEUM DURING THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1887, 



A.— GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. 

The report now presented relates to the period between June 30, 1886, 
and July 1, 1887. Before the completion of the report the Museum had 
suffered the loss of him who had been for ten years its official head, and 
who, from the very beginning of the Museum work of the Smithsonian 
Institution, had been its chief administrator and promoter. Although 
it is proper that any extended statement concerning Professor Baird 
and his relation to the Museum should be reserved for the report for 
the year in which his death occurred, it seems to be proper to refer in 
this place to the beginning of his protracted illness, in the fall of 1886, 
and to the year of sadness which followed, in which none of his assist- 
ants and associates could possibly feel the usual enthusiasm or interest 
in the work in which he had always been their leader as well as their 
director and counselor. 

The work of the Museum was carried forward during the year in the 
customary way, and the amount of actual routine work accomplished 
has perhaps not been less than in previous years.. There is, however, 
less of interest to chronicle in the way of new enterprises, and scarcely 
more will be attempted at this time than the customary statement of 
the progress of administrative routine. 

One of the last official acts of the late Secretary was to request the 
Board of Regents, at its meeting on the 12th of January, 1887, to ap- 
point two Assistant Secretaries of the Smithsonian Institution, who 
should relieve the Secretary of a portion of his official duties. By the 
appointment of Professor Langley to the position of Assistant Secre- 
tary in charge of Exchanges, Publications, and Library, and of myself 
as Assistant Secretary in charge of the National Museum, it was the 
definite purpose of the late Secretary to effect a return to the system 
of organization which existed at the time of his first connection with 
the Smithsonian Institution in 18 ">0, when the senior Assistant Secre- 
tary was officially in charge of the Library, and the junior Assistant 
Secretary — himself— -in charge of the Museum collections. It was Pro- 
fessor Baird's earnest desire that, so far as the Museum was concerned, 
the appointment of* its executive officer to an assistant secretaryship 

3 



4 REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

should lead to the strengthening of the bond of union between the 
Institution and the National Museum, a bond which, although nomi- 
nally the same as it was twenty-eight years ago, had, as a matter of fact, 
become somewhat less definite and intimate. 

The relations of the Museum to the Interior Department, as they now 
exist, are undefined and complicated, and it is important that early steps 
should be takan to secure that definite control over the Museum, on the 
part of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, which in later years 
it became more and more evident that it was the desire of Professor 
Baird to emphasize. 

On the 10th of February, 1887, Professor Baird relinquished his 
active administrative control of the Institution and the Museum into 
the hands of the senior Assistant Secretary, who was at that time 
designated Acting Secretary, and from that time forward his failing 
strength prevented him from further efforts in its behalf. In the midst 
of his illness, however, he found time in July to arrange for a collecting 
expedition from Wood's Holl to Nantucket, for the purpose of obtaining 
a collection of sharks, and the letter which he wrote at that time shows 
that the Museum was in his mind to the last. 

During the same summer he took advantage of a long-cherished plan 
for sending a Museum expedition to the islands in the Gulf of St. Law- 
rence to search for the remains of the long extinct Great Auk, by 
sending two collectors upon the Pish Commission schooner Grampus, 
which went to that region for the purpose of investigating the fish- 
eries.* 

B.— THE MUSEUM STAFF. 

Few changes have been made during the year in the arrangement of 
the Museum staff. Prof. O. C. Marsh, of Yal*e College, whose high 
reputation as a paleontologist is familiar to all, and who has for many 
years been in charge of the vertebrate paleontological work of the U. S. 
Geological Survey, was early in the year appointed curator of the 
department of Vertebrate Fossils. Mr. S. P. Koehler, of Eoxbury, a 
well-known authority upon the art of engraving, and custodian of the 
Gray Collection in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, has undertaken 
to give a portion of his time to the arrangement of the collections of 
engravings, and has been appointed acting curator of the section of 
Graphic Arts. 

Mr. A. Howard Clark has been requested to undertake the editorial 
work in connection with the Proceedings and Bulletin of the Museum, 
by this arrangement relieving Dr. Bean, who, since 1875, has performed 
this duty in addition to that of curator of Fishes. 

The thirty-one departments and sections now recognized in the Mu- 
seum are administrated by twenty-six curators and acting curators, 
of whom nine receive salaries from the Museum appropriation, while

1888.

6 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

C— THE CONDITION OF THE COLLECTIONS. 

The general condition of the collections is fairly satisfactory ; for, 
although greatly hampered by lack of room, and impeded by the in- 
creasing amount of unproductive routine, such as the examination of 
material for correspondents and the preparations for participation in 
exhibitions in other cities, the curators have succeeded in bringing 
the material under their charge more fully under control than it had 
hitherto been and in preventing auy deterioration in its condition. 

CENSUS OF THE COLLECTIONS. 

The recent extensions of the collections are indicated by the accom- 
panying table. No enumeration was made in 1885, and the variation 
between the tables for 1884 and 1886 exhibits the increase during 
eighteen months, from December, 1884, to June, 1886.

The words "accession," "specimen," and "catalogue entry" are by 
no means synonymous. An accession may consist of several classes of 
objects, or may be a single specimen, or may include several specimens 
of only one class. A specimen is a single object. A catalogue entry rep- 
resents one or more specimens of a class, and may include hundreds of 
individual objects. The number of catalogue entries during the year, 
as shown in tbe following table, is perhaps the best criterion of the im- 
portance of the accessions to the collections, since they represent the 
number of separate "lots" not only received but of sufficient value to 
bo added to the collections. It frequently happens that material is re- 
ceived which is of no value and is therefore not entered on the catalogue.

8 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

PROGRESS IN CLASSIFICATION AND ARRANGEMENT OF THE STUDY 

SERIES. 

The final classification and arrangement of the material is a work of 
great moment,- and the curator who makes progress in this direction is 
forwarding the legitimate objects of the Museum quite as much as if 
his whole time had been devoted to the acquirement of new material. 
Until a collection has been classified and arranged, it is of little or no 
use to visitors and students. Referring to the zoological collections, 
Professor Henry wrote in his report for 1856: "However valuable 
these collections may be in themselves, they are but the rough materials 
from which science is to be evolved, and so long as the specimens re- 
main undescribed and their places undetermined in the system of or- 
ganized beings, though they may serve to gratify an unenlightened 
curiosity, they are of no importance in the display of the laws of life." 

The reports of the curators for the year give evidence of a steady for- 
ward movement in the work of classification and arrangement. 

DEVELOPMENT OF THE EXHIBITION SERIES. 

The general appearance of the exhibition halls has been somewhat 
improved during the year. The Grant relics have been placed in cases 
and have proved of much interest to the visitors. Considerable material 
has been gathered for the collection illustrating the graphic arts. 

The east and west halls have been made attractive by the installation 
of the ethnological collection. The arrangement of Eskimo tools and 
implements is very satisfactory. The arch geological collection is still 
exhibited in the upper floor of the Smithsonian building, and its ar- 
rangement is thorough and excellent. New cases have been constructed 
for the mammal collection, which is now being overhauled with a view 
to introducing a more satisfactory system of classification. The collec- 
tion of birds still remains in the Smithsonian building, and although 
the hall, in which it is now, is entirely unfit for the purpose, no 
change for the better can be made until an additional building has 
been provided. There are now 7,000 specimens of birds on exhibi- 
tion. The reptile collection is still stored away in the laboratory of the 
department on account of lack of room, a few casts of snakes and turtles, 
which are exhibited in the Smithsonian building, being the only rep- 
resentatives of tbis collection. The exhibition series of fishes, now 
numbering 34,000 specimens, is still unprovided with proper accommo- 
dations, and is installed temporarily in the Smithsonian building. The 
department of Mollusks has filled a few cases in the Smithsonian build- 
ing with very interesting material., but nothing more can be done at 
present on account of lack of room. The same may be said in regard 
to the department of Insects, whose exhibit, when proper space can be 
provided, will probably become one of the most popular in the Museum. 
The ostcological hall continues to present a very satisfactory appearance, 
which is enhanced by the effective method of labeling and installation 



REPOET OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 9 

which has been adopted. The curators of the several divisions of the 
department of Invertebrate Fossils are still unprovided with exhibition 
space. An immense quantity of material in each of these sections is 
ready for exhibition, and a special effort will be made during the autumn 
to .provide in some measure for their exigencies. The collections of 
fossil and recent plants are provisionally arranged upon the south 
balcony, where they are at all times accessible to students. The curator 
of Minerals is giving much attention to building up the collection of me- 
teorites. Several new cases have been constructed for the lithological 
hall, which will afford some relief to the unavoidably crowded condition 
of this collection. In this hall is being gathered together a valuable 
collection of relief maps and models showing the geological features of 
various parts of the United States. 



D.— REVIEW OF THE TEAR'S WORK IK THE SCIENTIFIC 

DEPARTMENTS. 

DIVISION OF ANTHROPOLOGY. 

DEPARTMENT OF ARTS AND INDUSTRIES. 

It has seemed desirable to continue the existence of the so-called 
department of Arts and Industries, as a convenient means of grouping 
together a number of special collections not elsewhere assigned, although 
the scope of this department is much less extensive than it was before 
the organization of the department of Ethnology, to which properly be- 
longs a very large proportion of the objects formerly assigned to the 
department of Arts and Industries. 

In this department, under the charge of a number of special curators, 
are included at present the various technological collections, which are 
for the most part made up of materials derived from the civilized races 
of mankind. 

In the hall containing the Fisheries collection very little has been done 
since its formal opening to the public in April, 1SS4. Its arrangement 
had at that time been so thoroughly completed that this section was 
considered to be more nearly in a finished condition than any other in 
the Museum, and there was little left to be desired in the way of addi- 
tional material. The collection is still under the charge of Mr. R. 
Edward Earll, one of the assistants in the Fish Commission, who has 
been so much occupied by his regular official duties that he has had 
little time to devote either to this or to the other collection of which he 
has voluntarily assumed the care, that of the Animal Products, which 
was thoroughly adjusted after its return from the New Orleans Exposi- 
tion in the spring of 1885. 

The section of Naval Architecture is also under the charge of an 
honorary curator attached to the Fish Commission, who has been con- 



10 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887 



stantly absent from the city, and there is little to report in the way 
of addition or change. 

The section of Transportation, closely related to that of Naval Archi- 
tecture, is under the charge of Mr. J. E. Watkius, of Philadelphia, who 
continues to act as honorary curator, and whose plans were described 
at length in his report presented last year. Owing to lack of space in 
the exhibition halls, no new steps have been taken in the development 
of the collection, although there are known to be numerous important 
objects which can be secured whenever arrangements shall have been 
made for their reception. 

The absence in Japan of Mr. Eomyn Hitchcock has necessitated a 
suspension of operations in the sections of Foods and Textile Industries. 

The collections of Musical Instruments and Ceramics have received 
a number of important additions. 

The Materia Medica collection is still under the charge of Dr. H. G. 
Beyer, U. S. Navy, who has been carrying forward with great industry 
the general plans adopted at the time of the establishment of this sec- 
tion in 1881, and who reports that up to the present time the arrange- 
ment and labeling of 1,970 specimens had been completed. Dr. Beyer 
has carried on a number of experiments in pharmaco-physiology and 
has published several papers. This work of investigation has been car- 
ried on chiefly at the laboratories of the Naval Museum of Hygiene in 
Washington, and of Johns Hopkins University. Incidentally Dr. Beyer 
had devoted a considerable amount of time to devising methods for 
preservation of the perishable animal and vegetable substances of which 
the bulk of the Materia Medica collection is composed, and reports that 
he has found bichloride of mercury to be the most satisfactory germicide. 
Seventy-three entries have been made in the catalogue during the year. 
The total number of specimens registered is 5,516, there being 3,488 in 
the exhibition series and 500 duplicates. 

The collection of historical and personal relics, coins, medals, en- 
graved portraits, and similar objects, is gradually increasing, though 
without direct effort, and Mr. A. Howard Clark, foe some time attached 
to the Museum, has begun the work of cataloguing and arranging them. 
It would appear that no part of the work is more attractive to the visitor 
than that in which are displayed the personal relics of Washington, 
Franklin, Jefferson, and the other statesmen and soldiers identified 
with the early history of the nation, and its interest has been greatly 
increased during the year by the addition of the Grant collection of ob- 
jects, including the swords and military and civil testimonials belonging 
to General U. S. Grant. These had been purchased by Mr. W. H. Van- 
derbilt, and by him given to Mrs. Grant in trust to hold during the life- 
time of General Grant, and at his death, or sooner, at her option, to be- 
come the property of the United States Government. In accordance 
with Mrs. Grant's request, the transfer of this collection was made by 



EEPOET OF ASSISTANT KECEETARY. 11 

Mr. Vanderbilt in 1885, and a copy of his letter to the President of the 
United States transmitting the deed of trust is here given : 

640 Fifth Avenue, January 20, 1885. 
Dear Sir : I purchased the articles of historical interest belonging to General Grant 
and gave them to Mrs, Grant in trust, to hold during the life-time of the general, and 
at his death, or sooner, at her option, they to hecome the property of the Government. 
They consist of his swords, memorials of his victories, from the United States and 
cities, and tributes to his fame and achievements from Governments all over the world. 
In their proper place at Washington they will always he secure, and will afford pleas- 
ure and instruction to succeeding generations. This trust has been accepted by Mrs. 
Grant, and the disposition of the articles is in conformity with the wishes of the gen- 
eral. I transmit to you herewith the deed of trust. Mrs. Grant informs me that she 
prefers to close the trust at once and send the memorials to Washington. May I ask, 
therefore, that you will designate some official representing the proper department to 
receive them, and direct him to notify Mrs. Grant of the arrangements necessary to 
perfect the transfer and deposit in such of the Government buildings as may be most 
suitable? 

Yours, respectfully, 

W. H. Vanderbilt. 
His Excellency Chester A. Arthur, 

President of the United States. 

The matter was formally brought to the attention of Congress by the 
President of the United States in a message dated February 3, 1885, a 
copy of which follows : 

To the House of Representatives : 

I take especial pleasure in laying before Congress the generous offer made by Mrs. 
Grant to give to the Government, in perpetual trust, the swords and military and 
civil testimonials lately belonging to General Grant. A copy of the deed of trust, and 
of a letter addressed to me by Mr. W. H. Vanderbilt, which I transmit herewith, will 
explain the nature and motives of this offer. 

Appreciation of General Grant's achievements and recognition of his just fame have 
in part taken the shape of numerous mementoes and gifts which, while dear to him, 
possess for the nation an exceptional interest. These relics, of great historical value, 
have passed into the hands of another, whose considerate action has restored the col- 
lection to Mrs. Grant as a life trust, on the condition that at the death of Geueral 
Grant, or sooner, at Mrs. Grant's option, it should become the property of the Govern- 
ment. * * * In the exercise of the option thus given her Mis. Grant elects that 
the trust shall forthwith determine, and asks that the Government designate a suit- 
able place of deposit and a responsible custodian for the collection. 

The nature of this gift and the value of the relics which the generosity of a private 
citizen, joined to the high sense of public regard which animates Mrs. Grant, has 
thus placed at the disposal of the Government, demand full and signal recognition 
on behalf of the nation at the hands of its representatives. I therefore ask Congress 
to take suitable action to accept the trust and to provide for its custody, at the same 
time recording the appreciative gratitude of the people of the United States to the 

donors. * * * 

Chester A. Arthur. 
Executive Mansion, February 3, 1885. 

In the mean time the collection was placed in charge of the War 

Department until definite action had been taken by Congress, and on 

August 5, 1886, the following resolution was adopted and became a law ; 

Whereas Julia Dent Grant and William H. Vanderbilt, by deed of trust executed 
on the tenth day of January, eighteen hundred and eighty-live, presented to the 



12 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

United States certain swords, medals, paintings, bronzes, portraits, commissions, and 
addresses and objects of value and art presented by various Governments in the 
world to General Ulysses S. Grant as tokens of their high appreciation of his illus- 
trious character as a soldier and a statesman : Therefore, 

Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, That the United States accept, with grateful acknowledgment, 
the said property and articles more fully described in the schedule attached to said 
deed of trust, to be held by the United States and preserved and protected in the 
city of Washington for the use and inspection of the people of the United States. 

Sec. 2. That the said property and articles be placed under the custody of the Di- 
rector of the National Museum, and he is hereby directed to receive the same for safe 
keepiug therein. 

Approved August 5, 1886. 

The collection was transferred to the National Museum in November, 
18S6. A complete catalogue of the objects in this collection is given in 
the list of accessions, under No. 18528. 

During the year has been commenced the formation of a collection of 
moneys of the world, exhibiting the metallic and paper currency in 
use at the present time, and the moneys of the ancient world. Several 
thousand specimens have been received by gift and loan, and a con- 
siderable number of them have been put on exhibition. In preparing 
the labels an attempt has been made to show the monetary standard 
of different nations and give the origin of each denomination. 

The principal activity in this department has been in the promotion 
of the collection of Graphic Arts, for which provision was made in the 
general plan of classification proposed six years ago, and materials for 
which have since been accumulating so rapidly that it has become 
necessary to make some provision for their installation. In December, 
1882, Mr. S. E. Koehler, of Boston, was invited to undertake the instal- 
lation of an exhibition collection, illustrating the method of lithography, 
which had been presented to the National Museum by Mr. Louis Prang, 
and the preparation of a manual in connection with the same. At that 
time Mr. Peter Morau, of Philadelphia, was preparing for the Museum 
a series of plates illustrating the process of etching, and a set of etcher's 
tools. This was to form a basis for the etching collection. The Helio- 
type Company, the Photo-Engraving Company of New York, and sev- 
eral other firms and individuals, had tendered their cooperation. The 
Director of the United States Mint has offered to illustrate the art of 
die cutting, and Eiugler & Co., of New York, have in hand the illustra- 
tion of the process of electro typing. 

An excellent nucleus for a collection representing the graphic arts 
seemed to be available, but active steps towards its installation were 
materially retarded by the preparation of exhibits for the London 
Fisheries Exhibition in 1883, and for the New Orleans and other expo- 
sitions in 1884. Matters did not take any definite shape until De- 
cember 11, 1880, when Mr. Koehler was appointed acting curator of 
the section of Graphic Arts, 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 13 

Offers -of several collections additional to those already mentioned 
have recently been made. Hoen & Co., of Baltimore, are preparing an 
exhibit of the lithocaustic process. Mr. Charles Henry Hart, of Phila- 
delphia, has given a number of specimens of work of the earlier Ameri- 
can engravers. Messrs. Thomas Hovenden, Stephen Parrish, Peter 
Moran, James D. Smillie, Charles H. Miller, Alfred Kappes, Henry 
Farrer, and F. Juangling, of New York, have promised to contribute 
etchings and drawings. Mr. W. J. Linton, of New Haven, presents a 
collection of proofs, including both his own work and that of some En- 
glish wood engravers. He has also promised a number of fac-similes of 
old work, collected by himself. The Century Company offers a techni- 
cal collection — blocks, tools, etc. — drawings showing the various styles 
employed in designing for engravings, some of the process work done 
for them, and a series of proofs chronologically arranged. Harper & 
Brothers promise specimens of their work dating from the organization 
of their house, if possible. Mr. J. W. Osborne, of Washington, has a 
large and very interesting collection of early attempts in various pro- 
cesses, many of the specimens being undoubtedly unique, and this he 
wishes to present to the Museum if assured that it would be properly 
cared for. The Photogravure Company has offered to make a techni- 
cal exhibit. 

Arrangements have been made with the School of Drawing and Paint- 
ing at the Museum of Fine Arts at Roxbury, Massachusetts, for a set of 
students' drawings illustrating various technical methods, and a selec- 
tion of the best drawings will be made. The Art Students' League, in 
New York, will probably make a similar contribution. Among the 
latest accessions to this section is a machine said to have been invented 
and used by Joseph Saxton for engraving on copper plate. 

DEPARTMENT. OF ETHNOLOGY. 

The additions to the ethnological collections have this year been of 
extraordinary value, and are described in the appended report of Pro- 
fessor Mason upon the work of his department. Nearly 2,500 entries 
have been made in the ethnological catalogue, and the work of classi- 
fying and arranging the great accumulations of the past has been act- 
ively continued. The results of the curator's labors in this direction 
will be more fully seen, as soon as certain proposed re-arrangements in 
the exhibition halls have .made it possible to assign additional space 
and to construct more suitable exhibition cases. Special attention has 
been paid to the entire Eskimo collection, which is an exceedingly rich 
one, and probably unsurpassed even by the famous one of similar 
nature in the Ethnographic Museum at Copenhagen. In this work the 
curator has been assisted by Lieut. T. Dix Bolles, IT. S. Navy, who, 
having been stationed for some years on the northwest coast, was 
familiar with the customs of the Eskimo race and especially well suited 
for this work. In this connection Lieutenant Bolles has prepared an 



14 KEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 188?. 

exhaustive catalogue of the Eskimo collection in the National Museum, 
with indications of the localities in which the specimens were obtained. 
This geographical list is published in Section in of this report. It will 
be especially serviceable to collectors in the Arctic regions, who will be 
able at a glance to determine whether or not certain forms of imple- 
ments are represented in the national collection. 

Mr. L. M. Turner, formerly a Signal Service observer in Alaska and 
Labrador, has prepared for the use of this department an elaborate 
manuscript report relating to the Eskimo objects collected by himself 
and now in the Museum. 

Paymaster E. B. Webster, IT. S. Navy, also an experienced Alaskan 
traveler, was for six months detailed by the Navy Department for serv- 
ice in the National Museum, and rendered valuable assistance to the 
curator of ethnology. 

Among the studies in progress in this department two have been 
brought to completion, and the results have been published in Section 
in of this report in the form of illustrated papers upon "The Human 
Beast of Burden" and "Cradles of the American Aborigines." 

The methods of classification and arrangement now experimentally 
employed in the National Museum have given rise to much discussion, as 
it was but natural that they should, since they are so thoroughly unlike 
those employed in any of the other museums of the world. The con- 
ditions of growth and the character of the collections in the Museum 
have been from the start peculiar, and the adoption of novel means of 
administration was found to be necessary. In the first separate report 
upon Museum work, published in 1881, certain suggestions were made 
which became the subject of vigorous criticism on the part of some of 
the scientific journals. Passing reference has been made to this matter 
in previous reports, and it is ])robable that a full discussion of the sub- 
ject may be undertaken hereafter. During the present year a very 
interesting debate has taken place in the columns of " Science" in regard 
to the proper method of arrangement of ethnological collections. The 
discussion was opened by Dr. Franz Boas, a German ethnologist, now 
a resident of New York, and was participated in by Professor Mason, 
Major J. W. Powell, and Mr. William H. Dall. 

SECTION OF AMERICAN ABORIGINAL POTTERY. 

Mr. W. H. Holmes, the curator of this department, has completed 
his studies of the wonderful pottery collection from Chiriqui, in Nica- 
ragua. He reports that much valuable new material has been acquired, 
especially noteworthy having been that obtained through the agency 
of the Bureau of Ethnology, in the collections purchased from Dr. 
Edward Palmer and Mr. W. E. Curtis. 

Col. James Stevenson, of the Geological Survey, has transferred to 
this department a series of Pueblo pottery, ancient and modern, col- 
lected by himself in 1881, and Dr. Cyrus Thomas, of the Bureau of 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 15 

Ethnology, made some collections of pottery in the Mississippi Valley 
and the eastern states. A number of interesting pieces of Mexican and 
Peruvian work has been acquired by exchange. 

The catalogue records show that 1,022 entries have been made during 
the year. 

DEPARTMENT OF ARCHAEOLOGY. 

The report of the curator, Dr. Charles Bau, consists chiefly of a geo- 
graphical review of the principal accessions. Among these may be 
mentioned as especially valuable the collection of Mr. Thomas Wilson, 
made in Europe, embracing drift and cave relics of the paleolithic age, 
objects belonging to the neolithic age and the bronze period, and speci- 
mens of Etruscan and Eoman origin. 

The curator is writing a work upon North American antiquities, to 
be entitled, " The Typical Forms of North American Prehistoric Relics 
of Stone and Copper in the U. S. National Museum." 

There have been 3,863 entries made in the catalogue during the year. 
The total number of specimens is 101,G59, of which a large proportion 
has been received through Major J. W. Powell, director of the Bureau 
of Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution. 

The failing health of the curator has made it necessary for him to be 
absent during a portion of the year, and but little has been accomplished 
beyond the necessary routine work of the Department. 

During the year the Museum was so fortunate as to secure a val- 
uable accession from Easter Island, comprising two of the celebrated 
stone images, a large number of painted and carved slabs from the 
rock houses, and a choice collection of objects illustrating the ancient 
and modern history of the island. The last-named specimens have been 
lent to the Museum by Paymaster William J. Thomson, U. S. Navy. 

Professor Baird made frequent attempts to secure specimens of the 
archseology of this island, and in 1885 received from Commodore John 
G. Walker, Chief of the Bureau of Navigation, the gratifying intelli- 
gence that the TJ. S. S. Mohican would be sent to Easter Island to 
relieve some American sailors who had been reported as castaways 
there. This expedition met with signal success. The Mohican an- 
chored in Cook Bay in December, and spent twelve days there. A 
thorough survey of the island was made, and everything was secured 
which would enable the explorers to make a thorough report. 

The specimens were brought to Panama by the Mohican. The Pana- 
ma Eailroad Company kindly forwarded the collections across the Isth- 
mus to Aspinwall, and they were brought to Washington in the U. S. S. 
Galena. 

Easter Island is a small volcanic projection, 12 miles long and 4 miles 
wide, isolated from all other habitable parts of the globe, the nearest 
land being about 2,000 miles away. 

The Easter Island images are the most interesting of the archaeologi- 
cal enigmas. There are over 600 of them on this island. Formerly 



10 EEPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 188?. 

they stood in groups of six to twelve on platforms of hewed stone facing 
the sea ; but in later years they have been thrown down during the 
civil strife among the natives. Most of them are to be found on hill- 
sides at the eastern end of the island. They were hewn out of volcanic 
tufa in the center of an extinct volcano, and transported over its sides, 
sometimes 3 or 4 miles, to their destination. The island is almost 
treeless, and the wonder is how savages could remove objects fragile 
as these, weighing from 3 to 30 tons each, over a country so rugged. 
The images exhibited in the National Museum, together with many 
other objects of ethnological interest, were procured during a twelve- 
days' visit. 

There are now about 400 people living on the island, and they are of 
pure Polynesian stock. They know nothing whatever of the erection 
of these images, and it is quite possible that they are the descendants 
of a later migration. The following brief description of the objects in 
this collection may be found interesting: 

Eo. 1. Stone image, weighing about 3 tons and about 8 feet in height 
by 4 in width, showing head, shoulders, and bust, but only outline of 
arms, the latter not distinct from the body, but a slightly raised surface 
carved straight down the side, with the forearms placed across the 
stomach at right angles, fingers touching and slightly interlaced. Be- 
low this point the general shape of the monolith is square. 

No. 2. Block of red tufa, or calcareous rock, porous and brittle, 
slightly oval shaped, square on top, with slightly convex base. Sup- 
posed to be a crown for image. 

No. 3. Image (bead and shoulders) composed of or cut from substance 
resembling sandstone, measuring about 26 inches across shoulders and 
about 40 in height. Mouth small, lips very thin, nose and ears well 
defined and abnormally large. Eyes are simply deep recesses. 

Nos. 4 and 5. Stone slabs, with hieroglyphics in reddish-brown and 
white color traced upon them. Average thickness about 3 inches. 
Length and width about 4 feet by 2. 

Nos. 6, 7, and 8. Stone slabs, similar to, but smaller than, the above, 
and hieroglyphics more indistinct. 

No. 9. Stone slab slightly larger and heavier than Nos. 4 or 5, with 
diagonal and horizontal lines. 

No. 10. Small, irregular shaped porous stone, with an indistinct hiero- 
glyphic cut iuto it. Weighs about 25 pounds. 

No. 11. Stone about three times as large as No. 10, having numerous 
hieroglyphics cut into it. Weight about 60 pounds. 

No. 12. Small stone of about the same size and weight as No. 10, on 
which is a rude carving representing a human head and features. 

Nos. 13, 14, 15, and 16. Small slabs, seemingly of iron ore, very brit- 
tle. No tracings, carvings, or hieroglyphics anywhere visible. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 17 

DIVISION OF ZOOLOGY. 

DEPARTMENT OF MAMMALS. 

The most important work has been the commencement of a re-ar- 
rangement of the exhibition hall. The cases previously in use were 
found unsuitable, and others of a new model have been substituted. 
An exceedingly fine series of buffalo skins and skeletons from Montana 
has been added to the collection, as the result of the expedition sent 
out under the leadership of Mr. Hornaday. 

Among the most valuable accessions may be mentioned the gifts of 
Dr. J. C. Merrill, U. S. Army ; Mr. John Gundlach, Mr. C. B. Cory, and 
Mr. Anastasio Alfaro. The Zoological Society of Philadelphia and the 
Central Park Menagerie of New Tork have presented several animals 
in captivity. From the old world accessions have been received from 
Mr. E. Hargitt, and from the Fish Acclimatization Society of Ballarat. 
Among aquatic mammals obtained, may be mentioned a skeleton of an 
adult male West India monk seal, Monaclius tropicalis, purchased from 
Mr. H. A. Ward. Capt. M. A. Healy, of the U. S. Kevenue Marine, 
presented three skins of the ribbon seal, Phoca fasciata. The U. S. 
Fish Commission secured some harbor seals off Wood's Holl, Massa- 
chusetts. Specimens of porpoise were presented by Lieut. Commander 
n. E. Nichols, TJ. S. Navy, and skeletons of the common dolphin, 
pygmy sperm whale, and short-finned blackfish were received from Mr. 
Bayley T. Barco, keeper of the U. S. Life-Saving Station at Dam Neck 
Mills, North Carolina. In this connection reference should be made 
to the continuance by the Superintendent and officials of the U. S. Life- 
Saving Service of their courteous cooperation in notifying the Museum 
of the stranding of cetaceans and in attending to the shipment of speci- 
mens to Washington. 

Specimens representing 27 species have been added to the exhibition 
series during the year. There are now 752 specimens in the exhibition 
series and 4,088 in the study series. The alcoholic series numbers 2,971. 

The curator, Mr. F. W. True, has been occupied most of the time 
available for study in completing his " Review of the Species of the 
Family Delphinidce." He has also made a special study of the color 
variations of the puma, Fells concolor. 

DEPARTMENT OF BIRDS. 

The accessions received by this department during the year have 
been numerous and important, and the curator, Mr. Robert Bidgway, 
has made in his report special mention of 59 as being of peculiar in- 
terest. The amount of literary work accomplished is exemplified by 
the fact that 92 papers, based upon the collection, have been published 
during the year. Of this number, 59 were written by the curator and 
assistant curator, Dr. Leonhard Stejneger. 

Mr. Bidgway has completed his series of analytical keys to North 
American birds, which is being issued by a. Philadelphia publisher under 
H, Mis, QOQ, pt. 2 2 



18 KEPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

the title U A Manual of North American Birds." The assistant curator 
has continued his researches in Japanese ornithology, and reports upon 
several families have been already completed. These studies are of 
great importance, and are based on what is believed to be the richest 
collection of Japanese birds extant. The assistant curator has also 
worked up an interesting collection of birds from the island of Kanai, 
one of the Hawaiian group. That portion of the collection for which 
suitable provision has been made, is reported to be in excellent condi- 
tion, and it is expected that during the next year it will be practicable 
to improve the condition of the exhibition series, which is suffering for 
want of insect-proof cases. The total number of specimens in this 
department is estimated to be 54,987, of which 40,875 belong to the re- 
serve series, 7,000 are on exhibition, and 7,112 have been assigned to 
the duplicate series. 

SECTION OF BIRDS' EGGS. 

The collection of birds' eggs and nests was first properly arranged in 
1884 by Capt. Charles E. Beudire, U. S. Army, who has since that 
year been acting as honorary curator. At that time the total number 
of eggs entered on the catalogue was 40,072, of which 8,000 beautifully 
prepared specimens have been contributed by Captain Bendire. There 
are now in the collection 45,938 specimens of eggs and 2,235 nests. 
An exhibition of birds' eggs would be of popular interest. Among the 
most generous contributors to the collection during the past year were 
Lieut. H. C. Benson, U. S. Army; Lieut. G. M. Stoney, U. S. Navy; 
Dr. A. K. Fisher, Department of Agriculture; Col. N. S. Goss; Capt. 
B. F. Goss; Mr. H. W. Henshaw; Mr. William Brewster; Mr. Loren 
W. Green, and Mr. J. Parker Norris. 

The accessions for the year number 1,208 specimens, which have 
been classified and arranged. Measurements and records of 7,125 
specimens have been made, and 235 nests have been mounted, labeled, 
and arranged for exhibition. A portion of the reserve series of eggs, 
which now includes 32,899 specimens, has also been relabeled and 
classified according to the nomenclature of the checklist recently pub- 
lished by the American Ornithologists' Union. 

DEPARTMENT OE REPTILES AND BATRACHIANS. 

Active work in this department, under the honorary curatorship 
of Dr. H. C. Yarrow, U . S. Army, has been confined chiefly to the pres- 
ervation of new material and general routine work. The laboratory 
rooms have been closed during the fire-proofing of the west end of the 
Smithsonian building. 

Some interesting accessions have been received during the year, not- 
ably of Corean serpents presented by Dr. N. McP. Ferebee, U. S. Navy ; 
Mr. C. J. Herring; and Mr. D. Ridgway, of Wheatland, Indiana; and 
to this gentleman the Museum is indebted for previous co-operation, 



EEPOET OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 19 

Lieut. Commander H. E. Nichols, XL S. Navy ; Eusigu W. E. Safford, U. 
S. Navy, and Charles H. Townsend sent large collections. Hon. V. O. 
King, U. S. consul-general at Bogota, United States of Colombia, sent a 
large and valuable general collection, including some interesting species 
of snakes. 

The curator has published a paper on the "Recurrence of Symptoms 
of Poisoning after Snake-bites." He has also prepared a paper entitled 
"Poisonous Reptiles of the United States." Prof. E. D. Cope, for sev- 
eral years a collaborator of the Smithsonian Institution, prepared a 
"Catalogue of the Reptiles and JBatrachians of Central America and 
Mexico." This is now in the hands of the printer and will be published 
as Bulletin 32 of the U. S. National Museum. 

Professor Cope has also prepared a monograph of the Batrachians 
of North America, the manuscript of which has been sent to the printer, 
and which will be published as Bulletin 34, U. S. National Museum. 

The collection of reptiles is in good condition, and now includes 
27,542 specimens. 

DEPARTMENT OF FISHES. 

The annual rate of increase of specimens in the collection of fishes 
continues to be exceedingly large. In 1882, Dr. T. H. Bean, the curator, 
reported that the collection contained not less than 50,000 specimens, 
and in the present year the total number is estimated at 100,000. The 
recent increase is largely due to the U. S. Fish Commission, which has 
contributed twelve of the most important accessions received during the 
year, while many other interesting contributions have been made by 
agents of the Fish Commission in various parts of the country. The 
officers of the Navy Department have, as usual, co-operated zealously 
with the interests of this department, and five very interesting collec- 
tions have been received in this way. The curator has, during the year, 
been relieved of his duties as editor of the "Proceedings" and "Bul- 
letins," a duty which he undertook many years ago. 

The literary work of this department has been extensive, and in the 
bibliography there are noticed no less than thirty-six papers which 
have been published during the year, based upon the collection. 

The curator is engaged in several investigations, one of the most im- 
portant of which has for its object the publication of a synopsis of the 
Salmon family of North America, their study and identification. 

There are now 34,000 specimens of fishes in the exhibition series, 
41,000 in the reserve series, and 25,000 duplicates. 

Dr. Beau, at the request of Professor Baird, accompanied the U. S, 
Fish Commission schooner Grampits in its cruise along the middle and 
southern Atlantic coast with a view to investigating the spring mack 
erel fishery, in the months of April and May. A report of this expedi- 
tion will be published by the U. S. Fish Commission. 



20 KEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

DEPARTMENT OF MOLLUSKS (INCLUDING CENOZOIC INVERTEBRATE FOSSILS). 

From the report of Dr. W. H. Dall, curator of this department, it 
will be seen that seventy-five accessions were received during the year, 
including some 32,000 specimens. Some are of great extent and value, 
those perhaps most worthy of mention being the series of deep-sea 
mollusks dredged by the U. S. S. Blake and presented by Prof. 
Alexander Agassiz, the types of a report on the mollusks of the Blake 
expedition by Mr. Dall, and a valuable series of mollusks dredged in 
the Gulf of Mexico and the Bahamas, presented by Dr. W. H. Rush, 
U. S. Navy. The curator has made a special study of the mollusks of 
the Blake collection. The investigation of the mollusks from later Ter- 
tiary beds of South Florida is still in progress. Mr. Dall has also made 
studies upon a collection of mollusks obtained by the Jeannette Expe- 
dition at Benuett Island, has carried on his work upon the general 
Floridian and Gulf fauna, and on the geology of South Florida, besides 
working up several collections made by L. M. Turner in Labrador, by 
Nicholas Grebnitzki in Bering Sea, and by himself in several parts of 
northern Alaska. 

Dr. R. E. C. Stearns, the adjunct curator, has been engaged, in addi- 
tion to his regular work, in the s.udy of the fossil Tryonias, of Teredo, 
and of the Plwridce. 

Very notable advances have been made in the arrangement and 
cataloguing of the mollusca, as is shown by the fact that 10,530 cata- 
logue entries have been made, which represent the final classification 
of about 32,000 specimens. 

DEPARTMENT OF INSECTS. 

Progress has been made in the arrangement of the collections of in- 
sects. The curator, Prof. C. V. Riley, states in his report that the ar- 
rangement of the Lepidoptera from the Rhopalocera to the end of the 
Arctiidce has been completed ; the material embracing the order of Dip- 
tera has been separated into families. The collection of Arachnidce has 
been re-arranged. The work of labeling and separating the duplicate 
material in the suborder Heteroptera has been completed. 

Many importaut accessions have been received from the correspond- 
ents and agents of the entomological division of the Department of 
Agriculture, and conspicuous among them is the valuable collection 
made by Mr. Albert Koebele, in California, including several thousand 
specimens. Mr. E. A. Schwarz presented about 300 specimens of 
Coleoptera. In all, 102 accessions have been received during the year, 
representing, exclusive of the collection of the assistant curator, Mr. 
J. B. Smith (which has become the property of the Museum), at least 
10,000 specimens. The exhibition series now includes 7,S78 specimens 
(2,037 species), besides a large number of drawings. There have been 
made 101 entries in the catalogue of the department during the year. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 21 

Work has been continued by the curator and bis assistant in the 
study of the Nociuidce* and the latter has investigated the Museum 
material in the lepidopterous family Satumiidw, and also the genus 
CallimorphaA 

DEPARTMENT OF MARINE INVERTEBRATES. 

Mr. Eichard Eathbun, the curator of this department, reports that 
advances have been made in the permanent arrangement of the general 
reserve collection daring the year, and that much material has been 
prepared for the display series. He has also during the year begun 
the preparation of a card catalogue of the identified material. Tbis 
affords an excellent means of reference, and renders it possible to 
determine at a glance the presence or absence of a given species in 
the collection. During the summer of 1886 the curator completed, 
for the Fish Commission, a report upon the surface water temper- 
atures of the Atlantic coast of the United States. The deep-water 
and littoral Madreporaria and Ilydracoralhe, obtained by the U. S. 
Fish Commission steamer Albatross during 1884, 1885, and 1886, have 
been examined and identified. The determination of nearly all of the 
corals of the genera Madrepora, Porites, and Synareceahas been completed, 
and reports based thereupon have been prepared for publication in the 
Proceedings of the Museum. Mr. Eathbun is now engaged upon a 
revision of the star-fishes belonging to Asterias and the allied genera; 
and a description of the species Heliaster, with photographic plates of 
all the known forms, has been completed. 

The accessions of the year number fifty-five, the largest and most 
important consisting of the material brought in by the Fish Commis- 
sion steamer A Ibatross during the summer and fall of 1886, and the col- 
lection of 484 specimens of sponges and 266 specimens of corals, made 
by Dr. Gr. Brown Goode in Bermuda, in 1877, for the Wesleyan Uni- 
versity at Middletown, Connecticut, and now sent to the National 
Museum in exchange. 

There have been made 5,252 entries in the catalogue of this depart- 
ment, of which 996 represent Crustacea, 2,611 Worms, 130 Bryozoa and 
Ascidians, 1,412 Echinoderms and Ccelenterates, and JOS Sponges and 
Protozoans. 

Thirty-one sets of duplicate series of marine invertebrates from the 
collections of the U. S. Fish Commission were sent to colleges and 
schools in various parts of the United States, and special sets were 
prepared for the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College 
and for the American Museum of Natural History in New York. 

DEPARTMENT OP COMPARATIVE ANATOMY. 

The collections in this department are under the care of Mr. F. W. 
True, assisted by Mr. F. A. Lucas, and are increasing very rapidly. 
The catalogue shows 468 entries of birds, 330 of mammals, 10 of reptiles

22 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

and batrachians, and 4 of fishes. The mammalian series is at present 
much the largest, and that of alcoholic birds, important for anatomical 
purposes, contains many forms. 

Reference to the statement of work accomplished by the osteological 
preparator* will show tbe number of specimens which have been pre- 
pared or mounted. The Zoological Society of Philadelphia and the 
Central Park Menagerie in New York have generously continued to 
send specimens of animals which have died in captivity. 

Among the principal accessions may be mentioned a gorilla, Gorilla 
savagei, obtained from the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris, a fine 
example of Caribbean seal, Monachus trojyicalis, and a small whale, 
Kogia brevicepsj which was secured through the co-operation of Capt. 
B. T. Barco, of the life-saving station at Dam Keck Mills, in Virginia. 
Numerous skeletons and skulls of the American buffalo, Bison ameri- 
caniiSj and of other mammals and of birds, were added to the collection 
as a result of the successful expedition sent out by the Institution to 
Montana under the charge of Mr. William T. Hornaday. 

Tbe exhibition series now includes nearly 500 specimens. 

DEPARTMENT OF INVERTEBRATE FOSSILS (PALEOZOIC). 

The work of this department, under the curatorship of Mr. C. D. 
Walcott, of the U. S. Geological Survey, has made marked progress. 
Thirty-six accessions, aggregating 4,009 specimens, have been received 
and, for the most part, identified. Many of these accessions consisted of 
materials gathered by officers of the U. S. Geological Surrey duringtbe 
summer of 1886, and duly transferred to the custody of the Museum by 
Major Powell, the Director of the Survey. Dr. R. R. Gurley has been 
designated to act as assistant, and the curator reports rapid progress 
in the classification and arrangement of the material. He further states 
that a very good representative collection for exhibition will be ready 
as soon as exhibition cases can be supplied. Mr. ¥7alcott has continued 
his studies upon the Cambrian faunas of North America, and during 
the year has published in the American Journal of Science a memoir 
relating to the classification of this system. 

DEPARTMENT OF INVERTEBRATE FOSSILS (MESOZOIC). 

Dr. C. A. White, of the U. S. Geological Survey, continues his work 
upon the collection of mesozoic fossils. He states that during tbe year 
he has been enabled to complete the card catalogue of all the Museum 
materials in his custody. The entire collection is now ready for exhi- 
bition, and it is unfortunate that no space is at present available for 
this important and carefully identified material. The accessions during 
the year numbered twelve, and 1,033 entries were made in the cata- 
logue.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 23 

DIVISION OF BOTANY. 

FOSSIL AND RECENT PLANTS. 

The collections of fossil and recent plants continue under the care of 
Mr. Lester F. Ward, of the U. S. Geological Survey, assisted by Mr. F. 
H. Knowlton. Much of the material in the collection of fossil plants is 
in the hands of Prof. Leo Lesquereux, of Columbus, Ohio, for determina- 
tion, but nothing has recently been published by him. Mr. Knowlton has 
been carrying on an investigation of the microscopical structure of the 
wood and lignite of the Potomac formation. The results of his work 
are to be published in one of the bulletins of the U. S. Geological Sur- 
vey. 

The collection of fossil plants now contains 8,462 specimens. 

The collection of recent plants has been greatly enriched during the 
year, notably by the addition of the material collected by Dr. Edward 
Palmer in southwestern Mexico. This includes about eight hundred 
species, of which one fifth are new to science. Mr. Pringle made A T alu- 
able contributions to the fauna from Mexico, and from Mr. S. Applegate 
was received a small collection of Alaskan plants. Much interesting 
material which was exhibited at the New Orleans Exposition, has been 
added through the courtesy of the Government of Costa Eica. 

The herbarium of the late Mr. O. E. Pearce has been received during 
the year. This includes over 600 finely mounted species, together with 
a large number of duplicates. Other collections of interest and value 
were received from Dr. J. C. McCormick, Mr. J. W. Johnson, and Prof. 
Alfred Duges. 

Active work in this department has been mainly confined to the de- 
termination of the material received. It is estimated that there are 
32,000 specimens in the collection. Thirty entries have been made in 
the catalogue during the year. 

DIVISION OF GEOLOGY. 

DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS. 

The honorary curator, Prof. F. W. Clarke, chief chemist of the IT. S. 
Geological Survey, reports satisfactory growth in the collections under 
his charge. 

The mineral collection received some remarkable specimens of quartz, 
stibnite, and amber from the Educational Museum at Tohio, Japan. A 
collection of 74 specimens of Swedish minerals collected by L. J. Igel- 
strom was purchased. 

Among the important accessions to the series of gems were those 
from Mr. C. S. Bernent, of Philadelphia, Mr. Thomas Wilson, of Wash- 
ington, and Mrs. Spencer F. Baird. From the Treasury Department 
was received a collection of 133 small diamonds and 150 pearls, which 
were presented in 1840 to President Van Buren by the Imaum of Muscat. 

The collection of meteorites now numbers about 301 " falls," of which 
141 have been obtained during the year. 



24 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

The celebrated collection of Prof. C. U. Shepard, jr., numbering 101 
specimens, has been deposited during the year. 

Eesearches have been made by Professor Clarke, and under his direc- 
tion, upon the micas, the natural borates, and the tourmalines belonging 
to the Museum collection. 

There are now 3,238 specimens on exhibition, 5,404 in the study series, 
and 8,530 duplicates, which, together with the Willcox collection of min- 
erals and the Shepard collection of meteorites, make a total of 18,001 
specimens in the care of this department. 

DEPARTMENT OP LITHOLOGY AND PHYSICAL GEOLOGY. 

Mr. George P. Merrill, curator, has devoted the greater part of his 
time to the arrangement of the exhibition and reserve series, both of 
which have been greatly extended during the year. Of the reserve se- 
ries 5,687 specimens are on exhibition, 2,720 of which are examples of 
building stones, while 1,893 belong to the educational series of rocks 
and rock-forming minerals. Mr. Merrill has had permission to do a por- 
tion of his work in the petrographical laboratory of the Johns Hopkins 
University in Baltimore, and has there examined several hundred mi- 
croscopical slides of the sections of rocks, and has thus been enabled 
to arrange a large mass of hitherto unclassified material which had been 
accumulating for several years. Mr. Merrill has, at his own cost, made 
expeditions to California and Montana, and has gathered much desir- 
able material, described in the accession list accompanying this report 
(Section v). In bis report he makes mention of 13 accessions received 
during the year, which are of special value. The total number of speci- 
mens in his department is estimated at 21,500. 

DEPARTMENT OF METALLURGY AND ECONOMIC GEOLOGY. 

The time of the curator, Mr. Fred. P. Dewey, has been in part devoted 
to the preparation of a preliminary descriptive catalogue of the collec- 
tions. 

The accessions of the year have consisted chiefly of material sent for 
examination and report, and 186 specimens have been examined. Six 
hundred and seventy-one entries have been made in the catalogue. 
There are now about 49,000 specimens in the collection, of which 18,000 
are on exhibition. 

E.— REVIEW OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE WORK. 

PROGRESS OF GENERAL AND INCIDENTAL WORK. 
Transportation and Storage. 
Of the total number of boxes, packages, barrels, tanks, etc., received 
during the year, which was 38,367, no less than 3,798 contained material 
for the Museum. 

The registrar, Mr. S. C. Brown, continues to act as transportation 
clerk for the Smithsonian Institution. 

During the year 436 boxes and packages have been entered on the 
storage records. The temporary storing of material, it may be noted, 



EEPOET OF ASSISTANT SECEETAEY. 25 

is of very great convenience to the curators, who, upon the arrival of 
bulky accessions, may not be prepared to receive them immediately 
into their laboratories. 

Library. 

Mr. John Murdoch* has furnished the following statement concern- 
ing the operations of the library. 

The work of the library has been carried on according to essentially 
the same methods as during the preceding years. 

The total number of publications (exclusive of regular periodicals) 
added to the library during the year was 1,511 — 391 volumes of more 
than 100 pages, and 1,120 pamphlets. Of these, 237 volumes and 711 
pamphlets were retained for the use of the Museum from the accessions 
of the Smithsonian Institution. The remainder were obtained as usual 
by gift, and less frequently by purchase. As in previous years, the 
chief donor to the library was Prof. S. F. Baird, to whom the library is 
indebted for 17 volumes and 109 pamphlets. Next in importance as 
contributors are Mr. Eobert Eidgway, 49 pamphlets ; Mr. W. H. Dall, 
46 pamphlets ; the Smithsonian Institution, 14 volumes, 18 pamphlets 5 
Prof. J. O. Westwood, of Oxford, England, 27 pamphlets (a complete set 
of his shorter archaeological writings) ; and the United States Fish 
Commission, 3 volumes and 19 pamphlets. 

During the year 4,350 books were borrowed from the library, and 
4,396 returned. 

The card catalogue by authors has been continued, and 1,647 titles 
have been added to it during the year. A catalogue by subjects is a 
great desideratum, but it is impossible to begin it with the force now at 
command. 

The condition of the sectional libraries remains practically unchanged 
since the last report. 

The covering of pamphlets with the binders, described in the last 
report, has been continued, and 2,111 have been covered during the 
year. On June 24 we received a supply of Eandolph pamphlet-boxes 
of the standard quarto and octavo sizes. It is intended to keep the 
covered pamphlets in these, grouping together, for instance, all the 
pamphlets by the same author in one of these boxes, which then forms 
practically a book, and can be put in its proper place on the shelf. 

On the establishment of the Smithsonian reading-room, soon after 
April 1, the current volumes of nearly all the important periodicals 
not belonging to the sectional libraries, were transferred to it. This 
affords a long-desired opportunity for the display of the recent numbers 
of these publications, and as the periodicals in the reading-room are 
not allowed to circulate until the volume is complete, all readers have 
an opportunity of consulting them. 

"No changes were made in the force employed in the library until 
April 1. At this date, in consequence of the reorganization of the 

* Appointed Librarian of the Smithsonian Institution April 1, 1887. 



26 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

Smithsonian library, Mr. F. W. True resigned the position of librarian, 
and the assistant librarian, Mr. Murdoch, became librarian of the 
Smithsonian Institution, in charge also of the Museum library, with Mr. 
N. P. Scudder as assistant librarian. 

The chief need of the library is more room for the storage of the 
files of periodicals. The room now available is scarcely sufficient to 
provide for the regular growth of the series now kept, and want of 
room is a serious hindrance to the acquisition of the files of important 
periodicals. 

Distribution of Duplicates, and Exchanges. 

The policy of the Smithsonian Institution in reference to the distri- 
bution of its duplicate material has frequently been emphasized in its 
annual reports. It has always been the desire of the Institution to 
utilize this material by sending it to colleges, museums, and individ- 
uals, either as a gift or in exchange, and thus to extend as widely as 
possible the means of diffusing a knowledge of the natural history of 
this country. In the Smithsonian report for 1859* Professor Henry 
wrote : "The object of the Institution in obtaining so large a number 
of duplicates is that they may be distributed for the advancement of 
knowledge to persons who may be engaged in original investigations in 
natural history, and also to colleges for the purpose of education." In 
the same place hesays : "Although the primary object of the Institution 
is not educational, yet the Museum is arranged with special reference 
to the study of the elements of different branches of science ; and the 
distribution of the extra specimens will furnish the means of diffusing 
a knowledge of natural history more generally throughout the country." 

During the last few years each department in the Museum has been 
under the care of a specialist, but in former years, when the Secretary 
of the Institution acted as the sole keeper of the Museum, the collec- 
tions, as soon as they were received, were sent away to various specialists, 
who undertook to identify the specimens, which were duly returned, 
labeled, to the Institution. 

Thus in the early days of the Museum the value of the collections 
depended in large part upon the willingness of specialists to co-operate, 
and to them distributions of material were of course most readily made. 
Professor Henry, in the annual report for 1861 f states that up to that 
time 80,000 specimens had thus been distributed. He adds : " When it 
is considered that all these have been named and labeled by naturalists 
admitted to be of the highest authority in their respective departments, 
and that all have thereby the character and value of types, it will be 
readily understood how much their systematic and judicious distribu- 
tion by the Institution all over the world must conduce to the advance- 
ment of science." 

As aresult, however, of the more thorough organization of the Museum 
at the present time, the determination of material is for the most part

performed within the walls of tbe Museum, and therefore extraneous 
co operation is no longer so necessary a feature of the work of the 
establishment. 

The applications for specimens this year numbered 83, most of which 
were filled, besides 46 which remained on file from previous years. 
The distributions for this year consist for the most part of material 
sent as gift to needy colleges and museums, or in exchange for material 
received. These amounted to 327 packages, among which were included 
3,460 specimens of marine invertebrates (32 sets), 1,573 rocks, 1,462 
birds, 1,168 minerals, 1,029 mollusks, '555 paleozoic fossils, 543 ethno- 
logical objects, 165 ores, 148 birds' eggs, 133 mammals, 106 reptiles, 94 
fishing implements, and 84 fishes. Forty-nine boxes and one package, 
containing materia medica specimens, animal products, pottery, and 
fossil plants, were also included in the distribution. In addition to this, 
13 sets of plans and drawings of Museum cases and bottles, 95 pho- 
tographs of Museum specimens, and 9 musical instruments were also 
given or lent. 

Among the most important distributions of the year have been those 
of the buffalo heads, skins, and skeletons which formed a part of the 
result of the Smithsonian exploration into Montana, and which were 
presented to corporations and individuals who had materially assisted 
in bringing the expedition to success. A large number of axolotls, for 
the most part presented to the Museum by Dr. E. W. Shufeldt, TJ. S. 
Army, were given away to various applicants for purposes of study. 

Foreign Exchanges. 

A .collection of 112 specimens (105 species) of birds and 24 mammal 
skins was sent to the museum of the municipal library in Kurrachee, 
India, in exchange for collections of drugs, reptiles, and mammals re- 
ceived. A skull and 11 bones of Rliytina together with additional 
skeletons of mammals and birds and some insects, were sent to M. 
Beauregard, of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, in exchange 
for 18 mammal skeletons and a small series of insects received. Four- 
teen pieces of Chiriqui pottery were sent to M. Lauth, director of the 
establishment of Sevres, France, in exchange for material received; 
and a bust of Osceola and a Sioux headdress were transmitted to the 
•minister of public instruction for the Trocadero Museum in Paris, in 
part exchange for a valuable collection of Sevres porcelain received 
from the French Government. The negotiations which for some time 
have been pending with the Annecy MusCe, Haute-Savoie, have been 
completed during this year by the transmission of a collection of eth- 
nological objects and a series of fossils in exchange for a collection of 
minerals, rocks, etc., received last year. A buffalo-skin was sent to 
Dr. Tor Helliesen, curator of the zoological department of the Stavan- 
ger Museum in Norway. A sea-lion skin was sent to the Bergen Mu- 
seum in Norway. A small and varied collection of fossils, moa bones, 



28 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 188?. 

etc., was received from Mr. S. H. Drew, of Wanganui, New Zealand, 
and in exchange an equivalent in ethnological material has been sent. 
A series of the bones of Bhytina was sent to Mr. J. W. Clark, of the 
Museum of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at Cambridge, Eng- 
land, in part exchange for some valuable skeletons received at the close 
of the London Fisheries Exhibition in 1883. An exchange of mammal 
skins has been made with Prof. Tycho Tullberg, of Upsala, Sweden. 

In addition to these exchanges correspondence has been carried on 
with several museums with a view to arranging exchanges. Prof. S. 
Hertzen stein, of the Imperial Zoological Museum in St. Petersburg, 
Eussia, has offered to send fishes and shells in exchange for American 
fishes. Dr. A. Strauch, director of that museum, has been invited to 
exchange Enssian and Central Asiatic mammals for mammals from 
North, Central, and South America. An exchange of fishes is being 
arranged with Prof. T. Jeffery Parker, of the Otago University Museum, 
at Dunedin, New Zealand. Dr. Serrurier, director of the National Ethno- 
logical Museum of the Netherlands, in Leyden, has offered African eth- 
nological material in exchange. 

The arrival of specimens of tin-bearing material, together with 
systematic series representing the mode of occurrence and extraction, 
and of mammals, from L. Wray, esq., curator of the Perak Museum in 
the Straits Settlements, in exchange for mineralogical specimens, is 
awaited with much interest. Professor Bernardin, of the Commercial 
and Industrial Museum in the College of Melle, near Ghent, has been 
asked to send samples of commercial products. D. Morris, esq., as- 
sistant director of the Eoyal Gardens at Kew, in England, has made 
application for specimens of American woods. These will be put aside 
for that establishment as opportunity offers. Dr. Ernest Bayet, of 
Brussels, has requested an exchange of fossils, desiring quaternary 
and pliocene material. In behalf of the department of Mollusks this 
Museum has written to the director of the Cape Town Museum for a 
series of land, fresh-water, and marine shells of that region, offering 
in exchange any desired material. For the same department applica- 
tion for a series of Storms shells has been made to the director of the 
Brussels Museum. A letter has been addressed to Hon. St. John Lar- 
nack, minister of marine Wellington, New Zealand, asking for speci- 
mens in any department of zoology, an offer having been voluntarily 
made to send us any desiderata which could be supplied, in return for 
whitefish ova transmitted by the IT. S. Fish Commission. M. Milne- 
Edwards, of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, has offered du- 
plicate material from the dredgings of the Travailleur. 

Publications. 

The report on the operations of the Museum for 1884 was issued in 
October, 1880, as Smithsonian Report, Part n, and was the first bound 
volume published as a report on the Museum. This book consists of

Mr. A. Howard Clark has been appointed editor of Proceedings and 
Bulletins. This work has for many years been well performed by Dr. 
T. H. Bean, in addition to his regular duties as curator of fishes. 

The eighth volume of the Proceedings of the U. S. National Museum, 
for the year 1885, appeared in October. It contains 78 contributions in 
40 signatures by 36 authors, 14 of whom are officers of the Museum. 
Twenty- five of the papers related to fishes, 22 to birds, 12 to marine in- 
vertebrates, 6 to mammals, 3 to rocks and minerals, 3 to physiological 
subjects, 2 to botany, and 1 each to ethnology, entomology, paleontology, 
metallurgy, and materia medica. The report is illustrated by 25 plates 
and 15 cuts. The Appendix contains circulars 32 and 33 of the National 
Museum, the former being "A classification of the materia medica col- 
lection of the U. S. National Museum" previously published by Dr. 
James M. Flint, U. S. Navy, and extended by Dr. Henry G. Beyer, IT. 
S. Navy, and the latter entitled "Notes on the Preparation of liough 
Skeletons, by Frederic A. Lucas." 

The ninth volume of the Proceedings of the U. S. National Museum, 
18S6, has been issued only in signatures, of which a list is published in 
Section iv of this report. The bound volume will soon be ready for 
distribution. 

Of the tenth volume of Proceedings of the U. S. National Museum, 
for the year 1887, only six signatures (the sixth dated May 17) had 
appeared up to the close of the fiscal year now being reported upon. 

Bulletin 31, Synopsis of the North American Syrphidje, by 
Samuel W. Williston, M. D., Ph. D., was issued in May, 1887, and con- 
tains xxx+335 pages. It is illustrated by 12 plates. The subject is 
discussed in three parts, of which the first is devoted to classification, 
the second to descriptions, and the third to habits, structural characters, 
geographical and geological distribution, and chronological list of gen- 
era.

Students, Lectures, and Meetings oe Societies. 

As in past years, the Museum has offered facilities to several students, 
who have in some instances rendered a partial equivalent by volunteer 
work upon the collections. 

Mr. Walter H. Brown spent six weeks with the Department of Com- 
parative Anatomy for the purpose of studying the methods of preparing 
and mounting osteological specimens. 

In the Department of Insects volunteer service was rendered by Mr 
S. Davis, of Washington, and Mr. W. H. Crane, of Cincinnati, whose 
assistance was utilized chiefly in the arrangement of the Diptera and in 
the synoptic collection of Coleoptera. Prof. P. E. Uhler, of Baltimore, 
having offered to arrange and name the insects of the family Capsidce, 
the material was sent to him for that purpose. 

Paul Pelseneer, of the museum at Brussels, applied for certain species 
of pteropod mollusks for study. Certain Pacific specimens and copies 
of colored drawings, made from life by Mr. Dall while in the North 
Pacific, were lent to him. 

Mr. Delano Ames, of Washington, served as a volunteer in the depart- 
ment of Marine Invertebrates during the months of May and Jane. 
Prof. A. E. Verrill, of Yale College, assisted by Misses A. J. and C. 
E. Bush, and Mr. Sanderson Smith, Prof. J. Walter Fewkes, of the 
Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Massachusetts ; Prof. S. 
I. Smith, of Yale College, Prof. L. A. Lee, of Bowdoin College, Prof. 
E. Linton, of Washington and Jefferson College, Pennsylvania, and 
others have rendered valuable aid to this department by researches in 
special directions. 

In the department ol Minerals volunteer service was rendered from 
July to November, 1886, by Mr. H. H. James. 

An examination of the entire collection of deer antlers, in connection 
with the question of bilateral asymmetry in the class Mammals, was 
made by Dr, Harrison Allen, 



32 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

In the department of Ethnology Paymaster E. B. Webster, U. S. 
STavy, rendered valuable service. 

Among the investigators who have utilized the ichthyological collec- 
tions of the Museum in the preparation of papers, etc., were President 
David S. Jordan, of Indiana University, and his assistants, and Prof. 
John A. Ryder, of the University of Pennsylvania. 

The gallery of the department of Birds was thrown open to the mem- 
bers of the American Ornithologists' Union, who held their annual meet- 
ing from November 16 to 18, and daily use was made of the library and 
collections by these gentlemen in connection with the objects of the 
meeting and their researches as ornithologists. 

Mr. Anastasio Alfaro was sent to Washington by the Government 
of Gosta Eica in October, 1886, to study the methods of the National 
Museum. This gentleman was shown every courtesy, especially by the 
department of Birds, in which he was particularly interested, and 
every possible facility was afforded him for familiarizing himself with 
the methods pursued by the Institution. 

In the photographic laboratory instructions were given by Mr. T. W. 
Smillie to Lieutenants Schaefer, Eogers, Bolles, and Werlich, of the U. 
S. Navy ; Messrs. Merrill and Hornaday, of the Museum; Mr. Thomas 
Lee, U. S. Fish Commission; the photographer of the U. S. Goast 
Survey, and to Dr. May King, a young Chinese lady who is preparing 
herself for a career as a medical missionary and scientific student in 
her native land. 

Instructions in taxidermy were given by Mr. W. T. Hornaday to 
Prof. L. L. Dyche, of the University of Kansas, who served as an un- 
salaried volunteer in the department for the sake of the experience 
acquired. 

Mr. L. M. McCormick asked for and obtained access to the collection 
of fishes and ichthyological literature, to aid him iu the identification 
Df a collection of fishes belonging to Oberlin College. 

The use of the lecture hall has as usual been granted for a series 
of lectures delivered on Saturday afternoons, and in some cases on 
Wednesday evenings, under the joint auspices of the Biological and 
A-uthropological Societies of Washington. These were largely at- 
tended. Some of the lectures had direct reference to the work of the 
Museum, and were illustrated by specimens. 

The programmes of the two parts of this course are here given :

15 to 17, inclusive. 

CURRENT ADMINISTRATIVE WORK. 
Furniture, Supplies, and Accounts. 

The following statement in regard to the cases and other furniture, 
supplies, and accounts of the Museum, covering the fiscal year 1886-'87, 
has been prepared by Mr. W. V. Cox, chief clerk. 

The U. S. National Museum is supported by three appropriations an- 
nually voted by Congress ; one being for preservation and increase of 
collections, one for furniture and fixtures, and one for heating, lighting, 
electrical, and telephonic service. 

The principal appropriation made for the Museum is the one for the 
Preservation of Collections. The wording of the act of Congress mak- 
ing this appropriation for the year ending June 30, 1887, is as follows: 

Preservation of Collections op the National Museum : For the preserva- 
tion, exhibition, and increase of the collections received from the surveying and ex- 
ploring expeditions of the Government, and from other sources, including salaries or 
compensation of all necessary employe's, one hundred and six thousand five hundred 
dollars. 

Out of this appropriation, therefore, are paid the salaries of curators, 
scientific assistants, clerks, and other employes, the nature of whose 
work is properly chargeable to it. This service amounted during the 
year to $95,133.70. 

The greatest number of employes on the roll in any one month 
was 126, in January, 1887 ; the smallest number was 106, in April of 
the same year. 

The highest salary paid was $300 per month ; the lowest was $20,

necessary employes, $17,289.75, leaving an unexpended balance of 
$74.97. 

The average monthly roll on furniture and fixtures was $1,440.81. 
The greatest number of employes in any month was 27, the smallest 
20; the average number being 25. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 35 

The highest salary was $110, the lowest $30. The wages of car- 
penters, painters, and laborers were the same as paid for work of like 
nature in other departments of the Government, the average per indi- 
vidual on this rcll being $57.63. 

The mechanics have been kept busy with the varied work of the Mu- 
seum. When necessary to have cases of new design or of peculiar 
form made, it has often been found economy of both time and means, 
sometimes even with working drawings, to have a sample prepared in 
the Museum shop before finally awarding the contract. Our men have 
remodeled numerous old cases, and have built many new ones, as shown 
by the accompanying list. 

The following cases, screens, etc., were made in the Museum shop 
between June 30, 1886, and July 1, 1887 : 

10 mahogany alcove cases. 

4 mahogany pillar cases. 

4 glass screen, sloping cases. 

1 glass case, special form. 

1 ebonized case, special form. 

4 unit cases. 

4 white-pine standard book-cases. 
13 walnut bases. 

7 pine bases. 
1 water-tight base. 

1 sample wall bracket. 

2 diaphragms. 

8 oak settees. 

The appropriation for heating, lighting, and electrical and telephonic 
service was $11,000. 

Out of this sum there was expended for fuel, $2,923.87; for heating, 
supplies, and repairs, $852.58 ; for gas, $811.78 ; rental of telephones, 
$766.69; electric works and supplies, $748.42; rental of call-boxes, 
-$120; salary of telephone clerk and telegraph operator, $1,080; wages 
of engineer and firemen, $3,678.12 ; leaving an unexpended balance of 
$18.54. 

The methods described at length in report of 18S5-'S6 for purchasing 
supplies for the Museum have been followed, and have generally proved 
satisfactory. It is thought that by means of a few slight changes, which 
experience has suggested, still greater perfection in business methods 
may be attained. 

Little has been accomplished towards the completion of the back 
records mentioned in the report of last year, for the entire time of the 
limited number of employes of the department of Property and Sup- 
plies has been taken up with necessary current work. 

Correspondence and Reports. 

The scope of the work of this department, under the charge of Mr. 
E. I. Geare, executive clerk, has been greatly enlarged during the year, 
owing to the fact that all letters bearing upon the work of the Museum 



2 stationary screens with sliding doors. 

2 large stationary screens.

KEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 



are now referred from the Smithsonian Institution to the Assistant Sec- 
retary for final action. In previous years a considerable part of the 
Museum correspondence had been attended to by officers of the Smith- 
sonian Institution. 

The Museum correspondence may be grouped under the following- 
headings : 

(1) General Museum business, including matters connected with 
Museum administration, arrangement of foreign exchanges, etc. 

(2) .Replies to requests for information of a technical character. 

(3) Acknowledgment of gifts, loans, and exchanges. 

(4) Eeports upon specimens sent for examination and report. 
During the year, 1,406 letters were written relating to the general 

business of the Museum. The reports upon specimens sent for identi- 
fication numbered 540, and 1,152 acknowledgments of accessions were 
made, a large number both of reports and of acknowledgments being 
in letter form. This gives a total of 3,098 official papers prepared for 
the signature of the Assistant Secretary in charge. 

Reports upon specimens sent for examination. — The special researches 
which have been carried on by the curators during the year have been 
referred to at some length in the discussion of the work accomplished 
in the scientific departments. In addition to this a large quantity of 
laboratory work is necessitated by the receipt of specimens of all kinds 
which are sent to the Museum for examination and report. The ex- 
amination of this material, of which a classified list is given below, oc- 
cupies very much of the curators' time, elaborate reports beiug in many 
cases necessary. In each instance a copy of the report, or a letter em- 
bodying it, is mailed to the sender. The following table gives the num- 
ber of requests of this kind received, and arranged by states, the state 
given being that in which the sender resides and not necessarily that 
from which the specimen originally came, this fact in many cases not 
being stated by the sender.

Buildings and Labor; Police and Public Comfort. 

The staff employed for police and inspection under the charge of 
Henry Horan, superintendent of buildings, consisted of 20 watchmen 
and doorkeepers; for construction, care of buildings, and repairs, 8 
carpenters, 2 painters; for labor and cleaning, 19 laborers, 6 cleaners, 
2 attendants; for heating and lighting, 1 engineer and 4 firemen. 

From the reports of the superintendent are quoted in brief the fol- 
lowing statements, which will serve to show in part the character of 
the work accomplished by the laboring force during the year: 

In July a large amount of mechanical work was done ; eight large settees were 
•completed and placed in the rotunda, of the Museum building, and diaphragms made 
for the installation of photographs of fishery appliances, etc. The walls at the 
north entrance were wainscoted, and screens were placed at the west entrance. 
A sloping case was made for the department of Fishes for exhibiting relief maps. 
Sky-lights were placed in the east balcony. Tin trays were placed under the floor 
ventilators to catch the dust that would otherwise drift through. A number of boxes 
were received from the New Orleans Exposition, and were turned over to the su- 
perintendent for unpacking. Two mahogany pillar cases were completed for the 
department of Ethnology. The electrical clocks in the buildings were all over- 
hauled and repaired. Screens were made for the different courts. 

In August four mahogany pillar cases were completed for the department of Eth- 
nology. Diaphragms were made for cases, and drawers fitted to them. A partition 
was put up on the north balcouy separating the textile and label departments. 
Excavations were made at the east front and walled up for ventilation of trenches. 
Work was begun on eight mahogany upright floor cases and on a partition wall on 
the second floor in northwest pavilion, cutting off the larger portion of the room as 
a private office for the Assistant Secretary. 

In September several large tubs were made for the reception of palm trees. A sky- 
light was placed in one of the rooms on the north balcony. The wall cases were re- 
paired. A large number of pedestals were made for the use of the taxidermist in 
mounting large animals. Book-cases were made for the Assistant Secretary's office. 
The large fur-seal case and pedestal of the kangaroo lizard were repaired. 



38 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

In October a book-case was made for the property clerk's office, and work was con- 
tinued in reconstructing the wall cases in the south hall of the Museum. Three ped- 
estals were made for petrified logs, aud others for use in the departments of Mammals 
and Comparative Anatomy. All the mahogany upright floor cases were completed. 
Screens were made to go over pier cases. The roof of the Museum building was 
painted. Slope cases for the building-stone department were made, and work was 
begun on a mahogany book-case for the chief clerk's office. 

In November a plank walk was laid along the west front of the Museum building. 
The walls in the northwest court and the ladies' reception-room were painted. A 
mahogany slope case was completed, and work began on mahogany upright floor 
cases. Work was begun on a small brick addition to the building at the east front. 

Iu December partitions were erected in the Annex building for the purpose of mak- 
ing a larger number of rooms. 

The collections of Paleozoic Fossils and the office of the curator of that department 
were removed to the first floor of the southwest pavilion, the curator of mammals 
removing his office to that vacated by Mr. Walcott. A large book-case in the office 
of the superintendent was remodeled. Cases for the department of Paleozoic Fossils 
were reconstructed and storage boxes made for the department of Fishes. The work 
on the walls of the ladies' room was completed and similar work begun on the gen- 
tlemen's lavatory. The taxidermist's outfits were moved from the Annex to the- 
Armory building. Packing boxes were made for the Materia Medica department, and 
a book-case was repaired for the department of Mineralogy. The last of the lot of 
mahogany upright floor cases were completed, and work was begun on a mahogany 
slope case for Gobelin tapestries and carpets. Shelves were arranged in the cases in 
the anthropological hall. 

During the last half of this fiscal year (January to June, inclusive, 1887) the follow- 
ing items relating to the most important work accomplished are given : Partitioning 
and fitting up room at Armory building ; shelving cases in anthropological hall ; re- 
pairing floors in pottery court ; construction of pedestals for large models of pueblos; 
making bases for seals ; construction of screen with sliding door at south entrance; 
making eight screens over wall cases; repairing eight cases for department of Metal- 
lurgy; shelving in wall cases for department of Building-Stones; construction of 
eight screens over pier case in east hall; three pedestals for Easter Island idols; 
fitting up cases and screens for the Grant relics. 

THE WORK OF THE MUSEUM PREPARATORS. 

The preparation of specimens for exhibition in the Museum or for 
the study series has been continued, and the character of the work of 
the preparators is indicated iu the following statements : 

Taxidermists. 

During the present year the work of the department of taxidermy 
has been unusually extensive. The lack of satisfactory and fairly 
representative specimens of the American bison in the exhibition series 
made it imperatively necessary to send the chief taxidermist into the 
field to collect material for a proper representation of this most con- 
spicuous and important quadruped of North America. During the 
months of October, November, and December, when the pelage was at 
its finest, an extremely rich and varied collection was made of fresh 
skins, skeletons, and skulls of animals of both sexes and all ages, from 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY.

the foetal young up to an enormous old bull which measured 5 feet 8 
inches in height at the shoulders.* 

Upon his return from the field Mr. Hornaday at once proceeded to 
mount a series of six of the finest skins to form a group, with natural 
surroundings. In view of the near extermination of the species the 
specimens are already of almost priceless value, and the group when 
finished will form a very important and attractive addition to the hall 
of mammals. The careful life studies made by the chief taxidermist 
in the field enabled him to produce specimens of unrivaled excellence. 

Notwithstanding this very serious interruption to work in the labora- 
tory by work in the field, and still further by a removal of the laboratory 
from the Annex building to the Armory, and the care of the Montana 
collection when it arrived, the amount of work accomplished in the 
laboratory has been very considerable. During the year thirty-one 
mammals were mounted and placed on exhibition, among which, after 
the group of buffaloes, the most commanding figure is that of a superb 
Bengal tigress. A very fine barren-ground caribou, an immense prong- 
horn antelope buck, and a family of coyotes are also noteworthy addi- 
tions of the year, while the collection of marsupials is still further en- 
riched by the addition of eleven more species. 

During the months of April, May, and June, Mr. Joseph Palmer ren- 
dered the chief taxidermist very efficient and valuable assistance in 
the work of mounting some of the buffaloes, the caribou, antelope, and 
other mammals. Mr. A. H. Forney has continued to render satisfac- 
tory service as assistant taxidermist during the year, and remained at 
the Museum in charge of the laboratory during the absence of the chief 
taxidermist in Montana.

about three hundred specimens for the exhibition series, and removed 
from old stands to new ones about five hundred specimens. 

OSTEOLOGICAL PREPARATOR. 

The following table shows the number of osteological specimens pre- 
pared or mounted during the year, as well as the number of animals 
received in the flesh whose rough preparation § involved an outlay of 
considerable time and labor : 

* This summary does not include any of the specimens collected during the spring 
operations in the field, which have been reported upon with the work of the previous 
year. See Smithsonian Report 1886, Part n. The spring collection, however, 
should be credited in summing up the total results of the expedition.

These tables give a total of 256 specimens on which work was done 
during the year, and show that, while the entire number is much less 
than that of the year previous, the number of large pieces handled is 
very much greater. The necessary work of preparation has indeed inter- 
fered seriously with other work, and has increased to such an extent as 
to render it impossible with the present force to bestow upon it all the 
attention which could be desired. 

The reflooring of the pedestals of the casts of Megatherium and Ra- 
drosaurus has necessitated repairs, and in addtion the series of Dino- 
eeras casts, numbering some twenty pieces, has been mounted and 
placed on exhibition. A number of skeletons have been transferred to 
new pedestals, leaving but little to be done in that direction. 

The mounting of the skeleton of the Asiatic elephant "Albert" has 
been the most difficult and protracted work of the year. The skele- 
ton forms a very important addition to the exhibition series. The label- 
ing of the osteological collection, which has been done by Mr. Lucas, 
is in all respects satisfactory. 

The transferring of the work-rooms to the Armory building caused a 
temporary interruption of work during the month of January. 

Mr. Walter H. Brown, of the University of Kansas, spent six weeks 
in this department as a volunteer assistant, for the purpose of study- 
ing the methods of preparing and mounting osteological specimens. 



Modelers. 

A portion of the time of Mr. Joseph Palmer has been devoted to 
making casts of fishes and reptiles received from time to time by the 
Museum, and to repairing casts already on exhibition, which have from 
handling at various expositions and from other reasons become dam- 
aged. Mr. Palmer has rendered much assistance to Mr. Hornaday in 
connection with the mounting of mammals. 

Mr. J. W. Hendley has made casts of Eskimo heads, meteoric stones, 
various objects for the food collection, stone implements, etc. He also 
made a model of an Indian woman and several models of Eskimos, for 
use in the display of costumes.

Miscellaneous 324 

Total 506 



In addition, 117 transparencies have been made, 110 being for use in 
connection with lectures given in the Museum. Seventy-two geological 
negatives have been stripped and developed. Three thousand seven 
hundred and six prints (silver) have been made, as follows :

Metallurgical 94 



Mammals 48 

Miscellaneous 3,268 

Total .3,706 



In addition, 506 cyauotypes of case drawings and 45 enlargements 
have been made. One hundred and fifteen miscellaneous photographs 
have been mounted. In connection with experimental work for the In- 
stitution upon solar and lunar spectrum, 5 negatives and 10 prints were 
made. 

The following persons have been instructed in the methods of pho- 
tography: Dr. May King (Kiu Yia Me), Mr. O. H. Townsend, Mr. G. P. 
Merrill, and W. T. Hornaday, of the Museum; Lieutenants Schaefer, 
Eogers, Bolles, and Werlich, of the IT. S. Navy ; Mr. Thomas Lee, d. 
S. Fish Commission, and the photographer of the IT. S. Coast Survey. 
Every facility has been afforded them for acquiring sufficient knowledge 
of photography to be of practical use to them in the field. (See p. 32 
antea.) 

The usual routine work of numbering and filing negatives has been 
continued. Several photographic outfits for collectors have been pre- 
pared. 

By order of the Secretary, a test of seven canceling inks and samples 
of paper for postal notes was made at the request of the Post- Office 
Department, and the contracts for the ensuing year were based upon 
the results of the test. 

The large stereopticon has been transferred to the care of this de- 
partment, and was very successfully employed during the last season 

of Fa,turday lectures. 

Colorist. 

Mr. A. Zeno Shindler has, in addition to his regular work of coloring 
casts of fishes, reptiles, etc., for exhibition in the Museum, painted a 
large collection of similar objects for the American Museum of Natural 
History, New York, and has made a number of sketches in water color, 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 



43 



among which are views of the Carp pond, a Pima Indian woman engaged 
in weaving, a Madagascar woman, and a sketch of a Mexican Indian. He 
also colored photographs of eleven Winnebago, thirty Apache, and 
twelve Sac and Fox Indians, and also a photograph of an Indian 
priestess. 

Twelve life-size casts of Ute Indians were painted, and a pen-and-ink 
copy made of a painting of Japanese fishery. Six large casts of grind- 
ing stones were painted in oil, and a cast of an ancient plate painted in 
gold. He also made a chart of the spectrum, and sketches illustrating 
the mechanism of the voice for the lecture room. 

Preparator in the Department op Arts and Industries. 

Mr. E. H. Hawley has devoted the greater portion of his time to the 
preparation of material for exhibition. Among the more important 
collections which he has installed during the year were the " Grant

The first entry in the accession book bears the date of January 1, 
1859, although considerable material had been received before that time. 
From these figures it will therefore be seen that the accessions of the 
past six years and a half nearly equal the total number received during 
the previous 22 years. An " accession " may include hundreds of 
specimens. 



44 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

Mr. S. 0. Brown, registrar, has completed an alphabetical index of all 
accessions to the Museum received up to January, 1887. The manu- 
script is included in fifteen quarto volumes, and contains 1,394 pages of 
type- written and printed matter. This is invaluable as a resource for 
reference. 

Of the 1,646 accessions received during this year, no less than 369 
consisted of material sent for examination and report. The quantity of 
this material is rapidly increasing each year, and a classified list may 
be found in the chapter on laboratory work. 

A geographical statement has been prepared, showing the sources of 
the more important accessions.

Dall, Department of Mollusks; Mr. C. D. Walcott and Dr. 0. A. White, 
Departments of Paleozoic and Mesozoic Invertebrate Fossils ; Prof. 
Lester F. Ward, Departments of Fossil and Recent Plants, and Prof. F. 
W. Clarke, Department of Minerals. 

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. 

Dr. A. K. Fisher, of the Bureau of Economic Ornithology, sent Spar- 
row-hawk, Eed-tailed hawks, Eed-shouldered hawks, Eed-breasted mer- 
ganser, and birds' nests and eggs. The Museum still enjoys the co- 
operation of Prof. C. V. Riley, the entomologist of the Department, as 
honorary curator of insects. 

U. S. FISH COMMISSION. 

Several collections of marine invertebrates, fishes, birds, shells, rep- 
tiles, etc., have been received ; also birds' nests and eggs, skulls of sail- 
fish, birds, lice from seals, 3 worm-eaten planks taken from schooner 
Melissa D. Bobbins, shark, fish, seals, fungi, etc. From Major T. B. Fer- 
guson was received a specimen of Barn-owl, and from C. H. Townsend 
15 specimens of Menopoma and eggs. Mr. Townsend made an explora- 
tion of Swan and Grand Cayman Islands, and has already forwarded a 
collection of birds, concerning which Mr. Ridgway, curator of birds, 
makes the following statement: 

Swan Island. — The collection from this place embraces 31 species, of 
which 22 are land birds. Of the latter 17 are migrants from Eastern 
North America j Coccysus seniculus is West Indian and Central Ameri- 
can ; Columba leucocephala belongs to the coast of Honduras and some 
of the Greater Antilles ; Mimocichla rubripes (of which a good series 
was collected) is identical with the Cuban species, instead of being that 
found on Grand Cayman (M. ravida Cory); Contopus albicollis Lawr"? 
(2 specimens) is probably identical with a Yucatan species, and Dendro- 
ica vitellina Cory, is identical with a species found elsewhere only on 
Grand Cayman. The only new form is a Butorides, allied to B. virescens, 
but altogether darker in coloration, and perhaps different enough to be 
considered specifically distinct. 

The water-birds include five specimens of the following: Tringa 
maculata, Ereunetes pusillus, Totanus flavipes, Porzana Carolina, Sula 
eyanops, S. piscator, S. sula, and Fregetta aquila. 

Grand Cayman. — Mr. Townsend's collection from this island contains 
12 species, including 5 of the 13 new species obtained by Mr. Cory's 
collector, viz : Certhiola sharpei, Dendroica vitellina, Centurus cayman- 



60 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

ensis (good series), Quiscalus caymanensis, Myiarchm denigratus, and 
Vireo caymanensis. Mr. Town send also collected a good series of the 
Dendroiea which Mr. Cory identified (from a very poor specimen) as D. 
petechis gundlacki, which proves to be a very strongly characterized 
new race, not specially near to anything else. 

Notwithstanding the very limited time spent on Grand Cayman Mr. 
Townsend did remarkably well, and the specimens secured by him are 
in fine plumage and beautifully prepared. 

Although the results attained on Swan Island are disappointing, 
they show clearly that that island is, geologically, of very recent forma- 
tion, and none of the birds (except the Butorides, which is a peculiarly 
"plastic" type) have yet had time to become differentiated into local 
forms. Additional collections are expected and will be referred to in 
the next report. 

BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY. 

A series of 30 photographs of Apache Indians — 10 of the Sacs and 
Foxes, and 39 of Winnebagoes, Utes, and Osages — was received. 
Models of the pueblos Bonito and Shemopavi, and, ruin of Peiiasco 
Blanco were also transferred. These numbered about 400 specimens in 
all. Dr. Washington Matthews s^nt a woolen blanket worn by a Navajo 
Indian. Prof. H. W. Henshaw sent birds' nests, eggs, and skeleton. 

Mr. W. H. Holmes, of the Bureau, has continued to act as honorary 
curator of the Department of American Aboriginal Pottery. 

EXPLOEATIONS. 

It is deemed appropriate to mention in this report certain explora- 
tions which have been made during the year, and which have redounded 
to the advantage of the Museum. 

An expedition under the direction of Mr. William T. Hornaday was 
sent to Montana in May, 1886, in search of buffalo. The object of this 
undertaking was to secure a sufficient number of specimens for exhibi- 
tion and for exchange with other museums. A subsequent expedition 
was sent out in the fall of the same year. The results have been highly 
gratifying. Special mention is made in this connection of the valued 
co-operation rendered to the Institution in this enterprise by the War 
Department, the Northern Pacific Bailroad, and the Chicago, Milwaukee 
and St. Paul Bailroad. 

In addition to the collection of mammal skins and skeletons obtained 
by Mr. Hornaday on his first expedition, was a small collection of bird 
skeletons and skins. 

The following is a complete list of the specimens obtained : 

Antelope, Antilocapra americana, 2 skins and 3 skeletons. 

Prairie Hare, Lepus campestris, skin and skeleton. 

Wood Hare, Lepus sylvaticus, 2 skins. 

Pale Chipmunk, Tamias asiaticus pallidus, skin. 

Coyote, Canis latratm, skin. 

Buffalo, Binon americanus, 3 skins, 7 skulls, and 5 skeletons.

Eastern Striped Spermophile, Spermophilus tridecim-lineatua (skin.) 

White-footed Mouse, Hesperomys leticopus, skin. 

Muskrat, Fiber sibethicus, 3 skins. 

Sage Cock, Centrocercus urophasianus, 2 skeletons. 

Marsh Harrier, Circus hudsonius, skeleton. 

Blue-winged Teal, Querquedula discors, skeleton. 

Shoveller Duck, Spatula clypeata, skeleton. 

Blue-headed Grackle, Scolecophagus cyanocephalus, skeleton.

Shore Lark, EremophiJa aJpestris, skeleton. 

Lark Finch, Chondestes grammacus, skeleton. 

Western Mourning Dove, Zenaidura macroura, skeleton. 

Mountain Plover, ^Egialitis montana, skeleton. 

As the result of the second expedition quite a large collection of skins, 
skeletons, and skulls of buffalo, deer, antelopes, wolves, and smaller 
animals was received.* The collection included the following species : 
Bison americanus, Ganis latrans, Antilocapra americana, Gariacus macro- 
tis, G. virginianus, Yulpes velox, and Taxidea americana. 

One of the buffaloes, an old bull, the most conspicuous of the 
group now being mounted by Mr. Hornaday for exhibition in the Mu- 
seum, has attracted considerable attention. This specimen was ex- 
amined by several gentlemen who from familiarity with the animal in 
its native condition were competent to express an opinion as to the ac- 
curacy of the taxidermist's work. Among the gentlemen who examined 
it were General Stewart Van Vliet, of the U. S. Army, and Col. 
James Stevenson, of the Bureau of Ethnology. Both of these gentle- 
men expressed their opinion in writing, and copies of their letters are 
herewith given : 

Washington, D. C, March 10, 1887. 

My Dear Professor Baird : On the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant I saw 
General Sheridan, and yesterday we called on your taxidermist and examined the 
buffalo bull he is setting up for the Museum. I don't think I have ever seen a more 
splendid specimen in my life. General Sheridan and I have seen millions of the 
buffalo on the plains in former times. I have killed hundreds, but I never killed a 
larger specimen than the one in the possession of your taxidermist. 

General Sheridan thought the animal was too tall, but the taxidermist showed us,- 
in his note-book, the measurements he made of the animal when he shot him, and 
they agreed with the stuffed animal. I thought that the left hind leg might be 
brought forward 6 inches. This would make the animal look a little shorter, but I 
doubt if I would do even this. It is a magnificent specimen as it is, and perfectly 
natural. You will have this consolation, anyhow, even if the animal is exaggerated — 
which he is not — and that is, not one in ten thousand who looks at him ever has or 
ever will see a live buffalo. 
Yours, sincerely, 

Stewart Van Vliet, 
Brevet Hajor-General U. S. Army.

62 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

Smithsonian Institution, Bureau of Ethnology, 

Washington, D. C, April 14, 1887. 

Dear Sir : After having made two visits especially to examine the buffalo bull 
which you recently secured from the West, and the mounting of which you have just 
about completed, I beg to freely express my opinion in regard to the same ; that is, 
as to the general correctness of the attitude, shape, and appearance of the specimen. 
At first sight I would say that it appears too full about the rump ; in the next place 
the specimen appeared somewhat lengthy, and the vertebral ridge does not seem 
quite prominent or sharp enough, especially to the rear of the loins. I think, how- 
ever, as to the criticism first expressed, after a closer examination of the robe or coat, 
it is quite evident that the animal was in an unusually fleshy condition, as the coat- 
ing of hair is the finest and heaviest I ever saw on a bull, either young or old, and this 
quite satisfactorily accounts for the fullness of the rump and the hind quarters. As 
to the second question, that is the length, I find upon examination of over two hun- 
dred measurements of buffalo bulls made by myself both before and subsequent to the 
war, when buffalo were counted by the millions, and the best specimens were avail- 
able, that your specimen is as nearly correct in every respect as it is possible to make 
it. I find also upon examination that the profusion of wool along the back fully 
accounts for the apparent defect in the prominence of the backbone. 

On general principles I would say from an extensive personal experience in skin- 
ning buffalo and preparing and mounting specimens during a period of many years, 
when the entire northern and western parts of our country were roamed over by vast 
herds of buffalo, that you have been most fortunate in securing one of the finest, if 
not the finest, specimen I ever saw, almost perfect in every respect, and in my opinion 
beyond criticism in the completeness of mounting, anatomical appearance, and nat- 
uralness of attitude. 

I do not think that any one could safely venture to criticise any feature of the speci 
men referred to who has not killed, measured, and mounted specimens themselves. 
Very respectfully, etc., 

James Stevenson. 

William T. Hornaday, Esq., 

Taxidermist, U. S. National Museum. 

A full account of these expeditions is given in a special paper pre- 
pared by Mr. Hornaday and published in Section in of this report. 

Mr. 0. G. Pringle, an accomplished botanist, went to northern Mexico 
under the auspices of Harvard University and the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution for the purpose of securing botanical and general natural history 
collections. 

Dr. T. H. Bean, on a cruise in the XL S. Fish Commission steamer 
Albatross, investigated the movements of the " southern mackerel." 

A party sent out by the IT. S. Geological Survey to make explora- 
tions in the Upper Mississippi Valley was accompanied by Dr. E. K. 
Gurley, of the Museum, who went for the purpose of securing additional 
material for the collection of Cambrian fossils in the Museum. This 
party left in June, and nothing has yet "been heard as to the results of 
Dr. Gurley's work. 

Through the courtesy of the Secretary of the Navy a valuable col- 
lection of stone objects was obtained from Easter Island. A full ac- 
count of this collection is given on pages 15-16.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOGY IN THE NATIONAL 

MUSEUM, 1887. 



By Otis T. Mason, Curator. 



During the fiscal year 1886-'87 the Department of Ethnology has re- 
ceived many important additions. Chief among these may be mentioned 
a beautiful series of Greenland costumes, from Mrs. Lilla May Pavy ; a 
collection of costumes and implements from northern Alaska, from Mr. 
E. P. Herendeen; many valuable articles from Kotzebue Sound, given by 
Lieut. George M. Stoney, U. S. Navy; Mr. S.Applegate's collection from 
Togiak River, Alaska; Mr. J. W. Johnson's collection from Fort Alex- 
ander, Alaska ; Mr. William J. Fisher's collection from Ugashik, Alaska; 
Mr. Charles Willoughby's collection from the Quinaielt Indians, Wash- 
ington Territory ; an immense number of ethnological objects from the 
Zuni and Moki pueblos, secured by Col. James Stevenson and the Bureau 
of Ethnology. A collection of rare and valuable specimens from the 
Congo region, brought by Lieut. E. H. Taunt, U. S. Navy; many precious 
objects from China and Japan, the gift of Dr. D. Bethune McCartee ; 
and an exceedingly valuable series from the Department of Education 
in Japan, illustrating the common industries of that country. 

The last-named series especially illustrates a method of collecting 
which the curator thinks should supersede, as far as possible, that 
which has formerly prevailed. 

In following out this plan, the curator has sought to procure com- 
plete "outfits" of varied industries, with many pictures of steps in art 
processes, and minute detail of everything done and said from begin- 
ning to end. All of these furnish a polyorganic unit, to which desul- 
tory material may be referred. 

In pursuance of the plan hitherto adopted of elaborating series of 
specimens on purely natural history principles, the cradles of the Mu- 
seum, the scrapers of American savages, and the carrying apparatus 
pertainiug to the human pack-animal have been arranged and described. 

The chief labor of this department during the year, however, and the 
one of most lasting value, is the arrangement of the entire Eskimo col- 
lection according to our system, by Lieut. T. Dix Bolles, U. S. Navy.

6G REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

An exhaustive statement concerning this work accompanies this report, 
and will enable scholars to know the riches and deficiencies of the Na- 
tional Museum. 

As soon as our whole series can be worked out on the same plan, the 
Museum will furnish a type series of all savage apparatus. 

During the first half of this fiscal year the curator was favored with 
the assistance of Paymaster Webster, U. S. Navy.

REPORT ON THE SECTION OF AMERICAN ABORIGINAL POTTERY IN THE 
U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 



By W. H. Holmes, Honorary Curator. 



The work of the Department of Aboriginal Pottery has been carried 
forward in the lines indicated in the report of the preceding year. A 
number of new cases have been constructed and series of representative 
groups of relics have been transferred to them from the Smithsonian 
hall. 

Accessions have been numerous and important, but not equal in value 
to those of the years immediately preceding. The agencies through 
which the acquisitions were made are, first, those of the Smithsonian In- 
stitution and the National Museum, including donations, purchases, and 
the products of original researches; and second, those of the Bureau of 
Ethnology through corresponding channels. A series of pueblo pottery, 
ancient and modern, collected in 1886 by Mr. James Stevenson, of the 
Geological Survey, was turned over to this department during the year. 

Amongst the 160 numbers are some extremely fine specimens of the 
white and the polychrome wares of ancient Tusayan. A small series of 
vessels of the ancient white ware were secured by purchase from Mr. 
0. M. Landar, of Lawrence, Kansas. Capt. J. G. Bourke, of the TJ. S. 
Army, presented a series of small plain and coiled vases obtained by 
him from cliff dwellings and caves in Arizona. 

A few small collections were made in the Mississippi Valley and in 
the eastern States by Dr. Cyrus Thomas and his assistants. 

From Mexico some interesting accessions have been made. Dr. Ed- 
ward Palmer obtained from the State of Chihuahua a number of vases 
and fragments of ancient earthenware, besides a series of modern works 
and a most instructive set of pottery-making utensils. This collection 
was purchased for the Museum by the Bureau of Ethnology. A small 
number of interesting pieces of ancient ware, collected in the valley of 
Mexico, were acquired by purchase from Mr. Ward Batchelor. 

By exchange with museums in France, through the agency of Mr. 
John Durand, we have acquired a number of interesting pieces of Mex- 
ican and Peruvian work. 

A valuable collection of vases and other earthenware relics from the 
graves of ancient Peru, was purchased by the Bureau of Eth nology from 
Mr. W. E. Curtis, and is now exhibited in the pottery court.

78 REPORT OP NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

Besides the above-mentioned accessions I may mention small series 
of earthen relics obtained through William J. Baker, C. J. Hering, A. 
A. Peling, J. K. Watson, J. N. McComb, jr., W. E. Safford, and E. M. 
Kirkby. 

This enumeration includes only those acquisitions that were turned 
over directly to the curator of the department. Other accessions of ob- 
jects of clay are included in series or sets intrusted to other depart- 
ments. 

The first catalogue number for the year is number 131934, and the 
last 132955. The total number of entries is 611. 

The curator has been occupied during the year in completing his 
studies of the collections from Ghiriqui and in taking initiatory steps 
looking toward the discussion of the ceramic art of ]M exico. 

A special paper upon a remarkable group of spurious antiquities 
from Mexico has been prepared and delivered to the Smithsonian In- 
stitution for publication. It is shown in this paper that for more 
than half a century the manufacture of pottery and certain other 
classes of objects has been extensively carried on and for no other pur- 
pose than to profit by sales to collectors of antiquities. It is also shown 
that museums in all parts of the world are well supplied with these 
spurious articles, and that a number of pieces have found their way 
into literature as genuine antiquities. Some twenty illustrations are 
given. They are taken from the most striking pieces in the National 
Museums of Mexico and of the United States, and from published 
illustrations. 

The papers published during the year are referred to in Section iv 
of this report. 



REPORT ON THE SECTION OF TRANSPORTATION IN THE U. S. NATIONAL 

MUSEUM, 1887. 



By J. Elfketh Watkins, Honorary Curator. 



During the year, work in the section of Steam Transportation has been 
conducted during such brief periods and irregular intervals that it has 
not been possible to make any systematic attempt to increase the col- 
lection or to install objects already obtained. 

By correspondence I have been able to ascertain the whereabouts of 
considerable material which will naturally be deposited in the National 
Museum when the section shall be fully organized. 

I have also succeeded in collecting a mass of information which I 
hope to make use of in preparing a series of models to illustrate the 
beginnings and the development of the English and American systems 
of track. 

While illustrated histories of the steam-boat and locomotive are nu- 
merous, I am not aware that any systematic attempt has been made to 
preserve the history of the development of the systems of permauent 
wa.y, which, after many years of experiment, are now being reduced to 
a series of standards depending on the traffic. 

My connection with the Amboy division of the Pennsylvania Rail- 
road Company, of which the famous old Camden and Amboy Railroad 
is a part, has made it possible for me to make a most interesting col- 
lection of rail sections, which I shall deposit in the Museum as soon as 
space for the purpose can be assigned. 

A section of the first rail rolled with a base, which has ever since 
been known as the American rail, has been installed in the collection. 
This rail was designed by Robert L. Stevens, president of the Camden 
and Amboy Railroad Company, and was manufactured in Wales under 
his supervision in 1830-'3L A fac-simile of his letter (and draft of the 
cross- section first proposed)* to the English iron-masters soliciting pro-

posals for manufacturing it, is reproduced in Plate I. It is a most in- 
teresting relic. 

At the time that this rail was ordered, the section (Fig. 1) was in use 
on the best railroads in England, and modifications of it with the 
11 fish-bellied " stem had been imported and laid on several American 
roads.

I shall be glad if those interested in the matter and who have access 
to old rail piles will collect short sections, say 2 or 3 inches long, of the 
rails used on the roads in various States during early times and pre- 
serve them for future reference,

EEPORT ON THE SECTION OF TRANSPORTATION. 81 

I am much gratified to find that the interest shown by many rail- 
roads officials and others when the work was first inaugurated still 
continues, notwithstanding the fact that it has been found necessary to 
delay the organization of the section upon a basis commensurate with 
its importance. 

It is to be hoped that the affairs of the Museum will be in such a 
condition as to permit the inauguration of active work early during 
the coming fiscal year.

REVIEW OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ACCESSIONS. 

The following are the most important additions to the collection dur- 
ing the year : 

Edward L. Hyde, of Middleborough, Massachusetts, sent six casts of depressions 
produced by grinding stone implements, taken from the rock on "which they occur, 
at Middletown, Rhode Island. 

W. W. Adams, of Mapletou,New York, sent a flint fish-hook from Cayuga County, and 
a copper dart-head found near the south end of Owasco Lafee, in the same county. 

From the Peabody Museum, Cambridge, Massachusetts (through Prof. F. W. 
Putnam), were obtained six argillite implements taken from the quaternary gravels 
at Trenton, New Jersey, by Dr. Charles C. Abbott, and two photographs, one show- 
ing the Abbott collection in the Peabody Museum, and the other a number of bone 
fish-hooks belonging to different collections in the same museum. 

Dr. Charles C. Abbott, ofTrentoD, New Jersey, presented two argillite implements 
taken by the donor from the Trenton gravels, about 6 feet below the surface. 

A. R. Roessler, of Liberty Hill, Texas, sent a cutting tool remarkable for unusual 
notching, from Fall Creek, San Saba County, Texas. 

C. T. Wiltheiss, of Piqua, Oho, gave a good cast of a stone pipe in the form of an 
animal's head. The original was found in Piqua. 

T. L. Whitehead, of Dexter City, Missouri, sent a collection from a mound in Stod- 
dard County: A qnartzite celt, with expanding cutting-edge, chipped and afterwards 
polished, a large flint digging-tool, a large carved stone pipe (calumet pipe), eight 
clay vessels, and two fragments of pottery (birds' heads). A very good collection. 

H. W. Turner, of the U. S. Geological Survey, gave a stone mortar from auriferous 
gravel on the north side of American River, near Folsom, Sacramento County, Cali- 
fornia. This mortar is of elegant form, and differs from any in the collection. 

W. Cuppage, of Winfield, Kansas, gave a copper celt-gouge, found at Sunnidale, 
near Georgian Bay, Lake Huron, Ontario, Canada. 

From W. W. Blake, of Kansas City, Missouri, was obtained the Fischer collection of 
Mexican autiquities, consisting of obsidian flakes and cores, arrow and spear heads 
of obsidian, flint, and chalcedony, a large cutlass-shaped weapon or implement of ob- 
sidian, polished celts and chisels, polishing-tools, pendants of chalcedony, obsidiau, 
and other materials, some in the shape of human and animal figures and heads, lab- 
rets of obsidian, a large number of stone heads (partly of jade), mirrors of iron py-

rites, a small skull carved iu rock-crystal, stone carvings in human and animal forms 
(a number consisting of jade), face-marks (human) of serpentine, steatite, -white 
marble, and obsidian, a carved box with lid (of volcanic stone), an ornamented stone 
cylinder 16 inches in diameter, probably part of a column, copper or bronze objects 
embracing celts, chisels, awls, needles, bells, T-shaped objects, and a small human 
head. Further, clay spindle- whorls, vess Is of various forms (plain and ornamented), 
a pipe, musical instruments, figures (human), and a number of stamps. This col- 
lection contains many rare and even unique specimens. 

J. C. Zeledon, of San Jose", Costa Rica, gave a very large and fine metate from 
Costa Rica. 

W. E. Safford, ensign, U. S. Navy, obtained and presented a collection from ancient 
graves near the beach at Arica, Peru. Eight flint dart- heads (four inserted iu wooden 
stems and representing the detachable part of harpoons), a grooved stone sinker, two 
implements, a ladle, a small box with partitions, and five pin-shaped objects, all of 
wood ; a copper knife with wooden handle, four copper fish-hooks, one with line at- 
tached, a bone fish-hook with line and stone sinker, a fishing line, three spines of cac- 
tus (?), one with a head of plaited rushes, a spindle with whorl and cord attached, two 
wooden combs (?), two toy mattresses made of twigs, a Pandean pipe of small reeds, 
pulverized mineral substances taken from the blanket of a female mummy, and three 
fragments of pottery. 

S. H. Drew, of Wanganui, New Zealand, sent seventy-five flakes of obsidian and 
chert from a Maori kitchen-midden, a fish-hook made of shell and bone, fragments of 
Moa bones, and a plaster cast of a nephrite idol. 

James F. Johnson, of Holywood, Ireland, sent a collection of prehistoric antiquities 
from county Down : Rude stone celts or axes, pounding or crushing stones, rude im- 
plements more or less leaf-shapexl, fragments of animal bones (split), ox-teeth and 
teeth of deer or elk from caves at Ballymenoch and Craigavad ; hammer-stones, pol- 
ishing-stones, and rude axes and celts from an ancient manufactory at Ballymenoch; 
crushing-stones, a hammer stone, rude celts, arrow and spear-heads, scrapers, knives, 
harpoon-heads (?), sinkers, and sling-stones, all of flint, from second raised beach at 
Holywood. 

Thomas Wilson, of Washington, recently United States consul at Nice, has de- 
posited a large and valuable collection of prehistoric and, to some extent, historic 
antiquities, gathered by himself in Italy, Switzerland, France, England, and the 
Scandinavian countries, which was received and catalogued during the latter part of 
this year. The contribution embraces drift and cave relics (paleolithic age), objects 
belonging to the neolithic age and to the bronze period, and specimens of Etruscan 
and Roman origin. The whole collection, the value of which can hardly be over- 
estimated, contains 10>297 articles, and the entries nearly fill a volume of the cata- 
logue. It would be impossible to give in the limited space of this report a statement 
in detail of the collection, but at the same time something more than the brief abstract 
above given is due both to the donor and to the collection. Where every specimen 
is of importance it is hard to discriminate, but worthy of special mention are the 
objects from the well-known caves of Southern France, the articles from the Dolmens 
in Brittany, and a fiue series of implements of stone, bone, and horn, including a num- 
ber of clay vessels (entire), from the Swiss lakes. Scandinavia is represented by a 
large number of chipped implements, and a series of perforated axes in different 
stages of manufacture, from the rude beginning to the finished specimen. Last, but 
not least, is the bronze collection, which numbers over seven hundred objects. In 
this we have an exhibit which can not be duplicated, except, perhaps, by some of the 
larger European museums. It contains specimens from Scandinavia, from the Swiss 
lakes, and a large number of Etruscan origin. Considering the fact that there were 
less than fifty articles of bronze in the collection previous to this accession, its im- 
portance will at once be seen. 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF ARCHEOLOGY. 85 

The entering of specimens and their distribution, either for exhibition 
or for exchange, has been carried on in accordance with the plan indicated 
in the last annual report. This being the case, any further statement 
would be only a repetition. 

Duplicates have been sent in exchange as follows : 

To O. P. Rogers, Marengo, McHenry County, Illinois.— A grooved stone hammer. 

To Dr. Alfred R. Wallace, Frith Hill, Godalming, England. — Collection of arrow- 
heads (114 specimens). 

To Dr. Oskar Schneider, Dresden, Saxony. — Six small bottles of shell beads (Cali- 
fornia). 

To Edward Lovett, West Burton House, Outram Road, Croydon, England. — Col- 
lection of archaeological specimens (52). 

The curator of this department has been engaged during the year 
in the composition of a work on North American antiquities, entitled 
" The Typical Forms of North American Prehistoric Eelics of Stone and 
Copper in the U. S. National Museum." 

The present state of the collection is shown by the following tabular

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF MAMMALS IN THE U. S. NATIONAL 

MUSEUM, 1887. 



By Frederick YV. True, Curator. 



The most important work of the year has been the commencement of 
a re-arrangement of the exhibition hall. Of the movable cases which 
were in the hall at the close of the last year but one remains, and the 
wall cases have been remodeled and added to. 

The new floor cases depart from the standard originally adopted for 
other departments of the Museum. Their size and proportions were de- 
termined upon after a careful study of the material to be exhibited, and 
the collection is, therefore, seeu to a much greater advantage than for- 
merly. The new wings added to the wall cases are designed for the re- 
ception of the longest specimens in the collection (the ruminants, seals, 
etc.), which have not hitherto been under cover, and have been subject 
to injury at the hands of visitors. 

As a result of the expedition into Montana, under the charge of Mr. 
W. T. Hornaday, sent out by the Institution, the Museum has come 
into the possession of a very fine series of specimens of the Bison — a 
matter of great importance in view of the approaching extinction of 
that species. 

The reference series has been enriched by purchases and donations of 
well-preserved skins of certain North American species of Mammals in 
which the collection was previously deficient. 

In a region like North America, where, in many cases, the range of 
a species extends over thousands of square miles, and the species itself 
is differentiated into numerous geographical races, a large series of 
specimens will alone suffice to enable the student of zoogeography, or 
the systematist, to work out the problems with which he has to deal; 
and since the characters, which are chiefly relied upon for distinguish- 
ing subspecies, are external, it is necessary that the skins should be 
prepared in the very best manner. It is in this direction that the 
growth of the reference series of the National collection ought to tend, 
The work of the past year is but a beginning. 

87 



88 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

Six species and one subspecies have been added to the North Ameri- 
can fauna during the year. These are — 

Hesperomys taylori Thomas. (Texas.) 
Hesperomys anthonyi Merriani. (New Mexico.) 
Neotoma bryanti Merriam. (Lower California.) 
Dipodomys deserti Stephens. (California.) 
Vespertilio longicrus True. (Paget Sound.) 
Vespertilio ciliolabrum Merriam. (Western States.) 
Thomomys talpoides perpallidus Merriam. (California.) 

Of H. taylori the Museum possesses one specimen, a very defective 
skin, in alcohol, which was found soon after the species had been de- 
scribed by Mr. Thomas. R. anthonyi is represented by two specimens 
(apparently a subspecies) purchased from Mr. Stephens, who also pre- 
sented the type of his Dipodomys deserti. 

Several specimens of Thomomys perpallidus were purchased from Mr. 
Stephens. Neotoma bryanti is not in the collection. Vespertilio cilio- 
labrum is represented by several specimens, but of V. longicrus only the 
type (No. 15623) is known. 

NOTES ON IMPORTANT ACCESSIONS. 

The accessions of the past year compare favorably in point of inter- 
est with those of former periods. The sources from which they have 
been derived have been unusually varied. 

The amount of material received from the different Bureaus of the 
Government has not been so great as in some previous -years, while the 
number of private contributions has increased. For the first time in 
the history of the department a considerable number of specimens has 
been purchased. 

TERRESTRIAL MAMMALS. 

North America. — One of the most important accessions of the year 
was the series of skins and skeletons of the American Bison, obtained 
in Custer County, Montana, by the expedition sent out by the Smith- 
sonian Institution (Mr. W. T. Hornaday in charge). A portion of this 
series, comprising individuals of both sexes and of different ages, has 
been mounted by Mr. Hornaday and his assistants and will soon be 
placed on exhibition. Good specimens of the Prong-horn Antelope, Coy- 
ote, etc., were also obtained by this expedition. The party sent out to 
reconnoiter in this region in the summer of 1886 found the Bison in poor 
condition and made no attempt to secure a series. They brought back 
a living Bison calf, which, however, survived but a few weeks. 

Two collections of Mammals from southern California, purchased 
from Mr. F. Stephens, of San Bernardino, California, contain excellent 
specimens of numerous species occurring in that region, in which the 
Museum collections were previously deficient. Among these may be 
mentioned the Bound-tailed Spermophile, Spermophilus tereticaudus ; 
Anthony's Field Mouse, Hesperomys anthonyi; and the Desert Pocket- 
rat, Dipodomys deserti, of which the describer (Mr. Stephens) had pre- 
viously presented the type to the Museum. 



EEPOET ON THE DEPARTMENT OF MAMMALS. 89 

The Mammals collected by Mr. Charles H. Townsend in northern 
California, and described in the Proceedings of the Museum (Yol. x, pp. 
159-241), were added to the study series during the year. 

Dr. J. C. Merrill, U. S. Army, stationed at Fort Klamath, Oregon, 
has presented a considerable number of interesting specimens taken in 
the vicinity of the fort, including a series of Sorex vagrans. 

Among the specimens of North American Ungulates received during 
the year was a very fine pair of antlers of the Wapiti, presented by the 
Hon. L. Q. C. Lamar. Col. Cecil Clay and Mr. B. A. Klock presented 
the skins of a female Moose and calf captured in Maine, together with 
photographs of the head of a Moose. An albino Virginia Deer from 
Clover Creek, Virginia, was purchased in the Washington market. 
Prof. George F. Atkinson, of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, prepared and 
presented a series of the southern variety of the common Chipmunk, 
Tamias striatus. A similar series of Eichardson's Spermophile, 8. rich- 
ardsoni, was presented by Mr. E. E. Thompson, of Manitoba. The 
Museum is indebted to Mr. Daniel C. Beard for the storehouse and nest 
of a Field Mouse, H. leucopus. Good specimens of the rather rare 
Mountain Beaver, Haplodon rufus, and of the Dusky-footed Wood Bat, 
N.fuscipes, were purchased from Mr. A. Todd, of Elk Head, Oregon. 

Central and South America (including West Indies). — By far the most 
interesting accession from the West Indies was a living specimen of 
the Almiqui, Solenodon cubanas, which was probably the first example 
of the species ever brought alive to the United States. It was obtained, 
together with two others, a female and a young individual, through 
Mr. John Gundlach, and was captured in the Sierra Maestra Mount- 
ains, Cuba. Mr. C. B. Cory presented about 56 specimens of the rare 
Bat known as Natalus niicropus. These were obtained in Old Provi- 
dence Island. Yucatan. Only the type-specimen was previously known. 
The authorities of the British Museum presented a specimen of the South 
American variety of the Horny Bat, Atalapha cinerea grayi, a variety not' 
previously in the Museum collections. A specimen of the rare Ouakari 
Monkey, Brachyurus rubicundus, and three specimens of a South Ameri- 
can Deer, believed to be C. gymnotis, were presented by the Zoological 
Society of Philadelphia. Mr. Anastasio Alfaro presented a series of 
skins. of Sciurus hypopyrrhus and 8. rufoniger prepared by himself. 

Old World. — A number of mounted specimens of European Mammals 
were received from Mr. E. Hargitt, among which may be mentioned a 
specimen of the Wild Cat, Felis catus, and the European Badger, Meles 
taxus. In exchange for North American mammals, Dr. Tycho Tullberg, 
on the part of the Upsala Museum, sent a small collection of Swedish 
species. By a similar exchange the Museum received from the Museum 
d 'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, a number of skeletons of Old World spe- 
cies, including the Gorilla, Bactrian Camel, Civet Cat, Enlellus Monkey, 
etc. Among a number of Tasmanian mammals presented by the Fish 
Acclimatization Society of Ballarat, are a very fine native Wolf, Thyla- 
cinus cynocephalus, and two specimens of the so-called Tasmanian Devil, 



90 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

Dasyurus ursinus. Specimens of the two species mentioned were also 
received from the authorities of the Australian Museum and have been 
mounted. 

As in former years, the Philadelphia Zoological Society (through Mr. 
A. E. Brown) has presented to the Museum a number of valuable mam- 
mals which died in the gardens. The following species deserve special 
mention : Capra ibex $ , Hystrix cristata, Herpestes widdingtoni, Gercopi- 
thecus diana, and G. sabceus. 

Mr. W. A. Conklin, superintendent of the Ceutral Park Menagerie in 
New York, presented a tiger cub ; and Messrs. Barton and Logan, of 
Washington, a specimen of Ateles arachnoides. 

AQUATIC MAMMALS. 

Seals. — The most interesting representative of this order received dur- 
ing the year is a skeleton of an adult male West India Monk Seal, Mon- 
achus tropicalis, purchased from Mr. H. A. Ward, who obtained it in Los 
Triangulos Islands, off Yucatan. Capt. M. A. Heaty, of the U. S. Eev- 
euue Marine, presented three skins of the Kibbon-seal, P. fasciata, ob- 
tained off the Alaska coast. During the winter of 18S6-'87 a number 
of Harbor seals were taken in the fish-nets off Wood's Holl, Massachu- 
setts, and were forwarded to the Museum by the agent of the U. S, Fish 
Commission at that point. 

Cetaceans. — A second skull of the interesting Porpoise described by 
the curator some time since, under the name of Phocama dalli, was 
presented by Lieut. Commander H. E. Nichols, U. S. Navy, who obtained 
it, together with a skeleton of P. communis, on the coast of southern 
Alaska. The species is unquestionably valid. From the U. S. life-sav- 
ing station at Dam Neck Mills, Virginia (Mr. Bay ley T. Barco, keeper), 
were obtained skeletons of the common Dolphin, D. delphis, the Pygmy 
Sperm Whale, Kogia breviceps, and the short-finned Black-fish, Globi- 
cephalus brackypterus. Specimens of the latter species, which is quite 
distinct from the Blackfish of our northern coast, were also obtained 
from Osprey, Florida, through the efforts of Mr. Joseph Willcox. 

DOMESTIC ANIMALS. 

The series illustrative of the breeds of the domestic Dog has received 
several important accessions during the year. Among the races repre- 
sented are a Blenheim Spaniel, an Irish Setter (Glenclaire), two Grey- 
hounds, and a Bloodhound. A skull of a Pointer dog fourteen years 
old and the skull of a Newfoundland dog were also received. 

Important changes in the arrangement of the exhibition hall have 
taken place during the year, 

The large special case for the group ot Fur Seals, mentioned in the 
last report, was finished and the group was placed therein. 

The new floor cases referred to in last year's report were received in 
February and the old cases were released and removed from the hall. 
The new cases are furnished with large glasses aud are to be fitted with 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF MAMMALS. 91 

terraced bases instead of shelves. No diaphragms are employed. The 
specimens will be seen to a much better advantage in these cases than 
they could be while the old cases were in use, and the general appear- 
ance of the hall is likewise greatly improved by their introduction. 
None of the fittings have yet been completed, but it is expected that 
they will be finished early in the coming year. 

The installation of the cetacean casts over the wall cases, which was 
contemplated last year, has been carried into effect. Finding that the 
glasses in the tops of the wall cases were constantly in danger of being 
broken, they were removed and wooden panels were substituted. At 
the same time the entire interior of the cases was painted afresh, and 
a partial re-arrangement of the specimens was effected. 

After much deliberation it was deemed best to place the Seals and 
large Ungulates under glass to protect them from ruthless hands. A 
large wing has been added on the south end of each of the wall cases 
These wings (which practically form cases by themselves) are the high- 
est and deepest cases which have thus far been erected. They are over 
12 feet in height and are 7 feet deep in the deepest part. The Moose, 
Wapiti, Sea Lion, and other large mammals in the collection, will be ar- 
ranged in them, the Ungulates occupying one wing while the other is 
given up to the Seals and Sea Lion. They will be furnished and in use 
early in the coming year. 

There are at present in the hall thirty floor cases, including the two 
large cases containing the groups of Orangs and Fur Seals ; and the 
two large wall cases referred to above. The principal addition during 
the ensuing year will be a large case for the group of Bison now in the 
hands of the taxidermists. 

The mounted specimens added to the exhibition series during the 
year were chiefly Marsupials. The collection of representatives of that 
group is now large and very interesting. Of the placental Mammals 
added to the series may be mentioned as especially worthy of notice, 
the Tiger, Leopard, Cheetah, and Califoruian Sea Elephant. 

The species represented by the specimens added to the exhibition 
series during the year were as follows : 

Black Macaque, Cynocephalus niger. Ursine Dasyure, Dasyurus ursinus. 

Leopard, Felts leopardus. Great Rock Kangaroo, Macropus rooustus. 

Tiger, Fells tigris. Parry's Kangaroo, Macropus pqrryi. 

European Wild Cat, Felis catus. Bennett's Wallaby, Halmaturus oennettL 

Cheetah, Cyncelurus juoatus. Red-legged Wallaby, Halmaturus wilcoxi. 

Coyote, Canis latrans. Red-bellied Wallaby, Halmaturus oilliar- 
Red Fox, Vulpes fulvusc dii. 

European Ermine, Putorius erminea. Red-necked Wallaby, Halmaturus rufi- 
Europeau Badger, Meles taxus. collis. 

Califoruian Sea Elephant, MacrorMnus an- Pademelon Wallaby, Halmaturus thetidis. 

gustirostris. Crescent-marked Wallaby, Onychogalea tit- 
Hedgehog, Frinaceus europmus, natus. 

Black R Mus rattus. Rufous Rat-Kangaroo, Bettongia rtifescens. 

Rabbit, Lepus cuniculus. Vulpine Phalanger, Phalangista vulpina. 
Tasinanian Wolf, Thylacinus cynocephalus Wombat, Phascolomys ursinus. 



92 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

The work of preparing specimens was considerably retarded by the 
absence of the chief taxidermist, who, as already stated, spent about 
three months in collecting specimens of Bison in Montana. As an offset, 
however, the exhibition hall will soon be graced by a very fine group 
of Bison. 

Nearly all the larger mounted specimens were cleaned and repaired 
while the wall cases were being painted, and they are, therefore, in ex- 
cellent condition. It is confidently hoped that when the new cases are 
completed the hall will present a much more attractive appearance than 
ever before. 

The laboratory and office of the department were moved to a section 
of the Museum building in which the accumulation of dust, complained 
of in the last report, is less troublesome. The office now adjoins the 
exhibition hall, a matter of great convenience. 

The laboratory had previously been fitted with racks, and the drawers 
containing the "study" series of skins were, therefore, simply trans- 
ferred from the old racks to the new ones. The alcoholic series was 
temporarily placed in the south gate-way, where they have remained 
during the year. The erection of shelves in this space for the accommo- 
dation of the alcoholic series is contemplated, since it is very desirable 
that this series should be separated from the collection of skins. 

The card catalogue has not yet been copied, but the first draft has 
been brought up to date. All specimens received during the year have 
been entered in the registers upon receipt and assigned to their proper 
places. 

The rather large labels attached to the Eodents and other small species 
have been replaced by a smaller form, which renders the specimens less 
liable to injury when handled. The metal tags have also been discarded 
in the case of the smallest species, since they tend to endanger the in- 
tegrity of the specimens by their weight. 

The curator has had the assistance of a clerk and a copyist during 
the greater part of the year. He has been relieved of the care of the 
library. 

The curator has spent the greater part of the time available for study 
during the year in completing the review of the species of the family 
Delphinidce. The papers of Mr. McKay's Alaskan collection, on the 
Canada Lynx, on a new Mole from Japan, and on the genus Dipodomys, 
referred to in the report of last year, have been published. 

Mr. Nelson's report on his Alaskan collection was ordered printed by 
act of Congress, and the proof of the portion of the same referring to 
the Mammals has passed through the curator's hands. The small col- 
lection of Mammals forwarded to Washington by the Geographical and 
Exploring Commission of Mexico was identified by request of Mr. 
Ferrari-Perez, chief of the natural history section. 

The curator described, under the name Vespertilio longicrus, a new 
Bat received from Puget Sound. He also published a few notes on the 



EEPOET ON THE DEPARTMENT OF MAMMALS. 



93 



living specimens of the Alrniqui, Solenodon cubanus, which was obtained 
from Mr. J. Gundiach, and on a remarkable malformation of the hoofs 
of nn ass received from Texas. 

A considerable number of inquiries regarding North American Mam- 
mals have been responded to. A number of Texan species were identi- 
fied for Mr. G. H. Ragsdale, of Gainesville, in that State, who also 
received information regarding methods of preparation. Dr. D. D. 
Slade, of Cambridge, applied for information regarding the metacarpals 
of the Auroch and Bison. A controversy between this observer and 
Mr. F. A. Lucas on the value of the character drawn from the differ- 
ences in the metacarpals of the two species will be found in " Science." 

At the request of the Director, the curator spent some time in inves- 
tigating the question of the color variation of the Puma, Felis concolor. 

Dr. Harrison Allen examined the entire collection of deers 7 antlers in 
connection with the question of bilateral asymmetry in the class Mam- 
malia. 

The collections are in nearly the same condition as at the close of last 
year; it is, on the whole, quite satisfactory. The entire series is under 
control, though a final division of material remains to be made, and ap- 
pliances for keeping out dust are still needed. Very few of the speci- 
mens, either in the exhibition or study series of skins, are without 
written or printed labels. The alcoholic series is arranged by species 
in preserve jars, and* the specimens themselves, in most cases, have 
only simple metallic labels bearing the catalogue numbers. 

The number of specimens in the different series at the present date 
and at the close of the last fiscal year is shown in the following table :

1886, was No. 15482 • on June 30, 1S87, No. 15899. 



94 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887 



Although the conditiou of the collection as regards preservation may 
be considered as generally satisfactory, its condition as regards com- 
pleteness is quite otherwise. The need of larger series representing 
geographical races has already been referred to, and we now add some 
statistics as to the number of species represented. 

Murray, in his Geographical Distribution of Mammals (1866), recog- 
nizes 378 genera of Mammals. The National Museum possesses skins 
of representatives of about 207 of these, or somewhat less than three- 
fifths. Again, iu Troussart's Catalogue des Mammiferes (1880), 112 gen- 
era of recent Eoclents are given. Of these, the Museum possesses rep- 
resentatives of only 50 genera ; while of the 791 species recognized as 
belonging in the order, the Museum possesses skins of about 160. 

When it is remembered that the collection is chiefly made up of 
North American skins, it becomes evident that the exotic forms are 
but poorly represented. Though probably surpassing every other col- 
lection in the world in the amount of material representing a small 
number of species, it will not bear comparison in general richness with 
those of some other Museums of the first class, such as the British Mu- 
seum, the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle, at Paris, and the Eoyal Zoo- 
logical Museum of the Netherlands, at Leyden. Thus, in the latter in- 
stitution, in the genus Sciurus (Squirrels), 59 species are represented, 
or about six-sevenths of all known species. These 59 species are rep- 
resented by 638 mounted skins, an average of 11 specimens for each 
species. In the National Museum but 18 species of the same genus are 
represented. Again, the Leyden Museum has 26 mounted skins of the 
genus Manis (Pangolins), representing all of the seven known species; 
while the National Museum has but two specimens, representing two 
species.* 

The same scarcity of material obtains in the case of the Monkeys, 
Lemurs, Antelopes, and other groups. 

The desirability of securing more specimens of the larger Mamalia at 
the earliest day can not be too strongly set forth. The larger forms on 
every continent are rapidly diminishing in numbers, and some which 
were abundant half a century ago are now practically extinct. 

The danger that the National Museum will never be able to exhibit 
some of the largest and most striking forms is real. 

A list of the papers published during the year by the curator, and 
by co-operators, based upon Museum material, is included in the bibli- 
ography iu Section iv of this report.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF BIRDS IN THE U. S, NATIONAL 

MUSEUM, 1887. 



By Robert Ridgway, Curator. 



The character of work accomplished during the year has not differed 
materially from that of preceding years. 

During the fourth annual meeting of the American Ornithologists' 
Union, held November 16 to 18, inclusive, in the lecture hall of the 
National Museum, the gallery of the Department of Birds was thrown 
open to the assembled members of the union, who daily made profitable 
use of the library and collections in connection with the objects of the 
meeting and their researches as ornithologists. 

In October, 1886, the Government of Costa Eica sent to Washington 
Mr. Anastasio Alfaro as their accredited representative, to study the 
business methods and arrangement of collections in the U. S. National 
Museum. Being particularly interested in ornithology, Mr. Alfaro 
spent a very considerable part of his time in the Department of Birds, 
where he was shown every courtesy and extended every facility for 
familiarizing himself with the methods of the department. Since his re- 
turn to Costa Eica that Government has formally established a national 
museum at the capital, San Jose, of which Mr. Alfaro was made secre- 
tary. 

CLASSIFICATION AND PREPARATION OF SPECIMENS. 

In regard to the character of routine work in connection with the 
arrangement and classification of the collection and in the preparation 
of the exhibition and study series ther,e has been no change from the 
work of preceding years, there being no opportunity, in the absence of 
many facilities which are deemed desirable, for inaugurating any im- 
provements in the condition or arrangement of the collection. 

The taxidermist has performed the work here indicated : 

Birds mounted for exhibition series 262

REVIEW OF SPECIAL RESEARCHES PROSECUTED UPON MATERIAL 
BELONGING: TO THE DEPARTMENT. 

During the year Mr. Leonhard Stejneger lias prosecuted actively his 
very important researches iu Japanese ornithology, and the following 
families have been thoroughly worked up (put in shape for printing) 
during the year : Woodpeckers, Wrynecks, Eails, Tits, Thrushes (part), 
Pigeons, Auks ; also the order Herodiones (Herons, Storks, Spoonbills, 
and Ibises), and some smaller groups, as the genera Acanthis and 
Pyrrhula. Mr. Stejneger's researches are based on what is believed to 
be by far the richest collection' of Japanese birds extant, and are of 
very great importance, his methods being characterized by a peculiar 
degree of care and exactness. The published results include 100 pages 
referring exclusively to Japanese ornithology, in which are described 11 
new species. In addition to his investigation of Japanese ornithology 
Mr. Stejneger has worked up an interesting collection of birds from the 
island of Kauai, Hawaiian group, said collection embracing no less 
than 7 new species (out of a total of only 15 species) and 1 new genus. 

The curator has during the year completed his series of analytical 
keys to North American birds, soon to be published by the J. B. Lippin- 
cott Company, Philadelphia, under the title, "A Manual of North Amer- 
ican Birds," a book of royal octavo size, consisting of 031 pages and 
464 illustrations of the generic details. 

ACCESSIONS. 

The number of additions to the collection of birds has been large, 
and the following statement will show the sources of the more impor- 
tant contributions :

Colorado. 

From the Auckland Museum, Auckland, New Zealand, were received in exchange 
104 specimens, 59 species, all from New Zealand. An elegantly prepared collection, of 
unusual interest, containing many species new to the collection of the Museum. There 
are tine specimens of 2 species of Ocydromus, Strigops, 2 species of Nestor, Apteryx 
mantelli, Anarhynchus (4 specimens), Larus, Hcematopus nnicolor, etc.

Museum as yet possesses no complete specimen, the above head being the first frag- 
ment of this magnificent bird to reach the Museum ; 170 specimens, 70 species, chiefly 
from southern Arizona, and a few from Sonora, Mexico. Tbis collection is one of un- 
usual interest and value as containing a number of rare species excellently prepared. 
This is au exceedingly important accession, consisting as it does of a fine series of 7

beautifully prepared specimens of Colinus ridgwayi hitherto not represented in the 
Museum collection, and 4 equally fine specimens of a new subspecies of Callipepla 
elegans, named C. elegans bensoni by the curator in honor of its discoverer. A special 
interest arises from the fact that this collection was made about 150 miles from the 
United States and Mexican border lines.

of this species. 

From William Lloyd, of Paint Rock, Texas: 19 specimens, 9 species, mostly Vireos 
and Flycatchers, from Texas. Seven specimens, ten species, of Texan birds, among 
which are five species of Spiizella and a series of ThryotJiorus bairdi; two specimens of 
Spizella pusilla arenaceq. 

From George Marshall, of Laurel, Maryland: 2 Crossbills, Loxia curvirostra minor. 

From Fred. Mather, of Wood's Holl, Massachusetts : 2 chicks, in alcohol, of the 
Mandarin duck, Aix galcricnlata, bred in caj)tivity. 

From C. J. Maynard, of Boston, Massachusetts : 8 specimens of Puffinus auduboni, 
from the Bahamas; purchased 

From G. Frean Morcom, of Chicago, Illinois : An adult Little Brown Crane, Grus 
canadensis, in the flesh. 

From the National Museum of Costa Rica (through Mr. Anastasio Alfaro): 46 
specimens, 23 species, of birds from Costa Rica were received in exchange. 

From the Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio : 65 specimens, 51 species, from Africa 
(Natal and Gaboon), and from the Caroline Islands, were received in exchange. The 
collection is one of considerable importance, inasmuch as most of the species are 
new to the Museum, even a great number of interesting generic types beiug added 
to it ; 22 specimens, 21 species, from Southern and Western Africa, nearly all new 
to the collection, among them no less than three different species of Hornbills. 

From R. Ridgway, of Washington, D. C. : The type specimen of Falco richardsoni, 
from Colorado. 

From C. D. Riker, of New York City : A specimen of a new species of Picolaptes 
from the Lower Amazon, named by the curator P. rilceri. 

From Ernest E. T. Seton, of New York City : 6 specimens, 6 species, from Carberry, 
Manitoba. 

From George B. Sennett, of New York City : A chick, Buteo albicaudatus, from Texas, 
and 6 specimens of Bronzed Cowbirds, from Texas. 

From J. Schneck, of Mount Carmel, Illinois : A live Barred Owl, Syrnium nebulosum. 

From R. B. Sharpe, of London, England,: 38 specimens, 2 species. Extensive series 
of the British Redpoll, Acanthis cabaret, and the Linnet, Linaria cannabina, were 
received in exchange. 

From L. Stejneger, of Washington, D. C. : 40 specimens, 17 species, from Kamt- 
schatka. This is a very valuable addition to our coll ction of Kamtschatka birds, 
adding several species not hitherto possessed by the Museum. Among them is the 
typo of Picoides albidior Stejneger; 5 specimens, 5 species, of European birds, chiefly 
interesting as being young birds in the first plumage; 4 specimens, 3 species, from 
North America and Europe. One immature Kamtschatkan Sea Eagle, Thalassocetus 
pdagicus, was received in exchange. 

From F. Stephens, of San Bernardino, California: 33 specimens, 21 species, from 
Arizona, Colorado, and California were purchased. This collection consists mostly 
of rare birds, excellently prepared, and all special desiderata of the Museum ; also a 
specimen of Junco cincreus palliatus, from Arizona. 

From Lieut. George M. Stoney, U.S. Navy, of Washington, D. C. : 142 specimens, 
57 finecies, of birds from Putnam River, Alaska. This collection furnishes valuable 
information in regard to the geographical distribution of birds in Alaska. One of 
the most remarkable additions to the fauna of Northern Alaska is that of Picicorvus 
columbianus, of which there is only one previous record north of Sitka. 

From R. C. Stuart, of Tampa, Florida: A pair of Wurdemaun's Heron, Ardeaicuerde- 
manni, from Cape Sable, Florida, was purchased. The typo of this species (belonging 
to tho Museum) was for a long time unique, and the acquisition of additional speci- 



EEPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF BIRDS. 99 

mens is, therefore, of extreme interest. A mounted Wurdeinann's Heron, Ardea ivuer- 
demanni, from Cape Sable, Florida, and a fine specimen of the Great White Heron, 
Ardea occidentalis, from Southern Florida, were purchased. 

From the Swan Island Club, Swan Island, North Carolina: A specimen of the Ful- 
vous Tree Duck, Dendrocygna fulva, from Currituck Sound. 

From Ernest E. Thompson, of Toronto, Canada : 3 specimens of Canadian Ruffled 
Grouse, Bonasa umbellus togata, and 2 Prairie Sharp-tailed Grouse, Pedioccetes phasia- 
nellus campestris, were received in exchange; 35 specimens, 12 species, from Manitoba. 

From the Tokio Educational Museum, Tokio, Japan : 155 specimens, 107 species, all 
from Japan. This collection is especially valuable on account of the care with which 
the specimens are prepared, sexed, and labeled. It also contains several species new 
to the collection of the Museum, besides three species new to science. Many of the 
species in this collection were not previously represented in our Museum by Japanese 
specimens. Altogether, it is a most interesting and valuable accession, which in many 
respects completes the collection of Blakiston and Jouy, making the collection of 
Japanese birds in the National Museum one of the best ones, if not the best one, in ex- 
istence. 

From the U. S. Fish Commission : 108 specimens, 10 species, of water birds from the 
coasts of Massachusetts and from the Newfoundland banks, collected by the natural- 
ists at Wood's Holl and on board the "Albatross" and the ''Grampus." The collection 
is very valuable and interesting, containing, as it does, a series of 44 specimens of 
Puffinus iorealis (which was only described a few years ago, and up to date a very rare 
species in collections), besides very large series of Jaegers, Stercorarius parasiticus 
and pomarinus, illustrating the enormous individual color-variations in these birds. 
Nearly one-half of the collection was received in the flesh and was prepared by the 
taxidermist, who also mounted a great many of them in excellent style for the exhi- 
bition series. Only part of the collection was received during October, though, for 
reasons detailed in the report for September, were first entered in the Museum register 
during the former month. Also 11 specimens of Bonaparte's Gull, Larus Philadelphia, 
from Wood's Holl, Massachusetts. 

From F. S. Webster, of Washington, District of Columbia : 6 specimens, 4 species of 
Humming-Birds, from South America, and a Crymophilus fulicarius, shot on the Eastern 
Branch, District of Columbia, October 17, 1886, received in exchange. 

From Hon. J. S. Wise, of Richmond, Virginia : A Loggerhead Shrike, Lanius ludo- 
vicianus. 

From Henry D. Woolfe, Coal Station, Alaska : 27 specimens, 17 species, from Cape 
Lisbourne, Alaska. 

From Don Jos6 C. Zeledon, of San Jose", Costa Rica : A specimen of a new species, 
Cotinga ridgivayi Zeledon, named in honor of the curator of this department, and one 
female Carpodectes antonice Zeled., a recently described and a very rare species, both 
from Costa Rica. 

From Fred. Zeller, of Washington, District of Columbia : A specimen of Quiscalus 
ameus from Prince Charles County, Maryland. 

From the Zoological Gardens, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, through the superin- 
tendent, Arthur E. Brown : A Brush Turkey, Talegalla lathami, in the flesh, and a 
Parakeet skin, Polytehs melanura. 

From the Zoological Museum, University of Christiania, Norway : 2 specimens, 2 
species, of birds from Jaj>an, one species new to the collection. 

The present state of the collection is excellent so far as that portion 
included in suitable receptacles is concerned, except that the drawers 
are very much overcrowded. A considerable portion, however, yet 
remain in old drawers which are without lids or other fastenings, 
and therefore exposed to the attacks of insects. By a liberal use of 
naphthaline, and constant watchfulness, however, damage has been 



100 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 



prevented to the reserve or study series, the few specimens which were 
injured belonging to the duplicate series. 

The exhibition collection is still in decidedly the most unsatisfactory 
condition of any portion of the collection, it being impossible to prevent 
injury to thespeciineus from insects and dust, both of which have free 
ingress to the old and in every respect unsuitable cases in which the 
collection is arranged. 

It has not been practicable to make an actual count of the specimens 
in the collection. In fact, it is the curator's opinion that this should 
only be done at intervals of several years (when it becomes necessary, 
on account of crowding, to re-arrange the collection) for the specimens 
suffer more or less deterioration from frequent handling. A careful es- 
timate, however, based on the inventory of the preceding year and the 
accessions for the one just closed, gives the following as the approxi. 
mate numbers of specimens in the reserve, exhibition, and duplicate 
series, and the total number in the collection.*

The papers published during the year by the curator and his official 
associates, and by collaborators upon Museum material, are noticed in 
the bibliography. 

*Of the 2,393 total additions during the year it is estimated that 2,000 went into 
the reserve series and 393 into the duplicate series. This would increase the latter 
to 8,143, were it not that the specimens distributed during the year (1,031) were taken 
from that series. 



REPORT ON THE SECTION OF BIRDS' EGGS IN THE U. S. NATIONAL 

MUSEUM, 1887, 



By Captain Charles E. Bendire, U. S. Army, Honorary Curator. 



My principal object during the year has been to fill as far as possible 
the existing gaps in the oological collection, and to increase the series 
of eggs, especially amongst the rarer species. In this I have been mod- 
erately successful. 

The largest and most important collection received during the past 
year is that made by Lieut. Harry G. Benson, Fourth Cavalry, in the 
vicinity of Fort Huackuca, Arizona, consisting of 22 species and 630- 
specimens, a valuable gift, as all the specimens are nicely prepared, 
and the majority of them very rare, and scarcely known in collections. 
I mention a few of the rarer species: Crvus coryptoleucus, 57 sets, 275 
specimens; Aphelocoma sieberii arizonw, 33 sets, 137 specimens and 
nest; Columba fasciata, 3 specimens; Buteo abbreviatus, 1 specimen; 
Psaltri-parus plumbeus, 9 sets, 41 specimens and nests. 

With the exception of the first-mentioned species these eggs have 
been represented in the collection by but a single specimen, and the 
last-named species was till now unknown. In making this collection 
Lieutenaut Benson has often ridden 40 miles a day, and he deserves a 
great deal of credit for the amount of work he has accomplished in a 
few weeks' collecting. 

Dr. A. K. Fisher, Department of Agriculture, presented 18 specimens, representing 
5 species, all of (hern rare, comprising the following: Spinus pinus, set of 4 eggs and 
nest ; Helminthophila pinus, set of 5 eggs and nest ; Empidonax fiaviventris, set of 4 
eggs. New to the collection. 

Col. N. S. Goss, Topeka, Kansas, gave a set of 2 eggs of Iciinia mississippiensis. 

From Capt. B. F. Goss, Pewaukee, Wisconsin, was received a set of 8 eggs and 
nest of JSegulus salrapa. 

Mr. H. W. Henshaw, Washington, District of Columbia, gave an egg of Ammodra- 
mus leldingi. New to the collection. 

From William Brewster, Cambridge, Massachusetts, came a set of 4 eggs of Junco 
hyemalis carolinensis. New to collection. He also contributed one set of 2 eggs of 
Pipilo erythrophihalmus alleni, and one set of 3 eggs of Helinaia sivainsoni with nests. 

From Lieut. G. M. Stoney, U. S. Navy, were received : One set of 3 eggs and nest of 
Seiurus noveboracensis notabilis. New to the collection. One set of 4 eggs and nest 
of Hesperociclila ncevia, and two sets of 4 eggs and nests of Branta canadensis minima.

102 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

Loren W. Green, of Baird, Shasta County, California, sent one set of 3 eggs of Me- 
lanerpes formicivorus, and two sets of 7 and 12 eggs of Oreortyx pictus. 

J. Parker Norris, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, gave one set of 2 eggs of Syrnium 
nebulosum alleni. New to the collection. 

During tbe year 85 nests have also been received, of which some of 
the rarer ones have been mentioned. 

The character of routine work for the fiscal year has been as follows : 
(a) The numbering, classifying, and arrangement of 1,208 new speci- 
mens ; (b) taking the measurements and records of 7,125 specimens, and 
(c) inountiDg, labeling, and arranging 235 species of the nests for ex- 
hibition, and (d) relabeling and classifying part of the reserve series of 
eggs according to the nomenclature of the American Ornithologists' 
Union Check List.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF REPTILES AND BATRACHTANS IN 
THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887, 



By H. C. Yarrow, M. T>., Honorary Curator. 



No special studies or investigations have been made by the curator 
or his assistant, their time having been taken up in attending to the 
general routine office work. The study of the Batrachia by Prof. E. D. 
Cope is elsewhere alluded to. 

Among the accessions received during the year was quite a valuable 
collection, containing 23 specimens, from Prof. Alfred Duges, of Mexico, 
comprising the principal forms of reptiles of that country. These speci- 
mens have not as yet been fully identified. 

A small but interesting collection of Corean serpents, including 7

Fannie Malone, Texas; G. M. Eliees, Mount Pleasant, District of Co- 
lumbia; F. Stephens, San Bernardino, California ; Mabel and Marga- 
ret Johnson, South Carolina ; Anton Schott, Akanchee Lake, Wiscon- 
sin ; Lieut. W. M. Wood, U. S. Navy, South America ; Thomas Flynn, 
Arizona; and a new species of snake (Tropidonotus bisectus Cope) from 
the Central Station of the U. S. Fish Commission in Washington. 

The routine work of the Reptile Department consists in entering in 
the record books all specimens on their arrival ; in identifying and la- 
beling them, when possible, and in placing them in the series to which 
they belong. 

An order was received during the year to move temporarily the De- 
partment of Eeptiles from the west basement of the Smithsonian build- 
ing, so that that part of the building might be renovated. The speci- 
mens were all carefully removed, and stored in cases temporarily erected 
in the basement hall of the main portion of the Institution. The cura- 
tor's office was removed to, and now occupies, the south-front room on 
the ground floor, in the brick building west of the Smithsonian. 

The only paper published by the curator during the year is entitled 
" Recurrence of Symptoms of Poisoning after Snake-bites." This is no- 
ticed in Section iv of the report. He has prepared a paper for il Wood's 
Reference Hand-book of the Medical Sciences," entitled "Poisonous Rep- 
tiles of the United States." Prof. E. D. Cope has been specially em- 
ployed by the Institution to prepare a report and description of the 
Batrachia of North America. The drawings and manuscript of the 
work are finished, and the work is nearly ready to go to press. 

PRESENT STATE OF THE COLLECTION. 

All of the reptile specimens are in excellent condition, but since they 
are stored away, as before mentioned, they are not as easy of access for 
study and comparison as formerly. 

There have been 130 entries made in the catalogue, comprising 503 
specimens. 

Specimens received during the year ending June 30, 1886 1,705 

Specimens received during the year ending June 30, 1887 503 

Specimens in reserve series 9,631 

Specimens in general series 8,819 

Exhibition series, domestic (selected for) 600 

Exhibition series, foreign (selected for) 150 

Unclassified and exotic specimens, probably 6, 134 

Total 27,542 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FISHES IN THE U. S, NATIONAL 

MUSEUM, 1887. 



By Tarleton H. Bean, M. D., Curator. 



GENERAL REVIEW OF THE YEAR'S WORK. 

Much time has been devoted to the identification of collections made 
in various parts of the world by correspondents of the Museum. This 
will be more particularly referred to in another part of this report. 

Until the month of October I was much occupied with editorial work 
upon Museum publications and upon the reports of collectors in the 
service of other bureaus of the Government. After this time I was re- 
lieved of this duty by Mr. A. Howard Clark. 

In preparing a sketch of the history of the collection of fishes.it be- 
came desirable to prepare a geographical list of the principal sources 
from which fishes were received from 1851-1886, and to make a census 
of the collection now in the possession of the Museum. It was found 
that the Museum now has upwards of 24,000 jars of fishes, besides 208 
tanks, 4 barrels, and a lot of stuffed skins, drawings, color sketches, and 
casts. The number of specimens in the collection must be not less than 
100,000, which is probably the greatest number possessed by any mu- 
seum in the world. 

Messrs. B. A. Bean and Peter Parker, jr., besides attending to their 
usual routine work, have been employed in adding to the bibliography 
of ichthyology with particular reference to deep sea species, and pre- 
paring copies of the original descriptions of species. In connection with 
this same work I have prepared a list of the deep-sea fishes, which is 
now almost completed. A comparison of the results of deep-sea explo- 
rations conducted by foreign Governments with those obtained by the 
United States Government reveals the fact that so far as the fishes are 
concerned we have brought to light more new forms than all the other 
Governments combined. 

The curator has prepared descriptions of new fishes from Mexico, re- 
ceived from Prof. A. Duges, and in connection with Mr. Goode has pub- 
lished a paper on new genera and species of deep-sea fishes collected 
by the steamer Blake. Work has also been continued upon other re- 
ports, which will be referred to under special researches.

106 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

Numerous important papers have been published by Prof. D. S. Jordan 
and his assistants, upon materials belonging to the Museum, and Prof. J. 
A. Byder has published many valuable embryological papers, which will 
be found noticed in the bibliography. 

The work has been continued upon the drawings of fishes by Mr. H. 
L. Todd and Mr. W. S. D. Haines. The character of the illustrations 
has been kept up to the high standard. 

During the latter portion of the year almost the entire collection of 
fishes was moved out of the exhibition halls, the tank-room, the corri- 
dors, and the ichthyological laborator}" at the expense of a considerable 
loss of time and the causing of more or less confusion.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FISHES. 109 

One hundred and eighteen drawings made by H. L. Todd and thirty- 
five drawings made by W. S. D. Haines were examined and accepted. 
An accurate census of the collection referred to elsewhere was made. 

The preparation of reports upon specimens sent to the Museum or to 
the Fish Commission for examination has become an important feature 
of the work of this department. 

SPECIAL RESEARCHES. 

In connection with Dr. G. Brown Goode a partial report was prepared 
upon the fishes of the Blake. Thirteen species and two genera 
were described in the Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, 
Yol. xn, Jul}' - , 1886. The curator described some new fishes sent from 
Mexico by Professor Duges. Other papers now in progress and well 
advanced are the following : (1) Eeport on the Fishes of Great South 
Bay, Long Island; (2) Eeport on the Fishes of Coznmel; (3) Synopsis 
of the Fishes of Alaska; (4) Synopsis of the Salmonidse of North 
America; (5) in connection with Dr. Goode, Report on the Deep-sea 
Fishes ; (6) with Dr. Goode, A Study of the Fishes of the Atlantic 
Basin. 

The curator was detailed by Professor Baird to make an investiga- 
tion of the spring mackerel fishery in the schooner Grampus. He ac- 
cordingly left Washington April 20, joined the vessel at Fortress Mon- 
roe, and cruised with the mackerel fleet until May 31, when the spring 
mackerel fishing was practically ended. He published letters de- 
scriptive of this cruise in the Boston Herald of May 9 and 26 and June 
6, and now has in preparation a more exhaustive report of the voyage 
for the Bulletin of the U. S. Fish Commission. 

The collections of the Museum have been utilized to a very large 
extent by collaborators not belonging to the Museum force. Professor 
Jordan and his assistants have published many extensive papers, which 
are mentioned in the bibliography.* 

Prof. J. A. Byder has also published important embryological memoirs, 
which are likewise included in the bibliography. 

A large number of specimens were at their request sent for study to 
collaborators of the Smithsonian Institution. 

THE PRESENT STATE OF THE COLLECTION. 

The present state of the collection is about the same as at the time 
of the last annual report, with the exception of some improvement in 
the condition of the specimens in jars aud some additional deteriora- 
tion in tanks. It will be found necessary for the safety of the tank 
specimens to transfer them as far as possible into large glass vessels. 
Eequisitions have been made for preserving material from time to time, 
but so far we have not been able to obtain a sufficient quantity. 

The first entry number in the catalogue in July, 1886, was 37894, and 

*See Section IV of this report. 



110 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

the last entry in June, 1887, was 39118, making the number of entries 
for the year 1,225. 

NUMBER OF SPECIMENS IN THE COLLECTION-. 

Exhibition 34,000 

Reserve 41,000 

Duplicate ; 25,000 

Total '. 100,000 

In February, 1887, the total number of jars containing fishes, by 
actual count, was 24,069. This number has been increased by acces- 
sions since received. There were at that time 208 tanks and 4 barrels 
filled with fishes. There were exhibited in the fish hall 64 stuffed fishes. 
The total number of casts at that time was 1,086, of which 276 were 
exhibited, 315 duplicates and stored, and 190 moulds, which had not 
yet been utilized. 

The number of drawings at that time was 1,354. There is also a 
large collection of photographs and color sketches, to which I have not 
yet obtained access. There is a large number of wood-cuts, 281 of 
which are stored in the fish hall and about twice as many in the wood- 
cut room. 

A census of the types of species was made in February, when it was 
found that the Museum possesses 364 described in outside publications 
prior to the foundation of the Proceedings of the National Museum, 
and 549 which have been described in the Proceedings, 150 of these 
being deep-sea species and 399 fresh- and shoal- water species. To this 
number should be added a great many extra-limital species, principally 
described by Dr. Gill, and a large number of types of West Indian 
fishes described and contributed by Prof. Felipe Poey. 

In 1871 the National Museum had more specimens in the collection 
of fishes than the British Museum, but they represented a smaller num- 
ber of species. The British Museum at that time had 5,177 species, 
represented by 29,275 specimens. 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF MOLLUSKS (INCLUDING CENOZOIC IN- 
VERTEBRATE FOSSILS) IN THE U. S, NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 



By W. H. Dall, Honorary Curator. 



The force of the Department of Mollusks beside the curator has con- 
sisted of Dr. E. E. C. Stearns, adjunct curator ; Miss Agnes Nicholson, 
clerk (to February, 1887); Mr. Pierre Louis Jouy, aid (since February, 
1887). 

Assistance has also been rendered from time to time, by permission 
of the Director of the U. S. Geological Survey, by Messrs. E. Stuart, 
Frank Burns, and E. T. Hill, of the Geological Survey, chiefly in con- 
nection with the Tertiary fossils contributed by the Survey to the 
Museum. 

The work, as during the past years, has chiefly consisted in the clas- 
sification and preparation of material received during the year and left 
over from previous years. By the faithfulness and industry of those 
employed upon the work, good progress has been made, and with sim- 
ilar success during the next two or three years we may hope to see the 
last of eleven years' arrearages (to 1884) finally administered upon. 

This once accomplished it will be a comparatively easy task to keep 
up with the annual accessions except in very unusual cases. 

As there is no logical or biological reason for separating the Tertiary 
fossils from the recent shells in general administration (though the 
specimens may be kept in separate cases for convenience of reference), 
no separation has been made, and this report therefore is practically a 
report on the Department of Tertiary Invertebrate Fossils as well as of 
the Department of Mollusks. 

A biological arrangement has been adopted in arranging the fossils, 
the distinctions of supposed age being retained only on the labels. 
The result of this is to bring together all the species of any one genus 
from the Eocene to the Post Pliocene, and, in the writer's opinion, a 
study of the collection thus arranged is likely to reduce by two-thirds 
the number of nominal species now on our lists of Tertiary fossils of 
the United States. 

The general collection is divided into three principal geographical 
series with two subordinate groups, all being biologically arranged. 
Thus we have the species of West America from the Arctic province 

ill 



112 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

to Cape Horn, the species of East America, and the general collection 
of exotic species. In the latter we have two subordinate divisions 
which are contained in one room with the East American series, but 
independently arranged. These are (1) the Jeffreys collection of North 
Atlantic, North European, and British shells, and (2) the collection of 
Arctic marine shells from all parts of the Polar basin and adjacent 
waters. Among the land shells of North America, a case is devoted 
to the types of Binney, and in the same way, when received and ar- 
ranged, the Lea collection of Unionidse and other fresh- water types will 
form a special series. 

In this connection it is my sad duty to refer to the death, December 
8, 1886, of Dr. Isaac Lea, for many years the oldest living American 
student of mollusks, and known all over the world for his researches on 
the Naiades, especially of North America. Dr. Lea had been a valued 
correspondent and friend of the Museum from its earliest stages, and 
had given large numbers of valuable specimens to the collection. In 
his will, subject to certain reasonable conditions, he left his entire col- 
lection of Mollusca to the Museum, which, when received and arranged, 
will put the Department of Mollusks, in the matter of Naiades, far in 
advance of any other existing biological museum. 

The administration on our material is progressing so rapidly that it 
already exceeds our case room. I shall therefore be obliged to make 
requisition for some eight new cases with their accompanying drawers, 
etc., to accommodate the general exotic series. 

The few persons available for work on the collection of mollusks, re- 
cent and fossil, have been engaged with the greatest assiduity in the 
labor above described, so that comparatively little work has been possi- 
ble on the large and valuable collection of cephalopods and other mol- 
lusks in alcohol. They have been examined, however, to determine their 
safety, and a card catalogue of the collection begun, to be taken up as 
occasion serves. Though not available for certain sorts of work, the 
alcoholic specimens afford opportunity for determining with certainty 
many points of prime importance in classification ; as in one case during 
the past year in the matter of the gills of Necera ( = Cuspidaria) this ma- 
terial enabled the remarkable fact to be determined that specialized 
gills of the ordinary form are entirely absent, thus rendering necessary 
the revision of the definition of the entire class and even the final rejec- 
tion of one of the most commonly received class appellations. The im- 
possibility of getting rare exotic material in a living condition will always 
give to a well-preserved alcoholic collection a certain importance. 

The full list of accessions to this department will be found by refer- 
ence to Section v of the report, and includes seventy-five numbers. 

Among the more important of these are the series of deep sea mol- 
lusks dredged by the Coast Survey steamer Blalce, types of the report 
on the mollusks of the Blalce expedition by the curator, presented 
by Prof. Alexander Agassiz; thirty-two species of Scalaria and allied

groups from the Tertiary of France, obtained in exchange from M. E. 
de Boury; four hundred species of Pliocene fossils, and many species 
from older rocks, with a large collection of mollusks obtained by the 
curator during field-work in south Florida under the auspices of the U. 
S. Geological Survey ; a small collection, representing eight species 
from Bennett Island in the Polar Sea, collected during the Jeannette 
expedition and presented by E. L. Newcomb, naturalist of the expe- 
dition ; twenty specimens from Enoshima Island, Japan, presented by 
Mr. P. L. Jouy, containing some very acceptable rarities ; seventy-six 
species of Mexican shells, presented by the Mexican Geological Com- 
mission j some interesting fresh-water shells, from H. A. Pilsbry ; a 
valuable series of specimens dredged in the Gulf of Mexico and the 
Bahamas, partly in very deep water, and presented by Dr. W. H. 
Bush, U. S. Navy ; a small but interesting collection of shells from 
South America, and pelagic mollusks, from W. E. Safford, U. S. Navy ; 
a number of acceptable species from the southern coast of the United 
States and Honduras, presented by Charles T. Simpson ; eleven boxes 
of fossils aud rocks containing fossils, from the U. S. Geological Sur- 
vey, through W. H. Dall ; and eighty-four very beautifully preserved 
species of land and fresh-water shells of the Southern United States, 
by A. G. Wetherby, of Boan Mountain, North Carolina. Contrary to 
our usual experience, nothing of importance has been received from 
the U. S. Fish Commission during the year. 

The work of the past year was chiefly devoted to the administration 
upon the marine forms of West America, the preliminary arrangement 
of which has been completed; to the unpacking and arrangement of 
the Indo Pacific series of the Stearns collection ; the selection and ar- 
rangement of the Floridian Tertiary and the general East American 
series ; preparation of material for exchanges chiefly in favor of other 
departments of the Museum ; and the assistance of students and cor- 
respondents desiring names of species or other information of use in 
their studies. A report was made and printed on the Blake brachio- 
pods and pelecypods, which is more fully described in the list of pub. 
lications appended to this report. A collection brought by the Mexi- 
can Geographical Commission was named for them, and will serve as a 
basis for future study to the conchologists of Mexico. 

Information or assistance of more or less importance, involving the 
writing of letters to the number of some 350, was furnished by the De- 
partment of Mollusks to the following persons :

SPECIAL RESEARCHES. 

In the flood of routine work an occasional rest was taken for study, 
and investigations prosecuted by the curator. 

1. On the mollusks of the Blake collection, of which the brachiopods 
and pelecypods were completed and published ; 2. On the fossils of the 
later Tertiary of south Florida, still in progress; 3. On a small collec- 
tion of fragments, etc., obtained by the Jeannette expedition at Bennett 
Island in the Polar Sea; 4. On the general Floridian and Gulf fauna, 
still in progress; 5. On the geology of south Florida, in press; and 
on several Arctic or sub -Arctic collections made by Mr. L. M. Turner 
in Labrador, Mr. Nicholas Grebnitzki in Bering Sea, and by the cura- 
tor in several parts of northern Alaska. The papers printed are enu- 
merated in the list appended to this report. Dr. Stearns, the assistant 
curator, has devoted some time to the study of the fossil Tryonia. a 
small genus of the Amnicola group; of Teredo ; and of the Phoridce, or 
Carrier shells. 

Mr. Paul Pelseneer, of the Museum at Brussels, having taken up the 
study of the pteropods, applied for certain material to be used in his 
studies. This, consisting chiefly of specimens of Pacific and other 
pteropods and copies of colored drawings made from life while in the 
North Pacific by the curator, was furnished to the Museum of Brussels 
for his use. 

A preliminary paper describes a new genus found off the eastern 
coast of the United States by the IT. S. Fish Commission steamer Alba- 
tross, and further publications may be expected. 

In previous reports I have shown why it is impossible to state the 
exact number of specimens, species, duplicates, etc., contained in the 
collection. Two years ago the collection was estimated to contain 
400,000 specimens. Since then not less than 25,000 specimens have 
been added to it. It will be several years before an exact statement 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF MOLLUSKS.

can be made as to any of these details; certainly not before all arrear- 
ages are cleared up. 

For the year 1885-'86 the number of entries in the Museum register, 
being the final culmination of some two years' preparatory work, was 
18,638, representing between 50,000 and 60,000 individual specimens. 
A larger number of specimens has been handled during the past year, 
but owing to a deficiency of clerical assistance not so many of them 
have reached the final stage of registration. 

The following table shows the state of the register, sundry gaps being 
due to the allotment of numbers to the Fish Commission for the use of 
Professor Verrill and his assistants :

The total number of entries for 1886-'87 is 10,530, equivalent to about 
32,000 specimens, each lot registered averaging over 3 specimens. 
Adding this to the total for the preceding year, we get 29,163 entries, 
while in the twenty years previous to July, 1885, the whole number of 
entries was only 42,440, or less than one and one-half times as many as 
have been registered during the last two years. These figures show 
better than any lengthy explanation how the work has been pressed. 
It may also be observed that, whereas in former days many specimens 
were entered merely under the generic name or without any name, the 
present entries are nearly all identified and fully administered upon. 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF INSECTS IN THE U. S. NATIONAL 

MUSEUM, 1887. 



By C. V. Riley, Honorary Curator. 



The general work of the year was mainly that of arrangement, as by 
far the greatest amount of time has been devoted to the separation of 
material, and its more or less complete arrangement either for exhibi- 
tion or study. 

First in order, the arrangement of the Lepidoptera from the Bhopalo- 
cera to the end of the Arctiidce has been completed. This had been 
begun during the preceding year and nearly completed. The work this 
year embraced the addition of new material, the completion and partial 
re-arrangement of series, and such changes as experience suggested. A 
tolerably complete statement of this part of the work is contained in 
last year's report, and nothing more need be said here on the same 
subject. 

A more tedious, and in many respects more important, work was the 
separation into families of the material in the order Diptera. 

There was in the order the material of the Burgess collection, much 
of it without labels, and most all of it without arrangement of any kind 5 
the material in the Belfrage collection in somewhat similar condition ; 
the material of the Biley collection and that of the Department of 
Agriculture containing a vast lot of bred species ; the Biley collection 
being the only one with any attempt at arrangement. The work of Dr. 
Williston, in the winter of 1885, on this collection included the separa- 
tion and arrangement of some of the leading families, and these served 
as a guide and basis for the continuation of the work. 

There are now 107 boxes of material arranged as to families, much of 
it determined generically or specifically; the boxes of all sizes, many of 
them large, double storage cases. 

A series of eight unit boxes was prepared, containing a synoptic col- 
lection of North American Coleoptera, with labels defining and draw- 
ings illustrating the families of this order. A more detailed statement 
of this work is given further on. 

The collection of Arachnidce has been overhauled, partly remounted, 
and roughly separated for convenience of future study. The old ma- 
terial in adolescent stages has been similarly treated.

118 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

A lot of typical Myriapoda, received from Mr. Eathbun, the curator 
of Marine Invertebrates, has been carefully preserved and arranged. 

A lot of slides containing parts of insects and many minute species, 
also from Mr. Eathbun, were carefully listed and arranged for ready 
reference. 

The Heteroptera had been arranged by Prof. H. Osborn, as detailed 
in the last report, but the duplicate material had neither been labeled 
nor entirely separated ; this unfinished work on the suborder was also 
done during the year. 

The Capsidce, one of the families of this order, was sent to Prof. P. E. 
Uhler, of Baltimore, for study, at his request. 

The collection of Orthoptera had already been carefully arranged by 
Mr. Lawrence Bruner while associated with me at the Department of 
Agriculture, in 1884, in a series of single and double folding boxes; 
but in order to assist in the preparation of a monograph of the Acrididw, 
which I have planned with Mr. Bruner, the whole order has been trans- 
ferred to permanent cabinets. This re-arrangement has permitted the 
incorporation of the new material that has accumulated since 1884, and 
has placed the collection in far better condition both in regard to safety 
from breakage and to facility for study. In the re-arrangement a dupli- 
cate series was also prepared for the Department of Agriculture to facili- 
tate reference work there. 

Eeports on accessions often require considerable study and time, and 
the correspondence of the department has been extensive. 

A considerable amount of time was occupied in determinations for 
such entomologists as either sent specimens for the department or who 
had in some way deserved well of the Museum, and for institutions 
where the determinations would be valued and valuable. 

Some twenty such lots were named in addition to those which were 
reported upon as accessions in the regular manner. 

During the year two additional standard cabinets of the kind de- 
scribed in my previous report have been made. These are of cherry 
and mahogany, and superior to those previously received. 

One hundred of the standard single folding boxes were also ordered 
and received. 

The Smith collection is contained in one large walnut cabinet of sixty 
drawers ; a small pine cabinet of nine drawers ; 80 single folding boxes; 
27 pine double folding boxes ; 17 very large walnut double folding boxes, 
and a miscellaneous lot of over 100 boxes of all sizes and shapes. Two 
unit table cases were also assigned to the department. 

A very fair proportion of the boxes received are already in use, and 
they are being rapidly filled as arrangement of material progresses. 

The preparation of papers for publication, as a direct result of the 
Museum work, has occupied, compared with the other work, but a small 
part of the time. It is chiefly represented by the paper by Mr. Smith 
on the classification of some of the Boinbycina in the Proceedings of 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OP INSECTS. 119 

the Museum, and hereafter more particularly mentioned, and of a few 
contributions by myself. 

Based largely upon Museum material, and almost entirely upon ma- 
terial which will, I hope, ultimately become the property of the Museum, 
is the " Synopsis of the North American Syrphidw," by Dr. S. W. Willis- 
ton, published as Bulletin No. 31 of the U. S. National Museum. 

This is the most valuable contribution to systematic dipterology in 
North America that has appeared in recent years. 

NOTES. 

In considering the more important accessions during the year, I have 
drawn attention to a few of those which have come through the ordinary 
channels with their accession numbers ; but by far the greater num- 
ber of important accessions to the collection have come (1) through 
the curator in the shape of material constantly received by him or col- 
lected during his travels, and which on account of their numbers and 
frequency are added to the general collection without accession num- 
bers ; (2) those received through the Department of Agriculture from 
the correspondents and agents of its entomological division. By far 
the most important of these last is the material that has been collected 
by Mr. Albert Koebele in California, which comprises many thousand 
specimens in all orders, much of which is exceedingly valuable material. 
Again, Mr. E. A. Schwarz, of said entomological division^ very kindly 
donated some 300 specimens of the 108 species of Coleoptera which 
were required to complete the synoptic collection in that order which 
were either not represented in the collection or were represented in in- 
sufficient numbers. 

Of the accessions by purchase, only one has been made during the 
year, but that is an important and valuable one, viz, the private collec- 
tion of the assistant curator, Mr. J. B. Smith. 

Of the numbered accessions direct to the Museum, the following may 
be mentioned as of special interest : 

July, 1886. — Several specimens of JEpicauta maeulata from Capt. Henry Romeyn, Fifth 
U. S. Infantry, Fort Keogh, Montana. (177430 These insects were said to have ap- 
peared suddenly in great numbers, and proved very destructive to vegetables, creating 
some alarm. Later Captain Romeyn wrote that Pyreihrum proved a complete remedy. 

Specimen of the work of Scolytus unispinosus in Abies douglassi from L. E. Ricksecker, 
SylvaDia, California, through J. B. Smith. (17767.) This specimen was interesting 
as presenting the first known instance of a true Scolytus boring in conifers. 

August, 1886. — Twenty one specimens of fourteen species of Lepidoptera from Mis- 
souri, from Miss M. E. Murtfeldt, Kirkwood, Missouri. The species- were undetermined, 
and many of them proved interesting. (17848.) 

September, 1886. — Six packages of Lepidoptera and two vials of miscellaneous insects, 
from C. J. Herring, colony of Surinam, Dutch Guiana. (17929.) 

The Lepidoptera were mostly fragmentary and so badly infested with Anthreni that 
they could not be saved and were destroyed. It was with great regret that this was 
done, for several of the species would have beeu desirable. The vials contained a few 
larvae and some Orthoptera of much less value. 



120 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

October, 1886. — One specimen, Carabus truncaticollis, from S. Applegate, sergeant, 
Signal Corps, Unalaska. C18036.) In point of value the most important accession of 
the month, as it is rather a rarity. 

Thirty-one specimens of twenty-six species of Lepidoptera from northern New York, 
from George H. Hudson, Plattsburgh, New York. (18077.) This lot contained some 
good species, very useful to the Museum. A complete list was sent Mr. Hudson. 

Nest of Vespa maculata, Mount Vernon, Virginia, from J. H. Kuehling, 419 Twelfth 
street northwest, Washington, D. C. (18081.) A very fine, large example, contain- 
ing numerous inhabitants. 

Thirty-one specimens of Lepidoptera in papers from Dr. J. C. Merrill, U. S. Army, 
Fort Klamath, Oregon. (18147. J A few of these were good species and of value to 
our collections. A complete list was sent Dr. Merrill at his request. 

Twenty-eight species of Lepidoptera and three of Coleoptera from George H. Hud- 
son, Plattsburgh, New York. (18148.) A list of determinations was sent to Mr. Hud- 
son. 

November, 1886. — Twenty-seven vials containing as many named species of Myri- 
pods, from C. H. Bollman, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana. (17905.) 
Contained a large proportion of forms heretofore unrepresented in the Museum col- 
lections. 

A lot of named Acrididce, four of them types of new species, from C. H. Bollman, 
Bloomington, Indiana. (18261.) These insects were badly damaged when they 
reached the department, but as they were of considerable value as typical of notes 
and descriptions by Mr. Bollman, they were carefully repaired and remounted in part. 

January, 1887. — Two vials of insects in alcohol from the head of Usamasinta River, 
Mexico, from Richard M. Walker, Commision de limites con Mexico, Guatemala City, 
Central Mexico. (18478.) A mixed lot of species, some of them very bright and at- 
tractive. A desirable addition to a popular exhibition. 

Smerinthus pallidulus, 1 ; Pamphila, sp. ?, 1 ; and an undetermined Geometrid, 1, from 
W. N. Tallant, 73 Jefferson avenue, Columbus, Ohio. (18507.) All of these speci- 
mens not in our collection and rare. 

A lot of Myriapoda from Prof. L. M. Underwood, Syracuse, New York. (18494.) 
This is part of the material sent Professor Underwood for study and arrangement and 
now returned. It includes only the Chilopoda and the genera allied to Scolopendra. 

A lot of named Coleoptera and Lepidoptera from James Fletcher, Ottawa, Canada. 
(18510.) Among the Lepidoptera were type specimens of Chionobas macounii and Ne- 
meopMla seliuynii, as well as other good species. There were also a lot of Coleoptera, 
Lepidoptera, and Orthoptera for determination, and a list of these, so far as readily 
namable, was sent Mr. Fletcher. 

Fifty specimens of thirty-nine species of Hemiptera, not in our collection, from 
William H. Ashmead, Jacksonville, Florida. (18550.) These were obtained from 
Mr. Ashmead in exchange for others to be sent him from the Museum. 

Eleven type species of Myriapoda, Michigan-Indiana, from C. H. Bollman, Indiana 
University, Bloomington, Indiana. (18529.) These types accompanying a paper 
sent for publication in the Proceedings of the Museum. 

February, 1887. — Three trap-door spiders and one nest of same from Prof. George F. 
Atkinson, Chapel Hill, North Carolina. (18678.) The species are typical specimens 
of Pachylomerus carabivorus Atk. and nest, MyrmeMaphila foliata Atk., and Nidival- 
vata marxii Atk. 

March, 1887. — A lot of insects from Alaska, from Lieut. George M. Stoney, U. S. 
Navy, collected by Dr. Nash of the expedition. (18491.) 

A list of the species contained in this collection was made and handed Dr. Nash. 
It contained: Coleoptera, 9 species, 30 specimens; Lepidoptera, 6 species, 18 speci- 
mens; Diptera, 4 species, numerous specimens; Orthoptera, 1 species, 1 specimen; 
Neuroptera, 4 species, numerous specimens ; Arachnida, 12 species, 35 specimens ; 
Myriapoda, 1 species, 1 specimen. 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF INSECTS. 121 

Ten specimens of a new species of Cis from William H. Crane, Cincinnati, Ohio. 
(18842.) 

April, 1887. — Nest of Vespa maculata from Hon. Wade Hampton, United States 
Senate. (18886.) A fine specimen and one of the largest we have. 

Pityophthorus rhois Sz. and sample of work ; Thysanoes ficus Sz. in all stages and 
samples of work, and parasites; Anisomorpha buprestoides; Penthetria sp. and co- 
coon, and Forficula sp. and eggs from E. A. Schwarz, Washington, District of Co- 
lumbia, collected in Key West, Florida. (18954.) These Coleoptera are types of 
manuscript species by Mr. Schwarz, and have been unknown as to life, history, etc., 
heretofore. 

May, 1887. — Two boxes pinned Lepidoptera ; specimen of twigs of fig, with Pityoph- 
thorus ficus Sz. in all stages; three small vials of Myriapods. (19040.) 

Box of pinned Diptera and two vials of Myriapods. (19068.) 

Box of specimens, all orders, pinned. (19113.) 

All these are from Dade County, Florida, collected by Mr. Schwarz personally. 
They are mostly of great interest, many of them new species, and to some of them 
Mr. Schwarz has notes of interest and value. 

A lot of butterflies in papers, and a mixed lot of several orders in alcohol, United 
States of Colombia, from V. O. King, consul-general of the United States at Bogota. 
(19112.) These have been mounted and are in very good condition throughout. They 
form a bright and sparkling addition to the collection, the butterflies and beetles 
being usually the most brilliant. 

June, 1887. — A lot of dry Coleoptera in papers from Aurelius Todd, Elkhead, Ore- 
gon. (19015.) 

A similar lot from Lewis L. Kennedy, Blackford, Custer County, Montana. (19227.) 

Two mixed lots containing considerable valuable material apparently. 

1 box of White Mountain Coleoptera, from Rev. F. Gardiner, jr., Sioux Falls, Dakota. 
(188^0.) Chiefly valuable because it has been worked over by Dr. Leconte; unfortu- 
nately in such poor condition that but a small fraction can be saved. 

Two boxes of pinned insects (miscellaneous lot), from E. A. Schwarz, collected in 
Dade County, Florida. (19234.) 

Altogether 102 accessions have been sent in to the department, comprising several 
thousands of specimens. 

The mounting, labeling, and proper placing of these specimens occu- 
pied no inconsiderable time. Forty-eight of these accessions required 
reports of some kind, often taking up considerable time in making the 
necessary determinations ; some sendings involving the determinations 
of from 50 to 75 species, or a few of them even a greater number. 

In the first part of this report a general statement of the work done 
was given, and it needs but little amplification. In the Lepidoptera the 
chief work was the re-arrangement of the species of Callimorpha. 

In the Diptera the work has been entirely in the way of temporary 
arrangement. 

In the Coleoptera the principal work has been in the arrangement of 
the synoptic collection for exhibition. This has been most carefully 
arranged by Mr. Smith. Every family is defined, in almost every case 
there are drawings of structural peculiarities of the family, and wher- 
ever it was possible to obtain them, specimens of the leading genera in 
each family. In those cases where the species were very minute, figures 
of the species were either added or substituted. The eight unit cases 
in which this collection is arranged contain 571 species, 2,410 speci- 



122 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

mens, and 237 drawings, most of them made for this series, and many 
of them original. 

The Arachnida were still mostly contained in jars and vials of all 
kinds and sizes, and the species were sadly mixed. They have all been 
assorted, and placed in the standard vials adopted by the curator. The 
material in the adolescent stages of insects was in somewhat similar 
condition and was similarly treated. 

Several small lots of named Myriapods received, as noted in the list 
of accessions, were also mounted and temporarily arranged. In this 
class the Museum collection has an unusual number of types. 

During a portion of the summer Mr. A. S. Davis, of Mount Pleasant, 
served as a volunteer in the department, and with his aid a large lot of 
material previously mounted was labeled and separated and the balance 
of the old material was mounted. 

Mr. W. H. Crane, of Cincinnati, also served in the department for a 
short time this year, and his aid was effective in the arrangement of 
the Diptera and in the synoptic collection of Coleoptera. 

The Orthoptera were arranged in two cabinets, occupying forty 
drawers in all. Of some groups drawings, illustrating specific distinc- 
tions, were made and pinned into the collection with the species. 

Prof. P. E. Uhler has been for some time studying the Capsidse 
(Hemiptera Heteroptera) of the United States, and offered to arrange 
and name the Museum material in the family. 

The material was therefore carefully looked out and sent to Professor 
Uhler, who finds many new and interesting forms. Some of these he 
has referred to in describing new species in Entomologica Americana, 
but none have as yet been returned by him. 

So far as the more pressing work would allow, progress has been 
made in the studies of the Noctuidae in furtherance of the monograph 
in preparation by myself and Mr. J. B. Smith. The latter has also 
made a study of the material in the lepidopterous family Saturniidse, 
and the results are published in the Proceedings of the U. S. National 
Museum, 1886. He has also studied the lepidopterous genus Calli- 
morpha, and the results are embodied in a paper presented for publica- 
ing in the Proceedings for 1887, but not yet issued. The genus Euery- 
thra was also studied in the same way and a paper prepared and pre- 
sented, but not yet published. 

These papers contain many new facts of interest in structural Lepi- 
dopterology that have resulted from a careful study of the material ; 
but the conclusions, especially in the Callimorpha and Uuerythra pa- 
pers, sometimes run counter to my own convictions and to the facts 
from the biologic side. 

The curator's researches, so far as they are indicated by publication, 
have been as heretofore mostly in connection with his work for the 
Department of Agriculture, and are indicated in the bibliography.*

Dr. Williston's work of the Syrphidce has been already referred to. 

In the report for ]885-'86 a statement was presented giving as nearly 
as possible the state of the collection at that time. Its condition is 
more satisfactory at the present time, by virtue of the material that 
has been more carefully arranged and worked over during the year. 
Exclusive of the Smith collection at least 10,000 specimens have been 
added. 

To the exhibition series has been added the synoptic collection of 
Ooleoptera, contained in 8 unit cases, containing — species, 571; speci- 
mens, 2,410; drawings, 237, making a total in the exhibition series of — 
species, '2,637 ; specimens, 7,878; drawings not counted. 

In the study series the arranged collection of Orthoptera now con- 
tains 542 species, comprising 4,442 specimens. The species are divided 
as follows :

These numbers in regard to species may not prove exact, as so many 
are still either unnamed or entirely undescribed, and until they are care- 
fully worked over the specific or other rank of some forms can not be 
defiinitely determined. 

There are also twenty-seven double boxes, containing several thou- 
sands of duplicates for exchange. 

In the parasitic Hymenoptera the Microgasters have all been re 
arranged so as to include all the new and many undescribed species, 
which I hope soon to find time to define ; while in the biologic series, 
much of the alcoholic material has been brought together by families, 
especially that in the Noctuidae, and all in the Khopalocera has been 
brought together and classified. In the Coleoptera I have also begun, 
with Mr. E. A. Schwarz, the classification and study of the accumulated 
biologic specimens. 

The last catalogue entry for June, 1886, was 242, and the last cata- 
logue entry for June, 1887, is 343. 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF MARINE INVERTEBRATES IN THE 
U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 



By Eichard Eathbun, Curator. 



Most attention has been paid during- the past year to the working up 
of the collection of Corals, Star-fishes, and parasitic Copepods, and to 
the sorting, cataloguing, and preservation of specimens. Several re- 
ports upon the groups mentioned, mainly of the nature of annotated 
catalogues, have been completed and submitted for publication in the 
Proceedings. No increase has been made in the number of specimens 
on exhibition, but much material has been prepared for the display se- 
ries, and will be mounted as soon as opportunity offers. 

The number of accessions has been rather above the average ; and, 
as during many previous years, the Fish Commission has made the 
largest and most important contributions. Very valuable collections of 
Bermuda corals and sponges have been received from the Wesleyan 
University, and donations from the naval service have been numer- 
ous and interesting. The Fish Commission steamer Albatross was in 
active service only during the summer and fall, so that her regular 
southern cruises, which have always yielded very important results for 
this department, were omitted. Much progress has been made in the 
permanent arrangement of the general reserve collections, and many 
duplicates have been distributed to institutions of learning throughout 
the country. The card or reference catalogue of the identified speci- 
mens has been kept up to date, and now covers a large part of the col- 
lections. 

The work-rooms of this department were closed from the first of July 
until the last of October, the curator and his assistants taking part in 
the investigations of the Fish Commission at Wood's Holl, Massachu- 
setts, during that period. 

Fifty-five accessions have been received by this department during 
the year. The largest and most important of these comprised the in- 
vertebrate collections made by the Fish Commission steamer Albatross 
during the summer and fall months, with headquarters at Wood's 
Holl, Massachusetts. Over 1,200 packages, many of which were of 
large size, and contained a great variety of specimens, were sen t to 
Washington in October, as a partial result of the season's explorations,

nearly as many more having been placed in the hands of naturalists 
elsewhere for special study. The regular winter and spring cruises of 
the Albatross were unfortunately omitted, for reasons explained below, 
and the Museum was thereby deprived of the source of revenue from 
southern waters, which had so greatly enriched its collections during 
the previous three years. A small amount of material was, however, 
obtained by this steamer from the shallow water off Fortress Monroe, 
Virginia, in April, while giving instructions in dredging to the officers 
of the U. S. S. Thetis. 

The Fish Commission schooner Grampus has secured and transmitted 
to the Museum, in the course of its special fishery investigations in 
different regions, a large number of interesting specimens, including a 
fine series of surface towings taken on the southern mackerel grounds 
during April and May, to illustrate the food of that important econo- 
mic species. Several collections, made in the vicinity of Wood's Holl, 
Massachusetts, during the winter and spring, have been received from 
Mr. Yinal N. Edwards. They were especially rich in specimens of fish 
parasites. Mr. S. B. Meek, who was in the employ of the Commission 
in the summer and fall, has also supplied a number of interesting lots 
of specimens of the same character, obtained from the many varieties 
of. fish that are brought to Fulton market in a fresh condition during 
those seasons. Mr. John Marshall, captain of the Gloucester fishing 
schooner Landseer, has presented, through the Fish Commission, a small 
but interesting series of Iceland crustaceans, mostly fish parasites, ob- 
tained from the shark fishermen of that region. 

To officers of the United States Navy this department is indebted for 
several valuable contributions. Lieut. J. F. Moser, in command of the 
Coast Survey steamer BlaTce, has forwarded a large tank of alcoholic 
preparations, dredged in depths of 10 to 20 feet of water, in the neigh- 
borhood of Cedar Keys, Florida. Ensign W. E. Safford, formerly at- 
tached to the National Museum and Fish Commission, and now of the 
TJ. S. S. Mohican, has recently sent from San Francisco, California, an in- 
teresting assortment of specimens, mostly secured at the surface of the 
water by means of the tow-net, from off the Bio de la Plata, the South 
Pacific Ocean, and the western coast of America. Collections have also 
been received from Lieut. Commander H. E. Nichols, of the U. S. S. Pinta, 
obtained in southern Alaska ; from Dr. N. McP. Ferebee, of the U. S. S. 
Trenton, obtained in Corea and China ; and from Lieut. William C. Bab- 
cock, of the U. S. S. Hartford, obtained at Payta, Peru. Signal- Service 
observers Henry D. Woolfe and S. Applegate have supplied small col- 
lections from the northern and central Alaskan coasts. 

The largest and most important accession of the year, next to that fur- 
nished by the Fish Commission, has been received from the Wesleyan 
University, Middletown, Connecticut. It comprises a portion of the ex- 
tensive collection madeatthe Bermudas in 1877forthat institution by Dr. 
G. Brown Goode, and consists of 484 specimens of sponges and 266 speci- 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF INVERTEBRATES. 127 

mens of corals. They were sent in exchange for duplicates in the Na- 
tional Museum. The sponges include only the dried preparations of the 
larger and commoner species, identified by Prof. Alpheus Hyatt, of Bos- 
ton, Massachusetts, who has not yet concluded his studies upon the rarer 
ones. Future installments of the same collection are promised at an early 
date. The following species are represented by numerous varieties: 
Tuba vaginalis, Hircinia eampana, Spongia tubulifera, Spongia punc- 
tata, Verongia Jistularis. The corals belong to the following genera : 
Oculina, Madracis, Mycedium, Meandrina, Diploria, Isophyllia, Porites, 
Gorgonia, and Millepora. A small lot of corals, comprising about 20 
species, from the South Pacific Ocean and the West Indies, has also 
been received from Oberlin College, in exchange, and the Museum of 
Comparative Zoology, at Harvard College, has donated 5 species of 
Stylaster from the dredgings of the Coast Survey steamer Blake, to be 
used in the identification of Albatross collections. 

Mr. P. L. Jouy, lately of Seoul, Corea, and now an assistant in the 
Museum, has contributed an interesting series of Crustaceans, Echino- 
derms, Corals, and Sponges, including several nearly perfect specimens 
of Hyalonema, from Corea and Japan. Mr. C. H. Townsend, who has 
been collecting for the Museum off Swan Island, in the Caribbean Sea, 
during the past spring, has already forwarded many finely preserved 
specimens of Crustaceans, Corals, and Echinoderms, and additional ma- 
terials of the same character are expected from him. The following 
donations are also deserving of special mention : Mr. W. H. Dall, a 
small collection of Crustaceans, Eadiates, Ascidians, and Sponges from 
Charlotte Harbor, Florida ; Prof. A. Duges, marine and fresh-water 
specimens from Mexico ; Mr. S. F. Cheney, miscellaneous marine speci- 
mens from Grand Manan, New Brunswick ; Mr. W. E. Curtis, through 
the Bureau of Ethnology, specimens of Echinoderms, Corals, and Barna- 
cles from Peru ; and Mr. S. Kneeland, also through the same Bureau, 
a fine specimen of Hyalonema, from Enoshima, Japan. 

As in previous years, the curator and his assistants participated in 
the summer explorations of the Fish Commission at Wood's Holl, Mas- 
sachusetts, leaving Washington July 4, and returning about the middle 
of October. During that period work was entirely suspended in this 
department in Washington, but was actively continued at Wood's Holl. 
The duties there comprised the sorting and working up of the zoological 
materials brought in by the steamer Albatross, and by the field parties 
collecting along the shore. Most of the specimens were at once entered 
in the catalogue books of the National Museum, whether they were to 
be sent directly to Washington or to the specialists engaged in study- 
ing them. By this method, which has now been practiced for several 
years, a careful record of all the specimens obtained by the Commission 
is kept under one series of catalogue numbers, by which they may 
always be recognized. The correcting of proof sheets of the writer's 
reports on ocean temperatures and the marine invertebrate fisheries 



128 EEPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

for the quarto Fishery Eeport, and other Fish Commission duties, 
have greatly interfered with work upon collections, but many careful 
preparations of marine animals were made for the study and exhibition 
series of the Museum. 

During the winter and spring much time was occupied in the care 
and preservation of collections. All of the accessions received during 
the year have been assorted, and the specimens catalogued and trans- 
ferred to suitable receptacles where they are permanently safe. The 
record books show the following number of entries under each group : 
Crustaceans, 996; Worms, 2,611; Echinoderms and Ccelenterates, 1,412; 
Bryozoans and Ascidians, 130 ; Sponges and Protozoans, 103 ; a total 
of 5,252. The large number of entries made in the Worm catalogue re- 
sulted from the recording of the fine collection of annelids, turned over 
to the Museum by Mr. James E. Benedict, naturalist of the steamer 
Albatross, who resigned his position during the summer to engage in 
business. He had been making a special study of the group and had 
placed this collection in excellent condition. 

Much progress has been made with the systematic or card catalogue 
of identified specimens in all the groups. This is used as the reference 
catalogue, and enables one to determine without delay the existence of 
any species in the collection, and the number and character of the speci- 
mens by which it is represented. Each " lot" of specimens of each spe- 
cies is entered upon a separate card, together with all the data known 
respecting it, including the catalogue number. These cards are then 
arranged in drawers in systematic order, after the manner of library 
catalogues, the principal divisions, down to genera, being indicated by 
taller cards appropriately inscribed. The main group to which these 
cards now serve as a convenient index are several divisions of the Crus- 
tacea, the Echini, Ophiurans, Asteridse, and stony Corals. 

The permanent arrangement of specimens has kept pace with the 
completion of studies in each group of animals. After all the material 
representing a species or genus has been determined, entered, and de- 
scribed, where necessary, the duplicates, if any, are selected and 
placed apart by themselves. Each "lot" of specimens is then boxed or 
bottled, according to its character, and given a conspicuous outer label, 
to facilitate arrangement in the cases and the subsequent reference to 
any desired species. The amount of material gone over in this manner 
has been very great, and a comparatively short time will suffice to 
place the bulk of the collection, and especially that portion composed 
mainly of the larger specimens, in similar good order. 

As it was announced early in the year that extensive alterations 
would be made in the corridor connecting the west hall, containing the 
marine invertebrate display collections, with the main Smithsonian hall, 
thereby necessitating its being closed to the public for several months, 
very little attention has been paid to the exhibition series, and it re- 
mains in about the same condition as at the end of the previous year. 



EEPOET ON THE DEPARTMENT OF INVERTEBRATES. 



129 



The same changes also required that all of the alcoholic collections be 
removed from the west basement, and they have been transferred to 
temporary storage elsewhere. The exhibition hall itself has been 
turned into a large store-room and work-room, where many of the alco- 
holic specimens are now safely stored for the summer. Advantage was 
taken of this opportunity to inspect all the alcoholic materials, in order 
to ascertain the condition of the specimens and to renew the preserva- 
tive where necessary. 

Mr. A. H. Baldwin and Miss M. J. Eathbun have acted as my assist- 
ants throughout the year, and Mr. Delano Ames served as a volunteer 
during May and June. Mr. Baldwin has had special charge of the sort- 
ing and care of collections, and has rendered valuable aid in the delin- 
eation of specimens for the Museum reports. Miss Eathbun has been 
occupied mainly with office work and cataloguing.

RESEARCHES. 

During the summer the curator completed for the Fish Commission a 
first report upon the surface-water temperatures of the Atlantic coast 
of the United States, based upon observations made at twenty-four of the 
more exposed light-houses and light-ships, beginning with Petit Manan, 
in eastern Maine, and ending with the Tortugas, in southern Florida. 
This report covers a period of five years, from January 1, 1881, to Jan- 
uary 1, 1886, and includes 32 graphic charts, representing the yearly 
temperature at each station, by ten-day means, and the yearly and 
mean isotherms for the entire coast, plotted for every 5° F. The ob- 
servations were taken specially for the Commission by the light-house 
keepers, whose services were kindly granted for that purpose by the 
Light-House Board. The reductions and original plottings were made 
by Miss M. J. Bathbun and the curator, and the final charts for en- 
graving were prepared by Mr. C. E. Gorham. The report has been in 
type since last October, and will form apart of Section in of the quarto 
Fishery Beport. Miss Bathbun also continued during the summer the 
work of reducing and mapping other series of temperature observations, 
mainly those taken at more enclosed stations of the Light- House and 
Signal Services. The object of this work has been to determine the 
bearing of temperature upon the migrations of such economic fishes as 
the mackerel and menhaden. The zoological studies of the curator, 
while at the Wood's Holl Station, were mainly limited to the parasitic 
copepods collected by the Fish Commission, and many drawings and 
descriptions were prepared. 

During the winter and spring the writer examined and identified 
most of the species of deep-water and littoral Madreporaria and Hydra- 
corallce obtained by the steamer Albatross during the previous three 
years, on the Atlantic coast south of Cape Hatteras, and in the Gulf of 
Mexico and Caribbean Sea. Only a few species that are possibly new 
were discovered, but many of doubtful identity will be taken to Cam- 
bridge, Massachusetts, during the summer, for comparison with the 
Blake collections, described by the late Count Pourtales. 

Nearly all of the corals of the genera Madrepora, Porites, and Syna- 
rcea have also been carefully determined, and reports upon the same 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF INVERTEBRATES. 131 

have been submitted for publication in the Proceedings of the Museum 
That upon the Madrepora has already been issued; the second one, 
upon Porites and Synarcea, is accompanied by several figures of the ex- 
ceedingly variable West Indian branching forms, Porites furcata and 
P. clavaria. The old coral collection of the Museum consisted mainly of 
the very valuable types described by Prof. James D. Dana, from the 
collections of the United States Exploring Expedition, 1838-'42, and by 
Prof. A. E. Verrill, from the smaller collections made by the North 
Pacific Exploring Expedition, 1853-'57. As explained in previous re- 
ports, the specimens received from the former expedition did not come 
into the possession of the Museum until some time after they had been 
returned to the Government, and in the interval many specimens were 
lost or badly injured, and numerous labels were displaced. About 
twenty years ago Professor Yerrill made a partial revision of the col- 
lection, but the manner in which it was stored at the time did not per- 
mit of its being placed in satisfactory condition. Within the past few 
years, however, nearly all the specimens have been remounted and ar- 
ranged in the exhibition cases, where they may be regarded as safe for 
all time, and are also convenient for reference. In view of this fact it 
becomes a labor of great satisfaction to undertake a second revision of 
the specimens in connection with the identification of similar materials 
more recently received ; and as each group is gone over, it is proposed 
to publish catalogues of the species, like those above mentioned. This 
work has been rendered more easy by the discovery among Professor 
VerrilFs papers during the past year of a copy of the coral catalogue of 
the National Museum, the original having been destroyed probably in 
the Smithsonian fire of 1865. Type specimens of all the species of 
Madrepora described by Dana and Verrill have been found in the col- 
lection, and of Porites the types of only one or two species are now 
missing. Work upon the family Oculinidw had been nearly completed 
at the close of the year. 

The collection of Star fishes belonging to the genus Asterias and al- 
lied genera is also being revised in a similar manner, and a short paper 
descriptive of the species of Heliaster, with photographic plates of all 
the known forms, has already been offered for publication in the Pro- 
ceedings. Stimpson's types of the species of Asterias are all preserved 
in good condition, and have recently been supplemented by very large 
collections from the western and northwestern coasts of North America. 

The elaboration of collections belonging to the Museum, or soon to 
come into its possession, elsewhere than in Washington has been con- 
tinued about as in former years. Professor Verrill, of Yale College, 
has retained general control of the Fish Commission invertebrates col- 
lected on the Atlantic coast north of Cape Hatteras, but has boen occu- 
pied mainly with the study of the Mollusca, Echinodermata, Coelente- 
rata, and Annelidee, assisted by Mr. Sanderson Smith, Miss A. J. 
Bush, and Miss C. E. Bush. Prof. S. I. Smith, of Yale College, has 



132 EEPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

been at work upon the Crustacea of the Fish Commission, excepting 
the Copepoda ; Mr. J. Walter Fewkes, of the Museum of Comparative 
Zoology, Cambridge, upon the Acalepha ; Prof. L. A. Lee, of Bowdoin 
College, Maine, upon the Foraminifera ; and Prof. E. Linton, of Wash- 
ington and Jefferson College, Pennsylvania, and Mr. B. F. Koons, of 
the Storrs Agricultural School, Connecticut, upon the internal para- 
sites of fishes. 

The Hon. Theodore Lyman, of Brookline, Massachusetts, continued to 
give his kindly assistance in determining our collection of Ophiurans, 
until ill health obliged him to relinquish active work. He has, however, 
nearly completed the identification of the Albatross specimens collected 
south of Cape Hatteras, and has made considerable progress with the 
collections from western North America and Alaska. 

EXPLORATIONS. 

The Fish Commission steamer Albatross, Lieut. Commander Z. L. 
Tanner, U. S. Navy, commanding, was engaged in explorations from 
the beginning of the fiscal year until the latter part of October, when 
she returned to Washington and was laid up for the winter, pending 
the necessary changes to fit her for the contemplated expedition to the 
Pacific coast. The first cruise was made duiing July, and a line of 
dredging was carried across the inner edge of the Gulf Stream slope 
south of Martha's Vineyard, from a depth of 226 to a depth of 1,137 
fathoms. The second cruise extended mainly to the eastward of New 
England, and was undertaken in the joint interests of the Fish Com- 
mission and Hydrographic Bureau. Sounding was begun August 3, in 
search of the mythical Hope Bank, about 200 miles south of Halifax, 
Nova Scotia, but during a three days' search no shallow water could be 
found, the depths on the reported position of the bank ranging from 1,930 
to 2,900 fathoms. After leaving Hope Bank a line of soundings was 
run across the southern edge of the Grand Bank of Newfoundland, and 
a search was then instituted for another supposed bank, about 200 miles, 
southeast of the Flemish Cap. The shoalest water discovered was 
1,900 fathoms, the deepest 2,600 fathoms. Five dredge hauls were sub- 
sequently made on the Flemish Cap, in depths of 72 to 105 fathoms, 
and one between the Flemish Cap and the Grand Bank in a depth of 
206 fathoms, after which the Albatross put into St. John's, Newfound- 
land, for supplies. On the homeward trip five dredgings were made 
on and south of St. Peter's Bank in depths of 59 to 215 fathoms, two 
east of Sable Island Bank in 110 to 140 fathoms, and one south of the 
same bauk in 1,255 fathoms. Three days were again spent in sounding 
for Hope Bank, eighteen casts of the lead being made in depths of 
1,587 to 1,943 fathoms. Just west of this locality the beam-trawl was 
hauled twice in 1,099 and 1,188 fathoms, and south of George's Bank 
three times in 866 to 984 fathoms. 

From September 16 to 20 a second deep-water cruise was taken to the 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF INVERTEBRATES. 133 

Gulf Stream slope, about 200 miles south of New England, and twelve 
hauls obtained from depths of 594 to 1,867 fathoms. While returning 
to Washington, the latter part of October, a successful series of dredg- 
ings was carried along the same slope, off the Virginia coast, in depths 
of 679 to 1,685 fathoms. Early in April, when giving instructions in 
the use of the dredging apparatus to the officers of the U. S. S. Thetis, 
several hauls were made in about 15 fathoms of water, directly in front 
of Fortress Monroe, Virginia. The total number of dredgings made 
during the summer and fall was fifty-six (stations 2680-2735), in depths 
varying from 72 to 1,867 fathoms, and a large amount of valuable ma- 
terial was obtained. The large beam-trawl was almost exclusively em- 
ployed, and with uniform success. 

Mr. James E. Benedict, who had acted as chief naturalist of the Al- 
batross since it first went into commission, resigned his position in Au- 
gust, to engage in business, and was succeeded by Mr. Thomas Lee, 
who had already served with the steamer about a year. Mr. Sanderson 
Smith also accompanied the steamer on all its cruises, taking special 
charge of the Mollusca. 

The Fish Commission schooner Grampus, commanded by Capt. J. 
W. Collins, remained in active service during the entire year, and its 
explorations covered an exceedingly wide area. Collecting was done 
mostly by means of hooks and lines, but during April and May, while 
following the movements of the early school of mackerel, on the south- 
ern grounds, the towing-net was frequently employed at the surface in 
obtaining specimens of mackerel food. The results of this cruise, when 
fully worked up, will prove very instructive. 

The Fish Commission station at Wood's Holl. Massachusetts, was 
open from early in July until the middle of October, and became for 
that period the headquarters of the steamer Albatross, where its col- 
lections were landed and studied. The Commissioner was present 
during the entire season, and retained general direction of the scientific 
work. Prof. A. E. Verrill took charge of the biological laboratory, 
while able to be present, or for about two months, the same duty being 
assigned to the curator at other times. The regular laboratory party 
was constituted as follows : Prof. S. I. Smith, of Yale College ; Mr. 
Sanderson Smith, of New York ; Mr. John A. Eyder, of Washington ; 
Prof. L. A. Lee, of Bowdoin College, Maine; Prof. E.Linton, of Wash- 
ington and Jefferson College, Pennsylvania ; Prof. B. F. Koons, of the 
Storrs Agricultural College, Connecticut; Mr. Peter Parker, jr., of 
Washington, in charge of the fishes; Mr. J. Henry Blake, of Cam- 
bridge, Massachusetts, as artist; Mr. A. H. Baldwin and Miss M. J. 
Eathbun, the curator's assistants ; and Miss A.J. Bush and Miss C. E. 
Bush, assistants of Professor Verrill. The chemical and physical labor- 
atory was under Dr. J. H. Kidder, as in previous years ; and Mr. W. P. 
Seal, of Philadelphia, had charge of the aquaria, which, under his 
arrangement, became very useful adjuncts to our work. Tables in the 



134 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

biological laboratory were also occupied by Prof. S. F. Clarke, of Wil- 
liams College, Prof. E. B. Wilson, of Bryn Mawr College, and Mr. 
Bruce, of Johns Hopkins University. Mr. James E. Benedict and Mr. 
Thomas Lee rendered services on shore when the Albatross was in port, 
and Mr. Vinal N. Edwards, who is stationed at Wood's Holl the entire 
year, was always on hand for collecting and the preparation of large 
specimens. Mr. S. E. Meek was employed at Fulton Market, New 
York, during the summer and fall, in collecting the parasites of fish, 
which are now being studied by several specialists. 

It is fitting that mention should be made in this connection of the 
death of one of the most valued members of our party. Capt. Hubbard 
C. Chester, well known as the executive officer of Hall's Polaris expe- 
dition to the Arctic regions, and the rescuer of the ship's crew, drifted 
from the land on the ice-floe bearing the ill-fated steamer, joined the 
Fish Commission in 1874, the year in which the writer first entered the 
same service. His duties were varied, and were always performed in 
the same thorough and conscientious manner, which brought success to 
all his undertakings. On the smaller steamers, before the Albatross was 
built, he was generally in charge of the dredging manipulations, and it 
was scarcely deemed auspicious to go to sea without him. After the 
completion of the new station at Wood's Holl, he became its superintend- 
ent, and so continued to the time of his death. He was thus brought 
again in intimate relations with the investigating party, but from that 
time on his attention was mainly directed toward improving the methods 
of marine fish culture, and the appliances of his invention are now ex- 
clusively employed in the hatching of cod and lobsters. He had been 
ailing more or less since the winter of 1878-'79, when he suffered from a 
severe attack of pneumonia, and died July 19, 1887, after a short but 
painful illness. His death brought sorrow to many friends. 

No other branch of the Government besides the Fish Commission has 
such excellent opportunities for increasing the stores of this department 
of the Museum as the naval service, and scarcely a year passes without 
important contributions from that source. The U. S. S. Thetis, which 
left Norfolk, Virginia, for Alaska, in May last, in charge of Lieut. W. 
H. Emory, U. S. Navy, received a complete dredging oufit from the Fish 
Commission, at the solicitation of her commanding officer, who promises 
to devote much time to the collecting of marine specimens. The coast 
along which he will cruise has never been explored below a depth of 
about 50 fathoms, and as it is Lieutenant Emory's intention to work 
mainly between that depth and 200 fathoms, very valuable results may 
be expected, both for the fisheries and for science. 

Lieut. J. F. Moser, IT. S. Navy, in command of the Coast Survey 
steamer Bache, which has been sounding in the shallow waters of the 
Florida coast, in the neighborhood of Cedar Keys, and between Cape 
Roman and Cape Sable, found time, during the last spring, to do 
considerable dredging with very successful results. His outfit was 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF INVERTEBRATES. 135 

furnished by the Museum and Fish Commission, both of which are bene- 
fited by his work. A portion of his collection, received before the close 
of the year, is acknowledged above. Ensign W. E. Safford. U. S.Navy, 
who was detailed in 1883 for instruction in natural history at the 
National Museum, arrived in San Francisco, California, during last 
spring from a long cruise on the U. S. S. Mohican, which sailed from the 
Atlantic coast about a year before. A collection received from him in 
June indicates that the many rare opportunities afforded him for ob- 
taining specimens were not neglected, and the surface towings he ob- 
tained are very rich in interesting forms. Lieuts. W. M. Wood and A. 
Baker, U. S. Navy, who were also formerly in the service of the Com- 
mission, have made collections during their cruises of the past year, 
which have not yet been received. Lieut. Commader H. E. Nichols, 
U. S. Navy, of the steamer Pinta, has continued his collecting on the 
southern Alaskan coast, and Dr. Ferebee, TJ. S. Navy, of the U. S. S. 
Trenton, has sent in a number of specimens which he obtained in Corea 
and China. 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF COMPARATIVE ANATOMY IN THE 
U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 



By Frederick W. True, Acting Curator. 



For reasons already pointed out in the report for 1885, this depart- 
ment continues of necessity to be in fact a department of comparative 
osteology, and with the rapidly increasing amount of material it is dif- 
ficult for the present force to do full justice to it, even as thus limited. 
Mammalian osteology still largely preponderates in the exhibition series, 
but representative forms of other classes are being added as fast as 
possible. 

Among the more notable accessions of the year are a Gorilla ( Gorilla 
savagei) obtained with other specimens in an exchange with the Paris 
Museum of Natural History; a fine example of the Caribbean Seal 
(Monachus tropicalis): and a Pygmy Sperm Whale (Kogia breviceps). 
This last was secured, with two other cetaceans, through Capt. B. T. 
Barco, keeper of the TJ. S. life-saving station at Dam Neck Mills, Vir- 
ginia. 

Mr. William T. Hornaday, chief taxidermist of the Museum, collected 
a large and valuable series of skeletons and skulls of the Bison (Bison 
americanus), besides many other very desirable skeletons of smaller 
mammals and of birds. By the continued courtesy of Mr. A. E. Brown, 
of the Philadelphia Zoological Society, and Mr. W. A. Oonklin, of the 
Central Park Menagerie, many valuable specimens have been added to 
the collection. 

The series of birds preserved in alcohol has very largely increased 
and contains many important forms. 

Work upon the study and exhibition series has steadily progressed 
during the year, the number of specimens which have been prepared or 
mounted being shown in the report of the osteological preparator, who 
has been appointed assistant curator of this department. 

As fast as possible the specimens on exhibition have been provided 
with printed labels, while to increase the educational value of this se- 
ries many colored sketches of living animals have been placed alongside 
of the skeletons of the species to which they belong. 

Much has been done in classifying and arranging the study series of 
bird-skeletons, but much still remains to be done.

Additional assistance is very greatly needed in this department, and 
the lack of it is being more and more severely felt. Much of the ma- 
terial received is of such a character as to require immediate attention, 
and this causes constant interruption of work already well under way, 
the assistant curator being compelled to devote to the work of prepa- 
ration time which could be much more profitably employed. 

The collection of alcoholic birds is in want of immediate attention, 
many specimens having lain untouched for ten or fifteen years, and to 
make this valuable mass of material thoroughly available a card cata- 
logue is imperatively needed. A catalogue of the bird-skeletons, if 
available, would also be of much service. 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF INVERTEBRATE FOSSILS (PALEO- 
ZOIC) IN THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 



By Charles D. Walcott, Honorary Curator. 



Two objects have been kept in view in conducting the work of the 
year : (1) The systematizing and recording of the old collections and 
accessions preparatory to classifying an exhibition, a study, and a du- 
plicate series of specimens ; (2) The obtaining by collection, exchange, 
and gift, of material to fill in gaps in the collection and to render it, in 
certain lines, more comprehensive and complete than any other Ameri- 
can collection. And two events have taken place that have had and 
will continue to have a marked effect upon the first object. These are 
(1) the change from the small rooms in the south tower of the Museum 
to the larger laboratory and office in the southwest pavilion, and (2) the 
appointment of a Museum assistant in the person of Mr. E. E. Gurley, 
who began work December 1, 1886. 

With better facilities for handling the collections, and with Mr. Gur- 
ley to do the routine work on them, I hope within another year to have 
the entire series properly classified and arranged. In order to advance 
this work more rapidly, during the winter, Mr. C. J. Akin, of the Geo- 
logical Survey, was employed for three months in cataloguing and paint- 
ing the record numbers on the specimens; and, with but slight exception, 
all the accessions have been recorded, numbered, and transferred to the 
main collection. 

The additions to the collections, as given in the appendix to this re- 
port, show a satisfactory increase ; yet there are over 6,000 specimens 
not therein included which will be transferred from the TJ. S. Geological 
Survey as soon as they shall have been studied. 

In June, Mr. Gurley went into the field, accompanying one of the 
field parties of the Geological Survey, to collect fossils in East Tennes- 
see, which are needed to give a fuller representation of the Upper Cam- 
brian fauna of that region. 

I respecfully repeat the recommendation made in my report for the 
last fiscal year, " that a sum be set aside each year for the increase of 
the collection, by purchase and by sending out collectors." 

The following accessions have been received : 

No. 17474,* from H. C. Powers, Beloit, Wisconsin, contains many fine 

* Received prior to July 1, 1886.

140 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

specimens, and supplements the important accession given by him the 
previous year. With these additions the collection of Trenton fossils 
from Wisconsin is placed in a creditable condition. 

No. 18532, from A. 0. Benedict, Indianapolis, Indiana, is large and 
contains many interesting and valuable specimens, as also No. 18543, 
from John H. Lemon, New Albany, Indiana, and furnish corals which 
were very much needed in the Museum series. 

No. 18642, collected by I. C. Eussell, of the U. S. Geological Survey, 
although small, is of unusual interest; and Mr. Eussell has indicated 
his intention of making a large addition to it during the ensuing field 
season. 

No. 18991, collected and identified by N. H. Darton, of the U. S. Geo- 
logical Survey, was received in good condition for exhibition and adds 
material to a weak spot in the collections. 

Nos. 19043 and 19115, collected by myself, contain types of 26 new 
species and give a good series of the faunas they represent. 

Altogether, 4,989 specimens were added during the year. 

The first four months of the year I was engaged in field-work in con- 
nection with the Geological Survey. After returning in November and 
moving into the new office and laboratory, work was begun by Mr. Gur- 
ley on the accumulated accessions and pushed so vigorously that by 
June 1 all the accessions, with the exception of those I wished to study 
before identifying, were catalogued and the record numbers painted on 
the specimens. A large amount of material in the general collection 
was also cleaned, identified, and labeled. From the latter and other 
accessions the exhibition series will be selected. 

From material collected by the U. S. Geological Survey not yet trans- 
ferred to the Museum, and from material already in the Museum collec- 
tions, I continued the study of the Cambrian faunas of North America. 
A large number of drawings were prepared, and the preliminary study 
of the Upper Cambrian fauna so far advanced that the work of another 
year will get the larger portion of it in readiness for publication. 

A special study of the fauna of the Taconic rocks of New York was 
completed and a paper thereon prepared for publication. The speci- 
mens are recorded under accession number 19115. A paper was also 
prepared on the "Taconic System" of Emmons and read before the 
National Academy of Sciences April 22, 18S7. 

In my last report a summary was given of the material in the collec- 
tion. To that must be added the accessions of the past year, 4,989 
specimens. 

The catalogue numbers taken up during the year were from 15461 
to 16000 and from 17001 to 17496. The break in the numbering, from 
16000 to 17001, represents the one thousand numbers assigned to Prof. 
Henry S. Williams, but not yet taken up. 

Additions have been made to the material selected for exhibition, 
and by the time the exhibition cases are ready to receive the specimens 
a very good representative collection can be displayed. Until after 



EEPOET ON THE DEPAETMENT OF INVEETEBEATE FOSSILS. 141 

the exhibition series is selected the collection will not be dismembered 
into exhibition, reserve, and duplicate series, as the work involved in 
the handling of over 80,000 specimens is too great to be undertaken 
until the entire collection shall have been labeled and systematized. 

A list of the publications which appeared during the year and which 
were based on studies of the material contained in the collections, or 
on data obtained from field-work done by myself, will be found in Section 
IV of this volume.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF INVERTEBRATE FOSSILS (MESOZOIC) 
IN THE U, S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 



By C. A. White, Honorary Curator. 



By far the greater portion of my time, and of my assistant, has been 
devoted to the performance of work connected with my duties as pa- 
leontologist of the U. S. Geological Survey, so that comparatively little 
has been accomplished in the way of Museum work. During the year, 
however, the card catalogue of all the material belonging to the Museum 
and now in the custody of the department was completed, and the en- 
tire collection is now identified, labeled, and ready for exhibition. 

Only twelve accessions were received, among the most important of 
which were the following : 

Four specimens of Belemnitella quadrata, from Prof. 0. Schluter. A 
collection from the Pebas group of the Amazon, sent by Dr. O. Bottger. 
Seven specimens each of Cyclostoma antiquus and C. tricarinata, and 
two specimens of Cyrena lirata, from Prof. C. L. F. Sandberger, of 
Wiirzburg, Germany. A collection of 63 specimens from Prof. M. Neu- 
mayr, for which a collection was sent him in exchange. Eight speci- 
mens from Mr. Edward Crane, Brighton, England. A collection from 
the Laramie group, sent by C. R. Beiderman. Alaskan cretaceous fos- 
sils, from E. E. Howell. A collection of fossils from Oregon, sent by 
Prof. T. Condon. A collection of fossils, from Dr. J. S. Newberry, of 
Columbia College, New York City. 

The number of the last entry for June, 1886, was 19970 ; that for 
June, 1887, 21003. 

Five papers were published by the curator during the year, and are 
noticed in Section iv of the report. 

143 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FOSSTL PLANTS IN THE U. S. 
NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 



By Lester F. Ward, Honorary Curator. 



No very important accessions have been received. The additions 
have been mostly single specimens sent in by the various correspond- 
ents, either for scientific determination or as objects of interest, and 
are comparatively unimportant. 

Prof. Leo Lesquereux, of Columbus, Ohio, has been engaged during 
a part of the year in determining the collection of fossil leaves made by 
Oapt. Ohas. Bendire, U. S. A., in the John Day Eiver region, Oregon. 
Many new and interesting things have been reported by him from time 
to time, but the work was not finished at the end of June, nor was it in 
condition to admit of any systematic analysis. The specimens, with 
accompanying illustrations, will be returned to the Museum as soon as 
the work is completed. 

Mr. F. H. Knowlton has devoted much time during the year to the 
investigation of the internal structure of fossil wood, a study which has 
been much neglected in this country, but in which there is manifested a 
great and constantly increasing activity in Europe. 

A room in the west south balcony, before used only as a store-room, 
has been fitted up as a microscopical laboratory. A microscopical table, 
specially designed for this work, has been supplied by the Museum 
authorities, and a considerable number of microscopical appliances 
have been purchased by the TJ. S. Geological Survey. These, together 
with a good microscope, and other instruments which are the private 
property of Mr. Knowlton, make a fairly good working laboratory. 

The special subject of investigation has been the wood and lignite of 
the Potomac formation, from which considerable material had been 
collected by the members of the U. S. Geological Survey and other par- 
ties. Microscopical sections of these specimens have been prepared, 
either by Mr. Knowlton or under his immediate direction, and carefully 
studied. The results reached have been very satisfactory indeed, and 
have helped to clear up several points that were before obscure. It 
was proved that all the fossil wood and lignite of this formation was 
coniferous, and includes types of structure that are very old. The ma-

146 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

terial was found to contain five species, all new to science. These are, 
Cupressinoxylon, with four species, and Araucarioxylon, with one species. 
The results are embodied in a report which contains about 150 manu- 
script pages and is illustrated by 7 plates. It will be published as a 
bulletin by the U. S. Geological Survey in connection with reports by 
Mr. W J McGee and Prof. W. M. Fontaine on the geology and paleon- 
tology. In the preparation of this paper almost the entire literature of 
the subject was examined, and a brief resume, from its first mention in 
literature down to the close of the year 1886, is included as an intro- 
duction to the paper. 

A great amount of fossil wood is in the possession of the National 
Museum, which Mr. Kuowlton proposes to investigate as opportunity 
may permit, since nothing is now known regarding its internal struct- 
ure or botanical affinities.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF RECENT PLANTS IN THE U. S, 
NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 



By Lester F. Ward, Honorary Curator. 



Probably the most valuable collection received during the year was 
that made by Dr. Edward Palmer in southwestern Mexico. It con- 
tained about 800 species, of which number about 20 per cent, were new 
to science. More than half the entire number proved to be new to the 
herbarium, which, through the activity of Dr. Palmer and Mr. C. G. 
Pringle, now contains a fairly good representation of the Mexican flora. 

Mr. Pringle also made during this year a continuation of his "Plantae 
Mexicanse," which contained the usual number of new species. 

Mr. S. Applegate contributed a small collection of Alaskan plants, a 
few of which were new to the herbarium. 

Through the New Orleans Exposition the IT. S. National Museum 
received a valuable collection of ferns from Costa Rica, which numbered 
112 species. From lack of the necessary books and material for com- 
parison these specimens were sent to Kew for determination, where they 
received the attention of Mr. J. G. Baker, the well-known authority 
on the Filices. He detected among them some species new to science. 
This collection, which is the largest ever received from Costa Rica, 
added 60 species to the list of ferns that were before known to grow in 
that locality. Two full sets were returned from Kew, one of which is 
deposited in the herbarium of the National Museum. The other was 
sent to the Gray herbarium at Cambridge, Massachusetts. 

A very fine collection, numbering over 600 carefully mounted species 
and a large series of duplicates, was received from central New York. 
This comprised the entire herbarium of the late Mr. O. E. Pearce, whose 
death occurred September 11, 1886. The collection was made mostly in 
the vicinity of Ithaca, New York, and contains many interesting forms. 

Other collections of smaller size were donated by Dr. J. C. McCormick, 
Mr. J. W. Johnson, and Prof. Alfred Duges. 

The routine work of the department has been largely a continuation 
of that outlined in several of my former reports. The herbarium was 
established so recently that the only thing to be done at first was to 
mount the specimens and arrange them in a suitable manner for refer- 
ence and study. Consequently the routine work has been in this direc- 

147 



148 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

tion. Thousands of specimens have been poisoned and mounted on the 
regular herbarium paper and put in the commodious cases provided for 
them. They have been arranged according to the latest and best sys- 
tem of classification, and the compartments in which they are placed 
have also been labeled so that the contents of each is shown at a glance. 
There are now over 17,000 species arranged in the cases and ready for 
reference and study. The species index is kept up, and will continue 
to be made an important feature. The duplicates, of which there are 
probably from 8,000 to 10,000 specimens, representing about 4,000 spe- 
cies, have been arranged alphabetically and put away in the old herba- 
rium cases. By this arrangement everything in hand can be readily 
found, and we are thus in position to begin exchanging with other her- 
baria, a matter that will receive early attention. 

The new herbarium cases, four in number, were received during the 
month of December, and the entire collection expanded and placed in 
them. There is now probably ample spare room to accommodate the 
growth of several years. 

No exhibition or study series has as yet been attempted j but it is 
hoped that something of the kind may soon be undertaken, as there is 
undoubtedly a great field for popular instruction open in this direction. 

The active technical work has been confined mainly to the determi- 
nation of such collections as have come unnamed to the Museum, or 
such specimens as have been sent in by the various correspondents of 
the Institution or Museum with the special request to have them iden- 
tified. A little work has also been done on the collections of cultivated 
plants made about the District. Lack of books of reference and suit- 
able material for comparison makes this work difficult. It will, how- 
ever, be undertaken shortly in a more thorough manner, and then more 
satisfactory results may be looked for. 

The following tabular statement shows the present condition of the 
collection :

Number of species added during the year 1, 709

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS IN THE U, S. NATIONAL 

MUSEUM, 1887. 



By F. W. Clarke, Honorary Curator. 



During the year the routine work of the department has been carried 
on under my direction by Mr. W. S. Yeates, assisted by Mr. H.H.James 
as clerk, and the growth of the mineral collection has been quite satis- 
factory. The following important accessions may be properly noted: 

(1) The collection of meteorites has been enriched by the deposit of 
the private collection belonging to Prof. C. TJ. Shepard, jr. This col- 
lection numbers about 200 falls, some of them of extreme rarity. The 
meteorite collection has also been increased during the year by exchanges 
with the cabinets of Harvard, Tale, and Amherst Colleges, the British 
Museum, and Mr. B. Stiirtz, of Bonn, Germany. About 40 falls were 
thus added, making our total number, exclusive of the Shepard collec- 
tion, 101. 

(2) There were obtained for the gem collection by purchase 151 cut 
specimens of agate, jasper, carnelian, bloodstone, etc. Additions have 
also been made by the special cutting of rough specimens previously 
in the Museum, and the collection has thereby gained several handsome 
gifts. Mr. 0. S. Bement, of Philadelphia, gave some fine sapphires and 
zircons, and a large moonstone from Virginia. Mr. G. F. Kunz, of New 
York, gave 18 cut specimens of moss agate, bloodstone, onyx, sard- 
onyx, etc. Mrs. S. F. Baird gave a brooch of Norwegian pegmatite, 
set in silver, and a fine bloodstone. Mr. Thomas Wilson deposited a 
large carved seal of yellow quartz and 10 antique intaglios of rock 
crystal, carnelian, agate, and plasma. From the Treasury Department 
was received a collection of 133 small diamonds and 150 pearls. These 
were presented by the Imaum of Muscat to President Van Buren. The 
gem collection has practically doubled during the year. 

(3) The general collection of minerals has received important additions 
as follows : By gift — from H. U.Thorpe, of Liberty Hill, Texas, 40 speci- 
mens of celestite, garnet, aragonite, etc. By exchange — 64 specimens of 
Maine minerals from N. H. Perry, of South Paris ; 16 specimens of the 
Lake Valley vanadates, etc., from T. Kendall, of Beading, Pennslyvania ; 
37 specimens of Japanese minerals, including some remarkable quartz, 
stibnite, and amber, from the Educational Museum at Tokioj 30

150 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

specimens from the iron mine at Antwerp, New York, from Mr. B. S. 
Hodge, of Antwerp 5 86 specimens, mainly of "German minerals, from 
B. Stiirtz, of Bonn. By purchase — 74 specimens of Swedish minerals, 
collected by L. Igelstrom. The total growth of the collection during 
the year, though not remarkably rapid, has been satisfactory. 

Concerning the routine work of the department little need be said. 
The usual amount of necessary cataloguing, labeling, mounting, etc., 
has been done, and the exchange system has been kept up so as to leave 
no outstanding obligations at the close of the year. In exchanges we 
sent out 23 packages, containing 753 specimens, and two collections, 
numbering 198 specimens, have been given to educational institutions. 
Seventeen specimens have been transferred to the chemical laboratory 
of the U. S. Geological Survey for use in current investigations. In 
field-work, under the Geological Survey, I visited a number of localities 
in Maine and Massachusetts, and sent in fair but not large collections. 

A little scientific work upon minerals belonging to the Museum has 
been done by myself and my associates in the laboratory of the Geolog- 
ical Survey. This is covered by three researches, namely : One by my- 
self upon the micas ; one by Mr. J. E. Whitfield, on the natural borates; 
and one by Mr. B. B. Biggs, upon the tourmalines. None of these were 
published during the current year. 

During the year 1,938 specimens have been added to the collection 
(comprising 875 entries in the catalogue). Of these, 1,283 have been 
assigned to the reserve and 649 to the duplicate series. Six were re-

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF LITHOLOGY AND PHYSICAL GEOLOGY 
IN THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 



By George P. Merrill, Curator. 



The work of the year has been almost wholly in the line of preparing 
the ^exhibition and reserve series, and this necessitated the study 
with the microscope of a large number of thin sections of rocks. To 
facilitate this work the curator has passed three days of each week from 
December until March in the petrographical laboratory of the Johns 
Hopkins University at Baltimore. While there, several hundred slides 
were examined, and from the results obtained I have been enabled to 
classify and arrange a considerable amount of material which has been 
accumulating for many years, but which could not be utilized owing to 
a lack of proper identification. 

No systematic collecting has been carried on during the year. In the 
course of a six weeks' outing in Montana during August and Septem- 
ber, in company with Dr. A. C. Peale, of the U. S. Geological Survey, I 
obtained much material of interest and value, which will be noticed 
under the head of accessions. During a hurried trip to California in 
March I also obtained some valuable material and made arrangements 
for a series of exchanges by which I hope to gain much of interest. 

Four new cases for the accommodation of relief maps have been con- 
structed from designs furnished by myself, and have proved very satis- 
factory. In one instance the map — that of the Comstock Lode and 
Washoe district, Nevada, from surveys by Becker — is arranged to lie 
horizontally and is protected by a covering of plate- glass and a mahog- 
any railing. In the other three instances the maps are inclined at a high 
angle, the bottoms being some 1 8 inches from the floor, and each case 
carrying two maps, one on each side. The cases are so constructed that 
when desired they can be separated vertically into two parts, each half 
constituting a case by itself. This arrangement is of especial conve- 
nience whenever it is desired to remove temporarily oue or more of the 
maps to the lecture- room. A large wall case, consisting of three inde- 
pendent sections, has also been constructed for the west end of the ex- 
hibition hall. Owing to the two large doorways, gas-meter, and hose- 
pipe, no perfectly satisfactory case for purposes of exhibition could be 

151

constructed. All things considered, the present one is probably the best 
that can be designed. 

The accessions of special interest are enumerated and annotated be- 
low: 

John N. Atwood sent a collection of some 40 specimens of norite from Keeseville, 
New York. 

Henry J. Biddle sent a fine series, comprising some 41 bard specimens, of olivine 
and bronzite-rocks from the vicinity of Webster, Nortb Carolina. 

Mrs. E. K. Huntington presented (through Prof. C. Chamberlain) one large slab 
glacial polished and fluted limestone from Kelly's Island, Lake Erie. Tbis is a very 
fine and unique specimen, and the Museum was especially fortunate in being able to 
procure it before it was destroyed by the quarrying operations now being carried on 
in that vicinity. 

W. J. McGee, of the U. S. Geological Survey, gave one large concretion of ferruginous 
sandstone from the glauconitic sand formations on Lloyd Creek, Sassafras River, 
Maryland. 

George P. Merrill gave a small collection of serpentine and eruptive rocks from 
California and Arizona. Also a very beautiful vein of sbodocbrosite and quartz from 
Butte, Montana. 

Dr. A. C. Peale and G. P. Merrill gave a beautiful series of wood opals from the 
bluffs on the Madison River. Also a fine lot of eruptive and sedimentary rocks from 
the region of the Gallatin Valley, Montana. 

Pike Manufacturing Company, of Pike Station, New Hampshire, gave a large and 
carefully prepared series of hone whetstones, scythe stones, and grinding stones, both 
native and foreign. 

Charles D. Walcott, of the U. S. Geological Survey, gave two large slabs of Pots- 
dam quartzite with ripple marks. Extra fine specimens, both on account of size and 
the quality of the markings. 

B. Sturtz, of Bonn, Prussia, sent in exchange for other material an interesting 
series of rocks, comprising 34 specimens, from Monte Vultari, Italy, Sardinia, Isle 
of Ponza, Transylvania, and other European localities. 

Dr. George H. Williams sent a fine example of contorted gneiss. 

Prof. W. O. Crosby gave specimens of contorted mica schist from Naragansett Bay. 

E. Fritsch, New York, gave a series of 5 slabs African and German marbles. 

J. S. Diller, of the U. S. Geological Survey, gave a collection of eruptive rocks 
from California and Kentucky. 

A statement of the character of the routine work has been given in 
previous reports and needs no repetition here. A very considerable 
amount of time is being continually demanded in attending to corre- 
spondence and identifying materials sent in by outsiders. While this 
is a legitimate and necessary work, unfortunately for the curator it 
requires time which might otherwise be devoted to the preparation of 
his exhibition series, or other work in which he is more especially in- 
terested. The merely mechanical part of label writing also consumes 
much time. Some 825 labels have been written and sent to the printer 
during the year. In the preparation of these and in other clerical 
work, I was assisted from July until November 15 by Miss B. Frank- 
land, and from November 30 to March 10 by Miss Carrie Eosenbusch. 

The main points of growth in the exhibition series have been the 
lithological and stratigraphical collections. This, for the reason that 
proper cases are yet to be prepared for the other exhibits. The mechan- 



DEPARTMENT OF LITHOLOGY AND PHYSICAL GEOLOGY. 153 

ical work of preparing the specimens both for exhibition and storage, 
has as heretofore been acceptably performed by Mr. Forney. About 
50 samples of building-stone have been dressed and a large amount of 
material has been trimmed down into the form of hand specimens for 
storage exhibition, and exchange. Eleven lots of duplicates, compris- 
ing some 480 specimens, have been sent out during the year. 

No researches of consequence have been carried on upon Museum ma- 
terial, excepting so far as was necessary for correct identification, and 
this has been already referred to. What papers have appeared have 
been wholly my own and are noticed in the bibliography. 

The numbers given below regardiug the present state of the collec- 
tion are, so far as they refer to the duplicate collections, mere approxi- 
mations. A large rock specimen which to-day counts as one, may to- 
morrow be a dozen or twenty, as it is the custom in many cases to bring 
in material in the mass, and cut it up or break it, as occasion demands. 

Whole number of specimens in reserve series 18, 000 

Whole number of duplicates 3, 500 

Total 21,500 

Of the reserve series 5,687 are now on exhibition ; of these 2,720 are 
building-stones, and 1,893 belong to the educational series of rocks and 
rock-forming minerals. 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF METALLURGY AND ECONOMIC 
GEOLOGY IN THE U, S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 



By F. P. Dewey, Curator. 



The principal work of the department during the year was the prep- 
aration of a preliminary descriptive catalogue of the collections in 
economic geology and metallurgy. 

Starting with the collections exhibited at the New Orleans exposition 
as a foundation, they were expanded, and as many systematic series as 
possible were constructed out of material in the Museum. 

These systematic collections are designed to show the actual occur- 
rence of each metal, and the processes used in their extraction. To 
these are added illustrations of the occurrences of non-metallic ores and 
their utilization. 

The collections start, in the case of each metal, by showing the series 
of minerals in which the metal forms an important constituent ; the 
specimens are selected to show each mineral in its best perfection, in 
order that it may be seen just how the metals occur in the ores. 

The next step is a series of ores selected to show the actually occur- 
ring material that is mined, together with the associates of the ore. In 
the case of the base metal, there may not be much difference between 
the ore specimens and the mineral specimens, except the general purity 
and perfection of the latter, and that an ore may contain several minerals 
of the same, or even different, metals, especially alteration products, 
which do not have a definite composition. 

In the case of the precious metals, however, there may be a wide dif- 
ference between the two, depending upon the manner of occurrence of 
the valuable portion of the ore. In the case of silver, one part distrib- 
uted through a thousand parts of foreign material, may constitute a 
paying ore; if now this one part be distributed through the remainder 
evenly it will not be possible to detect any silver mineral in the ore. If, 
however, the silver should be concentrated in separate portions through 
the mass, it may be possible to pick out distinct silver minei als. 

The same observations apply to gold, but in a much greater degree, 
since gold is so much more valuable, and in some cases can be extracted 
at much less expense than silver; this is especially the case with the 
hydraulic gravels of California, where, in some instances, an average 



156 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

value of five or six cents worth of gold in a cubic yard of the gravel has 
yielded a profit. 

The gangue or material carrying the valuable mineral varies greatly, 
and exercises much influence upon the processes to be followed in the 
extraction of the metal. 

In many cases an ore contains more than one valuable metal, and, fre- 
quently, long and costly operations are required to separate the different 
metals, while in other cases their separation is quite easy, and in some 
cases a useful alloy can be smelted directly from ores containing more 
than one metal. 

After the ore is mined it is frequently subjected to some kind of a con- 
centrating process in preparation for smelting ; these processes vary 
from simple sorting by hand, whereby much worthless material is re- 
moved, to very elaborate treatment by machinery, whereby the valuable 
portion of the ore is concentrated to a smaller volume and weight, gen- 
erally with a loss of a small portion of the valuable constituents, and the 
waste material is rejected, and in some cases, ores of different metals oc- 
curring together are separated from each other. Illustrations of these 
processes form the next step in the series, and consist of the ores as 
mined, and the products of each step in the dressing operations, includ- 
ing both the valuable and the waste products. 

The final step of the series represents the processes of extracting the 
metals from their ores and converting them into useful forms. These 
collections include the ores, the fuels, the fluxes, and all other materials 
entering into the operation. Where there are different stages in the 
operation, each stage is fully represented. 

The non-metallic ores are treated in the same general way as the me- 
tallic ores. 

The collections shown at the New Orleans exposition have been ex- 
panded to over 3,000 specimens, and the collections described are but 
a beginning. While generally complete in themselves, they will require 
many additions to even approach a full illustration of the subjects. 

After this catalogue had been prepared 1,840 labels were written for 
the new material added to the collections. 

During the year 139 accessions were received. Of these the most im- 
portant were : 

A large amount of tin ore and its associates from the Irish Creek lo- 
cality in Rockbridge County, Virginia, presented by Mr. E. Willis, of 
Charleston, South Carolina. 

A large collection representing the iron resources of Louisiana and 
Texas, containing many specimens of ore and pig-iron, and a few speci 
mens of coal, presented by Prof. L. C. Johnson, U. S. Geological Survey 

A large amount of the nickel and cobalt ores from Lovelock, Nevada 
containing both the sulphide ore, and ores consisting essentially of ox 
idized decomposition products, presented by George Lovelock, sr., Eeno 
Nevada. 



DEPARTMENT OF METALLURGY AND ECONOMIC GEOLOGY. 157 

A full series of chromium ores, presented by the Tyson Manufacturing 
Company, Baltimore, Maryland. 

A full series illustrating the smelting of iron at the Pennsylvania 
furnaces of Eobert Hare Powels' Sons & Co., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 

A complete and very valuable collection illustrating the smelting of 
silver-lead or base bullion at the Colorado Smelter, South Pueblo, Col- 
orado, presented by Mr. Anton Eilers, South Pueblo, Colorado. 

This last collection is exceedingly full and complete, and is accompa- 
nied by a description of the process, with diagrams and many analyses, 
which render it especially valuable. It well illustrates the kind of col- 
lections that it is desirable for the department to gather in order to com- 
plete the systematic series. 

The ores as received at the works are classified into oxidized and sul- 
phureted ; the oxidized ores are further divided into basic and silicious, 
that is, basic ores, the gangue of which is essentially a base, and silicious 
ores, the gangue of which is essentially acid or silica ; these are sent di- 
rectly to the shaft furnaces. The sulphureted ores are also divided into 
basic and silicious. In this case, however, it is the ores that are high 
in sulphur that are called basic, for the reason on roasting they furnish 
mainly oxides, which act as bases in the smelting operation. The sili- 
cious sulphureted ores consist essentially of quartz, with only a small 
amount of sulphides ; they are generally very rich in silver and poor in 
lead, being more nearly true silver ores. 

The basic sulphureted ores are separated into coarse and fine. The 
coarse are roasted in stalls and then go to the shaft furnaces ; the fine 
are roasted in reverberatory furnaces, and are sometimes fused at the 
end of the roasting and sometimes not. From the roasting furnaces 
they go directly to the shaft furnaces. 

The silicious sulphureted ores are sometimes roasted in the fusion 
furnace, but they are generally sent to the shaft furnaces, especially 
when they are very rich in silver. 

The fluxes are all basic, and consist of iron ores and limestone, and 
go direct to the shaft furnaces. 

The products of the smelting in the blast furnaces are: 

Base Bullion, the valuable product which goes to market. 

Slag, containing the earthy constituents of the furnace charge — 
divided into clean, or free from lead and silver, which is thrown over 
the dump; and impure, that is, containing lead and silver, which goes 
back to the shaft furnaces. 

Matte, a by-product, essentially a sulphide of iron and copper, which 
goes to the roasting stalls and then back to the shaft furnaces. 

Speiss, a by-product, essentially an arsenide of iron, which goes to 
the roasting stalls and then back to the shaft furnaces. 

Flue dust, deposited in the flues of the furnaces, which is mixed with 
lime and ores low in lead, roasted in the fusion furnace, and then goes 
back to the shaft furnaces. 



158 KEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

Accretions, which are deposits formed upon the walls of the furnaces ; 
these are assorted according to their characteristics, and then go back 
to the shaft furnaces. 

The bullion from these furnaces holds a high position with the re- 
fineries on account of its freedom from impurities, due to the purity of 
the ores of the Madonna mine, which form a large proportion of the 
charge in the shaft furnaces. It varies in richness, although it gen- 
erally carries 300 ounces of silver per ton, and about an ounce of gold. 
It is cast into bars or pigs weighing 98 pounds, and is shipped from the 
furnace in car-loads of 300 bars. 

By far the greater number of accessions are specimens sent in for 
examination and report, 80 reports, covering 186 specimens, having 
been made. 

In cataloguing the collection, 671 entries, covering 1,266 specimens, 
having been made, and during the year 1,358 cards added to the cata- 
logue ; 1,840 labels have been written ; 14 boxes of duplicates and 
reserve material have been sent to general storage; 242 specimens have 
been sent out in exchange. 

The total number of specimens in the collection is about 49,000, of 
which 18,000 are on exhibition, 12,000 are duplicates, 7,000 reserves, 
the balance consisting of specimens as yet unadministered upon, and 
which are at present classed with the reserve series.

CRADLES OF THE AMERICAN ABORIGINES/ 



By Otis T. Mason. 



Many questions in anthropology depend for their answer upon a cor- 
rect knowledge of the manner in which the child passes the first year 
of its life. 

It is cominonly believed that the shape of the head and, indeed, of 
the whole frame is modified by the cradle. From time to time the 
National Museum at Washington has come into possession of cradles 
and cradle-frames from the farthest north of their limit to the farthest 
south. A description of these with accurate drawings is herein given 
in order to throw further light upon the problem. 

Deformation of the head, as is well known, is both designed and un- 
designed. Among the Chinuks and other tribes near the mouth of the 
Columbia River and northward, flattening of the head was intentionally 
practiced in a manner to be hereafter described. 

Undesigned head- shaping is believed to have resulted among the 
Mound people as well as among our modern Indians, especially in the 
occipital region, from the contact of the soft and pliable head of the 
infant with the cradle-board or frame, even with the downy pillow. 

In both Americas the majority of aboriginal children were confined 
in some sort of cradle from their birth until they were able to walk 
about. The cradle during this period serves many purposes : 

(1) It is a mere nest for the helpless infant. 

(2) It is a bed so constructed and manipulated as to enable the child 
to sleep either in a vertical or a horizontal position. 

(3) It is a vehicle in which the child is to be transported, chiefly on 
the mother's back by means of a strap over the forehead, but frequently 
dangling like a bundle at the saddle-bow. This function, of course, 
always modifies the structure of the cradle, and, indeed, may have 
determined its very existence among nomadic tribes. 

* I wish to express ruy sincere thanks to Dr. J. H. Porter for the valuable notes 
and references which accompany this paper. o. T. M.

162 KEPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

(4) It is indeed a cradle, to be hung upon the limbs to rock, answer- 
ing literally to the nursery rhyme : 

Eock a-bye baby upon tbe tree top, 
When the wind blows the cradle will rock, 
When the bough bends the cradle will fall, 
Down will come baby, and cradle, and all. 

(5) It is also a play-house and baby-jumper. On many, nearly all, 
specimens may be seen dangling objects to evoke the senses, foot-rests 
by means of which the little one may exercise its legs, besides other 
conveniences anticipatory of the child's needs. 

(6) The last set of functions to which the frame is devoted are those 
relating to what we may call the graduation of infancy, when the pap- 
poose crawls out of its chrysalis little by little, and then abandons it 
altogether. The child is next seen standing partly on the mother's 
cincture and partly hanging to her neck or resting like a pig in a poke 
within the folds of her blanket. 

An exhaustive treatment of this subject would include a careful 
study of the bed and especially of the pillow, in every instance, as well 
as of the frame. But collectors have been extremely careless in this 
regard. Very few cradles in the National Museum are accompanied 
with the beds and pillows. Were it not that here and there a traveler 
or a correspondent had made observations on the field, a hopeless la- 
cuna would be in our way. Much remains to be done exactly at this 
point, and future investigators must turn their attention to this subject 
especially. 

In this investigation much depends upon the age at which the child 
is placed in the cradle, the manner of bandaging and of suspending. 
Also there are a thousand old saws, superstitions, times and seasons, 
formularies, rites and customs hovering around the first year of every 
child's life in savagery that one should know, in order to comprehend 
many things attached to the cradle and its uses. Indeed, no one but 
an Indian mother could narrate the whole story in detail. Awaiting 
information from these sources, we shall describe as faithfully as pos- 
sible the material now stored in the National Museum. 

The method pursued in this description is that adopted in the series 
already begun in the report of 1884. The design is to apply the rules 
and methods of natural history to the inventions of mankind. We fol- 
low up the natural history of each human want or craviug or occupa- 
tion separately with a view to combining them into a comparative psy- 
chology as revealed in things. 

Again, Bastian's study of "great areas" finds a beautiful illustration 
at this point in the fact that the cradle-board or frame is the child of 
geography and of meteorology. In the frozen North the Eskimo mother 
carries her infant in the hood of her parka whenever it is necessary to 
take it abroad. If she used a board or frame the child would perish 
with the cold. Indeed, the settled condition of the Eskimo does away 
with the necessity of such a device. 



CRADLES OF THE AMERICAN ABORIGINES. 163 

It is somewhat difficult to mark the southern limit of the cradle frame 
owing to the great elevations in Mexico and middle America. The Na- 
tional Museum does not possess a cradle frame of any tribe living south 
of the northern tier of Mexican States until we cross the equator. The 
most southern tribes of Mexico from which specimens have come, are 
the Pimas, Yumas, and Yaquis. It is not here denied, however, that 
tribes farther south use this device. 

No attempt is here made to exhaust the study of child life in sav- 
agery. All who read this paper are doubtless familiar with the work 
of Dr. Ploss, entitled " Das Kind."* 

The most exhaustive analysis of the subject will be found in the 
treatise of Dr. E. Pokrooski, of Moscow, published in the fourteenth 
volume of the Transactions of the Society of Friends of Natural Sci- 
ence, Anthropology, etc. The work is devoted especially to the differ- 
ent peoples of Russia. The table of contents is here appended because

ESKIMO CRADLES.* 

The Hyperboreans or Eskimos skirt the Arctic coast in Greenland, 
Labrador, the islands north of Canada, at the month of the Mackenzie 
River, all around Alaska to Mount St. Elias. In all of these areas the 
mother has the hood of her skin robe or parka made very large, so as 
to carry therein her babe, which nestles around the mother's neck 
secure from the cold. (Figs. 1 and 2.) The home life of the Hyperbo- 
reans is more permanent in its character than that of the southern 
Indians. There is provision made in the huts of the Eskimo for any 
babies that may be present. 

The Indians contiguous to the Eskimo in Alaska and northeastern 
Canada belong to the great TinnC'an or Athapascan stock. They are 
called Kutchin in Alaska, and in the basin of the Mackenzie River have 
names ending with tena or dene, or an equivalent vocable. In the lan- 
guage of the Hudson Bay fur traders they bear various titles, most of 

* Lyon, Capt. G. F. (Private Journal, i. e. of Parry's Arctic Ex., London, 1824, 
8vo), remarks that the Eskimo women of Savage Islands had large hoods for the pur- 
pose of carrying their young children stark naked against the back (p. 20). Of the 
Eskimo in general he says that they have "slightly bowed" legs (p. 318). Their feat- 
ures of the face are diversified in an extraordinary manner (p. 309). About a sixth 
part * * * had high Roman noses (p. 310). Everywhere the hood answers the 
purpose of a child's cradle (p. 315). 

Rink, Dr. Henry (Danish Greenland, London, 1877, 12mo) asserts that the exter- 
nal curvature of the legs is general among Eskimo women of middle age, and that it 
is due to the cramped position in which they sit on the ledge in the hut (p. 154). 

Heriot, G. (Travels through the Canadas, London, 1807, 4to) describes the " Eski- 
maux" women of Newfoundland as having "their capuchina * * * much larger

The Tinnean tribes use some sort of device in which to lash their 
children during the first year. One should expect, however, to find 
these Indians also copying the Eskimo cradle hood, f Strachan Jones, 

towards their shoulders" than those of the men, "in order to cover their children 
when they wish to carry them on their backs " (p. 23). 

Franklin, C apt. J. (Narrative of Second Expedition, London, 1828, 4to) : The same 
kind of hood, for the same purpose as that among the Loucheux, was seen in use 
among the Eskimo women naar the mouth of the Mackenzie, on the Arctic coast (p.

t Cradles (Dixon's Voyage, p. 239) : It might be imagined that the children of 
these savages would enjoy the free and unrestrained use of their limbs from their 
earliest infancy. This, however, is not altogether the case. Three pieces of bark are 
fastened together, so as to form a kind of chair. The infant, after being wrapped in 
furs, is put into this chair, and lashed so close that it can not alter its posture, even 
with struggling, and the chair is so contrived that when a mother wants to feed her 
child, or give it the breast, there is no ocasion to release it from its shackles. Soft 
moss is used by the Indian nurse to keep her child clean ; but little regard is paid to 
this article, and the poor infants are often terribly excoriated ; nay, I have frequently 
seen boys of six or seven years old whose posteriors have borne evident maiks of this 
neglect in their infancy. 

Franklin, Capt. J. (Narrative of Second Expedition, London, 1828, 4to): The hood 
of the dress among the Lower Loucheux women is "made sufficiently wide to admit 
of their carrying a child on their back" (p. 28).

an infant sitting on a diminutive lt bedstead," having a soft fur seat. 

The body of the child is bandaged to the high back of the seat. (Fig. 3.) 
The same observation just made concerning the 
Eskimo is true of the Indians on the Upper Yukon. 
Dr.Dall informsmethat their homes are permanent, 
and that there therefore is no need of the cradle- 
frame. The infant, if lashed at all, is fastened in a 
kind of coal-scuttle-shaped cradle, and at night 
sleeps in a hammock or on the banquette.

pieces, forming, respectively, the bottom, the top and hood, and the

basting of pine root, with stitches half an inch long. Around the bor-

Mackenzie, he speaks of coast Eskimo women who " draw their children out of 
their wide boots, where they are accustomed to carry them naked" (i, p. 226). 
Franklin, Parry, Back, Richardson, and the more modern explorers, speak of the flat 
nose of the Eskimo. As in Oceanica this may be the result of compression, since Sir 
John Ross (Voyage to Baffin's Bay, London, 1819, 4to) found "small straight" noses 
and "large aquiline" noses among the Arctic Highlanders of Prince Regent's Bay 
(pp. 126, 127). 

Holmberg says of the Koniagas (Eskimos"), that the posterior part of the head is 
"not arched, but flat." The description of their huts and sleeping places suggests 
that this may be the effect of hard pillows or head-rests on an incompletely ossified 
skull. (Bancroft, Nat. Races of Pacific States, vol. I, p. 72.) 

Ledyard, who accompanied the expedition of Captain Cook to the North Pacific, 
noticed the bowed legs of the Aleuts, and attributed it to their position in the boats, 
in which they spend so much of their time. (Bancroft, Nat. Races of Pacific States, 
vol. I, p. 88.)

159). " The infant is carried naked in the mother's hood, yet in close contact with the 
parent's skin " (vol. I, p. 189). Compression of head (vol. II, p. 313). This is lateral, 
made by the hands, and by a skin cap. But no cap could exert lateral pressure, and 
the words " a little skin cap placed lightly over the compressed head, which is to be 
kept there one year" (vol. n, p. 313), may not convey this idea. 

Hearne, Samuel, in the narrative of his journey from Prince of Wales Fort, in Hud- 
son Bay, to the Northern Ocean (London, 1795), informs us that no cradles are in use 
among the northern Indian tribes between 59° and 68° north. He says that the major- 
ity of the children are bow-legged from the way in which they are carried. 

Portlock, in his Voyage Round the World (London, 1789), makes observations on 
the general distortion of the legs among Indians of Prince William's Sound (p. 248).

der of the body aud just under the margin, continuing around the bor- 
der of the hood and awning, lies a rod ot osier. A strip of birch bark 
laid on the upper and inner side of the margin serves as a stiffener. It 
is sewed down by an ingenious bast- 
ing, with stitches an inch or more 
long, which pass down through the 
two thicknesses of birch bark, 
around the osier twig that lies just 
below the margin, and up again 
through the two thicknesses of birch 
bark by another opening, to com- 
mence the next stitch. The hood is 
formed by puckering the birch bark 
after the manner of a grocer's bag. 
The bordering osier is neatly sewed 
to the edge of the hood and awning 
by a coil of split spruce root. Rows 
of beads of many colors adorn the 
awning piece. In a country intol- 
erable by reason of mosquitoes it is 
not strange that provision for sus- 
taining some sort of netting should 
have been devised. Playthings of 
various kinds are also hung to this 
awning for the hands and eyes and 
ears of the infant occupant, and it 
is quite sure that this bow or hood 
saves the face of the child many 
hurtful blows from a fall.* 

232.) (Voyages, etc.). Captain King states that he observed the custom of carrying 
children in the hood among the Chuckchees of the east coast (xvi, 3(54, note). On the 
other coast Captain Cook remarked of the dresses at Prince William's Sound that 
" some " only had hoods (xvi, 280). 

*Long, J. (Voyages and Travels of an Indian Interpreter, London, 1791, 4to) : He 
describes the cradle of the Chippewas, who range north to the Arctic Circle ; describes 
also the position and mode of carrying the child, aud its swathing; states that before 
the French occupation of Canada there were no swathings in use, failing material for 
them (pp, 60, 01). Before the French period the cradle was " a trough filled with dry 
rotten-wood dust," in which the baby, "covered with furs," was " kept until weaned" 
(p. 51). The head of the child in the Chippewa cradle is protected by a hoop (p. 60).

the shore of Great Slave Lake he saw infants " swaddled and unable to stir."

Boss, in describing the Eastern Tinneh, says:* "Among the Eastern 
Tinned, immediately after birth, without washing, the infant is laid 
naked on a layer of moss in a bag made of leather, and lined with hare- 
skins. If it be summer the latter are dispensed with. This bag is 
then securely laced, restraining the limbs in natural positions, and 
leaving the child freedom to move the head only. In this idiase of its 
existence it resembles strongly an Egyptian mummy." Cradles are 
never used; but this machine, called a "moss bag," is an excellent ad- 
junct to the rearing of children up to a certain age, and has become 
almost if not universally adopted in the families of the Hudson Bay 
Company's employes. The natives retain the use of the bag to a late 
period, say until the child passes a year, during which tinie it is never 
taken out except to change the moss. To this practice, continued to 
such an age, I attribute the turned toes and rather crooked legs of 
many of these Indians. One is somewhat reminded by this process of 
the Eskimo sleeping-bag. In the National collection are several small 
bags of the same pattern, but the label does not authorize the conclusion 
that these small bags were used as cradles for infants. 

Bordering the Eskimo in the Labrador Peninsula live the Naskopi or 
Scoffies, in latitude as far north as 53 degrees. Lucien Turner spent two 
years among them, and has collected much precious information. He tells 
us that when the Naskopi child is born it is not washed or allowed to 

made of a piece of leather. * * * Some moss is laid in the bottom of this hag, the 
child is laid into it, and moss is inserted between its legs. The bag is then laced to 
the fore side of the child as high as its neck. This bag is laid upon a board, to which 
it is fastened by means of a strip of leather" (p. 316). Further details of arrangement? 
ornamentation, and nursing (pp. 316, 317). 

Mackenzie, Sir A. (Voyages from Montreal to the Frozen and Pacific Oceans, Lon- 
don, 1801, 4to): Descriptive of the "swaddling-board" used by the Beaver Indians 
(p. 149). 

N. B. — This board, about 2 feet long, covered with a bed of moss, to which it (the 
child) is fastened by bandages "was in use in a sub-arctic climate"! Equally op- 
posed to Hearne's statement concerning the absence of cradles in these regions is 
Mackenzie's full description of a board cradle "in which the child, after it had been 
swathed, is placed on a bed of moss." Head compression practiced here, i. e., near 
Northwest coast; tribe not named (p. 371). It is to be remarked that Mackenzie 
speaks of this last as a "neiv kind of cradle," the inference being that the Beaver 
"swaddling-board" was used by the Chippewa, Knisteneaux, Assiniboines, etc. 

Fitz William (Northwest Passage by Land, p. 85) says that the cradle is "a board 
with two side flaps of cloth, which lace together up the center. The child is laid on 
its back on the board, packed with soft moss, and laced firmly down with its arms to 
its sides, and only the head at liberty. The cradle is slung on the back of the mother 
when traveling, or reared against a tree when resting in camp, the child being only 
occasionally released from bondage for a few moments. The little prisoners are re- 
markably good ; no squalling disturbes an Indian camp." 

Whymper (Alaska, p. 229): "The Tenan Kutchin (Tinneh) children are carried 
in small chairs made of birch bark." Richardson (Journal I, 384) makes the same 
statement. Bancroft (Nat. Races, etc. I, 131) says: "The women carry their infants 
in a sort of bark saddle, fastened to the back; they bandage their feet in order to 
make them small."

take the breast until three days have elapsed ; it is considered to weaken 
the infant if permitted to take the breast before that time. The mother 
prepares sphagnum moss by beating it until it becomes quite soft and 
fluffy. A portion of this moss is placed about the child, and it is then 
wrapped in clothes or skins. The swaddling process begins at the feet 
and wraps the lower limbs close together; the trunk is also swathed as 
far as the neck, until the child resembles a cocoon. At earliest infancy 
the arms are wrapped next the body, but when several months old those 
limbs are free, except at night. The reason of this is to make them 
grow straight and afford the mother convenience in handling them 
when on a journey, or to prevent them from rolling about the tent and 
into the fire. The bandages are removed once a day and a clean 
quantity of moss supplied. Water is never given to the child to drink 
until it is old enough to help itself — an occasion of remark among the 
women — for it marks an event in the infant's life. 

Figure 5 is from a sketch in the Century Magazine, taken at Cape 
Breton, and gives us an excellent example of the combinations which

civilization entails. The wigwam is to the manner born, the hammock 
reminds one of the far south, while the baby, ensconced in fur and 
blankets, without a pretense of lashiug, points to Eskimo as well as 
white man's methods. Dr. Ball's remark about the Alaska Indian fash 
ion of the hammock may be recalled here.

their arts to the splendid forests of pine and cedar which cover their 
lands. The Bellachoola or Bilkhula belong - to the great Salishan stock. 
Their home is in the vicinity of Bentinck Arm. The cradle of this peo- 
ple is probably a fair sample of that used by the stocks north and south 
of the Bilkhulas (Fig. G). It is a trough-shaped frame of cedar wood 
made in two pieces, as follows : The bottom and head-board are in one 
piece about one-half or three-quarters inch thick. The two sides and 
foot are also in one piece. The angles and the bends near the child's 
knees are effected by scarfing thewood almost through on the inside 
and boiling and bending it into shape. In this art these Indians are 
very expert, making great numbers of boxes for food and clothing, with

joints invisible on the outside. The joints of this cradle are united by 
means of small withes of willow. The characteristic marks are a flat 
bottom; head-board, like a little grave-stone, painted in red and black 
with conventional symbol of a totem. Two streaks of red paint skirt 
the upper margin of the sides. The change in the angle of convergence 
of the sides near the child is effected by scarfing and bending. The 
bed consists of a mass of finely shredded cedar bark. This is overlaid 
with some kind of sheet of cloth or fur, and the lashing passes through

holes in flaps of raw-hide, in place of the series of eyelet loops occurring 
on cradles farther south. 

In the commencement of this article two kinds of deformation were 
mentioned, the designed and the undesigned. Thefirst-mentioned method 
is found in British Columbia, on its western border, and in our domain 
along the coast of Washington and Oregon. On the extreme north- 
west corner of Washington live the Makahs, a people associated with 
the Ahts on Vancouver Island, and belonging to the Nutkan or Waka- 
shan stock. Living as they do in the great cedar region, their cradle 
would naturally be similar to those of the Indians living farther north. 

It is a trough rudely hewed out of cedar wood. (Fig. 7.) A low bridge 
is left across the trough to strengthen it. Slats are put across to level 
of height of bridge. The bedding consists of mats of cedar bark. On 
the lower end of the cradle is a handle. Around the sides are fastened 
strings. The compress is fastened to head of cradle. It curves over 
and is tightened by means of cords to the sides of the cradle. It is 
woven of, and stuffed tightly with, cedar bark. These cradles are sus- 
pended by strings to pliant poles, swung by the mother with her hand 
or great toe. 

Another cradle-trough in the National Museum, said to have come 
from Oregon Territory, is a block of cedar wood 30 inches long and 12 
inches square, roughly hewn in shape of a boat, with bulging sides. 
At the foot, on the outside, is carved a handle, function not known. The 
bed is shredded cedar bark, and the covering a quilt of the same mate- 
rial, roughly held together by twined weaving; a long pad is hinged to 
the head-board, and so arranged as to be drawn down over the child's 
forehead and lashed to either side of the trough. There is evident con- 
nection between the boats of the Northwest and the cradles. An inter- 
esting feature about this form of cradle is the appliances for lashing 
the child : 

(1) A series of holes along the side, just below the margin, parallel 
with the border most of the way, but sloping quite away from it at the 
head. 

(2) A cord of coarse root laid along over these holes on the outside 
of the cradles. 

(3) On either side the standard series of loops for the lacing-string 
is formed by passing a twine through the first hole, around the root cord 
on the outside, back through the same hole up to the middle of the 
cradle to form a loop, back through the next hole in the same manner. 

(4) The lacing-string runs through these loops alternately from bot- 
tom to top. The ornamentation of this type of cradle is chiefly by 
means of parti-colored basketry and furs. The Ohinuks were an ad- 
vanced people in art, and many of their cradles were very prettily 
adorned. Mr. Catlin figured one in which the process of head-flattening 
is going forward. 

In Mayne's "British Columbia and Vancouver's Island" we read that 



172 BEPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

the child lies at. full length, and the sides of the cradle are suffi- 
ciently high to enable the mother to lace it in by a cord passed from 
side to side, a small block being put at one end as a pillow. When the 
mother is traveling she carries the cradle on her back in nearly an up- 
right position, with the head appearing just above her shoulders. But 
if she is working she suspends the infant from the pliant branch of a 
tree, or, sticking the pole in the ground at a slight angle, hangs the 
cradle, sometimes upright, sometimes horizontally, on the end of it. 
They move pole and cradle so as to keep it near them, and every now 
and then give it a swing so that it rocks up and down. It is said that 
when children die they are put in some lake or pool, in their cradle, and 
left to float, the water being regarded as sacred ever after. 

Swan, in his "Indians of Cape Flattery,"* says: "The practice of 
flattening the heads of infants, although not universal among the Ma- 
kahs, is performed in a manner similar to that of the Ohinuks and 
other tribes in the vicinity of the Columbia River. As soon as a child 
is born it is washed with warm urine, and then smeared with whale oil 
and placed in a cradle made of bark, woven basket fashion, or of wood, 
either cedar or alder, hollowed out for the purpose. Into the cradle a 
quantity of finely separated cedar bark of the softest texture is first 
thrown. At the foot is a board raised at an angle of about 25 degrees, 
which serves to keep the child's feet elevated, or when the cradle is 
raised to allow the child to nurse, to form a support for the body, or a 
sort of seat. This is also covered with bark (he-se-vu). A pillow is 
formed of the same material, just high enough to keep the head in its 
natural position, with the spinal column neither elevated nor depressed. 
First the child is laid on its back, its legs properly extended, its arms 
put close to its sides, aud a covering either of bark or cloth laid over it; 
and then, commencing at the feet, the whole body is firmly laced up, so 
that it has no chance to move in the least. When the body is well se- 
cured, a padding of he-se-yu is placed on the child's forehead, over which 
is laid bark of a somewhat stiffer texture, aud the head is firmly lashed 
down to the sides of the cradle; thus the infant remains, seldom taken 
out more than once a day while it is very young, and then only to wash 
it and dry its bedding. The male children have a small opening left in 
the covering, through which the penis protrudes, to enable them to void 
their urine. The same style of cradle appears to be used whether it is 
intended to compress the skull or not, and that deformity is accom- 
plished by drawing the strings of the head-pad tightly and keeping up 
the pressure for a long time. Children are usually kept in these cradles 
till they are a year old, but as their growth advances they are not tied 
up quite so long as for the first few months. The mother, in washing 
her child, seldom takes the trouble to heat water; she simply fills her 
mouth with water, and when she thinks it warm enough spirts it on 
the child and rubs it with her hand."

Inhabiting the lower parts of the Columbia are a small tribe who cor- 
rectly come under the name of Flat Heads, as they are almost the only 
people who strictly adhere to the custom of squeezing and flattening the 
head. 

The process of flattening consists in placing the infant on a board, 
to which it is lashed by means of thongs to a position from which 
it can not escape, and the back of the head supported by a sort of 
pillow, made of moss or rabbit-skins, with an inclined piece (as seen 
in the drawing), resting on the forehead of the child, being every 
day drawn down a little tighter by means of a cord, which holds it in 
its place until it at length touches the nose, thus forming a straight 
line from the crown of the head to the end of the nose. This process 
is seemingly a very cruel one, though I doubt if it causes much pain, 
as it is done in earliest infancy, while the bones are soft and easily de- 
pressed into this distorted shape, by forcing the occipital up and the 
frontal down.

. The skull at the top in profile will show a breadth of not more than 1£ 
or 2 inches, when in front view it exhibits a great expansion on the 
sides, making it at the top nearly the width of one and a half natural 
heads. 

By this remarkable operation the brain is singularly changed from 
its natural shape, but in all probability not in the least diminished 
or injured in its natural functions. This belief is drawn from the tes- 
timony of many credible witnesses who have closely scrutinized them 
and ascertained that those who have the head flattened are in no way 
inferior in intellectual powers to those whose heads are in their natural 
shape.

REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 



In the process of flattening the head there is another form of crib 
or cradle into which the child is placed, much in the form of a small 
canoe, dug out of a log of wood, with a cavity just large enough 
to admit the body of the child and the head also, giving it room to 
expand in width, while from the head of the cradle there is a sort of 
lever, with an elastic spring, that comes down on the forehead of the 
child and produces the same effect as the one I have described. The 
child is wrapped in rabbit-skins and placed in this little coffin-like 
cradle, from which it is not in some instances taken out for several 
weeks. 

The bandages over and about the lower limbs are loose and repeatedly 
taken off in the same day, as the child may require cleansing. But the 
head and shoulders are kept strictly in the same position, and the breast

given to the child by holding it up in the cradle, loosing the outer end 
of the lever that comes over the nose and raising it up or, turning it 
aside so as to allow the child to come at the breast without moving its 
head. The length of time that the infants are carried in these cradles 
is three, five, or eight weeks, until the bones are so formed as to keep 
their shape. 

This cradle has a strap that passes over the woman's forehead whilst 
the cradle rides upon her back, and if the child dies daring its subjection 
to this rigid mode its cradle becomes its coffin, forming a little canoe, in 
which it lies floating on the water in some sacred pool. (Catlin, vol. 
LI, p. 110.)

From the Oregon coast the Wilkes Expedition * brought a cradle 
which is shown in Fig. 9. The frame 
board is trowel or spade shape. The 
whole back and front are covered 
with buckskin. At a proper distance 
from the edges, the buckskin is sewed 
or lashed down, and the flaps form 
the inclosing wrappings of the child. 
A triangular "fly" covers the lower 
extremities. Compare this portion of 
the cradle with the Nez Percys (Sa- 
haptian) cradle described further on. 
The hood is of rawhide, overlaid with 
a cover of beaded buckskin. It can 
readily be seen that this hood may 
be drawn to any tension across the 
forehead of the infant. The ornamen- 
tation and the head-band or carrying- 
strap are similar to the same parts 
in other cradles. Wilkes (Explor. 
Exped., iv, 388) says: "At Niculuita 
Mr. Drayton obtained a drawing of 
a child's head that had just been 
released from its bandages, in order 
to secure its flattened appearance. 
Both parents showed great delight at 
the success they had met with in effect- 
ing this distortion." (See Fig. 10.) 

*Marchand (Voyages) reports that among the Thinkeets, infants are ''so excoriated 
by fermented filth, and so scarred by their cradle, that they carry the marks to the 
grave." (Bancroft, Nat. Races of Pacific States, vol. i, p. 112.)

in infancy among the Haidahs (Columbians). (Bancroft, Nat. Races, etc., 1, 158.) In 
their platform houses they slept on "cedar mats" (p. 161). 

Bancroft (Native Races of the Pacific States, N. Y., 1875, vol. i) : " The custom of 
flattening the head is practiced by the Nootkas in common with the Sound and 
Chinook families, but is not universal" (p. 180. See, also, note, p. 58). 

Bancroft (Native Races of the Pacific States, N. Y., 1875, vol. I, note, p. 177) 
quotes the accounts of Cook, Meares, Mofras, Macfie. Poole, Sutil y Mexicana, Mayne, 
and Scouler, to the effect that the Nootka Indians are bow-legged and intoed from 
boat work, and have deformed limbs from the effect of garters.

disappears at maturity " (p. 256). 

Macfie, M. (Vancouver Island and British Columbia, London, 1865) : Between 
lat. 53° 30' N. and rat. 46° N. the Indians of the northwest coast of America flatten 
the head, under the impression that the distortion is becoming (p. 441). 

Macfie (idem., p. 441) gives the following account of the process of head-flat- 
tening among the coast tribes: "The child, as soon as born, is placed in a cradle 
scooped out of a log of timber. This rude ark is flat at the bottom, and raised at the 
point where the neck of the child rests. A flat stone is fastened to the head of the 
infant in this posture by thin strips of twisted bark. In the situation indicated the 
child is kept till able to walk, and its forehead has been molded into the required 
shape." In the Quatsino district the skulls of the women have " a tapering Or coni- 
cal form" * * * produced by artificial means. Only the families of chiefs (tenass) 
and "gentlemen commoners" (tyhees) are permitted to modify the form of the 
head. 

Bancroft (Native Eaces of the Pacific States, N. Y., 1875, vol. i) : The Sound In- 
dians, among the Columbians, flatten the head, "but none carry the practice to such 
an extent as their neighbors on the south " (p. 210). 

Bancroft (Native Races of the Pacific States, N. Y., 1875, vol. I): Among the 
Chinooks the " legs are bowed and otherwise deformed by a constant squatting posi- 
tion in and out of their canoes" (p. 224). Head-flattening "seems to have origi- 
nated * * * about the mouth of the Columbia," and the Chinooks carry the cus- 
tom to an excess of deformity (p. 226). 

Banci'oft remarks that "the Chinook ideal of facial beauty is a straight line from 
the end of the nose to the crown of the head. The flattening of the skull is effected by 
binding the infant to its cradle immediately after birth, and keeping it therefrom 
three months to a year. The simplest form of cradle is a piece of board or plank, on 
which the child is laid upon its back with its»head slightly raised by a block of 
wood. Another piece of wood, or bark, or leather is then placed over the forehead 
and tied to the plank with strings, which are tightened more and more each day until 
the skull is shaped to the required pattern. Space is left for lateral expansion, and, 
under ordinary circumstauces, the child's head is not allowed to leave its position un- 
til the process is complete. The body and limbs are also bound to the cradle, but 
more loosely, by bandages, which are sometimes removed for cleansing purposes."

same authority says that the Clallauis, and in fact all the Sound Indians, 
flatten the head (243).* 

Mr. William Meinold, in sending to the National Museum the skull of 
a Flathead Indian from northwest Montana, writes as follows: " When 
the child is about one week old it is put on a board and tied hand and 
foot. A small bag of sand is tied over the forehead and remains in this 
position eight or ten days. It is then taken off for a short rest and 
afterwards fastened to the board again. This continues from six weeks 
to six months. The head then has its shape and grows in the right di- 
rection. The skull mentioned belonged to Eedgrass, a chief, who died 
about forty years ago. His body was deposited on posts 6 feet high. 
In his canoe were found beads, and a General Harrison badge of 1841.t

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 



The Hupa Indians of northwestern California belong to the Tinnean 
stock. They have been described in a paper entitled, " The Ray Col- 
lection in the U. S. National Museum."* Tne cradle-basket of the Hupas 
of northwestern California is a slipper shaped, open work basket oi 

osier warp, and twined weaving 
constitutes the body of the cradle. 
(Fig. 11.) It is woven as follows: 
Commencing at the upper end, the 
small ends of the twigs are held in 
place one eighth of an inch apart 
by three rows of twined weaving, 
followed by a row in which an ex- 
tra strengthening twig is whipped 
or sewed in place, as in the Makah 
basketry. At intervals of 2% to 3 
inches are three lows of twined 
basketry, every alternate seiies 
having one of the strengthening 
twigs, increasing in thickness 
downward. The twigs constitut- 
ing the true bottom of the so called 
slipper continue to the end of the 
square toe, and are fastened off, 
while those that form the sides 
are ingeniously bent to form the 
vamp of the slipper. This pai t of 
the frame is held together by rows 
of twined weaving (boustrophedon). 
When two rows of this kind of 
twining lie quite close it has the appearance of a four-ply plaiting, and 
has been taken for such by the superficial observer. 

The binding around the opening of the cradle is formed of a bundle 
of twigs seized with a strip of bast or tough root. 
The awning is made of open wicker and twined basketry, bound with 

by pressure of bead anklets (vol. n, p. 115). The Cookoooose, on the Pacific coast, do not 
flatten the head (vol. n, p. 119). It is stated that " the Killamucks,Clatsops,Chinnook8, 
and Cathlamaka * * * have thick ankles and crooked legs" due to " the uni- 
versal practice of squatting, * * * and also to the tight bandages of beads and 
strings worn around the ankles by the women," whose limbs are " particularly ill- 
shaped aud swollen." "The custom * * * of flattening the head by artificial 
pressure during infancy, prevails among all the nations we have seen west of the 
Rocky Mountains" (Snakes and Cookoooose they themselves except). "To the east 
of that barrier the fashion is * * * perfectly unknown." An error! "On the 
lower parts of the Columbia both sexes are universally flatheads; the custom dimin- 
ishes in receding eastwird, * * * till among the remoter tribes, near the mount- 
ains," the practice " is confined to a few females" (vol. n, pp. 130, 131).

colored grass. This pretty, flat cone resembles the salmon-baskets fig- 
ured and described in the Ray collection.* 

There is in the National Museum a cradle for a new-born babe, from 
the McOloud River Indians of California, belonging to the basket-tray 
type. It is shaped very much like a large grain-scoop or the lower 
half of.a moccasin inverted, and made of twigs in twined weaving. 
There are double rows of twining two inches or thereabouts apart, and 
nearly all of them are interlocked, which gives the appearance of a four- 
ply braid. The meshes form a diamond pattern by inclusion in the 
half turns of the twine quincuncially. 

The general shoe-shape of the cradle is produced by commencing at the 
heel,. which is here the bottom, and doubling the twigs by a continually 
sharper turn until along the bottom the rods simply lie parallel, that 
is, the rods that lie along the middle of the bottom terminate at the 
heel, while those that form the sides and upper end are continuous. 

Around the edge and forming a brace across the upper end is a 
border made of a bundle of rods seized with tough bast or split root.t 
The twigs themselves project upwards an inch or two from this brace, 
and are not fastened off. (Figs. 11 and 12.) 

The Modoc women make a very pretty baby-basket of fine willow- 
work, cylinder-shaped, with one-half of it cut away, except a few inches 
at the ends f It is intended to be set up against the wall or carried on 
the back ; hence the infant is lashed rjerpendicnlar in it, with his feet 
standing in one end and the other covering his head, like a small para- 
sol. In one that I saw this canopy was supported by small standards, 
spirally wrapped with strips of gay-colored calico, with looped and scal- 
loped haugings between. Let a mother black her whole face below the 
eyes, including the nose, shining black, thrust a goose quill 3 inches 
long through the septum of the nose, don her close-fitting skull cap and 
start to town with her baby-basket lashed to her back, and she feels the 
pride of maternity strong within her. The little fellow is wrapped all 
around like a mummy, with nothing visible but his head, and sometimes 
even that is bandaged back tight, so that he may sleep standing. 

From the manner in which the tender skull is thus bandaged back it oc- 
casionally results that it grows back ward and up ward at an angleof about 
45 degrees. Among the Klamath Lake Indians I have seen a man fifty 
years old, perhaps, whose forehead was all gone, the head sloping right

back on a line with the nose, yet his faculties seemed nowise impaired. 
The conspicuous painstaking which the Modoc squaw spends on her 
baby-basket is an index of her maternal love. Indeed the Modoc are 
strongly attached to their offspring. On the other hand a California 
squaw often carelessly sets her baby in a deep conical basket, the same 
in which she carried her household effects, leaving him loose and liable 
to fall out. If she makes a baby-basket it is totally devoid of orna- 
ment, and one tribe, the Mi-woh, contemptuously call it the dog's nest. 
It is among Indians like these that we hear of infanticide.

Frame of Pitt River Cradle. 

(Cat. No 21411, Round Valley, California. 
U.S.N.M. Collected by Stephen Powers.) 



The cradle of the Pitt River Indians is a transition between the forked 
stick and the ox-bow type. A pole of wood, with bark removed, is bent 
in the middle, the two ends crossed and lashed together. Across this 
primitive frame are laid broad laths, perforated at the corners, and lashed 
to the poles with buckskin strings (Fig. 13). The foot-rest is a block of 
wood 7 by 4 by f inches, perforated, and through it are passed the 
two ends of the pole. The convergence of the ends prevents the slip- 
ping down of this little platform. Comparing this cradle with one from 
the vicinity, called a cradle of a new-born pappoose, it will be seen that 
we have before us two extremes of a series, commencing with a mere 
tray for an absolutely helpless creature to a standing place for a child 



CRADLES OF THE AMERICAN ABORIGINES. 181 

just ready to learn to walk. Regarding the cradle in the light of a 
chrysalis, we discover not only the tiny creature within has passed 
through wonderful changes, but that the encapsulating cradle has passed 
from a horizontal to a vertical function. It was first a trough to be 
firmly lashed in ; it ends with being a frame on which the juvenile In- 
dian takes his stand prior to taking his flight into the realm of self-sup- 
port. Compare this device with the practice of the Pimo and Yuma 
children of standing upon the mother's cincture and grasping her neck 
or shoulders. Another Pitt River example is a cradle net or bag, the 
warp of coarse twine of milkweed fiber laid close together and joined 
by twined weaving of finer twine, in double rows, an inch and a half 
apart. Some noteworthy features of this cradle are the following : 
The whole twining, from beginning to end, seems to be continuous, like 
plowing a series of double furrows. On the right edge the weaver sim- 
ply turned and weaved back alongside of the former twine; at the left 
edge she laid her twine by the side of her warp for an inch and a half, 
and then turned in for another double row. Indeed, it seems as though 
the whole cradle were made of one pair of twines. The hood is made 
by puckering the ends of the warp together and tying them, as with a 
bag-string. The part over the forehead is formed of a separate set of 
warp strands. The sun-shade is a round, disk-like structure of twined 
weaving. 

The Potter Valley cradle-trough is made of willow twigs laid closely 
together and held in place by an ingenious stitching, to be explained 
further on (Fig. 14). 

The head of the cradle is a hoop of wood 1 foot in diameter, quite 
open. It is fastened to the wicker-work by a continuous coil of twine 
passing around it and between the willow rods consecutively, being 
caught over the curious braid that holds the twigs together. In the 
example described the lashing is cotton string, but in a more primitive 
form it would be sinew or grass cord. The ends of the twigs are cut 
off flush with the hoop. The sides and bottom of the cradle are scoop- 
shaped, with high perpendicular sides, the twigs forming it all termi- 
nating at the head hoop. 

The rods of the cradle-frame are woven together by a series of braids 
about 2 inches apart. This braid is so constructed as to resemble two 
rows of coiled sewing on the inside and a close herring-bone on the out- 
side, and is made as follows: Commence one edge and carry the twine 
along three osiers, bending to the left, bringing it back two and through 
to the front, forward two, crossing number one ; through, back two, 
through to front, just over and over, forward three, back two, forward 
two, back two, ready to start again. 

Long leather loops are attached to the bottom of the cradle where it 
joins the upright sides to receive the lacing-string which holds the 
baby in place. 

The Tule and Tejon cradle-frame consists of three parts : the fonnda- 



182

tion, which is a forked stick : the cross-bars, lashed beneath, and the 
slat of twigs upon which the bed is laid. Some parts of this frame 
demand minuter description. The fork is a common twig, not neces- 
sarily symmetrical, with short handle and prongs nearly 3 feet long, 
spreading about 16 inches at the distal end or top. 




Fig. 14. 
Pomo Cradle. The Child sits in the rounded portion. 

(Cat. No. 21398, U. S. N. M. Porter Valley, California. Collected by Stephen Powers.) 

At the back of the fork are lashed seventeen rods of wood, projecting 
at their ends an inch or more beyond the fork. The lashing of the rods 
to the fork is by means of sinew skillfully crossed both in front and 
rear, that is, the seizing is partly parallel and partly cross laced to give 
the strongest joint. These wooden rods seem to follow a rude plan of 
pairs, but the design is not apparent. Between the upper pair is a 
third rod, whose function is to hold in place the slats in front. The 
slat- work or slats on the front consist of a separate transverse rod, to 
which about forty twigs are attached by bending the large end of each 
one around the rod and then holding the series in place by a row or 
two of twined weaving with split twigs. To fasten this crib-work in 
place the rod is put behind the two ends of the forked stick, and the 
twij^s laid in order oh the front of the series of transverse rods so as to 
fill neatly the space between the forks. These twigs are held in place 
by lashing them here and there to the transverse rods and to the side 



CRADLES OF THE AMERICAN ABORIGINES.

prongs. This lashing crosses the twigs diagonally in front and the 
rods behind vertically. 

The Mohave cradle-frame is a prettily-made ladder or trellis, built 
up as follows (Fig. 15): A pole of hard wood about 7 feet long is bent 




Fig. 15. 
Mohave Cradle, with Bed of sheedded baek. 

(Cat. No. 24146, U. S. N. M. Colorado River, Arizona. Collected by Edward Palmer.) 

in the shape of an ox bow, the sides 7 inches apart at top and 5J inches 
at bottom, so that the cradle is a little narrower at the foot. Eleven 
cross-bars, like ladder-rounds, connect and strengthen the frame, com- 
mencing at the bottom and ending near the bow. These rounds con- 
sist each of three elements: a rod or spreader between the two sides ; a 
strap-like binding of two or three split twigs clasping the sides and 
laid along on the spreader; a seizing of tough twigs holding fast the 
straps and spreader. The drawing of the reverse side clearly sets forth 
the manner of administering the light but strong cross-bracing. Upou 
this ladder is laid the cradle-bed of willow or mezquite bast, made as 
follows : Three bundles of stripped bast, each about an inch in diameter, 
are lashed at their middle with bast. They are then doubled together 
concentrically and spread out to form a bed. On this is laid a little 
loose, finely-shredded bast like a nest, and the bed is ready for the baby. 
A dainty quilt or counterpane of bast is made from strips 30 inches 
long, doubled and braided at the top like a cincture. This braiding is 



184 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

unique, and so very neatly done as to demand explanation. Two strips 
of bast are seized about their middle by a single twist of the two ele- 
ments of twined weaving. Of course two halves will project above and 
two below the twist. Lay two more strips of bast in the second bight 
of the twist and draw down the first two upper ends, one to the right of 
and the other betweeu the second pair of strips, seizing them in place 
by another half turn of the twines. Lay on a thin pair of bast strips 
and bring down the second pair of ends projecting upward, as at first. 
The weaving consists of four movements, namely: Laying in a pair of 
bast strips, grasping them with a half turn of the two twining wefts, 
bending down the two upward strips just preceding one betweeu the 
other outside of the last two strips ; and grasping them with a half turn 
of tbe twine. The lashing belts of this cradle are twelve to fifteen ply 
braids, made of red, green, white, and black woolen and cotton cords, 
braided after the manner of the peculiar type of ornamentation unde- 
signedly originated by braiding with threads of different colors. On 
this belt of several colors the threads are so arranged as to produce a 
continuous series of similar triangles, filling the space between two par- 
allel lines by having their bases above and below alternately. Now 
the gist of the ornamentation is the parallelism of the braiding threads, 
now to one side of the triangle, and in the next figure running in a di- 
rection exactly at right angles. One of the commonest ornaments on 
the pottery, rude stone, and carved wood is this distribution of lines in 
triangles. 

Of the Pimos, neighbors of the Mohaves, Dr. Palmer says, that on long 
journeys they use the cradle-board ; but as soon as a child is able to 
stand alone the Pimo mother allows it to mount upon the immense 
cincture of bark worn on her back and to grasp her around the neck.* 

The floor of the Yaqui cradle is of the slatteded type, 30 inches long. 
A dozen or more reeds, such as arrow-shafts are made of, are fastened 
in the same plane by a dowel-pin. The reeds are not bored for the pins, 
but simply notched in a primitive fashion. (Fig. 16.) 

There is no cradle-trough, but a bed of willow or other bast, shredded, 
is laid on longitudinally. The pillow consists of a bundle of little splints 
laid on transversely, at either end of which is a pad of rags. There is 
no awning; the lashing in this instance is a long cotton rag, taking 
the place of a leather strap, passing round and round baby and frame, 
and fastened off in a martingale arrangement, crossing the feet and tied 
to the lower corners of the cradle. Upon this cradle-rack or frame is. 
fastened the true cradle, which, in this instance, is a strip of coarse mat, 

*Bourke, Capt. J. G.: Speaking of the Umene of the Rio Helay, in 1824, who must 
have been the Yumas of the Rio Gila, Pattie says: "They contrive to inflict upon 
their children an artificial deformity. They flatten their heads by pressing a board 
upon their tender scalps, which they bind fast by a ligature. This board is so large 
and tight that I have seen women when swimming in the river with their children, 
towing them after them with a string which they held in their mouth. The little 
things neither suffered nor complained, but floated behind their mothers like ducks."

made of soft flags, a foot wide, joined by cross-rows of twined weaving 
2 inches apart. This mat is bordered by a braid of flags, and the two 
ends are puckered or drawn to a point. The cradle belongs to the open, 
unhooded type, and is made by doubling the matting at the head and 
drawing it together to a point at the foot. The two edges next to the 
cradle-frame are joined and fastened to the 
frame, while the outer edge is allowed to flare 
open. In this little ark of flags or rushes the 
baby is placed.* 

The children of the California peninsula 
stand and walk before they are a year old. 
When they are born they are cradled in the 
shell of a turtle or on the ground. As soon 
as the child is a few months old, the mother 
places it perfectly naked astraddle on her 
shoulders, its legs hanging down on both 
sides in front. In this guise the mother roves 
about all day, exposing her helpless charge 
to the hot rays of the sun and the chilly winds 
that sweep over the inhospitable country.t 

Like her white sister, the Indian mother (to 
be) in Montana and her friends make prepa- 
rations for the coming event by collecting 
cloths, and the board that the child is to pass 
so many hours of its first year of life on, 
which, if richly ornamented with beads, otter- 
skin, and fringes, with bells on them, is worth 
a good horse, which is generally what is given 
for the child's board or cradle. This is usually 
the case when the boy or girl is given and 
adopted by another mother. So an Indian 
child has generally two mothers, and of course two fathers, but the 
father has but little to do with the child till it is old enough to run 
around. 

When the child is born it is taken in charge by its adopted mother, 
or by a hired woman. It is washed, dried, then greased, and powdered 
with red ocher, then nursed by some Indian woman or its mother, and 
wrapped up, with its arms down by its side, in a buffalo-calf skin or 
shawl or small blanket, and placed in its board or cradle, to be taken

around to its relations' lodges for inspection. Every evening it is taken 
from its confinement to be washed, painted, and dressed again, and 
greased. The first cloth over its posterior is laid with a coating of dry 
pulverized buffalo dung or chips, and this is used as a white woman 
uses a diaper. 

As it grows older it is taken by its mother, placed up in the lodge or 
outside, while she goes about her work. If the child is restless it is 
nursed while on the board. After six to eight months of age the child 
is laid to sleep without the board, and it is generally discarded after a 
year old, though I have seen Indian boys and girls suckling at five and 
six years of age. An Indian child, like a white one, is pleased with 
toys, candy, etc., and their instincts are alike. They cry, laugh, are 
amused, frightened, and astonished, and as they are born and brought 
up so do they live. 

The board upon which a child is laid is covered with a tanned elk- 
skin or deer skin, and beads worked on it. The place where the child 
reposes is loose, and is laced and tied up when the child is placed in it.* 

The straps for carrying and suspending it are on the opposite side of 
the board, and in carrying, the strap is brought over the head and placed 
across the upper part of the breast and across the shoulders. This 
brings the board upon which the back of the child rests against the 
back of the mother. The board is one-quarter of an inch thick, from 
2| to 3 feet in length, and 1£ feet in bulge of board. 

The Nez Perce Indians belong to the Sahaptian stock, and were 
once a noble people, dwelling on the Snake Eiver and its affluents in 
Idaho. They have produced the historical character, Chief Joseph, but 
are now reduced to an enervated remnant dwelling on the Nez Perce 
Eeservation. The basis of the cradle is a rough board, generally hewn 
out, 3 feet high, 15 inches wide at the top, and not more than an inch 
thick. It is shaped somewhat like a tailor's sleeveboard, but is more 
tapering (Fig. 17). This board is covered with buckskin, drawn per- 
fectly tight upon the back and across the broad part of the front as far 
down as the hood, or about one-third the length. Below that the two 
edges of the buckskin form flaps, which meet nearly over the child. 
Along the edges of these flaps strings are looped, into which loops a 
lashing cord passes backward and foiward to inclose the child tightly 
in its capsule. On the top of the back a fringe of buckskin strings is 
formed, either by slitting the buckskin covering itself or by a separate 
strip sewed on at this point. A little above the center is sewed the head- 
strap of buckskin, to enable the mother to transport her child or to sus- 
pend it when at rest. The hood of the cradle is based upon the flaps of 
buckskin, but these are entirely concealed by the covering of flannel or 
other substance. The most ornamented portion of the cradle is the

part above the hood ; a piece of flannel or buckskin is covered with 
bead-work, solid, or has figures wrought upon it in various patterns. 
To the hood are attached medicine-bags, bits of shell, haliotis perhaps, 
and the whole artistic genius of the mother is in play to adorn her 
offspring. After the child is lashed in the cradle, a triangular flap of 
buckskin, also adorned with bead-work, is tied over the child to the 
buckskin flaps on either side. 

The Spokanes belong to the Salishan stock. They are described by 
Lewis and Clarke, by Governor Stevens (Rep. Ind. Aff., 1854), and by 
Winans. Living on the eastern border of the Salish area in Idaho and 
Washington Territory, their cradles are almost identical with those of 
the Nez Perces, just described.* Neither of the specimens contains 
a bed or a pillow, so that we are at a loss as to the effect of the cradle 
in occipital flattening. But we can be positive as to one thing, that 
in neither of these examples is there the least provision for intention- 
ally deforming the forehead. The Salish are frequently called Flatheads, 
but from the example of cradle furnished it seems that they are the

On the back is a long ornamental fringe at top, and lower clown both 
the head strap ami two extra straps at the margin to secure the cradle 
in other manipulations. The upper portion of the front is covered with 
bead- work, solid blue ground, with bird-shaped figures in amber and 
pink beads. On the light side of the hood hangs a long medicine bag 
of buckskin, adorned with light blue beads of large size. A newspaper 
correspondent from this region mentions a buckskin string upon these 
cradles in which a knot is tied for every moon of the child's life. There 
are little buckskin strings in the margin of this cradle near the hood, 
but no knots have been tied in either of the cradles here described. 

In these two, as in many others mentioned in this paper, there is a 
charming combination of the old and the new. The slab, the buckskin, 
the medicine-bag, the fringe, the lashing are all pre-Columbian. The 
beads, the flannel, the cloth lining, etc., are evidently derived ma- 
terially from the whites. There is no change of structure or function 
effected by any of these things. They simply replace other materials, 
such as quill- work, shell work, native cloth, fur or buckskin, in use be- 
fore the advent of the whites.

extent, crossing the Rockies on the east under the name of Comanches, 
and in southern California extending quite to the Pacific Ocean. Spread 
over such a vast territory, the Shoshonian cradle was modified here 
and there by the nature of things, by the contact of dominant tribes, 
and by changed habits of life. 

The tltes of Pyramid Lake, Nevada, make use of a flat wicker cradle- 
frame, kite-shaped or roughly triangular. The widening is effected by 
the intercalation of rods as they are wanted. At the top the rods are 
held in place by a cross-rod lashed to the ends of the parallel pieces. 
The twined weaving is characteristic of the Utes in all of their textiles. 
A pretty addition to the Ute cradle is the delicate awning of light wicker 
attached by its lower narrow border to the bed-frame and held at the 
proper angle by means of braces made of the same material (Figs. 19, 
20). 

Three specimens from this area are in the Museum, showing them as 
frame and as finished cradles. Indeed, we have only to cover the lat- 
tice with buckskin after the manner of those used by the Spokanes and 
the affair is complete. 

In the eastern portion of Utah once dwelt various tribes of Ute In- 
dians. In the National collection is a cradle from this region marked 
Uncompaghre Utes (Fig. 21). It is an old affair, showing scarcely a

sign of white contact, excepting a bunch of blue rag over the hood. 
The cradle is built upon a thin board 4 feet high, 18 inches wide at top, 
and tapering to half that width at bottom. The covering is of buck- 
skin, seamed on the back, and very clumsily put on. There are two 



190 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 



suspension straps, one near the top and the other very low down. On 
the front the buckskin has loose flaps to inclose the child. The hood or 
awning is a very curious affair, and if closely drawn down would cer- 
tainly give to the Uncompaghre child the forehead of a Flathead. It 
is a kind of tiara, made of little twigs lashed to stronger rods. The 
lower margin over the child's forehead is bound with soft buckskin 
The hard cradle-board allies it to the Northern type, where timber is 
larger, rather than to the pure Ute type, where a hurdle takes the 
place of the board. 

The cradle-frame of the Southern Utes is so well shown in the three 
drawings presented as not to need very minute description (Figs. 22, 
23, 24). The frame-work consists of three parts, the slats, the hoop,

and the hood. A dozen twigs like arrow-shafts, 4 feet long, are held 
in place by here and there a twine of basketry; across the portion to 
which the ends of the head-band are to be attached a rod is lashed to 
hold the lattice firmly in place. A hoop of twig, elliptical in form, is 
lashed to the frame wherever it touches and to the ends of the cross rod. 
To the upper border of the hoop is sewed an irregular quadrangular 
piece of twined basketry weaving. Its outer border is sewed to a rod, 
which is bent and fastened at its ends to the slats. This forms the 



CRADLES OF THE AMERICAN ABORIGINES. 191 

awning of the cradle. We are now ready for the cover, which is formed 
by a wide piece of the whitest buckskin, wrapped on as in making a 
bundle, sewed ou the back and slit open in front. The upper portion 
is cut into the neatest possible fringe. A broad head-band of soft buck- 
skin completes the outfit. A specimen from the same locality varies 
somewhat in detail. 

This cradle has the ox-bow frame lathed along the back with twigs 
close together and held in place by a continuous seizing of sinew. 
Although a rude affair, this fact is evidently due to the lack of material 
in a desert country rather than to want of taste in the maker. The awn- 
ing for the face is a band of wicker, 4 inches wide, attached by its ends 
to the side frame of the cradle. This band is of twined weaviug, the 
weft running boustrophedon. . Notice especially that each half turn of 
the twine takes in two warp twigs, and that when the weaver turned 
backward she did not inclose the same pairs of warp twigs, but twined 
them in quincuncially, creating a mass of elongated rhomboidal open- 
ings, exactly as the Aleutian Islanders weave their marvelously fine 
grass wallets, while the Ute weaviug is a model of coarseness in an iden- 
tical technique. 

The head-band of buckskin is not tied immediately to the bowed 
frame, but is knotted to a loop made of a narrow string, wound three 
times around the frame and knotted.* 

The elements of the Moki cradle-frame are the floor and the awning. 
As a foundation a stout stick is bent in shape of the ox-yoke bow. Eods 
of the size of a lead-pencil are attached to the curve of this bow and 
stretched parallel to the limbs of the bow. Twigs are closely woven on 
this warp by regular basketry weaving. The Moki are the only savages 
west of the Rocky Mountains who practice this real wicker weaving. 
The awning, as the drawing shows, is a band of the same kind of weav- 
ing on a warp of twigs in bunches of twos or threes, these last attached 
to blocks of wood at the ends of the fabric. The awning is bowed up- 
ward and the end blocks lashed to the upper portions of the limbs of 
the bow. A small aperture in the floor is for convenience in cleansing. 
The next figure shows how by using parti-colored and finer twigs, and 
by a different administration of the middle warp strands and the awn- 
ing, pretty varieties of the same style of cradle may be effected (Figs. 
25. 26). 

The Zufii cradle-board is worthy of our closest study (Fig. 27). It 
is founded on a rough piece of board, hewn out to an inch in thickness, 
3 feet long, and about a foot wide. A pillow-rest of wood is fastened 
so as to steady the head. This is pegged or nailed down to the board.

There is no buckskin covering, but a set of loops along the edges serve 
to accomplish the lashing. The most curious part of the apparatus is 
a series of four bows or half hoops of equal radius. These are woven to 
the side of the board, as indicated in the drawing. A string is tied to 
the top of the board and to each of the hoops at a certain distance, so 
that when the loose end of the string is pulled the hoops form a " buggy

top," or adjustable hood to the cradle. In no other cradle is the prob- 
lem more delicate. It depends almost entirely upou the bed to nullify 
the effects of this cradle. Without examining the heads of Zuiii Indians 
at all we ought to find the occiput pushed in, flattened, and asymmet- 
rical. Should they prove otherwise, it is right to assume a bed able to 
counteract this influence. 

The Apache Indians of Arizona and New Mexico* make a very 
elaborate cradle, the substantial part consisting of the frame and the 
hood. (Fig. 28, a b) The frame is elliptical in form, the outline being 
formed by a pole of wood bent and the two ends spliced and lashed. 
Upon this ellipse are laid laths of white pine, planed. Over the child's

face is built the hood formed by bending two bows of supple wood to 
the required shape and overlaying them with transverse laths of pine 
laid close together and tied down. The upper edges of these laths 
are beveled, so as to give a pretty 
effect to the curved surface. The 
leather-work on the cradle consists 
of a gable of white buckskin to the 
hood, a binding of brown buckskin 
on to the bowed frame above the 
hood, variegated with narrow bands 
of white buckskin, and, finally, the 
true sides or capsule of the cradle, 
consisting of a strip of soft brown 
buckskin, say 10 inches wide, cut in 
a fringe along its lower border and 
edged with fringe of white buckskin 
along its upper outer edge. This 
strip is fastened to the cradle con- 
tinuously, commencing at an upper 
margin of the awning, carried along 
this awning, fastened to. its lower 
margin 4 inches above the junction 
of the awning and frame, passes on 
to the foot and around to the other 
side, as at first. Slits are made in 
the upper edge of the brown buck- 
skin just below where the white 
buckskin fringe is sewed or run on, and back and forward through 
these slits a broad soft band of buckskin passes to form the cradle 
lashing. To perfect the ornamentation of this beautiful object, tassels 
of buckskin in two colors, and strings of red, white, and blue beads are 
disposed with great care. Thanks to the generosity of friends living 
on the frontier, it is possible to reproduce from photographs the method 
of fastening the child in the cradle. (Fig. 29.) A bed of fur lies between 
the back of the infant and the floor of the cradle. The head is perfectly 
loose and free during waking moments. Indeed, there is always free 
play to the child's head in all cradles except on the Pacific coast around 
the Columbia Eiver and Puget Sound. Another drawing (Fig. 30) 
exhibits the method of nursing the babe without removing it from the 
cradle. Finally, Fig. 31 shows an infant and a small child that have 
been subjected to the cradle-board. 

The cradle-frame of the Navajos is made of two pieces of wood lashed 

together so as to make the upper end or head in shape like a boot-jack. 

To the sides of these boards long loops of buckskin are attached to aid 

in the lashing (Fig. 32). A new feature in western cradles appears in

the specimen figured. It is the footboard, so common in all the Al- 
gonkin and Iroquois specimens. The pillow is to be noticed especially, 
consisting of soft furs and rags rolled up iu soft buckskin and fasteued 
to the board. The awning frame is a wide bow of thin, hard wood, 
over which falls a wide, long vail or flap of buckskin. This cradle was 
collected by Dr. R. W. Shufeldt, U. S. Array, who kindly made some 
investigations relative to the use aud effect of the Navajo cradle.

Of some two or three dozen children of all ages from the infant up- 
wards that I have examined I have yet to find a case wherein the Navajo 
mother has not taken the special precaution to place a soft and ample 
pad in the cradle to protect the back of the child's head. Moreover, 
I have yet to. see a case, except for a few days or more in the very 
youngest of babies, where the head is strapped at all. On the other 
hand, this part of the body is allowed all possible freedom. I am here 
enabled to present a picture, which shows exactly the method employed 
by these squaws in both carrying and strapping their babies iu the 
cradle (Fig. 33.) 

It will at once bo observed that the head of the child is perfectly free, 
and that it has been supplied with a thick and soft pillow at the back

of it, whereas the body and limbs have been strapped up almost to the 
last degree. This child has light, thin hair, through which the general 
form of the skull could be easily examined, but after the most careful 
measurements I failed to detect any flattening of the occipital region 
of the head. 

In examining the full blooded infants of 
different ages of this tribe of Indians I 
occasionally found one wherein I thought 
I could satisfactorily determine that the 
back of its head was unduly flattened, but 
it was by no means always the case. 

Another thiDg mast be remembered, and 
this is that these Navajo women do not 
always keep their infants thus strapped 
up in their cradles, and this fact goes to 
sustain the proposition that whatever 
pressure is brought to bear against the 
back of their heads, it is not a constant one. 
We often see here the little Navajo babies 
playing about for hours together at a time 
when they are scarcely able to walk. 
Among older children I have satisfied my- 
self — as well as I could through their mat- 
ted hair — that the hinder region of their 
heads was flattened, but it never seemed to equal that of the Navajo 
girl, which I have illustrated in the October number of the Journal of 
Anatomy. 

There can be, I think, no question but that Prof. Sir William Turner 
is correct in regard to its being not only a distortion but due to pressure, 
though it would appear from the examinations which I have been able 
to make that at some time or other the strapping must have been very 
differently applied. To produce posterior flattening of the skull alone 
the pressure must be applied only upon that side, and to do this, in 
order to produce anything like the extraordinarily distorted skull that 
I have figured in my second paper on this subject, the child would 
have to have its head against a hard board for a long time and con- 
tinually kept there. If it were strapped it must be quite obvious 
that a certain amount of frontal flattening would also be produced, 
but I have never discovered such a distortion in any of the Navajo 
skulls. 

Now, so far as I have seen, they do not treat their children in this 
way, but, as I have said, always give them a soft pillow and leave the 
head free. 

Perhaps in former times the strapping of their babies in these cradles 
was very different from the methods now employed among this tribe, 
and again, the question of heredity may possibly enter into the subject,

or more extended observations may prove that this flattening of the 
skull only occurs in a certain proportion of the representatives of this 
race, and not in every individual. 




Fig. 30.

(From photograph.) 

Dr. R. W. Shufeldt, U. S. Army, sent to Prof. Sir William Turner, of 
Edinburgh, a Navajo skull, which is described in the Journal of Anat- 
omy and Physiology, vol. xx, p. 430, as follows : The skull presented a 
well-marked parietooccipital flattening, obviously due to artificial press- 
ure, which had been applied so as to cause the suprasquamous part of 
the occipital bone and the posterior three-fourths of the parietal to slope 
upwards and forwards. The frontal region did not exhibit any flatten- 
ing, so that in this individual, and it may be in his tribe of Indians, the 
pressure applied in infancy was apparently limited to the back of the 
bead. Owing to this artificial distortion the longitudinal diameter of 
the head was diminished, and the cephalic index 94.6, computed from 
Br. Shufeldt's measurements of the length and breadth, was therefore 
higher than it would have been in an uudeformed skull. The cranium 
Was by nerbrachy cephalic. 



CRADLES OF THE AMERICAN ABORIGINES. 



197 



The height of the skull was also very considerable and reached, as 
may be seen from the table, 115 millimeters; the vertical index was 89, 
so that the skull was hyperacrocephalic. In all probability the pressure 
during infancy, which shortened the skull in its antero-posterior direc- 
tion, forced the vertex upwards and added to the height of the cranium, 
so that the high vertical index was occasioned both by diminished 
length and increased height. The skull was cryptozygous, for not only 
was the breadth in the parietal region great, but the Stephanie diameter 
was 137 millimeters. The glabella was not very prominent, but the su-

praciliary ridges were thick and strong. The oridge of the nose was 
concave forward, so that the tip projected to the front. The basi-nasal 
diameter was 105 millimeters ; the basi-alveolar 98 millimeters, the gna- 
thic index was 93, and the skull was orthognathic. The nasal spine of 
the superior maxillae was moderate. Where the side walls of the an- 
terior nares joined the floor the margin of the opening was rounded. 
The transverse diameter of the orbit was 40 millimeters, the vertical di- 
ameter 36, the orbital index was 90, and the orbit was megaseme. The 



198

nasal was 48 millimeters, the nasal width 25, the nasal index was 52, 
and the nose was mesorbiue. The palatomaxillary length was 5G, 
the palato- in axillary width was 72 millimeters ; the palatomaxillary in- 
dex was 128, and the roof of the mouth was brachyuranic. The teeth 
were all erupted and not worn. The cranial sutures were all unossifled.

The parieto-sphenoid suture in the pterion was 19 millimeters in antero- 
posterior diameter. There were no Wormian bones. The anterior end 
of the inferior turbinated bone was almost in the same plane as the an- 
terior nares. 

The Comanche cradle (6970) is the most primitive cradle in the Na- 
tional Museum (Fig. 34). It is a strip of black bear-skin 30 inches long 
and 20 wide, doubled together in form of a cradle-frame. Along the 
side edges loops of buckskin are made to receive the lacing. The loops 
are formed as follows: A buckskin string is passed through a hole in 
the bear-skin and the longer end passed through a slit or cut in the 
shorter end. The long end is then passed through the next hole and 
drawn until a loop of sufficient size is left; a slit is made in the string 
near the last hole passed through, and then the whole lashing is drawn

through this slit. This serves the purpose of a knot at each hole, as in 
many other cradles. A foot-piece of bear- skin is sewed in with coarse 
leather string.* 

Governor Stevens (Ind. Aff. Bept., 1854) says the Blackfeet women 
carry their children in their arms or in a robe behind their backs. 
When traveling, the children are placed in sacks of skin on the tent 
poles. I saw no cradle of any form. We have in this mention a par- 
allel to the Comanche type. Note also the use of stiff rawhide as a sub- 
stitute or antecedent of boards to secure stiffness. The subject will 
come up again in speaking of the Sioux and other Eastern cradles.

The frame illustrated by Fig. .'55 belongs to the latticed type, and is 
thus constructed : Two strips of narrow board, often native hewn, wider 
and further apart at the upper end, are held in place by cross-pieces 
lashed and apart just the length of the leather cradle sheath. This 
lashing is very ingeniously done ; four holes an inch apart are bored 
through the frame board and cross-piece at the corners of a square, a 
string of buckskin is passed backward and forward from hole to hole

and the two ends tied, or one end is passed through a slit cut in the 
other. The lashing- does not cross tue square on either side diagonally. 
Above the upper cross-piece the frame pieces project a foot and are 
straightened atop like fence pickets. Disks of German silver and 
brass-headed nails are used in profusion to form various geometric 
ornaments; upon the front of the frame, between the cross-pieces, a 
strip of buffalo hide is sewn, with rawhide string passing through holes 
bored in with the hair side (the side pieces) towards the cradle-bed. 

The inclosing case is a shoe-shaped bag made of a single piece of 
soft deer-skin lashed together half way on top in the usual manner, 
and kept open around the face by a stiffening of buffalo leather or raw- 
hide. A small opening is left opposite the penis, and a stiffening piece 
keeps the bag open at the feet. This case is attached to the frame by 
thong lashings. Little sleigh bells, bits of leather, feathers, etc., com- 
plete the ornamentation (Fig. 3o).

The Sioux cradle is a frame of two diverging slats, painted yellow, 
held in place at the head and foot by cross-slats, lashed as in the Co- 
manche cradle, with this difference, that the string crosses between the 
holes diagonally. This is true, but may have no significance. The tops 
of the side pieces project above the cradle sack at least 18 inches, and

are studded with brass-headed nails in straight lines (Figs. 36 ; 36 a). 
As in the Comanche cradle there is a bottom or mattrass, and a quilt 
of calico, lined, supplants the buffalo hide. The baby-case is shoe- 
shaped, the part around the head and shoulders stiffened with a lining 
of buffalo leather. All over the outside of the baby-case bead-work is 
laid on in geometric patterns of blue, red, yellow, green, and blue-black 
on a white ground. The beads are strung on a fine sinew-thread in 
proper number and color to extend quite across the case. This string 
is then tacked down at intervals of three-fourths of an inch so regularly 
as to form continuous creased lines, extending from the foot longitudi- 
nally around the baby-case to the foot on the other side. Streamers of 
colored tape and ribbon take the place of old-fashioned strings, fur, and 
feathers. The edges of the lower half of the case are joined by four 
strings tied separately, instead of the universal lashing. There are 
about this cradle several marks of modificat ion by contact with whites, 
which show at the same time the tenacity with which old forms remain 
and the readiness with which they yield to pressure at the points of 
least resistance, indicating also where the points of least resistance are. 

Another specimen of Sioux cradle has the back- board square at top, 
carved and painted, barrow-shaped, like last, awning-frame bent and 
painted, covering-cloth decorated with beads. It is tacked around edge 
of side board, brought up and laced in the middle like a shoe. Model 
of doll with iron necklace. Length, 28| inches; width, 13 inches. 
Back-board carved on front above; back-brace has large rounded ends; 
foot-rest low, curved around at bottom; cradle covered over with quill- 
work in red, white, and black; pattern, lozenges, men, horses, etc.; dec- 
orated with iron bells; opening across cradle cover in middle. (Fig. 37.) 

Mr. Catlin thus describes the Sioux cradle, from a specimen in his 
collection, and the early life of the Sioux infant: "The back-board is 
wide; wedge-shaped opening made by cutting piece out of top; top is 
painted and decorated with beads; cradle has bent- wood sides, which 
make it like a barrow; the head-pad is over the lower part of the wedge- 
opening; ash awning- frame. The ends of this are fastened to a rod 
going across the back, by a device, which may be called an ear-mortise. 
It is held down over rod by an iron dog fastened to side of cradle. 
Cradle, 29£ inches long, 12 inches wide; length of side board, 2£ inches; 
height, 4£ inches ; height of awning-frame, 14£ inches ; width, 16£ 
inches. 

"The custom of carrying the child, among the Mississippi Sioux, is not 
peculiar to this tribe, but belongs alike to all, as far as I have yet visited 
them, and also as far as I have been able to learn from travelers who have 
been amongst tribes that I have not yet seen. The child, in its earliest 
infancy, has its back lashed to a straight board, being fastened to it by 
bandages, which pass around ib in front, and on the back of the board 
they are tightened to the necessary degree by lacing-strings, which 
hold it in a straight and healthy position, with its feet resting on a 
broad hoop, which passes around the foot of the cradle, and the child's

position (as it rides on its mother's back, supported by a broad strap 
that passes across her forehead), that of standing erect, which, no 

doubt, has a tendency to produce 
straight limbs, sound lungs, and 
long life. 

" In plate 232, letter d, is a cor- 
rect drawing of a Sioux cradle, 
which is in my collection, and 
was purchased from a Sioux wo- 
man's back, as she was carrying 
her infant in it, as is seen in let- 
ter e of the same plate. 

"In this instance, as is often 
the case, the bandages that pass 
around the cradle, holding the 
child in, are all the way covered 
with a beautiful embroidery of 
porcupine quills, with ingenious 
figures of horses, men, etc. A 
broad hoop of elastic wood passes 
around in front of the child's face 
to protect it in case of a fall, from 
the front of which is suspended a 
little toy of exquisite embroidery 
for the child to handle and amuse 
itself with. To this and other lit- 
tle trinkets hanging in front of 
it there are attached many little 
tinseled and tinkling things of the 
brightest colors to amuse both the eyes and the ears of the child. While 
traveling on horseback the arms of the child are fastened under the 
bandages, so as not to be endangered if the cradle falls, and when at rest 
they are generally taken out, allowing the infant to reach and amuse 
itself with the little toys and trinkets that are placed before it and 
within its reach. 

"The infant is carried in this manner until it is five, six, or seven 
months old, after which it is carried on the back in the manner repre- 
sented in two of the figures of the same plate, and held within the folds 
of the robe or blanket. 

"The modes of carrying the infant when riding are also here shown, 
and the manner in which the women ride, which, amongst all the tribes, 
is astride, in the same manner as that practiced by the men. 

"Letter &, in the same plate, is a mourniug cradle, and opens to the 
view of the reader another very curious and interesting custom. If 
the infant dies during the time that is allotted to it to be carried in 
this cradle, it is buried, and the disconsolate mother fills the cradle

with black quills and feathers in the parts which the child's body had 
occupied, and in this way carries it around with her wherever she goes, 
for a year or more, with as much care as if her infant were alive and in 
it, and she often lays or stands it leaning against the side of the wig- 
wam, where she is all day engaged in her needlework, and chatting 
and talking to it as familiarly and affectionately as if it were her loved 
infant, instead of its shell, that she was talking to. So lasting and 
so strong is the affection of these women for the lost child that it mat- 
ters not how heavy or cruel their load or how rugged the route they 
have to pass over, they will faithfully carry this, and carefully, from 
day to day, and even more strictly perform their duties to it thau if 
the child were alive and in it. 

"In the little toy that I have mentioned, and which is suspended be- 
fore the child's face, is carefully and superstitiously preserved the um- 
bilicus, which is always secured at the time of its birth, and, being 
rolled up into a little wad of the size of a pea and dried, it is inclosed 
in the center of this little bag and placed before the child's face, as its 
protector and its security for " good luck" and long life. 

"Letter c, same plate, exhibits a number of forms and different tastes 
of these little toys, which I have purchased from the women, which they 
were very willing to sell for a trifling present ; but in every instauce 
they cut them open and removed from within a bunch of cotton or moss, 
the little sacred medicine, which to part with would be to endanger the 
health of the child, a thing that no consideration would have induced 
them in any instance to have done."* (Pages 130-132, vol. n, Catlin's 
Eight Years). 

* Long, Maj. S. H. (Expedition to the Sources of the St. Peter's River. Philadelphia. 
1824. 8vo.) Among the Pottawatomie great care is taken that the body shall be 
straight and well formed; no attempt * * * is made to change the shape of the 
head, "this being regarded as having a tribal significance " (vol. i, p. 100). On the 
Cottonwood River, Long saw an old Pottawatomie chief with "a child-board on his 
back, in which he carried his little grandson" (vol. I, p. 178). The child was naked 
(p. 179). Of the Dacotah, Long or Keating, who compiled and edited his notes, says: 
" The practice of shaping the heads of infants is unknown to them " (vol. I, p. 
404). 

Charlevoix, Pe"re de. (Journal of a Voyage to North America. London. 1761. 8vo.) 
The Tetes de Boule (Roundheads), an Algonquin tribe north of Montreal, " bave tbeir 
name from the roundness of tbeir heads; they think there is a great beauty in this 
figure, and it is very probable the mothers give it to their children while in the 
cradle" (vol. I, Letter xi, p. 265). Speaking of the fine figures of the "Indians of 
Canada," Charlevoix says that one reason for this is, that " their bodies are not con- 
strained in the cradle" (vol. n, Letter xxi, p. 79). Just after (p. 120) be describes 
the ornamentation of " their children's cradles" among the Hurons. 

Lahoutan, Baron. (New Voyages to North America. London. 1735, 2d ed. 8vo.) 
These observations were made upon the Algonkian and Iroquoian tribes of the St. 
Lawrence and the Lakes in the latter part of the seventeenth century. Like Hearne, 
he says: "There is no such thing as a cradle among the savages" (vol. II, p. 7); but 
he adds that "the mothers make use of certain little boards, stuffed with cotton, upon

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 



East of the Mississippi Eiver, north of the Tennessee and the North 
Carolina line, and south of Hudson Bay lived Algonkin and Iroquois 
stocks, and all of theru used a flat cradle'-board, not far from 2£ feet 
lung, 10 inches wide, and one-half inch thick, tapering wider at the 
head. The St. Kegis Iroquois, in the north of New York and near the 

Cauada line, have for many years bought 
their cradle- boards from the whites or 
made them of material bought from a 
white man (Figs. 39, 40). The specimen 
illustrated has the back carved in flowers 
and birds, and painted blue, red, green, 
and yellow. The cleat at the upper end 
of the back is a modern chair-round. The 
foot-board is a small shelf or bracket, on 
which the child's feet rest. 

An interesting relic of savagery on this 
quite civilized cradle are the notches in 
the awning-bow, falling down over the 
ends of the cleat, extended and held in 
place by braces of leather thong. The 
hoop serves many functions, such as sup- 
port for sunshade, rain protector, mos- 
quito net, ornaments, dangling trinkets 
to please the child, etc.

The following notes regarding the Indians east of the Mississippi 
River have been collected in the course of the author's reading, and are 
here appended to throw additional light upon the subject : 

Heriot, G. (Travels through the Canadas. London, 1807. 4to.) " The use of a 
pillow is known to but a few" among the Iroquois tribes. Having seen that article 
in use, they imitate it " with a billet of wood, with a mat rolled up, or with skins 
stuffed with hair (p. 267). 

which the children lie as if their backs were glued to them, being swaddled in liuuen 
and kept on with swath bands run through the sides of the boards. To these boards 
they tie strings, by which they hang their children on the branches of trees" (vol. II, 
p. 7). "As soon as their children come into the world they dip them in warm water 
up to the chin." The Dacotahs, Aleutian Islanders, etc., use cold water. "After 
this they swathe them down upon little boards or planks, stuffed with cotton, where 
they lie upon their backs" (vol. II, p. 43).

Jefferys, T. (Nat. and Civil Hist, of French Dominions in Xorth and South Amer- 
ica, London, 1760, folA says of Algonkian Teres ae Boul: •• The Round-Heads * * * 
Take their name from the figure of their heads. * * * Ir is believed that the 
mothers * "* * form the heads of the children into this shape when they are in 
the cradle " (part I, p. 47). 

Liancourt, Duke de. ^ Travels through the United States, etc. London, 1799. 4to.) 
Very much the same account as that of Weld, etc., is given by this traveler of the 
cradle-board used by the Iroquois tribes. He says, however, that •• suckling children 
are generally suspended in a basket fastened to the ceiling" (vol. I, p. 177). 

Weld, I. (Travels through Xorth America and Canada. London. 1799. 4to.) As 
the result of general observation of the tribes of Canada aud the Lakes, he says that 
" an Indian child, soon after it is born, is swathed with cloths or skins [vUh Long, 
Notes), laid on its back, and bound down on a piece of thick board, spread with soft 
moss." Hoops protect the face. The cradle-board is suspended on the mother's back 
when traveling, otherwise hung by the head-strap. Infants are also put in hammocks, 
and when able to crawl are released from the cradle board (p. 387). 

" Their infants are borne with haire on their heads, and are of com- 
plexion white as our nation, but their mothers in their infancy make a 
bath of Walnut leaves, huskes of Walnuts and such things as will stain 
their skinne for ever, wherein they did & washe them to make them 
tawny. The coloure of their haire is black & their eves black." 

2sote. — The idea that the Indian was born white was very commonly 
entertained in the first half of the seventeenth century. Lechford, in his 
u Plaine Dealing," p. 50. says: •• They are of complexion swarthy & tawny. 
Their children are borne white, but they bedaube them with oyle & colours 
presently." Josselyn also speaks of the Indians " dying their children 
with a liquor of boiled Hemlock-Bark." (Two Voyages, p. 128.) Speaking 
of the Virginia women Smith says : " To make their children bardie in 
the coldest mornings they them wash in the rivers, & by paynting & 
oyntments so tanne their skinnes that after a year or two no weather 
will hurt them." (True, Travels, vol. I, p. 131.) Strachey gives a more par- 
ticular account of the supposed process : " The Indians are generally 
of a cullour browne or rather tawny, which they cast themselves into 
with a kind of arsenic stone, »£: of the same hue are their women, how- 
beit yt is supposed neither of them naturally borne so discolored ; for 
Capt. Smith (lyving somtymes amongst them) affirm eth how they are 
from the womb indifferent white, but as the men, so doe the women dye 
& disguise themselves into this tawny cowler, esteeming yt the best 
beauty to be neerest such a kyud of murrey as a sodden quince is of 
(to liken yt to the neerest coulor lean), for which they daily anoint both 
face & bodyes all over with such a kind of fucus or unguent as can cast 
them into that stayne." (Historie, 63.) ("Xew English Canaan." Prince 
Soc. Boston, 18S3, p. 117.) 

t; These infants are carried at their mothers' backs by the help of a 
cradle made of a board forket at both ends whereon the childe is fast 
bound and wrapped in furres ; his knees thrust up towards his bellie,

is as a dogge does on his bumme ; aud this cradle surely preserves them

better than the cradles of our nation, for as much as we fiud them well 
proportioned, not any of them crooked backed or wry legged ; and to 
give their charracter in a worde, they are as proper men and women for 
feature and limbs as can be found, for flesh and blood as active." (" New 
English Canaan." Prince Soc. Boston, 1883, p. 147.) 

The Choktah flatten their foreheads with a bag of sand, which with 
great care they keep fastened on the skull of the infant while it is in its 
tender and imperfect state. Thus they quite deform their face and give 
themselves an appearance which is disagreeable to any but those of 
their own likeness.* (Adair's American Indians, p. 284.) 

"The Indians flatten their heads in divers forms, but it is chiefly the 
crown of the head they depress in order to beautify themselves, as their 
wild fancy terms it, for they call us long heads by way of contempt. 
The Choktah Indians flatten their foreheads trom the top of the head 
to the eye-brows with a small bag of sand, which gives them a hideous 
appearance, as the forehead naturally shoots upward, according as it is 
flattened, thus, the rising of the nose, instead of being equidistant from 
the beginning of the chin to that of the hair is, by their wild mechanism, 
placed a great deal nearer to the one and farther from the other. The 
Indian nations round South Carolina and all the way to New Mexico 
(properly called Mechiko), to effect this, fix the tender infant on a kind 
of cradle, where his feet are tilted above a foot higher than a horizontal 
position, his head bends back into a hole made on purpose to receive it, 
where he bears the chief part of his weight on the crown of the head 
upon a small bag of sand, without being in the least able to move himself. 
The skull, resembling a fine cartilaginous substance, in its infant 
state, is capable of taking any impression. By this pressure, and their 
thus flattening the crown of the head, they consequently make their 
heads thick and their faces broad, for when the smooth channel of 

* Volney, C. F. (A View of the Soil aod Climate of the United States of America. 
Philadelphia, 1804. 8 vo.) It is " the custom of the Cboctaws to mould the skull of 
their new-born children to the shape of a truncated pyramid, by pressing them be- 
tween boards. This method is so effectual that the tribe is known by the name of 
^he Flat-Heads" (p. 365). Among the tribes near Ihe head of the Wabash, " Weeaws, 
Pavories, Sawkies, Pyankishaws, and Miamis, * * * the females * * * carry 
one or two children behind them in a sort of bag, the ends of which are tied upon 
their forehead. In this respect they have a strong resemblance to our [the French] 
gypsies " (p. 353). 

Bartram, William. (Travels through North and South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, 
etc. London, 1794. 2d ed., 8vo.) "The Choctaws are called by the traders Flats or 
Flat-Heads, all the males having the fore and hind parts of their skulls artificially 
flattened or compressed" (p. 515). The infant is placed "in a wooden case," on its 
back, " a bag of sand being laid on the forehead, which, by continual gentle compres- 
sion," causes the head to slope "off backwards * * * from the temples upwards." 
The occiput is received in a concavity "fashioned like a brick-mould" (p. 515). 

Heriot, G. (Travels through the Canadas. London, 1807. 4to.) " Some of the 
tribes of Louisiana flatten the forehead of their children, and cause the summit to 
terminate in a point. * Beauty, in their conceptionj consists in moulding the 

head to a round form" (p. 348). 



CRADLES OF THE AMERICAN ABORIGINES. 207 

Dature is stopped in one place, if a destruction of the whole system doth 
not thereby ensue, it breaks out in a proportional redundancy in another. 
May we not to this custom, and as a necessary effect of this cause, 
attribute their fickle, wild, and cruel tempers ? Especially, when we 
connect therewith both a false education and great exercise to agitate 
their animal spirits. When the brain, in cooler people, is disturbed, it 
neither reasons nor determines with proper judgment. The Indians 
thus look on everything around them through their own false medium, 
and vilify our heads because they have given a wrong turn to their 
own." (Adair's American Indians, p. 8.) 

Lafitau* speaks as follows concerning the Southern Indian cradle : 
"The cradle for the savage children in New France is made through- 
out pretty and roomy. It consists of one or two very thin planks of 
light wood, 2£ feet long, ornamented on the edges and rounded at the 
foot, to give convenience of cradling. The child enveloped in fine fur is 
as though glued to the united planks, and is placed standing up in a 
way that it shall hang over a little ledge of wood where its feet are, 
the point turned under for fear lest they should get hurt, and in order 
that it should hold the fold by which it is necessary to carry the frame. 
The swaddling-clothes or furs are held up in front by large bands of 
painted skin, which does not stretch much, and which are passed and 
repassed in the small loops of tough skin which hang from the sides of 
the cradle, where they are firmly fastened. They let these swaddling- 
clothes hang considerably below the cradle, and they throw them be- 
hind when they wish to go walking with the child, or let them fall over 
a half circle, which is fastened to the planks near the head of the child, 
and which can be made to turn forwards in order that the child can 
breathe freely without being exposed to the cold of winter or to the stings 
of mosquitos or gnats in summer, and in order that it should not receive 
injury if the cradle fell. They put over that half circle little bracelets 
of porcelain and other little trifles that the Latins call crepundia, which 
serve as an ornament and as playthings to divert the child. Two large 
lengths of strong leather, which come out from the cradle at the head, 
enable the mother to carry it everywhere with her, and to fasten below 
all their other bundles, when they go to the fields, and to suspend to 
some branch of a tree, where cradled and soothed to sleep by the wind, 
while she works. 

" The children are very warm in the cradle and very easy, for besides 
the furs, which are very soft, they put much down taken from the cala- 
mus (cat-tail, rush H), which they stuff in a wad, or perhaps the pounded 
bark of the peruche (birch?), with which the women scour their hair 
to invigorate it. They are also very careful so that it can not soil their 
furs; by means of a little skin Or a rag which they pass between their 
thighs, which hangs out over the fore part, they can attend to their 



Moeurs des Sauvages Ameriquains, vol. i, p. 597. 



208 EEPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

natural needs without the inside being wet or soiled, except the down, 
which is easily replaced with new. 

" Some nations in Louisiana, to whom the French have given the 
Dame of flat heads, * * * have a groove practically in their cradle, 
in which the mother puts the child's head ; she applies on the front and 
back of the head a mass of clay which binds and bears down with all 
force. She cradles the child all the time until its head has taken its 
shape, and when the sutures of the head have taken consistency. The 
children suffer extremely, become almost black ; a white and viscous 
liquor comes from the eyes, nose, and ears ; they suffer much more from 
the uneasy situation, where they are forced to pass all the time during 
the tirst months of their infancy, but it is the cost of becoming beauti- 
ful by art and the suffering to get that charm which nature refuses. 

" The Caribs and most of the Southern Indians have also flattened 
foreheads and pointed heads. Their mothers fasten the head down 
with little boards and pads of cotton bound stror "-*• «fc of the head. 

" The child has no other cradle but a hammock proportioneu vO their 
height in which the mothers can suspend them and transport them very 
commodiously, and where the children are cradled all naked, without 
any pain from confinement. 

" The Indians, which are called in Canada (le gens de Terres) Garha- 
gonronnon, have a different taste from the Flatheads, for their beauty 
consists in having a round head; thence they are called 'Bullet 
Heads "' (pp. 593, 597). 

" The first years the child is kept all naked in the cabin to keep its 
body from being injured by the air. When larger it works for the 
family. They carry water and little billets of wood ; this they regard 
as sport. Up to puberty they neglect their person; no ornaments are 
worn until they are enrolled in the body of young men. They are edu- 
cated like Spartans " (p. 597). 

" Women strong and robust but are not prolific. The enceinte woman 
does not take care of herself; she carries heavy burdens and works 
harder as she approaches her time. They say this violent exercise 
facilitates their parturition and makes the child more robust. No one 
can deny that they do bring forth with surprising ease. If caught in 
labor away from the cabin they attend to themselves, and are appar- 
ently able to do their regular work the same day " (pp. 590, 591). 

" They do suffer and die sometimes, but they bear their pain with 
such fortitude that they do not seem to suffer " (p. 592). 

"Some Southern Indians think if the women do not bear their pain 
with fortitude the children will inherit their weakness, and they kill 
those children that are born of such a mother. They kill the mother 
of a stillborn child, and also sacrifice one of twins, because one mother 
is not enough for two children" (p. 592). 

"The Indians will not give their children to others to bring up. If 
it happens that the mother dies while the child is yet in the cradle, it

is brought up iu the family, and what appears strange, old grandmoth- 
ers, who have passed the age of having children, have their milk return 
to them, and take the place of the mother. Indians love their children 
with an extreme passion, and although they do not show their affection 
by lively caresses, as do the Europeans, their tenderness is, however, not 
less real. They suckle their children as long as they are able, and do 
not wean them but from necessity. I have seen children three or four 
years old taking milk with their younger brothers" (p. 593). 

In South America the same custom seems to obtain that we have 
seen in North America, namely, in the tropics the carrying of children 
in the shawl or sash, and bedding it in the hammock; while in the colder 
regions the cradle-frame appears. Frames corresponding to some in 
North America are found in Peru. Simon de Schryver, in his Eoyaume 
d'Araucanie-Patagonie (1887), figures at page 21 an Araucanian woman 
carrying a child in a frame (Fig. 39), which seems to be nothing more

than a short ladder, with cross-bars. On this frame the child is lashed, 
the head being perfectly free, except that the lower part of the occiput 
rests against the top cross-bar, as in the case of the Polynesian pillow. 
In addition to her living freight the woman carries in front a bag of

A feature in the weaving of the Patagonian wallet is worthy of at- 
tention, although its description would be better in a paper on weaving. 
There is in the National Museum a game-bag from Mackenzie River, 
and another from Kodiak, made of exceedingly fine babbiche or buck-

source of anxiety. The Japanese mother 
is concerned partly with temperature and 
partly with transportation. The African 
mother consults transportation alone.

ARTIFICIAL DEFORMATION OF CHILDREN. 218 



NOTES ON THE ARTIFICIAL DEFORMATION OF CHILDREN 
AMONG SAVAGE AND CIVILIZED PEOPLES. 

[with a bibliography.] 

By Dr. J. H. Porter. 

The accompanying notes are collected from various sources as a sup- 
plement to Professor Mason's paper on " The Cradles of the American 
Aborigines."* The time allotted did not permit the compiler to exhaust 
the subject, but enough is here given to show the practices concerning 
children in their first year throughout the world, and the varied beliefs 
obtaining as to the effects of such treatment. In the future the subject 
will receive more careful and systematic study* 

The author embraces this opportunity to express his obligation to 
the librarians of the State, War, and Navy Departments at Washing- 
ton for many courtesies. 

Intentional modifications of the form of the head, although less gen- 
eral than other fashions by which conformity to an ideal of beauty has 
been attemped, have, nevertheless, been widely prevalent among races 
of men, but can not be said to include all the variations from an average 
.cranial type actually existing in nature. The ethnical classification of 
M. Topinard (Elements d' Anthropologic Gene rale) displays deforma- 
tion with reference to race in a manner which fulfills all practical 
requirements. Deformity is, however, as real when slight as when 
excessive, and apart from those distortions he has described, from the 
many which are due to pathological causes, and the yet more numerous 
deviations from symmetry which unintentionally exerted pressure pro- 
duces in the incompletely ossified skull, there still remain those varia- 
tions in the processes of nutrition and growth through which assymetry 
becomes the rule not in the head and not in man only, but in the homol- 
ogous parts of all axially developed animals. 

As a matter of fact, and exclusive of the embryological identity of 
their elements, an ideal head is no more demonstrable than an ideal 
vertebra; and whatever may be hereafter accomplished, at present the 
anatomical and physiological constants of neither can be determined 
in detail. It therefore appears to be inexact to speak of the deformities 
of an organ whose conformation has not been distinctly ascertained. 
In addition to this, only a small portion of mankind have arrived at 
any common judgment on the subject of cranial contour, and wherever 
a standard is furnished by such a consensus of opinion, this is derived 
from art and not from science. Both empirical knowledge and physio- 
logical principles justify the general conclusion that the artistic form is 
that which is usually associated with superior brain power ; but it does 
not at all follow that an alteration of outline that would destroy the 
former would similarly affect the latter. Such facts undoubtedly dis-

America is embodied in Professor Mason's work.

parage alike the methods and the results of anthropological research 
in certain directions, but they neither obviate the necessity of initiating 
further study from existing information, nor impugn its value as a whole. 

In considering the natural history of the human head, account must 
be taken of the fact that man, while not alone in this respect, is never- 
theless an exceedingly aberrant form among the Mammalia. On any 
theory of life, however, except that of special creation, and independ- 
ently of conflicting estimates of the systematic implications of structure, 
the organization of this most highly specialized being must be regarded 
as the outcome of descent, with modification, and should therefore be 
considered in connection with that of the groups to which man is affil- 
iated. 

As has been said, there is no absolute form for the head or for the 
vertebrae of which it is composed, and the fact that all classifications 
resting upon its features have failed, does not encourage the hope that 
the results sought through craniometry will be attained by means of its 
descriptive anatomy. All that can be properly affirmed is, that during 
the immemorial series of adjustments by which the mammals culmi- 
nated in man, and in which evolutional changes of all orders are in- 
cluded, the human head assumed an incompletely distinctive form, which 
is, both in itself and in the causes which determine its variations, more, 
or less clearly revealed in the tribal history of mankind. The state- 
ment that the anthropoid head becomes less human with development 
has been generally united with the assumption that this implies im- 
portant generic differences between them, and if the observation were 
true in the sense in which it is for the most part understood, it would 
do so. Its special significance is, however, detracted from by the gen- 
eral truth that in zoology the rule is that, for obvious reasons, young, 
creatures are less differentiated than those which are mature ; while, 
on the other hand, the difficulty of discriminating between the adult 
brains of some of the higher apes and those of certain savages, may be 
considered as qualifying the former assertion to so great a degree as to 
suggest error, or at least inexactness, in the observation. Bo doubt 
the mistake is partially attributable to misconceptions arising from an 
idea of the fixity of species, but in itself, the error is involved in all 
comparisons between unlike things. To found a parallel upon the ex- 
ternal tables of the skull, as if these were equally characteristic and 
similarly developed in a gorilla and a man, is to include in the terms 
dissimilar elements, and thereby vitiate the comparison. The contours 
of the head in these instances are differently related, and, considering 
the plates of the skull especially, the external table of the ape's cra- 
nium is much more prominently associated with the muscular appar- 
atus than is the case with man, in whom the subordination of the en- 
tire head to the encephalon is exceptional. This is but a single illus- 
tration of the general fact that throughout the vertebrate class the cra- 
nium proper, amid innumerable subordinate variations, assumes the 



ARTIFICIAL DEFORMATION OF CHILDREN. 215 

more specialized character of a braiu-case as we ascend in the organic 
scale. In fishes, where the head contains other organs than those of 
the nervous system, its indefinite relations to the cerebro-spinal axis 
are conspicuous. Among the Eeptilia, though containing only the brain, 
the extreme disproportion between the head and its contents indicates 
that its conformity with the cerebral ganglia is subsidiary to other con- 
formities; while in birds the limited range of the cranial cavity, as 
contrasted with its range when compared with the bulk of the body, 
conveys in a modified form the implication of increasing specialization 
of the head. As might be expected, the anatomical evidence furnished 
bj^ the Mammalia is corroborative of that derived from lower groups. 
No variation, however extreme, is competent to free a structure from 
the influence of heredity, and it might be argued a priori that the hu- 
man head would have the outlines of its history delineated in the mor- 
phology of the primates. 

The facts in this instance justify the anticipation. As in the develop- 
mental record of birds, among which the ornithic stamp, either general 
or special, is but gradually and indirectly evolved, so also with the 
more immediate congeners of man, where the more salieut characteris- 
tics of his type, distributed throughout a group of anthropoids, do not 
admit of consecutive arrangement, and can not be attributed in their 
totality to any specific form. From the primates, as from the other 
mammalian sub-classes, a cranial figure involved in the metameric de- 
velopment of the encephalon, gradually disengages itself and becomes 
more regular and more definite in its cerebral relations as the grade of 
organization is elevated; so that the profiles associated with ganglionic 
mass increase in prominence, while those which are otherwise associated 
correspondingly diminish. 

These anatomical traits link themselves naturally with physiological 
co-ordinates. Everywhere encephalic structure is related, though not 
directly, to function. Enhanced importance in the brain implicates in- 
creased solidarity in the entire organism. As the cerebral elements 
grow in multiplicity, variety, and complexity, this development is con- 
comitant with cranial amalgamation, with progressive obliteration of 
the features attaching to lower forms, with condensation of the ence- 
phalic ganglia, with a more direct'correspondence between the skull and 
brain, and finally with a greater conformity of the bodywith the head. 

Whatever phylogeuetic significance may be found in these facts, their 
morphological and physiological bearing is unmistakable. Through 
quite various structural gradations there appears, though not in linear 
sequence, "a series of forms," which ultimately display in modifications 
of cranial contour a more definite coaptation of the euvelope to its con- 
tained viscus in developmental progress, and in the falling away and 
weakening of its muscular attachments, the paramount function of the 
skull as a brain-case, and the subordination of its structure to that of 
the organ which it incloses. 



216 KEPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

It is not necessary here to consider the elements which compose or- 
ganic form or the conditions that determine their arrangement. The 
process, so far as the head is concerned, has been, to a great extent, 
masked among the vertebrates by adaptation to other than encephalic 
relations, while the part was carried through the cartilaginous, semi- 
osseous, unamalgamated, and consolidated types of crania, to one which, 
as representative of the most important organ in the body, has been 
commonly selected by the anthropologists for investigation, aud generally 
believed to promise results corresponding with its position and the 
function it sustains. Tried by the tests afforded by craniometry, how- 
ever, it appears to have little or no taxinomical value, since the outcome 
of these measurements is to transpose races and fuse peoples otherwise 
known to be distinct. 

At the same time, in man, cranial outlines are unquestionably pre- 
ponderantly determined by the brain, while the features by which its 
action is obscured have been so frequently and completely described that 
they need not be recapitulated. But although this statement holds on 
the morphological side of the question, from the physiological stand- 
point the case is not the same. The brain limits the shape of the head 
and is itself limited by the laws of growth, heredity, aud structural 
tjorrelati vity ; but in the phenomenal series cerebral development is 
antecedent to cranial evolution, and the relation subsisting between 
these — a relation which is in its nature causal, so far as shape is con- 
cerned — places the factors upon different planes. In virtue of prepon- 
derant function and equivalent preponderance of structure in special 
ganglia, a general form of head has been attained ; but from fluctuations 
jn the energies by which it was produced in correspondence with varia- 
tions in the conditions of life, this form varies both in human and pre- 
human history, and so widely as to have thus far prevented classifi- 
cation. 

That the organ through which all adjustments to the environment 
are primarily made should vary among groups whose lowest aggregates 
are nearly as passive to the direct action of natural selection as beasts, 
and whose higher forms are but partially and incompletely adjusted, is 
not surprising; and while it must be assumed upon biological grounds 
that the plasticity of the brain has lessened since its deviation from the 
ancestral type, whence issued in divergent lines that of man and his 
congeners, still, the facts of descent suggest that to its organic variability, 
and to that expressed in specific adaptations, there must be added a 
strong inherited tendency in this direction. 

The cerebral history of the primates seems to warrant the theoretical 
conclusion that among these great variability of the head exists. 

In Lemuridae, where the cranium relatively to the face is small, and 
the ethmoidal, tentorial, and occipital planes are greatly inclined to- 
wards the basi-cranial axis, the brain scarcely exceeds the base of the 
skull in length, whereas in Simiadae the encephalon is more than twice as 



ARTIFICIAL DEFORMATION OF CHILDREN. 217 

long. The anterior cerebral lobes in the Arctopithecini compare in mass 
with those of anthropoids, while the posterior lobes are more developed 
than in certain races of men. Among the Platyrrhini great cranial va- 
riations correspond with extreme contrasts in brain structure and mass. 
The low facial angle, inclined tentorial plane, and perpendicularity of 
the axis of the occipital foramen to that of the cranial base, belong, as 
in Mycetes, to a type in which the cerebellum is scarcely covered, while 
in Chrysothrix the posterior lobes of the cerebrum are of relatively 
greater proportions than in any of the Mammalia; and, moreover, the 
vertex is arched, the facial angle large, the basi-cranial axis short, as 
compared with its cavity, and the planes of the occipital foramen and 
tentorium are in correspondence. The surface of the brain in Cebus is 
nearly as much convoluted as that of the catarrhiue apes, but the 
sulci fade almost to obliteration through Pithecia, Chrysothrix, and 
Nictipithecus. On the other hand, by the nearly total structural mask- 
ing of the annectant gyri of the external perpendicular fissure, the brain 
in Ateles rises above the catarrhine type. 

Diversities such as these, occurring within the limits of a single 
group, put craniological classification out of the question ; but in Catar- 
rhines and Anthropidse differences obtain, which, though less extreme, 
are equally decisive, and without anatomical details, for which there is 
no space, it maybe said that the heads and brains of Semnopitheci and 
Colobi vary from those of Macaci and Cynocephali as significantly as 
the same structures do in the man-like apes. Apparently, then, no typi- 
cal cranium exists among the simians any more than among men, from 
whom an artistic preconception has to a great extent concealed its 
absence. 

With regard to this standard of art, also, it must be remembered that 
it is primarily one of form, while, physiologically, form has no necessary 
connection with the constitution of a ganglion. Such expressions as 
"nervous arc" and " reflex action " emphasize as if essential, that which, 
except contingently, has nothing to do with either curves or angles. In 
" the building of a brain " the terminal elements of nervous tracts are 
cellular, and agglomeration therefore results in the composition of a 
mass attached to a pedicle. Nothing which is generally more exact than 
this can be advanced. Components like these make up the parts aud 
wholes of all nervous systems, and how they have combined in man and 
his class, and with what degree of uniformity, has already been indicated. 

Of course it is net meant that the human head has not an average 
shape, or that this or any other part whose conformation is due to ac- 
tions and reactions between an ancestral group and its entire environ- 
ment, could alter otherwise than infiuitesimally under the incidence of 
discontinuous forces. Nor is it intended to say that the harmony which 
exists in other instances between an organ and its properties is here 
ignored. No more than in any other machine or structure can the 
skull be considered as unaffected by the laws which co-ordinate mechan- 



218 KEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

ical and functional fitness with functional and mechanical requirements. 
But resemblances of this kiud are not those which are contemplated in 
anthropometry, where the relations of structure and function, and of 
those to the conditions of life, have been disregarded in a search for 
morphological constants, whose occurrence, under the circumstances, 
was biologically impossible. Much but not all has been done towards 
a science of man, when the divergent forms of his class have been 
united by forms that are intermediate, and when his pedigree has been 
reconstructed on the basis of kinship. The whole question of race is 
included in this generalization, although it is not thereby fully ex- 
plained, neither is it likely to be elucidated by measurements. 

Without pursuing tbe subject further it may be remarked that, ab- 
stractly, structure and function are determined in all organisms by the 
affinities of their units of composition ; that complete homogeneity in 
a group of protoplasts is impossible, and that initial diversities will in- 
crease during evolution. The minuteness of these ultimates may not 
add to the difficulty of comprehension more than is the case witb those 
dealt with by molecular physics and chemistry, but it is otherwise when 
the plasticity of life is added. That adaptation is connected with 
changes in function and structure is obvious, but neither in an organ- 
ism, an organ, nor in the plastidules which compose them, is adaptation 
a final term in the progress from homogeneity to heterogeneity, from 
simplicity to complexity, from indefiniteness to definiteness ; since, with- 
out alteration of elementary composition, there are no conceivable cir- 
cumstances under which re-adjustment can be effected. 

As it is with these phenomena which lie at the foundation of life, so 
is it with all the vital phenomena to which natural and sexual selection, 
growth, survival, genesis, heredity apply. Amid all degrees of compo- 
sition and recomposition, function constitutes the substance, adapta- 
tion the form of life. Every statical or dynamical distribution of or- 
ganic energy by which incident forces are met is included in function ; 
and though in large groups of organisms, correlative changes, structural 
and functional, occur slowly and within comparatively narrow limits, 
yet they are, in the nature of things, relatively indefinite, but contin- 
gently permanent, and do not afford on this subject tbe data which sys- 
tematic ethnology Tequires. Not less than its co-ordinate, the evolution 
of form, does physiological development press for interpretation in every 
question relating to race, and the doctrine that all factors by which dif- 
ferences among men are worked out are resolvable into results of tbe in- 
tercourse between these and tbe conditions under which they are placed, 
is essentially a corollary from the persistence of force. 

Space lias permitted but the merest sketch of this subject, but there 
yet remains a question which sooner or later confronts tbe investigator 
of cranial deformities, and this is that of their transmission. Present 
opinion almost unanimously opposes the belief that these may, in any 



ARTIFICIAL DEFORMATION OF CHILDREN. 219 

degree, be perpetuated when of artificial origin ; nevertheless it may 
be maintained with reason that tbe grounds upon which unqualified de- 
nial rests, are theoretically as untenable, in the present state of anthro- 
pological science, as those upon which an unqualified assent could be 
founded. Future results in this direction will depend largely upon the 
possibility of connecting facts of observation with those furnished by 
the experimental physiology of the nervous system. The question is 
a biological one, and without adverting to what has been said concern- 
ing variation, it may be urged that in this, as in all such problems, the 
first necessity is to view them under biological conditions. This re- 
quirement has not in this instance been complied with. Teleological 
preconceptions seem to have been more or less obstructive of the view, 
and equally so, incorrect parallels between alterations apparently within 
the limits of health, aud those which involve morbid consequences. 

There is no doubt that modifications of development in volve functional 
modifications, and that imperceptible molecular changes in the brain 
rest on precisely the same basis as perceptible ones in other parts of 
the body. The inconceivability of spontaneous variation, properly so 
called, the heredity of function as well as of structure, the certainty 
that if structure changed by function is transmitted, any alterations of 
structure which have physiologically altered function must be also in- 
herited, appear to suggest an explanation of certain phenomena con- 
nected with this subject, which, except on the principle of descent, do 
not seem to be interpretable at all. 

According to the statements of Mr. Spencer, there is reason to think 
that special structures of all varieties proceed from the special polari- 
ties of their organic units, and that any tissue or combination of tis- 
sues will impress the modifications it may have experienced upon its 
component elements, between which and the aggregate life implies 
perpetual action and reaction. If this .process, as must be generally 
the case, takes place under normal conditions, the forces manifested 
tend towards equilibrium without reaching, practically, an exact physi- 
ological balance. During these adjustments and re-adjustments, how- 
ever, one of two alternative results inevitably occurs. Either the 
structure will take the shape determined by the pre-existing tendencies 
of its elements, or the aggregate's altered form will mould these into 
harmony with itself. The question thus becomes one of affection of 
function, because, for every reason, it must be assumed that structural 
elements organically changed will, when acting as reproductive centers, 
engender similar changes. 

To oppose to these statements the common assertion that mutilations 
do not become congenital, is to misconceive their character, and to con- 
found pathological conditions with those which must be normal in order 
to be effective. It may readily be suspected that the impossibility of 
inheriting artificial alterations has been too hastily assumed, since this 
involves an additional assumption, which has not been demonstrated, 



220 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

viz, that suck changes do not become organic because they may occur 
without implicating function. The profound alterations effected by 
artificial selection are, of course, due to functional modifications, but it 
has not been shown that these can not be artificially induced, or that 
deformation must be universally morbid in character because it is a 
departure from such standards of organic type as now exist in imagi- 
nation. 

On the morphological side the question seems equally uncertain. 
Given, however, any cause which will effectually modify function, and 
modification of structure is inevitable. No naturalist supposes that the 
digital variations recorded as inherited, or those of the teeth, skin, etc., 
are attributable to any other cause than physiological change ; and the 
same with transmitted club-foot, harelip, amaurosis, deafness. Fur- 
ther, adjustments by involution take place in nature as well as those 
by evolution, and although there are no structures whose properties are 
not originally ascribable to predetermined structural traits, there are 
yet structures which have no discoverable physiological features; and 
while morphological species, or species whose specific forms have no 
biological value, are recognized in zoology, and which, whether perma- 
nently or not, are withdrawn from the action of natural selection, it is 
difficult to see why the production of variety by any means that would 
effectually change function should be disallowed. 

As was stated, there are reasons for suspecting that some such process 
has occurred among mankind to a limited extent ; but whether or not, 
when all accessible information on the subject is organized, this may 
not prove to be a misconception attributable to insufficient knowledge, 
remains to be determined. 

GENERAL NOTES ON DEFORMATION. 

Malte-Brun. (Ge"ographie Universelle. Ed. of Lavalle>. Paris, 1858. 4to, t. 1.) 
General remarks on the causes and modes of distortion of the head (p. 303). 

Humboldt & Bonpland. (Voyage, etc. Paris, 1811. 4to, 3 e partie, t. 1. "Essai 
Politique, etc.) Remarks on head-flattening, its character and cause among Indians 
of North and South America. (Note, pp. 89, 90.) 

Jefferys remarks upon the flue forms of the Indians of North America, and says the 
fact is attributable to "their bodies not being swathed and straitened in the cradle" 
(part 1, p 96). The cradle-board was in use among all the tribes described by him ; 
but this error is not surprising in au author who characterizes the Eskirnaux as " tall 
of stature," and speaks of " their flaxen hair, their beards, the whiteness of their skin 
* * * quite as fair as that of Europeans" (part 1, p. 43). Certain blond tribes do 
occur among the Hyperborean races, but not where Jefferys places them ; although 
the Eskirnaux are not really dark-skinned. With regard to the fine forms so constantly 
noted among the American and other savages, most writers have ascribed it to their 
modes of life; Humboldt adding, in the case of the Americans, a certain racial im- 
plasticity. Most of the earlier authorities have evidently judged an assumed eth- 
nological fact from the stand-point of a social theory. There does not appear to be 
any natural reason why a savage should be better shaped than a civilized man, and 
that this is the case remains to be shown. There is, however, an excellent reason 
why those who are physically defective should be eliminated from all aggregates in 



ARTIFICIAL DEFORMATION OF CHILDREN. 221 

a state of savagery, both by the action of natural selection and by that of their 
fellow-creatures. A very large body of proof could be readily brought forward to 
support the view that Wrangell's statement concerning the Chnkchees held true of 
roost peoples in a similar social phase, viz : "La mort attend l'enfant qui a le malheur 
de naitre avec quelque difformite"." Le Nord de la Sibe"rie. Paris, 1843, vol. I, p. 267. 
Kennan and Bush made like observations in the same region, and Capt. John G. 
Bourke, U. S. Army, has pointed out that in the south this custom is mentioned by 
Padre Gumilla (" Orinosc." Madrid, 1741, p. 344), and by Clavigero (Historia de la 
Baja California. Mexico, 1852, p. 27). I do not recall any reference of the same kind 
in Hennepin, Le Clerc, Charlevoix, etc.; but though the custom may have existed 
among the uorthern tribes, despite Robertson's assertion that all the American Indians 
killed the children who "appeared feeble or defective" (Hist. Dis. & Set. of America. 
N. Y., 1856, p. 144), there is no doubt that in the literature of travel it is more fre- 
quently mentioned as occurring among the southern tribes; and this may have been 
one reason why the earlier discoverers, Columbus, Vespucci, Verrazzano, &c., have 
spoken only of the fine appearance of the natives. The same contrasts, however, 
are found in savage life in this as in other respects. Captain Bourke confirms from 
personal observation the statement make in Emory's " Reconnoissance" (p. 61), that 
among the Apaches the deformed are sometimes well cared for. He also refers to a 
like mention in Francis Parkman (The Jesuits in North America. Boston, 1867, 
Introductory, xl), and also to Peter Martyr's narrative (Hakluyt, Voyages, vol. 5, 
p. 357). 

In connection with head-flattening in America, Humboldt (Political Essay on New 
Spain. London, 1814. 8vo, vol. i) asserts that the back-head is naturally flat (p. 
155). Also that the American cranium is normally "depressed backwards * * * 
among nations to whom the means of artificially producing deformity are * * * 
unknown." The Aztecs " never disfigure the heads of their children." The Mexican, 
Peruvian, and Aturean heads — all flattened ; those Bonpland and himself procured 
were natural. "Certain hordes do compress the heads of children" (pp. 154, 155). 

Squier (The States of Central America. N. Y., 1858. 8vo) quotes Valenzuela to 
the effect that among the Indians found by the Spanish at Lacandon (Dolores), Gua- 
temala, "the cradles for their children were made of reeds" (p. 567). 

Under the heading Tete, Encyclopedic des Sciences, etc., Neufchatel, 1765, is the 
following : "II est parle" dans les voyages et dans les geographies modernes, de cer- 
tains peuples qui se rendent la tete plat que la main, et qui metteut la tete de leurs 
enfans, des qu'ils sont nes, entre deux presses, ou planches, sur le front et le der- 
riere de la tete pour l'applatir." 

NOTES ON AMERICA. 

Bancroft. (Native Races of the Pacific States, N. Y., 1873, vol. I.) Chichimec 
women carried their infants on the back, "wrapped in a coarse cotton cloth, leaving 
the head and arms free" (p. 633). The cradle was a wicker basket suspended from 
a beam or bough (p. 633). 

Gomara (Con. Mex., fol. 318) states that the occiput was flattened among the Nahua 
nations by an arrangement of the cradle, this form being considered becoming. (Ban- 
croft, Native Races, etc., vol. II, p. 281.) 

Humboldt's statement that the Aztecs did not distort the head was, as Bancroft 
remarks (Native Races, vol. II, p. 281), too sweeping. That the custom "was prac- 
ticed to a considerable extent in remote times by people inhabiting the country seems 
to be shown by the deformed skulls found in their graves, and by the sculptured 
figures upon the ruins." Klemni states that "the cradle consisted of a hard board to 
which the infant was bound iu such a manner as to cause the malformation." 

Sahagun, Torquemada, Clavigero, Brasseur de Bourbourg, Carbazal Espiuosa say 
that when a Toochichimec child was born on a journey "the new-born babe was 
placed in a wicker basket and thrown over the back of the mother." (Bancroft, 
Native Races of the Pacific States. N. Y., 1875, vol. n, p. 271, note.)

" Torquemada (Book xiv, ck. 24) states that the Indians," in Mexico, "used to de- 
form their heads with a view to appear more formidable." (Spencer, Des. Soc. An- 
cient Mexicans, Central Americans, etc., p. 27.) 

Lauda (§ xx). "The Indians of Yucatan are, * * * as a rule, * * * bow- 
legged, for in their infancy their mothers carry them about suspended at their haunch- 
bones. They were made 'squint-eyed,'" and their heads were flattened artificially. 
(Spencer, Des. Soc. Ancieut Mexicans, Central Americans, etc., p. 27.) 

Landa (§ xxx) describes the process: "Four or five days after birth the child was 
pnt on a small bed made of rods, and there, the face being underneath, the head was 
put between two boards, in front and behind. Between tbese they compressed it 
* * * until the head was flattened and shaped like their own." {Idem, p. 27.) 

Brancroft. (Native Races of the Pacific States. N. Y., 1873, vol. I.) The Quiche" 
woman (Central America) carries her baby on her back "in a cloth passed around 
her body" (p. 704). 

Bancroft. (Native Races of the Pacific States. N. Y., 1875, vol. n, 8vo.) The Nica- 
ragua and Yucatan infants' heads were compressed and permanently flattened be- 
tween two boards as a sign of noble birth. Squier asserts that occipital flattening 
was effected by the cradle-board among the Quiche's, Cakchiquels, and Zutugils 
(pp. 731, 732). Don Horatio Guzman, rnmister from Nicaragua, informs me that no 
compression of the head and no swathing of the infant is now practiced in any part 
of that country. 

Bancroft. (Native Races of the Pacific States. N. Y., 1873, vol. I.) The Smoos 
Indians of the Mosquito Group flatten the forehead by a process like that in use 
among the Columbians (p. 717). 

Fuentes. (Palacio, p. 106.) In Guatemala children were fastened "to a board by 
means of straps wound round the body * * * from the feet to the shoulders, in 
consequence of which all the Indians have the backs of their heads smooth and flat." 
(Spencer, Des. Soc. Ancient Mexicans, Central Americans, etc., p. 28.) 

Jefferys, T. (Nat. and Civil Hist, of French Dominions in North and South America. 
London, 1760, fol.) Among the aborigines of Hispaniola "the singular conformation 
of the head * * * is effected by art." Mothers pressed their infant's skull, either 
by hand or with boards, until it was distorted, "and in a manner bent back upon 
itself" (Part ii, p. 8). 

Oviedo-. (Historia General y Natural de Indias, book 11, chap. 5.) His statement 
of head-flattening is rather vague. "Porqne al tiempo que nacen los ninos les aprie- 
tan las cabezas," etc. The width of the front head, which he remarks as the result of 
artificial interference, points to the same form, and like appliances, noticed by Porto- 
Seguro, and others, in Brazil. {Idem, book 42, chap. 3.) Gomara is cited as giving 
the same evidence concerning the natives of San Domingo. He says they flattened 
the head with cotton compresses for the purpose of enlarging the face. " Aprietan 
£ los ninos la cabeza muy blando, pero mucho entre dos almohadillas de algodon, para 
ensancharles la cara," etc. 

There seems to have been some confusion in Gomara's mind on this subject — Bernal 
Diaz says there was on all subjects. At all events he gives another account of the 
manner in which the infant's head was distorted, which amounts to this: that it was 
done by the midwife at the moment of birth, or shortly after. In this case, a' very 
common one among different tribes, the fact apparently indicates gradual extinction 
of the custom, since the effect of simple manipulation would be temporary, and where 
distortion implies as much as it sometimes does, its absence exposes the individual to 
the greatest misfortunes. 

Topinard. (Elements d' Anthropologic Ge'ne'rale. Paris, 1885. 8vo.) Remarks of 
forms of distortion by manipulation alone that they must be impermanent— "incapa- 
bles ile produire nne deformation soutenue" (p. 756). Prof. William H. Flower holds 
the same views, and, indeed, the fact is physiologically self-evident unless the ma- 
nipulation were of an unprecedented kind. 



ARTIFICIAL DEFORMATION OF CHILDREN. 223 

Las Casas (Apologdtica Historia. Madrid, 1875, chap. 34) remarks that in Peru 
head distortion was distinctive of the Inca family and of the highest nobility. 
"Privilegio grande concedian los del Peru a" alguhos seriores y que ellos querian fa- 
vorecer" (p. 396, vide Marcot, notes). 

Major, R. H. (Select Letters of Christopher Columbus, etc. Loudon, 1870. Second 
edition, Hakluyt So. Pub.) Dr. Chanca, fleet surgeon on Columbus's second voyage, 
says, of the native and Carib -women in the West Indies, that the latter wore "on 
each leg two bands of woven cotton, the one fastened round the knee, the other 
round the ankle; by this means they make the calves of their legs large, and the 
abo re-mentioned parts very small. * * * By this peculiarity we distinguished 
them" (p. 30). 

Dr. Chanca supposed this custom to depend upon an idea that the distortion was 
becoming — ''que esto me parece que tienen ellos por cosa gentil" (p. 30).

Heriot, G.. (Travels Through the Can adas. London, 1807. 4to.) "The Caraibs 
have their foreheads flattened. * * * The head of the infant is compressed into 
this shape by placing on its brow a piece of board tied with a bandage, which is al- 
lowed to remain until the bones have acquired consistence" (p. 348). 

Heriot, G. (Travels Through the Canadas. London, 1807. 4to.) Carib girls have 
a cotton sock woven to the leg, and "so closely * * * that the calf thereby ac- 
quires more thickness and solidity than it would naturally possess" (p. 307). 

Armas, Juan I. de. (Les Cranes dits DeTorrne's. Havana, 1885. ) This is a paper read 
before the Anthropological Society of Havana, November, 1885, to prove that mechani- 
cal deformation of the head was never practiced in the West Indies or on the continent. 

Graells, Vilanova and Areas. (Rapport pr^sente a Madrid, le 24 Mars, 1871.) This 
was to the effect that certain crania from Cuba, taken to be flattened Carib skulls, 
could not be identified as artificially deformed, but were probably natural heads. 
The text is, " having noticed that in the front and back part of the head the depres T 
sion is not uniform, the commission is inclined to consider the flattening as natural, 
etc." These skulls seem to have been found by Dou R. Ferrer, who very truly says 
that they can not be regarded as specimens of head-flattening among the Caribs, be- 
cause there were never any Caribs in Cuba. (De Armas, Cranes dits D6forme's, p. 7.) 

De Armas (Les Cranes dits De"forru6s) says that no such practice could have been 
general in America for various reasons, viz, it was difficult, tedious, and painful, and 
would have been destructive to the intellect (?) ; also that the Indians, though sav- 
ages, were men with natural feelings toward their offspring which would have pre- 
vented them from perpetrating a custom so destructive as distortion of the head (p. 
14 et seq.). Having given this illustration of his knowledge of the literature of an- 
thropology, he declares that neither among the Peruvian mummies nor in the exist- 
ing race could von Tchudi and Rivero discover a justification of the theory of me- 
chanical deformation. A fact, and a singular one, but no more decisive than Robert- 
son's statement that the mound skulls of North America are all normal (pp. 14, 15). 
In conclusion he remarks that " there is no basis, scientific, historical, or rational, 
on which to rest the affirmation that there were * * * and are * * * parts 
of America in which the natural formation of the head was (or is) modified by me- 
chanical means." And more particularly is this a self-evident truth with regard to 
the Caribs of the Lesser Antilles: first, because none of the earliest chroniclers 
speak of the custom ; and second, because the crania of tins people have not the form 
attributed to them. Of course it was not possible for de Annas to deny the unsym- 



224 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

metrical contour of certain skulls, but he asserted that this was natural, and if the 
statement could be relied on, none could be made of more importance. The weight of 
evidence is, however, overwhelmingly against him. 

De Armas also asserts that Oviedo was the originator of the idea that distortion of 
the cranium was customary among the Indians of San Domingo, etc., but Gomara, 
Las Casas, DeLeon, and Garcilasso dela Vega make like statements, and the evidence 
includes West Indian, Peruvian, Floridian tribes. 

Walker (Colombia. London, 1822. 8vo) quotes Humboldt to the effect that among 
the Caribsof Panapana "the women * * * carried their infants on their backs." 
They also, for the sake of adornment, compress the thighs and legs by "broad strips 
of cotton cloth, by which" the flesh * * * was swelled in the interstices. * * * 
They attach great importance to certain forms" of the body. (Vol. I, p. 545.) 

Heriot, G. (Travels through the Canadas. London, 1807. 4to.) " The natives of 
South America generally make use of hammocks of cotton or of the interior bark of 
trees. * * * This they suspend in their cabins and sometimes on the boughs of 
trees" (p. 287). 

Senor Mutis Duran, of the Colombian legation at Washington, states that no tribe 
of Indians known to him in New Granada or Colombia distorts the head, but that cra- 
nial compression may be practiced by other tribes of this area which he had not ob- 
served. Bandaging infants with the idea of preserving the symmetry of their forms 
is general among all classes. The cradles used by the wealthy are imported or made 
after European models. Among the poorer classes there are two forms of cradle 
in use — one a boat-shaped case of light wood or bamboo, which will rock on any 
plane surface, and another constructed of similar materials and of like form, which is 
suspended from the end of a crooked rod and swung in the air. 

Hilhouse, William. (Warow Land of British Guiana. Jour. Roy. Geo. Soc. Lon- 
don, 1834. Vol. iv.) Dr. Hancock remarks (note, pp. 332, 333, on Hilhouse's account 
of the Indians seen here) that "these tribes have also," i. e., like the coast tribes of 
the Maraiion, " the spread in the foot, or duck's foot. * * * Their feet and toes 
are spread out in the manner most suitable for walking on the muddy shores and 
marshes they inhabit."

tween boards into a "pyramidal" shape. (Spencer, Des. Soc. Ancient Mexicans, 
Central Americans, etc., p. 28.) 

Idem. Lengthening (apart from piercing) the lobe of the ear was a royal fashion 
of the first four Incas. After Mayta-Cupas it became designative of the Curacas 
(Caciques) of the body guard. Now prevalent among certain tribes of the Amazons, 
e. g., the Orejones (Spanish), broad-ears. (Vol. n, p. 270.) 

Piedrahita. (Book 1, ch. 2.) The Coyaimas and Natagaymas (Chibchas) "have 
the custom of putting the tender head of a new-born child between two boards 
* * * in such a way that it * * * gets flattened." The Pichaos and Panches 
of the same stock do this also. (Spencer, Des. Soc. Ancient Mexicans, etc., p. 28.) 

Idem. Compression of the head into the shape of " a bishop's mitre." ( Vide Porto- 
Seguro.) Now obsolete among the Omaguas or Flatheads — a Spanish corruption of 
the Qnichua Omahuas. These are an emigrant stock — the Umaiias, called by the 
Tupinambas of Brazil Icanga-pena (flatheads), which was contracted and corrupted 
by the Portuguese into Cambebas, whence La Condamine's mistake. ( Vide Eef.) 
He mistook a title for a race name. (Vol. n, 340-342.) 

Cieza (ch. 100) says of the Peruvian Collas that "their heads are very long and 
flattened behind, because they are pressed and flattened into what shape they choose 
during childhood." (Spencer, Des. Soc. Ancient Mexicans, Central Americans, etc., 
p. 28.) 

Owen, Prof. R. (Anatomy of the Vertebrates. London, 1866. 8vo.) In the Inca 
race the skull "is high behind, owing to the habit of carrying the infant with the 
back of the head resting on a flat board, the pressure usually producing unsymme- 
trical distortion of the occipital part of the skull." (Vol. n, p. 567.) The same state- 
ment is made concerning the Patagonians. (Vol. n, p. 568.) 

Cieza (ch. 50). Among the Caraques of Peru the child's head was pressed between 
boards, so that it "was long and broad, but flat behind." The Indians said this was 
conducive to health and vigor. (Spencer, Des. Soc. Ancient Mexicans, Central 
Americans, etc., p. 28.) 

Idem. Pis. Nos. 386, 387, and 388, vol. 11, p. 567, exhibit artificially distorted 
skulls of the ancient Peruvians from Titicaca. 

Meyen (p. 36) mentions a decree of the Lima Synod of 1585 against flattening the 
head. Rivero and Tschudi say that the irregularities in crania from the coast of 
Peru " were undoubtedly produced by mechanical causes " (p. 32). Santa Cruz, Nar- 
ratives, p. 78, states thatMancoCapac introduced head-flattening to make the people 
silly and easily ruled. (Spencer, Des. Soc. Ancient Mexicans, etc., p. 28.) 

Marcoy, P. (Travels in South America. London, 1875. 4to.) Notice of custom 
of distorting the head among the Aymaras. (Vol. I, pp. 67, 68.) Old Aymara sculp- 
tures showing vertical and autero-posteri or flattening. (Vol. 1, p. 185.) This work 
contains many "typical portraits" (1, 103) "taken from life" (1, 518). If correct at 
all, the Quichuas on the west, and Antis and Chonlaquiro Indians east of the Andes, 
distort their heads now, though Marcoy does not say so. {Vide pis. Vol. i, pp. 103, 
476, 515.) 

Torquemada (Book xiv, ch. 25) affirms that permission to shape the heads of their 
children was a favor granted by the Inca to some nobles, e.g., the artificial contour was 
that of the royal family. (Spencer, Des. Soc. Ancient Mexicans, Central Americans, 
etc., p. 28.) 

In all these contemporary fac-similes, and in the portrait medallions (Vol. i, pp. 210, 
216, sixteenth century) of Incas and Coyas — "The Imperial Tree" — it is noteworthy 
that, if the delineation is at all accurate, some heads are distorted and some not. 
It is not possible in this instance to reconcile the portraits with Las Casas' statement 
that after the fourth Inca the custom ceased. 

Ulloa, Juan and Antonio de. (Voyage to South America. London, 1807. 8vo.)

Southey remarks (History of Brazil. London, 1819. 4to. Vol. in, p. 703) that 
when Eibeiro encountered the remains of the Omagua at Olivenca in 1774, "they 
had left off the apparatus for flattening the foreheads and elongating the heads of 
their infants; still they admired the old standard of beauty so much that they 
moulded them by hand; but the custom is now wholly disused." In Note 32, Vol. 
in, p. 896, he adds that " several tribes of the Eio Negro flattened their heads like 
the Omaguas." Humboldt (Political Essay on New Spain. London, 1814. 8vo. Vol. 
I, p. 154) says, "the barbarous custom * * * of pressing the heads of children 
between two boards" in South America, "was, like the Greek exaggeration of the 
facial angle, the Kalmuck nose, the Hottentot lips, an attempt to conform to an ideal 
of beauty." 

Spix and Martius. (Travels in Brazil. London, 1824. 8vo.) It is stated that the 
women of the Coroados of East Brazil " carry their children about on their backs," 
and from the context, as well as the fact that the sleeping-cradle is a hammock, it 
seems probable that they are carried in a sling. (Vol. n, p. 247.) 

Brown and Lidstone. (Fifteen Thousand Miles on the Amazon, etc. London, 
1878. 8vo.) They mention another exception to the use of the hammock. The 
Pamary Indians, on the Eio Negro, " have not the peculiarity of using hammocks, but 
sleep on the floor of their tents" on "mats of plaited palm leaves" (p. 433). 

Heriot, G. (Travels Through the Canadas. London, 1807. 4to.) "The Brazil- 
ians, and several other nations in South America," plunge the new-born infant into 
water. It is then "swaddled to little boards lined with cotton, and more frequently 
with moss" (p. 343). 

In connection with references to nose-flattening as a custom among Brazilian and 
other South American Indians, the following indicates both the variability of the 
facial type and that of the standard to which nasal contour conforms when arti- 
ficially modified. De Moussy, V. M. (Description, etc., de la Confederation Argen- 
tine. Paris, 1860. 8vo.) quotes d'Orbigny's L'homme ame"ricain, etc., to tho effect 
that in the Peruvian branch of the Ando-Peruviau race the nose is long and high — 
" nez long, tres aquilin." In the Antisian branch of same race it varies — " nez vari- 
able." In the Araucauian branch of same race it is "tres court." The Pampa branch 
of the Eampean race have the "nez ties-court, tres-6pat6, a narines larges, ouvertes." 
Among the Chiquiteau branch of this race the nose is "court, un peu e~pat6." In the 
third or Moxcan branch of the Pampean race it is " court, peu large." Among the 
Gnarani tribes of the Brazilio-Guaranian race, the feature isdescribed as "nez court, 
dtroit, narines dtroites." Length is a natural characteristic ; the rest may bo natural 
or artificial, but no doubt arc largely modifications. Vide references, passim. (Vol. 
II, pp. 145-147 ; note.) 

Dohrizhofl'er, M. (An Account of the Abipones. London, 1822. 8vo.) Father 
Dobrizhoffer was in Paraguay from 1749 to 1767, and his ethnological matter is ex- 



ARTIFICIAL DEFORMATION OF CHILDREN. 227 

ceptionally valuable. Of a certain tribe at Mbaevera he says: "The mothers put 
their babies in wicker baskets, and carry them on their shoulders." (Vol. i, p. 62.) 
This is the first notice of any cradle but a sling in this region. 

Dobrizhoffer, M. (An Account of the Abipones, London, 1822. 8vo.) The 
mounted tribes — Indios bravos — of Paraguay "do not use stirrups, and most of them 
are unfurnished with saddles, even." This fact accounts for the excessive curvature 
of the legs noticed in previous references. (Vol. i, p. 236.) 

Dobrizhoffer remarks of the Abipones of Chaco, also "an equestrian people," but 
who are provided with saddles, though " stirrups are not in general use," that " you 
never see an Abipone with * * * bandy legs." Like the Kirghiz, all these In- 
dians ride more than they walk, and are placed on horseback at the earliest age. 
Father Dobrizhoffer's statement is not in accordance with the facts of common obser- 
vation in this regard ; but, taken with some reservation, the greater symmetry of 
limb among the tribes of Chaco is evidently due to the difference of position involved 
in the use of a saddle. (Vol. ii, p. 113.) 

King, Col. J. A. (Twenty-four Years in the Argentine Republic. London, 1846. 
8vo.) -The Chirivione Indians of Gran-Chaco would not eat mutton for fear "their 
noses would become flat" (p. 109). • 

Parrish, Sir W. (Buenos Ayres. London, 1852. 8vo. ) Speaking of the Pehuen- 
ches — "Pine Trees" — a Pampa branch, he says: "I have seen some of these Iudians 
who, from being so constantly on horseback, had become bow-legged to such an ex- 
tent of deformity that the soles of their feet were turned inward, etc." (p. 173). 
This points to the absence of a saddle, such as used, at least, by their congeners, the 
Tehu elches-Pata go n ians. 

Harris, J. (Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca. London, 1744. Folio.) 
Sebald de Weert speaks of the ' ' crooked legs " of a certain Indian woman found in the 
Straits of Magellan. (Vol. I, p. 42.) From what is said afterwards {Idem. p. 43) this 
was evidently a Fuegian. 

There are several references to the distortion of limbs among the Fuegians, and to its 
cause. As an example of the uncertainty attaching to reports of the early voyagers, 
Harris', Navigantium, etc., quotes Jaques le Hermite, Voyage of Circumnavigation, 
1623, to the effect that the inhabitants of Terra del Fuego were " as fair as a"ny in 
Europe; * * * very strong and well proportioned, and generally about the 
height of the people in Europe." (Vol. I, p. 71.) Of the same kind is Captain Cow- 
ley's statement, made from personal observation, that the Hottentots "are born white, 
but make themselves black with soot." (Harris's Bibliotheca, Vol. i, p. 83.) 

Cook, Captain. (Voyages, etc. London, 1773. 8vo. ) Describing the beds of the 
natives of Terra del Fuego, says that " a little grass * * * served both for bed 
and chairs." (Vol. u, p. 55.) 

NOTES ON EUROPE. 

Rae, Ed. (The White Sea Peninsula. London, 1881. 8vo.) Bowed legs are men- 
tioned as characteristic of the Norwegian Lapps. Not a pure race like those of South 
Finmark and Terski Lapland. Distortion probably due to the skin-bag cradle (p. 
232). 

Laing, S. (Journal of a Residence in Norway. London, 1836. 8vo.) He describes 
as a characteristic the bowed legs of the Norwegian Lapps. " They form a curve 
with the leg-bone down to the foot, so that in standing with their feet close together 
all above is far apart" (p. 247). Pressure in the hood, etc., during infancy probably 
causes this. 

Panofka, T. (Manners and Customs of the Greeks. London, 1849. 4to.) Descrip-

Guhl and Koner. (Life of the Greeks and Romans. London, . 8vo.) "The 

antique cradle," i. e., the kittvov of the Heroic age, " consisted of a flat swing of bas- 
ket-work." The child, enveloped in the aiidpyava, must necessarily have been bound 



228 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

to this. In the shoe-shaped basket-cradle the infant occupied a sitting position 
(vide pi., p. 195). The last-named cradle had handles, by which it conld be carried 
or swung. Subsequently, when communication with Asia was constant, other forms 
of the. cradle came into use, "cradles similar to our own modern ones" (pp. 195, 
196). The Girupyava, used everywhere in Greece, except in Sparta, were designed to 
prevent distortion. Besides the swaddling-clothes, however, there was in common 
use a sufficient variety of bed-clothes to make any kind of resting place for the child 
soft enough to insure safety against pressure, viz, the Kkivri of Homer was covered 
with hides (nuea), and over this lay the p^yea, blankets or mattress, perhaps. At 
all events, the later K.vepa7>.ov was a sack of some kind of stuff filled with feathers, 
picked wool, etc., and was laid across the straps of the defivia, or folding bed (cot). 
There were also linen sheets, the blankets before mentioned, and some kind of a 
heavier covering, presumably of wool, since it was rough on both sides — nspiGTpufiaTa,

Professor Becker (Charicles, London, 1880 ; Excursus, pp. 221, 222) gives much the 
same account of the Greek bed and bedding as Guhl aud Koner, Life of the Greeks and 
Romans (p. 136, et seq.). Cradles, he says, are first mentioned by Plutarch. "Plato 
knew nothing of them." No author of his age can be said to have mentioned "a 
regular cradle." Mothers probably carried their children in their arms, and these 
"were not encouraged to walk very early." Wet-nurses were commonly employed, 
and among these the Spartan women were the most famous. 

Potter, Dr. J. (Archaeologia Grseca. New York, 1825. 8vo. ) It appears that ob- 
servation had taught the Greeks the effects of pressure on immature bones, since 
everywhere, except in Sparta, where the end was otherwise secured, the infant was 
wrapped " in swaddling-bands * * * lest its limbs * * * should happen to 
be distorted" (p. 628).

Distortion of cranial contour referred to "custom of swathing the child's head 
tightly after birth' 7 (vide Foville on the process). This distortion of the calvaria 
was in the case of a Semitic (probably Jewish) skull (p. 346), (ibid., Appendix, 
vol. II). Specimen of brachycephalous Grseco-Roman cranium, exhibiting asymmet- 
rical parietal and supra-occipital flattening, partially due to "suckling-board" (pp. 
356,357). 

Seebohm, H. (Siberia in Asia, London, 1882. 8vo), describes an Ost'-yak cradle as 
" a wooden box, about 3 inches deep, with rounded ends, almost the shape of the 
child." The oval bottom covered with sawdust. Infant wrapped in flannel and furs, 
and lashed in the cradle. The child is nursed while in this position (pp. 62, 63). 

Prichard, J. C. (Researches into the Physical History of Mankind. London, 1841. 
4th ed. 8vo.) He quotes Pallas to the effect that the only deformity visible among 
Kalmuks is "an outward bending of the arms and legs, resulting from the practice 
of causing children to rest in their cradles on a kind of saddle" (vol. I, p. 263). 

Prcjvalsky, Col. N. (Mongolia. London, 1876. 8vo. Vol. I.) Chapter n, page 
47 el seq., " is especially devoted to the ethnology of Mongolia." He says of the Mon- 
gol, "his legs are howcd by constant equestrianism;" but nothing of any form of 
cradle, or mode of carrying infants, or of malformations other than the above, is said 
anywhere. 

In Pumpelly's Across America and Asia, La Farge (p. 199) has given fac-similes of 
wood-cuts representing various deformities of the head, evidently artificial. Jap- 
anese art, and especially genre art, is of a high order, not relatively, but positively, 
and as it can not be supposed that such should be the case without a knowledge of 



ARTIFICIAL DEFORMATION OF CHILDREN. 229 

the fact that all caricature depends for its effect upon an exaggeration of well-known 
characteristics to the degree of grotesqueness, it would be well to inquire if now or 
formerly any custom, etc., justified these contours. 

From Dr. W. W. Rockhill the information is received that in China and Mongolia 
children are carried in the same way as described by Mr. Akabane" in Japan, except 
that the crossed bands to secure the child on the mother's back are not made use of. 
Capt. John G. Bourke, U. S. Army, states that the Navajos use a cradle-board similar 
to that described by Major Powell on the Colorado, viz, a buckskin sack fastened to 
a board, into which the infant is put without being swathed. No cradles are used 
by the Japanese, Chinese, or in Mongolia. 

NOTES ON ASIA. 

The Emperor of China, Kien-hing (1736-1796), in his work Mandchou-yuen-lion-Jcas, 
says: "The ancient Mandchous some days after the birth of a child prepared for it a 
little hard bed, and laid it thereon face up. Little by little the back of the head was 
flattened and became larger. The Chinese have a custom opposite to this. They lay 
the new born upon its side, first right, then left, wherefore the head is made nar- 
rower." This would make the Mandchous brachycephals and the Chinese dolicocephals. 

Busk, George (Jour. Anthrop. Inst. Great Britain and Ireland, Nov., 1878, "Notes 
on a skull termed Nabathaean") says that regarding the norma lateralis, its outlines 
" almost suggest that the skull has been constricted by a bandage." 

Spencer, H. (Descriptive Sociology, N. Y. Asiatic Races among the Nomadic 
Arabs.) "Noble families used to alter the shape of children's heads." (Table xxxi. ) 
This was done in the age of Abou-Zeyd. (Bastian. Mensch. n, 229. . Id., p. 21.) 

Vambe"ry, A. (Sketches of Central Asia. London, 1868. 8vo.) The Turkoman 
head is "proportionally small" and oblong. This form "is ascribed to the circum- 
stance" that infants are not cradled, but "placed * * * in a swing made of linen 
cloth" (p. 296). The Turkomans commonly have "their feet bent inwardly ; proba- 
bly the consequence of their continually riding on horseback " (p. 296). 

Pallas, (i, 98, etseq.) The Kalmucks " are wellmade, with the exception of the legs, 
which are generally bent (arising from being so much on horseback), and slender, 
like the arms." (Spencer, Des. Sociol. Asiatic Races, p. 3.)

Featherman, A. (Social History of the Races of Mankind, 2d division. London, 
1887. 8vo.) Among the Nicobar Islanders "the skull is depressed by art" (p. 239).

Langsdorf, G. H. von (Voyages and Travels, London, 1813. 4to) describes the 
A'iuos (Japan) as having "compressed noses" (vol. i, p. 328). He says the same of 
the people of Oonalashka (vol. II, p. 31). It is not stated that this peculiarity is 
produced by artificial means. In this, as in a great number of other instances, noth- 
ing is said of the appliances used ; but the inference is that such must have existed in 
the case of infants. The following information, communicated by Mr. Shiro Akabane', 
secretary of the Japanese legation at Washington, exhibits a very simple mode of 
carrying infants on the back. No cradles of any kind are used in Japan. The child 
is never bandaged. It is wrapped loosely in a cloth of some kind, and placed on a 
soft mattress on the floor. There it remains, except when nursed, until it is old enough 
to clasp the body of its parent with its legs, when it is placed on the back beneath 
the outer garment, and supported by two bands passing over its back like cross-belts. 

History of Kamtchatka (translated and abridged from official Russian account, based 
on all voyages and travels to Kamtchatka and Kurile Islands, by Dr. James Grieve. 
Glocester, 1764. 4to). The Koreki (Koriaks) "use neither cradle nor swaddling- 
cloths," No mention of any kind of bodily malformation (p. 233). 



230 EEPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

As Grieve says lie only mentions facts concerning the Koriaks and Kurile Islanders, 
which are not true of Karntchatdales, it may be true that in Kamtchatka and the Ku- 
riles cradles are used. 

Both among the A'inos and Tartars, Eollin's descriptions point to distortions. The 
following are his cranial measurements in Saghalien and at the Baie de Castries: 
Island of Tchoka (Saghalien), circumference of head, 1 foot, 10 inches, 4 lines; long 
diameter, 9 inches, 8 lines ; short diameter, 5 inches, 8 lines. Baie de Castries, cir- 
cumference of head, 1 foot, 9 inches, 4 lines; long diameter, 9 inches; short diameter, 
5 inches, 4 lines. 

Bush, E. J. (Eeindeer, Dogs, and Snow-Shoes. N. Y., 1871. 8vo.) In October Bush 
saw among the Gilaks, on the Amoor, " a babe tightly bandaged in a wooden box or 
cradle, something like that used by our American Indians, but with its legs from the 
knee downwards unfettered." This cradle was hung vertically to the "ridge-pole" 
of a "lean-to" shelter, and, the child's feet touching the ground, it "swung itself" 
(p. 123). In northeast Siberia in January, Bush saw "two little boys," belonging to 
the nomad Tungusians, "lashed together and thrown over a pack-saddle, the one 
balancing the other. * * * They were each sewed up in single garment * * * 
made of heavy reindeer fur." Only the eyes and nose were visible (pp. 240, 241). 

A. E. Nordenskiold (Voyage of the Vega, London, 1881, 8vo, Vol. n) describes 
" a wide skin covering with the legs and arms sewed together downwards" as the 
substitute for the cradle among the Chukchis. Similar devices used by most polar 
tribes apparently. No visible cause for distortion (p. 102). 

NOTES ON AFRICA. 

Wood, J. G. (Uncivilized Eaces of Men. Hartford, 1871. 8vo.) The Abyssinian 
midwives mold the features of infants "to make them handsome" (p. 658). 

"Wood, J. G. (Uncivilized Eaces of Men. Hartford, 1871. 8vo.) Among the Fans 
the child is carried astride of a bark belt (p. 530). The "paingkoont" or circular 
mat cloak of Australians serves to carry the child, vertically placed. The Australian 
form is exceptionally fine (p. 699). The cradle of the New Zealand infant is a mat 
wrap (p. 817). In New Guinea the child lies "in a sort of sling" of leaves or bark, 
and is so carried (p. 901). 

Alexander, Captain (Jour. Eoyal Geogr. Soc, London, 1835, Vol. v, p. 318, note) 
says of the Fingoes (or Wanderers) of South Africa, that their "children are carried 
behind wrapped in the kaross." 

Little, H. (Madagascar. Edinburgh and London, 1884. 12mo.) The Magalasy 
" mother carries her infant upon her back, and not in her arms " (p. 64). No descrip- 
tion of the means used to support the child. 

On page 193 of M. C. Buet's Madagascar la Eeine des lies Africaines, there is a 
plate of a woman carrying a child, placed in a sort of hood formed of a fold of the 
outer garment, which may explain Little's statement. 

Wilkinson, Sir J. G. (Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians, New York, 
1879) states that the head-rest, or according to Porphyry "a half-cylinder of wood 
in lieu of a pillow," was in general use in Egypt. (Vol. I, pp. 185, 186.) 

Wilkinson adds that the same kind of a pillow is found in China, Japan, and among 
the Ashantees and Kaffirs. This is a very incomplete statement of the peoples who 
use the head-rest; but there is a slight incongruity between his assertion of the uni- 
versal use of this kind of pillow, and that made (Vol. I, p. 417) to the effect that the 
Egyptians commonly slept on couches, because many of those depicted in his plates 
would not have permitted the head-rest to be used on. account of their form. He 
says also that the Egyptian bed was often a skin placed on the ground or a frame of 
palm wicker-work like the modern caffass, and in these cases a wooden pillow, cush- 
ioned as in Japan and China, for the rich, might have been employed. 

The Madi women carry their infants in skins which have been dried in the sun 
and scraped clean and smooth with a stone and softened with butter. The skins of 



ARTIFICIAL DEFORMATION OF CHILDREN. 231 

goats, gazelles, sheep, and calves are used, the legs being tied together and strung 
over the mother's shoulders. The baby is placed in the skin under the woman's arm, 
with its head behind. Sometimes a gourd is placed over the head to protect it from 
the sun. When older, the child is carried on the arm. (Proc. Roy. Soc, Edinburgh, 
1883-'84, p. 325.) 

NOTES ON OCEANICA. 

Forbes, H. O. (A Naturalist's Wanderings in the Eastern Archipelago. New York 
1885. 8vo.) In Timor-Laut infants are laid "quite naked * * * on a hard palm 
spathe," which is spread in a siwela or "rough rattan basket" (pp. 315, 316). Every 
one sleeps on a banquette covered with bamboo mats, and they "rest their heads on 
a. piece of squared bamboo with rounded edges" (p. 318). 

Dr. J. G. Carson (Appendix to Part IV, p. 343), describing the Timor-Laut crania 
procured by Forbes, remarks that "all the brachycephalic skulls * * * exhibit 
more or less flattening in the occipital and parieto-occipital region, such as would be 
produced by laying an infant, without any soft material under its head, in a cradle 
like that described." Owing to race intermixture there are two types of cranial con- 
tour in Timor-Laut; but it is evident that the same conditions must be operative 
whether the head is short or long. The difference is one of degree, not of kind. Dr. 
Garson observes also that "the height of the skulls is in all instances less than the 
breadth," a fact which (although not mentioned as such) is of the same class as that 
of occipital flattening, and apparently due to the same cause, viz, the weight of a 
head incompletely ossified resting on an unyielding surface, and in which restitution 
during growth is prevented by the subsequent use of a wooden pillow. An isolated 
fact, and of course having only that value in this connection, is stated by Major 
Cambell (Geographical Memoir of Melville Island, north coast of Australia, in Jour. 
Royal Geogr. Soc. London, 1834, Vol. iv). He says that the pillows he saw were 
made of "pieces of soft silky bark, rolled up in several folds" (p. 157), and also that 
their cranial characteristic is that " the back of the head projects very much (p. 
153). * * * The aborigines of Melville and Bathurst Islands are of the same race 
* * * as those throughout New Holland (p. 158). Hard or wooden pillows are 
not universal in warm countries. The Ovahs of Madagascar sit on cushions, lie on 
mats, and have a matted bolster." (Jour. Roy. Geogr. Soc, 1835, Vol. v, p. 332 ; 
Captain Lewis.) 

Flower, William H. (Fashion in Deformity. Humboldt Library, New York. Vol. 
II, No. 28.) The author reports a statement made to himself by Mr. H. B. Law, to 
the effect that the Dyaks of Arawak practiced artificial flattening of the occiput (p. 
12). 

Featherman, A. (Social History of the Races of Mankind. 2d division. London, 
1887. 8vo.) Among the Dyaks a mat like the Mexican petate, which serves the same 
purpose, is used for a bed. "A bag stuffed with grass answers the purpose of a pil- 
low" (p. 258). 

Reynolds, J. H. (voyage of the U. S. frigate Potomac, New York, 1835, 8vo) states 
that the heads of the Achenese "are somewhat flat or compressed," but gives no rea- 
son for this (p. 183). 

Guillemard, Dr. F. H. H. (Cruise of the Marchesa, London. 1886. 8vo.) In the 
Sulu Archipelago the cradle used is a "little basket- woven cot" hung in the middle 
of a long bamboo supported at the ends. The vibrations of the bamboo when pulled 
rock the child. (Vol. II, p. 14.) Among the Hatam Papuans he saw a number of 
women "with babies strapped upon their backs." (Vol. n, p. 294.) 

Feathermau, A. (Social History of the Races of Mankind. 2d division. London. 
1887. 8yo.) Among the Sumatras "the nose is flattened and the skull is compressed 
from early infancy as a mark of beauty " (p. 289).

Among the Melville Island tribes " a roll of thin, silky bark serves as a pillow at 
night and as a seat in the day-time." (Papuo-Melanesians, 2d divis., p. 120.) 

Featherman, A. (Social History of the Races of Mankind. London, 1887. 8vo.) 
The aboriginal Tasmanian women (Papuans) " throw over their shoulders the skin of 
an untanned kangaroo or opossum," in which they place their children "when carry- 
ing them on the back." (Papuo and Malayo Melanesians, 2d divis., p. 100.) 

Cook, Captain. (Voyage towards the South Pole, etc., ii, p. 34.) Natives of Mal- 
licollo wear a belt which "they tie so tight over the belly that the shape of their 
bodies is not unlike that of an overgrown pismire." (Spencer, Des. Soc. Negritto 
and Malayo-Polynesian Races, p. 20.) 

Busk, George (Jour. Anthrop. Inst. Great Britain and Ireland, Jan., 1877) speaks 
of the "extreme flattening * * * of the frontal region" in certain Mallicollo 
skulls as " artificial." 

Cheever, H. T. "The unnatural flattening of the occiput" (in the Hawaiian head) 
"is thought to be owing to the way the mother holds her babe, which is by the left 
baud supporting the back of its head." (Spencer, Des. Soc. Negritto and Malayo- 
Polynesian Races; pp. 20, 21.) Occipital flattening also promoted by the use of a 
mat pillow or one of wood. 

D'Albertis, L. M. (New Guinea. London, 1881. 8vo). On Yule Island "children 
were carried * * * in netted bags, resting on the backs of their mothers, suspended 
by a cord that passed round the women's heads. * * * Their legs were small iu 
proportion to their bodies." (Vol. i, p. 262.) Both on the coast and in the interior 
of Yule Island the natives wear a tight, broad belt, "sometimes woven on the body." 
Compression from this results in distortion, giviDg the figure a " very peculiar appear- 
ance." (Vol. ii, p. 302.) 

Featherman, A. (Social History of the Races of Mankind. London, 1887. 8vo). 
State that the Riara women (Papuo-Melanesian group) carry their children "on their 
backs in a bag of net- work * * * suspended from the forehead by a band" (p. 51). 
Other Papuans carry their infants in the "flap" of a cloak made of cocoa-nut fiber 
(p. 21). The Tasmanians carried theui " wrapped in a kangaroo-skin, which hung 
behind the back " (p. 21). 

United States Exploring Expedition (Wilkes). (4to. Vol. vi. "Ethnography." 
Horatio Hale. Philadelphia, 1846.) General remarks on prevalent occipital flatten- 
ing among Polynesians (p. 10). 

In connection with the references to occipital flattening among the Polynesians (a 
fact variously explained), but not in any case, so far, referred to the general custom 
of layiug infants on hard mats in warm countries, and especially so in Oceanica, thus 
undesignedly compressing the head by its own weight, the following statements are 
made: Sir J. Bowring (Philippine Islands, London, 1859, 8vo) quotes the ethnolog- 
ical tables of Buzeta to the effect that the " pure Indians " (Tagals) of the Philippines 
have this characteristic, whereas among the Mestizos and Negrittos it is not meutioned 
(p. 176). Wood (Uncivilized Races of Men; Hartford, 1871; 8vo) states that in child- 
hood the Bushman skull exhibits excessive occipital projection, and this naturally 
(p. 249). Further, that the same is the case with the Ovambo at all ages (p. 316). 
Finally, that marked convexity of the front as well as the back head distinguishes the 
Wahuma (p. 400). These facts, l)y themselves, cancel any inferences from the excep- 
tional contour of a single cranial bone unsupported by evidence of abnormal growth 
or mechanical interference. Hard mats and a wooden pillow explain the fact of occip- 
ital flattening, where a vertical occiput is not a decided race feature. 

Wallace, A. R. (Australasia, London, 1879, 12mo) quotes Captain Erskine to the 
effect that among the Polynesian or Mahori race it is the custom to flatten the nose 
during infancy (p. 493). He remarks that the occipital flattening may be artificial

(p. 494). Throughout this work and the ethnological appendix by Keane, there are 
no notices of distortion other than the above. On page 476 is a portrait of a " chief 
of Vanitoro, Santa Cruz Islands," whose skull appears to have been compressed and 
elevated by circular bandages. 

Pritchard W. T. (Polynesian Reminiscences. London, 1866. 8vo.) Without de- 
scribing the process, he states the fact that the Tongans, Samoans, and Fiji Islanders 
have the custom "of squeezing the heads of infants into * * * a shape in con- 
formity with their ideal of beauty" (p. 417). Remarks on contour of distorted skull 
(pp. 427, 428). 

Martin, Dr. J. (An Account of the Natives of the Tonga Islands. London, 1818.

Foster describes the process of flattening the nose in Tahiti, and quotes his descrip- 
tion of the process used by the Hottentots and in Macassar from Gomara, Historia 
General de las Indias (pp. 593, 594). 

Turnbull, John (Voyage Round the World, London, 1813, 8vo) remarks that the 
noses of the Otaheitans are " universally flat, occasioned by pressure during their in- 
fancy" (p. 344). Nothing further said. 

Ellis, William. (Polynesian Researches. London, 1829. 8vo.) "During the period 
of infancy" in the Society and Caroline Islands "the children were seldom clothed, 
and were generally laid or carried in a horizontal position. They were never confined 
in bandages or wrapped in tight clothing." In Tahiti " the shape of the child's head" 
and its features were carefully observed, and parents and nurses "often pressed or 
spread out the nostrils of the females, as a flat nose was considered by them a mark 
of beauty." (Vol. I, p. 343.) In Tahiti "the forehead and the back of the head of 
the boys were pressed upwards, so that the upper part of the skull appeared in the 
shape of a wedge. This, they said, was done to add to the terror of their aspect." 
(Vol. i, p. 343.) 

In general remarks on the "South Sea Islanders," i. e., natives of the Georgian, So- 
ciety, Caroline, " and adjacent isles," Ellis says they " are generally above the middle 
stature," but their limbs are not correspondingly muscular, though " well formed." 
In mountainous parts they have inturned feet and an "exceedingly awkward" gait, 
from using the naked feet in climbing rocks and ravines. Except when distorted, 
" the facial angle is frequently as perpendicular as in the European." Nose-flattening 
is not so general as it was formerly, and the nose "is seldom flat," but "rectilinear 
or aquiline." (Vol. II, pp. 13-15.) The bed of the majority is a single mat. The 
chiefs have many. The pillow is wooden. (Vol. n, p. 67.) 

On Carpentaria Gulf, Australia, the mothers flatten the nose of their young children 
by pressing it with the hand on the point and laying the child on its face.

Calvert, T. W. and J. (Fiji and- the Fijians. N. Y., 1^59. 8vo.) The hedof a chief, 
made on the banquette, "is covered with mats, varying in number from two to ten, 
and spread over a thick layer of dried grass aud elastic ferns, while on them are 
placed two or three neat wooden or hainboo pillows" (p. 108). There was an elabo- 
rate form of general Led. An infant is "anointed with oil and tumeric," but appar- 
ently not swathed in anyway. The friends "plait small mats, measuring about 2 
feet by 1, for the mother to nurse her babe upon." There is no notice that its bed is 
not like that described above (p. 138). "Natives nurse the child sitting quite naked 
astride the mother's hip, where it is kept from falling by her arm " (p. 139). 

The Calverts also describe the nose as "well shaped, with full nostrils, yet distinct 
from the negro type." The "lower extremities" are "of the proportion generally 
found amoug white people." The "mold of the body is decidedly European" (p. 
82). Dr. Pickering (Eaces of Men, p. 147) says the Fijian crania are unique, have 
"rather the negro outline," while "the profile" appears to be " as vertical, if not 
more so, than in the white race." 

Nind,S. (Jour. Royal Geogr. Soc. London, 1832. 8vo. Vol. I.) Describing natives 
of King George's Sound (Swan Eiver colony), Australia, he says: "For the first few 
weeks the child is carried on the left arm in a fold of the cloak, but subsequently is 
suspended on the shoulders" (p. 39). 

Foville, A. (Influence des Vetemens sur nos Organes, etc. Paris, 1834), describes 
cases of cranial deformity and mental incapacity produced by bandaging the head 
during infancy. 

Foville quotes Blumenbach (Collectio Craniorum) with reference to cases of antero- 
posterior flattening accompanied by occipital protrusion, and to instances of the 
pyramidal form of the Peruvian skull. He states that Turkish crania grooved by 
ligatures have been found. 

M. Virey (Art. "Enfant," Die. des. Sci. M6d.) asserts that caps drawn tight by 
ribbons will "force the head into a sugar-loaf shape, and produce idiocy" in infants.

propulsion unilat6rale," describes a case of flattening of the occipito-parietal 
region on one side, accompanied by corresponding projection of the other, due to 
constant position of the head on a hard surface during infancy. 

Dr. J. Thurnam (On Synostosis of the Cranial Bones. London, 1865), describes a 
brachycephalous skull from the Eound Barrows, with a broad, shallow depression 
passing behind the coroual suture, and over the occiput in the line of the transverse 
spine. This was evidently the effect of some kind of head-dress ; probably, one such 
as MM. Foville and Lunier has described as now in use in France. 

L. A. Gossei (Essai sur les d6formations artificielles du crane. Paris, 1855. Ack- 
ermann. Neues Magazin vonBaldringer, Bel. 2, p. 5), says, "Hunc moreminGermauia

Idem. Lunier (Essai sur les deformations artificielles du crane. Gosse. Paris, 18C5), 
refers to this custom as prevailing in the Franco-Gallic Provinces, and adds, " Itague 
hand difficile intellectu videtur, forsitan etiam hujus cranii deformitatem ca causa 
affectam esse." 11. 

Idem. Andry (Gosse's essai) reports the same in Flanders. Shadel recognizes the 
intra-uterine causes, aud for the most part occupies himself with distortion due to 
affections of the sutures, following Hyrtl, Stahl, and Virchow.

or most, prolonged pressure over occipitoparietal region from hard, pillow, and posi- 
tion and weight of head. 

Bourke, Capt. John G-. (Snake-Dance of the Moquis, New York, 1884), describes 
" cradles of flat boards, with a semi-circular screen for the head. These differ among 
the Moquis in no essential from the ordinary cradle-board of the North American 
Indians. When the child is placed on it it is wrapped up tightly in blankets, with its 
arms pinioned tightly to its sides" (pp. 240, 241(. 

Vanibe'ry, A. (Sketches of Central Asia. London, 1868). Swaddling clothes are 
here in general use, and the kindik kesen, or cutter of the same, is a person of much 
consequence, because the act of cutting these out is accompanied by many ceremo- 
nial observances. Vanibe'ry seems to indicate, however, that the child is not swathed 
for any length of time. 

Harris, Maj. W. C. (Highlands of Ethiopia. London, 1844). The beaux of the 
Dankalisand Somalis, at Tajura, "employ in lieu of a pillow a small wooden bolster, 
shaped like a crutch-handle, which receives the neck * * * anc j preserves the 
periwig from derangement" (i, p. 58). 

DAlbertis, L. M. (New Guinea). "Great varieties of type, in color, physiognomy, 
and in the shape of the skull," are found on Pangian Island. Here it is observed 
that parietal compression protrudes the supra-orbital arches (I, p. 29). The same 
statements may, he says, be made of the natives at Oraugerie Bay (i, p. 97). Along 
the whole line, from Soroug to Dorey, the nose varied in form from flat to aquiline 
(i, p. 210). In his plate of the mummified head got from Darnley Island, Torres 
Straits, the type is macrocephalous. 

Blake, Dr. Carter (Appendix Unexplored Syria, Burton & Drake. London, 1872), 
describes a female skull from the Dayr Mar Musa el Habaski showing artificial "com- 
pression of the parietal bones," probably caused by use of the "suckling-board." 

Davis. (Collection of Voyages and Travels, etc. London, 1745). "In Morria, a 
small, low island, lying in the river of the Amazons," children are thus carried* 
"They take a piece of the rind of a tree, and with one end thei'eof they fasten the 
child's head, and about the arm-pits and shoulders with the other, and so hang it on 
their backs like a tinker's budget" (n, p. 487). 

Dawkins, W. Boyd. (Cave Hunting. London, 1874). Refers to Professor Busk's 
notes on the crania of Perthi-Chwaren, in which a skull with " a well-marked de- 
pression across the middle of the occipital bone" is described. This depression had 
the appearance of being " caused by the constriction of a bandage." Except this 
deformation the skull was " well formed and symmetrical," not having any of the 
contours of the tete annulaire, due, according to MM. Foville and Gosse, to occipital 
compression (p. 170). 

Professor Busk states, in his ethnological notes (Cave Hunting), that the Berber 
contingent of the Moorish invaders of Europe in the eighth, ninth, and tenth cen- 
turies "used to elongate the skull posteriorly and flatten the head" (pp. 170, 171). 

In the same work Professor Dawkins suggests that the flattened occiput of the 
brachycephalous invaders of neolithic Britain "may have been caused by the use of 
an unyielding cradle-board in infancy" (p. 193). Evidently the flattened vertex of 
the Sclaigneaux cave was not natural (p. 219). 



THE HUMAN BEAST OF BURDEN, 



By Otis T. Mason. 



I never see a great passenger or express train approaching a station 
without thinking of the long and tiresome experiences through which 
the human mind has passed upward to this concrete climax of inven- 
tions. 

I take my stand as near as safety will allow, that I may drink in the 
eddies of the boiling atmosphere with the aroma of civilization which 
it represents. 

There is something wonderful in the iron horse — his glaring head- 
light, irresistible momentum, extreme docility. On the platform of the 
locomotive stands the controlling mind, the engineer, one hand upon a 
lever, which sets in motion all this ponderous mass at the rate of even 
a mile a minute, as Cicero says, u quadam inclinatione corporis." His 
other hand rests upon the air-brake, by means of which he controls the 
momentum of 500 tons, reducing it at will to absolute rest. Who has 
not imagined, as he whirled along on one of these trains, that he could 
hear the measured hoof-beats of this horse of progress striking the ties 
or the iron rails'? If we consider all the industries and motives involved 
in this man's activity, the myriad trades and occupations invoked in 
the manufacture of train and track, the multitudinous avocations ac- 
commodated by and stimulating his movements, the infinite variety of 
freight, animate and inanimate 5 bags of letters, the messengers of 
every want and emotion; an endless caravan of passengers of every class 
of humanity on every possible errand, representing all commercial de- 
signs, social and civil structures and functions, we shall have an example 
of the climax of human endeavor in its most highly organized condition 
relative to a long series of inventions, of which this is only the intro- 
ductory chapter. Besides these there are thousands of other occupations, 
in which carrying is neither directly nor remotely interested, wherein 
man's handiwork has preceded, initiated, and kept up the higher utili- 
zation of animals and of natural forces. 

But we are not concerned at the present moment so much with the 
tedious and varied manipulations by which the railway train has been 
manufactured from the forest and the mine (that would be its ontogeny) 
as with the millenniums of change through which a common human 

237 



238 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

back-strap or head-band has passed upward through inventive creation 
into the train and track, the latest common carrier (which constitutes 
the phylogeny of the railway). 

At the lower end of this line of inventions and experiences, neglecting 
all the mental burdens which often weigh heavier on us than our packs, 
as we pass downward ignoring wagon trains, mule trains, caravans, 
couriers, pack-horses, dog travois and sleds, reindeer sledges, donkeys, 
llamas, and other beasts of burden, we come at last to the primitive 
common carrier, the pack-man himself, and also the pack-woman, for 
men and women were the first beasts of burden.* 

Primitive commerce and all the carrying and running involved in 
primeval arts connected with food, shelter, clothing, rest, enjoyment, 
and war were accomplished on the heads or foreheads, shoulders or 
backs, or in the hands of men and women; and civilization, while it has 
invented many ways of burdeu-bearing, finds also an endless variety of 
uses for the old methods. How many thousands of our fellow-creatures 
are still in this condition of mere beasts of burden? It is, for instance, 
only a few years since the invention of the passenger and freight ele- 
vator began to supplant that train of " hod-carriers," who have been 
since the beginning of architecture carrying upward to its completion 
every wooden and brick structure in the world. 

To get something like an adequate conception of the enormous amount 
of labor performed by human backs, calculate the weight of every earth- 
work, mound, fort, canal, embankment, wooden, brick, metal, and 
stone structure and fabrication on earth. These have all been carried 
many times and elevated by human muscle. In the light of this con- 
templation, Atlas, son of Heaven and Earth, supporting on his shoul- 
ders the pillars of the sky, is the apotheosis of the human son of toil, 
and the gaping wonder of archaeologists over the hand-made struct- 
ures of Thebes, Palenque, Carnac, and Salisbury Plain subsides to the 
level of a mathematical problem. Indeed, the great majority of earth- 
works, mounds, menhirs, cairns, cromlechs, and dolmens now to be seen 
witnessed the exertions of no other artisan than the humau carrier, f

Missions, p. 27, for the capabilities in this line of a single tribe of Indians.

Considering the activity now displayed in transporting men and pro- 
ductions from one part of the earth to another, it will not be a valueless 
contribution to science if we trace the natural history of those early 
occupations and industries, the improvement of whose apparatus and 
methods stimulated the pristine inventors to make their burdens lighter, 
to enable the human carrier to bear the load with greater ease, to ren- 
der his pack weight proportionate to the length of his journeys, and to 
adapt his occupation to the ever new exigencies of his environment. 

It is a common saying that we must go to nature for our supplies. 
Equally true is it that we go in vain, unless we descend to the condi- 
tion of the brutes, if we expect nature to supply us with aught else 
than that whereon we may exercise the inventive faculty. Indeed, there 
are innumerable examples of animals transporting materials to distant 
places in order to utilize them. The beaver, the bird, the lamprey eel, 
the bee, the ant are all carriers.* Many animals also modify natural 
objects for the purpose of using them. But the two ideas of modifying 
a natural object for the purpose of making a carrying tool seem to con- 
cur only in the human mind. We are the only animals that modify 
nature to produce a carrying device. Again, these creatures all carry 
their implements and weapons with them as part of their natural en- 
dowment; they do not have to invent them. But the farmer, the arti- 
san, the professional man, even the laborers go about weighted down, 
with their tools, apparatus, books, or even their carrying implements 
as ponderous often as the trunk and tusks are to the elephant. 

There are two sets of ideas involved in harnessing the human jument, 
which may be studied in part separately, in part together. They are 
conveyance and transportation, or the carrying of the man and the carry- 
ing of things. The former may be older, for devices in which to carry 
infants may have been the first in the order of invention. The passen- 
ger and the freight train express the two ideas exactly, because each, 
while encroaching on the function of the other, has modifications for its 
own ends. The subject of mere locomotion involving snow-shoes, canes, 
staves, alpenstocks, stilts, crutches, and the like will not be here con- 
sidered, because they are only aids to locomotion and involve little that 
relates to the beast of burden. 

The cradle-board and other devices for carrying infants will also be

the theme of a separate chapter, inasmuch as other ideas are involved, 
but the methods of human conveyance on the backs of bearers among 
people not highly civilized will receive brief mention. 

Many other industries have been created, stimulated and modified 
by the carrying trade. Every one will have a dozen suggested by the 
mere mention of the subject. One has lately come to the writer's notice, 
which will serve as a very primitive example. The crudest agriculture 
in the world is practiced by the Pimasand contiguous tribes in southern- 
most California to procure gourds for the transportation of seeds and 
water. The women, accompanied by a body-guard of men, go, in the 
spring time, to the bluffs or rocky slopes, where a little rich, moist 
earth fills the crevices, and therein, by the help of a sharpened stick, 
they insert their gourd seed. In the autumn the women return to these 
spots to gather the large gourds hanging from their natural trellis, and 
from them supply their households with a variety of utensils. So the 
carrier is patron to the farmer. 

In the same way has the carrier stood friend to the potter. Among 
the Pueblos and other pottery-making peoples hundreds of jars are made 
to be carried on the head or to be swung from the shoulder iu a yoke. 
The potter molds his vase at the order and convenience of the carrier. 

Basketry has also lent its services largely to the carrying industry, 
and in turn has assumed a multitude of shapes and textures demanded 
by this occupation alone. 

In the National Museum, at Washington, gathered from many parts 
of the world, are a great variety of devices designed exclusively to 
facilitate the carrying of burdens by mankind. There are many others 
in various parts of the world quite as important. 

We may approach our task from different points of view, guided by a 
variety of ruling concepts. It is possible to consider the subject geo- 
graphically. I was delighted to find this fact recognized by Plato :* 

" Cleinias : Look at the character of our country. Crete is not like 
Thessaly, a large plain, and for this reason they have horses there and 
we have runners on foot here. The inequality of the ground in our coun- 
try is more adapted to locomotion afoot." 

The word " geography" as here used applies to all natural advantages, 
to materials used in constructing appliances, and to objects carried. 

Or we may view the subject ethnically, in relation to tribal patterns, 
customs, and the prejudices of clan, class, or sex. 

Or it may be regarded nationally, with reference to the regulations 
concerning carriers under the same government and treaties relating 
thereto between different political bodies. 

A philogenetic method would lead us to scrutinize the various ways of 
carrying in relation to the influence of one invention in giving birth to 
another or in some way modifying the form of another, either in the 
same category or in other categories.

THE HUMAN BEAST OF BURDEN. 241 

An interesting method of study would be by crafts, and it would en- 
list the co-operation of many searchers. For instance, we might ask the 
fur trader of Hudson Bay territory to tell us all the ways of carrying 
peltry that his land had seen, from packing up to the Eed Eiver cart. 
In like manner the emigrant over the earth, the peddler or merchant, 
the woodman, the miner, the fisherman, the farmer could each tell us 
a wonderful story, beginning with a very simple process and winding up 
with a story worthy of the Arabian Nights ; or, finally, our thoughts 
could be arranged progressionally in relation to the phenomena, includ- 
ing both what some call natural evolution and also technical elabora- 
tion or design. 

One of the most interesting chapters in the history is that which por- 
trays the methods of hitching up this animal of burden, the parts of the 
body utilized, the harness adopted, and the adaptation of these to the 
burden, the country, and, in short, all the exigencies of the case. With 
this one idea in mind look carefully over the great works devoted to the 
ancient monuments of Egypt, Assyria, Greece, and Eome, or turn the 
leaves of pictorial journals and books of travel, and the variety of 
ways by which man has grown equal to his burden will be astonishing. 

As the study of railroading includes the engine or motor, the train or 
burden, the road and the signal, no less does the consideration of the 
original freightman or pappoose-carrier involve the person, the load, 
the trail, and the primitive signal. Indeed, the germ of the latest pas- 
senger and freight train was in the first human burden-bearer. 

The task of duly appreciating rude inventions is not easy, and some 
of thestatements herein made may seem trivial. Living in the enjoyment 
of so many privileges in the matter of conveyance and transportation, 
we shall find it hard to realize the former condition of things unless we 
transport ourselves to savage and barbarous lands or out-of-the-way 
country places. In a thriving city one no longer thinks of walking. 
The cheapest hand laborers ride to their work in cars of palatial splendor 
drawn by horses, steam, or electricity. Men and women flit around on 
cycles. It is considered vulgar to carry a parcel. The servant girl 
buys a few cents' worth of tawdry stuff and has it brought to her in a 
parcel-dispatch wagon that is covered with forty coats of lacquer. 
Everywhere the old regime is changed in our civilization. We get an 
inadequate conception of the early history of human backs by contem- 
plating the service that nature is at present rendering to the comfort 
and convenience of our race. 

It would hardly be worth while to mention the clothing and adorn- 
ment of mankind as a load to be carried, were it not for the fact that in 
some cases, such as the brass wire of the Africans and the mail of the 
mediaeval knight,* as much as one hundred pounds are borne by a single 
individual. Counting all humanity, it is safe to say that two millions of 
tons of apparel and personal ornament are constantly worn to supply

242 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

artificially what nature has given gratis to other animals, either in the 
way of hair or wool to keep thern warm, or plumage to increase their at- 
tractions. 

It is impossible to euumerate every form of burden-bearing, but to 
show the almost endless variety iu which inventive genius has dis- 
played itself in loading the human body, the following enumeration is 
introduced : 

METHODS OF BEARING BURDENS. 

1. In the hand. — This method is universal. In the house, at the sta- 
tion, on the street, wherever one turns, light parcels are flitting in every 
direction, which in the aggregate amounts to an enormous mass, carried 
principally in the right hand. At the other end of human history the 
act repeats itself. For we can scarcely frame a conception of man pri- 
meval without a club or stone weapon or rude spear in one hand, and 
here again the right hand has been selected to do the work.* 

2. In both hands. — It is really easier to carry in both hands than in 
one, even though the load be larger. So it is a common sight to see a 
man or a woman dividing the luggage into two parcels, bearing two 
buckets or baskets, sometimes held apart with a hoop. In raising a load 
to the shoulders both hands are used. It is amusing to watch the pot- 
ters on the Egyptian monuments — to see the multiplicity of attitudes 
they assume in the application of the two hands to burden-bearing. 

3. On the fingers. — This is a kind of fine art in carrying. In the old 
descriptions and pictures of royal cup bearers the salver is delicately 
poised on three fingers. The climax of this plan is the summer-resort 
waiter's feat of bringing the food of half a dozen individuals borne aloft 
on the ends of his fingers in a huge tray. 

4. With a baldric. — The modern tourist hangs his opera-glass, satchel, 
haversack, etc., to a strap passing over one shoulder and under the op- 
posite arm. The hunter carries his game-bag in a similar manner. 
Among hurdy-gurdy players and fruit-peddlers the strap hangs on 
the back of the neck and the load rests against the stomach. The hands 
are then free to make music, handle the merchandise, or even to help in 
carrying the load. The baldric is now a military ornament especially, 
and may never have had extensive use among savages. 

5. Hung to a belt. — Combining the belt with the baldric, the soldier 
carries his weapons. It is common to see small objects hung to a belt 
before, behind, or on either side. This is not an easy way to carry a 
heavy burden ; yet among semi-civilized peoples it is the place for trans- 
porting treasures — in short, the first step in the insurance of carrying 
treasures. Also, the broad sash of many peoples serves admirably for 
holding children, victuals, weapons, papers, and things not to be exposed. 

* The writer has examined a, great many savage weapons and fools that will tit only 
one hand. The proportion of left-handed is not more than one in fifty for men, and 
he has never seen a left-handed woman's implement. 



THE HUMAN BEAST OF BURDEN. 243 

6. On the arm. — This might be called the retail method of carrying. 
One sees every moment about the farm boys and men using this method 
of carrying, and on the busy street multitudes of men, women, and 
children are ever flitting to and fro with loads. These vary from a few 
ounces to several pounds, and are borne under the arm, on the forearm, 
on both forearms. In the stores it is the same thing. The arm seems 
to be the vehicle for retail conveyance. To vary this style a little we 
must increase the load and basket and watch the market people as they 
trudge along with 50 pounds of food hung on the elbow, resting on the 
hip, and the body bent to get the center of gravity poised exactly. The 
writer has never seen in any book of travels a savage man with a load 
hung to his arm like a great hook and himself twisted around so as 
to throw a part of the weight upon his hip. This must be a product 
of civilization. 

7. Hung from the shoulders. — This is the favorite device of farmers and 
others who carry small loads in a bag. One of the indelible recollections 
of country life is of the farm hand carrying grain, plaster, aud other things 
about the premises in a sack suspended from his shoulders. The same 
man on Saturday afternoon trudges homeward from the mill and the store 
with the week's provisions for his family carried in the same manner. 
The peddler of small wares, the laborer moving with his little property, 
the hunter returning with his game, the woman of southern climes with 
her child, all are examples of the importance of the shoulder in the 
economy of transportation when used merely as an accessory to the 
back. The universal sack of the negro population of the rural districts 
in the Southern United States as a receptacle for everything, is a good 
example of this method of carrying, which has come down to us from the 
remotest antiquity. Travelers state that a Peruvian miner will ascend 
100 or more feet of a rude ladder with 300 pounds of ore in a skin bag 
hung from his shoulder. 

8. On the shoulder. — The shoulder alone plays a leading part in trans- 
portation. There is no lack of examples of women pursuing this method. 
The miller takes a sack of grain on his shoulder, places his palm on his 
hip, and moves on to his hopper, or he reverses the process with a sack 
of flour from the mill to the farmer's wagon. 

In great shipping houses lines of porters carry sacks of grain to the 
ship in the same way. 

Again, the hod-carrier, antecedent of all modern elevators, with 75 
to 100 pounds of brick or mortar on his back, has been for ages all over 
the world transporting upward the material of the builder. 

Look, moreover, at the coolies of the Orient. More than a million 
Chinese make their living as professional carriers. In the cities are the 
porters and others who carry rice, etc., on the shoulder in sacks or bur- 
dens upon a pole, half the weight at either end. 

Writes a friend : 

" The average load of a coolie is 100 pounds, and with this he travels 



244 KEPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

30 miles. Kinkiang is an important place for the export of tea. The 
tea districts are situated about 60 miles from the town, and the coolies 
bring in the chests in two days, each man carrying a load of 100 pounds. 
The weight of a load and the distance over which a coolie travels may 
be different in the north and south. I have not been able to make in- 
quiries elsewhere but at this port." 

In Shanghai 140 pounds is an ordinary burden. For long distances 
100 pounds is the load and 20 miles the ordinary day's journey. The 
bearer has a staff in his hand and rests ad libitum by balancing his bur- 
den on top. One hundred pounds 20 miles equals a ton a mile per day. 
Now, if there are a million coolies, there are each day in China 1,000,000 
tons of freight moved 1 mile on the backs of professional carriers. The 
ancient Egyptians practiced this mode of carrying extensively. 

9. On the scapulae. — The grain carriers or lumpers who load vessels 
with wheat or corn may frequently be seen with a full sack resting on 
top of their backs. They run up a plank to the hatch, toss the sack in 
the air, mouth downwards, and catch the lower corners so as to save 
the sack and dump the grain into the hold. 

The English porters and furniture men have a knot, padded with 
something soft, which they place around the forehead and on the 
scapulae. They are then ready to take on the largest pieces of furni- 
ture, such as bureaus, sideboards, etc. The higher form of this art of 
carrying on the scapulae is the Holland yoke, a device which enables 
the bearer to bring the hands into play. 

10. On the bade. — The back is the natural resting place for the bur- 
den. The lowest savages know this, and inventive genius early began 
to devise apparatus for harnessing this part of the bod} T . In Africa, 
on the Andes, in Mexico, throughout the civilized world, the peaceable 
carrier bears on his back the commerce of the race. The load is held in 
place either by the forehead strap, the breast strap, the shoulder strap, 
or by two or more of these combined. Bock, in his " Head-hunters of 
Borneo," represents a carrier using both the head band and the shoul- 
der straps as in knapsack carrying. In war the soldier fastens his 
knapsack to his back and shoulders, leaving his arms free to do their 
work. There are many patent devices for distributing the soldier's load 
over the shoulders, breast, back, and hips. For obvious reasons his 
hips are left free. Children play at pick-a-pack, passengers are landed 
in shallow ports, persons of means pass over difficult places in the man- 
ner described by Cassius : 

I, as iEneas, our great ancestor, 
Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder 
The old Anchises hear, so from the waves of Tiher 
Did I the tired Caesar. 

The burdens of Kurdish women are thus graphically described: 
" Soon we came to a place where the road was washed away, and we 
were obliged to go around, We saw a woman there with a loaded

donkey which could not pass with its load; the woman took the load 
on her own back and carried it over, and then led the donkey over. 
She also carried a load of at least 100 pounds, and she had a spindle in 
her hands. Thus she went spinning* and singing over the rugged way 
which I had passed with tears and pain. * * * In the evening they 
spin and make sandals ; when they lie down, they place under their heads 
the ropes to bind the heavy loads of grass and wood which they bring 
down from the mountains. After midnight they go up to get loads. 
* * * In the early morning I often saw the women, looking like 
loaded beasts, coming down the precipitous mountain path, one after 
the other, singing and spinning as they came. * * * I saw women 
with great paniers on their backs and babies on top of these or in their 
arms, going four days over that fearful Ishtazin pass, carrying grapes 
for sale and bringing back grain. Men said the women must suffer 
much more before God could forgive Eve's sin. 

a A few years ago a woman from Jeloo came to my home in Geogtapa. 
Her husband, who was almost a giant, sickened in Gawar, and she told 
me she had carried him on her back all the way, four days' journey. He 
died in our house. I did not believe her then ; now I do, for my eyes 
h.ive seen what loads these women carry."* 

11. On the head. — This process is usually called toting, and is espe- 
cially characteristic of womenf of the lower classes and of negroes.J The 
traveler may see the dairymaids anywhere in Europe carrying 25 pounds 
of milk on the head, women in Iceland carrying loads of unsavory cod- 
fish on their heads, and Italian peddlers of all sorts use the head for a 
carriage. In the southern part of the United States 50 pounds is the 
"toter's" steady load. Men and women constantly bear that amount. 
A slater's assistant mounts a ladder with 50 pounds of slate on the head. 
The farm woman totes a tub of water holding 10 gallons, the whole 
weight being 100 pounds. The head-ring is seen among the Zuni In- 
dians as a means of keeping the load on the head and relieving the 
pressure. Pads of various kinds replace the ring where toting is for 
long distances. § 

12. The forehead and the bregma are also parts on which to hang har- 
ness. In civilization the yoke has passed from the forehead of the ox 
to his scapulae. Comparing the head-strap of all our Indian tribes with 
the neck-yoke of the Holland woman, it is permitted to see the same

process of improvement antedating the domestication of tlie ox, and pos- 
sibly suggesting bis barness. 

13. In pockets. — Tbis metbod of conveyance is scarcely wortb mention- 
ing from tbe civilized point of view; yet, when we consider the endless 
variety of small mercbandise carried in tbe pockets of men and women, 
and remember tbat all tbese pockets are for no other purpose than to 
serve as instruments of transportation, we can not omit including it. 
We must remember also tbat tbe Oriental, especially tbe Corean, bas 
pockets in bis sleeves baving tbe capacity of a half bushel. Tbe Turk 
and tbe Arab stow away as much as this in the ample folds of their 
robes, and any boy who has stolen fruit can add his testimony. 

14. Men combined. — Two men bearing a log or burden on their shoul- 
ders, four or six men carrying a bier or stretcher,* sailors hoisting to 
the rhythm of a song or "ohyea," two or more men with a palankin 
borne among them, a set of bearers in Madagascar and elsewhere with 
relays, a company or a regiment of men carrying an immense stone in 
India, as figured by Count Wurmbrand, a lot of men setting up a barn 
frame or telegraph pole, all illustrate the utility of combined effort to 
transport a heavy mass. There is no doubt tbat the great works of 
modern times, whose existence and utility depend entirely upon the 
co-working of thousands to make and to maintain them, were fore- 
shadowed and completely outlined in the days when hand- work alone 
was the force employed. Herodotus ascribes the beginning of the first 
canal between the Nile and the Red Sea to Neku, and the completion 
to Darius, the Persian. A hundred and twenty thousand Egyptians 
lost their lives in Neku's reign.t Peons entering some Mexican city or 
slave trains from the heart of Africa often reveal a long row of men 
and women co-operating in carrying a great weight. The same is true 
of the pulley, answering to a compound hod, by means of which one 
man transports a single weight much too heavy for one.f In an account 
of Cheops' causeway, "some were required to drag blocks of stone 
down to the Nile ; others drew them to the range of hills called Libyan ; 
a hundred thousand men eat bread constantly, and were relieved every 
three months by a fresh lot." § In Munich those who carry large sacks 
use an implement like M to grasp, as it hurts the hands to lock fingers 
under the end of the sack. They stand face to face and grasp the 
rounded sides of this wooden buckle, slide it under the sack, lift it up, 
and steady it with tbe free hand, which carries it along and gives it a 
toss in unloadiug.|| In this country men carry pianos by means of a

shoulder-strap and a peg that goes into the hole left by unscrewing the 
legs. Two men can carry a piano thus. 

15. Hauling. — The simplest form of traction among men may be seen 
in the small boy dragging his wagon or sledge. With the arms alone 
for traces the primitive man dragged his game over the ground or ice 
to his distant home. Even two or more might co-operate in this prime- 
val team. The next step would be the use of a line, perhaps of raw- 
hide, perhaps of fiber. Along the edge of some quiet water they walked, 
those pristine tow-men, dragging their rafts or rude boats from the 
pebbly beach. Here began that immense industry now carried on in 
the canals of the world. 

The ways of fastening one's self to this traction or tow line are many.* 
The simplest is the grasp of the hand. Others may be seen bending 
to their work with the line over the shoulder, around the waist, or tied 
to a becket or bricole. A curious variety of this tracking is seen on 
Kussian rivers, where an anchor is carried up-stream in a small boat 
and dropped. The cable passes back to a windlass or a heavy barge, 
by which the great mass is moved up to the anchor. A delightful spec- 
imen of helpless modern invention is a picture in Baker's "Israailia."t 
Steamer !No. 10 has balked among the rank vegetation of a canal, and 
she is being hauled along by a hundred or more naked Africans drag- 
ging at a cable. In the Southern States formerly the great shad-nets 
were drawn ashore by a gang of fifty to one hundred negroes, who wore 
each a becket with a Turk's-head kuot, which the seine-hauler knew 
how to attach or detach in a second. 

A species of tracking practiced on the Upper Missouri and other 
northern rivers in the fur-trading period before steam-boat days, has 
been called to the writer's attention by Dr. Washington Matthews, U. 
S. Army. It is called oordeling.f The goods of the trader are loaded 
upon a boat and the craft dragged by a tow-line along the margin of 
the stream. These articles were traded for furs until the boat had 
gradually exchanged its freight of civilized waxes for peltry. Then the 
craft was easily floated back to St. Louis, its starting point. Mention 
is made of this process by Lewis and Clarke, Prince of Wied, Brack- 
enridge, and other travelers of the pre-steamboat days. 

Before cordeling, even, there was a method of ferriage of the most 
primitive character practiced on the Missouri Biver. The bull-boat was 
a contrivance used as a primitive ferry. It was made as follows : A

X " The British fur companies held the trade of these Indians until 1807, when Man- 
uel Lisa ascended the river in keel-boafcs to the Mandan villages and beyond. Until 
1832 goods were brought up the Missouri River chiefly in keel-boats, or Mackinaw 
boats, which were cordeled, or towed by nieu with great labor against the rapid cur- 
rent of the river. Two summers at least were always occupied in dragging a boat 
from St. Louis to the head of navigation, the crew sustaining themselves chiefly by 
hunting." Ethnography of the Hidatsa, p. 30.

number of elastic poles were firmly inserted in the earth in a circle the 
size of the gunwale of the boat, and a horizontal pole was lashed to 
these a few inches from the ground. The tops of these poles were bent 
inward, each opposite pair being firmly and neatly lashed together at 
a height from the ground to correspond with the depth of the craft. 
This done, a buffalo-bull hide, depilated and thoroughly soaked, was 
drawn down and stretched over the frame, and the edges secured to the 
horizontal pole which served the purpose of a gunwale. The ends of 
the poles were then cut off, the vessel turned over, any little crevices 
were stopped, and the ferry-boat was ready to launch ; * and this is the 
way the apparatus worked : Whenever an Indian wished to cross a 
river in his bull-boat he placed therein his luggage and babies, and 
fastening a rawhide line to his gunwale, he swam across the river with 
the other end attached to his body. Behind the craft swam his wife or 
daughters, pushing the boat as much as possible against the stream. 
Indians have told the writer that oblong bull-boats were formerly used, 
before the days of steam, whenever longer journeys were to be taken. 
The practice would be perfectly in keeping with the birch-bark canoe 
journeys of the tribes north and east, where the. vessel was only an im- 
proved bull-boat, in which birch-bark took the place of rawhide. 

According to Herodotus (I, § 1) Cleobis and Bito were honored by 
Solon with the second place of happiness among men. u There was a 
great festival in honor of the goddess Juno at Argos, to which their 
mother must needs be taken in a car. Now, the oxen did not come home 
from the field in time, so the youth, fearful of being too late, put the 
yoke on their own necks and themselves drew the car." Without dream- 
ing of their distinguished company hundreds of rag-pickers, small- 
truckmen, and peddlers are pulling and pushing wagons and carts 
about the streets, sometimes alone and often hitched by the side of dog 
or donkey.t 

16. Throwing or tossing. — An immense amount of material is moved 
by various methods of throwing, with or without tools. It is a process 
of rapid transit in which the material alone moves without the neces- 
sity of a track of any kind. Doubtless many will remember the old fash- 
ion of passing buckets of water at a fire before the invention of engines. 
The negroes in southern cities move many thousands of watermelons and 
other produce from the vessels to the warehouses or wagons, often hun-

t The Egyptian sculptures abound in representations of human traction in every 
attitude in which it is possible for a man to be attached to a rope. See Eawliuson's 
Herodotus, II, 72. See also in Rawlinson's Five Monarchies, New York, 1871, p. 402, from 
Layard, a spirited picture of men moving a human-headed bull. We have here in 
one picture men drawing sledges, others drawing hand-carts filled with ropes, and 
others fixing rollers, working levers, holding props and guys, carrying rollers, relays 
coming to relieve their fellows, taskmasters with clubs, and the boss on the front of 
the sledge marking time for those at the ropes. All the draft-men have bricoles or 
beckets as individual harness. 



THE HUMAN BEAST OF BURDEN. 249 

dreds of feet, by tossing them from one to another, standing ten feet 
apart. It is a simple step from this to the shovel, the fork, the hoe, or 
the rake, used on every farm and in connection with almost every busi- 
ness in the world.* In the oldest forms of embankment the laborers 
doubtless carried the dirt in sacks or baskets. To this day the fellaheen 
of Egypt follow the primitive method. f But in all military operations, 
canal and railroad work, excavation in cities, the shovel is the vehicle 
of transportation, and the navvy, or his technical representative, is the 
beast of burden. 

17. Caravans. — It is only a step from the single carrier to the organ- 
ized train under the direction of a leader performing in common a task 
which would be dangerous to one, or in which mutual help is needed. 
No one supposes that the caravans of historic times were invented at 
a single effort. The caravansaries, the wells, the armed guard, the 
joining of forces at difficult places, are complicated affairs which are 
the resultants of many trials of much simpler character. 

In the old slave-hunting days in Africa the same method was prac- 
ticed with slaves. A lot of negroes would be captured and driven to 
the coast for sale, but to save freight each individual was loaded with 
ivory, gold-dust, and other commodities. On arriving at the coast the 
trader sold out the whole concern and returned to repeat the process.^ 
In Southern Mexico and Central America the trade from the interior 
is brought to the coast on the backs of peons marching en traine under 
a leader. 

18. In all the ear]y accounts of settlements in our country trails are 
not only mentioned as the veritable war-path, but commercial trails 
were also known. This introduces us to the whole subject of roads, the 
series being paths marked by stakes or blazed trees, unkept roads, high- 
ways, turnpikes, plank roads, paved streets, tramways. In these rude 
trails or paths are many obstacles — declivities, streams, chasms. To 
overcome these, inventive genius has devised bridges, fords, steps, 
graded ways, tunnels, etc., part of the outcome of the packman's in- 
dustry^ 

* Dr. Samson reports a curious combination of the spade with traction. "In spad- 
ing up the ground a fellah pressed the spade into the earth, while a woman on each 
side, by means of a rope attached to the handle, raised the spade with its load and 
turned it over." 

t u I saw in the Delta of Egypt a common occurrence, young women and girls dig- 
ging in the canals, shoveling the black, dripping mud with a bit of wood and their 
hands into palm-leaf baskets, putting the dripping baskets on their heads so that 
their hair and faces were all matted with slime, toiling up the sides of the canal to 
empty their loads, while a taskmaster with a whip would cut their bare legs as they 
passed if in Aveariness they loitered." — Dr. G. TV. Samson.

250 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

19. Belaying. — An important element in transportation is resting and 
relaying.* In most rude carrying-devices the greatest effort is put forth 
in rising from the ground or in getting the load in place. The organ- 
grinder and the coolie carry staves, on which they rest their load when 
they are fatigued. The Damara girl lifts her load from her head and 
holds it aloft on both hands while she proceeds on her journey. The 
soldier shifts his weapons; the Malagasy bearers replace one another 
under the poles of the filanzana, or carrying- chair, without interrupting 
their journey. The Montezumashad relays of runners between the sea 
and the city of Mexico, so as to receive fish and other lowland products 
in a fresh condition. 

20. Couriers. — From this inquiry must not be omitted the courier, 
swift messenger of tidings, earthly prototype of Hermes, who was suc- 
ceeded later by horses, dromedaries, carrier-pigeons, sltips on the sea, 
steam-cars on land, and, last of all, the telegraph. His modern sur- 
vival is the district and telegraph messenger boy. I have seen some- 
where the picture of a naked Kaffir running at full speed, bearing in 
one hand a pair of assegais and in the other a rod split at the upper end 
to receive a letter, carried thus to keep it from being soiled by contact 
with his naked body. 

In ancient Mexico, says Prescott, "communication was maintained 
with the remotest parts of the country by means of couriers. Post- 
houses were established on great roads, about two leagues distant from 
each other. The courier, bearing his dispatches in the form of a hiero- 
glyphic painting, ran with them to the first station, where they were 
taken by another messenger and carried forward to the next, and so on 
until they reached the capital. These couriers, trained from childhood, 
traveled with incredible swiftness, not four or five leagues an hour, as 
an old chronicler would make us believe, but with such speed that dis- 
patches were carried from one to two hundred miles a day."t 

There is no doubt that all of these various devices have had their in- 
fluence in shaping and deforming the human body. Students of crani- 
ology and anthropometry should have their attention called to the fact 
that among savages the use of carrying-pads, straps, and other devices 
about the head commences just as soon as the child can walk, with little 
loads at first in small baskets, wallets, nets, frames, or what not, when

account of the Greek who brought the news of victory to Platsea, 125 miles, in a day; to 
pedestrian capabilities of man in a savage state collected by Buffon ; to Marco Polo's 
account of couriers in China in the thirteenth century ; to Anderson's account of Gov- 
ernment couriers in China in 1796. (Conq. of Mex., Phila., vol. I, p. 44, note.) "Noth- 
ing in the world is borne so swiftly as messages by the Persian couriers." (Herod., 
Urania, 98.) In this ease horses were used as in the pony mail formerly in use across 
the plains, but tho man or courier went on. 



THE HUMAN BEAST OF BURDEN. 251 

a forehead strap for the top of the head is employed. Even though these 
marks may not be hereditary, they can not escape the notice of the crani- 
ometer. 

It should not be overlooked that this human pack animal 'possesses 
the greatest versatility. In the case of your train, hundreds of men 
load the cars, carrying burdens on back and trucks; men manipulate 
the senseless and purposeless thing looking so proud and capable; men 
unload the train, and, indeed, put the fiery steed to bed. Not so in 
primitive culture; the man-beast feeds, waters, and curries himself, 
gathers and adjusts his own load, changes himself into propeller, track- 
man, carrier ad libitum, besides adapting himself to a multitude of sub- 
sidiary occupations not here under consideration. Indeed, the man is 
engineer, engine, freight-car, truck, wheelbarrow, horse cart, dray, tow- 
path, mule, etc., all combined. 

The mean effect of the power of a man unaided by a machine, working 
to the best possible advantage and at a moderate estimation, is the rais- 
ing of 70 pounds 1 foot high in a second for ten hours in a day. 

Two men working at a windlass at right angles to each other can raise 
70 pounds more easily than one man can raise 30 pounds. 

Mr. Bevan's results with experiments upon human strength are for a 
short period : 

Pounds of force. 

With a drawing-knife 100 

With anger, both hands 100 

With screw-driver, one hand 84 

With bench-vise, handle 72 

With chisel, vertical pressure 72 

With windlass 60 

With pincers, compression 60 

With hand-plane 50 

With hand-saw 36 

With thumb-vise 45 

With brace-bit, revolving 16 

Twisting with the thumb and fingers only, and with a small screw-driver 14 

By Mr. Field's experiments in 1838 the maximum power of a strong 
man exerted for two and one half minutes is 18,000 pounds raised 1 
foot in a minute. 

A man of ordinary strength exerts a force of 30 pounds for ten hours 
in a day with a velocity of 2£ feet in a second, equal to 4,500 pounds 
raised 1 foot in a minute, equal to one-fifth of the work of a horse. 

A foot soldier travels in one minute in common time ninety steps 
equal 70 yards; in quick time, one hundred steps equal 8Q yards; in 
double-quick time, one hundred and forty steps equal 109 yards. 

He occupies in the ranks a front of 20 inches and a depth of 13 inches 
without a knapsack ; the interval between the ranks is 13 inches. 

Average weight of men, 150 pounds each; five men can stand in a 
space of 1 square yard. 

A man travels without a load on level ground during eight and one- 
half hours a day at the rate of 3.7 miles an hour or 31 J miles a day. He 



252 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

can carry 111 pounds^ 11 miles in a day. Daily allowance of water for 
a man, one gallon for all purposes. 

A porter going short distances and returning unloaded carries 135 
pounds 7 miles a day. He can carry in a wheelbarrow 150 pounds 10 
miles a day. 

The muscles of the human jaw exert a force of 534 pounds. 

Dr. D wight observes: "Indians will travel with a facility, a celerity, 
and a freedom from fatigue unknown to the people of Europe. Their 
couriers or runners are said to go at the rate of 100 miles a day. Two 
Choctaws followed my father 500 miles to steal from him two valuable 
horses. When I asked how they could be willing to take so much trouble 
for such an object, he observed that they had no other business, and 
that roving was their favorite enjoyment." * 

The number of pounds that a man is able to lift or carry a short 
distance hardly enters into this investigation, but rather belongs to 
feats of strength and agility. A naval officer tells of a Swede who, wish- 
ing to show his captain how nicely he had polished a brass cannon, took 
it on his shoulder and carried it upon the bridge. The weight could 
not have been less than a half ton. The following example of woman's 
strength, by Captain Healy, involves also the idea of ingenuity and the 
conquest of natural forces : A woman volunteered to bring in her boat 
a stone for an anchor to his launch which required two strong men to 
lift; weight guessed to be 800 pounds [that is too high]. She first filled 
her boat with small branches of spruce ; then, choosing a part of the 
bank where her boat- rail would be on a level with the ground, rolled 
the stone over on the pliant boughs. Afterwards the spruce boughs 
were removed one by one, to allow the stone to slip to its place in the 
boat.t [From Oapt. Healy ? s account I infer that she first filled her boat 
with water and used the buoyancy of the water to help her in moving 
the stone. He says that they understand this.] 

As to the amount one man can carry, Prof. Asaph Hall, of the United 
States Naval Observatory, communicates the following : 

u When I was nineteen years old I could carry a barrel of flour from 
the wagon into the house without putting it down, a distance of 3 rods, 
and up six stone steps ; but I could not do this with a barrel of cider. 
If we put my carrying strength equal to %, we have therefore, barrel of 
cider 7x7, barrel of flour. Jt was the custom in Litchfield County, 
Connecticut, forty years ago, to use 112 pounds for a hundredweight. 
A common test of strength among the young men was to string ten 
half-hundredweights on the shanks of a fork for a lift. There were many 
men who could lift 500 pounds." 

THE PROFESSIONAL CARRIER. 

A new epoch in the history of the human beast of burden commences 
with the appointment of professional bearers or professional common 

* Hodgson's North America, vol. I, p. 250.

THE HUMAN BEAST OF BUEDEN. 253 

carriers. It is brought about by the differentiating process of advanc- 
ing society. As soon as a body or caste of men are allowed to give 
their whole time to a pursuit their efficiency is quadrupled ; the unsuc- 
cessful drop out of line ; advantages are handed down ; powers of per- 
ception and skill are strengthened ; all sorts of devices for packing, 
padding, shifting the load, resting, relieving, relaying, combining effort, 
are thought of as measures of self-protective necessity. The profes- 
sional carrier is more likely to have been the inventor of the beast of 
burden, having to suffer more in his own back and legs by reason of his 
daily burden. The Bajuli of the Komans were professional porters: 
"\Ferri proprie dicimus quae quis suo corpore bajulat; portari ea, quae 
quis in jumento secum ducit ; agi ea, quae animalia sunt. Gaj. Dig., 50, 
16, 235, etc. Bajulos dicebant antiqui, quos nunc dicimus operarios." 
Fest., p. 29. In late Latin, a bearer at a funeral. Ammian., 14, 7. The 
Greek equivalent is BaoTaxryjq. 

PEDDLERS. 

This chapter would not be complete without a passing mention of the 
peddler as a beast of burden who enters on his work as a professional 
for the purpose of commerce. The coolie, for instance, is a carrier pure 
and simple. He takes up his burden at the instance of another and 
lays it down for the same reason. The peddler combines employer and 
employed, retail buyer and seller, with common carrier. Col. C. C. Jones 
says: "The primitive merchantmen engaged in this traffic were held 
in special repute, were generously treated, and had at all times safe 
conduct through the territories, even of those who were at war with 
each other."* The peddlers of the Middle Ages held a conspicuous place 
in the social order, special laws were enacted on their behalf, and they 
enjoyed immunities not accorded to warriors and statesmen. Julius 
Caesar attributes the bravery of the Belgians to the absence of peddlers, 
" minimeque ad eos mercatores saepe commeant, atque ea, quae ad ef- 
feminandos auimosi pertinent, important." 

THE PREHISTORIC CARRIER. 

Although we have no evidence in the remains of early prehistoric' 
man that carrying apparatus of any kind was employed, yet the exist- 
ence of mounds, earthworks, and walls of many sorts of material far 
from its original source, of relics in old camp sites, indicating that the 
former occupants lived very much as do those tribes from which the 
specimens hereafter to be described have been collected, attests the use 
of similar harness and methods of conveyance and transportation. In- 
deed, nothing is more probable than that the first men and women on 
earth bowed their backs and foreheads to those loads wliich their de-

254 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

scendants have borne unremittingly and will continue to carry in spite 
of, and forsooth because of, the progress of invention. 

The whole world is covered with megalithic monuments in the erection 
of which it is extremely doubtful whether any living beings were used 
except men. In the Easter Island are immense platforms on which stand 
images weighing from three to twenty tons. These have been hewn 
out in the crater of a volcano and moved in some instances several miles 
over a region as rough as it can be. On the monuments of Egypt are 
exhibited teams of men hitched to long cables dragging a sledge on 
which sits an enormous statue. Boilers were used and greased tracks, 
but we look in vain for the pulley. The immense buildings on our own 
continent from Central Mexico to Southern Peru were the sole work of 
man. Without a draft animal he brought together the material for 
his splendid palaces and temples, and put every stone in place with his 
own hands. We may go further than this. Long after horses, camels, 
oxen, mules, and donkeys were used as beasts of burden the wagons 
and wheel conveyances were so clumsy as to be practically useless in 
transporting heavy loads. All over Asia, and indeed in many parts of 
Europe, the inconvenience of clumsy carriages kept rapid transport in 
the hands of human bearers. 

To one who believes implicitly in the universal domination of inven. 
tion throughout all human activities, the temptation is great to pass 
beyond the study of the human bearer to those intermediate stages be- 
tween the same and the shifting of the load to vehicles and the backs of 
animals. As interesting to the technologist as to the naturalist are 
those intermediate forms that now and then appear to confirm his 
theories of creation. 

The forces of nature, the wind, the water-fall, the expansion of steam, 
the electric current would form another series, the last in the climax, in 
which the wind acts directly like a hand ; the water, through machinery, 
as a hand turning a crank; the steam, through change of form and the 
element, like a hand winding a spring; the electricity, through chemical 
changes, like a hand discharging a gun. 

THE ESKIMO CARRIER. 

Let us commence the special application of our subject at the farthest 
north, the land of almost perpetual ice and snow. What time the Es- 
kimo freight-man is not moving about in open waters moving chattels 
and merchandise from place to x>lace in the lightest of all boats, the seal- 
skin pontoon or oomiak, he appears as a draft-man, dragging the 
dead seal or other game over the ice by means of a rawhide line. He 
has invented an infinite variety of toggles, made chiefly of walrus ivory 
in shape of seal, walrus, bear, and other game. These are grasped in 
the hand firmly, the rawhide line passing out between the ring and the 
middle linger. The short piece of rawhide attached thereto is a loop 
which is connected by an easily detachable arrangement to the drag-

line of any length. It is rare to see an Eskimo carrying anything, ex- 
cept a mother bearing around a baby in her ample hood. It is a beau- 
tiful illustration of the play between environment and the industry to 
mark the absence of all carrying devices, and at the same time the great- 
est expenditure of invention and energy upon traction apparatus where 
the safety of the carrier would be endangered by the very medium which 
offers the greatest facility in the world to the draft-man. Nothing 
but this perfect harmony could have induced the Eskimo to expend so 
much time and energy. Parry, in his second voyage, gives a figure 
(plate opp. p. 274) of a man carrying a kyak by placing his head in the 
manhole and resting the gunwale on his shoulders. This is indeed the 
first step to the portages in the bircn-bark country farther south. 

In the study of the human burden-animal we must not forget that 
material had to be moved in very early times vertically as well as hori- 
zontally. For instance, a great walrus is killed out at sea or near the 
shore, and the carcass must be lifted out of the water. It has dawned 
on the mind of the Alaskan Eskimo that by cutting slits in the hide of 
the animal and placing paddles or other wooden bars between the rocks 
above, a very respectable tackle may be improvised with the aid of the 
ever present rawhide line (Fig. 1). Friction is overcome by means of

as any one of the Eskimo hunters. This art may have been suggested 
by the tackle used by the Eussians on their ships. 

In many places along the sloping. beaches and quiet waters the Es- 
kimo has learned to track or tow his loaded oomiak. Again, on land 
he is often compelled to draw loads without the aid of a sledge. For 
these purposes he has invented a breast-board of wood. The specimens 
in the National Museum are from Nunivak Island and Oogashik, on the 
Alaskan peninsula. These localities have between them the shallows 
and inlets of Kuskokvim and Bristol Bays. The board is made of drift- 
wood and has the curve to fit around the breast at the shoulders (Fig. 2). 
Unfortunately no description of the manner of use accompanies the spec-

imeus, so we must remain in doubt as to the way in which the primitive 
draft-man hitched himself up. In the northern regions traction of 
sledges is performed by dogs, either alone or assisted by men. There 
is no doubt, however, that the sledge was in use before the dog was do- 
mesticated. The material and style of the sledge vary much according 
to the region. Dr. E. B. Young, who spent many years in the Saskatch- 
ewan regions, says that a great deal of sledging is done by men. He 
has even seen dogs disabled riding on a sled drawn by men. In 
the east it is ruder than in the west. In Labrador, where timber can 
be procured, the sledge differs little from that of the school-boy. Only 
the uprights at the back enable the driver to steer. Farther north bits 
of old wrecks or sections of whale jaw do duty for runners. The method 
of putting a coating of ice on the bottom of the runners is very ingenious 
and effective. 

Barry's description of those in Igloolik is as follows : 
"The Eskimo sledges vary in size, being from G£ to 9 feet in length 
and from 18 inches to 2 feet in breadth. Some of those at Igloolik were 
of larger dimensions, one being 11 feet in length and weighing 268 



THE HUMAN BEAST OF BURDEN. 257 

pounds, and two or three others above 200 pounds. The runners are 
sometimes made of the left jaw-bones of a whale, but more commonly 
of several pieces of wood or bone, scarfed and lashed together ; the 
interstices being filled to make all smooth and firm, with moss stuffed 
in tight and then cemented by throwing water to freeze upon it. The 
lower part of the runner is shod with a plate of harder bone, coated 
with fresh- water ice to make it run smoothly and to avoid wear and 
tear. This coating is effected with a mixture of snow and fresh water, 
about a half inch thick, rubbed over until it is smooth and hard upon 
the surface. When the ice is only in part worn off, it is removed by 
taking some water in the mouth and spirting it over the former coating. 

" We noticed a sledge which was curious on account of one of the run- 
ners, and a part of the other, being constructed without wood, iron, or 
bone of any kind. For this purpose a number of seal-skins were rolled 
up and disposed into the required shape, and an outer coat of the same 
kind was sewed tightly around them. This formed the upper half of the 
runner; the lower part consisted entirely of moss, molded while wet 
into the proper form, and beiugleft to freeze, adhering firmly together 
to the skin. The usual shoeing of smooth ice completed the runner, 
which for six months of the year is as hard as wood. The cross-pieces 
which form the bottom of the sledge are made of bone, wood, or some- 
thing they can muster. Over these is generally laid a seal-skin as a 
flooring, and in summer a pair of deer's horns are attached to the sledge 
as a back, which are removed in winter to enable them, when stopping, 
to turn the sledge up, to prevent the dogs running away with it. The 
whole is secured by lashings of thong, giving it a degree of strength, 
combined with flexibility, which no other mode of fastening could effect." 
(Parry's Expedition, 514,515.) 

Of the natives of Point Barrow, Lieutenant Eay says : " The sleds which 
they use for this purpose are made from drift-wood fastened with whale- 
bone and rawhide lashing; they are about 10 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 
the runners 8 inches wide and 1£ inches thick, straight on top, and have 
no rail : they are shod for ordinary use with strips of bone cut from the 
whale's jaw-bone, and sometimes with walrus ivory ; but this would not 
do in hauling a heavy load over the snow, where there is no beaten trail, 
so they are shod with ice in the following manner: From the ice on a 
pond that is free from fracture, they cut the pieces the length of a sled- 
runner, 8 inches thick and 10 inches wide ; into these they cut a groove 
deep enough to receive the sled-runner up to the beam; the sled is care- 
fully fitted into the groove, and secured by pouring the water, a little 
at a time, and allowing it to freeze. Great care is taken in this part of 
the operation, for should the workmen apply more than a few drops at 
a time the slab of ice would be split and the work all to do over again ; 
after the ice is firmly secured the sled is turned bottom up and the ice- 
shoe is carefully rounded with a knife, and then smoothed by wetting 
the naked hand and passing it over the surface until it becomes per-

fectly glazed; the sled when ready for use will weigh over 300 pounds, 
and they load them with the carcasses of from seven to nine deer, weigh- 
ing over 100 pounds each. Men, women, and children harness them- 
selves in with the dogs to haul these loads to the coast, often the dis- 
tance of 100 miles and over, seldom making more than 8 or 10 miles 
each day." (Report of the Expedition to Point Barrow, Alaska, Lieut. 
P. H. Eay, p. 28.) 

The Eskimo sled is framed of spruce, birch, or whalebone, strongly 
bound with thongs, and the runners shod with smooth strips of whale's 
jaw-bone. This sled is heavy and fit only for traveling over ice and snow. 

Indian sleds of the interior are lighter, the runners being of thin, 
flexible boards. 

Sleds used by voj^ageurs of Hudson Bay are of different construction. 
Three boards, each about 1 foot in width and 12 feet in length, thinned 
and curved into a semicircle at one end, are placed side by side, and 
firmly lashed together with thongs. (Bancroft, I, 52.) 

SLEDGE ISLAND. 

This sledge is about 20 inches in breadth and 10 feet in length, a sort 
of rail- work on each side, and shod with bone, and put together with 
wooden pins or with thongs or lashings of whalebone. (Cook's Voy.) 

EAMTSCHATKA. 

The length of the body of this sledge is about 4J feet and the breadth 
1 foot. It is made in form of a crescent, of light, tough wood, fastened 
together with wicker-work, and, among the principal people, is stained 
with red and blue, the seat being covered with furs or bear-skins. Jt 
has four legs about 2 feet in height, resting on two long fiat pieces of 
wood of the breadth of 5 or 6 inches, extending a foot beyond the body 
of the sledge at each end. These turn up before, somewhat like a skate, 
and are shod with the bone of some animal. The carriage is ornamented 
at the fore part with tassels of colored cloth and leather thongs. It has 
a cross-bar, to which the harness is jointed, and links of iron or small 
bells are hanging to it, which by the jingling are supposed to encourage 
the dogs. (Cook.) 

YUKON RIVEE. 

The snow shoes used in this district are about 4£ feet long, are rounded 
and bent upward in front and pointed behind. Tbeyare made of birch 
woed and covered at either end with a fine netting of gut. The lash- 
ings are strips of rawhide. (Whymper.) 

The sledge consists of a plank, one end of which has been softened by 
steam and bent in prow-like form. The material does not exceed one- 
half an inch in thickness and the width varies from 10 to 14 inches. 
Thongs keep the curved ends in place. It is especially adapted to soft

snow. Eunuers are occasionally added, the freight held in place by 
lashings. 

When a canoe or other heavy burden requires to be transported over 
the land, the Indian has discovered that however much a piece of rein- 
deer-skin may be used it will stretch a little more when again strained 
with the weight it is to support. The skin of a seal will not, when dry, 
sensibly lengthen after it has sustained a load for a length of time- 
This valuable quality renders the skin of the seal a matter of conse- 
quence to the people, who are unable to procure it for themselves, and 
must necessarily rely upon their Innuit neighbors to furnish it in ex- 
change for other value. 

The strap is employed to sustain the weight carried on the shoulders 
while the person may be traveling on snow-shoes, or when carrying a 
burden over a portage to the next landing place. It is generally placed 
over the forehead and shoulders, the muscles of the neck supporting the 
entire strain, while the hand carries the gun, spear, or staff. 

Turner says that he has seen the Ungava natives place a barrel of 
flour on their shoulders and carry it up a hill-side so steep as to require 
one not burdened to pick his steps with care. 

Day after day, with plenty of food or none at all, whether pack on 
back, trapping in the woods, treading out a path with snow-shoes in 
the deep snow for the sleigh dogs, or running after them at a racing 
pace from morning to night, when there is a well-beaten track, they will 
travel 50 or 60 miles a day for a week together without showing any 
sign of fatigue. (Northwest Passage, Fitzwilliam, p. 43.) 

"The Indian packers over these mountain passes usually carry 100 
pounds, although one I had walked along readily with 127 pounds, 
and a miner informed me that his party employed one that carried 1G0 
pounds. The cost of carriage of a pack (100 pounds) over the Chilkoot 
trail for miners has been from $9 to $12, and the Indians were not in- 
clined to see me over at any reduced rates, despite the large amount of 
material required to be transported, some two tons. By giving them 
two loads, or doubling the time over the portage, a slight reduction 
could be had, not worth the time lost in such an arrangement, and I 
made contracts with enough of them to carry my effects over at once. 
Mr. Spuhn was also very energetic in his efforts to secure for me better 
terms, but without avail, and after I had crossed the trail I in no way 
blamed the Indians for their stubbornness in maintaining what seemed 
at first sight to be exorbitant, and only wondered that they would do 
this extremely fatiguing labor so reasonably." (Lieutenant Schwatka, 
Eeconnaissance in Alaska, 1883.) 

Fig. 8 of the Reconnaissance is a view on Payer Portage, and repre- 
sents a Chilkat Indian, with two ammunition boxes, going over the port- 
age. The amount some of these packers will cany seems marvelous, 
and makes estimates for pack-mules or trails therefor seem superfluous. 
Their only packing gear is a couple of bands, one passing over the fore-

head, where it is flattened out into a broad strip, and the other over the 
arms and across the breast; the two meet behind on a level with the 
shoulder, and are there attached to lashings', more or less intricate, ac- 
cording to the nature of the material to be transported. 

" If a box or stiff bag, the breast-band is so arranged in regard to length 
that when the elbow is i)laced against it (the box) the strip fits tightly 
over the extended forearm across the palm of the hand bent backwards. 
The head-band is then the width of the hand beyond this. At least I 
saw a few Indians arranging their packs and their harness according 
to this mode. The harness proper will not weigh over a pound and the 
lashing according to its length. The strip across the head and breast 
is of untanned deer-skin about 2 inches wide, with holes or slits in the 
ends protected from tearing out by spindles of bone or ivory." (Recon. 
in Alaska, p. 23.) 

" It seemed marvelous beyond measure how these small Indians, not 
averaging I think over 140 pounds each, could carry 100 pounds up 
such a precipitous mountain, alternately on steeply inclined glacial snow 
and treacherous rounded bowlders, where a misstep in many places 
would have hurled them hundreds of feet down the slope or precipices." 
(Reconnaisance in Alaska, p. 18.) 

" The Indian then chased the goat, almost keeping up with him, 
down into the valley where we camped, and up the steep mountain 
slopes of the eastern side, equally as high as those mentioned, and all 
this immediately after he had carried over 100 pounds across the trail." 
(Reconnaisance in Alaska, p. 17.) 

u The things were then divided into bundles or packs of as even 
weight as possible, giving some 50 or 60 pounds to each man. Ar- 
ranging these packs is a matter of no little difficulty, for the Indian 
has a great objection to altering his load after he has started, so that 
you have to give the men carrying the provisions, which grow lighter 
daily, a heavier load at starting than those who have the canteens or 
tent to carry. They generally stop for some five minutes' rest every 
half-hour. This they do with surprising regularity. They generally 
squat near a ledge of rock on which they can rest their burden without 
removing it. They carry everything the same way, viz, with a band 
over the forehead, the pack resting on their shoulder-blades or a little 
below." (Mayne's British Columbia and Vancouver Island, p. 100.) 

Col. Cecil Clay says that the commonest methods used in carrying 
from the St. Lawrence to the jumping-off place northward and from 
Labrador to the Pacific is by a u tump-line," a long strap with a broad 
band in the center. 

The Indians of the Ungrava district are often compelled, by particu- 
lar conditions of weather, to travel afoot, and while on a journey of 
this description they must carry the articles necessary to their comfort 
or the articles they desire to barter and those they receive in return 
upon their backs. In order that the arms mav be free and aid their 



THE HUMAN BEAST OF BURDEN. 261 

progress, the bundles are made as compact as their nature will permit, 
and slung across the shoulders transversely or suspended over the 
neck, and the arms passed over the thong supporting the weight behind. 

A piece of netting, made of deer-skin twisted and then netted, having 
thongs run through the outer meshes, draws the net tight over the 
bundle, which is slung as indicated above. 

The method employed by the Makah Indians in carrying burdens 
when afoot is to strap or tie the load together, whenever practicable, in 
a compact form, and then, by means of straps or belts that they weave 
themselves from rags, the "pack" is carried resting on the back, the 
strap resting against the forehead. The packing strap is woven round, 
except when it is intended to rest against the forehead ; then it is flat. 
In carrying a number of small parcels or berries, fish, clams, sea-urchins, 
small pieces of wood, and when haste in loading or unloading a canoe 
is desired, they use a basket, also woven by themselves, of different 
patterns, resting on the back and held by a strap around the forehead. 
They carry cord-wood in the same manner, the sticks lying transversely 
on the basket. 

The baskets intended for heavier articles are woven of the twip-s of a 
tree that resembles lignurn-vitse, the sides intended to rest against the 
back being flatter and broader than the others. For berries, dried 
fish, and lighter articles, the baskets are woven of the inner fiber of 
cedar bark. It may be needless to say that all this work is done by 
the women. 

The native name for the heavier basket is " kak-ow-utz," and for the 
lighter " bu hquee." Their name for the packing-strap is " de-de-quad- 
ut," derived from de-ahp (hanging) and quad-ut (handle), the com- 
bination or derivation meaning " hanging handle." 

The Makahs do not u track," there being no rivers of any size in the 
country, and the nature of the country forbidding travel along the 
banks of such as there are for any distance, the timber being very 
dense and extending to the very edge of the stream. The canoeing is 
principally on salt water. 

CARRYING LOADS. — INDIANS NEAR STILLWATER, MONTANA TER- 
RITORY. 

The men and women carry loads in a similar way. He or she takes 
a reata, or rope about the size of your finger, which is made out of buffalo- 
hair or braided elk- skin, three plait, lays it on the ground in the shape 
of an elongated U, placing the load across the legs of the letter. They 
generally get a little rise in the ground or a cut bank, but if on the level 
of a prairie they are helped to raise it by one of their number, or else 
work over on their side until they can get upon their knees, when they 
are all right. After placing their load of a hundred-pound sack of flour, 
or a quarter of a buffalo or steer, or a half cord of dry wood, they, with 
their back against it, take the curve of the rope over their head, down 



262 



EEPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 



across their breast and across their shoulders, and then taking the tow 
ends in each hand bring them up behind their back, catch the rope on 
top of the load by running each end under, then pulling ends over each 
shoulder tighten the load if loose and then raise on one side, then the 
other, to make it more secure, and with a heave forward she or he comes 
to the knees before getting on their feet. The load or burden rests on 
the back and shoulders. When moving the body is bent forward and 
the heavier the load the more the body is inclined. Have seen them 
carrying wood over four miles in this way, resting whenever they found 
a suitable place like a cut bank or a washed gully so the load will be 
even with the place and can be taken again in a minute or so.

Among the Salish tribes of Washington Territory, as well as those of 
British Columbia and southeast Alaska, twined weaving in pine root, 
cedar bark, rushes, and grasses is very common. These tribes all use 
the wallet for carrying, resting on the back, and prevented from falling 
as well as partly supported by the head-band resting on the forehead 
(Fig. 3). One specimen of wallet in the collection is a very interesting 
example of weaving. The warp threads are very far apart. The twine 
tb reads are coarse and loosely woven. At the top two rows of close 
twine run parallel with the warp. The loose euds of the weft are 
fastened off in true Indian style to imitate braiding. 



THE HUMAN BEAST OF BURDEN. 



263 



A more elaborate example of carrying-basket from Washington Ter- 
ritory is cone-shaped, like those of the Utes. Strengthening rods are 
fastened to the outsides of the cone (Fig. 4). A braid of tough fiber 
passes quite around the basket and is loose enough to pass over the 
forehead of the bearer. The weaving is close enough to hold fine seeds, 
the rushes being held in place by twined weaving and by a species of 
braiding with one thread, which will be seen better in a cradle from 
northern California, in the article on Cradles in this volume. The top 
of the basket is explained in the enlarged drawing below the figure 
showing the outside and the inside of the margin. 

Still further south are encountered the artistic tribes of northern 
California. Mr. Powers and the gentlemen of the Fish Commission 
have sent some beautiful examples of carrying-baskets from, the McCloud 
fishing Indians. One here illustrated is in twined weaving, as close 
almost as the Sitka work. The bottom is protected frequently by a 
thimble of leather (Figs. 5 and 6). The ornamentation on the outside is

produced by an overlaying of maiden-hair fern or dyed grass, and the

One of the most noteworthy specimens of carrying appliances in the 
National collection was collected by Dr. Palmer from the Mohaves of

the mouth of the Colorado River. The affair, as can be readily seen 
from the drawing, consists of two long bent poles, securely lashed to- 
gether at their middles. The four ends are fastened to a hoop at equal 
distances (Fig. 7). Warp-threads are stretched from the intersection 
at the bottom to the hoop at the top. The weaving is done by a series 
of turns around the poles and the warp-threads in passing. This is the 
most interesting sample of aboriginal weaving the writer has ever seen. 
Collected many years ago from the Mohaves it is undoubtedly a genuine 
specimen of their work. Indeed, as no white man weaves in that man- 
ner, this could not possibly be an example of borrowing. The chief in-

terest in the specimen, however, is not in its simple method of manip- 
ulation, but in the connection which it has with regions far remote. 
In Foster's Prehistoric Eaces (p. 225) is figured a piece of weaving, taken 
from the bottom of a mound in Ohio. There are three warp-threads, 
precisely as in our Mohave basket, and three weft-threads wrapped suc- 
cessively around each warp-thread in an orderly manner. Mr. Holmes, 
in speaking of impressions of textiles on pottery, draws attention to this 
interesting specimen from Foster. The writer has rolled out a large 
sheet of sculptor's clay and pressed it against the interior of this net- 
work and found that the threads held the clay in place perfectly until

it dried. On the deserts of southern Arizona one has to go a long way 
for food and fuel. It is a common thing, says Dr. Palmer, to see a Mo- 
have woman coming in with this great basket stacked full of mesquite- 
bean pods, to be broken up and ground into meal when they are dry. 
The head-band is made of coarse rags, made into a pad at the center for 
the forehead. 

Contiguous to the Mohaves, and belonging to the same Yuman stock, 
are the Pimas. (By some writers the Pimas are relegated to a separate 
stock.) Their arts are similar to those of the Mohaves. In the example 
of carrying-basket figured four rude sticks form the uprights. The 
netting is formed by a continuous coil of yucca-fiber thread caught into 
the coil beneath it. When this material is pressed flat it has the ap- 
pearance given by the drawing (Pig. 8). The head-band and the staff 
(which also serves to support the carrying-basket when the porter is 
resting) complete the outfit. The form of stitch here seen looks like 
the boundary between the 
hard coil of the California 
and interior basketry on the 
one side, and the more elab- 
orate net- work of Mexico and 
Central America. Prom the 
same region Dr. Palmer has 
collected three specimens of 
a still more elaborate device 
for carrying. It consists of 
a frame- work of four sticks, 
two of which project down- 
ward for legs. These sticks 
are attached to a hoop, which 
holds them in place above, 
but they extend some dis- 
tance above the hoop, like 
standards on a wagon, to 
hold a top load of all sorts 
of light material. There is a 
pad of cane fabric attached 
to the portion of the appara- 
tus next to the back, and a 
broad head-band also, which 
can be used on occasion (Fig. 
9). The net-work of these 
baskets is very delicately 
wrought. In reality the coarse yucca thread is coiled, as in the last ex- 
ample, but all sorts of straight or zigzag bands are produced by making 
a whole turn in the thread before passing downward through the next 
stitch of the underlying coil. This work is done with a needle and 
thread, as one may see the carrying nets and bags made in Central

America or the snow-shoes furnished with sinew among the Eskimos. 
The latter use a double-pointed needle, with the thread hole in the mid- 
dle, but the natives of Central America and Mexico employ a needle 
of wood or bone about 4 inches long and one-tenth inch in thickness. 
Around the uprights of this specimen are ropes for lashing on the load, 
and a staff, with a crutch at top, serves the double purpose of a cane 
and a rest. 

In a former paragraph allusion was made to the correlation of primi- 
tive agriculture with transportation. At the borders of Mexico gourds 
raised by rude processes begin to appear as vessels. In the example 
here figured a long gourd, holding a gallon or more, is inclosed in a 
net-work of yucca twine, laid on in coils, with half hitches above, and 
with the standard open net- work below (Fig. 10). A bandolier of com- 
mon rag furnishes the carrying-strap. This specimen was collected 
from the Pi mas by Dr. Palmer. 

The Diegenos belong to the Tuman stock, and dwell about San Diego, 
California. A rude carrying basket or wallet, collected by Dr. Palmer, 
is made of sticks in open work, held in place by a series of twined 
weft (Fig. 11). The handle is a common bale of string. There is noth-

the Great Interior Basin the Shoshonian stock have carried it much 
further southward, and even to the Pacific Ocean in southru California. 
The Shoshonian stock, especially the central tribes in Utah, are agri- 
culturists in a crude fashion. The women gather the seeds of fifty or 
more plants, fan out the chaff in a basketry tray, elsewhere described 
grind the seeds on a flat slab with a muller, and of the meal make 
cakes or mush. The gathering-basket in which this harvest is collected 
and transported is shown in the accompanying figures (12, 13). This

conical receptacle is held with the point on the ground and the rim close 
to the plants. The female harvester holds the gathering-basket with 
her left hand, and by means of a coarse fan held in the right hand 
beats the seed into the receptacle. The carrying-strap of soft buckskin 
is passed across the forehead to hold the basket high on the back. 
Thus burdened the Ute pack-woman trudges home to change her craft 
from the burden-bearer to the miller and the baker. The carrying-bas- 
ket of the Utes is made in twined weaving. The pattern is varied 
according to the number of warp-sticks included within each turn. 
The simplest incloses each rod separately ; another style takes in two, 
and the twines are always between the same pairs of warp twigs. A 
third style imitates diagonal or twill by including a different set of rods 
on each round. This has been described in another place. (Smithson. 
Eep. 1884, Pt. II.)

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 



The Utes have no pottery except what they have borrowed. Not to 
be defeated, however, in a matter so necessary to their happiness, their 
ingenuity has been equal to the occasion. Both the Utes and the 
Apaches make bottles and jars of twigs (Fig. 14) holding from half a 
pint to many gallons. These they calk with hot pitch until they are 
perfectly water-tight. On the side of this primitive demijohn lugs or

loops are fastened, and a soft buckskin head-band served through these 
enables Aquaria to bring often from a great distance water, seeds, and 
other necessaries. 

The use of the carrying-net is not common in America. Major Powell 
brought from Utah in 1874 a large collection to illustrate the life of the 
tribes there. The Utes, and indeed the tribes south of them, employ 
the net to catch rabbits and other small game. They know also how to 
turn the net into a carrying appliance. (Fig. 15.) One of the devices 
is here shown. The knot here used is the standard mesh-knot found all 
over the world, and it is interesting to find it here among the savages 
of Utah. 

In northwestern Arizona are the Moki Pueblos. The westernmost 
of these, Oraibi, is celebrated for its basketry. In addition to the twined

and coiled work, which they practice in common with their neighbors 
and blood kindred, the Utes, though with vastly greater taste and skill, 
they have somewhere learned the art of making true wicker-work. 
(Fig. 16.) This is indeed rare west of the Eocky Mountains. Two speci- 
mens are here figured, the one coarse and holding over a bushel, the 
other fine and having the capacity of a peck. Both of them are carried 
by means of a head-band. The wicker is based on a warp of rigid twigs, 
in bunches of twos or threes. The woof is made up of twigs passing 
alternately over and under the warp. In fact, it would be more correct 
to call the bent twigs the warp, because they are alternately raised and

lowered as if with a weaver's harness, while the straight twigs pass 
along the openings just as the warp does in common weaving. The 
method of fastening off the wicker twigs is shown in the detail of the 
coarser pattern. (Figs. 17, 18.) Baskets of this very pattern are found 
at Znfii, but the opinion obtains that the basketry of this region belongs 
especially to the Shoshonian and the Apache-Tinne" stock. Barter is 
going on all the time, and it is difficult to follow tribal characteristics 
under such circumstances. 

The Zuni and most of the Eio Grande pueblos are famous for their 
pottery. The pack-men and the pack-women here distinguish them- 
selves, especially for the ease and grace with which they carry water 
and other burdens on the head. Here comes in the head-ring or burden- 
pad, specimens of which are figured (Figs. 19, 20). They are made either 
by wrapping a bundle of soft bast or grass into a ring, as in the top

figure, or by weaving a ring of yucca fiber neatly around a mass of the 
shredded fiber. This ring is placed upon the head and the round-bot- 
tomed jar upon that. When the jar is set down the ring still is made 
to support it and keep it in an upright position. Many jars have a 
concavity beneath, which really seems to be an afterthought. It is only 
a seeming, however, as there is no evidence either way. In comparison 
with the Zuni water-carrier is shown an Italian girl in Palermo perform- 
ing the same feat. It is only a short step from this figure to the cary- 
atid, in which architecture glorifies in marble one of the humblest oc- 
cupations of humanity. (Fig. 21.)

The Pueblo Indians, like the Eskimo above described, use the breast- 
strap in dragging loads. They have the clumsy wooden Spanish cart 
and the diminutive burro, but there are occasions when the man or the 
woman is regularly hitched up to drag a load up the precipitous mesas, 
where even a burro could not climb. The breast-strap is made of yucca 
fiber woven in diagonal patterns, and forms a very efficient harness. 
This strap, however, is even more likely to be rested across the fore- 
head than upon the breast. (Fig. 22.) 

The Apaches are extremely artistic in their manufacture of appliances 
for burden-bearing. The carrying basket, here figured, is made of rods 
sewed together by the coiled process. Ornamentation is effected by the

manner of stitching, by using different-colored material, and by sewing 
on strips of soft, white buckskin, to the lower end of which are attached 
the small hoofs of deer or bits of tin rolled up. (Fig. 23.) The method 
of carrying burdens among the Apaches is shown in the next figure, of 
a woman bearing the cradle frame hung to the top of her head. Note 
here the position of the strap high up on the head, as suggesting the 
inquiry whether various uses and abuses of the head may not have con- 
tributed to its deformation. (Fig. 24.)

Before passing southward it is well to consider the habits of the In- 
dians east of the Rocky Mountains. No less than their western neigh- 
bors were they formerly accustomed to carry heavy burdens, For this

purpose they used baskets, hampers, wallets, par-fleche cases, skin 
bottles, skin wallets, aod every other receptacle hitherto described. 
(Figs. 25, 26.) In some of the mounds that have been carefully ex- 
amined little strise showed that about a peck of earth constituted the 
separate loads of dirt which were doubtless scraped up near by and 
carried on the head or back in baskets to the mound. The first settlers 
found the aborigines carrying on a respectable commerce, and using 
inventions that were truly labor-saving machines.

Fortunately a beautiful example of a carrying apparatus was gath- 
ered forty years ago from the Arikara and Mandan area. (Fig. 26.) 
Its composition is worthy of our closest study Four bent poles com 
stitute the frame-work, two of them with a wide interspace, the other 
two narrow, like an ox-yoke bow. The two wide bows are placed nearly 
parallel and about 10 inches apart at top and 4 at bottom. The nar- 
row ones cross these at right angles nearly, only they are spread a 
little at top. They are also as far apart as the length of the basket 
demands. These two narrow bows descend inches to afford a rest for

illation, narrow strips of birch, or other tough bark, some of them 
having the dark, others the light side exposed. This gives a pretty 
figured effect to the surface. 
Mexico is the land of carriers. The early chroniclers mention over 

and over the employment of pro- 
fessional bearers by the rulers 
of the ancient city. Indeed, the 
mountainous condition of the 
country has kept alive the prac- 
tice of using men for beasts of 
burden up to the present time, 
when the very best substitute 
is the pack-mule. Travelers in 
modern Mexico refer to regular 
caravans of peons, who are to be 
seen entering the city from every 
direction, bringing to market 
every kind of commodity. Even 
the butchers send their meat 
around on the backs of men. 
The Mexican carrier is a student 
of attitudes, to the extent that 
there is not a position of his 
body adapted to burden-bearing 
with which he is not familiar. 

One specimen of basket in the 
National Museum is made of split 
cane, woven in diaper. (Figs. 28, 
29.) It holds about a bushel, 
but in some cases the top load is 
greater than the contents of the basket. The strap passes beneath the 
basket up to the two loops midway. It extends just around the 
shoulders to the breast-bone in front. The head-band is also used in 
Central America, but the breast-strap has not appeared since we left 
Alaska. In the figure of the carrier here presented, quite an elaborate 
back-pad is shown. In the Pima specimen a pad of this sort is attached 
to the basket, but in the Mexican example the pad is attached to the 
man. It consists of a large piece of soft leather, folded several times, 
hung to the neck above, and held down at the bottom by a belt around 
the waist. (Figs. 29, 30.) The Pima carrier, therefore, has but one 
basket, while the Mexican is detachable from his basket, and padded 
for any load whatever. 

The human yoke is probably a foreign invention to Mexico. It is a 
common sight now to see a man with a stout strip of wood on his 
shoulder, from either end of which depends ajar by means of a strap, 
as shown in the figure. These jars hold about two gallons each of

water, pulque, flour, beans, etc. The frame at the bottom of the draw- 
ing holds two of these jars. Other frames hold three or more. One of 
these frames on either side of a burro makes up a pack, when the load 
is easily transferred from the pack-man to the pack-mule. The pottery 
is made in the mountainous districts, and one may frequently see mule- 
trains coming along, their packs filled with pottery of this kind, (Fig. 
31.)

Another method of hitching up mankind has crept into Mexico, 
namely, the wheelbarrow. The drawing here given is an exact copy 
of a Guadalajara potter's conception of the happy wheelbarrow man, 
his machine made entirely of wood, the shafts supported by a strap 
hung from one shoulder and passing under the right arm. (Fig. 32.)

rear of a Mexican army, almost every soldier baving some woman who 
belongs to him, who carries a heavy load of Indian corn and babies, 
and cooks tortillas for her lord and master. The number of these 
poor creatures who perish in the wars is very great."

(After W. H. Holmes.) 
Observe the parts of the body involved. 

Mrs. Polhemus, in her " Woman's Work for Woman,' 7 speaks thus of 
the Mexican burden-bearers : " Who are these two men coming towards 
us, and what do they carry? The first is bearing to the city nothing 
less than a load of wash-tubs. Very primitive they are, as you may see, 
yet clothes will come from them as white and beautiful as any you 
may have washed in your stationary tubs at home, with all the modern 
improvements. Our next friend carries a bundle of wood, picked up 
outside the city, and how precious those crooked sticks are you would 
never guess till you tried to buy them. Here comes the baker's boy, 
with his great flat basket, nicely balanced on his head, and filled with 
fresh rolls and sweetened breads for your afternoon chocolate; then 
comes an Indian woman with a great bundle of charcoal strapped to 
her back, a baby tucked into her rebozo in front, and beyond walks 
another, bearing on her head an earthen jar. In Guatemala this is the 
way they carry milk, but here in Mexico City the jar is more likely to 
contain water, either for bathing or drinking. On the corner stands a 
porter, waiting and ready for a few cents to hoist to his back your 
heaviest Saratoga trunk and transport it whither you will. Here comes 



278

another Indian woman. A few peas, beans, and perhaps peppers are 
tied up in a blanket, which is knotted around her neck. She stops at 
doors, calls out her wares, and trots along till she is sold out and her 
blanket empty; and so, as we pass along, do you notice how much in 
Mexico is carried by men and still oftener by Indian women."

It is well known that the ancient Mexicans worked in the silver mines. 
The art of mining is about as primitive now in Mexico as formerly. The 
ore is placed in rude bags or baskets. The carriers work their way to 
the surface by means of notched poles put across a part of the shaft in a 
zigzag fashion, and they then give their load to the breakers, who knock 
the ore into pieces exactly as if they were going to macadamize a road. 
(Mexico Illustrated, Mark Beaufoy, p. 268.) 

Mr. W. A. Croffut speaks as follows about the remarkable carrying 
capacity of those ubiquitous porters of Mexico, the cargadores : 

"In every part of the country have I observed them patiently following 
the trails and carrying immense loads on their backs. I recollect seeing, 
four years ago, near a railroad station, half a dozen of them squatting 
on the ground, resting. One had a sofa upon his shoulders, strapped 
on I could not see how; another bore a tower of chairs locked into each 
other and rising not less than 8 feet above his head; another carried a

279 



hen-coop with a dozen or twenty hens, and others were conveying laden 
barrels and various household goods. They had come, they said, from 
San Luis Potosi, not less than 50 miles distant. These cargadores will 
cover 30 miles a day for a week or more, going from ocean to Gulf.

(After a figure in the U. S. National Museum, by a Guadalajara potter. ) 

"During a ride which I made over the Andes, on the Mexican National 
Railroad, these persistent carriers were almost always in sight from the 
car windows, the peons and burros following each other up and down 
the slopes. The vice-president of the road, Thomas C. Purely, whose 
guest I was, said, as we watched these animated trains advancing on 
parallel lines, ' There is our rival. That is the only transportation 
company we fear. If it were not for that line, this country would treble 
its railroads next year, and the roads would double their profits. We 
are combating the custom of centuries. Those fellows carry on their 
backs to Mexico the entire crops of great haciendas far over the mount- 
ains. I have been and sat down with a wealthy and enterprising haci- 
enclado, and explained to him that we could do his carrying in a quarter 
of the time and for half the cost, and have seen him refuse to change, 
and stubbornly stick to the old method. I was never before so im- 
pressed with the tremendous force of habit.' " 

All the salt produced in Salinas is carried away on the backs and heads 
of men, who come for it (many from great distances) and sell it at home 
or in a suitable market. In Guatemala every thing — with the exception 
of grain, vegetables, and sugar, which are transported on beasts of 
burden — is carried on the heads of men, there being no cart-road of any 
length except that from the port to the capital. The articles to be car- 
ried are adjusted into a package higher than wide, and secured by a 
net, called red. To the back part of this pack, near its base, is fastened 



280 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

a strap of rawhide, the two ends of which are attached to another strap, 
called tapal, of the size and form of a large hand. The burden is placed 
on a stone, or some other elevated object, and the man, stooping down, 
puts the tapal on the top of his head, and lifting his burden trots off 
with it. When a paterfamilias, going on a journey, has baggage to 
carry, either his wife or one of his children accompanies him to carry 
his XDrovisions. A professional carrier dispenses with such company 
and secures vhis provisions on the top of the load. In most instances 
his food consists of tortillas and a few peppers as a condiment, to which, 
exceptionally, some boiled beans are added. Carriers always take with 
them, in a little bag, some meal of toasted maize mixed with scraped 
brown sugar (dulce). A handful of this mixture put in hot water forms 
their only beverage, for they never touch fresh water, and whatever they 
drink must be warm. For preparing this beverage every one carries 
with him a small iron pot. All these articles are put in a netted bag, 
called matate. There are, at certain intervals on the road, places where 
the carriers rest during the day or at night. Sach places are generally 
near to a brook, if there is one by the road, or to a rancho, where there 
are always some sticks of wood left glimmering by the previous party 
for making a fire and preparing the drink (pinol). The usual weight 
of a man's load is from 4 to 5 arrobas, an arroba being fixed by law at 
25 pounds. Occasionally a man will carry a great deal more for a short 
distance. To protect the load from rain every carrier takes with him 
a kind of cloak (soyacal) made of the leaflets of a palm, stitched to- 
gether in such manner as to overlap each other and form a short cone 
with a broad base. This cloak is rolled up and secured to one side of 
the load, indicating the nationality of the bearer; for by this he is at 
once recognized as an inhabitant of Guatemala whenever he comes to 
the neighboring states. This mode of carrying loads is undoubtedly 
the cause of the fashion in which men wear their hair, which is clipped 
short in front and on the top of the head, but allowed to grow to some 
length on the back part. A similar fashion is observed by the Hanaks, 
the inhabitants of the fertile plain of Central Moravia. The hair on the 
top of the head of a professional carrier becomes much abraded. 

A specimen of carrying frame from British Honduras begins to fore- 
shadow the apparatus used in the Andes for transporting travelers. It 
consists of a stout wooden frame like the seat of a child's carriage elon- 
gated, and is fastened to the back as in the Mexican basket carrier. 
All sorts of luggage are brought within the lines of the British trading 
posts on the backs of men in frames of this sort. (Fig. 33.) 

The far-famed coffee-carriers of Bio usually go in troops, numbering 
ten or twenty individuals, of whom one takes the lead and is called 
the captain. These are generally the largest and strongest men that 
can be found. While at work they seldom wear any other garment 
than a pair of short pantaloons ; their shirt is thrown aside for the time 
as an incumbrance. Each one takes upon his head a bag of coffee,

Coffee-carrier of Rio.

Slaves are almost the only carriers of burdens in Eio Janeiro. They 
go almost naked and are exceedingly numerous. They appear to work 
with cheerfulness, and go together in gangs with a leader, who carries 
a rattle filled with stones, similar to a child's rattle. With this he keeps 
time, causing them all to move on in a dog-trot. Each one joins in the 
monotonous chorus, the notes seldom varying above a third from the 
key. The words they use are frequently relative to their own country, 
sometimes to what they beard from their master as they started with 
their load, but the sound is the same. 

The coffee-carriers go in gangs of twenty or thirty. In singing, one- 
half take the air, with one or two keeping up a kind of bum on the 
common chord, and the remainder finish the bar. These slaves are re- 
quired by their masters to obtain a certain sum, according to their 
ability, say from 25 to 50 cents a day, and pay it every evening. The 
surplus belongs to themselves. In default of not gaining the requisite 
sum, castigation is always inflicted. The usual load is about 200 pounds. 
(Wilkes.)

Iii Rio Janeiro as well as in the United States and the West Indies 
may be seen in perfection the African toting on the head. This prac- 
tice does not seem to have been a favorite one among the American 
aborigines, if we except the water-carriers of the interior basin of the 
United States. In the coffee- carriers of Eio as well as among the steve- 
dores of all our sea-ports and commercial towns, the load rests partly on 
the head and partly on the top of the scapulae, there being local vari- 
ations of the method running from support on the head alone to support 
on the scapulas alone. The method is an exceedingly convenient one 
either for unloading or for emptying the sack. 




Fig. 35. 
Negroes in Rio Janeiro, Brazil, acting as draught animals. 

(From an old print.) 

From Rio we have also an old sketch, after Wilkes, illustrating the 
use of man as a draft animal. (Fig. 35.) All over the world the 
"push-cart" is known. Nothing is commoner in Washington than the 
sight of a negro with his little two- 
wheeled cart, moving at a dog-trot, 
with a light load of everything con- 
ceivable. The freight of one of these 
carts rarely exceeds the quarter of a 
ton, but the draft-man moves much 
faster than a horse or a mule. The 
climax of -this process of using men 
for draft is seen on the monuments 
of Egypt, where hundreds of them 
are hitched to a single sledge. The 
romantic survival presents itself 
everywhere in firemen's processions, 
the car of Juggernaut, the triumphal 
car. 

A negro dray team in Rio consists 
of five stalwart Africans pushing, 
pulling, steering, and shouting as 
they make their way amid the ser- 
ried throng. Now an omnibus thun- 
ders through the crowd, and a large 
four-wheeled wagon, belonging to some company for the transportation 
of " goods," crashes in its wake. Formerly all this labor was performed

by human hands, and scarcely a cart or a dray was used iu the city, 
unless, indeed, it was drawn by negroes. Carts and wagons propelled 
by horsepower are now quite common; but for the moving of light 
burdens and for the transportation of furniture, pianos, etc., the negro's 
head has not been superseded by any vehicle. (Kidder and Fletcher, 
Brazil and the Brazilians, page 29.) 

The Napos Indians, of Ecuador, also use the head-band to support 
the basket ; the staff is also introduced to throw a portion of the load 
upon the arms and turns the bearer into a veritable quadruped. (Fig. 
35 A.) 

In the island of Madeira is also seen the rudimentary form of loading 
up two or more men. The primitive palankiu is simply a hammock 
swung on a pole, with ornamental awning and so forth to suit the rider. 
We will pause a moment to scrutinize this apparatus. (Fig. 36.) When-

ever a man wishes to carry a stick of timber he finds the center of 
gravity and places that upon his shoulder. It is only a slight step 
forward to make the stick lighter and add weights on either end, as do 
the Mexican carrier and Chinese cooly. Kevolve the pole ninety de- 
grees so as to be perpendicular to the line of progression and we have 
the typical Holland yoke. We are proceeding here, as always, on the 
supposition that the human mind sets *ever before itself the problem 
how to get the greatest result with the least effort. This involves in 
the case in hand a study of padding, fitting, re&ting, etc., all of which 
things have their local methods of treatment. 

Again, suppose two men have a log or plank to carry between them, 
each rests one end of the load on his shoulder. This is the first step 
in that varied apparatus which becomes in different lands palankiu, 
bier, filanzana, in which rank or circumstance make one set of men the 
carriers of another. Many of the peasantry are employed as carriers, 
and one is much struck by their numbers as they euter Funchal early

in the morning with sheep-skins filled with wine upon their shoulders, 

looking at a distance more like 
a live animal than a filled skin. 
The skins are preserved entire, 
even the legs of the animal being 
retained. (Fig. 37.) These bur- 
dens are kept steady by a band 
that passes over the forehead, 
which supports a great part of 
the weight. About 25 gallons, 
weighing more than 200 pounds, 
is a load. They move rapidly and 
carry this load for a mere trifle. 
To us a remarkable feature in the 
population was to see a female not 
only thus employed, but a stout 
mountain lass trudging up a steep 
path with ease under a load that 
would have staggered one of our 
Fi „ 37 laborers even a short distance.

are bearers, and they rest them- 
selves by supporting the load 
on crutch-like staves, since they 
can not set it down. (Fig. 36.) 

A sledge, about 6 feet in 
length, 20 inches wide, and 6 or 
8 inches high, with two strips 
of hard wood fastened together 
for runners, used to transport 
pipes of wine, is the only vehicle 
employed in Madeira. Figured

water-carrier is introduced here 
(Fig. 38) for the purpose of trac- 
ing the head-band and the skin

pulque-gatherer of Mexico uses 
the skin of a hog in collecting 
the crude juice of the plant; 
the Eskimo employs the closed 
skin for a water-carrier as well 
as for a float. All over the 
Orient and in Africa the goat

the water and the wine carrier. A load of this kind rests on no particu- 
lar portion of the back, adjusting itself perfectly to head, neck, should- 
ers, and back. 

The paternity of the modern knapsack appears in the carrying-basket 
of Holland represented in the figure. (Figs. 39, 40.) This method of

hitching up the pack-woman can not be very ancient. It is not widely 
spread among the aborigines of America, where the woman is the bearer 
aud the man goes on ahead to do the fighting or hunting. To all ap- 
pearances this is a sacrifice of great weight to the labor-saving scheme 
of joining the bearer and the warrior in one individual. Hence the sol- 
dier discards the head-strap or the breast-strap, and adopts the knap- 
sack. (Fig. 41.) 

In an example of head-strap from Africa we have a repetition of one 
from Montana, in which the pack-man becomes, as it were, his own driver. 
He puts the sack, or bundle of fagots or what not, on the two lines 
about the middle. He then backs up to his load, inserts his forehead 
into the head-band, and seizing the lines by the outer ends rolls his 
load upon his back. In the same manner grocers roll barrels of goods 
up aud down the cellar skids. (Fig. 42.) 

A very neat and ingenious framework for burden-bearing comes from

the Congo region. Two stout palm leaves are laid about a foot apart 
and thedeaflets on their adjacent sides are braided together. The leaf-

lets on their outer margins are twisted into short cords and then braided 
into a continuous margin for the frame. (Fig. 43.) This apparatus is 
loaded with the greatest variety of merchandise, to be carried to and 
from the coast in trade. 

"The Madis of Africa make admirable porters, being very careful of 
the loads intrusted to them, and display no little forethought and inge- 
nuity in preserving them from injury. The rule is that no load should ex- 
ceed 50 pounds in weight, and that it should be either square or oblong, 
the latter being preferred. They always carry the load on the head on 
a pad made of grass, very rarely steadying it with the hand unless going 
over very rough ground. They strongly object to carry loads over 50 
pounds, but if pressed will take them up to 70 pounds, if the distance to 
be marched is not more than three days and extra food is given them. 
Loads of 100 or ]20 pounds are carried by two men, hung on a pole, 
which they balance on their heads, but they do not like the work. If 
a very heavy load has to be carried, e. #., a man, they place him on a 
native bed and carry him, two at a time, changing relays of men at 
about each mile. This they prefer to carrying by four men at once. I 
can testify from personal experience that it is far better to be carried 
by two men than four, for they go much more easily and do not run 
against so many trees or overhanging branches. The relief men march 
before those who are bearers and cry out when obstacles occur. 

As regards distance they carry loads of 50 pounds 20 miles a day, for 
eight or ten consecutive days, without showing signs of distress, but

on the march they appear to require a great deal of water, and will 
sooner burden themselves with a gourd fall than go without it for more 
than two hours at a time. If they go by a road where water is scarce, 
they generally take a few women or children with them to carry it. 
When they arrive at a stream all loads are put down, and they bathe, 
if the water is deep, or sit down and wash themselves, if it be shallow,

and then take a long drink. The Madis can scarcely be prevailed upon 
to march at night, even in bright moonlight, on account of bad roads, 
which is strange, as their eye-sight is remarkably good. Neither will 
they start until the dew is entirely off the grass, or if made to do so by 
promises of reward, they tie bunches of grass or skins before them to 
avoid as much as possible being wetted by the dew. 

In crossing a river of 4 or 5 feet deep they stand in the water in a 
double row and hand the loads from one to the other. Should the 
stream be very strong, they break down branches which have broad 
forks, and placing one end firmly in the bed of the stream lean against 
the fork, and so get the needed support. They march at a quick pace, 
but generally halt for ten or twenty minutes after each 3 or 4 miles. 

In carrying the Egyptian post these men make long and quick

The open palankin or chair has reached an excellent differentiation in 
Madagascar. A traveler sits in a leather seat, made to fit the body, at- 
tached to the two bearing poles and having a stirrup for the feet. To 
the poles are also attached the traveler's gun, haversack, assagais, and 
other necessary apparatus. 

The frame rests upon the shoulders of four carriers, who trot along 
with the load until they get tired. Extra bearers shift the load upon 
their shoulders without stopping. In this method of relaying the bear- 
ers are enabled to carry the traveler oftimes a hundred miles a day. 
This same method of bearing and relaying is found also in Africa, and 
furnishes an advanced and quite complicated system of transportation.

" The average load of a coolie," says Mr. Neumann, " is 100 pounds, 
and with this he travels 30 miles. Kinkiang is an important place for 
the export of tea. The tea districts are situated about 60 miles from 
the town, and the coolies bring in the chests in two days, each man 
carrying a load of 100 pounds. 

" The weight of a load and the distance over which a cooly travels, 
may be different in the north or south. I have not been able to make 
inquiries elsewhere but at this port."

EEPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 



The shoulder-pole, or carrying-pole, assumes as many forms in China 
and Japan as the ingenuity of one-fourth of the human race has been 
able to devise. Inasmuch as they all operate on the same plan, a de- 
scription of a very simple one in the National Museum will suffice for 
the whole series. 

The essential parts of a Chinese carrier's outfit are, first, a stout strip 
of bamboo, 6 feet oj? more long, wide in the middle, and having knobs or 
notches at either end. 

The middle of this apparatus rests on either shoulder of the bearer, 
and from the notched ends, with or without suspending strings, hangs 
the well-balanced load. The bearer carries a staff in hand, upon the 
top of which he may support his load while resting. 

The wheelbarrow reaches its highest perfection in China (Fig. 48). 




Fig. 48. 
Chinese Barrow with two sides, for burdens or passengers. 

(From a photograph in the U. S. National Museum.) 

The man of burden is harnessed by means of his hands acting as stirrups, 
and a rope or strap passing from the shafts over his neck. To his rope 
or band he gives the effect of a trace by fastening it to the shaft some 
distance behind the hand. 

The wheel is, moreover, in the center of the barrow, so that the 
downward pressure on the shoulders is far less than in our European 
barrows. 

The load of this apparatus is disposed around the wheel, with some 
attention to the center of gravity ; and the disposing of men, pigs, mer-

ckandise, and household effects, with this sole object in view, gives to 
some of the Chinese loaded barrows rather a romantic effect. 

The Japanese back is one of the best in the world, and the people 
have repeated many of the Chinese methods of burden bearing. The 
most frequent method of burden bearing is the bamboo basket, suspended 
from the shoulders in like manner to the knapsack. (Fig. 49.) 

The palankin of Japan is also very similar to that of China. In 
both countries, especially in the latter, on ceremonial occasions, frames 
and other devices have been invented for hitching up a great number of 
men, aud thus of securing the advantage of combined effort. This

should not be overlooked in studying the civilization of countries that 
became quite elevated without our modern appliances. 

Any knowledge of Aino culture at this time is valuable, when a sys- 
tematic effort is being made to discover the relationships of this primi- 
tive people. For carrying burdens the Ainos use a frame, like a small 
trellis or ladder, around which braided cord is wrapped to furnish a bed 
for the load. (Fig. 50.) 



292 



EEPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 



This frame is attached to tlie body by means of shoulder-ropes braided 
so as to be thick, and padded in the portions against the shoulders. 

This is quite primitive as a carrying device, and has its counterpart 
only among the rude carriers of America and Africa. 

The palankin of Corea is an empty 
cube 2£ feet each way. Little win- 
dows look out in front and on either 
side, each fitted with a pair of slid- 
ing screens. Into these are let tiny 
panes of glass 2 inches square. Two 
men carry this box and divide the 
burden by means of a yoke, with 
straps that fit over the ends of the 
poles to which the box is fastened, 
two other men accompaning as re- 
lief. Each man is armed with a 
stick, which is used to insert under 
the chair and lift it up to ease their 
fellows. (Percival Lowell, Choson, 
p. 50.) 

The same author informs us that 
there is not a single wheel in Corea, 
the palankin being the only means 
of conveyance. 

One of the most primitive illus- 
trations of carrying on the shoulder 
is furnished by a copy of a small 
photograph, taken in the Karen hill 
country by the Eev. R. M. Luther.

A boy is returning home with two bread- 
fruits attached to the stock by their 
natural stem. The pole on the shoulder, 
with a weight depending from either 
end, is the commonest device of the pro- 
fessional carrier throughout this whole 
regiou. And in this picture we have 
the ancestor of every Chinese coolie 
art, of the principal part of Japanese, 
Siamese, and Polynesian carrying on the 
shoulder. 

Indeed the Karen bread-fruit picker 
is at a single view the primitive agri- 
culturist, taking his load at once from 
nature and the primitive agent of trans- 
port;) (ion.

offshoot of the Chinese, coolie's double load is found in Siain. The pole 
rests on the shoulder, and on either end is suspended a long, daintily 
woven hamper. A wooden bottom protects the basket from injury, 
and the holes for the insertion of the pole are arranged like grommets 
by means of bamboo sewing. (Fig. 52.) 

Cords are provided, both for 
the attachment of the top load 
and the convenience of the 
bearer. In all the Siamese car- 
rying apparatus from Siam in 
the National Museum the work- 
manship is of the most delicate 
character. The baskets are wov- 
en of split rattan, and the stitch- 
ing compares favorably with 
that of our best California weav- 
ers. 

Compare the Siamese with the 
Saudwich Island pack, and the 
rude parentage of the Siamese 
method may be seen. (Fig. 53.) 
Captain Wilkes long ago said of 
the Hawaiian carriers: "One 



can not but be struck with see- 
ing the natives winding their 
way along the different thor- 
oughfares laden with all kinds 
of provisions, wood, charcoal, 
and milk, to supply the mar- 
ket and their regular customers. 
Their mode of carrying burdens is to suspend them with cords from 
the ends of a stick; this is laid across the shoulders, and so accustomed 
are they to carry the load in this manner that they will sometimes in- 
crease the weight by adding a heavy stone in order to balance it. The 
stick on which they carry their load is made of the Hibiscus tiliaceus, 
which is light and tough. Instead of baskets they use a kind of gourd 
which grows to a large size. These are thin and brittle, but with the 
care the natives take of them are extremely serviceable. They are 
used for almost everything. It takes two gourds to make one of the 
baskets used for transporting articles, the smaller one being turned 
over the opening cut in the larger one, effectually protecting the con- 
tents from rain. Some of these gourds will contain upwards of two 
bushels. The gait of the Kanaka moving with his load is a quick trot, 
and he takes very short steps." (Wilkes.) 

The carrying net of the Utes of Utah and Colorado re-appears in the 
Papuan area in the shape of a bow of wood, the space between being

In the vast majority of the islands in the great oceanic area the human 
burden-bearer is transformed into the human propeller, most of the 
savage life here being passed on the water ; but it is curious to notice 
that hand-work even here precedes machine work, in that men, women, 
and children are the most expert swimmers in the world. 

il The women of New Britain," says Mr. W. Powell,* " carry their 
babies in net-work bags, the band or strap of which comes round the 
forehead, and the child in the bag rests on their shoulder blades, and in 
traveling to market and elsewhere, should the child require suckling, 
they do it over the shoulder. 

"They will also carry on their backs two or three cocoanut-mat bags 
full of merchandise, as well as the baby; this gives them a stooping 
gait and makes them always walk in a doubled-up manner, even when 
not carrying anything."

THE HUMAN BEAST OF BURDEN. 295 

It would be a fascinating task to note the thousand and one devices 
by means of which mankind have shifted their burdens upon the backs 
of animals, upon the winds and the waters. The authorities of the U. S. 
National Museum have organized a section of Transportation and ap- 
pointed to the curatorship Mr. J. E. Watkins, to whom I shall leave the 
task of working out the subsequent chapters in the history of this 
subject. 



ETHN0-C0NCH0L06Y-A STUDY OF PRIMITIVE MONEY. 



By Robert E. C. Stearns. 



The study of Nature leads through enchanted fields, full of new sur- 
prises and fresh delights. Whichever path we pursue, vistas open on 
either side equally inviting, with every charm of life and form and 
color, ever changing but never old. 

" Who," wrote P. P. Carpenter, "has not admired the beauty of shells, 
the luster of the Cowries, the polish of the Olives, the painting of the 
Cones, the varied layers of the Cameos, the exquisite nacre of Mother- 
of Pearl? Who has not listened to the mysterious 'sound of the sea' 
in the Whelks and Helmets, or wondered at the many chambers of the 
Nautilus? What child ever went to the sea-shore without picking up 
shells; or what lady ever spurned them as ornaments of her parlor ? 
Shells are at once the attraction of the untutored savage, the delight 
of the refined artist, the wonder of the philosophic zoologist, and the 
most valued treasures of the geologist. They adorn the sands of sea- 
girt isles and continents now, and they form the earliest 'footprints on 
the sands of time ' in the history of our globe. The astronomer wan- 
dering through boundless space with the grandest researches of his in- 
tellect and the most subtle workings of his analysis, may imagine indeed 
the history of past time and speculate on the formation of globes, but 
his science presents us with no records of the past ; but the geologist, 
after watching the ebb of the ocean tide, examines into the soil on the 
surface of the earth and finds in it a book of chronicles, the letters of 
which are not unknown hieroglyphics but familiar shells." 

Conchology, or the study of shells, in itself one of the most delightful 
studies, in its ethnological aspect is also full of interest. 

Aside from the use of various species of mollusks as articles of human 
food all the world over, we find that several forms belonging to this di- 
vision of the animal kingdom have in the past been curiously interwoven 
with the affairs of men, both in civilized and barbarous communities. 

Some of these are still in use as of old, but to a comparatively limited 
extent. 

As we follow the direction of ethno conchological inquiry over the 
pathway of dead centuries, we catch glimpses of great events — events 
phenomenal, picturesque, aud impressive ; important in their time, char- 
acteristic of the period or epoch which they mark and in which they oc- 

297 



298 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

curred, and it seems strange that forms of animal production so insig- 
nificant should have had any connection therewith. 

PEARL-BEARING MUSSELS. 

The fresh- water mussels are widely distributed over the surface of the 
globe; the rivers and minor water-courses of the northern hemisphere 
contain a great number of species, and individuals of these species are 
wonderfully abundant. The freshets which swell the streams and tear 
away their banks, and make their waters turbid with silt, carry into the 
soft parts of the mussels particles of sand which irritate the delicate tis- 
sues. This irritation causes a flow of nacreous lymph, which is deposited 
on and coats over the rough surface of the disturbing atoms, or it may 
be that a shriveled egg-case of the mollusk itself becomes similarly 
lodged and causes a similar annoyance and is coated with nacre in the 
same way. And so a pearl is commenced, and afterward receives coat- 
ing upon coating until the accumulated deposits of nacre have reached 
a thickness that gives the pearl not only size but translucency and iri- 
descence, and if the color is good and the shape symmetrical, a pearl of 
value, a precious pearl, is formed. And so in Nature's laboratory an 
aborted egg or a grain of sand is transformed into a thing of beauty. 

THE INVASION OF BRITAIN BY THE ROMANS (B. C. 55). 

The pearls of Great Britain were famous throughout Europe in the 
century before Christ. They were obtained from the fresh-water mus- 
sels (Margaritana margaritifera) of the mountain rivers and streams. 
Doubtless the extent of the fishery was exaggerated, and the value of 
the yield in pearls greatly overestimated. History has preserved the 
tradition that it was this source of wealth that tempted the Eomans to 
the shores of that country in the year 55 B. 0., and ancient writers re- 
fer to the shield studded with British pearls which Caesar* suspended 
as an offering in the temple of Venus at Bome.f 

It is highly probable that the invasion of Britain by this famous gen- 
eral was not for the single purpose of punishing the Britons for the as- 
sistance they had rendered to the Veniti of Brittany, with whom Cresar 
was at war, but with an eye to the pearls, which in his time were far 
more highly prized than at the present day. 

The invasion of Britain by the Romans, in daring and romance must 
yield the palm to the enterprise and expeditions of the Spanish con- 
quistadores centuries later. 

THE CONQUEST OF FLORIDA BY DE SOTO. 

"Never was the spirit of wild adventure more universally diffused 
than at the dawn of the sixteenth century. The wondrous discoveries 

His journey in Britaiu was attributed by Suetonius to .avarice, whicb bad beeu 
kindled by tbe report of enormous pearls of fine quality to be found in that country,

of Columbus and his hardy companions and followers, the descriptions 
of the beautiful summer isles of the west, and the tales of unexplored 
regions of wealth locked uj) in unbounded wildernesses, had an effect 
upon the imaginations of the young and the adventurous not unlike 
the preaching of the chivalric crusades for the recovery of the Holy 
Sepulchre. The gallant knight, the servile retainer, the soldier of for- 
tune, the hooded friar, the painstaking mechanic, the toilful husband- 
mau, the loose profligate, and the hardy mariner, all were touched with 
the pervading passion ; all left home, country, friends, wives, children, 
loves, to seek some imaginary EMorado, confidently expecting to return 
with countless treasure."* 

The glamour of wealth in gold and silver, the precious metals and 
precious pearls, the presents of these articles made by the kindly, hos- 
pitable, and unsuspecting natives to the Spanish captain, Diego Miruelo, 
and to the subsequent visitors to their country connected with de Ayl- 
lon's enterprise, was followed in 1539 "by the most splendid expedition 
that had yet set out for the New World," commanded by Hernando He 
Soto, and the conquest of Florida was soon an accomplished fact. The 
Portuguese and Spanish chroniclers of the exploits and adventures of 
De Soto and his men have given fabulous accounts of the quantities of 
pearls seen in the possession of the natives. One Portuguese narrator 
says "they obtained fourteen bushels of pearls" from a certain sepulchre, 
and at another place in the text it is stated that a common foot soldier, 
whose name is given as Juan Terron, had " a linen bag, in which were six 
pounds of pearls," and pearls are elsewhere spoken of that are "as large 
as filberts." Garcillasso de la Vega says "while De Soto sojourned in 
the province of Ichiaha the cacique visited him one day and gave him a 
string of pearls about two fathoms long. This present might have been 
a valuable one if the pearls had not been pierced, for they were all of 
equal size and as large as hazelnuts." That pearls were abundant and 
that great quantities were seen in the possession of the natives has 
been fairly corroborated in these later times. Within a few years a 
great number have been discovered in aboriginal graves. 

Professor Putnam t has stated that in excavating the mounds near 
Madisonville, Indiana, not less than fifty thousand pearls were found, 
most of them pierced and injured by heat. Squier and Davis found 
them on the hearths of five distinct groups of mounds in Ohio, and 
sometimes in such abundance that they could be gathered by the hun- 
dred. Like the British pearls, these also were obtained from the fresh- 
water mussels of the rivers and streams, from shells of various species, 
all different from the British form. 

Before proceeding to the main theme of this paper mention may be 
made of the Pectens or scallop-shells, which have a place in history and 
in song. "In the days when Ossian sang, the flat valves were the plates, 
the hollow ones the drinkiug-cups of Fingal and his heroes." f

300 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

THE CRUSADES AND PILGRIMAGES OF THE MIDDLE AGES. 

The common Mediterranean shell (Pectenjacobceus) or St. James's shell 
was, during the Middle Ages, worn by pilgrims to the Holy Land, and 
became the badge of several orders of knighthood. "When the monks 
of the ninth century converted the fisherman of Genneseret into a Span- 
ish warrior they assigned him the scallop-shell for his 'cognizance.'"* 

Sir Walter Scott in his poem, "Marmion," refers to this badge or em- 
blem, as follows: 

Here is a holy Palmer come 
From Salem first and last from Rome ; 
One that hath kissed the blessed tomb, 
And visited each holy shrine 
In Araby and Palestine! 
# * # * * ♦ # 

In Sinai's wilderness he saw 
The Mount where Israel heard the law, 
'Mid thunder-dint and flashing leveu, 
And shadows, mists, and darkness given. 
He shows St. James's cockle-shell — 
Of fair Montserrat, too, can tell.

THE USE OF SHELLS FOR THE PURPOSES OF MONEY. 

It would be quite difficult to point out any natural production better 
adapted for use as money, or more convenient, when size, shape, and sub- 
stance are considered, than the Money cowry, and no species of shell or 
form of shell money has had so wide-spread, so general and extended 
use as this species. With a few exceptions, other forms of shell money 
have been made from portions of shells of larger species, necessitating 
considerable labor in the process of manipulation, the natural form of 
the shells not being preserved, the form or shape of the money being 
altogether conventional^ 

* Moule's Heraldry of Fish. 

tWhen the division of labor was first introduced, commodities were directly bar- 
tered for each other. Those, for example, who had a surplus of corn and were in 
want of wine endeavored to find out those who were iu the opposite circumstances, 
or who had a surplus of wine and wanted corn, and they exchanged one for the other. 
It is obvious, however, that the power of changing and, consequently, of dividing em-

The following' extract from a paper on Early Hindoo Mathematics 
justifies the inference that the use of the Cyprcea moneta for money has 
a very considerable antiquity, and quite 
likely extends back to a period many cen- 
turies earlier than the date of the trea- 
tise. 

This treatise, the Lilivati of Bhascara 
Acharya, is supposed to have been a com- 
pilation, and there are reasons for believ- 
ing a portion of it to have been written 
about A. D. 628. However this may be, 
it is of the greatest interest, and its date 
is sufficiently remote to give to Hindoo 
mathematics a respectable antiquity. 

"The treatise continues rapidly through the usual rules, but pauses 
at the reduction of fractions to hold up the avaricious man to scorn : 
'The quarter of a sixteenth of the fifth of three quarters of two-thirds 
of a moiety of a dramina was given to a beggar by a person from whom 
he asked alms. Tell me how many cowry shells the miser gave, if thou 
be conversant in arithmetic with the reduction termed subdivision of 
fractions." 7 *

ployrnents, must have been subjected to perpetual interruptions, so long as it was 
restricted to mere barter. A carries produce to market, and B is desirous to purchase 
it ; but the produce belonging to B is not suitable for A. C, again, would like to buy 
B's produce, but B is already fully supplied with the equivalent C has to offer. In 
such cases — and they must be of constant occurrence wherever money is not intro- 
duced — no direct exchange could take place between the parties ; aud it might be very 
difficult to bring it about indirectly. 

The extreme inconvenience attending such situations must early have forced them- 
selves on the attention of every one. Efforts would, in consequence, be made to 
avoid them ; and it would speedily appear that the best, or rather the only way in 
which this could be effected, was to exchange either the whole or a part of one's sur- 
plus produce for some commodity of known value, and in general demand ; and which, 
consequently, few persons would be inclined to refuse to accept as an equivalent for 
whatever they had to dispose of. 

After this commodity had begun to be employed as a means for exchanging other 
commodities, individuals would become willing to purchase a greater quantity of it 
than might be required to pay for the products they were desirous of immediately 
obtaining, knowing that should they at any future period want a further supply of 
either of these or other articles they would be able readily to procure them in ex- 
change for this universally desired commodity. Though at first circulating slowly 
and with difficulty, it would, as the advantages arising from its use were better ap- 
preciated, begin to pass freely from baud to hand. Its value, as compared with other 
things, would thus become to be universally known, and it would at last be used, not 
only as the common medium of exchange, but as a standard by which to measure the 
value of other things. 

Now this commodity, whatever it may be, is money. _ McC ul loch's Com'l Dict'y.

302 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887 



This well-knowD species, an inhabitant of the Indo-Pacitic waters, is 
still " used as money in Hindostan and many parts of Africa. Many 
tons are imported to Great Britain and exported for barter with the 
native tribes of Africa." * 

These shells are used both strung and unstrung. 

Eeeve mentions in the second volume of the Conchologia Systematica 
that "a gentleman residing at Cuttack is said to have paid for the 
erection of his bungalow entirely in these cowries {C. moneta). The 
building cost him about 4,000 rupees sicca (£400 sterling), and as sixty- 
four of these shells are equivalent in value to one pice, and sixty-four 
pice to a rupee sicca, he paid for it with over 10,000,000 of these 
shells." 

Though the number above mentioned is very large, this is an exceed- 
ingly abundant form. We have received in a single box from the East 
Indies not less than ten thousand specimens at one time. " In the year 
1848, sixty tons were imported into Liverpool, and in 1849 nearly three 
hundred tons were brought to the same port." "Their relative currency 
value varies in different localities. In British India about four thousand 
pass for a shilling, and the erection of a church, which cost £4,000, is 
said to have been paid for entirely with cowries. The ordinary grada- 
tion or value on the west coast of Africa is as follows : 

40 cowries = 1 string. 10 heads = 1 bag. 

2-J strings=l d. 2,000 cowries = 1 head. 

100 cowries=l d. 3 heads = 1 dollar. 

50 strings = 1 head of cowries. 20,000 cowries -I bag. 

" In other places ihey are valued at Is. 3d. the 1,000. Sometimes 
60,000 to 100,000 (or from £3 15s. to £7 10s.) are given for a young wife, 
whilst a common or ordinary wife may be had for 20,000 cowries, or 
25s. In Sudan, as much as the people trade, they have no other cur- 
rency than the cowry, of which 2,000 shells, weighing seven pounds, 
are worth only one dollar. Although completely depreciated in the ter- 
ritory of the Upper Nile, cowries form among the Mittoo tribes, between 
5° and 6° north latitude, a favorite ornament. 

"The Dyaks stick small white money-cowry shells in the eye sockets 
of the skulls of their enemies, which they keep. In India these shells 
are much used to ornament the trappings of horses and elephants. 
* * * Cowry shells are also strung like beads or sewed like buttons 
on their dress by Brinjari women as personal ornaments, and are in 
circulation as money in the Hyderabad State, and in other parts of the 
country." Besides the true money cowry {Cyprcea moneta), the ring 
cowry {Cyprcea annulus) passes current in many parts of Africa as a 
medium of exchange. A Hamburg house, probably the late firm of 
Godeffroy & Co., sent annually fourteen vessels to Zanzibar for cargoes

The statistics of late years are not accessible. It is not unlikely that 
the trade interests involved have led to the suppression or non-publica- 
tion of the extent of the transactions. 

According to Pickering this species was formerly used as money in the 
Sandwich Islands. He says : * "An estimable and intelligent Hawaiian 
lady gave me the following particulars respecting former customs: 
* * * Money was certainly known, for with a string of cowries (Gy- 
prcea moneta) it was possible to buy any article wanted. Specimens of 
the same shell that were finer than usual, having a high polish and deep 
yellow color, were extravagantly valued, and could only be worn by 
the highest chiefs, who also exclusively possessed wooden calabashes." 

Pickering further remarks : " On ascending the Nile I met with the 
first instances of mixed descent at Kenneh, the modern capital of the 
Thebaud, about thirty miles below the site of ancient Thebes. Market 
women of the Ethiopian race likewise made their appearance at Kin- 
neb, where a change took place in the weights and measures, and cow- 
ries were seen used as money." The same author observed that " cow- 
ries were seen used as money at Poona, the species being Gyprcea 
annulusP 

Gyprcea moneta, also known as Guinea money, has been used as a 
financial medium in connection with the African slave trade, and doubt- 
less many a poor negro has been kidnapped and sold, and lost his lib- 
erty for a greater or less number of these shells. 

The main sources of supply of this species of shell are the Maldive 
aud Laccadive Islands, two groups in the 
Arabian Sea. 

Gyprcea annulus, or the ringed cowry, so 
called, the back or upper side of the shell 
being ornamented with a bright orange-col- 
ored ring, aside from its use as money, as 
before mentioned, is also used by the Asiatic 
islanders to adorn their dress and to weight 
their fishing nets. Specimens of it were 
found by Dr.Layard in the ruins of Nimroud. t

ACHATINA MONETARIA, ETC. 

The shell of the land-snail, Achatina monetaria, cut into circles, with 
an open center, is the monetary sign employed in commerce and in 
payment of a part of tribute in Benguella.* 

Another ludo-Pacific species, Nerita polita, described by Linnaeus, a 
very abundant form in the general region of the Viti or Fiji Islands and 
the Navigator or Samoan group, and at certain localities in the Aus- 
tralasian seas, sometimes (once in a thousand) exhibits a banded or 
striped variety ; this, it is said, passes as money and is used in trade. 

DIWARA, TAMBU, LIDERAN, AND PELE. 

In the islands of New Britain and New Ireland and those of theDuke 
of York group, situated about 10° south latitude and 150° west longi- 
tude, shell money is used by the natives. The name of this money in 
the Duke of York group and New Ireland is Diwara. In New Britain 
it is called Tambu. There are other kinds of money in the group made 
of shells broken into flakes and ground down to a circular form; this is 
called Lideran. In New Ireland 1 fathom of Lideran will purchase more 
than one fathom of Diwara. Still another kind of money is made at a 
place called Mioko, in theDuke of York group ; the name of this last is 
Tele. Some forms of this native money are exceedingly special and re- 
stricted as a tender, being used only in the purchase of swine. The 
author* does not give the names of the species or genera of shells from 
which the money he refers to is made, but some forms of it, impliedly, 
are made from bivalves and others from gasteropod shells. 

It is noteworthy that some of it is in the disk form, in this respect 
like the hawoclc and tocalli of the California aborigines. 

WAMPUM AND SHELL MONEY OF THE NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS. 

The early settlers of New England found a form of shell money in use 
amongthe aborigines of that region. In the Historical Collections of Mas- 
sachusetts, and from other sources, as recorded by Governor Winthrop 
and Roger Williams, we are informed as to its character and the purposes 
for which it was used. This shell money, to which the Indian nstmeWam- 
pum was given, consisted of beads made from certain species of shells, and 
unlike the cowry money of India and Africa, before described, required a 
considerable degree of manipulation in its manufacture. The cowry 
money, it will be borne in mind, was used in the natural state, except 
when strung, and to prepare it for stringing only a simple perforation 
was necessary. The wampum or shell-bead money of the New England 
Indians involved much labor and no small degree of skill. It consisted 
of two principal colors of beads, of cylindrical form, a quarter of an inch, 
more or less, in length, the diameter or thickness being usually about

half the length. The color of the wampum 
determined its value. The term Wampum, 
Wampon, or Wampom, and Wampampeege 
was apparently applied to these beads when 
strung or otherwise connected, fastened, or 
woven together,* as in Fig. 3 ; also shown 
in Plate I. 

Outside of New England it was otherwise 
known. By the Dutch settlers of New York 
it was called JSeaicanJ Seaward, or Zeewand, 
and RoenolceX in Virginia, and perhaps fur- 
ther south, for shell money was also known 
in the Oarolinas, but whether the roenoke 
of the Virginia Indians was made from the 
same species of shells as the wampum beads 
of the more northern tribes is not definitely 
shown, as the common names given to "shell- 
fish" were then, as now, quite confusing. 

Beverly§ says of Virginia wampum: "Peak 
is of two sorts, or rather of two colors, for 
both are made of one shell, || though or dif- 
feent parts; one is a dark-purple cylinder, 
and the other a white; they are both made 
in size and figure alike, and commonly much 
resembling the English bugles, but not so 
transparent nor so brittle. They are wrought 
as smooth as glass, being one-third of an 
inch long, and about a quarter diameter, 
strung by a hole drilled through the center. 

"The dark color is the dearest,^ and dis- 
tinguished by the name Wampum peak. 
The Englishmen, that are called Indian 
traders, value the wampum peak at eighteen 

* Cylindrical shell beads similar to the "wampam- 
peege of the Atlantic coast Indians were made to 
some extent by the red men of the west coast, as is 
proven by examples in the National Museum from 
ancient graves, vide specimens as follows : Santa Rosa 
Island, California, 23698, 29123 ; San Miguel Island, 
29122 ; San Luis Obispo, 21173 ; Santa Cruz, 18235 ; 
Santa Barbara, 15203. These are a modification of 
the haivoek of the California tribes, and were made 
from the dark-purple shells of the mussel, Mytilus cali- 
fornianus, which abounds on the west coast.

pence per yard, and the white peak at nine pence. They also make 
ruutees of the small shells, and grind them as smooth as peak; these 
are either large, like an oval bead, and drilled the length of the oval, 
or else they are circular and flat, almost an inch over, and drilled edge- 
ways. * * * They also have another sort, which is current among 
them, but of less value; and this is made of the cockle-shell,* broken 
into small bits, with rough edges, drilled through in the same manner 
as beads, and this they call roeuoke, and use it as peak. These sorts of 
money bear the rates set upon them as unalterably and current as the 
value our money are." 

William Byrd,t F. E. S., wrote: "A vertuoso might divert himself here 
very well in picking up Shells of various Hue and Figure, and amongst 
the rest that species of Conque shells which the Indian Peak is made 
of. The extremities of them shells are Blue and the rest White, so 
that Peak of both these colors are drilled out of the same shell, J serv- 
ing the Natives both for Ornament and Money, and are esteemed by 
them far beyond Gold and Silver." 

"The money of the Carolina Indians," says Lawson,§ "is of differ- 
ent sorts, but all made of shells which are found on the coast of Caro- 
lina," etc. * * * "The general and current species of all the Indians 
in Carolina, and I believe * * * as far as the bay of Mexico, is 
that which we call peak || and roenoak; but peak more especially. This 
is that which at New York they call wampum, and have used it as cur- 
rent money among the inhabitants for a great many years," etc. 

SUCKAUHOCK OR BLACK WAMPUM. 

One of the most common bivalve shell-fish or clams of the southern 
coast of New England is the Venus mercenaria^ the "hard-shell clam" 
or " round clam" of the New York market, and in the market-stalls of 
Boston known as the "quahog." The valves or shells of this species 
frequently exhibit an interior purple edge, the rest of the shell being 
of au opaque white. From the darker-colored portion** the Indians 
made their purple or black money or beads, while from the axis of a

"Toward the anterior end of the otherwise white interior of each of the valves of 
this mollusk's shell is a deep purple or brownish black scar, indicating the point of 
the muscular attachment; the fishermen call it the eye. This dark spot was broken 
out of the shell by the Indians, and formed the material of their more valuable 
coins." The above is quite misleading; the term "eye," often applied to the mono-

species of Pyrula,* or conch, and from other shells, as we are led to infer, 
they made their " white wampum." In reference to the first, and its use as 
a substance from which the wampum was made, we have the following: 
''The quahaug ( Venus mercenaria), called by Eoger Williams the poquau 
and the hen, is a round, thick shell-fish, or, to speak more properly, worm. 
It does not bury itself but a little in the sand; is generally found lying 
on it, in deep water, and is gathered by rakes made for the purpose.

water mark. The quahaug is not much inferior in relish to the oyster, 
but is less digestible. It is not eaten raw, but is cooked in various modes 
being roasted in the shell or opened and broiled, fried, or made into 
soups and pies. About half an inch of the inside of the shell is of a 
purple color. This the Indians broke off and converted into beads, 
named by them suckauhoclt, or black money, which was twice the value 
of their wompom, or white money, made of the metauliock or periwinkle

myarian oysters, where the muscular scar is in a general way central, does not apply 
to the dimyarian quahaug with two muscular scars — one anterior, the other posterior. 
In such shells as have a purple interior both of these scars are often more or less 
merged in that color, which is principally seen on the ventral or lower portion of the 
valves. Mr. Ingersoll refers to the periwinkle shells, " Meteauhock" or Pyrula, from 
which the " white wampum" was made, tlms : "It was ouly necessary to take out one 
or two small sections of the central column of the spire and smooth the edges; the 
hollow core made them natural beads." I am somewhat familiar with these shells, 
hut have never observed a specimen with a perforated columella. (See "Wampum 
and its History.")

WHITE WAMPUM, OR WAMPUM-PEAGE. 

In Cadwallader Colden's History of the Five Indian Nations, he says 
that wampum is made of the large whelk-shell Buccinum, and shaped 

like long beads; it is the current money of the 
Indians. Whether the shells of the true Bug- 
cinum (B. undatum, Linn.) or those of Pyrula 
canaliculata% and Pyrula carica were used is 
not satisfactorily explained. Probably all of 
these were used, the long columella of the two 
latter species causing them to be specially de- 
sirable for the purpose of bead making, par- 
ticularly the latter for the white beads. 

These shells are frequently referred to by 
the old colonial writers as "cuuk" or "conch" 
shells; and the names "periwinkle," "winkle,"

" coccle," " oyster," etc., were confusingly applied to the various species 
of shells out of which the wampum beads were made. 

In the inevitable intercourse and early traffic 
between the white settlers and the Indians, the 
wampum or shell money of the latter, in the 
place of the ordinary money of civilization, 
naturally came into use as a medium in barter- 
ing and exchange, or in adjusting the differences 
arising in trade between buyer and seller 5 at 
first only to a limited extent, aiterwards grow- 
ing into such general use that its value was 
fixed by legal enactment. 

Col. T. W. Higginson, of Massachusetts, in 
one of his Atlantic essays, "The Puritan Min- 
ister," says : " In coming to the private affairs 
of the Puritan divines, it is humiliating to find 
that anxieties about salary are of no modern 
origin. The highest compensation I can fiud 
recorded is that of John Higginson, in 3071, 
who had £160 voted him in country produce, 
which he was glad-, however, to exchange for 
£120 in solid cash. 'Solid cash' included beaver-skins, black and white 
wampum, beads, and musket balls, value one farthing." 

The value of wampum, as heretofore given on the authority of Gov- 
ernor Winthrop, was for that known as hens-po-qua-hock, three to a 
penny ; and five shillings as the value of a fathom. 

" The fathom was a name for a count, an enumeration of beads. * * * 
Sixty pence, the fathom of beads, was more or less, according to the 
number of beads allowed by the statute to be equivalent to a penny. 
If the number was six, then the fathom was 360; but if it was four, as 
under the Massachusetts standard of 16-10, then the fathom numbered 
240 beads. We are not to forget that this was a fluctuating standard of 
value. The tributes of the Indian tribes to the colonists were usually 
payable in fathoms. Contracts for the sale of land were made by the 
Indians for considerations of all kinds — wampum, coats, guns, bullets, 
and wares of all sorts. The island of Conanicut, in Narragansett Bay, 
was sold to Coddington and his associates in 1657 for ' one hundred 
pounds in wampum-peage.' 

" The unit of the fathom of wampum brought it into correlation with 
the other currencies used in the colonies. The beads were at first worth 
more than five shillings a fathom, the price at which they passed current 
when Williams wrote in 1643. A few years before the fathom was worth 
nine or ten shillings. But beaver fell in England, and that reduced the 
price of wampum in the colonies. The wampum was virtually redeem- 
able in beaver, as these changes of value show. As long as the natives 



310 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

were active and furs were plenty there appears to have been no diffi- 
culty in passing any quantity of wampum in common with other cur- 
rencies. The Bay annulled its statutes making the beads a legal teuder 
in 1661. Bhode Island and Connecticut followed soon after. * * * 

" In 1627 De Rasieres, with a Dutch trading vessel, came into Ply- 
mouth from New Amsterdam. In her cargo was a lot of wampum 
valued at £50, for the Dutch had learned its uses as a currency in their 
traffic with the natives. They sent this first installment to the trading 
post on the river Kennebec, where it was kept in hand for two years. 
Meanwhile the interior Indians heard of it, and the assured supply 
brought a demand. For some years after the Plymouth men could 
hardly furnish wampum enough, etc. * * * In 1637 the trade in 
maize with the Indians up the Connecticut Eiver was so importart to 
the colonies below that they recorded an ordinance with penalties re- 
stricting it. * * * In 1638 the same authority fixed the price of 
corn * * * at 5s. Qd. per bushel in money, at 6s. per bushel in 
wampum at three a penny, or if in beaver according to the order at 9s. 
per pound. * * * This particular instauce shows that wampum 
had then made itself nearly equal in purchasing power to money of any 
kind. The Bay authorities had fixed the rate in 1637 at six beads for 
a penny for any sum under 12d. In the early statutes only one rate 
is mentioned. Probably it was understood that the black was included 
at double the rate fixed for the white. In many of the later laws the 
two colors are mentioned in that proportion. The usual difficulty caused 
by a standard of value fluctuating between different markets was ex- 
perienced now. Connecticut received wampum for taxes, in 1637, at 
four a penny. They tried to bring it to the Massachusetts standard, 
for the ordinance of 1640 says: 'The late order concerning Warnpu at 
sixe a penny shall be disolued, and the former of fower a penny and two 
pence to be paid in the shilling shall be established. 1 " 

" In the same year Massachusetts came to the Connecticut standard, 
the white to pass at four and the 'bleuse' at two a penny, not above 
12d. at a time, except at the will of the receiver. In 1641 they submitted 
to the inevitable and made the shell beads a legal tender at six a penny 
in sums of £10." 

Mr. Weeden, whose admirable memoir* has been freely quoted herein, 
and who it is quite evident from numerous foot-notes has carefully 
gleaned the records of the colonial period in this connection, goes 
on to say : " Evidently the proud merchants and capitalists of the Bay 
had adopted the Indian money only when the absolute necessity of 
their community demanded the sanction of law. The precious maize 
which many writers have designated as an essential factor in the pros- 
perity of the early colonists had yielded the first place, and shell money 
became the principal medium of intercourse with the natives. Stringent 
necessity forced men like Winthrop and Bndicott to receive these bar

baric trinkets on a par with solid coin of the old English realm. * * * 
The coin marks, the £ s. d. of their money, they adopted from the Lom- 
bard merchants who settled in Loudon, and taught them the larger 
commerce. They brought these mystic symbols of civilization across 
the seas and stamped, them on the shell treasures of Canonicus and 
Sassacus." 

There was no restriction on the manufacture of wampum. Anybody 
could make it, and it was made by the whites as well as the Indians. 
" Seeing that profit and wealth lay in the possession of wampum the 
burghers [of New Amsterdam] as the easiest way of getting rich began 
to make it. . With their tools of steel this could be done very rapidly, 
but with the loss of the painstaking care with which the Indians wrought 
came a loss of value and the wampum soon began to depreciate. To 
widen their market it was carried to New England." * 

The inferior quality of much of the wampum in circulation about this 
time led to the legislation of 1648 and 1649, by Massachusetts and Con- 
necticut, in the matter of " bad, false, and unfinished peage." 

" In 1644 the Indian trade was at its height in New England. In 1661 
and 1662 all the New England colonies ceased to receive wampum as a 
lawful currency, * * * but its use continued long after. * * * 
New York continued the beads in circulation longer than the regular 
use prevailed in New England." 

The "Acts of Virginia,! 1655," show legislation as follows: "Be it 
enacted by this Grand Assembly that peeces of Eight that are good 
and of silver shall pass for five shillings sterling, and Roan only and 
Wompom peeke to keep their wonted value." 

In 1693 they were recognized in the definite rates of the Brooklyn 
ferry. They continued to be circulated in the remoter districts of New 
England through the century, and even into the beginning of the 
eighteenth.^ 

It was practically in use as change and was current with silver in 
Connecticut in 1704. 

The knowledge and use of wampum or wampum-peage extended far 
into the interior of the country, or perhaps more properly wampum in 
some form was not uncommon among the aborigines of what was then 
the " far West." 

The territory occupied by the Five Indian Nations being between 
that of the coast tribes and that of the remoter western Indians, indi- 
cates a path of distribution, and justifies the supposition that the 
wampum of the more distant was the same as that of the sea-board 
tribes. 

■Whether the interior tribes of the continent at that time, made use 
of it as money or as jewelry for personal adornment is a matter of con- 
jecture. It is however highly probable that the wampum beads used

by them were received indirectly from the maritime or coast tribes in 
exchange for such articles as were peculiar to their interior position. 

Without multiplying authorities, it may be safely asserted that this 
shell money was manufactured along the Atlantic coast from Maine to 
Florida, and on the Gulf coast certainly as far south as Central America. 
The use of this circulating medium was undo ubtedly very general among 
the agricultural tribes east of the Mississippi River.* The ancient 
sepulchral tumuli of Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, and other Southern 
States, as well as those located in the valley of the Ohio and in valleys 
tributary both to it and to the Mississippi from the east, when opened, 
fully corroborate the historical narrative, and afford physical proof that 
this product of the skill and the patience of the eoast tribes, sought 
and obtained through trade relations, was thus, and by means of subse- 
quent migrations, widely disseminated among the red men dwelling far 
in the interior. 

The proximity of the coast tribes to the sources whence the material 
was procured from which the wampum-peage was made would at once 
give to the latter superior commercial advantages, and it is quite likely 
that they were directly or indirectly liberal purchasers from the interior 
communities, who considered them, if not as merchants or bankers, at 
least as particularly fortunate and wealthy on account of the money 
they handled, just as the inhabitants of interior aud agricultural dis- 
tricts among civilized people regard the traders and inhabitants of lit- 
toral cities and settlements. 

There is some reason for believing that among the Five Nations wam- 
pum of home manufacture was made out of a species of fresh- water 
snail (shell) that lives in the streams and smaller lakes of the region 
occupied by said tribes. 

From the foregoing some idea may be formed of the importance in 
the past of 

SHELL MONEY AS A FACTOR IN AMERICAN CIVILIZATION. 

Aside from the shell beads, or strings of shell beads, that were used 
as money, wampum was used for personal adornment,t and belts were 
made by embroidering wampum upon " strips of deer-skin," forming a 
girdle or scarf, and these belts and scarfs were not simply an evidence 
of wealth but a symbol of authority and power.

A STUDY OF PRIMITIVE MONEY. 313 

In Major Rogers's Account of North America (London, 1765), in allud- 
ing to the wampum of the Indians, he says: "When they solicit the 
alliance, offensive or defensive, of a whole nation, they send an embassy 
with a large belt Of wampum and a bloody hatchet, inviting them to 
come and drink the blood of their enemies. The wampum made use of 
on these and other occasions, before their acquaintance with the Euro- 
peans, was nothing but small shells, which they picked up by the sea- 
coast and on the banks of the lakes ; and now it is nothing but a kind 
of cylindrical beads, made of shells, white and black, which are es- 
teemed among them as silver and gold are among us. They have the 
art of stringing, twisting, and interweaving them into their belts, collars, 
blankets, moccasins, etc., in ten thousand different sizes, forms, and 
figures, so as to be ornaments for every part of dress, and expressive 
to them of all their important transactions. 

"They dye the wampum of various colors and shades, and mix and 
dispose them with great ingenuity and order, so as to be significant 
among themselves of almost everything they please; so that by these 
their words are kept and their thoughts communicated to one another, 
as ours by writing. The belts that pass from one nation to another in 
all treaties, declarations, and important transactions, are very carefully 
preserved in the cabins of their chiefs, and serve not only as a kind of 
record or history, but as a public treasure. 

"According to the Indian conception these belts could tell, by means 
of an interpreter, the exact rule, provision, or transaction talked into 
them at the time, and of which they were the exclusive record. A strand 
of wampum consisting of purple and white shell beads, or a belt woven 
with figures formed by beads of different colors, operated on the prin- 
ciple of associating a particular fact with a particular string or figure; 
thus giving a serial arrangement to the facts as well as fidelity to the 
memory. These strands and belts were the only visible records of the 
Iroquois; but they required those trained interpreters who could draw 
from their strings and figures [the acts and intentions] locked up in 
their remembrance."* 

After the defeat of the great chief Philip of the "Wampanoags, Ana- 
wan, the most trusted warrior, counselor, and friend of Philip, went 
out quietly, brought the three or four wampum scarfs — splendid in his 
eyes — and gave them to his conqueror. The trinkets were not only 
valuable in themselves, they also symbolized and embodied a complete 
submission to the more mighty men whose prowess had prevailed over 
the Indians. The largest scarf, 9 inches wide, pictured with birds and 
beasts and flowers, when laid over the shoulders of the sturdy Rhode 
Islander, swept his ankles. Another belt designed for the head carried 
two flags attached to it. Governor Winslow in his letter to the King, 
accompanying the spoils of Philip, speaks of them as "being his 
Crowne, his Gorge and two Belts of their own making of their goulde

and silver." Gold it was not, coin it was not; but the governor cor- 
rectly described it as u their gold." This quality gave it the attributes 
of a currency in the growing intercourse with the colonists. It was this 
quality, this costliness, which impressed the barbaric imagiuation and 
made wampum a high symbol in every ceremony, political or religious. 

Whenever the Indians made an important statement in their frequent 
negotiations, they presented a belt to prove it, to give force to their 
words. ''The hatchet fixed in the head," one of the most forcible of 
their many figures, expressing a sense of wrong, a legitimate grievance — 
this hatchet must be removed by something more powerful than words. 
A belt was presented to discharge the grievance, and not by mere pur- 
chase. The value of the beads could hardly have been of consequence 
to a haughty confederacy like the Iroquois or Five Nations. It marked 
the gravity of the apology. It gave to the words the weight of hard 
physical facts, and made the expression an emblem of "great force and 
significance.* 

It is not the object of this paper to present or consider the use of 
shells or wampuin beads for other purposes than money or a medium in 
trade. As Mr. Holmest remarks in his elaborate memoir, "the litera- 
ture of wampum would fill a volume." 

So, from a passing glance at the symbolic uses of wampum and the 
important mnemonic use of these insignificant shell beads to the ancient 
Americans of the Atlantic sea-board, we will cross the continent and 
consider 

THE SHELL MONEY OF THE CALIFORNIA ABORIGINES. 

The use of shells for the purposes of money by the Indians of the 
northwest coast of North America prevailed no doubt for a long time 
before any members of the European races had any knowledge of the 
aborigines of this portion of the continent. At the time of the earliest 
contact of white men with the red men of the Pacific slope, shell money 
was found to be in use, and the same forms have been obtained from 
the graves and ancient burial places of the aborigines of California, etc. 

Our knowledge of the Indians of the west coast is, unfortunately, 
exceedingly limited and indefinite. Limited in time, as we find when 
we seek to trace back, prior to the date of the transfer of the territory 
of what are termed the Pacific States to the United States, and indefi- 
nite as to the minor features of the west coast Indians, in matters 
which pertain or relate to their ordinary habits, customs, etc. 

Powers, referring to shell money, says : " Immense quantities of it 
were formerly in circulation among the California Indians, and the 
manufacture of it was Targe and constant to replace the continual 
wastage * * * caused by the sacrifice of so much upon the death 
of wealthy men, and by the propitiatory sacrifices performed by many

tribes, especially those of the Coast Kange. From my own observa- 
tions, which have not been limited, and from the statements of pioneers 
and the Indians themselves, I hesitate little to express the belief that 
every Indian in the State, in early days, possessed an average of at 
least $100 worth of shell money. This would represent the value of 
about two women (though the Nishinam never actually bought their 
wives), or two grizzly-bear skins, or twenty-five cinnamon bear skins- 
or about three average ponies. This may be considered a fair state, 
ment of the diffusion of wealth among them in their primitive condi- 
tion." 

The late George Gibbs,* in writing (prior to 1873) of the Indians of 
the northwest coast, says: "Measures of length were probably all re- 
ferred to parts of the body, the principal being the extent of the out- 
stretched arms, which was used in valuing their money, the haikwa 
or wampum of the Pacific." 

HAIK-WA, HI-A-QUA, OR TUSK-SHELL MONEY. 

Of these shells, a species of Dentalium, Mr. Lord writes :t 
" The money-shells are procured upon the north end of Vancouver 
Island ; also in the bays and inlets along the mainland coast north of

latitude of 49 degrees to Sitka, and is common likewise round Queen 
Charlotte's Island. The genus has an enormous geographical range, 
and it is, perhaps, strange that the shells from Northwest America, 
from California, and those obtained on our own coast, when placed side 
by side, scarcely present any material specific difference."! 

The Tusk-shells are collected in the following manner: "An Indian 
wlien shell-fishing arms himself with a long spear, the haft of which is 
light deal ; to the end of it is fastened a strip of wood placed trans- 
versely, but driven full of teeth made of bone. The whole affair resem- 
bles a long comb affixed to the end of a stick with the teeth very wide 
apart. A squaw sits in the stern of the canoe, and paddles it slowly 
along, whilst the Indian with the spear stands in the bow. He stabs 
this comb-like affair into the sand at the bottom of the water, and after 
giving two or three prods draws it up to look at it. If he has been

successful perhaps four or five money-shells have been impaled on the 
teeth of the spear. It is a very ingenious mode of procuring them, for 
it would be quite impracticable either to dredge or net them out, and 
they are never, as far as I know, found between tide- 
marks." 

Gibbs also describes the method of obtaining them 
as follows: "This shell is a species of Dentalium, 
which was procured on the northern coast by letting 
down long poles to which was attached a piece of 
wood filled with spikes or teeth, between which the 
shell became fixed. The squaws string them very 
neatly. A small bit of dried sinew, taken from * * * 
the caribou is passed through the shell lengthwise, 
there being a hole at each end. The string is gen- 
erally ornamented with fragments of the * * * 
Haliotis shell and tufts of dry wool taken from the 
mountain goat (Capra americana)." 

KOP-KOPS; SHORT TUSK-SHELLS. 

The short, broken, and inferior shells are strung 
together in the same manner, but in various lengths, 
and represent shillings or pence, as the string is either 
long or short or the shells defective. All inferior 
strings, irrespective of either length or quality, are 
called kop-kops. The hi-qua represents the sovereign, 
the highest standard of currency, and, as a rule, would 
purchase one male or two female slaves. The value 
of the slave, estimating it by the sum paid in blankets 
for a slave at the present day, would be about £50 
sterling. Forty kop-kops equal a hi-qua in value, but 
various small bargains are made and small debts paid 
with kop-kops, only just as we pay away shillings or 
lesser coin. 

Gibbs also says: " Its price depended entirely upon 
its length ; forty to the fathom being the standard of 
value. When the shells were so short that it required 
more to make up the required length, they were of 
inferior account, but rose proportionately with in- 
creased size. A fathom of forty was formerly worth 
a slave, and even now will bring five dollars in money. 

"Single shells were shown me on the Tsihalis for 
which the owner refused one dollar apiece. . This 
money is, however, becoming scarce, and is far less 
used than formerly, at least by the tribes who have 
much intercourse with the whites. It was the uni- 
versal currency through an extensive district. On the Klamath River

it is valued even more highly than on the Sound and the Columbia, 
and those aboriginal peddlers, the Klikitat, frequently carry it to 
southern Oregon for sale. * * * I have never met with mnemoni- 
cal signs or pictorial help to memory." 

Mr. Lord also says that the use of these shells (Dentalium) as money 
had at the time he wrote to a great extent died out. This was due to 
the introduction of blankets by the Hudson Bay Company. "A slave, 
a canoe, or a squaw is worth in these days so many blankets ; formerly 
it was so many strings of Dentalia."* 

Further touching the value of the tusk shell money the same writer 
remarks : " The value depends upon its length. Those representing the 
greater value are called, when strung together end to end, a hi-qua, 
but the standard by which Dentalium is calculated to be fit for a hi-qua 
is that twenty-five shells placed end to end must make a fathom, or G 
feet in length." 

In 1810 1 these were the circulating medium of the country, and twenty 
[? shells] of them would buy agood beaver-skin. 

Pickeringf says "the Chinooks have 'wampum' of the usual descrip- 
tion, but strings and bands of Dentalium shells of somewhat similai 
model seem principally to subserve the purposes of currency." 

" In early days, ere the red and white men knew each other, the 
Bentalium was the ouly currency in use. It is quite clear, and also a 
very curious fact, that the hiqua and Jcop-lcop were known and used by 
the Indians of the interior at some distant period, although no trace of 
their use or knowledge of the shell exists among them at present; for 
in digging out some flint implements, stone beads, and other things I 
need not here enumerate, from the drift, I found numbers of dentaliums 
and round buttons made of the Haliotis nacre. The distance from the 
nearest sea-board was about 1,000 miles, and the language spoken by 
these inland Indians quite incomprehensible to the Indians on the 
coast." § 

Among the Tali kali or Ta cullies, regarded by Gibbs as belonging to 
the Tinnehs, inhabiting a region extending from the Cascade Eange in 
British Columbia eastward to the Rocky Mountains, their avarice it was 
said " lies in the direction of hiaqua shells, || which they obtain indi- 
rectly from the sea-coast or of the maritime tribes through intervening 
tribes." 

Whymper,^ describing an Indian muster of various tribes at or near 
Fort Yukon, Alaska, in 1867, said : " Their clothing was much befringed 
with beads, and many of them wore through the nose (as did most of 
the other Indian men present) an ornament composed of the hyaqua

shell (Dentalium entalis or Entails vulgaris). Both of the fur companies 
on the river trade with them, and at very high prices." He further 
remarks that his spelling "hya-qua" conveys a closer approximation 
to the usual pronunciation of the word then Mr. Lord's " hi-qua." 

The use of these shells for nasal ornamentation,* as observed by 
Mr. Whymper, at Fort Yukon, is practiced by the California!! In- 
dians. While at Crescent City in 1861 we saw a medicine-man be- 
longing to one of the neighboring tribes thus curiously decorated. He 
had perforated the partition which separates the nostrils, and into the 
hole had inserted from each side, point passed by point, two of these 
shells. 

This unique ornamentation was further improved by the sticking of 
the feathers of some species of wild fowl into the larger end of each of 
the hollow shells. 

Whymper gives the scientific name of the Tusk-shell as Dentalium en- 
tails or Entails vulgaris. Now, this species of Tusk-shell is a North At- 
lantic form ; the Pacific coast species is Dentalium IndlanorumA 

The Atlantic form, which is abundantly obtained in Europe, has been 
largely imported for the Indian trade ; it is highly x>robable that a great 
part of the Tusk-shells that have been in circulation of late years do not 
belong to the indigenous species, but have been worked off upon the 
Indians by the traders. 

Among the California tribes the Tusk-shells were called Alii co cheek, 
or dllico-chlck,\ the latter being the orthography of Mr. Powers. The 
same writer observed the use of this species of money-shell among the 
Cahrocs or Karoks, who arrange it on strings, the shortest being worth 
with them 25 cents, the longest $2. * * * The unit of currency is a 
string the length of a man's arm, with a certain number of the longer 
shells below the elbow, and a certain number of the shorter ones above. 
This shell money is called dlllcochlck, not only on the Klamath, but 
from Crescent City to Eel Biver, though the tribes using it speak dif- 
ferent languages. 

When the Americans first arrived in the country an Indian would 
give from $40 to $50 in. gold for a string of it ; but now it is principally 
the old Indians who value it at all . § 

" Hupa dlli-co chick is rated a little differently from the Karok. The 
standard of measurement is a string of five shells. Nearly every man 
has ten lines tattooed across the inside of his left arm, about half way 
between the wrist and elbow, and in measuring shell money he takes 
the string in his right hand, draws one end over his left thumb nail and 
if the other end reaches to the uppermost of the tattoo-lines the five 
shells are worth $25 in gold, or $5 a shell. Of course it is only one in

ten thousand that is long enough to reach this high value. The longest 
ones usually seen are worth about $2, that is, $10 the string." 

Powers says of the Indians of Del Norte County, that they are more 
avaricious than others in California. "Money makes the chief among 
them, and he is entitled to that honor who possesses the most alU-ho- 
c7iicfc." 

After describing the puberty dance (Kin'-alkh-ta) of the Hupas, he 
says : "She is now ready for marriage, and she will bring in the market 
from three to ten strings (about half the valuation of a man), that is, 
from $15 to $50." 

I have heretofore referred to the Pectens or scallop shells, and their 
place in history and song. So also with the Dentalia or money-shells 
of the Indians, which it will be seen have a place in their simple rhythm 
and music. 

Among the Moadocs, or Modoks " when a maiden arrives at woman- 
hood her father makes a kind of party in her honor. Her young com- 
panions assemble, and together they dance and sing wild, dithyrambic 
roundelays, improvised songs of the woods and the waters : 

"'Jumping echoes of the rock; 

Squirrels turning somersaults; 

Green leaves, dancing in the air; 

Fishes white as money-shells 

Running in the water, green and deep and still. 

Hi-ho, hi-ho, hi-hay! 

Hi-ho, hi-ho, hi-hay!' 

" This is the substance of one of the songs, as translated for me."* 

In describing marriage among the Yuroks or Eurocs, he says : "When 
a young Indian becomes enamored of a maiden and can not wait to 
collect the amount of shells demanded by her father, he is sometimes 
allowed to payhalf the amount and become what is termed 'half married.' 
Instead of bringing her to his cabin and making her his slave, he goes to 
live in her cabin and becomes her slave." Again he says: " Since the 
advent of the Americans the honorable estate of matrimony has fallen 
sadly into desuetude among the young braves, because they seldom 
have shell money nowadays, and the old Indians prefer that in exchange 
for their daughters. * * * The old generation dislike the white 
man's money, but hoard up shell money like true misers," etc. 

The Patawat have reduced the science and practice of law down to a 
tolerably accurate mechanism in one matter at least — that of mulctuary 
punishment. The average fine imposed for the murder of a man is ten 
strings of dl-li-co- chile, each string consisting of ten pieces, and for that 
of a squaw five strings of equal length. As the pieces of shell money 
generally average, and as it was first valued in American coin, these 
fines amount to about $100 and $50, respectively. 

Among the Patwats " a Avife is always acquired by purchase, and her

market value is regulated on a sliding scale, on which the prices range 
all the way from two up to fifteen strings." Among the Hupas or 
Hoopas, Powers* says: "Murder is generally compounded for by the 
payment of shell money." 

Besides the allico-cheeJc or Tusk-shell money; Dentalia, which so far 
as general use as money is considered, had the widest circulation, we 
will now briefly glance at certain other forms that were used to a. greater 
or less extent for the same purpose. 

The Tusk-shell money, al-U-Jcochik, it seems, was principally used by 
the coast tribes from Mendocino, California, northward to Alaska, and 
by such other tribes to the eastward of the coast tribes whose territory 
joined on or was proximate to that of the coast tribes; and that it was 
known and highly prized still farther to the eastward, we have the 
following testimony : 

" The Hidatsa,t Minnataree, or Gros Ventre Indians, are one of the 
three tribes which at present [1854-62]) inhabit the permanent village 
at Fort Berthold, Dakota Territory, and hunt on the waters of the Up- 
per Missouri and Yellowstone Eivers, in northwestern Dakota and 
eastern Montana." | 

" It appears probable that they once carried on a trade indirectly 
with the tribes of the Pacific coast, for they had Dentalium shells simi- 
lar to those obtained on the Pacific, and they prized them so highly 
that the white traders found it advisable to obtain them for the trade. 
As late as 1866, ten of these shells, of inferior size, costing the traders 
only a cent apiece, would buy a superior buffalo robe, and formerly 
only two or three of the same quality were paid for a robe. Modern 
traders, with whom the writer has conversed, obtain their shells from 
the Eastern importers, and know nothing of the original source of sup- 
ply. They suppose them to come from the Atlantic coast or the Great 
Lakes, and call them ' Iroquois shells,' which is probably their corrup- 
tion of the Chinook Hyalcwa, but it is possible the reverse is the case." 

They also used, and still use as ornaments, fragments of the Abalone 
shells (one or more species of Haliotis) of the Pacific. These are now 
supplied to the trade under the name of California shells. Ten years 
ago one of these shells, unpolished, sold for a good robe. There is lit- 
tle doubt that they used Abalone, Dentalium, and other sea-shells before 
the traders brought them. Old traders and. Indians say so. Even as 
late as 1833 it would seem that they had not yet become a regular part 
of a trader's outfit; for Maximiliau§ says of the Mandans : "They do 
not disfigure the bodies; only they make some apertures in the outer 
rim of the ear, in which they have strings of beads, brass or iron rings 
of different sizes, or shells, the last of which they obtain from other

Indian tribes. If they are questioned respecting these shells, they an-

It had but a limited use among the west-coast Indians, if we may 
judge by the rarity of its occurrence in old graves. Of the small num- 
ber of specimens in the National Museum named in the foot-note* 
nearly all belong to a different species of Dentalium, namely, D. hex- 
agonum, and it is not certain that such examples as do not belong to 
this species should be regarded as the same as the northern form. D.

Here it is made from the heavy shells of a bivalve, a ponderous clam 
when adult, of very compact texture, peculiar to the southern coast of 
California ; abundant at Morro or Estero Bay and other places south- 
ward to San Diego. This is cut into circular pieces of the diameter as 
shown in the annexed figures, or even smaller, the thickness of the 
pieces varying with the thickness of the shells, or of that portion of the 
valve from which the disks are made. The larger pieces* (Figs. 11 and 
12) of the value of twenty-five cents are cut from the thicker part of the 
valves of large or adult clams of said species, and the smaller (Figs. 13 
and 14) of the value of four cents each frota the thinner portions. This

that it looks like a Catholic rosary, and their name for it is tocallV 

In a photograph of a young woman of the Bear River Indians, named 
Yalputteh, sent to me by Mr. Powers, her person is adorned with a 
necklace of hawock, which, it is stated, is ten yards long, requiring to be 
wound several times about her neck. It consists of about 1,160 pieces, 
valued at $232. ".Sometimes disks of hawock are made two inches in 
diameter and half an inch thick, which are rated at one dollar apiece, 
but such large pieces are seldom seen." These disk beads or Hawock 
" are strung on strings made of the inner bark of wild cotton or milk- 
weed (Asclepias) ; and either all the pieces on a string or all in one sec- 
tion of it are of the same size." 

In connection with the use of money in traffic among the interior In- 
dians, it appears that " all the dwellers on the plains, and as far up on 
the mountain as the cedar line, bought all their bows and most of their 
arrows from the upper mountaineers. An Indian is about ten days 
making a bow, and it costs $3, $4, or $5, according to the workmanship ; 
an arrow 12^ cents. Three kinds of money were employed in this traffic. 
White shell beads, or rather buttons, pierced in the center and strung- 
together were rated at $5 per yard (hawock)', periwinkles, at, $1 a 
yard ; fancy marine shells, at various prices, from $3 to $10 or $15, ac- 
cording to their beauty. 



324 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

"Among the Yocuts, whose dominion covers the Kern and Tulare 
basins and the middle San Joaquin, etc., their money consists of the 
usual shell buttons (hawock), and a string of them reaching from the 
point of the middle finger to the elbow is valued at twenty-five cents." 

The use of hawok was quite general no doubt throughout central and 
southern California, and to some extent much farther to the east. One 
example* in the National Museum is from New Mexico. Hawok was 
often made of much smaller size than the figures illustrate; as small as 
the smaller beads or peage of the Atlantic coast and equally well fin- 
ished, sometimes even neatly ornamented by serrating the edges,t 
which must have been a difficult and painstaking work in beads so small. 
Again we find cylindrical beads sometimes five inches in length, either 
curved or straight, made from the heavy clam Tivela ; these we may re- 
gard, however, rather as ornaments than money ; they have been found 
in the graves on most of the islands in the Santa Barbara Channel, as 
well as infrequently in similar situations on the mainland. 

KOL-KOL OR OLIVELLA SHELL MONEY. 

The periwinkles mentioned by Mr. Powers are Olivella shells of the 
species known as 0. biplicata, a form that is exceedingly abundant in 
numerous places along the Californian coast. They were prepared by 
simply rubbing or grinding off the apex, and were called col-col or Jcol- 
Jcol. This form was strung in a double string, the shells lying mouth to

mouth, and it is stated were " slightly esteemed." This was no doubt 
owing to the abundance of this species. They were, however, exten- 
sively used for personal decoration, for they have been found in ancient 
graves at various places in southern, central, and northern California 
on the mainland, and also the islands in the Santa Barbara Chaunel.i

X " We found 0. biplicata in great numbers in the graves on San Miguel Island, many 
of which had been bored, seemingly for the purpose of stringing. I observed also 
many of them with the apex ground off, so that a string might be readily passed 
throughlengthwise."— (W. G. W. Harford, 1876.) "The shell of Olivella biplicata Sby., 
is also (or was) used as money, the writer having found them occasionally in the 
'mounds' of Contra Costa and Alameda Counties mixed with small flat disks described 
above."— (Dr. L. G. Yates.)

vary considerably in size, often measuring an inch or more in length. 
The smaller ones were apparently preferred for stringing whole, while 
the larger ones were required for making the disks. 

This way of treating the Olivella Shells seems to have been formerly 
rather popular, if we may judge by the specimens in the National Mu- 
seum* from Indian graves. In the majority of instances these disks 
were rather rudely finished, with rough and uneven edges, but some- 
times, as shown in a specimen from Santa Eosa Island,f the disks are 
made quite small and very neatly finished. 

Mr. Barber! says: "Through eastern Utah and south into Arizona 
many Olivas [Olivellas] were found scattered through the debris of 
crumbling walls and broken pottery. The perforation has been effected 
by grinding down the apex." * * * He describes other beads that 
" were of two sizes, and usually white. The smaller variety was flat on 
both sides, or slightly convex on one side and concave on the other, 
* * * as thin as a wafer, and the circumference of an ordinary pea. 
In the center a neatly bored hole enabled the owner to string them to- 
gether in the form of a necklace. The larger variety was about the 
circumference of an average buckshot." 

Capt. John Moss, of Parrott City, Colorado, says that these beads are 
valued highly by the present Navajo Indians to the south, a small 
string, when such can be found, bringing in exchange a good horse. 
The Navajoes are constantly grubbing about the old buildings and 
adjacent graves in search of these trinkets. This accounts in some 
measure for their great scarcity among the ruins to-day. They were 
undoubtedly obtained by the ancients from other tribes, who brought 
them, or at least the shells from which they were fashioned, from the 
Pacific coast. We know that these ruins extend as far west as the 
junction of the San Juan and Colorado Eivers, so that communication

between the tribe in question and others situated along the Pacific 
Ocean or Gulf of California was rendered easy. Don Jose Cortez, 
writing of the tribes near the Colorado in 1799, speaks of " the white 
beads they get on the shores of the Gulf of California." 

The more general form of kol-kol, combined or arranged in various 
ways, single and double strings, bracelets, etc., from as far east as 
southern Utah,* may be seen in the National Museum. 

The finest example extant is probably that obtained by Lieutenant 
Eayt from the Hupa or Hoopah Indians of northern California. It is 
made of quite small Olivellas of the two species, 0. biplicata and 0. 
intorta, carefully selected specimens, and neatly strung. If extended 
in a single length it would measure nearly thirty feet, and includes 
probably over a thousand shells. 

Occasionally large specimens of 0. biplicata were cut, or more likely 
ground down, lengthwise^ and then perforated, so as to admit of attach- 
ment or stringing; but this is not a common form, and was most likely 
for ornament only. 

Powers, writing about hawoch, says : " This may be called their silver, 
and is the great medium of all transactions, while the money answering 
to gold is made from various species of the ear shell" (Haliotis) and is 
called " Uhllo or iil-loP 

UHL-LO, TJL-LO, OR ABALONE MONET. 

These shells are without doubt the "fancy marine shells" previously 
mentioned, which were valued at " $3 to $10, or $15, according to their 
beauty," and belong to one or the other of the species known to conchol- 
ogists as Haliotis rufescens, H. splendens, and H. cracherodii, all indige- 
nous forms, popularly kuown as abalones;§ the aulones of the Spanish. 

It is not a matter of wonder* that these beautiful shells excited the 
admiration of the savage. Many tons of them have within the last 
twenty years been collected and shipped to Europe and China as well 
as to the Eastern United States, where they are manipulated into va- 
rious forms for useful and decorative purposes. The California Indians, 
with their primitive tools of obsidian, cut them up " into oblong strips 
from 1 to 2 inches in length, according to the curvature of the shell, 
and about a third as broad as they are long. * * * Holes are drilled 
near one end and they are thereby fastened to a string, * * * hang- 
ing edge to edge. Ten pieces generally constitute a string, and the 
larger pieces rate at $1 apiece, $10 a string ; the smaller in proportion,

§ Holmes says that " H. kamtchatkana, which furnishes a dark-green nacre, is much 
used farther north." This is probably a mistake, and H. splendens the species in- 
tended, as the former is the least brilliant and has the thinnest shell of any of the 
west American species.

or less, if they are not pretty. Being susceptible of a high polish, this 
money forms a beautiful ornament, and is worn for necklaces on gala 
days. But as money it is rather too large and cumbersome, and the 
Indians generally seek to exchange it for the less brilliant but more 
useful ha-ivock. The iil-lo may be considered rather as jewelry."

The uhl-Jo pieces are of a uniform size on the same string; they do

The Indians are very ingenious and economical in working up the 
aulones. Wherever there is a broad, flat space they take out a dollar 
piece; where the curve is sharper, smaller ones. They especially value 
the outer edge (columella) of the whorl or lip, where the color is brilliant, 
and these they are obliged to cut into twenty -five-cent pieces. You 
will see that the ilhl-lo is cut into pieces of different sizes, and even pieces

of the same size vary in value, according to their brilliancy. * * * 
All the money that I have seen was strung on grocery twine, but they 
often use sinew of various kinds; also the bark of a milkweed that 
grows about here.* 





"The aulone or uhl-lo necklace has three or four strings of very small 
glass beads above the shells, forming a band about a quarter of an inch 
wide, which encircles the neck. * * * A common deep conical bas- 
ket, of about a bushel and a half capacity, such as the squaws use for 
carrying their household effects, is worth one and one-half or two strings 
of uhl-lo, that is, fifteen or twenty dollars." 

The shells of the various species of Haliotis were as highly prized by 
the red men of the west coast in the r>ast as in later times, and were 
worked by them into a great variety of forms. These forms, as well as 
entire shells, have been found in the older burial places, mounds, and

Disks of different sizes, perforated or otherwise, some with plain 
edges,* others with the edges crenulatedt or regularly notched; also 
other shapes, crescentic, elliptic, lanceolate, falciform, leaf-shaped, and 
a number of other forms occur; but, with the exception of the discoidal 
pieces, which may have been sometimes used as money, it is probable 
that these were jewelry, and were used as pendants, buttons, spangles, 
etc. 

One instance of the purchasing power of an abalone was related to 
me many years ago by Dr. Edward Palmer. While in New Mexico, 
upon one occasion, he was witness to a trade wherein the consideration 
for a horse was a California abalone shell. 

How far or to what extent the use of the uhl-lo for the purposes of 
money prevailed is quite uncertain, or where the use of it as money left 
off or as jewelry began, is too vague even for conjecture. It is, however, 
highly probable that it was used in both of these ways ; less as money 
and more as jewelry or for personal decoration, and for the ornamentation 
of the implements and appurtenances of the red man. 

As before the termination of what may be termed the wampum period 
in the colonial history of the Atlantic sea-board States, shell money, 
" bad, false, and unfinished peage," got into circulation, so the shell, 
money of the west coast Indians was counterfeited or made by white 
men with machinery, and the purchasing power consequently declined. 
But the decline was not from this cause alone. At the time when Mr. 
Powers wrote, he stated that " the younger English-speaking Indians 
scarcely use it at all, except in a few dealings with their elders or for 
gambling. One sometimes lays away a few strings of it, for he knows 
he can not squander it at the stores, and is thus removed from tempta- 
tion and possible bankruptcy ; and when he wishes for a few dollars of 
American money he can raise it by exchanging with some old Indian 
who happens to have gold. * * * It is singular how the old Indians 
cling to this currency, when they know that it will purchase nothing 
from the shops; but then their wants are few aad mostly supplied from 
the sources of nature, and besides that, this money has a certain re- 
ligious value in their minds as being alone worthy to be offered up on 
the funeral pyre of departed friends or famous chiefs of their tribe." 

Shell money made by white men was introduced among the Indians 
probably more than half a century ago, and quite likely by the Ameri- 
can Fur Company at a still earlier period. In Mr. Norton's papert it 
is stated that Mr. Astor was one of the patrons of " The Last Wampum 
Coinage" or had been a customer, and Mr. Astor has always been re- 
garded as the leading spirit and controlling genius of that famous com- 
mercial enterprise whose field of operations extended to the western

shores of the continent. A large number of specimens or pieces of Au- 
lo-ne or Ab-a-lone money (iihl-lo), of recent (white man's) manufacture — 
all alike, too much alike to be genuine — made from the columella, or 
"outer edge," as Mr. Powers calls it, are in the collection of the Na- 
tional Museum. These came from the west coast, but they are simply 
samples of "false peage," as the bogus shell money of the Atlantic side 
was termed. 

Unlike the shell money of the east coast Indians, the shell money of 
the red men of the west coast had no status as "a medium or cur- 
rency" with the whites. The necessities of the period and of the situ- 
ation that led to and caused the very general use of wampum or shell 
money in the intercourse and relations of the red men and white settlers 
of the Atlantic sea-board never existed on the western slope of the 
continent. 

The Indian money of the west coast was practically used only among 
the Indians themselves. Neither, so far as we can perceive, has the 
hi-qua, hai-qua, or alli-co- chick, the kol-kol, ha-wock, or iihl-lo, in what- 
ever manner or form used or combined, ever held as high or a similar 
place or function as or with the wampum or Indian money of the ancient 
Americans of the East in its symbolic, historical, governmental, and 
mnemonic aspects. 

There is, it will be admitted, a touch of pathos, a gleam of sentiment, 
exhibited in the preference of the "old Indians" for their money, "a 
touch of nature" in their esteeming it "as alone worthy to be offered up 
on the funeral pyre of departed friends or famous chiefs of their tribe." 

The Indian money of the Pacific coast* was hardly more than money, 
jewelry, or ornament. However used it was never more than these — an 
evidence of the acquisitive spirit and wealth of its possessor. The In- 
dian money of the Atlantic coast had other uses and served higher pur- 
poses, and in these latter aspects indicated the intelligence and latent 
intellectual power and strength of the native red men of that side, and 
by comparison from this point of view serves also to show the superiority 
of the aborigines of the eastern to those of the western side of the con- 
tinent. 

SHELL MONEY AND THE SLAVE TRADE. 

The use of cowry money in the African slave trade has heretofore 
been mentioned. It will be seen upon investigation that the shell 
money of the red men of North America was commonly used for a 
similar purpose, as well as for the compounding of crimes and the 
evasion of the penalties demanded by justice. In these latter respects 
the black and white peage of the east, and the haiJc-wa, alli-co-chicJc and 
ha-woclc of the west coast, were of equal potency with the most ap-

A STUDY OF PRIMITIVE MONEY. 331 

proved forms of gold and silver money of the present time, when ap- 
plied, as the latter has been and not infrequently, to similar unworthy 
purposes in modern civilized communities. In other respects the 
Indians of the East and the West were alike, simply savages, before the 
advent of the white man as well as after — to use a homely expression, 
" chips off the same block." Lawson,* commenting upou the power 
of peage in the matters just presented, says: 

"This is the money with which you may buy skins, furs, slaves, or any- 
thing the Indians have ; it being the mammon (as our money is to us) 
that entices and persuades them to do anything and part with every- 
thing they possess except their children for slaves. As for their wives, 
they are often sold, and their daughters violated for it. With this they 
buy off murders; and whatsoever a man can do that is ill, this wam- 
pum will quit him of and make him, in their opinion, good and virtuous, 
though never so black before." 

Gibbs states that among the Indians of the coast section of Oregon 
and Washington, "slavery is thoroughly interwoven with their social 
polity. East of the Cascades, though it exists it is not so common, the 
equestrian habit of the tribes living there probably rendering it less 
profitable, etc. * * * The system most likely originated in wars, 
all prisoners becoming slaves as a matter of course. * * * If one 
Indian has wronged another and failed to make compensation, or if a 
debtor is insolvent, he may be taken as a slave. And this slavery is 
final degradation. If a man purchase his father or mother they become 
his slave and are treated as such." 

From other sources corroboratory of Gibbs, we find that "with the 
Classets t slaves are held by all the tribes, and are treated very much 
like their dogs, being looked upon as property and not within the cate- 
gory of humanity. For a master to kill half a dozen slaves is no 
wrong or cruelty ; it only tends to illustrate the owner's noble disposi- 
tion in freely sacrificing his property. Slaves are obtained by kidnap- 
ping, and are sold in large numbers to northern tribes. * * * The 
Classets, a rich and powerful tribe, encourage the slave-hunting incur- 
sions of the Nootkas against their weaker neighbors." 

Slavery, common to all the coast families, is also practiced by the 
Chinooks, but there is less difference here perhaps than elsewhere be- 
tween the condition of the slaves and the free. 

In this connection, of the tribes farther to the north we read that " the 
Thlinket slaves are either captured in war, bought from other tribes 
who may themselves have captured them, or the children of female 
slaves. The wars between the tribes, being now of rare occurrence, the 
supply of slaves is kept up by barter with the more southern tribes, and 
hence many of the slaves are the Flatheads of Oregon. The slaves of

the Thlinkets * * * have no rights that the master is bound to 
respect."* 

Among the Tacullies " slavery is common with them; all who can 
afford it keeping slaves;" and so with the Nootkas. Slavery is 
practiced by all the tribes and the slave trade forms an important part 
of their commerce. Among the Haidahs "slavery is universal, and as 
the life of the slave is of no value to the owner except as property, they 
are treated with extreme cruelty;" and Lord says of the Indians of 
British Columbia, " slaves are bought and sold after the fashion of dogs 
and horses, and shells of the Dektalium are the sovereigns and shillings 
used to pay for them." 

SHELL MONEY AND THE COMPOUNDING- OF CRIMES. 

Proceeding along the west coast from Alaska to California, various 
authorities have reported that among the Kutchins of the Yukon, "in 
the absence of law, murder and all other crimes are compounded for." 

Of the littoral or maritime tribes of British Columbia, among the 
Haidahs, " crimes have no punishment by law ; murder is settled for 
with relatives of the victim by death or by the payment of a large sum." 
With the Indians farther to the eastward, Harmon, referring to the 
Tacullies, says, " Murde* is not considered as a crime of great mag- 
nitude." 

To the southward of Puget Sound and British Columbia, in addition 
to what has been incidentally quoted elsewhere in the text, powers 
says of the Hupas, " Murder is generally compounded for by the pay- 
ment of shell money," and among the Gallinomero, a branch of the Po- 
mos, the same author states that "no crime is known for which the 
malefactor can not atone with money." Among the Karoks "the 
murder of a man's dearest relative may be compounded for by the pay- 
ment of money, the price of the average Indian's life being i-sapa-sora 
(one string). * * * "A man may own as many women for slaves 
as he can purchase." * * * No adultery is so flagrant but that 
the husband can be placated with money at about the rate that would 
be paid for murder." 

SHELL-MONEY ARISTOCRACY. 

Amid the dreary repulsiveness of sensualism and cruelty we catch a 
gleam of the ludicrous as well as a revelation of the weakness and 
vanity of these primitive barbarians, that reads like a satire or seems 
like a burlesque on certain facies of modern society among civilized 
pale-faces. The influence of the almighty dollar in many of the polite 
circles of nineteenth-century civilization seems like a travesty with 
variations and improvements upon the magic power of haik-wa, alii co- 
chick, hawoclc, and kol-Jcol, etc., in the matter of social status among 

* Dall's Alaska, 1870. 



A STUDY OF PEIMITIVE MONEY. 333 

the shell money aristocracy of the Karoks, Hupas, Haidahs, and others 
of the ancient families of western America. 

Among the Karoks " no marriage is legal or binding unless preceded 
by the payment of money, and that family is most aristocratic in which 
the most money was paid for the wife. For this reason it stands a young 
man well in hand to be diligent in accumulating shell money and not 
to be a niggard in bargaining with his father-in-law. So far is this 
shell aristocracy carried, that the children of a woman for whom no 
money was paid are accounted no better than bastards, and the whole 
family are condemned." 

The Hupas have the same shell aristocracy as the Karok, the amount 
paid for the wife determining her rank in society. 

Among the Haidahs "rank and power depend greatly upon wealth, 
which consists of implements, wives, and slaves. Wealth, which is 
quite as important here as in any civilized communities and of much 
more importance than is customary among savage nations, consists in 
shell money, called alli-co-chick, white deer-skins, canoes, and indirectly 
in women." Again : ll Wives, as they must be bought, are a sign of 
wealth, and the owner of many is respected accordingly." 

Two centuries have nearly passed since the " peage " and " wampum h 
of the eastern aborigines ceased to be an implement in the current 
activities in the colonial life of the Atlantic sea-board. A century later 
and the red men themselves had become as obsolete as their " coinage ; " 
outcasts and wanderers from their native haunts, overlooked and for- 
gotten in the tumult, or trampled out in the triumphant westward march 
of a conquering race. 

The past of the red men of the Pacific has not yet been reached. They 
still live and wander, but the twilight is upon them. The glimpse that 
we get incidentally in our brief review is that of forty or fifty years ago 
rather than to day. 

On the shores of British Columbia and at many places to the north, 
to Alaska and inclusive of that Territory, they are numerous even now. 
To the southward it is different. We may follow the westerly slopes of 
the Sierra Nevada, or either flank of the picturesque Coast Eanges, or 
the shore line from southern California to Puget Sound without meet- 
ing a solitary sample of the native stock. Again, perchance while hunt- 
ing in the valleys or fishing in the streams a few "bucks and squaws" 
may be met with, disguised in the cast-off garments of the alien whites. 

In the pleasant valleys where the Wintuns, Matsuns, and Shastas 
once roamed in all the pomp and circumstance of savage pride, adorned 
with glittering fragments of aulone, or necklaces of hawocJc or Jcol-kol, 
a few arrow-heads or mortars may be found to verify the traditions of 
former occupancy. Here and there the shriveled remnants of the tribes 
and families, the former tenants of this vast region, are gathered into 
reservations, human drift-weed in the eddies of the stream, thrust aside 
by the pitiless current of a resistless civilization.

BIBLIOGRAPHY. 

Should the reader be desirous of pursuing this subject further, the 
writer would particularly recommend Mr. Holmes's memoir, as well as 
that of Mr. W. B, Weeden, the title of which has previously been given. 
These memoirs are not only especially valuable for the foot-notes and 
copious references to the bibliography of the subjects treated, but as 
well for their intelligent arrangement and the judicious comments of 
the authors ; Stearns's " Shell Money," in the American Naturalist, vol. 
Ill, March, 1869 ; "Aboriginal Shell Money," Proceedings of the Cali- 
fornia Academy of Sciences, July, 1873 ; "Aboriginal Shell Money," in

A PRELIMINARY CATALOGUE OF THE ESKIMO COLLECTION IN THE U. S. 
NATIONAL MUSEUM, ARRANGED GEOGRAPHICALLY AND BY USES, 



By Lieut. T. Dix Bolles, U. S. Navy. 



The list here presented is intended to be of service as an introduction 
to a complete analysis of Eskimo art. 

The collection is made up of the smaller collections of R. Macfarlane, 
Capt. E. P. Herendeen, E. Kennicott, C. P. Hall, Prof. W. H. Ball, T. 
H. Bean, E. W. Nelson, L. M. Turner, L. Kumlein ; Lieut. George M. 
Stoney, U. S. Navy; Captain Hooper, U. S. Revenue Marine; Lieut C. 
L. McKay, U. S. Revenue Marine; Lieut. P. H. Ray, U. S. Army; Henry 
W. Elliott; Sergt. S. Applegate, U. S. Signal Corps; William J. Fisher, 
and others. 

Nearly two years have been occupied by the compiler in reaching a 
result which he trusts will aid the student who may be inclined to an 
exhaustive comparison between the various villages or the Indian tribes 
whose boundaries touch the Eskimo territory. 

The nomenclature is that of Ivan PetrofF, from his chart in vol. viii, 
Tenth Census Report. Differences in spelling and even in names made 
it necessary to adopt some writer's plan in its entirety, even if some 
errors were evident. Petroff seems to me the most accurate and also 
has more or less official status. 

In many cases the location or use of an object was wrongly given by 
collectors ; this was misleading at first, but before long the multiplica- 
tion of these errors caused serious confusion. These have been placed 
in their proper locality. 

In the following table of places the geographical arrangement follows 
the coast-lines from east to west and south, taking in the outlying 
islands, etc., as they occur geographically. 

Although similarities in many or even all respects may point to a 
closer connection between vicinities which are only a few miles apart, 
these may be separated in the list by a number of geographically-coast- 
line-following places ; no attempt to follow these similarities will be 
made here. 

Latitudes and longitudes are given to facilitate identification. The 
numbers in the columns express the whole number of specimens from 
a locality. 

In the resume" at the end the writer notes the total number of arti- 
cles handled, located, arranged, marked, and labeled.

partial utilization, and almost complete extermination of the great 
American bison may serve to cause the public to fully realize the 
folly ot allowing all our most valuable and interesting American mam- 
mals to be wantonly destroyed in the same manner. The wild buffalo 
is practically gone forever, and in a few more years, when the whitened 
bones of the last bleaching skeleton shall have been picked up and 
shipped East for commercial uses, nothing will remain of him save his 
old, well-worn trails along the water- courses, a few museum specimens, 
and regret for his fate. If his untimely end fails even to point a moral 
that shall benefit the surviving species of mammals which are now being 
slaughtered in like manner, it will be sad indeed. 

Although Bison americanus is a true bison, according to scientific 
classification, and not a buffalo, the fact that more than sixty millions of 
people in this country unite in calling him a "buffalo," and know him 
by no other name, renders it quite unnecessary for me to apologize for 
following, in part, a harmless custom which has now become so uni- 
versal that all the naturalists in the world could not change it if they 

would.

THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 



By William T. Horn ad ay, 
Superintendent of the National Zoological Park. 



PART I.— LIFE HISTORY OF THE BISON, 

I. Discovery of the species. 

The discovery of the American bison, as first made by Europeans, 
occurred in the menagerie of a heathen king. 

In the year 1521, when Oortez reached Anahuac, the American bison 
was seen for the first time by civilized Europeans, if we may be per- 
mitted to thus characterize the horde of blood-thirsty plunder- seekers 
who fought their way to the Aztec capital. With a degree of enter- 
prise that marked him as an enlightened monarch, Montezuma main- 
tained, for the instruction of his people, a well-appointed menagerie, of 
which the historian De Solis wrote as follows (1724): 

"In the second Square of the same House were the Wild Beasts, 
which were either presents to Montezuma, or taken by his Hunters, in 
strong Cages of Timber, rang'd in good Order, and under Cover : Lions, 
Tygers, Bears, and all others of the savage Kind which New-Spain 
produced ; among which the greatest Barity was the Mexican Bull ; a 
wonderful composition of divers Animals. It has crooked Shoulders, 
with a Bunch on its Back like a Camel ; its Flanks dry, its Tail large, 
and its Neck cover'd with Hair like a Lion. It is cloven footed, its 
Head armed like that of a Bull, which it resembles in Fierceness, with 
no less strength and Agility." 

Thus was the first-seen buffalo described. The nearest locality from 
whence it could have come was the State of Coahuila, in northern 
Mexico, between 400 and 500 miles away, and at that time vehicles 
were unknown to the Aztecs. But for the destruction of the whole 
mass of the written literature of the Aztecs by the priests of the Span- 
ish Conquest, we might now be reveling in historical accounts of the bison 
which would make the oldest of our present records seem of compar- 
atively recent date. 

Nine years after the event referred to above, or in 1530, another 
Spanish explorer, Alvar Nunez Cabeza, afterwards called Cabeza de 
Vaca — or, in other words " Cattle Cabeza," the prototype of our own 
distinguished "Buffalo Bill" — was wrecked on the Gulf coast, west of 

373

the delta of the Mississippi, from whence he wandered westward through 
what is now the State of Texas. In southeastern Texas he discovered 
the American bison on his native heath. So far as can be ascertained, 
this was the earliest discovery of the bison in a wild state, and the 
description of the species as recorded by the explorer is of historical 
interest. It is brief and superficial. The unfortunate explorer took 
very little interest in animated nature, except as it contributed to the 
sum of his daily food, which was then the all-important subject of his 
thoughts. He almost starved. This is all he has to say : * 

"Cattle come as far as this. I have seen them three times, and 
eaten of their meat. I think they are about the size of those in Spain. 
They have small horns like those of Morocco, and the hair long and 
flocky, like that of the merino. Some are light brown (pardillas) and 
others black. To my judgment the flesh is finer and sweeter than that 
of this country [Spain]. The Indians make blankets of those that are 
not full grown, and of the larger they make shoes and bucklers. They 
come as far as the sea-coast of Florida [now Texas], and in a direction 
from the north, and range over a district of more than 400 leagues. In 
the whole extent of plain over which they roam, the people who live 
bordering upon it descend and kill them for food, and thus a great many 
skins are scattered throughout the country." 

Goronado was the next explorer who penetrated the country of the 
buffalo, which he accomplished from the west, by way of Arizona and 
New Mexico. He crossed the southern part of the " Panhandle" of 
Texas, to the edge of what is now the Indian Territory, and returned 
through the same region. It was in the year 1542 that he reached the 
buffalo country, and traversed the plains that were " full of crooke- 
backed oxen, as the mountaine Serena in Spaine is of sheepe." This is 
the description of the animal as recorded by one of his followers, Casta- 
fieda, and translated by W. W. Davis : t 

" The first time we encountered the buffalo, all the horses took to 
flight on seeing them, for they are horrible to the sight." 

" They have a broad and short face, eyes two palms from each other, 
and projecting in such a manner sideways that they can see a pursuer. 
Their beard is like that of goats, and so long that it drags the ground 
when they lower the head. They have, on the anterior portion of the 
body, a frizzled hair like sheep's wool ; it is very fine upon the croup, 
and sleek like a lion's mane. Their horns are very short and thick, and 
can scarcely be seen through the hair. They always change their hair 
in May, and at this season they really resemble lions. To make it drop 
more quickly, for they change it as adders do their skins, they roll 
among the brush- wood which they find in the ravines. 

" Their tail is very short, and terminates in a great tuft. When they 
run they carry it in the air like scorpions. When quite young they are

tawny, and resemble our calves ; but as age increases they change color 
and form. 

"Another thing which struck us was that all the old buffaloes that we 
killed had the left ear cloven, while it was entire in the young ; we could 
never discover the reason of this. 

" Their wool is so fine that handsome clothes would certainly be made 
of it, but it can not be dyed for it is tawny red. "We were much sur- 
prised at sometimes meeting innumerable herds of bulls without a single 
cow, and other herds of cows without bulls." 

Neither De Soto, Ponce de Leon, Yasquez de Ayllon, nor Pamphilo 
de Karvaez ever saw a buffalo, for the reason that all their explorations 
were made south of what was then the habitat of that animal. At the 
time De Soto made his great exploration from Florida northwestward 
to the Mississippi and into Arkansas (1539-'41) he did indeed pass 
through country in northern Mississippi and Louisiana that was after- 
ward inhabited by the buffalo, but at that time not one was to be found 
there. Some of his soldiers, however, who were sent into the northern 
part of Arkansas, reported having seen buffalo skins in the possession 
of the Indians, and were told that live buffaloes were to be found 5 or 6 
leagues north of their farthest point. 

The earliest discovery of the bison in Eastern North America, or in- 
deed anywhere north of Coronado's route, was made somewhere near 
Washington, District of Columbia, in 1612, by an English navigator 
named Samuell Argoll,* and narrated as follows : 

"As soon as I had unladen this corne, I set my men to the felling of 
Timber, for the building of a Frigat, which I had left half finished at 
Point Comfort, the 19. of March : and returned myself with the ship 
into Pembrook [Potomac] Eiver, and so discovered to the head of it, 
which is about 65. leagues into the Land, and navigable for any ship. 
And then marching into the Countrie, I found great store of Cattle as 
big as Kine, of which the Indians that were my guides killed a couple, 
which we found to be very good and wholesome meate, and are very 
easie to be killed, in regard they are heavy, slow, and not so wild as 
other beasts of the wildernesse." 

It is to be regretted that the narrative of the explorer affords no clew 
to the precise locality of this interesting discovery, but since it is doubtful 
that the mariner journeyed very far on foot from the head of navigation 
of the Potomac, it seems highly probable that the first American bison 
seen by Europeans, other than the Spaniards, was found within 15 miles, 
or even less, of the capital of the United States, and possibly within the 
District of Columbia itself. 

The first meeting of the white man with the buffalo on the northern 
boundary of that animal's habitat occurred in 1679, when Father Hen-

goll touching his Voyage to Virginia, and actions there. Written to Master Nicholas

376 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

nepin ascended the St. Lawrence to the great lakes, and finally pene- 
trated the great wilderness as far as western Illinois. 

The next meeting with the buffalo on the Atlantic slope was in Octo- 
ber, 1729, by a party of surveyors under Col. William Byrd, who were 
engaged in surveying the boundary between North Carolina and Vir- 
ginia. 

As the party journeyed up from the coast, marking the line which 
now constitutes the interstate boundary, three buffaloes were seen on 
Sugar-Tree Creek, but none of them were killed. 

On the return journey, in November, a bull buffalo was killed on 
Sugar-Tree Creek, which is in Halifax County, Virginia, within 5 miles 
of Big Buffalo Creek ; longitude 78° 40" W., and 155 miles from the 
coast.* " It was found all alone, tho' Buffaloes Seldom are." The meat 
is spoken of as " a Rarity," not met at all on the expedition up. The 
animal was found in thick woods, which were thus feelingly described : 
" The woods were thick great Part of this Day's Journey, so that we 
were forced to scuffle hard to advance 7 miles, being equal in fatigue to 
double that distance of Clear and Open Ground." One of the creeks 
which the party crossed was christened Buffalo Creek, and " so named 
from the frequent tokens we discovered of that American Behemoth." 

In October, 1733, on another surveying expedition, Colonel Byrd's 
party had the good fortune to kill another buffalo near Sugar-Tree Creek, 
which incident is thus described :t 

" We pursued our journey thro' uneven and perplext woods, and in 
the thickest of them had the Fortune to knock down a SToung Buffalo 
2 years old. Providence threw this vast animal in our way very Season- 
ably, just as our provisions began to fail us. And it was the more wel- 
come, too, because it was change of dyet, which of all Varietys, next to 
that of Bed-fellows, is the most agreeable. We had lived upon Venison 
and Bear till our stomachs loath'd them almost as much as the Hebrews 
of old did their Quails. Our Butchers were so unhandy at their Busi- 
ness that we grew very lank before we cou'd get our Dinner. But when 
it came, we found it equal in goodness to the best Beef. They made it 
the longer because they kept Sucking the Water out of the Guts in im- 
itation of the Catauba Indians, upon the belief that it is a great Cordial, 
and will even make them drunk, or at least very Gay." 

A little later a solitary bull buffalo was found, but spared^ the earliest 
instance of the kind on record, and which had few successors to keep it 
company. 

II. Geographical Distribution. 

The range of the American bison extended over about one-third of 
the entire continent of North America. Starting almost at tide- water

THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 377 

on the Atlantic coast, it extended westward through a vast tract of 
dense forest, across the Alleghany Mountain system to the prairies 
along the Mississippi, and southward to the Delta of that great stream. 
Although the great plains country of the West was the natural home 
of the species, where it nourished most abundantly, it also wandered 
south across Texas to the burning plains of northeastern Mexico, west- 
ward across the Rocky Mountains into New Mexico, Utah, and Idaho, 
and northward across a vast treeless waste to the bleak and inhospita- 
ble shores of the Great Slave Lake itself. It is more than probable that 
had the bison remained unmolested by man and uninfluenced by him, 
he would eventually have crossed the Sierra Nevadas and the Coast 
Range and taken up his abode in the fertile valleys of the Pacific slope. 

Had the bison remained for a few more centuries in undisturbed pos- 
session of his range, and with liberty to roam at will over the North 
American continent, it is almost certain that several distinctly recog- 
nizable varieties would have been produced. The buffalo of the hot 
regions in the extreme south would have become a short-haired animal 
like the gaur of India and the African buffalo. The individuals inhab- 
iting tbe extreme north, in the vicinity of Great Slave Lake, for exam- 
ple, would have developed still longer hair, and taken on more of the 
dense hairyness of the musk ox. In the " wood " or " mountain buffalo" 
we already have a distinct foreshadowing of the changes which would 
have taken place in the individuals which made their permanent resi- 
dence upon rugged mountains. 

It would be an easy matter to fill a volume with facts relating to the 
geographical distribution of Bison americanus and the dates of its occur- 
rence and disappearance in the multitude of different localities embraced 
within the immense area it once inhabited. The capricious shiftings of 
certain sections of the great herds, whereby large areas which for many 
years had been utterly unvisited by buffaloes suddenly became overrun 
by them, could be followed up indefinitely, but to little purpose. In 
order to avoid wearying the reader with a mass of dates and references, 
the map accompanying this paper has been prepared to show at a glance 
the approximate dates at which the bison finally disappeared from the 
various sections of its habitat. In some cases the date given is coin- 
cident with the death of the last buffalo known to have been killed in 
a given State or Territory ; in others, where records are meager, the 
date given is the nearest approximation, based on existing records. In 
the preparation of this map I have drawn liberally from Mr. J. A. 
Allen's admirable monograph of " The American Bison," in which the 
author has brought together, with great labor and invariable accuracy, 
a vast amount of historical data bearing upon this subject. In this 
connection I take great pleasure in acknowledging my indebtedness to 
Professor Allen's work. 

While it is inexpedient to include here all the facts that might be 
recorded with reference to the discovery, existence, and ultimate extinc-

tion of the bison in the various portions of its former habitat, it is yet 
worth while to sketch briefly the extreme limits of its range. In doing 
this, our starting point will be the Atlantic slope east of the Allegha- 
nies, and the reader will do well to refer to the large map. 

District of Columbia. — There is no indisputable evidence that 
the bison ever inhabited this precise locality, but it is probable that it 
did. In 1612 Captain Argoll sailed up the " Pembrook Eiver " to the 
head of navigation (Mr. Allen believes this was the James River, and 
not the Potomac) and marched inland a few miles, where he discovered 
buffaloes, some of which were killed by his Indian guides. If this 
river was the Potomac, and most authorities believe that it was, the 
buffaloes seen by Captain Argoll might easily have been in what is now 
the District of Columbia. 

Admitting the existence of a reasonable doubt as to the identity of 
the Pembrook Eiver of Captain Argoll, there is yet another bit of his- 
tory which fairly establishes the fact that in the early part of the sev- 
enteenth century buffaloes inhabited the banks of the Potomac between 
this city and the lower falls. In 1624 an English fur-trader named 
Henry Fleet came hither to trade with the Anacostian Indians, who 
then inhabited the present site of the city of Washington, and with 
the tribes of the Upper Potomac. In his journal (discovered a few 
years since in the Lambeth Library, London) Fleet gave a quaint 
description of the city's site as it then appeared. The following is from 
the explorer's journal: 

" Monday, the 25th June, we set sail for the town of Tohoga, where 
we came to an anchor 2 leagues short of the falls. * * * This 
place, without question, is the most pleasant and healthful place in all 
this country, and most convenient for habitation, the air temperate in 
summer and not violent in winter. It aboundeth with all manner of 
fish. The Indians in one night commonly will catch thirty sturgeons 
in a place where the river is not above 12 fathoms broad, and as for deer, 
buffaloes, bears, turkeys, the woods do swarm with them. * * * 
The 27th of June I manned my shallop and went up with the flood, the 
tide rising about 4 feet at this place. We had not rowed above 3 miles, 
but we might hear the falls to roar about 6 miles distant."* 

Maryland. — There is no evidence that the bison ever inhabited 
Maryland, except what has already been adduced with reference to the 
District of Columbia. If either of the references quoted may be taken 
as conclusive proof, and I see no reason for disputing either, then the 
fact that the bison once ranged northward from Virginia into Maryland 
is fairly established. There is reason to expect that fossil remains of 
Bison americanus will yet be found both in Maryland and the District 
of Columbia, and I venture to predict that this will yet occur. 

Virginia. — Of the numerous references to the occurrence of the bison 
in Virginia, it is sufficient to allude to Col. William Byrd's meetings 

* Charles Burr Todd's " Story of Washington, p. 18. New York, 1889. 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 379 

with buffaloes in 1620, while surveying the southern boundary of the 
State, about 155 miles from the coast, as already quoted; the refer- 
ences to the discovery of buffaloes on the eastern side of the Virginia 
mountains, quoted by Mr. Allen from Salmon's ''Present State of Vir- 
ginia,' 7 page 14 (London, 1737), and the capture and domestication of 
buffaloes in 1701 by the Huguenot settlers at Manikintown, which was 
situated on the James Eiver, about 14 miles above Eichmond. Appar- 
ently, buffaloes were more numerous in Virginia than in any other of the 
Atlantic States. 

North Carolina. — Colonel Byrd's discoveries along the inter-state 
boundary between Virginia and North Carolina fixes the presence of 
the bison in the northern part of the latter State at the date of the 
survey. The following letter to Prof. G. Brown Goode, dated Birdsnest 
post-office, Va., August 6, 1888, from Mr. C. B. Moore, furnishes reliable 
evidence of the presence of the buffalo at another point in North Car- 
olina: "In the winter of 1857 I was staying for the night at the house 
of an old gentleman named Houston. I should judge he was seventy 
then. He lived near Buffalo Ford, on the Catawba Biver, about 4 miles 
from Statesville, N. C. I asked him how the ford got its name. He 
told me that his grandfather told him that when he was a boy the buf- 
falo crossed there, and that when the rocks in the river were baro they 
would eat the moss that grew upon them." The point indicated is in 
longitude 81° west and the date not far from 1750. 

South Carolina. — Professor Allen cites numerous authorities, whose 
observations furnish abundant evidence of the existence of the buffalo 
in South Carolina during the first half of the eighteenth century. From 
these it is quite evident that in the northwestern half of the State buf- 
faloes were once fairly numerous. Keating declares, on the authority 
of Colhoun, " and we know that some of those who first settled the 
Abbeville district in South Carolina, in 1756, found the buffalo there." * 
This appears to be the only definite locality in which the presence of 
the species was recorded. 

Georgia. — The extreme southeastern limit of the buffalo in the 
United States was found on the coast of Georgia, near the mouth of 
the Altamaha Biver, opposite St. Simon's Island. Mr. Francis Moore, 
in his "Voyage to Georgia," made in 1736 and reported upon in 1744,t 
makes the following observation: 

"The island [St. Simon's] abounds with deer and rabbits. There are 
no buffalo in it, though there are large herds upon the main." Else- 
where in the same document (p. 122) reference is made to buffalo-hunt- 
ing by Indians on the main-land near Darien. 

In James E. Oglethorpe's enumeration (A. D. 1733) of the wild beasts 
of Georgia and South Carolina he mentions "deer, elks, bears, wolves, 
and buffaloes."^:

t Ibid., I, p. 51. 



380 KEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

Up to the time of Moore's voyage to Georgia the interior was almost 
wholly unexplored, and it is almost certain that had not the "large 
herds of buffalo on the main-land" existed within a distance of 20 or 30 
miles or less from the coast, the colonists would have had no knowledge 
of them ; nor would the Indians have taken to the war-path against the 
whites at Darien "under pretense of hunting buffalo." 

Alabama. — Having established the existence of the bison in north- 
western Georgia almost as far down as the center of the State, and in 
Mississippi down to the neighborhood of the coast, it was naturally 
expected that a search of historical records would reveal evidence that 
the bison once inhabited the northern half of Alabama. A most careful 
search through all the records bearing upon the early history and ex- 
ploration of Alabama, to be found in the Library of Congress, failed to 
discover the slightest reference to the existence of the species in that 
State, or even to the use of buffalo skins by any of the Alabama In- 
dians. While it is possible that such a hiatus really existed, in this 
instance its existence would be wholly unaccountable. I believe that 
the buffalo once inhabited the northern half of Alabama, even though 
history fails to record it. 

Louisiana and Mississippi. — At the beginning of the eighteenth 
century, buffaloes were plentiful in southern Mississippi and Louisiana, 
not only down to the coast itself, from Bay St. Louis to Biloxi, but 
even in the very Delta of the Mississippi, as the following record shows. 
In a " Memoir addressed to Count de Pontchar train," December 10, 
1697, the author, M. de Eemonville, describes the country around the 
mouth of the Mississippi, now the State of Louisiana, and further 
says : * 

"A great abundance of wild cattle are also found there, which might 
be domesticated by rearing up the young calves." Whether these ani- 
mals were buffaloes might be considered an open question but for the 
following additional information, which affords positive evidence: 
" The trade in furs and peltry would be immensely valuable and ex- 
ceedingly profitable. We could also draw from thence a great quantity 
of buffalo hides every year, as the plains are filled with the animals." 

In the same volume, page 47, in a document entitled "Annals of Loui- 
siana from 1698 to 1722, by M. Penicaut" (1698), the author records 
the presence of the buffalo on the Gulf coast on the banks of the Bay 
St. Louis, as follows: "The next day we left Pea Island, and passed 
through the Little Eigolets, which led into the sea about three leagues 
from the Bay of St. Louis. We encamped at the entrance of the bay, 
near a fountain of water that flows from the hills, and which was called 
at this time Belle Fountain. We hunted during several days upon the 
coast of this bay, and filled our boats with the meat of the deer, buffa- 
loes, and other wild game which we had killed, and carried it to the 
fort (Biloxi)."

THE EXTEEMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 381 

The occurrence of the buffalo at Natchez is recorded,* and also (p. 
115) at the mouth of Eed River, as follows : u We ascended the Missis- 
sippi to Pass Manchac, where we killed fifteen buffaloes. The next day 
we landed again, and killed eight more buffaloes and as many deer." 

The presence of the buffalo in the Delta of the Mississippi was ob- 
served and recorded by D'Iberville in 1699.f 

According to Claiborne, J the Choctaws have an interesting tradition 
in regard to the disappearance of the buffalo from Mississippi. It re- 
lates that during the early part of the eighteenth century a great 
drought occurred, which was particularly severe in the prairie region. 
For three years not a drop of rain fell. The Nowubee and Tombigbee 
Eivers dried up and the forests perished. The elk and buffalo, which 
up to that time had been numerous, all migrated to the country beyond 
the Mississippi, and never returned. 

Texas. — It will be remembered that it was in southeastern Texas, 
in all probability within 50 miles of the present city of Houston, that 
the earliest discovery of the American bison on its native heath was 
made in 1530 by Cabeza de Vaca, a half-starved, half-naked, and wholly 
wretched Spaniard, almost the only surviving member of the celebrated 
expedition which burned its ships behind it. In speaking of the buffalo 
in Texas at the earliest periods of which we have any historical record, 
Professor Allen says : " They were also found in immense herds on the 
coast of Texas, at the Bay of St. Bernard (Matagorda Bay), and on 
the lower part of the Colorado (Rio Grande, according to some authori- 
ties), by La Salle, in 1685, and thence northwards across the Colorado, 
Brazos, and Trinity Rivers. Joutel says that when in latitude 28° 51' 
" the sight of abundance of goats and bullocks, differing in shape from 
ours, and running along the coast, heightened our earnestness to be 
ashore." They afterwards landed in St. Louis Bay (now called Mata- 
gorda Bay), where they found buffaloes in such numbers on the Colo- 
rado River that they called it La Riviere aux Bceufs.§ According to 
Professor Allen, the buffalo did not inhabit the coast of Texas east of 
the mouth of the Brazos River. 

It is a curious coincidence that the State of Texas, wherein the ear- 
liest discoveries and observations upon the bison were made, should 
also now furnish a temporary shelter for one of the last remnants of 
the great herd. 

Mexico. — In regard to the existence of the bison south of the Rio 
Grande, in old Mexico, there appears to be but one authority on record, 
Dr. Berlandier, who at the time of his death left in MS. a work on 
the mammals of Mexico. At one time this MS. was in the Smithso- 
nian Institution, but it is there no longer, nor is its fate even ascertain-

able. It is probable that it was burned in the fire that destroyed a 
portion of the Institution in 1865. Fortunately Professor Allen ob- 
tained and published in his monograph (in French) a copy of that por- 
tion of Dr. Berlandier's work relating to the presence of the bison in 
Mexico,* of which the following is a translation : 

" In Mexico, when the Spaniards, ever greedy for riches, pushed their 
explorations to the north and northeast, it was not long before they 
met with the buffalo. In 1602 the Franciscan monks who discovered 
Nuevo Leon encountered in the neighborhood of Monterey numerous 
herds of these quadrupeds. They were also distributed in Nouvelle 
Biscaye (States of Chihuahua and Durango), and they sometimes ad- 
vanced to the extreme south of that country. In the eighteenth cen- 
tury they concentrated more and more toward the north, but still re- 
mained very abundant in the neighborhood of the province of Bexar. 
At the commencement of the nineteenth century we see them recede 
gradually in the interior of the country to such an extent that they be- 
came day by day scarcer and scarcer about the settlements. Now, it is 
not in their periodical migrations that we meet them near Bexar. 
Every year in the spring, in April or May, they advance toward the 
north, to return again to the southern regions in September and Octo- 
ber. The exact limits of these annual migrations are unknown ; it is, 
however, probable that in the north they never go beyond the banks of 
the Bio Bravo, at least in the States of Cohahuila and Texas. Toward 
the north, not being checked by the currents of the Missouri, they pro- 
gress even as far as Michigan, and they are found in summer in the 
Territories and interior States of the United States of North America. 
The route which these animals follow in their migrations occupies a 
width of several miles, and becomes so marked that, besides the verdure 
destroyed, one would believe that the fields had been covered with 
manure. 

"These migrations are not general, for certain bands do not seem to 
follow the general mass of their kin, but remain stationary throughout 
the whole year on the prairies covered with a rich vegetation on the 
banks of the Bio de Guadelupe and the Bio Colorado of Texas, not 
far from the shores of the Gulf, to the east of the colony of San Felipe, 
precisely at the same spot where La Salle and his traveling companions 
saw them two hundred years before. The Bev. Father Damian Man- 
sanet saw them also as in our days on the shores of Texas, in regions 
which have since been covered with the habitations, hamlets, and 
villages of the new colonists, and from whence they have disappeared 
since 1828. 

" From the observations made on this subject we may conclude that 
the buffalo inhabited the temperate zone of the New World, and that 
they inhabited it at all times. In the north they never advanced be- 
yond the 48th or 58th degree of latitude, and in the south, although

they may have reached as low as 25°, they scarcely passed beyond the 
27th or 28th degree (north latitude), at least in the inhabited and known 
portions of the country." 

New Mexico. — In 1542 Coronado, while on his celebrated march, 
met with vast herds of buffalo on the Upper Pecos Eiver, since which 
the presence of the species in the valley of the Pecos has been well 
known. In describing the journey of Espejo down the Pecos Eiver in 
the year 1584, Davis says (Spanish Conquest of New Mexico, p. 260) : 
" They passed down a river they called Bio de las Vacas, or the Eiver 
of Oxen [the river Pecos, and the same Cow Eiver that Vaca describes, 
says Professor Allen], and was so named because of the great number 
of buffaloes that fed upon its banks. They traveled down this river 
the distance of 120 leagues, all the way passing through great herds of 
buffaloes." 

Professor Allen locates the western boundary of the buffalo in New 
Mexico even as far west as the western side of Eio Grande del Norte. 

Utah. — It is well known that buffaloes, though in very small num- 
bers, once inhabited northeastern Utah, and that a few were killed by 
the Mormon settlers prior to 1840 in the vicinity of Great Salt Lake. 
In the museum at Salt Lake City I was shown a very ancient mounted 
head of a buffalo bull which was said to have been killed in the Salt 
Lake Valley. It is doubtful that such was really fact. There is no 
evidence that the bison ever inhabited the southwestern half of Utah, 
and, considering the general sterility of the Territory as a whole pre- 
vious to its development by irrigation, it is surprising that any buffalo 
in his senses would ever set foot in it at all. 

Idaho. — The former range of the bison probably embraced the whole 
of Idaho. Fremont states that in the spring of 1824 " the buffalo were 
spread in immense numbers over the Green Eiver and Bear Eiver 
Valleys, and through all the country lying between the Colorado, or 
Green Eiver of the Gulf of California, and Lewis' Fork of the Columbia 
Eiver, the meridian of Fort Hall then forming the western limit of their 
range. [In J. K. Townsend's " Narrative of a Journey across the Eocky 
Mountains," in 1834, he records the occurrence of herds near the Mellade 
and Boise and Salmon Eivers, ten days' journey — 200 miles — west of 
Fort Hall.] The buffalo then remained for many years in that country, 
and frequently moved down the valley of the Columbia, on both sides 
of the river, as far as the Fishing Falls. Below this point they never 
descended in any numbers. About 1834 or 1835 they began to diminish 
A r ery rapidly, and continued to decrease until 1838 or 1840, when, with 
the country we have just described, they entirely abandoned all the 
waters of the Pacific north of Lewis's Fork of the Columbia [now called 
Snake] Eiver. At that time the Flathead Indians were in the habit of 
finding their buffalo on the heads of Salmon Eiver and other streams of 
the Columbia. 



384 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887 

Oregon. — The only evidence on record of the occurrence of the bison 
in Oregon is the following, from Professor Allen's memoir (p. 119) : 
"Bespecting its former occurrence in eastern Oregon, Prof. O. C. Marsh, 
under date of New Haven, February 7, 1875, writes me as follows: 'The 
most western point at which I have myself observed remains of the 
buffalo was in 1873, on Willow Creek, eastern Oregon, among the foot- 
hills on the eastern side of the Blue Mountains. This is about latitude 
44°. The bones were perfectly characteristic, although nearly decom- 
posed.'" 

The remains must have been those of a solitary and very enterpris 
ing straggler. 

The Northwest Territories (British). — At two or three points 
only did the buffaloes of the British Possessions cross the Bocky 
Mountain barrier toward British Columbia. One was the pass through 
which the Canadian Pacific Bailway now runs, 200 miles north of the 
international boundary. According to Dr. Eichardson, the number of 
buffaloes which crossed the mountains at that point were sufficiently 
noticeable to constitute a feature of the fauna on the western side of 
the range. It is said that buffaloes also crossed by way of the Koote- 
nai Pass, which is only a few miles north of the boundary line, but the 
number which did so must have been very small. 

As might be expected from the character of the country, the favorite 
range of the bison in British America was the northern extension of 
the great pasture region lying between the Missouri River and Great 
Slave Lake. The most northerly occurrence of the bison is recorded as 
an observation of Franklin in 1820 at Slave Point, on the north side of 
Great Slave Lake. "A few frequent Slave Point, on the north side of 
the lake, but this is the most northern situation in which they were 
observed by Captain Franklin's party." * 

Dr. Eichardson defined the eastern boundary of the bison's range 
in British Ameri6a as follows : u They do not frequent any of the dis- 
tricts formed of primitive rocks, and the limits of their range to the east- 
ward, within the Hudson's Bay Company's territories, may be correctly 
marked on the map by a line commencing in longitude 97°, on the Eed 
Eiver, which flows into the south end of Lake Winnipeg, crossing the 
Saskatchewan to the westward of the Basquian Hill, and running thence 
by the Athapescow to the east end of Great Slave Lake. Their migra- 
tions westward were formerly limited to the EOcky Mountain range, and 
they are still unknown in New Caledonia and on the shores of the Pa- 
cific to the north of the Columbia Eiver ; but of late years they have 
found out a passage across the mountains near the sources of the Sas- 
katchewan, and their numbers to the westward are annually increasing.! 

Great Slave Lake. — That the buffalo inhabited the southern shore of 
this lake as late as 1871 is well established by the following letter from 

* Sabine, Zoological Appendix to "Franklin's Journey," p, 668, 
t Fauna Boreali-Americana, vol. 1, p. 279-280. 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 385 

Mr. E. W. Nelson to Mr. J. A. Allen, under date of July 11, 1877:* « I 
have met here [St. Michaels, Alaska] two gentlemen who crossed the 
mountains from British Columbia and came to Fort Yukon through 
British America, from whom I have derived some information about 
the buffalo (Bison americanus) which will be of interest to you. These 
gentlemen descended the Peace Biver, and ou about the one hundred 
and eighteenth degree of longitude made a portage to Hay River, di- 
rectly north. On this portage they saw thousands of buffalo skulls, and 
old trails, in some instances 2 or 3 feet deep, leading east and west. 
They wintered on Hay Biver near its entrance into Great Slave Lake, 
and here found the buffalo still common, occupying a restricted territory 
along the southern border of the lake. This was in 1871. They made 
inquiry concerning the large number of skulls seen by them on the 
portage, and learned that about fifty years before, snow fell to the esti- 
mated depth of 14 feet, and so enveloped the animals that they perished 
by thousands. It is asserted that these buffaloes are larger than those 
of the plains." 

Minnesota and "Wisconsin. — A line drawn from Winnipeg to Chi- 
cago, curving slightly to the eastward in the middle portion, will very 
nearly define the eastern boundary of the buffalo's range in Minnesota 
and Wisconsin. 

Illinois and Indiana. — The whole of these two States were formerly 
inhabited by the buffalo, the fertile prairies of Illinois being particu- 
larly suited to their needs. It is doubtful whether the range of the 
species extended north of the northern boundary of Indiana, but since 
southern Michigan was as well adapted to their support as Ohio or In- 
diana, their absence from that State must have been due more to acci- 
dent than design. 

Ohio. — The southern shore of Lake Erie forms part of the northern 
boundary of the bison's range in the eastern United States. La Hon- 
tan explored Lake Erie iu 1687 and thus describes its southern shore: 
" I can not express what quantities of Deer and Turkeys are to be found 
in these Woods, and in the vast Meads that lye upon the South side of 
the Lake. At the bottom of the Lake we find beeves upon the Banks of 
two pleasant Bivers that disembogue into it, without Cataracts or Bapid 
Currents."! It thus appears that the southern shore of Lake Erie forms 
part of the northern boundary of the buffalo's range in the eastern 
United States. 

New York. — In regard to the presence of the bison in any portion 
of the State of New York, Professor Allen considers the evidence as 
fairly conclusive that it once existed in western New York, not only in 
the vicinity of the eastern end of Lake Erie, where now stands the city of 
Buffalo, at the mouth of a large creek of the same name, but also on the 
shore of Lake Ontario, probably in Orleans County. In his monograph

386 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

of "The American Bisons," page 107, lie gives the following testimony 
and conclusions on this point : 

" The occurrence of a stream in western New York, called Buffalo 
Creek, which empties into the eastern end of Lake Erie, is commonly 
viewed as traditional evidence of its occurrence at this point, but posi- 
tive testimony to this effi ct has thus far escaped me. 

" This locality, if it actually came so far eastward, must have formed 
the eastern limit of its range along the lakes. I have found only highly 
questionable allusions to the occurrence of buffaloes along the southern 
shore of Lake Ontario. Keating, on the authority of Colhoun, how- 
ever, has cited a passage from Morton's "New English Canaan" as 
proof of their former existence in the neighborhood of this lake. Mor- 
ton's statement is based on Indian reports, and the context gives suffi- 
cient evidence of the general vagueness of his knowledge of the region 
of which he was speaking. The passage, printed in 1637 is as follows : 
They [the Indians] have also made descriptions of great heards of 
well growne beasts that live about the parts of this lake [Erocoise] such 
as the Christian world (untill this discovery) hath not bin made ac- 
quainted with. These Beasts are of the bignesse of a Cowe, their flesh 
being very goodfoode, their hides good lether, their fleeces very usefull, 
being a kindeof wolle as fine almost as the wolle of the Beaver, and the 
Salvages doe make garments thereof. It is tenne yeares since first the 
relation of these things came to the eares of the English.' The ' beast' 
to which allusion is here made [says Professor Allen] is unquestionably 
the buffalo, but the locality of Lake 'Erocoise' is not so easily settled. 
Colhoun regards it, and probably correctly, as identical with Lake 
Ontario. * * * The extreme northeastern limit of the former range 
of the buffalo seems to have been, as above stated, in western New 
York, near the eastern end of Lake Erie. That it probably ranged 
thus far there is fair evidence." 

Pennsylvania. — From the eastern end of Lake Erie the boundary 
of the bison's habitat extends south into western Pennsylvania, to a 
marsh called Buffalo Swamp on a map published by Peter Kalm in 
1771. Professor Allen says it " is indicated as situated between the 
Alleghany Eiver and the West Branch of the Susquehanna, near the 
heads of the Licking and Toby's Creeks (apparently the streams now 
called Oil Creek and Clarion Creek)." In this region there were at one 
time thousands of buffaloes. While there is not at hand any positive 
evidence that the buffalo ever inhabited the southwestern portion of 
Pennsylvania, its presence in the locality mentioned above, and in West 
Virginia generally, on the south, furnishes sufficient reason for extend- 
ing the boundary so as to include the southwestern portion of the State 
and connect with our starting point, the District of Columbia. 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 387 

III. Abundance. 

Of all the quadrupeds that have lived upon the earth, probably no 
other species has ever marshaled such innumerable hosts as those of 
the American bison. It would have been as easy to count or to esti- 
mate the number of leaves in a forest as to calculate the number of 
buffaloes living at any given time during the history of the species pre- 
vious to 1870. Even in South Central Africa, which has always been ex- 
ceedingly prolific in great herds of game, it is probable that all its 
quadrupeds taken together on an equal area would never have more 
than equaled the total number of buffalo in this country forty years ago. 

To an African hunter, such a statement may seem incredible, but it 
appears to be fully warranted by the literature of both branches of the 
subject. 

Not only did the buffalo formerly range eastward far into the forest 
regions of western New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, the Carolinas, 
and Georgia, but in some places it was so abundant as to cause remark. 
In Mr. J. A. Allen's valuable monograph* appear a great number of 
interesting historical references on this subject, as indeed to every other 
relating to the buffalo, a few of which I will take the liberty of quoting. 

In the vicinity of the spot where the town of Clarion now stands, in 
northwestern Pennsylvania, Mr. Thomas Ashe relates that one of the 
first settlers built his log cabin near a salt spring which was visited by 
buffaloes in such numbers that " he supposed there could not have been 
less than two thousand in the neighborhood of the spring." During the 
first years of his residence there, the buffaloes came in droves of about 
three hundred each. 

Of the Blue Licks in Kentucky, Mr. John Filson thus wrote, in 1784: 
" The amazing herds of buffaloes which resort thither, by their size and 
number, fill the traveller with amazement and terror, especially when 

* All who are especially interested in the life history of the buffalo, both scientific 
and. economical, will do well to consult Mr. Allen's monograph, ''The American 
Bisons, Living and Extinct," if it be accessible. Unfortunately it is a difficult matter 
for the general reader to obtain it. A reprint of the work as originally published, 
but omitting the map, plates, and such of the subject-matter as relates to the extinct 
species, appears in Hay den's "Report of the Geological Survey of the Territories," 
for 1875 (pp. 443-587), but the volume has for several years been out of print. 

The memoir as originally published has the following titles :

388 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

he beholds the prodigious roads they have made from all quarters, as 
if leading to some populous city ; the vast space of land around these 
springs desolated as if by a ravaging enemy, and hills reduced to 
plains ; for the land near these springs is chiefly hilly. * * * I 
have heard a hunter assert he saw above one thousand buffaloes at the 
Blue Licks at once; so numerous were they before the first settlers had 
wantonly sported away their lives." Col. Daniel Boone declared of the 
Bed Biver region in Kentucky, "The buffaloes were more frequent 
than I have seen cattle in the settlements, browzing on the leaves of 
the cane, or cropping the herbage of those extensive plains, fearless be- 
cause ignorant of the violence of man. Sometimes we saw hundreds in 
a drove, and the numbers about the salt springs were amazing." 

According to Bamsey, where Nashville now stands, in 1770 there 
were " immense numbers of buffalo and other wild game. The-country 
was crowded with them. Their bellowings sounded from the hills and 
forest." Daniel Boone found vast herds of buffalo grazing in the val- 
leys of East Tennessee, between the spurs of the Cumberland mount- 
ains. 

Marquette declared that the prairies along the Illinois Biver were 
" covered with buffaloes." Father Hennepin, in writing of northern 
Illinois, between Chicago and the Illinois Biver, asserted that "there 
must be an innumerable quantity of wild bulls in that country, since 
the earth is covered with their horns. * * * They follow one an- 
other, so that you may see a drove of them for above a league together. 
* * * Their ways are as beaten as our great roads, and no herb grows 
therein." 

Judged by ordinary standards of comparison, the early pioneers of 
the last century thought buffalo were abundant in the localities men- 
tioned above. But the herds which lived east of the Mississippi were 
comparatively only mere stragglers from the innumerable mass which 
covered the great western pasture region from the Mississippi to the 
Bocky Mountains, and from the Bio Grande to Great Slave Lake.. The 
town of Kearney, in south central Nebraska, may fairly be considered 
the geographical center of distribution of the species, as it originally 
existed, but ever since 1800, and until a few years ago, the center of 
population has been in the Black Hills of southwestern Dakota. 

Between the Bocky Mountains and the States lying along the Missis- 
sippi Biver on the west, from Minnesota to Louisiana, the whole country 
was one vast buffalo range, inhabited by millions of buffaloes. One 
could fill a volume with the records of plainsmen and pioneers who 
penetrated or crossed that vast region between 1800 and 1870, and 
were in turn surprised, astounded, and frequently dismayed by the tens 
of thousands of buffaloes they observed, avoided, or escaped from. 
They lived and moved as no other quadrupeds ever have, in great mul- 
titudes, like grand armies in review, covering scores of square miles at 
once. They were so numerous they frequently stopped boats in the 



THE EXTERMINATION OP THE AMERICAN BISON. 389 

rivers, threatened to overwhelm travelers on the plains, and in later 
years derailed locomotives and cars, until railway engineers learned by 
experience the wisdom of stopping their trains whenever there were 
buffaloes crossing the track. On this feature of the buffalo's life history 
a few detailed observations may be of value. 

Near the mouth of the White Eiver, in southwestern Dakota, Lewis 
and Clark saw (in 1806) a herd of buffalo which caused them to make 
the following record in their journal : 

u These last animals [buffaloes] are now so numerous that from an 
eminence we discovered more than we had ever seen before at one 
time; and if it be not impossible to calculate the moving multitude, 
which darkened the whole plains, we are convinced that twenty thou- 
sand would be no exaggerated number." 

When near the mouth of the Yellowstone, on their way down the 
Missouri, a previous record had been made of a meeting with other 
herds : 

" The buffalo now appear in vast numbers. A herd happened to be 
on their way across the river [the Missouri]. Such was the multitude 
of these animals that although the river, including an island over which 
they passed, was a mile in length, the herd stretched as thick as they 
could swim completely from one side to the other, and the party was 
obliged to stop for an hour. They consoled themselves for the delay 
by killing four of the herd, and then proceeded till at the distance of 
45 miles they halted on an island, below which two other herds of buf- 
falo, as numerous as the first, soon after crossed the river."* 

Perhaps the most vivid picture ever afforded of the former abun- 
dance of buffalo is that given by Col. E. I. Dodge in his " Plains of the 
Great West," p. 120, et seq. It is well worth reproducing entire : 

"In May, 1871, I drove in a light wagon from Old Fort Zara to Fort 
Larned, on the Arkansas, 34 miles. At least 25 miles of this distance 
was through one immense herd, composed of countless smaller herds of 
buffalo then on their journey north. The road ran along the broad 
level ' bottom,' or valley, of the river. * * * 

"The whole couutry appeared one great mass of buffalo, moving 
slowly to the northward ; and it was only when actually among them that 
it could be ascertained that the apparently solid mass was an agglomer- 
ation of innumerable small herds, of from fifty to two hundred animals, 
separated from the surrounding herds by greater or less space, but 
still separated. The herds in the valley sullenly got out of my way, 
and, turning, stared stupidly at me, sometimes at only a few yards' dis- 
tance. When I had reached a point where the hills were no longer 
more than a mile from the road, the buffalo on the hills, seeing an un- 
usual object in their rear, turned, stared an instant, then started at 
full speed directly towards me, stampeding and bringing with them the 

* Lewis and Clark's Exped., ii, p. 395. 



390 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

numberless herds through which they passed, and pouring down upon 
me all the herds, no longer separated, but one immense compact mass 
of plunging animals, mad with fright, and as irresistible as an avalanche. 

" The situation was by no means pleasant. Eeining up my horse 
(which was fortunately a quiet old beast that had been in at the death 
of many a buffalo, so that their wildest, maddest rush only caused him 
to cock his ears in wonder at their unnecessary excitement), I waited 
until the front of the mass was within 50 yards, when a few well-directed 
shots from my rifle split the herd, and sent it pouring off in two streams 
to my right and left. When all had passed me they stopped, appar- 
ently perfectly satisfied, though thousands were yet within reach of 
my rifle and many within less than 100 yards. Disdaining to fire again, 
I sent my servant to cut out the tongues of the fallen. This occurred 
so frequently within the next 10 miles, that when I arrived at Fort 
Larned I had twenty-six tongues in my wagon, representing the great- 
est number of buffalo that my conscience can reproach me for having 
murdered on any single day. I was not hunting, wanted no meat, and 
would not voluntarily have fired at these herds. I killed only in self- 
preservation and fired almost every shot from the wagon." 

At my request Colonel Dodge has kindly furnished me a careful esti- 
mate upon which to base a calculation of the number of buffaloes in 
that great herd, and the result is very interesting. In a private letter, 
dated September 21, 1887, he writes as follows : 

"The great herd on the Arkansas through which I passed could not 
have averaged, at rest, over fifteen or twenty individuals to the acre, 
but was, from my own observation, not less than 25 miles wide, and 
from reports of hunters and others it was about five days in passing a 
given point, or not less than 50 miles deep. From the top of Pawnee 
Eock I could see from 6 to 10 miles in almost every direction. This 
whole vast space was covered with buffalo, looking at a distance like 
one compact mass, the visual angle not permitting the ground to be 
seen. I have seen such a sight a great number of times, but never on 
so large a scale. 

" That was the last of the great herds." 
• With these figures before us, it is not difficult to make a calculation 
that will be somewhere near the truth of the number of buffaloes act- 
ually seen in one day by Colonel Dodge on the Arkansas Eiver during 
that memorable drive, and also of the number of head in the entire 
herd- 

According to his recorded observation, the herd extended along the 
river for a distance of 25 miles, which was in reality the width of the 
vast procession that was moving north, and back from the road as far 
as the eye could reach, on both sides. It is making a low estimate to 
consider the extent of the visible ground at 1 mile on either side. This 
gives a strip of country 2 miles wide by 25 long, or a total of 50 square 



THE EXTERMINATION OP THE AMERICAN BISON. 391 

miles covered with buffalo, averaging from fifteen to twenty to the acre.* 
Taking the lesser number, in order to be below the truth rather than 
above it, we find that the number actually seen on that day by Colonel 
Dodge was in the neighborhood of 480,000, not counting the additional 
number taken in at the view from the top of Pawnee Eock, which, if 
added, would easily bring the total up to a round half million ! 

If the advancing multitude had been at all points 50 miles in length 
(as it was known to have been in some places at least) by 25 miles in 
width, and still averaged fifteen head to the acre of ground, it would 
have contained the enormous number of 12,000,000 head. But, judging 
from the general principles governing such migrations, it is almost cer- 
tain that the moving mass advanced in the shape of a wedge, which 
would make it necessary to deduct about two-thirds from the grand 
total, which would leave 4,000,000 as our estimate of the actual number 
of buffaloes in this great herd, which I believe is more likely to be be- 
low the truth than above it. 

No wonder that the men of the West of those days, both white and 
red, thought it would be impossible to exterminate such a mighty mul- 
titude. The Indians of some tribes believed that the buffaloes issued 
from the earth continually, and that the supply was necessarily inex- 
haustible. And yet, in four short years the southern herd was almost 
totally annihilated. 

With such a lesson before our eyes, confirmed in every detail by living 
testimony, who will dare to say that there will be an elk, moose, caribou, 
mountain sheep, mountain goat, antelope, or black-tail deer left alive 
in the United States in a wild state fifty years from this date, ay, or 
even twenty-five ? 

Mr. William Blackmore contributes the following testimony to the 
abundance of buffalo in Kansas : t 

" In the autumn of 1868, whilst crossing the plains on the Kansas 
Pacific Eailroad, for a distance of upwards of 120 miles, between Ells- 
worth and Sheridan, we passed through an almost unbroken herd of 
buffalo. The plains were blackened with them, and more than once the 
train had to stop to allow unusually large herds to pass. * * * In 
1872, whilst on a scout for about a hundred miles south of Fort Dodge 
to the Indian Territory, we were never out of sight of buffalo." 

Twenty years hence, when not even a bone or a buffalo-chip remains 
above ground throughout the West to mark the presence of the buffalo, 
it may be difficult for people to believe that these animals ever existed 
in such numbers as to constitute not only a serious annoyance, but very 

* On the plains of Dakota, the Rev. Mr. Belconrt (Schoolcraft's N. A. Indians, IV, 
p. 108) ouce counted two hundred and twenty-eight huffaloes, a part of a great herd, 
feeding on a single acre of ground. This of course was an unusual occurrence with 
buffaloes not stampeding, but practically at rest. It is quite possible also that the 
extent of the ground may have been underestimated.

often a dangerous menace to wagon travel across the plains, and also 
to stop railway trains, and even throw tbem off tbe track. The like 
has probably never occurred before in any country, and most assuredly 
never will again, if the present rate of large game destruction all over 
the world can be taken as a foreshadowing of the future. In this con- 
nection the following additional testimony from Colonel Dodge ( u Plains 
of the Great West," p. 121) is of interest : 

" The Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad was then [in 1871-72] in 
process of construction, and nowhere could the peculiarity of the buffalo 
of which I am speaking be better studied than from its trains. If a 
herd was on the north side of the track, it would stand stupidly gazing, 
and without a symptom of alarm, although the locomotive passed within 
a hundred yards. If on the south side of the track, even though at a 
distance of 1 or 2 miles from it, the passage of a train set the whole herd 
in the wildest commotion. At full speed, and utterly regardless of the 
consequences, it would make for the track on its line of retreat. If the 
train happened not to be in its path, it crossed the track and stopped 
satisfied. If the train was in its way, each individual buffalo went at it 
with the desperation of despair, plunging against or between locomotive 
and cars, just as its blind madness chanced to direct it. Numbers were 
killed, but numbers still pressed on, to stop and stare as soon as the 
obstacle had passed. After having trains thrown off the track twice in 
one week, conductors learned to have a very decided respect for the 
idiosyncrasies of the buffalo, aud when there was a possibility of strik- 
ing a herd e on the rampage' for the north side of the track, the trein 
was slowed up and sometimes stopped entirely." 

The accompanying illustration, reproduced from the " Plains of the 
Great West," by the kind permission of the author, is, in one sense, 
ocular proof that collisions between railway trains and vast herds of 
buffaloes were so numerous that they formed a proper subject for illus- 
tration. In regard to the stoppage of trains and derailment of locomo- 
tives by buffaloes, Colonel Dodge makes the following allusion in the 
private letter already referred to : "There are at least a hundred re- 
liable railroad men now employed on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe 
Railroad who were witnesses of, aud sometimes sufferers from, the wild 
rushes of buffalo as described on page 121 of my book. I was at the 
time stationed at Fort Dodge, and I was personally cognizant of several 
of these ' accidents.' " 

The following, from the ever pleasing pen of Mr. Catlin, is of decided 
interest in this connection : 

"In one instance, near the mouth of White River, we met the most 
immense herd crossing the Missouri River [in Dakota], and from an 
imprudence got our boat into imminent danger amongst them, from 
which we were highly delighted to make our escape. It was in the 
midst of the 'running season,' and we had heard the ' roaring' (as it is 
called) of the herd when we were several miles* from them. When

THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 393 

we came in sight, we were actually terrified at the immense numbers 
that were streaming down the green hills on one side of the river, and 
galloping up and over the bluffs on the other. The river was filled, 
and in parts blackened with their heads and horns, as they were swim- 
ming about, following up their objects, and making desperate battle 
whilst they were swimming. I deemed it imprudent for our canoe to 
be dodging amongst them, and ran it ashore for a few hours, where we 
laid, waiting for the opportunity of seeing the river clear, but we waited 
in vain. Their numbers, however, got somewhat diminished at last, 
and we pushed off, and successfully made our way amongst them. From 
the immense numbers that had passed the river at that place, they had 
torn down the prairie bank of 15 feet in height, so as to form a sort of road 
or landing place, where they all in succession clambered up. Many in 
their turmoil had been wafted below this landing, and unable to regain 
it against the swiftness of the current, had fastened themselves along 
in crowds, hugging close to the high bank under which they were 
standing. As we were drifting by these, and supposing ourselves out 
of danger, I drew up my rifle and shot one of them in the head, which 
tumbled into the water, and brought with him a hundred others, which 
plunged in, and in a moment were swimming about our canoe, and plac- 
ing it in great danger. No attack was made upon us, and in the con- 
fusion the poor beasts knew not, perhaps, the enemy that was amongst 
them; but we were liable to be sunk by them, as they were furiously 
hooking and climbing on to each other. I rose in my canoe, and by my 
gestures and hallooing kept them from coming in contact with us until 
we were out of their reach."* 

rv. Character oe the species. 

1. The buffalo's rank amongst ruminants. — With the American people, 
and through them all others, familiarity with the buffalo has bred con- 
tempt. The incredible numbers in which the animals of this species 
formerly existed made their slaughter an easy matter, so much so that 
the hunters and frontiersmen who accomplished their destruction have 
handed down to us a contemptuous opinion of the size, character, and 
general presence of our bison. And how could it be otherwise than 
that a man who could find it in his heart to murder a majestic bull bison 
for a hide worth only a dollar should form a one-dollar estimate of the 
grandest ruminant that ever trod the earth? Men who butcher African 
elephants for the sake of their ivory also entertain a similar estimate 
of their victims. 

With an acquaintance which includes fine living examples of all the 
larger ruminants of the world except the musk-ox and the European 
bison, I am sure that the American bison is the grandest of them all. 
His only rivals for the kingship are the Indian bison, or gaur (Bos gaums), 
of Southern India, and the aurochs, or European bison, both of which 

* Catliu's North American Indians, II, p. 13. 



394 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

really surpass him in height, if not in actual bulk also. The aurochs is 
taller, and possesses a larger pelvis and heavier, stronger hindquarters, 
but his body is decidedly smaller in all its proportions, which gives him 
a lean and "leggy" look. The hair on the head, neck, and forequarters 
of the aurochs is not nearly so long or luxuriant as on the same parts of 
the American bison. This covering greatly magnifies the actual bulk 
of the latter animal. Clothe the aurochs with the wonderful pelage of 
our buffalo, give him the same enormous chest and body, and the result 
would be a magnificent bovine monster, who would indeed stand with- 
out a rival. But when first-class types of the two species are placed side 
by side it seems to me that Bison americanus will easily rank his Euro- 
pean rival. 

The gaur has no long hair upon any part of his body or head. What 
little hair he has is very short and thin, his hindquarters being almost 
naked. I have seen hundreds of these animals at short range, and have 
killed and skinned several very fine specimens, one of which stood 5 feet 
10 inches in height at the shoulders. But, despite his larger bulk, his 
appearance is not nearly so striking and impressive as that of the male 
American bison. He seems like a huge ox running wild. 

The magnificent dark brown frontlet and beard of ,the buffalo, the 
shaggy coat of hair upon the neck, hump, and shoulders, terminating 
at the knees in a thick mass of luxuriant black locks, to say nothing of 
the dense coat of finer fur on the body and hindquarters, give to our 
species not only an apparent height equal to that of the gaur, but a 
grandeur and nobility of presence which are beyond all comparison 
amongst ruminants. 

The slightly larger bulk of the gaur is of little significance in a com- 
parison of the two species; for if size alone is to turn the scale, we must 
admit that a 500-pound lioness, with no mane whatever, is a more ma- 
jestic looking animal than a 450-pound lion, with a mane which has 
earned him his title of king of beasts. 

2. Change of form in captivity. — By a combination of unfortunate cir- 
cumstances, the American bison is destined to go down to posterity 
shorn of the honor which is his due, and appreciated at only half his. 
worth. The hunters who slew him were from the very beginning so 
absorbed in the scramble for spoils that they had no time to measure 
or weigh him, nor even to notice the majesty of his personal appearance 
on his native heath. 

In captivity he fails to develop as finely as in his wild state, and with 
the loss of his liberty he becomes a tame-looking animal. He gets fat 
and short-bodied, and the lack of vigorous and constant exercise pre- 
vents the development of bone and muscle which made the prairie 
animal what he was. 

From observations made upon buffaloes that have been reared in cap- 
tivity, I am firmly convinced that confinement and semi-domestication 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 395 

are destined to effect striking changes in the form of Bison americanus. 
While this is to be expected to a certain extent with most large species, 
the changes promise to be most conspicuous in the buffalo. The most 
striking change is in the body between the hips and the shoulders. As 
before remarked, it becomes astonishingly short and rotund, and through 
liberal feeding and total lack of exercise the muscles of the shoulders 
and hindquarters, especially the latter, are but feebly developed. 

The most striking example of the change of form in the captive buffalo 
is the cow in the Central Park Menagerie, New York. Although this 
animal is fully adult, and has given birth to three fine calves, she is 
small, astonishingly short-bodied, and in comparison with the magnifi- 
cently developed cows taken in 1886 by the writer in Montana, she 
seems almost like an animal of another species. 

Both the live buffaloes in the National Museum collection of living 
animals are developing the same shortness of body and lack of muscle, 
and when they attain their full growth will but poorly resemble the 
splendid proportions of the wild specimens in the Museum mounted 
group, each of which has been mounted from a most careful and elabo- 
rate series of post-mortem measurements. It may fairly be considered, 
however, that the specimens taken by the Smithsonian expedition were 
in every way more perfect representatives of the species than have been 
usually taken in times past, for the simple reason that on account of the 
muscle they had developed in the numerous chases they had survived, 
and the total absence of the fat which once formed such a prominent 
feature of the animal, they were of finer form, more active habit, and 
keener intelligence than buffaloes possessed when they were so numerous. 
Out of the millions which once composed the great northern herd, those ' 
represented the survival of the fittest, and their existence at that time 
was chiefly due to the keenness of their senses and their splendid mus- 
cular powers in speed and endurance. 

Under such conditions it is only natural that animals of the highest 
class should be developed. On the other hand, captivity reverses all 
these conditions, while yielding an equally abundant food supply. 

In no feature is the change from natural conditions to captivity more 
easily noticeable than in the eye. In the wild buffalo the eye is always 
deeply set, well protected by the edge of the bony orbit, and perfect in 
form and expression. The lids are firmly drawn around the ball, the 
opening is so small that the white portion of the eyeball is entirely cov- 
ered, and the whole form aud appearance of the organ is as shapely and 
as pleasing in expression as the eye of a deer. 

In the captive the various muscles which support and control the eye- 
ball seem to relax and thicken, aud the ball protrudes far beyond its 
normal plane, showing a circle of white all around the iris, and bulging 
out in a most uuuatural way. I do not mean to assert that this is com- 
mon in captive buffaloes generally, but I have observed it to be dis- 
agreeably conspicuous in many. 



396 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

Another change which takes place in the form of the captive buffalo 
is an arching of the back in the middle, which has a tendency to make 
the hump look lower at the shoulders and visibly alters the outline of 
the back. This tendency to "huinp up" the back is very noticeable in 
domestic cattle and horses during rainy weather. While a buffalo on 
his native heath would seldom assume such an attitude of dejection and 
misery, in captivity, especially if it be anything like close confinement, 
it is often to be observed, and I fear will eventually become a perma- 
nent habit. Indeed, I think it may be confidently predicted that the 
time will come when naturalists who have never seen a wild buffalo will 
compare the specimens composing the National Museuni group with the 
living representatives to be seen in captivity and assert that the former 
are exaggerations in both form aud size. 

3. Mounted Specimens in Museums.— Of the "stuffed" specimens to be 
^ound in museums, all that I have ever seen outside of the National Mu- 
seum, and even those within that institution up to 1886, were " stuffed" 
in reality as well as in name. The skins that have been rammed full of 
straw or excelsior have lost from 8 to 12 inches in height at the shoul- 
ders, aud the high and sharp hump of the male has become a huge, 
thick, rounded mass like the hump of a dromedary, and totally unlike 
the hump of a bison. It is impossible for any taxidermist to stuff a 
buffalo-skin with loose materials and produce a specimen which fitly 
represents the species. The proper height and form of the animal can 
be secured and retained only by the construction of a manikin, or statue, 
to carry the skin. In view of this fact, which surely must be apparent 
to even the most casual observer, it is to be earnestly hoped that here- 
after no one in authority will ever consent to mount or have mounted a 
valuable skin of a bison in any other way than over a properly con- 
structed manikin. 

4. The Calf. — The breeding season of the buffalo is from the 1st of July 
to the 1st of October. The young cow does not breed until she is three 
years old, and although two calves are sometimes produced at a birth, 
one is the usual number. The calves are born in April, May, aud June, 
aud sometimes, though rarely, as late as the middle of August. The 
calf follows its mother until it is a year old, or even older. In May, 
1886, the Smithsonian expedition captured a calf alive, which had been 
abandoned by its mother because it could not keep up with her. The 
little creature was apparently between two and three weeks old, and 
was therefore born about May 1. Unlike the young of nearly all other 
Bovidce, the buffalo calf during the first months of its existence is clad 
with hair of a totally different color from that which covers him during 
the remainder of his life. His pelage is a luxuriant growth of rather 
long, wavy hair, of a uniform brownish-yellow or "sandy" color (cinna- 
mon, or yellow ocher, with a shade of Indian yellow) all over the head, 
body, and tail, in striking contrast with the darker colors of the older 
animals. On the lower half of the leg it is lighter, shorter, and straight. 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 397 

Ou the shoulders and kuuip the hair is longer than on the other portions, 
being 1£ inches in length, more wavy, and already arranges itself in the 
tufts, or small bunches, so characteristic in the adult animal. 

On the extremity of the muzzle, including the chin, the hair is very 
short, straight, and as light in color as the lower portions of the leg. 
Starting on the top of the nose, an inch behind the nostrils, and form- 
ing a division between the light yellowish muzzle and the more reddish 
hair on the remainder of the head, there is an irregular band of dark, 
straight hair, which extends down past the corner of the mouth to a 
point just back of the chin, where it unites. From the chin backward 
the dark band increases in breadth and intensity, and continues back 
half way to the angle of the jaw. At that point begins a sort of under 
mane of wavy, dark-brown hair, nearly 3 inches long, and extends back 
along the median line of the throat to a point between the fore legs, 
where it abruptly terminates. From the back of the head another streak 
of dark hair extends backward along the top of the neck, over the hump, 
and down to the lumbar region, where it fades out entirely. These two 
dark bands are in sharp contrast to the light sandy hair adjoining. 

The tail is densely haired. The tuft on the end is quite luxuriant, 
and shows a center of darker hair. The hair on the inside of the ear 
is dark, but that on the outside is sandy. 

The naked portion of the nose is light Vandyke- brown, with a pink- 
ish tinge, and the edge of the eyelid the same. The iris is dark brown. 
The horn at three months is about 1 inch in length, and is a mere little 
black stub. In the male, the hump is clearly defined, but by no means 
so high in proportion as in the adult animal. The hump of the calf 
from which this description is drawn is of about the same relative angle 
and height as that of an adult cow buffalo. The specimen itself is well 
represented in the accompanying plate. 

The measurements of this specimen in the flesh were as follows :

The calves begin to shed their coat of red hair about the beginning 
of August. The first signs of the change, however, appear about a 
month earlier than that, in the darkening of the mane Under the throat, 
and also on the top of the neck.* 

* Our captive had, in some way, bruised the skin on his forehead, and in June all 
the Lair came off the top of his heart, leaving it quite bald. We kept the skin well 
greased with porpoise oil, and by the middle of July a lino coat of black hair had 
grown out all over the surface that had previously been bare. 



398 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887 



By the 1st of August the red hair on the body begins to fall off in 
small patches, and the growth of fine, new, dark hair seems to actually 
crowd off tbe old. As is the case with the ad nit animals, the shortest 
hair is the first to be shed, but the change of coat takes place in about 
half the time that it occupies in the older animals. 

By the 1st of October the transformation is complete, and not even 
a patch of the old red hair remains upon the new suit of brown. This 
is far from being the case with the old bulls and cows, for even up to 
the last week in October we found them with an occasional patch of 
che old hair still clinging to the new, on the back or shoulders. 

Like most young animals, the calf of the buffalo is very easily tamed, 
especially if taken when oniy a few weeks old. The one captured in 
Montana by the writer, resisted at first as stoutly as it was able, by 
butting with its head, but after we had tied its legs together and car- 
ried it to camp, across a horse, it made up its mind to yield gracefully 
to the inevitable, and from that moment became perfectly docile. It 
very soon learned to drink milk in the most satisfactory manner, and 
adapted itself to its new surroundings quite as readily as any domestic 
calf would have done. Its only cry was a low-pitched, pig-like grunt 
through the nose, which was uttered only when hungry or thirsty. 

I have been told by old frontiersmen and buffalo-hunters that it used 
to be a common practice for a hunter who had captured a young calf 
to make it follow him by placing one of his fingers in its mouth, and 
allowing the calf to suck at it for a moment. Often a calf has been 
induced in this way to follow a horseman for miles, and eventually to 
join his camp outfit. It is said that the same resn.lt has been accom- 
plished with calves by breathing a few times into their nostrils. In 
this connection Mr. Oatlin's observations on the habits of buffalo calves 
are most interesting. 

" In pursuing a large herd of buffaloes at the season when their 
calves are but a few weeks old, I have often been exceedingly amused 
with the curious maneuvers of these shy little things. Amidst the thun- 
dering confusion of a throng of several hundreds or several thousands of 
these animals, there will be many of the calves that lose sight of their 
dams ; and being left behind by the throng, and the swift-passing 
hunters, they endeavor to secrete themselves, when they are exceed- 
ingly put to it on a level prairie, where naught can be seen but the 
short grass of 6 or 8 inches in height, save an occasional bunch of wild 
sage a few inches higher, to which the poor affrighted things will run, 
and dropping on their knees, will push their noses under it and into 
the grass, where they will stand for hours, with their eyes shut, imagin- 
ing themselves securely hid, whilst they are standing up quite straight 
upon their hind feet, and can easily be seen at several miles distance. 
It is a familiar amusement with us, accustomed to these scenes, to re- 
treat back over the ground where we have just escorted the herd, and 
approach these little trembling things, which stubbornly maintain their 



Report of National Museum, 1887. — Hornaday. 



Plate IV. 




THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 399 

positions, with their noses pushed under the grass and their eyes strained 
upon us, as we dismount from our horses and are passing around them. 
From this fixed position they are sure not to move until hands are laid 
upon them, and then for the shins of a novice we can extend our sym- 
pathy ; or if he can preserve the skin on his bones from the furious but- 
tings of its head, we know how to congratulate him on his signal success 
and good luck. 

" In these desperate struggles for a moment, the little thing is con- 
quered, and makes no further resistance. And I have often, in concur- 
rence with a known custom of the country, held my hands over Ihe 
eyes of the calf and breathed a few strong breaths into its nostrils, after 
which I have, with my hunting companions, rode several miles into our 
encampment with the little prisoner busily following the heels of my 
horse the whole way, as closely and as affectionately as its instinct 
would attach it to the company of its dam. 

"This is one of the most extraordinary things that I have met with 
in the habits of this wild country, and although I had often heard of it, 
and felt unable exactly to believe it, I am now willing to bear testimony 
to the fact from the numerous instances which I have witnessed since I 
came into the country. During the time that I resided at this post 
[mouth of the Teton Jliver] in the spring of the year, on my way up the 
river, I assisted (in numerous hunts of the buffalo with the fur com- 
pany's men) in bringing in, in the above manner, several of these little 
prisoners, which sometimes followed for 5 or 6 miles close to our horse's 
heels, and even into the fur company's fort, and into the stable where 
our horses were led. In this way, before I left the headwaters of the 
Missouri, I think we had collected about a dozen, which Mr. Laidlaw 
was successfully raising with the aid of a good milch cow.* 

It must be remembered, however, that such cases as the above were 
exceptional, even with the very young calves, which alone exhibited 
the trait described. Such instances occurred only when buffaloes ex- 
isted in such countless numbers that man's presence and influence had 
not affected the character of the animal iu the least. No such instances 
of innocent stupidity will ever be displayed again, even by the youngest 
calf. The war of extermination, and the struggle for life and security 
have instilled into the calf, even from its birth, a mortal fear of both 
men and horses, and the instinct to fly for life. The calf captured by 
our party was not able to run, but in the most absurd manner it butted 
our horses as soon as they came near enough, and when Private Moran 
attempted to lay hold of the little fellow it turned upon him, struck him 
in the stomach with its head, and sent him sprawling into the sage- 
brush. If it had only possessed the strength, it would have led us a 
, lively chase. 

During 188G four other buffalo calves were either killed or caught by 
the cowboys on the Missouri- Yellowstone divide, in the Dry Creek region. 

* North American Indians, I, 255. 



400 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

All of them ran the moment they discovered their enemies. Two were 
shot and killed. One was caught by a cowboy named Horace Brodhurst, 
ear marked, and turned loose. The fifth one was caught in September 
on the Porcupine Creek round-up. He was then about five months 
old, and being abundantly able to travel he showed a clean pair of heels. 
It took three fresh horses, one after another, to catch him, and his final 
capture was due to exhaustion, and not to the speed of any of his pur- 
suers. The distance covered by the chase, from the point where his 
first pursuer started to where the third one finally lassoed him, was 
considered to be at least 15 miles. But the capture came to naught, for 
on the following day the calf died from overexertion and want of milk. 

Colonel Dodge states that the very young calves of a herd have to 
depend upon the old bulls for protection, and seldom in vain. The 
mothers abandon their offspring on slight provocation, and even none 
at all sometimes, if we may judge from the condition of the little waif 
that fell into our hands. Had its mother remained with it, or even in 
its neighborhood, we should at least have seen her, but she was nowhere 
within a radius of 5 miles at the time her calf was discovered. Nor did 
she return to look for it, as two of us proved by spending the night in 
the sage-brush at the very spot where the calf was taken. Colonel 
Dodge declares that "the cow seems to possess scarcely a trace of ma- 
ternal instinct, and, when frightened, will abandon and run away from 
her calf without the slightest hesitation. * * * When the calves 
are young they are always kept in the center of each small herd, while 
the bulls dispose themselves on the outside."* 

Apparently the maternal instinct of the cow buffalo was easily mas- 
tered by fear. That it was often manifested, however, is proven by the 
following from Audubon and Bachman :t 

a Buffalo calves are drowned from being unable to ascend the steep 
banks of the rivers across which they have just swam, as the cows can- 
not help them, although they stand near the bank, and will not leave 
them to their fate unless something alarms them. 

" On one occasion Mr. Kipp, of the American Fur Company, caught 
eleven calves, their dams all the time standing near the top of the bank. 
Frequently, however, the cows leave the young to their fate, when most 
of them perish. In connection with this part of the subject, we may add 
that we were informed, when on the Upper Missouri Biver, that when the 
banks of that river were practicable for cows, and their calves could not 
follow them, they went down again, after having gained the top, and 
would remain by them until forced away by the cravings of hunger. 
When thus forced by the necessity of saving themselves to quit their 
young, they seldom, if ever, return to them. When a large herd of 
these wild animals are crossing a river, the calves or yearlings manage, 
to get on the backs of the cows, and are thus conveyed safely over."

THE EXTEKMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 401 

5. The Yearling. — During the first five months of his life, the calf 
changes its coat completely, and becomes in appearance a totally differ- 
ent animal. By the time he is six months old he has taken on all the 
colors which distinguish him in after life, excepting that upon his fore 
quarters. The hair on the head has started out to attain the luxuriant 
length and density which is so conspicuous in the adult, and its general 
color is a rich dark brown, shading to black under the chin and throat. 
The fringe under the neck is long, straight, and black, and the under 
parts, the back of the fore-arm, the outside of thigh, and the tail-tuft 
are all black. 

The color of the shoulder, the side, and upper part of the hind quarter 
is a peculiar smoky brown ("broccoli brown" of Kidgway), having in 
connection with the darker browns of the other parts a peculiar faded 
appearance, quite as if it were due to the bleaching power of the sun. 
On the fore quarters there is none of the bright straw color so charac- 
teristic of the adult animal. Along the top of the neck and shoulders, 
however, this color has at last begun to show faintly. The hair on the 
body is quite luxuriant, both in length and density, in both respects 
quite equaliug, if not even surpassing, that of the finest adults. For 
example, the hair on the side of the mounted yearling in the Museum 
group has a length of 2 to 2£ inches, while that on the same region of 
the adult bull, whose pelage is particularly fine, is recorded as being 2 
inches only. 

The horn is a straight, conical spike from 4 to 6 inches long, accord- 
ing to age, and perfectly black. The legs are proportionally longer and 
larger in the joints than those of the full-grown animal. The counte- 
nance of the yearling is quite interesting. The sleepy, helpless, inno- 
cent expression of the very young calf has given place to a wide awake, 
mischievous look, and he seems ready to break away and run at a sec- 
oud's notice. 

The measurements of the yearling in the Museum group are as fol- 
lows:

6. The Spike Bull. — In hunters' parlance, the male buffalo between the 
"yearling" age and four years is called a "spike" bull, in recognition 
of the fact that up to the latter period the horn is a spike, either per- 
fectly straight, or with a curve near its base, and a straight point the 

H, Mis. 600, pt. 2 2G 



402 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

rest of the way up. The curve of the horn is generally hidden in the 
hair, and the only part visible is the straight, terminal spike. Usually 
the spike points diverge from each other, but often they are parallel, 
and also perpendicular. In the fourth year, however, the points of the 
horns begin to curve inward toward each other, describing equal arcs 
of the same circle, as if they were going to meet over the top of the head. 

In the handsome young " spike" bull in the Museum group, the hair 
on the shoulders has begun to take on the length, the light color, and 
tufted appearance of the adult, beginning at the highest point of tbe 
hump and gradually spreading. Immediately back of this light patch 
the hair is long, but dark and woolly in appearance. The leg tufts have 
doubled in length, and reveal the character of the growth that may be 
finally expected. The beard has greatly lengthened, as also has the 
hair upon the bridge of the nose, the forehead, ears, jaws, and all other 
portions of the head except the cheeks. 

The u spike" period of a buffalo is a most interesting one. Like a 
seventeen-year-old boy, the young bull shows his youth in so many ways 
it is always conspicuous, and his countenance is so suggestive of a half- 
bearded youth it fixes the interest to a marked degree. Be is active, 
alert, and suspicious, and when he makes up his mind to run the hunter 
may as well give up the chase. 

By a strange fatality, our spike bull appears to be the only one in any 
museum, or even in preserved existence, as far as can be ascertained. 
Out of the twenty-five buffaloes killed and preserved by the Smith- 
sonian expedition, ten of which were adult bulls, this specimen was the 
only male between the yearling and the adult ages. An effort to pro- 
cure another entire specimen of this age from Texas yielded only two 
spike heads. It is to be sincerely regretted that more specimens repre- 
senting this very interesting period of the buffalo's life have not been 
preserved, for it is now too late to procure wild specimens. 

The following are the postmortem dimensions of our specimen:

National Museum group, it is difficult to decide which feature is most 
prominent, the massive, magnificent head, with its shaggy frontlet and 
luxuriant black beard, or the lofty hump, with its showy covering of

straw-yellow hair, in thickly-growing locks 4 inches long. But the head 
is irresistible in its claims to precedence. 

It must be observed at this point that in many respects this animal 
is an exceptionally fine one. In actual size of frame, and in quantity 
and quality of pelage, it is far superior to the average, even of wild buf- 
faloes when they were most numerous and at their best.* In one re- 
spect, however, that of actual bulk, it is believed that this specimen may 
have often been surpassed. When buffaloes were numerous, and not 
required to do any great amount of running in order to exist, they were, 
in the autumn months, very fat. Audubon says : u A large bison bull 
will generally weigh nearly 2,000 pounds, and a fat cow about 1,200 
pounds. We weighed one of the bulls killed by our party, and found 
it to reach 1,727 pounds, although it had already lost a good deal of 
blood. This was an old bull, and not fat. It had probably weighed 
more at some previous period." t Our specimen when killed (by the 
writer, December 6, 1886) was in full vigor, superbly muscled, and well 
fed, but he carried not a single pound of fat. For years the never- 
ceasing race for life had utterly prevented the secretion of useless and 
cumbersome fat, and his " subsistence n had gone toward the develop- 
ment of useful muscle. Having no means by which to weigh him, we 
could only estimate his weight, in which I called for the advice of my 
cowboys, all of whom were more or less familiar with the weight of 
range cattle, and one I regarded as an expert. At first the estimated 
weight of the animal was fixed at 1,700 pounds, but with a constitu- 
tional fear of estimating over the truth, I afterward reduced it to 1,600 
pounds. This I am now well convinced was an error, for I believe the 
first figure to have been nearer the truth. 

In mounting the skin of this animal, we endeavored by every means 
in our power, foremost of which were three different sets of measure- 
ments, taken from the dead animal, one set to check another, to repro- 
duce him when mounted in exactly the same form he possessed in life — 
muscular, but not fat. 

The color of the body and hindquarters of a buffalo is very peculiar, 
and almost baffles intelligent description. Audubon calls it "between 
a dark umber and liver-shining brown." I once saw a competent artist 
experiment with his oil-colors for a quarter of an hour before he finally 
struck the combination which exactly matched the side of our large 
bull. To my eyes, the color is a pale gray-brown or smoky gray. The 
range of individual variation is considerable, some being uniformly 

* In testimony whereof the following extract from a letter written by General Stewart 
Van Vliet, on March 10, 1887, to Professor Baird, is of interest : 

" My Dear Professor : On the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant I saw Gen- 
eral Sheridan, and yesterday we called on your taxidermist and examined the buifalo 
bull he is setting up for the Museum. I don't think I have ever seen a more splendid 
specimen in my life. General Sheridan and I have seen millions of buffalo on the 
plains in former times. I have killed hundreds, but I never killed a larger animal 
than the one in the possession of your taxidermist."

404 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

darker than the average type, and others lighter. While the under parts 
of most adults are dark brown or blackish brown, others are actually 
black. The hair on the body and hinder parts is fine, wavy on the out- 
side, and woolly underneath, and very dense. Add to this the thick- 
ness of the skin itself, and the combination forms a covering that is 
almost impervious to cold. 

The entire fore-quarter region, e. g., the shoulders, the hump, and the 
upper part of the neck, is covered with a luxuriant growth of pale yel- 
low hair (Naples yellow + yellow ocher), which stands straight out in a 
dense mass, disposed in handsome tufts. The hair is somewhat woolly 
in its nature, and the ends are as even as if the whole mass had lately 
been gone over with shears and carefully clipped. This hair is 4 inches 
in iength. As the living animal moved his head from side to side, the hair 
parted in great vertical furrows, so deep that the skin itself seemed 
almost in sight. As before remarked, to comb this hair would utterly 
destroy its naturalness, and it should never be done under any circum- 
stances. Standing as it does between the darker hair of the body on 
one side and the almost black mass of the head on the other, this light 
area is rendered doubly striking and conspicuous by contrast. It not 
only covers the shoulders, but extends back upon the thorax, where 
it abruptly terminates on a line corresponding to the sixth rib. 

From the shoulder-joint downward, the color shades gradually into 
a dark brown until at the knee it becomes quite black. The huge fore- 
arm is lost in a thick mass of long, coarse, and rather straight hair 10 
inches in length. This growth stops abruptly at the knee, but it hangs 
within 6 inches of the hoof. The front side of this mass is blackish 
brown, but it rapidly shades backward and downward into jet-black. 

The hair on the top of the head lies in a dense, matted mass, forming 
a perfect crown of rich brown (burnt sienna) locks, 16 inches in length, 
hanging over the eyes, almost enveloping both horns, and spreading 
back in rich, dark masses upon the light-colored neck. 

On the cheeks the hair is of the same blackish-brown color, but com- 
paratively short, and lies in beautiful waves. On the bridge of the 
nose the hair is about 6 inches in length and stands out in a thick, uni- 
form, very curly mass, which always looks as if it had just been care- 
fully combed. 

Immediately around the nose and mouth the hair is very short, straight 
and stiff, and lies close to the skin, which leaves the nostrils and lips 
fully exposed. The front part of the chin is similarly clad, and its form 
is perfectly flat, due to the habit of the animal in feeding upon the short, 
crisp buffalo grass, in the course of which the chin is pressed flat against 
the ground. The end of the muzzle is very massive, measuring 2 feet 
2 inches in circumference just back of the nostrils. 

The hair of the chin-beard is coarse, perfectly straight, jet black, and 
11£ inches in length on our old bull. 

Occasionally a bull is met with who is a genuine Esau amongst his 
kind, I once saw a bull, of medium size but fully adult, whose hair

THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 405 

was a wonder to behold. I have now in my possession a small lock of 
hair which I plucked from his forehead, and its length is 22£ inches. 
His horns were entirely concealed by the immense mass of long uair that 
nature had piled upon his head, and his beard was as luxuriant as his 
frontlet. 

The nostril opening is large and wide. The color of the hairless por- 
tions of the nose and mouth is shiny Vandyke brown and black, with a 
strong tinge of bluish-purple, but this latter tint is not noticeable save 
upon close examination, and the eyelid is the same. The iris is of an 
irregular pear shaped outline, lf- 6 - iuches in its longest diameter, very 
dark, reddish brown in color, with a black edging all around it. Ordi- 
narily no portion of the white eyeball is visible, but the broad black 
band surrounding the iris, and a corner patch of white, is frequently 
shown by the turning of the eye. The tongue is bluish purple, as are 
the lips inside. 

The hoofs and horns are, in reality, jet black throughout, but the 
horn often has at the base a scaly, dead appearance on the outside, and 
as the wrinkles around the base increase with age aud scale up and 
gather dirt, that part looks gray. The horns of bulls taken in their 
prime are smooth, glossy black, and even look as if they had been half 
polished with oil. 

As the bull increases in age, the outer layers of the horn begin to 
break off at the tip and pile up one upon another, until the horn has be- 
come a thick, blunt stub, with only the tip of what was once a neat and 
shapely point showing at the end. The bull is then known as a " stub- 
horn," and his horns increase in roughness and unsightliness as he 
grows older. From long rubbing on the earth, the outer curve of each 
horn is gradually worn flat, which still further mars its symmetry. 

The horns serve as a fair index of the age of a bison. After he is 
three years old, the bison adds each year a ring around the base of his 
horns, the same as domestic cattle. If we may judge by this, the horn 
begins to break when the bison is about ten or eleven years old, and the 
stubbing process gradually continues during the rest of his life. Judg- 
ing by the teeth, and also the oldest horns I have seen, I am of the 
opinion that the natural life time of the bison is about twenty-five years; 
certainly no less.

8. The Cow in the third year. — The young cow of course possesses the 
same youthful appearance already referred to as characterizing the 
" spike" bull. The hair on the shoulders has begun to take on the light 
straw-color, and has by this time attained a length which causes it to 
arrange itself in tufts, or locks. The body colors have grown darker, 
and reached their permanent tone. Of course the hair on the head has 
by no means attained its full length, and the head is not at all hand- 
some. 

The horns are quite small, but the curve is well defined, and they 
distinctly mark the sex of the individual, even at the beginning of the 
third year.

9. The adult Cow. — The upper body color of the adult cow in the Na- 
tional Museum group (see Plate) is a rich, though not intense, Van- 
dyke brown, shading imperceptibly down the sides into black, which 
spreads over the entire under parts and inside of the thighs. The hair 
on the lower joints of the leg is in turn lighter, being about the same 
shade as that on the loins. The fore arm is concealed in a mass of 
almost black hair, which gradually shades lighter from the elbow up- 
ward and along the whole region of the humerus. On the shoulder 
itself the hair is pale yellow or straw-color (Naples yellow-f yellow 
ocher), which extends down in a point toward the elbow. From the 
back of the head a conspicuous baud of curly, dark-brown hair extends 
back like a mane along the neck and to the top of the hump, beyond 
which it soon fades out. 

The hair on the head is everywhere a rich burnt-sienna brown, ex- 
cept around the corners of the mouth, where it shades into black. 

The horns of the cow bison are slender, but solid for about two-thirds 
of their length from the tip, ringed with age near their base, and quite 
black. Very often they are imperfect in shape, and out of every five 
pairs at least one is generally misshapen. Usually one horn is "crum- 
pled," e. g., dwarfed in length and unnaturally thickened at the base, 
and very often one horn is found to be merely an unsightly, misshapen 
stub. 

The udder of the cow bison is very small, as might be expected of 
an auimal which must do a great deal of hard traveling, but the milk 
is said to bo very rich. Some authorities declare that it requires the

milk of two domestic cows to satisfy one buffalo calf, but this, I think, 
is an error. Our calf began in May to consume 6 quarts of domestic 
milk daily, which by June 10 had increased to 8, and up to July 10, 9 
quarts was the utmost it could drink. By that time it began to eat 
grass, but the quantity of milk disposed of remained about the same.

10. The "Wood," or "Mountain" Buffalo. — Having myself never seen 
a specimen of the so called "mountain buffalo" or "wood buffalo," 
which some writers accord the rank of a distinct variety, I can only 
quote the descriptions of others. While most Rocky Mountain hunt- 
ers consider the bison of the mountains quite distinct from that of 
the plains, it must be remarked that no two authorities quite agree in 
regard to the distinguishing characters of the variety they recognize. 
Colonel Dodge states that " His body is lighter, whilst his legs are 
shorter, but much thicker and stronger, than the plains animal, thus 
enabling him to perform feats of climbing and tumbling almost incred 
ible in such a huge and unwieldy beast." * 

The belief in the existence of a distinct mountain variety is quite 
commou amongst hunters and frontiersmen all along the eastern slope 
the Rocky Mountains as far north as the Peace River. In this con- 
nection the following from Professor Henry Youle Hindt is of general 
interest : 

"The existence of two kinds of buffalo is firmly believed by many 
hunters at Red River; they are stated to be the prairie buffalo and the 
buffalo of the woods. Many old hunters with whom I have conversed 
ou this subject aver that the so-called wood buffalo is a distinct species, 
and although they are not able to offer scientific proofs, yet the differ- 
ence in size, color, hair, and horns, are enumerated as the evidence 
upon which they base their statement. Men from their youth familiar 
with these animals in the great plains, and the varieties which are fre- 
quently met with in large herds, still cling to this opinion. The buffalo 
of the plains are not always of the dark and rich bright brown which 
forms their characteristic color. They are sometimes seen from white 
to almost black, and a gray buffalo is not at all uncommon. Buffalo

408 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 188?. 

emasculated by wolves are often found on the prairies, where they grow 
to an immense size; the skin of the buffalo ox is recognized by the 
shortness of the wool and by its large dimensions. The skin of the so- 
called wood buffalo is much larger than that of the common animal, the 
the hair is very short, mane or hair about the neck short and soft, and 
altogether destitute of curl, which is the common feature in the hair or 
wool of the prairie animal. Two skins of the so-called wood buffalo, 
which I saw at Selkirk Settlement, bore a very close resemblance to the 
skin of the Lithuanian bison, judging from the specimens of that species 
which I have since had an opportunity of seeing in the British Museum. 

" The wood buffalo is stated to be very scarce, and only found north 
of the Saskatchewan and on the flanks of the Eocky Mountains. It 
never ventures into the open plains. The prairie buffalo, on the con- 
trary, generally avoids the woods in summer and keeps to the open 
country; but in winter they are frequently found in the woods of the 
Little Souris, Saskatchewan, the Touchwood Hills, and the aspen 
groves on the Qu'Appelle. There is no doubt that formerly the prairie 
buffalo ranged through open woods almost as much as he now does 
through the prairies." 

Mr. Harrison S Young, an officer of the Hudson's Bay Fur Company, 
stationed at Fort Edmonton, writes me as follows in a letter dated Oc- 
tober 22, 1887 : " In our district of Athabasca, along the Salt River, 
there are still a few wood buffalo killed every year ; but they are fast 
diminishing in numbers, and are also becoming very shy." 

In Prof. John Macoun's "Manitoba and the Great Northwest," page 
342, there occurs the following reference to the wood buffalo: "In the 
winter of 1870 the last buffalo were killed north of Peace River ; but in 
3875 about one thousand head were still in existence between the A th- 
abasca and Peace Rivers, north of Little Slave Lake. These are called 
wood buffalo by the hunters, but differ only in size from those of the 
plain." 

In the absence of facts based on personal observations, I may be 
permitted to advance an opinion in regard to the wood buffalo. 
There is some reason for the belief that certain changes of form may 
have taken place in the buffaloes that have taken up a permanent resi- 
dence in rugged and precipitous mountain regions. Indeed, it is hardly 
possible to understand how such a radical change in the habitat of an 
animal could fail, through successive generations, to effect certain 
changes in the animal itself. It seems to me that the changes which 
would take place in a band of plains buffaloes transferred to a perma- 
nent mountain habitat can be forecast with a marked degree of cer- 
tainty. The changes that take place under such conditions in cattle, 
swine, and goats are well known, and similar causes would certainly 
produce similar results in the buffalo. 

The scantier feed of the mountains, and the great waste of vital 
energy called for in procuring it, would hardly produce a larger buffalo

than the plains-fed animal, who acquires an abundance of daily food of 
the best quality with but little effort. 

We should expect to see the mountain buffalo smaller in body than 
the plains animal, with better leg development, and particularly with 
stronger hind quarters. The pelvis of the plains buffalo is surprisingly 
small and weak for so large an animal. Beyond question, constant 
mountain climbing is bound to develop a maximum of useful muscle 
and bone and a minimum of useless fat. If the loss of mane sustained 
by the African lions who live in bushy localities may be taken as an 
index, we should expect the bison of the mountains, especially the 
u wood buffalo," to lose a great deal of his shaggy frontlet and mane on 
the bushes and trees which surrounded him. Therefore, we would natu- 
rally expect to find the hair on those parts shorter and in far less per- 
fect condition than on the bison of the treeless prairies. By reason of 
the more shaded condition of his home, and the decided mitigation of 
the sun's fierceness, we should also expect to see his entire pelage of a 
darker tone. That he would acquire a degree of agility and strength 
unknown in his relative of the plain is reasonably certain. In the 
course of many centuries the change in his form might become well de- 
fined, constant, and conspicuous 5 but at present there is apparently 
not the slightest ground for considering that the "mountain buffalo" or 
11 wood buffalo" is entitled to rank even as a variety of Bison america- 
nuso 

Colonel Dodge has recorded some very interesting information in 
regard to the " mountain, or wood buffalo," which deserves to be quoted 
entire.* 

" In various portions of the Eocky Mountains, especially in the region 
of the parks, is found an animal which old mountaineers call the l bison.' 
This animal bears about the same relation to a plains buffalo as a 
sturdy mountain pony does to an American horse. His body is lighter, 
whilst his legs are shorter, but much thicker and stronger, than the 
plains animal, thus enabling him to perform feats of climbing and 
tumbling almost incredible in such a huge and apparently unwieldy 
beast. 

" These animals are by no means plentiful, and are moreover excess- 
ively shy, inhabiting the deepest, darkest defiles, or the craggy, almost 
precipitous, sides of mountains inaccessible to any but the most prac- 
ticed mountaineers. 

M From the tops of the mountains which rim the parks the rains of 
ages have cut deep gorges, which plunge with brusque abruptness, but 
nevertheless with great regularity, huudreds or even thousands of feet 
to the valley below. Down the bottom of each such gorge a clear, cold 
stream of purest water, fertilizing a narrow belt of a few feet of allu- 
vial, and giving birth and growth to a dense jungle of spruce, quaking 
asp, and other mountain trees. One side of the gorge is generally a 

* Plains of the Great West, p. 144-147. 



410 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

thick forest of pine, while the other side is a meadow-like park, covered 
with splendid grass. Such gorges are the favorite haunt of the mount- 
ain buffalo. Early in the morning he enjoys a bountiful breakfast of 
the rich nutritious grasses, quenches his thirst with the finest water, 
and, retiring just within the line of jungle, where, himself unseen, he 
can scan the open, he crouches himself in the long grass and reposes 
in comfort and security until appetite calls him to his dinner late in the 
evening. Unlike their plains relative, there is no stupid staring at an 
intruder. At the first symptom of danger they disappear like magic 
in the thicket, and never stop until far removed from even the appre- 
hension of pursuit. I have many times come upon their fresh tracks, 
upon the beds from which they had first sprung in alarm, but I have 
never even seen one. 

" I have wasted much time and a great deal of wind in vain endeav- 
ors to add one of these animals to my bag. My figure is no longer 
adapted to mountain climbing, and the possession of a bison's head of 
my own killing is one of my blighted hopes. 

" Several of my friends have been more fortunate, but I know of no 
sportsman who has bagged more than one.* 

" Old mountaineers and trappers have given me wonderful accounts 
of the number of these animals in all the mountain region ' many years 
ago;' and I have been informed by them that their present rarity is 
due to the great snow-storm of 1844-'45, of which I have already spoken 
as destroying the plains buffalo in the Laramie country. 

" One of my friends, a most ardent and pertinacious sportsman, de- 
termined on the possession of a bison's head, and, hiring a guide, 
plunged into the mountain wilds which separate the Middle from South 
Park. After several days fresh tracks were discovered. Turning their 
horses loose on a little gorge park, such as described, they started on 
foot on the trail ; for all that day they toiled and scrambled with the 
utmost caution — now up, now down, through deep and narrow gorges 
and pine thickets, over bare and rocky crags, sleeping where night over- 
took them. Betimes next morning they pushed on the trail, and about 
11 o'clock, when both were exhausted and well nigh disheartened, their 
route was intercepted by a precipice. Looking over, they descried, on a 
projecting ledge several hundred feet below, a herd of about 20 bisons 
lying down. The ledge was about 300 feet at widest, by probably 1,000 
feet long. Its inner boundary was the wall of rock on the top of which 
they stood ; its outer appeared to be a sheer precipice of at least 200 
feet. This ledge was connected with the slope of the mountain by a 
narrow neck. The wind being right, the hunters succeeded in reaching 
this neck unobserved. My friend selected a magnificent head, that of a 

'Foot-note by William Blackmore : " The author is in error here, as in a point of the 
Tarryall range of mountains, between Pike's Peak and the South Park, in the autumn 
of 1871, two mountain buffaloes were killed in one afternoon. The skin of the finer 
was presented.' to Dr. Frank Buckland."

fine bull, young but full grown, aud both fired. At the report the 
bisons all ran to the far end of the ledge and plunged over. 

"Terribly disappointed, the hunters ran to the spot, and found that 
they had gone down a declivity, not actually a precipice, but so steep 
that the hunters could not follow them. 

"At the foot lay a bison. A long, a fatiguing detour brought them to 
the spot, and in the animal lying dead before him my friend recognized 
his bull— his first and last mountain buffalo. None but a true sports- 
man can appreciate his feelings. 

"The remainder of the herd was never seen after the great plunge, 
down which it is doubtful if even a dog could have followed unharmed." 

In the issue of Forest and Stream of June 14, 1888, Dr. E. W. Shu- 
feldt, in an article entitled "The American Buffalo," relates a very in- 
teresting experience with buffaloes which were pronounced to be of the 
"mountain" variety, and his observations on the animals are well worth 
reproducing here. The animals (eight in number) were encountered on 
the northern slope of the Big Horn Mountains, in the autumn of 1877. 
" We came upon them during a fearful blizzard of heavy hail, during 
which our animals could scarcely retain their feet. In fact, the packer's 
mule absolutely lay down on the ground rather than risk being blown 
down the mountain side, and my own horse, totally unable to face such 
a violent blow and the pelting hail (the stones being as large as big 
marbles), positively stood stock-still, facing an old buffalo bull that was 
not more than 25 feet in front of me. * * * Strange to say, this 
fearful gust did not last more than ten minutes, when it stopped as 
suddenly as it had commenced, and I deliberately killed my old buffalo 
at one shot, just where he stood, and, separating two other bulls from 
the rest, charged them down a rugged ravine. They passed over this 
and into another one, but with less precipitous sides and no trees in the 
way, and when I was on top of the intervening ridge I noticed that 
the largest bull had halted in the bottom. Checking my horse, an ex- 
cellent buffalo hunter, I fired down at him without dismounting. The 
ball merely barked his shoulder, and to my infinite surprise he turned 
and charged me up the hill. * * * Stepping to one side of my 
horse, with the charging and infuriated bull not 10 feet to my front, I 
fired upon him, and the heavy ball took him square in the chest, bring- 
ing him to his knees, with a gush of scarlet blood from his mouth and 
nostrils. * * * 

" Upon examining the specimen, I found it to be an old bull, appar- 
ently smaller aud very much blacker than the ones I had seen killed on 
the plains only a day or so before. Then I examined the first one I had 
shot, as well as others which were killed by the packer from the same 
bunch, and I came to the conclusion that they were typical representa- 
tives of the variety known as the ' mountain buffalo,' a form much more 
active in movement, of slighter limbs, blacker, and far more dangerous

all this I may be mistaken, bnt it was also the opinion held by the old 
buffalo hunter who accompanied me, and who at once remarked when 
he saw them that they were ' mountain buffalo,' and not the plains 
variety. * * * 

" These specimens were not actually measured by me in either case, 
and tbeir being considered smaller only rested upon my judging them 
by my eye. But they were of a softer pelage, black, lighter in limb, and 
when discovered were in the timber, on the side of the Big Horn Mount- 
ains." 

The band of bison in the Yellowstone Park must, of necessity, be of 
the so-called kt wood" or " mountain" variety, and if by any chance one 
of its members ever dies of old age, it is to be hoped its skin may be 
carefully preserved and sent to the National Museum to throw some 
further light on this question. 

11. The shedding of the winter pelage. — In personal appearance the 
buffalo is subject to striking, aud even painful, variations, and the esti- 
mate an observer forms of him is very apt to depend upon the time of 
the year at which the observation is made. Toward the end of the winter 
the whole coat has become faded and bleached by the action of the sun, 
wind, snow, and rain, until the freshness of its late autumn colors has 
totally disappeared. The bison takes on a seedy, weathered, and rusty 
look. But this is not a circumstance to what happens to him a little 
later. Promptly with the coming of the spring, if not even in the last 
week of February, the buffalo begins the shedding of his winter coat. 
It is a long and difficult task, and with commendable energy he sets 
about it at the earliest possible moment. It lasts him more than half 
the year, and is attended with many positive discomforts. 

The process of shedding is accomplished in two ways : by the new 
hair growing into and forcing off the old, and by the old hair falling off 
in great patches, leaving the skin bare. On the heavily-haired por- 
tions — the head, neck, fore quarters, and hump— the old hair stops 
growing, dies, and the new hair immediately starts through the skin 
and forces it off. The new hair grows so rapidly, and at the same time 
so densely, that it forces itself into the old, becomes hopelessly entan- 
gled with it, and in time actually lifts the old hair clear of the skin. On 
the head the new hair is dark brown or black, but on the neck, fore 
quarters, and hump it has at first, and indeed until it is 2 inches in 
length, a peculiar gray or drab color, mixed with brown, totally differ- 
ent from its final and natural color. The new hair starts first on the 
head, but the actual shedding of the old hair is to be seen first along the 
lower parts of the neck and between the fore legs. The heavily-haired 
parts are never bare, but, on the contrary, the amount of hair upon them 
is about the same all the year round. The old and the new hair cling 
together with provoking tenacity long after the old coat should fall, 
and on several of the bulls we killed in October there were patches of it 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 413 

still sticking tightly to the shoulders, from which it had to be forcibly- 
plucked away. Under all such patches the new hair was of a different 
color from that around them. 

The other process of shedding takes place on the body and hind 
quarters, from which the old hair loosens and drops off in great woolly 
flakes a foot square, more or less. The shedding takes place very un- 
evenly, the old hair remaining much longer in some places than in 
others. During April, May, and June the body and hind quarters pre- 
sent a most ludicrous and even pitiful spectacle. The island-like patches 
of persistent old hair alternating with patches of bare brown skin are 
adorned (?) by great ragged streamers of loose hair, which flutter in 
the wind like signals of distress. Whoever sees a bison at this period 
is filled with a desire to assist nature by plucking off the flying stream- 
ers of old hair ; but the bison never permits anything of the kind, how- 
ever good one's intentions may be. All efforts to dislodge the old hair 
are resisted to the last extremity, and the buffalo generally acts as if 
the intention were to deprive him of his skin itself. By the end of 
June, if not before, the body and hind quarters are free from the old 
hair, and as bare as the hide of a hippopotamus. The naked skin has 
a shiny brown appearance, and of course the external anatomy of the 
animal is very distinctly revealed. But for the long hair on the fore 
quarters, neck, and head the bison would lose all his dignity of ap- 
pearance with his hair. As it is, the handsome black head, which is 
black with new hair as early as the first of May, redeems the animal 
from utter homeliness. 

After the shedding of the body hair, the naked skin of the buffalo is 
burned by the sun and bitten by flies until he is compelled to seek a 
pool of water, or even a bed of soft mud, in which to roll and make him- 
self comfortable. He wallows, not so much because he is so fond of 
either water or mud, but in self-defense ; and when he emerges from his 
wallow, plastered with mud from head to tail, his degradation is com- 
plete. He is then simply not fit to be seen, even by his best friends. 

By the first of October, a complete and wonderful transformation has 
taken place. The buffalo stauds forth clothed in a complete new suit 
of hair, fine, clean, sleek, and bright in color, not a speck of dirt nor a 
lock awry anywhere. To be sure, it is as yet a trifle short on the body, 
where it is not over an inch in length, and hardly that; but it is grow- 
ing rapidly and getting ready for winter. 

From the 20th of November to the 20th of December the pelage is at 
its very finest. By the former date it has attained its full growth, its 
colors are at their brightest, and nothing has been lost either by the 
elements or by accidental causes. To him who sees an adult bull at 
this period, or near it, the grandeur of the animal is irresistibly felt. 
After seeing buffaloes of all ages in the spring and summer mouths the 
contrast afforded by those seen in October, November, and December 
was most striking and impressive. In the later period, as different in-

dividuals were wounded and brought to bay at close quarters, their 
hair was so clean and well-kept, that more than once I was led to ex- 
claim : " He looks as if he had just been combed." 

It must be remarked, however, that the long hair of the head and 
fore quarters is disposed in locks or tufts, and to comb it in reality 
would utterly destroy its natural and characteristic appearance. 

Inasmuch as the pelage of the domesticated bison, the only represen- 
tatives of the species which will be found alive ten years hence, will in 
all likelihood develop differently from that of the wild animal, it may 
some time in the future be of interest to know the length, by careful 
measurement, of the hair found on carefully-selected typical wild speci- 
mens. To this end the following measurements are given. It must be 
borne in mind that these specimens were not chosen because their 
pelage was particularly luxuriant, but rather because they are fine 
average specimens. 

The hair of the adult bull is by no means as long as I have seen on a 
bison, although perhaps not many have greatly surpassed it. It is 
with the lower animals as with man — the length of the hairy covering 
is an individual character only. I have in my possession a tuft of hair, 
from the frontlet of a rather small bull bison, which measures 22£ inches 
in length. The beard on the specimen from which this came was cor- 
respondingly long, and the entire pelage was of wonderful length and 
density.

Albinism. — Cases of albinism in the buffalo were of extremely rare 
occurrence. I have met many old buffalo hunters, who had killed thou- 
sands and seen scores of thousands of buffaloes, yet never had seen a 
white one. From all accounts it appears that not over ten or eleven 
white buffaloes, or white buffalo skins, were ever seen by white men. 
Pied individuals were occasionally obtained, but even they were rare. 
Albino buffaloes were always so highly prized that not a single one, so 
far as I can learn, ever had the good fortune to attain adult size, their 
appearance being so striking, in contrast with the other members of 
the herd, as to draw upon them an unusual number of enemies, and 
cause their speedy destruction. 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 415 

At the New Orleans Exposition, in 1884-'85, the Territory of Dakota 
exhibited, amongst other Western quadrupeds, the mounted skin of a 
two-year-old buffalo which might fairly be called an albino. Although 
not really white, it was of a uniform dirty cream-color, and showed not 
a trace of the bison's normal color on any part of its body. 

Lieut. Col. S. C. Kellogg, U. S. Army, has on deposit in the National 
Museum a tanned skin which is said to have come from a buffalo. It 
is from an animal about one year old, and the hair upon it, which is 
short, very curly or wavy, and rather coarse, is pure white. In length 
and texture the hair does not in any one respect resemble the hair of 
a yearling buffalo save in one particular, — along the median line of the 
neck and hump there is a rather long, thin mane of hair, which has the 
peculiar woolly appearance of genuine buffalo hair on those parts. On 
the shoulder portions of the skin the hair is as short as on the hind 
quarters. I am incliued to believe this rather remarkable specimen 
came from a wild half-breed calf, the result of a cross between a white 
domestic cow and a buffalo bull. At one time it was by no means un- 
common for small bunches of domestic cattle to enter herds of buffalo 
and remain there permanently. 

I have been informed that the late General Marcy possessed a white 
buffalo skin. If it is still in existence, and is really white, it is to be 
hoped that so great a rarity may find a permanent abiding place in 
some museum where the remains of Bison amerlcanus are properly ap- 
preciated. 

V. The Habits of the Buffalo. 

The history of the buffalo's daily life and habits should begin with 
the "running season." This period occupied the months of August 
and September, and was characterized by a degree of excitement and 
activity throughout the entire herd quite foreign to the ease-loving and 
even slothful nature which was so noticable a feature of the bison's 
character at all other times. 

The mating season occurred when the herd was on its summer range. 
The spring calves were from two to four months old. Through con- 
tinued feasting on the new crop of buffalo-grass and bunch-grass — the 
most nutritious in the world, perhaps — every buffalo in the herd had 
grown round-sided, fat, and vigorous. The faded and weather beaten 
suit of winter hair had by that time fallen off and given place to the 
new coat of dark gray and black, and, excepting for the shortness of 
his hair, the buffalo was in prime condition. 

During the " running season," as it was called by the plainsmen, 
the whole nature of the herd was completely changed. * Instead of 
being broken up into countless small groups and dispersed over a vast 
extent of territory, the herd came together in a dense and confused 
mass of many thousand individuals, so closely congregated as to actu- 
ally blacken the face of the landscape. As if by a general and irre- 



416 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

sistible impulse, every straggler would be drawn to the common center, 
and lor miles on every side of the great herd the country would be 
found entirely deserted. 

At this time the herd itself became a seething mass of activity and 
excitement. As usual under such conditions, the bulls were half the 
time chasing the cows, and fighting each other during the other half. 
These actual combats, which were always of short duration and over in 
a few seconds after the actual collision took place, were preceded by 
the usual threatening demonstrations, in which the bull lowers his head 
until his nose almost touches the ground, roars like a fog-horn until the 
earth seems to fairly tremble with the vibration, glares madly upon his 
adversary with half-white eyeballs, and with his forefeet paws up the 
dry earth and throws it upward in a great cloud of dust high above his 
back. At such times the mingled roaring — it can not truthfully be de- 
scribed as lowing or bellowing — of a number of huge bulls unite and 
form a great volume of sound like distant thunder, which has often been 
heard at a distance of from 1 to 3 miles. I have even been assured by 
old plainsmen that under favorable atmospheric conditions such sounds 
have been heard five miles. 

Notwithstanding the extreme frequency of combats between the bulls 
during this season, their results were nearly always harmless, thanks 
to the thickness of the hair and hide on the head and' shoulders, and the 
strength of the neck. 

Under no conditions was there ever any such thing as the pairing off 
or mating of male and female buffaloes for any length of time. In the 
entire process of reproduction the bison's habits were similar to those 
of domestic cattle. For years the opinion was held by many, in some 
cases based on misinterpreted observations, that in the herd the identity 
of each family was partially preserved, and that each old bull main- 
tained an individual harem and group of progeny of his own. The 
observations of Colonel Dodge completely disprove this very interest- 
ing theory ; for at best it was only a picturesque fancy, ascribing to 
the bison a degree of intelligence which be never possessed. 

At the close of the breeding season the herd quickly settles down to 
its normal condition. The mass gradually resolves itself into the 
numerous bands or herdlets of from twenty to a hundred individuals, 
so characteristic of bison on their feeding grounds, and these gradually 
scatter in search of the best grass until the herd covers many square 
miles of country. 

In his search for grass the buffalo displayed but little intelligence or 
power of original thought. Instead of closely following the divides be- 
tween water-courses where the soil was best and grass most abundant, 
he would not hesitate to wander away from good feeding-grounds into 
barren " bad lauds," cohered with sage-brush, where the grass was very 
thin and very poor. In such broken country as Montana, Wyoming, 
and southwestern Dakota, the herds, on reaching the best grazing 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 417 

grounds on the divides, would graze there day after day until increas- 
ing thirst compelled them to seek for water. Then, actuated by a 
common impulse, the search for a water-hole was begun in a business- 
like way. The leader of a herd, or " bunch," which post was usually 
filled by an old cow, would start off down the nearest "draw," or stream- 
heading, and all the rest would fall into line and follow her. From the 
moment this start was made there was no more feeding, save as a mouth- 
ful of grass could be snatched now and then without turning aside. In 
single file, in a line sometimes half a mile long and containing between 
one and two hundred buffaloes, the procession slowly marched down the 
coulee, close alongside the gully as soon as the water-course began to 
cut a pathway for itself. When the gully curved to right or left the 
leader would cross its bed and keep straight on until the narrow ditch 
completed its wayward curve and came back to the middle of the cou- 
le'e. The trail of a herd in search of water is usually as good a piece of 
engineering as could be executed by the best railway surveyor, and is 
governed by precisely the same principles. It always follows the level 
of the valley, swerves around the high points, and crosses the stream 
repeatedly in order to avoid climbing up from the level. The same 
trail is used again and again by different herds until the narrow path, 
not over a foot in width, is gradually cut straight down into the soil to 
a depth of several inches, as if it had been done by a 12-inch grooving- 
plane. By the time the trail has been worn down to a depth of 6 or 7 
inches, without having its width increased in the least, it is no longer a 
pleasant path to walk in, being too much like a narrow ditch. Then 
the buffaloes abandon it and strike out a new one alongside, which is 
used until it also is worn down and abandoned. 

To-day the old buffalo trails are conspicuous among the very few 
classes of objects which remain as a reminder of a vanished race. The 
herds of cattle now follow them in single file just as the buffaloes did a 
few years ago, as they search for water in the same way. In some parts 
of the West, in certain situations, old buffalo trails exist which the wild 
herds wore down to a depth of 2 feet or more. 

Mile after mile marched the herd, straight down-stream, bound for 
the upper water-hole. As the hot summer drew on, the pools would 
dry up one by one, those nearest the source being the first to disap- 
pear. Toward the latter part of summer, the journey for water was 
often a long one. Hole after hole would be passed without finding a. 
drop of water. At last a hole of mud would be found, below that a 
hole with a little muddy water, and a mile farther on the leader would 
arrive at a shallow pool under the edge of a u cut bank," a white, snow- 
like deposit of alkali on the sand encircling its margin, and incrusting 
the blades of grass and rushes that grew up from the bottom. The 
damp earth around the pool was cut up by a thousand hoof-prints, and 
the water was warm, strongly impregnated with alkali, and yellow with 
animal impurities, but it was tvater. The nauseous mixture was quickly

418 REPOET OP NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

surrounded by a throng of thirsty, heated, and eager buffaloes of all ages, 
to which the oldest and strongest asserted claims of priority. There 
was much crowding and some fighting, but eventually all were satis- 
fied. After such a long journey to water, a herd would usually remain 
by it for some hours, lying down, resting, and drinking at intervals 
until completely satisfied. 

Having drunk its fill, the herd would never march directly back to 
the choice feeding grounds it had just left, but instead would leisurely 
stroll off at a right angle from the course it came, cropping for awhile 
the rich bunch grasses of the bottom-lands, and then wauder across the 
hills in an almost aimless search for fresh fields and pastures new. 
When buffaloes remained long in a certain locality it was a common 
thing for them to visit the same watering-place a number of times, at 
intervals of greater or less duration, according to circumstances. " 

When undisturbed on his chosen range, the bison used to be fond of 
lying down for an hour or two in the middle of the day, particularly 
when fine weather and good grass combined to encourage him in lux- 
urious habits. I once discovered with the field-glass a small herd of 
buffaloes lying down at midday on the slope of a high ridge, and hav- 
ing ridden hard for several hours we seized the opportunity to unsaddle 
and give our horses an hour's rest before making the attack. While we 
were so doing, the herd got up, shifted its position to the opposite side 
of the ridge, and again laid down, every buffalo with his nose pointing 
to windward. 

Old hunters declare that in the days of their abundance, when feed- 
ing on their ranges in fancied security, the younger animals were as 
playful as well-fed domestic calves. It was a common thing to see 
them cavort and frisk around with about as much grace as young ele- 
phants, prancing and running to and fro with tails held high in air "like 
scorpions." 

Buffaloes are very fond of rolling in dry dirt or even in" mud, and this 
habit is quite strong in captive animals. Not only is it indulged in 
during the shedding season, but all through the fall and winter. The 
two live buffaloes in the National Museum are so much given to rolling, 
even in rainy weather, that it is necessary to card them every few days 
to keep them presentable. 

Bulls are much more given to rolling than the cows, especially after 
they have reached maturity. They stretch out at full length, rub their 
heads violently to and fro on the ground, in which the horn serves as 
the chief point of contact and slides over the ground like a sled-run- 
ner. After thoroughly scratching one side on mother earth they roll 
over and treat the other in like manner. Notwithstanding his sharp 
and lofty hump, a buffalo bull can roll completely over with as much 
ease as any horse. 

The vast amount of rolling and side-scratchirrg on the earth iudulged 
in by bull buffaloes is shown in the worn condition of the horns of

every old specimen. Often a thickness of half an inch is gone from 
the upper half of each horn on its outside curve, at which point the 
horn is worn quite flat. This is well illustrated in the horns shown in 
the accompanying plate, fig. 6. 

Mr. Catlin* affords some very interesting and valuable information 
in regard to the bison's propensity for wollowing in mud, and also the 
origin of the " fairy circles," which have caused so much speculation 
amongst travelers : 

" In the heat of summer, these huge animals, which no doubt suffer 
very much with the great profusion of their long and shaggy hair, or 
fur, often graze on the low grounds of the prairies, where there is a 
little stagnant water lying amongst the grass, and the ground under- 
neath being saturated with it, is soft, into which the enormous built 
lowered down upon one knee, will plunge his horns, and at last his 
head, driving up the earth, and soon making an excavation in the 
ground into which the water filters from amongst the grass, formiug for 
him in a few moments a cool and comfortable bath, into which he 
plunges like a hog in his mire. 

" In this delectable laver he throws himself flat upon his side, and 
forcing himself violently around, with his horns and his huge hump on 
his shoulders presented to the sides, he ploughs up the ground by his 
rotary motion, sinking himself deeper and deeper in the ground, con- 
tinually enlarging his pool, in which he at length becomes nearly im- 
mersed, and the water and mud about him mixed into a complete 
mortar, which changes his color and drips in streams from every part 
of him as he rises up upon his feet, a hideous monster of mud and 
ugliness, too frightful and too eccentric to be described ! 

"It is generally the leader of the herd that takes upon him to make 
this excavation, and if not (but another one opens the ground), the 
leader (who is conqueror) marches forward, and driving the other from it 
plunges himself into it; and, having cooled his sides and changed his 
color to a walking mass of mud and mortar, he stands in the pool until 
inclination induces him to step out and give place to the next in com- 
mand who stands ready, and another, and another, who advance for- 
ward in their turns to enjoy the luxury of the wallow, until the whole 
baud (sometimes a hundred or more) will pass through it in turn,t each 
one throwing his body around in a similar manner and each one adding 
a little to the dimensions of the pool, while he carries away in his hair 
an equal share of the clay, which dries to a gray or whitish color and 
gradually falls off. By this operation, which is done perhaps in the 
space of half an hour, a circular excavation of fifteen or twenty feet in 
diameter and two feet in depth is completed and left for the water to 
run into, which soon fills it to the level of the ground.

tl To these sinks, the waters lying on the surface of the prairies are 
continually draining and in them lodging their vegetable deposits, which 
after a lapse of years fill them up to the surface with a rich soil, which 
throws up an unusual growth of grass and herbage, forming conspicu- 
ous circles, which arrest the eye of the traveler and are calculated to 
excite his surprise for ages to come." 

During the latter part of the last century, when the bison inhabited 
Kentucky and Pennsylvania, the salt springs of those States were re- 
sorted to by thousands of those animals, who drank of the saline waters 
and licked the impregnated earth. Mr. Thomas Ashe* affords us a 
most interesting account, from the testimony of an eye-witness, of the 
behavior of a bison at a salt spring. The description refers to a locality 
in western Pennsylvania, where " an old man, one of the first settlers 
of this country, built his log house on the immediate borders of a salt 
spring. He informed me that for the first several seasons the buffaloes 
paid him their visits with the utmost regularity ; they traveled in sin- 
gle files, always following each other at equal distances, forming droves, 
on their arrival, of about 300 each. 

" The first and second years, so unacquainted were these poor brutes 
with the use of this man's house or with his nature, that in a few hours 
they rubbed the house completely down, taking delight in turning the 
logs off with their horns, while he had some difficulty to escape from 
being trampled under their feet or crushed to death in his own ruins. At 
that period he supposed there could not have been less than 2,000 in 
the neighborhood of the spring. They sought for no manner of food, 
but only bathed and drank three or four times a day and rolled in the 
earth, or reposed with their flanks distended in the adjacent shades ; 
and on the fifth and sixth days separated into distinct droves, bathed, 
drank, and departed in single files, according to the exact order of their 
arrival. They all rolled successively in the same hole, and each thus 
carried away a coat of mud to preserve the moisture on their skin and 
which, when hardened and baked in the sun, would resist the stings of 
millions of insects that otherwise would persecute these peaceful trav- 
elers to madness or even death." 

It was a fixed habit with the great buffalo herds to move southward 
from 200 to 400 miles at the approach of winter. Sometimes this move- 
ment was accomplished quietly and without any excitement, but at 
other times it was done with a rush, in which considerable distances 
would be gone over qn the double quick. The advance of a herd was 
often very much like that of a big army, in a straggling line, from four 
to ten animals abreast. Sometimes the herd moved forward in a dense 
mass, and in consequence often came to grief in quicksands, alkali bogs, 
muddy crossings, and on treacherous ice. In such places thousands 
of buffaloes lost their lives, through those in the lead being forced into 
danger by pressure of the mass coming behind. In this manner, in the 

* Travels in America in 1806. London. 1808. 



THE EXTERMINATION OP THE AMERICAN BISON. 421 

summer of 1867, over two thousand buffaloes, out of a herd of about four 
thousand, lost their lives iu the quicksands of the Platte Biver, near 
Plum Creek, while attempting to cross. One winter, a herd of nearly 
a hundred buffaloes attempted to cross a lake called Lac-qui-parle, in 
Minnesota, upon the ice, which gave way, and drowned the entire herd. 
During the days of the buffalo it was a common thing for voyagers on 
the Missouri Eiver to see buffaloes hopelessly mired in the quicksands 
or mud along the shore, either dead or dying, and to find their dead 
bodies floating down the river, or lodged on the upper ends of the islands 
and sand-bars. 

Such accidents as these : it may be repeated, .were due to the great 
number of animals and the momentum of the moving mass. The forced 
marches of the great herds were like the flight of a routed army, in 
which helpless individuals were thrust into mortal peril by the irresist- 
ible force of the mass coming behind, which rushes blindly on after 
their leaders. In this way it was possible to decoy a herd toward a 
precipice and cause it to plunge over en masse, the leaders being thrust 
over by their followers, and all the rest following of their own free will, 
like the sheep who cheerfully leaped, one after another, through a hole 
in the side of a high bridge because their bell-wether did so. 

But it is not to be understood that the movement of a great herd, 
because it was made on a run, necessarily partook of the nature of a 
stampede in which a herd sweeps forward in a body. The most graphic 
account that I ever obtained of facts bearing on this point was furnished 
by Mr. James Mc"Naney, drawn from his experience on the northern 
buffalo range in 1882. His party reached the range (on Beaver Creek, 
about 100 miles south of Glendive) about the middle of November, and 
found buffaloes already there ; in fact they had begun to arrive from the 
north as early as the middle of October. About the first of December 
an immense herd arrived from the north. It reached their vicinity one 
night, about 10 o'clock, in a mass that seemed to spread everywhere. 
As the hunters sat in their tents, loading cartridges and cleaning their 
rifles, a low rumble was heard, which gradually increased to " a thun- 
dering noise," and some one exclaimed, " There ! that's a big herd of 
buffalo coming in!" All ran out immediately, and hallooed and dis- 
charged rifles to keep the buffaloes from running over their tents. For- 
tunately, the horses were picketed some distance away in a grassy 
coulee, which the buffaloes did not enter. The herd came at a jogtrot, 
and moved quite rapidly. "In the morning the whole country was 
black with buffalo." It was estimated that 10,000 head were in sight. 
One immense detachment went down on to a "flat" and laid down. 
There it remained quietly, enjoying a long rest, for about ten days. It 
gradually broke up into small bands, which strolled off iu various 
directions looking for food, and which the hunters quietly attacked. 

A still more striking event occurred about Christmas time at the 
same place. For a few days the neighborhood of McNaney's camp had 



422 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

been entirely deserted by buffaloes, not even one remaining. But one 
morning about daybreak a great herd which was traveling south began 
to pass their camp. A long line of moving forms was seen advancing 
rapidly from the northwest, coming in the direction of the hunters' 
camp. It disappeared in the creek valley for a few moments, and pres- 
ently the leaders suddenly came in sight again at the top of " a rise " 
a few hundred yards away, and came down the intervening slope at 
full speed, within 50 yards of the two tents. After them came a living 
stream of followers, all going at a gallop, described by the observer as 
" a loug lope," from four to ten buffaloes abreast. Sometimes there 
would be a break in the column of a minute's duration, then more buf- 
faloes would appear at the brow of the hill, and the column went rush- 
ing by as before. The calves ran with their mothers, and the young 
stock got over the ground with much less exertion than the older ani- 
mals. For about four hours, or until past 11 o'clock, did this column of 
buffaloes gallop past the camp over a course no wider than a village 
street. Three miles away toward the south the long dark line of bob- 
bing humps and hind quarters wound to the right between two hills and 
disappeared. True to their instincts, the hunters promptly brought out 
their rifles, and began to fire at the buffaloes as they ran. A furious 
fusilade was kept up from the very doors of the tents, and from first to 
last over fifty buffaloes were killed. Some fell headlong the instant 
they were hit, but the greater number ran on until their mortal wounds 
compelled them to halt, draw off a little way to one side, and finally fall 
in their death struggles. 

Mr. McKaney stated that the hunters estimated the number of buf- 
faloes on that portion of the range that winter (1881-'82) at 100,000. 

It is probable, and in fact reasonably certain, that such forced-march 
migrations as the above were due to snow-covered pastures and a scar- 
city of food on the more northern ranges. Having learned that a jour- 
ney south will bring him to regions of less snow and more grass, it is 
but natural that so lusty a traveler should migrate. The herds or 
bands which started south in the fall months traveled more leisurely, 
with frequent halts to graze on rich pastures. The advance was on a 
very different plan, taking place in straggling lines and small groups 
dispersed over quite a scope of country. 

Unless closely pursued, the buffalo never chose to make a journey of 
several miles through hilly country on a continuous run. Even when 
fleeing from the attack of a hunter, I have often had occasion to notice 
that, if the hunter was a mile behind, the buffalo would always walk 
when going uphill ; but as soon as the crest was gained he would begin 
to run, and go down the slope either at a gallop or a swift trot. In 
former times, when the buffalo's world was wide, when retreating from 
an attack he always ran against the wind, to avoid running upon anew 
danger, which showed that he depended more upon his sense of smell 
than his eye-sight. During the last years of his existence, however, this 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 423 

liabit almost totally disappeared, and the harried survivors learned to 
run for the regions which offered the greatest safety. But even to-day, 
if a Texas hunter should go into the Staked Plains, and descry in the 
distance a body of animals ruuning against the wind, he would, without 
a moment's hesitation, pronounce them buffaloes, and the chances are 
that he would be right. 

In winter the buffalo used to face the storms, instead of turning tail 
and "drifting" before them helplessly, as domestic cattle do. But at 
the same time, when beset by a blizzard, he would wisely seek shelter 
from it in some narrow and deep valley or system of ravines. There 
the herd would lie down and wait patiently for the storm to cease. 
After a heavy fall of snow, the place to find the buffalo was in the flats 
and creek bottoms, where the tall, rank bunch-grasses showed their 
tops above the snow, and afforded the best and almost the only food 
obtainable. 

When the snow-fall was unusually heavy, and lay for a long time on 
the ground, the buffalo was forced to fast for days together, and some- 
times even weeks. If a warm day came, and thawed the upper surface 
of the snow sufficiently for succeeding cold to freeze it into a crust, the 
outlook for the bison began to be serious. A man can travel over a 
crust through which the hoofs of a ponderous bison cut like chisels and 
leave him floundering belly-deep. It was at such times that the Indians 
hunted him on snow-shoes, and drove their spears into his vitals as he 
wallowed helplessly in the drifts. Then the wolves grew fat upon the 
victims which they, also, slaughtered almost without effort. 

Although buffaloes did not Often actually perish from hunger and 
cold during the severest winters (save in a few very exceptional cases), 
they often came out in very poor condition. The old bulls always 
suffered more severely than the rest, and at the end of winter were fre- 
quently in miserable plight. 

Unlike most other terrestrial quadrupeds of America, so long as he 
could roam at will the buffalo had settled migratory habits.* While 
the elk and black-tail deer change their altitude twice a year, in con- 
formity with the approach and disappearance of winter, the buffalo 
makes a radical change of latitude. This was most noticeable in the 
great western pasture region, where the herds were most numerous and 
their movements most easily observed. 

* On page 248 of his "North American Indians," vol. I, Mr. Catlin declares point- 
edly that "these animals are, truly speaking, gregarious, but not migratory; they 
graze in immense and almost incredible numbers at times, and roam about aud over 
vast tracts of country from east to west and from -west to east as often as from north 
to south, which has often been supposed they naturally aud habitually did to ac- 
commodate themselves to the temperature of the climate in the different latitudes." 
Had Mr. Catlin resided continuously in any one locality on the great buffalo rauge, 
he would have found that the buffalo had decided migratory habits. The ahundance 
of proof on this point renders it unnecessary to enter fully into the details of the 
subject. 



424 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

At the approah of winter the whole great system of herds which 
ranged from the Peace River to the Indian Territory moved south a 
few hundred miles, and wintered under more favorable circumstances 
than each band would have experienced at its farthest north. Thus it 
happened that nearly the whole of the great range south of the Sas- 
katchewan was occupied by buffaloes even in winter. 

The movement north began with the return of mild weather in the 
early spring. Undoubtedly this northward migration was to escape the 
heat of their southern winter range rather than to find better pasture ; 
for as a grazing country for cattle all the year round, Texas is hardly 
surpassed, except where it is overstocked. It was with the buffaloes a 
matter of choice rather than necessity which sent them on their annual 
pilgrimage northward. 

Col. R,. I. Dodge, who has made many valuable observations on the mi- 
gratory habits of the southern buffaloes, has recorded the following : * 

" Early in spring, as soon as the dry and apparently desert prairie 
had begun to change its coat of dingy brown to one of palest green, the 
horizon would begin to be dotted with buffalo, single or in groups of 
two or three, forerunners of the coining herd. Thicker and thicker and 
in larger groups they come, until by the time the grass is well up the 
whole vast landscape appears a mass of buffalo, some individuals feed- 
ing, others standing, others lying down, but the herd moving slowly, 
moving constantly to the northward. * * * Some years, as in 1871, 
the buffalo appeared to move northward in one immense column often- 
times from 20 to 50 miles in width, and of unknown depth from front to 
rear. Other years the northward journey was made in several parallel 
columns, moving at the same rate, and with their numerous flankers 
covering a width of a hundred or more miles. 

" The line of march of this great spring migration was not always the 
same, though it was confined within certain limits. I am informed by 
old frontiersmen that it has not within twenty-five years crossed the 
Arkansas River east of Great Bend nor west of Big Sand Creek. The 
most favored routes crossed the Arkansas at the mouth of Walnut 
Creek, Pawnee Fork, Mulberry Creek, the Cimarron Crossing, and Big 
Sand Creek. 

" As the great herd proceeds northward it is constantly depleted, 
numbers wandering off to the right and left, until finally it is scattered 
in small herds far and wide over the vast feeding grounds, where they 
pass the summer. 

" When the food in one locality fails they go to another, and towards 
fall, when the grass of the high prairie becomes parched by the heat 
and drought, they gradually work their way back to the south, concen- 
trating on the rich pastures of Texas and the Indian Territory, whence, 
the same instinct acting on all, they are ready to start together on the 
northward march as soon as spring starts the grass." 

* Our Wild Indians, p. 283, et seq. 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 425 

So long as the bison held undisputed possession of the great plains 
his migratory habits were as above — regular, general, and on a scale 
that was truly grand. The herds that wintered in Texas, the Indian 
Territory, and New Mexico probably spent their summers in Nebraska, 
southwestern Dakota, and Wyoming. The winter herds of northern 
Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska, and southern Dakota went to northern 
Dakota and Montana, while the great Montana herds spent the summer 
on the Grand Coteau des Prairies lying between the Saskatchewan and 
the Missouri. The two great annual expeditions of the Red River half- 
breeds, which always took place in summer, went in two directions from 
Winnipeg and Pembina — one, the White Horse Plain division, going 
westward along the Qu'Appelle to the Saskatchewan country, and the 
other, the Red River division, southwest into Dakota. In 1840 the site 
of the present city of Jamestown, Dakota, was the northeastern limit 
of the herds that summered in Dakota, and the country lying between 
that point and the Missouri was for years the favorite hunting ground 
of the Red River division. 

The herds which wintered on the Montana ranges always went north 
in the early spring, usually in March, so that during the time the hunt- 
ers were hauling in the hides taken on the winter hunt the ranges were 
entirely deserted. It is equally certain, however, that a few small bands 
remained in certain portions of Montana throughout the summer. But 
the main body crossed the international boundary, and spent the sum- 
mer on the plains of the Saskatchewan, where they were hunted by the 
half-breeds from the Red River settlements and the Indians of the 
plains. It is my belief that in this movement nearly all the buffaloes 
of Montana and Dakota participated, and that the herds which spent 
the summer in Dakota, where they were annually hunted by the Red 
River half-breeds, came up from Kansas, Colorado, and Nebraska. 

While most of the calves were born on the summer ranges, many were 
brought forth en route. It was the habit of the cows to retire to a 
secluded spot, if possible a ravine well screened from observation, bring 
forth their young, and nourish and defend them until they were strong 
enough to join the herd. Calves were born all the time from March to 
July, and sometimes even as late as August. On the summer ranges it 
was the habit of the cows to leave the bulls at calving time, and thus it 
often happened that small herds were often seen composed of bulls only. 
Usually the cow produced but one calf, but twins were not uncommon. 
Of course many calves were brought forth in the herd, but the favorite 
habit of the cow was as stated. As soon as the young calves were 
brought into the herd, which for prudential reasons occurred at the 
earliest possible moment, the bulls assumed the duty of protecting them 
from the wolves which at all times congregated in the vicinity of a herd, 
watching for an opportunity to seize a calf or a wounded buffalo which 
might be left behind. A calf always follows its mother until its suc- 
cessor is appointed and installed, unless separated from her by force of 



426 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

circumstances. They suck until they are nine months old, or even older, 
and Mr. McNaney once saw a lusty calf suck its mother ^in January) 
on the Montana range several hours after she had been killed for her 
skin. 

When a buffalo is wounded it leaves the herd immediately and goes 
off as far from the line of pursuit as it can get, to escape the rabble of 
hunters, who are sure to follow the main body. If any deep ravines are 
at hand the wounded animal limps away to the bottom of the deepest 
and most secluded one, and gradually works his way up to its very 
head, where he finds himself in a perfect cul-de-sac, barely wide enough 
to admit him. Here he is so completely hidden by the high walls and 
numerous bends that his pursuer must needs come within a few feet of 
his horns before his huge bulk is visible. I have more than once been 
astonished at the real impregnability of the retreats selected by wounded 
bison. In following up wounded bulls in ravine headings it always be- 
came too dangerous to make the last stage of the pursuit on horseback, 
for fear of being caught in a passage so narrow as to insure a fatal acci- 
dent to man or horse in case of a sudden discovery of the quarry. I 
have seen wounded bison shelter in situations where a single bull could 
easily defend himself from a whole pack of wolves, being completely 
walled in on both sides and the rear, and leaving his foes no point of 
attack save his head and horns. 

Bison which were nursing serious wounds must often have gone many 
days at a time without either food or water, and in this connection it 
may be mentioned that the recuperative power of a bison is really won- 
derful. Judging from the number of old leg wounds, fully healed, which 
I have found in freshly killed bisons, one may be tempted to believe 
that a bison never died of a broken leg. One large bull which I skele- 
tonized had had his humerus shot squarely intwo, but it had united 
again more firmly than ever. Another large bull had the head of his left 
femur and the hip socket shattered completely to pieces by a big ball, 
but he had entirely recovered from it, and was as lusty a runner as any 
bull we chased. We found that while a broken leg was a misfortune to 
a buffalo, it always took something more serious than that to stop him. 

. VI. The Food of the Bison. 

It is obviously impossible to enumerate all the grasses which served 
the bison as food on his native heath without presenting a complete list 
of all the plants of that order found in a given region ; but it is at least 
desirable to know which of the grasses of the great pasture region were 
his favorite and most common food. It was the nutritious character 
and marvelous abuudance of his food supply which enabled the bison 
to exist in such absolutely countless numbers as characterized his occu- 
pancy of the great plains. The following list comprises the grasses 
which were the bison's principal food, named in the order of their im- 
portance : 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 427 

Bouteloua oligostacliya (buffalo, grama, or mesquite grass). — This re- 
markable g»rass formed the piece de rSsistance of the bison's bill of fare 
in the days when he flourished, and it now comes to us daily in the form 
of beef produced of primest quality and in greatest quantity on what was 
until recently the great buffalo range. This grass is the most abundant 
and widely distributed species to be found in the great pasture region 
between the eastern slope of the Eocky Mountains and the nineteenth 
degree of west longitude. It is the principal grass of the plains from 
Texas to the British Possessions, and even in the latter territory it is 
quite conspicuous. To any one but a botanist its first acquaintance 
means a surprise. Its name and fame lead the unacquainted to expect 
a grass which is tall, rank, and full of "fodder," like the "blue-joint" 
(Andropogon provincialis). The grama grass is very short, the leaves 
being usually not more than 2 or 3 inches in length and crowded to- 
gether at the base of the stems. The flower stalk is about a foot in 
height, but on grazed lands are eaten off and but seldom seen. The 
leaves are narrow and inclined to curl, and lie close to the ground. In- 
stead of developing a continuous growth, this grass grows iu small, 
irregular patches, usually about the size of a man's hand, with narrow 
strips of perfectly bare ground between them. The grass curls closely 
upon the ground, in a woolly carpet or cushion, greatly resembling a 
layer of Florida moss. Even in spring-time it never shows more color 
than a tint of palest green, and the landscape which is dependent upon 
this grass for color is never more than "a gray and melancholy waste." 
Unlike the soft, juicy, and succulent grasses of the well- watered por- 
tions of the United States, the tiny leaves of the grama grass are hard, 
stiff, and dry. I have often noticed that in grazing neither cattle nor 
horses are able to bite off the blades, but instead each leaf is pulled 
out of the tuft, seemingly by its root. 

Notwithstanding its dry and uninviting appearance, this grass is 
highly nutritious, and its fat-producing qualities are unexcelled. The 
heat of summer dries it up effectually without destroying its nutritive ele- 
ments, and it becomes for the remainder of the year excellent hay, cured 
on its own roots. It affords good grazing all the year round, save in 
winter, when it is covered with snow, and even then, if the snow is not 
too deep, the buffaloes, cattle, and horses paw down through it to reach 
the grass, or else repair to wind-swept ridges and hill-tops, where the 
snow has been blown off and left the grass partly exposed. Stock pre- 
fer it to all the other grasses of the plains. 

On bottom-lands, where moisture is abundant, this grass develops 
much more luxuriantly, growing in a close mass, and often to a height 
of a foot or more, if not grazed down, when it is cut for hay, and some- 
times yields 1£ tons to the acre. In Montana and the north it is gen- 
erally known as " buffalo-grass," a name to which it would seem to be 
fully entitled, notwithstanding the fact that this name is also applied, 
and quite generally, to another species, the next to be noticed. 



428 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

Buchloe dactyloides (Southern buffalo-grass). — This species is next in 
value and extent of distribution to the grama grass. It also is found 
all over the great plains south of Nebraska and southern Wyoming, 
but not further north, although in many localities it occurs so sparsely 
as to be of little account. A single bunch of it very greatly resembles 
Bouteloua oligostachya, but its general growth is very different. It is 
very short, its general mass seldom rising more than 3 inches above 
the ground. It grows in extensive patches, and spreads by means of 
stolons, which sometimes are 2 feet in length, with joints every 3 or 4 
inches. Owing to its southern distribution this might well be named 
the Southern buffalo grass, to distinguish it from the two other species 
of higher latitudes, to which the name " buffalo" has been fastened for- 
ever. 

Stipa spartea (Northern buffalo-grass ; wild oat). — This grass is found 
in southern Manitoba, westwardly across the plains to the Eocky Mount- 
ains, and southward as far as Montana, where it is common in many 
localities. On what was once the buffalo range of the British Posses- 
sions this rank grass formed the bulk of the winter pasturage, and in 
that region is quite as famous as our grama grass. An allied species 
(Stipa viridula, bunch-grass) is " widely diffused over our Eocky Mount- 
ain region, extending to California and British America, and furnish- 
ing a considerable part of the wild forage of the region." Stipa spartea 
bears an ill name among stockmen on account of the fact that at the 
base of each seed is a very hard and sharp-pointed callus, which under 
certain circumstances (so it is said) lodges in the cheeks of domestic 
animals that feed upon this grass when it is dry, and which cause 
much trouble. But the buffalo, like the wild horse and half- wild range 
cattle, evidently escaped this annoyance. This grass is one of the 
common species over a wide area of the northern plains, and is always 
found on soil which is comparatively dry. In Dakota, Minnesota, and 
northwest Iowa it forms a considerable portion of the upland prairie 
hay. 

Of the remaining grasses it is practically impossible to single out any 
one as being specially entitled to fourth place in this list. There are 
several species which flourish in different localities, and in many re- 
spects appear to be of about equal importance as food for stock. Of 
these the following are the most noteworthy: 

Aristida purpurea (Western beard-grass; purple "bunch-grass" of 
Montana). — On the high, rolling prairies of the Missouri-Yellowstone 
divide this grass is very abundant. It grows in little solitary bunches, 
about 6 inches high, scattered through the curly buffalo-grass (Bouteloua 
oligostachya). Under more favorable conditions it grows to a height of 
12 to 18 inches. It is one of the prettiest grasses of that region, and in 
the fall and winter its purplish color makes it quite noticeable. The 
Montana stockmen consider it one of the most valuable grasses of that 
region for stock of all kinds. Mr. 0. M. Jacobs assured me that the 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 429 

buffalo used to be very fond of this grass, and that "wherever this grass 
grew in abundance there were the best hunting-grounds for the bison." 
It appears that Aristida purpurea is not sufficiently abundant elsewhere 
in the Northwest to make it an important food for stock ; but Dr. Vesey 
declares that it is "abundant on the plains of Kansas, New Mexico, 
and Texas." 

Kceleria cristata. — Very generally distributed from Texas and New 
Mexico to the British Possessions ; sand hills and arid soils; mountains, 
up to 8,000 feet. 

Poa tenuifolia (blue-grass of the plains and mountains). — A. valuable 
"bunch -grass," widely distributed throughout the great pasture region; 
grows in all sorts of soils and situations; common in the Yellowstone 
Park. 

Festuca scabrella (bunch-grass). — One of the most valuable grasses of 
Montana and the Northwest generally; often called the "great bunch- 
grass." It furnishes excellent food for horses and cattle, and is so tall 
it is cut in large quantities for hay. This is the prevailing species on 
the foot-hills and mountains generally, up to an altitude of 7,000 feet, 
where it is succeeded by Festuca ovina. 

Andropogon provincialis (blue-stem). — An important species, extend- 
ing from eastern Kansas and Nebraska to the foot-hills of the Eocky 
Mountains, and from Northern Texas to the Saskatchewan ; common in 
Montana on alkali flats and bottom lands generally. This and the pre- 
ceding species were of great value to the buffalo in winter, when the 
shorter grasses were covered with snow. 

Andropogon scoparius (bunch-grass; broom sedge; wood-grass). — Sim- 
ilar to the preceding in distribution and value, but not nearly so tall. 

None of the buffalo-grasses are found in the mountains. In the 
mountain regions which have been visited by the buffalo and in the 
Yellowstone Park, where to-day the only herd remaining in a state of 
nature is to be found (though not by the man with a gun), the following 
are the grasses which form all but a small proportion of the ruminant 
food: Kceleria cristata; Poa tenuifolia (Western blue-grass); Stipa 
viridula (feather-grass); Stipa comata; Agropyrum divergens; Agro- 
pyrum caninum. 

When pressed by hunger, the buffalo used to browse on certain species 
of sage-brush, particularly Atriplex canescens of the Southwest. But he 
was discriminating in the matter of diet, and as far as can be ascer- 
tained he was never known to eat the famous and much-dreaded " loco" 
weed (Astragalus molissimus), which to ruminant animals is a veritable 
drug of madness. Domestic cattle and horses often eat this plant where 
it is abundant, and become demented in consequence. 

VII. Mental Capacity and Disposition. 

(1) Reasoning from cause to effect. — The buffalo of the past was an 
animal of a rather low order of intelligence, and his dullness of intel- 



430 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

lect was one of the important factors in his phenomenally swift exter- 
mination. He was provokingly slow in comprehending the existence 
and nature of the dangers that threatened his life, and, like the stupid 
brute that he was, would very often stand quietly and see two or three 
score, or even a hundred, of his relatives and companions shot down 
before his eyes, with no other feeling than one of stupid wonder and 
curiosity. Neither the noise nor smoke of the still-hunter's rifle, the 
falling, struggling, nor the final death of his companions conveyed to 
his mind the idea of a danger to be fled from, and so the herd stood still 
and allowed the still-hunter to slaughter its members at will. 

Like the Indian, and many white men also, the buffalo seemed to feel 
that their number was so great it could never be sensibly diminished. 
The presence of such a great multitude gave to each of its individuals 
a feeling of security and mutual support that is very generally found 
in animals who congregate in great herds. The time was when a band 
of elk would stand stupidly and wait for its members to be shot down 
one after another ; but it is believed that this was due more to panic 
than to a lack of comprehension of danger. 

The fur seals who cover the "hauling grounds" of St. Paul and St. 
George Islands, Alaska, in countless thousands, have even less sense of 
danger and less comprehension of the slaughter of thousands of their 
kind, which takes place daily, than had the bison. They allow them- 
selves to be herded and driven off landwards from the hauling-ground 
for half a mile to the killing-ground, and, finally, with most cheerful 
indifference, permit the Aleuts to club their brains out. 

It is to be. added that whenever and wherever seals or sea-lions in- 
habit a given spot, with but few exceptions, it is an easy matter to 
approach individuals of the herd. The presence of an immense number 
of individuals plainly begets a feeling of security and mutual support. 
And let not the bison or the seal be blamed for this, for man himself 
exhibits the same foolish instinct. Who has not met the woman of ma- 
ture years and full intellectual vigor who is mortally afraid to spend a 
night entirely alone in her own house, but is perfectly willing to do so, 
and often does do so without fear, when she can have the company of one 
small and helpless child, or, what is still worse, three or four of them ? 

But with the approach of extermination, and the utter breaking up 
of all the herds, a complete change has been wrought in the character 
of the bison. At last, but alas! entirely too late, the crack of the rifle 
and its accompanying puff of smoke conveyed to the slow mind of the 
bison a sense of deadly danger to himself. At last he recognized man, 
whether on foot or horseback, or peering at him from a coulee, as his 
mortal enemy. At last he learned to run. In 1886 we found the scat- 
tered remnant of the great northern herd the wildest and most difficult 
animals to kill that we had ever hunted in any country. It had been 
only through the keenest exercise of all their powers of self-preserva- 
tion that those buffaloes had survived until that late day, and we found 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 431 

thein almost as swift as antelopes and far more wary. The instant a 
buffalo caught sight of a man, even though a mile distant, he was off 
at the top of his speed, and generally ran for some wild region several 
miles away. 

In our party was an experienced buffalo-hunter, who in three years 
had slaughtered over three thousand head for their hides. He declared 
that if he could ever catch a " bunch " at rest he could " get a stand " 
the same as he used to do, and kill several head before the rest would 
run. It so happened that the first time we found buffaloes we discov- 
ered a bunch of fourteen head, lying in the sun at noon, on the level top 
of a low butte, all noses pointing up the wind. We stole up within 
range and fired. At the instant the first shot rang out up sprang every 
buffalo as if he had been thrown upon his feet by steel springs, and in 
a second's time the whole bunch was dashing away from us with the 
speed of race-horses. 

Our buffalo-hunter declared that in chasing buffaloes we could count 
with certainty upon their always running against the wind, for this had 
always been their habit. Although this was ouce their habit, we soon 
found that those who now represent the survival of the fittest have 
learned better wisdom, and now run (1) away from their pursuer and (2) 
toward the best hiding place. Now they pay no attention whatever to 
the direction of the wind, and if a pursuer follows straight behind, a 
buffalo may change his course three or four times in a 10-mile chase. 
An old bull once led one of our hunters around three-quarters of a circle 
which had a diameter of 5 or 6 miles. 

The last buffaloes were mentally as capable of taking care of them- 
selves as any animals I ever hunted. The power of original reasoning 
which they manifested in scattering all over a given tract of rough 
country, like hostile Indians when hotly pressed by soldiers, in the 
Indian-like manner in which they hid from sight in deep hollows, and, 
as we finally proved, in grazing only in ravines and hollows, proved con- 
clusively that but for the use of fire-arms those very buffaloes would have 
been actually safe from harm by man, and that they would have in- 
creased indefinitely. As they were then, the Indians' arrows and spears 
could never have been brought to bear upon them, save in rare instances, 
for they had thoroughly learned to dread man and fly from him for 
their lives. Could those buffaloes have been protected from rifles and 
revolvers the resultant race would have displayed far more active 
mental powers, keener vision, and finer physique than the extinguished 
race possessed. 

In fleeing from an enemy the buffalo ran against the wind, in order 
that his keen scent might save him from the disaster of running upon 
new enemies ; which was an idea wholly his own, and not copied by 
any other animal so far as known. 

But it must be admitted that the buffalo of the past was very often 
a most stupid reasoner. He would deliberately walk into a quicksand, 



432 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887, 

where hundreds of his companions were already ingulfed and in their 
death-struggle. He would quit feeding, run half a mile, and rush head- 
long into a moving train of cars that happened to come between him 
and the main herd on the other side of the track. He allowed himself 
to be impounded and slaughtered by a howling mob in a rudely con- 
structed pen, which a combined effort on the part of three or four old 
bulls would have utterly demolished at any point. A herd of a thou- 
sand buffaloes would allow an armed hunter to gallop into their midst, 
very often within arm's-length, when any of the bulls nearest him might 
easily have bowled him over and had him trampled to death in a moment. 
The hunter who would ride in that manner into a herd of the Cape buf- 
faloes of Africa {Bubalus caffer) would be unhorsed and killed before he 
had gone half a furlong. 

(2) Curiosity. — The buffalo of the past possessed but little curiosity ; 
he was too dull to entertain many unnecessary thoughts. Had he pos- 
sessed more of this peculiar trait, which is the mark of an inquiring 
mind, he would much sooner have accomplished a comprehension of the 
dangers that proved his destruction. His stolid indifference to every- 
thing he did not understand cost him his existence, although in later 
years he displayed more interest in his environment. On one occasion 
in hunting I staked my success with an old bull I was pursuing on the 
chance that when he reached the crest of a ridge his curiosity would 
prompt him to pause an instant to look at me. TJp to that moment he 
had had only one quick glance at me before he started to run. As he- 
climbed the slope ahead of me, in full view, I dismounted and made 
ready to fire the instant he should pause to look at me. As I expected, 
he did come to a full stop on the crest of the ridge, and turned half 
around to look at me. But for his curiosity I should have been obliged 
to fire at him under very serious disadvantages. 

(3) Fear. — With the buffalo, fear of man is now the ruling passion. 
Says Colonel Dodge : " He is as timid about his flank and rear as a raw 
recruit. When traveling nothing in front stops him, but an unusual 
object in the rear will send him to the right-about [toward the main 
body of the herd] at the top of his speed." 

(4) Courage. — It was very seldom that the buffalo evinced any cour- 
age save that of despair, which even cowards possess. Unconscious of 
his strength, his only thought was flight, and it was only when brought 
to bay that he was ready to fight. Now and then, however, in the 
chase, the buffalo turned upon his pursuer and overthrew horse and 
rider. Sometimes the tables were completely turned, and the hunter 
found his only safety in flight. During the buffalo slaughter the butchers 
sometimes had narrow escapes from buffaloes supposed to be dead or 
mortally wounded, and a story comes from the great northern range 
south of Glendive of a hunter who was killed by an old bull whose 
tongue he had actually cut out in the belief that he was dead. 

Sometimes buffalo cows display genuine courage in remaining with 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 433 

their calves in the presence of danger, although in most cases they left 
their offspring to their fate. During a hunt for live buffalo calves, un- 
dertaken by Mr. 0. J. Jones of Garden City, Kans., in 1886, and very 
graphically described by a staff correspondent of the American Field in 
a series of articles in that journal under the title of " The Last of the 
Buffalo," the following remarkable incident occurred:* 

"The last calf was caught by Carter, who roped it neatly as Mr. 
Jones cut it out of the herd and turned it toward him. This was a fine 
heifer calf, and was apparently the idol of her mother's heart, for the 
latter came very near making a casualty the price of the capture. As 
soon as the calf was roped, the old cow left the herd and charged on 
Carter viciously, as he bent over his victim. Seeing the danger, Mr. 
Jones rode in at just the nick of time, and drove the cow off for a mo- 
ment; but she returned again and again, and finally began charging 
him whenever he came near; so that, much as he regretted it, he had 
to shoot her with his revolver, which he did, killing her almost immedi- 
ately." 

The mothers of the thirteen other calves that were caught by Mr. 
Jones's party allowed their offspring to be "cut out," lassoed, and tied, 
while they themselves devoted all their energies to leaving them as far 
behind as possible. 

(5) Affection. — While the buffalo cows manifested a fair degree of af- 
fection for their young, the adult bulls of the herd often displayed a 
sense of responsibility for the safety of the calves that was admirable, 
to say the least. Those who have had opportunities for watching large 
herds tell us that whenever wolves approached and endeavored to reach 
a calf the old bulls would immediately interpose and drive the enemy 
away. It was a well-defined habit for the bulls to form the outer circle 
of every small group or section of a great herd, with the calves in the 
center, well guarded from the wolves, which regarded them as their most 
choice prey. 

Colonel Dodge records a remarkable incident in illustration of the 
manner in which the bull buffaloes protected the calves of the herd.t 

"The duty of protecting the calves devolved almost entirely on the 
bulls. I have seen evidences of this many times, but the most remark- 
able instance I have ever heard of was related to me by an army sur- 
geon, who was an eye-witness. 

" He was one evening returning to camp after a day's hunt, when his 
attention was attracted by the curious action of a little knot of six or 
eight buffalo. Approaching sufficiently near to see clearly, he discov- 
ered that this little knot were all bulls, standing in a close circle, with 
their heads outwards, while in a concentric circle at some 12 or 15 paces 
distant sat, licking their chaps in impatient expectancy, at least a dozen 
large gray wolves (excepting man, the most dangerous enemy of the 
buffalo). 

"American Field, July 24, 1886, p. 78. 
t Plains of the Great West, p. 125. 
H. Mis. 600, pt. 2 28 • 



434 EEPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

"The doctor determined to watch the performance. After a few mo. 
ments the knot broke up, and, still keeping in a compact mass, started 
on a trot for the main herd, some half a mile off. To his very great as- 
tonishment, the doctor now saw that the central and controlling figure 
of this mass was a poor little calf so newly born as scarcely to be able 
to walk. After going 50 or 100 paces the calf laid down, the bulls dis- 
posed themselves in a circle as before, and the wolves, who had trotted 
along on each side of their retreating supper, sat down and licked their 
chaps again ; and though the doctor did not see the finale, it being late 
and the camp distant, he had no doubt that the noble fathers did their 
whole duty by their offspring, and carried it safely to the herd." 

(6) Temper. — I have asked many old buffalo hunters for facts in re- 
gard to the temper and disposition of herd buffaloes, and all agree that 
they are exceedingly quiet, peace-loving, and even indolent animals at 
all times save during the rutting season. Says Colonel Dodge: "The 
habits of the buffalo are almost identical with those of the domestic 
cattle. Owing either to a more pacific disposition, or to the greater 
number of bulls, there is very little fighting, even at the season when it 
might be expected. I have been among them for days, have watched 
their conduct for hours at a time, and with the very best opportunities 
for observation, but have never seen a regular combat between bulls. 
They frequently strike each other with their horns, but this seems to be 
a mere expression of impatience at being crowded." 

In referring to the " running season" of the buffalo, Mr. Catlin says: 
"It is no uncommon thing at this season, at these gatherings, to see 
several thousands in a mass eddying and wheeling about under a cloud 
of dust, which is raised by the bulls as they are pawing in the dirt, or 
engaged in desperate combats, as they constantly are, plunging and 
butting at each other in a most furious manner." 

On the whole, the disposition of the buffalo is anything but vicious. 
Both sexes yield with surprising readiness to the restraints of captivity, 
and in a remarkably short time become, if taken young, as fully domes- 
ticated as ordinary cattle. Buffalo calves are as easily tamed as domestic 
ones, and make very interesting pets. A prominent trait of character 
in the captive buffalo is a mulish obstinacy or headstrong perseverance 
under certain circumstances that is often very annoying. When a buf- 
falo makes up his mind to go through a fence, he is very apt to go 
through, either peacably or by force, as occasion requires. Fortunately, 
however, the captive animals usually accept a fence in the proper spirit, 
and treat it with a fair degree of respect. 

VIII. Value of the Buffalo to Man. 

It may fairly be supposed that if the people of this country could have 
been made to realize the immense money value of the great buffalo 
herds as they existed in 1870, a vigorous and successful effort would 
have been made to regulate and restrict the slaughter. The fur 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 435 

seal of Alaska, of which about 100,000 are killed annually for their 
skins, yield an auuual revenue to the Government of $100,000, and add 
$000,000 more to the actual wealth of the United States. It pays to 
protect those seals, and we mean to protect them against all comers 
who seek their unrestricted slaughter, no matter whether the poachers 
be American, English, Russian, or Canadian. It would be folly to do 
otherwise, and if those who would exterminate the far seal by shooting 
them in the water will not desist for the telling, then they must by 
the compelling. 

The fur seal is a good investment for the United States, and their 
number is not diminishing. As the buffalo herds existed in 1870, 
500,000 head of bulls, young and old, could have been killed every year 
for a score of years without sensibly diminishing the size of the herds. 
At a low estimate these could easily have been made to yield various 
products worth $5 each, as follows : Robe, $2.50 ; tongue, 25 cents ; meat 
of hind-quarters, $2; bones, horns, and hoofs, 25 cents; total, $5. 
And the amount annually added to the wealth of the United States 
would have been $2,500,000. 

On all the robes taken for the market, say, 200,000, the Government 
could have collected a tax of 50 cents each, which would have yielded 
a sum doubly sufficient to have maintained a force of mounted police 
fully competent to enforce the laws regulating the slaughter. Had a 
contract for the protection of the buffalo been offered at $50,000 per 
annum, ay, or even half that sum, an army of competent men would 
have competed for it every year, and it could have been carried out 
to the letter. But, as yet, the American people have not learned to 
spend money for the protection of valuable game ; and by the time they 
do learn it, there will be no game to protect. 

Even despite the enormous waste of raw material that ensued in the 
utilization of the buffalo product, the total cash value of all the material 
derived from this source, if it could only be reckoned up, would certainly 
amount to many millions of dollars — perhaps twenty millions, all told. 
This estimate may, to some, seem high, but when we stop to consider 
that in eight years, from 1876 to 1884, a single firm, that of Messrs. J. & 
A. Boskowitz, 105 Greene street, New York, paid out the enormous 
sum of $923,070 (nearly one million) for robes and hides, and that in a 
single year (1882) another firm, that of Joseph Ullman, 165 Mercer 
street, New York, paid out $216,250 for robes and hides, it may not 
seem so incredible. 

Had there been a deliberate plan for the suppression of all statistics 
relating to the slaughter of buffalo in the United States, and what it 
yielded, the result could not have been more complete barrenness than 
exists to-day in regard to this subject. There is only one railway com- 
pany which kept its books in such a manner as to show the kind and 
quantity of its business at that time. Excepting this, nothing is known 
definitely. 



436 KEPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

Fortunately, enough facts and figures were recorded during the hunt- 
ing operations of the Eed Eiver half-breeds to enable us, by bringing 
them all together, to calculate with sufficient exactitude the value of 
the buffalo to them from 1820 to 1840. The result ought to be of inter- 
est to all who think it is not worth while to spend money in preserving 
our characteristic game animals. 

In Ross's "Red River Settlement," pp. 242-273, and Schoolcraft's 
"North American Indians," Part iv, pp. 101-110, are given detailed ac- 
counts of the conduct and results of two hunting expeditions by the 
half-breeds, with many valuable statistics. On this data we base our 
calculation. 

Taking the result of one particular day's slaughter as an index to the 
methods of the hunters in utilizing the products of the chase, we find 
that while "not less than 2,500 animals were killed," out of that num- 
ber only 375 bags of pemmican and 240 bales of dried meat were made. 
"Now/' says Mr. Ross, "making all due allowance for waste, 750 animals 
would have been ample for such a result. What, then, we might ask, 
became of the remaining 1,750 ? * * * Scarcely one-third in num- 
ber of the animals killed is turned to account." 

A bundle of dried meat weighs 60 to 70 pounds, and a bag of pem- 
mican 100 to 110 pounds. If economically worked up, a whole buffalo 
cow yields half a bag of pemmican (about 55 pounds) and three-fourths 
of a bundle of dried meat (say 45 pounds). The most economical cal- 
culate that from eight to ten cows are required to load a single Red 
River cart. The proceeds of 1,776 cows once formed 228 bags of pem- 
mican, 1,213 bales of dried meat, 166 sacks of tallow, each weighing 200 
pounds, 556 bladders of marrow weighing 12 pounds each, and the 
value of the whole was $8,160. The total of the above statement is 
132,657 pounds of buffalo product for 1,776 cows, or within a fraction 
of 75 pounds to each cow. The bulls and young animals killed were not 
accounted for. 

The expedition described by Mr. Ross contained 1,210 carts and 620 
hunters, and returned with 1,089,000 pounds of meat, making 900 pounds 
for each cart, and 200 pounds for each individual in the expedition, of 
all ages and both sexes. Allowing, as already ascertained, that of the 
above quantity of product every 75 pounds represents one cow saved 
and two and one-third buffaloes wasted, it means that 14,520 buffaloes 
were killed and utilized and 33,250 buffaloes were killed and eaten fresh 
or wasted, and 47,770 buffaloes were killed by 620 huuters, or an aver, 
age of 77 buffaloes to each hunter. The total number of buffaloes killed 
for each cart was 39. 

Allowing, what was actually the case, that every buffalo killed would, 
if properly cared for, have yielded meat, fat, and robe worth at least 
$5, the total value of the buffaloes slaughtered by that expedition 
amounted to $238,850, and of which the various products actually 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 437 

utilized represented a cash value of $72,000 added to the wealth of the 
Eed Biver half- breeds. 

In 1820 there went 540 carts to the buffalo plains ; in 1825, 680 ; in 
1830, 820 5 in 1835, 970 j in 1840, 1,210. 

From 1820 to 1825 the average for each year was 610 ; from 1825 to 
1830, 750; from 1830 to 1835, 895; from 1835 to 1840, 1,090. 

Accepting the statements of eye-witnesses that for every buffalo 
killed two and one -third buffaloes are wasted or eaten on the spot, and 
that every loaded cart represented thirty-nine dead buffaloes which 
were worth when utilized $5 each, we have the following series of totals: 

From 1820 to 1825 five expeditions, of 610 carts each, killed 118,950 
buffaloes, worth $594,750. 

From 1825 to 1830 five expeditions, of 750 carts each, killed 146,250 
buffaloes, worth $731,250. 

From 1830 to 1835 five expeditions, of 895 carts each, killed 174,525 
buffaloes, worth $872,625. 

From 1835 to 1840 five expeditions, of 1,090 carts each, killed 212,550 
buffaloes, worth $1,062,750. 

Total number of buffaloes killed in twenty years,* $652,275; total value 
of buffaloes killed in twenty years,* $3,261,375; total value of the 
product utilized* and added to the wealth of the settlements, $978,412. 

The Eskimo has his seal, which yields nearly everything that he re- 
quires ; the Korak of Siberia depends for his very existence upon his 
reindeer; the Ceylon native has the cocoa-nut palm, which leaves him 
little else to desire, and the North American Indian had the American 
bison. If any animal was ever designed by the hand of nature for the 
express purpose of supplying, at one stroke, nearly all the wants of an 
entire race, surely the buffalo was intended for the Indian. 

And right well was this gift of the gods utilized by the children of 
nature to whom it came. Up to the time when the United States Gov- 
ernment began to support our "Western Indians by the payment of an- 
nuities and furnishing quarterly supplies of food, clothing, blankets, 
cloth, tents, etc., the buffalo bad been the main dependence of more than 
50,000 Indians who inhabited the buffalo range and its environs. Of 
the man3 T different uses to which the buffalo and his various parts were 
put by the red man, the following were the principal ones: 

The body of the buffalo yielded fresh meat, of which thousands of 
tons were consumed; dried meat, prepared in summer for winter use; 
pemmican (also prepared in summer), of meat, fat, and berries; tallow, 
made up into large balls or sacks, and kept in store; marrow, preserved 
in bladders; and tongues, dried and smoked, and eaten as a delicacy. 

The skin of the buffalo yielded a robe, dressed with the hair on, for 
clothing and bedding; a hide, dressed without the hair, which made a 
teepee cover, when a number were sewn together ; boats, when sewn 
together in a green state, over a wooden framework. Shields, made 

* By the Red River half-breeds ouly. 



438 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

from the thickest portions, as rawhide; ropes, made up as rawhide; 
clothing of many kinds; bags for use in traveling; coffins, or winding 
sheets for the dead, etc. 

Other portions utilized were sinews, which furnished fiber for ropes, 
thread, bow-strings, snow-shoe webs, etc. ; hair, which was sometimes 
made into belts and ornaments ; " buffalo chips," which formed a valua- 
ble and highly-prized fuel; bones, from which many articles of use and 
ornament were made; horns, which were made into spoons, drinking 
vessels, etc. 

After the United States Government began to support the buffalo- 
hunting Indians with annuities and supplies, the woolen blanket and 
canvas tent took the place of the buffalo robe and the skin-covered 
teepee, and " Government beef" took the place of buffalo meat. But 
the slaughter of buffaloes went on just the same, and the robes and hides 
taken were traded for useless and often harmful luxuries, such as canned 
provisions, fancy knickknacks, whisky, fire-arms of the most approved 
pattern, and quantities of fixed ammunition. During the last ten years 
of the existence of the herds it is an open question whether the buffalo 
did not do our Indians more harm than good. Amongst the Crows, who 
were liberally provided for by the Government, horse-racing was a com- 
mon j>astime, and the stakes were usually dressed buffalo robes.* 

The total disappearance of the buffalo has made no perceptible differ- 
ence in the annual cost of the Indians to the Government. During the 
years when buffaloes were numerous and robes for the purchase of fire- 
arms and cartridges were plentiful, Indian wars were frequent, and 
always costly to the Government. The Indians were then quite inde- 
pendent, because they could take the war path at any time and live on 
buffalo indefinitely. Now, the case is very different. The last time 
Sitting Bull went on the war-path and was driven up into Manitoba, 
he had the doubtful pleasure of living on his ponies and dogs until he 
became utterly starved out. Since his last escapade, the Sioux have 
been compelled to admit that the game is up and the war-path is open 
to them no longer. Should they wish to do otherwise they know that 
they could survive only by killing cattle, and cattle that are guarded 
by cow-boys and ranchmen are no man's game. Therefore, while we no 
longer have to pay for an annual campaign in force against hostile In- 
dians, the total absence of the buffalo brings upon the nation the entire 
support of the Indian, and the cash outlay each year is as great as ever. 

The value of the American bison to civilized man can never be cal- 
culated, nor even fairly estimated. It may with safety be said, how- 
ever, that it has been probably tenfold greater than most persons have 

* On oue occasion, which. is doubtless still remembered -with bitterness by-many a 
Crow of the Custer Agency, my old friend Jim McNaney backed his horse Ogalalla 
against the Dorses of the whole Crow tribe. The Crows forthwith formed a pool, 
which consisted of a huge pile of buffalo robes, worth about $1,200, and with it 
. bached I heir best race-horse. He was forthwith u beaten out of sight " by Ogalalla, 
and another grievance was registered against the whites.

ever supposed. It would be a work of years to gather statistics of the 
immense bulk of robes aud hides, undoubtedly amounting to millions 
in the aggregate; the thousands of tons of meat, and the train-loads 
of boues which have been actually utilized by man. Nor can the effect 
of the bison's presence upon the general development of the great West 
ever be calculated. It has sunk into the great sum total of our progress, 
and well nigh lost to sight forever. 

As a mere suggestion of the immense value of "the buffalo product" 
at the time when it had an existence, I have obtained from two of our 
leading fur houses in New York City, with branches elsewhere, a de- 
tailed statement of their business in buffalo robes and hides during the 
last few years of the trade. They not only serve to show the great value 
of the share of the annual crop that passed through their hands, but 
that of Messrs. J. & A. Boskowitz is of especial value, because, being 
carClully itemized throughout, it shows the decline aud final failure of 
the trade in exact figures. I am under many obligations to both these 
firms for their kindness in furnishing the facts I desired, and especially 
to the Messrs. Boskowitz, who devoted considerable time and labor to 
the careful compilation of the annexed statement of their business in 
buffalo skins.

Total number of buffalo skins bandied in nine years, 246,175 ; total cost, $924,790. 

I have also been favored with some very interesting facts and figures 
regarding the business done in buffalo skins by the firm of Mr. Joseph 
Ullman, exporter and importer of furs and robes, of 165-167 Mercer 
street, New York, and also 353 Jackson street, St. Paul, Minnesota. 
The following letter was written me by Mr. Joseph Ullman on Novem- 
ber 12, 1887, for which I am greatly indebted: 

''Inasmuch as you particularly desire the figures for the years 
1880-'86, I have gone through my buffalo robe aud hide accounts of 
those years, and herewith give you approximate figures, as there are a 
good many things to be considered which make it difficult to give exact 
figures. 



440 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887.- 

" In 1881 we handled about 14,000 hides, average cost about $3.50, 
and 12,000 robes, average cost about $7.50. 

"In 1882 we purchased between 35,000 and 40,000 hides, at an aver- 
age cost of about $3.50, and about 10,000 robes, at an average cost of 
about $8.50. 

"In 1883 we purchased from 6,000 to 7,000 hides and about 1,500 to 
2,0;, robes at a slight advance in price against the year previous. 

''•In 1884 we purchased less than 2,500 hides, and in my opinion these 
were such as were carried over from the previous season in the North- 
west, and were not fresh-slaughtered skins. The collection of robes 
this season was also comparatively small, and nominally robes carried 
over from 1883. 

"In 1885 the collection of hides amounted to little or nothing. 

" The aforesaid goods were all purchased direct in the Northwest, 
that is to say, principally in Montana, and shipped in care of our branch 
house at St. Paul, Minnesota, to Joseph Ullinan, Chicago. The robes 
mentioned above were Indian-tanned robes and were mainly disposed 
of to the jobbing trade both East and West. 

" In 1881 and the years prior, the hides were divided into two kinds, 
viz, robe hides, which were such as had a good crop of fur and were 
serviceable for robe purposes, and the heavy and short-furred bull 
hides. The former were principally sold to the John S. Way Manufact- 
uring Company, Bridgeport, Connecticut, and to numerous small robe 
tanners, while the latter were sold for leather purposes to various hide- 
tan uers throughout the United States and Canada, and brought 5£ to 
8^ cents per pound. A very large proportion of these latter were tanned 
by the Wilcox Tanning Company, Wilcox, Pennsylvania. 

"About the fall of 1882 we established a tannery for buffalo. robes in 
Chicago, and from that time forth we tanned all the good hides which 
we received into robes and disposed of them in the same manner as the 
Indian-tanned robes. 

" I don't know that I am called upon to express an opinion as to the 
benefit or disadvantage of the extermination of the buffalo, but never- 
theless take the liberty to say that I think that some proper law restrict- 
ing the unpardonable slaughter of the buffalo should have been enacted 
at the time. It is a well-known fact that soon after the Northern Pacific 
Eailroad opened up that portion of the country, thereby making the 
transportation of the buffalo hides feasible, that is to say, reducing the 
cost of freight, thousands upon thousands of buffaloes were killed for 
the sake of the hide alone, while the carcasses were left to rot on the 
open plaius. 

"• The average prices paid the buffalo hunters [from 1880 to 1884] was 
about as follows: For cow hides [robes?], $3; bull hides, $2.50; year- 
lings, $1.50 ; calves, 75 cents; and the cost of getting the hides to mar- 
ket brought the cost up to about $3.50 per hide." 

The amount actually paid out by Joseph Ullinan, in four years, for 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 441 

buffalo robes and bides was about $310,000, and tbis, too, long after 
tbe great southern berd had ceased to exist, and when the northern herd 
furnished the sole supply. It thus appears that during the course of 
eight years business (leaving out tbe small sum paid out in 1884), on 
tbe part of tbe Messrs. Boskowitz, and four years on tbat of Mr. Joseph 
Ullman, these two firms alone paid out tbe enormous sum of $1,233,070 
for buffalo robes and hjdes which they purchased to sell again at a 
good profit. By the time their share of the buffalo product reached 
the consumers it must have represented an actual money value of about 
$2,000,000. 

Besides these two firms there were at that time many others who 
also bandied great quantities of buffalo skins and hides for which they 
paid out immense sums of money. In this country the other leading 
firms engaged in this business were I. G. Baker & Co., of Fort Benton ; 
P. B. Weare & Co., Chicago ; Qbern, Hoosick & Co., Chicago and Saint 
Paul; Martin Bates & Co., and Messrs. Shearer, Nichols & Co. (now 
Hurlburt, Shearer & Sauford), of New York. There were also many 
others whose names I am now unable to recall. 

In tbe British Possessions and Canada the frontier business was 
largely monopolized by the Hudson's Bay Fur Company, although tbe 
annual "output" of robes and bides was but small in comparison with 
tbat gathered in tbe United States, where the herds were far more 
numerous. Even in their most fruitful locality for robes — tbe country 
south of tbe Saskatchewan — this company had a very powerful com- 
petitor in the firm of I. G-. Baker & Co., of Fort Benton, which secured 
the lion's share of the spoil and sent it down the Missouri Biver. 

It is quite certain that the utilization of tbe buffalo product, even so 
far as it was accomplished, resulted in the addition of several millions 
of dollars to the wealth of the people of the United States. That the 
total sum, could it be reckoned up, would amount to at least fifteen 
millions, seems reasonably certain j and my own impression is that 
twenty millions would be nearer the mark. It is much to be regretted 
that the exact truth can never be known, for in this age of universal 
slaughter a knowledge of the cash value of the wild game of the United 
States that has been killed up to date might go far toward bringing 
about the actual as well as the theoretical protection of what remains. 

UTILIZATION OF THE BUFFALO BY WHITE MEN. 

Robes. — Ordinarily the skin of a large ruminant is of little value in 
comparison with the bulk of .toothsome flesh it covers. In fattening 
domestic cattle for the market, the value of the hide is so insignificant 
that it amounts to no more than a butcher's perquisite in reckoning 
up the value of the animal. With the buffalo, however, so enormous 
was the waste of the really available product that probably nine-tenths 
of the total value derived from the slaughter of the animal came from 
bis skin alone. Of tbis, about four-fifths came from the utilization of 



442 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

the furry robe and one-fifth from skins classed as " hides," which were 
either taken in the summer season, when the hair was very short or 
almost absent, and used for the manufacture of leather and leather 
goods, or else were the poorly-furred skins of old bulls. 

The season for robe-taking was from October 15 to February 15, and 
a little later in the more northern latitudes. In the United States the 
hair of the buffalo was still rather short up to the first of November; 
but by the middle of November it was about at its finest as to length, 
density, color, and freshness. The Montana hunters considered that 
the finest robes were those taken from November 15 to December 15. 
Before the former date the hair had not quite attaiued perfection in 
length, and after the latter it began to show wear and lose color. 
The winter storms of December and January began to leave their mark 
upon the robes by the 1st of February, chiefly by giving the hair a 
bleached and weathered appearance. By the middle of February the 
pelage was decidedly on the wane, and the robe-hunter was also losing 
his energy. Often, however, the hunt was kept up until the middle of 
March, until either the deterioration of the quality of the robe, the mi- 
gration of the herds northward, or the hunter's longing to return " to 
town" and " 2lean up," brought the hunt to an end. 

On the northern buffalo range, the hunter, or " buffalo skinner," 
removed the robe in the following manner: 

When the operator had to do his work alone, which was almost 
always the case, he made haste to skin his victims while they were yet 
warm, if possible, and before rigor mortis had set in ; but, at all haz- 
ards, before they should become hard frozen. With a warm buffalo he 
could easily do his work single-handed, but with one rigid or frozen 
stiff it was a very different matter. 

His first act was to heave the carcass over until it lay fairly upon its 
back, with its feet up in theair. To keep it in that position he wrenched 
the head violently around to one side, close against the shoulder, at the 
point where the hump was highest and the tendency to roll the greatest, 
and used it very effectually as a chock to keep the body from rolling 
back upon its side. Having fixed the carcass in position he drew forth 
his steel, sharpened his sharp-pointed " ripping-knife," and at once pro- 
ceeded to make all the opening cuts in the skin. Each leg was girdled 
to the bone, about 8 inches above the hoof, and the skin of the leg ripped 
open from that point along the inside to the median line of the body. 
A long, straight cut was then made along the middle of the breast and 
abdomen, from the root of the tail to the chin. In skinning cows and 
young animals, nothing but the skin of the forehead and nose was left 
on the skull, the skin of the throat and cheeks being left on the hide; 
but in skinning old bulls, on whose heads the skin wa,s very thick and 
tough, the whole head was left uuskinned, to save labor and time. The 
skin of the neck was severed in a circle around the neck, just behind 
the ears. It is these huge heads of bushy brown hair, looking, at a lit-

tie distance, quite black, in sharp contrast with the ghastly whiteness 
of the perfect skeletons behind them, which gives such a weird and 
ghostly appearance to the lifeless prairies of Montana where the bone- 
gatherer has not yet done his perfect work. The skulls of the cows and 
young buffaloes are as clean and bare as if they had been carefully 
macerated, and bleached by a skilled osteologist. 

The opening cuts having been made, the broad-pointed "skinning- 
knife" was duly sharpened, and with it the operator fell to work to de- 
tach the skin from the body in the shortest possible time. The tail was 
always skinned and left on the hide. As soon as the skin was taken 
off it was spread out on a clean, smooth, and level spot of ground, and 
stretched to its fullest extent, inside uppermost. On the northern range, 
very few skins were "pegged out," i. c, stretched thoroughly and held 
by means of wooden pegs driven through the edges of the skin into the 
earth. It was practiced to a limited extent on the southern range dur- 
ing the latter part of the great slaughter, when buffaloes were scarce 
and time abundant. Ordinarily, however, there was no time for peg- 
ging, nor were pegs available on the range to do the work with. A 
warm skin stretched on the curly buffalo-grass, hair side down, sticks 
to the ground of itself until it has ample time to harden. On the north- 
ern range the skinner always cut the initials of his outfit in the thin 
subcutaneous muscle which was always found adhering to the skin on 
each side, and which made a permanent and very plain mark of owner- 
ship. 

In the south, the traders who bought buffalo robes on the range 
sometimes rigged up a rude press, with four upright posts and a huge 
lever, in which robes that had been folded into a convenient size were 
pressed into bales, like bales of cotton. These could be transported 
by wagon much more economically than could loose robes. An illus- 
tration of this process is given in an article by Theodore Ii. Davis, en- 
titled "The Buffalo Range," in Harper's Magazine for January, 1869, 
Vol. xxxviii, p. 163. The author describes the process as follows: 

"As the robes are secured, the trader has them arranged in lots of ten 
each, with but little regard for quality other than some care that par- 
ticularly fine robes do not go too many in one lot. These piles are then 
pressed into a compact bale by means of a rudely constructed affair 
composed of saplings and a chain." 

On the northern rauge, skins were not folded until the time came to 
haul them in. Then the hunter repaired to the scene of his winter's 
work, with a wagon surmounted by a hay-rack (or something like it), 
usually drawn by four horses. As the skins were gathered up they 
were folded once, lengthwise down the middle, with the hair inside. 
Sometimes as many as 100 skins were hauled at one load by four horses. 

On one portion of the northern rauge the classification of buffalo pelt- 
ries was substantially as follows: Under the head of robes was included 
all cow skins taken during the proper season, from one year old upward, 



444 ftEPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1387. 

and all bull skins from one to three years old. Bull skins over three 
years of age were classed as hides, and while the best of them were 
finally tanned and used as robes, the really poor ones were converted 
into leather. The large robes, when tanned, were used very generally 
throughout the colder portions of North America as sleigh robes and 
wraps, and for bedding in the regions of extreme cold. The small 
robes, from the young animals, and likewise many large robes, were 
made into overcoats, at once the warmest and the most cumbersome 
that ever enveloped a human being. Thousands of old bull robes were 
tanned with the hair on, and the body portions were made into over- 
shoes, with the woolly hair inside—absurdly large and uncouth, but 
very warm. 

I never wore a pair of buffalo overshoes without being torn by con- 
flicting emotions — mortification at the ridiculous size of my combined 
foot-gear, big boots inside of huge overshoes, and supreme comfort de- 
rived from feet that were always warm. 

Besides the ordinary robe, the hunters and fur buyers of Montana 
recognized four special qualities, as follows: 

The "beaver robe," with exceedingly fine, wavy fur, the color of a 
beaver, and having long, coarse, straight hairs coming through it. The 
latter were of course plucked out in the process of manufacture. These 
were very rare. In 1882 Mr. James McNaney took one, a cow robe, the 
only one out of 1,200 robes taken that season, and sold it for $75, when 
ordinary robes fetched only $3.50. 

The "black-and-tan robe" is described as having the nose, flanks, and 
inside of fore legs black and-tan (whatever that may mean), while the 
remainder of the robe is jet black. 

A "buckskin robe" is from what is always called a "white buffalo/ 7 
and is in reality a dirty cream color instead of white. A robe of this 
character sold in Miles City in 1882 for $200, and was the only one of 
that character taken on the northern range during that entire winter. 
A very few pure white robes have been taken, so I have been told, 
chiefly by Indians, but I have never seen one. 

A "blue robe" or "mouse-colored (?) robe" is one on which the body 
color shows a decidedly bluish cast, and at the same time has long, fine 
fur. Out of his 1,200 robes taken in 1882, Mr. McNaney picked out 12 
which passed muster as the much sought for blue robes, and they sold 
at $16 each. 

As already intimated, the price paid on the range for ordinary buf- 
falo skins varied according to circumstances, and at different periods, 
and in different localities, ranged all the way from 65 cents to $10. The 
latter figure was paid in Texas in 1887 for the last lot of" robes" ever 
taken, The lowest prices ever paid were during the tremendous 
slaughter wnich annihilated the southern herd. Even as late as I.S76, 
in the southern country, cow robes brought on the range only from 65

to 90 cents, and bull robes $1.15. On the northern range, from 1881 to 
1883, the prices paid were much higher, ranging- from $2.50 to $4, 

A few hundred dressed robes still- remain in the hands of some of the 
largest fur dealers in New York, Chicago, and Montreal, which can be 
purchased at prices much lower than one would expect, considering the 
circumstances. In 1888, good robes, Indian tanned, were offered in 
New York at prices ranging from $15 to $30, according to size and qual- 
ity, but in Montreal no first-class robes were obtainable at less than $40. 

Rides. — Next in importance to robes was the class of skins known 
commercially as hides. Under this head were classed all skins which 
for any reason did not possess the pelage necessary to a robe, and were 
therefore fit only for conversion into leather. Of these, the greater por- 
tion consisted of the skins of old bulls on which the hair was of poor 
quality and the skin itself too thick and heavy to ever allow of its being 
made into a soft, pliable, and light-weight robe. The remaining por- 
tion of the hides marketed were from buffaloes killed in spring and sum- 
mer, when the body and hind-quarters were almost naked. Apparently 
the quantity of summer-killed hides marketed was not very great, for 
it was only the meanest and most unprincipled ones of the grand army 
of buffalo-killers who were mean enough to kill buffaloes in summer 
simply for their hides. It is said that at one time summer-killing was 
practiced on the southern range to an extent that became a cause for 
alarm to the great body of more respectable hunters, and the practice 
was frowned upon so severely that the wretches who engaged in itfo-md 
it wise to abandon it. 

Bones. — Next in importance to robes and hides was the bone product, 
the utilization of which was rendered possible by the rigorous climate 
of the buffalo plains. Under the influence of the wind and sun and the 
extremes of heat and cold, the flesh remaining upon a carcass dried up, 
disintegrated, and fell to dust, leaving the bones of almost the entire 
skeleton as clean and bare as if they had been stripped of flesh by 
some powerful chemical process. Very naturally, no sooner did the 
live buffaloes begin to grow scarce than the miles of bleaching bones 
suggested the idea of finding a use for them. A market was readily 
found for them in the East, and the prices paid per ton were sufficient 
to make the business of bone-gathering quite remunerative. The bulk 
of the bone product was converted into phosphate for fertilizing pur- 
poses, but much of it was turned into carbon for use in the refiuing of 
sugar. 

The gathering of bones became a common industry as early as 1872, 
during which year 1,135,300 pounds were shipped over the Atchison, 
Topeka and Santa ¥6 Railroad. In the year following the same road 
shipped 2,743,100 pounds, and in 1874 it handled 6,914,950 pounds more. 
This trade continued from that time on until the plains have beeu 
gleaned so far back from the railway lines that it is no longer profitable 



446 REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

to seek them. For that matter, however, it is said that south of the 
Union Pacific nothing worth the seeking now remains. 

The building of the Northern Pacific Eailway made possible the ship- 
ment of immense quantities of dry bones. Even as late as 1886 over- 
land travelers saw at many of the stations between Jamestown, Da- 
kota, and Billings, Montana, immense heaps of bones lying alongside 
the track awaiting shipment. In 1885 a single firm shipped over 200 
tons of bones from Miles City. 

The valley of the Missouri River was gleaned by teamsters who gath- 
ered bones from as far back as 100 miles and hauled them to the river for 
shipment on the steamers. An operator who had eight wagons in the 
business informed me that in order to ship bones on the river steamers 
it was necessary to crush them, and that for crushed bones, shipped in 
bags, a Michigan fertilizer company paid $18 per ton. Uncrushed 
bones, shipped by the railway, sold for $12 per tou. 

It is impossible to ascertain the total amount or value of the bone 
product, but it is certain that it amounted to many thousand tons, and 
in value must have amounted to some hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
But for the great number of railroads, river steamers, and sea-going 
vessels (from Texas ports) engaged in carrying this product, it would 
have cut an important figure in the commerce of the country, but owiug 
to the many interests between which it was divided it attracted little 
attention. 

Meat. — The amount of fresh buffalo meat cured and marketed was 
really very insignificant. So long as it was to be had at all it was so 
very abundant that it was worth only from 2 to 3 cents per pound in 
the market, and many reasons combined to render the trade in fresh 
buffalo meat anything but profitable. Probably not more than one 
one-thousandth of the buffalo meat that might have been saved and 
utilized was saved. The buffalo carcasses that were wasted on the 
great plains every year during the two great periods of slaughter (of 
the northern and southern herds) would probably have fed to satiety 
during the entire time more than a million persons. 

As to the quality of buffalo meat, it may be stated in general terms 
that it differs in no way whatever from domestic beef of the same age 
produced by the same kind of grass. Perhaps there is no finer grazing 
ground in the world than Montana, and the beef it produces is certainly 
entitled to rank with the best. There are many persons who claim to 
recognize a difference between the taste of buffalo meat and domestic 
beef; but for my part I do not believe any difference really exists, unless 
it is that the flesh of the buffalo is a little sweeter and more juicy. As 
for myself, I feel certain I could not tell the difference between the 
flesh of a three-year old buffalo and that of a domestic beef of the same 
age, nor do I believe any one else could, even on a wager. Having 
once seen a butcher eat an elephant steak in the belief that it was beef 
from his own shop, and another butcher eat loggerhead turtle steak for 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 447 

beef, I have become somewhat skeptical in regard to the intelligence of 
the human palate. 

As a matter of experiment, during our hunt for buffalo we bad buffalo 
meat of all ages, from one year up to eleven, cooked in as many differ- 
ent ways as our culiuary department could turn out. We had it broiled, 
fried with batter, roasted, boiled, and stewed. The last method, when 
employed upon slices of meat that had been hacked from a frozen hind- 
quarter, produced results that were undeniably tough and not partic- 
ularly good. But it was an unfair way to cook any kind of meat, and 
may be guarantied to spoil the finest beef in the world. 

Hump meat from a cow buffalo not too old, cut in slices and fried in 
batter, a la cow-boy, is delicious — a dish fit for the gods. We had 
tongues in plenty, but the ordinary meat was so good they were not 
half appreciated. Of course the tenderloin was above criticism, and 
even the round steaks, so lightly esteemed by the epicure, were tender 
and juicy to a most satisfactory degree. 

It has been said that the meat of the buffalo has a coarser texture 

or " grain" than domestic beef. Although I expected to find such to 

be the case, I found no perceptible difference whatever, nor do I be- 

.lieve that any exists. As to the distribution of fat I am unable to say, 

for the reason that our buffaloes were not fat. 

It is highly probable that the distribution of fat through the meat, so 
characteristic of the shorthorn breeds, and which has been brought 
about only by careful breeding, is not found in either the beef of the 
buffalo or common range cattle. In this respect, shorthorn beef no 
doubt surpasses both the others mentioned, but in all other points, 
texture, flavor, and general tenderness, I am very sure it does not. 

It is a great mistake for a traveler to kill a patriarchal old bull buf- 
falo, and after attempting to masticate a small portion of him to rise 
up and declare that buffalo meat is coarse, tough, and dry. A domestic 
bull of the same age would taste as tough. It is probably only those 
who have had the bad taste to eat bull beef who have ever found occa- 
sion to asperse the reputation of Bison americanus as a beef animal. 

Until people got tired of them, buffalo tongues were in considerable 
demand, and hundreds, if not even thousands, of barrels of them were 
shipped east from the buffalo country. 

Pemmican. — Out of the enormous waste of good buffalo flesh one prod- 
uct stands forth as a redeeming feature — pemmican. Although made 
almost exclusively by the half-breeds and Indians of the Northwest, it con- 
stituted a regular article of commerce of great value to overland travel- 
ers, and was much sought for as long as it was produced. Its peculiar 
" staying powers," due to the process of its manufacture, which yielded 
a most nourishing food in a highly condensed form, made it of inesti- 
mable value to the overland traveler who must travel light or not at all. 
A handful of pemmican was sufficient food to constitute a meal when 
provisions were at all scarce. The price of pemmican in Wiunipeg was 



448 REPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

once as low as 2d. per pound, but in 1883 a very small quantity which 
was brought in sold at 16 cents per pound. This was probably the last 
buffalo peininican made. H. M. Robinson states that in 1878 pemmican 
was worth Is. 3d. per pound. 

The manufacture of pemmican, as performed by the Red River half- 
breeds, was thus described by the Rev. Mr. Bel court, a Catholic priest, 
who once accompanied one of the great buffalo-hunting expeditions : * 

"Other portions which are destined to be made into pimikehigan, or 
pemmican, are exposed to an ardent heat, and thus become brittle and 
easily reducible to small particles by the use of a flail, the buffalo-hide 
answering the purpose of a threshing-floor. The fat or tallow, being 
cut up and melted in large kettles of sheet-iron, is poured upon this 
pounded meat, and the whole mass is worked together with shovels 
until it is well amalgamated, when it is pressed, while still warm, into 
bags made of buffalo skin, which are strongly sewed up, and the mixt- 
ure gradually cools and becomes almost as hard as a rock. If the fat 
used in this process is that taken from the parts containing the udder, 
the meat is called fine pemmican. In some cases, dried fruits, such as the 
prairie j>ear and cherry, are intermixed, which forms what is called seed 
pemmican. The lovers of good eating judge the first described to be very 
palatable; the second, better ; the third, excellent. A taurean of pemmi- 
can weighs from 100 to 110 pounds. Some idea may be formed of the 
immense destruction of buffalo by these people when it is stated that a 
whole cow yields one-half a bag of pemmican and three fourths of a 
bundle of dried meat; so that the most economical calculate that from 
eight to ten cows are required for the load of a single vehicle." 

It is quite evident from the testimony of disinterested travelers that 
ordinary pemmican was not very palatable to one unaccustomed to it as 
a regular article of food. To the natives, however, especially the Ca- 
nadian royageur, it formed one of the most valuable food -products of 
the couutry, and it is said that the demand for it was generally greater 
than the supply. 

Dried, or "jerked" meat. — The most popular and universal method of 
curing buffalo meat was to cut it into thin flakes, an inch or less in 
thickness and of indefinite length, and without salting it in the least 
to hang it over poles, ropes, wicker-frames, or even clumps of standing 
sage brush, and let it dry in the sun. This process yielded the famous 
"jerked " meat so common throughout the West in the early days, from 
the Rio Grande to the Saskatchewan. Father Belcourt thus described 
the curing process as it was practiced by the half-breeds and Indians 
of the Northwest: 

" The meat, when taken to camp, is cut by the women into long strips 
about a quarter of an inch thick, which are hung upon the lattice- work 
prepared for that purpose to dry. This lattice-work is formed of small 
pieces of wood, placed horizontally, transversely, and equidistant from 



* Schoolcraft's History, Condition and Prospects of the Indian Tribes, IV, p. 107, 



THE EXTEKMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 449 

each other, not unlike an immense gridiron, and is supported by wooden 
uprights (trepieds). In a few days the meat is thoroughly desiccated, 
when it is bent into proper lengths and tied into bundles of CO or 70 
pounds weight. This is called dried meat (viande seche). To make the 
hide into parchment (so called) it is stretched on a frame, and then 
scraped on the inside with a piece of sharpened bone and on the out- 
side with a small but sharp-curved iron, proper to remove the hair. 
This is considered, likewise, the appropriate labor of women. The men 
break the bones, which are boiled in water to extract the marrow to be 
used for frying and other culinary purposes. The oil is then poured 
into the bladder of the animal, which contains, when filled, about 12 
pounds, being the yield of the marrow-bones of two buffaloes." 

In the Northwest Territories dried meat, which formerly sold at 2d. 
per pound, was worth in 1878 10c?. per pound. 

Although I have myself prepared quite a quantity of jerked buffalo 
meat, I never learned to like it. Owing to the absence of salt in its 
curing, the dried meat when pounded and made into a stew has a " far 
away" taste which continually reminds one of hoofs and horns. For 
all that, and despite its resemblance in flavor to Liebig's Extract of 
Beef, it is quite good, and better to the taste than ordinary pemmican. 

The Indians formerly cured great quantities of buffalo meat in this 
way — in summer, of course, for use in winter — but the advent of that 
popular institution called "Government beef" long ago rendered it un- 
necessary for the noble red man to exert his squaw in that once 
honorable field of labor. 

During the existence of the buffalo herds a few thrifty and enter- 
prising white men made a business of killing buffaloes in summer and 
drying the meat in bulk, in the same manner which to-day produces 
our popular "dried beef." Mr. Allen states that "a single hunter at 
Hays City shipped annually for some years several hundred barrels 
thus prepared, which the consumers probably bought for ordinary beef." 

Uses of bison's hair. — Numerous attempts have been made to utilize 
the woolly hair of the bison in the manufacture of textile fabrics. As 
early as 1729 Col. William Byrd records the fact that garments were 
made of this material, as follows : 

"The Hair growing upon his Head and Neck is long and Shagged, 
and so Soft that it will spin into Thread not unlike Mohair, and might 
be wove into a sort of Camlet. Some People have Stockings knit of it, 
that would have served an Israelite during his forty Years march thro' 
the Wilderness." * 

In 1637 Thomas Morton published, in his "New English Canaan," 
p. 98,t the following reference to the Indians who live on the south- 
ern shore of Lake Erocoise, supposed to be Lake Ontario : 

"These Beasts [buffaloes, undoubtedly] are of the bignesse of a

Cowe, their flesh being very good foode, their hides good lether, their 
fleeces very usefull, being a kind of wolle, as fine as the wolle of the 
Beaver, and the Salvages doe make garments thereof." 

Professor Allen quotes a number of authorities who have recorded 
statements in regard to the manufacture of belts, garters, scarfs, sacks, 
etc., from buffalo wool by various tribes of Indians.* He also calls at- 
tention to the only determined efforts ever made by white men on a lib- 
feral scale for the utilization of buffalo " wool" and its manufacture into 
cloth, an account of which appears in Boss's "Bed Biver Settlement," 
pp. G9-72. In 1821 some of the more enterprising of the Bed Biver 
(British) colonists conceived the idea of making fortunes out of the 
manufacture of woolen goods from the fleece of the buffalo, and for that 
purpose organized the Buffalo Wool Company, the principal object of 
which was declared to be " to provide a substitute for wool, which sub- 
stitute was to be the wool of the wild buffalo, which was to be collected 
in the plains and manufactured both for the use of the colonists and 
for export." A large number of skilled workmen of various kinds were 
procured from England, and also a plant of machinery and materials. 
When too late, it was found that the supply of buffalo wool obtainable 
was utterly insufficient, the raw wool costing the company Is. Qd. per 
pound, and cloth which iL cost the company £2 10s. per yard to produce 
was worth only 4s. 6$. per yard in England. The historian states that 
universal drunkenness on the part of all concerned aided very mate- 
rially in bringing about the total failure of the enterprise in a very short 
time. 

v While it is possible to manufacture the fine, woolly fur of the bison 
into cloth or knitted garments, provided a sufficient supply of the raw 
material could be obtained (which is and always has been impossible), 
nothing could be more visionary than an attempt to thus produce sal- 
able garments at a profit. 

Articles of wearing apparel made of buffalo's hair are interesting as 
curiosities, for their rarity makes them so, but that is the only end 
they can ever serve so long as there is a sheep living. 

In the National Museum, In the section of animal products, there is 
displayed a pair of stockings made in Canada from the finest buffalo 
wool, from the body of the animal. They are thick, heavy, and full of 
the coarse, straight hairs, which it seems can never be entirely sepa- 
rated from the fine wool. In general texture they are as coarse as the 
coarsest sheep's wool would produce. 

With the above are also displayed a rope-like lariat, made by the 
Comanche Indians, and a smaller braided lasso, seemingly a sample 
more than a full-grown lariat, made by the Otoe Indians of Nebraska. 
Both of the above are made of the long, dark-brown hair of the head 
and shoulders, and in spite of the fact that they have been twisted as

hard as possible, the ends of the hairs protude so persistently that the 
surface of each rope is extremely hairy. 

Buffalo chips — Last, but by no means least in value to the traveler on 
the treeless plains, are the droppings of the buffalo, universally known 
as "buffalo chips." When over one year old and thoroughly dry, 
this material makes excellent fuel. Usually it occurs only where fire- 
wood is unobtainable, and thousands of frontiersmen have a million 
times found it of priceless value. When dry, it catches easily, burns 
readily, and makes a hot fire with but very little smoke, although it is 
rapidly consumed. Although not as good for a fire as even the poorest 
timber it is infinitely better than sage-brush, which, in the absence of 
chips, is often the traveler's last resort. 

It usually happens that chips are most abundant in the sheltered 
creek-bottoms and near the water-holes, the very situations which trav- 
elers naturally select for their camps. In these spots the herds have 
gathered either for shelter in winter or for water in summer, and re- 
mained in a body for some hours. And now, when the cow-boy on the 
round-up, the surveyor, or hunter, who must camp out,, pitches his tent 
in the grassy coulee or narrow creek-bottom, his first care is to start out 
with his largest gunning-bag to "rustle some buffalo chips" for a camp- 
fire. He, at least, when he returns well laden with the spoil of his hum- 
ble chase, still has good reason to remember the departed herd with 
feelings of gratitude. Thus even the last remains of this most useful 
animal are utilized by man in providing for his own imperative wants. 

IX. The Present Value of the Bison to Cattle-Growers. 

The bison in captivity and domestication. — Almost from time imme- 
morial it has been known that the American bison takes kiudly to cap- 
tivity, herds contentedly with domestic cattle, and crosses with them 
with the utmost readiness. It was formerly believed, and indeed the 
tradition prevails even now to quite an extent, that on account of the 
hump on the shoulders a domestic cow could not give birth to a half- 
breed calf. This belief is entirely without foundation, and is due to 
theories rather than facts. 

Numerous experiments in buffalo breeding have been made, and the 
subject is far from being a new one. As early as 1701 the Hugeuot 
settlers at Manikiutown, on the James River, a few miles above Rich- 
mond, began to domesticate buffaloes. It is also a matter of historical 
record that in 1786, or thereabouts, buffaloes were domesticated and 
bred in captivity in Virginia, and Albert Gallatin states that in some 
of the northwestern counties the mixed breed was quite common. In 
1815 a series of elaborate and valuable experiments in cross-breeding 
the buffalo and domestic cattle was begun by Mr. Robert Wicklilfe, of 
Lexington, Ky., and continued by him for upwards of thirty years.* 



* For a full account of Mr. Wickliffe's experiments, written by himself, see Audu- 
bon and Bucnniau's " Quadrupeds of North America," vol. n, pp. 52-54, 



452 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

Quite recently the buffalo-breeding operations of Mr. S. L. Bedson, of 
Stony Mountain, Manitoba, and Mr. 0. J. Jones, of Garden City, Kans., 
have attracted much attention, particularly for the reason that the 
efforts of both these gentlemen have been directed toward the practical 
improvement of the present breeds of range cattle. For this reason the 
importance of the work in which they are engaged can hardly be over- 
estimated, and the results already obtained by Mr. Bedson, whose ex- 
periments antedate those of Mr. Jones by several years, are of the 
greatest interest to western cattle- growers. Indeed, unless the stock 
of pure-blood buffaloes now remaining proves insufficient for the pur- 
pose, I fully believe that we will gradually see a great change wrought 
in the character of western cattle by the introduction of a strain of 
buffalo blood. 

The experiments which have been made thus far prove conclusively 
that — 

(1) The male bison crosses readily with the opposite sex of domestic 
cattle, but a buffalo cow has never been known to produce a half-breed 
calf. 

(2) The domestic cow produces a half-breed calf successfully. 

(3) The progeny of the two species is fertile to any extent, yielding 
half-breeds, quarter, three-quarter breeds, and so on. 

(4) The bison breeds in captivity with perfect regularity and success. 
Need of an improvement in range cattle. — Ever since the earliest days 

of cattle-ranching in the West, stockmen have had it in their power to 
produce a breed which would equal in beef-bearing qualities the best 
breeds to be found upon the plains, and be so much better calculated 
to survive the hardships of winter, that their annual losses would have 
been very greatly reduced. Whenever there is an unusually severe 
winter, such as comes about three times in every decade, if not even 
oftener, range cattle perish by thousands. It is an absolute impossi- 
bility for every ranchman who owns several thousand, or even several 
hundred, head of cattle to provide hay for them, even during the severest 
portion of the winter season, and consequently the cattle must depend 
wholly upon their own resources. When the winter is reasonably mild, 
and the snows never very deep, nor lying too long at a time on the 
ground, the cattle live through the winter with very satisfactory suc- 
cess. Thanks to the wind, it usually happens that the falling snow is 
blown off the ridges as fast as it falls, leaving the grass sufficiently un- 
covered for the cattle to feed upon it. If the snow-fall is universal, but 
not more than a few inches in depth, the cattle paw through it here and 
there, and eke out a subsistence, on quarter rations it may be, until a 
friendly chinook wind sets in from the southwest and dissolves the snow 
as if by magic in a few hours' time. 

But when" a deep snow comes, and lies on the ground persistently, 
week in and week out, when the warmth of the sun softens and moist- 
ens its surface sufficiently for a returning cold wave to freeze it into a. 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 455 

hard crust, forming a universal wall of ice between the luckless steer 
and his only food, the cattle starve and freeze in immense numbers. 
Being totally unfitted by nature to survive such unnatural conditions, 
it is not strange that they succumb. 

Under present conditions the stockman simply stakes his cattle against 
the winter elements and takes his chances on the results, which are gov- 
erned by circumstances wholly beyond his control. The losses of the 
fearful winter of 1886-'87 will probably never be forgotten by the cattle- 
men of the great Western grazing ground. In many portions of Mon- 
tana and Wyoming the cattlemen admitted a loss of 50 per cent, of 
their cattle, and in some localities the loss was still greater. The same 
conditions are liable to prevail next winter, or any succeeding winter, 
and we may yet see more than half the range cattle in the West perish 
in a single month. 

Yet all this time the cattlemen have had it in their power, by the 
easiest and simplest method in the world, to introduce a strain of 
hardy native blood in their stock which would have made it capable of 
successfully resisting a much greater degree of hunger and cold. It is 
really surprising that the desirability of cross-breeding the buffalo and 
domestic cattle should for so long a time have been either overlooked 
or disregarded. While cattle-growers generally have shown the great- 
est enterprise in producing special breeds for milk, for butter, or for 
beef, cattle with short horns and cattle with no horns at all, only two 
or three men have had the enterprise to try to produce a breed par- 
ticularly hardy and capable. 

A buffalo can weather storms and outlive hunger and cold which 
would kill any domestic steer that ever lived. When nature placed 
him on the treeless and blizzard- swept plains, she left him well equip- 
ped to survive whatever natural conditions he would have to encounter. 
The most striking feature of his entire tout ensemble is his magnificent 
suit of hair and fur combined, the warmest covering possessed by any 
quadruped save the musk-ox. The head, neck, and fore quarters are 
clothed with hide and hair so thick as to be almost, if not entirely, im- 
pervious to cold. The hair on the body and hind quarters is long, fine, 
very thick, and of that peculiar woolly quality which constitutes the 
best possible protection against cold. Let him who doubts the warmth 
of a good buffalo robe tuy to weather a blizzard with something else, 
and then try the robe. The very form of the buffalo — short, thick legs, 
and head hung very near the ground — suggests most forcibly a special 
fitness to wrestle with mother earth for a living, snow or no snow. A 
buffalo will flounder for days through deep snow-drifts without a mor- 
sel of food, and survive where the best range steer would literally freeze 
on foot, bolt upright, as hundreds did in the winter of lS86-'87. While 
range cattle turn tail to a blizzard and drift helplessly, the buffalo faces 
it every time, and remains master of the situation. 

It has for years been a surprise to me that Western stockmen have 



454 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 188?. 

not seized upon the opportunity presented by the presence of the buf- 
falo to improve the character of their cattle. £Tow that there are no 
longer any buffalo calves to be had on the plains for the trouble of 
catching them, and the few domesticated buffaloes that remain are 
worth fabulous prices, we may expect to see a great deal of interest 
manifested in this subject, and some costly efforts made to atone for 
previous lack of forethought. 

The character of the buffalo — domestic hybrid. — The subjoined illus- 
tration from a photograph kindly furnished by Mr. C. J. Jones, repre- 
sents a ten months' old half-breed calf (male), the product of a buffalo 
bull and domestic cow. The prepotency of the sire is apparent at the 
first glance, and to so marked an extent that the illustration would 
pass muster anywhere as having been drawn from a full-blood buffalo. 
The head, neck, and hump, and the long woolly hair that covers them, 
proclaim the buffalo in every line. Excepting that the hair on the 
shoulders (below the hump) is of the same length as that on the body 
and hind quarters, there is, so far as one can judge from an excellent 
photograph, no difference whatever observable between this lusty young 
half-breed and a full-blood buffalo calf of the same age and sex. Mr. 
Jones describes the color of this animal as "iron-gray," and remarks: 
"You will see how even the fur is, being as long on the hind parts as 
on the shoulders and neck, very much unlike the buffalo, which is so 
shaggy about the shoulders and so thin farther back." Upon this 
point it is to be remarked that the hair on the body of a yearling or 
two-year-old buffalo is always very much longer in proportion to the 
hair on the forward parts than it is later in life, and while the shoulder 
hair is always decidedly longer than that back of it, during the first 
two years the contrast is by no means so very great. A reference to 
the memoranda of hair measurements already given will afford precise 
data on this point. 

In regard to half-breed calves, Mr. Bedson states in a private letter 
that "the hump does not appear until several months after birth." 

Altogether, the male calf described above so strongly resembles a 
pure-blood buffalo as to be generally mistaken for one; the form of the 
adult half-blood cow promptly proclaims her origin. The accompanying 
plate, also from a ohotograph supplied by Mr. Jones, accurately repre- 
sents a half-breed cow, six years old, weighing about 1,800 pounds. 
Her body is very noticeably larger in proportion than that of the cow 
buffalo, her pelvis much heavier, broader, and more cow-like, therein 
being a decided improvement upon the small and weak hind quarters 
of the wild species. The hump is quite noticeable, but is not nearly 
so high as in the pure buffalo cow. The hair on the fore quarters, neck, 
and head is decidedly shorter, especially ou the head ; the frontlet and 
chin beard being conspicuously lacking. The tufts of long, coarse, 
black hair which clothe the fore-arm of the buffalo cow are almost ab- 
sent, but apparently the hair on the body and hind quarters has lost

but little, if any, of its length, density, and fine, furry quality. The 
horns are decidedly cow-like in their size, length, and curvature. 

Begarding the general character of the half-breed buffalo, and his 
herd in general, Mr. Bedson writes ine as follows, in a letter dated 
September 12, 1888 : 

"The nucleus of my herd consisted of a young buffalo bull and four 
heifer calves, which I purchased in 1877, and the increase from these 
few has been most rapid, as will be shown by a tabular statement far- 
ther on. 

"Success with the breeding of the pure buffalo was followed by ex- 
periments in crossing with the domestic animal. This crossing has 
generally been between a buffalo bull and an ordinary cow, and with 
the most encouraging results, since it had been contended by many that 
although the cow might breed a calf from the buffalo, yet it would be at 
the expense of her life, owing to the hump on a buffalo's shoulder; but 
this hum]) does not appear until several months after birth. This has 
been proved a fallacy respecting this herd at least, for calving has been 
attended with no greater percentage of losses than would be experienced 
in ranching with the ordinary cattle. Buffalo cows and crosses have 
dropped calves at as low a temperature as 20° below zero, and the 
calves were sturdy and healthy. 

"The half breed resulting from the cross as above mentioned has 
been again crossed with the thoroughbred buffalo bull, producing a 
three quarter breed animal closely resembling the buffalo, the head and 
robe being quite equal, if not superior. The half-breeds are very prolific. 
The cows drop a calf annually. They are also very hardy indeed, as 
they take the instinct of the buffalo during the blizzards and storms, 
and do not drift like native cattle. They remain upon the open prairie 
during our severest winters, while the thermometer ranges from 30 to 
40 degrees below zero, with little or no food except what they rustled on 
the prairie, and no shelter at all. In nearly all fche ranching parts of 
North America foddering and housing of cattle is imperative in a more 
or less degree,* creating an item of expense felt by all interested in cattle- 
raising; but the buffalo [half] breed retains all its native hardihood, 
needs no housing, forages in the deepest snows for its own food, yet be- 
comes easily domesticated, and consequently needs but little herding. 
Therefore the progeny of the buffalo is easily reared, cheaply fed, and 
requires no housing in winter; three very essential points in stock- 
raising. 

" They are always in good order, and I consider the meat of the half- 
breed much preferable to domestic animals, while the robe is very fine 
indeed, the fur being evened-up on the hind parts, the same as on the 
shoulders. During the history of the herd, accident and other causes 
have compelled the slaughtering of one or two, and in these instances

sible, and is not even attempted. — W. T. H. 



456 report of national museum, 1887. 

the carcasses have sold for 18 cents per pound ; the hides in their dressed 
state for $50 to $75 each. A half-breed buffalo ox (four years old, crossed 
with buffalo bull and Durham cow) was killed last winter, aud weighed 
1,280 pounds dressed beef. One pure buffalo bull now in my herd Weighs 
fully 2,000 pounds, aud a [halfjbreed bull 1,700 to 1,800 pounds. 

"The three-quarter breed is an enormous animal in size, and has an 
extra good robe, which will readily bring $40 to $50 in any market where 
there is a demand for robes. They are also very prolific, and I consider 
them the coming cattle for our range cattle for the Northern climate, 
while the half and quarter breeds will be the animals for the more 
Southern district. The half and three-quarter breed cows, when really 
matured, will weigh from 1,400 to 1,800 pounds. 

"I have never crossed them except with a common grade of cows, 
while I believe a cross with the Galloways would produce the handsom- 
est robe ever handled, and make the best range cattle in the world. I 
have not had time to give my attention to my herd, more than to let 
them range on the prairies at will. By proper care great results can be 
accomplished." 

Hon. O. J. Jones, of Garden City, Kans., whose years of experience 
with the buffalo, both as old-time hunter, catcher, and breeder, has earned 
for him the sobriquet of "Buffalo Jones," five years ago became deeply 
interested in the question of improving range cattle by crossing with 
the buffalo. With characteristic Western energy he has pursued the 
subject from that time until the present, having made five trips to the 
range of the only buffaloes remaining from the great southern herd, and 
captured sixty-eight buffalo calves and eleven adult cows with which to 
start a herd. In a short article published in the Farmers' Beview 
(Chicago, August 22, 1888), Mr. Jones gives his views on the value of 
the buffalo in cross-breeding as follows : 

" In all my meanderings I have not found a place but I could count 
more carcasses [of cattle] than living animals. Who has not ridden 
over some of the Western railways and counted dead cattle by the thou- 
sands ? The great question is, Where can we get a race of cattle that will 
stand blizzards, and endure the drifting suow, aud will not be driven 
with the storms against the railroad fences and pasture fences, there to 
perish for the want of nerve to face the northern winds for a few miles? 
to where the winter grasses could be had in abundance? Realizing these 
facts, both from observation and pocket, we pulled on our ' thinking cap,' 
and these points came vividly to our mind : 

" (1) We want an animal that is hardy. 

" (2) We want an animal with nerve and endurance. 

" (3) We want an animal that faces the blizzards and endures the 
storms. 

" (4) We want an animal that will rustle the prairies, and not yield 
to discouragement.

" (5) We want an animal that will fill the above bill, and make good 
beef and plenty of it. 

"All the points above could easily be found in the buffalo, excepting 
the fifth, and even that is more than filled as to the quality, but not in 
quantity. Where is the 'old timer' who has not had a cut from the 
hump or sirloin of a fat buffalo cow in the fall of the year, and where is 
the one who will not make affidavit that it was the best meat he ever 
ate ? Yes, the fat was very rich, equal to the marrow from the bone of 
domestic cattle. *- * * 

" The great question remained unsolved as to the quantity of meat 
from the buffalo. I finally heard of a half-breed buffalo in Colorado, 
and immediately set out to find it. I traveled at least 1,000 miles to 
find it, and found a five-year-old half-breed cow that had been bred to 
domestic bulls and had brought forth two calves — a yearling and a 
sucking calf that gave promise of great results. 

" The cow had never beeu fed, but depended altogether on the range, 
and when I saw her, in the fall of 1885, 1 estimated her weight at 1,800 
pounds. She was a brindle, and had a handsome robe even in Septem- 
ber; she had as good hind quarters as ordinary cattle; her fore parts were 
heavy and resembled the buffalo, yet not near so much of the hump. 
The offspring showed but very little of the buffalo, yet they possessed a 
woolly coat, which showed clearly that they were more than domestic 
cattle. * * * 

" What we can rely on by having one-fourth, one-half, and three- 
fourths breeds might be analyzed as follows : 

■ " We can depend upon a race of cattle unequaled in the world for 
hardiness and durability ; a good meat-bearing animal; the best and 
only fur-bearing animal of the bovine race ; the animal always found in 
a storm where it is overtaken by it ; a race of cattle so clannish as never 
to separate aud go astray ; the animal that can always have free range, 
as they exist where no other animal can live ; the animal that can water 
every third day and keep fat, ranging from 20 to 30 miles from water; 
in fact, they are the perfect animal for the plains of North America. 
Oue-fourth breeds for Texas, one-half breeds for Colorado and Kansas, 
and three-fourths breeds for more northern country, is what will soon 
be sought after more than any living animal. Then we will never be 
confronted with dead carcarsses from starvation, exhaustion, and lack of 
nerve, as in years gone by." 

The bison as a beast of burden. — On account of the abundance of horses 
for all purposes throughout the entire country, oxen aresoseldem used 
they almost constitute a curiosity. There never has existed a necessity 
to break buffaloes to the yoke and work them like domestic oxeu, and 
so few experiments have been made iu this direction that reliable data 
on this subject is almost wholly wanting. While at Miles City, Mont., 
I heard of a German "granger" who worked a small farm in the 
Tongue Eiver Valley, and who once had a pair of cow buffaloes trained 



458 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

to the yoke. It was said that they were strong, rapid walkers, and 
capable of performing as much work as the best domestic oxen, but 
they were at times so uncontrollably headstrong and obstinate as to 
greatly detract from their usefulness. The particular event of their 
career on which their historian dwelt with special interest occurred 
when their owner was hauling a load of potatoes to town with them. 
In the course of the long drive the buffaloes grew very thirsty, and 
upon coming within sight of the water in the river they started for it 
in a straight course. The shouts and blows of the driver only served to 
hasten their speed, and presently, when they reached the edge of the high 
bank, they plunged down it without the slightest hesitation, wagon, 
potatoes, and all, to the loss of everything except themselves and the 
drink they went after ! 

Mr. Eobert Wickliffe states that trained buffaloes make satisfactory 
oxen. " I have broken them to the yoke, and found them capable of 
making excellent oxen ; and for drawing wagons, carts, or other heavily 
laden vehicles on long journeys they would, I think, be greatly prefer- 
able to the common ox." 

It seems probable that, in the absence of horses, the buffalo would 
make a much more speedy and enduring draught animal than the domes- 
tic ox, although it is to be doubted whether he would be as strong. His 
weaker pelvis and hind quarters would surely count against him under 
certain circumstances, but for some purposes his superior speed and en- 
durance would more than counterbalance that defect.

Bedsou purchased 5 buffalo calves, 1 bull, and 4 heifers, for which he 
paid $1,000. In 1888 his herd consisted of 23 full-blood bulls, 35 cows, 
3 half-breed cows, 5 half-breed bulls, and 17 calves, mixed and pure;* 
making a total of 83 head. These were all produced from the original 
5, no purchases having been made, nor any additions made in any other 
way. Besides the 83 head constituting the herd when it was sold, 5 
were killed and 9 given away, which would otherwise make a total of 
97 head produced since 1877. In November, 1888, this entire herd was 
purchased, for $50,000, by Mr. O. J. Jones, and added to the already 
large herd owned by that gentleman in Kansas.

reason to believe is very near the truth.

lassoed, and tied with his own hands. For the last five years Mr. Jones 
has made an annual trip, in June, to the uninhabited "panhandle" of 
Texas, to capture calves out of the small herd of from one hundred to 
two hundred head which represented the last remnant of the great 
southern herd. Each of these expeditions involved a very considerable 
outlay in money, an elaborate "outfit" of men, horses, vehicles, camp 
equipage, and lastly, but most important of all, a herd of a dozen fresh 
milch cows to nourish the captured calves and keep them from dying 
of starvation and thirst. The region visited was fearfully barren, al- 
most without water, and to penetrate it was always attended by great 
hardship. The buffaloes were difficult to find, but the ground was good 
for running, being chiefly level plains, and the superior speed of the 
running horses always enabled the hunters to overtake a herd when- 
ever one was sighted, and to " cut out" and lasso two, three, or four of 
its calves. Tbe degree of skill and daring displayed in these several 
expeditious are worthy of the highest admiration, and completely sur- 
pass anything I have ever seen or read of being accomplished in con- 
nection with hunting, or the capture of live game. The latest feat of 
Mr. Jones and his party comes the nearest to being incredible. During 
the month of May, 1888, they not only captured seven calves, but also 
eleven adult cows, of which some were lassoed in full career on the prai- 
rie, thrown, tied, and hobbled ! The majority, however, were actually 
" rounded up," herded, and held in control until a bunch of tame buf- 
faloes was driven down to meet them, so that it would thus be possible 
to drive all together to a rancb. This brilliant feat can only be ap- 
preciated as it deserves by those who have lately hunted buffalo, and 
learned by dear experience the extent of their wariness, and the diffi- 
culties, to say nothing of the dangers, inseparably connected with their 
pursuit. 

The result of each of Mr. Jones's five expeditions is as follows : In 
1884 no calves found; 1885, 11 calves captured, 5 died, 6 survived ; 1886, 
14 calves captured, 7 died, 7 survived ; 1887, 36 calves captured, 6 died, 
30 survived ; 1888, 7 calves captured, all survived ; 1888, 11 old cows 
captured, all survived. Total, 79 captures, 18 losses, 57 survivors. 

The census of the herd is exactly as follows : Adult cows, 11; three- 
year olds, 7, of which 2 are males and 5 females; two-year olds, 4, of 
which all are males ; yearling, 28, of which 15 are males and 13 females ; 
calves, 7, of which 3 are ?nales and 4 females. Total herd, 57 ; 24 males 
and 33 females. To this,- Mr. Jones's original herd, must now be added 
the entire herd formerly owned by Mr. Bedson. 

Eespecting his breeding operations Mr. Jones writes : " My oldest 
[bull] buffaloes are now three years old, and I am breeding one hundred 
domestic cows to them this year. Am breeding the Galloway cows quite 
extensively; also some Shorthoims, Herefords, and Texas cows. I expect 
best results from the Galloways. If I can get the black luster of the 



460 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 188?. 

latter and the far of a buffalo, I will have a robe that will bring more 
money than we get for the average range steer." 

In November, 1888, Mr. Jones purchased Mr. Bedson's entire herd, 
and in the following mouth proceeded to ship a portion of it to Kansas 
City. Thirty- three head were separated from the remainder of the herd 
on the prairie near Stony Mountain, 12 miles from Winnipeg, and 
driven to the railroad. Several old bulls broke away en route and ran 
back to the herd, and when the remainder were finally corraled in the 
pens at the stock-yards "they began to fight among themselves, and 
some fierce encounters were waged between the old bulls. The younger 
cattle were raised on the horns of their seniors, thrown in the air, and 
otherwise gored." While on the way to St. Paul three of the half-breed 
buffaloes were killed by their companions. On reaching Kansas City 
and unloading the two cars, 13 head broke away from the large force 
of men that attempted to manage them, stampeded through the city, 
and finally took refuge in the low-lands along the river. In due time, 
however, all were recaptured. 

Since the acquisition of this northern herd and the subsequent press 
comment that it has evoked, Mr. Jones has been almost overwhelmed 
with letters of inquiry in regard to the whole subject of buffalo breed- 
ing, and has found it necessary to print and distribute a circular giving 
answers to the many inquiries that have been made. 

Herd of Mr. Charles Allard, Flathead Indian Reservation, Montana. — 
This herd was visited in the autumn of 1888 by Mr. G-. O. Shields, of 
Chicago^ who reports that it consists of thirty-five head of pure-blood 
buffaloes, of which seven are calves of 1888, six are yearlings, and six 
are two-year olds. Of the adult animals, four cows and two bulls are 
each fourteen years old, " and the beards of the bulls almost sweep the 
ground as they walk." 

Herd of Hon. W. F. Cody {"Buffalo Bill ").— The celebrated " Wild West 
Show" has, ever since its organization, numbered amongst its leading 
attractions a herd of live buffaloes of all ages. At present this herd 
contains eighteen head, of which fourteen were originally purchased of 
Mr. H. T. Groome, of Wichita, Kansas, and have made a journey to 
London and back. As a proof of the indomitable persistence of the 
bison in breeding under most unfavorable circumstances, the fact that 
four of the members of this herd are calves which were born in 1888 in 
London, at the American Exposition, is of considerable interest. 

This herd is now (December, 188S) being wintered on General Beale's 
farm, near the city of Washington. In 1886-'S7, while the Wild West 
Show was at Madison Square Garden, New York City, its entire herd of 
twenty buffaloes was carried off by pleuro-pneumonia. It is to be greatly 
feared that sooner or later in the course of its travels the present herd 
will also disappear, either through disease or accident.

writes that he has "been breeding buffaloes in a small way for the past

ten years," but without giving any particular attention to it. At pres- 
ent his herd consists of thirteen head, of which two are three-year old 
bulls and four are calves. There are seven cows of all ages, one of which 
is a half-breed. 

Herd at the Zoological Society's Gardens, Philadelphia, Arthur E. 
Brown, superintendent. — This institution is the fortunate possessor of a 
small herd of ten buffaloes, of which four are males and six females. 
Two are calves of 1877. In 1886 the Gardens sold an adult bull and cow 
to Hon. W. F. Cody for $300. 

Herd at Bismarck Grove, Kansas, owned by the Atchison, Topeka and 
Santa Fe Railroad Company. — A small herd of buffaloes has for several 
years past been kept at Bismarck Grove as an attraction to visitors. At 
present it contains ten head, one of which is a very large bull, another 
in a four-year-old bull, six are cows of various ages, and two are two- 
year olds. In 1885 a large bull belonging to this herd grew so vicious 
and dangerous that it was necessary to kill him. 

The following interesting account of this herd was published in the 
Kansas City Times of December 8, 1888: 

"Thirteen years ago Colonel Stanton purchased a buffalo bull calf 
for $8 and. two heifers for $25. The descendants of these three buffa- 
loes now found at Bismarck Grove, where all were born, number in all 
ten. There were seventeen, but the rest have died, with the exception 
of one, which was given away. They are kept in an inclosure containing 
about 30 acres immediately adjoining the park, and there may be seen 
at any time. The sight is one well worth a trip and the slight expense 
that may attach to it, especially to one who has never seen the Ameri- 
can bison in his native state. 

" The present herd includes two fine bull calves dropped last spring, 
two heifers, five cows, and a bull six years old and as handsome as a 
picture. The latter has been named Cleveland, after the colonel's favor- 
ite Presidential candidate. The entire herd is in as fine condition as 
any beef cattle, though they were never fed anything but hay and are 
never ffiven any shelter. In fact they don't take kindly to shelter, aud 
whether a blizzard is blowing, with the mercury 20 degrees below zero, 
or the sun pouring down his scorching rays, with the thermometer 110 
degrees above, they set their heads resolutely toward storm or sun and 
take their medicine as if they liked it. Hon. W. F. Cody, " Buffalo Bill," 
tried to buy the whole herd two years ago to take to Europe with his 
Wild West Show, but they were not for sale at his own figures, and, in- 
deed, there is no anxiety to dispose of them at any figures. The rail- 
load company has been glad to furnish them pasturage for the sake of 
adding to the attractions of the park, in which there are also forty-three 
head of deer, iucluding two as fine bucks as ever trotted over the national 
deer trail toward the salt-licks in northern Utah. 

" While the bison at Bismark Grove are splendid specimens of their 
class, u Cleveland" is decidedly the pride of the herd, and as grand a.

creature as ever trod the soil of Kansas on four legs. He is just six 
years old and is a perfect specimen of the kings of the plains. There is 
royal blood in his veins, and his coat is finer than the imperial purple. 
It is not possible to get at him to measure his stature and weight. He 
must weigh fully 3,000 pounds, and it is doubtful if there is to-day living 
on the face of the earth a handsomer buffalo bull than he. "Cleveland's" 
disposition is not so ugly as old Barney's was, but at certain seasons he 
is very wild, and there is no one venturesome enough to go into the in- 
closure. It is then not altogether safe to even look over the high and 
heavy board fence at him, for he is likely to make a run for the visitor, 
as the numerous holes in the fence where he has knocked off the boards 
will testify." 

Herd of Mr. Frederick Dupree, Cheyenne Indian Agency, near Fort 
Bennett, Dakota. — This herd contains at present nine pure-blood buf- 
faloes, five of which are cows and seven mixed bloods. Of the former, 
there are two adult bulls and four adult cows. Of the mixed blood 
animals, six are half-breeds and one a quarter-breed buffalo. 

Mr. Dupree obtained the nucleus of his herd in 1882, at which time 
he captured five wild calves about 100 miles west of Fort Bennett. Of 
these, two died after two months of captivity and a third was killed by 
an Indian in 1885. 

Mr. D. F. Carlin, of the Indian service, at Fort Bennett, has kindly 
furnished me the following information respecting this herd, under 
date of November 1, 1888 : 

"The animals composing this herd are all in fine condition and are 
quite tame. They keep by themselves most of the time, except the 
oldest bull (six years old), who seems to appreciate the company of do- 
mestic cattle more than that of his own family. Mr. Dupree has kept 
one half-breed bull as an experiment; he thinks it will produce a hardy 
class of cattle. His half-breeds are all black, with one exception, and 
that is a roan ; but they are all built like the buffalo, and when young 
they grunt more like a hog than like a calf, the same as a full-blood 
buffalo. 

" Mr. Dupree has never lost a [domestic] cow in giving birth to a half- 
breed calf, as was supposed by many people would be the case. There 
have been no sales from this herd, although the owner has a standing 
offer of $650 for a cow and bull. The cows are not for sale at any price. 

Herd at Lincoln Pari; Chicago, Mr. W. P. Walker, superintendent. — 
This very interesting and handsomely-kept herd is composed of seven 
individuals of the following character: One bull eight years old, one 
bull four years old, two cows eight years old, two cows two years old 
in the spring of 1888, and one 9 calf born in the spring of 18S8. 

Zoological Gardens, Cincinnati, Ohio. — This collection contains four 
bison, an adult bull and cow, and one immature specimen. 

Dr. V. T. McGillicuddy, Rapid City, Daltota, has a herd of four pure 
buffaloes and one half-breed, Of the former, the two adults, a bull and

cow seven years old, were caught by Sioux Indians near the Black Hills 
for the owner in the spring of 1882. The Indians drove two milch cows 
to the range to nourish the calves wheu caught. These have produced 
two calves, one of which, a bull, is now three years old, and the other 
is a yearling heifer. 

Central Park Menagerie, New York, Dr. W. A. Conklin, director. — This 
much-visited collection contains four bison, an adult bull and cow, a

buffaloes at this summer resorc. 

The U. 8. National Museum, Washington, District of Columbia. — The 
collection of the department of living animals at this institution con- 
tains two tine young buffaloes; a bull four years old in July, 1888, and 
a cow three years old in May of the same year. These animals were cap- 
tured in western Nebraska, when they were calves, by H. R. Jackett, 
of Ogalalla, and kept by him on his ranch until 1888. In April, 1888, 
Hon. Eugene G. Blackford, of New York, rjurchased them of Mr. Fred- 
erick D. Nowell, of North Platte, Nebraska, for $400 for the pair, and 
presented them to the National Museum, in the hope that they might 
form the nucleus of- a herd to be owned and exhibited by the United 
States Government in or near the' city of Washington. The two ani- 
mals were received in Ogalalla by Mr. Joseph Palmer, of the National 
Museum, and by bim they were brought on to Washington in May, in 
fine condition. Since their arrival they have been exhibited to the 
public in a temporary inclosure on the Smithsonian Grounds, and have 
attracted much attention. 

Mr. B. C. Winston, of Hamline, Minnesota, owns a pair of buffaloes, 
one of which, a young bull, was caught by him in western Dakota in 
the spring of 1886, soon after its birth. The cow was purchased at 
Rosseau, Dakota Territory, a year later, for $225. 

Mr. I. P. Butler, of Colorado, Texas, is the owner of a young bull buf- 
falo and a half-breed calf. 

Mr. Jesse Huston, of Miles City, Montana, owns a fine five-year-old 
bull buffalo. 

Mr. L. F. Gardner, of Bellwood, Oregon, is the owner of a large adult 
bull. 

Tke Riverside Ranch Company, south of Mandan, Dakota, owns a pair 
of full-blood buffaloes. 

In Dakota^ in the hands of parties unknown, there are four full- blood 
buffaloes. 

Mr. James R. Hitch, of Optima, Indian Territory, has a pair of young 
buffaloes, which he has offered for sale for $750. 

Mr. Joseph A. Hudson, of Estell, Nebraska, owns a three-year-old bull 
buffalo, which is for sale.

There are, without doubt, a few half-breeds in Manitoba of which I 
have no account. It is probable there are also a very few more captive 
buffaloes scattered singly here aud there which will be heard of later, 
but the total will be a very small number, I am sure. 

PART II.— THE EXTERMINATION. 

I. Causes of the Extermination. 

The causes which led to the practical extinction (in a wild state, at 
least) of the most economically valuable wild animal that ever inhab- 
ited the American continent, are by no means obscure. It is well that 
we should know precisely what they were, and by the sad fate of the 
buffalo be warned in time against allowing similar causes to produce 
the same results with our elk, antelope, deer, moose, caribou, mountain 
sheep, mountain goat, walrus, and other animals. It will be doubly 
deplorable if the remorseless slaughter we have witnessed during the 
last twenty years carries with it no lessons for the future. A continu- 
ation of the record we have lately made as wholesale game butchers 
will justify posterity in dating us back with the mound-builders and 
cave-dwellers, when man's only known function was to slay and eat. 

The primary cause of the buffalo's extermination, and the one which 
embraced all others, was the descent of civilization, with all its ele- 
ments of destructiveness, upon the whole of the country inhabited 
by that animal. From the Great Slave Lake to the Rio Grande the 
home of the buffalo was everywhere overrun by the man with a gun; 
and, as has ever been the case, the wild creatures were gradually swept 
away, the largest aud most conspicuous forms being the first to go. 

The secondary causes of the extermination of the buffalo may be 
catalogued as follows : 

(1) Man's reckless greed, his wanton destructiveness, and improvi- 
dence in not husbanding such resources as come to him from the hand of 
nature ready made. 

(2) The total and utterly inexcusable absence of protective measures 
and agencies on the part of the National Government and of the West- 
ern States and Territories. 

(3) The fatal preference on the part of hunters generally, both white 



THE EXTEEMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 465 

and red, for the robe and flesh of the cow over that furnished by the 
bull. 

(4) The phenomenal stupidity of the animals themselves, and their 
indifference to man. 

(5) The perfection of modern breech-loading rifles and other sporting 
fire-arms in general. 

Each of these causes acted against the buffalo with its full force, to 
offset which there was not even one restraining or preserving influence, 
and it is not to be wondered at that the species went down before them. 
Had any one of these conditions been eliminated the result would have 
been reached far less quickly. Had the buffalo, for example, possessed 
one-half the fighting qualities of the grizzly bear he would have fared 
very differently, but his inoffensiveness and lack of courage almost 
leads one to doubt the wisdom of the economy of nature so far as it 
relates to him. 

II. Methods of Slaughter. 

1. The still-hunt. — Of all the deadly methods of buffalo slaughter, the 
still-hunt was the deadliest. Of all the methods that were unsports- 
manlike, unfair, ignoble, and utterly reprehensible, this was in every 
respect the lowest and the worst. Destitute of nearly every element 
of the buoyant excitement and spice of danger that accompanied genu- 
ine buffalo hunting on horseback, the still-hunt was mere butchery of 
the tamest and yet most cruel kind. About it there was none of the 
true excitement of the chase; but there was plenty of greedy eagerness 
to " down" as many u head" as possible every day, just as there is in 
every slaughter-house where the killers are paid so much per head. 
Judging from all accounts, it was about as exciting and dangerous work 
as it would be to go out now and shoot cattle on the Texas or Moptana 
ranges. The probabilities are, however, that shooting Texas cattle 
would be the most dangerous ; for, instead of running from a man on 
foot, as the buffalo used to do, range cattle usually charge down upon 
him, from motives of curiosity, perhaps, and not infrequently place his 
life in considerable jeopardy. 

The buffalo owes his extermination very largely to his own unparalleled 
stupidity ; for nothing else could by any possibility have enabled the 
still- hunters to accomplish what they did in such an incredibly short 
time. So long as the chase on horseback was the order of the day, it 
ordinarily required the united efforts of from fifteen to twenty-five 
hunters to kill a thousand buffalo in a single season ; but a single still- 
hunter, with a long-range breech-loader, who knew how to make a 
" sneak" and get "a stand on a bunch," often succeeded in killing 
from one to three thousand in one season by his own unaided efforts. 
Capt. Jack Brydges, of Kansas, who was one of the first to begin 
the final slaughter of the southern herd, killed, by contract, one thou- 
sand one hundred and forty-two buffaloes in six weeks. 
H. Mis. 600, pt. 2 30 



466 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

So long as the buffalo remained in large herds their numbers gave 
each individual a feeling of dependence upon his fellows and of general 
security from harm, even in the presence of strange phenomena which 
he could not understand. When he heard a loud report and saw a little 
cloud of white smoke rising from a gully, a clump of sage-brush, or the 
top of a ridge, 200 yards away, he wondered what it meant, and held 
himself in readiness to follow his leader in case she should run away. 
But when the leader of the herd, usually the oldest cow, fell bleeding 
upon the ground, and no other buffalo promptly assumed the leadership 
of the herd, instead of acting independently and fleeing from the alarm, 
he merely did as he saw the others do, and waited his turn to be shot. 
Latterly, however, when the herds were totally broken up, when the 
few survivors were scattered in every direction, and it became a case 
of every buffalo for himself, they became wild and wary, ever ready to 
start off at the slightest alarm, and run indefinitely. Had they shown 
the same wariness seventeen years ago that the survivors have mani- 
fested during the last three or four years, there would now be a hun- 
dred thousand head alive instead of only about three hundred in a wild 
and unprotected state. 

Notwithstanding the merciless war that had been waged against the 
buffalo for over a century by both whites and Indians, and the steady 
decrease of its numbers, as well as its range, there were several million 
head on foot, not only up to the completion of the Union Pacific Rail- 
way, but as late as the year 1870. Up to that time the killing done by 
white men had been chiefly for the sake of meat, the demand for robes 
was moderate, and the Indians took annually less than one hundred 
thousand for trading. Although half a million buffaloes were killed by 
Indians, half-breeds, and whites, the natural increase was so very con- 
siderable as to make it seem that the evil day of extermination was yet 
far distant. 

But by a coincidence which was fatal to the buffalo, with the build- 
ing of three lines of railway through the most populous buffalo country 
there came a demand for robes and hides, backed up by an unlimited 
supply of new and marvellously accurate breech-loading rifles and fixed 
ammunition. And then followed a wild rush of hunters to the buffalo 
country, eager to destroy as many head as possible in the shortest time. 
For those greedy ones the chase on horseback was "too slow" and too 
unfruitful. That was a retail method of killing, whereas they wanted 
to kill by wholesale. From their point of view, the still-hunt or " sneak" 
hunt was the method par excellence. If they could have obtained Gat- 
ling guns with which to mow down a whole herd at a time, beyond a 
doubt they would have gladly used them. 

The still-hunt was seen at its very worst in the years 1871, 1872, and 
1873, on the southern buffalo range, and ten years later at its best in 
Montana, on the northern. Let us first consider it at its best, which in 
principle was bad enough. 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 467 

The great rise in the price of robes which followed the blotting out 
of the great southern herd at once put buffalo-hunting on a much more 
comfortable and respectable business basis in the North than it had 
ever occupied in the South, where prices had all along been phenomenally 
low. 

In Montana it was no uncommon thing for a hunter to invest from 
$1,000 to $2,000 in his "outfit" of horses, wagons, weapons, ammuni- 
tion, provisions, and sundries. 

One of the men who accompanied the Smithsonian Expedition for 
Buffalo, Mr. James McNaney, of Miles City, Montana, was an ex-buffalo 
hunter, who had spent three seasons on the northern range, killing 
buffalo for their robes, and his standing as a hunter was of the best. 
A brief description of his outfit and its work during its last season on 
on the range (1882-'83) may fairly be taken as a typical illustration of 
the life and work of the still-hunter at its best. The only thing against 
it was the extermination of the buffalo. 

During the winters of 1880 and 1881 Mr. McNaney had served in Max- 
well's outfit as a hunter, working by the month, but his success in kill- 
ing was such that he decided to work the third year on his own account. 
Although at that time only seventeen years of age, he took an elder 
brother as a partner, and purchased an outfit in Miles City, of which 
the following were the principal items : Two wagons, 2 four-horse teams, 
2 saddle-horses, 2 wall- tents, 1 cook-stove with pipe, 1 40-90 Sharp's 
rifle (breech-loading), 1 45-70 Sharps rifle (breech-loading), 1 45-120 
Sharps rifle (breech-loading), 50 pounds gunpowder, 550 pounds lead, 
4,500 primers, 600 brass shells, 4 sheets patch-paper, 60 Wilson skinning 
knives, 3 butcher's steels, 1 portable grindstone, flour, bacon, baking- 
powder, coffee, sugar, molasses, dried apples, canned vegetables, beans, 
etc., in quantity. 

The entire cost of the outfit was about $1,400. Two men were hired 
for the season at $50 per month, and the party started from Miles City 
on November 10, which was considered a very late start. The usual 
time of setting out for the range was about October 1. 

The outfit went by rail northeastward to Terry, and from thence 
across country south and east about 100 miles, around the head of 
O'Fallon Creek to the head of Beaver Creek, a tributary of the Little 
Missouri. A good range was selected, without enroachment upon the 
domains of the hunters already in the field, and the camp was made 
near the bank of the creek, close to a supply of wood and water, and 
screened from distant observation by a circle of hills and ridges. The 
two rectangular wall-tents were set up end to end, with the cook-stove 
in the middle, where the ends came together. In one tent the cooking 
and eating was done, and the other contained the beds. 

It was planned that the various members of the party should cook 
turn about, a week at a time, but one of them soon developed such a 



468 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

rare and conspicuous talent for bread-making and general cookery that 
he was elected by acclamation to cook during the entire season. 
To the other three members fell the hunting. Each man hunted sep- 
arately from the others, and skinned all the animals that his rifle 
brought down. 

There were buffalo on the range when the hunters arrived, and the 
killing began at once. At daylight the still-hunter sallied forth on 
foot, carrying in his hand his huge Sharps rifle, weighing from 16 to 
19 pounds, with from seventy-five to one hundred loaded cartridges in 
his two belts or his pockets. At his side, depending from his belt, hung 
his "hunter's companion," a flat leather scabbard, containing a ripping 
knife, a skinning knife, and a butcher's steel upon which to sharpen 
them. The total weight carried was very considerable, seldom less 
than 36 pounds, and often more. 

Inasmuch as it was highly important to move camp as seldom as pos- 
sible in the course of a season's work, the hunter exercised the greatest 
precaution in killing his game, and had ever before his mind the neces- 
sity of doing his killing without frightening away the survivors. 

With ten thousand buffaloes on their range, it was considered the 
height of good luck to find a "bunch" of fifty head in a secluded 
"draw" or hollow, where it was possible to "make a kill" without dis- 
turbing the big herd. 

The still-hunter usually went on foot, for when buffaloes became so 
scarce as to make it necessary for him to ride his occupation was prac- 
tically gone. At the time I speak of, the hunter seldom had to walk 
more than 3 miles from camp to find buffalo, in case there were any at 
all on his range, and it was usually an advantage to be without a horse. 
From the top of a ridge or high butte the country was carefully scanned, 
and if several small herds were in sight the one easiest to approach 
was selected as the one to attack. It was far better to find a herd lying 
down or quietly grazing, or sheltering from a cold wind, than to find it 
traveling, for while a hard run of a mile or two often enabled the hun- 
ter to "head off" a moving herd and kill a certain number of animals 
out of it, the net results were never half so satisfactory as with herds 
absolutely at rest. 

Having decided upon an attack, the hunter gets to leeward of his 
game, and approaches it according to the nature of the ground. If it 
is in a hollow, he secures a position at the top of the nearest ridge, as 
close as he can get. If it is in a level "flat," he looks for a gully up 
which he can skulk until within good rifle-shot. If there is no gully, 
he may be obliged to crawl half a mile on his hands and knees, often 
through snow or amongst beds of prickly pear, taking advantage of 
even such scanty cover as sage-brush affords. Some Montana still- 
hunters adopted the method of drawing a gunny-sack over the entire 
upper half of the body, with holes cut for the eyes and arms, which 
simple but unpicturesque arrangement often enabled the hunter to

approach his game much more easily and more closely than would 
otherwise have been possible. 

Having secured a position within from 100 to 250 yards of his game 
(often the distance was much greater), the hunter secures a comfortable 
rest for his huge rifle, all the time keeping his own person thoroughly 
hidden from view, estimates the distance, carefully adjusts his sights, 
and begins business. If the herd is moving, the animal in the lead is the 
first one shot, close behind the fore leg and about a foot above the brisket, 
which sends the ball through the lungs. If the herd is at rest, the 
oldest cow is always supposed to be the leader, and she is the one to 
kill first. The noise startles the buffaloes, they stare at the little cloud 
of white smoke and feel inclined to run, but seeing their leader hesitate 
they wait for her. She, when struck, gives a violent start forward, but 
soon stops, and the blood begins to run from her nostrils in two bright 
crimson streams. In a couple of minutes her body sways unsteadily, 
she staggers, tries hard to keep her feet, but soon gives a lurch side- 
wise and falls. Some of the other members of the herd come around 
her and stare and sniff in wide-eyed wonder, and one of the more wary 
starts to lead the herd away. But before she takes half a dozen 
steps " bang !" goes the hidden rifle again, and her leadership is ended 
forever. Her fall only increases the bewilderment of the survivors over 
a proceeding which to them is strange and unaccountable, because the 
danger is not visible. They cluster around the fallen ones, sniff at the 
warm blood, bawl aloud in wonderment, and do everything but run 
away. 

The policy of the hunter is to not fire too rapidly, but to attend closely 
to business, and every time a buffalo attempts to make off, shoot it down. 
One shot per minute was a moderate rate of firing, but under pressure 
of circumstances two per minute could be discharged with deliberate 
precision. With the most accurate hunting rifle ever made, a " dead 
rest," and a large mark practically motionless, it was no wonder that 
nearly every shot meant a dead buffalo. The vital spot on a buffalo 
which stands with its side to the hunter is about a foot in diameter, and 
on a full-grown bull is considerably more. Under such conditions as 
the above, which was called getting u a stand," the hunter nurses his 
victims just as an angler plays a big fish with light tackle, and in the 
most methodical manner murders them one by one, either until the last 
one falls, his cartridges are all expended, or the stupid brutes come to 
their senses and run away. Occasionally the poor fellow was troubled 
by having his rifle get too hot to use, but if a snow-bank was at hand 
he would thrust the weapon into it without ceremony to cool it off. 

A success in getting a stand meant the slaughter of a good-sized 
herd. A hunter whom I met in Montana, Mr. Harry Andrews, told me 
that he once fired one hundred and fifteen shots from one spot and killed 
sixty-three buffalo in less than an hour. The highest number Mr. Mc- 
Nancy ever knew of being killed in one stand was ninety-one head, but 



470 REPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

Colonel Dodge once counted one hundred and twelve carcasses of buffalo 
"inside of a semicircle of 200 yards radius, all of which were killed by 
one man from the same spot, and in less than three-quarters of an hour." 
The "kill" being completed, the hunter then addressed himself to the 
task of skinning his victims. The northern hunters were seldom guilty 
of the reckless carelessness and lack of enterprise in the treatment ©f 
robes which at one time was so prominent a feature of work on the 
southern range. By the time white men began to hunt for robes on the 
northern range, buffalo were becoming comparatively scarce, and robes 
were worth from $2 to $4 each. The fur-buyers had taught the hunters, 
with the potent argument of hard cash, that a robe carefully and neatly 
taken off, stretched, and kept reasonably free from blood and dirt, was 
worth more money in the market than one taken off in a slovenly man- 
ner, and contrary to the nicer demands of the trade. After 1880, buffalo 
on the northern range were skinned with considerable care, and amongst 
the robe-hunters not one was allowed to become a loss when it was 
possible to prevent it. Every full-sized cow robe was considered equal 
to $3.50 in hard cash, and treated accordingly. The hunter, or skinner, 
always stretched every robe out on the ground to its fullest extent 
while it was yet warm, and cut the initials of his employer in the thin 
subcutaneous muscle which always adhered to the inside of the skin. 
A warm skin is very elastic, and when stretched upon the ground the 
hair holds it in shape until it either dries or freezes, and so retains its 
full size. On the northern range skins were so valuable that many a 
dispute arose between rival outfits over the ownership of a dead buf- 
falo, some of which produced serious results. 

2. The chase on horseback or " running buffalo." — Next to the still-hunt 
the method called "running buffalo" was the most fatal to the race, and 
the one most universally practiced. To all hunters, save greedy white 
men, the chase on horseback yielded spoil sufficient for every need, and 
it also furnished sport of a superior kind — manly, exhilarating, and well 
spiced with danger. Even the horses shared the excitement and eager- 
ness of their riders. 

So long as the weapons of the Indian consisted only of the bow and 
arrow and the spear, he was obliged to kill at close quarters or not at 
all. And even when fire-arms were first placed in his hands their cali- 
ber was so small, the charge so light, and the Indian himself so poor a 
marksman at long range, that his best course was still to gallop along- 
side the herd on his favorite "buffalo horse" and kill at the shortest 
possible range. From all accounts, the Eed Eiver half-breeds, who 
hunted almost exclusively with fire-arms, never dreamed of the deadly 
still-hunt, but always killed their game by "running" it. 

In former times even the white men of the plains did the most of 
their buffalo hunting on horseback, using the largest-sized Colt's re- 
volver, sometimes one in each hand, until the repeatiug-rifle made its 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 471 

appearance, which in a great measure displaced the revolver in running 
buffalo. But about that time began the mad warfare for " robes " and 
" hides," and the only fair and sportsmanlike method of hunting was 
declared too slow for the greedy buffalo-skinners. 

Then came the cold-blooded butchery of the still-hunt. From that 
time on the buffalo as a game animal steadily lost caste. It soon came 
to be universally considered that there was no sport in hunting buffalo. 
True enough of still-hunting, where the hunter sneaks up and shoots 
them down one by one at such long range the report of his big rifle 
does not even frighten them away. So far as sportsmanlike fairness is 
concerned, that method was not one whit more elevated than killing 
game by poison. 

But the chase on horseback was a different thing. Its successful 
prosecution demanded a good horse, a bold rider, a firm seat, and per- 
fect familiarity with weapons. The excitement of it was intense, the 
dangers not to be despised, and, above all, the buffalo had a fair show 
for his life, or partially so, at least. The mode of attack is easily de- 
scribed. 

Whenever the hunters discovered a herd of buffalo, they usually got 
to leeward of it and quietly rode forward in a body, or stretched out in 
a regular skirmish line, behind the shelter of a knoll, perhaps, until 
they had approached the herd as closely as could be done without 
alarming it. Usually the unsuspecting animals, with a confidence due 
more to their great numbers than anything else, would allow a party of 
horsemen to approach within from 200 to 400 yards of their flankers, 
and then they would start off on a slow trot. The hunters then put 
spurs to their horses and dashed forward to overtake the herd as 
quickly as possible. Once up with it, each hunter chooses the best ani- 
mal within his reach, chases him until his flying steed carries him close 
alongside, and then the arrow or the bullet is sent into his vitals. The 
fatal spot is from 12 to 18 inches in circumference, and lies immediately 
back of the fore leg, with its lowest point on a line with the elbow. 

This, the true chase of the buffalo, was not only exciting, but, dan- 
gerous. It often happened that the hunter found himself surrounded 
by the flying herd, and in a cloud of dust, so that neither man nor horse 
could see the ground before them. Under such circumstances fatal 
accidents to both men and horses were numerous. It was not an un- 
common thing for half-breeds to shoot each other in the excitement of 
the chase ; and, while now and then a wounded bull suddenly turned 
upon his pursuer and overthrew him, the greatest number of casualties 
were from falls. 

Of the dangers involved in running buffalo Colonel Dodge writes as 
follows : * 

"The danger is not so much from the buffalo, which rarely makes an 
effort to injure his pursuer, as from the fact that neither man nor horse

472 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

can see the ground, which may be rough and broken, or perforated with 
prairie-dog or gopher holes. This danger is so imminent, that a man 
who runs into a herd of buffalo may be said to take his life in his hand. 
I have never known a man hurt by a buffalo in such a chase. I have 
known of at least six killed, and a very great many more or less injured, 
some very severely, by their horses falling with them." 

On this point Catlin declares that to engage in running buffalo is 
" at the hazard of every bone in one's body, to feel the fine and thrilling 
exhilaration of the chase for a moment, and then as often to upbraid and 
blame himself for his folly and imprudence." 

Previous to my first experience in "running buffalo" I had enter- 
tained a mortal dread of ever being called upon to ride a chase across a 
prairie-dog town. The mouth of a prairie-dog's burrow is amply large 
to receive the hoof of a horse, and the angle at which the hole descends 
into the earth makes it just right for the leg of a running horse to 
plunge into up to the knee and bring down both horse and rider in- 
stantly ; the former with a broken leg, to say the least of it. If the rider 
sits loosely, and promptly resigns his seat, he will go flying forward, as 
if thrown from a catapult, for 20 feet or so, perhaps to escape with a 
few broken bones, and perhaps to have his neck broken, or his skull 
fractured on the hard earth. If he sticks tightly to his saddle, his horse 
is almost certain to fall upon him, and perhaps kill him. Judge, then, 
my feelings when the first bunch of buffalo we started headed straight 
across the largest prairie-dog town I had ever seen up to that time. 
And not only was the ground honey-combed with gaping round holes, 
but it was also crossed here and there by treacherous ditch-like gullies, 
cut straight down into the earth to an uncertain depth, and so narrow 
as to be invisible until it was almost time to leap across them. 

But at such a time, with the game thundering along a few rods in ad- 
vance, the hunter thinks of little else except getting up to it. He looks 
as far ahead as possible, and helps his horse to avoid dangers, but to a 
great extent the horse must guide himself. The rider plies his spurs 
and looks eagerly forward, almost feverish with excitement and eager- 
ness, but at the same time if he is wise he expects a fall, and holds him- 
self in readiness to take the ground with as little damage as he can. 

Mr. Catlin gives a most graphic description of a hunting accident, 
which may fairly be quoted in fall as a type of many such. I must say 
that I fully sympathize with M. Chardon in his estimate of the hard- 
ness of the ground he fell upon, for I have a painful recollection of a fall 
1 had from which I arose with the settled conviction that the ground in 
Montana is the hardest in the world ! It seemed more like falling upon 
cast-iron than prairie turf. 

"I dashed along through the thundering mass as they swept away 
over the plain, scarcely able to tell whether I was on a buffalo's back 
or my horse, hit and hooked and jostled about, till at length I found 
myself alongside my game, when I gave him a shot as I passed him.

I saw guns flash about me in several directions, but I heard them not. 
Amidst the trampling throng Mons. Chardon had wounded a stately 
bull, and at this moment was passing him with his piece leveled for 
another shot. They were both at full speed and I also, within the 
reach of the muzzle of my gun, when the bull instantly turned, receiv- 
ing the horse upon his horns, and the ground received poor Ghardon, 
who made a frog's leap of some 20 feet or more over the bull's back 
and almost under my horse's heels. I wheeled my horse as soon as 
possible and rode back where lay poor Chardon, gasping to start his 
breath again, and within a few paces of him his huge victim, with his 
heels high in the air, and the horse lying across him. I dismounted in- 
stantly, but Chardon was raising himself on his hands, with his eyes 
and mouth full of dirt, and feeling for his gun, which lay about 30 feet 
in advance of him. 'Heaven spare you! are you hurt, Chardon?' 

' Hi-hic — hie — hie — hie no ; — hie — no — no, I believe not. Oh, this 

is not much, Mons. Cataline — this is nothing new — but this is a d — d 
hard piece of ground here — hie — oh! hie!' At this the poor fellow 
fainted, but in a few moments arose, picked up his gun, took his horse 
by the bit, which then opened its eyes, and with a hie and a ugh — 
uglik ! — sprang upon its feet, shook off the dirt, and here we were, all 
upon our legs again, save the bull, whose fate had been more sad than 
that of either."* 

The following passage from Mr. Alexander Boss's graphic description 
of a great hunt,t in which about four hundred hunters made an on- 
slaught upon a herd, affords a good illustration of the dangers in run- 
ning buffalo: 

" On this occasion the surface was rocky and full of badger-holes. 
Twenty-three horses and riders were at one moment all sprawling on 
the ground ; one horse, gored by a bull, was killed on the spot ; two 
more were disabled by the fall ; one rider broke his shoulder-blade ; 
another burst his gun and lost three of his fingers by the accident ; 
and a third was struck on the knee by an exhausted ball. These acci- 
dents will not be thought overnumerous, considering the result, for in 
the evening no less than thirteen hundred and seventy-five tongues 
were brought into camp. 

It really seems as if the horses of the plains entered willfully and 
knowingly into the war on the doomed herds. But for the willingness 
and even genuine eagerness with which the " buffalo horses "of both white 
men and Indians entered into the chase, hunting on horseback would 
have been attended with almost insurmountable difficulties, and the 
results would have been much less fatal to the species. According to 
all accounts the horses of the Indians and half-breeds were far better 
trained than those of their white rivals, no doubt owing to the fact 
that the use of the bow, which required the free use of both hands,

474 EEPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

was only possible when the horse took the right course of his own free 
will or else could be guided by the pressure of the knees. If we may 
believe the historians of that period, and there is not the slightest 
reason to doubt them, the " buffalo horses" of the Indians displayed al- 
most as much intelligence and eagerness in the chase as did their 
human riders. Indeed, in "running buffalo" with only the bow and 
arrow, nothing but the willing co-operation of the horse could have 
possibly made this mode of hunting either satisfactory or successful. 

In Lewis and Clarke's Travels, volume n, page 387, appears the fol- 
lowing record: 

" He [Sergeant Pryor] had found it almost impossible with two men to 
drive on the remaining horses, for as soon as they discovered a herd of 
buffaloes the loose horses immediately set off in pursuit of them, and 
surrounded the buffalo herd with almost as much skill as their riders 
could have done. At last he was obliged to send one horseman forward 
and drive all the buffaloes from the route." 

The Hon. H. H. Sibley, who once accompanied the Red Eiver half- 
breeds on their annual hunt, relates the following : * 

" One of the hunters fell from his saddle, and was unable to overtake 
his horse, which continued the chase as if he of himself could accom- 
plish great things, so much do these animals become imbued with a 
passion for this sport ! On another occasion a half-breed left his 
favorite steed at the camp, to enabJe him to recruit his strength, enjoin- 
ing upon his wife the necessity of properly securing the animal, which 
was not done. Not relishing the idea of being left behind, he started 
after us and soon was alongside, and thus he continued to keep pace with 
the hunters in their pursuit of the buffalo, seeming to await with im- 
patience the fall of some of them to the earth. The chase ended, he 
came neighing to his master, whom he soon singled out, although the 
men were dispersed here and there for a distance of miles." 

Col. R. I. Dodge, in his Plains of the Great West, page 129, describes 
a meeting with two Mexican buffalo-hunters whose horses were so fleet 
and so well trained that whenever a herd of buffalo came in sight, in- 
stead of shooting their game wherever they came up with it, the one 
having the best horse would dash into the herd, cut out a fat two-year 
old, and, with the help of his partner, then actually drive it to their 
camp before shooting it down. " They had a fine lot of meat and a 
goodly pile of skins, and they said that every buffalo had been driven 
into camp and killed as the one I saw. 'It saves a heap of trouble 
packing the meat to camp,' said one of them, naively." 

Probably never before in the history of the world, until civilized man 
came in contact with the buffalo, did whole armies of men march out 
in true military style, with officers, flags, chaplains, and rules of war, 
and make war on wild animals. No wonder the buffalo has been ex- 
terminated. So long as they existed north of the Missouri in any con-

THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 475 

siderable number, the half-breeds and Indians of the Manitoba Red 
River settlement used to gather each year in a great army, and go with 
carts to the buffalo range. On these great hunts, which took place 
every year from about the 15th of June to the 1st of September, vast 
numbers of buffalo were killed, and the supply was finally exhausted. 
As if Heaven had decreed the extirpation of the species, the half-breed 
hunters, like their white robe-hunting rivals farther south, always killed 
cows in preference to bulls so long as a choice was possible, the very 
course best calculated to exterminate any species in the shortest possi- 
ble time. 

The army of half-breeds and Indians which annually went forth from 
the Red River settlement to make war on the buffalo was often far larger 
than the army with which Oortez subdued a great empire. As early 
as 1846 it had become so great, that it was necessary to divide it into two 
divisions, one of which, the White Horse Plain division, was accustomed 
to go west by the Assinniboine River to the " rapids crossing-place," 
and from there in a southwesterly direction. The Red River division 
went south to Pembina, and did the most of their hunting in Dakota. 
The two divisions sometimes met (says Professor Hind), but not inten- 
tionally. In 1849 a Mr. Flett took a census of the White Horse Plain 
division, in Dakota Territory, and found that it contained 603 carts, 
700 half-breeds, 200 Indians, 600 horses, 200 oxen, 400 dogs, and 1 cat. 

In his " Red River Settlement " Mr. Alexander Ross gives the fol- 
lowing census of the number of carts assembled in camp for the buffalo 
hunt at five different periods : 

Number of carts assembled for the first trip. 

In 1820 540 

In 1825 680 

In 1830 820 

In 1835 970 

In 1840 1,210 

The expedition which was accompanied by Rev. Mr. Belcourt, a 
Catholic priest, whose account is set forth in the Hon. Mr. Sibley's pa- 
per on the buffalo,* was a comparatively small one, which started from 
Pembina, and very generously took pains not to spoil the prospects of 
the great Red River division, which was expected to take the field at 
the same time. This, therefore, was a small party, like others which 
had already reached the range; but it contained 213 carts, 55 hunters 
and their families, making 60 lodges in all. This party killed 1,776 
cows (bulls not counted, many of which were killed, though " not even 
a tongue was taken"), which yielded 228 bags of pemmican, 1,213 bales 
of dried meat, 166 sacks of tallow, and 556 bladders full of marrow. 
But this was very moderate slaughter, being about 33 buffalo to each 
family. Even as late as 1872, when buffalo were getting scarce, Mr.

Grant * met a half-breed family on the Qu'Appelle, consisting of man, 
wife, and seven children, whose six carts were laden with the meat and 
robes yielded by sixty buffaloes ; that number representing this one 
hunter's share of the spoils of the hunt. 

To afford an idea of the truly military character of those Eed Eiver 
expeditions, I have only to quote a page from Prof. Henry Youle Hind : t 

"After the start from the settlement has been well made, and all 
stragglers or tardy hunters have arrived, a great council is held and a 
president elected. A number of captains are nominated by the presi- 
dent and people jointly. The captains then proceed to appoint their 
own policemen, the number assigned to each not exceeding ten. Their 
duties are to see that the laws of the hunt are strictly carried out. In 
1840, if a man ran a buffalo without permission before the general hunt 
began, his saddle and bridle were cut to pieces for the first offense; 
for the second offense his clothes were cut off his back. At the present 
day these punishments are changed to a fine of 20 shillings for the first 
offense. No gun is permitted to be fired when in the buffalo country 
before the 'race' begins. A priest sometimes goes with the hunt, and 
mass is then celebrated in the open prairies. 

"At night the carts are placed in the form of a circle, with the horses 
and cattle inside the ring, and it is the duty of the captains and their 
policemen to see that this is rightly done. All laws are proclaimed in 
camp, and relate to the hunt alone. All camping orders are given by 
signal, a flag being carried by the guides, who are appointed by elec- 
tion. Each guide has his turn of one day, and no man can pass a guide 
on duty without subjecting himself to a fine of 5 shillings. No hunter 
can leave the camp to return home without permission, and no one is 
permitted to stir until any animal or property of value supposed to be 
lost is recovered. The policemen, at tbe order of their captains, can 
seize any cart at night- fall and place it where they choose for the public 
safety, but on the following morning they are compelled to bring it back 
to the spot from which they moved it the previous evening. This power 
is very necessary, in order that the horses may not be stampeded by 
night attacks of the Sioux or other Indian tribes at war with the half- 
breeds. A heavy fine is imposed in case of neglect in extinguishing 
fires when the camp is broken up in the morning. 

" In sight of buffalo all the hunters are drawn up in line, the presi- 
dent, captains, and police being a few yards in advance, restraining the 
impatient hunters. ' Not yet ! Not j et ! ' is the subdued whisper of the 
president. The approach to the herd is cautiously made. ' Now ! ' the 
president exclaims ; and as the word leaves his lips the charge is made r 
and in a few minutes the excited half-breeds are amongst the bewil- 
dered buffalo." 

"After witnessing one buffalo hunt," says Prof. John Macoun, " I can

THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 477 

not blame the half-breed and the Indian for leaving the farm and wildly 
making for the plains when it is reported that buffalo have crossed the 
border." 

The " great fall hunt" was a regular event with about all the Indian 
tribes living within striking distance of the buffalo, in the course of 
which great numbers of buffalo were killed, great quantities of meat 
dried and made into pemmican, and all the skins taken were tanned in 
various ways to suit the many purposes they were called upon to serve. 

Mr. Francis La Flesche informs me that during the presence of the 
buffalo in western Nebraska and until they were driven south by the 
Sioux, the fall hunt of the Omahas was sometimes participated in by 
three hundred lodges, or about 3,000 people all told, six hundred of 
whom were warriors, and each of whom generally killed about ten buf- 
faloes. The laws of the hunt were very strict and inexorable. In order 
that all participants should have an equal chance, it was decreed that 
any hunter caught " still-hunting" should be soundly flogged. On one 
occasion an Indian was discovered in the act, but not caught. During 
the chase which was made to capture him many arrows were fired at 
him by the police, but being better mounted than his pursuers he 
escaped, and kept clear of the camp during the remainder of the hunt. 
On another occasion an Omaha, guilty of the same offense, was chased, 
and in his effort to escape his horse fell with him in a coulee and broke 
one of his legs. In spite of the sad plight of the Omaha, his pursuers 
came up and flogged him, just as if nothing had happened. 

After the invention of the Colt's revolver, and breech-loading rifles 
generally, the chase on horseback speedily became more fatal to the 
bison than it ever had been before. With such weapons, it was possi- 
ble to gallop into the midst of a flying herd and, during the course of 
a run of 2 or 3 miles, discharge from twelve to forty shots at a range of 
only a few yards, or even a few feet. In this kind of hunting the heavy 
Navy revolver was the favorite weapon, because it could be held in one 
hand aud fired with far greater precision than could a rifle held in 
both hands. Except in the hands of an expert, the use of the rifle was 
limited, and often attended with risk to the hunter; but the revolver 
was good for all directions ; it could very often be used with deadly 
effect where a rifle could not have been used at all, and, moreover, it 
left the bridle-hand free. Many cavalrymen and hunters were able to 
use a revolver with either hand, or one in each hand. Gen. Lew. Wal- 
lace preferred the Smith and Wesson in 1867, which he declared to be 
" the best of revolvers " then. 

It was his marvelous skill in shooting buffaloes with a rifle, from the 
back of a galloping horse, that earned for the Hon. W. F. Cody the 
sobriquet by which he is now familiarly known to the world — " Buffalo 
Bill." To the average hunter on horseback the galloping of the horse 
makes it easy for him to aim at the heart of a buffalo and shoot clear 
over its back. No other shooting is so difficult, or requires such con- 



478 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887 



suramate dexterity as shooting with any kind of a gun, especially a rifle, 
from the back of a running horse. Let him who doubts this statement 
try it for himself and he will doubt no more. It was in the chase of the 
buffalo on horseback, armed with a rifle, that " Buffalo Bill" acquired the 
marvelous dexterity with the rifle which he has since exhibited in the 
presence of the people of two continents. I regret that circumstances 
have prevented my obtaining the exact figures of the great kill of buffa- 
loes that Mr. Cody once made in a single run, in which he broke all pre- 
vious records in that line, and fairly earned his title. In 1867 he en- 
tered into a contract with the Kansas Pacific Bailway, then in course 
of construction through western Kansas, at a monthly salary of $500, 
to deliver all the buffalo meat that would be required by the army of 
laborers engaged in building the road. In eighteen months he killed 
4,280 buffaloes. 

3. Impounding or Killing in Pens. — At first thought it seems hard to 
believe that it was ever possible for Indians to build pens and drive 
wild buffaloes into them, as cowboys now corral their cattle, yet such 
wholesale catches were of common occurrence among the Plains Crees 
of the south Saskatchewan country, and the same general plan was 
pursued, with slight modifications, by the Indians of the Assinniboine, 
Blackfeet, and Gros Ventres, and other tribes of the Northwest. Like 
the keddah elephant-catching operations in India, this plan was feasi- 
ble only in a partially wooded country, and where buffalo were so nu- 
merous that their presence could be counted upon to a certainty. The 
"pound" was simply a circular pen, having a single entrance; but 
being unable to construct a gate of heavy timbers, such as is made to 
drop and close the entrance to an elephant pen, the Indians very 
shrewdly got over the difficulty by making the opening at the edge of 
a perpendicular bank 10 or 12 feet high, easy enough for a buffalo 
to jump down, but impossible for him to scale afterward. It is hardly 
probable that Indians who were expert enough to attack and kill buf- 
falo on foot would have been tempted to undertake the labor that build- 
ing a pound always involved, had it not been for the wild excitement 
attending captures made in this way, and which were shared to the 
fullest possible extent by warriors, women, and children alike. 

The best description of this method which has come under our notice 
is that of Professor Hind, who witnessed its practice by the Plains 
Orees, on the headwaters of the Qu'Appelle Eiver, in 1858. He de- 
scribes the pound he saw as a fence, constructed of the trunks of trees 
laced together with green withes, and braced on the outside by props, 
inclosing a circular space about 120 feet in diameter. It was placed in 
a pretty dell between sand-hills, and leading from it in two diverging 
rows (like the guiding wings of an elephant pen) were the two rows of 
bushes which the Indians designate " dead men," which serve to guide 
the buffalo into the pound. The " dead men " extended a distance of 4 
miles into the prairie. They were placed about 50 feet apart, and the

two rows gradually diverged until at their extremities they were from, 
1^ to 2 miles apart. 

"When the skilled hunters are about to bring in a herd of buffalo 
from the prairie," says Professor Hind, " they direct the course of the 
gallop of the alarmed animals by confederates stationed iu hollows or 
small depressions, who, when the buffalo appear inclined to take a di- 
rection leading from the space marked out by the ' dead men,' show 
themselves for a moment and wave their robes, immediately hiding 
again. This serves to turn the buffalo slightly in another direction, and 
when the animals, having arrived between the rows of ' dead men,' en- 
deavor to pass through them, Indians stationed here and there behind 
a ' dead man ' go through the same operation, and thus keep the animals 
within the narrowing limits of the converging lines. At the entrance 
to the pound there is a strong trunk of a tree placed about a foot from 
the ground, and on the inner side an excavation is made sufficiently 
deep to prevent the buffalo from leaping back when once in the pound. 
As soon as the animals have taken the fatal spring, they begin to 
gallop round and round the ring fence, looking for a chance to escape, 
but with the utmost silence women and children on the outside hold 
their robes before every orifice until the whole herd is brought in ; then 
they climb to the top of the fence, and, with the hunters who have fol- 
lowed closely in the rear of the buffalo, spear or shoot with bows and 
arrows or fire-arms at the bewildered animals, rapidly becoming frantic 
with rage and terror, within the narrow limits of the pound. 

"A dreadful scene of confusion and slaughter then begins ; the oldest 
and strongest animals crush and toss the weaker; the shouts and 
screams of the excited Indians rise above the roaring of the bulls, the 
bellowing of the cows, and the piteous moaning of the calves. The 
dying struggles of so many huge and powerful animals crowded together 
create a revolting and terrible scene, dreadful from the excess of its 
cruelty and waste of life, but with occasional displays of wonderful brute 
strength and rage; while man in his savage, untutored, and heathen 
state shows both in deed and expression how little he is superior to the 
noble beasts he so wantonly and cruelly destroys."* 

The last scene of the bloody tragedy is thus set forth a week later : 

u Within the circular fence * * * lay, tossed in every conceivable 
position, over two hundred dead buffalo. [The exact number was 240.] 
From old bulls to calves of three months' old, animals of every age were 
huddled together in all the forced attitudes of violent death. Some lay 
on their backs, with eyes starting from their heads and tongue thrust 
out through clotted gore. Others were impaled on the horns of the old 
and strong bulls. Others again, which had been tossed, were lying 
with broken backs, two and three deep. One little calf hung suspended 
on the horns of a bull which had impaled it in the wild race round and 
round the pound. The Indians looked upon the dreadful and sickening

480 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

sight with evident delight, and told how such and such a bull or cow 
had exhibited feats of wonderful strength in the death-struggle. The 
flesh of many of the cows had been taken from tbem, and was drying in 
the sun on stages near the tents. It is needless to say that the odor 
was overpowering, and millions of large blue flesh-flies, humming and 
buzzing over the putrefying bodies, was not the least disgusting part 
of the spectacle." 

It is some satisfaction to know that when the first " run " was made, 
ten days previous, the herd of two hundred buffaloes was no sooner 
driven into the pound than a wary old bull espied a weak spot in the 
fence, charged it at full speed, and burst through to freedom and the 
prairie, followed by the entire herd. 

Strange as it may seem to-day, this wholesale method of destroying 
buffalo was once practiced in Montana. In his memoir on "The Ameri- 
can Bison," Mr. J. A. Allen states that as late as 1873, while journeying 
through that Territory in charge of the Yellowstone Expedition, he 
" several times met with the remains of these pounds and their converg- 
ing fences in the region above the mouth of the Big Horn Eiver." Mr. 
Thomas Simpson states that in 1840 there were three camps of Assin- 
niboine Indians in the vicinity of Carlton House, each of which had its 
buffalo pound into which they drove forty or flfty animals daily. 

4. The " Surround? — During the last forty years the final extermina- 
tion of the buffalo has been confidently predicted by not only the observ- 
ing white man of the West, but also nearly all the Indians and half- 
breeds who formerly depended upon this animal for the most of the ne- 
cessities, as well as luxuries, of life. They have seen the great herds 
driven westward farther and farther, until the plains were left tenant- 
less, and hunger took the place of feasting on the choice tidbits of the 
chase. And is it not singular that during this period the Indian tribes 
were not moved by a common impulse to kill sparingly, and by the ex- 
ercise of a reasonable economy in the chase to make the buffalo last as 
long as possible. 

But apparently no such thoughts ever entered their minds, so far as 
they themselves were concerned. They looked with jealous eyes upon 
the white hunter, and considered him as much of a robber as if they 
had a brand on every buffalo. It has been claimed by some authors 
that the Indians killed with more judgment and more care for the future 
than did the white man, but I fail to find any evidence that such was 
ever the fact. They all killed wastefully, wantonly, and always about 
five times as many head as were really necessary for food. It was 
always the same old story, whenever a gang of Indians needed meat a 
whole herd was slaughtered, the choicest portions of the finest animals 
were taken, and about 75 per cent, of the whole left to putrefy and fatten 
the wolves. And now, as we read of the appalling slaughter, one can 
scarcely repress the feeling of grim satisfaction that arises when we 
also read that many of the ex-slaughterers are almost starving for the 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 481 

millions of pounds of fat and juicy buffalo meat they wasted a few years 
ago. Verily, the buffalo is in a great measure avenged already. 

The following extract from Mr. Catlin's " North American Indians," I, 
page 199-200, serves well to illustrate not only a very common and very 
deadly Indian method of wholesale slaughter — the " surround " — but 
also to show the senseless destructiveness of Indians even when in a 
state of semi-starvation, which was brought upon them by similar acts 
of improvidence and wastefulness. 

"The Minatarees, as well as the Mandans, had suffered for some 
months past for want of meat, and had indulged in the most alarming- 
fears that the herds of buffalo were emigrating so far off from them 
that there was great danger of their actual starvation, when if was sud- 
denly announced through the village one morning at an early hour 
that a herd of buffaloes was in sight. A hundred or more young men 
mounted their horses, with weapons in hand, and steered their course 
to the prairies. * * * 

" The plan of attack, which in this country is familiary called a sur- 
round, was explicity agreed upon, and the hunters, who were all 
mounted on their i buffalo horses' and armed with bows and arrows or 
long lances, divided into two columns, taking opposite directions, and 
drew themselves gradually around the herd at a mile or more distance 
from them, thus forming a circle of horsemen at equal distances apart, 
who gradually closed in upon them with a moderate pace at a signal 
given. The unsuspecting herd at length ' got the wind ' of the approach- 
ing enemy and fled in a mass in the greatest confusion. To the point 
where they were aiming to cross the line the horsemen were seen, at full 
speed, gathering and forming in a column, brandishing their weapons, 
and yelling in the most frightful manner, by which they turned the black 
and rushing mass, which moved off in an opposite direction, where they 
were again met and foiled in a similar manner, and wheeled back in 
utter confusion; by which time the horsemen had closed in from all 
directions, forming a continuous line around them, whilst the poor af- 
frighted animals were eddying about in a crowded and confused mass, 
hooking and climbing upon each other, when the work of death com- 
menced. I had rode up in the rear and occupied an elevated position 
at a few rods' distance, from which I could (like the general of a battle- 
field) survey from my horse's back the nature and the progress of the 
grand melee, but (unlike him) without the power of issuing a command 
or in any way directing its issue. 

" In this grand turmoil [see illustration] a cloud of dust was soon raised, 
which in parts obscured the throng where the hunters were galloping 
their horses around and driving the whizzing arrows or their long lances 
to the hearts of these noble animals; which in many instances, becoming 
infuriated with deadly wounds in their sides, erected their shaggy manes 
over their bloodshot eyes and furiously plunged forward at the sides of 
their assailants' horses, sometimes goring them to death at a lunge and

482 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

putting their dismounted riders to flight for their lives. Sometimes 
their dense crowd was opened, and the blinded horsemen, too intent on 
their prey amidst the cloud of dust, were hemmed and wedged in amidst 
the crowding beasts, over whose bar:ks they were obliged to leap for 
security, leaving their horses to the fate that might await them in the 
results of this wild and desperate war. Many were the bulls that turned 
upon their assailants and met them with desperate resistance, and many 
w^ere the warriors who were dismounted and saved themselves by the 
superior muscles of their legs ; some who were closely pursued by the 
bulls wheeled suddenly around, and snatching the part of a buffalo robe 
from around their waists, threw it over the horns and eyes of the iu- 
furiated ibeast, and darting by its side drove the arrow or the lance lo 
its heart; others suddenly dashed off upon the prairie by the side of 
the affrighted animals which had escaped from the throng, aud closely 
escorting them for a few rods, brought down their heart's blood in 
streams and their huge carcasses upon the green aud enameled turf. 

u In this way this grand hunt soon resolved itself into a desperate 
battle, and in the space of fifteen minutes resulted in the total destruction 
of the whole herd, which in all their strength and fury were doomed, like 
every beast aud living thing else, to fall before the destroying hands of 
mighty man. 

"I had sat in trembling silence upon my horse and witnessed this 
extraordinary scene, which allowed not one of these animals to escape 
out of my sight. Many plunged off upon the prairie for a distance, but 
were overtaken and killed, and although I could not distinctly estimate 
the number that were slain, yet I am sure that some hundreds of these 
noble animals fell in this grand melee. * * * Amongst the poor 
affrighted creatures that had occasionally dashed through the ranks of 
their enemy and sought safety in flight upon the prairie (and in some 
instances had undoubtedly gained it), I saw them stand awhile, looking 
back, when they turned, and, as if bent on their own destruction, re- 
traced their steps, and mingled themselves and their deaths with those 
of the dying throng. Others had fled to a distance on the prairies, and 
for want of company, of friends or of foes, had stood and gazed on till 
the battle-scene was over, seemingly taking pains to stay and hold their 
lives in readiness for their destroyers until the general destruction was 
over, wheu they fell easy victims to their weapons, making the slaugh- 
ter complete." 

It is to be uoticed that every animal of this entire herd of several hun- 
dred was slain on the spot, aud there is no room to doubt that at least 
halt (possibly much more) of the meat thus taken was allowed to be- 
come a loss. People who are so utterly senseless as to wantonly de- 
stroy their own source of food, as the Indians have done, certainly 
deserve to starve. 

This "surround" method of wholesale slaughter was also practiced

by the Cheyennes, Arapahoes, Sioux, Pawnees, Oinabas, and probably 
many other tribes. 

5. Decoying and Driving. — Another method of slaughtering by whole- 
sale is thus described by Lewis and Clarke, I, '235. The locality indi- 
cated was the Missouri River, in Montana, just above the mouth of 
Judith Eiver : 

u On the north we passed a precipice about 120 feet high, under 
which lay scattered the fragments of at least one hundred carcasses of 
buffaloes, although the water which had washed away the lower part 
of the hill must have carried off many of the dead. These buffaloes 
had been chased down a precipice in a way very common on the Mis- 
souri, and by which vast herds are destroyed in a moment. The mode 
of bunting is to select one of the most active and fleet young men, who 
is disguised by a buffalo skin round his body ; the skin of the head 
with the ears and horns fastened on his own head in such a way as to 
deceive the buffaloes. Thus dressed, he fixes himself at a convenient 
distance between a herd of buffaloes and any of the river precipices, 
which sometimes extend for some miles. 

" His companions in the mean time get in the rear and side of the 
herd, and at a given signal show themselves, and advance towards the 
buffaloes. They instantly take alarm, and, finding the hunters beside 
them, they run toward the disguised Indian or decoy, who leads them 
on at full speed toward the river, when, suddenly securing himself in 
some crevice of the cliff which he had previously fixed on, the herd is 
left on the brink of the precipice ; it is then in vain for the foremost 
to retreat or even to stop; they are pressed on by the hiudmost rank, 
who, seeing no danger but from the hunters, goad on those before them 
till the whole are precipitated and the shore is strewed with their dead 
bodies. Sometimes in this perilous seduction the Indian is himself 
either trodden under foot by the rapid movements of the buffaloes, or, 
missing his footing in the cliff, is urged down the precipice by the fall- 
ing herd. The Indians then select as much meat as they wish, and the 
rest is abandoned to the wolves, and creates a most dreadful stench." 

Harper's Magazine, volume 38, page 147, contains the following from 
the pen of Theo. R. Davis, in an article entitled " The Buffalo Range : n 

"As I have previously stated, the best hunting on the range is to be 
found between the Platte and Arkansas Rivers. Here I have seen the 
Indians have recourse to another method of slaughtering buffalo in a 
very easy, but to me a cruel way, for where one buffalo is killed several 
are sure to be painfully injured ; but these, too, are soon killed by the 
Indians, who make haste to lance or shoot the cripples. 

" The mode of hunting is somewhat as follows : A herd is discovered 
grazing on the table-lands. Being thoroughly acquainted with the 
country, the Indians are aware of the location of the nearest point 
where the table-land is broken abruptly by a precipice which descends 
a hundred or more feet. Toward this < devil-jump ' the Indians head the 



484 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

herd, which is at once driven pell-mell to and over the precipice. 
Meanwhile a number of Indians have taken their way by means of 
routes known to them, and succeed in reaching the canon through 
which the crippled buffalo are running- in all directions. These are 
quickly killed, so that out of a very considerable band of buffalo 
but few escape, many having been killed by the fall and others dis- 
patched while limping off. This mode of hunting is sometimes in- 
dulged in by harum-scarum white men, but it is done more for deviltry 
than anything else. I have never known of its practice by army officers 
or persons who professed to hunt buffalo as a sport." 

VI. Hunting on Snoivslioes. — "In the dead of the winters," says Mr. 
Catlin,* "which are very long and severely cold in this country, where 
horses can not be brought into the chase with any avail, the Indian 
runs upon the surface of the snow by aid of his show-shoes, which buoy 
him up, while the great weight of the buffaloes sinks them down to the 
middle of their sides, and, completely stopping their progress, insures 
them certain and easy victims to the bow or lance of their pursuers. 
The snow in these regions often lies during the wiuter to the depth of 
3 and 4 feet, being blown "away from the tops and sides of the hills in 
many places, which are left bare for the buffaloes to graze upon, whilst 
it is drifted in the hollows and ravines to a ver}^ great depth, and ren- 
dered almost entirely impassable to these huge animals, which, when 
closely pursued by their enemies, endeavor to plunge through it, but 
are soon wedged in and almost unable to move, where they fall an easy 
prey to the Indian, who runs up lightly upon his snow-shoes and drives 
his lance to their hearts. The skins are then stripped off, to be sold to 
the fur traders, and the carcasses left to be devoured by the wolves. 
[Owing to the fact that the winter's supply of meat was procured and 
dried in the summer and fall months, the flesh of all buffalo kdled in 
winter was allowed to become a total loss.] This is the season in which 
the greatest number of these animals are destroyed for their robes; 
they are most easily killed at this time, and their hair or fur, being 
longer and more abundant, gives greater value to the robe." 

IV. Progress of the Extermination. 

1. The Period of Desultory Destruction, from 1730 to 1830. 

The disappearance of the buffalo from all the country east of the 
Mississippi was one of the inevitable results of the advance of civiliza- 
tion. To the early pioneers who went forth into the wilderness to 
wrestle with nature for the necessities of life, this valuable animal 
might well have seemed a gift direct from the hand of Providence. 
During the first few years of the early settler's life in a new country, 
the few domestic animals he had brought with him were far too valua-

PLATE XVIII.

THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 485 

ble to be killed for food, aud for a long period lie looked to the wild 
animals of the forest aud the prairie for his daily supply of meat. The 
time was when no one stopped to think of the important part our game 
animals played in the settlement of this country, and even now no one 
has attempted to calculate the lessened degree of .rapidity with which 
the star of empire would have taken its westward way without the 
bison, deer, elk, and antelope. The Western States and Territories 
pay little heed to the wanton slaughter of deer and elk now going on 
in their forests, but the time will soon come when the "grangers" will 
enter those regions and find the absence of game a very serious matter. 

Although the bison was the first wild species to disappear before the 
advance of civilization, he served a good purpose at a highly critical 
period. His huge bulk of toothsome flesh fed many a hungry family, 
and his ample robe did good service in the settler's cabin and sleigh in 
winter weather. By the time game animals had become scarce, domes- 
tic herds and flocks had taken their place, and hunting became a pas- 
time instead of a necessity. 

As might be expected, from the time the bison was first seen by 
white men he has always been a conspicuous prize, and being the larg- 
est of the land quadrupeds, was naturally the first to disappear. Every 
man's hand has been against him. While his disappearance from the 
eastern United States was, in the main, due to the settler who killed 
game as a means of subsistence, there were a few who made the killing 
of those animals a regular business. This occurred almost exclusively 
in the immediate vicinity of salt springs, around which the bison con- 
gregated in great numbers, and made their wholesale slaughter of easy 
accomplishment. Mr. Thomas Ashe* has recorded some very interest- 
ing tacts and observations on this point. In speaking of an old man 
who in the latter part of the last century built a log house for himself 
"on the immediate borders of a salt spring," in western Pennsylvania, 
for the purpose of killing buffaloes out of the immense droves which 
frequented that spot, Mr. Ashe says : 

"In the first and second years this old man, with some companions, 
killed from six to seven hundred of these noble creatures merely for 
the sake of their skins, which to them were worth only 2 shillings each; 
aud after this 'work of death' they were obliged to leave the place till 
the following season, or till the wolves, bears, panthers, eagles, rooks, 
ravens, etc., had devoured the carcasses and abandoned the place for 
other prey. In the two following years the same persons killed great 
numbers out of the first droves that arrived, skinned them, and left 
their bodies exposed to the sun aud air; but they soon had reason to 
repent of this, for the remaining droves, as they came up in succession, 
stopped, gazed on the mangled and putrid bodies, sorrowfully monned 
or furiously lowed aloud, aud returned instantly to the wilderness in an 
unusual run, without tasting their favorite spring or licking the im-

486 EEPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

pregnated earth, which was also once their most agreeable occupation j 
nor did they nor any of their race ever revisit the neighborhood. 

"The simple history of this spring is that of every other in the settled 
parts of this Western World; the carnage of beasts was everywhere the 
same. I met with a man who had killed two thousand buffaloes with 
his own hand, and others no doubt have done the same thing. In 
consequence of such proceedings not one buffalo is at this time to be 
found east of the Mississippi, except a few domesticated by the curious, 
or carried through the country on a public show." 

But, fortunately, there is no evidence that such slaughter as that de- 
scribed by Mr. Ashe was at all. common, and there is reason for the 
belief that until within the last forty years the buffalo was sacrificed 
in ways conducive to the greatest good of the greatest number. 

From Coronado to General Fremont there has hardly been an ex- 
plorer of United States territory who has not had occasion to bless the 
bison, and its great value to mankind can hardly be overestimated, 
although by many it can readily be forgotten. 

The disappearance of the bison from the eastern United States was 
due to its consumption as food. It was very gradual, like the march 
of civilization, and, under the circumstances, absolutely inevitable. Iu 
a country so thickly peopled as this region speedily became, the mas- 
todon could have survived extinction about as easily as the bison. Ex- 
cept when the latter became the victim of wholesale slaughter, there was 
little reason to bemoan his fate, save upon grounds that may be re- 
garded purely sentimental. He served a most excellent purpose iu 
the development of the country. Even as late as 1875 the farmers of 
eastern Kansas were in the habit of making trips every fall into the 
western part of that State for wagon loads of buffalo meat as a supply 
for the succeeding winter. The farmers of Texas, Nebraska, Dakota, 
and Minnesota also drew largely upon the buffalo as long as the supply 
lasted. 

The extirpation of the bison west of the Eocky Mountains was due 
to legitimate hunting for food and clothing rather than for marketable 
peltries. In no part of that whole region was the species ever numer- 
ous, although in the mountains themselves, notably in Colorado, within 
easy reach of the great prairies on the east, vast numbers were seen 
by the early explorers and pioneers. But to the westward, away from 
the mountains, they were very rarely met with, and their total destruc- 
tion in that region was a matter of easy accomplishment. According 
to Prof. J. A. Allen the complete disappearance of the bison west of 
the Eocky Mountains took place between 1838 and 1810. 

2. The Prkiod of Systematic Slaughter, from 1830 to -18:58. 

We come now to a history which I would gladly leave unwritten. 
Its record is a disgrace to the American people in general, and the 
Territorial, State, and General Government in particular. It will cause 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 487 

succeeding generations to regard us as being possessed of the leading 
characteristics of the savage and the beast of prey — cruelty and greed. 
We will be likened to the blood-thirsty tiger of the Indian jungle, who 
slaughters a dozen bullocks at once when he knows he can eat only one. 

In one respect, at least, the white men who engaged in the systematic 
slaughter of the bison were savages just as much as the Piegan Indians, 
who would drive a whole herd over a precipice to secure a week's rations 
of meat for a single village. The men who killed buffaloes for their 
tongues arid those who shot them from the railway trains for sport were 
murderers. In no way does civilized man so quickly revert to his former 
state as when he is alone with the beasts of the field. Give him a gun 
and something which he may kill without getting himself in trouble, 
and, presto! he is instantly a savage again, finding exquisite delight in 
bloodshed, slaughter, and death, if not for gain, then solely for the joy 
and happiness of it. There is no kind of warfare against game animals 
too unfair, too disreputable, or too mean for white men to engage in if 
they can oldy do so with safety to their own precious carcasses. They 
will shoot buffalo and antelope from running railway trains, drive deer 
into water with hounds and cut their throats in cold blood, kill does 
with fawns a week old, kill fawns by the score for their spotted skins, 
slaughter deer, moose, and caribou in the snow at a pitiful disadvan- 
tage, just as the wolves do; exterminate the wild ducks on the whole 
Atlantic seaboard with punt guns for the metropolitan markets; kill 
off the Rocky Mountain goats for hides worth only 50 cents apiece, de- 
stroy wagon loads of trout with dynamite, and so on to the end of the 
chapter. 

Perhaps the most gigantic task ever undertaken on this continent 
in the line of game-slaughter was the extermination of the bison in the 
great pasture region by the hide-hunters. Probably the brilliant ra- 
pidity and success with which that lofty undertaking was accom- 
plished was a matter of surprise even to those who participated in it. 
The story of the slaughter is by no means a long one. 

The period of systematic slaughter of the bison naturally begins with 
the first organized efforts in that direction, in a business-like, whole- 
sale way. Although the species had been steadily driven westward for 
a hundred years by the advancing settlements, and had during all that 
time been hunted for the meat and robes it yielded, its extermination 
did not begin in earnest until 1820, or thereabouts. As before stated, 
various persons had previous to that time made buffalo killing a busi- 
ness iu order to sell their skins, but such instances were very excep- 
tional. By that- time the bison was totally extinct in all the region 
lying east of the Mississippi River except a portion of Wisconsin, 
where it survived until about 1830. In 1S20 the first organized buffalo 
hunting expedition on a grand scale was made from the Red River set- 
tlement, Manitoba, in which five hundred and forty carts proceeded to 
the range. Previous to that time the buffaloes were found near enough 



488 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

to the settlements around Fort Garry that every settler could hunt inde- 
pendently ; but as the herds were driven farther and farther away, it 
required an organized effort and a long journey to reach them. 

The American Fur Company established trading posts along the 
Missouri River, one at the mouth of the Teton Eiver and another at 
the mouth of the Yellowstone. In 1826 a post was established at the 
eastern base of the Rocky Mountains, at the head of the Arkansas 
River, and in 1832 another was located in a corresponding situation at 
the head of the South Fork of the Platte, close to where Denver now 
stands. Both the latter were on what was then the western border of 
the buffalo range. Elsewhere throughout the buffalo country there 
were numerous other posts, always situated as near as possible to the 
best hunting ground, and at the same time where they would be most 
accessible to the hunters, both white and red. 

As might be supposed, the Indians were encouraged to kill buffaloes 
for their robes, and this is what Mr. George Catlin wrote at the mouth 
of the Teton River (Pyatt County, Dakota) in 1832 concerning this 
trade :* 

"It seems hard and cruel (does it not?) that we civilized people, with 
all the luxuries and comforts of the world about us, should be drawing 
from the backs of these useful animals the skins for our luxury, leaving 
their carcasses to be devoured by the wolves ; that we should draw from 
that country some one hundred and fifty or two hundred thousand of 
their robes annually, the greater part of which are taken from animals 
that are killed expressly for the robe, at a season when the meat is not 
cured and preserved, and for each of which skins the Indian has re- 
ceived but a pint of whisky! Such is the fact, and that number, or 
near it, are annually destroyed, in addition to the number that is neces- 
sarily killed for the subsistence of three hundred thousand Indians, who 
live chiefly upon them." 

The author further declared that the fur trade in those "great west- 
ern realms " was then limited chiefly to the purchase of buffalo robes. 

1. The Bed Eiver half -breeds. — In June, 1840, when the Red River 
half-breeds assembled at Pembina for their annual expedition against 
the buffalo, they mustered as follows : 

Carts 1,210 

Hunters 620 \ 

Women 650 VI, 630 

Boys and girls 360 ) 

Horses (buffalo runners) 403 

Dogs 542 

Cart horses '.... 655 

Draught oxen 586 

Skinning knives 1,240 

The total value of the property employed in this expedition and the 
working time occupied by it (two months) amounted to the enormous 
sum of £24,000.

THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 489 

Although the bison formerly ranged to Fort Garry (near Winnipeg), 
they had been steadily killed off and driven back, and in 1810 none were 
found by the expedition until it was 250 miles from Pembina, which is 
situated on the Red River, at the international boundary. At that time 
the extinction of the species from the Red River to the Cheyenne was 
practically complete. The Red River settlers, aided, of course, by the 
Indians of that region, are responsible for the extermination of the bison 
throughout northeastern Dakota as far as the Cheyenne River, northern 
Minnesota, and the whole of what is now the province of Manitoba. 
More than that; as the game grew scarce and retired farther and 
faither, the half-breeds, who despised agriculture as long as there was 
a buffalo to kill, extended their hunting operations westward along the 
Qu' Appelle until they encroached upon the hunting-grounds of the Plain 
Crees, who lived in the Saskatchewan country. 

Thus was an immense inroad made in the northern half of the herd 
which had previously covered the entire pasture region from the Great 
Slave Lake to central Texas. This was the first Aisible impression of 
the systematic killing which began in 1820. Up to 1810 it is reasonably 
certain, as will be seen by figures given elsewhere, that by this business- 
like method of the half-breeds, at least 652,000 buffaloes were destroyed 
by them alone. 

Even as early as 1810 the Red River hunt was prosecuted through 
Dakota southwestwardly to the Missouri River and a short distance 
beyond it. Here it touched the wide strip of territory, bordering that 
stream, which was even then being regularly drained of its animal re- 
sources by the Indian hunters, who made the river their base of opera- 
tions, and whose robes were shipped on its steam-boats. 

It is certain that these annual Red River expeditions into Dakota 
were kept up as late as 1847, and as long thereafter as buffaloes were to 
be found in any number between the Cheyenne and the Missouri. At 
the same time, the White Horse Plains division, which hunted west- 
ward from Fort Garry, did its work of destruction quite as rapidly and 
as thoroughly as the rival expedition to the United States. 

In 1857 the Plains Crees, inhabiting the country around the head- 
waters of the Qu'Appelle River (250 miles due west from Winnipeg), 
assembled in council, and " determined that in consequence of promises 
often made and broken by the white men and half-breeds, and the rapid 
destruction by them of the buffalo they fed on, they would not permit 
either white men or half-breeds to hunt m their country, or travel 
through it, except for the purpose of trading for their dried meat, pein- 
mican, skins and robes." 

In 1858 the Crees reported that between the two branches of the Sas- 
katchewan buffalo were " very scarce." Professor Hind's expedition 
saw only one buffalo in the whole course of their journey from Winni- 
peg until they reached Sand Hill Lake, at the head of the QuAppelie, 
near the south branch of the Saskatchewan, where the first herd was

encountered. Although the species was not totally extinct on the 
QuAppelle at that time, it was practically so. 

2. The country of the Sioux. — The next territory completely depopulated 
of buffaloes by systematic hunting was very nearly the entire southern 
half of Dakota, southwestern Minnesota, and northern Nebraska as 
far as the North Platte. This vast region, once the favorite range for 
hundreds of thousands of buffaloes, had for many years been the favor- 
ite hunting ground of the Sioux Indians of the Missouri, the Pawnees, 
Omahas, and all other tribes of that region. The settlement of Iowa 
and Minnesota presently forced into this region the entire body of 
Mississippi Sioux from the country west of Prairie du Chien and around 
Fort Snelling, and materially hastened the extermination of all the 
game animals which were once so abundant there. It is absolutely 
certain that if the Indians had been uuiufluenced by the white traders, 
or, in other words, had not been induced to take and prepare a large 
number of robes every year for the market, the species would have 
survived very much longer than it did. But the demand quickly 
proved to be far greater than the supply. The Indians, of course, found 
it necessary to slaughter annually a great number of buffaloes for their 
own wants — for meat, robes, leather, teepees, etc. When it came to 
supplementing this necessary slaughter by an additional .fifty thousand 
or more every year for marketable robes, it is no wonder that the im- 
provident savages soon found, when too late, that the suppl} 7 of buffaloes 
was not inexhaustible. Naturally enough, they attributed their dis- 
appearance to the white man, who was therefore a robber, and a x>ro- 
per subject for the scalping-knife. Apparently it never occurred to 
the minds of the Sioux that they themselves were equally to blame; 
it was always the paleface who killed the buffaloes; and it was always 
Sioux buffaloes that they killed. The Sioux seemed to feel that they 
held a chattel mortgage on all the buffaloes north of the Platte, and it 
required more than one pitched battle to convince them otherwise. 

Up to the time when the great Sioux Eeservation was established in 
Dakota (1875-'77), when 33,739 square miles of country, or nearly the 
whole southwest quarter of the Territory, was set aside for the exclu- 
sive occupancy of the Sioux, buffaloes were very numerous throughout 
that entire region. East of the Missouri Eiver, which is the eastern 
boundary of the Sioux Eeservation, from Bismarck all the way down, the 
species was practically extinct as early as 1870. But at the time when 
it became unlawful for white hunters to enter the territory of the Sioux 
nation there were tens of thousands of buffaloes upon it, and their 
subsequent slaughter is cha'rgable to the Indians alone, save as to 
those which migrated into the hunting grounds of the whites. 

3. Western railways, and their part in the extermination of the buffalo. — 
The building of a railroad means the speedy extermination of all the 
big game along its line. In its eagerness to attract the public and 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON 491 

build up "a big business," every new line which traverses a country 
containing game does its utmost, by means of advertisements and 
posters, to attract the man with a gun. Its game resorts are all laid 
bare, and the market hunters and sportsmen swarm in immediately, 
slaying and to slay. 

Within the last year the last real retreat for our finest game, the 
only remaining stronghold for the mountain sheep, goat, caribou, elk, 
and deer — northwestern Montana, northern Idaho, and thence west- 
ward — has been laid open to the very heart by the building of the St. 
Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Eailway, which runs up the valley of 
the Milk Kiver to Fort Assinniboiue, and crosses the Eocky Mountains 
through Two Medicine Pass. Heretofore that region has been so diffi- 
cult to reach that the game it contains has been measurably secure 
from general slaughter; but now it also must " go." 

The marking out of the great overland trail by the Argonauts of ? 49 
in their rush for the gold fields of California was the foreshadowing of 
the great east-and-west breach in the universal herd, which was -made 
twenty years later by the first transcontinental railway. 

The pioneers who "crossed the plains" in those days killed buffaloes 
for food whenever they could, and the constant harrying of those animals 
experienced along the line of travel, soon led them to retire from the 
proximity of such continual danger. It was undoubtedly due to this 
cause that the number seen by parties who crossed the plains in 1SI9 
and subsequently, was surprisingly small. But, fortunately for tbe 
buffaloes, the pioneers who would gladly have halted and turned aside 
now and then for the excitement of the chase, were compelled to hurry 
on, and accomplish the long journey while good weather lasted. It was 
owing to this fact, and the scarcity of good horses, that the buffaloes 
found it necessary to retire only a few miles from the wagon route to 
get beyond the reach of those who would have gladly hunted them. 

Mr. Allen Varner, of Indianola, Illinois, has kindly furnished me 
with the following facts in regard to the presence of the buffalo, as 
observed by him during his" journey westward, over what was then 
known as the Oregon Trail. 

"The old Oregon trail ran from Independence, Missouri, to old Fort 
Laramie, through the South Pass of the Eocky Mountains, and thence 
up to Salt Lake City. We left Independence on May 6, 1849, and 
struck the Platte Eiver at Grand Island. The trail had been traveled 
but very little previous to that year. We saw no buffaloes whatever 
until we reached the forks of the Platte, on May 20, or thereabouts. 
There we saw seventeen head. From that time on we saw small 
bunches now and then; never more than forty or fifty together. We 
saw no great herds anywhere, and I should say we did not see ovei 
five hundred head all told. The most western point at which we saw 
buffaloes was about due north of Laramie Peak, and it must have been 
about the 20th of June. We killed several head for meat during our 



492 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

trip, and found them all rather thin in flesh. Plainsmen who claimed 
to know, said that all the buffaloes we saw had wintered in that locality, 
and had not had time to get fat. The annual migration from the south 
had not yet begun, or rather had not yet brought any of the southern 
buffaloes that far north." 

In a few years the tide of overland travel became so great, that the 
buffaloes learned to keep away from the dangers of the trail, and many 
a pioneer has crossed the plains without ever seeing a live buffalo. 

4. The division of the universal herd. — Until the building of the first 
transcontinental railway made it possible to market the " buffalo prod- 
uct," buffalo hunting as a business was almost wholly in the hands of 
the Indians. Even then, the slaughter so far exceeded the natural in- 
crease that the narrowing limits of the buffalo range was watched with 
anxiety, and the ultimate extinction of the species confidently predicted. 
Even without railroads the extermination of the race would have 
taken place eventually, but it would have been delayed perhaps twenty 
years. With a recklessness of the future that was not to be expected 
of savages, though perhaps perfectly natural to civilized white men, who 
place the possession of a dollar above everything else, the Indians 
with one accord singled out the coivs for slaughter, because their robes 
and their flesh better suited the fastidious taste of the noble redskin. 
The building of the Union Pacific Eailway began at Omaha in 1865, 
and during that year 40 miles were constructed. The year following 
saw the completion of 265 miles more, and in 1867 245 miles were 
added, which brought it to Cheyenne. In 1868, 350 miles were built, 
and in 1869 the entire line was open to traffic. 

In 1867, when Maj. J. W. Powell and Prof. A. H. Thompson crossed 
the plains by means of the Union Pacific Eailway as far as it was con- 
structed and thence onward by wagon, they saw during the entire trip 
only one live buffalo, a solitary old bull, wandering aimlessly along the 
south bank of the Platte River. 

The completion of the Union Pacific Eailway divided forever the 
buffaloes of the United States into two great herds, which thereafter 
became known respectively as the northern and southern herds. Both 
retired rapidly and permanently from the railway, and left a strip of 
country over 50 miles wide almost uninhabited by them. Although 
many thousand buffaloes were killed by hunters who made the Union 
Pacific Eailway their base of operations, the two great bodies retired 
north and south so far that the greater number were beyond striking- 
distance from that line. 

5. The destruction of the southern herd. — The geographical center of 
the great southern herd during the few years of its separate existence 
previous to its destruction was very near the present site of Garden 
City, Kansas. On the east, even as late as 1872, thousands of buffaloes 
ranged within 10 miles of Wichita, which was then the headquarters 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 493 

of a great number of buffalo-hunters, who plied their occupation vigor- 
ously during the winter. On the north the herd ranged within 25 miles 
miles of the Union Pacific, until the swarm of hunters coining clown 
from the north drove them farther and farther south. On the west, a 
few small bands ranged "as far as Pike's Peak and the South Park, but 
the main body ranged east of the town of Pueblo, Colorado. In the 
southwest, buffaloes were abundant as far as the Pecos and the Staked 
Plains, while the southern limit of the herd was about on a line with 
the southern boundary of New Mexico. Eegarding this herd, Colonel 
Dodge writes as follows: " Their most j)rized feeding ground was the 
section of country between the South Platte and Arkansas rivers, 
watered by the Eepublican, Smoky, Walnut, Pawnee, and other paral- 
lel or. tributary streams, and generally known as the Eepublican coun- 
try. Hundreds of thousands went south from here each winter, but 
hundreds of thousands remained. It was the chosen home of the 
buffalo." 

Although the range of the northern herd covered about twice as much 
territory as did the southern, the latter contained probably twice as 
many buffaloes. The number of individuals in the southern herd in 
the year 1871 must have been at least three millions, and most estimates 
place the total much higher than that. 

During the years from 1S66 to 1871, inclusive, the Atchison, Topeka 
and Santa Fe Eailway and what is now known as the Kansas Pacific, 
or Kansas division of the Union Pacific Eailway, were constructed from 
the Missouri Eiver westward across Kansas, and through the heart of 
the southern buffalo range. The southern herd was literally cut to 
pieces by railways, and every portion of its range rendered easily ac- 
cessible. There had always been a market for buffalo robes at a fair 
price, and as soon as the railways crossed the buffalo country the 
slaughter began. The rush to the range was only surpassed by the 
rush to the gold mines of California in earlier years. The railroad build- 
ers, teamsters, fortune-seekers, "professional" hunters, trappers, guides, 
and every one out of a job turned out to hunt buffalo for hides and meat. 
The merchants who had already settled in all the little towns along the 
three great railways saw an opportunity to make money out of the 
buffalo product, and forthwith began to organize and supply hunting 
parties with arms, ammunition, and provisions, and send them to the 
range. An immense business of this kind was done by the merchants 
of Dodge City (Fort Dodge), Wichita, and Leavenworth, and scores of 
smaller towns did a corresponding amouut of business in the same line. 
During the years 1871 to 1874 but little else was done in that country 
except buffalo killing. Central depots were established in the best 
buffalo country, from whence hunting parties operated in all directions. 
Buildings were erected for the curing of meat, and corrals were built 
in which to heap up the immense piles of buffalo skins that accumu- 
lated. At Dodge City, as late as 1878, Professor Thompson saw a 



494 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

lot of baled buffalo skins in a corral, the solid cubical contents of which 
he calculated to equal 120 cords. 

At first the utmost wastefulness prevailed. Every one wanted to 
kill buffalo, and no one was willing to do the skinning and curing. 
Thousands upon thousands of buffaloes were. killed for their tongues 
alone, and never skinned. Thousands more were wounded by unskill- 
ful marksmen and wandered off to die and become a total loss. But 
the climax of wastefulness and sloth was not reached until the enter- 
prising buffalo-butcher began to skin his dead buffaloes by horse power. 
The process is of interest, as showing the depth of degradation to which 
a man can fall and still call himself a hunter. The skin of the buffalo 
was ripped open along the belly and throat, the legs cut around at the 
knees, and ripped up the rest of the way. The skin of the neck was 
divided all the way around at the back of the head, and skinned back 
a few inches to afford a start. A stout iron bar, like a hitching post, 
was then driven through the skull and about 18 inches into the earth, 
after which a rope was tied very firmly to the thick skin of the neck, 
made ready for that purpose. The other end of this rope was then 
hitched to the whiffletree of a pair of horses, or to the rear axle of a 
wagon, the horses were whipped up, and the skin was forthwith either 
torn in two or torn off the buffalo with about 50 pounds of flesh adher- 
ing to it. It soon became apparent to even the most enterprising buf- 
falo skinner that this method was not an unqualified success, and it was 
presently abandoned. 

The slaughter which began in 1871 was prosecuted with great vigor 
and enterprise in 1872, and reached, its heighten 1873. By that time, 
the buffalo country fairly swarmed with hunters, each party putting 
forth its utmost efforts to destroy more buffaloes than its rivals. By 
that time experience had taught the value of thorough organization, 
and the butchering was done in a more businesslike way. By a coin- 
cidence that proved fatal to the bison, it was just at the beginning of 
the slaughter that breech-loading, long-range rifles attained what was 
practically perfection. The Sharps 40-90 or 45-120, and the Beming- 
ton were the favorite weapons of the buffalo-hunter, the former be- 
ing the one in most general use. Before the leaden hail of thousands 
of these deadly breech-loaders the buffaloes went down at the rate of 
several thousand daily during the hunting season. 

During the years 1871 and 1872 the most wanton wastefulness pre- 
vailed. Colonel Dodge declares that, though hundreds of thousands 
of skins were sent to market, they scarcely indicated the extent of the 
slaughter. Through want of skill in shooting and want of knowledge 
in preserving the hides of those slain by green hunters, one hide sent to 
market represented three, four, or even Jive dead buffalo. The skinners 
and curers knew so little of the proper mode of curing hides, that at 
least halt of those actually taken were lost. In the summer and fall 
of 1872 one hide sent to market represented at least three dead buffalo. 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 495 

This condition of affairs rapidly improved; but such was the furor for 
slaughter, and the ignorauce of aH'concerned, that every hide sent to 
market in 1871 represented no less than five dead buffalo. 

By 1873 the condition of affairs had somewhat improved, through 
better organization of the hunting parties and knowledge gained by 
experience in curing. For all that, however, buffaloes were still so ex- 
ceedingly plentiful, and shooting was so much easier than skinning, 
the latter was looked upou as a necessary evil and still slighted to such 
an extent that every hide actually sold and delivered represented two 
dead buffaloes. 

In 1874 the.slaughterers began to take alarm at the increasing scar- 
city of buffalo, and the skinners, having a much smaller number of 
dead animals to take care of than ever before, were able to devote more 
time to each subject and do their work properly. As a result, Colonel 
Dodge estimated that during 1874, and from that time on, one hundred 
skins delivered represented not more than one hundred and twenty-five 
dead buffaloes ; but that " no parties have ever got the proportion lower 
than this." 

The great southern herd was slaughtered by still-hunting, a method 
which has already been fully described. A typical hunting party is 
thus described by Colonel Dodge: * 

"The most approved party consisted of four men — one shooter, two 
skinners, and one man to cook, stretch hides, and take care of camp. 
Where buffalo were very plentiful the number of skinners was increased. 
A light wagon, drawn by two horses or mules, takes the outfit into the 
wilderness, and brings into camp the skins taken each day. The out- 
fit is most meager: a sack of flour, a-side of bacon, 5 pounds of coffee, 
tea, and sugar, a little salt, and possibly a few beans, is a month's sup- 
ply. A common or "A" tent furnishes shelter; a couple of blankets 
for each man is a bed. One or more of Sharps or Kemington's heaviest 
sporting rifles, and an unlimited supply of ammunition, is the arma- 
ment; while a coffee-pot, Dutch-oven, frying-pan, four tin plates, and 
four tin cups constitute the kitchen and table furniture. 

" The skinning knives do duty at the platter, and ' fingers were made 
before forks.' Nov must be forgotten one or more 10-gallon kegs for 
water, as the camp may of necessity be far away from a stream. The 
supplies are generally furnished by the merchant for whom the party 
is working, who, in addition, pays each of the party a specified percent- 
age of the value of the skins delivered. The shooter is carefully selected 
for his skill and knowledge of the habits of the buffalo. He is captain 
and leader of the party. When all is read} 7 , he plunges into the wilder- 
ness, going to the center of the best buffalo region known to him, uot 
already occupied (for there are unwritten regulations recognized as 
laws, giving to each hunter certain rights of discovery and occupancy). 

* Plaius of tlio Great West, p. 134. 



496 KEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUxW, 1887. 

Arrived at the position, he makes his camp in some hidden ravine or 
thicket, and makes all ready for work." 

Of course the slaughter was greatest along the lines of the three great 
railways — the Kansas Pacific, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe, and 
the Union Pacific, about in the order named. It reached its height in 
the season of 1873. During that year the Atchison, Topeka and Santa 
Fe Railroad carried out of the buffalo country 251,443 robes, 1,017,600 
pounds of meat, and 2,743,100 pounds of bones. The end of the south-" 
ern herd was then near at hand. Could the southern buffalo range have 
been roofed over at that time it would have made one vast charnel- 
house. Putrifying carcasses, many of them with the hide still on, lay 
thickly scattered over thousands of square miles of the level prairie, 
poisoning the air and water and offending the sight. The remaining 
herds had become mere scattered bands, harried and driven hither and 
thither by the hunters, who now swarmed almost as thickly as the 
buffaloes. A cordon of camps was established along the Arkansas 
River, the South Platte, the Republican, and the few other streams that 
contained water, and when the thirsty animals came to drink they were 
attacked and driven away, and with the most fiendish persistency kept 
from slaking their thirst, so that they would again be compelled to seek 
the river and come within range of the deadly breech loaders. Colonel 
Dodge declares that in places favorable to such warfare, as the south 
bank of the Platte, a; herd of buffalo has, by shooting at it by day and 
by lighting fires and firing guns at night, been kept from water until it 
has been entirely destroyed. In the autumn of 1873, when Mr. William 
Blackmore traveled for some 30 or 40 miles along the north bank of 
the Arkansas River to the east of Fort Dodge, " there was a continu- 
ous line of putrescent carcasses, so that the air was rendered pestilential 
and offensive to the last degree. The hunters had formed a line of 
camps along the banks of the river, and had shot down the buffalo, night 
and morning, as they came to drink. In order to give an idea of the 
number of these carcasses, it is only necessary to mention that I counted 
sixty-seven on one spot not covering 4 acres." 

White hunters were not allowed to hunt in the Indian Territory, but 
the southern boundary of the State of Kansas was picketed by them, 
and a herd no sooner crossed the line going north than it was destroyed. 
Every water-hole was guarded by a camp of hunters, and whenever a 
thirsty herd approached, it was promptly met by rifle-bullets. 

During this entire period the slaughter of buffaloes was universal. 
The man who desired buffalo meat for food almost invariably killed 
five times as many animals as he could utilize, and after cutting from 
each victim its very choicest parts — the tongue alone, possibly, or per- 
haps the hump and hind quarters, one or the other, or both — fully four- 
fifths of the really edible portion of the carcass would be left to the 
wolves. It was no uncommon thing for a man to bring in two barrels 
of salted buffalo tongues, without another pound of meat or a solitary 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 497 

robe. The. tongues were purchased at 25 cents each and sold in the mar- 
kets farther east at 50 cents. In those days of criminal wastefulness it 
was a very common thing for buffaloes to be slaughtered for their tongues 
alone. Mr. George Catlin* relates that a few days previous to his ar- 
rival at the mouth of the Teton Eiver (Dakota), in 1832, " an immense 
herd of buffaloes had showed themselves on the opposite side of the 
river," whereupon a party of five or six hundred Sioux Indians on horse- 
back forded the river, attacked the herd, recrossed the river about sun- 
set, and came into the fort with fourteen hundred fresh buffalo tongues, 
which were thrown down in a mass, and for which they required only 
a few gallons of whisky, which was soon consumed in " a little harmless 
carouse," Mr. Catlin states that from all that he could learn not a skin 
or a pound of meat, other than the tongues, was saved after this awful 
slaughter. 

Judging from all accounts, it is making a safe estimate to say that 
probably no fewer than fifty thousand buffaloes have been killed for 
their tongues alone, and the most of these are undoubtedly chargeable 
against white men, who ought to have known better. 

A great deal has been said about the slaughter of buffaloes by for- 
eign sportsmen, particularly Englishmen ; but 1 must say that, from all 
that can be ascertained on this point, this element of destruction has 
been greatly exaggerated and overestimated. It is true that every 
English sportsman who visited this country in the days of the buffalo 
always resolved to have, and did have, "a buffalo hunt," and usually 
under the auspices of United States Army officers. Undoubtedly these 
parties did kill hundreds of buffaloes, but it is very doubtful whether 
the aggregate of the number slain by foreign sportsmen would run up 
higher than ten thousand. Indeed, for myself, I am well convinced 
that there are many old ex-still-huuters yet living, each of whom is ac- 
countable for a greater number of victims than all buffaloes killed 
by foreign sportsmen would make added together. The professional 
butchers were very much given to crying out against " them English 
lords," and holding up their hands in holy horror at buffaloes killed 
by them for their heads, instead of for hides to sell at a dollar apiece; 
but it is due the American public to say that all this outcry was re- 
ceived at its true value and deceived very few. By those in possession 
of the facts it was recognized as " a blind," to divert public opinion 
from the real culprits. 

Nevertheless it is very true that many men who were properly classed 
as sportsmen, in contradistinction from the pot hunters, did engage in 
useless and inexcusable slaughter to an extent that was highly repre- 
hensible, to say the least. A sportsman is not supposed to kill game 
wantonly, when it can be of no possible use to himself or any one 
else, but a great many do it for all that. Indeed, the sportsman who

498 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 



kills sparingly and conscientiously is rather the exception than the rule. 
Colonel Dodge thus refers to the work of some foreign sportsmen: 

" In the fall of that year [1872] three English gentlemen went out with 
me for a short hunt, and in their excitement bagged more buffalo than 
would have supplied a brigade." As a general thing, however, the pro- 
fessional sportsmen who went out to have a buffalo hunt for the excite- 
ment of the chase and the trophies it yielded, nearly always found the 
bison so easy a victim, and one whose capture brought so little glory to 
the hunter, that the chase was voted very disappointing, and soon 
abandoned in favor of nobler game. In those days there was no more 
to boast of in killing a buffalo than in the assassination of a Texas steer. 

It was, then, the hide-hunters, white and red, but especially white, 
who wiped out the great southern herd in four short years. The prices 
received for hides varied considerably, according to circumstances, but 
for the green or undressed article it usually ranged from 50 cents for 
the skins of calves to $1.25 for those of adult animals in good condition. 
Such prices seem ridiculously small, but when it is remembered that, 
when buffaloes were plentiful it was no uncommon thing for a hunter to 
kill from forty to sixty head in a day, it will readily be seen that the 
chances of making very handsome profits were sufficient to tempt hunt- 
ers to make extraordinary exertions. Moreover, even when the buffa- 
loes were nearly gone, the country was overrun with men who had abso- 
lutely nothing else to look to as a means of livelihood, and so, no matter 
whether the profits were great or small, so long as enough buffaloes 
remained to make it possible to get a living by their pursuit, they were 
hunted down with the most determined persistency and pertinacity. 

6. Statistics of the slaughter. — The most careful and reliable estimate 
ever made of results of the slaughter of the southern buffalo herd is 
that of Col. .Richard Irving Dodge, and it is the only one I know of 
which furnishes a good index of the former size of that herd. Inas- 
much as this calculation was based on actual statistics, supplemented 
by personal observations and inquiries made in that region during the 
great slaughter, I can do no better than to quote Colonel Dodge 
almost in full.* 

The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe" Eailroad furnished the following 
statistics of the buffalo product carried by it during the years 1872, 
1873, and 1874:

THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON.

The officials of the Kansas Pacific and Union Pacific railroads either 
could not or would not furnish any statistics of the amount of the 
buffalo product carried by their lines during this period, aud it became 
necessary to proceed without the actual figures in both cases. Inas 
much as the Kansas Pacific road cuts through a portion of the buffalo 
country which was in every respect as thickly inhabited by those aui- 
mals as the region traversed by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe, it 
seemed absolutely certain that the former road hauled out fully as many 
hides as the latter, if not more, and its quota is so set down. The Union 
Pacific line handled a much smaller number of buffalo hides than either 
of its southern rivals, but Colouel Dodge believes that this, "with the 
smaller roads which touch the buffalo region, taken together, carried 
about as much as either of the two principal buffalo roads." 

Colonel Dodge considers it reasonably certain that the statistics fur- 
nished by the Atchison, Topeka aud Santa Fe road represent only one- 
third of the entire buffalo product, and there certainly appears to be 
good ground for this belief. It is therefore in order to base further 
calculations upon these figures. 

According to evidence gathered on the spot by Colonel Dodge during 
the period of the great slaughter, one hide sent to market in 1872 rep- 
resented three dead buffaloes, in 1873 two, and in 1874 one hundred skins 
delivered represented one hundred and twenty-five dead animals. The 
total slaughter by white men was therefore about as below:

During all this time the Indians of all tribes within striking distance 
of the herds killed an immense number of buffaloes every year. In the 
summer they killed for the hairless hides to use for lodges and for 
leather, aud in the autumn they slaughtered for robes and meat, but 
particularly robes, which were all they could offer the white trader in 
exchange for his goods. They were too lazy aud shiftless to cure much 
buffalo meat, and besides it was not necessary, for the Government fed 
them. In regard to the number of buffaloes of the southern herd killed 
by the Indians, Colonel Dodge arrives at an estimate, as follows: 

"It is much more difficult to estimate the number of dead buffalo 

represented by the Indian-tanned skins or robes sent to market. This 

number varies with the different tribes, and their greater or less contact 

•with the whites, Thus ? the Oheyennes, Arapahoes, and Kiowas of the

southern plains, having less contact with whites, use skins for their 
lodges, clothing, bedding, par-Heches, saddles, lariats, for almost every- 
thing. The number of robes sent to market represent only what we 
may call the foreign exchange of these tribes, and is really not more 
than one-tenth of the skins taken. To be well within bounds I will as- 
sume that one robe sent to market by these Indians represents six dead 
buffaloes. 

"Those bands of Sioux who live at the agencies, and whose peltries 
are taken to market by the Union Pacific Eailroad, live in lodges of 
cotton cloth furnished by the Indian Bureau. They use much civilized 
clothing, bedding, boxes, ropes, etc. For these luxuries they must pay 
in robes, and as the buffalo range is far from wide, and their yearly 
'crop' small, more than half of it goes to market." 

Leaving out of the account at this point all consideration of the kill- 
ing done north of the Union Pacific Eailroad, Colonel Dodge's figures 
are as follows :

Eeference has already been made to the fact that during those years 
an immense number of buffaloes were killed by the farmers of eastern 
Kansas and Nebraska for their meat. Mr. William Mitchell, of Wa- 
baunsee, Kansas, stated to the writer that " in those days, when buf- 
faloes were plentiful in western Kansas, pretty much everybody made 
a trip West in the fall and brought back a load of buffalo meat. 
Everybody had it in abundance as long as buffaloes remained in any 
considerable number. Very few skins were saved; in fact, hardly any, 
for the reason that nobody knew how to tan them, and they always 
spoiled. At first a great many farmers tried to dress the green hides 
that they brought back, but they could not succeed, and finally gave up 
trying. Of course, a great deal of the meat killed was wasted, for only 
the best parts were brought back." 

The Wichita (Kansas) World of February 9, 1889, contains the fol- 
lowing reference : 

" In 1871 and 1872 the buffalo ranged within 10 miles of Wichita, aud 
could be counted by the thousands. The town, then in its infancy, was 
the headquarters for a vast number of buffalo-hunters, who plied their 
occupation vigorously during the winter. The buffalo were killed 
principally for their hides, and daily wagon trains arrived in town

loaded with tliera. Meat was very cheap in those days; fine, tender 
buffalo steak selling from 1 to 2 cents per pound. * * * The busi- 
ness was quite profitable for a time, but a sudden drop in the price of 
hides brought them down as low as 25 and 50 cents each. * * * It 
was a very common thing in those days for people living in Wichita to 
start out in the morning and return by evening with a wagon load of 
buffalo meat." 

Unquestionably a great many thousand buffaloes were killed annu- 
ally by the settlers of Kansas, Nebraska, Texas, .New Mexico, and Colo- 
rado, and the mountain Indians living west of the great range. The 
number so slain can only be guessed at, for there is absolutely no data 
on which to found an estimate. ' Judging merely from the number of 
people within reach of the range, it may safely be estimated that the 
total number of buffaloes slaughtered annually to satisfy the wants of 
this heterogeneous element could not have been less than fifty thousand, 
and probably was a much higher number. This, for the three years, 
would make one hundred and fifty thousand, and the grand total would 
therefore be about as follows : 

The slaughter of the southern herd. 

Killed by " professional " white hunters in 1872, 1873, and 1874 3,158, 730 

Killed by Indians, same period 390,000 

Killed by set tiers and mountain Indians 150, 000 

Total slaughter in three years 3, 698, 730 

These figures seem incredible, but unfortunately there is not the 
slightest reason for believing they are too high. There are many men 
now living who declare that during the great slaughter they each killed 
from twenty-five hundred to three thousand buffaloes every year. 
With thousands of hunters on the range, and such possibilities of 
slaughter before each, it is, after all, no wonder that an average of 
nearly a million and a quarter of buffaloes fell each year during that 
bloody period. 

By the close of the hunting season of 1875 the great southern herd 
had ceased to exist. As a body, it had been utterly annihilated. The 
main body of the survivors, numbering about ten thousand head, fled 
southwest, and dispersed through that great tract of wild, desolate, 
and inhospitable country stretching southward from the Cimarron 
country across the u Public Land Strip," the Pan-handle of Texas, and 
the Llano Estacado, or Staked Plain, to the Pecos Eiver. -A few small 
bands of stragglers maintained a precarious existence for a few years 
longer on the headwaters of the Eepublican River and in southwestern 
Nebraska, near Ogalalla, where calves were caught alive as late as 1885. 
Wild buffaloes were seen in southwestern Kansas for the last time in 
1886, and the two or three score of individuals still living in the Can- 
adian River country of the Texas Pan-handle are the last wild sur- 
vivors of the great Southern herd. 



502 EEPORT OP NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

Tbe maiu body oi' the fugitives which survived the great slaughter of 
1871-'74 continued to attract hunters who were very "hard up," who 
pursued them, often at the risk of their own lives, even into the terrible 
Llauo Estacado. In Montana in 1886 I met on a cattle ranch an ex- 
buffalo-hunter from Texas, named Harry Andrews, who from 1874 to 
187G continued in pursuit of the scattered remnants of the great south- 
ern herd through the Pan-handle of Texas and on into the Staked Plain 
itself. By that time the market had become completely overstocked 
with robes, and the prices received by Andrews and other hunters was 
only 65 cents each for cow robes and $1.15 each for bull robes, deliv- 
ered on the range, the purchaser providing for their transportation to 
the railway. But even at those prices, which were so low as to make 
buffalo killing seem like downright murder, Mr. Andrews assured me 
that he " made big money." On one occasion, when he " got a stand " 
on a large bunch of buffalo, he fired one hundred and fifteen shots from 
one spot, and killed sixty-three buffaloes in about an hour. 

In 1880 buffalo hunting as a business ceased forever in the South- 
west, and so far as can be ascertained, but one successful hunt for robes 
has been made in that region since that time. That occurred in the 
fall and winter of 1887, about 100 miles north of Tascosa, Texas, when 
two parties, one of which was under tbe leadership of Lee Howard, at- 
tacked the only band of buffaloes left alive in the Southwest, and which 
at that time numbered about two hundred head. The two parties killed 
fifty-two buffaloes, of which ten skins were preserved entire for mount- 
ing. Of the remaining forty-two, the heads were cut off and preserved 
for mounting and the skins were prepared as robes.. The mountable 
skins were finally sold at the following prices : Young cows, $50 to $60; 
adult cows, $75 to $100; adult bull, $150. The unmounted heads sold 
as follows : Young bulls, $25 to $30 ; adult bulls, $50 ; young cows, $10 
to $12; adult cows, $15 to $25. A few of the choicest robes sold at 
$20 each, and the remainder, a lot of twenty eight, of prime quality and 
in excellent condition, were purchased by the Hudson's Bay Fur Com- 
pany for $350. 

Such was the end of the great southern herd. In 1871 it contained 
certainly no fewer than three million buffaloes, and by the beginning of 
1875 its existence as a herd had utterly ceased, and nothing but scat- 
tered, fugitive bands remained. 

7. The Destruction of the Northern Herd. — Until the building of the 
Northern Pacific Railway there were but two noteworthy outlets for 
the buffalo robes that were taken annually in the Northwestern Terri- 
tories of the United States. The principal one was the Missouri River, 
and the Yellowstone River was the other. Down these streams the 
hides were transported by steam-boats to the nearest railway shipping 
point. For fifty years prior to the building of the Northern Pacific 
Railway in 1880-'82, the number of robes marketed every year by way 
of these streams was estimated variously at from fifty to one hundred 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 503 

thousand. A great number of hides taken in the British Possessions 
fell into the hands of the Hudson's Bay Company, and found a market 
in Canada. 

In May, 1881, the Sioux City (Iowa) Journal contained the following 
information in regard to the buffalo robe "crop" of the previous hunt- 
ing season — the winter of 1880-'81 : 

"It is estimated by competent authorities that one hundred thousand 
buffalo hides will be shipped out of the Yellowstone country this season. 
Two firms alone are negotiating for the transportation of twenty-five 
thousand hides each. * * * Most of our citizens saw the big load 
of buffalo hides that the G. K. Peck brought down last season, a load 
that hid everything about the boat below the roof of the hurricane 
deck. There were ten thousand hides in that load, and they were all 
brought out of the Yellowstone on one trip and transferred to the G. 
Jv. Peck. How such a load could have been piled on the little Terry 
not even the men on the boat appear to know. It hid every part of 
the boat, barring only the, pilot-house and smoke-stacks. But such a 
load will not be attempted again. For such boats as ply the Yellow- 
stone there are at least fifteen full loads of buffalo hides and other 
pelts. Reckoning one thousand hides to three car loads, and adding 
to this fifty cars for the other pelts, it will take at least three hundred and 
fifty box-cars to carry this stupendous bulk of peltry East to market. 
I hese figures are not guesses, but estimates made by men whose busi- 
ness it is to know about the amount of hides and furs awaiting ship- 
ment. 

"Nothing like it has ever been known in the history of the fur trade. 
Last season the output of buffalo hides was above the average, and 
last year only about thirty thousand hides came out of the Yellowstone 
country, or less than a third of what is there now awaiting shipment. 
The past severe winter caused the buffalo to bunch themselves in a few 
valleys where there was pasturage, and there the slaughter went on all 
winter. There was no sport about it, simply shooting down the famine- 
tamed animals as cattle might be shot down in a barn-yard. To the 
credit of the Indians it can be said that they killed no more than they 
could save the meat from. The greater part of the slaughter was done 
by white hunters, or butchers rather, who followed the business of 
killing and skinning buffalo by the month, leaving the carcasses to rot." 

At the time of the great division made by the Union Pacific Railway 
the northern body of buffalo extended from the valley of the Platte 
River northward to the southern shore of Great Slave Lake, east- 
ward almost to Minnesota, and westward to an elevation of 8,000 feet 
in the Rocky Mountains. The herds were most numerous along the 
central portion of this region (see map), and from the Platte Valley to 
Great Slave Lake the range was continuous. The buffalo population of 
the southern half of this great range was, according to all accounts, 
nearly three times as great as that of the northern half. At that time, 



504 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

or, let us say, 1870, there were about four million buffaloes south of the 
Platte River, and probably about one million and a half north of it. I 
am aware that the estimate of the number of buffaloes in the great 
northern herd is usually much higher than this, but I can see no good 
grounds for making it so. To my mind, the evidence is conclusive that, 
although the northern herd ranged over such an immense area, it was 
numerically less than half the size of the overwhelming multitude which 
actually crowded the southern range, and at times so completely con- 
sumed the herbage of the plains that detachments of the United States 
Army found it difficult to find sufficient grass for their mules and 
horses.* 

The various influences which ultimately led to the complete blotting 
out of the great northern herd were exerted about as follows : 

In the British Possessions, where the country was immense and game 
of all kinds except buffalo very scarce indeed; wh^re, in the language 
of Professor Kenaston, the explorer, u there was a great deal of country 
around every wild animal," the buffalo constituted the main dependence 
of the Indians, who would not cultivate the soil at all, and of the half- 
breeds, who would not so long as they could find buffalo. Under such 
circumstances the buffaloes of the British Possessions were hunted 
much more vigorously and persistently than those of the United States, 
where there was such an abundant supply of deer, elk, antelope, and 
other game for the Indians to feed upon, and a paternal government to 
support them with annuities besides. Quite contrary to the prevailing 
idea of the people of the United States, via., that there were great herds 
of buffaloes in existence in the Saskatchewan country long after ours 
had all been destroyed, the herds of British America had been almost 
totally exterminated by the time the final slaughter of our northern 
herd was inaugurated by the opening of the Northern Pacific Railway 
in 1880. The Canadian Pacific Railway played no part whatever in 
the extermination of the bison in the British Possessions, for it had 
already taken place. The half-breeds of Manitoba, the Plains Crees of 
Qu'Appelle, and the Blackfeet of the South Saskatchewan country 
swept bare a great belt of country stretching east and west between 
the Rocky Mountains and Manitoba. The Canadian Pacific Railway 
found only bleaching bones in the country through which it passed. 
The buffalo had disappeared from that entire region before 1879 and 
left the Blackfeet Indians on the verge of starvation. A few thou- 
sand buffaloes still remained in the country around the head waters "of 
the Battle River, between the North and South Saskatchewan, but they 
were surrounded and attacked from all sides, and their numbers dimin- 
ished very rapidly until all were killed. 

*As an instance of this, see Forest and Stream, vol. n, p. 184: "Horace Jones, 
the interpreter here [Fort Sill], says that on his first trip along the line of the one 
hundredth meridian, in 1859, accompanying Major Thomas — since our nohle old gen- 
eral — they passed continuous herds for over GO miles, which left so little grass hehind 
them that Major Thomas was seriously troubled about his horses." 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON, 505 

'The latest information I have been able to obtain in regard to the dis- 
appearance of this northern band has been kindly furnished by Prof. 
0. A. Kenaston, who in 1881, and also in 1883, made a thorough explo- 
ration of the country between Winnipeg and Fort Edmonton for the 
Canadian Pacific Railway Company. His four routes between the two 
points named covered a vast scope of country, several hundred miles 
in width. In 1881, at Moose Jaw, 75 miles southeast of The Elbow of 
the South Saskatchewan, he saw a party of Cree Indians, who had just 
arrived from the northwest with several carts laden with fresh buffalo 
meat. At Fort Saskatchewan, on the North Saskatchewan River, just 
above Edmonton, he saw a party of English sportsmen who had re- 
cently been hunting on the Battle and Red Deer Rivers, between Ed- 
monton and Fort Kalgary, where they had found buffaloes, and killed 
as many as they cared to slaughter. In one afternoon they killed four- 
teen, and could have killed more had they been more blood-thirsty. In 
1883 Professor Kenaston found the fresh trail of a band of twenty-five 
or thirty buffaloes at The Elbow of the South Saskatchewan. Excepting 
in the above instances he saw no further traces of buffalo, nor did he 
hear of the existence of any in all the country he explored. In 1881 
he saw many Cree Indians at Fort Qu'Appelle in a starving condition, 
and there was no pemmican or buffalo meat at the fort. In 1883, how- 
ever, a little pemmican found its way to Winnipeg, where it sold at 15 
cents per pound; an exceedingly high price. It had been made that 
year, evidently in the month of April, as he purchased it in May for his 
journey. 

The first really alarming impressiou made on our northern herd was 
by the Sioux Indians, who very speedily exterminated that portion of 
it which had previously covered the country lying between the North 
Platte and a line drawn from the center of Wyomiug to the center of 
Dakota. All along the Missouri River from Bismarck to Fort Benton, 
and along the Yellowstone to the head of navigation, the slaughter 
went bravely on. All the Indian tribes of that vast region — Sioux, 
Cheyennes, Crows, Blackfeet, Bloods, Piegans, Assinniboines, Gros 
Ventres, and Shoshones — found their most profitable business and 
greatest pleasure (next to scalping white settlers) in hunting the buffalo. 
It took from eight to twelve buffalo hides to make a covering for one 
ordinary teepee, and sometimes a single teepee of extra size required 
from twenty to twenty-five hides. 

The Indians of our northwestern Territories marketed about seventy- 
five thousand buffalo robes every year so long as the northern herd 
was large enough to afford the supply. If we allow that for every skin 
sold to white traders four others were used in supplying their own 
wants, which must be considered a very moderate estimate, the total 
number of buffalos slaughtered annually by those tribes must have 
been about three hundred and seventy-five thousand. 

The end which so many observers had for years been predicting 



506 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

really began (with the northern herd) in 1876, two years after the great 
annihilation which had taken place in the South, although it was Dot 
uutil four years later that the slaughter became universal over the en- 
tire range. It is very clearly indicated in the figures given in a letter 
iroin Messrs. I. G. Baker & Co., of Fort Benton, Montana, to the writer, 
dated October 6, 1887, which reads as follows : 

" There were sent East from the year 1876 from this point about sev- 
enty-five thousand buffalo robes. In 1880 it had fallen to about twenty 
thousand, in 1883 not more than five thousand, and in 1884 none 
whatever. We are sorry we can not give you a better record, but the 
collection of hides which exterminated the buffalo was from the Yellow- 
stone country on the Northern Pacific, instead of northern Montana." 

The beginning of the final slaughter of our northern herd may be dated 
about 1880, by which time the annual robe crop of the Indians had 
diminished three-fourths, and when summer killing for hairless hides 
began on a large scale. The range of this herd was surrounded on three 
sides by tribes of Indians, armed with breech-loading rifles and abun- 
dantly supplied with fixed ammunition. Up to the year 1880 the Indi- 
ans of the tribes previously mentioned killed probably three times as 
many buffaloes as did the white hunters, and had there not been a white 
hunter in the whole Northwest the buffalo would have been extermi- 
nated there just as surely, though not so quickly by perhaps ten years, 
as actually occurred. Along the north, from the Missouri Eiver to the 
British line, and from the reservation in northwestern Dakota to the 
main divide of the Rocky Mountains, a distance of 550 miles as the 
crow flies, the country was one continuous Indian reservation, inhab- 
ited by eight tribes, who slaughtered buffalo in season and out of sea- 
son, in winter for robes and in summer for hides and meat to dry. In 
the Southeast was the great body of Sioux, and on the Southwest the 
Crows and Northern Cheyennes, all engaged in the same relentless 
warfare. It would have required a body of armed men larger than the 
whole United States Army to have withstood this continuous hostile 
pressure without ultimate annihilation. 

Let it be remembered, therefore, that the American Indian is as much 
responsible for the extermination of our northern herd of bison as the 
American citizen. I have yet to learn of an instance wherein an Indian 
refrained from excessive slaughter of game through motives of economy, 
or care for the future, or prejudice against wastefulness. From all ac- 
counts the quantity of game killed by an Indian has always been limited 
by two conditions only — lack of energy to kill more, or lack of more 
game to be killed. White men delight in the chase, and kill for the 
" sport " it yields, regardless of the effort involved. Indeed, to a genu- 
ine sportsman, nothing in hunting is "sport" which is not obtained at 
the cost of great labor. An Indian does not view the matter in that 
light, and when he has killed enough to supply his wants, he stops, 
because he sees no reason why he should exert himself any further. 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 507 

This has given rise to the statement, so often repeated, that the Indian 
killed only enough buffaloes to supply his wants. If an Indian ever 
attempted, or even showed any inclination, to husband the resources of 
nature in any way, and restrain wastefulness on the part of Indians, it 
would be gratifying to know of it. 

The building of the Northern Pacific Railway across Dakota and 
Montana hastened the end that was fast approaching ; but it was only 
an incident in the annihilation of the northern herd. Without it the 
final result would have been just the same, but the end would probably 
not have been reached until about 1888. 

The Northern Pacific Railway reached Bismarck, Dakota, on the Mis- 
souri River, in the year 1876, and from that date onward received for 
transportation eastward all the buffalo robes and hides that came down 
the two rivers, Missouri and Yellowstone. 

Unfortunately the Northern Pacific Railway Company kept no sep- 
arate account of its buffalo product business, and is unable to furnish 
a statement of the number of hides and robes it handled. It is there- 
fore impossible to even make an estimate of the total number of buffa- 
loes killed on the northern range during the six years which ended with 
the annihilation of that herd. 

In regard to the business done by the Northern Pacific Railway, and 
the precise points from whence the bulk of the robes were shipped, the 
following letter from Mr. J. M. Hannaford, traffic manager of the North- 
ern Pacific Railroad, under date of September 3, 1887, is of interest. 

"Your communication, addressed to President Harris, has been re- 
ferred to me for the information desired. 

"I regret that our accounts are not so kept as to enable me to fur- 
nish you accurate data ; but I have been able to obtain the following- 
general information, which may prove of some value to you : 

"From the years 1876 and 1880 our line did not extend beyond Bis- 
marck, which was the extreme easterly shipping point for buffalo robes 
and hides, they being brought down the Missouri River from the north 
for shipment from that point. In the years 1876, 1877, 1878, and 1879 
there were handled at that point yearly from three to four thousand 
bales of robes, about one-half the bales containing ten robes and the 
other half twelve robes each. During these years practically no hides 
were shipped. In 1880 the shipment of hides, dry and un tanned, com- 
menced,* and in 1881 and 1882 our line was extended west, and the 
shipping points increased, reaching as far west as Terry and Sully 
Springs, in Montana. During these years, 1880, 1881, and 1882, which 
practically finished the shipments of hides and robes, it is impossible 

* It is to be noted that hairless hides, taken from buffaloes hilled in summer, are what 
the writer refers to. It was not until 1881, when the end was very near, that hunting 
buffalo in summer as well as winter became a wholesale business. What hunting 
can be more disgraceful tban the slaughter of females and young in summer, when 
skins are almost worthless. 



508 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

for me to give you any just idea of the number shipped. The only fig- 
ures obtainable are those of 1881, when over seventy-five thousand 
dry and untanned buffalo hides came down the river for shipment from 
Bismarck. Some robes were also shipped from this point that year, 
and a considerable number of robes and hides were shipped from 
several other shipping points. 

"The number of pounds of buffalo meat shipped over our line has 
never cut any figure, the bulk of the meat having been left on the 
prairie, as not being of sufficient value to pay the cost of transportation. 

"The names of the extreme eastern and western stations from which 
shipments were made are as follows : In 1880, Bismarck was the only 
shipping point. In 18^1, Glendive, Bismarck, and Beaver Creek. In 
1882, Terry and Sully Springs, Montana, were the chief shipping points, 
and in the order named, so far as numbers and amount of shipments are 
concerned. Bismarck on the east and Forsyth on the west were the 
two ex'tremities. 

"Up to the year 1880, so long as buffalo were killed only for robes, 
the bands did not decrease very materially ; but beginning with that 
year, when they were killed for their hides as well, a most indiscrimi- 
nate slaughter commenced, and from that time on they disappeared 
very rapidly. Up to the year 1881 there were two large bands, one 
south of the Yellowstone and the other north of that river. In the year 
mentioned those south of the river were driven north and never re- 
turned, having joined the northern band, and become practically ex- 
tinguished. 

"Since 1882 there have, of course, been occasional shipments both of 
hides and robes, but in such small quantities and so seldom that they 
cut practically no figure, the bulk of them coming probably from north 
Missouri points down the river to Bismarck." 

In 1880 the northern buffalo range embraced the following streams: 
The Missouri and all its tributaries, from Fort Shaw, Montana, to Fort 
Bennett, Dakota, and the Yellowstone and all its tributaries. Of this 
region, Miles City, Montana, was the geographical center. The grass 
was good over the whole of it, and the various divisions of the great 
herd were continually shifting from one locality to another, often making 
journeys several hundred miles at a time. Over the whole of this vast 
area their bleaching bones lie scattered (where they have not as yet 
been gathered up for sale) from the Upper Marias and Milk Bivers, near 
the British boundary, to the Platte, and from the James Biver, in cen- 
tral Dakota, to an elevation of 8,000 feet in the Bocky Mountains. In- 
deed, as late as October, 1887, I gathered up on the open common, 
within half a mile of the Northern Pacific Bailway depot at the city of 
Helena, the skull, horns, and numerous odd bones of a large bull buf- 
falo which had been killed there. 

Over many portions of the northern range the traveler may even 
now ride for days together without once being out of sight of buffalo

carcasses, or bones. Such was the case in 1886 in the country lying 
between the Missouri and the Yellowstone, northwest of Miles City. 
Go wherever we might, on divides, into bad lands, creek-bottoms, or on 
the highest, plateaus, we always found the inevitable and omnipresent 
grim and ghastly skeleton, with hairy head, dried-up and shriveled 
nostrils, half-skinned legs stretched helplessly upon the gray turf, and 
the bones of the body bleached white as chalk. 

The year 1881 witnessed the same kind of a stampede for the north- 
ern buffalo range that occurred just ten years previously in the south. 
At that time robes were worth from two to three times as much as they 
ever had been in the south, the market was very active, and the success- 
ful hunter was sure to reap a rich reward as long as the buffaloes lasted. 
At that time the hunters and hide-buyers estimated that there were 
five hundred thousand buffaloes within a radius of 150 miles of Miles 
City, and that there were still in the entire northern herd not far from 
one million head. The subsequent slaughter proved that these esti- 
mates were probably not far from the truth. In that year Fort Custer 
was so nearly overwhelmed by a passing herd that a detachment of sol- 
diers was ordered out to turn the herd away from the post. In 1882 
an immense herd appeared on the high, level plateau on the north 
side of the Yellowstone which overlooks Miles City and Fort Keogh 
in the valley below. A squad of soldiers from the Fifth Infantry 
was sent up on the bluff, aud in less than an hour had killed euough 
buffaloes to load six four-mule teams with meat. In 188G there were 
still about twenty bleaching skeletons lyiug in a group on the edge of 
this plateau at the point where the road from the ferry reaches the level, 
but all the rest had been gathered up. 

In 1882 there were, so it is estimated by men who were in the country, 
no fewer than five thousand white hunters and skinners on the northern 
range. Lieut. J. M. T. Partello declares that " a cordon of camps, from 
the Upper Missouri, where it bends to the west, stretched toward the set- 
ting sun as far as the dividing line of Idaho, completely blocking in the 
great ranges of the Milk River, the Musselshell, Yellowstone, and the 
Marias, aud rendering it impossible for scarcely a single bison to escape 
through the chain of sentinel camps to the Canadian northwest. Hunt- 
ers of Nebraska, Wyoming, and Colorado drove the poor hunted ani- 
mals north, directly into the muzzles of the thousands of repeaters ready 
to receive them. * * * Only a few short years ago, as late as 1883, 
a herd of about seventy-five thousand crossed the Yellowstone River 
a few miles south of here [Fort Keogh], scores of Iucliaus, pot-hunters, 
aud white butchers on their heels, bound for the Canadian dominions, 
where they hoped to find a haven of safety. Alas! not five thousand 
of that mighty mass ever lived to reach the British border line." 

It is difficult to say (at least to the satisfaction of old hunters) which 
were the most famous hunting grounds on the northern range. Lieu- 
tenant Partello states that when he hunted in the great triangle bounded 



510 l.EPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887, 

by the three rivers, Missouri, Musselshell, and Yellowstone, it contained, 
to the best of his knowledge and belief, two hundred and fifty thousand 
buffaloes. Unquestionably that region yielded an immense number of 
buffalo robes, and since the slaughter thousands of tons of bones have 
been gathered up there. Another favorite locality was the country 
lying between the Powder River and the Little Missouri, particularly 
the valleys of Beaver and O'Fallon Creeks. Thither went scores of 
"outfits" and hundreds of hunters and skinners "from the Northern Pa- 
cific Railway towns from Miles City to Glendive. The hunters from the 
towns between Glendive and Bismarck mostly went south to Cedar 
Creek and the Grand and Moreau Rivers. But this territory was also 
the hunting ground of the Sioux Indians from the great reservation 
farther south. 

Thousands upon thousands of buffaloes were killed on the Milk and 
Marias Rivers, in the Judith Basin, and in northern Wyoming. 

The method of slaughter has already been fully described under the 
head of " the still-hunt," and need not be recapitulated. It is some grati- 
fication to know that the shocking and criminal wastefulness which was 
so marked a feature of the southern butchery was almost wholly un- 
known in the north. Robes were worth from $1.50 to $3.50, according 
to size and quality, and were removed and preserved with great care. 
Every one hundred robes marketed represented not more than one 
hundred and ten dead buffaloes, aud even this small percentage of loss 
was due to the escape of wounded animals which afterward died and 
were devoured by the wolves. After the skin was taken off the hunter 
or skinner stretched it carefully upon the ground, inside uppermost, 
cut his initials in the adherent subcutaneous muscle, and left it until 
the season for hauling in the robes, which was always done in the early 
spring, immediately following the hunt. 

As was the case in the south, it was the ability of a single hunter to 
destroy an entire bunch of buffalo in a single day that completely anni- 
hilated the remaining thousands of the northern herd before the people 
of the United States even learned what was going on. For example, 
one hunter of my acquaintance, Vic. Smith, the most famous hunter in 
Montana, killed one hundred and seven buffaloes in one " stand," in 
about one hour's time, aud without shifting his point of attack. This 
occurred in the Red Water country, about 100 miles northeast of Miles 
City, in the winter of 1881-'82. During the same season another hunter, 
named "Doc." Aughl, killed eighty-five buffaloes at one "stand," and 
John Edwards killed seventy-five. The total number that Smith claims 
to have killed that season is " about five thousand." Where buffaloes 
were at all plentiful, every man who called himself a hunter was ex- 
pected to kill between one and two thousand during the hunting season — 
from November to February — and when the buffaloes were to be found 
it was a comparatively easy thing to do. 

During the year 1882 the thousands of bison that still remained alive 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON, 511 

on the range indicated above, and also marked out on the accompany- 
ing map, were distributed over that entire area very generally. In Feb- 
ruary of that year a Fort Benton correspondent of Forest and Stream 
wrote as follows : " It is truly wonderful how many buffalo are still left. 
Thousands of Indians and hundreds of white men depend on them for 
a living. At present nearly all the buffalo in Montana are between 
Milk Eiver and Bear Paw Mountains. There are only a few small bands 
between the Missouri and the Yellowstone." There were plenty of buf- 
falo on the Upper Marias Biver in October, 1882. In November and 
December there were thousands between the Missouri and the Yellow- 
stone Bivers. South of the Northern Pacific Bailway the range during 
the hunting season of 1882-'83 was thus defined by a hunter who has 
since written out the "Confessions of a Buffalo Butcher" for Forest 
and Stream (vol. xxiv, p. 489) : " Then [October, 1882] the western limit 
was defined in a general way by Powder Biver, and extending eastward 
well toward the Missouri and south to within fiO or 70 miles of the Black 
Hills. It embraces the valleys of all tributaries to Powder Biver from 
the east, all of the valleys of Beaver Creek, O'Fallon Creek, and the Lit- 
tle Missouri and Moreau Bivers, and both forks of the Cannon Ball for 
almost half their length. This immense territory, lying almost equally 
in Montana and Dakota, had been occupied during the winters by many 
thousands of buffaloes from time immemorial, and many of the cows 
remained during the summer and brought forth their young undis- 
turbed." 

The three hunters composing the party whose record is narrated in 
the interesting sketch referred to, went out from Miles City on October 
23, 1882, due east to the bad lands between the Powder Biver and 
O'Fallon Creek, and were on the range all winter. They found com- 
paratively few buffaloes, and secured only two hundred and eighty-six 
robes, which they sold at an average price of $2.20 each. They saved 
and marketed a large quantity of meat, for which they obtained 3 cents 
per pound. They fouud the whole region in which they hunted fairly 
infested with Indians and half-breeds, all hunting buffalo. 

The hunting season which began in October, 1882, and ended in Feb- 
ruary, 1883, finished the annihilation of the great northern herd, and left 
but a few small bands of stragglers, numbering only a very few thousand 
individuals all told. A noted event of the season was the retreat north- 
ward across the Yellowstone of the immense herd mentioned by Lieu- 
tenant Partello as containing seventy-five thousand head; others esti- 
mated the number at fifty thousand; and the event is often spoken of 
to-day by frontiersmen who were in that region at the time. Many 
think that the whole great body went north into British territory, and 
that there is still a goodly remnant of it in some remote region between 
the Peace Biver and the Saskatchewan, or somewhere there, which will 
yet return to the United States. Nothing could be more illusory than 
this belief In the first place, the herd never reached the British line, 



512 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

and, if it had, it would have been promptly annihilated by the hungry 
Blackfeet and Cree Indians, who were declared to be in a half-starved 
condition, through the disappearance of the buffalo, as early as 1879. 

The great herd that "went north" was utterly extinguished by the 
white hunters along the Missouri River and the Indians living north of 
it. The only vestige of it that remained was a band of about two hun- 
dred individuals that took refuge in the labyrinth of ravines and creek 
bottoms that lie west of the Musselshell between Flat Willow and Box 
Elder Creeks, and another band of about seventy-five which settled in 
the bad lands between the head of the Big Dry and Big Porcupine 
Creeks, where a few survivors were found by the writer in 1886. . 

South of the Northern Pacific Railway, a baud of about three hundred 
settled permanently in and around the Yellowstone National Park, but 
in a very short time every animal outside of the protected limits of the 
park was killed, and whenever any of the park buffaloes strayed be- 
yound the boundary they too were promptly killed for their heads and 
hides. At present the number remaining in the park is believed by 
Captain Harris, the superintendent, to be about two hundred; about 
one-third of which is due to breeding in the protected territory. 

In the southeast the fate of that portion of the herd is well known. 
The herd which at the beginning of the hunting season of 1883 was 
known to contain about ten thousand head, and ranged in western Da- 
kota, about half way between the Black Hills and Bismarck, between 
the Moreau and Grand Elvers, was speedily reduced to about one 
thousand head. Vic. Smith, who was " in at the death," says there were 
eleven hundred, others say twelve hundred. Just at this juncture 
(October, 1883) Sitting Bull and his whole band of nearly one thousand 
braves arrived from the Standing Bock Agency, and in two days' time 
slaughtered the entire herd. Vic. Smith and a host of white hunters 
took part in the killing of this last ten thousand, and he declares that 
" when we got through the hunt there was not a hoof left. That wound 
up the buffalo in the Far West, only a stray bull being seen here and 
there afterwards." 

Curiousty enough, not even the buffalo-hunters themselves were at the 
time aware of the fact that the end of the hunting season of 1882-'83 
was also the end of the buffalo, at least as an inhabitant of the plains 
and a source of revenue. In the autumn of 1883 they nearly all out- 
fitted as usual, often at an expense oi many hundreds of dollars, and 
blithely sought "the range" that had up to that time been so prolific 
in robes. The end was in nearly every case the same— total failure and 
bankruptcy. It was indeed hard to believe that not only the millions, 
but also the thousands, had actually gone, and forever. 

I have found it impossible to ascertain definitely the number of robes 
and hides shipped from the northern range during the last years of the 
slaughter, and the only reliable estimate I have obtained was made for 
me, after much consideration and reflection, by Mr. J. N. Davis, of Min~ 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 513 

neapolis, Minnesota, Mr. Davis was for many years a buyer of furs, 
robes, and hhles on a large scale throughout our Northwestern Terri- 
tories, and was actively engaged in baying up buffalo robes as long as 
there were any to buy. In reply to a letter asking for statistics, he wrote 
ine as follows, on September 27, 1887 : 

"It is impossible to give the exact number of robes and hides shipped 
out of Dakota and Montana from 1876 to 1883, or the exact number of 
buffalo in the northern herd ; but I will give you as correct an account 
as any one can. In 1876 it was estimated that there were half a million 
buffaloes within a radius of 150 miles of Miles City. In 1881 the North- 
ern Pacific Railroad was built as far west as Glendive and Miles City. 
At that time the whole country was a howling wilderness, and Indians 
and wild buffalo were too numerous to mention. The first shipment of 
buffalo robes, killed by white men, was made that year, and the sta- 
tions on the Northern Pacific Railroad between Miles City and Mandan 
sent out about fifty thousand hides and robes. In 1882 the number of 
hides and robes bought and shipped was about two hundred thousand, 
and in 1883 forty thousand. In 1884 I shipped from Dickinson, Da- 
kota Territory, the only car load of robes that went East that year, and 
it was the last shipment ever made." 

For a long time the majority of the ex-hunters cherished the fond de- 
lusion that the great herd had onby "gone north" into the British Pos- 
sessions, and would eventually return in great force. Scores of rumors 
of the findiug of herds floated about, all of which were eagerly believed 
at first. But after a year or two had gone by without the appearance 
of a single buffalo, and likewise without any reliable information of the 
existence of a herd of any size, even in British territory, the butchers 
of the buffalo either hung up their old Sharps rifles, or sold them for 
nothing to the gun-dealers, and sought other means of livelihood. 
Some took to gathering up buffalo bones and selling them by the ton, 
and others became cowboys. 

V. Congressional Legislation for the Protection of the 

Bison. 

The slaughter of the buffalo down to the very point of extermination 
has been so very generally condemned, and the general Government 
has been so unsparingly blamed for allowing such a massacre to take 
place on the public domain, it is important that the public should know 
all the facts in the case. To the credit of Congress it must be said that 
several very determined efforts were made betwen the years 1871 and 
1876 looking toward the protection of the buffalo. The failure of all 
those well-meant efforts was due to our republican form of Government. 
Had this Goverment been a monarchy the buffalo would have been pro- 
tected 5 but unfortunately in this case (perhaps the only one on record 
wherein a king could have accomplished more than the representatives 
of the people) the necessary act of Congress was so hedged in and beset 
H, Mis. .00, pt.2-— 33 



514 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

by obstacles that it never became an accomplished fact. Even when 
both houses of Congress succeeded in passing a suitable act (June 23, 
1874) it went to the President in the last days of the session only to be 
pigeon-holed, and die a natural death. 

The following is a complete history of Congressional legislation in 
regard to the protection of the buffalo from wanton slaughter and 
ultimate extinction. The first step taken in behalf of this persecuted 
animal was on March 13, 1871, when Mr. McCormick, of Arizona, intro- 
duced a bill (H. E. 157), which was ordered to be printed. Nothing 
further was done with it. It read as follows : 

Be it enacted, etc., That, excepting for the purpose of using the meat for food or 
preserving the skin, it shall be unlawful for any person to kill the bison, or buffalo, 
found anywhere upon the public lands of the United States; and for the violation 
of this law the offender shall, upon conviction before any court of competent juris- 
diction, be liable to a line of $100 for each animal killed, one-half of which sum shall, 
upon its collection, be paid to the informer. 

On February 14, 1872, Mr. Cole, of California, introduced in the Sen- 
ate the following resolution, which was considered by unanimous con- 
sent and agreed to : 

Besolved, That the Committee on Territories be directed to inquire into the expedi- 
ency of enacting a law for the protection of the buffalo, elk, antelope, and other 
useful animals running wild in the Territories of the United States against indis- 
criminate slaughter and extermination, and that they report by bill or otherwise. 

On February 16, 1872, Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts, introduced a 
bill in the Senate (S. 655) restricting the killing of the buffalo upon the 
public lands; which was read twice by its title and referred to the Com- 
mittee on Territories. 

On April 5, 1872, Mr. R. C. McCormick, of Arizona, made a speech in 
the House of Representatives, while it was in Committee of the Whole, 
on the restriction of the killing of buffalo. 

He mentioned a then recent number of Harper's Weekly, in which 
were illustrations of the slaughter of buffalo, aud also read a partly 
historical extract in regard to the same. He related how, when he was 
once snow-bound upon the Kansas Pacific Railroad, the buffalo fur- 
nished food for himself and fellow-passengers. Then he read the bill 
introduced by him March 13, 1871, and also copies of letters fur- 
nished him by Henry Bergh, president of the American Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which were sent to the latter by 
General W. B. Hazen, Lieut. Col. A. G. Brackett, and E. W. Wynkoop. 
He also read a statement by General Hazen to the effect that he knew 
of a man who killed ninety-nine buffaloes with his own hand in one 
day. lie also spoke ou the subject of cross-breeding the buffalo with 
common cattle, and read an extract in regard to it from the San Fran- 
cisco Post.* 

On April 6, 1872, Mr. McCormick asked leave to have printed in the 

* Congressional Globe (Appendix), second session Forty-second Congress, 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 515 

Globe some remarks he had prepared regarding restricting the killing 
of buffalo, which was granted.* 

On January 5, 1874, Mr. Fort, of Illinois, introduced a bill (H. E. 
921) to prevent the useless slaughter of buffalo within the Territories 
of the United States; which was read and referred to the Committee 
on the Territories.t 

On March 10, 1874, this bill was reported to the House from the Com- 
mittee on the Territories, with a recommendation that it be passed. £ 

The first section of the bill provided that it shall be unlawful for aay 
person, who is not an Indian, to kill, wound, or in any way destroy any 
female buffalo of any age, found at large within the boundaries of any 
of the Territories of the United States. 

The second section provided that it shall be, in like manner, unlaw- 
ful for any sach person to kill, wound, or destroy in said Territories 
any greater number of male buffaloes than are needed for food by such 
person, or than can be used, cured, or preserved for the food of other 
persons, or for the market. It shall in like manner be unlawful for any 
such person, or persons, to assist, or be in any manner engaged or con- 
cerned in or about such unlawful killing, wounding, or destroying of 
any such buffaloes; that any person who shall violate the provisions of 
the act shall, on conviction, forfeit and pay to the United States the 
sum of $100 for each offense (and each buffalo so unlawfully killed, 
wounded, or destroyed shall be and constitute a separate offense), and 
on a conviction of a second offense may be committed to prison for a 
period not exceeding thirty days ; and that all United States judges, 
justices, courts, an'd legal tribunals in said Territories shall have juris- 
diction in cases of the violation of the law. 

Mr. Cox said he had been told by old hunters that it was impossible 
to tell the sex of a running buffalo; and he also stated that the bill 
gave preference to the Indians. 

Mr. Fort said the object was to prevent early extermination ; that 
thousands were annually slaughtered for skins alone, and thousands for 
their tongues alone; that perhaps hundreds of thousands are killed 
every year in utter wantonuess, with no object for such destruction. 
He had been told that the sexes could be distinguished while they were 
running.§ 

This bill does not prohibit any person joining in a reasonable chase 
and hunt of the buffalo. 

Said Mr. Fort, " So far as I am advised, gentlemen upon this floor 
representing all the Territories are favorable to the passage of this bill."

516 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

Mr. Cox wanted the clause excepting the Indians from the operations 
of the bill stricken out, and stated that the Secretary of the Interior 
had already said to the House that the civilization of the Indian was 
impossible while the buffalo remained on the plains. 

The Clerk read for Mr. McCormick the following extract from the New 
Mexican, a paper published in Santa Fe : 

The buffalo slaughter, which has been going on the past few years on the plains, 
and which increases every year, is wantonly wicked, and should be stopped by the 
most stringent enactments and most vigilant enforcements of the law. Killing these 
noble animals for their hides simply, or to gratify the pleasure of some Russian duke 
or English lord, is a species of vandalism which can not too quickly be checked. 
United States surveying parties report that there are two thousand hunters on the 
plains killing these animals for their hides. One party of sixteen hunters report 
having killed twenty-eight thousand buffaloes during the past summer. It seems to 
us there is quite as much reason why the Government should protect the buffaloes as 
the Indians. 

1 Mr. McCormick considered the subject important, and had not a 
doubt of the fearful slaughter. He read the following extract from a 
letter that he had received from General Hazen : 

I know a man who killed with his own hand ninety-nine buffaloes in one day, with- 
out taking a pound of the meat. The buffalo for food has an intrinsic value about 
equal to an average Texas beef, or say $20. There are probably not less than a mill- 
ion of these animals on the western plains. If the Government owned a herd of a 
million oxen they would at least take steps to prevent this wanton slaughter. The 
railroads have made the buffalo so accessible as to present a case not dissimilar. 

He agreed with Mr. Cox that some features of the bill would probably 
be impracticable, and moved to amend it. He did not believe any bill 
would entirely accomplish the purpose, but he desired that such wan- 
ton slaughter should be stopped. 

Said he, " It would have been well both for the Indians and the 
white men if an enactment of this kind had been placed on our statute- 
books years ago. * * * I know of no one act that would gratify 
the red men more." 

Mr. Holman expressed surprise that Mr. Cox should make any ob- 
jection to parts of the measure. The former regarded the bill as " an 
effort in a most commendable direction," and trasted that it would pass. 

Mr. Cox said he would not have objected to the bill but from the fact 
that it was partial in its provisions. He wanted a bill that would im- 
pose a penalty on every man, red, white, or black, who may wantonly 
kill these buffaloes. 

Mr. Potter desired to know whether more buffaloes were slaughtered 
by the Indians than by white men. 

Mr. Fort thought the white men were doing the greatest amount of 
killing. 

Mr. Eldridge thought there would be just as much propriety in kill- 
ing the fish iu our rivers as in destroying the buffalo in order to compel 
the Indians to become civilized. 

Mr. Conger said : "As a matter of fact, every man knows the range of 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 517 

the buffalo has grown more and more confined year after year ; that 
they have been driven westward before advancing civilization." But he 
opposed the bill! 

Mr. Hawley, of Connecticut, said : u I am glad to see this bill. I am 
in favor of this law, and hope it will pass." 

Mr. Lowe favored the bill, and thought that the buffalo ought to be 
protected for proper utility. 

Mr. Cobb thought they ought to be protected for the settlers, who 
depended partly on them for food. 

Mr. Parker, of Missouri, intimated that the policy of the Secretary of 
the Interior was a sound one, and that the buffaloes ought to be ex- 
terminated, to prevent difficulties in civilizing the Indians. 

Said Mr. Conger, "Ido not think the measure will tend at all to pro- 
tect the buffalo." 

Mr. McCormick replied : " This bill will not prevent the killing of 
buffaloes for any useful purpose, but only their wanton destruction." 

Mr. Kasson said: " I wish to say one word in support of this bill, 
because I have had some experience as to the manner in which these 
buffaloes are treated by hunters. The buffalo is a creature of vast 
utility, * * * . This animal ought to be protected ;***." 

The question being taken on the passage of the bill, there were — ayes 
132, noes not counted. 

So the bill was passed. 

On June 23, 1874, this bill (H. R, 921) came up in the Senate.* 

Mr. Harvey moved, as an amendment, to strike out the words "who 
is not an Indian." 

Said Mr. Hitchcock, "That will defeat the bill." 

Mr. Frelinghuysen said : " That would prevent the Indians from kill- 
ing the buffalo on their own ground. I object to the bill." 

Mr. Sargent said : " I think we can pass the bill in the right shape 
without objection. Let us take it up. It is a very important one." 

Mr. Frelinghuysen withdrew his objection. 

Mr. Harvey thought it was a very important bill, and withdrew his 
amendment. 

The bill was reported to the Senate, ordered to a third reading, read 
the third time, and passed. It went to President Grant for signature, 
and expired in his hands at the adjournment of that session of Con- 
gress. 

On February 2, 1874, Mr. Fort introduced a bill (H. R. 1689) to tax 
buffalo hides; which was referred to the Committee on Ways and 
Means. 

On June 10, 1874, Mr. Dawes, from the Committee on Ways and 
Means, reported back the bill adversely, and moved that it be laid ou 
the table. 

* Congressional Globe, Vol. 2, part 6, Forty-third Congress, first session. 



518 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

Mr. Fort asked to have the bill referred to the Committee of the 
Whole, and it was so referred. 

Ou February 2, 1874, Mr. R. 0. McCormiek, of Arizona, introduced 
in the House a bill (H. R. 1728) restricting the killing of the bison, or 
buffalo, ou the public lands ; which was referred to the Committee on 
the Public Lands, and never heard of more. 

On January 31, 1876, Mr. Fort introduced a bill (H. R. 1719) to pre- 
vent the useless slaughter of buffaloes withiu the Territories of the 
United States, which was referred to the Committee on the Territories.* 

The Committee on the Territories reported back the bill without 
amendment on February 23, 1876.t Its provisions were in every 
respect identical with those of the bill introduced by Mr. Fort in 1874, 
and which jjassed both houses. 

In support of it Mr. Fort said : " The intention ami object of this bill 
is to preserve them [the buffaloes] for the use of the Indians, whose homes 
are upon the public domain, and to the frontiersmen, who may properly 
use them for food. * * * They have been and are now being slaugh- 
tered iu large numbers. * * * Thousands of these noble brutes are 
annually slaughtered out of mere wontonness. * * * This bill, just 
as it is now presented, passed the last Congress. It was not vetoed, 
but fell, as I understand, merely for want of time to consider it after 
having passed both houses." He also intimated that the Government 
was using a great deal of money for cattle to furnish the Indians, while 
the buffalo was being wantonly destroyed, whereas they might be turned 
to their good. 

Mr. Crouuse wanted the words " who is not an Indian" struck out, 
so as to make the bill general. He thought Indians were to blame for 
the wanton destruction. 

Mr. Fort thought the amendment unnecessary, and stated that he 
was informed that the Indians did not destroy the buffaloes wantonly. 

Mr. Dunnell thought the bill one of great importance. 

The Clerk read for him a letter from A. G. Brackett, lieutenant-colonel, 
Second United States Cavalry, stationed at Omaha Barracks, in which 
was a very urgent request to have Congress interfere to prevent the 
wholesale slaughter then going ou. 

Mr. Reagan thought the bill proper and right. He knew from per- 
sonal experience how the wanton slaughtering was going on, and also 
tbat the Indians were not the oues who did it. 

Mr. Townseud, of New York, saw no reason why a white man should 
not be allowed to kill a female buffalo as well as an Indian. He said 
it would be impracticable to have a separate law for each. 

Mr. Magiunis did not agree with him. He thought the bill ought to 
pass as it stood. 

Mr. Throckmorton thought that while the intention of the bill was a

THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 519 

good one, yet it was mischievous and difficult to enforce, and would 
also work hardship to a large portion of our frontier people. He bad 
several objections. He also thought a cow buffalo could not be distin- 
guished at a distance. 

Mr. Hancock, of Texas, thought the bill an impolicy, and that the 
sooner the buffalo was exterminated the better. 

Mr. Fort replied by asking him why all the game — deer, antelope, 
etc. — was not slaughtered also. Then he went on to state that to ex- 
terminate the buffalo would be to starve innocent children of the red 
man, and to make the latter more wild and savage than he was already. 

Mr. Baker, of Indiana, offered the following amendment as a substi- 
tute for the one already offered : 

Provided, That any white person who shall employ, hire, or procure, directly or in- 
directly, any Indian to kill any buffalo forbidden to be killed by this act, shall be 
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and punished in the manner provided in this act. 

Mr. Fort stated that a certain clause in his bill covered the object of 
the amendment. 

Mr. Jenks offered the following amendment: 

Strike out in the fourth line of the second section the word "can" and insert 
"shall;" and in the second line of the same section insert the word "wantonly" 
before " kill ; " so that the clause will read : 

"That it shall be in like manner unlawful for any such person to wantonly kill, 
wound, or destroy in the said Territories any greater number of male buffaloes than 
are needed for food by such person, or than shall be used, cured, or preserved for the 
food of other persons, or for the market." 

Mr. Conger said : " I think the whole bill is unwise. I think it is a 
useless measure." 

Mr. Hancock said : "■ I move that the bill and amendment be laid on 
the table," 

The motion to lay the bill upon the table was defeated, and the 
amendment was rejected. 

Mr. Conger called for a division on the passage of the bill. The 
House divided, and there were — ayes 93, noes 48. He then demanded 
tellers, and they reported — ayes 104, noes 36. So the bill was passed. 

On February 25, 1876, the bill was reported to the Senate, and re- 
ferred to the Committee on Territories, from whence it never returned. 

On March 20, 1876, Mr. Fort introduced a bill (H. R. 2767) to tax 
buffalo hides; which was referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, 
and never heard of afterward. 

This was the last move made in Congress in behalf of the buffalo. 
The philanthropic friends of the frontiersman, the Indian, and of the 
buffalo himself, despaired of accomplishing the worthy object for which 
they had so earnestly and persistently labored, and finally gave up 
the fight. At the very time the effort in behalf of buffalo protection 
was abandoned the northern herd still flourished, and might have been 
preserved from extirpation. 

At various times the legislatures of a few of the Western States and 



520 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

Territories enacted laws vaguely and feebly intended to provide some 
sort of protection to the fast-disappearing animals. One of the first 
was the game law of Colorado, passed in 1872, which declared that the 
killers of game should not leave any flesh to spoil. The western game 
laws of those clays amounted to about as much as they do now; prac- 
tically nothing at all. I have never been able to learn of a single in- 
stance, save in the Yellowstone Park, wherein a western hunter was 
prevented by so simple and innocuous a thing as a game law from kill- 
ing game. Laws were enacted, but they were always left to enforce 
themselves. The idea of the frontiersman (the average, at least) has 
always been to kill as much game as possible before some other fellow 
gets a chance at it, and before it is all Icilled oj} ! So he goes at the game, 
and as a general thing kills all he can while it lasts, and with it feeds 
himself and family, his dogs, and even his hogs, to repletion. I knew 
one Montana man north of Miles City who killed for his own use twenty- 
six, black- tail deer in one season, and had so much more venison than 
he could consume or give away that a great pile of carcasses lay in his 
yard until spring and spoiled. 

During the existence of the buffalo it was declared by many an im- 
possibility to stop or prevent the slaughter. Such an accusation of 
weakness and imbecility on the part of the General Government is an 
insult to our strength and resources. The protection of game is now 
and always has been simply a question of money. A proper code of 
game laws and a reasonable number of salaried game-wardens, sworn 
to enforce them and punish all offenses against them, would have af- 
forded the buffalo as much protection as would have been necessary to 
his continual existence. To be sure, many buffaloes would have been 
killed on the sly in spite of laws to the contrary, but it was wholesale 
slaughter that wrought the extermination, and that could easily have 
been prevented. A tax of 50 cents each on buffalo robes would have 
maintained a sufficient number of game-wardens to have reasonably 
regulated the killing, and maintained for an indefinite period a bounti- 
ful source of supply of food, and also raiment for both the white man 
of the plains and the Indian. By judicious management the buffalo 
could have been made to yield an annual revenue equal to that we now 
receive from the fur-seals — $100,000 per year. 

During the two great periods of slaughter — 1870-'75 and 1880-'84 — the 
principal killing grounds were as well known as the stock-yards of 
Chicago. Had proper laws been enacted, and had either the general 
or territorial governments entered with determination upon the task of 
restricting the killing of buffaloes to proper limits, their enforcement 
would have been, in the main, as simple and easy as the collection of 
taxes. Of course the solitary hunter in a remote locality would have 
bowled over his half dozen buffaloes in secure defiance of the law; but 
such desultory killing could not have made much impression on the 
great mass for many years. The business-like, wholesale slaughter, 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 521 

wherein one hunter would openly kill five thousand buffaloes and mar- 
ket perhaps two thousand hides, could easily have been stopped lorever, 
Buffalo hides could not have been dealt in clandestinely, for mauy 
reasons, and had there been no sale for ill-gotten spoils the still-hunter 
would have gathered no spoils to sell. It was an undertaking of con- 
siderable magnitude, and involving a cash outlay of several hundred 
dollars to make up an " outfit" of wagons, horses, arms and ammuni- 
tion, food, etc., for a trip to "the range" after buffaloes. It was these 
wholesale hunters, both in the North and the South, who exterminated 
the species, and to say that all such undertakings could not have been 
effectually prevented by law is to accuse our law-makers and law-offi- 
cers of imbecility to a degree hitherto unknown. There is nowhere in 
this "country, nor in any of the waters adjacent to it, a living species of 
any kind which the United States Government can not fully and per- 
petually protect from destruction by human agencies if it chooses to do 
so. The destruction of the buffalo was a loss of wealth perhaps twenty 
times greater than the sum it would have cost to conserve it, and this 
stupendous waste of valuable food and other products was committed 
by one class of the American people and permitted by another with a 
prodigality and wastefulness which even in the lowest savages would 
be inexcusable. 

VI. Completeness of the Extermination. 

(May 1, 1889.) 

Although the existence of a few widely-scattered individuals enables 
us to say that the bison is not yet absolutely extinct in a wild state, 
there is no reason to hope that a single wild and unprotected individual 
will remain alive ten years hence. The nearer the species approaches 
to complete extermination, the more eagerly are the wretched fugitives 
pursued to the death whenever found. Western huuters are striving 
for the honor (?) of killing the last buffalo, which, it is to be noted, has 
already been slain about a score of times by that number of hunters. 

The buffaloes still alive in a wild state are so very few, and have been 
so carefully " marked down" by hunters, it is possible to make a very 
close estimate of the total number remaining. In this enumeration the 
small herd in the Yellowstone National Park is classed with other herds 
in captivity and under protection, for the reason that, had it not been 
for the protection afforded by the law and the officers of the Park, not 
one of these buffaloes would be living to-day. Were the restrictions of 
the law removed now, every one of those animals would be killed within 
three months. Their heads alone are worth from $25 to $50 each to 
taxidermists, and for this reason every buffalo is a prize worth the 
hunter's winning. Had it not been for stringent laws, and a rigid en- 
forcement of them by Captain Harris, the last of the Park buffaloes 
would have been shot years ago by Vic. Smith, the Eea Brothers, and 



522 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

other hunters, of whom there is always an able contingent around the 
Park. 

In the United States the death of a buffalo is now such an event that 
it is immediately chronicled by the Associated Press and telegraphed 
all over the country. By reason of this, and from information already 
in hand, we are able to arrive at a very fair understanding of the present 
condition of the species in a wild state. 

In December, 1886, the Smithsonian expedition left about fifteen buf- 
faloes alive in the bad lands of the Missouri-Yellowstone divide, at the 
head of Big Porcupine Creek. In 1887 three of these were killed by 
cowboys, and in 1888 two more, the last death recorded being that of 
an old bull killed near Billings. There are probably eight or ten strag- 
glers still remaining in that region, hiding in the wildest and most broken 
tracts of the bad lauds, as far as possible from the cattle ranches, and 
where even cowboys seldom go save on a round-up. From the fact that 
no other buffaloes, at least so far as can be learned, have been killed in 
Montana during the last two years, I am convinced that the bunch re- 
ferred to are the last representatives of the species remaining in Mon- 
tana. 

In the spring of 1886 Mr. B. C. Winston, while on a hunting trip about 
75 miles west of Grand Rapids, Dakota, saw seven buffaloes. — five adult 
animals and two calves; of which he killed one, a large bull, and caught 
a calf alive. On September 11, 1888, a solitary bull was killed 3 miles 
from the town of Oakes, in Dickey County. There are still three indi- 
viduals in the unsettled country lying between that point and the Mis- 
souri, which are undoubtedly the only wild representatives of the race 
east of the Missouri River. 

On April 28, 1887, Dr. William Stephenson, of the United States Army, 
wrote me as follows from Pilot Butte, about 30 miles north of Rock 
Springs, Wyoming: 

." There are undoubtedly buffalo within 50 or 60 miles of here, two 
having been killed out of a band of eighteen some ten days since by 
cowboys, and another band of four seen near there. I hear from cattle- 
men of their being seen every year north and northeast of here." 

This band was seen once in 1888. In February, 1889, Hon. Joseph 
M. Carey, member of Congress from Wyoming, received a letter inform- 
ing him that this band of buffaloes, consisting of twenty-six head, had 
been seen grazing in the Red Desert of Wyoming, and that the Indians 
were preparing to attack it. At Judge Carey's request the Indian 
Bureau issued orders which it was hoped would prevent the slaughter. 
So, until further developments, we have the pleasure of recording the 
presence of twenty-six wild buffaloes in southern Wyoming. 

There are no buffaloes whatever in the vicinity of the Yellowstone 
Park, either in Wyoming, Montana, or Idaho, save what wander out of 
that reservation, and when any do, they are speedily killed. 

There is a rumor that there are ten or twelve mountain buffaloes still 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 523 

on foot in Colorado, in a region called Lost Park, and, while it lacks 
confirmation, we gladly accept it as a fact. In 18S8 Mr. 0. B. Cory, of 
Boston, saw in Denver, Colorado, eight fresh buffalo skins, which it was 
said had come from the region named above. In 1885 there was a herd 
of about forty "mountain buffalo" near South Park, and although some 
of the number may still survive, the indications are that the total num- 
ber of wild buffaloes in Colorado does not exceed twenty individuals. 

In Texas a miserable remnant of the great southern herd still remains 
in the "Pan-handle country," between the two forks of the Canadian 
River. In 1886 about two hundred head survived, which number by 
the summer of 1887 had been reduced to one hundred, or less. In the 
hunting season of 1887-88 a ranchman named Lee Howard fitted out 
and led a strong party into the haunts of the survivors, and killed fifty- 
two of them. In May, 1888, Mr. C. J. Jones. again visited this region 
for the purpose of capturing buffaloes alive. His party found, from first 
to last, thirty- seven buffaloes, of which they captured eighteen head, 
eleven adult cows and seven calves; the greatest feat ever accomplished 
in buffalo-hunting. It is highly probable that Mr. Jones and his men 
saw about all the buffaloes now living in the Pan-handle country, and 
it therefore seems quite certain that not over twenty five individuals 
remain. These are so few, so remote, and so difficult to reach, it is to 
be hoped no one will consider them worth going after, and that they 
will be left to take care of themselves. It is greatly to be regretted 
that the State of Texas does not feel disposed to make a special effort 
for their protection and preservation. 

In regard to the existence of wild buffaloes in the British Possessions, 
the statements of different authorities are at variance, by far the larger 
number holding the opinion that there are in all the Northwest Terri- 
tory only a few almost solitary stragglers. But there is still good 
reason for the hope, and also the belief, that there still remain in Atha- 
basca, between the Athabasca and Peace Rivers, at least a few hun- 
dred " wood buffalo." In a very interesting and well-considered article 
in the London Field of November 10, 1888, Mr. Miller Christy quotes 
all the available positive evidence bearing on this point, and I gladly 
avail myself of the opportunity to reproduce it here : 

"The Hon. Dr. Schulz, in the recent debate on the Mackenzie River 
basin, in the Canadian senate, quoted Senator Hardisty, of Edmonton, 
of the Hudson's Bay Company, to the effect that the wood buffalo still 
existed in the region in question. ' It was,' he said, ' difficult to estimate 
how many; but probably five or six hundred still remain in scattered 
bauds.' There had been no appreciable difference in their numbers, he 
thought, during the last fifteen years, as they could not be hunted on 
horseback, on account of the wooded character of the country, and were, 
therefore, very little molested. They are larger than the buffalo of the 
great plains, weighing at least 150 pounds more. They are also coarser 
haired and straighter horned. 



524 REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

" The doctor also quoted Mr. Frank Oliver, of Edmonton, to the effect 
that the wood buffalo still exists in small numbers between the Lower 
Peace and Great Slave Eivers, extending westward from the latter to 
the Salt River, in latitude 60 degrees, and also between the Peace and 
Athabasca Eivers. He states that 'they are larger than the prairie 
buffalo, and the fur is darker, but practically they are the same animal.' 
* * * Some buffalo meat is brought in every winter to the Hudson's 
Bay Company's posts nearest the buffalo ranges. 

"Dr. Schulz farther stated that he had received the following tes- 
timony from Mr. Donald Ross, of Edmonton: The wood buffalo still 
exists in the localities named. About 1870 one was killed as far west 
on Peace River as Fort Dunvegan. They are quite different from the 
prairie buffalo, being nearly double the size, as they will dress fully 
700 pounds." 

It will be apparent to most observers, I think, that Mr. Ross's state- 
ment in regard to the size of the wood buffalo is a random shot. 

In a private letter to the writer, under date of October 22, 1887, Mr. 
Harrison S. Young, of the Hudson's Bay Company's post at Edmonton, 
writes as follows : 

" The buffalo are not yet extinct in the Northwest. There are still 
some stray ones on the prairies away to the south of this, but they must 
be very few. I am unable to find any one who has personal knowledge 
of the killing of one during the last two years, though I have since the 
receipt of your letter questioned a good many half-breeds on the sub- 
ject. In our district of Athabasca, along the Salt River, there are still 
a few wood buffalo killed every year, but they are fast diminishing in 
numbers and are also becoming very shy." 

In his " Manitoba aud the Great Northwest " Prof. John Macoun has 
this to say regarding the presence of the wood buffalo in the region re- 
ferred to : 

" The wood buffalo, when I was on the Peace River in 1875, were 
confined to the country lying between the Athabasca and Peace Rivers 
north of latitude 57° 30', or chiefly in the Birch Hills. They were also 
said to be in some abundance on the Salt and Hay Rivers, running into 
the Slave River north of Peace River. The herds thirteen years ago 
[now nineteen] were supposed to number about one thousand, all told. 
I believe many still exist, as the Indians of that region eat fish, which 
are much easier procured than either buffalo or moose, and the country 
is much too difficult for white men." 

All this evidence, when carefully considered, resolves itself into sim- 
ply this aud no more: The only evidence in favor of the existence of 
any live buffaloes between the Athabasca and Peace Rivers is in the 
form of very old rumors, most of them nearly fifteen years old: time 
enough for the Indians to have procured fire-arms in abundance and 
killed all those buffaloes two or three times over. 

Mr. Miller Christy takes " the mean of the estimates," and assumes 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 525 

that there are now about five hundred and fifty buffaloes in the region 
named. If we are to believe in the existence there of any stragglers 
his estimate is a fair one, and we will gladly accept it. The total is 
therefore as follows : 

Number of American bison running wild and unprotected on January 1, 1889. 

In the Pan-handle of Texas 25 

In Colorado 20 

In southern Wyoming 26 

In the Musselshell country, Montana 10 

In western Dakota 4 

Total numher in the United States 85 

In Athabasca, Northwest Territory (estimated) 550 

Total in all North America 635 

Add to the above the total number already recorded in captivity 
(256) and those under Government protection in the Yellowstone Park 
(200), and the whole number of individuals of Bison americanus now 
living is 3,091. 

From this time it is probable that many rumors of the sudden appear- 
ance of herds of buffaloes will become current. Already there have 
been three or four that almost deserve special mention. The first ap- 
peared in March, 1887, when various Western newspapers published a 
circumstantial account of how a herd of about three hundred buffaloes 
swam the Missouri Eiver about 10 miles above Bismarck, near the 
town of Painted Woods, and ran on in a southwesterly direction. A 
letter of inquiry, addressed to Mr. S. A. Peterson, postmaster at Painted 
Woods, elicited the following reply : 

"The whole rumor is false, and without any foundation. I saw it 
first in the — - — newspaper, where I believe it originated." 

In these days of railroads and numberless hunting parties, there is 
not the remotest possibility of there being anywhere in the United 
States a herd of a hundred, or even fifty, buffaloes which has escaped 
observation. Of the eighty-five head still existing in a wild state it 
may safely be predicted that not even one will remain alive five years 
hence. A buffalo is now so great a prize, and by the ignorant it is con- 
sidered so great an honor (?) to kill one, that extraordinary exertions 
will be made to find and shoot down without mercy the " last buffalo." 

There is no possible chance for the race to be perpetuated iu a wild 
state, and in a few years more hardly a bone will remain above ground 
to mark the existence of the most prolific mammalian species that ever 
existed, so far as we know. 

VII. Effects of the Extermination. 

The buffalo supplied the Indian with food, clothing, shelter, bedding, 
saddles, ropes, shields, and innumerable smaller articles of use and 
ornament. In the United States a paternal government takes the place 

I 



526 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 



of the buffalo in supplying all these wants of the red man, and it costs 
several millions of dollars annually to accomplish the task. 

The following are the tribes which depended very largely — some al- 
most wholly — upon the buffalo for the necessities, and many of the 
luxuries, of their savage life until the Government began to support 
them : 



Sioux 30,561 

Crow .' 3,226 

Piegan, Blood, and Blackfeet 2, 026 

Cheyenne 3,477 

Gros Ventres 856

Apache 332 

Ute 978 

Omaha 1,160 

Pawnee 998 

Winnebago 1,222 



Total 54,758 



This enumeration (from the census of 1886) leaves entirely out of con- 
sideration many thousands of Indians living in the Indian Territory 
and other portions of the Southwest, who drew an annual supply of 
meat and robes from the chase of the buffalo, notwithstanding the fact 
that their chief dependence was upon agriculture. 

The Indians of what was once the buffalo country are not starving 
and freezing, for the reason that the United States Government supplies 
them regularly -with beef and blankets in lieu of buffalo. Does any one 
imagine that the Government could not have regulated the killing of 
buffaloes, and thus maintained the supply, for far less money than it 
now costs to feed and clothe those 54,758 Indians ? 

How is it with the Indians of the British Possessions to-day ? 

Prof. John Macoun writes as follows in his " Manitoba and the Great 
Northwest," page 342 : 

"During the last three years [prior to 1883] the great herds have 
been kept south of our boundary, and, as the result of this, our Indians 
have been on the verge of starvation. When the hills were covered 
with countless thousands [of buffaloes] in 1877, the Blackfeet were 
dying of starvation in 1879." 

During the winter of 1886-'87, destitution and actual starvation pre- 
vailed to an alarming extent among certain tribes of Indians in the 
Northwest Territory who once lived bountifully on the buffalo. A ter- 
rible tale of suffering in the Athabasca and Peace River country has 
recently (1888) come to the minister of the interior of the Canadian 
government, in the form of a petition signed by the bishop of that dio- 
cese, six clergymen and missionaries, and several justices of the peace. 
It sets forth that " owing to the destruction of game, the Indians, both 
last winter and last summer, have been in a state of starvation. They 
are now in a complete state of destitution, and are utterly unable to pro- 
vide themselves with clothing, shelter, ammunition, or foodfor the coming 
winter." The petition declares that on account of starvation, and con- 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 527 

sequent cannibalism, a party of twenty-nine Oree Indians was reduced 
to three in the winter of 1886.* Of the Fort Chippewyan Indians, be- 
tween twenty and thirty starved to death last winter, and the death of 
many more was hastened by waDt of food and by famine diseases. Many 
other Indians — Crees, Beavers, and Ghippewyans — at almost all points 
where there are missions or trading posts, would certainly have starved 
to death but for the help given them by the traders and missionaries at 
those places. It is now declared by the signers of the memorial that 
scores of families, having lost their heads by starvation, are now per- 
fectly helpless, and during the coming winter must either starve to 
death or eat one another unless help comes. Heart-rending stories of 
suffering and cannibalism continue to come in from what was once the 
buffalo plains. 

If ever thoughtless people were punished for their reckless improvi- 
dence, the Indians and half-breeds of the Northwest Territory are now 
paying the penalty for the wasteful slaughter of the buffalo a few short 
years ago. The buffalo is his own avenger, to an extent his remorseless 
slayers little dreamed he ever could be. 

VIII. Preservation of the Species from Absolute Extinction. 

There is reason to fear that unless the United States Government 
takes the matter in hand and makes a special effort to prevent it, the 
pure-blood bison will be lost irretrievably through mixture with do- 
mestic breeds and through in-and-in breeding. 

The fate of the Yellowstone Park herd is, to say the least, highly un- 
certain. A distinguished Senator, who is deeply interested in legisla- 
tion for the protection of the National Park reservation, has declared 
that the pressure from railway corporations, which are seeking a foot-hold 
in the park, has become so great and so aggressive that he fears the 
park will " eventually be broken up." In any such event, the destruc- 
tion of the herd of park buffaloes would be one of the very first results. 
If the park is properly maintained, however, it is to be hoped that the 
buffaloes now in it will remain there and increase indefinitely. 

As yet there are only two captive buffaloes in the possession of the 
Government, viz, those in the Department of Living Animals of the Na- 
tional Museum, presented by Hon. E. G. Blackford, of New York. The 
buffaloes now in the Zoological Gardens of the country are but few in 
number, and unless special pains be taken to prevent it, by means of 
judicious exchanges, from time to time, these will rapidly deteriorate in 
size, and within a comparatively short time run out entirely, through 
continued in-and-in breediug. It is said that even the wild aurochs in 
the forests of Lithuania are decreasing in size and in number from this 
cause. 

* It was the. Cree Indians who used to practice impounding buffaloes, slaughtering 
a penful of two hundred head at a time with most fiendish glee, and leaving all but 
the very choicest of the meat to putrefy. 



528 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

With private owners of captive buffaloes, the temptations to produce 
cross-breeds will be so great that it is more than likely the breeding of 
pure-blood buffaloes will be neglected. Indeed, unless some stockman 
like Mr. 0. J. Jones takes particular pains to protect his full blood but' 
faloes, and keep the breed absolutely pure, in twenty years there will 
not be a pure-blood animal of that species on any stock farm in this 
country. Under existing conditions, the constant tendency of the nu- 
merous domestic forms is to absorb and utterly obliterate the few wild 
ones. 

If we may judge from the examples set us by European governments, 
it is clearly the duty of our Government to act in this matter, and act 
promptly, with a degree of liberality and promptness which can not be 
otherwise than highly gratifying to every American citizen and every 
friend of science throughout the world. The Fiftieth Congress, at its 
last session, responded to the call made upon it, and voted $200,000 for 
the establishment of a National Zoological Park in the District of Co- 
lumbia on a grand scale. One of the leading purposes it is destined to 
serve is the preservation and breeding in comfortable, and so far as 
space is concerned, luxurious captivity of a number of fine specimens of 
every species of American quadruped now threatened with extermina- 
tion.* 

At least eight or ten buffaloes of pure breed should be secured very 
soon by the Zoological Park Commission, by gift if possible, and cared 
for with special reference to keeping the breed absolutely pure, and 
keeping the herd from deteriorating and dying out through in-and-in breed- 
ing. 

The total expense would be trifling in comparison with the impor- 
tance of the end to be gained, and in that way we might, in a small 
measure, atone for our neglect of the means which would have pro- 
tected the great herds from extinction. In this way, by proper man- 
agement, it will be not only possible but easy to preserve fine living 
representatives of this important species for centuries to come. 

The result of continuing in-breeding is certain extinction. Its prog- 
ress may be so slow as to make no impression upon the mind of a herd- 
owner, but the end is only a question of time. The fate of a majority 
of the herds of British wild cattle (Bos urus) warn us what to expect 
with the American bison under similar circumstances. Of the fourteen 
herds of wild cattle which were in existence in England and Scotland 
during the early part of the present century, direct descendants of the

important task, in which every American citizen has a personal interest, is actually 
to be undertaken. Last year we could only say it ought to be undertaken. In its 
accomplishment, the Government expects the co-operation of private individuals all 
over the country in the form of gifts of desirable living animals, for no government 
could afford to purchase all the animals necessary for a great Zoological Garden, pro- 
vide for their wants in a liberal way, and yet give the public free access to the col- 
lection, as is to be given to the National Zoological Park,

wild herds found in Great Britain, nine have become totally extinct 
through in -breeding. 

The five herds remaining are those at Somerford Park, Blickling Hall, 
Woodbastwick, Ckartley, and Chillingham. 

PART III.— THE SMITHSONIAN EXPEDITION FOR MUSEUM SPECI- 
MENS. 

I. The Exploration. 

During the first three months of the year 1886 it was ascertained by 
the writer, then chief taxidermist of the National Museum, that the ex- 
termination of the American bison had made most alarming progress. 
By extensive correspondence it was learned that the destruction of all 
the large herds, both North and South, was already an accomplished 
fact. While it was generally supposed that at least a few" thousand indi- 
viduals still inhabited the more remote and inaccessible regions of what 
once constituted the great northern buffalo range, it was found that the 
actual number remaining in the whole United States was probably less 
than three hundred. 

By some authorities who were consulted it was considered an impos- 
sibility to procure a large series of specimens anywhere in this country, 
while others asserted positively that there were no wild buffaloes south 
of the British possessions save those in the Yellowstone National Park. 
Canadian authorities asserted with equal positiveness that none re- 
mained in their territory. 

A careful inventory of the specimens in the collection of the National 
Museum revealed the fact that, with the exception of one mounted fe- 
male skin, another unmounted, and one mounted skeleton of a male 
buffalo, the Museum was actually without presentable specimens of this 
most important and interesting mammal. 

Besides those mentioned above, the collection contained only two old, 
badly mounted, and dilapidated skins, (one of which had been taken in 
summer, and therefore was not representative), an incomplete skeleton, 
some fragmentary skulls of no value, and two mounted heads. Thus it 
appeared that the Museum was unable to show a series of specimens, 
good or bad, or even one presentable male of good size. 

In view of this alarming state of affairs, coupled with the already de- 
clared extinction of Bison americanus, the Secretary of the Smithsonian 
Institution, Prof. Spencer F. Baird, determined to send a party into the 
field at once to find wild buffalo, if any were still living, and in case 
any were found to collect a number of specimens. Since it seemed 
highly uncertain whether any other institution, or any private individual, 
would have the opportunity to collect a large supply of specimens be- 
fore it became too late, it was decided by the Secretary that the Smith- 
sonian Institution should undertake the task of providing for the future 
as liberally as possible. For the benefit of the smaller scientific mu-

530 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

seuins of the country, and for others which will come into existence 
during the next half century, it was resolved to collect at ay. hazards, 
in case buffalo could be found, between eighty and one hundred speci- 
mens of various kinds, of which from twenty to thirty should be skins, an 
equal number should be complete skeletons, and of skulls at least fifty. 

In view of the great scarcity of buffalo and the general belief that it 
might be a work of some months to find any specimens, even if it were 
possible to find any at all, it was determined not to risk the success of the 
undertaking by delaying it until the regular autumn hunting season, but 
to send a party into the field at once to prosecute a search. It wasresolved 
to discover at all hazards the whereabouts of any buffalo that might 
still remain in this country in a wild state, and, if possible, to reach them 
before the shedding of their winter pelage. It very soon became ap- 
parent, however, that the latter would prove an utter impossibility. 

Late in the month of April a letter was received from Dr. J. C. Merrill, 
United States Army, dated at Huntley, Montana, giving information of 
reports that buffalo were still to be found in three localities in the North- 
west, viz: on the headwaters of the Powder River, Wyoming; in Judith 
Basin, Montana; and on Big Dry Creek, also in Montana. The reports 
in regard to the first two localities proved to be erroneous. It was ascer- 
tained to a reasonable certainty that there still existed in southwestern 
Dakota a small band of six or eight wild buffaloes, while from the Pan- 
handle of Texas there came reports of the existence there, in small 
scattered bands, of about two hundred head. The buffalo known to be 
in Dakota were far too few in number to justify a long and expensive 
search, while those in Texas, on the Canadian Biver, were too difficult 
to reach to make it advisable to hunt them save as a last resort. It 
was therefore decided to investigate the localities named in the North- 
west. 

Through the courtesy of the Secretary of War, an order was sent to 
the officer commanding the Department of Dakota, requesting him to 
furnish the party, through the officers in command at Forts Keogh. Ma- 
ginnis, and McKinney, such field transportation, escort, and camp equi- 
page as might be necessary, and also to sell to the party such commis- 
sary stores as might be required, at cost price, plus 10 per cent. The 
Secretary of the Interior also favored the party with an order, directing 
all Indian agents, scouts, and others in the service of the Department 
to render assistance as far as possible when called upon. 
' In view of the public interest attaching to the results of the expedi- 
tion, the railway transportation of the party to and from Montana was 
furnished entirely without cost to the Smithsonian Institution. For 
these valuable courtesies we gratefully acknowledge our obligations to 
Mr. Frank Thomson, of the Pennsylvania Eailroad ; Mr. Koswell Miller, 
of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul ; and Mr. Kobert Harris, of the 
.Northern Pacific. 

Under orders from the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the 



THE EXTEEMINATION OF THE AMEBIC AN BISON. 531 

writer left Washington on May 6, accompanied by A. H. Forney, assist- 
ant in the department of taxidermy, and George H. Hedley, of Medina, 
New York. It had been decided that Miles City, Montana, might prop- 
erly be taken as the first objective point, and that town was reached on 
May 9. 

Diligent inquiry in Miles City and at Fort Keogh, 2 miles distant, re- 
vealed the fact that no one knew of the presence of any wild buffalo 
anywhere in the Northwest, save within the protected limits of the Yel- 
lowstone Park. All inquiries elicited the same reply : " There are no 
buffalo any more, and you can't get any anywhere." Many persons who 
were considered good authority declared most positively that there was 
not a live buffalo in the vicinity of Big Dry Creek, nor anywhere be- 
tween the Yellowstone and Missouri Eivers. An army officer from Fort 
Maginnis testified to the total absence of buffalo in the Judith Basin, 
and ranchmen from Wyoming asserted that none remained in the Pow- 
der River country. 

Just at this time it was again reported to us, and most opportunely 
confirmed by Mr. Henry B. Phillips, owner of the L U-bar ranch on Lit- 
tle Dry Creek, that there still remained a chance to find a few buffalo 
in the country lying south of the Big Dry. On the other hand, other 
persons who seemed to be fully informed regarding that very region and 
the animal life it contained, assured us that not a single buffalo remained 
there, and that a search in that direction would prove fruitless. But 
the balance of evidence, however, seemed to lie in favor of the Big Dry 
country, and we resolved to hunt through it with all possible dispatch. 

On the afternoon of May 13 we crossed the Yellowstone and started 
northwest up the trail which leads along Sunday Creek. Our entire 
party consisted of the two assistants already mentioned, a noncommis- 
sioned officer, Sergeant Garone, and four men from the Fifth Infantry 
acting as escort ; Private Jones, also from the Fifth Infantry, detailed 
to act as our cook, and a teamster. Our conveyance consisted of a six- 
mule team, which, like the escort, was ordered out for twenty days only, 
and provided accordingly. Before leaving Miles City we purchased two 
saddle-horses for use in hunting, the equipments for which were fur- 
nished by the ordnance department at Fort Keogh. 

During the first two days' travel through the bad lands north of the 
Yellowstone no mammals were seen save prairie-dogs and rabbits. On 
the third day a few antelope were seen, but none killed. It is to be 
borne in mind that this entire region is absolutely treeless everywhere 
save along the margins of the largest streams. Bushes are also en- 
tirely absent, with the exception of sage-brush, and even that does not 
occur to any extent on the divides. 

On the third day two young buck antelopes were shot at the Red 
Buttes. One had already commenced to shed his hair, but the other 
had not quite reached that point. We prepared the skin of the first 
specimen and the skeleton of the other. This was the only good ante- 



532 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

lope skin we obtained in the spring, those of all the other specimens 
taken being quite worthless on account of the looseness of the hair. 
During the latter part of May, and from that time on until the long 
winter hair is completely shed, it falls off in handfuls at the slightest 
pressure, leaving the skin clad only with a thin growth of new, mouse- 
colored hair an eighth of an inch long. 

After reaching Little Dry Creek and hunting through the country on 
the west side of it nearly to its confluence with the Big Dry we turned 
southwest, and finally went into permanent camp on Phillips Creek, 8 
miles above the LU-bar ranch and 4 miles from the Little Dry. At 
that point we were about 80 miles from Miles City. 

From information furnished us by Mr. Phillips and the cowboys in 
his employ, we were assured that about thirty-five head of buffalo ranged 
in the bad lands between Phillips Creek and the Musselshell River and 
south of the Big Dry. This tract of country was about 40 miles long 
from east to west by 25 miles wide, and therefore of about 1,000 square 
miles in area. Excepting two temporary cowboy camps it was totally 
uninhabited by man, treeless, without any running streams, save in 
winter and spring, and was mostly very hilly and broken. 

In this desolate and inhospitable country the thirty-five buffaloes 
alluded to had been seen, first on Sand Creek, then at the head of the 
Big Porcupine, again near the Musselshell, and latest near the head 
of the Little Dry. As these points were all from 15 to 30 miles distant 
from each other, the difficulty of finding such a small herd becomes 
apparent. 

Although Phillips Creek was really the eastern boundary of the buf- 
falo country, it was impossible for a six- mule wagon to proceed beyond 
it, at least at that point. Having established a permanent camp, the 
Government wagon and its escort returned to Fort Keogh, and we pro- 
ceeded to hunt through the country between Sand Creek and the Little 
Dry. The absence of nearly all the cowboys on the spring round-up, 
which began May 20, threatened to be a serious drawback to us, as we 
greatly needed the services of a man who was acquainted with the 
country. We had with us as a scout and guide a Cheyenne Indian, 
named Dog, but it soon became apparent that he knew no more about 
the country than we did. Fortunately, however, we succeeded in occa- 
sionally securing the services of a cowboy, which was of great advan- 
tage to us. 

It was our custom to ride over the country daily, each day making a 
circuit through a new locality, and covering as much ground as it was 
possible to ride over in a day. It was also our custom to take trips of 
from two to four days in length, during which we carried our blankets 
and rations upon our horses and camped wherever night overtook us, 
provided water could be found. 

Our first success consisted in the capture of a buffalo calf, which 
from excessive running had become unable to keep up with its mother, 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 533 

and had been left behind. The calf was caught alive without any 
difficulty, and while two of the members of our party carried it to camp 
across a horse, the other two made a vigorous effort to discover the 
band of adult animals. The effort was unsuccessful, for, besides the 
calf, no other buffaloes were seen. 

Ten days after the above event two bull buffaloes were met with on 
the Little Dry, 15 miles above the LU-bar ranch, one of which was 
overtaken and killed, but the other got safely away. The shedding of 
the winter coat was in full progress. On the head, neck, and shoulders 
the old hair had been entirely replaced by the new, although the two 
coats were so matted together that the old hair clung in tangled masses 
to the other. The old hair was brown and weather-beaten, but the new, 
which was from 3 to 6 inches long, had a peculiar bluish-gray appear- 
ance. On the head the new hair was quite black, and contrasted oddly 
with the lighter color. On the body and hind quarters there were large 
patches of skin which were perfectly bare, between which lay large 
patches of old, woolly, brown hair. This curious condition gave the 
animal a very unkempt and "seedy" appearance, the effect of which 
was heightened by the long, shaggy locks of old, weather-beaten hair 
which ciung to the new coat of the neck and shoulders like tattered 
signals of distress, ready to be blown away by the first gust of wind. 

This specimen was a large one, measuring 5 feet 4 inches in height. 
Inasmuch as the skin was not in condition to mount, we took only the 
skeleton, entire, and the skin of the head and neck. 

The capture of the calf and the death of this bull proved conclusively 
that there were buffaloes in that region, and also that they were breed- 
ing in comparative security. The extent of the country they had to 
range over made it reasonably certain that their number would not be 
diminished to any serious extent by the cowboys on the spring round-up, 
although it was absolutely certain that in a few months the members of 
that band would all be killed. The report of the existence of a herd 
of thirty -five head was confirmed later by cowboys, who had actually 
seen the animals, and killed two of them merely for sport, as usual. 
They saved a few pounds of hump meat, and all the rest became food 
for the wolves and foxes. 

It was therefore resolved to leave the buffaloes entirely unmolested 
until autumn, and then, when the robes would be in the finest condition, 
return for a hunt on a liberal scale. Accordingly, it was decided to re- 
turn to Washington without delay, and a courier was dispatched with 
a request for transportation to carry our party back to Fort Keogh. 

While awaiting the arrival of the wagons, a cowboy in the employ of 
the Phillips Land and Cattle Company killed a solitary bull buffalo 
about 15 miles west of our camp, near Sand Creek. This animal had 
completely shed the hair on his body and hind quarters. In addition to 
the preservation of his entire skeleton, we prepared the skin also, as an 
example of the condition of the buffalo immediately after shedding. 



534 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

On June 6 the teams from Fort Keogh arrived, and we immediately- 
returned to Miles City, taking with us our live buffalo calf, two fresh 
buffalo skeletons, three bleached skeletons, seven skulls, one skin entire, 
and one head skin, in addition to a miscellaneous collection of skins 
and skeletons of smaller mammals and birds. On reaching Miles City 
we hastily packed and shipped our collection, and, taking the calf with 
us, returned at once to Washington. 

II. The Hunt. 

On September 24 I arrived at Miles City a second time, fully equipped 
for a protracted hunt for buffalo; this time accompanied only by W. 
Harvey Brown, a student of the University of Kansas, as field assistant, 
having previously engaged three cowboys as guides and hunters — Irwin 
Boyd, James McNaney, and L. S. Eussell. Messrs. Boyd and Bussell 
were in Miles City awaiting my arrival, and Mr. McNaney joined us in 
the field a few days later. Mr. Boyd acted as my foreman during the 
entire hunt, a position which he filled to my entire satisfaction. 

Thanks to the energy and good- will of the officers at Fort Keogh, of 
which Lieutenant-Colonel Cochran was then in command, our transpor- 
tation, camp equipage, and stores were furnished without an hour's 
delay. We purchased two months' supplies of commissary stores, a 
team, and two saddle-horses, and hired three more horses, a light wagon, 
and a set of double harness. Each of the cowboys furnished one horse; 
so that in our outfit we had ten head, a team, and two good saddle- 
horses for each hunter. The worst feature of the whole question of 
subsistence was the absolute necessity of hauling a supply of grain 
from Miles City into the heart of the buffalo country for our ten horses. 
For such work as they had to encounter it was necessary to feed them 
constantly and liberally with oats in order to keep them in condition to 
do their work. We took with us 2,000 pounds of oats, and by the be- 
ginning of November as much more had to be hauled up to us. 

Thirty six hours after our arrival in Miles City our outfit was com- 
plete, and we crossed the Yellowstone and started up the Sunday Creek 
trail. We had from Fort Keogh a six-mule team, an escort of four men, 
in charge of Sergeant Bayliss, and an old veteran of more than twenty 
years' service, from the Fifth Infantry, Private Patrick McCanna, who 
was detailed to act as cook and camp-guard for our party during our 
stay in the field. 

On September 29 we reached Tow's ranch, the HV, on Big Dry Creek 
(erroneously called Big Timber Creek on most maps of Montana), at the 
mouth of Sand Creek, which here flows into it from the southwest. This 
point is said to be 90 miles from Miles City. Here we received our freight 
from the six-mule wagon, loaded it with bleached skeletons and skulls 
of buffalo, and started it back to the post. One member of the escort, 
Private C. S. West, who was then on two months' furlough, elected 
to join our party for the hunt, and accordingly remained with us to its

close. Leaving half of our freight stored at the H V ranch, we loaded the 
remainder upon our own wagon, and started up Sand Creek. 

At this point the hunt began. As the wagon and extra horses pro- 
ceeded up the Sand Creek trail in the care of W. Harvey Brown, the 
three cowboys and I paired off, and while two hunted through the coun- 
try along the south side of the creek, the others took the north. The 
whole of the country bordering Sand Creek, quite up to its source, consists 
of rugged hills and ridges, which sometimes rise to considerable height, 
cut between by great yawning ravines and hollows, such as persecuted 
game loves to seek shelter in. Inasmuch as the buffalo we were in search 
of had been seen hiding in those ravines, it became necessary to search 
through them with systematic thoroughness 5 a proceeding which was 
very wearing upon our horses. Along the south side of Sand Creek, 
near its source, the divide between it and Little Dry Creek culminates 
in a chain of high, flat-topped buttes, whose summits bear a scanty 
growth of stunted pines, which serve to make them conspicuous land- 
marks. On some maps these insignificant little buttes are shown as 
mountains, under the name of "Piny Buttes." 

It was our intention to go to the head of Sand Creek, and beyond, in 
case buffaloes were not found earlier. Immediately westward of its 
source there is a lofty level plateau, about 3 miles square, which, by com- 
mon consent, we called the High Divide. It is the highest ground any- 
where between the Big Dry and the Yellowstone, and is the starting 
point of streams that run northward into the Missouri and Big Dry, 
eastward into Sand Creek and the Little Dry, southward into Porcu- 
pine Creek and the Yellowstone, and westward into the Musselshell. 
On three sides — north, east, and south — it is surrounded by wild and 
rugged butte country, and its sides are scored by intricate systems of 
great yawning ravines and hollows, steep-sided and very deep, and 
bad lands of the worst description. 

By the 12th of October the hunt had progressed up Sand Creek to its 
source, and westward across the High Divide to Calf Creek, where we 
found a hole of wretchedly bad water and went into permanent camp. 
"We considered that the spot we selected would serve us as a key to the 
promising country that lay on three sides of it, and our surmise that 
the buffalo were in the habit of hiding in the heads of those great ravines 
around the High Divide soon proved to be correct. Our camp at the 
head of Calf Creek was about 20 miles east of the Musselshell River, 40 
miles south of the Missouri, and about 135 miles from Miles City, as the 
trail ran. Four miles north of us, also on Calf Creek, was the line camp 
of the STV ranch, owned by Messrs. J. H. Conrad & Co., and 18 miles 
east, near the head of Sand Creek, was the line camp of the N-bar ranch, 
owned by Mr. Newman. At each of these camps there were generally 
from two to four cowboys. From all these gentlemen we received the 
utmost courtesy and hospitality on all occasions, and all the informa- 
tion in regard to buffalo which it was in their power to give. On many 



536 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

occasions they rendered us valuable assistance, which is hereby grate- 
fully acknowledged. 

We saw no buffalo, nor any signs of any, until October 13. On that 
day, while L. S. Eussell was escorting our second load of freight across 
the High Divide, he discovered a band of seven buffaloes lying in the 
head of a deep ravine. He fired upon them, but killed none, and when 
they dashed away he gave chase and followed them 2 or 3 miles. Being 
mounted on a tired horse, which was unequal to the demands of the 
chase, he was finally distanced by the herd, which took a straight course 
and ran due south. As it was then nearly night, nothing farther could 
be done that day except to prepare for a vigorous chase on the morrow. 
Everything was got in perfect readiness for an early start, and by day- 
break the following morning the three cowboys and the writer were 
mounted on our best horses, and on our way through the bad lands to 
take up the trail of the seven buffaloes. 

Shortly after sunrise we found the trail, not far from the head of Calf 
Creek, and followed it due south. We left the rugged butte region 
behind us, and entered a tract of country quite unlike anything we had 
found before. It was composed of a succession of rolling hills and deep 
hollows, smooth enough on the surface, to all appearances, but like a 
desert of sand-hills to traverse. The dry soil was loose and crumbly, like 
loose ashes or scoriae, and the hoofs of our horses sank into it half-way 
to the fetlocks at every step. But there was another feature which was 
still worse. The whole surface of the ground was cracked and seamed 
with a perfect net- work of great cracks, into which our horses stepped 
every yard or so, and sank down still farther, with many a tiresome 
wrench of the joints. It was terrible ground to go over. To make it 
as bad as possible, a thick growth of sage-brush or else grease-wood 
was everywhere present for the horses to struggle through, and when 
it came to dragging a. loaded wagon across that 12-mile stretch of "bad 
grounds" or "gumbo ground," as it was called, it was killing work. 

But in spite of the character of this ground, in one way it was a bene- 
fit to us. Owing to its looseness on the surface we were able to track 
the buffaloes through it with the greatest ease, whereas on any other 
ground in that country it would have been almost impossible. We fol- 
lowed the trail due south for about 20 miles, which brought us to the 
head of a small stream called Taylor Creek. Here the bad grounds 
ended, and in the grassy country which lay beyond, tracking was almost 
impossible. Just at noon we rode to a high point, and on scanning the 
hills and hollows with the binocular discovered the buffaloes lying at 
rest on the level top of a small butte 2 miles away. The original bunch 
of seven had been joined by an equal number. 

We crept up to within 200 yards of the buffaloes, which was as close 
as we could go, fired a volley at them just as they lay, and did not even 
kill a calf! Instantly they sprang up and dashed away at astonishing 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 537 

speed, heading straight for the sheltering ravines around the High 
Divide. 

We had a most exciting and likewise dangerous chase after the herd 
through a vast prairie-dog town, honey-combed with holes just right for 
a running horse to thrust a leg in up to the knee and snap it off like a 
pipe-stem, and across fearfully wide gullies that either had to be leaped 
or fallen into. McNaney killed a fine old bull and a beautiful two-year 
old, or "spike" bull, out of this herd, while I managed to kill a cow and 
another large old bull, making four for that day, all told. This herd of 
fourteen head was the largest that we saw during the entire hunt. 

Two days later, when we were on the spot with the wagon to skin our 
game and haul in the hides, four more buffaloes were discovered within 
2 miles of us, and while I worked on one of the large ball skins to save 
it from spoiling, the cowboys went after the buffalo, and by a really bril- 
liant exploit killed them all. The first one to fall was an old cow, which 
was killed at the beginning of the chase, the next was an old bull, who 
was brought down about 5 miles from the scene of the first attack, then 
2 miles farther on a yearling calf was killed. The fourth buffalo, an 
immense old bull, was chased fully 12 miles before he was finally brought 
down. 

The largest bull fell about 8 miles from our temporary camp, in the 
opposite direction from that in which our permanent camp lay, and at 
about 3 o'clock in the afternoon. There not being time enough in which 
to skin him completely and reach our rendezvous'before dark, Messrs. 
McJNaney and Boyd dressed the carcass to preserve the meat, partly 
skinned the legs, and came to camp. 

As early as possible the next morning we drove to the carcass with the 
wagon, to prepare both skin and skeleton and haul them in. When we 
reached it we found that during the night a gang of Indians had robbed 
us of our hard-earned spoil. They had stolen the skin and all the 
eatable meat, broken up the leg-bones to get at the marrow, and even 
cut out the tongue. And to injury the skulking thieves had added in- 
sult. Through laziness they had left the head unskinned, but on one 
side of it they had smeared the hair with red war-paint, the other side 
they had daubed with yellow, and around the base of one horn they had 
tied a strip of red flannel as a signal of defiance. Of course they had 
left for parts unknown, and we never saw any signs of them afterward. 
The gang visited the LU-bar ranch a few days later, so we learned sub- 
sequently. It was then composed of eleven braves (!), who claimed to 
be Assinniboines, and were therefore believed to be Piegans, the most 
notorious horse and cattle thieves in the Northwest. 

On October 22d Mr. Russell ran down in a fair chase a fine bull buf- 
falo, and killed him in the rough country bordering the High Divide on 
the south. This was the ninth specimen. On the 26th we made an- 
other trip with the wagon to the Buffalo Buttes, as, for the sake of con- 
venience, we had named the group of buttes near which eight head had

already been taken. While Mr. Brown and I were getting the wagon 
across the bad grounds, Messrs. McNaney and Boyd discovered a soli- 
tary bull buffalo feeding in a ravine within a quarter of a mile of our in- 
tended camping place, and the former stalked him and killed him at 
long range. The buffalo had all been attracted to that locality by some 
springs which lay between two groups of hills, and which was the only 
water within a radius of about 15 miles. In addition to water, the grass 
around the Buffalo Buttes was most excellent. 

During all this time we shot antelope and coyotes whenever an op- 
portunity offered, and preserved the skins and skeletons of the finest 
until we had obtained a very fine series of both. At this season the 
pelts of these animals were in the finest possible condition, the hair 
having attained its maximum length and density, and, being quite new, 
had lost none of its brightness of color, either by wear or the action of 
the weather. Along Sand Creek and all around the High Divide an- 
telope were moderately plentiful (but really scarce in comparison with 
their former abundance), so much so that had we been inclined to 
slaughter we could have killed a hundred head or more, instead of 
the twenty that we shot as specimens and for their flesh. We have it to 
say that from first to last not an antelope was killed which was not 
made use of to the fullest extent. 

On the 31st of October, Mr. Boyd and I discovered a buffalo cow and 
yearling calf in the ravines north of the High Divide, within 3 miles of 
our camp, and killed them both. The next day Private West arrived 
with a six mule team from Fort Keogh, in charge of Corporal Clafer 
and three men. This wagon brought us another 2,000 pounds of oats 
and various commissary stores. When it started back, on November 3, 
we sent by it all the skins and skeletons of buffalo, antelope, etc., which 
we had collected up to that date, which made a heavy load for the six 
mules. On this same day Mr. McTSTaney killed two young cow buffa- 
loes in the bad lands south of the High Divide, which brought our total 
number up to fourteen. 

On the night of the 3d the weather turned very cold, and on the day 
following we experienced our first snow-storm. By that time the water 
in the hole, which up to that time had supplied our camp, became so 
thick with mud and filth that it was unendurable ; and having discov- 
ered a fine pool of pure water in the bottom of a little canon on the 
southern slope of the High Divide we moved to it forthwith. It was 
really the upper spring of the main fork of the Big Porcupine, and a 
finer situation for a camp does not exist in that whole region. The 
spot which nature made for us was sheltered on all sides by the high 
walls of the canon, within easy reach of an inexhaustible supply of 
good water, and also within reach of a fair supply of dry fire- wood, 
which we found half a mile below. This became our last permanent 
camp, and its advantages made up for the barrenness and discomfort 
of our camp on Calf Creek. Immediately south of us, and 2 miles dis- 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 539 

tant there rose a lofty conical butte about 600 feet high, which forms 
a very conspicuous landmark from the south. We were told that it was 
visible from 40 miles down the Porcupine. Strange to say, this valua- 
ble landmark was without a name, so far as we could learn; so, for our 
own convenience, we christened it Smithsonian Butte. 

The two buffalo cows that Mr. McNaney killed just before we moved 
our camp seemed to be the last in the country, for during the following 
week we scouted for 15 miles in three directions, north, east, and south, 
without finding as much as a hoof-print. At last we decided to go 
away and give that country absolute quiet for a week, in the hope that 
some more buffalo would come into it. Leaving McCanna and West 
to take care of the camp, we loaded a small assortment of general 
equipage into the wagon and pulled about 25 miles due west to the Mus- 
selshell Eiver. 

We found a fine stream of clear water, flowing over sand and pebbles, 
with heavy cottonwood timber and thick copses of willow aloug its 
banks, which afforded cover for white-tailed cleer. In the rugged 
brakes, which led from the level river bottom into a labyrinth of ravines 
and gullies, ridges and hog-backs, up to the level of the high plateau 
above, we found a scanty growth of stunted cedars and pines, which 
once sheltered great numbers of mule deer, elk, and bear. Now, how- 
ever, few remain, and these are very hard to find. Even when found, 
the deer are nearly always young. Although we killed five mule deer 
and five white-tails, we did not kill even one fine buck, and the 
only one we saw on the whole trip was a long distance off. We saw 
fresh tracks of elk, and also grizzly bear, but our most vigorous efforts 
to discover the animals themselves always ended in diappointment. 
The many bleaching skulls and antlers of elk and deer, which we found 
everywhere we went, afforded proof of what that country had been as 
a home for wild animals only a few years ago. We were not a little 
surprised at finding the fleshless carcasses of three head of cattle that 
had been killed and eaten by bears within a few months. 

In addition to ten deer, we shot three wild geese, seven sharp-tailed 
grouse, eleven sage grouse, nine Bohemian waxwings, and a magpie, 
for their skeletons. We made one trip of several miles up the Mussel- 
shell, and another due west, almost to the Bull Mountains, but no signs 
of buffalo were found. The weather at this time was quite cold, the 
thermometer registering 6 degrees below zero; but, in spite of the fact 
that we were without shelter and had to bivouac in the open, we were, 
generally speaking, quite comfortable. 

Having found no buffalo by the 17th, we felt convinced that we ought 
to return to our permanent camp, and did so on that day. Having 
brought back nearly half a wagon-load of specimens in the flesh or half 
skinned, it was absolutely necessary that I should remain at camp all 
the next day. While I did so, Messrs. McNaney and Boyd rode over 



540 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

to the Buffalo Buttes, found four fine old buffalo cows, and, after a hard 
chase, killed them all. 

Under the circumstances, this was the most brilliant piece of work of 
the entire hunt. As the four cows dashed past the hunters at the Buf- 
falo Buttes, heading for the High Divide, fully 20 miles distant, Mc- 
Naney killed one cow, and two others went off wounded. Of course 
the cowboys gave chase. About 12 miles from the starting-point one 
of the wounded cows left her companions, was headed off by Boyd, and 
killed. About 6 miles beyond that one, McNaney overhauled the third 
cow and killed her, but the fourth one got away for a short time. While 
McNaney skinned the third cow and dressed the carcass to preserve 
the meat, Boyd took their now thoroughly exhausted horses to camp 
and procured fresh mounts. On returning to McNaney they set out in 
pursuit of the fourth cow, chased her across the High Divide, within a 
mile or so of our camp, and into the ravines on the northern slope, 
where she was killed. She met her death nearly if not quite 25 miles 
from the spot where the first one fell. 

The death of these four cows brought our number of buffaloes up to 
eighteen, and' made us think about the possibilities of getting thirty. 
As we were proceeding to the Buffalo Buttes on the clay after the "kill" 
to gather in the spoil, Mr. Brown and I taking charge of the wagon, 
Messrs. McNaney and Boyd went ahead in order to hunt. When within 
about 5 miles of the Buttes we came unexpectedly upon our companions, 
down in a hollow, busily engaged in skinning another old cow, which 
they had discovered traveling across the bad grounds, waylaid, and 
killed. 

We camped that night on our old ground at the Buffalo Buttes, and 
although we all desired to remain a day or two and hunt for more buf- 
falo, the peculiar appearance of the sky in the northwest, and the con- 
dition of the atmosphere, warned us that a change of weather was im- 
minent. Accordingly, the following morning we decided without hesi- 
tation that it was best to get back to cainp that day, and it soon proved 
very fortunate for us that we so decided. 

Feeling that by reason of my work on the specimens I had been de- 
prived of a fair share of the chase, I arranged for Mr. Boyd to accom- 
pany the wagon on the return trip, that I might hunt through the bad 
lands west of the Buffalo Buttes, which I felt must contain some buffalo. 
Mr. Russell went northeast and Mr. McNaney accompanied me. About 
4 miles from our late camp we came suddenly upon a fine old solitary 
bull, feeding in a hollow between two high and precipitous ridges. 
After a short but sharp chase I succeeded in getting a fair shot at him, 
and killed him with a ball which broke his left humerus and passed 
into his lungs. He was the only large bull killed on the entire trip by 
a single shot. He proved to be a very fine specimen, measuring 5 feet 
G inches in height at the shoulders. The wagon was overtaken and 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 541 

called back to get the skin, and while it was coming I took a complete 
series of measurements and sketches of him as he lay. 

Although we removed the skin very quickly, and lost no time in again 
starting the wagon to our permanent camp, the delay occasioned by the 
death of our twentieth buffalo, — which occurred on November 20, pre- 
cisely two months from the date of our leaving Washington to collect 
twenty buffalo, if possible, — caused us all to be caught in a snow-storm, 
which burst upon us from the northwest. The wagon had to be aban- 
doned about 12 miles from camp in the bad lands. Mr. Brown packed 
the bedding on one of the horses and rode the other, he and Boyd 
reaching camp about 9 o'clock that night in a blinding snow-storm. Of 
course the skins in the wagon were treated with preservatives and cov- 
ered up. It proved to be over a week that the wagon and its load had 
to remain thus abandoned before it was possible to get to it and bring 
it to camp, and even then the task was one of great difficulty. In this 
connection I can not refrain from recording the fact that the services 
rendered by Mr. W. Harvey Brown on all such trying occasions as the 
above were invaluable. He displayed the utmost zeal and intelligence, 
not only in the more agreeable kinds of work and sport incident to the 
hunt, but also in the disagreeable drudgery, such as team-driving and 
working on half- frozen specimens in bitter cold weather. 

The storm which set in on the 20th soon developed into a regular bliz- 
zard. A fierce and bitter cold wind swept down from the northwest, 
driving the snow before it in blinding gusts. Had our camp been poorly 
sheltered we would have suffered, but at it was we were fairly comfort- 
able. 

Having thus completed our task (of getting twenty buffaloes), we 
were anxious to get out of that fearful country before we should get 
caught in serious difficulties with the weather, and it was arranged that 
Private 0. S. West should ride to Fort Keogh as soon as possible, with 
a request for transportation. By the third day, November 23, the storm 
had abated sufficiently that Private West declared his willingness to 
start. It was a little risky, but as he was to make only 10 miles the 
first day and stop at the N-bar camp on Sand Creek, it was thought safe 
to let him go. He dressed himself warmly, took my revolver, in order 
not to be hampered with a rifle, and set out. 

The next day was clear and fine, and we remarked it as an assurance 
of Mr. West's -safety during his ride from Sand Creek to the LU-bar 
ranch, his second stopping-place. The distance was about 25 miles, 
through bad lands all the way, and it was the only portion of the route 
which caused me anxiety for our courier's safety. The snow on the 
levels was less than 6 inches deep, the most of it having been blown 
into drifts and hollows; but although the coulees were all filled level to 
the top, our courier was a man of experience and would know how to 
avoid them. 

The 25th day of November was the most severe day of the storm, the 



542 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887 



mercury in our sheltered canon sinking to —16 degrees. We had hoped 
to kill at least five more buffaloes by the time Private West should ar- 
rive with the wagons; but when at the end of a week the storm had 
spent itself, the snow was so deep that hunting was totally impossible 
save in the vicinity of camp, where there was nothing to kill. We 
expected the wagons by the 3d of December, but they did not come 
that day nor within the next three. By the 6th the snow had melted 
off sufficiently that a buffalo hunt was once more possible, and Mr. 
McNaney and I decided to make a final trip to the Buffalo Buttes. 
The state of the ground made it impossible for us to go there and return 
the same day, so we took a pack-horse and arranged to camp out. 

When a little over half-way to our old rendezvous we came upon 
three buffaloes in the bad grounds, one of which was an enormous old 
bull, the next largest was an adult cow, and the third a two-year-old 
heifer. Mr. MeNaney promptly knocked down the old cow, while I 
devoted my attention to the bull; but she presently got up and made 
off unnoticed at the precise moment Mr. McNaney was absorbed in 
watching my efforts to bring down the old bull. After a short chase 
my horse carried me alongside my buffalo, and as he turned toward me 
I gave him a shot through the shoulder, breaking the fore leg and bring- 
ing him promptly to the ground. I then turned immediately to pursue 
the young cow, but by that time she had got on the farther side of a 
deep gully which was filled with snow, and by the time I got my horse 
safely across she had distanced me. I then rode back to the old bull. 
When he saw me coming he got upon his feet and ran a short distance, 
but was easily overtaken. He then stood at bay, and halting within 
30 yards of him I enjoyed the rare opportunity of studying a live bull 
buffalo of the largest size on foot on his native heath. I even made an 
outline sketch of him in my note-book. Having studied his form and 
outlines as much as was really necessary, I gave him a final shot through 
the lungs, which soon ended his career. 

This was a truly magnificent specimen in every respect. He was a 
"stub-horn" bull, about eleven years old, much larger every way than 
any of the others we collected. His height at the shoulder was 5 feet 
8 inches perpendicular, or 2 inches more than the next largest of our 
collection. His hair was in remarkably fine condition, being long, fine, 
thick, and well colored. The hair in his frontlet is 16 inches in length, 
and the thick coat of shaggy, straw-colored tufts which covered his 
neck and shoulders measured 4 inches. His girth behind the fore leg 
was 8 feet 4 inches, and his weight was estimated at 1,600 pounds. 

I was delighted with our remarkably good fortune in securing such a 
prize, for, owing to the rapidity with which the large buffaloes are being 
found and killed off these days, I had not hoped to capture a really old 
individual. Nearly every adult bull we took carried old bullets in his 
body, and from this one we took four of various sizes that had been fired

into biin on various occasions. One was found sticking fast in one of 
the lumbar vertebrae.* 

After a chase of several miles Mr. McNaney finally overhauled his 
cow and killed her, which brought the number of buffaloes taken on the 
fall hunt up to twenty-two. We spent the night at the Buffalo Buttes 
and returned to camp the next clay. Neither on that day nor the one 
following did the wagons arrive, and on the evening of the 8th we learned 
from the cowboys of the N-bar camp on Sand Creek that our courier, 
Private West, had not been seen or heard from since he left their samp 
on November 24, and evidently had got lost and frozen to death in the 
bad lands. 

The next day we started out to search for Private West, or news of 
him, and spent the night with Messrs. Brodhurstand Andrews, at their 
camp on Sand Creek. On the 10th, Mr. Mclsauey and I hunted through 
the bad lands over the course our courier should have taken, while 
Messrs. Busseli and Brodhurst looked through the country around the 
head of the Little Dry. When McNaney and I reached the LU-bar 
ranch that night we were greatly rejoiced at finding that West was 
alive, although badly frost-bitten, and in Fort Keogh. 

It appears that instead of riding due east to the LU bar ranch, he lost 
his way in the bad lands, where the buttes all look alike when covered 
with snow, and rode southwest. It is at all times an easy matter for 
even a cowboy to get lost in Montana if the country is new to him, and 
when there is snow on the ground the difficulty of finding one's way is 
increased tenfold. There is not only the danger of losing one's way, 
but the still greater danger of getting ingulfed in a deep coulee full of 
loose snow, which may easily cause both horse and rider to perish mis- 
erably. Even the most experienced riders sometimes ride into coulees 
which are level full of snow and hidden from sight. 

Private West's experience was a terrible one, and also a wonderful 
case of self-preservation. It shows what a man with a cool head and 
plenty of grit can go through and live. When he left us he wore two 
undershirts, a heavy blanket shirt, a soldier's blouse and overcoat, two 
pairs of drawers, a pair of soldier's woolen trousers, and a pair of over- 
alls. On his feet he wore three pairs of socks, a pair of low shoes with 
canvas leggins, and he started with his feet tied up in burlaps. His 
head and hands were also well protected. He carried a 38-caliber re- 
volver, but, by a great oversight, only six matches. When he left the 
N-bar camp, instead of going due east toward the LU-bar ranch, he 
swung around and went southwest, clear around the head of the Little 
Dry, and finally struck the Porcupine south of our camp. The first 
night out he made a fire with sage-brush, and kept it going all night. 
The second night he also had a fire, but it took his last match to make 
it. During the first three days he had no food, but on the fourth he

recently been placed on exhibition in the Museum. 



544 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

shot a sage-cock with his revolver, and ate it raw. This effort, how. 
ever, cost him his last cartridge. Through hard work and lack of food 
his pony presently gave out, and necessitated long and frequent stops 
for rest. West's feet threatened to freeze, and he cut off the skirts of 
his overcoat to wrap them with, in place of the gunny sacking, that had 
been worn to rags. Being afraid to go to sleep at night, he slept by 
snatches in the warmest part of tbe day, while resting his horse. 

On the 5th day he began to despair of succor, although he still toiled 
southward through the bad lands toward tlie Yellowstone, where people 
lived. On the envelopes which contained my letters he kept a diary 
of his wanderings, which could tell his story when the cowboys would 
find his body on the spring round-up. 

On the afternoon of the sixth day he found a trail and followed it until 
nearly night, when he came to Oree's sheep ranch, and found the solitary 
ranchman at home. The warm-hearted frontiersman gave the starving 
wanderers, man and horse, such a welcome as they stood in need of. 
West solemnly declares that in twenty-four hours he ate a whole sheep. 
After two or three days of rest and feeding both horse and rider were 
able to go on, and in course of time reached Fort Keogh. 

Without the loss of a single day Colonel Gibson started three teams 
and an escort up to us, and notwithstanding his terrible experience, 
West had the pluck to accompany them as guide. His arrival among 
us once more was like the dead coming to life again. The train reached 
our camp on the 13th T and on the 15th we pulled out for Miles City, 
loaded to the wagon-bows with specimens, forage, and camp plunder. 

From our camp down to the HV ranch, at the mouth of Sand Creek, 
the trail was in a terrible condition. But, thanks to the skill and judg- 
ment of the train-master, Mr. Ed. Haskins, and his two drivers, who 
also knew their business well, we got safely and in good time over the 
dangerous part of our road. Whenever our own tired and overloaded 
team got stuck in the mud, or gave out, there was always a pair of 
mules ready to hitch on and help us out. As a train- in aster, Mr. Has- 
kins was a perfect model, skillful, pushing, good-tempered, and very 
obliging. 

From the HV ranch to Miles City the trail was in fine condition, and 
we went in as rapidly as possible, fearing to be caught in the snow- 
storm which threatened us all the way in. We reached Miles City on 
December 20, with our collection complete and in fine condition, and 
the next day a snow-storm set in which lasted until the 25th, and re- 
sulted in over a foot of snow. The ice running in the Yellowstone 
stopped all the ferry-boats, and it was with good reason that we con- 
gratulated ourselves on the successful termination of our hunt at that 
particular time. Without loss of time Mr. Brown and I packed our 
collection, which tilled twenty-one large cases, turned in our equipage 
at Fort Keogh, sold our horses, and started on our homeward journey. 
In due course of time the collection reached the Museum in good con- 



THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON. 545 

dition, and a series of the best specimens it contains has already been 
mounted. 

At this point it is proper to acknowledge our great indebtedness to 
the Secretary of War for the timely co-operation of the War Depart- 
ment, which rendered the expedition possible. Our thanks are due to 
the officers who were successively in command at Fort Keogh during 
our work, Gol. John D. Wilkins, Col. George M. Gibson, and Lieut. Col. 
M. A. Cochran, and their various staff officers ; particularly Lieut. C. 
B. Thompson, quartermaster, and Lieut. H. K. Bailey, adjutant. It is 
due these officers to state that everything we asked for was cheerfully 
granted with a degree of promptness which contributed very greatly 
to the success of the hunt, and lightened its labors very materially. 

I have already acknowledged our indebtedness to the officers of the 
Pennsylvania -, the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul ; and Northern 
Pacific railways for the courtesies so liberally extended in our emer- 
gency. I take pleasure in adding that all the officers and employes of the 
Northern Pacific Bailway with whom we had any relations, particularly 
Mr. C. S. Pee, general passenger and ticket agent, treated our party 
with the utmost kindness and liberality throughout the trip. We are 
in like manner indebted to the officers of the Chicago, Milwaukee and 
St. Paul Eailway for valuable privileges granted with the utmost cor- 
diality. 

Our thanks are also due to Dr. J. C. Merrill, and to Mr. Henry R. 
Phillips, of the Phillips Land and Cattle Compan3 T , on Little Dry Creek, 
for valuable information at a critical moment, and to the latter for hos- 
pitality and assistance in various ways, ; t times wh?,n both were keenly 
appreciated. 

Counting the specimens taken in the spring, our total catch of buffalo 
amounted to twenty-five head, and constituted as complete and fine a 
series as could be wished for. I am inclined to believe that in size and 
general quality of pelage the adult bull and cow selected and mounted 
for our Museum group are not to be surpassed, even if they are ever 
equaled, by others of their kind. 

The different ages and sexes were thus represented in oar collection: 
10 old bulls, 1 young bull, 7 old cows, 4 young cows, 2 yearling calves, 
1 three-months calf* ; total, 25 specimens. 

Our total collection of specimens of Bison americanus, including 
everything taken, contained the following : 24 fresh skins, 1 head skin, 
8 fresh skeletons, 8 dry skeletons, 51 dry skulls, 2 foetal young; total, 
94 specimens. 

Our collection as a whole also included a fine series of skins and 
skeletons of antelope, deer of two species, coyotes, jack rabbits, sage 
grouse (of which we prepared twenty-four rough skeletons for the De- 
partment of Comparative Anatomy), sharp tailed grouse, and specimens 
of all the other species of birds and small mammals to be found in

that region at that season. From this materiel we now have on exhi- 
bition besides the group of buffaloes, a family group of antelope, an- 
other of coyotes, and another of prairie dogs, all with natural sur- 
roundings. 

III. The Mounted Group in the National Museum. 

The result of the Smithsonian expedition for bison which appeals 
most strongly to the general public is the huge group of six choice 
specimens of both sexes and all ages, mounted with natural surround- 
ings, and displayed in a superb mahogany case. The dimensions of 
the group are as follows: Length, 16 feet; width, 12 feet, and height, 
10 feet. The subjoined illustration is a very fair representation of the 
principal one of its four sides, and the following admirable description 
(by Mr. Harry P. Godwin), from the Washington Star of March 10, 
1888, is both graphic and accurate : 

A SCENE FROM MONTANA — SIX OP MR. HORNADAY'S BUFFALOES FORM A PICTURESQUE 
GROUP — A BIT OF THE WILD WEST REPRODUCED AT THE NATIONAL MUSEUM- 
SOMETHING NOVEL IN THE WAY OF TAXIDERMY— REAL BUFFALO-GRASS, REAL MON- 
TANA DIRT, AND REAL BUFFALOES. 

A little bit of Montana — a small square patch from the wildest part of the wild 
West — has been transferred to the National Museum. It is so little that Montana 
will never miss it, but enough to enable one who has the faintest glimmer of imagi- 
nation to see it all for hirnself-^-the hurnmocky prairie, the buffalo-grass, the sage- 
brush, and the buffalo. It is as though a little group of buffalo that have come to 
drink at a pool had been suddenly struck motionless by some magic spell, each in a 
natural attitude, and then the section of prairie, pool, buffalo, and all had been care- 
fully cut out and brought to the National Museum, All this is in a huge glass case, 
the largest ever made for the Museum. This case and the space about it, at the 
south end of the south hall, has been inclosed by high screens for many days while 
the taxidermist and his assistants have been at work. The finishing touches were 
put on to-day, and the screens will be removed Monday, exposing to view what is 
regarded as a triumph of the taxidermist's art. The group, with its accessories, 
has been prepared so as to tell in an attractive way to the general visitor to the 
Museum the story of the buffalo, but care has been taken at the same time to secure 
an accuracy of detail that will satisfy the critical scrutiny of the most technical 
naturalist. 

THE ACCESSORIES. 

The pool of water is a typical alkaline water-hole, such as are found on the great 
northern range of bison, and are resorted to for water by wild animals in the fall 
when the small streams are dry. The pool is in a depression in the dry bed of a coul6e 
or small creek. A little mound that rises beside the creek has been partially washed 
away by the water, leaving a crumbling bank, which shows the strata of the earth, a 
very thin layer of vegetable soil, beneath a stratum of grayish earth, and a layer of 
gravel, from which protrude a fossil bone or two. The whole bank shows the marks 
of erosion by water. Near by the pool a small section of the bank has fallen. A 
buffalo trail passes by the pool in front. This is a narrow path, well beaten down, 
depressed, and bare of grass. Such paths were made by herds of bison all over their 
pasture region as they traveled down water-courses, in single file, searching for water. 
In the grass some distance from the pool lie the bleaching skulls of two buffalo 
who have fallen victims to hunters who have cruelly lain in wait to get a shot at the

animals as they come to drink. Such relics, strewn all over the plain, tell the story 
of the extermination of the American bison. About the pool and the sloping mound 
grow the low buffalo-grass, tufts of tall bunch-grass and sage-brush, and a species of 
prickly pear. The pool is clear and tranquil. About its edges is a white deposit of 
alkali. These are the scenic accessories of the buffalo group, but they have an inter- 
est almost equal to that of the buffaloes themselves, for they form really and literally 
a genuine bit of the West. The homesick Montana cowboy, far from his wild haunts, 
can here gaze upon his native sod again ; for the sod, the earth that forms the face 
of the bank, the sage-brush, and all were brought from Montana — all except the pool. 
The pool is a glassy delusion, and very perfect in its way. One sees a plant growing 
beneath the water, and in the soft, oozy bottom, near the edge, are the deep prints 
made by the fore feet of a big buffalo bull. About the soft, moist earth around the 
pool, and in the buffalo trail are the foot-tracks of the buffalo that have tramped 
around the pool, some of those nearest the edge having filled with water. 

THE SIX BUFFALOES. 

The group comprises six buffaloes. In front of the pool, as if just going to drink, 
is the huge buffalo bull, the giant of his race, the last one that was secured by the 
Smithsonian party in 1888, and the one that is believed to be the largest specimen of 
which there is authentic record. Near by is a cow eight years old, a creature that 
would be considered of great dimensions in any other company than that of the big 
bull. Near the cow is a suckling calf, four months old. Upon the top of the mound 
is a "spike" bull, two and a half years old ; descending the mound away from the 
pool is a young cow three years old, on one side, and on the other a male calf a year 
and a half old. All the members of the group are disposed in natural attitudes. The 
young cow is snuffing at a bunch of tall grass ; the old bull and cow are turning their 
' heads in the same direction apparently, as if alarmed by something approaching ; the 
others, having slaked their thirst, appear to be moving contentedly away. The 
four months' old calf was captured alive and brought to this city. It lived for some 
days in the Smithsonian grounds, but pined for its prairie home, and finally died. It 
is around the great bull that the romance and main interest of the group centers.

It seemed as if Providence had ordained that this splendid animal, perfect m limb, 
noble in size, should be saved to serve as a monument to the greatness of his race, 
that once roamed the prairies in myriads. Bullets found in his body showed that he 
had been chased and hunted before, but fate preserved him for the immortality of a 
Museum exhibit. His vertical height at the shoulders is 5 feet 8 inches. The thick 
hair adds enough to his height to make it full 6 feet. The length of his head and body 
is 9 feet 2 inches, his girth 8 feet 4 inches and his weight is, or was, about 1,600 
pounds. 

THE TAXIDERMIST'S OBJECT LESSONS. 

This group, with its accessories, is, in point of size, about the biggest thing ever 
attempted by a taxidermist. It was mounted by Mr. Hornaday, assisted by Messrs. 
J. Palmer and A. H. Forney. It represents a new departure in mounting specimens 
formuseums. Generally such specimens have been mounted singly, upon a flat sur- 
face. The American mammals, collected by Mr. Hornaday, will be mounted in a 
manner that will make each piece or group an object lesson, telling something of the 
history and the habits of the animal. The first group produced as one of the results 
of the Montana hunt comprised three coyotes. Two of them are struggling, and one 
might almost say snarling, over a bone. They do not stand on a painted board, but 
on a little patch of soil. Two other groups designed by Mr. Hornaday, and executed 
by Mr. William Palmer, are about to be placed in the Museum. One of these repre- 
sents t- family of prairie-dogs. They are disposed about a prairie-dog mound. One

sits on its haunches eating ; others are running about. Across th e mouth of the bur- 
row, just ready to disappear into it, is another one, startled for tbe moment by the sud- 
den appearance of a little burrowing owl that has alighted on one side of the burrow. 
The owl and the dog are good friends and live together in the same burrow, but there 
appears to be strained relations between the two for the moment» 



THE PRESERVATION OF MUSEUM SPECIMENS FROM INSECTS AND 
THE EFFECTS OF DAMPNESS, 

By Walter Hough, A. M. 

The preservation of museum specimens is of no less importance than 
their acquisition. Periodically the attack of some new insect, or the 
infesting of some new material, is brought to the notice of curators, and 
hitherto many specimens have been destroyed which it would be now 
impossible to replace. In a great museum the abundance of the mate- 
rial will not permit its frequent examination, so that all specimens 
should be thoroughly poisoned before they get out of sight. There are 
many things which one would not think it necessary to poison, yet all 
should be, for nearly all organic structures have peculiar enemies in 
the insect world. As instances, woodwork, basketry, textiles, botan- 
ical specimens, etc., should be poisoned with corrosive sublimate, as it 
coagulates the albuminoid principles in vegetation and thereby pre- 
vents decay as well as the attacks of insects. 

The ravages of moths have been experienced from remote times, and 
though the preservation of materials from the attacks of these and other 
insects has been repeatedly attempted, all efforts, it seems, have so far 
been ineffectual. Most of the chemical substances suggested are too 
poisonous to be used on articles brought in contact with the person, 
as in every-day wear. Happily this is no objection here, for with ordi- 
nary precautions the specimens sent to the Museum can be treated with 
the strongest poisons, the main difficulty being to avoid damaging the 
material in their application. 

First in rank of destructiveness are the moths, of which four species 
have been observed at active work in the Museum. These are Tinea 
flavifrontella Linn., the common, or clothes, moth; T. tapetzella Linn., or 
carpet moth; T. pellionella Linn., or fur moth, and T. granella Linn., or 
grain moth. These Tineids are night-flying insects, though the little 
fluttering " millers " are often seen flying in darkened rooms in the day- 
time. Their natural habitat is in -dry animal and fibrous vegetable sub- 
stances, and sometimes on the fur of living animals ; in houses they 
infest woolens, furs, grain, etc., and the destruction caused by the larvae 
is well known. They begin to fly about actively in May. I have ob- 
served them in warm rooms as early as March, and have found the 
larvee all through the winter. In the stage in which this insect does 

549 



550 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

its destructive work, it is a plump white caterpillar provided with strong 
mandibles and sixteen legs. It nips the fiber, beginning as soon as 
hatched from the egg, and builds a case which is enlarged as the insect 
grows. These insects are known to travel in search of other quarters; 
they are very hard to kill, extreme cold does not affect them, and many 
of the domestic preventives, such as camphor, tobacco, etc., entirely fail 
to destroy them. 

All articles subject to injury from these moths should be often exam- 
ined and shaken, especially in spring and early summer, to dislodge 
the eggs. 

Another very serious pest is the " buffalo bug " (Anthrenus lepidus 
Linn.), and its relative the "carpet bug" (A. varius Fabr.). The adult 
is a small round sluggish beetle, brown, with white or variegated scales 
on the wing covers. The larvae are short, plump worms with numer- 
ous stiff, brown hairs. This insect is on the increase ; its ravages seem 
to have attracted the notice of the public, and much was written about 
it a few years ago, in 1882 and 1883. Like the tinea larva, the buffalo- 
bug larva cuts leather, woolen, or fur, and builds an incoherent case 
from the fragments. These insects multiply very rapidly, and are also 
unaffected by ordinary insect preventives. 

The larvse of the "basket beetle" (Sitodrepa panicea Linn.) are small 
worm -like creatures with six minute feet. They are furnished with 
strong cutting-jaws by means of which they eat their way into basketry 
and old wood, or similar substances, boring little holes as round as if 
made with a fine drill. The adult insect is a little, sluggish, brown 
beetle which simulates death on being disturbed. 

Another insect, the subject of a letter to Science, May 28, 1886, and 
there called "A New Museum Pest," is the "silver fish" (Lepisma domes- 
tica). The adult is a shining fish-shaped insect, wingless, but very quick 
in its movements. It prefers starch for food, and attacks everything 
that contains that substance, such as labels pasted or sized with starch 
or mucilage, cotton or linen laundered goods, etc. This insect is ex- 
tremely obnoxious to librarians, being attracted by the paste used in 
binding books. 

Other insects are often introduced into the Museum on specimens and 
by other means, but these are of less consequence, as they do not breed 
there and are usually not harmful. 

It has been thought well to introduce here a paper by Mr. John B. 
Smith, assistant curator of entomology in the Museum, relating to the 
care of insect collections. It was published in the Proceedings of the 
Entomological Society of Washington*,* under the title "Some Observa- 
tions on Museum Pests." 

One of the duties of a person in charge of a large collection of insects is keeping 
out museum pests, as the various species that feed on the dried insects are generically 
called. In a large collection, like that of the National Museum, no inconsiderable 

"Vol. I, No. 2, p. 113. 



PRESERVATION OF MUSEUM SPECIMENS. 551 

time is required for that purpose, as it takes at least two weeks to go through, all the 
boxes carefully. 

It has been the fashion to recommend as a certain preventive tight boxes, and 
quarantining all specimens before putting into the collection, and undoubtedly this 
is an excellent precaution, saving much future labor. It is, however, by no means 
the certain remedy it has been claimed to be. The boxes and cabinets in use in the 
Museum are as perfect, as far as safety is concerned, as it is possible to get them at 
present, yet withal constant care is required. Psocidce will find their way into the 
tightest boxes, and though they do little damage ordinarily, yet in a collection of 
Tineidce, or minute Diptera, they can do considerable damage. For these pests I have 
found naphthaline a perfect remedy. A single half-ounce cone is a perfect protection, 
and lasts about three months ordinarily. 

Tineid larvae are rather rarely found in the collections on the larger moths, and 
are not always easily discovered, since they make no dust, as do the Anthreni. On 
one occasion I found that one pair of wings of a C. regalis suddenly collapsed with- 
out apparent cause. Close examination showed a Tineid larva that had been feeding 
on the dense, long vestiture, making galleries in all directions in such a way that 
when I took hold of one end of the gallery, the vestiture of the under side came off 
in large sheets, leaving the wings almost clean, the veins broken here and there, 
which produced the collapse. They rarely burrow into the specimen, never in my 
experience. Ptinidce are sometimes found, but are exceedingly rare in our collection. 
One box lined with corn pith was riddled by them, and a very few specimens were 
attacked. By all odds the most dangerous enemies are the larvae of the Dermesiidce, 
which are pests pure and simple. The principal enemy in our collection is Anthrenus 
varius, though Trogoderma is not uncommon. 

My experience with these is, that in the uniformly high temperature preserved in 
the laboratory they breed all the year around, and have no definite broods; a few 
larva? appear at all times, though during the summer, when the beetles come in from the 
grounds, and from other parts of the Museum, exposed specimens are attacked at more 
regular intervals. The rule is to keep naphthaline in all boxes at all times, but, like 
all rules, it is not always possible to adhere strictly to it. The boxes not so protected 
are usually first attacked. In a cabinet not quite tight I coned a number of drawers 
and left the others unprotected. In the course of the summer the unprotected drawers 
nearly all became infested, while as a rule the others were free. The naphthaline 
seems to act as a repellant. I have found, however, that it does not annoy the larvae 
to auy very great extent, and Mr. Lugger has shown me a naphthaline cone in a hol- 
low of which a larva had pupated. I have reason to believe, however, that it does re- 
tard the development of young larvae. A large number of boxes, nearly one hundred, 
were received from North Carolina, containing a collection, principally Coleop- 
tera. They were overhauled and found to be pretty generally infested with Trogo- 
derma, this being the only species found. No Anthrenus larvae were noticed. Bisul- 
phide of carbon was freely used, and naphthaline cones were placed in all the boxes. 
For awhile the boxes were frequently examined and no larvae developed. Through- 
out the summer the boxes were examiued at intervals and remained free. With the 
approach of cold weather they were left for a longer period and the cones nearly ail 
evaporated. In December this was noticed, and the boxes were again overhauled, 
and it was found that a very general development of larvae had begun, all of them 
Trogoderma, and none of them more than 2 to 3 millimeters in length, most of them 
apparently just hatched. The entire collection was scrutinized, and an occasional 
Anthrenus larva was found, but no other Trogoderma, even in the most exposed boxes. 

I conclude from this that the collection when received was infested, and that there 
were e^gs everywhere ready to develop ; some had begun to develop, and these were 
destroyed by the use of bisulphide of carbon, which also served to check the develop- 
ment of the eggs. The boxes were quite large, and two large cones were put in each ; 
they were also quite secure, and the atmosphere in them was fully impregnated with 



552 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

the odor of naphthaline. Throughout the summer, when under ordinary circumstances 
they would have developed, the eggs remained dormant, but after the naphthaline had 
evaporated completely, development began. I might add here that Trogoderma is an 
exceedingly rare pest in New York, and not common in Washington ; farther south it 
seems to replace Anthrenus. For all these pests bisulphide of carboD is a sovereign 
remedy, except when they are burrowing in large Coleoptera or Lepidoptera. I have 
repeatedly soaked large Bombycids with chloroform or bisulphide, and a week later 
found them still infested. I worked for a month over some large Lucanids (Procule- 
jus), and finally separated the parts so that I could fill the body cavity with chloro- 
form. In one case, that was somewhat exposed and contained old material of little 
value, I found a specimen destroyed by Alicrogaster, a rare parasite for Anthrenus. 
How they got at this box is difficult to explain, since it was tight enough to prevent 
the entrance of the insect. 

I have noticed also that boxes on the lower tier of shelves are much more liable to 
attack than those on upper tiers, and this leads me to believe that the parent beetle 
will deposit eggs outside of the boxes or on the floor of the cases, and the young larvae 
will work their way into the smallest crevices. It seems difficult to account for iso- 
lated larvse in boxes containing only old insects. 

Finally I find the danger of infection comparatively greater at Washington than 
in New York, principally because the warm season begins earlier and lasts longer, in- 
creasing the chances of infection. I find, too, that the only real chance of safety con- 
sists in constant examination, tight boxes, and a free use of chloroform or bisulphide 
of carbon. 

As to naphthaline, I consider that it is a good general preventive. I know that 
it keeps out Psocids and ants. It enhances the tendency to grease and to verdigris, 
and in tight boxes it seems to exercise a relaxing tendency, causing the wings to 
droop. 

There are several classes of substances to be poisoned, in which the 
colors, fabric, or character of material, and therefore the kind of poison 
and the strength of solution, are important factors. For instance, goods 
not fast dyed (especially cotton), or which are dyed with colors that 
contain solutions, will start ; also fabrics or substances which may be 
corroded or hardened, or otherwise injured, as feathers, fur, dressed 
deer-skin, etc. Too strong a solution may also cause a deposit on fur, 
etc., with a dulling effect. As a test for this, a black feather should be 
dipped in the solution, if it is of corrosive sublimate or arsenic in alcohol. 
If the solution be too strong, it will produce a white coating when dry. 
Any solution should exert its action in two ways, first to repel the adult 
insect, and second, to' destroy the hatched larva. Pungent odors are 
noxious to moths and the higher orders of insects, but this is hardly 
true in the case of the beetles to which we have before alluded. The 
pungency of odor can not be made to last long, so that the poisoning 
quality is of prime importance. The substances used for solutions are 
deadly poisons, and no one who has not had experience in handling 
them had better undertake to apply them. Corrosive sublimate will 
attack the finger-nails and the skin. It is also volatile. Arsenic is 
prejudicial to the health; the dust, it is said, produces catarrh, both 
gastric and nasal, though this has not been confirmed by my observa- 
tion. 

Before poisoning, all objects should be treated with benzine, by put- 



PKESERVATION OF MUSEUM SPECIMENS. f)53 

ting them in a close box or vessel, and pouring the benzine in, leaving 
them tightly closed therein for several days. This operation destroys 
any larvse or eggs. They should then be hung up until the benzine 
evaporates before proceeding with the poisoning solutions. Bisulphide 
of carbon is more volatile and more quickly effective than benzine, and 
may be used, if preferred. There is reason to believe that both kill the 
eggs — quickly if the fluid comes in contact with them and less rapidly 
if they are directly affected only by the fumes in the vapor. Great care 
must be taken not to allow fire of any kind to come in contact with the 
vapor of bisulphide of carbon. There are several reasons why benzine 
is preferable, and the latter is sure to be effective when followed by 
the arsenic-naphtha solution. The solution found most satisfactory for 
poisoning nearly every kind of specimens is as follows: 

Saturated solution of arsenic acid and alcohol 1 pint. 

Stroug carbolic acid 25 drops. 

Strychnine 20 grains. 

.Alcohol (strong) 1 quart. 

Naphtha, crude or refined 1 pint. 

The use of strychnine is not absolutely necessary ; but it is a very good 
agent and adds much to the value of the solution. Other solutions and 
poisons will be noticed below. It will be found advisable to apply solu- 
tions in the form of spray to delicate objects, such as feathers or speci- 
mens of similar character. In this treatment an atomizer may be used. 
Some small specimens may be dipped and allowed to drain, and the 
solution may be applied with a brush to a large class of objects, taking 
care to saturate every part. The specimens can then be hung up to dry 
or laid away as they are. They should be kept free from dust, which 
is exceedingly injurious to them. As soon as poisoned, they ought, if 
intended for exhibition, to be mounted in dust-tight cases, or carefully 
stowed away in close-fitting drawers or boxes. In unit or costume 
boxes a small packet of naphthaline may be concealed behind the speci- 
mens, and the junction of the lid should be made dust-proof by pasting 
on strips of paper with paste containing arsenic or corrosive sublimate. 

Some specimens present problems that do not fall under any rule and 
have to be left to judgment and experiment. As an instance in point, 
we mention a fine deer-skin robe collected by Mr. Turner, beautifully 
tawed, with the hair on, and ornamented with a medium which will not 
stand wetting. It is obvious that no solution can be used in this case, 
since alcohol or water will harden the buck-skin and destroy the decor- 
ation. Satisfactory results might be obtained by judicious spraying, 
but there would be doubt as to the completeness of the poisoning. It 
would be better to rub into the kid surface a powder made of precipi- 
tated chalk and white arsenic. The fur side should then be well rubbed, 
care being taken to allow the powder to penetrate into the roots of the 
hair. By all means protect the hands with gloves. Powdered soap 
would also bo a good medium for the arsenic. Great care should be 



554 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887 



taken in applying this poison and in handling a specimen poisoned in 
this way. Such specimens should be at once closed up tightly and put 
on exhibition. 

Corrosive sublimate has been much used for poisoning and is a valu- 
able agent. Several specimens in the Museum, which were poisoned 
years ago with this substance, were so filled with it that they are dusty. 
They are made of fur-skin, and are stiff and unpresentable for exhibi- 
tion. I do not know what was the condition of the articles when they 
were acquired ; they are, however, undeniably moth-proof. I have found 
numerous adult moths destroyed in the act of laying their eggs. A care- 
ful use of corrosive sublimate is very effective, if it is not brought in con- 
tact with skins, as it coagulates albumen. It is also volatile, and Dr. G. 
H. Beyer, U. S. Navy, has proposed to take advantage of this property 
in preventing the growth of fungi on materia-medica specimens in jars. 
One objection to corrosive sublimate is that it crystallizes out very 
easily; this might be obviated by adding a little naphtha to the alco- 
holic solution. 

Naphthaline is used by Mr. J. B. Smith, of the Museum, and by other 
entomologists, to preserve insect collections from Acari, Psoci, Bermes- 
tes, Anthreni, and other museum pests.* It destroys the two former, 
but only tends to repel the others. It also acts as an antiseptic, de- 
stroying schizomycetes, moulds, bacteria, etc. The salt is perfectly neu- 
tral, is not poisonous to man, and is cheap. It is customary in this 
department to put a small packet or cones in cases containing mounted 
costumes. 

Vaseline may be called perfect grease, since it does not become ran- 
cid or corrosive. It is especially useful to protect iron and steel from 
rust, and no doubt would preserve woodwork from extraneous attack. 
It is also good to soften leather which has become hard. In the case of 
clubs, spears, and implements of hard wood, like those of Polynesia, a 
fine polish may be obtained by using vaseline. I regard vaseline as a 
good vehicle in which to apply white arsenic to skins, as is done with 
arsenic soap. It penetrates very well, especially if thinned a little with 
naphtha. Vaseline is also used on book-backs to soften them, to pre- 
vent mould, and to keep insects away. 

A few recipes germane to this subject, and which may be useful in 
other departments of the Museum, are appended: 

Mr. Hornaday has used arsenical soap prepared in the following 
manner : 

White soap 2 pounds. 

Powdered white arsenic 2 do. 

Camphor 5 ounces. 

Suhcarbonate of potash 6 do. 

Alcohol 8 do. 

See p. 555. 



PRESERVATION OF MUSEUM SPECIMENS. 555 

Slice the soap, melt it, add the potash, stir in the arsenic, and add the 
camphor previously dissolved in the alcohol. Stir, when cooling, to pre- 
vent the arsenic from sinking to the bottom. For use, mix a small 
quantity with water until it resembles buttermilk, and apply with a 
common paint-brush. This is a mechanical mixture. Mr. Hornaday 
has obtained results of the highest order from its use. The following 
is believed to be a more correct chemical combination : 

White soap = 1 ounce. 

Arseniate of potasli 2 do. 

Water 6 drachms. 

Camphor 2 do. 

Strychnine (ad lib. ) 15 grains. 

The following ingredients make an effective preservative powder : 

White arsenic „ 1 pound. 

Burnt alum 1 do. 

Powdered oak bark 2 do. 

Camphor f do. 

This should be powdered well, sifted and kept in well- stoppered bot- 
tles. It should be applied to the wet surface of skin and rubbed in 
well. The hands should be protected with gloves. I have never tried 
this preparation. 

The following solution has been prepared by Wickersheimer for the 
preservation of objects in the natural state : 

Alum 500 grains. 

Salt 125 do. 

Saltpeter 60 do. 

Potash 300 do. 

Arsenic trioxide (white arsenic) 100 do. 

Dissolve in 1 quart of boiling water. Cool and filter, and for 1 quart 
of the solution add 4 quarts of glycerine and 1 quart of alcohol. Either 
soak the objects in the solution, or inject them with it. This solution is 
said to do very well except in tropical climates. 

For botanical specimens this is said to be an excellent preservative : 

One ounce of corrosive sublimate to 1 quart of alcohol, diluted 50 
per cent. The best plan is to dip the specimens and then carefully dry 
them. The poison can also be painted on with a camel's-hair brush. 

For the preservation of entomological specimens, the strongest solu- 
tion used should be corrosive sublimate in alcohol, 1 to 100, and the 
weakest 0.1 to 100. (See remarks on naphthaline, ante.) 

For insects on plants, the following solutions are recommended : 



First solution. 

Salt 2-J pounds. 

Saltpeter 4 ounces. 

Water 1 gallon. 

Filter. 



Second solution. 

First solution 1 quart. 

Arseniate of potash 2 ounces. 

Water 1 gallon. 



556 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

A cheaper solution can be made by taking — 

White arsenic x pound. 

Sal soda 4 "ounces. 

Water „.. 1 gallon. 

Boil till a solution is made. Take 1 quart to 40 gallons of water. 
These solutions have been found by the Department of Agriculture to 
be very useful in destroying the scale-bug and the red spider, so harmful 
to plants. 

The following method is employed by furriers in the treatment of fur 
skins for the purpose of rendering them pliable : The skin is steeped 
and scoured in a bath of alum, bran, and salt, in order to remove greas- 
inessj then in a bath of soap and soda, to remove the oil from the fur. 
When thoroughly washed and dried it is found that the pelt has become 
tawed or kid leather. 

To soften and cleanse buck-skin or chamois leather, rub plenty of 
castile soap into the skin and soak for two hours in a weak solution of 
sal soda in warm water and rub well until quite clean. Afterwards rinse 
in a weak solution of sal soda and soap in water j after xinsing, wring it 
dry in a coarse towel, and when fully dry beat it until soft and smooth. 

For domestic purposes the following preventives from moth ravages 
are suggested : Dissolve in 200 parts of alcohol 2 parts of salicylic acid 
and 2 parts of thymol; perfume with oil of lemon. This is a neutral 
solution and will not injure colors or texture, and has a pleasant odor, 
but is rather expensive. 

A good preparation to sprinkle among furs being packed away in a 
close box or drawer, is naphthaline and menthol or thymol, in proportion 
of 1 ounce of the former to 20 grains of either of the latter, rubbed to- 
gether. The odor'will disappear from the furs or goods after they have 
been aired for a short time. Even if moths are present and are hatched, 
they will not feed when closely shut up in the odor of this mixture, and 
in this respect it is far superior to camphor. Thymol alone is very good. 
Naphthaline is now on the market in a very convenient shape called 
" moth marbles," and seems to be going into general use. 

In the following list of apparatus only those things have been men- 
tioned that have been found necessary or very useful in the operations 
at the National Museum. Doubtless at other places, where such a 
range of subjects for poisoning is not presented, some of the articles 
can be dispensed with : 

Gutta-percha atomizer, which may bought for one dollar. The bottle 
can be easily wired to a handle for convenience. (Fig. 1.)

a slot (Fig. 2a) that is to be filled with water to prevent escape of gas. 
The tank should be set out in the open air if possible. The size of the 
tank used here is 3 by 2 by 2 feet, and it has handles on the ends and on 
the lid. (Fig. 2.)

Shaw and Geary No. 2 air compressor (cost $15), and four-nozzle 
gutta-percha atomizer, cost $2.50. These are found necessary only 
when much spraying is to be done. 

Stock solution jar, jar for mixed solution, benzine jar or jug, gradu- 
ate, 1 pint; glass funnel, 3 paint brushes, not too large; several stone- 
ware jars with closely fitting lids for smaller specimens. With good- 
sized jars, or even a closely-joined box, the galvanized tank may be 
dispensed with, especially when benzine is to be used. 

The poison tags should not be large. They are convenient for show- 
ing whether specimens are poisoned or not, and when, and are some- 
times a good test whether they are well poisoned. They may be printed 
with death's-head and word "poisoned," with space for date and mu- 
seum number. 

The long established "Museum standard" cases are provided with 
bead"and groove (Figs. 3 and 4) which effectually exclude dust and in- 
sects, the two worst foes of museum collections. In putting up perish-

newly-hatched moth larva, the junction of the lid with the sides- is 
pasted over with strips of paper or muslin with glue, poisoned with 
corrosive sublimate or arsenic. This, with naphthaline cones inside, is 
the highest triumph of the preservation of museum specimens,

H. G. Beyeb. The direct action of calcium, sodium, potassium, and ammonium 
salts on the human hlood vessels. 

Medical News, September 4, 1886. 

When these investigations were begun, comparatively little was known with regard to the 
actiun of these salts on the blood-vessels. The results which had been recorded were rather 
indefinite and contradictory, and the methods used rather imperfect. It was of especial im- 
portance to ascertain by means of new and improved methods, as accurately as possible, the 
action of potassium salts on the vascular system, and, as far as this was done in these observa- 
tions, the few points of interest will here be briefly stated. 

Bromide of potassium, when administered in certain doses, is known to produce sleep, and 
acts, therefore, as an hypnotic. This effect, it is supposed, is produced by a condition of cere- 
bral anaemia induced by the drug, owing to contraction of the blood-vessels, which is said to 
ensue when this drug is administered. 

In the above investigations it was found that all the potassium salts tried, namely, the 
iodide, bromide, and chloride, invariably produced dilatation pure and simple with large 
and small doses, and no contraction whatever resulted at any time of the experiments. It 
is therefore rendered exceedingly probable by the results obtained in these experiments that 
contraction of the blood-vessels is no part of, at least, the direct action of these salts, and if the 
latter produce dilatation at all, it can only be owing to an effect which they might possibly 
exert on the vaso-motor center in the medulla. 

Cerebral anaemia, however, might still be produced even without the assumption of such an 
effect on the vaso-motor center, in about the following manner : In all the experiments which 
were made with potassium salts on the blood-vessels, considerable oedema of those organs 
through which the drug was allowed to flow was noticed. Hence, it must be assumed that 
one of the characteristic effects produced by these salts is to favor the transudation of fluids 
from out of the vessels into the surrounding lymphatics. The perivascular lymphatics, bow- 
ever, when completely filled, must necessarily compress to a certain extent tire vascular lumen, 
and hence cause a much diminished flow of blood to the part, besides compressing the tissues 
outside of and immediately against them. 

The conclusions drawn from these experiments are as follows : 

(1) Calcium salts cause the vessels to contract by virtue of their stimulating influence on the 
vaso-motor ganglia. 

(2) Sodium and ammonium salts excite, first, the ganglia of the vaso-dilators ; next, those of 
the vaso-motors ; hence producing at first dilatation, and afterwards contraction of the vessels. 

(3) Potassium salts stimulate the ganglia of the vaso-dilator only, and consequently produce 
dilatation ; if, however, as was shown in two observations, the dilatation which they produce 
is followed by contraction, this contraction is so extremely slight that it may practically be 
neglected ; therefore, any stimulating influence on the vaso-motor ganglia which they might 
possess is insignificant when compared with that which they exert over the vaso-dilators. 

H. G. Beyer. On the micro-organisms of lactic fermentation. 
Medical News, November 6, 1886. 

This paper is an experimental inquiry into the causes of the souring of milk. 
The presence of microorganisms in liquids undergoing fermentation has hitherto been inter- 
preted and explained in various ways. While some looked at those low forms of life as the 



566 EEPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

H. G. Beyer— Continued. 

mere associates of these processes, attributing the real cause of the resulting decomposition to 
chemical ferments, others, though believing in the causation of fermentation by microorganisms, 
looked at these processes as physiological ones or else attributed them to a certain power of 
adaptability possessed by certain microbes to different conditions of life. 

Lister was, perhaps, the first clearly to point out the fact that the peculiar and characteristic 
fermentative process by which milk becomes sour is initiated or directly caused by a certain 
species of microbe. "While, however, Lister had proved this fact, it did not necessarily follow 
from his experiments alone that the same process might not also be called into existence by a 
chemical ferment produced by the lacteal glands, and which was contained in the milk when 
it left these glands. 

The matter, therefore, even after Lister's famous experiments, remained as undecided as 
ever, and the contention which has grown up between chemists and biologists for ages past 
had not been diminished in any way. 

In the mean time our methods of bacteriological research having been greatly improved 
by the patient and admirable researche . of Prof. Eobert Koch, it had become necessary to 
reinvestigate this whole question. The task has, indeed, been most ably performed by Dr. 
Heuppe, whose researches will be found embodied in a recent contribution to our knowledge 
of lactic acid fermentation and fermentation in general, published in the Mittheilungen d. kaiger- 
lichen Gesundheitsamteg, Berlin, 1884. 

In this paper Heuppe has, we think, successfully demonstrated the fact that lactic acid 
fermsntation, or the process of the souring of milk, by whk h the sugar contained in milk is con- 
verted into lactic and carbonic acids, is directly dependent on or caused by a certain definite 
variety of microorganism, the morphological and physiological character of which renders it 
sufficiently distinct from any other known microbe. 

Heuppe has demonstrated his point in the following manner : First, by showing that this 
particular organism is constantly associated with lactic-acid fermentation ; second, by sepa- 
rating it from other microorganisms ; third, by cultivating it outside the original media in 
which it occurs, so as to separate chemical by-products ; fourth, by the inoculation of pure 
cultures into the proper media producing the characteristic decomposition ; fifth, by ascer- 
taining the biological conditions under which this process of fermentation is brought about in 
the best manner. 

Although Heuppe himself is exceedingly guarded in his conclusions, the results obtained 
by him from the very accurate series of experiments made according to the most modern and 
advanced methods, will, no doubt, be fully realized by even those who are but slightly familiar 
with the history of fermentation and the long struggle which has existed for ages, and still exists 
between chemists and biologists with regard to the nature and causes of fermentation. This 
alone would, no doubt, form sufficient pretext for a critical examination and repetition of at 
least a portion of Heuppe's experiments. But aside from this, and in spite of the fact that 
importation of Heuppe's lactic-acid germ is most likely to be an almost daily occurrence on 
this side of the Atlantic, the identity between it and the germs which cause the same decom- 
position in American milk must be proven by the same methods and experiments, in order to 
make this mere supposition a certainty. 

"With this object in view, I gladly took advantage of an opportunity kindly offered to me 
this summer by Drs.E. D. Salmon and Theobald Smith, of the Bureau of Animal Industry, TJ. 
S. Department of Agriculture, of working out this problem in their well-equipped laboratory. 

In repeating Heuppe's experiments, so far as th is was done by me, it was, of course, thought 
best to follow out the same course of experimenting and to use the same methods as were 
used by him, and the first question, therefore, which naturally arose was, What microorgan- 
isms, if any, do we find in sour milk as it occurs in our market ? 

Bacterium lactis may be described as a short, thick, plump, little rod, distinctly ovoidal in 
shape, about half as broad as long, and varying in length from 1 to 2/jl, its breadth remaining 
tolerably uniform. The best specimens may be found in milk cultures, the smallest in beef- 
infusion-pepton-gelatine cultures. As the bacterium lengthens a slight constriction about its 
middle portion becomes noticeable, which soon broadens and deepens, giving rise, just before 
complete division takes place, to the figure-8 form. This form becomes more especially notice- 
able in preparations stained with methyl-violet, which leaves a very minute central portion 
of the protoplasm unstained. The germ does not liquefy gelatine, and when examined on the 
hollow side it is found to be motionless. "With regard to spore-formation our experiments 
have not been attended by very positive results, although everything else seems to indicate 
that they do form spores. The settlement of this question will form one of the subjects of 
future investigations. 

The results of the foregoing experiments have led me to agree fully with those obtained by 
Heuppe, namely, lactic-acid fermentation, or the process of the souring of milk during which 
the sugar contained in the latter is converted into lactic and carbonic acids, is directly de- 
pendent or caused by the life and growth of a certain definite variety of microorganism, the

physiological characters of which are sufficiently distinct to differentiate it from any other 
known organism, and which, therefore, may be properly designated as Bacterium lactis. 

H. G. Beyer. The direct action of Atropine, Hyoscine, Hyoscyamine, and Daturine 
on the Heart of the Dog, Terrapin, and Frog. 

American Journal of the Medical Sciences, April, 1887. 

The question of the action of atropine and its congeners on the vascular system of animals 
has, perhaps, been the most difficult and perplexing which ever presented itself to the physi- 
ologist. 

For a period Of fifty years physiologists have been engaged with this problem, many ex- 
periments having been made, many bitter controversies having been fought out during this 
time, and yet the question could hardly be said to have been satisfactorily answered. 

So far as the action of atropia on the heart is concerned, the best authorities still differ in. 
about the following points: (1) That its action may be fully explained by assuming that a 
paralyzing influence is exerted on the terminal filaments of the pneumogastrics ; (2) that 
atropia at first stimulates and then paralyzes these filaments ; (3) that it not only paralyzes 
these filaments, but also, and at the same time, stimulates the vaso-motor apparatus of the 
heart. 

It seemed to me that the question of the action of atropine had gained anew in interest and 
importance with the discoveries of Gaskell on the origin, course, and distribution of the nerves 
supplying certain viscera. He found, for instance, that the heart of both cold and warm 
blooded animals was supplied with two kinds of nerve-filaments, the stimulation of the one 
accelerating and augmenting the heart's action, that of the other retarding or altogether stop- 
ping its action. 

It was thought that by a careful study of the action of atropine on the isolated heart it 
might be possible to attain good evidence as to how it affected at least the peripheral portions 
of this double nerve-supply and whether it stimulates or paralyzes the one kind of nerves te 
the exclusion of the other, or whether it affected both alike, and if so, how is this action influ- 
enced by the quantity of the drug administered at the time ? 

After a great many experiments of this kind, the conclusions which were finally reached 
were as follows : 

(1) Atropine, homatropine, hyoscine, hyoscyamine, and daturine are stimulants of the sym- 
pathetic nerve-apparatus of the heart. 

(2) The vaso-motor portion of this nerve-apparatus is affected by comparatively small doses 
of the drugs, giving rise to either acceleration or augmentation of the heart's action. 

(3) The inhibitory portion is excited by large doses only, giving rise to slowing of the heart's 
action, and, finally, causing diastolic arrest. 

(4) The muscular substance of the heart is greatly excited by atropine, homatropine, and 
daturine, and only slightly so by hyoscine and hyoscyamine. 

(5) The vaso-motor nerves and their ganglia are the first to become exhausted, the inhibitory 
ganglia and their nerves are the next, and the muscular substance is exhausted last of all. 

(6) The slowing of the heart's action which follows the administration of these drugs in the 
intact animal may be sufficiently accounted for by their influence on the inhibitory nerves 
and ganglia of the heart itself. 

• (7) Tbe acceleration following the administration of certain doses of these drugs can not be 
sufficiently accounted for by their action on the accelerator nerves and ganglia within the 
heart, but is principally due to causes resident outside this organ. 

The essential points brought out by these experiments are that both vaso-motor as well as 
inhibitory nerves are stimulated by the atropines, but that the former are affected by small 
doses, the latter by large doses only ; hence a large dose causing an excitation of the vaso- 
inhibitory portion of this nerve-apparatus may entirely cover up the vaso-motor excitement 
which is present simultaneously with that of the vaso-inhibitory portion of the nerve-appa- 
ratus. Inasmuch, however, as large doses quickly paralyze the vaso-motor apparatus, and 
also as the vaso-motor become exhausted sooner than the vaso-inhibitory nerves, the slowing 
of the heart's action following primary acceleration must be looked upon as a sign of much 
greater danger than the latter, and is indicative of much more profound action, for if this influ- 
ence is not arrested it will terminate in diastolic arrest. 

A point of interest needing to be emphasized is that different doses of the same drug may 
produce results on the same organ that are diametrically opposed to each other. 

The influence of atropine on organs of similar innervation, as is the heart, is assumed to 
be identical with that exerted on the heart.

568 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1887. 

H. G. Beyer — Continued. 

Particular attention is called to the necessity of investigating the action of drugs with uue 
regard to the chemical constitution of the latter, and examples are cited showing, beyond doubt 
the relation which exists betweeu chemical constitution and physiological action. 

A new outline classification of the whole science of pharmacology is included in this arti- 
cle, with explanatory notes of each of the terms used in this classification, which is as follows:

H. G. Beyer. The action of Tropin Hydrochlorate and Sodium Tropate on the 
peripheral blood-vessels. 

American Journal of the Medical Sciences, 1887. 

By a careful experimental study of the influence of atropine on isolated organs we have 
been able to furnish good pharmacological evidence in proof of the fact that this alkaloid ex- 
erts a double action on those organs which are supplied by both motor and inhibitory sympa- 
thetic-nerve structure. 

It has been shown that very small doses of the drug will stimulate the motor-nerve elements 
and that larger doses of it will stimulate the inhibitory portion of the nerve-supply of these 
organs. Thus, very small doses of atropine will give rise to contraction of the pupil, to ac- 
celeration of the heart's action, to increased peristalsis of the intestine ; large doses, on the 
contrary, produce dilatation of the pupil, arrest the heart in diastole, and stop the peristaltic 
movements of the intestine. Furthermore, in view of the important researches of Ladenburg 
on the chemical constitution of atropine, it seemed to me strongly advisable to try and ascer- 
tain if this double action of atropine could possibly be explained by a careful study and com- 
parison of the action of its two constituents, tropin and tropic acid. 

The pupil did not seem to me a sufficiently typical object for the determination of this all- 
important point, and I therefore concluded to try the blood-vessels, more especially since it 
is now looked upon generally as a well-settled question in physiology that the blood-vessels 
are supplied by two kinds of nerve structures, namely, vaso-motor and vaso-inhibitory, or 
dilator, the stimulation of the former causing vaso-constriction, that of the latter giving rise 
to vasodilatation. 

Consequently, we might argue that tropic acid is that part of the molecule of atropine which 
causes pupillary dilation, and if we have, furthermore, reasons to believe that tissues which 
are identical, both in histological structure and physiological function, are al o similarly 
affected by the same chemical stimuli, then it ought to follow that this same portion of the 
molecule of atropine should give rise to vaso-dilatation. Atropine, however, producing also 
vaso-constriction (in small dos.es at least), it would perhaps further follow that the remaining 
portion of the molecule should give rise to vaso-constriction. 

In these experiments on the blood-vessels with sodium tropate and tropin hydrochlorate an 
improved method was used. Instead of an artificial heart and lung to arterialize and pump the 
blood through the blood-vessels, as had been used in the latest researches of this kind by Drs. 
von Frey and Gruber, a natural heart and lung were interposed between the blood-reservoirs 
and the blood-vessels. Hence this method is free from all those objections which still cling to 
the old method, and, consequently, the result ought to be reliable. 

After making a number of experiments, it was found that tropin hydrochlorate produced 
vaso-constriction, and that sodium tropate gave rise to vasodilatation. We have here, then, 
an important and very decided illustration of the relation of chemical constitution to physio- 
logical action, and, at the same time, a very striking explanation of the double action of the 
alkaloid a tropin.

commanding. No. xxix. 8vo, pp. 171-318, Plates I-IX, Cambridge, the Museum. September, 
1886.) 

This paper comprises the first part of the report on the deep-sea Mollusca collected on the 
Blake expeditions, and consists, first, of a general discussion of the conditions of molluscan life 
at various depths, the effect of these conditions upon variation and specific equilibrium, a clas- 
sification of the regions of the sea bottom, and a review of the fauna of the depths as now 
known; second, of a description of the brachiopods and pelecypods of the Blake collection and 
illustrative species amounting to thirteen species and varieties of brachiopods and two hun- 
dred and fourteen of pelecypods (beside thirty mentioned or described as illustrative), com- 
prising three new families, twelve new subgenera or sections, and eighty-one new species, be- 
side those previously known. 

In addition to description of the shells, etc., anatomical details of high importance and pre- 
viously unknown are given for many species of the Pectenidce ; for Dimya, previously known 
only as a fossil for species of Modiola and Area, for the new family Poromyidce, and for the 
Verticordiidce, Cuspidariidce, and species of Anatinidce. 

The important fact of the absence of gills in the genus Ouspidaria (formerly known as 
Necera) is established, with many details and a re-arrangement of the genera and sections of 
the group as well as of the Poromyidce and Verticordiidce. 

A new and recent species of the genus Isocardia, section Meiocardia, hitherto represented 
by a single species in oriental seas, is shown to inhabit the Antilles, and the nomenclature of 
many American mollusks is revised and corrected.

series of his types is now complete. The six species described by Prof. A. E. Verrill from 
the collection of the North Pacific exploring expedition, 1853-1856, are also represented by 
the type specimens.

The collection is second, in this country, only to that of the Museum of Comparative Zoology 
at Harvard College. It contains one hundred and fifty-two determined species, many of which 
are represented by large series of specimens, covering a wide range of distribution, both geo- 
graphical and bathy metrical. Fifty- four species were derived from tho explorations of the TJ- 
S. Fish Commission, and the dredgings of the TJ. S. Coast Survey steamer Blake are represented 
by a nearly complete series of the species mentioned and described by Mr. Alexander Agassiz. 
The collection also contains all the species known from the western coast of North America, 
including a very large amount of material from Alaska. Most of the species obtained by Dr. 
Williani Stimpson, as naturalist of the North Pacific exploring expedition, 1853-1856, are also 
preserved, and miscellaneous accessions from various sources have added many forms. The 
catalogue is arranged systematically with respect to the species, under which each lot of speci- 
mens is recorded separately and in geographical order, with full data as to localities, depths, 
etc. Notes are given under a few of the species.

United States. (Abstract.) 

Proc. Am. Assn. Adv. Sci., xxxrv, Ann Arbor meeting, Aug. 1885, p. 516. (Author's extras 
issued July 1, 1886.) 

The author concludes that tbe adaptability of the United States to silk culture is proven; 
that the profits are very small ; that the encouragement given by Congress has been pro- 
ductive of good, and has intensified interest in the subject; but once withdrawn a reaction 
would set in ; that no permanent advantage to American silk-growers can be secured unless 
by a protective tariff which will recognize that the so-called "raw silk" is a manufactured 
article and entitled to protection.

issued July, 1886.) 

Shows that there is a certain periodicity in locust visitations ; analyzes the indications for 
1886, and concludes that there is some danger of injury for that year, though adverse weather 
may yet modify or avert the danger. The new remedy, somewhat extensively used on the 
Pacific coast recently, is a mixture of bran, sugar, arsenic v and water, which is placed as a 
bait throughout the infested localities.

BIBLIOGRAPHY. 585 

Charles V. RileY. Bumble-Bees vs. Red Clover. 

Rural New Yorker, April 23, 1887, vol. 46, p. 273. 

Records the fact as to settlement in Europe of the question of the more or less complete 
dependence of Red Clover for fertilization upon the Burnble-Bees. Records the recent experi- 
ences in New Zealand where this clover was nearly sterile. After the European Bumble-Bee 
was introduced and had spread rapidly, the beneficial effects on Red Clover were immediately 
perceptible in a much more liberal seeding. 

Chables V. Riley. Notes on Icerya. Its probable origin on the Islands of Bourbon 
and Mauritius. 

Pacific Rural Press, June 4, 1887, pp. 506, 507. 

Discusses the question of the identity of Icerya purchasi Maskell, with I. sacchari Signoret. 
Expresses the opinion that they will be found identical. The question of synonomy here is an 
important one, as it bears on the question of the original home of the species. If the two are 
identical, Mauritius and Bourbon are probably the points or origin, as specimens are easily 
transported with sugar from those points. 

To this are added extracts from correspondence bearing on this subject of origin as follows: 

Letter from Roland Trimen, of Cape Town, February 8, 1887. 

Letter from Frazer S. Crawford, of Adelaide, February 21, 1887. 

Letter from Baron von Muller, of Melbourne, March 21, 1887.

Extract from an article by E. J. Dunn, in Melbourne Argus, August, 1886. 

Charles V. Riley. The Hop Plant Louse. 

Waterville Times and Reflex June 17, 1887. 

Gives an account of recent discoveries in the life history of Phorodon humuli. It is now 
definitely established that the winter eggs are laid on Plum ; that from these eggs hatch lice 
that for three generations live on Plum, then become winged and migrate to the Hop, where 
they increase and go through the well-known life history. Refutes the views heretofore held 
on the subject, and explains how he was led to discover the true state of the case, and the im- 
portant bearing of the discovery to hop-growers in regions not yet infested with the pest. 

Charles V. Riley. Two new Insect Pests. 

Rural New Yorker, June 25, 1887, vol. 46, p. 416. 

Treats of "A new apple pest," the Apple-leaf Flea-beetle (Haltica punctipennis Leconte), 
and "A new destructive Cricket in Louisiana." The former had been found on Hawthorn by 
the author as long ago as 1872. This year it appeared in great numbers near Gainesville and Gal- 
veston, Texas, and did great damage. Paris green has been used against it successfully. The 
latter has appeared in Catahoula Parish, Louisiana, in destructive numbers. It is a true Gryllus, 
species as yet unknown, which eats a great variety of cultivated plants. Its method of work 
is described, and a bran, sugar, and arsenic mash suggested as a remedy. 

Charles V. Riley. Report of the Entomologist.

Charles V. Riley. The Cottony Cushion-scale {Icerya purchasi Maskell). 

Report of the Entomologist, Department of Agriculture, 1886, pp. 466-492, pi. i-v. 

Gives first an account of the dates of first acquaintance with the insect; geographical dis- 
tribution, looking more particularly to its probable point of origin, its spread, and limitation 
in California ; the range of food-plants in Australia, New Zealand, and California. The life- 
history in all its stages is given in great detail and illustrated. The rate of growth is dis- 
cussed, as are also its habits. The sweet secretion, called "honey-dew," is extremely abun- 
dant, and attractive to other injects. Details mode of spread and distribution, gives a list of 
natural enemies, among them a Microlepidopteron, Blastobasis iceryceella, n.sp., which is de- 
scribed. A chalcid parasite has also been discovered, belonging to a new genus, character- 
ized as Isodromus Howard, and described as I. iceryce, n. sp. Remedies and preventives are 
disoussed, and spray solutions with a base of kerosene recommended as most likely to be 
effective.

Report of the Entomologist, Department of Agriculture, 1886, pp. 539-546. 

The common Joint "Worm (Isosoma hordei Harr.) has been increasing in number of late 
years; comparison of injury with that caused by the Hessian Fly (Cecidomyia destructor). 
Review of points at which injury was done. Isosoma nigrum Cook, is a re-description of this 
old species. Some details as to breeding and some notes on parasites. The Wheat-straw 
Isosoma (Isosoma iritici Riley) has been carefully studied, and the results of the studies are 
here given. The species proves dimorphic in the female form, the dimorphic variety having 
been described as I. grande Riley. Details of manner in which this was established. Sum- 
mary of life history. Geographical distribution. Appearance in Kansas for the first time.

Bird-skins. 

From Swan Island, 31 species, 22 of which are land birds. This number in- 
cludes 17 migrants from eastern North America ; Coccyzus seniculus, from Central 
America and West Indies; Columba leucocephala, from the coast of Honduras and 
some of the Greater Antilles; Mimocichla rubripes, identical with the Cuban 
species, and not the same as that found on Grand Cayman (M. ravida Cory); Con- 
topus alMeollis Lawr. ?, probably identical with a Yucatan species ; and Dendroica 
vitellina Cory, identical with a species found elsewhere only on Grand Cayman. 

The only new form is a Butorides, allied to B. virescens, but altogether darker 

in coloration, and perhaps different enough to be considered specifically distinct. 

The water-birds include specimens of the following species : Tringa maculata,

which Mr. Cory identified (from very poor specimens) as D. petectria gundlachi, 
which proves to be a very strongly characterized new race not specially near to 
anything else.
