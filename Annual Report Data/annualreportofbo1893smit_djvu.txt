JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF 
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. 



ANNUAL MKETINd OF THK BOARD f)F KEfrKNTS. 

January 25, 1893. 

The annual meeting of the Board of Eegents of the Smithsonian 
Institution was liehl to-chiy at 10 a. m. Present: The cliancellor, Mr. 
Chief Justice Fuller; Vice President L. P. Morton ; the Hon. J. S. Mor- 
rill; the Hon. S. M. Cullom; the Hon. George Gray; the Hon. Joseph 
Wheeler; the Hon. Henry Cabot Lodge; the Hon. W. C. P. Breckin- 
ridge; Dr. J. C. Welling; Dr. Henry Coppee; Dr. William Preston 
Johnston; John B. Henderson, esq., and the secretary. 

A letter was read from Dr. J. B. Angell, stating that his nonattend- 
auce was on account of important business engagements. 

The secretary then presented the minutes of the last annual meeting 
of January 27, 1892, and of the special meeting of March 29, 1892, which, 
at the suggestion of the chancellor, he read in abstract. Keferring to 
the mention there of authority given by the Eegents at the last regular 
meeting to bring the matter of an additional appropriation for admin- 
istrative expenses before Congress, the secretary remarked that the 
time had not been considered opportune and that the Eegents' authori- 
zation had not yet been acted upon. 

The minutes of both meetings were approved. 

The secretary then announced that the Vice-President, on December 
20, 1892, ajjpointed as Eegent the Hon. George Gray, a U. S. Sen- 
ator, in place of the Hon. E, L. Gibson, deceased. Also that by 
joint resolution, approved by the President January 9, 1893, Dr. J. B. 
Angell had been reappointed a Eegent to succeed himself, his term 
expiring January 19, 1893. 

The secretary announced the death of the Hon. E. L. Gibson on 
December 15, 1892, reniarking that one who had known him longer 
and better than he had, would doubtless say what was fitting in this 
connection. 

Dr. Johnston then moved that a committee be appointed to draft a 
suitable memorial and resolutions, which was carried, and the chancel- 
lor appointed Dr. Johnston, Senator Morrill, and the secretary a <H)m- 



XII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. 

mittee of three to report the resohitious to the board. Dr. Johustoii then 
presented the following- iiieinorial and resohitions, whicli were adopted: 

The Board or Regents: 

Your committee rejxjrt that the Hon. Randall Lee Uih.sou was appointed a Regent 
of the Smithsonian Institution December 19, 1887, and lilled that otidce until his 
death, December 15, 1892. 

Senator Gibson brought to the performance of his duties as Regent a rare prepa- 
ration as student, scholar, and statesman. With inherited talents for oratory and 
-with strong literary tendencies, he was surrounded in youth by all the influences 
that direct the energies of man to the public welfare. At Yale College he took a 
very prominent stand in a group noted for talents and eutliusiasm. Foreign travel, 
the study of the law, the life of a planter, a distinguished military career, and long 
service in the Congress of the United States filled his capacious mind with a store 
of a rich and varied experience and trained him for the highest duties. Life was 
to him a consecration to public duty, and the performance of that duty his highest 
felicity. Benevolent, brave, patient, prudent, faithful, his grace and gentleness 
were the rich drapery of an inflexible will and tenacious purpose. 

He came to the Smithsnnion Institution as a servant animated by the fullest sense 
of his responsibilities and self-pledged to a rigid performance of them. His interest 
in the institution has been limited <mly by the conditions of his position. His 
death is a loss to his State and his country, in Avhose councils he has served for 
eighteen years. 

In view of these facts, it is — 

liesolved. That in the death of the Hon. Randall Lee Gibson the Smithsonian 
Institution has lost a zealous aud useful regent, and its board a valued member 
whose services can ill be spared. 

Resolved, That we lament his loss as an acceptable colleague, a gracious gentle- 
man, a patriotic citizen, and a wise statesman, whose interest in the spread of 
knowledge among men fitted him well for his duties on this board. 

Resolved, That these resoluticms be entered on the minutes of the board and a 
copy be transmitted to the family of our friend. 

Dr. Johustou added that Senator ( Jibson's death was a particular 
sorrow to him; they had been friends from boyhood with never a single 
cloud in their friendship. He was with Senator Gibson in his last hours 
and felt in his death a great personal loss, and he did not doubt that 
all who knew him personally regretted his loss to themselves and to 
the country. 

The secretary then announced the death on March 4, 1892, of Dr. 
Koah Porter, a former liegent. 

The secretary presented his report for the year ending June 30, 1892, 
stating that it was confined to matters of major importance, matters of 
detail being found in the appendix. He had endeavored to i)ut into it 
only matters that might demand publicity, and had arranged the report 
in this form so as to permit it to be read. He had dwelt at some length 
on the features of the National Zoological Park. The rest of the report 
would speak for itself, but he might call attention to statements about 
the disposition of the income of that portion of Mr. Hodgkin's gift which 
was specially directed to one purpose, and to the f(n m of some of the 
letters written to distinguished men all over the world in relation to it. 

The report was accepted. 



JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XIII 

Dr. Welliug, on behalf of liis colleagues, presented the report of the 
executive committee to June 30, 1892, which was adopted. 

Dr. Welliug also said that he would here present the usual resolu- 
tion relative to the income and expenditures of the institution, which 
was adopted, as follows: 

Eesolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 
1894, be appropriated for the service of the institution, to be expended by the Secre- 
tary with the advice of the executive committee, upon tlie basis of the operations 
described in the last annual report of said committee, with full discretion on the 
part of the secretary as to items of expenditures properly falling under each of 
the heads embraced in the established conduct of the institution. 

Dr. Welling then said that at the last regular meeting, the secretary- 
had presented a statement of the burdens imposed by the need of his 
pervsonally signing all purely routine money papers, and theboawl had 
referred a resolution on the subject to the executive committee, with 
power to act. He would now present the result of their action as fol- 
lows : 

Washington, D. C, April 15, 1892. 
Whereas a memlier of the Board of Regents, at their last meeting on January 27, 
1892, ottered the following resolution: 

"liesolved, That the Secretary be empowered to appoint some suitable person who, 
incase of need, w.iy sign such requisitions, vouchers, abstracts of vouchers, accounts 
current, and indorsements of checks and drafts, as are needed in the current business 
of the Institution or of any of its bureaus, and are customarily signed in the bureaus 
of other Departments of the Government." 

And whereas this was referred to the executive committee with power to act — 
Resolved, That the executive committee approve the resolution in the terms pro- 
posed, and confirm the Secretary in the powers therein mentioned. 

James C. Welling, 
Henky Coppke, 
J. B, Henderson, 

Executive Committee. 

Dr. Welling added that the action was taken sim})ly to relieve the 
Secretary of what was becoming a too heavy tax upon his time and in 
other ways an increasing burden, and it was to further provide that, in 
case of his absence, the work of the Institution should not be sus- 
pended; that he had now power to delegate authority to sign such 
routine papers. 

The Secretary announced the death of Mr. Thomas G. Hodgkins on 
November 25, 1892, and read the following obituary notice: 

Mr. Thomas G. Hodgkins, who died at Setauket, Long Island, on November 25, 
1892, was born in London, England, in 1803. His ancestors were clergymen, and 
belonged to the class of English gentlemen, but his father, who was in reduced cir- 
cumstances, was unable to keep him at Eton or Harrow, and sent him to France, 
where he remained for his education until he was about 15 years old. During this 
time his language, habits, and manners became rather French than English. 

He returned to England, but troubles with a stepmother made his home anbear- 
able, and against the urgent entreaty of his father he shipped before the mast in a 
trading vessel bound for Calcutta. The vessel was wrecked near the mouth of the 



XIV JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. 

Hoogly, and .young Jlodgkins found liini,-<tdf lu'unih'ss and friendless iu Calcutta, 
where he was taken ill and carried to the hospital. He has since said that it was 
here, and when he was a sick hid, who was told that ho had not six months to live, 
that he made np his mind that he would live, that he would acquire a fortune, and 
that he would devote it to large and philanthropic cuds. 

He recovered sufficiently to prepare a petition to the Governor-(Teneral of India, 
who was then the Marquis of Hastings, asking for aid to return to England; and 
he walked a long distance into the country, where the Governor-General was staying 
at his country seat, to deliver it. He arrived at the vice-regal residence bare footed 
and ill-clad, and asked an audience with the ruler of India with such persistence 
that the attenilants, who at first refused, finally consented to present his petition. 
This so impressed the viceroy when he read it that he directed that the young 
sailor should be admitted to see him, and the interview that followed ended by his 
ottering young Hodgkins a jiosition in his household which any gentleman's son 
might have been willing to accept, but which he refused from his overmastering 
wish to return to his iather. 

I think this curious adventure (as it may almost be called) deserves narration as 
an instance both of the remarkable force of Mr. Hodgkins's character and of the evi- 
dence of gentle breeding Lis manners always bore, and of the jnfluencc both had on 
others even iu his earliest years. 

After going home he went to Spain, and later, returning to England, he married, and 
in 1830 came to this country. He immediately engaged iu business, which he pursued 
with unremitting energy for thirty years, when he retired on what was at that time 
considered a handsome fortune. The fifteen years following this he spent in trav. 
elling over Europe and America, and in 1875 he settled down in Setauket, Long 
Island, upon his place " Brambletye Farm," which he rarely left, except for an 
occasional visit to New York, until his death. 

Mr. Hodgkins was a man of remarkably self-])oised mind, singularly independent 
in his modes of thought, and independent also of the need of social converse or of 
adventitious interests. His opinions were his own, and he found in the reading 
which confirmed them and iu the care of his little farm abundant and agreeable 
occupation for his declining years. He was a man of keen intelligence, and by 
nature, perhaps, still m<\xe a thinker and a scholar than a man of affairs, though 
even in the latter capacity his ability was proven by his success in business. He 
possessed a strong will, and had deliberately formed and tenaciously held opinions 
of his own in relation to religious and philosophical questions. In regard to the 
former, it may be sufficient to say that his mind was of a devout cast, and that 
while he had thought much for himself, he retained to the last an absolute trust in 
the divine guidance as the leading motive of his life. 

Mr. Hodgkins had for more than thirty years made a special study of the atmos- 
phere in its relations to the well-being of humanity. He believed that most of the 
physical evils to which mankind are subject arise from the vitiation of the air 
which they breathe, and that the study of the atmosphere is not unimportant even 
with relation to man's moral and spiritual, as well as his physical health; and 
though he did not point out any line of investigation likely to bear fruit in the latter 
direction, it was his hope that the concentration of thought upon the atmosphere 
and its study from every point of view, would in time lead to results which would 
justify his almost devout interest in the subject. 

In this last respect, his beliefs about the atmosphere, otherwise clear enough, 
wei'e not always easy to follow, T)ut though all those who talked to him were not 
sure that they here understood his full meaning, it was at least plain that he was 
well content to place his trust in the charge of such an institution as the Smith- 
sonian, and to leave it to the future to shape the result. 

He was very explicit, however, in his statements that it was not for sanitary sci- 
ence Of for meteorology, or for the like branches of study alone or for those which 



JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XV 

might seem most obviously snggesteil by tho ■\vortls of his trust, to profit exclu- 
sively by it, for he believed that eveiy department of philosophy (using the term 
in its widest sense) would be found to be finally connected with every ether, through 
this common bond of union ; so that it was his particular desire to have such varied 
investigations in the atmosphere made as would aid in the knowledge of each and 
all of these aspects of knowledge. 

Mr. Hodgkins brought to all his studies, as to this, a A^ery retentive memory, 
while general reading and travel had stored his mind with singularly varied infor- 
mation. He was a good French sch<dar and loved to quote from the French classics. 
His catholicity of mind was snfficientto include a not inconsiderable sense of hunuir, 
and his favorite quotation from Boileau pointed to his consciousness of a perhaps 
too imagiuative indulgence in his favorite themes. He was a punctilious corres- 
pondent, and what it is not too much to call his real literary ability, was neversliown 
more happily than in his letters, which were in many respects models of epistolary 
ease, and even of charm, of diction. He was hospitable and enjoyed entertaining 
the few friends whom he admitted to his table, where his manner, as a host of the 
old school, was a happy one. 

Mr. Hodgkins had no family an<l no known blood relations, and, recognizing the 
difficulties which often arise over the settlements of large estates, he chose to be 
his own executor rather than leave the disposition of his affairs to those who might 
either misinterpret or disregard his requests when he could no longer appear as a 
witness in his own behalf. He therefore gave away his entire estate, amounting to 
ab.out half a million dollars, to various public institutions. 

His funeral was unostentatious, as he requested it should be, only his intimate 
friends attending. Among these he (the Secretary) was numbered ; for while he felt 
it his official duty to represent this Institution at the funeral of one to whom it owed 
so much, ho desires to say, in concluding this brief notice, thathe was there also from 
a feeling of real friendship and regard to an old man whose singular powers, whose 
lonely life, and whose perhaps often iinmet aft'ection had drawn the speaker to him 
as to a personal friend. 

Mr. Wheeler remarked that the gentleman who had given the Insti- 
tution .so much deserved some special record of liis death, and he moved 
that the notice should be extended by the Secretary, should include a 
statement of the gifts he had made, and should be spread upon the 
records of the Board. The motion was carrieil. 

The Secretary then presented the portrait of Mr. Hodgkins, which 
he stated he had wished to order under the instructions of the Board 
during Mr. Hodgkins's lifetime, but owing to that gentleman's reluc- 
tance to be portrayed, it was not executed until after his death, and 
from a photograph. It was not yet finished, the artist, Mr. Robert 
Gordon Hardie, desiring its return in order that he might elaborate it. 

The Secretary added that from his knowledge of the original he consid- 
ered, and that the assistant secretary Dr. Goode (who was well quali- 
fied to judge), also considered the picture a very satisfactory likeness 
indeed. Dr. Welling remarked that it looked as if it could hardly be 
much improved as a likeness by nuich greater elaboration. Mr. Lodge 
said that while he could not, of course, speak of the likeness in case of 
one he had not seen, the picture bore its own evidence that it was a 
piece of good work. Other commendatory remarks were made. 

The secretary called the attention of the Regents to the action taken 
"^ith regard to that portion of the Hodgkins fund which was especially 



XVI JOURNAL Ot^ PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. 

devoted to scientific ]nuposes. He had taken counsel witli many emi- 
nent scientific men in iMirope as well as at home, as to the best dispo- 
sition to make of this fund, and given the matter much thought, A 
portion of the results of this care was embodied in the circular which 
he then presented for the consideration of the board. 

He stated that it was the intention to send tliis circular to all parts 
of the world, and that after eliminating from the list of the correspond- 
ents of the institution, those whichit was not considered should receive 
it—about two-thirds in all — there yet remained about 8,000 to be sup- 
plied; and these were scattered all over the inhabited parts of the 
globe, including Africa, and the small islands of the Pacific. 

In affixing the old seal of the institution to these, the secretary had 
noticed that it bore no legend or indication of the institution's pur- 
poses, although to the vast majority of those receiving it, these were 
unknown. He had been led by this to prepare a new seal in which the 
words of Sniithson, '^ For the increase and diffusion of knowledge among 
men " should take the place of his face. He would speak of this later. 

The circular was examined by the members of the board. The chan- 
cellor said it might be well to state on the heading of the circular that 
the President of the United States was ex-officio presiding officer of 
the institution, and the secretary stated that he would act on the sug- 
gestion. 

After reading the circular in brief, the secretary recurred to the sub- 
ject of the seal. He said he had consulted a number of sources for 
sucli a design, without much success, until lie had finally been fortu- 
nate in securing one from IMr. St. Ciaudens, who had made one from 
the secretary's indications, whicli he was ghid to submit to the regents. 

The Secretary remarked that the prejtaration of the circular and the 
aniiouncement of the prizes r.nd medal had been made under the instruc- 
tions of the board that this portion of the income should be expended 
in carrying out the express wishes of the donor. The circular had been 
carried down to Setauket and was one of the last things that had occu- 
pied the attention of Mr. Hodgkins. He was personally consulted about 
it and ai)proved the plan. 

Mr. Lodge then oftered the following resohition, which was adopted: 

Resolved, That the Secretary bo authorized to i)rocure a new seal for the institu- 
tiou, with a suitable motto aud device, to comprehend, the words of Smithson, "For 
the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men," aud also the words, "Smith- 
sonian Institution, Washington, 1846." 

The Secretary then read a portion of the will of Mr. Hodgkins where 
he makes the institution his residuary legatee. He wished to state that 
he had learned from the executor, but altogether unofticially, that the 
amount coming to the institution under tliis will, as residuary legatee, 
was but a few thousand dollars, Mr. ilodgkhis having meant to give 
away as fnr as possible all of his i)roperty at the time of Uis deaths He 



JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XVII 

also stated that it was, however, probable that certain bonds deposited 
by Mr. Hodgkins in a trust company, though forming no portion of the 
residuary estate, would come to the institution, and he asked the instruc- 
tions of the Eegents as to their disposition. 

Dr. Welling then read the following resolution : 

Resolved, That the Secretary be authorized to sell at the market price, any bonds 
or securities which may accrue to the iustitution as residuary legatee of the late 
Thomas G. Hodgkins, or from any trust instituted by him in its favor, if it is in the 
Secretary's judgment desirable to do so; and should there accrue any further sura 
not demanding the special consideration of the Regents by its importance, that he 
be authorized to apply it to the general purposes of the institution. 

On motion of Senator Cullom, the resolution was adopted. 

The Secretary then brought before the board the matter of the 
change in the organization of the establishment, calling attention to 
two points for consideration : 

At a meeting of the Regents on January 28, 1891, the Secretary stated 
that he had been authorized by the President, the Vice-President, the 
Chief-Justice, and other members of the establishment to ask for legis- 
lation to make the establishment consist of the President, Vice-Pres- 
ident, Chief-Justice, and all the heads of Departments. 

Since the Institution was established the place filled by the Commis- 
sioner of Patents would seem to have been taken by the creation of the 
Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary of Agriculture has been cre- 
ated, while the office of the governor of the District of Columbia no 
longer exists. 

The proposed change would be covered by the following act: 

Be it enacied, etc , That "An act to establish the Smithsonian Institution for the 
increase and diffusion of knowledge among men," approved August 10, 1846, Revised 
Statutes, Title lxxiii, be, and the same is hereby, amended in Section 5579 of said 
act by striking out the words "the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, 
the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, the Postmaster-General, the Attor- 
ney-General, the Commissioner of the Patent-0f6ce, and the governor of the District 
of Columbia, and such other persons as they may elect honorary members," and 
inserting the words "the heads of P^xecutive Departments," so that the section will 
read : 

"Sec. 5579. The President, the Vice-President, the Chief-Justice, and the heads 
of Executive Departments are hereby constituted an establishment by the name of 
the 'Smithsonian Institution' for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among 
men; and by that name shall be known and have perpetual succession, with the 
powers, limitations, and restrictions hereinafter contained, and no other." 

The Secretary said that he had consulted the President, the Vice- 
President, the Chief Justice, the Secretary of State, and those two 
members of the Cabinet mostly interested, and had their sanction in 
making this suggestion, and though it was a matter which concerns 
the establishment, he thought it proper to state his proposed action to 
the Regents, and if there were no objection on their part, he would 
infer their assent to this the first amendment sought. 
SM 93 ir 



XVIII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. 

The sec'oud cbange proposed by tbe Secretary, after consultation 
■with the Chief Justice, and after an examination of the fundamental 
act by Mr. H. E, Davis, was as follows: 

To amend Section HHOl of the Revised Statutes by the addition of 
these words: 

But this shall uot operate as a liiiiitatioii on the power of the Smithsoniau lustitu- 
tiou to receive money or other property hy gift, bequest, or devise, and to hold and 
dispose of the same in promotion of the purposes thereof, and as provided in the next 
section. 

The chancellor said, with regard to legislation concerning the funds, 
that section 5591 might possibly as it stood appear to operate as a limit- 
ation; and that, though he did not himself consider that any reason- 
able doubt could arise as to the right of the Regents to hold property 
outside of the million any more than to deposit sums within it, yet, out 
of abundant precaution, he had approved of the addition of the words 
as read. 

A motion by Senator JMorrill that the Secretary be authorized to draw 
up a bill providing for such changes in the legislation as were desir- 
able in sections 5579 and 5591 of the Revised Statutes, and to present 
the same to the Senate and House through Congressional Regents, was 
then put by the chancellor and carried. 

There being no further business to come before the board, on motion 
it adjourned.

REPORT OF S. P. LANGLEY, 

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN^ INSTITUTION, 

FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1893. 



To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution: 

Gentlemen : I have the honor to submit herewith a report of the 
operations of the Smithsonian Institution for the year ending June 30, 
1893, iuckiding- the work placed by Congress under its supervision in 
the National Museum, the Bureau of Ethnology, the Bureau of Inter- 
national Exchanges, the Zoological Park, and the Astro-Physical Ob- 
servatory. 

I have endeavored to give in the body of the report, and as briefly as 
possible, a general account of the affairs of the Institution for the year, 
reserving for the appendix the more detailed and statistical reports 
from the officers in charge of the different branches of work. 

The report upon the National Museum by the Assistant Secretary, 
Dr. G. Brown Goode, is here given only in abstract. Its full presenta- 
tion occupies a separate volume. (Report of the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion, National Museum, 1893.)

2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

THE BOARD OF REGENTS. 

Ill accordance with a resolution of the Board of Eegeuts adopted 
January 8, 1890, by which its stated annual meeting occurs on the 
fourth Wednesday in each year, the board met on January 25, 1893, 
at 10 o'clock A. M. The journal of its proceedings will be found, as 
hitherto, in the annual report of the board to Congress, though refer- 
ence is here made to several matters upon which action was taken at 
this meeting. 

The changes that have taken place in the membership of the Board 
of Eegents have been — 

First, through the death of Senator E. L. Gibson, which occurred on 
December 15, 1892. Senator George Gray, of Delaware, was appointed 
on December 20, 1892, by the Vice-President to till the unexpired term 
of Senator Gibson, and having been re-elected as Senator from Dela- 
ware, was re-appointed Eegent on March 10, 1893. 

A brief sketch of Senator Gibson's life is given in the necrological 
notices that close the present report, but I may quote here the follow- 
ing resolutions prepared by a committee consisting of Dr. Wm. Preston 
Johnston, Senator J. S. Morrill, and the Secretary, which were pre- 
sented at the meeting of the Eegents on January 25, 1893 : 

Besolved, That in the death of Hon. Eandall Lee Gibson, the Smith- 
sonian Institution has lost a zealous and useful Eegent, and its board 
a valuable member whose services can ill be spared. 

Besolved, That we lament his loss as an acceptable colleague, a- 
gracious gentleman, a patriotic citizen, and a wise statesman, whose 
interest in the spread of knowledge among men fitted him well for 
his duties on the board. 

Kesolred, That these resolutions be entered on the minutes of the 
board, and a copy be transmitted to the family of our friend. 

Second, President James B. Angell, of the University of Michigan, 
whose previous term of office expired on January 13, 1893, was reap- 
pointed for six years by a joint resolution introduced by Senator J. S. 
Morrill, of Vermont, which passed the Senate on December 20, 1892, 
the House of Eepreseutatives on January 0, 1893, and was approved 
by the President January 10, 1893. 

ADMINISTRATION. 

I have called attention to the desirability of securing from Congress 
an appropriation to meet actual outlays incurred in administering Gov- 
ernmental trusts. These direct outlays for matters not equitably 
chargeable to the fund of James Smithson, are growing a more consid- 
erable tax upon it each year. They are incurred in serving purely 
Governmental interests, but they are not met by any of the present 
appropriations, since they belong not singly to tlie National Museum, 
or the Bureau of Ethnology, or to the International Exchange service, 
or the like, but to expenditures common to all of them, and which 
are not provided for by the terms of the appropriations for any one. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3 

It is iu the interests of economy tliat this expeuditure shoukl be met 
from some common source, owing to the limited size of the establisli- 
ments in question, some of which are rather assimilable to divisions 
than to bureaus. It is evident, for instance, that an appropriation of 
$17,000 for international exchanges, or an appropriation of $10,000 for 
an observatory, can not each so well bear the separate provision of a dis- 
bursing officer, a stenographer, and the other like employes, as in the 
case of larger bureaus, but that their limited needs can be better and more 
economically managed by not duplicating such offices. There is, how- 
ever, no practicable way of arranging this in compliance with the pres- 
ent terms of the appropriations, which may be said to tacitly assume 
that each of these bureaus or divisions is thus completely provided for. 

It is in some cases impossible that it should be so without the expen- 
ditnre of greatly more than the appropriated sum, and the terms of the 
appropriations should in the interest of economy, either recognize the 
pro"priety of meeting each bureau's share of these common expenses out 
of each one's appropriation, or else out of a special api^ropriation made 
in their common interest. 

FINANCES. 

The permanent funds of the Institution remain the same as at the 
time of my last report, and are as follows : 

Bequest of Smithson, 1846 $515, 169. 00 

Residuaiy legacy of Smitlison, 1867 26, 210. 63 

Deposits from savings of income, 1867 108, 620. 37 

Bequest of James Hamilton, 1875 1, 000. 00 

Bequest of Simeon Habel, 1880 500. 00 

Deposits from proceeds of sale of bonds, 1881 51, 500. 00 

Gift of Thomas G. Hodgkins, 1891 200,000.00 

Total permaueut fund 903, 000. 00 

This sum of $903,000 is deposited in the Treasury of the United 
States, and by act of Congress bears interest at 6 per cent per annum, 
the interest alone being used in carrying out the aims of the Institution. 

At the beginning of the fiscal year, July 1, 1892, the balance on hand 
was $1:7,875.'J3. Interest on the invested funds, amounting to $54,180, 
was received during the year, which, together with a sum of $3,792.54, 
received from the sale of publications, and from miscellaneous sources, 
made the total receipts $57,972.54. 

The total expenditure during the year was $48,755.05, for the details 
of which reference is made to the report of the executive committee. 
The unexpended balance on June 30, 1893, was $57,092.82, which 
includes the sum of $10,000 referred to in j)revious reports, $5,000 hav- 
ing been received from the estate of Dr. Kidder, and a like sum from 
Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, the latter a gift made i>t'i'SOiuilly to the 
Secretary to promote certain ]3hysical investigations. 



4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

This latter sum was, with the donor's consent, dei)Osited by the Sec- 
retary to the credit of the current funds of the Institution. 

This $10,000 is not, then, a portion of the invested funds, but is hehl 
partly to erect a building- whenever Congress shall provide a site for 
a permanent Astrophysical Observatory, and partly to meet antici- 
pated expenditures in certain investigations. 

This balance also includes the interest accumulated on the Ilodgkins 
donation and on the Hamilton fund, which is awaiting the Eegents' 
disposition, besides certain relatively considerable sums held to meet 
obligations which may be expected to mature as the result of different 
scientific investigations or publications in progress. 

The Institution has been charged with the disbursement, during the 
fiscal year 1892-'93, of the following appropriations: 

For iuternational excliange.s $17, 000 

For North American Ethnology 40, 000 

For U. S. National Museum : 

Preservation of collections 134, 500 

Furniture and fixtures 15, 000 

Heating and lighting 13, 000 

Postage 500 

For National Zoological Park 50, 000 

For Astrophysical Observatory 10, 000 

All vouchers and checks for the disbursements have been examined 
by the executive committee, and the expenditures will be found reported 
in accordance with the provisions of the sundry civil act of October 
2, 1888, in a letter addressed to the Speaker of the House of Eepre- 
senta fives. 

The vouchers for all the expenditures from the Smithsonian fund 
proper have been likewise examined and their correctness certified to 
by the executive committee, whose statement will be i)ublished together 
with the accounts of the funds appropriated by Congress, in that com- 
mittee's report. 

The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, for carrying 
on the Government interests under the charge of the Smithsonian 
Institution, were as follows: 

International exchange $23, 000 

North American Ethnology 50, 000 

National Museum: 

Preservation of collections 180, 000 

Heating and lighting 15, 000 

Furniture and fixtures 30, 000 

Postage 500 

Galleries 8, 000 

National Zoological Park 75, 000 

Astrophysical Observatory 10, 000 

Building, Smithsonian Institution 5,000 

With regard to the general expenditures of the Institution, it may 
be remarked that those for clerical services and for incidental expen- 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5 

ses have for tbe last seven years, owing to increasing economies, been 
diminishing until they are now (considerably less in proportion to the 
amount administered than at any former time. It is doubtful whether 
these economies can be advantageously pushed any further, as it has 
become difficult, with the present force, to keep abreast of the actual 
current demands, and there has been no considerable renewal of the 
perishable furnitures of the building during the jieriod mentioned. It 
seems probable, therefore, that the proportionate cost of these items 
is not likely to be again lower than it is at present. 

BUILDINGS. 

It may perhaps seem superfluous, in consideration of the serious 
reductions that have been made in the appropriations for the (current 
expenses of the Museum, to repeat my recommendation that more 
adequate accommodations should be provided for it by the erection of a 
new and thoroughly fireproof building, but while this is needed for 
many reasons, the repetition is opportune now, since valuable material 
may come to the Museum at tlie close of the World's Columbian Expo- 
sition in Chicago, and because if there are storage and exhibition rooms 
available, many exhil)its*at Chicago may be secured, which it will 
otherwise perhaps be necessary to refuse. 

I must repeat what I have stated in previous reports, that since the 
present Museum building was finished and occupied in 1881, the col- 
lections have increased to such an extent that a new building quite as 
large as the present one could have been advantageously filled, and 
that the need grows yet more pressing. 

The improvement of buildings in the Zoological Park to the limited 
extent that the appropriations allowed, is detailed in the report of the 
acting manager. 

REPAIRS TO THE SMITHS(JNIAN BUILDING. 

A restrictive clause contained in the appropriation of August 30, 
1890, for repairs to the Smithsonian building was removed by a clause 
in the sundry civil act for the year ending June 30, 1894, so that a por- 
tion of tlie amount unexpended became available for making neces- 
sary repairs to the roof of the eastern wing and improving the sanitary 
condition of tlie building, as well as for increasing the space available 
for storing documents and handling the Government exchanges. Tbe 
plumbing in the eastern part of the building has been thoroughly over- 
hauled, and a suite of dark and damp rooms in the basement on the 
south side has been transformed into well-lighted and comfortable 
offices, thus freeing several rooms upon the first floor, needed for other 
purposes, and niaking it possible to handle more expeditiously the 
great number of books passing through the exchange office; though 
even with these new rooms, additional storeroom for the Government 
exchanges will be called for at no distant day. 



6 rp:port of the secretary. 

It may be of iuterest to note that a maik was ])laoed, by my direction, 
at the side of the window of tlie northeast corner room in the base- 
ment of the Smithsonian l)nikling, 31 feet above the .datum phme used 
by the engineer office of the District of Columbia, situated at the cor- 
ner of Fifteenth and P> streets NW., or about 19.87 feet above the 
highest flood marlc recorded, that of June 2, 18S9. 

RESEARCH. 

It appears to be an essential portion of tlie original scheme of the 
government of the Institution that its Secretary should be expected 
to advance knowledge, whether in letters, or in science, by personal 
research; and resolutions of the Regents formally request the Secre- 
tary to continue his investigations in physical science, and to present 
their results fin* publication in the Smithsonian '•Contributions.'' 

The advancement of science through original research at the hands 
of those eminent men, Henry and Baird, the former Secretaries of this 
Institution, is known to all, but th(mgh the Secretary may be still 
expected to personally contribute to the advancement of science, or art, 
or letters, by his individual efforts, it is certain that the increasing 
demands of time for labors of administration^ had greatly limited tlie 
possibility of this, even in the time of Henry, and that at tlie present 
day administrative duties, and especially those connected with the care 
of Government interests, constitute a barrier to such investigations, 
which is all but impassable. 

I have never abandoned, however, the hope to thus continue the tra- 
dition of the Institution and the usage of former Secretaries by person- 
ally contributing, as far as I could, to the objects stated, and I have, 
where administrative duties M'ould i)ermit, continued during the i^res- 
ent year the researches, of which a portion has been published, in 
August, 1891, in a treatise entitled " Experiments in Aerodynamics." 
Interesting results have since been reached here, which ajipear to be of 
wide utilitarian imj)ortance, but though I trust, before the close of 
another year, to be able to make some communication of them to the 
public, they are not yet complete. 

In this same connection, in pursuit of an investigation begun some 
years ago, and in continuation of the Institution's interest in the 
promotion of meteorological studies, I have made experiments upon the 
variations continually going on in the atmosphere, in what is regarded 
for ordinary meteorological purposes as a steady wind. Specially 
light anemometers have been constructed and mounted upon the 
north tower of the Smithsoniau building, and connected with a suit- 
able recording apparatus. The results, which promise conclusions of 
practical importance, are being collated and will be published at a later 
date. I am under obligations to the Chief of the U. S. Weather Bureau 
for the loan of a portion of these anemometers, the others having been 
constructed in the small workshop of the Institution. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 7 

I have continued to give what time and thought I can to investiga- 
tions in astro-physics, which arc so extensive and, I hope, so important, 
as to justify a considerable separate mention under the title, Astro- 
physical Observatory, in the Appendix of this report. 

In what I have said I have principally referred to research in the 
physical sciences, since aid to original research in the biological sci- 
ences has been largely, though indirectly, provided through the 
Institution's connection with the National Museum and otherwise. It 
would, therefore, seem proper that what aid to scientific men can be 
given from the original Smithsonian fund should be principally devoted 
to the physical sciences, which are not otherwise cared for. 

As iu previous years, aid to a limited extent has been given to 
original investigators who are not immediately connected with the 
Institution. Prof. E. W. Morley has continued his determinations of 
the density of oxygen and hydrogen, for which special apparatus has 
been provided by the Institution, 

A paper by Prof. A. A. Michelson, upon the ''Application of interfer- 
ence methods to spectroscopic measurements," with a view to increased 
precision in measuring specific wave-lengths of light, has been published 
in connection with his work upon a universal standard of length. Mr. 
F. L. O. Wadsworth was detached from the Observatory staff, and sent 
(at the expense of the Smithsonian fund) to the Bureau Internationale 
des Poids et Mesures near Paris to assist Prof. Michelson during a stay 
of six weeks iu the preparation of this standard. 

Prof. Holden, the director of the Lick Observatory, Mount Hamilton, 
Cal., is still engaged in lunar photography, for which some occasional 
aid has been given in j)revious years by the Institution. 

The subscription for twenty copies of the Astronomical Journal, 
which are distributed abroad as exchauges of the Institution, has 
been continued. 

In the Astro-physical Observatory the investigations of radiant 
energy alluded to in my i^revious reports have been continued, and 
very interesting results have been obtained. I have referred, on 
another page, somewhat at length to the work of the Observatory, 
and further details are contained in the report in the Appendix. 

The Hodgkins researches have already promised to assume such 
importance that they have also been given a special i)lace upon a 
later page of the present report. 

EXPLORATIONS. 

I am much gratified to report the safe return of Mr. W. W. Rockhill 
from his dangerous journey in Tibet. His explorations have added 
much to our knowledge of these regions, and a portion of the collection 
he has made will eventually be placed in the National Museum. Mr. 
Rockhill is now engaged upon the preparation of a special report of 



8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

Lis journey, which will be published iu the MiscellaDeous Collections 
of the Institution, while a brief popular abstract of his paper is now 
in print and will form a part of the Appendix to the Annual Report of 
the Regents for the year ending June 30, 1892, soon to be issued. 

The principal other explorations of the Institution have been made 
through the Bureau of Ethnology, to the rejiort of whose Director the 
reader is referred. 

PUBLICATIONS. 

Sntithsonian Contributions to Knoiclcdge. — The quarto series of publi- 
cations under this title, inaugurated by the Institution in 1848, has 
always been regarded as the luost important of its issues — not merely by 
priority in date, but as including only memoirs of extended original 
investigations and researches, advancing what are believed to be new 
truths, and constituting therefore positive additions to human knowl- 
edge. 

The hope of its originator — the first Secretary — to be able to send 
forth a quarto volume annually (after the practice of the Royal Society 
of Loudon), has not been realized; partly from the insufticiency of 
material jiresented judged worthy of the position, partly from the cost. 

Volume XXVIII of the "Contributions to Knowledge" has been 
issued during the year, consisting entirely of a memoir entitled " Life 
Histories of North American Birds, with special reference to their 
breeding habits and eggs," by Capt. Charles E. Bendire (U. S. Army, 
retired), honorary curator of the oological collections in the U. S. 
National ]\Iuseum. This somewhat elaborate work is illustrated with 
well-executed chromo-lithographic plates of birds' eggs, representing 
eight families and over 100 different species. It has been received with 
exceptional favor by European as well as by American men of science. 

Another memoir published during the year, Avhich, though brief, 
is regarded as an important scientific " contribution," is a discussion, by 
Prof. A. A. Michelson, of "the application of interference methods to 
spectroscopic measurements," with a view to an increased precision in 
measuring specific wave-lengths of light, which may ultimately be em- 
ployed as fixed standards of comparison for units of linear metrology. 

/Smithsonian Miscellaneous Colleetions. — Of this series two volumes 
have been issued during the year, Volumes xxxiv and xxxvi, the 
former comprising a collection of ten articles i^reviously jniblished 
separately. 

The latter consists of a new bibliography of chemistry for the past 
four hundred years, a work of renmrkable research by Di-. Henry Car- 
rington Bolton, extending to more than 1,200 octavo pages. 

Volume XXXV of this series has not yet beer, completed, though the 
first contribution thereto has been issued, namely, a volume of " Smith- 
sonian meteorological tables" of over 300 pages. It forms the first 
of three projected volumes of tables — (A) meteorological, (B) geograph- 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. , S 

ical, (C) j)liysical — designed to supersede the tables of Dr. Guyot, first 
published by this Institution in 1852, which have had so wide ai>d so 
useful a currency, but which are now so far out of date that it seems 
better to replace than to revise and reprint them. 

SmWisonian Annual Reports. — The report of the U. S. N"ational 
Museum to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution for the year 
ending June 30, 1890, has only been received from the printer this year. 
The Smithsouian Report for the year ending June 30, 1891, as well as the 
Museum Report for the same period, have not yet been received from 
tlie Government Printing Office. 

Iteports of the Bureau of Ethnology. — The Seventh Annual Report of 
the Director of the Bureau of Ethnology to the Secretary of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, jjublished during the year, maintains the usual char- 
acter of excellence. 

LIBRARY. 

The plan detailed in my report for 1887-'88 for increasing the acces- 
sions to the library and for completing the series of scientific journals 
already in possession of the Institution has been continued, with grati- 
fiying results. Since the plan was first put in operation 1,350 new peri- 
odicals have been added to the list and 909 defective series have been 
either completed or filled out as far as the publishers were able to sup- 
ply missing parts. 

The reading room no longer has sufficient accommodations for the 
growing exchanges of the Institution, nor for the persons desiring to 
consult this important collection of current scientific literature. 

Ever since 1890 I have called attention in my reports to the fact that 
the present quarters of the library are insufficient, the natural expan- 
sion of the library having been prevented by the fact that the rooms 
adjacent to it were occupied by the international exchanges. It will 
be possible shortly to assign other quarters to the exchanges, and plans 
have been prepared for book shelves and a gallery in one of the rooms 
made vacant. It is estimated that space will thus be secured for about 
0,000 volumes. 

Mr. John Murdoch, whose resignation as librarian was referred to in 
my last report, was succeeded in charge of the library on Jul}- 16, 1892, 
by Mr. J. Elfreth Watkins. 

Mr. Watkins on October 1, 1892, resigned his position, and on Decem- 
ber 1, 1892, Dr. Cyrus Adler, of the Johns Hopkins University, was 
appointed to fill the vacancy. Dr. Adler's report on the library for the 
year is given in Appendix IV. 

The Institution has possessed for many years a number of costly 
illustrated works of art, engravings and etchings, which were acquired 
by the Regents, by purchase, of the late Mr. Marsh, our minister at 
Rome. These were understood to have been temporarily deposited with 
the Library of Congress for safekeeping in 1871. Some correspondence 



10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

witli regard to them took place between the Secretary and the Librarian 
on May 10 of the present year, from wliich it appears that the bound 
volumes are, in general, accessible, but that a large portion of the un- 
bound engravings which the catalogue — an imperfect one, — appears to 
call for, — can not at present be found, nor is it, indeed (owing to the im- 
perfection of the present catalogue and lists), yet certain that all of these 
were in fact sent to the Library of Congress. 

I mention in connection with the expression of the interest that the 
Institution is intended to take in art, the fact that the Regents, at their 
meeting of October, 1891, having instructed the Secretary to cause 
to be painted a portrait of Mr. Hodgkins, he placed the execution of this 
in the hands of Mr. Eobert Gordon Hardie, whox)roduced (though aided 
only by a photograph and a description given by friends) a portrait of 
Mr. Hodgkins both valuable as a work of art and singularly true as a 
likeness. This was submitted to the Regents at their meeting in Janu- 
ary, and received their general approbation. 

In this same connection it may be observed that the portrait of Henry, 
executed by the Regents' instructions in former years, was sent to 
form a portion of the Smithsonian exhibit at the World's Fair in Chi- 
cago. 

THE HODGKINS FUND. 

As stated in the Secretary's Report for 1892, the gift to the Smith- 
sonian Institution of $200,000 by Mr. Thomas George Hodgkins, of 
Setauket, IST. Y., was formally accepted at a special meeting of the Board 
of Regents on the 21st of October, 1891 . 

On the 23d of the same month Mr. Hodgkins added to his will a 
codicil making the Smithsonian Institution his residuary legatee, but 
the sum thus added to the original gift will not, it is understood, be 
considerable. 

The committee appointed to advise upon matters connected with the 
Hodgkins foundation* submitted the following circular, which was 
approved, and published in March, 1892, and has since then been 
widely distributed, more than 8,000 copies having been sent throughout 
the world to learned institutions and to investigators, and, on request, 
to all expressing themselves interested in the researches which, in 
accordance with the wish of the founder, it is the design to have 
specially furthered by the income from the Hodgkins fund.

CIRCULAR CONCERNING THE HODGKINS FUND PRIZp:S. 

In October, 1891, Thomas George Hodgkins, Esq., of Setauket, N. Y., 
made a donation to the Smithsonian Instit.-tion, the income from a 
part of which was to be devoted " to the increase and diffusion of more

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 11 

exact knowledge in regard to tlie nature and properties of atmospheric 
air in connection with the welfare of man." I 

With the intent of furthering tlie donor's wishes, the Smithsonian 
Institution now announces the following prizes, to be awarded on or 
after July 1, 1804, should satisfactory papers be offered in competition: 

(1) A prize of $10,000 for a treatise embodying- some new and im- 
portant discovery in regard to the nature or properties of atmospheric 
air. These properties may be considered in their bearing upon any or 
all of the sciences, e. g., not only in regard to meteorology, but in con- 
nection with hygiene, or with any department whatever of biological 
or physical knowledge. 

(2) A prize of $2,000 for the most satisfactory essay upon (a) the 
known properties of atmospheric air, considered in their relationshii^s 
to research in every department of natural science, and the importance 
of a study of the atmosphere, considered in view of these relationships; 
{b) the proper direction of future research, in connection with the im- 
perfections of our knowledge of atmospheric air, and of the connections 
of that knowledge with other sciences. 

The essay, as a whole, should tend to indicate the path best calcu- 
lated to lead to worthy results in connection with the future adminis- 
tration of the Hodgkins foundation. 

(3) A prize of $1,000 for the best popular treatise upon atmospheric 
air, its properties and relationships (including those to hygiene, phys- 
ical and mental). This essay need not exceed 20,000 words in length; 
it should be written in simple language, and be suitable for publication 
for popular instruction. 

(4) A medal will be established, under the name of The HoflgTxins 
Medal of the Smithsonian Institution, which will be awarded annually 
or biennially, for important contributions to our knowledge of the na- 
ture and properties of atmospheric air, or for practical applications of 
our existing knowledge of them to the Avelfare of mankind. This medal 
will be of gold, and will be accompanied by a duplicate imi)ression in 
silver or bronze. 

The treatises may be written in English, French, German, or Italian, 
and should be sent to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, 
Washington, before July 1, 1894, except those in competition for the 
first prize, the sending of wliich may be delayed until December 31, 1894. 

The papers will be examined and prizes awarded by a committee to 
be appointed as follows: One member by the Secretary of the Smith- 
sonian Institution; one member by the president of the National Acad- 
emy of Sciences; one by the president j;>-o tempore of the American 
Association for the Advancement of Science; and the committee will 
act together with the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution as mem- 
ber ej; o//fdo. The right is reserved to award no prize if, in the judg- 
ment of the committee, no contribution is offered of sufiflcient merit to 
warrant an award. An advisory committee of not more than three 
European men of science may be added at the discretion of the com- 
mittee of award. 

If no disposition be made of the first prize at thetime now announced 
the Institution may continue it until a later date, should it be made 
evident that important investigations relative to its object are in prog- 
ress, the results of which it is intended to offer in competition for the 
prize. The Smithsonian Institution reserves the right to limit or modify 
the conditions for this prize after December 1, 1S94, should it be found 
necessary. Should any of the minor prizes not be awarded to papers 
sent in before July 1, 1894, the said prizes will be withdrawn from 
competition. 



12 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

A principal motive for offering: these prizes is to call attention to the 
Hodgkius fund and the purposes for which it exists, and accordin«>ly 
this circular is sent to the priiudpal universities, and to all learned 
societies known to the Institution, as w^ell as to rei)resentative men of 
science in every nation. Suggestions and recommendations in regard 
to the most effective application of this fund are invited. 

It is probable that special grants of money may be made to special- 
ists engaged in original investigation upon atmospheric air and its 
properties. Applications for grants of this nature should have the 
indorsement of some recognized academy of sciences or other institu- 
tion of learning, and should be accompanied by evidences of the 
capacity of the applicant in the form of at least one memoir already 
l)ublished by him, based npon original investigation. 

To prevent misapprehension of the founder's wishes it is repeated 
that the discoveries or applications proper to be brought to the con- 
sideration of the committee of award may be in the held of any 
science or any art withont restriction; provided only that they have to 
do with "the nature and properties of atmospheric air in connection 
with the welfare of man." 

Information of any kind desired by persons intending to become 
comi)etitors will be furnished on apidicatior.. 

All communications in regard to the Hodgkins fund, the Hodgkins 
prizes, the Hodgkins medals, and the Hodgkins fund publications, or 
applications for grants of money, should be addressed to S. P. Langley, 
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, U. S. A. 

[SEAL.] S. P. LANCILEY, 

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. 
Washington, March 31, 1893. 

Some desire being expressed for a more explicit declaration of the 
scope of the investigations permitted by the Hodgkins foundation, 
the following supplementary circular was issued in April, 1893, in further 
explanation of the purport of the donor's intentions : 

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. 
HODGKINd PRIZES. 

Washington, April, 1893. 

In answer to inquiries and in further exj^lanation of statements made 
in the Hodgkins circular, it may be added that any branch of natural 
science may offer a subject of discussion for the Hodgkins prizes, where 
this subject is related to the study of the atmosphere in connection 
with the welfare of man. 

Thus, the anthropologist may consider the history of man as affected 
by climate through "the atmosphere; the geologist may study in this 
special connection the crust of the earth, whose constituents and whose 
form are largely modified by atmospheric influences; the botanist, tlie 
atmospheric relations of the life of the plant; the electrician, the atmos- 
pheric electricity; the mathematician and physicist, problems of ai'ro- 
dynamics in their utilitarian application; and so on through the circle 
of the natural sciences, both biological and physical, of which there is 
perhaps not one which is necessarily excluded. 

In explanation of the donor's wishes, which the Institution desires 
scrupulously to observe, it may be added that Mr. Hodgkins illus- 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13 

trated the catliolicity of liis plan by citing tlie experiments of Franklin 
in atmospheric electricity, and the work of the late Panl Bert npon 
the relations of the atmosphere to life, as subjects for research, which, 
in his own view, might bo properly considered in this relationship. 

While the wide range of the subjects which the founder's purpose 
makes admissible can not be too clearly stated, it is equally important 
to emphasize the fact that the prizes in the different classes can be 
awarded only in recognition of distinguished merit. 

S. P. Langley, 

Secretary 

Numerous applications, which are referred to the advisory committee 
for consideration, have already been made for grants from the fund to 
aid original investigations upon the nature of atmospheric air and its 
properties. Two have been approv^ed, a grant of $500 having been 
made to I)r. O. Lummer and Dr. E. Pringsheim, members of the Phy- 
sical Institute of the Berlin University, for researches on the deter- 
mination of an exact measure of the cooling of gases while expanding, 
with a view to revising the value of that most important constant which 
is technically termed the " gamma" function. Drs. Lummer and Pring- 
sheim were recommended for this work by the eminent Professor Dr. H. 
von Ilelmholtz, of Berlin. 

A second grant of |1,000 has been made to Dr. J . S. Billings, U. S. A., 
Army Medical Museum, Washington, and to Dr. Weir Mitchell, of 
I'hiladelphia, for an investigation into the nature of the peculiar sub- 
stances of organic origin contained in the air expired by human beings, 
with a specific reference to the practical application of the results 
obtained to the problem of ventilation for inhabited rooms. 

It is the intention that all applications for special grants shall be 
thoroughly weighed by the committee first appointed, one of whose 
functions it is to advise upon matters of this nature. They will then 
be referred to the second, or committee of adjudication, for final action, 
which shall be reached only after a comparative estimate of the value 
of the researches proposed, and their relation to the object for which 
the Hodgkins fund was established. 

Numerous papers have already been submitted in competition for the 
prizes, all of which will be carefully examined and passed upon by the 
committees before a final decision as to their merit can be reached. 

The Secretary has under advisement the designs for the medal estab- 
lished in connection with the Hodgkins competition, and which it has 
been determined to award annually or biennially. 

The death of Mr. Hodgkins occurred on the 25th of November, 1892, 
when he had reached the age of nearly 90 years. In this event the 
Institution lost not only a generous benefactor but a friend whose 
counsel was rendered valuable by the breadth of his views no less 
than by the earnestness of his purpose to enlarge the domain of prac- 
tical science in its relation to the welfare of man. 



14 REPORT OP THE SECRETARY. 

MISCELLANEOUS. 

The N'aplen table. — lu the spring of 1893 a petition, signed by nearly 
200 working biologists, who represented some eighty universities and 
scientific institutions, was presented to me, asking that a table be 
maintained by the Smithsonian Institution at the Xaples Zoological 
Station, for the benefit of American investigators. 

This step, urged by su large a number of representative scientific 
men, having been duly considered and favorably decided upon, the fol- 
lowing letter was addressed to Dr. C. W. Stiles, of the American Mor- 
phological Society, through whom the petition referred to readied me: 

Smithsonian Institution, 

Washington, April 7, 1893. 

Dear Sir : I liave given careful consideration to the petitions and 
papers presented by you, and I have decided, in behalf of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, to rent a table at the Naples Zoological Station for 
three years, and have already taken steps to secure it. 

I shall be glad to be able to learn the opinions of the representative 
biologists of the United States in regard to the best administration of 
this table, and I shall esteem it a favor if, through your mediation, an 
advisory committee of four persons may be formed, one to be nomi- 
nated by the president of the National Academy of Sciences, one by 
the president of the American Society of Naturalists, one by the presi- 
dent of the Morphological Society, and one by the ])resident of the 
Association of American Anatomists, with the understanding that I 
may, if need arise, feel at liberty to ask their counsel in regard to the 
regulations for the use of the table, or as to the merits of applicants 
for it. 

The table Mill be known as the Smithsonian table. Publications 
resulting from its use will bear the name of the Smithsonian Institution, 
and such of them as are of sufficient im))ortance Mill probably be printed 
in the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge. 

While the exact conditions Mill be determined later, I may say, sub- 
ject to better advices, that it seems to me now that applications for 
the use of the table should be made to the Secretary of the Institution, 
M'ho will lU'obably desire to feel authorized to consult the above-men- 
tioned committee concerning them whenever in his judgment occasion 
arises for doing so. 

If this meets your approval will you kindly communicate to the 
president of each of the societies named my request that he nominate 
a member of the advisory committee in question. 
Very respectfully, yours, 

S. P. Langley, 

Secretarii. 

Dr. C. W. Stiles. 

Four members of an advisory committee were nominated in accord- 
ance Mith my request, as follows: 

Maj. John S. Billings, II. S. A., nominated by Prof. O. C. Marsh, 
])resident of the National Academy of Sciences. 

E. P>. Wilson, PH. D., professor of zoology, Columbia University, 
nominated by Prof. Chittenden, president of the Society of American 
Naturalists. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15 

C. W. Stiles, PH. J)., zoologist, Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. 
Department of Agriculture, nominated by Prof. C. O. Whitman, presi- 
dent of the American Morphological Society. 

John A. Ryder, ph. d., j)rofessor of en. .n-yology, University of 
Pennsylvania, nominated by Prof. Allen, president of the Association 
of American Anatomists. 

These nominations having been approved, I designated Br. J. S. 
Billings, U. S. A., chairman and Dr. C W. Stiles secretary of the com- 
mittee. 

Satisfactory conditions as to the occupancy of the table were arranged 
with Dr. Dohrn, the director of the station at Naples, and the follow- 
ing contract Avas duly signed and completed: i 

[Translatiou.] 
CONTRACT. 

1. The director. Dr. A. Dohrn, places a study table in the laborato- 
ries of the Zoological Station at Naples at the disposition of the Smith- 
sonian Institution under the following conditions and on the terms 
stated in article 11 of this contract : 

2. The table will be prepared for the occupancy of the student desig- 
nated by the Smithsonian Institution within one week from the time 
the administration shall have been advised of his arrival. 

3. The table must be supplied with the objects enumerated below, as 
follows : 

{a) The principal chemical reagents; 

(Z>) Instruments ordinarily needed in anatomy and microscopy; 

(c) Implements for drawing. 
The laboratories Mill be found provided with the more comj)licated 
instruments and apparatus which are commonly used; these, however, 
will be provided only in duplicate or in triplicate, while they are to 
serve for the general use. The station does not provide optical instru- 
ments for the tables, it being understood that those who come there to 
work are to furnish their own. 

4. The table is supplied witha sufficient number of small aquaria with 
flowing water, to serve for any experiments which the student may 
need to make. 

5. The animals which are the object of the research, will be renewed 
as often as possible, and according to the student's needs. It will also 
be practicable to have material prepared and preserved in known ways, 
in order that the studies commenced at Naples may be continued else- 
where. 

6. The great aquarium attached to the Zoological Station will be 
open gratis to the occui)ant of the table, either for his entertainment 
or for his studies upon animal habits. 

7. The library of the Zoological Station is in a hall adjacent to the 
laboratories, and is accessible to the occupant of the table, who may use 
it as a reading or a writing room. 

8. The laboratories will be open at 7 o'clock in the morning in sum- 
mer and 8 o'clock in winter. In exceptional cases, other arrangements 
may be made with the administration, though the emi)]oyes are not 
obliged to open the laboratories before the given hour. From June 20 
to August 20 the laboratories will be closed. 



16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

0. The occupant of the table will have the right to share in the fish- 
ing,' expeditions sent out from the station, as well as to learn the different 
methods in use. 

10. Injuries to the instruments and utensils caused by the occupant 
of the table, will be at the cost of the administration, so long as the 
amount does not exceed 20 francs. 

11. The present contract is for the term of three years, and the 
Smithsonian Institution promises to pay Dr. Anton Dohrn, the Direc- 
tor of the Zoological Station, yearly in advance, the sum of 2,500 francs, 
in gold, for the rent of the table in the laboratories of the Zoological 
Station.

S. P. Langley, 
kSecretarij of the Smithsonian Institution. 
Naples, May 16, 1893. 

Professor Dr. Anton Dohrn, 
Director of the Zoological Station of Naples. 

Numerous applications for the occupancy of the table have been 
received, but at the close of the fiscal year sufficient consideration had 
not been given them to render it possible to make auy definite assign- 
ment. 

With a desire for the information necessary to a right administra- 
tion of the affairs of the table, I have requested that all applications 
shall be accompanied ))y credentials showing the qualifications of the 
candidate to carry on original investigations in some field for which 
especial facilities are offered at the Naples Station. These credentials 
are to be accompanied by a scientific history of the candidate, together 
with a list of such origiiuxl papers as he may have published. 

Those appointed to the table will be expected to make a report at 
the end of their term of occupation, or, in case of a long residence at 
the station, to submit such a report to the Institution every three 
months. 

Seal of the Institution. — It having been found advisable that the 
Institution should have a new seal, a device was prepared by Mr. St. 
Gaudens, the eminent sculptor, whose iiesthetic value, as compared with 
the one it replaced, is incontestable. One of the first uses of this seal 
was to affix it to the circular concerning the Hodgkins gift, which has 
just been referred to. Its use as the seal of the Institution was for- 
mally recognized by the resolution of the Regents of January 25, 1893. 

Lunar photographij. — I have been interested for a considerable time 
in the possibility of preparing a chart of the moon by photography, 
which would enable geologists and selenographers to study its surface 
in their cabinets with all the details before them which astronomers 
have at command in tlu^, use of the most powerful telescopes. 

Such a i)lan would have seemed chimerical a few years ago, and it is 
still surrounded with difficulties, but it is probable that within a com- 
paratively few years it may be successfully carried out. No definite 
scale has been adopted, but it is desirable that the disk thus presented 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 17 

should approximate in size one two- millionth of the lunar diameter; 
but while photographs have been made on this scale, I do not think 
that any of them show detail which may not be given on a smaller one. 

I have been favored with the cooperation and interest in this work 
of the directors of the Harvard College Observatory, of the Lick 
Observatory, and others, who in response to a letter addressed to them 
on February 10, 1893, have obliged me with many valuable sugges- 
tions. This important work is still under advisement. 

Delegates to universities and learned societies. — The Smithsonian 
Institution is not infrequently invited to send representatives to special 
celebrations instituted by learned societies or universities with which it 
is in correspondence both in this country and abroad. Whenever 
practicable, special delegates have been designated by the Secretary to 
represent the Institution on such occasions. 

Dr. James C. Welling, president of the Columbian University and 
Regent of the Smithsonian Institution, who was proceeding abroad as 
a Commissioner of the United States to the Exposition at Madrid in 
1892, was appointed delegate of the Smithsonian Institution to the 
Tercentenary celebration of the founding of Trinity College of the Uni- 
versity of Dublin, which took place on July 5-8, 1892. 

Dr. George Vasey, botanist of the U. S. Department of Agriculture 
and honorary curator of the department of botany in the U. S. 
National IMuseum, represented the Smithsonian Institution and the 
National Museum at the Botanical Congress, Geneva, on the occasion 
of the Columbian festivities, from the 4th to the 12th of September, 1892. 

At the celebration of the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the 
founding of the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia, from 
May 22 to May 26, 1893, the Smithsonian Institution was represented 
by Prof. William C. Winlock. Assistant in charge of ofl&ce; Dr. Goode, 
the Assistant Secretary, having been unable to attend. 

Assignment of Booms. — A room is still reserved in the basement for 
the use of the officers of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey for i^en- 
dulum experiments. 

The American Historical Association. — The annual report of the 
American Historical Association was on February 27, 1893, communi- 
cated to Congress in accordance with the act approved January 4, 1889, 
and the usual public document number of 1,900 copies was ordered 
printed. 

Stereotype plates and cuts. — The collection of stereotype plates of the 
Smithsonian and Museum, and of engravers' wood cuts and process 
plates is now so large that its proper cataloguing and storage has 
called for serious attention. It has always been the policy of the 
Institution to permit the use of these plates by publishers under reason- 
able conditions, and the requests for electrotype copies o' cuts have 
grown more numerous. The original cuts are placed in the hands of 
SM 93 2 



18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

an engraver aucl electrotype copies are furnished at very small cost, 
the expense being met by the aj)plicant. 

Special Smithsonian correspondent in Paris. — M. 0. Eeinwald & Co., 
15 rue des Saiats-Peres, Paris, were designated, on June 6, 1893, as 
special correspondents of the Smithsonian Institutiou, through whom 
commissions can be conveniently attended to. I should add that no 
compensation is attached to this agency. 

Russian Physico- Chemical Society. — I deem it not inappropriate 
to give the following letter received June 29, 1893, from the Eussian 
Physico-Chemical Society : 

St. Petersburg, 3Iay 31, 1892. 
Russian Phyisco- Chemical Society University to the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution at SVashington : 

The universal science reposes on t)ie brotherhood of nations. The 
United States of America in sending bread to the Russian people in 
time of scarcity and need gave the most affecting instance of brotherly 
feeling. The Eussian chemists who devote themselves to the service of 
universal science, at their meeting of the 7/19 of May decided to ask 
their brethren of the Smithsonian Institute, to transmit the expression 
of their sincere thanks to all persons or institutions who contributed 
to the fulfillment of this brotherly aid. 

President D. Mendeleeff. 
Secretary D. Konowalow. 

A copy of this letter was communicated to the chairman of the Eus- 
sian Famine Eelief Committee and to the public ])ress. 

Correspondence. — Minor changes have been made in the methods of 
handling correspondence, with a view to disposing of all letters with 
the greatest dispatch compatible with the character of the work, and 
the number of clerks that can be assigned to such duties. During the 
preceding year a plan was adopted of separating the files in the Secre- 
tary's office according to the different branches of the work, inde- 
pendent files being assigned to the Secretary's correspondence con- 
cerning the Smithsonian routine proper, the observatory, the museum, 
the park, etc.; and with each tile, separate press-copy books. The 
files have been designated as follows : 

1. Smithsonian proper. 

2. The National Museum. 

4. The Bureau of Ethnology. 

5. The Zoological Park. 

6. The Astro-physical Observatory. 
11. Assistant in charge. 

20. Aerodynamics. 

25. Hodgkins fund. 
A card index was begun on January 1, 1893, for both letters received 
and letters written, to facilitate reference to the various files, and this 
index will be extended back to all letters since January 1, 1892, as 
opportunity offers. 



KEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19, 

Each letter of importance is registered as I Lave described in pre- 
vious reports, and its course is traced until it is Anally disposed of. In 
addition to letters registered, many are forwarded directly to tlie 
Museum, the Bureau of Etbnojogy, tlie Zoological Park, the Bureau 
of International Exchanges, etc., for disiJositiou. Many others, con- 
cerning j)ublications, are sent directly to the document room there to be 
filed and accounted for. Eeferring now only to letters that are regis- 
tered in the Secretary's office, 3,184 entries were made for the fiscal 
year 1892-'93. 

A further change in treating correspondence has gradually been 
forced upon the Secretary, and with the object of obviating the neces- 
sity of giving so much of his time to matters of purely clerical routine, 
a decision was finally reached, to delegate authority to the Assistant 
in charge of office, to the acting Curator in charge of the Museum, and 
to the Librarian, to sign routine letters bearing exclusively upon desig- 
nated classes of correspondence. This has relieved the Secretary of 
personally attending to correspondence of this class, without imiiairiug 
his proper supervision of official business. 

THE NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

The Museum of the Smithsonian Institution, the nucleus of which 
was Smithsou's cabinet of minerals, was formed in part, and for a time 
entirely maintained, at the expense of the Smitlison fund. Subse- 
quently, at the bidding of Congress, the Institution assumed charge 
of the so-called "National Cabinet of Curiosities," which included 
the collections of the United States exploring expedition; the collec- 
tions of the National Institute founded in 1840, and numerous other 
objects and collections which had accumulated under the charge of the 
Commissioner of Patents. For thirty-five years these two series of 
collections have been housed and cared for conjointly, and form the 
nucleus of what is now known as the National Museum. 

Each year since 1858 Congress has approi^riated a certain sum of 
money for the maintenance of the National Museum, but up to this 
time it has not made any special provision for the improvement of 
the collections by purchase, while it is becoming evident that those 
received by gift or from other Government sources, though of consider- 
able extentj are of rapidly diminishing consequence, since these things 
are attaining each year a higher and higher market value, and are 
tending to be commanded only by purchase. 

In resi^ect of this provision for purchase, the National Museum stands 
at the foot of all American museums, being surpassed even by every 
municipal museum of note with which I am acquainted.* The disad- 

"^Tlie Amoriciin Museum of Natural History, for example, expended $23,552.89 for 
additions to its natural history collections during 1892, while the National Museum, 
which is of very much wider scope, exj^ended only $5,769.75 during the fiscal year 
1892-'93, for collections of all kinds. 



20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

vantage in which it stands, when compared with what are now its com- 
petitors in the national collections of the leadhig conntries of Europe, 
has grown painfully obvious. Important collections made in this coun- 
try of the objects illustrating the vanishing life of its own native races 
of men and animals— collections which can never be made again, and 
never be replaced — are being permanently withdrawn to enrich the 
museums of Europe. This has already gone so far that it is necessary 
in order to study the past life of our own Mississippi Valley to go to 
England, while for that of southern Alaska wc must go to Berlin, and 
for the Californian coast we must go to Paris, and so on. It is already 
then, in European capitals more than in our own, that we have to go 
for some of the most important studies of our native races; and at the 
present rate, within a few more years, when the American collector 
has nothing more left to gather and to sell abroad, it will be in Europe 
and not in America that the student of past American history must 
seek for nearly everything that most fully illustrates the ancient life 
and peoples of the American continent. 

This is an exceedingly regrettable circumstance and one which I sin- 
cerely hope the National Legislature will be disposed to niodify. I may 
remark in this connection that the National Museum is in danger of 
forfeiting its proper status also on account of the competition of private 
collections. With the increase of wealth in the country the desire for 
the establishment of museums in various cities has been realized 
and the amount spent for objects in many of them is far greater than 
the National Museum has ever had at its disposal. While the National 
Museum has always desired to cooperate fully with private establish- 
ments of like nature, it is felt that the scientific and educational collec- 
tion of the Government should be in nowise inferior. 

During the past year the Museum has been, as hitherto, under the 
charge of Dr. G. Brown Goode, the Assistant Secretary of the Institu- 
tion. Mr. Frederick W. True was designated by me curator-in-charge, 
and has assumed the general management of the. Museum at difierent 
times during the absence of the Assistant Secretary. 

A full report upon the operations of the Museum has been prepared 
by Dr. Goode, and will form a separate volume, of which an abstract 
is given here later. 

The Museum has been engrossed during the year in completing the 
preparations for the exhibits at the World's Columbian Exposition, 
and this work caused the practical suspension of many regular oper- 
ations. The exhibits were ready at the appointed time and were 
installed in the Government building in the Exposition by the curators 
of the Museum, under the (lirecti(ni of the Assistant Secretary, who was 
the representative of the Institution on the Government board. 

A statement regarding the exhil)its of the JMuseum will be found in 
the report of the Assistant Secretary. 

In connection with this work mention sliould be made of the Colum- 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 21 

biaii Historical P^xpositioii held iu Madrid in the fall aud winter of 
1892. This Exposition was a part of the very exteusive celebration of 
the four hundredth anniversary of the sailing- of Columbus, heUl iu the 
various cities of Spain under the direction of the Spanish Government. 
A commission was appointed by the President to represent the United 
States, consisting of Eear Admiral Luce, IT. S. N., Dr. J. C. Welling, 
one of the regents of this Institution,* and Mr. Goode, its Assistant 
Secretary, and a liberal appropriation made for the expenses of trans- 
portation and maintenance of the exhibits. Extensive collections were 
sent by the Smithsonian Institution, taken from its own collections 
and borrowed from its collaborators and correspondents. They were, 
ethnological, archeological, and historical, and were supplemented by 
other collections sent by the University of Pennsylvania, the Bureau 
of American Eepublics, and the Hemenway Expedition. The exhibi- 
tion in Madrid was as a successful one, and the exhibit of the United 
States was highly appreciated by the Spanish Government, and led to 
its extraordinarily generous participation in the subsequent celebra- 
tion iu Chicago. Gold medals were awarded to the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution, to the Museum, and the Bureau of Ethnology. 

The Museum building has been visited by a larger number of persons 
during thepast year than ever before, the total number exceeding 300,000. 
This growing interest iu the collections on the part of the public, is a 
gratifying circumstance, and leads to the belief that the care bestowed 
upon the exhibition series is not unappreciated. 

On account of the crowded condition of the exhibition halls, the 
eftective display of many of the collections of the Museum is prevented. 
The proper lighting of the cases is interfered with and the arrange- 
ment of the specimens is necessarily less systematic than is desirable. 

The Museum has continued to distribute to educational establish- 
ments throughout the country such collections of duplicate natural- 
history specimens as it has been found practicable to prepare. Some- 
what more than 13,000 specimens have been sent out during the year. 
These, however, have been far from sufficient to meet the demands of 
applicants and numerous requests remain unacted upon. I regard 
this distribution of specimens as one of the most imj)ortant operations 
of the Museum, and one on which much more time and money could be 
profitably spent. Witli the resources available it has been impossible 
to prepare collections in more than a few lines, and these have all been 
more or less imperfect. The high schools of the country, to which such 
collections would be of much value, can not at i^resent be supplied. 

My attention has been called by the Assistant Secretary to the inade- 
quate size of the editions of the publications of the Museum. It is not 
at present possible to supply all the larger libraries of the world, and 
the majority of the smaller ones, in many of which they would be of

replaced by Dr. Daniel G. Briuton, of tbc University of Pennsylvania. 



22 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

liigli utility, arc entirely unprovided. Individuals do not receive the 
volumes at all, but only such papers extracted from them as relate to 
the scientific work in which they are immediately concerned. It is 
much to be desired that larger editions should be provided for. 

During the year two volumes of the Proceedings and one complete 
number and parts of another number of the Bulletin were published. 

The Museum has been benefited, as in previous years, by the co- 
operation of the several Departments and Bureaus of the Government. 
Special mention should be made in this connection of the many cour- 
tesies received from the consular service of the Department of State. 
The Quartermaster's Department of the Army has assisted materi- 
ally l)y providing transportation for bulky collections coming to the 
National Museum from remote localities. The Museum has further 
been able to avail itself of the services of officials of the Favy Depart- 
ment, Department of Agriculture, the U. S. Geological Survey, and 
U. S. Fish Commission, who have acted in the cajjacity of honorary 
curators. 

BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY. 

The researches of the Bureau of Ethnology relating to the American 
Indians were continued during the year in accordance with law, under 
the direction of Maj. J. W. Powell, who also directed the work of the 
U. S. Geological Survey. 

As during previous years the work of the Bureau has been con- 
ducted with special reference to the American Indians in their primitive 
condition, with a view of securing the largest j)ossible amount of infor- 
mation, both in the form of records for print and in the form of mate- 
rial objects for preservation and future study in the National Museum, 
Thus extensive collections are made annually, and the value of these 
collections is greatly enhanced by reason of the full notes always pre- 
j)ared and the extended publications sometimes made by the collect- 
ors. 

The non-material collections of data relating directly to the native 
Americans, to the distribution of tribes, to their habits and customs, 
to their arts, languages, institutions, and beliefs, are also abundant 
and, it is believed, of iiermanent value. Detailed information on these 
subjects is published in three series of reports additional to the 
abstracts appearing in the Report of tiie Secretary of the Smithsonian 
Institution. The thirty volumes already i)ublislied form a rich store- 
house of facts relating to our native races. Four volumes were added 
to this library during the year. 

One of the most interesting questions ever raised concerning the 
early ])eoples of this country related to the artificial mounds scattered 
abundantly over the Mississippi Valley and with less abundance over 
most of our territory. Many investigators have given attention to 
these works of a vanished race; and it came to be a general opinion 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23 

that the buihlers of the inoiiii<ls were a distinct people antc-datiii<;- the 
native races found in possession of the hind on the advent of tlie Euro- 
peans. Within the last five years extended surveys of the mound 
territory have been made by collaborators of the Bureau under imme- 
diate instructions from the Director and by Dr. Cyrus Thomas. An 
elaborate report on this subject has been prepared diuing- tlie year 
and is now in press. It is the united opinion of the officers of the 
Bureau that this document contains the solution to the mystery of the 
mounds; very greatly to the surjirise of the investigators who began 
the work, they have been led to believe that the mounds and the art 
jn^oducts contained therein are in no wise distinct from the works of 
the modern Indians, and that the distribution of tribes can now be 
studied from the mounds themselves as well as from other aboriginal 
records. 

The work of the Bureau on Archeology or prehistoric arts has been 
conducted with energy and exceptional success. Until recently many 
of the leading students of American antiquities were Europeans; and 
thus it happened that the classification of American art products was 
to a large extent an imported one, corresponding to foreign generali- 
zations and ideals rather than to any indigenous standard. Thus a 
history of succession of peoples, representing increasing grades of cul- 
ture, has been wrought out. As will be seen from the reports of the 
Director and collaborators of the Bureau, however, an indigenous clas- 
sification has been also developed by it, and it has been shown to be 
l)robable that the objects supposed to represent the series of culture 
stages are in most cases at least the handiwork of single tribes during 
the same epoch. These researches were conducted chiefly by Prof. 
W. H. Holmes, with the assistance of Messrs. Fowke and Dinwiddie. 
If these important results obtain general acceptance, the eftect will be 
to shorten the earlier estimates of the antiquity of man on this conti- 
nent, and in this respect it will be observed that they are coincident 
with those flowing from the mound researches. 

Important investigations concerning the beliefs of the Indians of 
diflerent parts of the country have been conducted during the year, 
notably by Mrs. M. G. Stevenson and Mr. F. H. Gushing among the 
Zuiiis, and Dr. Hoffman among the remnants of the Lake Superior 
tribes. An elaborate memoir by the first-named collaborator was sent 
to press during the year. 

The principal work relating to the sociology or institutions of tlie 
aborigines was that of continuing the preparation of a tribal synonymy 
or dictionary of tribal names, including not only those names applied 
by white men, but the names current among the Indians themselves. 
Connected with this work is a detailed study of the literature relating 
to the Indian languages by Mr. James Constantine Pilling. The results 
of this study form a bibliography which has already come to be recog- 
nized as a standard by the bibliographic students of the world. 



24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

An iui[)()it;iiit line of investigation related to the means of iuterebang- 
ing ideas among our native races, including gesture, speech, aud pic- 
ture writing, as well as spoken language. The primitive modes of 
expression by means of gestures or pantomime and by means of glyphs 
or pictures are held by students as of special interest, in that they repre- 
sent the beginnings ot language. These modes of conveying ideas have 
received much attention by collaborators of the Bureau, notably Col. 
Garrick Mallery. An elaborate memoir on the "Picture writing of the 
American Indians" is incorporated in the tenth annual report of the 
Bureau. This memoir is a practically exhaustive monograph on the 
subject to which it relates; the illustrations, which number nearly 
fourteen hundred, represent the aboriginal picture writing of all por- 
tions of the country with fidelity, while the meauiugs of the glyphs are 
interpreted and discussed in detail in the text. A large body of 
material relating to the sign language of the aborigines has been col- 
lected, and during the year progress was made in arranging this 
material for publication. In no other part of the world have the oppor- 
tunities for collecting detailed information concerning primitive modes 
of exi^ression been so favorable as in North America ; aud it is thought 
that these reports prepared by collaborators of the Bureau, will serve 
at once as a record of past and passing races and a basis for philological 
researches in other countries. 

The spoken languages of various tribes of Indians were studied and 
recorded. One of the most extensive aboriginal linguistic families was 
the Siouan, including the Indians of the northern plains from the Rocky 
Mountains to the Mississippi, and from the Saskatchewan nearly to the 
E/ed River of the South. One of the jmblications of the year was a 
"Dakota-English Dictionary," in which the language of the best-known 
division of the Siouan family is made accessible to students, this work, 
begun by the late Dr. Riggs, being completed by Mr, J. Owen Dorsey, 
a linguist especially familiar with the languages of this stock. The 
dictionary forms a quarto volume of nearly seven hundred pages. The 
language of the Biloxi Indians of Louisiana was also investigated during 
the year by Mr. Dorsey; Dr. Gatschet made a detailed study of the 
Peoria, Shawnee, Arapaho, and Cheyenne languages in Indian Terri- 
tory, the work on the Peoria being complete with respect to both 
vocabulary and grammar. 

The Iroquoian languages also were the subject of study by Mr. J. N. 
B. Hewitt. Unwritten language is one of the most evanescent of human 
characters ; already the languages of many of our native tribes have 
entirely disappeared, save for a few greatly modified terms preserved 
as geographic names; and it seems especially imi^ortant to record the 
rapidly changing native languages thus far remaining. Some of the 
vocabularies and grammars collected by the Bureau were derived from 
half a dozen or fewer individuals who alone represent their tribe; in 
one case (the Chinooken) the language was preserved through infor- 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25 

Illation obtaiiied from the last representative of his people, A large 
jmrt of the j)nblications of the Bureau relate to aboriginal languages; 
yet the more or less fragmentary material, incomplete but constantly 
growing, relating to this subject is still more voluminous; and students 
of linguistics throughout the world are to be congratulated on the 
existence of this rich storehouse of material collected through the labors 
of the Smithsonian Institution and of the Bureau of Ethnology. 

In addition to the researches in field and office several collaborators 
of the Bureau were employed during the closing months of the year in 
preparing an ethnologic exhibit for the World's Columbian Exposition 
at Chicago. This exhibit was completed and installed duly; and it is 
a source of gratification to be able to say that it proves constantly 
attractive to visitors, and it is believed to have been also highly 
instructive. 

The details of the work of the Bureau are set forth in the report of 
the Director, Maj. J. W. Powell, which forms the accompanying Appen- 
dix II. 

SMITHSONIAN INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE. 

The International Exchange Service has always been intimately 
connected with the parent institution, which has until lately aided it 
largely from its private funds, and which still aids it by giving it rooms 
rent free and in other ways. 

It may be said to be at present upon as satisfactory a basis as it seems 
possible to i)lace it with the appropriations that are now made by Congress. 

As an illustration of the extent of this special part of the Institution's 
activities, it may be stated that it has now about 24,000 active corre- 
spondents, of whom 14,000 are in Europe, 200 in Africa, 500 in Australia, 
and about 9,000 in the various countries of the Western Hemisphere. 
In the course of this work the Institution has gathered at Washington 
an immense collection of books, found nowhere else to so great an 
extent, bearing chiefly upon discovery and invention, which, with others, 
now occuj)y nearly 300,000 titles. These are deposited temporarily with 
the National Library at the Capitol. 

The details of the operations of the service are to be found in the 
curator's report appended. Improvements in the service are needed in 
an increase in the clerical force for office work, or rather a return to the 
number employed in 1891-'92. There is need also for securing a more 
prompt dispatch and distribution of packages abroad, which can only 
be brought about by an increase of appropriation. 

The United States Government is under treaty obligation to maintain 
an exchange service with ten foreign countries, and with France, Eng- 
land, and Germany a special exchange arrangement is in existence. In 
the two latter countries, where there are paid agents of the Institution, 
and in other countries where official exchange bureaus have been estab- 
lished the transmission of publications, while somewhat slow, is gene- 
rally efficient. In other cases, however, the present arrangement is by 



26 REPORT OP THE SECRETARY. 

110 means satisfactory, audit seems desirable, either tlirough diplomatic 
chauuels or through a special represeutative of the lustitutiou seut 
abroad, to secure the interest and cooperation of the foreign govern- 
ments and the learned societies where no official exchange bureau has 
been established. 

The greater part of the expense of the service is now met by direct 
appropriation for the purpose by Congress to the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion. A i^art of the expense is also met by appropriations to different 
Government bureaus from their contingent funds, the Eegents of the 
Institution having decided to make a charge to all Government bureaus 
of 5 cents per pound weight for the transmission of their publications 
or for the publications received for them from abroad. 

Special acknowledgments are due to the Treasury Department for 
designating one of its otticers at the New York custom-house to receive 
and transmit to Washington the international exchange cases addressed 
to the Institntion, and I may in this connection again quote the remark 
made by Prof. Henry in his report for 1854 : 

There is, therefore, no port to which the Smithsonian packages are 
shipped where duties are charged on them, a certified invoice of con- 
tents by the Secretary being sufficient to pass them through the custom- 
house free of duty. On the other hand, all packages addressed to the 
Institution arriving at the ports of the United States are admitted 
without detention, duty free. 

By referring to the report of the curator, in the appendix, it will be 
seen that over 100 tons of books passed through the exchange office 
duringthefiscalyear 1892-'03, and while the service is used almostexclu- 
sively for the transmission of printed matter of a scientific nature, nat- 
ural history specimens, having no commercial value, are occasionally 
transmitted under special permission, when they can not be conveniently 
forwarded by the ordinary means of conveyance. 

The expenditures for the year have been $18,518.25, of which $17,000 
were appropriated by Congress, $1,396.61 were paid by Government 
bureaus, $87.35 by State institutions and others, leaving a deficiency 
of $34.26. 

The amount estimated for the exchange bureau for tlie year 1893-'94 
was $23,000, a sum which it was hoped would render it unnecessary to 
call upon the different Government Departments for a part of the 
expense attending the transmission of their publications, and would 
also render it possible to put into effect a second treaty entered into by 
the United States and other countries at the same time as the treaty 
referred to above, by which each country undertook to distribute its 
parliamentary proceedings immediately when issued. On account of a 
lack of appropriations for this purpose no action has yet been taken by 
the United States for carrying out this latter agreement. 

In my report for 1890 I stated that there had been expended from the 
Smithsonian fund for the support of the international exchange sys- 
tem, in the interests and by the authority of the National Government, 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 27 

5,141.01 iu excess of appropriations, advanced from January 1, 1868, 
to June 30, 188G, for the exchange of official Governuient documents, 
and $7,031.81 in excess of appropriations from July 1, 1886, to June 30. 
1889, advanced for the purpose of carrying out a convention entered 
into by the United States, or an aggregate of 145,175.82, which has 
been paid from the private fund of James Smithson, for purely govern- 
mental expenses. This has still to be reimbursed to the Institution. 

A memorandum in regard to the matter was duly transmitted to a 
member of the Board of Regents, in the House of Kepresentatives, for 
the purpose of taking the necessary steps to x)rocure a return by Con- 
gress to the Smithsonian fund of this last-mentioned sum, namely, 
$45,175.82, but I am not aware that action has been taken ui)on it. 

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK. 

It should always be remembered that the establishment* of the 
National Zoological Park resulted largely from a desire to keep from 
extinction species of American animals, several of which are now 
uf)on the point of vanishing from the face of the earth, and will vanish 
forever if something is not done at once to preserve them. 

The paramount need of preserving these races by immediate legis- 
lative action, if they are to be preserved at all, the great and con- 
stantly increasing difficulty of obtaining specimens of some of them, 
the little that is known of their habits, and the impossibility of ever 
learning more, unless some immediate measures are taken to make 
careful observation possible, render it exceedingly desirable that such 
measures should be taken officially, and no more economical or effective 
plan could be devised than that of providing a moderate extent of land, 
near the seat of Government, duly protected and guarded, where such 
animals as could be secured might be kept in a state as near as pos- 
sible to that to which they had been accustomed, and under condi- 
tions where they might be expected to breed, and continue their spe- 
cies, as they are known not to do in ordinary menageries. 

It was not indeed thought that any efficient check could be given 
to the final extinction of these animals solely by such a limited num- 
ber as could be thus preserved, but it was considered that '^Lieir pres- 
ence here at the Capital would be not only usefnl as regarded the num- 
ber saved, but as a constant object lesson, under the eyes of the leg- 
islature, and in this way, a most important adjunct to the larger reser- 
vations like tlie Yellowstone Park ; while it was evident that oppor- 
tunity could thus be afforded to study and observe their habits and 
characteristics, where they were under the eyes of the numerous natu- 
ralists in the Government service, in a more satisfactory manner than 
would be possible in a remote wilderness. 

The act providing for the purchase and creation of the National 
Zoological Park introduced also a subordinate feature, that of the

recreation of the people, but by placing ouc-lialf of the expense of 
pnrcbase and maintenance upon tbe taxpayers of tbe District, Con- 
gress in fact, tliougb presumably not in intent, made tbis subordinate 
feature predominant in a plan wbose inception arose in a simpler and 
more utilitarian idea. 

Tbis i)redoniiuance arose from tbe natural wisb of tbe local taxpayer 
to receive entertainment for bis money and not to si^eud it for objects 
of remote and national importance. Tbis demand must be admitted to 
bave been but reasonable, from tbe point of view of residents of tbe 
District, and it made itself felt tlirougb Congress in many ways, if not 
tbrougb tbe terms of formal legislation. 

Tbose to wbom was delegated tbe i)Ower of carrying out tbe man- 
dates of Congress were tbus confronted by a diftereut task from tbat 
originally contemplated : by one in some way not consonant witb it, and 
by a far more expensive one. In place, for instance, of tbe large inex- 
pensive paddocks for inclosing and sbeltering tbe animals under tbe 
conditions of wild life, and secluding tbem witb tbe aim of enablingtbem 
to increase in the undisturbed letirement necessary, must be substi- 
uted comparatively exi^ensive buildings, witb tbe opposite aim of exliib- 
iting tbe animals obtained. A system of roadways tbat sbould afford tbe 
public access to all parts of tbe park where animals are kept bad to be 
devised, and in ways too numerous for detail tbe necessity was imposed 
of forming the National Zoological Park more on tbe model of an ordi- 
iuary zoological garden than of the first large and simple idea. 

It was impossible to do tbis witbin the sum calculated to carry out 
tbe original plans, but no more bas been granted. What has been 
done bas been done, then, incompletely, though witb an extremely 
economical expenditure, and it is perbaps a matter of congratubition 
tbat it bas been possible to do so nuicb witb so limited an amount. 

The appropriation made for tbe National Zoological Park by the sun- 
dry civil bill passed August 5, 1892, was in tbe following terms: 

For continuing the construction of roads, walks, bridges, water 
sup])ly, sewerage and drainage, and for grading, planting, and other- 
wise improving the grounds, erecting and repairing buildings and 
inclosures for tbe animals, and for administrative purposes, care, sub- 
sistence, and transportation of animals, including salaries and compen- 
sation of all necessary employes, and general incidental expenses not 
otherwise provided for, fifty thousand dollars, one-half of which sum 
shall be paid from tbe revenues of tbe District of Columbia and tbe 
other half from the Treasury of the United States; and a report in 
detail of the expenses of tbe National Zoological Park shall be nuide 
to Congress at tbe beginning of eacb regular session. 

Tbe previous year bad fully demonstrated tbat tbe park successfully 
fulfilled one of tbe purposes for which it was created — tliat of tbe 
'' instruction and recreation of the people." After having done all that 
lay in my power for tbe promotion of the primary objects of tbe j)ark* 

* A full statement of the number and condition of these animals will be found in 
the report of the acting manager. It may be stated here, however, that indigenous 
wild animals constitute at present a large majority of the whole. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29 

it became necessary to further, as far as possible, and in the same con- 
nection, the recreation of the public. To this end, and to that of con- 
venience and safety, the roadways have been widened and extended, 
footways have been placed on the bridge, the access to the principal 
animal house and to the principal outdoor cages has been improved, 
and all inclosures considered unsafe have been properly strengthened 
or defended. 

Since the Eock Creek electric railway has been in operation many 
passengers by that route enter the park by the w^estern entrance upon 
Connecticut avenue extended. More than 2,000 persons have some- 
times entered here during a single day. This has made it necessary to 
extend the main road through the park to that entrance, which has 
been done on the lines indicated by Mr. F. L. Olmsted, and gives a 
driveway through the most beautiful part of the park. The funds at 
the disposal of the j)ark were insufficient to complete this road in a 
permanent manner. As soon as practicable it should be macadamized 
and made equal to the suburban roads with which it communicates. 

It is necessary to emphasize the fact that the number of visitors to 
the park so far exceeds all the earlier calculations that unexpected 
outlays have become necessary. A wider sidewalk of a permanent 
character is needed from the Quarry road entrance to that at Connec- 
ticut avenue. A temporary wooden walk has been i)laced to the ani- 
mal house from the first-named point, but is far too narrow for the 
crowds entering there every Sunday and holiday, while no sidewalk 
exists from the western entrance of the park. 

The bridge near the Quarry road entrance has proved quite insuf- 
ficient for the crowds of carriages and foot passengers tluit throng it 
upon every holiday. It was and still is greatly to be regretted that 
under the actual appropriations a larger and more tasteful structure 
could not have been built at this poiutj it was erected under the neces- 
sity of getting visitors across the river in some way, and is in a form 
entirely unsatisfactory to those who, under such necessity, designed it. 
Some relief has been given during the year by the addition of narrow 
footways on either side of the driveway. These are quite too narrow, 
but are all that the present structure will allow compatible with safety. 
It may be found necessary to build a footbridge at a point higher up 
the stream to somewhat relieve the pressure at this point. 

The addition to the principal animal house mentioned in last year's 
report has been completed and fully occupied. It is merely a frame 
shed built in as cheap a manner as is consistent with safety, and 
warmth, and it appears incongruous when compared with the solid stone 
structure of which it forms an annex. The original design of con- 
structing this entire building of -stone should not be abandoned. It is 
already found to be insufficient for the needs of the park, and must at 
no distant day be further extended. It will be necessary hereafter to 
bear in mind that the cages for animals must be larger and confined 



30 REPOKT OF THE SECRETARY. 

usually to but one side of the building. The throngs of visitors are 
now sometimes so great that it is impossible for them to view the 
animals properly when the cages are small and scattered along both 
sides of a passageway. 

The lack of any provision for the purchase of animals has worked 
serious disadvantage to the collection. Under the most favorable cir- 
cumstances the mortality in a collection of animals confined under 
unnatural conditions is very great, and constant additions must be 
made if its scientiflc value is to be maintained. The park has for the 
last year been forced to depend upon gifts, loans, and collections sent 
from the Yellowstone Park. Gifts have been rare and mostly insig- 
nificant. The animals collected at the Yellowstone Park by direction 
of the honorable the Secretary of the Interior have, while important 
and valuable, cost more for transportation alone than similar animals 
would have cost if purchased of dealers and safely delivered at their 
expense. Various other schemes of collection have been tried, all of 
which have proved more expensive than purchase would have been. 
It is hoped that in time, as the ISTational Zoological Park becomes 
more widely known, the same advantages of cheap purchase will be 
offered to it as are now made use of by dealers; that is, that the ani- 
mals brought in by sailors or captured by hunters will be sent to it at 
low prices. Even now such offers are frequently made, though they 
are necessarily refused, as the appropriation does not allow any pur- 
chases. 

Experience has shown that there should be provision made for a res- 
ident superintendent. At present the entire i)ark and animals are left 
at night in charge of watchmen only. If any exigency arises it must 
wait for morning to bring relief. The isolation of the buildings hous- 
ing the animals, and the distance of the park from town, make it the 
more necessary that there should always be at hand, within call, some 
person of authority to direct in case direction is needed. For this the 
Holt house may be made available. It is in a part of the park reserved 
for administrative iiurposes, and a portion of it now accommodates the 
office. With a small outlay it could be made a suitable dwelling. The 
advantages of such an arrangement are too obvious to be recounted, 
and the effect upon the employes of the constant presence of the super- 
intendent would be very beneficial. 

The number of animals at present in the i)ark is 504. Of these 322 
are native and 182 foreign. In the appendix to this report tables are 
given showing the accessions in detail. 

ASTEO PHYSICAL OBSERVATORY. 

In my report for 1800-'91 reference was made to the circumstances 
which led to the establishment of the astro-pliysical observatory, and 
in that of last year 1 gave a brief description of the general object and 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 31 

scope of such an establishment, touching upon some of the essential 
features of the work which had been undertaken under my direction. 

An explicit description of the specially important investigation which 
has been continued during the last year, and which is now drawing to 
a completion, can not so well be given here as in a later portion of 
the rei^ort to which the reader is referred, but the general object 
of the immediate work is, as has already been stated, the detailed 
investigation of that great spectral region, still nearly unknown, where 
yet the greater portion of the solar energy is known to be displayed; 
or, in other ^rords, of that invisible portion of the solar spectrum which 
lies beyond the limit of the red. 

That the solar spectrum did not cease at the limit of visibility has 
long been known, and the attention of many distinguished physicists 
has been directed to the investigation of this invisible part, Avhose 
presence is manifest neither to the eye nor to any ordinary process of 
photography, but which nevertheless comprises more tban three-fourths 
of the energy which the sun sends to us. Were the range of the human 
eye vastly extended so as to enable us to receive impressions corre- 
sponding in character to the kind of energy which is present in this 
infra-red region we should see in it phenomena of precisely the same 
character as we now see in the limited spectral region to which we are 
physiologically limited. It was probably this idea which led Melloni 
to the use of the term " heat color " to convey to the mind some idea 
of this similarity between the invisible and the ordinary visible spec- 
trum, and this term expresses by the force of association the charac- 
teristics distinguishing one portion of this region from another, char- 
acteristics which, although unrecognized by the eye or by any of our 
senses directly, are yet more striking in their various physical results 
than the various colors which mark out to the eye the great divisions 
of the visible sj)ectrum. 

The invisible spectrum, then, is marked by narrow bands or lines, 
which are almost entirely devoid of energy, quite like those which appear 
in the visible spectrum as black lines and are known as the " Frauenhofer 
lines." It is to the study of these Prauenhofer lines of the visible spec- 
trum, that we owe nearly all those recent advances which have not only 
given us definite information as regards the constitution and nature of 
the heavenly bodies, but have been of immense advantage in the study 
of meteorological and atmospheric phenomena on the earth. The prac- 
tical importance of the study of the character of these lines in the invis- 
ible spectrum (where their intensity and probably their number is far 
greater than in the visible) then is evident. 

Here, however, all ordinary methods of spectroscopic investigation 
fail ; but long since the writer devised a method which has in the course 
of the last two years been perfected to such a degree as to enable us 
to search out the lines in this invisible spectrum and to map them with 



32 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

a degree of accuracy only inferior to tliat whicli can be attained by the 
eye. 

The instrument by which this is accomplished is the bolometer, which, 
as now constructed, is a minute strip of metal barely -^y^ of an inch 
wide, and less than 50-0 o of ^'^ i^^^i thick. Through this frail thread 
of metal a current of electricity is continually kept flowing-. When 
the spectrum, visible or invisible, is thrown upon it, the thread is 
warmed and the current decreased by an amount corresponding to 
the intensity of the effect received, while novel instruments specially 
mounted and constructed, are in electric connection with the thread aud 
now automatically record every minute change in this current. 

With late improvements these instruments are so delicate that a 
change of temperature of one millionth of a degree is readily detected 
nd even measured, and it is easy to see that as a consequence of this 
delicacy the greatest care must be taken in their use. Thus the labora- 
tory must be almost completely darkened, and closed tightly, so as to 
exclude all drafts and to keep it at as nearly a uniform temperature 
as possible, while for other reasons it must be kept under constant 
hygrometric conditions. 

The passage of wagons or carriages in the neighboring streets even 
is liable to cause serious trouble. Hence, the necessity for as complete 
isolation of the laboratory as possible, aud the rigorous exclusion at 
all times of all whose presence is not indispensable. 

In addition to these difficulties there are others of specially trying 
character due to the nature of the work. 

To maintain other necessary conditions, the opening of a door or 
window for purposes of ventilation is forbidden, even in summer, 
although the temperature sometimes rises to 100° and even 110°, ren- 
dering the work of observing in the small, non- ventilated and darkened 
room very trying to the health of the observer. Frequent changes in 
the staff" of the Observatory have been necessary for this and other 
reasons, and the progress of the work has been delayed in consequence. 
In spite of these and other difficulties, most of which are due to the 
very temporary and inefficient nature of the small wooden building 
in which the work is carried on, and its proximity to the traffic-laden 
streets, the expectations of last year have been largely realized, and 
a detailed publication of the work accompanied by charts showing 
several hundred new and before unknown lines, will shortly be issued. 

Important as these results are, they are but the beginning of what 
it may be hoped will be accomj)lished, with proper facilities. 

In view of what has been already accomplished, I hope that Con- 
gress will see fit to make provision for the needs of the Astro-phys- 
ical Observatory in the provision of a suitable site, the money for 
a small permanent building being already available through the pro- 
visions made by friends of the Institution whose contributions for this 
purpose have already been acknowledged.

NEGEOLOGY. 

RANDALL LEE GIBSON. 

Randall Lee Gibson was born at Sirring Hill near Versailles, Ky., 
September 10, 1832; was edncated in Lexington, Ky. ; in Terre Bonne 
Parish, La.; at Yale College, and in tlie law department of the Tnlane 
University of Lonisiaiui. Dnriiig the civil war he commanded a com- 
pany, regiment, brigade, and division in the Confederate army. He was 
a representative in the Forty-fonrtli, Forty-fifth, Forty-sixth, and Forty- 
seventh Congress, and was elected to the Senate in 1883, and his sec- 
ond term as Senator wonld have expired on March 3, 1895. 

Senator Gibson was appointed a Regent of the Smithsonian Institn- 
tion December 19, 1887, and was reappointed March 28, 1889, filling the 
office till his death, on December 15, 1892. His services as a Regent 
were warmly recognized in the memorial and resolntions presented at 
the meeting of the Board on Jannary 25, 1893. 

Senator Gibson bronght to the performance of his duties as Regent a 
rare preparation as student, scholar, and statesman. With inherited 
talents for oratory, and with strong literary tendencies, he was sur- 
rounded in youth by all the influences that direct the energies of a man 
to the public welfare. At Yale College he took a very prominent stand 
in a group noted for talent and enthusiasm. Foreign travel, the study 
of law, the life of a planter, a distinguished military career, and long 
service in the Congress of the United States, filled his capacious mind 
with a store of a rich and varied experience, and trained him for the 
highest duties. Life was to him a consecration to public duty, and the 
performance of that duty his highest felicity. Benevolent, brave, 
patient, prudent, faithful, his grace and gentleness were the rich 
drapery of an inflexible will and tenacious purpose. 

He came to the Smithsonian Institution as a servant animated by the 
fullest sense of his responsibilities and self-pledged to a rigid ])erform- 
ance of them. His interest in the Institution has been limited only by 
the conditions of his i^osition. His death, which occurred at Hot 
Springs, Ark., on December 15, 1892, is a loss to his State and his 
country, in whose councils he has served for eighteen years. 

THOMAS GEORGE HODGKINS. 

Thomas George Hodgkins was born in England in 1803, and his 
early boyhood was spent there. When about 17 years of age, led by 
a youth's love of adventure, as well as by tbe desire to aid his family, 
then in somewhat reduced circumstances, he shipped on one of the 
East India Company's vessels, and made a voyage to the farther east, 
where he narrowly escaped death by shii)wreck. Consequent upon 
this misadventure, came confinement in a hospital in Calcutta for some 
months. During this period of enforced quiet and physical inaction, 
he formed the resolve that his life, if spared, should henceforth be 
devoted to advancing the welfare of his lellow men. 
SM 93 3 



34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

After recovery he returned to Eiigitiiid, where he married. A few 
years hiter he came to the United States, and in 1830 established him- 
self as a manufacturer in New York City. Such success attended his 
business ventures tliat in 1859 he withdrew from active pursuits and 
returned to Europe, where he traveled for some years. His heart, 
however, led him again to this country, Avhich he had chosen as the 
home of his early manhood, and which he now made the abiding place 
of his mature years. In 1873 he bought a country place near the vil- 
lage of Setauket, on Long Island, which he named "Brambletye 
Farm," and which became his home for the remainder of his life. 

Those who had the privilege of a i^ersonal acquaintance with Mr. 
Hodgkins saw in him not only a man of unusual judgment in business 
affairs, of broad and far-reachiug philanthropy, and of deep sincerity 
in his purpose to benefit his fellow-creatures, but they were struck by 
the breadth of his views as expressed in connection with subjects gen- 
erally held to pertain more exclusively to i^urely scientific research, 
every domain of which he gladly sought to make contributory to his 
earnest desire to benefit mankind. 

His life was simple and his wants but few, and requiring only a small 
portion of the products of the home farm for his own use, he pursued 
his long-established habit of systematic benevolence by giving the 
remainder to those around him. 

Fulfilling also the purpose, formed long years before, to further the 
good of mankind by all means at his command, he devoted the greater 
part of his large fortune to various benevolent objects, reserving but a 
comparatively small sum for his own support. 

His symi)athy for the helpless and weak led him to contribute largely 
to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, and 
to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. He 
gave $100,000 to the Eoyal Institution of Great Britain and $200,000 to 
tlie Smithsonian Institution, stipulating that while the latter sum 
should be included with the original Smithson Foundation, that the 
income from one-half of it should be devoted to researches and inves- 
tigations on atmosi)heric air in connection with the welfare of man. 

The death of Mr. Hodgkins occurred at his home in Setauket on the 
25th of November, 1892. Those whose duty it is to carry out the plans 
and to administer the trust laid upon them by the bequest of this man, 
whoso simply and earnestly determined to make the world better by his 
life, are glad to know that he had the satisfaction of living to see, and 
to approve the initiatory steps taken in administering the Hodgkins 
fund of the Smithsonian lustitution. A biography of him, in some 
respects fuller and more personal, will be found in the minutes of the 
Board of Regents for the present year. 
Respectfully submitted, 

S. P. Langley, 
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. 



APPENDIX TO SECRETARY'S REPORT. 



Appendix I. 
THE NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

The detailed report of the Assistant Secretary in charge, upon tlie operations of 
the Museum for the year will be published as Part ii of the Report of the Smith- 
souiau Institution. I shall here speak of only the more imi>ortaut matters. 

Additions to the collections. — The additions to all departments of the Museum dur- 
ing the year number 82,148 s]>ecimens. These were for the most part miscellaneous 
in character, and, while valuable in themselves, did not tend to so large an extent 
to supply gaps in the various series as would be the case were larger funds avail- 
able for purchases. Important collections made by the U. S. Geological Survey, U. 
S. Fish Commission, and several other bureaus of the Government, in connection 
with their regular work, have been transmitted to the Museum. With the care of 
such collections the Mviseum is charged by act of Congress. 

A table showing the number of specimens now in each department of the Museum 
and for each year since 1882 accompanies the report of the Assistant Secretary 
which has been already referred to. 

27(6 scientific staff. — The number of scientific departments in the Museum remains 
the same as last year, and few changes in the personnel have been made. Mr. Fred- 
erick W. True, curator of .mammals, has been designated "Curator-in-charge" and 
acts as the executive officer of the Museum, in the absence of the Assistant Secretary. 

The proportion of honorary curators remains the same as last year. About five- 
sevenths of the departments are presided over by unpaid officers who are officially 
attached to other departments and bureaus of the Government, especially the U. S. 
Geological Survey and the U. S. Fish Commission. This arrangement is in the interest 
of economy, but it is not conducive to tlie general welfare of the Museum that the 
proportion should be so large as at present, since the necessity of devoting most of 
their time to other matters makes it impossible for the honorary curators to advance 
the work of their departments as they could if they were attached to the Museum 
alone. 

Distribution of s^jecimens. — It has for many years been customary to distribute to 
educational establishments, as far as practicable, the duplicate material separated 
from the Museimi collections. This has been possible hitherto, as a part of the 
systematic operations of the ^Inseum, only in the case of fishes, marine invertebrates- 
rocks, minerals, and casts of prehistoric implements, although special collections 
have occasionally been prepared to meet special needs. A large number of sets of 
rocks and minerals have been sent out during the year. During the two decades 
from 1871 to 1890 about 278,000 specimens in all were distributed. The duplicates in 
other departments of the Museum are being arranged in sets lor distribution as fast 
as the facilities at the disposal of the curators permit. 

During the year ending June 30, 1893, the number of specimens sent out in 
exchange or distributed to educational institutions was 13,581. 

Visitors. — The totalnumber of visitf)rs to tlie Smithsonian building during the year 
was 174,188, and to the Museum building 319,930, giving a total of 494,188 jiersons who 

35 



36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

visited the two buildings. Tliis total shows au increase of 109,476 over the previous 
year. 

Fublications. — The Report of the National Museum for 1890 (Part ii of the Smith, 
son ian Report) has been published, and that for 1891 will shortly be issued. The 
report for 1892 is in the hands of the Public Printer. 

Volume XIV of the Proceedings of the Museum has been issued in bound form, and 
all the separate papers composing Volume XV have been received i.nd distributed. 
The mauuscrijit of a number of papers belonging to Volume xvi has also been 
sent to the Public Printer, and several of these were issued in pamphlet form before 
the close of the fiscal year. 

Part F, of Bulletin No. 39, "Directions for collecting and preserving insects," by 
C. V. Riley, and Part G, of the same Bulletin, ''Instructions for collecting mollusks 
and other useful hints for the concliologist," by William H. Dall, and also Bulletin 40, 
"The Published Writings of G.eorge Newbold Lawrence, 1814-1891," by L.S. Foster, 
have been jiublished. Bulletin 41, "The Published Writings of Dr. Charles Girard," 
by G. Brown Goode, and Bulletin 42, "A preliminary descriptive catalogue of the 
systematic collections iu economic geology and metallurgy in the U. S. National 
Museum," by Frederic P. Dewey, were issued during the preceding year. 

The manuscript for Bulletin 43, "A Monograpli of the Bats of North America," by 
Harrison Allen, m. d.. Bulletin 44, "Catalogue of the Lepidopterous Superfamily 
Noctuidic found in Boreal America," by John B. Smith, Bulletin 45, "The Myriapoda 
of North America," by Charles Harvey Bollman, and Bulletin 46, " Monograph of the 
North AmericauProctotrypida'," by William H. Ashmead, has been sent to the Public 
Printer, the illustrations have been engraved, and the text put in type. S]»ecial 
Bulletin No. 1, "Life Histories of North American Birds," by Capt. Charles E. 
Beudire, houorary curator of birds' eggs in the Museum, has been issued. This is 
the first quarto volume published by the Museum. Special Bulletin No. 2, "Oceanic 
Ichthyology," a monograph of the deep sea and pelagic fishes of the world, by G. 
Brown Goode and Tarleton 11. Bean, is in the hands of the Public Printer, and it 
is expected that the volume will be ready for distribution early in the next year. 

The demand for the Museum publications has increased to such an extent that 
many worthy applications are daily refiised. An increase in the allotment for 
printing can uot be too strongly urged, in order that the Museum may be enabled to 
place a full series of its publications in representative libraries in different jiarts of 
each State. If a wider distribution of publications of the Museum were provided 
for, the Museum would undoubtedly receive in exchange the valuable publications 
of many scientific institutions which are at present only meagerly represented in 
its library. 

The World's Columbian Exposition. — On April 25, 1890, an act "to provide for 
celebrating the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America by Christopher 
Columbus by holding an international exhibition of arts, industries, manufactures, 
and the product of the soil, nune, and sea in the city of Chicago, in the State of 
Illinois," was approved by the President of the United States. This act authorized 
the participation of the Executive Departments, the Smithsonian Institution and 
National Museum, and the U. S. Fish Commission in the Exposition. A Gov- 
ernment Board of Control was organized, consisting of representatives of each 
of these Departments. They were appointed by the President of the United States, 
and under their control was placed the preparation, installation, and administration 
of the Government exhibit. Upon my recommendation. Dr. G. Brown Goode, 
Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in charge of the National 
Museum, was appointed Representative of the Smithsonian Institution and National 
Museum . 

As soon as the character and scope of the exhibit had been decided iipon, agents 
were at once instructed to proceed to various localities, with a view to collecting 
material necessary for illustrating the condition of the continent at the time of its 



REPORT OP THE SECRETARY. 37 

discovery by Columbus, and for representing the animal life and the natural 
resources of the country. The work of moiintiug and arranging the specimens Avas 
immediately begun, and continued until the beginning of the present calendar year. 

In February, the first sliipments to Chicago were made. The entire exhibit filled 
twenty-nino cars. On the opening day, May 1, the exhibits were all in place and 
were formally ojiened to the public. 

In the act authorizing the Exposition special provision was made for the con- 
struction of a separate building for the exhibits of the United States Government, at 
a cost of $400,000. About 22,000 square feet of floor space were assigned to the Suuth- 
sonian Institution and National Museum at the south center of the building. 

Before closing these statements I feel it my duty again to allude to the over- 
crowded condition of the halls of the present Museum building. This has been 
temporarily alleviated to some extent by the transmission of a large number of 
specimens from several departments of the Museum to the World's Columbian 
Exposition, but at the close of the Exposition these objects will be returned. Some 
provision must also be made for the objects which were acquired especially for the 
Exposition, as well as for material which will doubtless be presented to the United 
States by foreign governments and jjrivate exhibitors. 

I have already called attention to the large number of specimens, now in the 
storerooms, which have never yet been jirovided for, and which are in danger of 
deteriorating, owing to the impossil)ility of properly caring for them. I am aware 
that the burden of these remarks has become an annual repetition, but I feel it ray 
duty to continue to make these representations until Congress, upon whom the 
responsibility falls, shall erect an additional Museum Iniildiug, or at least fire-j)roof 
storage-sheds. 

I must again call attention to the need of larger appropriations for the current 
work. The number of visitors and the demands of the public are constantly 
increasing, and more money is necessary in order to carry on legitimate work in a bus- 
iness-like and effective manner. The clerical employes are paid less than in the 
Executive Departments, and many of them leave after a short period of service, to 
the serious detriment of tlie Miiseum, which is compelled to train new clerks. 

In the matter of heating and lighting, to which I called special attention in my 
last report, I trust that the full amount asked for, including the cost of new heating 
apparatus, which I have estimated at $4,000, will be allowed by Congress. I may 
add that much sicJiness has occurred during previous winters owing to the impossi- 
bility of keeping all the offices in the building projierly heated with the small 
amount of coal which could be purchased. 



Appendix II. 

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY FOR THE 
YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1893. 

Sir: I have the liouor to submit the following report on the work of the Bm-eaii 
nuder my charge during the liscal year ending June 30, 1893. In recent years the 
researches of the Bureau have been largely topical and carried forward along lines 
representing the chief natural divisions of ethnologic science. The report is arranged 
bv these subjects of investigation. 

PICTOGRAPHY AND SIGN LANGITAGR. 

Researches concerning the pictography and sign language of the native American 
tribes were continued by Col. Garrick Mallery, who spent a part of the year in 
the iield in northern New England and contiguous territory in special work among 
the survivors of the Abnaki, IMicmac, and other Algonquian tribes. The work 
resulted in substantial additions to knowledge of the picture writing aud gesture 
speech among these people. During the greater part of the year Col. Mallery was 
occupied in the office first in preparing and afterward iir revising and correcting 
the proof sheets of his extended report entitled " Picture writing of the Ameri- 
can Indians," which forma the greater part of the tenth annual report of the 
Bureau. This elaborate treatise is a x>ractically exhaustive monograph on the sub- 
ject to which it relates, The plates and text illustrations, which together comjirise 
nearly fourteen hundred figures, were collected with care and represent the aborigi- 
nal pictiu-e writing of all portions of the country with fidelity, while the signifi- 
cance and relations of the glyphs are discussed in detail in the text. 

During the later portion of tlie year, in intervals of the work of proof revising, 
Col. Mallery continued the collection and arrangement of material relating to ^ 'le 
sign language of the American aborigines. A jireliminary treatise on this subject 
was published in one of the early reports of the Bureau; but since that time, partly 
through the stiuuilus to studj- of the habits and customs of our native tribes afibrded 
by that publication, a large amount of additional material has been obtained. It is 
the purpose to collate and discuss this material in a final monograph, which will be, 
it is believed, even more comprehensive than that on pictography, and Col. Mallery 
has "made satisfactory progress in this work. 

Dr. W. .1. Hoffman, who has for some years been associated with the work on pic- 
tography and sign language, was occupied during the greater part of the year in 
collateral researches relating to the ceremonies of a secret society (the " Grand 
Medicine Society") of the Menomoni Indians of Wisconsin. Beginning with the 
study of the pictographs and gestures of these Indians he gradually extended his 
investigations to other characteristics of the tribe, and for three years in succession 
attended the initiation of candidates into their most important secret society, and 
was thus enabled to obtain the archaic linguistic forms used only in the language 
employed in the esoteric ritual. The data collected were subseciuently collated with 
a view to publication. Some attention was also given to linguistic matter, includ- 
ing gesture speed.', collected among the Absaroka Indians in Montana and the Leech 
lake band of Ojibwa Indians in Minnesota.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39 

ARCHEOLOGY. 

Archeologic researches were actively coutinned by Prof. W. H. Holmes, with sev- 
eral collaborators and assistants, in different eastern States and in the interior. The 
work in eastern United States has been notably rich in results of scietititic value. 
Prof. Holmes examined in detail the novacnlite quarries of Arkansas, the pipestone 
quarries of Minnesota, and the ancient copper mines of Isle Royale, Mich. He also 
made important studies at various points in the valleys of Potomac, Genesee, and 
Ohio rivers, and his surveys and examinations in the Delaware valley, particularly 
about Trenton, were especially extended. At the last-named locality advantage 
was taken of the excavation of a broad and deep trench jiarallel with the river front 
at Trenton to study carefully the late glacial gravels commonly supposed to yield 
human relics. I'or a period of six weeks the excellent exposures made in this trench, 
25 to 35 feet deep, were constantly watched by Prof. Holmes and Mr. William Din- 
widdle, AA^ithout, however, the finding of a single artificial object in the previously 
undisturbed gravels. This negative result is believed to be of great importance to 
American archeology. Special examinations, frequently requiring excavations, Avere 
made of the ancient soapstone quarries of the District of Columbia and in Virginia, 
Mr. Dinwiddle and Mr. Gerard Fowke aiding in the Avork; and toward the close of 
the year Mr. De Lancey W. Gill, of the U. S. Geological Survey, Avas detailed to make 
an examination of the ancient mica mines of North Carolina. Valuable collections 
of material representing aljoriginal arts and industries grew out of this work. 

In December Prof. Holmes was placed in charge of the exhibit of the Bureau of 
Ethnology for the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago, and several months 
were occupied mainly in preparing, classifying, lalieling, and arranging the exhibit, 
which includes (1) a series of collectious illustrating aboriginal (luarrying, mining, 
and implement-making industries; (2) various collections of ethnologic material 
made chiefly by collaborators of the Bureau; and (3) a series of life-size figures 
illustrating the domestic life, arts, and industries of the aborigines. It is a pleasure 
to observe that this exhibit attracted great attention among Aisitors to the Fair. 
Messrs. H. W. Henshaw, James Mooney, F. H. Gushing, and Gerard Fowke aided 
in the preparation of this exhibit. 

At intervals throughout the year Prof. Holmes continued researches concerning 
the development of the shaping arts. Hitherto, American archeologists haA'e in 
general been content to accept the classification of prehistoric peojiles into culture 
stages based on the products of art Avork in stone, the classification being derived 
from European studies. During the last decade difi'erent archeologists have deA'oted 
much attention to the deA'elopment of pristine culture as indicated by the artificial 
stone implements, wenpons, and other objects found in many parts of this country, 
and have come to question the applicability of the European classification. While 
the iuA^estigation can not be regarded as complete, it is worthy of note that a large 
body of data has been brought together which seem to afford a basis for an indige- 
nous classification of primitive American art products. This classification AA'ill, it 
is belieA-ed, eA^entually give character to that branch of American archeology which 
deals with art in stone. 

Mr. Cosmos MindelefF continued his study of the Pueblo relics and prepared an 
elaborate treatise on the subject for the press. This work, under the title "Aborig- 
inal Remains in the Valley of the Rio Verde," is now completed and forms part of 
the thirteenth annual i-eport. It illustrates in detail the architecture and A-arious 
industrial arts recorded in the ruined cities of pre-Columbian tribes in the 
SouthAvest. 

In addition to the surveys and researches already noted, Mr. Gerard Fowke was 
employed for several months in archeologic explorations in Ohio. He was able to 
obtain much valuable material. 



40 EEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

INDIAN MOUNDS. 

The researches concerning the aucieut Indian iiionnds distributed over many por- 
tions of the country, particularly the Mississippi A^alley, have l)een continued by 
Dr. Cyrus Thomas. 'J'he chief work during the year has been the preparation of 
matter for publication and the revision of proofs of text and illustrations. The 
principal results of Dr. Thonuis's researches are incorporated in a monograph of over 
700 pages in the eleventh annual report. Several minor papers relating to differ- 
ent classes of articles collected from mounds also are in varion- stages of prepara- 
tion, two being ready for publication. 

In addition to his special work on the Indian inouuds, Dr. Thomas was able to 
devote some time to the study of certain Mexican codices of exceptional archeo- 
logic interest. Considerable progress has l)een made in analyzing the characters of 
the Maya codices, and it is believed that these highly significant inscriptions may 
ultimately be deciphered by means of the methods devised andpnrsued by him. 

No field work was conducted in this branch of the Bureau during the year. 

SOCIOLOGY. 

The Avork on sociology of the American Indians was continued by Mr. H. "W. Hen- 
shaw. The earlier part of the year was spent in collecting sociologic and linguistic 
materials among the Indians of Butte, Mendocino, and San Diego counties, Califor- 
nia. Early in 1893 Mr. Henshaw was unfortunately compelled by ill health to ask 
for indefinite leave of absence. 

Mr. James Mooney spent the greater part of the year in the field collecting infor- 
mation concerning the Sioux ghost dance, and concerning the habits, customs, and 
social relations of the Kiowa and other tribes, visiting the Sioux Indians at Pine 
Ridge, S. Dak., the Shoshoni and northern Arapaho in Wyoming, and the 
Cheyenne, southern Arapahos, Kiowa, Comanche, and associated tribes in Okla- 
homa. In addition to valuable literary material, he made important collections of 
objects representing aboriginal life, including a. series of Kiowa shield models with 
illustrative pictography affording data for a study of primitive heraldry, and three 
important calendar-s. 

In December Mr. INIooucy Avas commissioned to make collections among the Nava- 
jos and Moquis of New Mexico and Arizona for exhibition at the World's Fair. This 
work resulted in a remarkable collection of unique material from two of our most 
interesting native tribes, including the products of industrial arts, costumery, etc., 
as Avell as the photographs and materials needed for preparing and exhibiting a 
series of groups of life-sized figures illustrating domestic life, industries, and cere- 
monies. In addition an unprecedentedly extensive collection of Indian food products 
was obtained for the National Museum. 

LINGUISTICS. 

Linguistic researches were continued by Rev. J. Owen Dorsey, Dr. Albert S. 
Gatschet, and Mr. .1. N. B. Hewitt. Mr. Dorsey continued his investigations in con- 
nection with the report on Indian synonymy, making a thorough study of the 
Catawba tribes and their habitats. He also resumed work on the Biloxi language, 
at first using the material collected during the previous year, arranging the Biloxi 
verbs in fourteen conjugations, making a list of Biloxi onomatopes, and compiling a 
Biloxi-English vocabulary of about two thousand entries together with a catalogue 
of Biloxi roots. For the purpose of carrying this investigation to completion he 
visited Lecompte, La., during the winter and spent two months with the survivors 
of this interesting tribe. In addition he practically finished the Avork of editing 
the manuscript of Riggs, "Dakota Grammar, Tests and Ethnography," which con- 
stitutes Volume IX of the series of Contributions to North American Ethnology. 
Proofs of this work, Avhich is about to leave the press, were revised during the latter 
portion of the year. 
The earlier part of the year was spent by Dr. Gatschet in the study of the Wichita 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 41 

language at the Educational Home for Iniliau boys in Philadelphia. Special atten- 
tion was given to the Wicliita verb, which, like the verb of all tlie Caddoan lan- 
guages, is Jiighly comjilex in its inllectious and in tlie pornmtability of its conso- 
nants. From October 1 up to tlie end of April Mr. Gatschet was occupied in the 
study of the Peoria, Shawnee (or Shawano), Arapaho, and Cheyenne languages in 
Indian Territory. Eight weeks were devoted to the Peoria language, during which 
period over three thousand terms and a corresponding number of phrases and sen- 
tences were collected and revised. This study is deemed of exceptional interest, 
since no texts of the Peoria language are known to have appeared in print. 

The Shawnee was the language next taken up. Assisted in the field by good 
interpreters, Dr. Gatschet obtained copies and reliable material in texts of the 
phraseology and terms of the Shawnee language, a number of verbal and nominal 
paradigms, and a choice selection of instances showingthe multiplicity of duplication. 

Subsequently he took up the Arapaho and Cheyenne languages. Both are nasal- 
izing and are spoken in several dialects differing but little from each other. Ample 
collections were made of lexical and phraseological material, with texts and some 
poetic specimens. The ethnographic study of these genuine prairie Indians is highly 
interesting, since they have had but a few years of intercourse with the white man 
and his civilizing, as well as corrupting, influences. 

Mr. Hewitt continued his work on the Iroquoian languages, with which he is 
thoroughly familiar. He was able to ascertain and formulate the principles or canons 
governing the number, kind, and position of notional stems in symphrases, or word- 
sentences. Six rules are formulated which establish and govern the morphologic 
ground i)lan of words and word-sentences. These are as follows: 

First. The simple or the compound stem of a notional word of a word-sentence 
may not be emjiloyed as an element of discourse without a prefixed simple or com- 
plex personal pronoun, or sign or flexion deuotive of gender, the j^refixion of the 
latter taking place Avith nouns only. 

Second. Only two notional stems may be combined in the same word-sentence, 
and they must belong respectively to difl:erent parts of speech. 

Third. An adjective-stem may not combine with a verb-stem, but it may unite 
with tlie formative tha', to make or cause, or with the inchoative 9. 

Fourth. The stem of a verb or adjective may combine with the stem of a noun, 
and such stem of a verb or adjective must be placed after and never before the noun- 
stem. 

Fifth. A qualificative or other word or element must not be interposed between 
the two combined stems of compound notional words, nor between the simple or 
compound notional stem and its simple or complex pronominal j)refix. 

Sixth. Derivative and formative change may be effected only by the prefixion or 
sufBxion of suitable flexions to the moriihologies fixed by the foregoing rules or 
canons. 

Mr. Hewitt also continued his general study of the Iroquoian languages de- 
scribed in previous reports, and collected additional material relating to the man- 
ners, customs, and history of thelroquis Indians, chiefly by translation and abstrac- 
tion from the Jesuit relations and accounts of the early French explorers. He also 
continued work on the Tuskarora-English dictionary and grammar. 

MYTHOLOGY. 

The researches in mythology, by Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing and Mrs. Matilda 
Coxe Stevenson, were continued throughout the year. Mr. Cushing was occupied 
chiefly in arranging and collating material previously collected, with a Aiew to pub- 
lication. An important result of his work is the demonstration of the fact that the 
mythic concepts, which form so large a part of the intellectual life of primitive 
peoples are greatly modified by the bodily organs and functions exercised in their 
expression. In some cases this relation between organ or function on the one hand 
and concept on the other is so intimate as to justify the ascription of the modern con- 



42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

cept to dual causes, of which the first is intellectual, while the hardly less essential 
second cause is physiologic ; e. g., it may be shown conclusively that the decimal sys- 
tem forming the basis of the arithmetic of certain southwestern tribes is essentially 
indigenous and has grown up through successive generations from counting on the 
fingers iu certain definite ways. This relation between concepts and physiologic 
structure is especially significant in its bearing on the development of primitive 
mythology. 

Mrs. Stevenson was occupied during a part of the year in revising for the press 
her rejiort entitled "The Sia," which forms the leading paper of the twelfth annual 
report of the Bureau, now in the hands of the printer. She was also engaged for 
several months in the preparation of a memoir on the secret societies and ceremo- 
nials of the Zuni Indians. Mrs. Stevenson's researches on these southwestern tribes 
have not only resulted in important contributions to knowledge of the primitive 
beliefs by which the daily life of these peoples was governed, but have also thrown 
light on the migrations and ethnic relations of their ancestors. The monograph on 
this subject, which is illustrated by numerous graphic representations, is approach- 
ing completion. 

BIBLIOGRAPHY. 

The work on bibliography of native American languages was continued by Mr. 
James C. Pilling. Two numbers of the series of bibliographies were issued as 
bulletins of the Bureau during the year, another was sent to press, and a fourth was 
nearly completed in manuscript. The later proofs of the sixth of the series, which 
relates to the Athapascan languages, were revised early in the year. The work 
was subsequently issued as a bulletin of 138 pages, embracing 544 titular entries 
with 4 facsimile reproductions. Although the publication was not distributed 
until spring of the present calendar year, it has already been favorably noticed in 
scientific journals in this and other countries; and the critical reviews show that 
the students of our native languages place this work by Mr. Pilling on the same 
high plane accorded the previous volumes of the series. 

The bibliography of the Chinookan languages (including the Chinook jargon) 
was sent to press in October and proof revision was finished in April. In the com- 
pilation of this bibliography much attention was given to the origin and growth of 
the Chinook jargon, or "trade language," of the northwestern coast, which has 
come to be an international dialect, aff"ording the established means of communica- 
tion between the whites and the several native tribes occupying the region between 
the State of Washington and Alaska, whose languages are many and diverse. 
While this bibliography (the seventh of the series) com^jrises but 94 pages and 
includes only 270 titular entries, it is believed that it will prove no less valuable to 
linguistic students than the earlier numbers, since it is substantially a record of a 
dead language, there being but one man now living who fully understands the 
tongue on which the linguistic relations of the family rest. The edition of this bul- 
letin was delivered by the Public Printer in May. 

The manuscript of the bibliography of the Salishan languages was sent to press 
in March, and proof revision is in progress. This work exceeds in volume the 
Chinookan bibliography, and, like that, deals with the records of one of the highly 
interesting group of native tongues of our Pacific region, which, though doomed 
to early extinction, are among the most im])ortant sources of information concerning 
the development of language. 

Toward the close of the year Mr. Pilling was occupied in preparing for the press 
the bibliography of the Wakashan languages, the ninth number of the series, which 
is now well advanced. 

The value of the several bibliographies has been greatly enhanced, and their prep- 
aration has been materially facilitated through the cooperation of linguistic 
students in ditlerent parts of the country. Special acknowledgments are due Mr. 
Horatio Hale, the well-known philologist, and Mr. J. K. Gill, author of a dictionary

of the Chinook jargon, for aid in the preparation of Chinookan bibliography; and 
Mr. Pilling acknowledges equal obligations to the Rev. Myron Eells and Dr. Franz 
Boas for information concerning the Chinookan and Salishan languages. 

SYKONYMY OF INDIAN TRIBES. 

The preparation of this work, which has engaged the attention of nearly all the 
collaborators of the Bureau at various times, is well advanced. During the year 
Messrs H. W. Heushaw, F. Webb Hodge, James Mooney, and J. Owen Dorsey have 
contributed to the work. The portions of the synonymy relating to the tribes of 
the following stocks are ready for publication: 

Attacapan, Beothukan, Kalapooian, Karankawan, Kusan, Lutuamian, jMuskho- 
gean, Natchesan, Skittagetan, Timuquauan, Tonikan, Uchean, Yakonan, andYuman. 

In addition, the Algouquian and Iroquoian families — two of the largest and most 
important — require comparatively little elaboration by Mr. Mooney (to whom these 
stocks were originally assigned) to make them ready for press. 

When his other duties i>ermitted Mr. Hodge devoted attention to the elaboration 
of material pertaining to the Piman family, as well as that of the Pueblo stocks 
(Zuuiau, Keresan, Tanoan, and the Tusayan division of the Shoshonean). Very 
little work is now required to finally complete for publication the material 
relating to these tribes. In addition, Mr. Hodge introduced into the descriptions 
formerly made of some twenty stocks (principally in California) a large body of 
new material made known by recent investigators. 

PSYCHOLOGY. 

Within recent years it has come to be recognized by many ethnologists that the 
mythic coucepts, and through these the social institutions, of primitive peoples are 
dependent on a limited number of factors, including (1) individual and tribal envi- 
ronment and (2) individual and collective modes and habits of thought. Now the 
first of these factors has received the attention of nearly all investigators, while the 
second has received much less consideration aud is frequently ignored. Accordingly, 
it has been thought desirable to undertake the investigation of intellectual method 
for the purpose of developing the principles of psychology, aud thus affording a more 
definite basis for the researches in mythology and sociology. To this subject the 
Director has devoted a considerable part of the year, and a tentative system of psy- 
chology which will, it is believed, prove a useful guide for further researches has 
been formulated. 

EXPLORATION. 

The Director spent several weeks in ethnologic exploration in the Northern Pacific 
slope. The territory lying between the Sierra Nevada Mountains and the Pacific is 
of exceptional value to ethnologists by reason of the remarkable number of independ- 
ent linguistic stocks crowded into a relatively small area; three-fourths of the dis- 
tinct groups of peoples in this country, aud fully half of all known on the Western 
Hemisphere, are found in this locality. The northern part of the tract has never 
been explored by students; and in the hope of discovering additional stocks among 
the remaining tribes, and in t^ie hope of gaining additional knowledge concerning the 
origin of this remarkable diversity of languages, an exploratory trip was planned. 
The results of the observations are incorporated in reports now in course of iirepara- 
tion for the press. Mr. Henshaw, in southern California, and Mr. Mooney, in the 
northern Rocky Mountain region, also penetrated areas and encountered Indians not 
previously seen by scientific students. 

MISCELLANEOUS WORK. 

As incidentally noted in proceeding paragraphs, much time and thought have 
been given to the installation of an ethnologic exhibit in the World's Columbian 
Exposition at Chicago. This exhibit occupies the southern portion of the Govern- 



44 



REPOET OF THE SECRETARY. 



meut biiildiug. It comprises :i large amount of material of popular as well as sci- 
entific interest, ilerived from various portions of the country, a considerable part 
of tliis material having been collected or prepared especially for the Exposition. 
Most of the collaborators of the Bureau have contributed directly or indirectly to 
this exhibit. 

The work of the modeling department has been continued. The chief work has 
lain in the restoration and repair of models previously constructed and exhibited at 
the expositions in New (Orleans and Madrid. A number of new models and several 
replicas of models already constructed have, however, been executed, chiefly for 
use in the Columbian Exjiosition, 

During the year an exceptional number of applications for definite information 
concerning pur native tribes have been received from the publishers of encyclopedias, 
dictionaries, physical geographies, and other standard works, and in view of the 
educational value of these publications and. the manifest public advantage to be 
gained from the diftusion of the results of the latest scientific researches, it has been 
deemed important to respond to such applications as fully as possible. Much infor- 
mation has been disseminated in this waj' during the year, and several encyclopedia 
articles have been prepared by the director and difterent collaborators of the Bureau. 



ILLUSTRATIONS. 

The woi-k connected with the illustration of reports has been continued under the 
supervision of Mr. DeLancey W. Gill, chief of the division of illustrations of the 
Geological Survey, the actual labor of executing drawings being performed in large 
part by Miss Mary Irvin Wright and Miss Mary M. Mitchell. Most of the work 
done by the former artist is highly elaborate, comprising drawings of pueblo life 
and ceremonials and representations of scenes in the ceremonials of the Sioux 
ghost dance. The chief work of the latter has been the preparation of drawings of 
Indian implements, principally objects of stone. Two hundred and fifty-seven orig- 
inal drawings designed for reproduction by various processes were executed during 
the year. 

One thousand thr*^e hundred and forty-four engraved proofs have been received 
from the Public Printer during the fiscal year and have been examined, revised or 
approved, and returned. Tlie printed editions of all chromolithographs used in the 
publications of the Ibireau have also been examined and the imperfect sheets 
rejected. 

Tlie photographic work of tlie Bui'eau has been ably directed, as in previous years, 
by Mr. .J. K. Ilillers. The following statement includes the work done in the pho- 
tographic laboratory during the year:

KEPOKT OF THE SECRETARY. 



EXPENSES. 

The expense of the Exchuuge Bureau are met iu part by direct appropriation 
l3y Congress and in part by approijriatious made to Government Departments or 
Bureaus, either in tlieir contingent funds or in specific terms for repayment to the 
Smithsonian Institution of a portion of the cost of transportation. In 1878 the Board 
of Regents established a charge of 5 cents per pound weight for the publications 
sent out or received by the various Government bureau.s, this charge being neces- 
sary to prevent an undue tax upon the resources of the Institution, as the appro- 
priafetons made by Congress have uever been sufficient to meet the entire cost of the 
service. For similar reasons it has been found necessary to make a charge of the 
same amount to fftate institutions, and from these a further small sum has been 
received. 

The appropriation made by (Congress for the fiscal year 1892-93 was in the fol- 
lowing terms: "For expenses of the system of international exchanges between the 
United States and foreign countries, under the direction of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution, including salaries or compensation of all necessary employ6s, twelve thou- 
sand dollars," which amount was snpjilemeuted by a deficiency appropriation of 
$5,000. 

The receipts and disbursements by the accounting oflicer of the Smithsonian 
Institution on account of international exchanges, under date of July 1, 1893, cov- 
ering the fiscal year immediately preceding, were as follows:

The foregoing table shows that the entire amount received from Government 
bureaus and other sources was $1,483.99, making the sum practically available for 
the specific purpose of exchanges $18,483.99, while the expenses have amounted to 
$18,518.25, the deficiency of $34.26 being made up from the Smithsonian fund. 

For the year 1892-'93 an estimate for the entire expense of the service of $23,000 
was submitted, this sum being intended to include in a single appropriation various

small items iu different appropriation bills, and also an item of $2,000 to cover the 
expense of an immediate exchange of parliamentary documents with the countries 
entering into the treaty of Brussels in 1886. To this latter treaty for the immediate 
exchange of the Congressional Record no effect has yet been given by reason of 
lack of funds. The amount originally appropriated for the service of the year 
1892-'93 was $12,000, as stated above, and this was su'1>sequently increased by a 
deficiency appropriation of $5,000 upon urgent representation of the need of this 
further amount to carry the work through the year. 

COKRESPONDKNTS. 

The new list of corresponueuts begun upon small ledger cards, January 1, 1892, 
has proved of great convenience, and it is only by introducing labor-saving devices 
in the arrangements for handling the records thab it has been at all possible to meet 
the growth of the service with the smaller clerical force. 

The number of new ledger cards on July 1, 1892, was 9,808, and on June 30, 1893, 
16,340, classified as follows:

1NTEKN.\TI()NAL EXCHANGE OE OFEICIAL IXJCUMENTS. 



Under the treaty of Brussels of 1886, the text of which was given in full in the 
report of the curator of exchanges for 1887-'88, the exchange of the official publi- 
cations of theUnited States Government with other countries has been continued by 
the Institution, and it now forms a very large proiiortiou of the bureau's work. 

The entire nurnber of publications sent abroad during the year under the provision 
of the act of Congress of March 2, 1867, and of the treaty above referred to Avas 
31,850, and there have been received in return 5,196 packages. The United States 
Government Departments have forwarded to their correspondents abroad 16,074 
packages, and have received in return 12,922 packages. The total number of 
exchanges for Government libraries has therefore been 18,118 packages received and 
47,924 packages sent abroad, a total of 66,042 packages, or about 65 per cent of the 
entire number handled. 

The very inadequate return for the great number of documents sent out is in part 
undoubtedly due to the fact that no other country publishes on such a lavish scale 
as our own. Direct solicitation made by a special represeutative to the governments 
with which we are in correspondence would also probablj"^ result in a considerable 
increase to the Library of Congress. 

The exchange on account of Government bureaus is shown in detail in the follow- 
ing table :

KKFICIENCY oK TIIK SKKVICK. 

I beg to call attention to the unsatisfactory state of the exchange rehitions with 
several countries, a condition of affairs which can perhaps in some instances be 
remedied by proper representations through diplomatic channels. The transmission 
of exchanges to Greece has been entirely suspended, a letter having been received 
from the librarian of the United National and University Libraries, formerly acting 
as the medium for distributing publications, requesting that with the exception of 
their own exchanges no further boxes be forwarded, on account of the expense 
attending the distribution of the packages. Correspondence has been opened with 
a view to establishing a new exchange relation, but so far without success. All 
transmissions to Brazil and Chile were for a time suspended, owing to the unsettled 
condition of these countries. With Mexico our exchange relations are also extremely 
unsatisfactory. Correspondents in Nicaragua meet with what would seem to be 
unreasonable delay in receiving packages addressed to them, and I regret to state 
that the Government authorities at Calcutta have declined to receive and dispatch 
packages addressed to other than Government officials. On the other hand, very 
efficient international exchange bureaus are now nnder Government auspices in 
New South Wales and Uruguay. 

Referring to clerical details of the office work, it seems desirable to keep before 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49 

the minds of Smithsouiau correspondouts the system of accoiiuting for the material, 
often of cousiderahle value, that passes through the exchange office. 

Under the name of each individual or society sending or receiving a package 
through the exchange bureau, an account of all such packages is kept, with the date 
of transmission and of acknowledgment. It was found possible to abbreviate some- 
what the records made upon the cards used for the purpose, and a much smaller card 
was brought into use on January 1, 1892, thereby greatly facilitating the work of 
the record room. A further saving was effected by giving the "invoice unmbers" 
only for the packages upon the receipt cards transmitted with the packages, as a 
means of identification. Attention is called by a printed notice upon the outside of 
the package to this invoice number, which must be carefully compared with that 
upon the receipt card, and tlie latter is to be returned promptly. All these receipts 
are carefully arranged and filed. 

Only by such abbreviation of the records was it possible to carry the exchange 
work through the year in the face of a curtailed appropriation by Congress. The 
clerical force was reduced by dropi^ing three clerks and two packers from the roll, 
though at the end of the year, when the deficiency approjiriation became available, 
a part of the force was temporarily restored, to be again reduced when the fiscal year 
closed. 

Notwitlistanding these reductions 4,036 more packages were handled during 1892- 
'93 than in the previous year, and at the end of June only 73 packages remained on 
hand. 

I take much pleasure in bearing witness to the efficiency of the employes in the 
exchange office and in expressing appreciation of their efforts to keep up with the 
added volume of work in spite of the unavoidable reduction in the force to handle 
it, and I beg leave to call to your notice the careful attention to the interests of the 
Institution ou the part of its special agents abroad, Dr. Felix Flugel, inLeijizig, and 
Messrs. William Wesley & Son, in London. 

Grateful acknowledgments are also due to the following transportation compa- 
nies and others for their continued liberality in granting the privilege of free freight 
or in otherwise assisting in the transmission of exchange parcels and boxes, while 
to other firms thanks are due for reduced rates of transportation in consideration of 
the disinterested services of the Institution in the diifusion of knowledge.

Appendix IV. 

REPORT OF THE ACTING MANAGER OF THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL 
PARK FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1893. 

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the 
National Zoolosjieal Park for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893. 

By act of Congress dated August 5, 1892, the sum of $50,000 was appropriated to 
maintain and improve the park. As no provision was made by this act for the pur- 
c]iase of animals, calculations were made as to the cost of maintaining the collection 
already on hand and plans for further improvement were based upon the balance 
then available. The buffalo, elk, and other native Avild animals have naturally 
received the most attention. Effort has been made to place them as far as possible 
in natural conditions by extending tbe paddocks assigned to them. While it has 
not been practicable to give them lai'ge ranges, many acres in extent, as was at 
first intended, since it is now found desirable that they be kept where they can be 
readily viewed by the public, yet the inclosures are of considerable size. The 
accompanying engraving represents a group of buft'alo now in the Park. 

In the preceding year it was necessary to place in the large animal house the 
animals requiring heat, although that house was still in an unfinished state. During 
the present year it has been completed, except the outer cages, and a tile roof 
has been substituted for tbe temporary one. The plans for the house contem- 
plated additions to the main structure, and as more room was urgently needed and 
the available funds were insufficient for a stone addition, a frame extension has been 
built conforming to the original plan in size and form. A row of permanent cages 
occupies either side of this extension and a large tank in the middle of the room 
acconmioihites aquatic aninuils. By this means it has been possible to give the animals 
comfortable and suitable quarters where they can be easily seen by the pulilic. It 
is, however, a matter of great regret that the entire structure was not built of stone 
and nothing but pressing necessity can excuse the erection of the present extension. 

On the meadow upon the right bank of the creek paddocks have been inclosed 
and a small thatched barn built to shelter a small herd of llamas. These animals 
were piirchased last year in South America through the kindness of Col. W. P. 
Tisdel, of the Bureau of American Republics. 

The plan submitted by the landscape architects provided for a large pond for 
waterfowl and other aquatic animals at the bend of the creek below the bridge. 
This pond has been excavated, but fencing and shelters are needed before animals 
can be i)ut in it. 

The principal road through the park was last year completed only to the hill in 
front of the buffalo house. From this point to the park limit, near Connecticut 
Avenue Extended, an old wood road had been used, but it was of too steep a grade. 
A new road has therefore been projected and begun. This road will wind around 
the spurs of the hill sloping downward toward Rock Creek, bringing to Adew some 
of the most beautiful natural scenery of the park, and as it will lead by easy and 
gradual ascent toward the roads that connect the western, entrance with the Wood- 
ley road it can not fail to be a favorite and much frequented drive. 

There is great need of some easier access to the park than now exists. From the

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 55 

Rock Creek Railway at either eud of the park to the auimal house is half a mile, 
and from the Fourteenth street car lino a still greater distance. This is a serious 
inconvenience to many people, particularly the aged and infirm, who have only 
this means of reaching the park. For carriages the Quarry road is far too narrow 
and very steep, the grade being 9 per cent in some places. 

During the year the District authorities improved this road considerablj-, prop- 
erly grading and guttering it and building a suitable sidewalk. While this is a 
great improvement, the grade of the road is such that it can never be suitable for a 
principal avenue of access. It is possible that when the projected improvement of 
Kenesaw avenue is completed that some amelioration of this condition may ensue. 
There seems to be no reason why street cars should not find ready access to the park 
by this route. 

The unexpected number of visitors made it essential to increase the capacity of 
the bridge and to protect foot passengers who use it. Footways have accordingly 
beeu added to the original structure. These are not wide enough to properly accom- 
modate the public, but are as wide as is consistent with the safety of the structure. 

The offices of the park remain in the dilapidated house known as the Holt man- 
sion. When the x)ark was first projected it was expected that the superintendent 
would reside on the xiremises, and this building seemed to offer a suitable residence. 
The experience of the last two years has shown that that plan was a wise one. 
There should undoubtedly be some one always at hand iu the park to respond to 
any calls that may be made in an emergency. Besides this the park is never closed 
to the public, and'it is therefore desirable that the Superintendent should be always 
accessible. During the past year several valuable deer have been attacked by dogs 
during the night and either worried to death or injured so that they had to be 
killed. 

A list of the animals now in the park is herewith submitted, together with state- 
ments of those that have beeu received from various sources. A few animals have 
been presented, among the most notable being two fine wolf-hounds from Southern 
Russia by Mr. Byron G. Daniels, U. S. consul at Hull, England; an alligator over 
10 feet in length by Mr. E. S. Schmidt, of this city, and a black wolf by Mr. R. M. 
Middleton, jr., of South Pittsburg, Tenn. These gifts are properly appreciated, yet 
it is found that increases from such sources cau not be depended on to keep uj) 
the collection. 

From the Yellowstone National Park 17 animals were received. These were kept 
at that park for some time before shipment, and were then transported by freight, 
in charge of a keeper. Unless animals can be obtained in greater numbers it will 
be found that this is a very expensive and precarious method of obtaining them. 

A few animals have beeu loaned, notably a tiger, by Mr. J. T. McCaddon, manager 
of the Adam Forepaugh shows, and a zebu by Mr. A. E. Raudle, of this city. These 
are subject to recall by their owners. Although such animals do not become the 
property of the park, yet an opportunity is afforded of exhibiting them for a con- 
siderable time for the mere expense of their care and feeding. 

The provisions of the appropriation were such that no animals could be purchased 
during the year, and a number of tine opportunities for acquiring specimens was 
thus lost. 

A few animals were born in tlie park, among which were a bison, a deer, two elk, 
and a llama. 

The losses by death have been considerable, amounting to as much as 20 per cent 
of the entire collection. 

The total number of animals now on hand is 504, being an increase of 56 over the 
number on hand at the first of tlie year.

Appendix V. 
ASTRO-PHYSICAL OBSERVATORY. 

At present the astro-pbysical observatory is under the immediate direction of 
the Secretary, but owing to the pressure of other occupations, the conduct of the 
work in detail lias hiiu largely iu the hands of Mr. F. L. O. Wadsworth, who 
received the appointment of senior assistant on October 10, and to whose efficient aid 
the Secretary is jileased to acknowledge: his obligation. 

The general work of the observatory for the year has pertained to the investiga- 
tion of the infra-red portion of the spectrum, briefly referred to last year, and 
described in general in the body of my report. It may conveniently be classified 
under three general heads : 

A. General spectro-bolographic work. 

B. Special spectro-bolographic work. 

C. Instrumental work, including manufacture of new apparatus and the 
perfection of old. 

A. The general holographic work of the year, (which can be carried on only when 
the sky is unobscured by clouds or haze), is summed up as follows:

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 



61 



Complete records of all of these bologriiphic curves have been kept iu the hook 
specially jirovided for that purpose, and from them hy auother automatic process are 
produced the linear spectra of which an illustration follows. As elsewhere stated, 
the result of the year's work has been the discovery and approximate determination 
of position of about 150 or 200 new lines in this hitherto almost unexjjlored region. 

The accompanying illustration of one of the "rock-salt" spectra of the invisible 
spectrum obtained by the new process is intended to give a general, if crude, idea of 
the novelty, the extent, and (it may be hoped) the value, of this field of labor. 

The visible solar spectrum, first investigated by Sir Isaac Kewton, is represented 
as to its length by the blank space on the left; the number .4 (i. e., the part where 
"wave-length is four-tenthd of a micron) and .8 {i. e., the part where wave-length is 
eighth-tenths of a micron) representing the extremities of the solar spectrum as 
known to him. 

Below this all is invisible, and the investigations made at this Observatory by the 
novel bolometric methods here referred to have been chiefly instrumental in carrying 
the mapping of lines to 6.0 (six microns), or through nearly thirteen times the extent 
known to Newton. Tlie great majority of all the lines which till this space have 
been discovered and laid down by the new bolometric method, and most of them 
here in Washington during the last two years. 

B. The special holographic work, which is carried on during the cloudy weather, 
during which the regular work is necessarily interrupted, includes the classification, 
detailed examination, and, finally, the reduction of the holographs taken to linear 
representatives of the infra-red spectrum, in which the final result is a line photo- 
graph which is precisely similar, as far as automatic reduction processes will admit, 
to the line spectrum photographs of the visible part of the sjiectrum. Owing to the 
labor involved in this reduction it has been deemed desirable to apply this process 
of reduction only to the best of the holographs taken. The result of this portion of 
the work is briefly summed up as follows:

REPOET OF THE SECRETARY. 




REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 63 

While this number seems small in comparison with the whole number of holo- 
graphs taken, it nevertheless represents even more work. In this particular work 
the history of the year is one of continual change and imjirovement and many of 
the holographs of the earlier part of the year have been reduced by three different 
processes, each of which involves three distinct photographic stojis, and in conse- 
quence the 39 linal line spectrum photographs stand for more than 200 finished 
photographs, and as many more Avhich arc experimental. 

After a large amount of exi^erimeutal work, a jirocess has finally been perfected 
which is fairly satisfactory^, and has been adopted provisionally as a working 
method. Experiments, however, are still in progress with a view to further modifi- 
cation and improvement. 

In addition to this bolometric work projier, experiments on three special methods 
of investigation of the iufra-re<l spectrum, have formed a considerable portion of 
the year's work : 

(1) Preliminary experiments on the measurement of wave-lengths in the invisible 
spectrum by interference methods. 

(2) Experimeuts on i^hotographiug the invisible spectrum by the aid of phos- 
phorescent films. 

(3) Preliminary experiments on bolometric investigation of the infra-red normal 
(grating) spectrum. 

I. Daring the month of .July, 1892, a series of 2>reliminary experiments was made 
on a method of measurement of Avave-lengths in the invisible spectrum, with special 
reference to the establishment of a few datum ijoints with great accuracy. The 
apparatus employed for this purpose, which was kindly lent by Clark University, 
was a modification of the inferential wave comparer used with so much success by 
Prof. Michelson, in the establishment of a wave-length standard. 

As the method of working was entirely new, considerable time was required to 
put the apparatus in working order. Some preliminary results were obtained in 
the region just above "A," by Mr. Wadsworth, in whose hands I placed it, but the 
work was interrupted by his departure for Paris, and has not since been resumisd. 
The accuracy and practical)ility of this method of determining wave-lengths has, 
however, been demonstrated, and it is hojied time will be found in the near future 
to continue this work. 

II. During the month of October I made a number of exjieriments to determine 
the practicability of i^hotographing the inlra-red spectrum directly with the aid of 
phosporescent films. 

After considerable experimentation on the best method of working, a number of 
photographs of the invisible portion of the spectnun extending as far as wave-length 
1"5 fj. were thus obtained. Although the detail is very much less than that obtained 
by the bolometer, the method is valuable in furnishing a general check on the 
results of the more analytical method. With greater care in the preparation of 
films, still lietter resnls could be obtained. Otlier films sensitive to heat rays were 
tried, particularly those containing a salt of mercury, but without adequate results. 
. III. During the winter months of January and February, in which regular bolo- 
metric work Avas almost entirely interrupted Ijy bad weather, attention was devoted 
to the theoretical investigation of a method of bolometrically investigating the nor- 
mal grating spectrum, the essential feature of which was the employment of a 
"lifting" prism, by the use of which the superposed spectra were to be avoided. 

After determination of the best instrumental conditions, provisional apparatus 
was constructed and installed, and a few experimental holographs taken. The 
approach of good observing weather then necessitated its removal. A paper 
describing the method and containing the essential results of the investigation of 
the instrumental conditions has been prepared for publication. 

C. What might almost be said to have been the chief work of the Observatory for 
the year has been the improvement of the apparatus and instrumental conditions 
of working.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 



The lines of development have been: (1) In the increase of delicacy; (2) in the 
increase of stability and accuracy. 

With a view to increased delicacy much time has been devoted through the year 
to the improvement of the galvanometer. 

During the absence in Europe of the present senior assistant, he, by my direction, 
devoted two weeks exclusively to this work, and the elements of three galvanometers 
were constructed after his design, two by Nalder Bros, and one by Elliott Bros. 
After his return, the work of improvement of my earlier designs for the old galvau- 
ometer and of the new ones was at once begun. Pending the completion of the new 
galvanometers, the improvement of the three old ones already in use was undertaken, 
and the delicacy of each was more than doulded. Up to date only one of the new 
galvanometers has been comjjleted, and this owing to the introduction of an almost 
unprecedentedly light, magnetic system, and through other improvements, has been 
found to be about 35 times more delicate than the best of these previously in use. 

This degree of delicacy will, it is probable, be exceeded by one of the two remain- 
ing forms, but lack of time has prevented further improvement at present. Indeed 
the conditions of use at present are such as to render only about one-tenth of this 
increased delicacy available, and only a new laboratory will enable the full increase 
of delicacy to be perfectly utilized. 

An abbreviateil statement of the galv^anometer work for the year is appended:

vitration is 10 seoon<ls. 
t Partially finished. 

For use in these new galvanometers, the laboratory has received during the year, 
alot of very tine (quartz fibers, made to special order by Prof. C. C. Hutchins, and 
some very small, light, and accurate concave mirrors from ,T. A. Brashear, the use of 
which in the new galvanometer bas been already referred to. A very considerable 
improvement in the mechanical steadiness of this part of the apparatus has also been 
effected by mounting the whole galvanometer in a massive metal case, which rests 
on a series of stone blocks placed one above another and separated from each other 
by sheets of rubber. In spite of these precautious, the vibrations due to passing 
teams and wagons are at tipies still very troublesome. 

(2) The improvement in the other parts of the apparatus has been mainly in the 
direction of increased accuracy. The siderostat has been provided with a new elec- 
tric control, by means of which inaccuracies of runuing may be quickly compensated 
for from inside the building. Considerable imiirovement has also been eft'ectcd in 
the minor parts of the instrument, but it still needs to be thoroughly overhauled. 
The changes for "which there is most pressing need are the renjounting of the 
equatorial axis on ball bearings and the construction of a new governor for the clock. 

The spectro-bolometer and its accessories is that part of the train of apparatus 
which has undergone the most radical change. The principal changes which have 
been made in its construction and working during the past year are : 

(1) The adoption of a reflecting mirror secured to the prism and revolving with 
it, which has rendered it possible to fix both the spectro-bolometer slit and the 
bolometer itself in position, thereby avoiding the use of a long revolving arm. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 65 

This device jiermits of indefinite extension of the bolometer arm, and consequently 
the reduction of the angular vahie of the bolometer strip to a very minute quantity. 

(2) The provision of a new adjustable tangent arm for slowly rotating the axis 
of the spectro-bolometer with great accuracy. 

(3) The adoption of a new system of clock-work for synchronously driving this 
tangent arm, and the photographic plate on which the galvanometer record is 
taken, in place of the two independent driving clocks before used. 

(4) The mounting of all parts of the spectro-bolometer on rigid iron or stoue 
supports. 

The improvements in the method of working which have accompanied these 
improvements in apparatus are : 

(1) The substitiitiou of glass plates for flexible films for the photographic records. 
The irregular errors due to shrinkage of the film have thus been eliminated and the 
subsequent iihotographic processes rendered much easier by reason of the greater 
facility of handling. 

(2) The reduction, and in some cases almost entire elimination, of the "drift" by 
the use of a water-jacket about the fixed bolometer case, together with cai'eful 
attention to all the electrical details of the bolometer and galvanometer connections, 
and the substitution of storage battery cells for the Daniel cells, formerly used to 
supply the current to the bridge circuit. The " drift," however, still remains a 
source of great trouble and I expect to secure its elimination only (if at all) by the 
establishment of uniform temperature conditions, which it is impossible to obtain in 
the present laboratory (at least during the summer months). 

The laboratory building itself has been considerably improved during the past 
year. A small annex, which is used as a photographic dark room, was erected in 
the spring of 1893, and has greatly facilitated the photographic work of the obser- 
vatory. During the summer a small air-cooling plant was placed in the basement, 
and served not only to increase the comfort of the observers, bat also to secure 
more favorable conditions for the work then being carried on with rock salt. 

During the past year the observatory also fitted up a small Instrument shop for 
the construction and repair of its apparatus, comprising an instrument-maker's 
lathe, built to my special order, a small planer from the Hendley Machine Company, 
and a fairly complete stock of small tools, and stock material. A dynamo, for sup- 
plying current to the observatory for charging the storage batteries and to the shop 
for power purposes, was also purchased and temporarily placed in the National 
Museum. Owing to the lack of suitable quarters the shoi^ has not yet been perma- 
nently located, but occupies a temporary shed south of the Smithsonian building. 

The important pieces of apparatus acquired during the year may be divided into 
two general classes : (1) Physical apparatus of precision; (2) accessory apparatus. 

I. To the former class belongs : 

(1) Three new galvanometers and sets of galvanometer coils from Elliott 

Brothers and Nalder Brothers. 

(2) Resistance boxes one of 100,000 ohms and one of 1,000 ohms from Nalder 

Brothers. 

(3) A set of fine quartz fibers, from Prof. C. C. Hutchins. 

(4) Six fine galvanometer mirrors, from J. A. Brashear. 

(5) One large glass jirism, from J. A. Brashear. 

(6) Two large glass lenses, from J. A. Brashear. 

(7) Two new large rock salt lenses, from M. E. Kahler. 

(8) A collection of valuable rock salt crystals, from Germany. 

(9) Three new vVmilometer bolometers, from Grunow. 

(10) One large 24-inch camera, a fine Ross lens, and a complete photographic 

outfit, from Scoville »&. Co. 

(11) A new tangent arm for spectro-bolometer, from .J. A. Brashear. 

(12) A new prism holder, with large glass flat, from J. A. Brashear.

6Q REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

II. Accessory apparatus : 

(1) A complete iustrumeut-maker's lathe, -with outfit of tools and chucks. 

(2) A 30-incli hand and power planer for metal work, witli chuck, etc., from 

the Hendley Machine Comjiany. 

(3) A 40-light incandescent dynamo, "with rheostats, etc., from Westing- 

house Electric Company. 

(4) A one-half horse power motor, from Akron Electric Company. 

(5) A one-fourth horse-power water motor and Sturtevant jiressuro fan, with 

accessory apparatus for cooling the air of the Observatory. 
The total value of the apparatus purchased during the year was about $3,000. 

MINOR WORK OF THE YEAR. 

In addition to Mr. Wadsworth's work with Prof. Michelson in the establishment 
of the length of the standard meter in terms of tlie wave length of light, at the 
International Bureau of Weights and Measures, reference to which has already been 
made, the following special work, which has been done during the year, may be 
mentioned: 

(1) The preparation of a complete series of line-shaded drawings of the principal 
pieces of apparatus in the observatory on a scale requisite to show their detailed 
construction. 

(2) The preparation of a series of enlargements of moon jihotographs from the 
Kenwood and Lick observatories, photographs. 

(3) Experiments in temperature and radiation work. 

During tlie latter part of the year preliminary experiments were begun and carried 
on at intervals looking to the systematic preparation for another extended research, 
which I have proposed to soon begin to determine the physical relation between 
temperature and radiation. Tlie experiments have mostly. been directed to the 
establishment of a satisfactory source of temperature and nieaus of measuring the 
same. The various apparatus, etc., for the prosecution of this work at an early date 
has either been ordered or already installed. 

(4) Some further attempts have been made at solar pliotography, but, as the 
experience of last year conclusively showed, the atmospheric conditions here in the 
city are very unfavorable to any satisfactory work in this direction. 

PERSONNEL. 

The force of the Observatory consists of a Senior assistant, and an iustrument- 
malvcr, and an assistant instrument-maker. During the past year the Observatory 
has also had at different times special assistants, among whom I wish to acknowl- 
edge the assistance of Mr. J. G. Hubbard, to whose photographic skill several 
improvements of this jiart of the work are due. 



Appendix VI. 



REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1893. 

Sir: I have the houor to submit herewith a. report upon the operations of the 
library of the Smithsonian Institution during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893. 

The work of recording accessions has been conducted as in the preceding years. 
The entry numbers in the accession book extend from 246, 110 to 268, 386. 

The following table shows the number of volumes, parts of volumes, pamphlets, 
and charts received during the year : 

Publications received between July 1, 1S02, and June SO, 1S03.

Of these publications, 272 volumes, 6,981 parts of volumes, and 821 pamphlets, 
8,074 in all, were retained for use in the U. S. National Museum. 

Nine hundred and sixty-three medical dissertations were deposited in' the library 
of the Surgeon-General U. S. Army; the remaining publications were sent to the 
Library of Congress on the Monday after their receipt. 

In carrying out the plan formulated by the Secretary for increasing the library 
by exchanges, 781 letters asking for publications not on our list, or asking-for num- 
bers to complete the series already in the library, have been written. It gives me 
pleasure to report that as a result of this ccjrrespondence 246 new exchanges were 
acquired by the Institution, while 81 defective series were completed, either whollj'^ 
or as far as the publishers were able to supply missing parts. 

Since this plan of the Secretary was first formulated in 1887, 4,512 letters have 
been written with a view of increasing the number of periodicals and transactions 
of learned societies in the library of the Smithsonian Institution. The result of 
this work has been most gratifying; 1,350 new periodicals have been added to the 
list and 909 defective series have been either completed or filled out as far as the 
publishers were able to supply missing parts. 

The reading room is now taxed to its utmost capacity ; the 494 boxes for the use 
o^ scientific periodical literature are all filled and periodicals which it would be 
desirable to keep in the general reading room must be placed elsewhere for lack of 
space. The reading room no longer has sufftciont accommodations for the growing 
exchanges of the Institution nor for the x)ersons desiring to consult this important 
collection of current scientific literature. 

Ever since 1890 the Secretary has called attention in his annual report to the fact 
that the present quarters of the library are insufficient; the natural expansion of 
the library has been prevented by the fact that the rooms adjacent to the library 
were occupied by the bureau of international exchanges. It will be possible shortly 
to assign other quarters to the bureau of international exchanges, and plans have 
been prepared for book shelves in one of the roomc: made vacant. It is estimated 
that space will thus be secured for about 6,000 volumes. 

In addition to the strictly scientific literr^ture A.hich is contained in the reading

eiiiployt^s of the Institution and the Is'ational Museum is constantly increasing.

1890:

It will be observed that this comparative table shows a slight decrease in the 
number of publications received during the current year over the preceding year. 
The decrease, however, is in volumes, and is due to the fact that the limit of the 
possibility of comjileting series of publications by exchange, seems to have been 
reached. 

The number of titles for the past year shows an increase of almost 2,000 over that 
of the year preceding. 

The following table shows the number of titles received per year for the past six 
years : 

Niimher of titles received.

1890-'91 18, 409 

1891-'92 20,523 

1892-'93 22,276 

It will be seen from the above table that the number of titles received by the 
library has almost doubled since 1887, a gratifying fact, yet one which severely 
taxes the library force in tlie recording and arrangement of the material received. 

No fewer than 4,087 acknowledgments of publications were made by the post card 
and other printed forms, while many gifts were acknowledged by special letter. 

Tlio following universities have sent complete sets of their academic publications, 
Lncludiug inaugural dissertations : 

Basel, Greifswald, Louvaiu, 

Berlin, Halle, A. S., Lund, 

Beru, Heidelburg, Marburg,

Erlaugen, Kiel, Wurzburg, 

Freiburg, Br., Kiinigsberg, Zurich. 

Giessen, Leipzig, 

On July 1, 1892, Mr. J. Ellreth Watkius was ap])ointed Assistant in charge of the 
library, a position which he held until the first of October. From that date until 
December 1, Mr. N. P. Scudder was acting Librarian. 
Very respectfully, yours,

GENERAL APPENDIX 



TO THE 



SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 181)-' 



71 



ADVERTISEMENT. 



The object of tbe General Appendix to the Annual Report of the 
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific discov- 
ery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by collab- 
orators of the Institution; and memoirs of a geueral character or on 
special toi:>ics that are of interest or value to the numerous correspond 
ents of the Institution. 

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual report 
required of them by law, with memoirs illustrating the more remarka 
ble and important developments in physical and biological discovery, 
as well as showing the general character of the operations of the Insti- 
tution ; and this purpose has, during the greater part of its history, been 
carried out largely by the publication of such papers as would possess 
an interest to all attracted by scientific progress. 

In ISSO the Secretary, induced in part by the discontinuance of an 
annual summary of progress which lor thirty years previous had been 
issued by well-known private publishing firms, had prepared by com- 
petent collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the promi- 
nent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology, meteor- 
ology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and anthropol- 
ogy. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether satisfac- 
torily, down to and including the year 1888. 

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of 
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original) 
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus- 
sion. This method has been continued in the present report, for 181)3.

THE WANDERINGS OF TPIE NOETn POLE.* 



By Sir Robert Ball, F. R. S. 



On a recent visit to Cambridge, Prof, Barnard, the discoverer of tlie 
liftli .satellite of Jupiter, exhibited at the Cavendish Laboratory his most 
interesting- collection of pliotographs ma<le at the Lick Observatory. 
These pictures were obtained by a 6-inch photographic lens of 3 feet 
focus, attached to an ordinary equatorial, the telescope of which was 
used as a guider when it was desired to obtain a picture of the stars 
with a long exposure. Among the advantages of this jirocess may be 
reckoned the large field that is thereby obtained, many of the plates that 
he exhibited being as mucli as 4 degrees on the edge. I am however 
not now going to speak of Barnard's marvellous views of the milky way, 
nor of the plate on which a comet was discovered, nor of the vicissitudes 
of Holmes's comet, nor of that wonderful picture in which Swift's comet 
actually appears to l)e producing, by a process of gemmation, an off- 
shoot which is evidently adapted for an independent cojuetary exist- 
ence. The picture to which I wish specially to refer in connection with 
our immediate subject is one in which the instrument was directed 
towards the celestial pole. In this particular case the clock-work which 
IS ordinarily employed to keep the stars acting at the same point of the 
plate was dispensed with. The telescope, in fact, remained iixed while 
the heavens rotated iii obedience to the diuriuil motion. Under these 
circumstances each star, as minute after minute passed by, i)roduced 
an image on a different part of the platerthe consequence of which was 
that the record which the star was found to have left, when the picture 
was developed, was that of a long trail instead of a sharply defined 
point. As each star appears to describe a circle in the sky around the 
pole, and as, in the vicinity of the pole, these circles were small enough 
to be included in the plate, this polar photograph exhibits a striking- 
spectacle. It displayed a large niunber of concentric circles, or rather, 
I should say, of portions of circles, for the exposures having lasted for 
about four hours, about one- sixth of each circumference was completed 
during that time.

76 THE WANDERINGS OF THE NORTH POLE. 

The effect thus produced was that of a number of circular arcs of 
varying- sizes and of different degrees of briglitness. Most conspicu- 
ous amongst tliem was the tiail x^roduced by the actual j)olar star 
itself. It is well known, of course, that though the situation of the 
pole is conveniently marked by the fortunate circumstance that a 
bright star happened during the luesent century to lie in the immedi- 
ate vicinity of the veritable pole, yet, of course, this star is not actually 
at the pole, and consequently, like all the other stars, Polaris itself 
must be revolving in a circle whereof the center lies at the true pole. 
The brighter the star the brighter is the trail which it produces, so 
that the circle made by Polaris is nuich more conspicuous than the 
circles produced by the other stars of inferior luster. It is however 
to be noted that some of the faint stars lie much closer to the pole than 
Polaris itself. There is indeed one very minute object so close to the 
pole that the circle in which its movements are performed seems very 
little more than a point when represented on the screen on which the 
slide was projected. The interesting circumstance was noted that there 
appeared to be occasional interruptions to the continuity of the circular 
arcs. This was due to the fact that clouds had interposed during the 
nitervals represented by the interruptions. A practical application is 
thus suggested, which has been made to render useful service at Har- 
vard College Observatory. Every night, and all night long, a plate is 
there exposed to this j)articular part of the sky, and the degree in 
which the Pole-star leaves a more or less complete trail affords an indi- 
cation of the clearness or cloudiness of the sky throughout the course 
of the night. From the positions of the parts where the trail has been 
inrerru})ted it is possible not only to learn the amount of cloudiness 
that has prevailed, but the particular hours during which it has lasted. 
This interesting system of concentric j)olar circles affords us j^erhaps 
the most striking visual rej)resentation that could possibly be obtained 
of the existence of that point in the heavens which we know as the 
pole. The picture thus exhibited was a striking illustration of the 
Copernican doctrine that the diurnal stellar movement was indeed only 
apparent, being of course due to the rotation of the earth on its axis. 

Suppose that a photograph, like that I have been describing, were to 
be taken at intervals of a century, it would be found that the center 
of the system of circles, that is to say, the veritable pole itself, was 
gradually changing on the heavens. I do not by this mean that the 
stars themselves would be found to have shifted their i)laces relatively 
to each other. No doubt there is some effect of this kind, but it is an 
insignificant one, and need not at present concern us. The essential 
point to be noticed is, that the stars which happen to lie in the vicinity 
of the pole would have a changed relation to the pole in consequence 
of the fact that this latter point is itself in incessant movement. At 
the present time the pole is advancing in such a direction that it is 
getting nearer to the Pole-star, so that the actual circle which the Pole- 



THE WANDERINGS OF THE NORTH POLE. 77 

star is describing is becoming less and less. Tlie time will come when 
the circle which this star performs will have reached its lowest dimen- 
sions, but still the pole will be moving on its way, and then, of course, 
the dimensions of the circle traversed by the Pole-star will undergo a. 
corresponding increase. As hundreds of years and thousands of years 
roll by the i)ole will retreat farther and farther from the Pole star, so 
that in the course of a i)eriod as far on in the future as the foundation 
of l\ome was in the past, the pole will be no longer sufiticiently near 
the Pole-star to enable the latter to render to astronomers the peculiar 
services which it does at |)resent. 

Looking still fiirther ahead, we find that in the course of about twelve 
thousand years the pole will have gained a position as remote as it 
j)ossibly can from that position which it now occupies. This most criti- 
cal point in the heavens will then lie not far from the star Vega, tlie 
brightest point in the northern sky, and then it will commence to return, 
so that after the lapse of about twenty-five thousand years the pole 
will be found again in the same celestial neighborhood where it is 
to-night, having, in the meantime, traversed a mighty circle through the 
constellations. In all this there is no novelty; these movements«of the 
pole are so conspicuous that they were detected long before the intro- 
duction of accurate instruments. They were discovered so far back as 
the time of Hipparchus, and the cause of theju was assigned by New- 
ton as one of the triumphs of his doctrine of universal gravitation. In 
giving the title of " The Wanderings of the North Pole" to this paper 
I did not however intend to discourse of the movements to which I 
have hitherto referred. They are so familiar that every astronomer has 
to attend to them practically in the redaction of almost every observa- 
tion of the place of the celestial body. It was however necessary to 
make the reference which I have done to this subject in order that the 
argument on which we are presently to enter should be made suffi- 
ciently clear. It must be noted that the expression "the North Pole " 
is ambiguous. It may mean either of two things, which are quite dis- 
tinct. In the case we have already spoken of, I understand by the 
North Pole that point on the celestial sphere which is the center of the 
system of concentric circles described by the circumpolar stars. The 
other sense in which the North Pole is used is the terrestrial one; it 
denotes that point on this earth which has been the goal of so many 
expeditions, and to reach which has been the ambition of so many illus- 
trious navigators. We have a general notion that the terrestrial North 
liole lies in a desolate region of eternal ice, somewhat relieved by the 
circumstance that for six months of the year the frozen prospect is 
brightened by perpetual day, though on the other hand, during the 
remaining six months of the year this region is the abode of perpetual 
night. 

The North Pole is that hitherto unattainable point on our globe on 
which, if an observer could take his station, he would find that the 



78 THE WANDERINGS OP THE NORTH POLE 

phenomena of the rising and the setting of the stars, so familiar else- 
where, were non-existent. Each star viewed from the coign of vantage 
offered by the North Pole would move round and round in a horizontal 
circle, and the system of concentric circles would be directly overhead. 
In midsummer the sun would seem to revolve around, remaining prac- 
tically at the same elevation above the horizon for a few days, until it 
slowly began to wend its way downwards in a spiral. In a couple of 
months it would draw near the horizon, and as day after day passed 
by the luminary would descend lower and lower until its edge grazed 
the horizon all round. The'Setting-ol the sun for the long winter would 
then be about to commence, and gradually less and less of the disk 
would remain perceptible. Finally the sun would disappear altogether, 
though for many days afterwards a twilight glow would travel round 
the whole hemisphere, ever getting less and less, until at last all indi- 
cations of the sun had vanished. The utter darkness of winter would 
then ensue for months, mitigated only so far as celestial luminaries 
were concerned by starlight or occasional moonlight. Doubtless, how- 
ever, the fitful gleams of the aurora would often suf&ce to render the 
surrounding desolation visible. Then as the spring drew near, if, 
indeed, such a word as spring be at all applicable to an abode of utter 
dreariness, a faint twilight would be just discernible. The region thus 
illuminated would move round and round the horizon each twenty-four 
hours, gradually becoming more and more conspicuous, until at last the 
edge of the sun appeared. Then, by a spiral movement inverse to that 
with which its descent was accomplished, the great luminary would 
steal .above the horizon, there to continue for a period of six months 
until the commencement of the ensuing winter. Indeed, the actual 
duration of apparent summer would be somewhat protracted in conse- 
quence of the effect of refraction in raising the sun visually above the 
horizon when in reality it was still below. The result would be to 
lengthen the summer at one end and to anticipate it at the other. 
Such w(»uld be the astronomical conditions of the North Pole; that 
anomalous point, from whence every other locality on the globe lies due 
south, that mysterious point which up to the present seems never to 
have been approached by man within. a distance less than 400 miles, 
uidess, indeed, as is not improbably the case, the pre-glacial man who 
lived in the last genial period found a temperate climate and enjoyable 
conditions even at the latitude of 90°. 

For our present purpose it will be necessary to get a very clear idea 
as to the precise point on the earth which we mean when we speak of 
the North Pole. As our knowledge of it is almost entirely derived from 
astronomical phenomena, it is necessary to assign the exact locality of 
the pole by a strict definition depending on astronomical facts. Sup- 
posing that Nansen does succeed in his expedition, as everyone hopes 
that he will, and does penetrate within that circle of 400 miles radius 
where the foot of civilized man has never yet trod, how is he to identify 



THE WANDERINGS OF THE NORTH POLE. 79 

that particular spot on this globe which is to be delined by the North 
Pole? It was for tliis purpose that at the commencement of this paper 
I referred to that photograph of the concentric circles wliich illustrated 
so forcibly the position of tlie pole in the heavens. Imagine that your 
eye was placed at the center of the earth, and that you had a long- slen- 
der tube from that center to the surface through which you could look 
out at the celestial sphere; if that tube be placed in such a way that, 
when looking from the center of the earth through this tube, your vision 
was directed exactly to that imrticular point of the heavens which is 
the center of the circle now described by the Pole Star and the other 
circumpolar stars, then that spot in which the end of the tube passes 
out through the surface of the earth is the North Pole. Imagine a 
stake to be driven into the earth at the place named, then tlie position 
of that stake is the critical s]K)t on our globe wliich has licen the object 
of so much scientitic investigation and of so much maritime enterprise. 
The reader must not tliiiik that I am attempting to be hyper-accurate 
in this definition of the Nortli Pole; no doubt, in our ordinary language 
we often think of the pole as something synonymous with the polar 
regions, an ill-defined and most vaguely known wilderness of ice. For 
scientific purposes it is, however, essential to understand that the pole 
is a very definitely marked point, and we must assign its position accu- 
rately, not merely to within miles, but even to within feet. Indeed, it 
is a truly extraordinary circumstance that, considering no one, with the 
possible exception just referred to, has ever yet been within so many 
hundred miles of the pole, we should be able to locate it so ])recisely 
that we are absolutely certain of its position to within an area not 
larger than that covered by a small town, or even by a good sized draw- 
ing room. 

We have seen that the North Pole in the sky is in incessant move- 
ment, and that the travels which it accomplishes in the course of many 
centuries extend over a wide sweep of the heavens; this naturally sug 
gests the question, Does the pole in the earth move about in any simi- 
lar manner, and if so, what is the nature and extent of its variation? 
Here is the point about which those modern researches have been made 
which it is my special object to discu^ss in this paper. Let us first see 
clearly the issue that is raised. At the time of the building- of the 
Pyramids the pole in the heavens was in quite a ditterent place from 
its present position; the Pole Star had not at that time the slightest 
title to be called a pole star; in fact, the point around which the heav- 
ens revolved lay in a wholly diftereut constellation. It Avas certainly 
not far from the star Alpha I)raco)iis about 3000 b. c, and we could 
indicate its position quite definitely if we had any exact knowledge as 
to the date of the Pyramids' erection. It is, however, plain that the 
difference was so patent between the celestial pole at the time of the 
Pyramids and the celestial pole of later centuries, that it could not be 
overlooked in attentive observation of the heavens. As the North 



80i THE WANDERINGS OF THE NORTH POLE. 

Pole in tlie sky was, therefore, so different in the time of the Pharaohs 
from the North Pole in the time of Victoria, it is proper to ask whether 
there was a like difference, or any difference at all, between the terres- 
trial pole at the time of the building of the Pyramids and that terres- 
trial pole in whose quest IS'ai I sen is just setting off. If Pharaoh had 
despatched a successful exi)edition to the North Pole and driven a post 
in there to mark it, and if Nansen were now successful, would he tind 
that the North Pole in the earth which he was to mark occupied the 
same position or a different i)osition from that which had been discov- 
ered thousands of years previously ? At first one might hastily say 
that there must be such a difference, for it will be remembered that I 
have defined the North Pole in the earth as that point through which 
the tube i)asses which would permit an eye placed at the center of the 
earth to view the North Pole in the sky. If, therefore, the North Pole 
in the sky had undergone a great change in its j)osition, it might seem 
obvious that the tube from the earth's center to its .surface which would 
now conduct the vision from that centre to the north celestial pole 
would emerge at a different i)oint of the earth's crust from that which 
it formerly occujned. We have here to deal with the case that arises 
not uufrequently in astronomy, in which a fact of broad general truth 
requires a minute degree of qualification ; indeed, it is not too much to 
say that it- is in this qualification of broad general truths that many of 
the greatest discoveries in i>hysical science have consisted. And such 
is the case in the present instance. There is a broad general truth and 
there is the qualification of it. It is the qualification that constitutes 
the essential discovery which it is my object herein to set forth. But 
before doing so it will be necessary for me to lay down the broad gen- 
eral truth that the North Pole of the earth as it existed in the time of 
the Pharaohs appears to be practically the same as the North Pole of 
the earth now. It seems perfectly certain that at any time within the 
last ten thousand years the North Pole might have been found within 
a region on the earth's surface not larger than Hyde Park. Indeed, 
the limits might be drawn much more closely. It is quite possible that 
many an edifice in London occupies an area sufliciently great to cover 
the holes that wonld be made by all the posts that might be driven to 
mark the precise sites of the North Pole on the earth not only for the 
the last five ov ten thousand years, but probably for periods much 
more ancient still. It is very likely that the North Pole at the time of 
the glacial epoch was practically indistinguishable from the North 
Pole now; in fact, the constancy, or sensible constancy I should, per- 
haps, rather say, of the situation of this most critical point in our globe 
is one of the most astonishing facts in terrestrial physics. 

Let us, then, assume this broad general fact of the i)ermanency in 
the position of the North Pole, and deduce the obvious consequences it 
implies with regard to the earth's movement. At this point we find 
the convenience of the time-honored illustration in our geography books 



THE WANDERINGS OF THE NORTH POLE. 81 

which likens tlie earth to an orange. Let ns thrust a knitting needle 
through the orange along its shortest diameter to represent the axis 
about which the eartli rotates. Not only does the earth perform one 
revolution about this axis in the space of each sidereal day, but the 
axis itself lias a movement. If the earth's axis always remained fixed, 
or never had any motion except in a direction parallel to itself, then the 
point to whicli it was directed on the sky would never change. We 
have however seen that the pole in the sky is incessantly altering its 
position; we are therefore taught that the direction of the earth's axis 
of rotation is constantly changing. To simulate the movement by the 
orange and knitting needle, we nnist imagine the cn-ange to rotate 
around its axis once in that period of twenty-three lionrs and fifty sis 
minutes which is well known as the length of the sidereal day; while at 
the same time the knitting needle, itself bearing, of course, the orange 
with it, performs a conical movement with such extreme slowness that 
not less than twenty- live thousand years is occupied in making the cir- 
cuit. The movement, as has often been pointed out, is like that of a 
peg top which rotates rapidly on its axis while at the same time the 
axis itself has a slow revolving motion. Thus the phenomena which 
are presented in the rotation of the eartli demonstrate that the axis 
about which the earth rotates occupies what is, at all events, approx- 
imately a fixed position in the earth, though not a fixed position in 
space. We can hardly be surprised at this result; it merely implies 
that the earth acts like a rigid body on the whole, and does not permit 
the axis about which it is turning to change its position. 

It will now be easily understood how it comes to pass that the posi- 
tion of the North Pole upon the earth has not appreciably changed in 
the course of thousands of years. The axis around which the earth 
rotates has retained a permanent position relative to the earth itself; 
it has however continuously changed, it is at this moment changing, 
and it will continue to change with regard to its direction in space. So 
far our knowledge extended up to within the last few years, but in these 
modern days a closer inquiry has been made into this, as into as many 
other physical subjects, and the result has been to disclose the impor- 
tant fact that, though the ])heiiomena as just described are very nearly 
true, they must receive a certain minute qualification. Complete exam- 
ination of this subject is desirable, not only on account of its natural 
importance, but also l)ecause it illustrates the refinements of which 
modern astronomical processes are susceptible. I have stated the 
broad general fact that the position of the terrestrial pole undergoes 
no large oi- considerable fiuctuation. But while we admit that nolarge 
fluctuation is possible, it is yet very proper to consider whether there 
may not be a small fluctuation. It is certain that t\\e position of the 
pole as it would bo marked by a post driven into the earth today can 
not difler by a mile from tlie position in which the same point would be 
marked last year or next year. But does it difler at all? Is it abso- 
SM 93 6 



82 THE WANDERINGS OF THE NORTH POLE. 

lutely exactly the same'? Would there be a difference, not indeed of 
miles but of yards or of feet between the precise position of the pole on 
the earth determined at successive intervals of time i? Would it be the 
same if we carried out our comparisons, not merely between one year 
and another, but day after day, week after week, month after month'? 
No doubt the more obvious phenomena proclaim in the most unmistak- 
able manner that the position of the pole is substantially invariable. 
If therefore there be any fluctuations in its position, those could only 
be disclosed by careful scrutiny of minute phenomena which were too 
delicate to be detected in the coarser methods of observation. There 
is indeed a certain presumption in favor of the . notion that absolute 
constancy in the position of the pole need not be expected. Almost 
every statement of astronomical doctrine requires its qualification, and 
it would seem indeed unlikely that when sufiflcient refinement was intro- 
duced into the measurements the position of the pole in the earth should 
appear to be absolutely unalterable. Until a very recent period the 
evidence on the subject was almost altogether negative; it was no 
doubt recognized that there might be some fluctuations in the position 
of the pole, but it was known that they would only be extremely small, 
and it was believed that in all probability those fluctuations must be 
comj)rised within those slender limits which are too much affected 
by inevitable errors of observation to afford any reliable result. Per- 
severance in this interesting inquiry has been at last rewarded; and 
as in so many similar cases we are indebted to the labors of many inde- 
pendent workers for the recent extension of our knowledge. We are, 
however, at present most interested by the labors of Mr. Chandler, a 
distinguished American astronomer, who has made an exhaustive exam- 
ination into the subject. The result has been to afford a conclusive 
proof that the terrestrial pole does undergo movement. Mr. Chandler 
has been so successful as to have determined the law of those polar 
movements, and he has found that when they are taken into consider- 
ation, an important improvement in certain delicate astronomical inquir- 
ies is the result. These valuable investigations merit, in the highest 
degree, the attention, not only of those who are specially devoted to 
astronomical and mathematical researches, but of that large and ever- 
increasing class who are anxious for general knowledge with regard to 
the physical phenomena of our globe. 

At first sight it might seem difficult indeed to conduct the investi- 
gation of this question. Here is a point on the earth's surface, this 
wonderful North Pole, which, so far as we certainly know, has never 
yet been approached to within 400 miles, and yet we are so solicitous 
about the position of this pole and about its movement that we demand 
a knowledge of its whereabouts with an accuracy which at first appears 
wholly unattainable. It sounds almost incredible when we are told 
that a shift in the position of the North Pole to the extent of 20 yards, 
or even 20 feet, is appreciable, notwithstanding that we have never 



THE WANDERINGS OF THE NORTH POLE. 83 

been able to get nearer to it than from one end of England to the other. 
Indeed, as a matter of fact, our knowledge of the movements of the 
pole are derived from observations made not alone hundreds but even 
many thousands of miles distant. It is in such observations as those 
at Greenwich or Berlin, Pulkowa or Washington, that the determina- 
tions have been made by which changes in the position of the pole can 
be ascertained with a delicacy and precision for which those would 
ha»cdly be prepared who were not aware of the refinement of modern 
astronomical methods. I do not hoAvever imply that the observations 
conducting" to the discoveries now about to be considered have been 
exclusively obtained at the observatories I have named. There are a 
large number of similar institutions over the globe which have been 
made to bear their testimony. Tens of thousands of different observa- 
tions have been brought together, and by discussing them it has been 
found possible to remove a large part of the errors by which such work 
is necessarily affected, and to elicit from the vast mass those grains of 
truth which could not have been discovered had it not been for the 
enormous amount of material that was available. Mr. Chandler has 
discussed these matters in a remarkable series of papers, and it will be 
necessary for me now to enter into some little detail, both as regards 
the kind of observations that have been made, and the results to which 
astronomers have been thereby conducted. 

Greenwich Observatory lies more than 2,000 miles from the North 
Pole, and yet if the pole were to shift by as much as the width of 
Eegent street, the fact that it had done so would be quite perceptible 
at Greenwich. Let me endeavor to explain how such a measurement 
could be achieved. In finding the latitude at any locality we desire, 
of course, to know the distance between the locality and the equator, 
expressed in angular magnitude. But though this is distinctly the 
definition of latitude, it docs not at once convey the idea as to how 
this element can be ascertained. How for instance would an astrono- 
mer at Greenwich be able to learn the angular distance of the observa- 
tory from the equator! The equator is not marked on the sky, and it 
is obvious that the observer must employ a somewhat indirect process 
to ascertain what he wants. Here, again, we have to invoke the aid 
of that celestial pole to which I have so often referred. Think of that 
point on the sky which is the common center of the circles exhibited 
on Prof. Barnard's photograph. That point is not indeed marked by 
any special star, but it is completely defined by the circumstance that 
it is the center of the track performed by the circumpolar stars. We 
thus obtain a clear idea of this definite point in the sky, and the hori- 
zon is a perfectly definite line, at all events from any station where 
the sea is visible. It is not difficult to imagine that by suitable meas- 
urements we can ascertain the altitude of this point in the heavens 
above the horizon. That altitude is the latitude of the place; it is, in 
fact, the very angle which lies between the locality on the earth and 



84 THE WANDERINGS OF THE NORTH POLE. 

the equator. It is (jiiite true that as the pole is implied by these circles 
rather tlian directly marked by tliem, the measurement of the altitude 
can not be effected (piite directly. The actual process is to take the 
Pole star, or some one of the other circumpolar stars, and to measure 
the greatest height to which it ascends above the horizon, and the 
lowest altitude to which it declines about twelve hours later. The 
former of these is as much above the pole as the latter is below it, so 
between them we are able to ascertain the altitude of the pole with a 
high degree of accuracy. It is true that in a fixed observatory .such 
as Greenwich there is no visible sea horizon, and even if there were 
it would not provide so excellent a method as is offered by tlie equiv- 
alent process of first observing the star directly and then observing 
its retlection from a dish of mercury. In this way the altitude of the 
star above the horizon is deteruiiued with the utmost precision. 

The practical astronomer will however remember that of couise he 
has to attend to the effects of atmospheric refraction, which invariably 
shows a star higher up than it ought to be. This can be allowed for, 
and in this way the latitude of the observatory is ascertained with all 
needful accuracy. When the highest degree of i)recision is sought for, 
and it IS only observations with a very high degree of precision which 
are available for our present purpose, a considerable number of stars 
liave to be employed, and very many observations have to be taken at, 
different seasons of the year so as to eliminate, as far as possible, all 
sources of casual error. When, however, due attention has been paid 
to those precautions which the experience of astronomers suggests, the 
result that is obtained is characterized by extraordinary precision. 
How great that precision may be I must endeavor to explan. The lati- 
tude o± every important observatory is obtained from a larg'e number 
of observations, and it would be unlikely that it was more than one or 
two-tenths of a second different fi'om the actual mean value. Now a 
tenth of a second on the surface of the earth corresponds to a distance 
of about 10 feet, and this means that the latitude of the observatory, or, 
as we must now speak very precisely, the latitude of the center of the 
meridian circle in the observatory, is known to a degree of precision 
represented by a few paces. It will thus be seen that with the accu- 
racy attainable in our modern observations, it would often be an appre- 
ciable blunder to mistake the latitude of one wall of the observatory for 
that of the opposite wall ; in other words, we know accurately to within 
the tenth of a second, or within not much more than the tenth of a sec- 
ond, the distance from the center of the transit circle at Greenwich, 
down to the earth's equator. But, of course, the distance from the 
pole to the e(]uator is 00°, and this being so it follows that the distance 
from the north pole of the earth to the center of the transit circle at 
Greenwich Observatory has been accurately ascertained to within one 
or two-tenths of a second. If any change took place in the distance 
between the pole and the meridian circle at Greenwich, then it must be

mauifested by tlie cliaiijies of latitude. We shall now be able to uiider- 
staiul liow any nioveuieiit of the pole, or rather of the position which it 
occupies in the earth, would be indicated at Greenwich. Siqipose, for 
instance, that the pole actually advanced towards Great Britain, and 
that it moved to a distance of, let us say, 30 feet, the effect of this would 
be to produce a diminution of the distance between the pole and Green- 
wich, that is to say, there must be an increase in the distance from 
Greenwich to the equator. This would corresjiond to a change in the 
latitude of Greenwich; that latitude would diminish by three-tenths of 
a second, which is a magnitude quite large enough to be recognizable 
by the observations I have already indicated as jiroper for the determi- 
nation of latitude. A shift of the pole to a distance of GO feet would be 
a conspicuous alteration announced in every observatory in Europe i)ro- 
vided with instruments of good modern construction. 

Until the last few years there was not much reason to think that the 
pole exhibited any unequivocal indications of movement. i:^o doubt, 
displacements resembling those which have now been detinitely ascer- 
tained have existed for many years, but they were too small to produce 
any appreciable eflt'ect, except with instruments of a more refined de- 
scription than those with which the earlier observatories were equipped. 
It was obvious that the pole did not make movements of anything like 
a hundred yards in extent; had it done so the resulting variations in 
latitude would have been conspicuous enough to have obtained notice 
many years ago. The actual movements which the pole does make are 
of that sm.all character which require very minute discussion of the 
observations to establish theni beyond reach of cavil. There is how- 
ever one striking method of confirming such observations as have been 
made which leaves no doubt of the accuracy of the results to which 
they point. Suppose, for instance, that the great observatories in 
Europe indicate at a certain time that their latitudes have all increased ; 
this necessarily implies that the equator has receded from them, and 
that, therefore, the North Pole has approached Europe. If however 
the North Pole has approached Europe it must liave retreated from 
those regions on the opposite side of the world — say, for instance, the 
Sandwich Islands. Observations in the Sandwich Islands should 
therefore indicate, if our reasoning has been correct, that the pole has 
retreated from them, and that the equator has therefore advanced in 
such a way that the latitudes of localities in the Sandwich Islands have 
diminished. The various observations which have been brought to- 
gether by the diligence of Mr. Chandler, including those which lie has 
himself made with an ingenious apparatus of his own design, have been 
submitted to this test, and they have borne it well. The result has 
been that it is now possible to follow the movements of the ])ole with a 
considerable degree of completeness. Prof. Chandler has tracked the 
pole month after month, year after year, through a period of more than 
a century of exact observations, and he has succeeded in determining

the inoveiiieiits whicli tliis point imdergoes. Let me here endeavor to 
describe the result at wliich he has arrived. 

In that paUieocrystic ocean which Arctic travellers have described, 
where the masses of ice lie heaped together in the wildest confusion, 
lies this point which is the object of so much speculation. Let us think 
of this tract, or a portion of it, to be leveled to a plain, and at a par- 
ticular center let a circle be drawn, the radius of which is about 30 feet; 
it is in the circumference of this circle that the pole of the earth is con- 
stantly to be found. In fact, if at different times, month after month 
and year after year, the position of the pole was ascertained as the 
extremity of that tube from which an eye placed at the center of the 
earth would be able to see the pole of the heavens, and if the succes- 
sive positions of this pole were marked by pegs driven into the ground, 
then the several positions in which the pole would be found must nec- 
essarily trace out the circumference of the circle that has been thus 
described. The period in which each revolution of the pole around the 
circle takes place is about four hundred and twenty-seven days; the 
result therefore of these investigations shows, when the observations 
are accurate, that the North Pole of the earth is not, as has been so 
long supposed, a fixed point, but that it revolves around in the earth, 
accomplishing each revolution in about two months more than the 
period that the earth requires for the perfornmiice of each revolution 
around the sun. 

The discovery of the movement of the pole which 1 have here 
described must be regarded as a noteworthy achievement in astronomy, 
nor is the result to which it leads solely of interest in consequence of 
the lesson it teaches us with regard to the circumstances of the earth's 
rotation. It has a higher utility, wliich the practical astronomer will 
not be slow to appreciate, and of which he has, indeed, already experi- 
enced the benefit. There are several astronomical investigations in 
which the latitude of the observatory enters as a significant element. 
Latitude is, in fact, at every moment employed as an important factor 
in many astronomical determinations. To take one of the most simple 
cases, suppose that we are finding the place of a planet in the observa- 
tory. We deduceits position by measuring its zenith distance, and then 
to obtain the declination the latitude of the observatory has, of coui-ser 
to be considered. Now astronomers have hitherto been in the habit of 
accepting the determination of their latitude which had been estab- 
lished by a i^rotracted series of observations, and treating it as if it 
were a constant. This method will be no longer admissible when astro- 
nomical work of the highest class is demanded. No doubt, from the 
sailor's point of view, an alteration in latitude which at most amounts 
to a shift of 00 feet — not a quarter, perhaps, of the length of his vessel — 
is immaterial. But in the more refined parts of astronomical work 
these discoveries can no longer be overlooked ; indeed, Mr. Chandler 
has shown that many discrepancies by which astronomers had been 



THE WANDERINGS OF THE NORTH POLE. 87 

baffled can be removed when note is taken of the drciim stance that the 
latitude of the observatory is in an incessant condition of transforma- 
tion in accordance with the law which his labors have expounded. It 
will ere long be necessary in every observatory Avhere important work 
is being done to obtain for every day the correction to the mean value 
of the latitude, in order to obtain the value appropriate for that day. 
There are also other grounds of a somewhat profounder character 
on which the discoveries now made are eminently instructive. 
Those who are interested in the physics of our globe often discuss 
the question as to whether the internal heat, which the eartli certainly 
X)ossesses, is sufticiently intense to render the deep seated portions of 
our globe more or less lluid. On the other hand, the effects of pres- 
sure, especially of such pressures as are ex})erieDced in tlie depths 
hundreds and thousands of miles below the surface, must go far to con- 
solidate the materials to form what must be sensibly a rigid body. 
The question, therefore, arises: Is the earth to be regarded as a rigid 
mass, or js it not? The ]>heuomena of the tides had already to some 
extent afforded information on this subject, and now Mr. Chandler's 
investigation adds much further light, for it is certain from his result 
that the earth can not be a rigid body. It is quite true that, even 
though the earth were rigid, the x)ole might go round in a circle and 
that circle might have a 30-feet radius, but in such a case the period 
would be only about three-quarters of the four hundred and twenty- 
seven days which he has found. In the interest, therefore, of the theo- 
retical astronomer, as well as on the other grounds Mhich I have set 
forth, Mr. Chandler's investigations must be regarded as a most impor- 
tant contribution to modern astronomy. 



THE GREAT LUNAR CRATER TYCHO.* 



By A. C. Ranyard. 



The late Prebendary Webb used to speak of Tycho as the metropol- 
itan crater of tlie moon. Tliongh by no means the largest of the hmar 
craters, it is one of the most striking features of the Innar landscape, 
especially when the moon is near to the fnll, and the shadows of the 
mountains liave all disappeared. The crater of Tycho is then seen as 
a conspicuously wliite spot, from which radiate in all directions a great 
number of whitish rays that extend over more than a third of the visi- 
ble hemisi)liere of the moon, indicating that the crater has been the 
center of a colossal disturbance which seems to have shattered the 
lunar crust in all directions. We have, as far as 1 am aware, no evi- 
dence in the terrestrial geologic record that a corresponding cataclysm 
has ever similarly shattered the earth's crust; but onr terrestrial vol- 
canoes are puny things compared with the giant craters of our smaller 
companion planet. 

As might be expected, the strange phenomena presented in so nn^jar- 
alleled a degree by Tycho have been a fruitful stimulus to speculation 
as to the origin of the lunar craters and the radiating systems of rays 
with which many of the moon's craters are evidently intimately con- 
nected. Many able men have doubted whether there is any true 
analogy between terrestrial volcanoes and the gigantic lunar ring 
mountains and circular depressions which we ordinarily speak of as 
craters. The ring of Tycho is 54 miles in diameter, and the great cra- 
ter Clavius, which lies to the south of it, is more than 140 miles in 
diameter; but Clavius is by no means the largest of the lunar craters. 
If the lunar Ajjcnnines and the other mountains forming a broken 
ring round the Mare Imbrium are the remnants of a crater, it must 
have had a diameter of over 600 miles, while the largest terrestrial cra- 
ters are not more than 15 or 16 miles in diameter.t Vesuvius and the

90 THE GREAT LUNAR CRATER TY(]HO. 

Monte Siiinna would appear as insignificant little hills if they were 
dropped into the center of the crater of Tycho, whose ring' wall towers 
to a height of 17,000 feet above the plain it incloses. 

Robert Hooke compared the lunar craters to the cup-sha[)ed pits 
formed on the surface of boiling mud by escaping vapor, and the idea 
has been a fascinating one to many minds since his day, though it needs 
but little consideration to recognize that bubbles or blisters formed iu 
a plastic material on a scale corresponding with that of the lunar craters 
would rapidly siidc down and be obliterated. 

Mr. S. E. Peal has ingeniously advocated a theory which seems to 
me almost equally untenable. He assumes that the lunar surface con- 
sists entirely of ice, and that the craters and pit-like depressions are 
due to the action of hot springs which have not flowed continuously, 
but that water has from time to time issued from vents in the soil, and 
has melted the ice above the vent. The water is then supposed to have 
flowed back to the warm interior of the moon, taking with it a part of 
the surface ice that has been melted, and by a series of such ebbs and 
flows Mr. Peal conceives the terraced walls of the lunar craters to have 
been built up above the level of surrounding plains. Putting on one 
side the difficulty of conceiving of nearly x>erpendicular ice cliffs of 
17,000 to 20,000 feet high, standing for ages without flowing down as 
glaciers to the plains at their feet, we have to account for the fact that 
the lunar plains and the floors of the deeper lunar craters are generally 
of a much darker tint than the higher ground upon the moon, while if 
the whole of the lunar surface were composed of ice and snow there 
would be no reason for such a difference of tint, unless, as Mr. I'eal 
suggests, the lunar ijlains are surfaces of virgin ice while the moun- 
tains are formed of snow. But virgin ice would reflect the light of the 
sun specularly, and in the equatorial and tropical parts of the moon 
from which the sun's rays could be specularly reflected to us there are 
no traces of such specular reflection. The theory also fails to account 
for the small craters frequently found on the rims of large craters and 
on the sloping sides of mountains. Such small craters are far above 
the assumed rock surface of the moon, and warm water issuing from 
them would flow down the sides of the mountains leaving marked traces 
of its flow. The meteoric theory of the formation of lunar craters has 
also had many advocates. It is alleged that if a pebble be dropi)cd 
into mud the scar produced has a raised rim and a central hill, which 
resembles a lunar crater. Even Mr. Proctor had an inclination for this 
theory. At page 346 of his book on the moon he says: " So far as the 
smaller craters are concerned, there is nothing incredible in the suppo- 



schatka ("Volcanoes," second edition, London, 1862, p. 457;; (4) an imperfect cra- 
ter cirque on Mauritius, mentioned by Cliarles Darwiu, is mapped (Admiralty) as 
about 15 by 16 miles in extent; (5) the crater walls surrounding Lake Bolesua, 
Italy, are mapped as 11 by 9 miles in extent ; (6) the crater containing Lake Man iuju, 
Sumatra, is mapped (Rectus) as 15 by 7 miles in extent. 



THE GREAT LUNAR CRATER TVCHO. 91 

sition that tliey were due to meteoric rain falliug- wlieu the inooii was 
in a plastic conditiou. Indeed, it is somewhat remarkable how strik- 
ingly certain parts of the moon resemble a surface which has been 
rained upon, while sufficiently plastic to receive the impressions, but 
not too soft to retain them. N'or is it any valid ol)jection to this sup- 
position, that the rings left by meteoric downfall would only be circu- 
lar when the falling matter chanced to strike the moon's surface 
squarely, for it is far more probable that even when the surface was 
struck obliquely, and the opening first formed by the meteoric mass or 
cloud of bodies was therefore markedly elliptic, the plastic surface 
would close in round the place of impact until the impression actually 
formed had assumed a nearly circular shape." After inviting- attention 
to the lunar photographs published with his book, Mr. Proctor contin- 
ues: " It will be seen that the multitudinous craters near the southern 
part of the moon are strongly suggestive of the kind of process I have 
referred to, and that, in fact, if one judged solely by appearances one 
would be disposed to adopt somewhat confidently the theory that the 
moon had had her present surface ccnitour chiefly formed by meteoric 
downfalls during the period of her existence when she was plastic to 
impressions from without. I am however sensible that the great 
craters, under close telescopic scrutiny, by no means corresjiond in 
appearance to what we should expect if they were formed by the down- 
fall of great masses from without. The regular, and we may almost 
say battlemented, aspect of some of these craters, the level floor, and 
the central peaks so commonly recognized, seem altogether different 
from what we should expect if a mass fell from outer space upon the 
moon's surface. It is indeed just possible that under the tremendous 
heat generated by the downfall, a vast circular region of tlie moon's 
surface would be rendered liquid, and that in rai^idly solidifying while 
still traversed by the ring waves resulting from the downfall, something 
like the iiresent condition would result." 

More recently the meteoric theory of the formation of lunar craters 
has been taken up and considerably elaborated by an American, Mr. 
G. K. Gilbert, who has made the theory the subject of an address deliv- 
ered when retiring from the presidency of the Washington Philosophical 
Society on December 10, 1802. Kecognizing the difficulty alluded to by 
Mr. Proct<n', viz, that most of the lunar craters are circular, Avhile if the 
meteoric bodies came from outer space many of them ought to strike 
the moon's surface very obliquely and produce elliptic rings, Mr. (xil- 
bert made a series of experinicnts in the laboratory and found that 
when projectiles were thrown obliquely against a target of plastic mate- 
rials a crater-shaped hole of elliptic contour was formed. In order to 
obviate this objection to the theory he assumes that the bombarding 
masses which gave rise to the lunar craters did not come from outer 
space, but were originally parts of a ring- about the earth similar to the 
ring which encircles the planet Saturn. From this ring- he supposes 



92 THE GREAT LUNAR CRATER TYCHO. 

that the moon was yradaally formed, tlie suuill bodies constitntiiii'' the 
ring liaviiiii' iirst coalesced into a large nnniber of inoonlets wliich tinally 
all united into a single sphere. According to this hypothesis the Innar 
craters are the scars produced by the collision of the nioonlets which 
last surrendered their individuality, and according to Mr. Gilbert and 
a mathematical friend who aided him in the investigation, 58 per cent 
of the moonlets would, under the circumstances imagined, strike the 
surface of the moon, making an angle of less than 20° with the vertical, 
while 70 per cent would strike at an angle of less than 30°, and 80 per 
cent at an angle of less thau 40°. From laboratory experiments Mr. 
Gilbert tbund that the ellipticity of the scars ou his jilastic target 
increased slowly up to an incidence of 40° to the vertical, and that 
beyond that incidence the resulting scars showed considerable ellip- 
ticity. He assumes that, owing to the flat character of the Saturniau 
ring abont the earth, the moonlets must have approached the moon 
approximately in the plane of its e(piator, but the fact is not attested 
by the grouping of the craters in a medial zone. Mr. Gilbert therefore 
assumes that the axis of the moon's rotation has shifted under the suc- 
cessive impulses of the bombardment, and that the moon's equator has 
occupied successively all i)arts of its surface. He assumes that the 
velocity of impact due to the moon's gravity would be sufficient to melt 
the rocks of the lunar surface, and that they would during a short period 
behave as if they w^ere composed of plastic material, but would become 
hardened.before the crater could subside. 

The theory does not at all commend itself to my mind. M. Roche, of 
Montpelier, showed that a ring abont a planet would break up if it 
extended beyond a distance of 2 ll-25ths the radins from the center of 
the planet, and if the density of the planet increased towards its center 
the maximum limit to which a ring could extend would be still further 
contracted. A moon formed just outside such a ring would have au 
ellipticity greater than that of an ordinary hen's egg; and as tidal 
action carried the moon away from its primary it would gradually 
approximate to a s])herical form. One can hardly conceive that such a 
change of shape could take place without obliterating scars on its sur- 
face; but there is another objection to the theory, which, to my mind, 
is even more conclusive. There are upon the moon many lines or 
strings of small craterlets which fall very evidently into line with one 
another. If we are forced to treat them as scars upon a target, we 
must regard their allineation as the result of meie chance distribution; 
but the number of such strings i)recludes any such assumption; there 
must therefore be a physical reason for the allineation, and the nu)st 
obvious assumption seems to be that the craterlets mark out a line of 
weakness in the crust of the moon and lie along a volcanic fissure or 
Innar fault. 

There is ever gradation in size and in tyi)e from the small craterlets 
or cup-shaped depressions up to the gigantic walled rings, and any 



THE GREAT LUNAR CRATER TYCHO. 93 

theory which professes to accouut for craterlets must account for the 
types of crater into which they gradually merge. We therefore seem 
driven back to the volcanic hypothesis, and have to exi)lnin why upon 
the moon, which is so much smaller than the earth, the volcanic out- 
breaks have been on so colossal a scale. We are not even in a position 
to say that the moon is made of similar materials to the earth — indeed, 
we know that its average density is considerably less, the earth being 
about 5*66 times as heavy as a similar globe of water, while the moon 
is only about 3-39 times as dense as water, or, according to Dr. Gill's 
recent determination, about 1 per cent less. We must not however 
conclude from this difference that the moon is made of different mate- 
rials from the earth, for we know too little as to the behavior of solids 
under the enormous pressures that they must be subjected to at even 
a few miles beneath the earth's surface. The average density of the 
rocks of which the earth's surface is composed is only about two and 
a half times that of water, but it does not follow that the central parts 
of the earth are comjiosed of different and heavier material. The great 
rigidity of the earth under the tidal strains iuiposedupou it by the sun 
and moon points to the conclusion that the solid materials of which the 
earth is built up are rendered rigid by compression, and that the idea 
of a fluid interior must be abandoned. Mr. George F. Becker, of the 
U. S. Geological Survey, has recently pointed out that the slags, into 
which most of the stratified rocks of the earth's surface would be 
reduced by melting, increase in bulk on fusion, and are not like iron 
and water, w4iich expand on solidifying; consequently, he argues that 
any crust which formed on the surface of a molten sphere of slag would 
speedily break up by its own weight and sink, and that the process 
would go on until the whole mass had been reduced in temperature by 
such upheavals to near the melting point of the slag. But if the liquid 
slag, or other materials of which the earth is composed, were capable 
of being reduced by the pressure of the superincumbent mass to the 
solid condition, such upheavals would not take place, and under such 
circumstances it is jjossible that the heat of the earth may go on increas- 
ing to its center. 

If below the surface of the earth large masses of highly heated rock 
are kept solid by the enormous pressure of overlying rocks, earth move- 
ments, caused by the cooling and contraction which crumple up the 
stratified rocks of the surface and give rise to the upheaving of moun- 
tain chains, may occasionally take off some of the weight from the 
rocks beneath, causing the highly heated rocks to run off into the 
liquid state again and find their way to the surface, causing the phe- 
nomena we know as volcanic action. 

If we adopt this theory of volcanic action, and assume that the moon 
is made of similar materials to the earth, we shall — Avith lunar gravity 
only equal to one sixth of terrestrial gravity — need to pass to a depth 
six times as great upon the moon in order to obtain the pressure neces- 



94 THE GREAT LUNAR CRATER TYCHO. 

sary to solidity liquid lava at a t(Miiperatme equivalent to that at which 
it is solidified beneath the earth's surface, and any change of pressure 
that releases a stratum of rock from the solid to the liquid state would 
upon the moon release a stratum approximately six times as thick, 
other conditions being similar, and would presumably give rise to lava 
flows on a gigantic scale compared with terrestrial evolutions. Added 
to these considerations, we must remember that under the feeble action 
of lunar gravity crater rings and cliffs may be built up of similar mate- 
rial much more steeply upon the moon than at the earth's surface. 

There are many formations upon the moon which do not take the 
form of crater rings. The Riphrean Mountains as shown in a photo- 
graph taken by the Brothers Henry in May, 1890, is a very good 
instance to cite. I should like to draw special attention to a curious 
straight black streak between the crater's Birt and Thebit. It is spoken 
of by Webb as a wall, but it rather seems to be a narrow valley or 
fault. It is shown on several of the photographs taken by the Brothers 
Henry. I would also draw the reader's attention to three dark spots 
on the floor of the crater Alphousus, which are shown in all good pho- 
tographs, as well as the curious marking, like a capital G, near to the 
centre of the Mare Nubian. 



THE EARLY TEMPLE AND PYRAMID BUILDERS.* 



By J. Norman Lockyeb. 



I have in previous articles discussed the orientation of many temples 
in various parts of Egypt. It will have been seen that it has been pos- 
sible to divide them into solar and stellar temples, and that in the case 
of the former both solstices and equinoxes have been in question, 

I have also referred to the very considerable literature which already 
existsas to the pyramids, and shownhow the most carefully constructed 
among them are invariably oriented truly to the four cardinal points, 
and further that it is possible that some parts of their structures might 
have served some astronomical purpose, since astronomical methods 
must certainly have been employed in their construction. 

It has also been suggested that the fundamental difference between 
solstitial and equinoctial worships, indicated by the solstitial temples 
and the pyramids, required nothing less than a difference of race to 
explain it. I propose now to inquire if there be any considerations 
which can be utilized to continue the discussion of the question thus 
raised on purely astronomical grounds. It is obvious that, if sufficient 
tradition exists to permit us to associate the various structures which 
have been studied astronomically Avith definite periods of Egyptian 
history, a study of the larger outlines of that history will enable us to 
determine whether or not the critical changes in dynasties and rulers 
were or were not associated with critical changes in astronomical ideas 
as revealed by changes in temple worship. If there be no connection, 
the changes may have been due to a change of idea only, and the sug- 
gestion of a distinction of race falls to the ground. 

In a region of inquiry where the facts are so few and difficult to recog- 
nize among a mass of myths and traditions, to say nothing of contra- 
dictory assertions by different authors, the more closely we adhere to 
a rigidly scientific method of inquiry the better. I propose to show 
therefore that there is one working hypothesis which seems to include 
a great many of the facts, and I hope to give the hypothesis and the facts 
in such a way that if there be anything inaccurately or incompletely

96 THE EARLY. TEiMPLE AND PYRAMID BUILDERS. 

stated it will be easy at once to chaui;e the front oi' the inquiry and 
proceed along tlie new line Indicated. 

I ]n_ay begin by remarking that it is fundamental for the hyiiothesis 
that the temples of On or Heliopolis, as stated by Maspero and other 
high authorities, existed before tbe times of Mini (Menes) and the 
pyramid-builders, whatever may have been the date of the original 
foundation of Thebes. 

Before ]\[ini, according to JNiaspero, "On et les villes du ISTord avaient 
eii hi part priucipale dons le developpement de la civilisation l5gyp- 
tienne. Les prieres et les hynines, qui formerent plus tard le noyau des 
livres sacres, avaient ete rediges sa On." * 

The working hypothesis is as follows: 

(1) The first civilization as yet glimpsed in Egypt, represented by 
On or Heliopolis, was a civilization with a solstitial solar worship asso- 
ciated with the rise of the Nile. A northern star was also worshiped. 

(2) Memphis (possibly also Sais, Bubastis, Tanis, and other cities 
with east and Avest walls) and the pyramids were built by an invading 
race from aland where the worship was equinoctial. A star rising in 
the east was worshiped at the equinox, 

(3) The blank in Egyptian history between the sixth and eleventh 
dynasties was associated with conflicts between these races, which were 
ended bj^ the victory of the representatives of the old worship of On. 
After them pyraniid building ceased and solstitial worship was resus- 
citated; Memphis takes second place, and Thebes, a southern On, so 
far as solstitial solar worship is concerned, comes upon the scene as the 
seat of the twelfth dynasty. 

(4) The subsequent historical events were largely due to conflicts 
with intruding races. The intruders established themselves in cities 
with east and west walls, and were on each occasion driven out by sol- 
stitial solar worshipers, who founded dynasties (eighteenth and twenty- 
fifth) at Thebes. 

I. — OIJ. 

I have taken another occasion of remarking how the various worships 
at Thebes were reflected in the orientation of the temenos Avails. The 
so-called " symnietrophobia" of the Egyptians was full of meaning, 
Avhich in this case, at all events, is no longer hidden. If we note this 
reflection, as we can over and over again, where both temples and walls 
still stand, it is fair to assume that where the walls ahme remain the 
temples which they once inclosed, long since destroyed, had the same 
relation. These considerations, alas, have to be appealed to in the case 
of Heliopolis, to say so far nothing of Abydos and Memphis. 

At Heliopolis the so-called "symmetrophobia," as indicated by the 
trend of the mounds given in Lepsius's X)lan, is so strong that, in spite 
of the fact that only one obelisk of one temple remains, it is easy to 



* " Histoire aucieune," p. 41. 



THE EARLY TEMPLE AND PYRAMID P,UILDERS. 97 

show that both solstitial solar wors]ii[) and star worshij) were carried 
on, if walls had the same relation to the included temples at On as they 
had at Thebes. 

The solar temple at On has entirely disai)pearod. As may be gath- 
ered ti'om the remains of th<' mounds, it lay in the line of the solstices. 
As the gods included Ra, Atmu, and Osiris, probably like the temple 
of Amen lla at Tliebes, there were two temples back to back. At 
Thebes the temples were directed northwest to southeast, at On south- 
west to northeast. 

My observations of the orientation of the obelisk show that the tem- 
ple of which it formed a part may have possibly been the first of the 
series which includes the temple of Mut at Thebes, and other temples 
there and at Abydos; that is the worship of Set was in question, to 
speak generically. Now, according to Maspero,* Sit or Set formed one 
of the divine dynasties, being associated with the sun and air gods at 
On, i. e., with Ra, Atmu, Osiris, Horus, and Shon. 

At Abydos, as also can be determined by the orientation of the walls, 
one of the oldest temples was probably a solstitial one. The stellar 
temples, sacred to Set, were built much later than the solar temple. 

Like On, Abydos was a sacred city.t '-O'est comme vdle sainte 
qu'elle etait universellement connue. Ses sanctuaires etaient cclebres, 
son dieu Osiris venere, ses fetes suivies par toute I'figypte; les gens 
riches des autres nomes tenaient a honneur de se faire dresser une stele 
dans son temple." | 

If it be found that the references to "ancestors" and "divine ances- 
tors" occur after the eleventh dynasty, the race represented by On may 
be referred to and it nuiy be that so often referred to as the Hor-shesu. 

Only one star temple, as I have said, is still represented at On ; those 
at Abydos are known to be late. The term, then, of Sun-worshippers 
was highly distinctive, and there is reavSon to believe that the stellar 
observations were connected with the solar worship.

Oil the hypothesis these came from a country wliere the worship M'as 
equinoctial. 

We are justified from what is known regarding the rise of the Nile 
as dominating and defining the commencement of the Egyptian year 
that other ancient peoples placed under like conditions would act in 
the same way.

Euphrates were to the early Chaldean empire. Like the Nile, these

valleys were subject to anumil iiiuiidatioiis, and their fertility depended, 
as iu Egypt, upon the manner in which the irrigation was looked 
after. But unlike the Nile, the comiueuceinent of the inundation of these 
rivers took place near the vernal equinox; hence the year, we may 
as!?linie, began then, and, reasoning by analogy, the worship iu all i)rob- 
ability was equinoctial. 

A people entering Eg:ypt from this region, then, would satisfy one 
condition of the problem, but is there any evidence that this peoi)le 
built their solar temples and temple walls east and west, and that they 
also built pyramids'? 

There is ample evidence, although, alas, the structures in Chaldica, 
being generally built in brick and not in stone, no longer remain, as do 
those erected iu Egypt. Still, iu spite of the absence of the possibility 
of a comparative study, research has shown that in the whole region 
to the northeast of Egypt the temenos walls of temples and the walls 
of towns run east and west; and, though at present actual dates can 
not be given, a high antiquity is suggested in the case of some of them. 
Further, the temples which remain in that region where stone was pro- 
curable, as at Palmyra, Baalbec, Jerusalem, all lie east aud west. But 
more than this, it is well known that from the very earliest times pyram- 
idal structures, called ziggurats, some 150 feet high, were erected in 
each imi)ortant city. These were really observatories; they were pyra- 
mids built in steps, as clearly shown from pictures found on contem- 
porary tablets; and one with seven steps and of great antiquity, it is 
known, was restored by Nebuchadnezzar, about <iOO n. c, at Babylon. 

A second condition of the hypothesis is therefore satisfied. 

l>ut did this equinox worshiping, pyramid-building race live at any- 
thing like the time required? Prof. Sayce showed in the Hibbert 
lectures, which were delivered in the year 1887, that recent finds have 
established the existence of a King Sargon I, at Agade in Chaldea, 
3800 B. 0. Hence it seems that a third condition of the hypothesis is 
satisfied by this recent discovery. There Avas undoubtedly an equinox- 
worshiping pyramid-building race existing iu Chaldea at the time the 
Egyptian pyramids are supposed to have been built. 

Hommel, in a recent paper on the Babylonian origin of Egyptian 
culture, shows that the names of the gods corresponded in many cases 
with the names of deities mentioned iu the oldest Egyptian pyramid 
texts. - - The names were represented by exactly the same signs 
in both Babylonian and Egyptian hieroglyphics, - - - the name 
and signs of Osiris the Babylonian Asari are represented in both coun- 
tries by an eye. He contends that there had been a direct communi- 
cation between the two civilizations, and that the Babylonian was the 
older of the two. 

Next let us return to Egypt. We find at Memphis, Sais, Bubastis, 
and Tanis east and w(>st walls, which at once stamp those cities as 
differing in origin from On, Abydos, aud Thebes, where, as I have 



THE EARLY TEMPLE AND PYRAMID BUILDERS. 99 

shown, the walls trend either northwest to southeast or northeast to 
southwest. 

For Memphis, Sais, and Tanis, the evidence is afforded by the maps 
ofLepsius. For Bubastis it depends upon the statement of Naville, 
that the walls run " nearly from east to west," and with the hioseness 
too often associated with such statements, it is not said whether true 
or magnetic bearings are indicated. 

Associated with these east and west walls tliere is further evidence 
of great antiquity. Bubastis, according to Naville,* has afforded traces 
of the <late of Cheops and Chephren, and it is stated by Manetho to 
have existed as early as the second dynasty. 

It is also generally known that the pyramids in Egypt are oriented 
east and west. Nor is this all. One of the oldest, if not the oldest, 
pyramid known, is a step jiyramid modelled on the ziggurat pattern, 
the so-called " step pyramid of kSakkarah." The steps are six in num- 
ber, and vary in height from 38 to 29 feet, their wi<lth being al)out 6 
feet. The dimensions are 352 (north and south) x 39G (east and west) 
X 197 feet. Some authorities think this pyramid Avas erected in the 
first dynasty by the fourth king (Nenephes of Manetho, Ata of the 
tablet of Abydos). The arrangement of chambers in this pyramid is 
quite special. 

The claim to the highest antiquity of the step pyramid is disputed 
by some in favor of the " false pyramid of Mediun. It also is really a 
step pyramid 115 feet high, its outline, which conceals some of the steps, 
shows three stages, 70, 20, and 25 feet high, but in its internal struc- 
ture it is really a stej) pyramid of six stages. 

This pyramid must, according to Petrie, be attributed to Seneferu; 
but De Rouge has given evidence to the contrary. t Seneferu was a 
king of the fourth dynasty. 

We have at Dashour the only remaining abnormal pyramid, called 
the blunted pyramid, lor the reason that the inclination changes at 
about one-third of the height. This pyramid forms one of a group of 
four, two of stone, and, be it carefully borne in mind, two of brick; their 
dimensions are 700x700x320 feet; 020x620x321 feet; 350x350x90 
feet, and 343 x 343 x 156 feet. 

One of these pyramids was formerly sup])osed to have been built by 
Seneferu. If any of them had been erected by King Ousertsen III of 
the twelfth dynasty, as was formerly thought, the hypothesis we are 
considering would have been invalid. 

Only after Seneferu then do we come to the normal Egyptian pyra- 
mid, the two largest at Gizeh, built by Cheops and Chephren (fourth 
dynasty), being, so far as is accurately known, the oldest of the series. 
(According to Mariette, the date of Mini is 5004 b. o., and the fourth 
dynasty commenced in 4235 n. c.)

100 THE EARLY TEMPLE AND PYRAMID BUILDERS. 

Associated with the cities with east and west walls are temples facing 
dne east; fit therefore to receive the rays of the inorniug siiii risiug 
at an equinox. 

Associated with these pyrannds, carefully oriented east and west, we 
find on their eastern sides some distance away and on a line passing- 
through their centers at right angles to a meridian line, temples focing 
due west, the clearest possible indication of equinoctial worship. At 
sunset at the equinox the sepulchral chamber and the sun were in a 
line from the adytum. The i)riest faced a double Osiris. 

In the case of the pyramid of Chephren, not only have we (as 1 hold) 
such a temple of Osiris, but the Sphinx granite temple was most prob- 
ably the crypt of a temple of Isis, its relation to the south face of the 
l)yramid being borne in mind. If this were so, Osiris was a name both 
for the solstitial and equinoctial sun. 

Other pyramids were built at Sakkarah during the sixth dynasty, 
but it is remarkable that such a king as Pepi-Meri-Ea should not have 
imitated the majestic structures of the fourth dynasty. He is said to 
have built a pyramid at Sakkarah, but its obscurity is evidence that 
the pyramid idea was giving way, and it looks as if this dynasty Mere 
really on the side of On,* for the authority of Memphis declined and 
Abydos was preferred, while abroad Sinai was re-conquered and Ethi- 
opia was kept in order.+ 

The sphinx (oriented true east) must also be ascribed to the earliest 
pyramid builders; it could not have been built before their intrusion. 
The Colossi of the plain at Thebes was a subsequent reply of the On 
solstitial worship to it. 

(/>) THE WORSHIP OF THE BULL BY THE PYRAMID BUILDERS. 

There is a subsidiary ])oint in connection with the pyramid builders 
and e(|uinoctial worship. 

The worship of A])is preceded the building of pyramids. IMini is 
credited by Elian with its introduction,! but at any rate Kakau of the 
second dynasty issued i)r<)clamations regarding it,§ and a statue of 
Hapi was in the temple of Cheops.|| 

It is stated that the first month of the Chaldsiean year was dedicated 
to the " propitious bull," and that the figure of a bull constantly occurs 
on the monuments as opening the year. Now the sun at the vernal 
equinox 4500 b. c. was in the constellation Taurus. Biot has shown 
that the equinox occurred with the sun near the pleiades in 3285 b. c.

THE EARLY TEMPLE AND PYRAMID BUILDERS. 101 

We seem driven to the couclusiou that the cousteUatiou of the bull 
dates from this time, and that Hapi represented it.* 

(C) THE ART OF THE PYRAMID BUILDERS. 

Another connecting link is found in the diorite statues found in the 
temple of Chephren, at the pyramids, and at Tell-loh (ancient Sirgulla) 
by M. de Sarzec in 1881. This last find consisted of some large statues 
of diorite, and the attitude chosen was that of Chephren himself as rep- 
resented in the Museum of Gizeh. This indicates e<]uality in the arts 
and the possession of similar tools in Chakhea and Egypt about the 
time in question. 

((/) THE STAR WORSHIP OF THE PYRAMID BUILDERS. 

I have given before the gods of Heliopolis, and have shown that with 
the exception of Sit none are stellar, and that the temple of Sit is still 
represented. But we find in pyramid times the list is vastly changed; 
only the sun gods, Ra, Horus, Osiris, are common to the two. As new 
divinities we find : + 

Isis, ISTephthys, Serk-t, 

Hathor, Ptah, Sokhit. 

Of these the first two and the last two undoubtedly symbolized stars, 
and there can be no question that the temple of Isis at the pyramids 
was built to watch the rising of some of them.| Of Isis and Hathor I 
have already written at length, and I think the stars are now known. 
The others are more doubtful, but it may be that Ptah = Capella and 
Serk-t = Antares. 

But it is also stated .that at Memj)his§ [time not given] there were 
temples dedicated to Soutekh and Baal. Now this is of great impor- 
tance, for I supi^ose there is now no question among Egyi^tologists that 
the gods Set, Sit, Typhon, Bes, Soutekli, Soutkhou are identical. It is 
also equally well known that Soutekli was a god of the Oanaanites;|| 
that the hippoi)otamus, the emblem of Set and Typhon, was the hiero'- 
glyi)h of the Babylonian god Baal, ^ and Bes is identified with Set in 
the book of the dead.** 

* J!^ot only the bull ; there is evidence in favor of the view that the goddess Serk-t=: 
Antares. If so, the scorpion constellation had also been established and both 
equinoxes marked by constellations iu the time of Cheops. 

tMaspero, op. cit., p. 64. 

tThe temple of Sais, as I have said, had east and west walls, and so had Mem- 
phis, according to Lepsius. The form of Isis at Sais was the goddess Neith, which, 
according to some authorities, was the precursor of Athene. The temple of Athene 
at Athens was oriented to the pleiades.

102 THE EARLY TEMPLE AND PYRAMID BUILDERS 

Jensen, in his Kosmologie der Babylonier, p. 16, points out that Bll 
was the name for the poh^ of the equator. If this be the Baal referred 
to by Pierret, we get the most marvellous coincidence between the 
Egyptian and Babylonian star worship and suggestion of a common 
origin among an astronomically minded people. 

This suggests that the founders of On and Memphis had a common 
origin, and the Memphitic intrusion took place after solar solstitial 
worship luid been introduced at On. This worship could not have 
been brought into Egypt from any othei' country bordering on Chal- 
dtea, and its ultimate predominance is the origin of the myth of Horus 
slaying the hippopotamus. Nay, it may be also suggested that the 
l^redominance was brought about by men and ideas reaching On from 
the south, so that the myth had a single celestial and a double terres- 
trial side. 

The Hawk God of Edfu, Harhouditi, had for servants a number of 
individuals called Masniou or Masnitiou=blacksmiths, just as the 
Hawk God of the Delta, Harsiisit, has for his entourage the Shosou 
Horou. Maspero, in a most interesting paper,* has recently called atten- 
tion to some customs still extant among the castes of blacksmiths in 
Central Africa which have suggested to him that the followers of the 
Edfu Horus may have come from that j^roviuce. 

He writes : " C'est du sud de I'l^gypte que les forgerons sont remontes 
vers le nord; leur siege primitif etait le sud de rEgyi)te, la i)artie du 
pays qui a le plus des rapports avec les regions centrales de I'Afrique 
et leurs habitants." 

Then, after stating the i)resent conditions of these workers in equato- 
rial Africa, where they enjoy a high distinction, he concludes: 

"Je pense qu'on peut se representer I'Horus d'Edfou comme etant an 
debut, dans I'une de ses formes, le chef et le dieu'd'une tribu d'ouvriers 
travaillant le metal ou lilutot travaillant le fer. On ue saurait en eft'et 
se dissimuler qu'il y a une aftinite reelle entre le fer et la i)ersonne 
d'Horus en certains mythes. Horus est la face celeste (horou), le ciel, 
le tirmament, et ce firmament est de toute antiquite, uu toit de fer, si 
bien que le fer en prit le nom de ba-na-pit, metal du ciel, metal dont 
est forme le ciel: H(nus faine, Horus d'Edfou, est done en realite uu 
dieu de fer. 11 est, de plus, muni de la picpie ou de la javeline a point 
de fer, et les dieux qui lui sont apparentes, Anhouri, Shou, sont de 
piquiers comme lui, an contraire des dieux du nord de Tl'^gypte, Ba, 
Phtah, etc., qui n'ont pas d'armes a I'ordinaire. La legende <rHarh<)u- 
diti conqueraut I'figypte avec les masniou serait-elle done I'echo ointain 
d'un fait qui se serait passe au tenq^s anterieursa I'histoire? Quelque 
chose comme I'arrivee des Espagnolsau milieu des populations du Nou- 
veau Monde, I'irruption en Egypte de tribus counaissant et em])loyant

d'un dieu belliqueux qui aurait etc uu Horus ou se serait confondu a^ec 
I'Horus des premiers Egyptiens pour former Hardouditi. Ces tribus 
auraieut ete necessairement d'origine Africaine et auraient apj)orte de

III.— THE WORK OF THE ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH DYNASTIES. 

We have next to consider what happened after the great gap in 
Egyptian history between the sixth and twelfth dynasties, 3500 b. c- 
2851 B. c. (Mariette), from Nitocris to Amenemhat I. We pass to the 
Middle Empire. 

Amenemhat 1 built no pyramids, he added no embellishments to 
Memphis, but he took Heliopolis under his care, and now we first hear 
of Thebes.t 

Userteseu I built no pyramids, he added no embellishments to Mem- 
phis, but he also took Heliopolis under his care and added obelisks to 
the temples, one of which remains to this day. Further, he restored 
the temple of Osiris at Abydos and added to the temple of Ameu-Ra 
at Thebes, t 

Surely it is very noteworthy that the first thing the kings of the 
twelfth dynaiSty did was to look after the only three temples in Egypt 
of which traces exist, which 1 have shown to have been oriented to 
the solstice. It is right however to remark that there seems to have 
been a mild recrudescence of pyramid building toward the end of the 
twelfth dynasty, and immediately preceding the Hyksos period, whether 
as a precurser of that period or not. 

Usertesen's views about his last home have come down to us in a 

*The Horus of Edfou was represeuted as the chief and god of a tribe working in 
metal, more especially in iron. There is no doubt that in certain myths there is a 
connection between the person of Horus and iron. Florus represented the sky, the 
firmament; in antiquity the sky was thought to be a roof of irou, so nuich so that 
the Egjqitians called irou the sky metal. Horus usually cai'ried an irou poiuted 
pike or javelin, as do the allied gods Anhouri and Shou, while the gods of the north 
of Egypt, Ra, Phtah, etc., are unarmed. Is uot the legeud of Horhouditi coucjueriug 
Egypt with the help of the uuisuiou (blacksmiths), an echo of au event which occurred 
in the prehistoric period of Egypt. Comparable to the arrival of the Spaniards in 
North America, was the iuvasion into Egypt of tribes knowing and using iron, having 
among them a special caste of smiths, who brought with them the cult of a warlike 
god, who they either called Horus or identified with the Plorus of the early Egyptian 
afterwards named Horhouditi. These tribes were of coarse of African origin, and 
they brought new African elements to those already contained in the civilizatiou of 
the lower Nile. The smiths by and by lost their ancient privileges as they were 
gradually merged in the rest of the population ; only at Edfou and in the towns which 
practiced the cult of the Horus of Edfou did they preserve a sacred character, being 
transformed into a kind of domestic religious class, i. e., the mamiiou of the myth of 
Horus, companions and servants of the warlike god.

There was uotliiug pyramidal about this idea, but one hundred and 
tifty years later we find Amenemhat III returning both to the gigantic 
irrigation works and the pyramid building of the earlier dynasties. 

The scene of these labors was the Fayyum, where, to crown the 
new work, two ornamental i^yramids were built, surmounted by statues, 
and finally the king himself was buried in a pyramid near the Laby- 
rinth. 

IV.— THE WORK OF THE EIGHTEENTH DYNASTY. 

The blank in Egyptian history between the twelfth and eighteenth 
dynasties is known to have been associated with the intrusion of the 
so-called Hyksos. It is supposed these made their way into Egypt 
from the countries in and to the west of Mesopotamia. It is known 
that they settled in the cities with east and west walls. They were 
finally driven out by Aahmes, the king of solstitial solar Thebes, who 
began the eighteenth dj'nasty. 

Ill {a) 1 have shown what happened after the first great break in 
Egyptian history — a resuscitation of the solstitial worship at On, Aby- 
dos, and Thebes. 

I have next to show that precisely the same thing happened after 
the Hyksos period (Dyn. 13 (?).Mariette, 2233 Brngsch; Dyn. 18, 1703 
B. c. Marietta) had disturbed history for some five hundred years. 

It is known from the ])apyrus Sellier (CI. Co 257) that Aahmes, the 
first king of the eighteenth dynasty, who re-established the independ- 
ence of Egypt, was in reality fighting the priests of Soutekh in favor 
of the priests of Amen-Ra, the solstitial solar god, a modern rei^resent- 
ative of Atmu of On. 

Amen-Ra, was the successor of Menthu, the successor of Atmu of On. 
So close was the new worship to the oldest at On, that at the highest 
point of Theban power the third priest of Amen took the same titles as 
the Grand Priest of On, " who was the head of the first priesthood in 
Egypt." t The "Grand Priest of On," who was also called the " Great 
Observer of Ra and Atmu," had the privilege of entering at all times 
into the Habeuben or Naos. The priest Padouamen, whose mummy 
was found in 1891, bore these among his other titles. 

The assumption of the title was not only to associate the Theban 
priesthood with their northern confreres, but surely to proclaim that 
the old On worship was completely restored.

THE EARLY TEMPLE AND PYRAMID BUILDERS. 105 
V. — THE WORK OF THE TWENTY-FIFTH DYNASTY. 

There was another invasion from Syria, which founded the twenty- 
second dynasty, and again the government is carried on in cities with 
east and west walls (Sais, Tanis, andBubastis). The solstitial solar 
priests of Thebes withdraw to Ethiopia. They return, however, in 700 
B. c, drive out the Syrian invaders, and, under Shabaka and Taharga, 
found a dynasty (the twenty-fifth) at Thebes, and embellish the solsti- 
tial solar temples there. 

VI. — ANTHROPOLOaiCAL EVIDENCE. 

It will be seen then that a general survey of Egyptian history does 
suggest conflict between two races, and this, of course, goes to 
strengthen the view that the temple building phenomena suggest two 
different w^orships, depending upon race distinctions. 

V\e have next to ask if there is any anthropological evidence at our 
disposal. It so happens that Yirchow has directed his attention to 
this very point.* 

Premising that a strong race distinction is recognized between i^eo- 
ples having brachycephalic or short, and dolichocephalic or long, skulls, 
and that the African races belong to the latter group, I may give the 
following extract from his paper: 

"The craniological type in the ancient empire was different from that 
in the middle and new. The skulls from the ancient empire are brachy- 
cephalic, those from the new and of the present day are either dolcho- 
cephalic or mesaticephalic; the difference is therefore at least as 
great as that between the dolichocephalc skulls of the Frankish graves 
and the predominantly brachycephalic skulls of the present population 
of South Germany. I do not deny that we have hitherto had at our 
disposal only a very limited luimber of skulls from the ancient empire 
which have been certainly determined; that therefore the question 
whether the brachycephalic skull-type deduced from these was the 
general or at least the predominant one can not yet be answered with 
certainty, but I may appeal to the fact that the sculptors of the ancient 
empire made the brachycephalic type the basis of their Avorks of art, 
too." 

It will be seen then that the anthropological as well as the histor- 
ical evidence "runs on all fours" with the results to be obtained from 
such a study of the old astronomy as the temples afford us.

VARIABLE STARS.* 



By Prof. C. A. Young. 



For the most part the stars maiiitaiu their places aud brightness 
apparently unchanged; the heavens of today are substantially the 
same as those of Job and Homer. The comparison of a modern star 
catalogue with that of Hipparchus as preserved by Ptolemy shows that 
with few and generally slight exceptions the principal stars still bold 
the same relative positions and the same rank in brightness which they 
did two thousand years ago. And yet we know that all the time they 
have been swiftly moving in all directions at rates sometimes exceed- 
ing 100 miles a second — some approaching us and some receding. 
Then, too, they have all been growing old together, some advancing 
from stellar infancy toward adult vigor, and some descending toward 
extinction. The apparent i:)ermaneuce is apparent only, — due simply to 
the fact that the scale of human life and all our terrestrial surround- 
ings is practically infinitesimal as compared with that of the stellar 
universe. Ev^eu the nearest star is so remote that if it were rushing 
directly toward us with the speed of 100 miles a second it would gain 
in brightness only about 2i iier cent in a century, an amount barely 
observable by our best ])botometers. As to changes due merely to 
advancing age, a century bears only some such ratio to the lifetime of 
a star as a single minute to that of an aged man. 

But while all this is true there are several hundred stars T>hich are 
known as " variables," and undergo considerable changes of bright- 
ness, sometimes quite rapidly. They form the subject of a most inter- 
esting and important chapter in astronomy, — a chapter which may be 
regarded as opened by Tycho's observations of the marvellous star of 
1572, but even yet only begun ; in fact, nearly all the systematic work 
that has been done in this line has been accomplished within the last 
sixty years. 

These "variables" may be roughly classified as follows: First, we 
have a few stars that seem to be gradually, and more or less steadily, 
growing brighter or fainter, judging from their present rank as com- 
pared with that which they used to hold; Alpha Geminorum is a case

108 VARIABLE STARS. 

in point, being now distinctly faiuter than its neighbor, Beta, although 
presumably when Bayer assigned the letters, about three hundred 
years ago, the reverse was the case. A second <dass consists of those 
wiiich oscillate in brightness, but without any api)arent regularity, 
like Eta Argus, and Alpha Orionis. The third class is made up of the 
so-called "temporary stars," stars which suddenly shine out and after 
a few months disappear or become very faint. There have been about 
a dozen instances of this iiind, the last being the "new star in Auriga,^'' 
which appeared in 1892. The fourth class, and by far the most numer- 
ous, is made up of those which vary periodically in brightness in a 
manner which admits of mathematical prediction. Among these 
periodic stars, at least three subclasses are to be distinguished: {a) 
Those which at regular intervals brighten up for a comparatively short 
time and then fall back to their normal condition until the next maxi- 
mum. These are often referred to as the " Omicron Geti type," 
because that star usually called Mira, or the "wonderful," is the most 
conspicuous and longest known of all that belong to it. The majority 
of the periodic stars belong to this sub-class, and geuerally repeat 
their changes about once a year, though their periods range all the 
way from one hundred and ten days to six hundred and ten. {b) The 
second sub-class includes the stars which, like Beta Lyra', are in a 
continual state of activity; they often present more than one maxi- 
mum of brightness within a single complete period, which is usually 
somewhere between five days and sixty, (c) Finally, we have the ten 
stars of the so-called ^^ Algol type," which behave in a manner pre- 
cisely the opposite of that of the stars of th.e first sub-class, i. e., they 
undergo periodical diminutions or eclipses of their light, remaining 
for the remainder of the time steadily bright. Their periods are 
always short, ranging from seven hours to ten days. The type of the 
class is Beta Perscl, better known as Algol. 

The variations of the stars of this class can be very simply explained 
as merely due to actual eclipses, and the truth of this explanation has 
been practically established within the last three years by the spectro- 
scopic work of Vogel, at Potsdam, Tiie period of Algol is a trifle under 
sixty-nine hours, and the photographs show that seventeen hours before 
the obscuration the lines of its spectrum are displaced toward the red 
by an amount which indicates that it is then receding from us at the 
rate of about 27 miles a second, while seventeen hours after the obscu- 
ration it is found to be approaching at the same rate; in short, the 
observations pro\e that the star is moving in an orbit nearly circular, 
a little more than 2,0(M>,000 miles in diameter, and lying in a plane 
nearly i^assing through the observer. Now if the periodical obscura- 
tion is really caused by the interposition of an eclii)siug body, the 
bright star must necessarily circulate around the common center of 
gravity between itself and its dusky attendant in just this sort of way, 
and the detection of such motion falls little short of a demonstration of 



VARIABLE STARS. 109 

tlie liy])othesis. We may go further; taking into account the fact that 
the whole "eclipse" lasts for about eight hours, and that the star loses 
about two- thirds of its light at the time of maximum obscuration (when 
the brightness remains without change for about twenty minutes), it 
can be safely inferred that the dark attendant is just about four-fifths 
the diameter of the bright star and about half as heavy. Also that 
the distance between the two is about 3,250,000 miles, the diameters of 
the two bodies being respectively about 1,060,000 and 840,000 miles. 
Moreover, the combined mass of the two is about two thirds that of the 
sun, and their density only one-flfth as great, not much exceeding that 
of cork. 

Nor is this all ; since the discovery of the variability of the star in 
1782, a slight but distinct variation of the period has been observed, of 
such a character as to set the times of eclipse alternately backAvard and 
forward by about two hours and a half in the interval between 1804 and 
1809. From this, combined with certain minute irregularities in the 
" proper motion " of the star, Mr. Chandler two years ago showed that 
Algol and its companion must be moving together in a great orbit, 
nearly as large as that of the planet Uranus, completing the revolution 
in a period of about one hundred and thirty years; at least, such a revo- 
lution would account for the facts, while no other hypothesis yet proposed 
will do so. And if this revolution is real, it must be around some neigh- 
boring body, so laintly luminous that it has not yet been detected. The 
story of Algol opens up to' us a new universe of "dark stars" — bodies 
invisible, but massive and powerful. Presumably the other stars of the 
Algol class admit of a similar explanation, although as yet they have not 
been spectroscopically studied, being all of them small a-nd too faint for 
investigation with the instruments at present available. When the great 
Yerkes telescope, nownearing completion, is mounted at Lake Geneva it 
is expected that one of its earliest aj)plications will be to investigations 
of this sort. It should be added also that certain peculiarities in the 
light curves of some of these stars seem to indicate that we have not 
quite reached the bottom of the matter; that in addition to the eclipse, 
and perhaps caused by it, there are real variations in the light-giving 
power of the star. 

As to the other classes of variables, there is no such satisfactory 
explanation nor any generally received theory. In the case of Beta 
Lyra>, and its congeners, we have apparently mechanical and other 
causes combined — the axial revolution of a star, perhaps, or possibly 
the whirling of a group of stars, accompanied by tidal changes in the 
brightness and spectroscopic characteristics of their light, for while 
the minima of the Algol variables are not accompanied by any altera- 
tion of the character of the lines in their spectra, it is not so with the 
other variables; their spectra are almost all of them characterized by 
bright lines, which become especially brilliant at the time of maximum 
brightness. Beta Lynv presents conspicuously in its spectrum both 



110 VARIABLE STARS. 

briglit and dark lines, due to hydrogen; and tliese shift back and forth 
with reference to each other in such a way as apparently to indicate 
the presence of two or more bodies whirling- around each other, one of 
them giving the ordinary dark-line si)ectrum and the other the bright- 
line spectrum of the gas. 

The stars of the first and much the most numerous sub-class are 
nearly all distinctly red and show in their spectra the bright lines of 
hydrogen, but do not as yet furnish any certain evidence that their 
periodicity is of a mechanical origin due; that is, to a revolution of 
some sort. I'ossibly the explanation proposed by Lockyer may ulti- 
mately be verified — that the sudden evolution of light is due to the 
collision between two swarms of meteors which revolve around their 
common center of gravity, and brush against each other as they pass 
their perihelion point. But the periodicity of this class of variables is 
hardly regular enough to suit this exphmation, and the sudden out- 
burst of the bright lines in the si)ectrum of a star suggests rather some 
such action, though on a vastly grander scale, as that which causes the 
sun spots and the solar prominences, — causes operating within the star 
itself. 

As to the " temi)(>rary stars" opinion is much divided. On the one 
hand Lockyer and his numerous followers attribute tlie phenomena to 
the collision of swarms of meteors, while on the other Huggins and 
Vogel are disposed to assimilate them to the solar eruptions. The 
latest instance of the kind, the " Nova Aurig* " already alluded to, 
which appeared in February, 1892, has been most exhaustively studied 
by a great number of observers. It is agreed on all hands that at 
first its spectrum was full of bright lines, and dark lines also; and that 
among these lines those of hydrogen, both bright and dark, were spec- 
ially conspicuous, just as in the spectrum of Beta Lynv; and more- 
over, that the bright lines were so shifted towards the red end of the 
spectrum with respect to the dark lines as to indicate the tremendous 
relative velocity of more than 500 miles a second in the two masses to 
which the lines were respectively due. As to the other lines there was 
dispute. Lockyer maintained that they were the same that are found 
in the nebula'; other observers, no dou])t correctly, identified them 
with certain lines which are conspicuous in the spectrum of the solar 
chromosphere in every important eruption. The star faded to apparent 
extinction in April, 1892, but most unexpectedly brightened up again 
the following August, though not so as to be seen with the naked eye; 
with the telescope it is still visible. Its spectrum, however, has under- 
gone a remarkable transformation, many of the lines which were 
formerly most coiisi)icuous having disappeared, while others have taken 
their place, so that at present it is unquestionably a nebular si)ectrum. 
As Mr. Campbell, of the Lick Observatory, who has perhaps the best 
right to speak authoritatively, puts it, "The lines of the present 
spectrum do not occuj^y the positions of the lines in the February 



VARIABLE STARS, 111 

spectrum, nor the positions of the lines in the solar clnomosphere, nor 
the positions of the lines in the spectra of any of the bright-lines stars; 
they do occupy the positions of the lines in the nebuljc, and the spec- 
trum resembles nebultv spectra as closely as well known nebulae 
spectra resemble each other." This is said in answer to some high 
authorities who find it difficult to admit so surprising a fact as such a 
transformation. It certainly looks as if we had to do with a reversion 
of the ordinary couise of stellar development; instead of the forma- 
tion of a star by the slow condensation of a nebula, we seem to have 
the sudden formation of a nebula by the violent explosion of a star. 
But sjjeculation on so small a basis of fact is hardly sound. 

I must not close without a reference to the important, though unpre- 
tending, catalogue of variable stars just published by Mr. Chandler, 
of Cambridge, who, smce the death of Schonfeld, may be regarded as 
at the head of the department of variable stars, so far at least as relates 
to the mathematical aspects of the subject. The first step to any real 
mastery of it must be an accurate collection of facts, such as this cata- 
logue embodies. It gives a list of all the stars which are certainly 
known at present to be variable, 200 in number (02 of them naked-eye 
stars), and adds a subsidiary list of 100 more which are more or less 
strongly suspected. Of the 200, about 35 are known to be irregular 
and unpredictable in their variations, and about as many more are 
still in doubt as regards the periodicity of their changes. The remain- 
ing 190 are clearly periodic, and Mr. Chandler gives for each of them 
the formula by means of which its variations can be predicted, thus 
embodying in a few modest figures the result of an enormous amount 
of skillful labor. Ten of the variables belong to the Algol class, about 
25 to that of Beta Lynv, and the rest resemble Omieron Ccti more or 
less perfectly. It shouhl be added also that the list of variables is 
constantly growing — chiefiy, of course, among the telescopic stars. 



THE LUMIMFEROUS .ETHER.* 



By Sir George G, Stokes. 



I intend to bring before you to-uiglit a subject which the study of 
light has caused me to think a good deal about: I refer to the nature 
and properties of the so-called luminiferous iiether. This subject is, in 
one respect, specially fascinating, scientifically considered. It lies, we 
may say, in an especial manner on the borderland between what is 
known and what is unknown. In the study of it, it is quite conceivable 
that great discoveries may be made, and in fact great discoveries 
have already been made, and I may say even quite recently, and we 
do not at present know how much additional light on the system of 
Nature may be in store for the men of science; jjossibly even in the 
near future, possibly not until many generations have passed away. 
I will assume, as what is familarly known to you all, and what is well 
established by methods into which 1 will not enter, that the heavenly 
bodies are at an immense distance from our earth. More especially is 
this the case with the fixed stars. Their distance is so enormous that 
even when we take as a base line, so to speak, the diameter of the 
earth's oibit, which we know to be about 184:,000,000 of miles, the 
apparent displacement of the stars due to j)arallax is so minute as 
almost to elude our investigation. jSTevertheless that distance is more 
or less accurately determined in the case of a few of the fixed stars. 
But the vast majority, as we have every reason to believe, are at such 
an enormous distance that even this method fails with them. 

To give a conception of the immense distance of the fixed stars, I 
will assume as known that light travels at the rate of about 186,000 
miles in one second, a rate which would carry it nearly eight times 
round and round the earth in that time; and yet if we take the star 
which, so far as we know, is our nearest neighbor, it Avould take about 
four years for light from that star to reach the eartli. Now as we 
see the fixed stars there must be some link of connection between us 
and them in order that we should be able to perceive them. Probably 
all of you know that two theories have been put forward as to the 
nature of light, as to the nature accordingly of that connection of

114 THE LUMINIFEROUS ^.THER. 

which 1 have spoken. According to one idea, light is a vsnbstnnce 
darted forth from the luminous body with an amazing velocity; accord- 
ing to the other, it consists m a change of state taking place, propa- 
gated through a medium, as it is called, intervening l)etween the body 
from which the light proceeds and the eye of the observer. For a con- 
siderable time the first of these theories was that chiefly adopted by 
scientific men. It was that, as you know, which Newton himself adopted ; 
and probably the prestige of his name had nmch to do with the favor- 
able reception which for a long time it received. But more recent 
researches have so completely established the truth of the other view, 
and refuted the old doctrine of emissions, that it is now universally 
hehl by scientitic men that light consists in an undulatory movement 
propagated in a medium existing in all the space through which light 
is capable of passing. 

This necessity for filling all space, or at least such an inconceivably 
great extent of space, with a medium, the office of which, so far as was 
known in the first instance, was simply that of propagating light, was 
an obstacle for a time to the reception by the minds of some of the 
theory of* undulations. Men had been in the habit of regarding the 
inter-planetary and inter-stellar space as a vacuum, and it seemed too 
great an assuini)tion to fill all this supposed vacuous space with some 
kind of medium for the sole purpose of transmitting light. Notwith- 
standing, even long ago strong oi)inions were entertained to the eftect 
that there must be something intervening between the difterent heav- 
enly bodies. In a letter to Beiitley, Newton expresses himself in very 
strong language to this effect: "That gravity should be innate, inher- 
ent and essential to matter, so that one body may act upon another at 
a distance through a vacuum, without the mediation of anything else, 
by and thr<mgh which their action and force may be conveyed from 
one to another, is to me so great an absurdity that I believe that no 
man who has in philoso])hical matters a comiietent faculty of thinking, 
can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an agent acting con- 
stantly according to certain fixed laws; but whether this agent be 
materiai or immaterial, I have left to the consideration of my readers." 

What the^-uature of the connection between the earth and the sun, 
for example, may be whereby the sun is able to attract the earth and 
thereby keep it in its orbit — in other words, what the cause of gravi- 
tation may be — we do not know; for anything we know to the ccmtrary, 
it may be connected with this intermediate medium or luminiferous 
a'ther. There are other offices, we believe, which this luminiferous 
a'ther fulfills, to which I shall have occasion to allude presently. 

In connection with the necessity for filling such vast regions of space 
with this medium, a curious cpiestion naturally i)resents itself. We 
can not conceive of space as other than infinite, but we habitually think 
of matter as occni^ying here or there limited portions of space, as for 
examx)le the different heavenly bodies. The intervening space we 



THE LUMINIFEROUS ^THER. 115 

commonly think of as a vacuum, and it is only the phenomena of lif^ht 
that led us iu the first instance to think ot it as filled with some kind 
of material. The question naturally presents itself to the mind — is this 
R'ther absolutely infinite like space? This is a question to which 
science can give no answer. Though we can not help thinking of space 
as infinite, yet when we turn our thoughts to some material existing in 
space perhaps we more readily think of it as finite than infinite. But 
if the icther, however vast the portion of space over which it extends, 
be really limited, we can hardly fail to speculate what there may be 
outside its limits. Space there might be wholly vacuous, or possibly 
outside altogether this vast system of stars and aether there may be 
another system subject to the same laws, or subject to different laws, 
as the case may be, ecpially vast in extent; and if there be, then so far 
as we can gather from such phenomena as are open to our investiga- 
tion, there can be no communieation between that vast ])ortion of 
space in part of which we live and an ideal system altogether outside 
the pether of which we have been speaking. 

But the properties of the aether are no less remarkable than its vast 
or even possibly limitless extent. Matter of which our senses give us 
any cognisance is heavy, that is to say, it gravitates toward other 
matter which agrees with it in so far as being accessible to our senses. 
The question presents itself to the mind, does the jether gravitate 
toward what we call ponderable matter? This is a question to which 
wciare not able to give any positive scientific answer. If the u'ther be 
in some way or other connected with the cause of gravitation it would 
seem more likely that it itself does not gravitate toward ponderable 
matter. 

Again, we have very strong reason for believing that ponderable 
matter consists of ultimate molecules. First, that supposition accords 
in the simplest way with the laws of crystallogra])hy. Chemical laws 
afford still stronger confirmation of the hypothesis, through the atomic 
theory of Dalton, now universally accepted. Comparatively recently, 
the deduction of the fundamental property of gases from the kinetic 
theory, as it is called, affords strong additional confirmation of that 
view of the constitution of matter. Still more recently, the explana- 
tion which has been afforded by that theory of that most remarkable 
iiistrumentthe "radiometer" of Crookes has lent further confirmation in 
the same direction. None of these evidences apply to the a'ther, and 
accordingly we are left in doubt whether it too consists of ultimate 
molecules, or whether on the other hand it is continuous, as we can not 
help conceiving space to be. 

The undulatory theory of light was greatly j)romoted m the first 
instance by the know n idienomena of sound, and the explanation which 
they received from the hydro-dynamical theory. Accordingly, since 
sound, as we know, consists of an undulatory movement propagated 
through the air (or it may be through other media), and depending 



116 THE LUMINIFEROUS .ETHER. 

upon condensation and rarefaction, it was supposed naturally that 
light was propagated in a similar nianuer, by virtue of the forces brought 
into play by the condensation and rarefaction of the tether. But there 
IS one whole class of phenomena which have actually no counterpart 
in those of sound: I refer to polarization and double refraction. 

The evidence for the truth of the theory of undulatums as regards 
the phenomena of common light depends in great measure upon the 
fact of interference and the explanation which the theory gives of the 
complicated phenomena of diffraction. But in studying the interfer- 
ence of polarized light, additional phenomena presented themselves 
which ultimately pointed out that the vibrations with which we are 
concerned in the case of the aether differ altogether in their character 
from those which belong to sound. The phenomena of the interference 
of polarized light prove incontestably that there exists in light an 
element t)f some kind having relation to directions transverse to that 
of propagation, and admitting of composition and resolution in a plane 
perpendicular to the direction of transmission according to the very 
same laws as those of the composition and resolution of forces, or 
velocities, or displacements in such a plane. This reijuires us to 
attribute to the a'ther a constitution altogether different from that of 
air. It points out the existence of a sort of elasticity whereby the 
tether tends to check the gliding of one layer over another. Have we 
no extimple of such a force in the case of ponderal)Ie matter ? We have. 
We know that an elastic solid, which for simplicity 1 will suppose to 
be uncrysttilline, and alike in all directions, has two kinds of elasticity, 
by one of which it, like air, tends to resist compression txnd rarefaction; 
while by the other it tends to resist a continuous gliding of one portion 
over another, and to restore itself to its primitive state if such a 
gliding has taken place. There is no direct relation between the 
mtignitude of these two kinds of elasticity, and in the case of an elastic 
solid such as jelly the resistance to compression is enormously great 
compared to the resistance to a gliding displacement. 

If we assume thtxt in the tether there is really an elasticity tending to 
restore it to its primitive condition when one Itiyer tends to glide over 
another, an elasticity which it ap])ears to be tibsolutely necessary to 
admit in order to account for the observed laws of interference of polar- 
ized light, the (piestion arises, can we thereby explain double refrac- 
tion ? 

The earliest attempts to explain it in txccordiince with the theory of 
transverse vibrations were made by attributing to the tether a moleciihir 
constitution more or less aimlogous to that which we believe to exist in 
ponderable mtitter. Following out speculations founded upon that 
view, the celebrated Fresnel was led to the discovery of the actual 
laws of double refraction ; the theory however which he gtive was by 
no means complete, inasmuch as the results were not rigorously deduced 
from the premises, Oauchy and Neumann, independently and about 



THE LUMINIFEROUS ^THER. 117 

simultaneously, tooku^) Fresuel's view of the coustitutiou of the iether 
aud applied it to exi)lain the laws of double refraction. In their theory 
the conclusions arrived at were rigorously derived from the premises; 
but the results did not altogether agree with observation; that is to 
say, although they could by the adoption of certain sui)i)ositions be 
forced into a near accordance with the observed laws of double refrac- 
tion, yet they pointed out the necessity of the existence of other phe- 
nomena which were belied by observation. Our own countryman Green 
was the first to deduce Fresnel's laws from a rigorous dynamical theory; 
although nearly simultaneously, MacCullagh arrived at a theory in 
some respects similar, though on the whole I think less satisfactory. 

Still all these theories followed j)retty closely the analogy of ponder- 
able matter; and at least in the first three mentioned the iiether was 
even imagined to consist of discrete molecules, acting on one another, 
like the bodies of the solar system regarded as points, by forces in the 
direction of the joining line, and varying as some function of the dis- 
tance. I have already quoted the very strong language in which New- 
ton rejected the idea of the heavenly bodies acting on one another 
across intervening si^aces which were absolutely void. But the concep- 
tion has nothing to do with the magnitude of the intervening spaces; 
and the conception of action at a distance across an intervening space 
which is absolutely void, is not a bit easier when the space in question 
is merely that separating two adjacent molecules, when the a?ther is 
thought of as consisting of discrete molecules, than it is when the space 
is that separating two bodies of the solar system, though in this latter 
case it may amount to many millions of miles. If the tether be in some 
unknown manner the link of connection whereby two heavenly bodies 
are enabled to exert on one another the attraction of gravitation, then 
according to the hypothetical constitution of the aether that we have 
been considering, we seem comftelled to invent an lether of the second 
order, so to speak, to form a link of connection between two separate 
molecules of the luminiferous a*ther. But since the nature of the a'ther 
is so very different as it must be from that of i^onderable matter, it may 
be that the true theory must proceed ui^on lines in which our previous 
conceptions derived from the study of ponderable matter are in great 
measure departed from. 

If we think of the tether as a sort of gigantic jelly, we can hardly 
imagine but that it would more or less resist the passage of the heav- 
enly bodies — the planets for instance — through it. Yet there appears 
to be no certain indication of any such resistance. It has been 
observed indeed in the case of Encke's comet, that at successive revo- 
lutions the comet returned to its perihelion a little before the calcu- 
lated time. This would be accounted for by the supposition that it 
experienced a certain amount of resistance from the aether. Although 
at first sight we might be disposed to say that such a resistance would 
retard perihelion passage, yet the fact that it would accelerate it 



118 THE LUMINIFEROUS ^THER. 

becomes easily intelligible, if we consider that the resistance experi- 
enced would tend to check its motion, and so prevent it from getting 
away so far from tlie sun at aphelion, and would consequently bring it 
more nearly into the condition of a planet circulating round the sun in 
a smaller orbit. 

Many years ago I asked the highest authority in this country on 
physical astronomy, the late Prof. Adams, what he thought of the evi- 
dence afforded by Encke's comet for the existence of a retarding force, 
such as nught arise from the aitlier. He said to me that he thought we 
did not know enough as to whether there might not possibly be a planet 
or planets within the orbit of Mercury which would account for it in a 
different way. But quite independently of such a supposition it is 
worthy of note that the remarkable phenomena presented by the tails 
of comets render it by no means unlikely that even without the presence 
of a resisting medium, and without the disturbing force arising from 
the attraction of an unknown planet situated so near to the sun as not 
to have been seen hitherto, the motion of the head of a comet might 
not be (piite the same as that of a simple body representing the nucleus, 
and being subject to the gravitation of the sun and planets and noth- 
ing else. It appears that the tails consist of some kind of miitter 
driven from the comet with an enormons velocity by a sort of re|)ulsion 
emanating from the sun. If the nucleus loses in this manner at each 
])erihelion passage an exceedingly small portion of its mass, which is 
repelled from the sun, it is possible that the residiu* may expericnci* an 
attraction towards the sun over and above that due to gra\itati(»n, and 
that possibly this may be the cause of the observed acceleration in the 
tinn^ of passing perihelion even though there be no resistance on the 
])art of the jetlier. So that the (juestion of resistance or no resistance 
must be left an open one. 

The supposition that the icther would resist in this manner a body 
moving through it is derived from what we observe in the case of solids 
moving through fluids, liquid or gaseous, as the case may be. In ordi- 
nary cases of resistsmce, the main represent,! five of the work ai)par- 
ently lost in propelling the solid is in the first instance the molecular 
kinetic energy of the trail of eddies in the wake. The formation of 
these eddies is however an indirect effect of the internal friction, or 
if we prefer the term — viscosity, of the fluid. Now the viscosity of gases 
has been explained on the kinetic theory of gases, and in the case of a 
liquid we cannot well doubt that it is connected with the constitution 
of the substance as not being absolutely continuous but molecular. 
But if the a'ther be either non-molecular, or molecular in some totally 
different sense from jionderable matter, we cannot with safety infer 
that the motion of a wSolid through it necessarily inq)lies resistance. 

The luminiferous a'ther touches on another mysterious agent, the 
nature of which is unknown, although its laws are in many respects 
known, and it is applied to the every-day wants of life, and its appli-

cations are even regulated by Acts ofParliameut; I allude to electric- 
ity. I said that the nature of electricity is unknown. More than forty 
years ago I was sitting at dinner beside the illustrious Faraday, and I 
said to him that 1 thought a great step would have been made if we 
could say of electricity something analogous to what we say of light, 
when we affirm that liglit consists of undulations; and he said to me 
that he thought we were a long way off that at present. But, as I said 
relations have recently been discovered between light and electricity 
which lead us to believe that the latter is most closely connected with 
the lumiuiferous icther. 

Clark-Maxwell showed that the ratio of two electrical constants 
(which are capable of being determined by laboratory experiments, and 
which are of such a nature that that ratio expresses a velocity) agrees 
with remarkable accuracy with the known vehx-ity of light. This 
formed the starting-point of the electromagnetic theory of light which 
is so closelv associated with the name of Maxwell. 



ATOMS AND STTNP.EAMS.* 



Bv Sir Robert 1 5 all, V. 11. S. 



In recent years an important change has taken phice in the manner 
in which many physical problems are approached. The philosopher 
who now seeks an explanation of great natural x)henomena not unfre- 
qnently finds much assistance from certain remarkable discoveries as to 
the ultimate constitution of matter. Many an obscure question in 
physics has been rendered clear when some of the properties of mole- 
cules have been brought to light. No d(mbt our knowledge of the 
natural history of the molecule is still vastly wanting in detail. It 
must however be admitted that we have traced an outline of that 
wonderful chapter in nature which is specially serviceable in the (jues- 
tion which I now i^ropose to discuss. 

The iiroblem before us may be stated in the following terms. We 
have to illustrate how the sun is enabled to maintain its tremendous 
expenditure of light and heat without giving any signs of npiiproaching 
exhaustion. It will be found that the atomic theory of the constitu- 
tion of matter exhibits the mechanism of the process by which that 
capacity of the great luminary for supplying the radiation so vital to 
the welfare of mankind is sustained from age to age. 

Let me here anticipate an objection which may not improbably be 
raised. Those who have paid attention to this subject are aware that 
the remarkable doctrine first propounded by Helndioltz removed all 
real doubt from the matter. It is to this eminent philosopher we owe 
an explanation of what at hrst seemed to be a paradox. He explained 
how, notwithstanding that the sun radiates its heat so profusely, no 
indications of the inevitable decline of heat can be as yet discovered. 
If the sun luul been nnide of solid coal from center to surface, and if 
that coal had been burned for the purpose of sustaining the radiation, 
it can be demonstrated that a few thousand years of solar exxienditure 
at the present rate would suffice to exhaust all the heat which the com- 
bustion of that great si)here of fuel could generate. We know how 
ever that the sun has been radiating heat, not alone for thousands of 
years, but for millions of years. The existence of fossil plants and ani- 
mals would alone suffice to demonstrate this fact. We have thus to

122 ATOMS AND SUNBEAMS. 

account for tlie extremely remarkable circumstance that our great 
luminary has radiated forth already a thousand times as nuich heat as 
could be generated by the combustion of a sphere of coal as big as the 
sun is at present, and yet, notwithstanding this expenditure in the 
past, physics declares that for millions of years to come the sun nmy 
continue to dispense light and heat to its attendant worlds with the 
same abundant prodigality. To have shown how the apparent para- 
dox could be removed is one of the most notable achievements of the 
great German philosopher. 

What Helmoltz did was to refer to the obvious fact that the expendi- 
ture of heat by radiation must necessarily lead to shrinkage of the 
solar volume. This shrinkage has the effect of abstracting from a store 
of potential energy m the sun and transforming what it takes into the 
active form of heat. The transformation advances pari passu with the 
radiation, so that the loss of heat arising from the radiation is restored 
by the newly produced heat derived from the lateut reservoir. Such is 
an outline of the now famous doctrine universally accepted among 
physicists. It fulfils the conditions of the problem, and when tested 
by arithmetical calculation it is not found wanting. 

But the genuine student of nature loves to get to the heart of a great 
problem like this. He loves to be able to follow it, not through mere 
formulic or abstract j)rinciples, but so as to be able to visualise its truth 
and feel its certainty. He will tlierefore often desire something in 
addition to the bare presentation of the theory as above stated. It 
may be no doubt sufiicient for the mathematician to know that the total 
potential energy in the sun, due to the dispersed nature of its materi- 
als, is so vast that as contraction brings the materials, on the whole, 
somewhat nearer together, the potential energy thus surrendered is 
transformed into a supply of heat (piite adequate to compensiite for the 
losses arising from the radiation by which the contraction was pro- 
duced. The student who admits — and who is there that does not 
admit? — the doctrine of the conservation of energy, knows that in this 
argument he is on thoroughly reliable ground. At the same time the 
argument does not actually offer any very clear conception, or indeed 
any conception at all, of the precise modus operandi by which, as the 
active i)oteiitial energy vanishes, its equivalent in available heat 
appears. I have always felt that this was the unsatisfactory part of 
an otherwise perfect theory. It was therefore with much interest that 
I became acquainted a short time ago with a develo}»mentof the mole- 
cular theory of gases, which afforded precisely what seemed wanted to 
make every link in the chain of the great argument distinctly jiercepti- 
ble. I make no doubt that the notions which have occurred to me on 
this subject must have presented themselves to others also. I have 
however not read in print or heard in conversation any use made of the 
illustration that I am going to set forth. I feel therefore confident 
that even if it be known at all, it is certainly not generally known

araoDg the large aud ever-increasing circle of readers to whom the 
great questions of physics are of interest. 

The division of matter into the three forms of solids, liquids, and 
gases has acquired in these days a special signiticance now that the 
constitution of matter is becoming in some degree understood. First 
let it be noted that, though matter is capable of subdivision to a cer- 
tain extent, yet that there is a limit beyond which subdivision could 
not be carried. This statement touches uixin the ancient controversy 
as to the infinite divisibility of matter. Even still we can find the 
statement in some of our old text-books that there is no particle of mat- 
ter so small that it could not be again subdivided into half. No doubt 
(so far as most ordinary exi)enence goes) this statement may be unques- 
tionable. It is quite true that we do not often reduce matter to frag- 
ments so small tliat each of them shall be insusceptible of fui-ther con- 
ceivable division, But, to illustrate the natural piiiiciplc now under 
consideration, let us take tlie example of a body Avhich is itself com- 
posed of but a single element. Think for instance of a diamond, 
which is, as we all know, a jxtrtiou of crystallized caibou. It is true 
that tlie reduction of diamonds to powder is a laborious process. Still, 
diamond dust has to be produced in the finishing of the rough stone, 
and this element will serve the purpose of our present argument better 
than a substance of a composite nature. Each particle of the diamond 
duv^t is, of course, as nuich a particle of carbon as was the original 
crystal. We may however suppose that by a repetition of the process 
a reduction of the diamond dust to powder still finer is accoini^lished. 
The-grains thus obtained may have become so minute that they have 
ceased to be visible to the unaided eye, and require a microscope to 
render them i)erceptible ; but even after this comminution each of these 
particles is still a veritable diamond. It possesses the properties, 
optical, chemical, and mechanical, of the original gem, from which it 
difters merely in the attribute of size. Even when the disintegration 
lias been carried to such a point tliat each individual particle can be 
only Just perceived by the keenest power of the most i^owerful micro- 
scope, there is still no indication that the particles cease to possess 
.the characteristics of the original body. 

These facts being undoubted, it was perhaps not unnatural to suppose 
that the reduction could be carried on indefinitely, and that even if the 
smallest fragment of diamond which could be seen in a powerful micro- 
scope were reduced to a millionth i)art, and each of those to a million 
more, yet that the ultimate particles thus reached would be diamonds 
still. Now, however, we know that that is not the case. The smallest 
liarticle visible under a microsco])e might indeed be crushed into a thou- 
sand parts, and each one of those parts, though wholly inappreciable to 
our sense of touch or vision, would nevertheless be a genuine diamond. 
If however the subdivision be carried on until the particles produced 
are, roughly speaking, one-millionth part of the bulk of the smallest 



124 ATOMS AND SUNBEAMS. 

objects wliich could be seen in tlie microscope, we tlien approach tbe 
limits of i)artition of wliicli the diamonds wonld be snsceptible. We 
now know that there is an atom of diamond so small that it must refuse 
to undergo any further division. This ultimate atom, be it observed, 
is not an infinitely small quantity. It has definite dimensions; it pos- 
sesses a definite weight. All such diamond atoms are precisely alike 
in weight, and probably in other characteristics. It might be thought 
that if this atom has finite dimensions, it is, at all events, conceivable 
that it should admit of further subdivision. In a certain sense this is, 
no doubt, the case. The diamond atom is made up of parts and being 
so made it is of course conceivable that tliose parts could be separated. 
The important point to notice is, that no means known to us could pro- 
duce this separation, while it is perfectly certain that if the decompo- 
sition of the atom of diamond into distinct parts could l)e affected, those 
parts would not be diamonds at all, nor anything in the least resembling 
diamonds. 

What we have said as regards the element carbon may be extended 
to every other elementary substance. Sulphur is familiarly known in 
a form of extreme subdivision, and each little particle of suli^hur could 
be further comminuted to a certaiu point beyond which any further 
partition would be impossible. So too any composite body, such for 
example as a, lump of sugar, admits of being decomposed into mole- 
cules so small that any further separation would be impossible if the 
molecule were still to remain sugar. No doubt, a separation of the 
molecule of any composite body into constituent atoms of other elements 
is not alone possible but is incessantly taking place. 

The first step in our knowledge of the constitution of matter has been 
taken when we have come to re(;ognize that every body is composed of 
a multitude of extremely, but not infinitely, small molecules. The next 
l)oint relates to the condition in which these molecules are found. At 
first it might be thought that in a solid, at all events, the little particles 
must be clustered together in a compact mass. If we depended merely 
on sensible evidence it would seem that a lump of iron, if constituted 
from molecules at all, nuistbe simply a cohering massof particles, .just 
as a multitude of particles of sand unite to form a lump of sandstone. 
But the truth is far . more wonderful than such a belief would imply. 
Were the sensibility of our eyes so greatly increased as to make them 
a few million times more powerful than our present organs, then indeed 
the display of the texture of solid matter would be an astonishing rev- 
elation. It would be seen that the diamond atoms, which, when aggre- 
gated in sufficient myriads, form the i^erfect gem, were each in a condi- 
tion of rapid movement of the most complex description ; each molecule 
would be seen swinging to and fro with the utmost violence among the 
neighboring molecules. It would be seen quivering all over under the 
influence of the shocks which it would receive from the vehement en- 
counters with other molecules which occur millions of times in each 



ATOMS AND SUNBEAMS. 125 

second. Such would be the minute anatomy of the diamond. The well- 
known properties of such gems seem, at first sight, wholly at variance 
with the curious structure we have assigned to them. Surely, it may be 
said tbat the hardness and tlie impenetrability so characteristic of the 
diamond refute at once the supposition that it is no more than a cluster of 
rapidly moving particles. But the natural philosopher now knows that 
his explanation of the qualities of the diamond holds the field against 
all other explanations. The well-known impenetrability of the diamond 
seems to atinse from the fact that when you try to press a steel point 
into the stone you fail to do so because the rapidly moving molecules 
of the gem batter the end of the steel point with such extraordinary 
vehemence that they refuse to allow it to x)enetrateor even to mark the 
crystallized surface. When you cut glass with a diamond it is quite 
true that the edge, which seems so intensely hard, is really composed 
of rapidly moving atoms. But the glass which is submitted to the 
operation is also merely a mass of moving molecules, and what seems 
to happen is that, as the diamond is pressed forward, its several i^arti- 
cles, by their superior vigor, drive the little particles of glass out of the 
way. We do not see the actual details of the myriad encounters in 
which the diamond atoms are victorious over the glassy molecules; we 
only discern the broad result that the diamond has done its M^ork, and 
that the glass has been cut. 

It may well be asked how we know that matter is constituted of 
molecules in intensely rapid movement. The statement seems at the 
first glance to be so utterly at variance with our ordinary experience 
that we demand, and rightly demand, some convincing x^roof on the 
matter. There are many arguments by which the required demon- 
stration can be forthcoming. The one which I shall give is not i^erhaps 
the most conclusive, but it has the advantage of being one of the sim- 
plest and the most readily intelligible. 

Let us see if we can not prove at once that the molecules in, let us 
say, a piece of iron must be in movement. Suppose that the iron is 
warmed so that it radiates heat to a perceptible extent. We know 
that the heat which, in this case, affects our nerves has been trans- 
mitted from its origin by setherial undulations. Tliose undulations 
have undoubtedly been set in motion by the iron, and yet the parts 
of the metal seem quite motionless relatively to each other, notwith- 
standing that they possess the power of setting the aether into vibra- 
tion. It is impossible that such vibrations could be i^roduced were it 
not that there is in the iron a something which vibrates in such a 
manner as to communicate the necessary pulses to the lether. It 
therefore follows that in the texture of the solid iron there must be 
some molecular movement, timed in such a way as to impart to the 
ffither the actual vibrations which we find it to possess. The argument 
in this case may be illustrated by the analogous phenomena presented 
in the case of sound. As we listen to the notes of a violin^ what we 



126 ATOMS AND SUNBEAMS. 

actually perceive are vibrations comuiniiicatcd tlirouj;li the air to the 
auditory apparatus. We can trace these aerial vibrations back to their 
source, and we find they originate from the quivering of the violin 
under the influence of the bow of the performer. Were it not for these 
vibrations of the instrument the aerial vibrations would not be pro- 
duced, and the corresponding souiuls would not be heard. Far more 
delicate than the atmospheric; waves of sound are the .Ttherial waves 
corresponding to light or to heat, but none the less nmst these latter 
also originate from the imx)ulse of some vibrating mass» It is thus 
apparent that a hot piece of iron, however still it may seem, must be 
animated by an excessively rapid molecular movement. Xor is the 
validity of this conclusion impaired even if the iron be at ordinary 
temperature. We know that a body which is no hotter than the sur- 
rounding bodies is still incessantly radiating heat to them and receiving 
heat from tliem in return. Thus we are led to the conviction that a 
piece of iron, whatever be its temperature, must consist of atoms in a 
state of lively movement. The important conclusion thus drawn with 
regard to iron may be equally stated with resi)ect to every otlier solid, 
or, indeed, every other body, whether solid, liquid, or gaseous. All 
matter of every description is not only known to be composed of mole- 
cules, but it is also now certain that those molecules are incessantly 
j)erforming movements of a very complex type. 

A closer study of this subject will be necessary for our present pur- 
pose, and it will be convenient to examine matter in that state in which 
it IS exhibited in its very simplest type from the molecular point of 
view. This condition is not presented, as might at first be supposed, 
when the matter is solid, like a diamond, or like a piece of iron. Even 
in a liquid the complexity of molecular constitution, though somewhat 
less than in the case of a solid, is still notably greater than in matter 
which has the gaseous form. The air that we breathe is matter almost 
of the most simple kind, so far as molecular constitution is concerned. 
It should however be noted, that as air consists of a mixture, it would 
be better for our purpose to think of a gas isolated from any other ele- 
ment. Let us take the case of oxygen, the most important constituent 
of our atmosphere. 

Like every other element, oxygen is composed of molecules, and those 
molecules are in a state of rapid motion. It might be expected that 
the afitinity by which the different molecules were alli(Hl in the case of 
a gas should be of the simplest nature, and this is indeed found to be 
the case. Notwithstanding that oxygen is an invisil)le body, and m^t- 
withstanding that the molecules are so excessively minute as to be 
severally quite inappreciable to our senses, yet we have been able to 
learn a great deal with regard to the constitution of the molecules of 
this gas. The mental eye of the philosopher shows him that though 
the oxygen with which a jar is filled appears to be perfectly quiescent, 
yet that quiescence has there no real existence. He knows that oxygen 



ATOMS AND SUNBEAMS. 127 

consists of myriads of molecules identical in weight atid in other 
features, and darting about one among the other with velocities which 
vary perhaps between those of express trains and those of rifle bullets. 
He sees that each little molecule hurries along quite freely for a while 
until it happens to encounter some other molecule equally bent on its 
journey, and then a collision takes x>hice. Perhaps it would be more 
(;orrect to say that what usually happens is that tlie two impinging 
molecules make a very close approach ; then each of them so A-ehemently 
attracts the otiier as to make it swerve out of its course and start it off 
along a path, inclined, it may be, even at a right angle to that which 
it previously pursued. The molecules in a gas at ordinary pressures 
are so contiguous that these encounters take place incessantly; in fact, 
we are able to show that each individual molecule Mill i)robably expe- 
rience such adventures some millions of times in the course of each 
second. We are able to calculate the average velocity with which the 
several molecules move when the gas has a certain temperature. We 
know how to determine the average length of tlie free j^ath which each 
molecule traverses in the interval between two consecutive encounters. 
We are able to trace how all these circumstances would vary if, instead 
of oxygen gas, we took nitrogen, or hydrogen, or any other body in the 
same molecular state. It is in fact characteristic of every gas that 
each molecule wanders freely, subject only to those incessant encoun- 
ters with other similar wanderers by which its path is so frequently 
disturbed. If two gases be placed in the same vessel, one being laid 
over the other, it will presently be found that the two gases begin to 
blend; ere long one gas will have diffused uniformly through the other, 
so that the two will have become a perfect mixture just as the oxygen 
and nitrogen have done in our own atmosphere. The molecular theory 
of gases exi^lams at once the actual character of the operation by which 
diffusion is effected. Across the boundary which initially separates 
the two gases certain molecules are r)rojected from either side, and this 
process of interchange goes on until the molecules become nniibrmly 
distributed throughout. 

There is indeed nothing more remarkable than the fact that infor- 
mation so copious and so recondite can be obtained in a region which 
lies altogether beyond the direct testimony of the senses. Just as the 
astronomer staggers our powers of conception by the description of 
appalling distances and stupendous i^eriods of time, and relies with con- 
fidence on the evidence which convinces him of the reality of his state- 
ments, so the physicist avails himself of a likepotent method of research 
to study distances so minute and times so brief that the imagination 
utterly fails to realize them. 

In the case of a liquid, the freedom enjoj^ed by the molecules is con- 
siderably more restricted than in the case of a gas. It would seem that 
in the denser fluid there can be no intervals of undisturbed travel per- 
mitted to a molecule ; it is almost incessantly in a state of encounter 



128 ATOMS AND SUNBEAMS. 

with some other simihir object. When a molecule iu a liquid breaks 
away from its nssociatiou with one group, it is only because it has 
entered into alliance with another. As however two liquids will very 
frequently blend if so placed that diffusion be possible, we have a proof 
that, though the transference of a particular molecule through the 
liquid may be comparatively slow, yet it will gradually exchange asso- 
ciation with one group for association with another, and may in this 
way travel throughout any distance to which the liquid extends. 

In the case of a solid there is still further limitation imposed on the 
mobility of each separate molecule. It is now no longer permitted to 
make excursions throughout the entire volume of the body. Each 
molecule is in rapid motion, it is true, but those movements are confined 
to gyrations within miiuitely circumscribed limits. Two solids placed 
iu contact do not generally diffuse one into the other, the incapacity for 
diffiision being the direct (jonseqaence of the inferior degree of mobility 
possessed by the molecules in this condition of matter. 

It is known that the immediate effect of the application of heat is to 
increase the velocities with which the molecules move. Apply heat, 
for instance, to tlie water in a kettle; the moving molecules of water 
are tliereby stinuilated to even greater activity and it will occasionally 
happen that the velocity thus acquired by a molecule becomes so great 
that the little particle will swing clear away from the influence of the 
other molecules with which it had been associated. When this takes 
place in the case of a sufficient number of molecules, they dart freely 
from the surface of the liquid, thus producing the effect which in our 
ordinary language we describe as giving off steam. If therefore a 
volume of gas be heated, the velocities with which its molecules are 
animated will be in general increased. As the molecular velocities 
throughout the extent of the gas are on the whole augmented, it is 
quite ]»laiii tliat the intensities of the shocks experienced by the mole- 
cules in their several encounters will be also accentuated. The more 
rapidly moving particles will strike each against the other with increased 
violence, and the contemi)latioii of this single fact leads us close to one 
of nature's greatest secrets. 

Let us think of the abounding heat wliich is dispensed to us from 
the sun. That heat comes, as we know, in the form of undulations 
imparted to the ;ether by the heated matter in the sun, and transmit- 
ted thence across space for the benefit of the earth and its inhabitants. 
I have already explained that these vibrations in the a'ther must take 
their rise from molecular movements, and it is important to notice 
that the character of the vibrations in the a'ther enables us to learn to 
some extent the precise description of molecular movements which 
alone would be competent to produce the particular vibrations corre- 
sponding to radiant heat. At first it might be thought that it Avas the 
rapid movements of translation of the molecules themselves, as entire 
if extremely minute bodies, whicli caused the a^.therial vibration, but 



ATO]\rS AND SUNBEAMS. 129 

this is not so. We must carefully observe tbat there is another kind 
of molecular motion besides that which the molecule possesses as a 
whole. \\\' have hitherto been occupied only with the movements of 
each molecule as a little projectile pursuing' its zigzag course, each 
turn of the zigzag being the result of an encounter with some similar 
molecule belonging to the same medium. IJut we have now to observe 
that the molecule itself. is by no means to be regarded as a sim[)le 
rigid particle; indeed, if it were so it is certain that we should receive 
no heat at all from the sun. We have the best reasons for believing 
that the molecule of matter, so far from resembling a simple rigid ])ar- 
ticle, is an elal)orate structure, whose parts are in some degree capable 
of independent movement. It will not, indeed, be necessary for us to 
adopt the splendid hypothesis of Lord Kelvin, which supposes that 
molecules of matter are merely vortex rings in that perfect fluid, the 
;ether. It seems difdcult to doubt that this doctrine represents the 
facts, but if anyone should reject it, then I have only to say that its 
assumption is not lequiied for our present argument. All that is 
necessary for us is to regard each molecule as somewhat resembling an 
elastic structure made of parts which can (piiver like springs, and so 
arranged as to be susceptible of many different modes of vibration. 
We are to suppose that each molecule, in addition to the energy which 
it possesses in virtue of its movement of translation as a whole, has 
also a store of energy corresponding to the oscillations of its electric 
springs. We can, in fact, in some cases determine the ratio which 
exists between the amount of energy which is, on the average, pos- 
sessed by molecules in consequence of their velocities of translation, 
and the amount of energy whicli they possess in consequence of the 
vibrations by which their several parts are animated. It is these 
internal molecular vibrations which are of essential imi)ortance in our 
present inquiry. It is believed that the radiation of light or of heat 
generally takes rise in the impulses given to jcther by the internal 
molecular vibrations. Do we not know that the essential character- 
istic of those jetherial movements which correspond to radiant light 
and heat is that they have the nature of oscillations' Such could not 
be imparted by mere rectilinear movements of the molecules as a whole. 
They must be due to those internal oscillations by which the actual 
molecules are animated. 

No doubt it is difficult to realize that much can be learned with 
regard to the performances that actually go on in the internal parts of 
a molecule, especially when it is remembered that each molecule in its 
entirety is so extremely minute as to be entirely beyond the reach of 
our organs of sense. It is nevertheless impossible to doubt that the 
statements Just made correspond to the veritable facts of nature. It 
would be impracticable here to go into any complete detail with regard 
to the evidence on this subject; 1 can only sketch an outline of it. Let 
us take, perhaps as the simplest case, that presented by hydrogen. 
SM 93 9 



130 ATOMS AND SUNBEAMS. 

At tbe ordinary teiii])eratiire of the air, liydrojieii is of course iuvisi- 
ble; this iiieaus that the vibrations in the interior of the molecules are 
uot sufficiently vehement to im})art pulses to tliciether with the energy 
that would be required to produce visual effects. Now, let us su[)pose 
that the hydrogen is heated. The effect of heating is to imi^art addi- 
tional speed to the molecules of the gas, and consequently when the 
molecules happen to come together their encounter is more violent. 
The effect of such an occurrence on one of these little elastic bodies is 
to set it quivering with greater vehemence in those particular modes 
of vibration for which it is tuned. If the temperature of the gas has 
been raised sufficiently higli, as it can be by the aid of electricity, 
then the internal energy acquired by the molecules, in consequence of 
the increased vehemence of their collisions, has become so great that 
they are able to !mi)art pulses to the a'ther with sufficient intensity to 
affect our nerves of vision; thereui)on we declare that the hydrogen is 
now so hot as to ha v«' become luminous. Suppose we employ a spectro- 
scope for the i)urpose of studying the particular character of the light 
which the glowing hydrogen dispenses. It will appear that the spec- 
trum consists of a definite number of bright lines. We know that each 
one of these lines corresponds to a i>articulnr period of vibration of the 
tether, and hence we see that the light emitted by the hydrogen does 
not consist of vibrations of all periods indiscriminately, but onh' of cer- 
tain particular waves which are in unison with the oscillations to which 
the internal parts of the molecule of hydrogen are adopted. Had we 
examined the spectrum of some other gas in a state of iiu-andesceuce 
Ave should have found a wholly different system of hues from those per- 
taining to hydrogen. This demonstrates that the molecules of one gas 
differ essentially from those of another in respect to the character of 
the internal vibrations which they are adajited to perform. The extra- 
ordinary activity of the movements which take place within the mole- 
cules may be appreciated from the following facts. We know tliat the 
wave corresponding to one of the hydrogen lines has a length of about 
the forty-thousanth of an inch; we also know that in a single second of 
time light travels over a space of 186,000 iniles; a simple calculation 
will, therefore, assure us that certain vibrations in the molecules of 
hydrogen corresponding to this particular undulation must take place 
with such an extraordinary fiequency that about 4()0 millions of millions 
of them are performed in each second of time. 

Provided with these conceptions we shall now, I think, be able to 
see without difficulty how it is that the sun's heat is sustained. We 
may, for our present purpose, think of the great luminary as a mass 
of glowing gas. It is quite true that the physical condition of the 
matter in the interior of the tremendous globe can hardly be that 
which we ordinarily consider as gaseous. But this need not affect our 
argument. It is undoubtedly true that those portions of the solar 
atmosphere from which the light and heat are mainly dispensed are 



ATOMS AND SUNBEAMS. 131 

gaseous in tlieir character, or, at all events, come sufrtciently near to 
matter in tlie gaseous state to i)ermit the api)lication of tlie line of 
argument with which we have hitherto been engaged. In consequence 
of the vast mass of the sun the gravitation with which it draws all 
bodies towards it is very much greater than the gravitation on the 
surface of the earth. On our globe we know that the effetit of gravita- 
tion is to impart to any body near the surface velocity directed towards 
the earth's center at the rate of 32 feet per second. The sun is more 
than three hundred thousand times as massive as the earth; we can 
not however assert that the gravitation is increased in the same pro- 
portion, because, on account of the vast size of the sun, a particle at 
its surface is more than a hundred times farther away from tlie solar 
center than a body on the surface of the earth is from the terrestrial 
center. It can however be shown, that taking these various matters 
into account, the actual intensity of gravitation at the solar surface is 
sufficient to tend to impart to all objects an increase of velocity towards 
the sun's center at the rate of 457 feet per second. This would apply 
not only to a meteorite, or other considerable mass, which is falling 
into the sun; it would be equally true of an object as small as a mole- 
cule. Every one of the myriads of gaseous molecules in the outer 
regions of the solar atmosphere must be constantly acted upon by this 
attractive force, which tends in the course of each second to add to 
them a downward velocity at that rate per second which has already 
been stated. It is quite true that to a great extent the effect of this 
attraction is masked by counteracting tendencies. In particular we 
may mention that inasmuch as the density of the solar atmosphere 
increases as the sun's center is ajiproached, the Hying molecule gener- 
erally fiuds itself more obstructed by encounters with other molecules 
when it is descending than whenic is ascending. 

We may here contrast the condition of the atmosphere on the earth 
with the condition of the solar atmosphere. Each molecule in our air, 
being acted upon by terrestrial gravitation, has thereby a tendency to 
fall downward with a velocity continually increasing at the rate of 32 
feet per second. As however the terrestrial atmosphere has long since 
reached a stable condition, in which it undergoes no further contrac- 
tion, the effect of gravitation in adding velocity to the molecules is so 
completely masked by the counteracting tendencies, that on the whole, 
there is no continual increase of molecular velocities downward due to 
gravitation. Were such an increase at present going on, we should 
necessarily find that the terrestrial atmosphere was decreasing in vol- 
ume, and ever becoming more condensed in its lower strata. It is 
however well known that no such changes as are here implied are 
taking place. The essential difference between the earth and the sun, 
(so far as the matter now before us is concerned,) is to be found in the 
fact that as the sun has not yet passed into the form of a rigid body, 
it is still contracting at a rate very much gi eater than that at which a 



132 ATOMS AND SUNBEAMS. 

body grown so cold as the earth draws its particles closer together. 
The molecules in the solar i)liotosphere accordingly yield to a certain 
extent to the gravitation which constantly seeks to draw them down. 
The counteracting tendencies can not in the sun, as they do in the 
earth, mask the direct and obvious eft'ect of gravitation. The conse- 
quence is that the intense attraction which is capable of adding veloc- 
ity to the molecules at the phenomenal rate of 457 feet per second, is i)er- 
mitted to accom])lish something, and thus increase the average speeds 
with which the molecules hurry along. To express the matter a little 
more accurately, we should say that the downward velocity imparted 
by gravitation, being compounded with the velocities otherwise pos- 
sessed by the molecules, tends, on the whole, to increase the rate at 
which they move. 

We shall now be able to discern what actually takes place as the sun 
contracts by dis[)ersing heat, and in conse(pience of its decline in bulk 
finds a store of energy liberated which it is permitted to use for the 
pur])ose of sustaining its radiating capacity. Owing to the intense 
heat which prevails in the photosphere, the molecules must there be in 
very rapid movement; their nmtual encounters must be of the utmost 
vehemence, and their internal vibrations, which are the consequences 
of the shocks in the encounters, must be correspondingly energetic. It 
is, as we have seen, these iuternal molecular vibrations which set the 
ictlu'r in motion, and thus dispense solar heat ami light far and wide 
through the universe. But this the molecules can onlv do at the 
expense of the energy which they possess in virtue of their internal 
vibrations. Unless therefore the internal molecular energy were to 
be in some way recuperated from time to time, the radiating power 
must necessarily flag. It is now plain that the necessary recuperation 
takes places in the successive encounters. A molecule whose internal 
energy of vibration is becoming exhausted by the effort of setting the 
a*ther into vibration presently impinges against some other molecule, 
and in consequence of the blow is again set into active vibration which 
pernnts it to carry on the work of radiation anew, until its declining 
energies have again to be sustained by some similar addition arising 
from a fresh collision. Of course, we know that the internal molecular 
energy thus acquired can not be created out of nothing. If the mole- 
cule receives sucli accessions of internal energy, it must be at the 
expense of the energy which is elsewhere. Obviously the only possible 
source of such energy must be found in the movement of the molecule 
as a whole, that is to say, in the velocity of translation with which it 
rushes about among the other molecules. Thus we see that the imme- 
diate effect of expenditure of heat or light by radiation is to diminish 
the internal energies of the molecules. These energies are restored by 
the transference of energy obtained from the general velocities of the 
molecules regarded as moving projectiles. It follows that the velocities 
of the several particles must on the whole tend to decline; in other

words, that the temperature teuds to fall. AVhat we have to discover 
is the agent which at present prevents the solar temperature from 
falling. We waut therefore to ascertain the means by which the molec- 
ular velocities are preserved at the same average value, notwith- 
standing that there is a constant tendency for these velocities to abate 
in consequence of the losses of light and heat by radiation. We have 
already explained how the gravitation of the sun constantly tends to 
impart additional downward velocity to the molecules in its atmos- 
phere. This is precisely the action which we now require. The con- 
traction of the sun tends to an augmentation of the molecular velocities, 
and this augmentation just goes to sujiply the loss of velocities which 
is the conseipience of the radiation. A complete explanation of the 
maintenance of the sun's heat is thus afforded. Observation no doubt 
seems to show that the capacity for radiation is at present sensibly 
constant, and this being so, we see that the gain of molecular velocities 
from gravitation and their losses from radiation are at present just 
adapted to neutralize each other. Nothing however that has as yet 
been said demonstrates that the efticiency of the sun for radiating light 
and heat must always be preserved exactly at its present value. 

It is quite i)ossible that if we had the means of studying the sun 
heat for a hundred thousand years, we might find that the capacity 
for radiation was slightly decreasing, or it may be that it would be 
slightly increasing, for it is at least conceivable that the gain of 
molecular velocity due to gravitation may, on the whole, exceed the 
loss due to the dispersal of energy by radiation. On the other hand, 
it is of course possible that the acquisition of velocity by gravitation, 
though nearly sufficient to countervail the expenditure by radiation, 
may not be quite enough, in which case the sun's temperature would be 
slowly declining. 

It must not however be su])posed that the argument which we have 
been here following attributes eternal vigor to the great luminary. It 
will be noted that it is of the essence of the argument that the con- 
traction is still in progress. If the contraction Avere to cease, then the 
restitution of velocity by gravitation would cease also, and the s])eedy 
dispersal of the existing heat by radiation would ]>resently produce 
bankruptcy in the supply of sunbeams. Indeed, such bankruptcy 
nuist arrive in due time, when, after certain millions of years, the sun 
has so far contracted that it ceases to be a gaseous .mass. The vast 
accumulated store of energy which is now being drawn upon to supply 
the current radiation, will then yield such snjjplies no longer. Once 
this state has been reached, a few thousand years more must witness 
the extinction of the sun altogether as a source of light, and the great 
orb, at present our splendid luminary, will then pass over into the 
ranks of the innumerable Lost of bodies which were once suns, bnt are 
now suns no longer.

Engineering is the art of construction; but to limit it to this would 
be to restrict its meaning much within the range of the ordinary useot 
the word. In a broader sense, engineering includes all operations whose 
object is the utilization of the forces of nature in the interests of man. 
It is both an art and a science, and as a science it consists for the most 
X)art of mathematics applied to physics and mechanics. It is of neces- 
sity, therefore, a measuring science, and a congress of engineers ought, 
in the nature of things, to be interested in anything relating to progress 
in metrology. 

Fortunately the literature of this subject is neither scanty nor difili- 
cult of access. Much attention has been given to it in all parts of the 
world during the hwst half of this century, and in the United States 
especially numerous and valuable papers and reports upon the subject 
of weights and measures have apj^eared during this period. Indeed, it 
would be difficult, if not impossible, to contribute to either the historical 
or the controversial aspect of the (question anything new aiul of notalde 
value. 

In spite of an extensive and widely circulated literature, however, it 
is very distiiu-tly in evidence that the origin and genesis of the units 
of measure in customary use in the United States and among most Eng- 
lish-speaking jjeople, and their relation or want of relation to each other, 
are matters concerning which many engineers are not well informed. 

Perhaps not a large majority of members of the profession in good 
standing would be able to answer accurately the question. What is a 
yard? or What is a pound? In view of this fact no excuse need be 
offered for presenting a statement of facts relating to fundamental 
standards in this country at the j) resent time, and for the sake of clear- 
ness this statement will be prefaced by a brief consideration of the 
principles involved in the evolution and selection of standards, together 
with a resume of genealogical history, showing their origin and ances-

try. Of the latter little detail will l)e given, as the extensive and easily 
accessible literatnre upon the subject renders it unnecessary. 

The measure of a magnitude is its numerical evaluation. In a direct 
way this is accompli sIkhI by ascertaining how many times it contains 
another magnitude of the same kind or nature which is adopted as a 
unit. Thus a length is selected as a unit for the measurement of length, 
a volume for the meaiuirement of volume, a time for time measurement, 
and so on. At first it seems that this condition of sameness of the unit 
and the thing measured is a necessity. A little reflection will show, 
however, that it is oi)en to the objection that it naturally, although 
perhaps not necessarily, leads to an almost indetinite multii)licatiou of 
independent units. The discovery and development of inter-relations 
among measurable magnitudes, which has gone on from the earliest 
times, has tended towards a reduction in the number of units and, cou- 
secpiently, to a great simplification of the whole subject of metrology. 
So simple and evident a device as relating the unit of volume to the 
unit of length has only been satisfactorily realized in comparatively 
modern times; and, with a single exception, it maybe affirmed that 
units of volume uow in use were originally in no way related to units 
of length, most of them being of accidental and now unknown origin. 

That a legal bushel in the United States must contain 2150-42 cubic 
inches is convincing evidence that the foot or the yard has no place iu 
its ancestry, and although there is a plausible explanation of the fact 
that a gallon contains 2;)1 cubic inches, it points only to a modified 
volume and not a selected one. 

Many interesting illnstrations of the great advantage gained by 
neglecting the princii»le that " like measures like" might be given, and 
one or two will, perhaps, be found instructive. In observing that prop- 
erty of matter known as "conductivity," either as to heat or electricity, 
qualitative or relative conclusions were for a long time all that was 
re(|uired. It was at first sufficient to say and to know that one sub- 
stance conducted heat or electricity better or worse than another, but 
with the advance of knowledge of physics it became desirable, and 
often necessary, to give numerical expression to these relations. In 
such cases as this the practice has usually been to select some partic- 
ular substance which possesses the property in question iu a higher or 
in a lower degree than any other and adopt it as a standai'd. Thus 
barely a (juarter of a century ago conductivities of difl'erent bodies for 
heat or electricity were expressed in terms of cop])eror silver; a lamp- 
black surface was the stancbird for radiation or absorption, and in most 
instances the standard was arbitrarily rated at 100. The literature of 
science contains many examples of elaborate and otherwise valuable 
investigations which are rendered quite worthless by the uncertain and 
unscientific units of measure employed. An example of the persistent 
use of this piinciple is to be found in the still common mode of express- 
ing the density of matter by referring it to the density of a certain 



FUNDAMENTAL UNITS OF MEASURE. 137 

kind of miitter, namely, water, the numerical re[)r('sentation of the ratio 
being known as " specific gravity." It has taken some years for even 
scientific men to fully appreciate the objectionable features of this sort 
of metrology, because it has required soine time to prove beyond doubt 
that all kinds of copper or silver do not conducli alike, nor do all sam- 
ples of lampblack radiate alike; and also that the coiulitions nnder 
which the density of water is constant are difficult of realization. 

Another factor which has been, np to a very recent time, of first 
importance in the selection of standards is the tendency to seek in 
nature something of constant dimensions or invariable mass which 
possesses that general availability essential to adoption as standard. 
The nomenclature of metrology bears testimony to this. In our own 
customary system of weights and measures the occurrence of such 
units as the foot, hand, grain, ell, etc., tells of the frequent recourse to 
natural units. This is not alone characteristic of earlier and ruder 
systems, but in modern metrology we have recorded the efforts of sci- 
entific men to realize this theoretically desirable condition in the selec- 
tion of the quadrant of the earth, the length of a seconds pendulum, 
and the wave length of a particular kind of light for linear standards. 
The oidy natural standard which u}) to this time can be said to have 
satisfied the requirements is the unit of time, which is the sidereal day. 
This might itself be considered a derived rather than a fundamental 
unit, and, indeed, it is difficult to conceive of any time unit other than 
one based on motion. The motion of the earth is assumed to be a uni- 
form rotatory motion, and the unit is the duration of a single revolu- 
tion. Vibratory or periodic motion seems to otter many advantages as 
a time standard, and various forms have been suggested from time to 
time. It has been shown that the period of a freely suspended inva- 
riable pendulum furnishes in practice a more uniform and constant 
time unit than the best clocks or chronometers. All standards of this 
type depend on the persistence of gravity, however, and of this we can 
not be assured. The prime requisites of a standard are constancy and 
universal availability, and as the present time unit, the sidereal day, 
possesses these in a high degree it is not likely that it will soon be 
supplanted. It would be extremely desirable, however, if a unit of 
time could be devised which would survive such terrestrial or celestial 
disturbances as would materially alter the revolution of the earth upon 
its axis. Something of tliis kind is necessary if time observations made 
during the present cycle are to be available in future ages, and it is 
]>ossible that the determination of the relation of the wave length of 
light to the generally accepted unit of length nniy indirectly furnish a 
time unit possessing this characteristic in a high degree. 

The greatest advance in the science of metrology in modern times is 
essentially due to Gauss, and it consists of the so-called "absolute" 
system of measurement. Quite as much as to the author of this ingen- 
ious system metrologists are indebted to the celebrated British Asso- 



138 FUNDAMENTAL UNITS OP MEASURE. 

elation Committee ou Units, led by Lord Kelvin, and includiug such 
men as Clerk Maxwell, Foster, Stoney, Fleeming Jeukiu, Siemens, 
Bramwell, Adams, Balfour Stewart, and Everett. Evincing a freedom 
from national prejudices worthy of the distinguished body which they 
represented, this committee placed the system of Gauss upon a firm 
and enduring basis by deriving its fundamental units from the only 
system of weights and measures which, starting from a scientific basis 
and constructed upon scientific princiides, has ever found favor among 
a considerable number of people, and which has now become well-nigh 
universal. 

The tendency of tlie absolute system is towards simplicity through 
a reduction of the number of fundamental units to a minimum, while 
at the same time it aftbrds every facility for the multiplication of 
derived units to meet the demands of convenience in practice. But 
however complex and luimerous these derived units may be, they all 
grow out of the same elements, and are therefore easy of comparison 
and intei'change. 

It is not too much to say, and it is important that it should be said, 
that the beauty, simplicity, and convenience of this system are not yet 
fully understood and appreciated by nmny engineers who might be 
greatly benefited by its use. As a single illustration, reference may be 
made to the still very general use of the foot-pound as a unit of work 
and energy. Let no one imagine that the objection to this unit lies in 
the fact that units of the metric system are not used, for kilogram- 
meter, which is also very common, is eijually objectionable. The difli- 
culty rests in the introduction of a variable, and in this instance unnec- 
essary magnitude, namely, the force of gravitation. If the funda- 
mental units, foot, pound, and second, be used, we have a unit of work 
sometnnes called the "foot-poundal," and if the centimeter, gram, sec- 
ond system be used, we have the well-known " erg." These units are 
vastly more convenient in practical use than their gravitation relatives, 
besides being invariable, whenever and wherever the units of length, 
mass, and time are invariable. 

Modern scientific metrology may be said to rest upon a few simple 
principles which may be summarized as follows: 

The number of independent fundamental units sliould be minimnm. 
In general not more than three are required. 

They should be such as admit of a ready and accurate comparison 
Avith other magnitudes of the same kind. Units of length, mass, and 
time satisfy this requirement better than any other that can be selected. 

They should be capable of use for such comparisons at places and 
times widely separated ; hence they ought to be comparatively easy of 
re-production and transportation and, as far as human ingenuity can 
secure, invariable in their magnitude. Units of length, mass, and lime 
satisfy these conditions better than any other. 

They should also be so related to each other, as far as such relation 



FUNDAMENTAL UNITS OF MEASURE. 139 

is possible, and the multii^les aud sub-multiples should be so related to 
them that units of every possible dimension and character for conven- 
ience in the measurement of all measureable things may be derived 
from them in the simplest manner, and thus be capable of the easiest 
reduction and interchange. The units of length, mass, and time, as 
represented by the centimeter, the gram and the second, fulfill these 
requirements almost as perfectly as possible. The second falls short 
of the others because its multiples are not decimally derived, but its 
use is and has long been so nearly universal that it is not likely to be 
modified in that respect in the near future. Indeed, a decimal system 
as applied to time is much less important than when considered in rela- 
tion to length and mass. 

As to the constancy of these units, an arbitrary length and an arbi- 
trary mass are much more capable of accurate reproduction than any 
natural units of which we now know. When reproduced in considera- 
ble numbers and of the best known material, aud when widely dis- 
tributed throughout the civilized world as they now are, under the direc- 
tion of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, anything- 
like destruction or loss of the standards must be regarded as well-nigh 
impossible. Copied in materials of various kinds and preserved under 
conditions widely varying, it is hardly likely that any secular change 
in the standards can escape detection, and the accurate determination 
of the meter in light waves now in i^rogress will aflbrd a valuable check 
on the constancy of the standard of length. 

It thus appears that the metric system with its derived units is to day 
by far the most perfect system of metrology ever used by man, and 
that it lacks little of theoretical perfection. It can hardly be denied 
that in one or two matters of minor importance it is susceptible of 
improvement, but it possesses the inestimable and unapproachable 
advantage of being actually in use by the great majority of civilized 
nations. Among the innumerable metrological schemes which have 
made their appearance within the past one hundred years, it is quite 
jiossible that some one of them possesses advantages over that based on 
the meter and the kilogram, and that it would be preferred if we were 
starting afresh with the whole question. But we are not starting- 
afresh, and it is certainly a cause for sincere and earnest congratula- 
tion that a system which is so rapidly advancing in public favor is as 
nearly absolutely perfect as is this. 

Let us turn now to a brief consideration of the origin and i)resent 
condition of what Lord Kelvin has justly characterized as the brain- 
wearying, intellect-destroying- system of weights and measures in use 
among English-speaking people. 

The fundamental unit of length is the yard, and the unit of mass is 
the pound. In the time of Edward II it was enacted (A. d. 1324) that 
3 barleycorns, round and dry, should make 1 inch and 12 inches make 
1 foot. The earliest actual material standard yard of which there is 



140 FUNDAMENTAL UNITS OF MEASURE. 

reliable account dates back to tlie time of Henry VII (about A. d. 1400). 
In tbe Transactions of tlie Royal Society it is recorded that in 1742 
"some curious gentlemen, botb of tbe Royal Society of London and of 
tbe Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, tbinking it migbt be of good 
use for tbe better comparing togetber tbe success of experiments made 
in England and in France, projjosed some time since tbat accurate 
standards of tbe measures and weigbts of botb nations, carefully exam- 
ined and made to agree witb eacbotber, migbt be laid up and preserved 
in tbe arcbivesbotb of tbe Royal Society bere and of tbe Royal Academy 
of Sciences at Paris," and determined to bring about an excbange of 
copies of tbe standards of weigbt and mass of tbe respective countries. 
Tbis led to an examination of tbe original standards of tbe excbequer 
and tbeir copies. It was found tbat tbe standard yard tben in use was 
a square rod of brass, of breadtb and tbickness of about half an incb. 
Tbe ends were neitber exactly flat nor parallel. Tbe standard was an 
end measure and a matrix was provided for it. Near eacb end of tbe 
yard was stamped a crowned E and it dated from about 15SS. Con- 
sidered as a standard, its cbaracter was very inferior, but less so tban 
tbe old standard of King Henry VII, wbicb was examined at tbe same 
time. This is described as an '' old eigbt-sided rod of brass, of tbe tbick- 
ness of about balf an incb, very coarsely made, and as rudely divided 
into 3 feet, and one of tbese feet into incbes." Tbis is tbe standard 
wbicb dates from A. D. 141)0, and is tbe earliest known material yard. 

In 1758, under instruction from a committee appointed by Parliament, 
Jobn Bird constructed copies of tbe tben existing standanls (Eliza- 
betban), one of wbicb, a line measure, was recommended for adoption 
as tbe legal standard of lengtb. A copy of tbis was made by tbe same 
artist in 1700, and is known as Bird's standanl of 17G0, to distiiiguisb 
it from bis tlrst copies made in 1758. Altbougb tbe subject received 
much consideration during tbe next balf century, it was not until 1824 
tbat any actifm was actually taken by Parliament. It follows tbat up 
to tbis date tbe legal standard of lengtb in(Jreat Britain and ber colo- 
nies continued to be tlie very imperfect standard of Elizabetb referred 
to above. In 1824, bowever, it was finally enacted tbat Bird's standard 
of 17(jO sbould be tbe fundamental unit of lengtb, and in tbe same act 
it was provided tbat in case of loss it sbould be reproduced by means 
of its suj^posed known ratio to tbe lengtb of a seconds pendulum at 
London. In 1834, tbe Parliament bouses, in (me of wbicb tbis standard 
bad been pi;(^served, were destroyed by fire. It is interesting to note 
tbat tbe conflagration was due to tbe burning of the " tallies" or sticks 
on wbicb accounts bad been kept by means of notcbes, and in the use 
of wbicb the Government officials bad persisted for many years after it 
bad almost become a lost art elsewhere, thus exhibiting a conservatism 
characteristic of tbe whole course of tbe English (lovernment in refer- 
ence to metrology and allied sciences. 

Tbe legal standard having been destroyed in this manner, it was 



FUNDAMKNTAL UNITS OF MEASURE. 141 

found impracticable to reproduce it, as had been intended, by the use 
of a penduhiiii, and accordingly a new standard was prepared under 
the direction of Mr. Shcepslumks from a half dozen excellent copies of 
the destroyed standard which were available. This Avas legalized by 
an act of Parliament in IS,"*, and is the imperial standard yard of Great 
Britain to-day. It is a line measure, made of bronze, the total length 
being 38 inches and the cross section 1 inch scpiare. At the time it was 
prepared several copies were produced, one of which, known as Bronze 
No. 11, is in the U. S. ofliceof weights and measures at NN'ashington. 

To recur now to standards of length in the United States, it is 
necessary to repeat the often-published statement that although the 
Constitution authorizes Congress to establish a systein of weights and 
measures, it has never exercised this authority except in the matter of 
legalizing the metric system in 1800. The weights and measures in use 
in the colonies before the Revolution were almost entirely those of 
Great Britain, and they continued in use without special legalization 
for a long time after independence was declared. The first Superin- 
tendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, Mr. Hassler, requiring an 
accurate standard of length in the operations of that liurcau, obtained 
from Troughton, of London, in 1814, a brass bar about 82 inches long, 
2-5 inches wide, and one half inch thick. Thisbar was a direct descend- 
ant of the Bird standard of 1700, a number of copies of which had 
been made by Troughton. 

ll being necessary for the Executive Departments of the Government 
to have some standards of weiglit and measure properly authenticated, 
for the jHirpose of levying taxes, duties, etc., this bar, or rather one 
particular yard of it, from the twenty- seventh to the sixty-third inch, 
was adopted as the standard of length. It was supposed to be precisely 
equal to the British standard at a temperature of 02° p. A direct 
comparison with the copies of the new imperial yard of 1855, however, 
showed that it was too long at that temperature, and this fact gave 
rise to the idea which found its way into scientific literature that the 
English and American yards were different, the latter being the longer. 
The action taken in the oftice of weights and measures was simply to 
change the temperature at which it was a standard, so as to bring it 
into {igreement with the English yard. As a matter of fact its use as a 
standard was practically discontinued, and the bronze copy of the 
imperial yard was accepted in its ])lace, together with another copy of 
this yard made of Low Moor iron and so designated. 

It will thus be seen that, as far as the Government is concerned, we 
have followed the English in the matter of standards of length, and 
their yard and ours have always been as nearly as practicable iden- 
tical. 

The same is essentially true in regard to the standard of mass. 
There is an important difference, however, in that Congress did, in 
1828, legalize a standard Troy pound for purposes of coinage. This 



142 FUNDAMENTAL UNITS OF MEASURE. 

was i\ copy of the British Troy i^oiiiid of 1758, which in 1825 became 
the imperial standard. It if-, preserved in the mint at Phihidelphia, 
and is known as the mint pound. The standard avoirdupois ponnd of 
the Treasnry Department was derived from tliis Troy ponnd. Both are 
very inferior in construction and nnsnitable for standards. The pres- 
ent imperial standard of mass of Great Britain is a platinum avoirdu- 
pois ponnd. It was derived from a copy of the standard referred to 
above, which was lost in the bnrninft' of the Parliament houses'. AvS 
the imperial standard and our own have thus a common ancestor, it is 
assumed that they are the same. 

Besides these units of length and mass the executive ofticers of the 
Government adopted two units of volume, the gallon which contains 
231 cubic Incbes and the bushel of 2150-42 cubic. inches. They are old 
English measures and differ very iiuitefially from the imperial gallon 
and bushel now in use in Great Britain. 

The above statements apply to what may ])e known as national or 
United States standards only in the limited sense that they are the 
standards of the executive branch of the Government. The whole 
subject of standards, with the exception as to the metric system already 
noted was, in the absence of definite action by Congress, left to the law- 
making authorities of the several States. In view of the great and 
intelligent interests in this subject exhibited by Washington, Jeffer- ' 
sou, Adams, Gallatin, and others of the early statesmen, the omission 
to legislate in Congress must be attributed largely to the fact of great 
dissatisfaction with the present system and a hesitancy to recommend 
any other, however perfect it might seem to be, until it had received 
the test of actual trial. Eealiziug the danger which was impending of 
inharmonious and unscientific legislation by the several States, Con- 
gress decided in 1836 to encourage uniformity throughout the country 
by the distribution among the various State governments of complete 
sets of weights and measures copied from the standards adopted in the 
United States office of weights and measures. Some States had already 
legalized standards dittering somewhat from these, but they were soon 
accepted by all, thus establishing a practically unifi)rm system through- 
out the country and one in agreement with that adopted by the Ciov- 
erument. Strictly speaking, however, each State has its own stand- 
ards, and they are entirely independent of, although copied from, those 
in use at Washington. But, as has already been explained, the latter 
have not themselves been regarded as fundamental standards, being 
only copies of the imperial standards of Great Britain, in the case of 
the yard, or descended from the same ancestry, as in the case of the 
pound, and assumed to be the same. It thus appears that practically, 
and until a very recent period, our whole system of length and mass 
measurement was made to depend upon the imperial yard and pound 
of Great Britain. 

The most important legislation upon this subject from the founding 



FUNDAMENTAL UNITS OF MEASURE. 143 

of tlie Government to the present time is the act of Congress of July 
28, 18G0, legalizing the metric system of weights and measnres throngh- 
out the United States. It has not been generally recognized that this 
system is and has been fcir more than a quarter of a century the only 
system whose use is made legal throughout the whole country by act 
of Congress, Since the passage of this act there has been a decided 
advance in the use of this system among all civilized nations. This 
remarkable movement, in which the United States Government, through 
annual contributions of money and diplomatic negotiations, has had a 
large i^art, leaves no room for doubt that in the comparatively near 
future all mankind will be in tlie fullest enjoyment of the great boon of 
a single, universal system of weights and measures, and one as nearly 
perfect in form and design as could well be expected. 

The recognition of this fact has led to recent action on the jiart of the 
office of weights and measures at Washington, which is of such impor- 
tance as to justify the repetition here of the words of Bulletin No. 2(>, 
U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, A^^ril 5, 1893, in which it was first 
announced. 

Fundamental Standauus of Length and Mass. 

"While the Constitution of the United States authorizes Congress 
to 'fix the standard of weights and measures,' this power has never 
been definitely exercised, and but little legislation luis been enacted 
upon the subject. Washington regarded the matter of sufticient impor- 
tance to justify a sj)ecial reference to it in his first annual message to 
Congress (January, 1790), and Jefi'erson, while Secretary of State, pre- 
pared a report at the request of the House of Eepresentatives, in which 
he proposed (July, 1790) 'to reduce every branch to the decimal ratio 
already established for coins, and thus bring the calculation of the prin- 
cii)al affairs of life within the arithmetic of every man who can nndtiply 
and divide.' The consideration of the subject being again urged by 
Washington, a committee of Congress reported in favor of Jefferson's 
plan, but no legislation lollowed. In the meantime the executive branch 
of the Government found it necessary to procure standards for use in 
the collection of revenue and other operations in which weights and 
measures were required, and the Troughton 82-inch brass scale was 
obtained for the Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1814; a platinum kilo- 
gram and meter, by Gallatin, in 1821; and a Troy pound from London 
in 1827, also by Gallatin. In 1828 the latter was, by act of Congress, 
made the standard of mass for the mint of the United States, and, 
although totally unfit for such purpose, it has since remained the stand- 
ard for coinage xmrjwses. 

"In 1830 the Secretary of the Treasury was directed tocauseacom- 
l)arison to be made of the standards of weight and measure used at 
the principal custom-houses, as a result of which large discrepancies 
were disclosed in the weights and measures in use. The Treasury 
DepaTtment being obliged to execute the constitutional provision that 
all duties, imposts, and excises shall be uniform throughout the United 
States, adopted the Troughton scale as the standard of length; the 
avoirdupois pound to be derived from the Troy pound of the mint, as 
the unit of mass. At the same time the Department adoi)ted the wine 
gallon of 231 cubic inches for liquid measure and the Winchester bushel 



144 FUNDAMENTAL UNITS OF MEASURE. 

of 2150-42 cubic inches for dry measure. In 1836, the Secretary of the 
Treasury was authorized to cause a complete set of all wei^lits aud 
measures, adoi)ted as standards by tlie Department for the use of cus- 
tom-liouses and for other purposes, to be delivered to the governor of 
each State in the Union for the use of the States, respectively, the 
object being to encourage uniformity of weights and measures through- 
out the Union. At this time several States had adopted standards 
differing from those used in the Treasury Department, but alter a time 
these were rejected, and, finally, nearly all the States formally adopted 
by act of legislature the standards which had been put in their hands 
by the National Government. Thus a good degree of uniformity was 
secured, although Congress had not adopted a standard of mass or of 
length other than for coinage pur})0ses as already described. 

"The uext, and in many respects the most important, legislation 
upon the subject was the act of July 28, 18()G, making the use of the 
metric system lawful thronghout the United States, and defining the 
weights and measures in common use in terms of the units of this sys- 
ten). This was the first general legislation upon the subject, and the 
metric system Avas thus the first and, thus far, the only system made 
generally legal throughout the country. 

"In 1875, an international metric convention was agreed ui)on by 
seventeen go\ernments, including the United States, at which it was 
undertaken to establish and maintain at connnon expense a perma- 
nent international bureau of weights and measures, the first object 
of which should be the preparation of a new international standard 
meter and a new international standard kilogram, co}>ies of which 
should be made for distribution among the contributing governments. 
Since the organization of the bureau, the United States has regularly 
contributed to its sujtport, and in 1881) the copies of the new interna- 
tional prototypes were ready for distribution. This was etfected by 
lot, and the United States received meters Nos. 2L and 27, and kilo- 
grams Nos. 4 and 20. The meters and kilograms are made from the 
same material, which is an alloy of platinum with 10 per cent of irid- 
ium. 

" On January 2, 1800, the seals which had been placed on meter No. 
27 and kilogram No. 20, at the International Bureau of Weights and 
Measures, near Paris, were broken in the Cabinet room of the Execu- 
tive Mansion by the President of the United States, in the presence of 
the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury, together with 
a number of invited guests. They were thus adopted as the national 
prototype meter and kilogram. 

" The Trough ton scale, which in the early part of the century had 
been tentatively ado])ted as a standard of length, has long been recog- 
nized as quite unsuitable for siu'h use, owing to its faulty construction 
and the inferiority of its graduation. For many years, in standardizing 
length measures, recourse to copies of the imperial yard of Great Brit- 
ain had been necessary, and to the copies of the meter of the archives 
in the ofiice of weights and measures. The standard of mass orig- 
inally selected was likewise unfit for use for similar reasons, and had 
been practically ignored. 

"The recent receipt of the very accurate copies of the international 
metric standards, which are constructed in accord Avith the most 
advanced conception of modern metrology, enables comparisons to be 
made directly with those standards, as the equations ol the national 
prototy])es are accurately known. It has seemed, therefore, that greater 
stability in weights and measures, as well as nuich higher accuracy in 



FUNDAMENTAL UN1T« OF MEASURE. 145 

their conipaTison, can be secured by iiecepting" the iuteruatioiial proto- 
types as the fuiidaniental standards of k^iigtli and mass. It was doubt- 
less the intention of Congress tliat this slionhl be done when the inter- 
national metric convention was entered into in 1875; otherwise there 
would be nothing gained from the annual contributions to its support 
wliich the Government has constantly made. Such action will also 
have the great advantage of putting us in direct relation in our weights 
and measures with all civilized nations, most of whi<!h have adopted 
the metric system for exclusive use. The practical effect upon our cus- 
tomary weights and measures is, of course, nothing. The most care- 
ful study of the relation of the yard and tlie meter has failed, thus far, 
to show that tlie relation as defined by Congress in the act of 186(5 is in 
error. The pound as there dehned, in its relation to the kilogram, dif- 
fers from the imperial pound of Great JJritaiu by not jnore than 1 part 
in 1()(>,0(H), an error, if it be so called, which utterly vanishes in com- 
parison with the allowances in all ordinary transactions. Only the 
most refined scientific research will demand acloser api)roximation, and 
in scientific work the kilogram itself is now universally used, both in 
this country and in England.* 

"In view of these facts, and the absence of any material normal 
standards of customary Aveights and measures, the ottice of weights 
and measures, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, will 
in the future regard the international prototype meter and kilog:ram 
as fundamental standards, and the customary units, the yard and the 
pound, wall be derived therefrom in accordance with the act of July 28, 
18G0. Indeed, this course has been practically forced upon this office 
for several years, but it is considered desirable to make this formal 
announcement for the information of all interested in the science of 
metrology or in measurements of precision.

As a result of this action, our fundameutal units of length and mass

by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, near Paris, and 
our metrology is in touch with that of the civilized world. This is the 
second great step toward complete emancii)ation from the "brain- 
wearying, intellect-destroying" system Avith which we have so longbeeu

None will be more benefited personally by this action, and none can 
aid more effectually to hasten it, than the distinguished body to which 
this paper is respectfully submitted. If any argument in its favor were 
needed, it \vould be suflftcient to cite the example of one department of 
the great subject of engineering, namely, electrical engineering, which 
is doubtless represented in some degree in this Congress. But, yester- 
day a thing unknown, its beautifully simple units of measure and their 
interrelations are as wings which have enabled it to outstrip those 
that persist in carrying the dead weight of an unscientific and hope- 
lessly bad system of metrology. 

UNITS OF ELECTRICAL MEASURE.* 

Within but little more than a decade practical applications of elec- 
tricity have developed with a rajjidity unparallelled in the history of 
modern industries. Many millions of dollars of capital are now in- 
vested in the manufacture of machinery and various devices for the 
prodnction and consumption of electricity. As it has now become 
a commodity of trade, its nieasurement is a (juestion of the highest 
importance, both to the jiroducer and consumer. Both the nomencla- 
ture of electro-technics and the methods and instruments of measure 
are excej^tionally precise and satisfactory, bnt there has been lacking, 
up to the present time, the veiy important and essential element of 
fixed and invariable units of measnre authoritatively adopted. Such 
units have long been in use among scientific men, but the necessity for 
the establishment and legalization of practical units for commercial 
purposes became evident in the beginning of the recent enormous 
development of the applications of electricity. 

To meet this universally recognized want, conferences and congresses 
of the leading electricians of the world have been held at occasional 
intervals, the first being the Paris Congress of 18S1. These assem- 
blages have been international in their character, for it was wisely 
determined in tlie beginning that the new units of measure should be 
international and, indeed, universal in their api)lication. It was con- 
venient to make them so, and it was important to thns facilitate in- 
ternational interchange of machinery, instruments, etc. The United 
States was represented by official delegates in the Congress of 1881, 
and also in snbse<juent Congresses in 1881. 

The difficulty of the material representation of some of the units 
of measure was so great at the time of holding these Congresses that 
no satisfactory agreement as to all of them could be arrived at. Some 
recommendations were made, but they at no time received the unani- 
mous support of thoseinterested and were admitted by all to be tentative 
in their character. During the past few years the advance of knowl-

edge and experience among electricians was suck as to indicate that 
the time was ripe for the general adoption of the principal nnits of 
electrical measnre. An International Congress of Electricians was 
arranged for, to meet in Chicago, during the World's Columbian Ex- 
position of 1<S93. In this Congress the business of dettuiug and naming 
units of measure was left to what was known as the " Chamber of 
Delegates," a body composed of those only who had been officially 
commissioned by their respective governments to act as members of 
said Chamber. The United States, Great Britain, Germany, and 
France were eachallowed five delegates in the Chamber. Other nations 
were represented by three, two, and in some cases one. The princi- 
pal nations of the world were represented by their leading electricians, 
and the Chamber embraced many of the most distinguished living 
representatives of physical science. 

The delegates representing the United States have reported to the 
honorable the Secretary of State, under date of November 6, .1893, 
giving the names and definitions of the units of electrical measure as 
unanimously recommended by the (Uiamber in a resolution as follows: 

^^ Resolved, That the several governments rei)resented by the dele- 
gates of this International Congress of Electricians be, and they are 
hereby, recommended to formally adopt as legal units of electrical 
measure the following: As a unit of resistance, the internatiomtl ohm^ 
which is based upon the olim equal to 10^ units of resistance of the 
Centimeter-Gramme-Second system of electro-magnetic nnits, and is 
represented by the resistance offered to an unvarying electric current 
by a column of mercury at the temperature of melting ice li-J:.")!}! 
grammes in mass, of a constant cross-sectional area and of the length 
of 10(5.3 centimeters. 

"As a unit of current, the International ampere, which is one-tenth of 
the unit of current of the c. G. s. system of electro-magnetic units, and 
which is represented sufficiently well for practical use by the unvarying 
current which, when ])assed through a solution of nitrate of silver in 
water, and in accodrance with accompanying specifications,* deposits 
silver at the rate of 0-001118 of a gramme per second. 

* In the following specification tlie term silver voltameter means the arrangement 
of apparatus by means of wliicli an electric current is passed tlirougli a solution of 
nitrate of silver in Avater. The silver voltameter measures the total electrical quan- 
tity which has passed during the time of the experiment, and by noting this time, 
the time average of the current, or if the current has been kept constant, the cur- 
rent itself can be deduced. 

In employing the silver voltameter to measure currents of about 1 ampere, the 
following arrangemc^nt^ should be adopted : 

The kathode on which the silver is to be dejjosited should take the form of a plat- 
inum bowl, not less than 10 centimeters in diameter and from 4 to 5 centimeters in 
depth. 

The anode should be a jdate of \n\vv silver some 30 s<iuaro centiiueters in area and 
2 or 3 millimeters in thickness. 

This is supported horizontally in the li(|uid near the top of the solution by a, plat- 
inum wire passed through holes in the plate at opposite corners. To prevent the 
disintegrated silver which is formed on the anode from falling on to the kathode. 



148 FUNDAMENTAL UNITS OF MEASURE. 

"As ;i unit of electio-motive {orce, t\ni intern<(tio7ial volf, which is the 
electro-iiiotivc force that, steadily ap])lied to a conductor whose 
resistance is one international ohm, will [troduce a current of one 
international ampere, and which is represented sufficiently well for 
practical use by ttM o* t'le electro-motive force between the poles or 
electrodes of the voltaic cell known as Clark's cell, at a temperature of 
15° ('., and prepared in the manner described iu the accompauyinj^ 
specification.* 

"As a unit of quantity, the international coulomb, which is the quau- 
tity of electricity transferred by a current of one international ampere 
in one second. 

"As a unit of capacity, the international farad, which is the cajtacity 
of a condenser charged to a potential of one international volt by 
one international coulomb of electricity. 

"As a unit of work, the joule, which is equal to 10" units of work in 
the c. G. s. system, and which is represented sufficiently well for prac- 
tical use by the energy expended in one second by an international 
ampere in an international ohm. 

"As a unit of power, the n^att, which is equal to W units of power in 
the c. Gr. s. system, and which is represented sufficiently well for prac- 
tical use, by the work done at the rate of one joule per second. 

"As the unit of induction, the henry, which is the induction in a cir- 
cuit when the electro-motive force induced in this circuit is one inter- 
national volt, while the inducing current varies at the rate of one 
ampere per second." 

Besides the fact that the Congress in which this imjtoitant and far- 
reaching action was taken was held in the United states, our country 
has been honored by the action of the Chamber of Delegates iu placing 
in the list of the illustrious names which are to be perpetuated in the 
nomcMiclature of electricity that of our countryman, Joseph Henry, whose 
splendid contributions to science, made about sixty years ago, have 
only in recent years met with full recognition. For these and other 
reasons it is extremely desirable that our Government should be among 
the first, if not the first, to adopt the recommendations of the Chamber. 
To make the use of these units obligatory in all parts of the country 
will re(iuire an act of Congress, but in the absence of that, it is within 
the i)ower of the Secretary of the Treasury to approve their adoption 
for use in all Departments of the Government. This indeed is pre- 
cisely the course long ago followed in reference to the ordinary weights 
and measures of commerce and trade. Congress lias never enacted a 



the tiuode sliould be wrapped louud with pure lilter paper, secured at the back with 
•sealiug Avax. 

The li([uid shouhl consist of a neutral solution of pure silver nitrate, containing 
about 15 parts by weight of the nitrate to 85 parts of water. 

Tlie resistance of the voltameter changes somewhat as the current glasses. To 
prevent these changes having too great an effect on the current, some resistance 
besides that of the voltameter should be inserted in the circuit. The total metallic 
resistance of the circuit should not be less than 10 ohms.

to prepare specificationa for the Clark's cell. Their report has not yet been received.

law fixinj:^ the value of their units, but the Secretary of the Treasury 
was authorized to establish and construct standards for use iu the 
various Departments of the Government. Uniformity has followed on 
account of the universal adoption of these standards by the several 
States. 

The Government is itself a large consumer of electricity and electrical 
machinery, and for its own protection it is important that units of 
measure be adopted. With the ap])roval, therefore, of the honorable 
the Secretary of the Treasury, tlie formal adoi)tion by the Oftice of 
Standard Weights and Measures of the names and values of units of 
electrical measure as given above, the same being in accord with the 
recommendations of the International Congress of Electricians of 1893, 
has been announced. 



PHOTOGRAPHY IN THE COLORS OF NATURE.* 
By F. E. Ives. 



Heliochromy — nieaniuj;' sun-coloring — has been settled upon as a 
name for processes of photography in natural colors, or in the colors of 
nature. There are two kinds of heliochromic processes. In one, the 
light itself produces the colors by direct action upon the sensitive plate; 
in the other, light does not produce colors, but is nuide to regulate their 
distribution and combination. Some of the colors of the spectrum were 
imperfectly re produced V)y a process of the first kind nearly thirty years 
before the discovery of the Daguerreotype process. Seebeck, of Jena, 
in 1810, found that chloride of silver, after preliminary exposure to 
white light, is colored a brick-red by prolonged exposure to the red 
light of the spectrum, and a metalic blue by the blue light. After the 
discovery of the Daguerreotype process, several exiierimentalists tried 
so to modify the preparation of the chloride of silver plates as to make 
them capable of re-producin g all the colors of nature. In a photographic 
text-book published so long ago as 1853, 1 find the following statement: 
"Even the long debated question of the re-production of the natural 
colors by the agency of light seems on the point of solution. - - - 
M. Niepce de St. Victor, from whose well-known character as an exper- 
imental philosopher much might be expected, has forwarded to London, 
as we understand, specimens of proof in which every color is re pro- 
duced with a vigor and richness truly wonderful." Similar announce- 
ments have been made since that time, but the best results ever ac- 
tually shown were nothing more than interesting curosities. Dr. W. H. 
Vogel,t who recently had an opportunity to compare some of the latest 
and most talked about of these "photographs in natural colors" with 
the original colored pictures from which they were printed (by con 
tact), says: 

"The original is one of those transparent window i)ictures in bright 
colors, brought into market by Grimme and Hembel, in Leipsic, as a

substitute for j^lass painting. It represents a eui)id with yellowisli- 
brown hair and wings, and a small blue scarf around the waist, Avhose 
ends wave in the wind. He carries an avrow piercing two hearts of 
ruby color; between the knees beholds a quiver with yellow orna 
niented opening, and yellow mountings, the lower jiart of which rests, 
with the ligure, upon an idealistic thistle blossom of red leaves. The 
stem is of the same color, and the plant shows fresh green leaves. The 
picture has a pale ])lue background, and red, green, and yellow orna- 
mentation around the border in very pronounced colors. This border 
ornamentation alfords an excellent means of comparison with the print. 
The latter, in opi)osition to the bright original, shows a greenish-grey, 
partly dark, ground. At first look, one recognizes readily that of all 
the colors only the red of the original has been distinctly le-produced. 
But it is not true to nature; it has a. copper-re<l color, and differs 
decidedly from the vermilion and carmiue red of the original. Besides 
this copper red, only the blue of the scarf and the mountings of 
the cross-l)ow and (piiver come out a very pale light blue, with no 
natural resemblance. The black lines of the border decoration apjtear 
alongside of this as a violet-black. These are the tones which, to some 
extent, have a similarity of color, but with the other colors it is not so 
favorable. The yellow squares and green trapezoids of the border 
decoration appear neither yellow nor green, but have a greyish-red 
tone. The blue fields are not blue, but greenish grey, like the ground. 
It is most singular that several parts are re-i)roduced in red which 
actually are not red, but brown-yellow, as, for instance, the hair, the 
wings, the cross-bow, the thistle, etc. The green leaves in the priut 
show no fresh color, and the red leaves of the blossom and the body of 
cupid show only a pale ilesh color. - - - The resemblance of the new 
X>hotographici)ictures to natural colors is, therefore, not very favorable. 
Only two colors can be recognized distinctly in the copy, of which the 
red is the best; iu a less degree the blue, which is weaker as fiir as the 
picture is concerned. The blue iu the ornamentation around the border, 
and all other colors, either have not been re-produced at all, or are 
entirely unlike the original. - - - If I compare the sanq^le before 
me with the jyictures I have seen in 18<)7 of Niepce de St. Victor, 
Becquerel, and Dr. Zenker, I must confess that those much older pro- 
ductions were richer in color, although the tones deviated likewise con- 
siderably from the natural ones." 

According to Capt. Abney, the red end of the spectrum produces red 
by promoting oxidation; the blue end, blue, by its reducing action.* 
Prof Mendolat says: "It may at first sight appear improbable that 
the coincidence between the colors of the spectrum and the colors 
of the impressed film is a mere accident; but although this is difficult 
to believe, I venture to think that it is an accidental coincidence and 
nothing more. - - - Iu the bcvst specimens of these photo-chro- 
matic spectra that 1 have seen, the colors were certainly nothing 
more than api)roximations to the pure siH'ctrum colors; and even in 
these spectra some of the colored ettect was due to the unaltered 
groundcolor of the film in regions where sonu' particular color had 
produced no action at all."

PHOTOGRAPHY IN THE OOLORW OF NATURE. 153 

The projuress by wliicli sucli imperfect results luive been obtained is 
too slow to be applied sucessfully to eamera pliotography, and the 
results are not permanent. 

In view of all these facts, it would appear that there is no scientitic 
basis for a belief that any material improvement can ever be made in 
this process, and that all so-called progress along- this line is a delu 
sion. It is true that some distinguished photographic writers continue 
to regard every new modification of this ohl process, and every new 
result of experiment with it, as another stei> towards the ])hotographic 
re-production of the natural colors ; but I have no doubt that if the 
same writers had lived two hundred years ago they would have regarded 
the production of new yellow colored metal alloys as steps toward the 
transmutation of the baser metals into gold. 

In my opinion, the iirst step toward the solution of this problem was 
taken by Henry CoUen, (j)ueen Victoria's painting master, who, in 18G5, 
invented a plan of composite heliochromy. His plan was based upon 
a false conception of the nature of color, and means for carrying it out 
were then unknown ; but it was a bright idea, and contained the germ 
of a successful process. Collen's original communication of his idea 
appeared in Tin- Brifixh Jounuil of Photof/ropJiij, October 27, ISCto, and 
reads as follows: 

"It occurred to me this morning that if substances were discovered 
sensitive only to the primary colors — that is, one substance to each 
color — it would be i)ossible to obtain photograi>hs with the tints as m 
nature by some such means as the following: 

'•Obtain a negative sensitive to the blue rays only; obtain a second 
negative sensitive to the red rays only, and a third sensitive to the yel- 
low rays only. 

"There will thus have been three plates obtained for printing in 
colors, and each plate liaviug extracted all its own peculiar color from 
every part of the subject in which it has been combined with the other 
two colors, and being in a certain degree analogous to the tones used 
in chromo-lithography. Now, it is evitlent that if a surface be prepared 
for a positive picture, sensitive to yellow rays only, and that the two 
negatives, sensitive only to blue and ied,be super imposed either on the 
other, and be laid on this surface, the action of light will be to give all 
the yellow existing in the subject, and if this process be repeated on 
other surfaces sensitive only to red or blue, respectively, there will 
have been produced three pictures of a colored object, each of which 
contains a primitive color reflected from that object. 

"Now, supposing the first great object achieved, viz., the discovery 
of substances or preparations, each having sensitiveness to each of the 
l)rimary colors only, it will not be difficult to imagine that the nega- 
tives being received on the surface of a material quite transparent and 
extremely thin, and that being so obtained are used as above, /. e., each 
l)air of superimposed negatives to obtain the color of the third^that 
three positives will be obtained, each representing a considerable por- 
tion of the form of the object, but only one iirimary of the decomposed 
color of it. Now, if these three positives be received on the same kind 
of material as that used for the negatives and be then laid the one on 
the other, with true coincidence as to the form, and all laid upon a 



164 PHOTOGRAPHY IN THE COLORS OF NATURE. 

white surface, it will not be difficult to imagine that the effect would 
be not only the representation of the form of the object, but that of its 
color also in all its compounds. 

******* 

"Although the idea I have endeavored to express in words maybe 
utterly worthless, I am unwilling to let it slij) away without notice, as 
it may on the other hand contain a germ which may grow and bear 
fruit in due season." 

The language of some parts of this communication is ambiguous, but, 
taken altogether, with due allowance for the writer's unfamiliarity with 
photogra|)hic technology, it clearly amounts to a suggestion to make 
three photographic negatives of an object — one by the action of red 
light, one by yellow, one by blue; to print from each i)air of these nega- 
tives (sui)erposed as one) a transparent positive having the color repre- 
sented by the third negative, and to superpose on a white surface the 
three prints thus obtained. 

It was not possible to carry out Collen's suggestion at that time, 
because there was no known process by which plates could be prepared 
which were sensitive to single colors only, and no photograpliic plates 
were sensitive enough to red and yellow to admit of the i)ro(l notion of 
such negatives by exposure through selective color screens. Had it 
been possible to carry it out, the results must have been very imperfect, 
not only because the entire procedure is based upon a false and mislead- 
ing theory of color, but also because superposing two negatives to act 
as one would double the intensity of such parts as represented Avhite, 
gray, or pale colored objects, with the result that if the color prints 
were made to show all the details of the negatives, the finished helio- 
chromes would show all l)right colors as if mixed with e(iual parts of 
black pigment. 

On November 23, 18G8, DucosDuhauron,of Paris, applied for apatent* 
for a process which differed from C-olleu's only in the manner of carry- 
ing out the same idea. Like Collen, he assumed that the spectrum is 
made up of three primary color rays and mixtures thereof. He said, 
"My procedure rests on the principle that the simple colors are limited 
to three — the red, the yellow, and the blue — the combination of which 
in divers pToportionsproduces the infinite variety of shades in nature.*' 
LikeCoUen, he expected to solve the problem by superposing red, yellow, 
and blue prints taken from negatives made by yellow and blue, red and 
l)lue, and yellow and red light. But, instead of using plates sensitive to 
single colors only, he proposed to use plates sensitive to all colors, and to 
prevent the action of color rays not wanted by filtering them out with 
color screens i)laced in front of the photographic objective or sensitive 
plate; and, instead of superposing two negatives to act as one, from 
Avhich to make the color prints, he i)roposed to make two colors (two- 
thirds of the spectrum rays) act to produce each negative, which

amounts to the same thing, ami would not obviate the defect I have 
mentioned as resulting from the doubling of intensity on uncolored 
objects. Heproposed to make one negative through an "orange" screen, 
calculated to absorb the blue light and transmit the red and yellow; 
one through a "violet" screen, calculated to absorb the yellow light and 
transmit the blue and red; one through a "green" screen, calculated 
to absorb the red light and transmit the yellow and blue. 

It was no more possible to carry out this idea in Duhauron's way in 
1808, than to carry it out in Collen's way in 1805. It is true, Duhauron 
tried to carry it out, and showed, specimens of work, but the red and 
yellow rays did not act on his sensitive plates,* and he admitted, in a 
communication to the French Photographic Society,! that ''the pro- 
duction of good results will - - - involve the manufacture of com- 
pounds which have not yet been created." 

Soon after Duhauron showed his lirst specimens, Charles Cros, of 
Paris, published another modification of Collen's plau.| I^ike Collen, 
Cros proposed to make one negative by the action of red light, one by 
yellow, and one by blue, but by exposing the sensitive plates through 
red, yellow, and blue screens instead of employing plates sensitive to 
single colors only. Instead of superposing each pair of these nega- 
tives to make each color print, he proposed to make a green print 
from the negative made by red light, a violet print from the negative 
made by yellow light, and an orange print from the negative made by 
the blue light. He also suggested that ordinary positive prints made 
from these negatives might be illuminated each by the kind of light 
which it represented, and the three combined by the aid of suitable 
optical devices so as to form a single picture, showing all the colors. 
Cros's plan, although it could not succeed, because based upon the 
same false and misleading theory as that accepted by Collen and 
Duhauron, nevertheless possessed one important advantage over the 
preceding methods: it was free from the defect of doubling intensity on 
those parts of the negatives representing pale or uncolored objects. 
But this advantage would be lost again in the production of green, 
violet, and orange colored prints, which will combine to reproduce 
yellows and blues only with a degree of degradation comparable to 
that produced by Duhauron's method. 

On December 3, 1809, M. Poiree, of Paris, in a communication to the 
Photographic Society of France, § expressed doubts concerning the cor- 
rectness of Duhauron's and Cros's theories, and suggested that better 
results might be had by making a greater number of negatives — a sep- 
arate negative for each spectrum region. He said, " The process which 
seems likelj^ to succeed best is that in which the colors are analyzed by

isolating successively each ray, or at least tlie rays of the same shade. 
- - - This analysis is difficult to make with colored glasses; it 
might be done, as by Newton, by monochromatic lighting and succes- 
sive exposures to simjile rays of the same shade. - - - Tlie synthe- 
sis is made by means of black i)ositive images and rays of the same 
nature as those which produced the corresponding negatives. - - - 
It will then only be necessary to jdace one above another the colored 
images so obtained, so as to form one virtually and really. It will be 
identical with the model, because it will be lormed by the same rays, in 
the same relation of intensity." This also couhl not then be carried 
out because no photographic sensitive plates were sufficiently sensitive 
to yellow, orange, and red spectrum rays. 

In 1873, Br. H. W. Vogel discovered that bromide of silver can be 
made sensitive to the less refrangible spectrum rays by treatment with 
certain dyes, and the subseqiuMit discovery of other and better color 
sensitisers supplied the means for carrying out cither Collen's oiPoiree's 
idea. 

Duhauron, one of the first to avail himself of these discoveries, made 
some practical progress, and, in 187G, abandoned Brewster's color theory 
and ])ateute<l a modified process,* based ni)on the observation that, 
while there appeared to be seren " principal " spectrum colors, three 
coloring substances wonld " serve to express them." The coloring sub- 
stances he named for this purpose are blue, carmine, and yellow, and he 
decided that, in order to make such a i)rocess rejn'oduce the colors of 
nature, the negatives should be made by the action of orange, green, 
and violet spectrum rays, Avhich are complementary to the coloring sub- 
stances. Some i)ersons have thought that he had the idea of making 
negatives to represent i)rimary color sensations, but this sui)positionis 
negatived, not only by the absence of any de(;laration to that effect, 
but also by the fact that orange does not represent a primary color sen- 
sation, either in fact or according to any theory recorded in the text- 
books, and the violet rays are not the ones which most i)Owerfully excite 
the blue (violet) vsensation. The plan was also utterly indefinite as 
regards the relative effect of intermediate spectrum rays, and Duhau- 
ron himself, owing to the fact that he never tried the method upon the 
spectrum, had no accurate knowledge of its capabilities. In his latest 
and perfected process (1878) t he employed no plate sensitive to 
either red or orange light. One negative was made chiefly by yellow 
light, another by green, and the third chiefly by violet and invisible 
nltra-violet rays. 

Albert, of Munich, also took advantage of the discovery of color 
sensitisers to try to carry out Collen's principle according to Duhau-

ron's original plan. He was the first to make the color prints by the 
collotype process, which led to the use of the term " chromo-collotype." 

In 1870, Cros* abandoned the idea that red, yellow, and blue are pri- 
mary spectrum colors, but still held that there are three primary colors 
and mixtures thereof, and that these primary colors are orauge, green, 
and violet. Ijike Dnhauron, he decided to make negatives by light of 
these colors and i)rints in blue, red, and yellow. 

In 1884, Dr. F. Stolze, of Berlin, made a series of investigations and 
tried to solve the problem by devising a procedure more in accordance 
with Young's theory of color.t He said: "Although the colors corre- 
spond with certain external processes in nature, there is also no doubt 
that color as such is nothing objective, but a subjective sensation, based 
upon the peculiar irritation of the visual nerves by those external pro- 
ceedings. We can, therefore, only hope to produce a picture in natural 
colors when we are enabled to reproduce u])ou the same the proceedings 
which furnish to us the color impression. The general idea of all colcu'S 
being based upon the three principal colors, red, yellow, and blue, is 
an erroneous one. Thomas Young - - - assunu'S tliat there are 
three kinds of nerve fibers sensible to red, green, and violet. Objective 
homogenous light excites all three; but with red the iirst is excited 
strongly, the second and third weakly; with blue, the second and third 
moderately strong, the first weakly; with violet, finally, the third 
strongly, and the first and second weakly. If all three kinds of nerve 
fibers are eijually strongly excited the impression of white light will 
take place." 

This theory in accordance with which Dr. Stolze tried to devise a 
theoretical solution of the problem is only partly correct, measurements 
by Clerk Maxwell and others having shown that the red sensation is 
neither afi'ected by blue-green, blue, or violet rays, nor the blue (vio- 
let) sensation by red, orange, or yellow rays, nor the green sensation 
by red or violet rays. Neither is it the red rays that chiefiy excite the 
red sensation, nor the violet rays that chiefly excite the blue (violet) 
sensation. 

As a result of elaborate calculations, which, it must be said, could 
just as well have been made without any reference to Y^oung's theory 
of color, Dr. Stolze came to the conclusion that if three suitable selec- 
tive color screens Avere used in connection with color sensitive plates 
three negatives of the spectrum might be obtained, from which i^rints 
in cyan blue, carmine, and yellow, if superposed, would reproduce the 
color eflect of the spectrum. He did not show how to make selective 
color screens calculated to secure the right kind of negatives to carry 
out this idea, iior state what should be the form of the intensity curves 
in such negatives of the spectrum. He merely gave a table, showing

on what parts of the spectrum each negative shoukl fix color, and said : 
" If successful - - in selecting the color screens in such a man- 

ner that they will let the color pass through which are called for in this 
table, one will indeed be able to reproduce a pure spectrum in this 
way." By further calculations he was able to show that this plan, even 
if successfully carried out, would not insure the correct reproduction 
of mixed colors. He said: "All pure saturated spectrum colors will 
also be obtained quite satisfactorily in the reproduction, but the mixed 
ones only partly." " Oftentimes they have to become more or less 
impure.'' " But the clearest lights and a number of mixed colors 
appear very unsatisfactory ." He added : " The intelligent support of 
the artist can leiul improvement,'' and recommended also the produc- 
tion of a fourth (ordinary) negative, to be used in combination with 
the others, to modify the effect, especially in high lights. 

This plan can not be said to definitely represent the application of 
Young's theory of color, but it may be practically better than any- 
thing that that theory would indicate if we leave out of account the 
suggestion of a fourth negative. 

In 1885, Dr.Vogel publisheda plan, which isamoditication of Poiree's.* 
Like Poiree, ho proposed to nuxke a separate negative for each spectrum 
region; but, instead of using plates sensitive to all colors and exposing 
through selective color screens, or illumiiuiting the subject by mono- 
chromatic lights, Vogel proposed to sensitise plates specially for each 
spectrum region, which would amount to the same thing, and instead 
of projecting the pictures with colored lights, he proposed to make as 
many pigment i)rints as negatives, each in a color complementary to 
the light which acted to produce the respective negative, and to super- 
pose them as in the Collen method. 

There are no known dyes witli which this plan could be carried out; 
and even if there were, it is, I believe, too complicated to be practic- 
able. 

In February, 1888,t I demonstrated a procedure based upon the 
assumption that although there are more than three or five or seven 
primary spectrum colors, all of them — and in fact all the colors of 
nature — can be counterfeited to the eye by three type colors and mix- 
tures thereof. This was not a new observation, and my iilan did not 
differ very materially from that of Dr. Stolze, minus the complication of a 
fourth negative, except that it was more definite; and instead of merely 
publishing it as a suggestion, I found means to carry it out, and made a 
practical demonstration of it. I proved the process by photograijhing 
the spectrum itself, employing compound color screens carefully 
adjusted to secure definite intensity curves in the spectrum negatives, 
so that they would make color prints which counterfeited the color 
effect of the spectrum when superposed. The adjustment of plates

aud screens to secxiTe sjiectrtim negatives having definite intensity curves, 
which I believe had never before been done, made all the difference 
between an indefinite and uncertain method and one definite and pre- 
cise. 

Promising results were obtained by this process, but I soon came to 
the conclusion, already reached by Dr. Stolze, that a process miglit 
re produce the color eft'ect of the spectrum, and yet not be capable of 
re-producing- perfectly the compound colors. The solution of the prob- 
lem was incomplete until I discovered a new principle, according to 
which such a procedure can be made to re-produce not only the spectrum, 
but also all the hues of nature. 

This new principle, first stated by mc in a communication to this 
institution on November 21, 18S8,* is that of making sets of negatives 
by the action of light rays in proportion as they excite primary color 
sensations, and images or prints from such negatives with colors that 
represent primary color sensations. 

In order to understand this principle, T must explain that although 
the spectrum is not made uj* of three lands of color rays and mixtures 
thereof, the eye is only capable of three primary color sensations, a dis- 
tinction of the utmost importance, for the reason that the spectrum 
rays, which most powerfully excite a ]irimary color sensation, are not 
the ones which represent the character of that sensation. The primary 
sensations are red, green, and blue (violet); but it is not the red, 
green, and violet spectrum rays that most powerfully excite these sen- 
sations. According to Cleric Maxwell, the orange spectrum rays excite 
the red sensation more strongly than the brightest red rays, but also 
excite the green sensation; the greenish -yellow rays excite the green 
sensation more strongly than the purest green rays, but also excite the 
red sensation; the yellow rays excite the red sensation as intensely as 
the brightest red rays and the green sensation as intensely as the pur- 
est green rays. 

The carrying out of my new ])rinciple, according to Maxwell's meas- 
urements, therefore, involves the production of one negative by the 
joint action of the red, orange, yellow, and yellow-green rays, in defi- 
nite proportions, to represent the red sensation ; one by the joint action 
of the orange, yellow, green, and green-blue rays, in definite ijropor- 
tions, to represent the green sensation; and one by the joint action of 
the blue green, blue, and violet rays, in definite proportions, to repre- 
sent the blue sensation. 

Negatives of the required character can be made by exposing a cya- 
nine-stained gelatine-bromide plate through a double screen of chryso- 
idine-orange and aniline-yellow of suitable intensity for the red sensa- 
tion, a cyanine-erythrosine gelatine-bromide ])late through a screen of 
aniline yellow of suitable intensity for the green sensation, and an ordi- 
nary gelatine-bromide plate through a double screen of crysophenine-

yellow and li II methyl violet for the blue sensation. The jDlates aud 
screens are correct when they will secure negatives of the spectrum 
showing" intensity curves substantially like the curves in Maxwell's 
diagram. The negatives can also be made on certain makes of ordinary 
commercial gelatine bromide plates of the most rapid kind, by the use 
of quite diflerent color screens for the tirst two, but only with expos- 
ures of from five to fifteen minutes on well-lighted landscapes, aperture 
of objective, /-12. 

lu photographing objects in a changing light — laudvscapes, for 
instance, — it is important that the three sensitive plates be exposed simul- 
taneously; and in order to accomplish this, I devise a triple camera, hav- 
ing three lenses so arranged in connection with reflectors as to bring all 
the i)oiiits of view within a oue-iuch circle. With this camera, the pro- 
duction of sets of negatives of the required character is a simple and 
easy matter, it being only necessary to insert the plates, raise the flap 
until the exposure is made, take the plates out again, and, when con- 
venient, to develop them together in the ordinary way. 

There are two ways of making the heliochromic pictures from these 
uegatives. The tirst method does not produce a permanent picture, 
but a screen i^rojection. 

Lantern slides made from the heliocliromic negatives and exactly 
reversing their light and shade must also represent the effect of the 
object ui)oii the respective color sensations. One lantern positive, 
when seen by transparency in red light, re-produces tlie eflect of the 
object u]»<)n the primary red sensation. Another, viewed in the same 
manner by green light, re-produces the effect of the object upon the 
green sensation. The third, viewed by blue-violet light, re produces 
the effect upon the blue sensation. Evidently the combination of these 
three images into one must form a re-i»roduction of the object as seen 
by the eye, correct in form, color, and light, and shade. Such a com- 
bination is effected by projecting the three pictures with a triple optical 
lantern, so that they exactly coincide u|»(m the screen. The result is 
what we have been je<l to expect. 

We have here a true solution of the jtroblem of re-producing the 
colors of nature in a screen picture, <lating from November, 1888. Pre- 
vious to the publication of my new principle it was assumed by Cros, 
Poiree, and others, that if the projection method were emi)]oyed each 
picture should be ijvojected by the same kind of rays as those which 
acted to produce it. In my method, as I have already stated, a i)icture 
made by the joint action of red, orange, yellow, and yellow-green rays, 
but chiefly by orange, instead of being projected by a similar mixture 
of spectrum raj'^s,is projected by red rays only. Similarly, the picture 
made by orange, yeUow, green, and green-blue rays is projected by 
green rays only, and that made by blue-green, blue, and violet rays, 
by blue- violet rays only. 

]Jr. Stolze, who was one of the tirst to recognize the genuineness of 
this solution of the problem, doubted if, even in theory, color prints 



PHOTOGRAPHY IN THE COLORS OP NATURE. 161 

from the same kind of negatives could be made to furnish such a per- 
fect solution. A year ago I also believed that there were theoreti(;al 
difficulties in the way of realizing a i^erfect process with color prints. 
< )nly recently have I succeeded in showing what relation the colors of 
the prints must bear to the colors of light used in projection, in order 
to perform exactly the same function and, under like conditions of illu- 
mination, secure ecjually perfect fulfillment of theoretical requirements. 

In the projecting method, we build up the luminous image by adding 
light to light. White light is produced by the mixture of the three 
colored lights used for projection, and black by their suppression 
But when we carry out the process to produce permanent pictures, the 
paper which may form the basis of the picture is itself white, and it is 
the shadows that are built up by the super-position of color prints. 

Nevertheless, the color print has exactly the same function to perform 
as the lantern positive, i. e., to absorb and suppress by its shading, 
light affecting one primary color sensation. If we remove our tliree 
positives from the lantern, the screen is evenly illuminated with white 
light. If we then replace the one representing the green sensation, its 
shadows will absorb the green light with the result that the screen bears 
a picture in the complementary color, pink, on a white ground. In the 
color-print method we commence with a white surface which corresponds 
to the fully illnniinated screen, and the shadows of the color print repre- 
senting the green sensation, when laid upon this surface, absorb the 
same kind of rays as the shadows of the positive in the lantern, and 
with the same result, a pink monochrome picture on a white ground. 
Superposing tlie other two color prints upon the first one on paper is 
like inserting the other two positives in the lantern. This explains why 
the primary sensations are represented by ijrints having shades of the 
comjjlementary (absorbing) color. It is the lights and not the shades 
of the color prints that represent the effect upon the respective primary 
color sensation. It is only necessary to use dyes that comjiletely absorb 
red light but neither green nor blue-violet for the print representing 
the red sensation, green but neither red nor blue-violet for the green 
sensation, blue-violet but neither red nor green for the blue sensation, in 
order to obtain from my negatives a color print heliochrome that exactly 
fultills all theoretical requirements, provided that it be examined in the 
same kind of white light that we obtain in the screen projections by 
mixing red, green, and blue- violet rays. The dyes mentioned by me in 
my ])aper of November 21, 1888 (Prussian blue, aniline-magenta, and 
aniline-yellow), fulfill this requirement, and color-print heliochromes 
made therewith according to my instructions must therefore re-produce 
all the colors of nature under the conditions of illumination just stated. 

In order to obtain colors that would appear of exactly the right kind 
and shade in ordinary white light, it would be necessary to use dyes 
each of which completely absorbed all light affecting the color sensa- 
tion ^^■hi<•h it represented, but no other. The colors would then be 
correct in ordinary white light, but would appear too dark, relatively, 
SM 93 11 



162 PHOTOGRAPHY IN THE COLORS OF NATURE. 

to the white grouud. In order to obtain colors that would appear 
brighter in ordinary white light, dyes may be used which completely 
absorb only rays that excite chiefly single primary sensations and other 
rays in due proportion. The dyes i)roposed by me also fulfil this 
requirement, so that even in ordinary white light the degradation of a 
color is insignificant except in the greens, where it is noticeable. 

I have seen some of the results produced by the older process of 
composite helichromy, and others who have also seen them will I am 
sure bear me out when I say that the colors have invariably been 
not only untrue, but either very dull or else flat and patchy and want- 
ing in the delicate details and gradations of light and shade which 
characterize good monochrome photographs. All that showed bright 
colors resembled nothing so nuich as cheap chromos. In the compo- 
site heliochromes by my i)rocess, which I show to-night, the colors 
are, as you can see, as perfect in detail and gradation as the mono- 
chrome shades of an ordinary photograph. - - - 

In photochromy it is only necessary for the photographer to make one 
negative of the object to be re-produced, and this negative contains a 
register of form and Hght and shade only. Coniposite heliochromy can 
not be carried out with less than three negatives, which must contain 
a register not only of form and light and sluide, but of color also. In 
photochromy an artist is employed to regulate the distribution of col- 
ors, at'cording to his taste or judgment; in composite heliochromy it is 
the light itself which regulates their distribution and combination, 
automatically, according to fixed and true scientific i)rinciples. Photo- 
chromy is an art; comi)Osite heliochromy a science. - - - 

In conclusion I will say that in order to carry out the process in 
strict accordance with the theoretical reijuirements, means must be 
employed not only to secure three negatives and three x)rints, each of 
which is correct by itself, but each must bear also a certain deflnite 
relation to the others. A very little over or under exposure of any 
one color print, or a vei-y little too much oi' too little of the color stuff 
in the film, will change the shade of delicate colors. Fortunately, 
there is a simple optical test by which such a defect can be detected 
without reference to, or knowledge of, the colors of the object i)hoto- 
graphed; but at present it is diflicult to secure such harmony of ])arts 
when but little time can be spared to devote to the operation of the 
process. Composite heliochromy nuist always remain a comparatively 
costly process when carried out in a manner calculated to yield the finest 
results, and can most profitably be brought before the public in the 
form of optical lantern lecture illustrations, not Avith the triple lan- 
tern, but with transparent colorprint helio-chromes mounted as lan- 
tern slides. 



PHOTOGRAPHS IN NATURAL COLORS, BY THE PROCESS 

OF L. LUMIERE.* 



By Leon Wakneuke. 



About two years ago Prof. Lippmauu, of the Sorbouue, at Paris, 
succeeded iu producing- photograpliically a colored image of the sohir 
spectrum, based on the well-known priuci]>les of interference. He used 
for that purpose a plate coated with au albumen, collodion, or gelatin 
sensitive film. This sensitive film was during exposure brought into 
contact with metallic mercury, the image of the spectrum being pro- 
jected on the film, through its glass support. The light, after i)euetrat- 
ing through the thickness of the film, was reflected back from the sur- 
face of the mercury, the direct light waves encountering the waves of 
reflected light, producing the i^heuomeuon of interference in the thick- 
ness of the film. The waves of light propagating iu opposite direc- 
tions cause the vibrations at certain intervals to be neutralized, while 
at others they are intensified. H' such a plate could be developed, 
fixed, and dissected, we should find it to consist of strata of the black 
deposit of silver, produced by the developer in the parts corresponding 
with the maximum of light succeeded by transparent strata, correspond- 
ing to the minimum of light, where the developer had no action. The 
distance between the strata is equal to half the wave length, which is 
600 ten-thousandths of a millimeter for red light, 583 for orange, 551 
for yellow, 475 for blue, and 423 for violet. In a film of tA millimeter 
thickness there will be about 200 such strata. It is evident that on 
examining such a plate by refiected light we should observe the colors, 
because it is formed of a series of films of the thickness requisite to 
produce color sensations. 

Subsequent experiments proved that by using a gelatin film, sensi- 
tised with a chromium salt, a similar result is obtaineu, the action of 
interference producing strata of soluble and insoluble gelatin. 

The exposure of the plates produced by Lippmann was very long, 
and, owing to the variation of sensitiveness of different rays of the 
spectrum, necessitated the masking of the i^ortions exi^osed to the more 
actinic rays while the others are exposed. L. Lnmiere succeeded in 
producing colored images in one operation, and in last May, in a paper

being very thin the washing is soon effected. This emulsion should not 
be washed in bulk, lest coarseness of the particles of silver produced 
by re-heating results, and in order to leave the films as transparent as

When I was honored by the iuvitatiou to deliver this lecture I felt 
some doubt as to my ability to tiud a subject which should be suitable, 
for there is a prevailing idea that, in addressing- the operative classes, 
it is necessary to speak only of some practical subject which bears 
immediately npou the most important industry of the place in which 
the lecture is being delivered ; but it seems to me that this is a polite 
suggestion that the audience are unable to be interested by any subject 
except that particular one which occupies them daily. Now, though I 
am a comparative stranger in Scotland, I have heard quite enough and 
I know quite enough, of the superiority of the education of yon, who 
have the good fortune to live in this the most beautiful half of Great 
Britain, to be aw^are that, as is the case with all highly educated men, 
you are able to take a keen and genuine interest in many subjects, and 
that I had better choose one to which I have specially devoted myself, 
if I do not wish to expose myself to the risk of being corrected. I 
will ask you therefore in imagination, to leave your daily occupation 
and come with me into the i)hysical laboratory, where, by the exercise 
of the art of the experimentalist, problems which might seem to be 
impossible are continually being solved. I wish as an experimentalist 
to present to yon an example of experimental inquiry. 

Let us suppose that for some reason we wish to examine carefully and 
accurately some moving object travelling, if you will, at so great a 
speed tliat, observed in the ordinary way, it appears as a mere blur, or 
X)erhaps at a speed so tremendous that it can not be seen at all. In 
such a case, in order to get a clear view of the moving body we may 
either look through an aperture which is only opened for a moment as 
the body passes by, or we may suddenly illuminate the object by a 
flash of light when it is in a i)Osition in which it may be seen. If in 
either of these cases the hole is 0[)en, or the illumination lasts so short 
a time that the object has no time to move appreciably while it is in

tin's way brought into view, we get what may in ordinary language be 
called an instantaneous impression aud the object apj^ears clear, sharp, 
and at rest. In the same way if we wish, with the object of obtaining 
a permanent record, to photograph a moving body Tve must either allow 
the eye of the camera to see through a hole for a moment, L e., we must 
use a rapid shutter — and many such are mcU known — or we must, keep- 
ing the photographic plate exposed and the object in the dark, make a 
flash of liglit at the right time. As before, if the shutter is open or the 
flash lasts so short a time that the object can not move appreciably in 
the time, then, if any impression is left at all, it will be sharp, clear, and 
the same as if the body were at rest. The first method, that of the 
shutter, I do not intend to speak about to-night, but as, owing to the 
kindness of Mr. F. J. Smith, I have with me the most beautiful example 
that I have seen of what can be done by this method, I thought per- 
haps I should do well to show it. Mr. Smith was in an express train 
near Taunton, travelling at forty miles an hour, and when another 
express was coming up in the o})posite direction at sixty miles an hour, 
i. f., approaching him at one hundred miles an hour, he aimed his 
camera at it and let a shutter of his own construction open and shut so 
quickly that the approaching train was photogra]>hed sharply. There 
is a special interest al)out this photograph; it shows one of the now 
extinct broad-gauge engines on the road. However, this is an example 
of the method which we shall not consider this evening.* For our pur- 
])ose we require what is called instantaneous illumination — a flash of 
light. It is of course obvious that it depends entirely upon the speed 
of the object and the sharpness required, whether any particular flash 
is instantaneous enough. No flash is absolutely instantaneous, though 
some may last a very short time. 

For instance, a flash of burning magnesium powder lasts so short a 
time that it may be used for the purpose of portraiture, and while it 
lasts even the eye itself has no time to change. PI. ii, fig. 1, represents 
a photograph of the eye of Mr, Colebrook after he had been some minutes 
in a dark room, taken by the magnesium flash ; the same eye taken in day- 
light appears in PI. ii, fig, 2. The pu])il is seen fully dilated and the 
eyelid has not had time to come down, and so we might reasonably say 
that the flash was instantaneous; it was for the purpose practically 
instantaneous. Yet when 1 make this large clock fiice, 4 feet across, 
revolve at so moderate a speed that the periphery is only travelling at 
40 miles an hour and illuminate it by a magnesium flash you see no 
figures or marks at all, only a blur. Thus the magnesium tlash, which 
for one purpose is practically instantaneous, is, tested in this simple 
M ay, found to last a long time. Let me now, following Lord Rayleigh, 
contrast the effect of the magnesium flash with that of a powerful electric 
spark. At each spark the clock face appears brilliantly illuminated

and absolutely at rest and clear, and if it were not that I could at once 
illuminate it by ordinary liglit it would be difficult to believe tliat it was 
still in motion. 

The electric spark lias been often used to produce a flasli by means 
of which phenomena have been observed which we ordinarily can not 
see. For instance, Mr. Worthington has in this way seen and drawn 
the exact form of the splash produced by a falling drop of liquid. 

Mr. Chichester Bell, Lord Eayleigh, Mr. F.J. Smith, and others have 
used the illumination produced by an electric spark to photograph 
ph«'nomena which they Avere investigating. I am able to show one of 
Lord Eayleigh's, a breaking soap bubble, in which the retreating 
edge, travelling something like 30 miles an hour, is seen with all the 
accuracy and sharpness that is possible with a stationary object. Mr. 
F. J. Smith has extended the use of sparks for the purpose of physi- 
ological inquiry, taking a row of photographs on a moving plate at 
intervals that can be arranged to suit the subject, and is thus putting 
in the hands of the much-abused experimental physiologist a very pow- 
erful weapon of research. I had hoped to show oue of these series of 
an untechnical character, to wit, a series taken of a cat held by its four 
legs in an inverted position and allowed to drop. The cat, as every 
one is aware, seems to do that which is known to be dynamically 
impossible, namely, on being dropped ui:>side down to turn round after 
being let go and to come down the right way up. The process can be 
followed by means of one of Mr. Smith's multiple spark photographs. 
However, his cats do not seem to like the experiments, and he has in 
consequence had so much trouble with them that his results, while 
they are of interest, are not, up to the present, suitable for exhibition. 

Let me now return to single spark photographs. We have seen that 
the magnesium flash, which for the purpose of portraiture is practically 
instantaneous, yet fails to appear so when so moderate a speed as 40 
miles an hour (iind indeed a far lower S|)e<'d) is used for the purpose of 
examining it. Is anything of the kind true in the case of the electric 
spark ? Will the spark, by which we saw the clock-face absolutely 
sharp, after all fail to give a sharp view when tested by a much higher 
speed? 1 have taken such a spark and attempted (though I knew 
what the result would be) to photograph by its light the l)nllet of a 
magazine rifle passing by at the rate of about 2,100 feet a second, or, 
Avhat is the same thing, at about 1,400 miles an hour; the result (PI. ii, 
fig. 3) shows not a clear, sharp bullet, but a blur; the spark lasted so 
long a time that this bullet was actually able to travel half an inch or 
so while the illumination lasted. Thus Ave see, that if we wish to exam- 
ine bullets, etc., in their flight, any electric spark will not necessarily 
do. We shall have to get a spark which while it gives enough light to 
act on the plate yet lasts so short a time that even a rifle bullet can 
not move an ax^preciable distance during the time that it is in exist- 
ence. 



168 ELECTRIC-SPARK PHOTOGRAPHS. 

A knowledge of electrical principles enables one to modify the elec- 
trical apparatus employed to make this spark in such a manner that its 
duration may be greatly reduced without, at the same time, a very great 
sacrifice of light ; but while this may be done it is important to be able to 
observe how long the spark actually lasts when made by apparatus 
altered little by little m the proper manner. The desired information 
is at once given by the revolving mirror. For instance, every one is 
aware how, by the turn of the wrist, one may reflect a beam of sunlight 
from a piece of looking glass so as to travel up the street at a most tre- 
mendous velocity; but sui)pose that, instead of being moved by a mere 
turn of the wrist, the mirror is made to rotate on an axle by mechanical 
means at an enormous speed; then, Just as the rotation is more rapid, 
so will the beam of liglit travel at a higher speed. In the particular 
case that I am now going to bring before your notice, a small mirror of 
hardened steel was made by Mr. Colebrook, the mechanical assistant 
in tlie i»hysical laboratory at South Kensington, mounted so beautifully 
that it would run at the enormous speed of 1,000 turns a second (not 
1,000 a minute) without giving any trouble. The light from the spark 
was focused by the mirror upon the photographic plate. Now, if the 
light were really instantaneous, the image would be as clear and sharp 
as if the mirror were at rest; if, on the other hand, it lasted long enough 
for the image to be carried an appreciable distance, then the photo- 
graph would show a band of light drawn out to this distance. The 
mirror is now placed on the front of the platform, and a beam of electric 
light is focused by it upon the screen, from which it is distant about 
20 feet. Now that 1 turn the mirror slowly you see the spot of light 
drawn out into a band reacliing across the screen, and this is described 
over and over again as the mirror revolves. Let us suppose that the 
mirror is revolving once a second, then it is easy to show that the spot 
of light is travelling at about 250 feet a second. It is not difticult, there- 
fore, to see that if the mirror is revolving 1,000 times as fast the spot 
of light wmII traverse the screen 1,000 times as fast also, i. e., about 
250,000 feet a second, or 100,000 miles an hour, a speed which is 200 
times as great as that of a Martini Henry bullet, while such a bullet 
only travels 14 times as fast as an express train. You will see, then, 
that it is not difficult to observe how long a spark lasts when its image 
can be whirled along at such a speed as this. I have now started the 
electromotor, and the mirror is turning more and more rapidly. Now 
it gives a musical note of the same pitch as that given by the tuning 
fork I am bowing; it is therefore turning 512 times a second. It is now 
giving a higher note, i. e., it is turning faster and faster, until at last it 
gives the octave, at which time it is turning 1,028 turns a second. The 
band of light on the screen is produced by a spot now travelling at a 
still higher speed than that which I have just mentioned. 

I had hoped to have shown with this apparatus the actual experi- 
ment of drawing out the apparently instantaneous flash of an electric 



ELECTRIC-SPARK PHOTOGRAPHS. 169 

spark into a band of light, but I found that while it was easy to show 
the experiment in a small room, the amount of light was not sufficient 
to be seen in a ^reat room like this. I must therefore be content to 
show one or two of the photographs which were taken lately in the 
physical laboratory at South Kensington by two of the students, Mr. 
Edser and Mr. Stansfield, whom I now take the opportunity of thank- 
ing. The next slide shows the drawn-out band of a particular spark 
made between magnesium terminals by the discharge of a condenser 
of 2i square feet of window-glass, the S[»ark being ^ inch long. Below 
the drawn-out band I have drawn a scale of niillionths of a second. 
If the spark had been instantaneous it would have appeared as a fine 
vertical line. This line however has been drawn sideways to an extent 
depending on the duration of the spark. The spark, except at the 
ends, is extinct in rather less than oneniillionth of a second, but the 
ends remain alight like two stars, being drawn out in consequence into 
two lines, which have lasted, as measured by the scale, as long as six 
or seven millionths of a second. Such a light is, therefore, seen to last 
when tested with this very powerful instrument so long that it seems 
absurd to call it instantaneous. It lasts too long for the purpose of 
bullet photography. In order to get sparks of shorter duration it is 
necessary to abolish the metal magnesium, in spite of the brilliant 
l)hotographic effect of the two ends of the spark between knobs of this 
material; it is well to avoid all easily volatile metals, such as brass, 
because of the zinc that it contains, and instead to employ beads of 
copper or of platinum. In the second place, the duration of the spark 
proper, which in the last case was nearly a millionth of a second, can 
be reduced by (1) reducing the size of the condenser, but one must not 
go too far, as the light is reduced also; {2) by replacing any wire 
through which the discharge may have taken place by broad bands of 
cojyper as short as possible; this has the further advantage of increas- 
ing the light; and (3) the light maybe increased without much change 
being made in the duration by making a second gap in the discharge 
circuit, the spark in which however must be hidden from the plate, 
ri. II, fig. 4, shows the trail of the best spark for the purpose of 
bullet photography that I have obtained up to the present. In this 
case the surface of the condenser is 1 square foot, and the discharge 
is taken througli bands of copper about 2 inches broad, and not more 
than about 4 inches long apiece. Extra good contact is made between 
these copper bands and the tinfoil surface by long radiating tongues 
of copper-foil soldered to the end of the copper bands. The knobs are 
})latinum, but this seems no better than copper. The whole of the light 
is extinct in less than one-millionth of a second, while the first blaze, 
which is practically the whole spark (the tail being in comparison of no 
consequence) does not last so long as a ten-millionth of a second ; in other 
words, itlastsosliortatinu' thatitbears the same relation to one second 
that one second bears to four months; or again, a magazineritie bullet,

travelling- at the enormous si)ee(i that is now attained by the use of this 
weapon, can not go more than one four-hundredth of an inch in this 
time. Other sjiarks of still less duration were examined, but this was 
chosen for the purpose of photograpliing bullets.* 

Now, having obtained a suitable flash of light, I must next show how 
a spark may be used for the purpose of photographing a bullet in its 
passage. This was first d<me by Prof. E. Mach,t of Prague, whose 
method is illustrated by the diagram, PI. ii, fig. 5. The squares on the 
right-hand side represent certain electrical apparatus by means of which 
a Leyden jar (J) is charged with electricity to such an extent that, 
while it is unable to make two sparks at B and A, it is nevertheless 
able to, and at once will, make a spark at B when the second gap at A 
is closed by a bullet or other conductor. The dotted lines represent 
wires throngh which the discharge then takes place. The spark at B, 
magnified by the lens I in front of it, then fills the field lens L with 
light, so that the camera K locused upon the spark gap A will then 
receive an image of the bullet as it passes, and thus a photograph is 
secured. I am able to show two of these which Prof. Mach has kindly 
forwarded to me, and what I wish to point out is that in each of these 
photographs — and this is perhaps the most interesting feature which 
any of these exhibit — there are seen, besides the bullet and the wires 
which the bullet strikes m its Journey, certain curious shades, one in 
advance of the bullet and one from the tail, while a trail is left behind 
very like that seen in the wake of a screw steamer. In fact, the whole 
atmospheric x>hen()nienon accompanying the bullet is not unlike that 
seen on the surface of water surrounding and behind a steamship. 
These were seen for the first time, and their visibility by this method 
was (I believe) predicted by Prof. Mach before he made his first experi- 
ment. 

The part that I have played in this matter is after all very subor- 
dinate. I have attempted to simplify the means, and the results which 
may be obtained by the modified method which I have devised, are, 1 
believe, in some respects — I don't say in all — clearer and more instruct- 
ive than those obtained by the more elaborate device of Prof. Mach. 

PI. II, fig. G, is a diagram of the apparatus that I have used. C is 

* These sparks were made to go off at the time that the mimr was facing toward 
the photographic plate by the employment of the same device as that described 
below in connection with fig. 4. On the axle of the mirror an insulated tail of 
alnmininm was secured, so as nearly to bridge a gap in the discharge circuit of au 
auxiliary jar of small capacity, there being a gap common to both circuits. A self- 
induction coil was used instead of the wet string, as being for this purpose prefer- 
able. The length of time that the spark lasted was thus measured without taking 
the electricity round by the mirror, which would have been quite sufificient to modify 
the duration of the discharge, and it was easier than making and adjusting a second 
reflecting mirror, which would have answered the same purpose.

a plate of window glass with a square foot of tiu foil on either side. 
This condenser is charged until its potential is not sufficient to make a 
spark at each of the gaps E, and E', though it would, if either of these 
were made to conduct, immediately cause a spark to form at the other. 
c is a Leyden jar of very small capacity connected with C by wire, as 
shown by the cor.tinuous lines, and by string- wetted with a solution of 
chloride of calcium, as shown by the dotted line. So long as the gap 
at B is open this little condenser, which is kept at the same potential 
as the large condenser by means of the wire and wet string, is similarly 
unable to make sparks both at B and E', but it could, if B were closed, 
at once discharge at E'. Now, suppose the bullet to join the wires at B, 
a minute spark is made at B and at E' by the discharge of c, immediately 
C, tinding one of its gaps E' in a conducting .state, discharges at E, 
making a brilliant spark, which casts a shadow of the bullet, etc., ujion 
the photographic ]»late P. Though this is simple enough, the ends 
that are gained by this contrivance are not so obvious. In the tirst 
place the discharge circuit of C, via E and E' is made of very short 
broad bands of copper, a form which favors both the brilliancy and the 
shortness of duration of the sparks; further, the doul)le gaj), of which 
E' may be the longer, causes the intensity of the light of either spark to 
be greater than it would be if the other one did not exist — in a particular 
case the light of the shorter was increased six or eightfold — at the same 
time the duration is not greatly affected. For this reason the spark 
at E may be made very short, so that the shadow is almost as sharp 
as if the light came from a point. The spark formed at B, which is 
due to the discharge of c only, is very feeble, so that it is unable to act 
on the plate, whereas, had the discharge of C been carried round by B, 
tlie light at this ])()int would hopelessly have spoilt the plate, and at 
tlie same time the liglit at E would have been feebler and would have 
lasted longer. 

The wet string, while it is for the purpose of keeping the condenser 
c charged a perfect conductor, is nevertheless, when this discharges at 
E' and B, practically a perfect insulator; if it were replaced by wire, 
then C would also wholly or partially discharge itself by B and E'. 
Finally, in avoiding all lenses one is Iree from the considerable absorp- 
tion of the more refrangible rays which sparks provide in great abun- 
dance, and which are largely absorbed by glass. On the other hand, the 
])hotograj»h is a mere shadow; but this is no drawback, for the bullet 
itself is on either system a mere silhouette, whereas the atmospheric 
phenomena are more sharply defined and their character is more clearly 
indicated without lenses than is possible when they are employed.

sages in the Royal College of Science, in which the experiments M'ere 
made. It is apparently of the rudest possible construction. The rifle

poiuts,* in Older that its position every time it is fired may be the same. 
The bnllet then traverses precisely the same course, so that wires 
placed in the line between holes in two cards made by one shot will be 
hit by the next. The two wires which the bullet joins as it passes by 
are set uj) in the box seen in the middle of the figure with the lid 
propped up so as to show the interior. The photographic plate is on 
the left-hand side, and the spark when made is just within the rectan- 
gular prolongation on the right-hand side. Paper tubes with paper 
ends are placed on each side of the box to allow the bullet to enter and 
leave, and yet not permit any daylight to fall tlirectly on the plate. 
AH is bhick inside, and so the small amount of light which does enter 
the box through these holes is not diffused in any harmful manner. 
The large box at the back is a case 5 feet long, filled with bran, which 
stops the l)ullets gently without marking them. 

The little condenser is just below the rectangular i»rolongation of 
the i)hotogiaphic box, the large condenser is the vertical square sheet 
seen just to the right. The electrical machine used to charge the con- 
densers is seen on the table. It is a very beautiful lli-plate Wimshurst 
machine, made by Mr. Wirashurst and presented to the Physical Labo- 
rator3^ This machine not only works with certainty but is so regular 
in its working that no electrometric ap))aratns is necessary. All that 
has to be done is to count the number of turns of the handle which 
are required to produce the sparks at E and E' when the gap at li is 
not joined, and to count the. number which are sufficient to pioduce a 
spark at E when the gap at B is suddenly closed. Then if the rifie is 
fired after any number of turns between these, but by preference 
nearer the larger than the smaller number, the potential will be right, 
the spark E, inside the box, and the spark E' which is in sight outside 
the box, will be let oft", and if a plate is exposed a photograph will be 
taken. If by chance the E' spark is not seen then there is no occasion 
to waste the plate; another bullet may be fired after resetting the 
wires mid the result will be as good as if one shot had not failed. 
When all is in order a failure of this kind is very rare. I alsoarianged 
a tube in the side of the box with a pocket telescope fixed in it and 
focused on the wires. If a piece of white card or paj)er is placed in 
the line of vision and so as to l)e illuminated by a spark let off as 
above described, but preferably much nearer the card, the bullet will 
be seen by anyone looking through the telescope, I took this down 
however at once, as the photograph showed more than could ever be

seen by the eye. The box seen just to the right of the ritle with a coil 
of wire upon it is the one in wlueh the revolving mirror was fixed, and 
in which the trails of sparks made near the door at the end of the 
passage were photographed. The apparatus for photographing the 
bullets was put together and set up by Mr. Barton, a student, whose 
very skillful help in the matter and afterwards during the experiments 
I found of very great value. 

The first photograph which I am able to shov\^ was taken at Christmas, 
before the apparatus just described was put together. It was taken to 
see if the idea would practically succeed, merely using for the purpose 
bits of wire and other things to be found in any laboratory, which were 
set up in a dark room in less than au hour. The first shot was suc- 
cessful, but the sharpness of the photograph is not what it might be, 
owing to the fact that I used, for the sake of the brilliant light, a spark 
taken between magnesium terminals. However, the bullet is clearly 
enough defined, as are the wires which it has just struck. This is a 
photograjih of a pistol ballet traveling only 750 feet a second. You 
will notice that unlike that taken by Prof. Mach, which represented a 
shot going at a much higher speed, this photograph shows no atmos- 
pheric phenomena surrounding" the bullet. I would only add, in con- 
nection with this photograph, that by some accident the wad remained 
attached to the bullet in this case forming the enlarged tail. I do not 
know if this often happens; it must, if it does, seriously disturb the 
flight of the projectile, and introduce an anomaly that might not easily 
be accounted for. 

The next photograph, PL iv, fig. 1, shows a bullet which has just 
left a Martini-Henry rifie. This is taken with the apparatus in its latest 
form, and the bullet appears perfectly sharp. There is no sign of any 
movement whatever in so far as the bullet itself is concerned. But 
now that we are dealing with a higher speed, namely, 1,295 feet a sec- 
ond, there is evidence of the movement of the bullet in the form of a 
wave of compressed air in front and of other waves at the side of and 
behind the bullet. I shall explain this in a moment, but I would rather 
first show another photograph, PI. iv, tig. 2, of a bullet travelling at a 
still higher speed, a inagazine-rifle bullet travelling about 2,000 feet a 
second, in which these air waves are still more conspicuous, and in 
which a glance is sufficient to make it evident that the waves are much 
more inclined to the vertical than in the previous case. 

Now, as it may not be evident why these waves of air are formed, 
why their inclination varies with the speed, or why existing- they are vis- 
ible at all, a short explanation may not be out of place, more especially 
as they form a most interesting feature in the remaining photographs 
that I have to exhibit, which can not, as a matter of fact, be properly 
interpreted without frequent reference to them. 

I would first ask you to examine some still water into which a needle 
lield vertically is allowed to dip. If you move the ueeuie very slowly 



174 ELECTRIC-SPARK PHOTOGRAPHS. 

not a ripple is formed on tlie surface of the water ; but as the needle is 
moved more quickly at first a speed is reached at which feeble waves 
appear, and then as the speed increases a sw^allow-tail pattern apiiears; 
the angle between tlie two tails become less as the velocity gets higher. 
Now, in the case of water waves the velocity with which they travel 
depends on the distance between one and the next, and, for a reason 
into which I must not now enter, either very loug or very short waves 
travel more quickly than waves of moderate dimensions. If they are 
about two-thirds of an iuch loug they travel most slowly — about 9 inches 
a second. Now, so long as the needle is travelling less quickly than this, 
no disturbance is made; but w^heu this speed is exceeded the swallow- 
tail appears. Suppose, for exami^le, the velocity of the needle to be 
double the minimum wave velocity for water, i. e., let the needle move 
at 18 inches a second, and let it at any moment have arrived at the point 
p, PI. V, fig. 1,~ then any disturbance, started when it was at the 
point A, must have travelled as far as the circle a((a in which Aa is half 
A^), similarly for iiiiy number of points BC, etc., between A and_2> any 
disturbance must have travelled as far as the corresponding circles bb, 
cc, etc., the result is that along a pair of lines, ^>L,pM, touching all the 
circles tliat could be drawn in this way, a wave will be found, and it is 
clear that as the velocity of the point is made greater the successive 
radii A^f Bb, etc., will become in proportion to Ap less, the circles will 
be smaller, and the angle between Lj? and Mp will become less, while 
when the velocity is made less the reverse happens, until at last Aa 
Bb, etc., = A^ Bp, etc., and then when they exceed these quantities no 
lines hp Mp can be drawn touching all these circles, there is no wave 
surface which the disturbances from all the successive points can con- 
spire to produce, and the consequence is there is still water. 

Now consider the case of a bullet moving through the air. Here 
again we are dealing with a case in which a wave can not travel at less 
than a certain speed which is obviously the velocity of sound (1,100 
feet a second, under ordinary circumstances), but as in the case of sur- 
face waves on water, higher speeds are possible when the wave is oue 
of very great intensity. The conditions in tlie two cases are therefore 
very nearly i^arallel; if the bullet is travelling at less than the mini- 
mum speed no waves should be formed ; the pistol bullet at 750 feet a 
second did not show any; if the bullet is travelling at higher speeds 
than 1,100 feet a second waves should be formed which should include 
a sharper angle as the speed is made to increase. Tliis was found to be 
so in the case of the Martini-Henry and the magazine-rifle bullet. 

The curved form of the wave near the apex is due to the fact that 
when it is very intense, when the compression is very great, the veloc- 
ity of travel is greater and, immediately in front of the bullet, the air 
is compressed to so great an extent that the wave at this part can 
travel at the speed of the bullet itself. 

The reason why the waves should be visible at all is not difiicult to

follow. Consider a shell of compressed air through which rays of light 
from a point are made to traverse. These rays travel in straight lines, 
except where they meet a medium of different density, and the denser 
this is and the more nearly they meet this at a grazing incidence the 
more tliey will be bent toward the perpendicular. In comparison with 
water or glass a layer of compressed air has very little refractive power, 
and so rays which strike the shell anywhere except at the extreme edge 
are practically nninfluenced in their course and strike the plate prac- 
tically in the same place that they would do if the shell of compressed air 
had not been traversed. But those rays ab, ah, Fl. v, fig. 2, which strike 
the shell of air almost tangentially, are bent inwards slightly at h and 
again at c, having traversed what is equivalent to a wide angle prism, 
and strike the plate at e, leaving the place d, where they would have 
gone had they not been refracted, dark ; moreover, at e they meet other 
rays which have been hardly at all refracted since they have passed 
actually into the shell and out again, and therefore e is doubly illumi- 
nated. The consequence is that a wave or shell of comi)ressed air gives 
rise to an image on the plate, iu which there is a dark line and a light 
line within it. Similarly a wave of rarefaction must produce a light 
line with a dark one within it.* 

An examination of the photograph (PI. iv, fig. 2) will make it evident 
that not only is the head wave a wave of compression, but the wave 
which starts from the end of a kind of vena contracta behind the bullet 
is also a wave of compression. It is a curious fact which requires ex- 
planation that the head and tail waves are not parallel to one another, 
and they do not show any sign that they would become parallel if they 
were continued indefinitely. This can only be due to either the tail of 
the bullet travelling considerably faster than the head, or to the actual 
velocity of propagation of the tail wave being less than that of the head 
wave The effect observed is true and is not optical, being neither due 
to the refractive effect of the outer shell disturbing rays which are 
tangential to the inner shell, nor to an effect of perspective, for though 
the projection of a cone from a point upon a plane is only seen of the 
l^roper angle when the perpendicular, dropped from the point upon 
the plane, passes through the vertex of the cone, yet when, as iu the 
case of PI. VII, where it passes within both cones, and more within the 
outer one than the inner one, the effect is to make the projections of 
both of a greater obtuseness, and of the outer one to a greater extent 
than tlie inner one; nevertheless an examination of the amount of this 
effect of perspective made by Mr. Barton showed that the distortion 



* It may be worth while to point out that the dark and light lines are — aud onsht 
to be — parallel to one another as soon as they are so far away from the shadow of 
the bullet as to be practically straight lines. For if the thickness of the shell is 
divided up into a series of elements, the ray passing through any one of these will 
meet with a refractive medium which is less effective, as the diameter of the part of 
the shell considered is greater, while the refractive angles of the elementary prisms 
become inclined more, so as to compensate for the diminished density

was not sufficient to be noticeable, astbediflterence in the acuteness of 
the cones certainly is. 

Going back now to the photographs, the next one was taken with 
the view of illustrating the eftect on the inclination of the waves of 
the velocity of the bullet. In this case the bullet was aluminum; it 
was only one-seventh the weight of the regulation bullet. In conse- 
quence of its lightness it travelled about half as fast again as the ordi- 
nary bullet (not V- times as fast as it would have done if the pressure 
of the powder gases had been the same in the two cases), and in con- 
sequence of the higher speed the inclination of the waves is still greater 
than in the previous case. Further, in this case the bullet was made 
to pierce a piece of card shortly before it was photographed. The lit- 
tle pieces that were cut out were driven forward at a high speed, but, 
being lighter than the bullet, they soon lost a large part of their veloc- 
ity; they had in consequence lagged behind when they were photo- 
graphed, but though travelling more slowly (they were still going at 
more than 1,100 feet a second) they yet made each its own air wave, 
which became less and less inclined as the bits lagged more and more 
behind; each, moreover, produced its own trail of vortices like that 
following the bullet. The well-known fact that moving things tend to 
take the position of greatest resistance, to avoid the effect of which 
the bullet has to be made to spin, is also illustrated in the i^liotograph. 
The little pieces that are large enough to be clearly seen are moving 
broadside on, and not edgeways, as might be expected. 

In order to illustrate the other fact that the angle of the waves also 
depends on the velocity of sound in the gas, I filled the box with a 
mixture of carbonic-acid gas, and the vapor of ether, a mixture which 
is very dense, and through which sound in consequence travels only 
about half as fast as it does in air, and which will not explode or even 
catch fire when an electric spark is made within it, or directly act inju- 
riously upon the photographic plate. The increased inclination of the 
waves is very evident in Plate vi. 

These waves, revealed by photography, have a very important eftect 
on the flight of projectiles. Just as in the case of waves produced by 
the motion ot a ship, which, as is well known, become enormously more 
energetic as the velocity increases, and which at high velocities pro- 
duce as a matter of fact an effect of resistance to the motion of the ship 
of far greater importance than the skin friction, so in the case of the 
air waves produced by bullets; in its flight the resistance which 
the bullet meets with increases very rajiidly when the velocity is 
raised beyond the point at which these waves begin to be formed. 
This being the case, I have thought it might be interesting to see 
whether the analogy between the behavior of the two classes of waves 
might be even nearer than has already appeared, and on turning to the 
beautiful researches of Mr. Scott Russell, published in the report of the 
British Associatiou for the year 1844, in which he gives a very full

report ou the water waves and their properties, I found that he had 
made experiments and had j^iven a diagram showing- what happens 
when a solitary wave meets a vertical wall. The wave, as wonld be 
expected, is, under ordinary conditions, reflected perfectly, making an 
angle of reflection equal to the angle of incidence, and the reflected and 
incident waves are alike in all respects. This continues to be the case 
as the angle gets more and more nearly equal to the right angle, *. e., 
until the wave front, nearly perpendicular to the wall, runs along nearly 
parallel to it. It then at last ceases to be reflected at all. The part of 
the wave Jiear the wall instead gathers strength, it gets higher, it there- 
fore travels faster, and so causes the wave near the wall to run ahead 
of its proper position, producing a bend in the wave front, and this 
goes on until at last the wave near the wall becomes a breaker. 

In order to see if anything similar happens in the case of air waves, 
I arranged the three reflecting surfaces of sheet copper seen in Plate 
VII, and photographed a magazine-rifle bullet when it had got to 
the position seen. Below the bullet two waves strike the reflector at a 
low angle, and they are perfectly reflected, the dark and the light lines 
changing places as they obviously ought to do. The left side of the V- 
shaped reflector was met at a nearly grazing incidence; there there is 
no reflection, but, as is clear on the photograph, the wave near the 
reflector is of greater intensity, it has bent itself ahead of its proper 
position as the water wave was found to do, but it can not form a 
breaker, as there is no such thing in an air wave. The same photo- 
graph shows two other phenomena which are of interest. The stern 
wave has a piece cut out of it by the lower reflector, and bent up at 
the same angle. Now if a wave was a mere advancing thing the end 
of the bent-up piece would leave off snddenly, and the break in the 
direct wave would do the same. But according to the view of wave 
propagation put forward by Iluygens, the wave at any epoch is the 
resultant of all the disturbances which may be considered to have 
started from all points of the wave front at any preceding epoch. 
The reflector, where it has cut this wave, may be considered as a series 
of points of disturbance arranged continuously in a line, each how- 
ever coming into operation just after the neighbor on one side and 
just before the neighbor on the other. The reflected wave is the enve- 
lope of a series of spheres beginning with a point at the place where 
the wave and the reflector cut, growing up to a finite sphere about the 
end of the reflector as a center; beyond this there are no more centers 
of disturbance, the envelope of all the spheres projected upon the 
plate, that is, the photograi)h of the reflected wave, is not therefore a 
straight line leaving off abruptly, but it curls round, as is very clearly 
shown, dying gradually away to nothing. The same is the case, but it 
is less marked, at the end of the direct wave near the part that has 
been cut out.

Tlie otlier point to wbicli I ^*oakl refer is the dark line between the 
nose of tUe bullet and tlie wire placed to receive it. This is the feeble 
spark duo to the discharge of the small condenser which clearly must 
have been on the point of going off of its own accord. The feeble spark 
precedes — or is to all intents and purposes simultaneous with, it cannot 
follow — the main spark which makes the photograph. The feeble si)ark 
heated the air, and the light from the main spark coming through this 
line of heated air was dispersed, leaving a clear black shadow on the 
plate. One spark casts a shadow of the other. Now it is evident that 
if the spark at the nose of the bullet had followed instead of having 
preceded the main spark by even so much as athree-huudred-millionth 
of a second, the time that light took to travel from one to the other, 
it would not have been able to cast a shadow. We have the means of 
telling, therefore, which of two sparks actually took place first, or per- 
haps the order of several, even though the difference of time is so 
minute. Perhaps this method might be of some use in researches now 
attracting so much interest in connection with the propagation of elec- 
trical waves. 

On returning to the non-reflection of the air wave in the upper part 
of the figure, we have here, 1 imagine, optical evidence of what goes on 
in a whispering gallery. The sound is i^robably not reflected at all, 
but runs round almost on the surface of the wall from one part to 
another. 

We are now in a position to see how the reflection or nou-reflectiou 
of air waves produced by a passing bullet, when they meet with some 
solid body, may i)roduce a i)ractical result which might be of impor- 
tance in some cases. Suppose a bullet to be i^assing near and parallel 
to a wall. Then if the velocity of the bullet and its distance from the 
wall are such that the head wave meets the wall at an angle at which 
it can be reflected, especially, as in the case of Plate vii, if the 
reflected ray can only return into the path of the bullet after it has 
gone, then no influence whatever can be exerted upon the bullet by its 
proximity to the wall. If however the head wave would if nndisturbed 
meet the wall at such an angle that it could not be reflected, as for 
instance in Plate viii, when the head wave can be reflected by 
neither of the walls between which the bullet is passing, obviously the 
wave will become stronger and the resistance which it ofters will, I 
imagine, become greater, and if in this case the upper ])late be removed 
this extra resistance will be one sided and must tend to deflect the 
bullet. This is quite distinct from the well-known eft'ect of a bayonet 
upon tlie path of a bullet; when a bayonet is fixed the rush of powder 
gases between the bullet and the bayonet is quite sufficient to account 
for the deflection which every practiced marksman all(jws for. 

I have devised a method by which a problem of some difficulty, about 
which authorities are, I believe, by no means in accord, may be solved 
with a fair degree of certainty. The problem is this, to find what pro-

portion of the velocity of a bullet is given to it after it has left the bar- 
rel, or, what comes to the same thing', to find the position in front of 
the barrel at which the speed is a maximum. The cause of this is evi- 
dent. When the bullet has left the muzzle the imprisoned powder 
gases, under enormous i^ressure, rush out, making a draft past the 
bullet of the most tremendous intensity tending obviously to drive it 
forward. While this draught does most assuredly hurry the bullet on 
its forward course, it does not tend to make it spin round any faster. 
Now if the bullet were not hurried on at all after it left the muzzle it 
would, travelling as in a screw of the same pitch all the way from the 
breech of the litle uj) to the point at which it is photographed, have 
turned round a certain number of times, which depend upon the dis- 
tance traveled and the pitch of the screw. If however the longitudi- 
nal motion is hurried and the rotational is left unaltered the pitch will 
be lengthened outside the barrel and the rotation will have been less 
for any position than it would have been if the bullet had not been 
accelerated in this way. If therefoie we can find to what extent the bul- 
let has turned actually at the place at which it has been photographed, 
we can find the apparent rotational lag, and so working backwards 
get a measure of the velocity acquired after leaving the muzzle. In 
order to accomplish this I drilled a series of holes transversely through 
the bullet, each one at an angle to the previous one, the whole series 
being such that to whatever extent the bullet had twisted, one at least, 
and perhaps two, Avould allow the light of the spark to shine through 
it upon the photographic plate. Then from the photograi)h it is easy 
to see through which hole the light shone, and knowing in what 
position this was in the breech, it is easy to find what fraction of half 
a turn over or above any whole number of half turns the bullet has 
twisted. Strictly the measure should be made at different distances 
to eliminate all uncertainty, but the only shot I have taken was sulfi- 
cient to show that there was a rotational lag equivalent, according to 
the measure made l)y Mr. Barton, to something under a two per cent 
acceleration outsule the barrel. I do not attachany importance to this 
figure; the experiment was made with a view to see if the method was 
practicable and this it certainly is. I would recommend, where ac- 
curacy is required, that having" found as above about how much the 
bullet has turned, that a second bullet should be drilled with a series 
of holes at about the corresponding position differing very slightly from 
one another in angular position, so that several w^ould let the light 
through and thus give a more accurate measure of the rotation. 

There is a point of interest to sportsmen which has given rise to a 
controversy which the spark photograi)hs supply the means of settling. 
The action of the choke bore has been disputed, some having held that 
the shot are made to travel more compactly altogether, while others, 
while they admit that the shot are less scattered laterally, as may be 
proved by firing at a target, assert that they are spread out longitudi- 
nally, so that if this is the case the improved target i)attern is no cri-

teiioii of harder liittiug, especially in the case of a^ bird flying rapidly 
across the direction of aim. 

I was unfortunately not able, in the limited space and time that I 
have been able to employ, to take photographs of the shot at a i-easou 
able distance from the gnu, but I have taken comparative photographs 
at three or four yards ouly in which every shot is clearly defined, and 
in which it is even easy to see on the negative where the shot have 
been jammed into one another and dented. The difference in the scat- 
tering at this short distance is not sufticient for the results to give any 
information beyond this, that shot are as easily photographed as bullets, 
and that no difficulty need be apprehended in attempting to solve 
any question of the kind by this method. The j)hotograph, Plate ix, 
represents the shot from the cylindrical or right-hand barrel. The 
velocity now is so low that individnal waves are no longer formed by 
each shot. The whole space however occupied by the shot is tilled 
with air waves of the greatest complexity. They are not due to the 
cause already explained, but are, I believe, formed by the imperfect 
mixture of air with powder gases still accompanying the shot. The 
imi^erfect mixture of the two gases causes light to be deflected in its 
passage, thus producing strite, just as at the first mixing of whisky 
and water striie are seen (sometimes attributed to oil!), which disap- 
l^ear when the mixture is com[)lete. I would mention, for the benefit 
of any one who nmy be tempted to continue these experiments, that a 
pair of wires (such as are found to do so well when bullets have to be 
caught) are not suitable, as one is sure to be shot away before such a 
bridge of shot is made between them as will allow a si)ark to pass. 
However, by using thick copi)er wires, one bent in the form of a screw, 
with the other along the axis, no such failure can occur, and every shot 
that I have taken in this way has been successful. One can of course 
test the action of any material mixed with the shot. For instance, in 
one case I mixed a few drops of li(piid oil with the shot and found them 
more widely scattered in consequence, not, as has been stated, held 
together by the oil as if they were in a wire cartridge. Of course, solid 
grease or fat may, and no doubt does, produce such a result, but liquid 
oil certainly does not. 

And now 1 wish to conclude with a series of photographs which show 
how conq)letely the method is under control, how information of a kind 
that might seem to be outside the reach of experiment may be obtained 
from the electric-spark photograph, and how phenomena of an unex- 
pected nature are liable to appear when making any new experiment. 
The result however is otherwi.se of but little interest or importance. 

I thought I should like to watch the process of the piercing of a glass 
plate by a bullet from the first shock step by step, until the bullet 
had at last emerged from the confnsion it had created. ■ In Plate x,

four or five times as rapid as tlie motion of tlie Imllet forwards. A 
new air wave is just beginning' to be created in front of the glass-coated 
liead of tlie bullet and two highly inclined waves, one on either side of 
the glass, reaching about three-quarters of the way to the edge, have 
sprung into existence. These are more clearly seen in the next figure; 
meanwhile it may be well to point out that the fragments of paper 
wliich are following the bullets have in this case — as the card was 
much nearer to the glass plate than in those previously taken — some 
of them lost so much of their velocity and have in consequence lagged 
behind in a still higher proportion than the others, that they are trav- 
elling at less than 1,100 feet a second; the more backward ones carry 
in consequence no air waves and there is no means of telling from the 
photograph that they are moving at all. In PI. xii, fig. 1, the bullet 
has struggled about half way through the plate. The waves on either 
side of the plate have now reached the edge and are on their way back 
towards the center again. They are caused in this way: When the 
bullet strikes the plate the violent shock produces a ripple or tremor 
in the glass which travels away radially in all directions, leaving the 
glass quiet behind. The rate at which this ripple travels maybe found 
from the angle which these new air waves make with the plate, for 
taking any point on the plate and measuring up to the pcnjit where the 
air wave meets the plate and also the distance in air to the nearest 
point of the inclined air wave, we get two distances, the ratio of which 
'is the ratio of the velocity of the disturbance in the glass to the veloc- 
ity of sound in air. But much more tlian this is shown. An examina- 
tion of the negatives or of a photographic print and even, but less 
clearly, of the print in the text shows that these inclined air waves are 
made up of a series of dark and light lines at a very slight iuclinatioii 
to the air wave itself, so that as we travel along the air wave it is 
alternately daik outside, and light outside. 

These indicate the successive positions in which the glass first moved 
outwards to compress the air or first moved inwards to rarefy it so that 
the wave length of the ripple nmy thus l)e found, and finally it is seen 
that where the waves are waves of compression on one side of the plate 
they are waves to rarefaction on the other, indicating that it was a 
transverse and not a mere longitudinal disturbance that ran along the 
plate from the center outwards and back again after reflection from the 
edge. In addition to this fact that the reflected wave is still on its in- 
ward course proves that up to this time the plate is whole, as a wave 
can not be propagated in a broken plate. Plate xi, illustrates the 
state of affairs when the bullet has traveled about 5 inches beyond the 
plate. It has not yet emerged from the cloud of glass dust. The new 
head wave is very conspicuous. In the original negative, about half- 
way between the bullet and the plate, the inclined waves due to the 
tremor in the glass plate may be detected, but tliey are too delicate to 
be re-produced by the printing process. They supply the information as

to liow long" the plate remained whole or rather if the bullet had been 
caught a little sooner before these faint waves had lost so much of their 
distinctness they would supply this information with great exactness. 
jNIeanwhile the figure shows that the i)late is now broken up completely. 
It is true it is still standing, and th(^, stern air wave is seen reflected 
from the upper part of it, but this is because the different parts have 
not 3'et had time to get away; their grinding edges however have cast 
out from the surface little particles, and these are seen over the whole 
extent of the plate. After about 15 inches the bullet is quite clear of 
the cloud of dust (PI. xii, fig. 2); one piece only of the glass, no doul)t 
the piece that was immediately struck, has been punched out and is 
travelling- along above the bullet at a speed practically equal to its own. 
1 am also able to show the plate itself in this and a still later stage, 
when at last the separate pieces have begun to be visibly moved out of 
their position and in some cases slightly turned round. 

I have merely given this evening an account of a few experiments 
which in themselves perhaps are of little interest, but they at any rate 
show the capability of this method for the examination of subjects 
which would in the ordinary way be considered beyond the reach of 
experiment. It is hardly necessary to say that the examples given by 
no means reach the limit of what may be done. I have examined the 
explosions produced by 15-grain fulminate of mercury detonators 
and of heaps of iodide of nitrogen, a material which is rather unman- 
ageable, as if a fly even walks over it it violently explodes. In these 
cases the exph>sive flash was used to make the B gap of PI. ii, fig. 5 con- 
ducting, for which it answered perfectly. One might in the same way 
examine the form of the out-rush of powder gases past the bullet, and 
so find at once their velocity with respect to the velocity of the bullet, 
and I see no great difficulty in tracing, if this should be desired, the 
wliole course of a single bullet for perhaps as much as 100 yards by 
means of photogra])hs taken every few inches on its way. Though it 
may not be evident that these or similar experiments are of any practi- 
cal importance, there can be no doubt that information may be readily 
obtained by the aid of the spark photogra])h, as in fact has been shown 
by Prof. ]Mach, Lord Kayleigh, Mr. F. J. Smith, and others, which with- 
out its aid can only be surmised, and that if, as in other subjects, the 
first wish of the experimentalist is to see what he is doing, then in these 
cases surely, where in general people would not think of attempting to 
look with their natural eyes, it may be worth while to take advantage 
of this electro-photographic eye.

MAGNETIC PROPETiTIES OF LIQUID OXYGEN.* 



By Prof. James Dewar, F. K. S. 



After alludinii' to the generous aid vvliieh lie had received both from 
the Eoyal Institution and from others in connection with his researches 
on tlie properties of liquid oxygen, and to the untiring assistance ren- 
dered him by his co-workers in the laboratory, Prof. Dewar said that on 
the occasion of tlie commemoration of the centenary of tlie birth of 
Michael Faraday he had demonstrated some of the properties of liqnid 
oxygen. He hoped that evening to go several steps further, and to show 
liquid air, and to render visible some of its more extraordinary prop- 
erties. 

The apparatus employed consisted of the gas-engine down stairs, 
which was driving two compressors. The chamber containing the oxy- 
gen to be li(iuefied was surrounded by two circuits, one traversed by 
etiiylene, the other by nitrous oxide. Some liquid ethylene was admitted 
to the chamber belonging to its circuit, and there evaporated. It was 
then returned to the compressor as gas and liquefied, and thence again 
into tlie compressor as required. A similar cycle of operations was 
carried out with the nitrous oxide. There Avas a hundredweight of 
licjuid ethylene prepared for the experiment. Ethylene was obtained 
from alcohol by the action of strong sulphuric acid. Its manufacture 
was exceedingly difficult, because dangerous, and as the efficiency of 
the process only amounted to 15 or 20 i)er cent the ]ireparation of a 
hundredweight of liquid was no light task. The cycle of operations, 
which, for want of time, was not fully explained, was the same as that 
commonly employed in refrigerating machinery working with ether or 
ammonia. 

The lecturer then exhibited to the audience a pint of liquid oxygen, 
which by its cloudy appearance showed that it contained traces of 
impurity. The oxygen was filtered, and then ai)peared as a clear trans- 
parent liquid with a slightly blue tinge. The density of oxygen gas at 
—182° C. is normal, and the latent heat of volatilization of the liquid is 
about 80 units. The capillarity of liquid oxygen at its boiling-point was

about oiie-sixtli that of water. The temperature of liquid oxygen at 
atmospheric pressure, determined by tlie specific heat method, using 
platinum and silver, was —180° C. 

Eeferonce was then n^ade to a remarkable exf)erimental corroboration 
of the correctness for exceedingly low temperatures of Lord Kelvin and 
Prof. Tait's thermoelectric diagram. If the lines of copper and i)lati- 
num were prolonged in the direction of negative temperature, tliey 
would intersect at — 95o C. Similarly, the copper and palladium lines 
would cut one another at —170° C. Now, if this diagrm were correct, 
the E. M. F. of the thermo-electric junctions of these two pairs of metals 
should reverse at these points. A Cu — Pt junction connected to a 
reflecting galvanometer was then placed in oxygen vapor and cooled 
down. At —100° C. the spot of light sto])ped and reversed. A Cu — Pd 
junction was afterwards placed in a tube containing liquid oxygen, and 
a similar reversal took place at about —170° 0. 

Liquid oxygen is a non-conductor of electricity; a spark taken from 
an induction coil, one millimeter lojig in the liquid, requires a potential 
equal to a striking distance in air of 25 millimeters. It gave a flash 
now and then, when a bubble of the oxygen vapor in the boiling liquid 
came between the terminals. Thus liquid oxygen is a high insulator. 
When the spark is taken from a Wimsliurst machine the oxygen appears 
to allow the passage of a discharge to take place with much greater 
ease. The spectrum of the spark taken in the liquid is a continuous 
one, showing all the absorption bands. 

As to its absorption spectrum, the lines A and B of the solar spectrum 
are due to oxj^gen, and they came out strongly when the liquid was 
interposed in the path of the rays from tlie electric lamp. Both the 
liquid and the highly compressed gas show a series of five absorption 
bands, situated resi)ectively in the orange, yellow, green, and blue of 
the spectrum. 

Experiments prove that gaseous and liquid oxygen have substantially 
the same absori^tion spectra. This is a very noteworthy conclusion, 
considering that no compound of oxygen, so far as is known, gives the 
absorptions of oxygen. The persistency of the absorption through the 
stages of gaseous condensation towards complete liquidity implies a 
persistency of molecular constitution which we should hardly have 
expected. The absorptions of the class to which A and B belong must 
be those most easily assumed by the diatomic molecules (Go) of ordinary 
oxygen; whereas the diffuse bands above referred to, seeing they have 
intensities proportioned to the square of the density of the gas, must 
depend on a change produced by compression. This may be brought 
about in two ways, either by the formation of more complex molecules, 
or by the constraint to which the molecules are subjected during their 
encounters with one another.

of a high expansion pump and an open test-tube is inserted into it, the

Dr. Janssen had recently been making prolonged and careful experi- 
ments on Mont Blanc, and he found that these oxygen lines disappeared 
more and more from the solar spectrum as he reached higher altitudes. 
The lines at all elevations come out more strongly when the sun is low, 
because the rays tlien have to traverse greater thicknesses of the earth's 
atmosphere,

netism on gases opened up a new field of investigation. The following-

Becquerel was before Faraday in experimenting nj)on this subject. 
Becipierel allowed charcoal to absorb gases, and tlien examined the

the magnetic properties of oxygen to be strong, even in relation to a

The lecturer took a cu]) made of rock salt and put in it some liquid 
oxygen. The liquid did not wet rock salt, but remained in a spheroidal 
state. The cup and its contents were placed between and a little below 
the poles of an electro magnet. Whenever the circuit was completed 
the liquid oxygen rose from the cup and connected the two poles, as 
represented in the cut, which is copied from a photograph of the phe- 
nomenon. Then it boiled away, sometimes more on one pole than the 
other, and when the circuit was broken it fell off the pole in drops 
back into the cup. He also showed that the magnet would draw up 
liquid oxygen out of a tube. A test-tube containing liquid-oxygen, 



186

wlieii placed in the Hnglies balance, produced no disturbing effect. 
The magnetic moment of liquid oxygen is about 1,000 when the mag- 
netic moment of iron is taken as 1,000,000. On cooling, some bodies 
increased in magnetic power. Cotton wool, moistened with liquid 
oxygen, was strongly attracted by the magnet, and the liquid oxygen 
was actually sucked out of it on to the poles. A crystal of ferrous 
sulphate, similarly cooled, stuck to one of the poles. 

The lecturer remarked that fluorine is so much like oxygen in its 
properties that he ventured to predict that it will turn out to be a mag- 
netic gas. 

Nitrogen liquefies at a lower temperature than oxygen, and one 
would expect the oxygen to come down before the nitrogen when air 
is liquefied, as stated in some text-books, but unfortunately it is not 
true. They liquefy together. In evaporating however, the nitrogen 
boils off before the oxygen. He poured two or three ounces of liquid 
air into a large test tube, and a smouldering splinter of wood dipped 
into the mouth of the tube was not re-ignited; the bulk of the nitrogen 
was nearly five minutes in boiling off, after which a smouldering si)linter 
dipped into the mouth of the test tube burst into flame. 




Magnetic properties of liquid oxygen. 

Between the poles of the magnet all the liquefied air went to the 
poles; there was no separation of the oxygen and nitrogen. Liquid 
air has the same high insulating power as liquid oxygen. The phe- 
nomena j)resented by liquefied gases present an unlimited field for 
investigation. At — 200° C. the molecules of oxygen had only one- 
half of their ordinary velocity, and had lost three-fourths of their 
energy. At such low temperatures they seemed to be drawing near 
what might be called "the death of matter," so far as chemical action 
was concerned; liquid oxygen, for instance, had no action upon a piece 
of phosphorus and potassium or sodium dropped into it; and once lie 
thought, and publicly stated, that at such temperatures all chemical 
action ceased. That statement required some qualification, because a 
photographic plate placed in liquid oxygen could be acted upon by

radiant euergy, and at a temperature of — 200° C, was still sensitiv^e 
to light. 

Prof. M'Kendrick liad tried the effect of these low temperatures 
upon the spores of mierobic organisms, by submitting" in sealed glass 
tubes blood, milk, flesh, and such like substances, for one hour to a 
temperature of — 182° C, and subsequently keeping them at blood 
heat for some days. The tubes on being opened were all putrid. 
Seeds also withstood the action of a similar amount of cold. 

[At a meeting of the Royal Society of London, held March 0, 1893, 
Professor Dewar made an oral statement to the effect that he had suc- 
ceeded in freezing liquiiied atmospheric air into a clear transparent 
solid. Whether this solid is a jelly of solid nitrogen containing liquid 
oxygen, or a true ice of liquid air, in which both oxygen and nitrogen 
exist in the solid form, was however stated to be a question for far- 
ther research. — rroceedings of the Royal /Societt/y 1893, vol. Liii, p. 80.1 



THE PEOBLEM OF FLYING * 



By Otto Lilienthal. 



While tlieoretically no difficulty of any considerable importance pre- 
cludes tlight, the problem can not be considered solved until the act of 
flying- has been ac(*ora])lished by niau. In its application, liowever, 
unforeseen difficulties arise of which the theorist can have no concep- 
tion. 

The first obstacle to be overcome by the practical constructor is that 
of stability. It is an old adage that '^ Wasser hatkehte Ballcen.''^ What 
then, shall be said of air? 

Leaving- out of the question propelling mechanisms which re(jnire 
more than ordinary refinements of construction, theory teaches that a 
pro])erly constructed fiying apparatus may be brought to sail in a suffi- 
ciently strong wind; while in still air, such a machine amy be made to 
glide downward upon a slightly inclined path. In the practical ap])li- 
catiou of these two methods, however, it is found that while the api)a- 
ratus is supported by moving air, it is also subjected to the whims of 
the wind, which often places it in uncomfortable positions, overturns 
it, or carries it into higher regions and then precipitates it, headfore- 
most, to the ground. Lowering- of the center of gravity is of little 
avail, nor does the most ingenious change of the wings or the steering- 
surfaces alter the case. There is still no trace of the majestic soaring 
of the bird, for the wind is a treacherous fellow, who follows his own 
inclinations and laughs at our art. Therefore let us try the second 
method, the oblique descent in still air. 

According to computation the apparatus should descend at a small 
angle, reaching the ground at a considerable distance, but this experi- 
ment is a success only in short flights. Beyond these the apparatus 
becomes unmanageable, darts vertically up, turns about, comes to a 
full stop, stands on its head, and descends with uncomfortable rapidity 
to the ground, the contact with which will probably have demolished 
the machine, if it do not turn a lucky somersault and land upon its

back. iSTor do repeated changes of the center of gravity alter the case 
beyond making it turn over backward instead of forward, leaving the 
conditions as unstable as before. Fancy the fate of the man who con- 
fides in such an apparatus. 

Shall we now give up all hopes of success or shall we try new means 
to deprive the flying machine of its vicious propen?sities? This ques- 
tion has been answered in various ways. On the one hand it is thought 
that it should be possible, by mechanical means, to produce stable 
flight automatically, and an association of engineers of repute at Augs- 
burg — an excellent proof that investigations of the art of flying have 
begun to be taken up by willing and self-sacrificing men — has among 
other tilings proposed, meclianical contrivances for the regulation of 
soaring. 




FHi. 1. 

The apparatus is meant to descend from a ca[)tive ballot m. V>y tlie 
application of ingenious methods the sailing surfaces (wings) are forced 
to retain their inclination. According to the report of Engineer JM. Von 
Siegsfeld on the subject, no system has as yet been discovered that 
would promise sufficient security to any one sailing at a considerable 
elevation. 

As desirable as it is that these investigations should dis<-over safe 
automatic devices to give stability to soaring, it remains, on the other 
hand, doubtful whether the dangers attending such flights could even 
then be obviated. I am of the opinion that the evolution of the flying 
machine will be similar to that of the bicycle, which was not made in a 
day,and that this will not be either. ^ Although in soaring the center of 
gravity may be placed below the center of pressure of the supi^orting 
air, it appears that even in this case, on account of the elasticity of the 
air itself, i)ermanent stability could only be obtained by a constant 
and arbitrary correction of the position of the center of gravity. This

is performed by birds iucessautly and it is in virtue of a perfect 
adaptation of tlie form of tlieir wiugs to any aerial motion tliat their 
flight appears to ns so sure, graceful, and beautiful. 

In the same way a man can move through the air and have the gen- 
eral ability to guide his apparatus by a constant sliiftiiig of the center 
of gravity. Descent should not be at first tried from great elevations, 
for such a feat requires practice. In the beginniug, the height should 
be moderate and the wings not too large, or the wind will soon show 
that it is not to be trifled with. In fact, under some circumstances, one 
may be swept off toward still higher regions, the descent from which 
might well be disastrous. It therefore seems best that the wings 
should not exceed from 8 to 10 sguare meters (somewhat over 80 to 100 
square feet), or that the experiment should be conducted in any wind 
blowing more than 5 meters x)er second (nearly 1,000 feet a minute), 
which represents a gentle breeze. A good run against the wind, how- 
ever, and a leap from a safe height of 2 or o meters may secure a flight 
of 15 or 20 meters. 



^t^"' 










FlQ. 2. 

Continual practice will enable the exj^erimenter to withstand a 
stronger breeze, to increase the surface of the wings to 15 square meters 
(100 square feet), and to start from a greater elevation, especially if 
there be a moderate slope beneath him with a soft, yielding surface. 
After becoming sufficiently expert to deviate from a straight line, the 
experimenter may enjoy the sensation of flying, but it is always a nec- 
essary condition that he should face the wind while descending, as the 
birds do. If then flight is attempted with the wind, it must be more 
rapid than the wind, or the result will be very apt to be a dangerous 
somersault at the time of coming to the ground, so that it is, on the 
whole, most advisable to follow the lessons of the birds, who ascend 
and descend against the wind.

THE PROBLEM OF FLYING. 



I have beeu experimeuting iu this way for tliree years, and the con- 
stant progress made in the perfection of my machine and the increased 
secnrity it gives has convinced me of the correctness of the plan. At 
all events, I think it best to perfect the soaring ai)paratns before 
attempting flight \a ith movable wings.

Fig. 3. 

After numerons -experiments from low elevations, I gradnally veu- 
tnred to increase the height, and for this pnrpose I erected a tower- 
like shed, which, while it gave me room to store my apparatus, enabled 
me to conduct my experiments from the roof. The illustrations, taken 
from instantaneous photographs, show one of my securely constructed 
machines for soaring and the various j)hases of a soaring" experiment. 

Figure 1 represents the first leap from the roof, the cut showing 
the front view of the apparatus, w^hich in some respects resembles the 
spread wings of a bat, and folds up like those for convenience of storage 
and transportation. The frame is of willow, covered with sheeting; 
the entire area contains nearly 150 square feet, and the entire aj^para- 
tus weighs about 45 pounds. The roof of the tower is rather over 30 
feet»above the surrounding level, and from this elevation, after suffi- 
cient practice, one may glide over a distance of over 50 yards at an angle 
of descent of from 10 to 15 degrees. 

Figures 2, 3, 4 show the progess of the experiment. While flying 
freely in the air the proper angle of descent has to be regulated by 
shifting the center of gravity. Of course, the wind plays a very impor- 
tant part here, and it is only by long and constant practice that we 
can learn to make allowance for its irregularities and to steer the, 
apparatus properly. The capricionsness of the wind may exert unequal 
pressure on the great expanse of wing, aiul then it may happen that 
one wing will be elevated higher than the other.

EXTRACTS FROM A PAPER ON FLYING. 



My recent experiuieuts liave been uiade Iruiu liills liavini; an eleva- 
tion of about 250 feet and sloping uniformly every way at an angle of 
10 to 15°. From the lower ridge.s 1 have already sailed a distance of 
over 250 yards. The great difficulty to be encouutereil in the endeavor to 
soar comes in learning t) gaide the flight, rather than in the difficulty 
of providing i)o\A'er to move the wings. 

Progress in the mechanics of flying received at one time a severe 
clieck through the utterances of a high authority in physics. Starting 
Avith an erroneous hypothesis and putting too high a Aalue on the 
amount of work reipiired, he claimed that the maximum of possible 
flight had already been devehjped in the largest birds, and, as man 
represented about f »ur times the heaviest of them, human flight was 




to be discarded as an utter impossibility. Now, it nuist be admitted 
that the difficulties increase with the size of the flying individual; but 
flying itself is not the difficulty, for the largest flyers are at the same 
time the best flyers when they once get going in the air. 

The object of this paper is to attempt to disi)el old prejiulices and to 
win new adherents for the problem in question. Even considered only 
as a physical exercise, the sjiort of flying would create one of tlie health- 
iest of all enjoyments and add one of the most eflective remedies to the 
means now adopted for the conipiest of those diseases which are inci- 
dent to our modern culture.

PKACTICAL EXPERIMENTS IN SOAKING.* 



By Otto Lilienthal. 



My own experiments in Hying were begnn with great caution. The 
first attempts were made from a grass plot in my own garden upon 
whicL, at a height of 1 meter from tlie ground, I had erected a spring- 
board, from which the leap with my sailing apparatus gave me an 
oblique descent through the air. After several hundred of these leaps 
I gradually increased tlie height of my board to 2i meters, and from 
that elevation I could safely and without danger cross the entire grass 
plot. I then went to a hilly section, where leaps from gradually 
increased elevations added to my skill and suggested many improve- 
ments to my apparatus. The readers of Prometheus have already been 
informed of the selection of a piece of ground which enabled me to 
extend my flights over a distance of several hundred meters. The 
remainder of the summer since my last publication (in Nos. 204 and 
205 of this journal) ha-s sufficed to bring these experiments to a termi- 
nation and to dispose of some important questions as to the possible 
results. 

Indulging in subtile inquiries and theorizing does not promote our 
knowledge of flying, nor can the simple observation of natural flight, 
as useful as it may be, transform men into flying beings, although it 
may give us hints pointing towards the accomplishmentof our purpose. 
We see buzzards rise skyward without any motion of their wings; we 
observe how the storks intermingle in the flock with outspread wings 
and in beautiful spirals; we see, high up in the air, the piratical falcon 
in ({uest of booty remain stationary in the wind for minutes at a time. 
We recognize every spot on his brownish plumage, but we do not per- 
ceive the least exertion of his wings to maintain his stationary position, 
and this small bird of prey is not in the least concerned at our pres- 
ence. He reciprocates the protection secured for him since Brehm and 
other naturalists have pointed out his usefulness by undisturbedly pre- 
cipitating himself to the grass before our eyes, and, seizing a grass- 
hopper, we again see him meters above our heads without having 
detected the least flapping of his wings during the entire performance.

19G ' PRACTICAL EXPERIMENTS IN SOARING. 

We notice that constaut changes are going on in the force of the 
wind, but the falcon does not alter his position by a single inch, although 
having already begun devouring his prey, he can give but divided 
attention to his flight. Now he bends his head downward and back- 
ward, so that the Avorld below must appear to him inverted, and evi- 
dently enjoys eating the insect as his talons leisurely pluck it to pieces. 
In the position in mid-air (which is niaiutained even during this employ- 
ment) he appears like an automaton rooted in the wind. Just the 
faintest balancing motion, apparently serving to compensate for the 
irregularities of the wind, is ])erceptib]e in the extreme points of his 
wings, which are slightly inclined backwards. 

This poise of the falcon in mid-air, which appears to us as a defiance 
to the hvw of gravity, may be considered not only the most remarkable, 
but also the most instructive example of flight. 

In observing the majestic, circular soaring of otlier aerial travellers, 
one can readily believe that these skillful wing artists understand how 
to protit by the jieriodic currents of the air, and in describing spirals 
instinctively transform the force of the opposing current of air into 
lifting or suspensive power; but when the bird, without the least move 
ment of his wings, remains stationary in one point of the sky, we are 
led to infer the existence of a peculiar form of surface which may be 
held suspended by the application of a uniforndy moving wind. 

While the existence of this possibility may be demonstrated by 
elementary exi^eriments, this does not discover the secret of soaring, 
and though nature conclusively demonstrates that it can not be the 
want of power that prevents our flying, that knowledge alone does not 
provide us with wings. Furthermore, while nature points out how it 
is done, that does not necessarily imply that there may not be found 
other ways or means of doing it. However we may theorize on the 
subject, without a practical application of the theory, things will 
remain unchanged and our flight will only be in imagination or in 
dreams. 

My experiments, then, should form th<^ transition, the first step from 
theory to practice. Like others, I too have, in the beginning, attempted 
using machines with movable wings, but this does not ajiparently aid 
in the development of an art of flight. The mark is too high and not 
immediately attainable, and one's ambition should be fully satisfied by 
withstanding the wind with wings of the size adapted to flying men. 
Each flight demands a rising from the ground and a landing; the 
former is as difficult as the latter is dangerous, and regardless of the 
most ingeniously constructed apparatus, the art of both will have to 
be acquired just as the child learns to stand and to walk. Anyone 
desirous of exposing himself unnecessarily to danger and of ruining 
in a few seconds the carefully constructed apparatus need onlj^ expose 
his machine, to the wind without having familiarized himself with its 
management, and he will soon know what it means to control an appa-

ratus of from 10 to 15 square meters in area, where other people can 
but with difficulty manage an open umbrella. 

To all those who, by their own experience or otherwise, can form a 
correct idea of the difficulties that present themselves, the instanta- 
neous photograi^hs by Mr. Alexander Krajewsky, accompanying this 
paper, may be of interest. 

In continuation of my formerly published experiments, I endeavor 
with every uew trial to gain more complete control over the wind, and 
without disregarding- any necessary precaution I have already suc- 
ceeded in at least tem^iorarily retaiuiug a uniform level and even in 
remaining- stationary in the wind for a few seconds. Tlje simplicity of 
Diy flying- machine, which is controlled by shifting the center of gravity, 
has compelled me to avoid strong- breezes, which however might pre- 
sumably have aided in securing- a stationary position. During- my con 
tinned flights, however, I have been at times surprised by a sudden 
increase in the force of the wind which either carried me upward almost 
perpendicularly or supjiorted me in a stationary position for a few 
seconds to the great delight of the spectators. 

The freedom from accidents in these apparently daring attempts may 
be considered proof that the apparatus already described offers ample 
security in carrying out my plan of investigation. 

To those who, from a modest beginning and with gradually increased 
extent and elevation of flight have gained full control over the appa- 
ratus, it is not in the least dangerous to cross deep and broad ravines. 

It is a difficult task to convey to one who has never enjoyed aerial 
flight a clear perception of the exhilerating pleasure of this elastic 
motion. The elevation above the ground loses its terror, because we 
have learned by experience what sure dependence may be placed upon 
the buoyancy of the air. Gradual increase of the extent of these lofty 
leaps accustoms the eye to look unconcernedly upon the landscape 
below. To the mountain climber the uncomfortable sensation experi- 
enced in trusting his foot into the slippery notch cut in the ice or to a 
treacherous rubble above deep abysses, with other dangers t)f the most 
terrifying nature, may often tend to lessen the enjoyment of the mag-- 
nificent scenery. The dizziness caused by this, however, has nothing 
in common with the sensation experienced by him who trusts himself 
to the air; for the air demonstrates its buoyancy in not only separating 
him from the depth below, but also in keeping him suspended over it. 
Eesting upon the broad wings of a well-tested flying- machine, which, 
yielding- to the least pressure of the body, obeys our directions,- sur- 
rounded by air and supported only by the wind, a feeling of absolute 
safety soon overcomes that of danger. 

One who has already practiced straight flights for some time will 

•naturally endeavor to next guide his apparatus in a lateral direction, 

and indeed there is nothing easier than the guiding of the aerodrome, 

which is accomplished by shifting the center of gravity. The steering

blades have uothiug to do with this, their function being to keep the 
machine facing the wind. 

Plate XIII, lig. 1, illustrates such a serpentine flight. I started from a 
hill to the right, the base of which is still visible in the ligure/and 
soared toward the plain below in a somewhat circuitous path. The 
photograph was taken at the moment when I had almost turned my back 
to the plain. The view shown in Plate xiii, fig. 2, was taken at a time 
when I was lifted and carried upward by a suddenly increasing cur- 
rent, which impeded progress and rendered me absolutely stationary. 

In Plate xiv, flights are represented in geometric perspective. The 
lowest dotted line, d e, was described during a calm. Even the expert 
flyer must descend during a calm at an angle of from 0^ to 10^. 
The run began upon the top of the hill, near a ; at i I left firm ground 
and endeavored to glide along the mountain slope, placing the wings 
at c at such an angle that the pressure of the wind, X, Avould not only 
supjjort the machine, but also carry it forward. This increased the 
velocity sufficiently to enter at d into the line of stable flight. Such 
a maneuver is necessary, because a velocity of 9 meters per second is 
required for a flight in a calm, while but G meters were obtained by 
the run. At e the ground has almost been reached, and by raising tlie 
wings slightly in front the momentum is diminished and a landing 
eft'ected without serious jar. 

The second line, c/, shows a flight in a moderate breeze, in which 
the proper position with a downward inclination of 6° had been 
assumed immediately upon starting. 

Flight against the wind is slower. The distance to be accomplished 
may be extended by a carefully determined and properly maintained 
Inclination of the wings; in fact, by careful observation of this tlie 
soaring may be extended over a distance equal to ten times the height 
of the starting point. 

During a strong breeze a sinuous line of flight results from the tem- 
porary support given by the wind at times. This is shown in the line 
b (f, though such experiments should be. undertaken only by one fully 
ftimiliar with the management of the apparatus. The indefinable pleas- 
ure however exi)erienced in soaring high up in the air, rocking above 
sunny slopes without jar or noise, accompanied only by the wolian 
music issuing from the wires of the apparatus, is well worth the labor 
given to the task of becoming an expert. 

Itdo:iS not seem at all impossible that the continuance of such flights 
may lead to free, continuous sailing in agitated air. 

The results of our present experiments already furnish an indication 
of the degree of mechanical energy that must be added to that involved 
in oblique soaring to enable us to gain independent horizontal flight. 

The solution of this problem,* however, would exceed the purposes 
of the present article, and I content myself by stating that the condi-

tions of a motoi' can easily be met, supposing- that the propelling- 
mechanism has been properly chosen, and that extraordinary light- 
ness is not even essential. 

The interests of the professional flight-essayer demand further 
experiments in practical flight and the gain of further efficiency. Bnt 
even to those who only desire to utilize, as a means of sport, the results 
already obtained, opportunities are oft'ered to promote the interest of 
the problem of flight and the way for a more ready i)rosecution of the 
subject. 

The time has passed when every ])erson harboring- thoughts of aerial 
flight can at once be pronounced a charlatan. If we may hope that our 
aeronautic publications are eventually to be taken seriously by the 
majority of those skilled in allied subjects, it is imj)ortant at the out- 
side to awaken the interest of those whose natural concern this great 
problem should be, but who now shrug- their shoulders. We shall 
then at least be able to show some practical results, and towards these 
ends we here take the first step. 



PHENOMENA CONNECTED WITH CLOUDY CONDENSATION.* 



By .T<MIN AiTKEN, F. Iv. S. 



In the tirst part of this commiinicatiou I intend giving; the resnlts of 
an investigation into the phenomena connected with the chindy con- 
densation prodnced when a jet of steam mixes with ordinary air, with 
special reference to the marked change which takes place in the appear- 
ance of the jet by electrification and other canses. In the second part 
will be given the residts of an investigation into certain color i)he- 
nomena, which can be i>rodnced when the condensation is made to take 
Itlace nnder certain conditions, and it is thought that these exi)eri- 
mental color i)henomena, if they do not give the ex])lanation of a 
"green sun," at least enable us to reproduce it artificially with the 
materials existing in our atmosphere. 

PART T. — STEAM JETS. 

Milieu a jet of steam escapes into the air condensation at once ensues 
by the expansion and the mixing of the steam with the cold air. The 
result is the jet becomes distinctly visible by the light reflected by the 
minute drops of water carried along in the mixed gases and vapor. 
At first sight there is little that is interesting in the changes then tak- 
ing place. The subject has therefore attracted but little attention 
and has been but little studied. This is evident from the great interest 
that has been taken in the change produced in the appearance of the 
jet when it is electrified, yet I hoj^e to be able to show that this is only 
one of a number of causes which alter the appearance of the con- 
densing steam. 

R. Helmlioltz was the first to show that when an ordinary jet of 
steam is electrified there is a marked increase in the density of the con- 
densation. The effect of the electricity is certainly very remarkable. 
Tlie instant the jet is electrified it at once changes and becomes much 
denser, and the condensed particles also become visible much closer 
up to the nozzle from which the steam is escaping. For the conveu-

ieuee ot'descrii)tion we sliall call this secoiid form ofeoiidcusatioii dense 
condensation^ while that usually observed we shall call ordinary con- 
densation. Xot that there is any hard and fast line between these two 
forms, as the one may be made to change by imperceptible dej»rees 
into the other. All that is meant is that the (Mie is dense compared 
Avith the other. 

One result of this investigation is that in addition to electrification 
of the jet, there are four other ways in which the ordinary condensa- 
tion may be changed into the dense form. These five ways of changing 
the ordinary into the dense form of condensation are: 

1. Electrification of the jet. 

2. An increase in the number of dust nuclei. 

3. Cold or low temperature of the air. 

4. High pressure of the steam. 

5. Obstructions in front of the jet and rough or irregular nozzles. 
We shall now describe some experiments to illustrate each of these 

dift'erent ways of causing the ordinary condensation to change and 
take the dense form. In the exi^eriments to be described, the steam 
was generally generated in a copper boiler, which could be pressed up 
to fully one atmosphere. The nozzle from which the steam escaped 
was placed at some distance from the boiler to prevent the hot gases 
influencing the jet. The steam was conveyed by means of a metal 
pipe to the nozzle, and a water trap was placed near the end of this 
pipe to i)revent the irregularities which would be produced if the water 
condensed in the pipe were allowed to issue from the nozzle. The noz- 
zle generally used was made of brass, carefully bored to a diameter of 
1"""., the diameter of the bore widening inwards, while the outside of 
the nozzle was turned to a fine edge in front. With this apparatus 
most of the experiments were made, but occasionally glass vessels and 
nozzles were used, as well as vessels and nozzles of other materials, but 
with no marked difference in the results. 

1. Elect riji vat ion. — In the exi)eriments with electricity only steam of 
a low i)ressnre should be used. The reason of this will be understood 
from what follows under division 4. In these experiments slight electri 
fieation was used, as only an old fashioned cylinder electrical machine 
was available for the purjtose, and in the dam]) atmosphere produced 
by the steam jet the electrificaticm was only capable of giving a spark 
of about l*^^'". or generally less. 

The necessary condition for the electricity producing any effecton the 
jet is that the particles in the jet be electrified either by direct dis- 
charge or by an induction discharge. The mere presence of an elec- 
trified body near the jet has no influence whatever. In order that 
it may have an effect, the electrified body must terminate in a point 
placed near the jet, and the potential must be great enough to cause a 
discharge of the electricity to the jet. When this takes place, the jet 



PHENOMENA CONNECTED WITH CLOUDY CONDENSATION. 203 

at once becomes dense and remaius in that condition while the discharge 
continues. The electrified body may however electrify the jet by 
induction. If for instance the electrified body be a sphere, and the 
nozzle from which the steam is issuing be pointed, the electricity dis- 
charged by the nozzle will electrify the particles, and the condensation 
becomes dense. But if the nozzle be not pointed, then the presence of 
the electrified body produces no change, as there is no discharge of 
electricity. But if now we hold a needle, or other pointed conductor 
near the jet issuing from the rounded nozzle, ifc at once becomes dense 
by the induction discharge from the point. In place of a point in the 
last experiment, we may use a flame; in fact, we may use any influence 
which will enable the electrified body to electrify the particles in the 
jet. 

Another way of making this experiment is to insulate the boiler, and 
electrify it. If the nozzle be pointed, the jet becomes dense on electri- 
fication; but if it be rounded, the electrification has no eftect. If, how- 
ever, we bring a needle or a flame near the rounded nozzle, the jet 
becomes dense. To get no ettect from the electrification it is necessary 
that the nozzle be a ball of some size, the orifice through which the 
steam issues being, of course, the same diameter as that of the pointed 
jet. 

The eftect of the electrification has been studied by R. Helmholtz and 
by Mr. Shelford Bidwell,* but neither of them seems to be satisfied 
with any explanation offered. Mr. Bidwell, from a spectroscopic exam- 
ination of the light transmitted through the jet under the two condi- 
tions, came to the conclusion that in the dense condition the particles 
were larger than in the ordinary form of condensation ; and he thinks 
that the increase in size is due to the electricity causing the small drops 
of water to coalesce and form larger drojjs. In support of this explana- 
tion, he quotes Lord Rayleigh's experiments on the coalescence of drops 
in water jets "while under the influence of electricity. As Mr. Bidwell 
does not put forth this opinion as final, there is less reason for hesita- 
tion in stating that the conclusion I have come to is diametrically 
opposed to Mr. Bidwell's. 

There seems to be no doubt that electricity will act on these very 
small drops of water in the same way as it acts on the drops in a jet of 
water. That its action is similar is easily proved by the following 
experiment with mist drops : Take a small open vessel full of hot water — 
it is better to color the water nearly black for convenience of observa- 
tion — a cup of tea without cream does very well for the puri)ose. Place 
the cup on a table between the window and the observer. On now 
looking at the cup from such a position that no bright light is reflected 
from the surface of the liquid, there will be seen what looks like scum 
on the surface of the tea. That scum is, however, only a multitude of 
small mist-drops, which have condensed out of the rising steam and 

* L. E. D. Phil. Mag., February, 1890, vol. xxix, pp. 158-162, 



204 PHENOMENA CONNECTED WITH CLOUDY CONDENSATION. 

have fallen on the siiifaee of the liijuid, where they are seen floating. 
If now we take a piece of brown paper, or any convenient material, and 
rub it sliglitly and hold it over the cup, the ''scum'' will disappear at 
once, and be replaced by other drops when the electrified body is 
removed. As in Lord Kayleigh's experiments, a very feeble electrifica- 
tion is sufficient to cause the absorption of the drops into the body of 
the licpiid. It is therefore not because there is sujjposed to be any 
difference in the action of electricity on large and on very small drops 
that a different conclusion from Mr. BidwelFs has been arrived at, but 
because all the experiments to be described point to the conclusion 
that the dense form of condensation is not due to an increase in the 
size of the drops, but to an increase in the number, accompanied of 
course by a diminution in the size. 

We may suppose the following to be something like the manner in 
which the electricity acts on the jet: In a steam jet the rapid move- 
ments of the drops give rise to frequent collisions, and these result in 
the coalescence of many of the drops, so that each diop in ordinary 
condensation is made up of a number; but when the jet is electrified, 
the electrification prevents the i)articles coming into contact, as they 
repel each other, and the consequence is we have a greater number of 
particles in a dense and electrified jet than in an ordinary one. 

Lord Eayleigh's experiments on the action of electricity on water 
jets support this view. He has shown that in order to produce (coales- 
cence the electrification must be very slight, and he also points out 
that the coalescence does not seem to be so much due to electrification 
as to a difference of electrification, which would appear to cause a dis- 
charge of electricity to take place between the drops, which ruptures 
the films, so causing contact. Further, he has shown that when the 
electrification is strong and the conditions are such that the drops 
become electrified, the effect is diametrically the opposite, and instead 
of coalescence the particles now scatter far more than the unelectrified 
dro])s. Now from the conditions of the experiments with electrified 
steam jets it is evident that the drops are electrified and are in the 
same condition as the electrified scattering water jet. We are there- 
fore entitled to expect that the electricity will prevent and not aid the 
coalescence of the small drops in the steam jet. 

Other considerations also point to the increase in the density of the 
jet being due to an increase, and not to a diminution in the number of 
drops. We know that if we blow steam into air, that the fewer dust 
nuclei there are in the air the thinner is the condensation; and when 
the dust is nearly all out of the air, only a fine rain falls which can 
scarcely be detected by the unaided eye. Further, the evidence from 
condensation produced by expanding moist air points to the same con- 
clusion, namely, that the more dust particles there are in the air the 
denser is the condensation when cooled by expansion, and the purer 



PHENOMENA CONNECTED WITH CLOUDY CONDENSATION. 205 

the air is the tliiuner is the cloud.* These experinieiits all point to 
the conclusion that the dense form of condensation is due to a large 
number of water drops, and the thinner form to a smaller number, 
though of greater individual size. The only condition under which it 
seems probable that tbe increase in number will not give rise to 
increase in density is when the particles are so small that they are 
unable to retle(.'t waves of any color of light. So far as has yet been 
observed, this never happens. However slight the amount of expan- 
sion, the greater number of particles always gives the denser form of 
condensation. 

The action of the electricity on the jet does not appear to be any- 
thing positive; it rather seems to prevent something which takes place 
under ordinary conditions. For instance, electricity has no effect in 
thickening the cloud of so-called steam rising from a hot and wet sur- 
face. The electrically driven current of air from a point when directed 
to the steaming suri^iee has no effect whatever on the density of the 
condensation. Nor has electricity any effect (m the steam rising from 
an open vessel. The small drops of water under these conditions move 
but slowly, and there is but little tendency for them to come into col- 
lision with each other. There are therefore few collisions for the elec- 
tricity to prevent, and little or no thickening is produced by electrilica- 
tion under those conditions. Further on we shall have frequent oppor- 
tunities of seeing that the dense form of condensation is the result of 
an increase in the number of particles, and that whatever gives rise to 
an increase in the number causes an increase in the density. 

When the jet is electrified and becomes dense, it has been noticed 
by others that it emits at the same time a peculiar sound, and I find 
that whenever the jet becomes dense, from whatever cause, it begins 
"to speak." But when the density is due to electrification, the sound 
is slightly different from the sound emitted when dense from any 
of the other causes. When dense from cause other than electri- 
fication, the sound is similar to that produced by the jet striking an 
obstruction; but when electrified, the sound is a combination of this 
sound with another due to tlie discliarge of the electricity, and this 
second sound depends on the manner in which the electric discharge 
takes place. If the discharging point is not sharp, and the potential 
is just sufficient to cause discharge, then the discharge is not continu- 
ous, but takes place at short intervals. It becomes, in f^ict, a series 
of disruptive discharges, and gives rise to a tluttering noise. This 
rtuttering sound is greatly increased if the ])oint terminates in a small 
ball of about 1 millimeter diameter, and it is entirely abolished if we 
use a very sharp point, or better, a llame. The discharge with either 
the very sharp i^oint or the flame is perfectly continuous, and nothing 
but the slight hissing that accompanies all dense forms of condensa- 
tion is heard when the jet is electrified.

206 PHENOMENA CONNECTED WITH CLOUDY CONDENSATION. 

It has generally been stated that the eftect of the electrifl cation is sud- 
den and marked, that whenever the jet is electrified it at once becomes 
very dense. This however is due to the manner in which the jet has 
generally been electrified. Some degree of potential is necessary to pro- 
duce 11 discharge from the j)oint, and whenever the i)otential is high 
enough to cause this, it is sufficient to charge the drops high enough to 
give rise to a very dense condensation. But if we make the discharg- 
ing point extremely fine, or assist the discharge by means of a flame, 
then we may begin with electricity of a very low ijotential, and the 
increase in the density may be made to begin by almost imperceptible 
degrees and to increase slowly to the dense form by gradually increas- 
ing the potential. 

We shall for the present leave the question of the effect ox^ the ordi- 
nary and the dense forms of condensation on the light transmitted 
through them, as it will be better discussed after we have considered 
all the ways in which the jet may be made dense, and we shall now 
pass on to consider the second of those given in our list. 

2. An increase in tJie numhcr of dust nuclei. — It has been noticed 
by iirevious observers that a flame brought near the jet tended to 
make the condensation dense; but, in describing the exi)eriments, a 
confusion has generally been made between the flame and the pro- 
ducts of the combustion taking i3lace in the flame. So far as I have 
been able to observe, flame has no ettect on the density of conden- 
sation. Neither a luminous flame nor the flame of a Bunsen burner 
has any eflect so long as the products of combustion are kept away from 
the jet. But if the products are drawn into the jet, .they have a very 
marked effect either in increasing or decreasing the density. If the 
flame»is near and the gases are hot, they nuike the jet nearly invis- 
ible, but if the gases are cooled or are not in great quantity, then they 
make the jet as dense as if it were electrified. The simplest way of 
studying this latter effect is to bring the products of combustion to 
the jet by means of a metal tube 2 or 3 centimeters in diameter, and 
about half a^ meter long. A small flame about half a centimeter 
high, i)laced below the level of the jet, is used. One end of the tube is 
kept over the flame while the other can be brought near the nozzle. 
It will be found that Avhen brought into that position the jet will at 
once be(;ome dense, and when it is removed it will return to its ordi- 
nary condition, and become dense again with every return of the 
impure gases. 

The increase in density in this case is due to the greater number of 
dust particles in the gases olfering a greater number of nuclei for con- 
densation, and the result is a great increase in the number of water 
particles and consequent thickening of the condensation, a result 
which, as has already been stated, the author proved some years ago. 

The change in the appearance of the jet when the products of com- 



PHENOMENA CONNECTED WITH CLOUDY CONDENSATION. 207 

bnstiou are brought to it is exactly the same as that produced by 
electrification. The whole jet becomes dense, the condensed particles 
are visible nearly up to the nozzle, and the jet makes the same sound 
as when electritied by silent discharge, and further, electricity of the 
potential used does not make it any denser. 

It seems probable that the very great number of dust particles in 
the products of combustion act in two ways: first, by sui)})lying" a great 
number of nuclei, and second, as the number is greater the drops will 
be smaller, and, on account of their small size, they will have less inde- 
pendent motion, as they will be more guided by the gases than larger 
drops; there wnll therefore be fewer collisions, and not the same 
tendency to the diminution of numbers by the coalescence of a number 
of drops into one. It may be because of the small number of the col-' 
lisious wiien the particles are small that electricity has little or no 
effect on the jet when it is dense from a large supply of nuclei. It is 
possible that some of the increased density produced by the products 
of combustion may be due to the slight electrification of gases from 
flames. But as the electrification from this source is very slight, its 
effects will be extremely feeble indeed when the dust particles are 
developed to the size of drops, so that the electricity from this source 
is not likely to have much effect. 

o. Cold or loic temperatnre of the air. — We now come to the third 
cause of the dense form of condensation, namely, low temperature 
of the air. At first sight it may appear that the above statement 
contains an already well known fact. But while in a certain sense 
this is so, yet there is one ])oint of great im})ortance, which (so far 
as I am aware) has not previously been observed. If we were asked 
to state what is the effect of the temperature of the air on condensa- 
tion of the jet, we probably would say that when the temperature 
of the air is high the condensation is very transparent, owing to there 
being less vapor condensed and to its rapid re-evaporation; and that 
when the temperature became lower and lower the jet gradually 
thickens as the temperature falls, owing to the greater amount of 
condensation caused by the colder air. Such a description is far from 
a full statement of the facts regarding the changes in appearance with 
the fall in temperature, and the explanation is correspondingly faulty. 
There is an influence at work in the condensing jet which, though due 
to temperature, is of tar more importance than the effect of the tem- 
perature on the amount of steam condensed. 

When I first encountered this new influence it greatly puzzled me. 
I had opened the window of the room where the experiments were 
being made, and when the fresh air came in the jet began to behave 
Itself in a most uncertain way. At one moment it w^as quite steady 
ordinary condensation, and the next it would conduct itself as if elec- 
trically excited. Even after the window ^vas closed it continued to 



208 PHENOMENA CONNECTED WITH CLOUDY CONDENSATION. 

cbaiige from the ordinary to tlie deuse form of condensation in a puz- 
zling way. It was first tliouglit that outer air nii<;lit be eleetritied, and 
tests were accordingly made to see if this Avere tlie case. These tests 
showed that if it were electrified it could be so but slightly, as it did 
not affect a gold-leaf electroscope, which it would recpiire to have done 
to have produced the increased density observed in the steam jet. 
Electricity as the solution of the difficulty had, therefore, to be aban- 
doned. The only other influence I could thiidv' of as likely to cause 
the effect was some unknown effect of cold. I therefore took the metal 
tube which had been used in a previous experiment for conveying the 
products of combustion from the flame of the jet and cooled it. On 
now presenting one end of this cold tube to the jet it at once responded, 
and the condensation became as dense as if a flame had been at the 
other end of the tube, or as if the jet had been electrified. 

This eflect was all the more surprising since there was no great 
difference between the temperature of the air in the tube and that of 
the room, — not more than 10° F. Home experiments were therefore 
made to find out the temperature at which this change takes place, 
and to see if it was as sudden as it appeard to be. The jet was 
supplied with air cooled in a pipe, which was surrounded with water 
for regulating the temperature of the air. The steam nozzle was 
placed just inside one end of the pipe and pointiiig outwards, so that 
the jet drew its supply of air out of the tube. Xo very satisiactory 
results were got with this ai)paratus. It may however be mentioned 
that when the air was cooled the jet somewhat suddeidy became deuse, 
and again became ordinary when the temperature was slightly nused; 
but with the apparatus it was diflicult to say what the temperature of 
the air really was when the change took i)lace. 

Another method of studying the effect of temperature on the den- 
sity was tried with fair success. The nozzle was fitted to the end of a 
horizontal pipe; the nozzle also being pointed horizontally. For this 
experin.ent a morning was selected when the temperature of the room 
was low. When the exi)eriments began the temperature was 40^ F. 
At this tem})erature the jet was always dense, and neither electrifica- 
tion nor the products of combustion increased its density. The room 
was now slowly heated, and the jet watched while the temperature 
rose. Up to a temijerature of 4()0 no change took place, and the jet 
was uot made denser by electricity nor by the products of combustion. 
But wheu the temperature rose to 47° the jet began to show signs of 
clearing. The clearing did not however take place regularly; one 
moment the jet was dense and the next it Avas ordinary. These fluctua- 
tions would be duo to the unequal temperature of the air coming to the 
jet. At one moment the air would be the air of the temperature of 
the room; the next would be this air slightly heated by the metal pipe 
and nozzle. So that when the jet drew its sui)ply of air horizontally 
its condensation was ordinary, and when the air currents in the room 



PHENOMENA CONNECTED WITH CLOUDY CONDENSATION. 209 

pieveuted this heated air tVoiii cumiujj; to the jet its coudeusatioii was 
dense. 

A slight alteration was then made in the arrangement. The jet was 
now directed downward at the end of the horizontal pipe. By this 
means the air heated on the pipe and nozzle was prevented from mixing 
with the jet. The jet was directed at a small angle from the vertical 
to prevent the hot air and vapor of the jet rising- to the nozzle. With 
this arrangement the following was the resnlt: Up to a temperature of 
40° tlie condensation was dense, and neither electricity nor the products 
of combustion had any effect on the density; but when the temperature 
rose to about 47° electrihcation began to have just a perceptible effect 
in increasing the density. At about 48° the electricity had an easily 
observed effect, and the products of combustion also had a slight effect. 
At a temperature of 50° the jet had become decidedly thinner, and 
both electricity and the products of combustion had a decided eff"ect 
in increasing its density. When the temperature rose to 55° the jet 
lost iis dense ai)pearance, and both electricity and the products of com- 
bustion had a- very marked effect. 

It might be thought that by observing a steam jet in the open air we 
could tell if the temperature of the air was above or below a certain 
point. This however can only be done in a very rough way, as the 
conditions are variable and not within our knowledge. We would 
require to know the pressure of the steam and the degree to which 
the air was heated bj^ the i)ipe. In a general way it may be stated 
that in the open air a steam jet looks dense if the temperature be below 
50°, and ordinary if abo^'e 55°. But it is often difficult to say what is 
ordinary and what is dense condensation, unless the observations are 
nuide carefully and by examining how close to the nozzle the particles 
are visible. Of course, if we could electrify the jet or supply it with 
the products of combustion, we could tell whenever the tem})erature 
was over or under 47°. 

The sudden alteration in the appearance of the jet when supplied 
with air at a temperature of 46° points to some change in the influences 
in action in the condensing jet. The great increase in density can not 
be due to an increase in the amount of vapor condensed, as the fall in 
the temperature is slight. Further, it will be observed that the jet 
has ceased to be influenced by electricity and by the products of com- 
bustion. The onlj' explanation I could think of was that at the tem- 
perature of the mixed cold air and steam some alteration had taken place 
in the surface films of the water drops. The jet looked as if something- 
came into action at that temperature which prevented the drops coa- 
lescing when they came into collision, or what would amount to the 
same thing, that at high temperatures there was no tendency for the 
drops to recoil after impact, and that when the temperature fell this 
proi)erty made its appearance and i)revented contact in the same way 
as we have supposed the electrification does. 
SM 93 U 



210 PHENOMENA CONNECTED WITH CLOUDY CONDENSATION. 

The siuiplest way of testing this exphiiiatioii was to repeat Lord 
Rayleigh's experiment with water Jets, but in pUice of cold water using 
hot. The result is, the experiment entirely confirms this explanation. 
So long as the water in the jet is above a certain temperature there is 
no scattering whatever, but perfect coalescence of the drops on con- 
tact. As a consequence the jet is not intiueuced in the slightest degree 
by the presence of an electrified body. It is only after the tempera- 
ture falls below a certain point tliat the scattering commences and 
electricity begins to have an mfiuence. 

This experiment shows that it is only when the drops are below a 
certain temperature that tiieir surface films act in the way we are 
accustomed to observe at ordinary temperatures — that is, rei)el each 
other; and that when tlie temperature is high there is an entire change, 
and the surface films no hunger repel, but coalescence of the drops takes 
place at each collision. It aviII be noticed that the point here is, not 
the appearance of any new infiuence with the low temperature, as the 
films are then in the condition with which we are acquainted; it is at 
the high temperature that the new condition comes into action and 
the films lose the resisting action with which we are acquainted. 

Now, it seems extremely probable that the change in the appearance 
of the steam jet when the temi)erature of the air is lowered is due to 
the temperature of the jet falling to the temperature at which this repul- 
sive action makes its ap[)earance. 

There is however an experimental link wanting to bind these two 
Ijhenomena together, which I have desired to complete, but unfortu- 
nately experimental difficulties stopped the way. The link wanting is 
some exiteriinental jjioof that the Jet gets dense at the same temper 
ature that the water Jet begins to scatter. On attempting to take the 
tenipciature of the jet difticiilties presented themselves. If it is to be 
taken Avitli a thermometer, where is it to be placed? A very slight 
change in the position of the bulb of a thermometer ])laced in the Jet 
gives a different reading. It does not matter whether the change be 
made nearer or further from the center of the jet or nearer or further 
from the no/zle. In all cases a very slight change gives a considerable 
dift'erence of temperature. It may however be stated that when the 
bulb was placed in the center of the Jet and near the nozzle it showed 
a temperature of about 130°, but that figure can only be looked upon 
as a very rough approximation to the true temperature. 

One or two atteiui)ts were however made to find the temperature at 
which water films ceased to have any repulsive action. This was done 
by means of a small water jet, and it was found that above 155° there 
was no scattering. It was not till the temi)erature fell below that 
point that electrification had any eft'ect. This was the temperature of 
the drops themselves, not of the supply for the Jet, and it may not be 
quite ac<'urate, as the drops tend to cool very quickly. Another method 
of finding this temperature Mas to observe the highest temperature at 



i

which the mist drops tioated ou water in the experiment previously 
described. This method is not very satisfactory, on account of the dif- 
ficulty of seeing' the drops wlien the temperature is high, owing to the 
amount of condensed steam hanging over the water. It is also difficult 
to keep the surface of the water clean. The tests by this method gave 
a temperature considerably higher tha:i that given by the water jet. 
Neither of these methods however, promises to give satisfactory infor- 
mation on this point; but, if it were desired, the effect of temperature 
on the contact of films could be studied in a more accurate way. 

It is difficult to imagine any sudden chang-e in the action of the films 
at or about the temperatures indicated. There is no corresijonding 
change, so far as I am aware, in the surface tension. We might picture 
to ourselves the change to be brought about by the alteration which 
takes place in the intervening" gases. When the drops are cold the 
bounding surfaces are water and air with very little vapor in it. And 
perhaps we may be permitted to assume that the surface film has a 
layer of air condensed on it, and it may be this condensed layer of air 
which prevents contact when the drops come into collision. But when 
the temperature is high the ^conditions are changed. The bounding 
surfaces are now water and air with a large amount of vapor in it, and 
this vapor may play an important part in bringing about the contact, 
by the violent interchange of water molecules taking place at the sur- 
faces of the films and weakening the condensed films of air. If this 
explanation be correct, then there is really no sudden change in the 
action of the films, and the repulsion is a gradually increasing one with 
fall of temperature. Though a somewhat sudden change in the api»ear- 
ance of this jet might seem to indicate a sudden change in the action 
of the films, yet the change may be really a slowly increasing one, and 
the sudden change in the appearance of the jet may be due to the 
repulsion rising to such an amount that the very small particles are 
prevented from coalescing. If the relative temperatures given for the 
coalescence of water drops and mist drops be correct, then the grad- 
ual rise in the repulsion with fall in temperature may be the exj^lana- 
tion of why the drops in a water jet coalesce at a lower temperature 
than the mist drops on the surface of water. The water may require 
to be cooled to a lower temperature before the repulsion is sufficient to 
prevent the heavier drops from coalescing, while the less repulsion at 
the higher temperature may be sufficient to prevent the lighter mist 
drops from coming into contact. The same explanation helj)S to account 
for the increased density produced by increasing the dust i)articles, a 
less repulsion being sufficient to protect the excessively small drops. 

The explanations we have here offered of the action of electricity and 
low temperature are in complete agreement. In ordinary condensation 
when the temperature of the air is high there is no surface repulsion, 
owing to the high temperature in the jet, and many of the particles 
coalesce on collision with each other; but when the drops are electri- 



212 PHENOMENA CONNECTED WITH CLOUDY CONDENSATION. 

iied these iiiutual repulsions prevent contact, iind tbe result is a large 
increase in the number of drops and a dense form of condensation. On 
the other hand, when the temperature is lowered, surface film repulsion 
comes into action, contact is prevented, and the drops do not coalesce 
ou collision, and the result is exactly the same as if they were electrified. 
In these renuirks no reference has been made to the effect of the dry- 
ness of the air on the density of the condensation. It seems probable 
that the relati\e humidity of the air will have a less influence on the 
density than on the duration of the jet; that is, tlie length of time the 
drops take to evaporate. 

4. High pressure of the steam. — The fourth cause of the dense form of 
condensation is high pressure of the steam. If the temperature be below 
46° the condensation is dense at all i)ressures, but as the temperature 
rises, the condensation ceases to be dense if the pressure of the steam 
be low. But if we now raise the pressure, the,iet again becomes dense, 
and the higher the temperature of the air the higher the pressure must 
be raised to produce the dense form of condensation. The action of 
the high pressure in producing the dense condensation is more complex 
tlian any of the previous causes. It acts, first, by the more rapid move- 
ments of the jet mixing a larger amount of air with the steam, by which 
means a greater number of dust nuclei are taken into the jet; and, sec- 
oiul, a lower temperature is also produced, which probably brings the 
temperature of the drops low enough for the repulsive action of the 
films to come into play. But in addition to the eft'ects of a greater 
amount of air being mixed with the steam, a third action here conies 
into play. Owing to the violent rush of steam, the condensation takes 
place more rapidly ; and it has been found that the more rapidly the 
condensation is effected the gieater is the number of particlea-formed. 
If tlie condensation takes place slowly, a much less nundjer of nuclei are 
sufllcient to relieve the super-saturation, as there is time for the move- 
ments of the water molecules to take place; but if the rate of conden- 
sation be forced, then the tension of super-saturation compels a great 
many more dust particles to become centers of condensation. The 
result of this is, that with two samples of the same mixture of air and 
steam, if one of them be condensed slowly the clouding is thin, while 
if the other be condensed (juickly it is thick. This action will come 
into play in the steam issuing at high pressure, when the steam is rap- 
idly expanded, cooled, and then mixed with cold air. 

The increased density in-oduced by increase of pressure also takes 
place somewhat suddenly, thougli not quite so suddenly as when the 
density is produced by the other causes. The jet first gradually thick- 
ens as the pressure rises, then a stage is arrived at when it somewhat 
suddenly becomes dense. When this last stage is arrived at, neither 
electrification nor the products of combustion cause any increase in 
the density. The first thickening is i^robably the result of the quick- 
ening of the condensation and increase in the number of dust nuclei; 



PHENOMENA CONNECTED WITH CLOUDY CONDENSATION. 213 

and the suddeu increase in density is probably due to the temperature 
falling- low enough for the films of the drops to have a repulsive action, 
sufficient to prevent them from coalescing. 

■). Rough nozzles and obstnictious hi front of jets. — If we use a nozzle 
of irregular form, or having roughened edges, it is found that it gives 
a dense condensation at a lower pressure than a nozzle of circular sec- 
tion with smoothbore and thin, even edges. This is owing to the irreg- 
ularities in the nozzle, producing eddies in the jet, and mixing a greater 
amount of air with the steam, so cooling it more and supi)lying it with 
a greater number of nuclei. It, in fact, acts in the same direction as 
increase of pressure, and aids pressure in producing its results with 
a less velocity of steam. 

An obstruction in front of the jet acts in a similar manner, if we 
have a jet of steam of such a pressure that at the temperature of the 
air it gives oidy the ordinary form of condensation. If now we place 
an obstruction in front of the jet so as to produce eddies, the conden- 
sation at once becomes dense. Wind has also a somewhat similar 
effect. The reason of the increased density in these cases is the same 
as for the jets issuing from irregular nozzles. They all assist the f>res- 
sure in intensifying the density of the condensation by lowering the 
temperature of the jet, increasing the number of nuclei and quicken- 
ing the rate of condensation. 

The seat of the sensitiveness of the jet. — The seat of maximum sensi- 
tiveness to all influences tending to change the condensation from 
ordinary to dense is near the origin of the jet close to the nozzle. The 
different influences, however, affect the jet to different distances from its 
origin. The most limited in the range of its action is cold, which only 
produces the dense condensation when it acts near the nozzle, whereas 
some of the other influences have some effect, though a gradually 
decreasing one, to a distance of li or 3 centimeters from the nozzle. 

The following experiment illustrates the limited range of the action 
of cold: A piece of ice about 2 centimeters thick was selected, and a 
small hole bored through it. The ice was then held so the steam jet passed 
thiough the opening. While the ice was held at a distance of 1 centi- 
meter from the nozzle, almost no eflect was produced, though nuich 
cold air from the ice was mixing with the jet. But when the ice was 
brought nearer the origin of the jet, so that the nozzle almost entered 
the plane of the ice, the dense condensation immediately appeared. 

The range of sensitiveness of the jet to change of condensation by 
obstructions is also very limited. It is only when the obstruction acts 
near the nozzle that its eflect is great. For instance, the blade of the 
knife resting on the nozzle with its back or edge pointing in the direc- 
tion of the jet, and depressed so as to deflect the jet sligljtly, causes 
the jet to become very dense. But if the knife acts on the jet at a dis- 
tance of only 1 centimeter from the nozzle very little increase in density 
is produced. 



214 PHENOMENA CONNECTED WITH CLOUDY CONDENSATION. 

Th(^ ran^e of action of electricity is inucli greater than tliat of cold 
or obstnictiou. If we screen the nozzle and tlie part of tlie jet near it 
from electrification, it will be found that at a distance of 3 or 4 centi- 
meters a slight increase in density can be produ(:>ed with the electrifi- 
cation used in tliese experiments. 

The action of the products of combustion has a range similar to that 
of electricity. If the products are supplied to the jet at a distance of 
3 or 4 centimeters from the nozzle, a sliglit increase in thickness can 
be detected where tiie impure gases meet the jet; but the effect is very 
slight compared with that produced when the gases are taken in at the 
origin of the jet. 

The limited range of the action of cold is quite what might be 
expected. IS ear the nozzle the temperature of the jet is high, and there 
the drops have no repulsive action; but at a short distauee from the 
nozzle the temperature is low enough to allow this repulsion to come 
into action, and the consequence is that any further cooling after the 
temperature is below a certain point produces little or no effect. It is 
only when the temperature is above this point that tlie cooling has any 
iutluence. The same explanation holds good for the limited range of 
the action of obstructions in front of the jet. 

At a distance of a few centimeters from the nozzle new drops seem 
still to be forming, as the density of the condensation is slightly increased 
by increasing the supply of nuclei at that distance. The drops seem 
also occasionally to coalesce at a distance of 3 or 4 centimeters from the 
nozzle, as electricity slightly' increases the density of the condensation 
even at that distance. 

PART II.— COL(3R CONNECTED WITH CLOUDY CONDENSATION. 

In the following remarks it is not intended to discuss the many color 
phenomena which are known to be connected with cloudy condensa- 
tion. Attention will be confined princii^aily to some new phenomena, 
the experimental illustration of which has been developed in the pres- 
ent investigation. 

Before describing these experiments it may be as well to refer to 
some changes which take place in the constitution of cloudy condensa- 
tion, both while it is forming and after it has been developed, as it will 
be necessary for us to keep certain points in view while discussing the 
color j)henomena. There are two points to which special refereu(;e is 
re<piired. These are, first, the manner in which the appearance of the 
condensation is affected by the greater or less degree of super-satura- 
tion, that is, by the rate at which the condensation is made to take 
place; and, second, the changes which take place in the appearance of 
this cloudy condensation after the tendency for the vapor to deposit has 
stopped. •• 

These two points may be best discussed by taking the second first. 
Suppose we blow some steam into the air inside a glass vessel and leave 



1 



PHENOMENA CONNECTED WITH CLOUDY CONDENSATION. 215 

it undistuibed. If we examine tlie cloudy coudeusatioii after a time we 
shall find that a considerable change has taken place in its appearance. 
The change is due to two causes. Part is due to the gradual descent 
of the particles, by which a clear space is formed in tlie upper i)art of 
the vessel. But it will also be observed that the clouding- in the lower 
partis much thinner than it was at first. Probably part of this thin- 
ning is due to some of the particles having fallen to the bottom of the 
vessel, but this is not the i)rincipal cause of the change. The thinning 
is due mainly to a reduction in the number of particles in the air, by 
the smaller particles gradually becoming absorbed by the larger ones. 
Tliis is caused by the vapor pressure at the surface of small particles 
being greater than at the surface of larger ones, with the result that 
the smaller particles evaporate in air of the same humidity in which 
the larger ones are condensing vapor. 

We are now in a position to understand our first point, namely, why 
the degree of super-saturation by which the condensation is j)roduced 
should have an eff'ect on the appearance of the condensed va^ior. For 
the study of tliis point the condensation produced by expansion is the 
most convenient, as it is more under our control than the condensation 
in steam jets. Suppose we take a glass flask connected with an air pump. 
If we wet the inside of the flask and then fill it with unfiltered air, the 
slightest expansion of the moist air by the pump will cause condensa- 
tion to take place. But the density of the condensation which can be 
produced by any degree of expansion will depend on the rate at which 
the expansion is made. If the expansion be made very slowly, thecloud- 
iug is very thin, but if it be made rapidly, it is very thick. If the 
expansion be done slowly, the amount of super-saturation is only slight, 
and only the largest dust particles come into action as active centers 
of condensation ; and after a particle of dust has once become a nucleus, 
it has tlien, in virtue of its size, an advantage over the particles which 
have not begun to have vapor condensed on them. The result of this 
is that so long as the degree of super-saturation is very slight, these 
large particles relieve the tension, and if by any chance other dust 
])articles become active any reduction in the rate of condensation allows 
the large particles, after they have relieved the tension, to rob the 
small ones of their burden of water, so that a slow rate of condensation 
always produces a snuill number of drops and a thin form of clouding. 

But now suppose you cause the expansion to be made rapidly; the 
super- saturation then becomes much greater, as there is not time for 
the water molecules to select a resting jdace, and the small number of 
large dust particles can not relieve the tension, and the result is a 
uuicli greater number of nuclei are forced into action. And all these 
nuclei continue to grow so long as the super-saturation is kept up, but 
the larger ones grow most. After the tendency to condense has begun 
to diminish, those particles which have accunuilated least are the first to 
feel the change and cease to grow, while the larger ones are still accumu- 



216 PHENOMENA CONNECTED WITH CLOUDY CONDENSATION. 

latiiig". But after the tendency to eondensatiou has ceased altogether 
the changes in the clouded air are not at an end. The smaller drops 
begin to lose their accumulated moisture, while the larger ones are still 
growing — growing at the expense of the gradually diminishing smaller 
ones. This process goes on till most of the small ones have lost all their 
burden of water, which has been absorbed by the overgrown larger ones : 
and in the end a comparatively small number of drops have absorbed 
t-he moisture which was previously distributed over a vast number of 
particles. The larger particles have, so to speak, eaten up the smaller 
ones. How like the above looks to a page in the " struggle for exist- 
ence" in the animal or vegetable world! 

Color pho) omen a in steam jets. — Steam escaping into the atmosphere 
has been observed on a few occasions to have the power of absorbing 
certain of the rays of light, and causing the sun, when seen through 
it, to look "blue" or ''green." Principal Forbes observed colors in the 
steam escaping from a safety valve. Mr. Lockyer* states that, when 
on Windermere, he saw the sun of a vivid green, through the steam of 
a little paddle boat. I believe a few others have seen this phenome- 
non under similar conditions, but so far as I am aware no one has fol- 
lowed out the suggestion and "investigated the manner in which the 
color is produced. 

Mr. Bidwell, in his experiments on the electrification of steam jets, 
studied the action of the jet on light by casting the shadow of the jet 
on a white screen, using for illumination the lime light. He found that 
the shadow of the ordinary jet — that is. the light transmitted by the 
jet — was nearly colorless, but that when it was electrified the shadow 
became of a dark orange-brown color. 

The color of the " green sun " seen through steam has been attrib- 
uted to the absorption of l)oth ends of the spectrum ])y the aqueous 
vapor. This explaiuition is obviously not the correct one, as it will be 
found that a moderate length of steam has no percei)tible selective 
absorption. Through a length of even 1 meter of steam white ol)jects 
are not colored, and we shall presently see that the coloring dejiends 
not on the vapor, but on some action of the small drops of water in the 
condensing steam. 

For the purpose of studying the color plienomeiia of steam jets 1 have 
found it to be a great advantage to snrrouiul the jet by solid walls. 
When a jet condenses under ordinary conditions, the constitution of 
the jet rapidly changes in its passage away from tlie nozzle, owing to 
the air mixing with it; and it has been found tliat by inclosing tlie jet 
in a tube, after a certain amount of air has been mixed with tlie steam, 
that the conditions can be kept fairlv constant for some length of time, 
and the color i^henomena taking place can therefore be more easily 
studied under these conditions. The tube used for this purpose need 



Xiilure, .Imic. (i, 1878: vol. xviii, p. 1.55. 



PHENOMENA CONNECTED WITH CLOUDY CONDENSATION, 217 

not be of any special size. For a iet from a nozzle of 1 millimeter bore 
a tube of 7 or 8 centimeters diameter and abont half a meter Ion"- does 
very well, but a smaller and shorter tube nuiy be used. With the 
larger size of tube it may be necessary to check the current through it. 
Tliis is best done by ]daring a piece of glass near the exit end of the 
tube, the opening between the glass and the end of the tube being reg- 
ulated to tlie required amount by observation. When a small jet of 
steam is used with the large tube open at both ends too much air is 
drawn in and the effect is nmch the same as if no tube were used. The 
end of the tube has, therefore, to be closed to a certain extent, to pro- 
duce the color phenomena. But when high-pressed steam is used, no 
check on the circulation through the tube is necessary. The steam 
nozzle should be placed outside the tube and a little to one side, so that 
the eye can be brought into a line with the axis of the tube and a clear 
field of view obtained while the jet inlays into the open end of the tube. 
This is an experiment which well repays the trouble of making it. 
When the amount of steam, dust, and other conditions are properly 
proportioned, the colors seen are very beautiful. With ordinary con- 
densation the color varies from a fine green to lovely blues of different 
depths. The pale blues equal any sky blue, while the deeper blues are 
finer than the dark blues seen in the sky, as they have none of the cold 
hardness of the dark sky blues, but have a peculiar softness and full- 
ness of color. 

Suppose now the tube is fitted up pointing to a clouded sky, or 
other source of light, and that the steam jet, under slight pressure, is 
blowing through it. If tlie exit end of the tube be open we shall see 
very little color, and what is seen is only near the origin of the jet. If 
now we partially close the end of the tube with the glass plate, to pre- 
vent the jet drawing in so much air, we shall find that color begins to 
appear, and that Avhen the plate is properly adjusted the tube looks as 
if tilled with a transparent colored gas. Tlie first decided color to 
ai)pear is generally green, though I think I have frequently seen a pale 
crimson before the green was visible. If circulation be checked still 
further, the color will change to blue of a greater or less depth, accord- 
ing to the conditions. 

The above are the effects which may be looked for when the conden- 
sation of the jet is ordinary; but suppose it be now caused to change 
to the dense form, then the color seen through the tube also changes. 
If, when the jet is condensing in the ordinary way, and the transmitted 
liglit is green, we cause the condensation to cliange to dense, then the 
color also changes and becomes deep bhie, or, if the ordinary conden- 
sation gave blue, the color changes, when the jet is dense, to a dark 
yellowish-brown. But between the blue and the yellow there is always 
an intermediate stage when . all color disappears and the light is sim- 
ply very much darkened. The most common effect of the change of 
the condensation from ordinary to dense is for the transmitted light to 



218 PHENOMENA CONNECTED WITH CLOUDY CONDENSATION. 

cbauge from blue to a yellowish color, and it does not matter liow the 
change in the condensation is effected; the color always changes in the 
same way. We can therefore canse the color in the tube to change 
by electrifying the jet, by a supply of cold air, by a supply of the prod- 
ucts of combustion, by increasing the pressure of the steam, and by 
placing an obstruction in front of the nozzle. When any of these, 
either separately or combined, comes into action, the change is always 
in the same direction, and if the color was blue it changes to yellow. 

It may be as well to note here that the yellows produced by most 
dense forms of condensation are f;ir from line, and can not be compared 
with the blues. The yellows are not at all unlike the colors occasion- 
ally seen through smoke or in a thunder cloud. Though this is the 
case with the dense condensation produced by most of the causes, yet 
a very line yellow is obtained when high-iiressure steam is used. 

It has been suggested that, because an electrified jet causes the light 
transmitted through it to be colored of a dark yellow-brown, and as the 
color seen in thunder clouds is similar, that, therefore, the lurid color of 
thunder clouds is due to the electrification. From what is stated above 
it will be seen that electricity is only one of a number of influences 
which can change the condensation of the steam jet and make the light 
transmitted through it of a yellow-brown color. Further, there is no 
evidence to show that electricity has any influence of this nature on 
the form of condensation taking place in clouds, and we are hardly 
entitled to expect it to have any such influence, as the conditions under 
which the steam condenses in a jet are very different from those under 
which condensation takes place m clouds; and we have seen that elec- 
tricity has no effect in the nature of the condensation when it takes 
place in a mixture of hot moist air and cold air. There is still another 
fiict which points to the same conclusion. If, in the steam jet, the pro- 
l)ortion of dust, i^ressure, etc., are such as to give an earlier stage than 
the blue, sui)pose the transmitted light be green, then the electrifica- 
tion may not change it to yellow, but may only make it blue. At pres- 
ent it is, therefore, very doubtful whether the electricity in a thunder 
cloud has anything to do with its color. 

Colors observed in cloudy condensation produced by expansion. — Though 
previous experiments had made me well acquainted with certain 
color phenomena, seen when cloudy condensation is produced by the 
expansion of moist air in a receiver, yet I had never observed any 
colors in the light transmitted directly through the clouded air, such 
as are seen in the jet of steam when inclosed in a tube. It seemed 
extremely probable that the reason for this Avould be, that when the 
condensation is produced by expansion the process is slow, and the 
particles will therefore be too few to produce any color effects. In a 
steam jet the expansion, cooling, and condensation, take i^lace very 
rapidly, and for that reason the number of water particles formed is 



PHENOMENA CONNECTED WITH CLOUDY CONDENSATION. 219 

very great. An experiment was, therefore, arranged in which the air 
could be very rapidly exi)anded, so as to produce a high degree of 
super- saturation, which it was ho])ed would cause a great number of 
dust nuclei to become active. To test this idea, all that was necessary 
was that the receiver used for holding the moist air should be much 
smaller than usual in comparison with the capacity of the i)ump, and 
that the light be transmitted through some length of air. The plan 
adopted was to use an air i)ump of ordinary dimensions, and for a 
receiver a metal tube closed with glass ends. The first ai)paratus pre- 
pared for this experiment was found to give satisfactory results, and 
the alterations since made have not been of any great advantage. 

The apparatus consists of a brass tube 2-3 centimeters diameter and 
about half a meter long. It is provided with glass ends, fitted on air- 
tight, and is provided with a bran(;h pipe at each end. One of these 
branch pipes is connected with an air-pumj), and the other has a stop- 
cock fixed to it. This stop-cock is connected with a pipe for bringing' 
to the tube the air to be experimented with. If the tube be mounted 
horizontally, the particles rapidly fall and the phenomena are visible 
only a short time. The tube is therefore best mounted vertically, and 
with a mirror placed at the lower end of the tube to reflect the sky or 
other source of light up through the tube to the eye of the observer. 

The air-pump used is a single cylinder instrument of 3-17 centimeters 
diameter and 19-3 centimeters stroke, so that its capacity is about three- 
quarters that of the tube receiver. If we take the instrument outside 
the house and make one or two strokes of the i)unip to fill the receiver 
with air of the place, then close the stop-cock, and make a rai)id stroke 
with the pump, little effect is produced on the light transmitted through 
the tube. But if we take the instrument into a room where gas has 
been burning, so that the air is full of dust i)articles, and re])eat the 
experiment, very beautiful colors are seen on looking through the tube 
when the air is expanded. Or better still, if we collect the gases rising 
from a small flame and draw them into the tube, the result is a display 
of an exceedingly lovely series of colors, full, deep, and soft, in some 
respects reminding one of iDolarization colors. As in the steam jet, the 
blues are the finest, and the tube looks, at times, as if filled with a 
solution of Prussian blue. The colors produced in this way are more 
uniform and equal in all parts than those seen in the steam jet, unless 
when the jet is very carefully adjusted ; the yellows are also much finer, 
and the colors are more varied than those seen in the steam jet. 

There is however one most disappointing thing connected with these 
colors produced by expansion ; they are very fleeting. Their full beauty 
lasts but a second or two and they soon fade away, the color growing 
dimmer and feebler every moment. This is owing to the difterentiatiou 
which takes place in the particles forming the cloudy condensation. As 
has been already explained, the small drops rapidly diminish in size 
while the large ones increase, and as in these experiments the drops 



220 PHENOMENA CONNECTED WITH CLOUDY CONDENSATION. 

are very close to each other these changes take place the more rapidly. 
These changes are also taking i)Iace in the steam jet, bnt owing to the 
constant supply of new drops the ohler ones are swept away before the 
change is observed. The following experiment will however show that 
these changes are taldng place in the steam Jet also. If, while the jet 
is condensing and the transmitted light is yellow, we imprison some of 
the jet by closing both ends of the tube, we shall hnd in an extremely 
short time that the color will change to bhie, after wliich it will fade, 
as the drops increase still further in size, and fall. In this experiment 
we have a proof of the statement that when the jet is electrified the 
drops are smaller than when not electrified, and not larger, as has been 
supposed. As this experiment shows, if we begin with drops transmit- 
ting yellow light, as the drops diminish in numbers and increase in size 
the transmitted light changes to blue. 

The conditions of the experiments for i)rodnciug color by cloudy 
condensation, produced by expansion, have been varied in a number 
of ways. After ihe air has been cooled by the expansion, the layer of 
cloudy air in contact with the walls of the tube rapidly acquires heat 
from the metal, and the rise in temperature quickly evaporates the 
cloudy particles and causes a clear space all round next the walls, so 
limiting the color to the center of the tube. The receiver was there- 
fore increased in diameter to get rid of the disturbing effects of the heat- 
ing of the air on the walls of the tube, so as to have a larger mass of air 
beyond this influence; but no decided advantage has been obtained. 
It was afterwards found that the difficulty of studying these color 
eft'ects in small tubes can be easily overcome by wetting the inside of 
the tube. With this precaution the air next the walls is kept saturated 
and the temperature of the wall is lowered by the heat given off to 
evaporate the water, with the result that the color is the same all over 
the field and close up to the walls. 

Large tubes might be used for showing these color phenomena to an 
audience, a parallel beam of light being sent through them, which 
would become colored when the dusty air iu them was expanded. One 
large tube tried has a diameter of 7 centimeters and is 50 centimeters 
long. With a receiver of that capacity it would behoj)eless to attempt 
to i)roduce any color effects witli an ordinary air-pump alone; a vacuum 
receiver has, therefore, been added to the apparatus. This receiver is 
made of metal; it is lo centimeters diameter and 60 centimeters long, 
with round ends. There are two tubes attached to it, one for connect- 
ing it with the air-pump, and the other is provided with a. stop-cock, to 
wliich a tube is attached, by which it is connected with the experi- 
mental receiver. The stop-cock is closed, and the pump worked till 
most of the air is taken out of the receiver; and when it is desired to 
expand the air in the experimental tube the stop-cock is opened, when 
a violent rush of air takes place, and the pressure is rai)idly lowered in 
the experimental receiver and a dense color-producing form of cloud- 
ing is obtained.

The conditions causing the different colors. — For studying the coudi- 
tioDS which give rise to the different colors seen in these tubes, tlie air 
pump and the small tube will be found to be the most suitable. Sup- 
posing these to be fitted up, the following will show how the colors 
change with the conditions: 

First, the effect of the degree of saturation of the air. If the air be 
dry the colors are not good, and some degree of expansion requires to 
be made before any effect whatever is produced on the air; and when 
the colors do ai^pear, it is only in the center of the tube that they are 
seen, the space all round next the walls being free from condensed par- 
ticles. As the humidity is increased, this unclouded space near the 
sides of the tube gradually diminislies. The colors are therefore best 
studied when the air is saturated and the inside of the tube wet. When 
this is done the colors extend to the wall and completely hll the tube. 

Second, the effect of the number of dust particles in the air. If we 
use the ordinary outside air, the colors are very faint or invisible. Sui> 
pose some slight color is visible, then it will be found that a very slight 
expansion, say one-fifth of a stroke of the pump, will give a pale blue, 
and if the exijansion be increased the color will change. If now we 
use air from a room where gas is l)urning, and fill the tube with it, we 
shall now, on expansion, get a much deeper blue, and it will be observed 
that a greater expansion must now be made to get the best blue, and 
before the color begins to change. If we alter the conditions still fur- 
ther, and fill the tube Avith air in winch is mixed a good deal of the 
products of combustion, we shall find that the condensation is now so 
dense that we can scarcely see through the tube; but it will be noticed 
that the color is a very deep blue, and that a full stroke of the ])ump 
was necessary to produce this deep blue, but in this case no change of 
color was produced with that large degree of expansion. 

These experiments show that, with few dust particles, a slight exi)an- 
sion will produce the best blue, and that as the number of i)articles 
increases, the amount of expansion necessary to produce the best blue 
also requires to be increased, the depth of color increasing with ttie 
increase in the number of dust particles. The explanation of the difier- 
ences here is very simple. With few particles a very slight expansion 
will deposit enough moisture to make the small number of drops of the 
size sufficient to give the best blue color ; but, as the number of particles 
is increased, more moisture must be deposited before the increased 
number of drops are made large enough to give a full blue; hence, 
with a larger number of particles a greater expansion is necessary to 
produce this effect. 

Third, the effect of the size of the condensed particles. As has 
been stated, a slight expansion produces a blue color if the number of 
particles be small, and if the expansion be increased after the blue is 
produced, the color changes; and we shall now describe the successive 
colors which appear as the degree of expansion is increased, that is, 



222 PHENOMENA CONNECTED WITH CLOUDY CONDENSATION. 

as tlie size of the water i-articles is increased. When the expansion 
begins, blue is the first distinct color to appear, but very pale yellow 
and slightly reddish colors have been noticed before the expansion was 
sufticient to produce the blue. These reddish colors can be seen very 
distinctly when we use an excessively great number of particles, and 
they are best seen with gaslight. These reddish colors imperceptibly 
change into blue as tlie expansion is increased, and the blue in turn 
changes by minute degrees into green with further expansion, and the 
green in turn changes to yellow; then a brownish color appears, which 
changes to a somewhat mixed purple; then the blue returns again, to be 
followed by green and yellow, as the expansion is still further increased. 
It is not easy to get this sequence of colors carried so far. Sometimes 
one stroke of the pump only carries the color on to yellow; sometimes 
it may go to the second blue or green, but less frequently to the second 
yellow. The final color depends on the number of particles present. 
It is necessary to have a good many drops, so that the color may be 
distinct, and yet not too many or the expansion may not be sufficient 
to grow the particles large enough to give the second series of colors. 
It is found that a high expansion, produced by two or more strokes of 
the pump, does not give satisfactory results. 

We have seen that by increasing the number of dust particles the 
depth of color was increased; it therefore seemed possible that these 
color phenomena might be made visible in even a short column of air, 
and that they might be shown by means of ordinary glass tlasks, The 
following experiment was, therefore, arranged : A tiask, about 18 cen- 
timeters diameter, was fitted with an India-rubber stopi)er, tlu'ough 
which passed two tubes. One tube was connected with a metal vac- 
uum receiver already described, the other had a stop-cock attached to 
it. The stop-cock was connected with a long metal pipe which led to a 
wide tube placed over a snuill flame. Air charged with the products 
of combustion was drawn into the flask through this pipe; when suffi- 
cient impure air was drawn into the flask, the stop-cock was closed; 
when the air in the flask was now suddenly expanded, it looked as if it 
had been tilled with a transparent blue gas. The color, when held 
against a white cloud, was almost exactly the same as that of the blue 
sky. The color in the flask faded rapidly, as in the experiments with 
the tube. The particles being very closely packed in most of these 
experiments the subsequent change is all the more rapid. 

Effect of temperature. — To observe the eflect of temperature on these 
color iflienomena, another tube was prepared, with glass ends, and 
jacketed, vso that the air in it might be heated or cooled to any desired 
temperature. Theresult was very much what might have been expected ; 
at the difl'erent temperatures all thecolorsmade their appearance in the 
usual order, but there was a considerable difterem-e in the amount of ex- 
pansion required to produce a given color with change of temperature. 



PHENOMENA CONNECTED WITH CLOUDY CONDENSATION. 223 

At a high temperature each of the colors ap^jeared with a less expausion 
thau when the teiiiperature was low. lu making; these tests the num- 
ber of dust particles in the air must be kept as constant as possible. 
For this purpose windows and doors should be kept closed for some- 
time before beginning, and the experiments should be repeated without 
change of conditions. When the air was cooled to about 35°, it took 
two strokes of the pump to develop a full blue, and three strokes made 
it oidy green. At a temperature little over 50^, two strokes made it 
green, wliile-if the air was heated to about 80°, two strokes sent it past 
blue and green and on to yellow, and less than one stroke made it full 
blue. The ditt'erences are due to more vapor being present and being 
coiulensed, with the same amount of expansion, when the air is hot 
than when it is cold. It sliould be stated that in all cases the air was 
saturated, the inside of the tube being wet. 

The tube was also cooled down to (P F., but no difference was observed 
in the nature of the phenomena. The particles at that temperature 
seemed to be still in the liquid form. 

LUjht transmitted. — The light transmitted directly through the cloudy 
condensation has been examined by means of a small spectroscope. 
One of thetubes was mounted vertically, and amirror placed at the lower 
end; the spectroscope was temporarily mounted over the upper end of 
tlie tube; a small mirror was placed between the spectroscope and the 
glass end of the tube. This small mirror covered halt the tield of the 
spectroscope, and retlected light from the same source as that reflected 
by the mirror at the lower end of the tube, so that one half of the field 
gave the spectrum of the light, and the other half the light after i)assing 
through the clouded condensation. The conditionsintheexperimentare 
too fleeting for satisfactory observation. The only thing noticed was a 
darkening of the Mhole spectrum, with a greater absor})tion at certain 
points than at others. When the light was blue, in additiou to tlie gen- 
eral reduction in brightness, the red end was more reduced than any 
other part, and there was also a very marked shortening of the spectrum 
at this end. When the color was yellow the reverse Avas the case. The 
blue was almost entirely cut out, while the yellow was far the brightest 
part of the Sliectruin, 

An examination has also been made of the diffraction colors as seen 
in the halos surrounding bright lights. The most convenient way tried 
of observing these colors was to use an ordinary glass flask of 18 cen- 
timeter diameter, connected with the metal vacuum leceiver, as 
already described. For the source of light, gas may be used, but a 
better result is obtained with the light of the sky. In order to observe 
these colors easily the window should be closed, all but a narrow ver- 
tical strip; and it improves matters to have all surfaces on each side 
of the opening painted black. When the air in the flask is expanded, 



224 PHENOMENA CONNECTED WITH CLOUDY CONDENSATION. 

the vertical bands of ditfractioii colors are distinctly seen on each side 
of the bright light. If now we keep the amount of dust in the air con- 
stant during the experiments, we shall find that, on opening the stop- 
cock to the vacuum receiver very slowly, we will get the u.sual cloudy 
condensation, and that the diffraction colors will be quite distinct. But 
if we repeat the experiment and this time open the stop-cock very sud- 
denly, so as to cause a rapid expansion, the colors will be found to be 
very much improved, being far more brilliant. This is due partly to 
the greater number of particles engaged in producing the effect, but 
chiefly to tlie much more equal size of tlie particles when they are sud- 
denly developed tluin when slowly grown. 

It is found that we must not have too many particles present, or the 
diffraction colors will not be good; their size does not seem to be great 
enough to ])rodiice the phenomena. If, for instance, in place of using 
the air of the room, we take into the flask air coming from a small 
flame, the color phenomena in the flask all change; when there were 
few particles the light transmitted directly through them has so little 
color it is not noticed, while the diffraction colors are tine; but with 
many particles the direct light becomes colored, while the diffraction 
colors are softened and have lost much of their brilliancy. When the 
particles are sufllciently numerous to cause the directly transmitted 
light to be of a thin blue, the dift'raction color next the blue light is 
nearly the complementary yellow, and this yellow light extends to near 
the limits of the flask. If more particles be added, the color of the 
transmitted light becomes deeper blue, but it is difticult now to say 
what the diffraction colors are. The convection currents in the flask 
now make themselves visible; the air on each side of the blue direct 
light is suffused with a variety of colors, not now in regular vertical 
bands, but irregularly distributed and in movement through the flask. 

Cause of the color. — These experiments show that the color produced 
by the small drops of water depends on the size of the drops, and the 
depth of color in their number. But it is not so easy to follow the man 
uer in which the drops iDroduce the color. If we take the siniplest case, 
we can easily see how part at least of the cohn^ is produced. In the 
steam jet condensing dense, and coloring the transmitted light yellow, 
part of the effect is no doubt due to some of the particles in that form 
of condensation being so small that they reflect and scatter the shorter 
waves of light, while they allow the longer ones to pass through. The 
color in this case is partly caused in the same way as the yellow pro- 
tduced by small particles suspended in liquids, as in Brack's experiment 
with mastic, or as when silver chloride is formed from a solution of the 
nitrate. The light reflected by the liquids in these experiments is of a 
bluish tint, complementary to the yellow light transmitted by them, 
and this blue light is polarized. It has been found that when the steam 
jet is of a good yellow by transmitted light, it reflects a good deal of st/ 



PHENOMENA CONNECTED WITH CLOUDY CONDENSATION. 225 

bluish light; and, further, this blue light is polarized ni the same way 
as the light from the small particles in the experiments with li([uids. 

While this explanation helps us so fiir to understand the manner in 
which the yellow light is produced in steam jets, yet it fails to explain 
the succession of colors seen in the expansion experiments, where blue 
tirst appears, then green and yellow; and when the expansion is still 
further increased, the blue again returns to give place to a second green 
and yellow. The most probable explanation of these color phenomena 
is that they are produced in the same way as the colors in plates, some- 
what after the manner jSTewton thought the color of the sky was pro- 
duced. The order of succession of the colors in thin plates is the same 
as in these condensation i^henomena. As no white ibllows the first 
blue, it seems probable that the first spectrum, or order of colors, is 
not observed; that the two generally seen are the second and third. 

Some experiments were made with a glass tube receiver, in place of 
the metal one, to see if there were any colored light reflected in these 
expansion experiments of the same kind as is seen under certain con- 
ditions in a steam jet; but no such colors have been observed. It is 
possible they may be present; Init, owing to the great amount of white 
light reflected by the larger particles, any colored reflected light that 
may be present is masked. 

Green sun. — On a few occasions the sun has been observed to be of a 
decidedly greenish color, while on other occasions it has appeared blue. 
The experiments which have been described in this paper seem to offer 
an explanation of this phenomenon. For a number of days in the begin- 
ning of September, 18S3, the sun was seen of a decidedly blue or green 
color in India, Trinidad, and other places. Most of the observers who 
ImAC written on the subject have linked tliis phenomenon with the erup- 
tion of Krakatao, which took place just before the days on wliich the 
green or blue sun was seen. From the light thrown on the subject by 
these experiments, we see that an eruption, such as that of Krakatao, 
would throw into the atmosphere a supply of the very materials neces- 
sary for producing a green sun by means of small drops of water, as it 
would send into the atmosphere an immense quantity of aqueous vapor 
and an enormous amount of hue dust — a combination the most favor- 
able possible for producing a great number of minute drops of water. 

Prof. C. Michie Smith observed the green sun in India, and he says: 

" The main features of the spectrum taken on the sun when green 
were : 

''1. A very strong general absorption in the red end. 

*' 2. A great development of the rain-bauds and of all other lines that 
are ascribed to the i)resence of water vapor in the atmosphere."* 

It is evident, therefore, that one of the materials necessary for pro- 
ducing this peculiar absorption by means of water drops was present 
in an unusual amount in the atmosphere at the time ; and it also

226 PHENOMENA (CONNECTED WITH CLOUDY CONDENSATION. 

appears that a tine form of condeiisatiou had taken phice, as Mr. W. R. 
Manley states* that there was at the time a sort of haze all over the 
sky, and from the letters of different observers this haze seems always 
to have accompanied the great sun. 

One almost wonders that a blue or green sun is not oftener seen, as 
there are often present all the materials necessary for producing these 
colors in the atmosphere. On a few occasions I have observed the sun 
to be of a silvery whiteness, when the vapor in the upper air was begin- 
ning to condense, and the sky was covered with a thin filmy cloud. It 
IS liowever possible that this slightly bluish tint may have been due 
to the sun being seen more in its natural color than usualj thatis, made 
much less yellow by our atmosphere than it generally is. There seems 
to be something preventing the dust and the vapor in our atmosphere 
acting under ordinary conditions in such a way as to color the sun blue 
or green. Perhai)S it may be the tendency the particles have to dif- 
ferentiation. This tendency, we have seen from the experiments, 
rapidly destroys all color effects, and from this we might suppose it 
would be impossible that the colors if produced by Avater drops could 
remain in nature visible for so long a time as they did. But it must be 
remembered that the particles in the experimental vessels are extremely 
close together, and the vapor exchanges can therefore take place (juickly. 
If however the drops Avere widely separated, the exchanges would 
take place slowly. For instance, if the drops in 1 centimeter were 
separated so as to form a column 1 mile long, with a section of 1 Sipiare 
centimeter, we should have the same amount of color in 17 miles that 
we had in the 17 centimeters of air in the flask, and the particles would 
be so far apart that dififerentiation Avould then take place extremely 
slowly. lUit further, if the supply of dust and vapor Avere constantly 
kept up by the volcano, the color phenomena would continue for the 
same reason that they continue in a steam jet, namely, by the tlrops 
being constantly renewed. 

A neic instruinent for tcsthuj the amount of dust in the air. — As 
this investigation progressed it became evident that these color phe- 
nomena placed in our hands an easy and simple way of estimating, 
in a rough way, the number of dust i)articles in the atmosphere of our 
rooms, Avliich might be useful for sanitary i)urposes. An instrument 
Avas therefore constructed to see how far the idea could be practically 
carried out. This new instrument Ave intend to call a Koniscope. In 
its present form this instrument consists of an air-pump and a metal 
tube with glass ends, which we shall call the test-tube. The capacity 
of the pump should be from half to three-quarters the capacity of the 
test-tube. Kear one end of the test-tube is a passage by which it com- 
municates with the air-pump, and near the other end is attached a 
stop-cock for admitting the air to be tested. The test-tube and air- 
pump may be attached parallel to each other, and held vertically Avhen 

"Nature, Oct. 11, 1883; vol. xxviii, p. 576.

observing;'. If this arrangement be adopted, ii mirror must be attached 
to the lower end of the tube. In practice it is found to be more con- 
venient to omit tlie mirror, and observe with tlie tube in any position, 
simply directing- it to any suitable light. When this arrangement is 
used, the pump, for convenience of working, should be attached at 
right angles to the test-tube. It is fonnd tluit any want of unilormity 
in the color of the field produced by the air heated on the sides of the 
tube can l)e greatly obviated by lining the inside of the tube with a 
non-conducting substance and keeping it wet. Blotting-paper is 
found to do very well, as it holds plenty of water for saturating the 
air and is a fair non-conductor. When the inside of the tube is lined 
with it, the field of color is fairly uniform, owing to the cooling of the 
sides by the evaporation when the air enters and when expansion is 
made. 

For ilhimination no doubt daylight is the best when it can be 
obtained, as gas-light is so deficient in blue rays that color is not well 
observed. For convenience of observation, it is found to be best to 
close the far end of the tube with ground glass, and when working 
with artificial light ground glass must be used. 

I have made a i'ew tests with an instrument of this kind, and find it 
very easily worked, and, for my practical i^urposes, it is sufficiently 
accurate. It can not of course compare with the dust counter for 
accuracy; but, on the other hand, it is a nuich less expensive instru- 
ment, and tests can be made far more easily wuth it, aiul little special 
knowledge is required. If we wish to get actual figures for the 
amounts of dust indicated by this instrument, then it must be gradu- 
ated by a dust counter. The indications at best, however, will only 
be very rough approximations to the numbers. There are three ways 
in which we might graduate this instrument. We might, for instance, 
make one full stroke of the pump and note the color which appeared. 
This color would indicate the nujuber of particles. For instance, if 
there are few particles, one stroke will make the light first blue, then 
green, then yellow, and then a second blue and green, and finishing 
with yellow. But if there are a good many particles present, the same 
amount of expansion will only make the first series of colors to appear; 
and if a great many particles are present, the one stroke will not give 
the whole of the first series of colors, but may stop at the blue. If the 
temi)erature of the air were always the same this method might be 
adopted; but, as we have seen, an allowance w^ould be required to be 
made for temperature, as, with a high temperature, the same degree of 
exi)ansion carries the color further up the series. 

Another method of graduating might be to note the amount of expan- 
sion necessary to give any particular color, say, to give the best blue. 
With few particles a slight expansion gives the blue, while with many 
particles a much greater exi)ausion is necessary. But here again the 
efiect of temperature comes in. Temperature observations would there- 



228 PHENOMENA CONNECTED V/ITH CLOUDY CONDENSATION. 

fore require to be taken, aud a correction made wliicli it niij^lit be 
difficult to carry out in practice. 

At present the best plan of graduating seems to be to note the depth 
of the blue produced, regardless of the amount of expansion required 
to give it, and use only this quantity as an index. With few particles 
the color is pale, and as the particles increase in number the color 
increases in depth. Perhaps some addition might be made to the 
instrument for estimating more accurately the depth of color than can 
be done mentally. This might be done either by means of colored 
glasses of different depths for comparison, or in some other Avay. 

A few comparative observations have been made with the Jxoni.scopc 
and the dust-counter in the impure air of a room, AVhile the number 
of particles was counted by means of the dust-counter, the depth of blue 
given by the loniscope was noted. A metal tube was fitted u}) verti- 
cally in the room in such a way that it could be raised to any desired 
height into the impure air near the ceiling, so that su])plies of air of dif- 
ferent degrees of impurity might be obtained. To produce the inq)urity 
the gas was lit and kept burning during the experiments. The air was 
drawn down through the pipe by means of the air pump of the T^oni- 
sco_[)e, ami it passed through the measuring apparatus of the dust- 
counter on its way to the l-onlscopr. The indications of the two instru- 
ments were taken, and are entered in the following table:

It is probable that the higher numbers are too low, as the measure of 
the dust-counter has a. cai)acity of only 10 cubic millimeters. With so 
small a measure it is probable that a good many of the particles are 
lost. When making a sanitary ins])cction, the air outside, or wherever 
the supi)ly was drawn from, would be tested first, and the depth of color 
which it gave would be noted. Any increase from that depth would 
indicate that the air was being jiolluted, and the amount of increase in 
the depth of color would indicate the amount of increase of pollution 
Slight color can be traced, though the number of particles be less than 
80,000 per cubic centimeter, but the color is not very decided, the con- 
densation producing principally a darkening effect. It should be noted 
that the above table refers to a koniscope with a test tube 50 centi- 
meters long. An instrument with a tube 1 meter long would be doubly 
sensitive and would show color with fewer particles.

It is tlionght that the Iconiscope will be useful for sanitary inspec- 
tors for investigating' questions of ventilation in rooms lighted with gas 
and for other pur[)oses. As an illustration of what this instrunient can 
tell us, the following ex[>erinient may be given. It shows us how we 
ean trace by means of it the pollution taking place in our rooms by 
open tiauies. The room in wbich the tests were made is 24 x 17 x 13 
feet. The object of the tests was to see if the Iconiscope could tell us 
anything definite about the degree of pollution at the different parts of 
the room, and also about the rate at wliieli it was increasing. Fortius 
l)urpose a small tube was arranged so that one end of it could be raised 
to the ceiling or into the air of any part of the room from which it was 
desired to take the air; the other end of the tube was connected with 
the yoniscope. 

The first thing to be done was to examine the air of the room before 
lighting the gas and beginning the tests. On doing this the air at the 
level of the observer gave a very faint color, scarcely perceptible; air 
drawn froniAvitliin 3 inches of the ceiling gave equally little color, and 
the air inside the room gave the same color as the air outside. The 
ui)per end of the tube connected with the Iconiscope was then raised to 
within 3 incliee of the ceiling, near one end of the room, and the koni- 
scope left attached to the lower end. Three jets of gas were now lit in 
the center of the room and observations at once begun with the l-oni- 
Hcope. Within thirty-five seconds of striking the match to light the 
gas the products of combustion had extended to the end of the room; 
this was indicated by the color in the Iconiscope suddenly becoming of 
a deep blue. In four minutes the deep blue producing air was got at 
a distance of 2 feet from the ceiling. In ten minutes there was strong- 
evidence of the pollution all through the room. It was strongly indi- 
cated near the windows, owing to the down current of cold air on the 
glass. Tills impure down current could be traced to the floor, and 
onwards to the fire-place; while a pure current could be traced from the 
floor to the lire-place. In thirty minutes the impurity at 9 feet from the 
floor was very great, the color being a deep blue. 

The wide range of the indications of the Iconiscope^ from pure white 
to nearly black-blue, makes the estimates of the impurity very easily 
taken with it; and, as there are few parts to get out of ordei-, it is 
hoped it may come into general use for sanitaxy work. 

The few experiments I have nmde with this instrument have clearly 
]»ointed out that a window is not an unalloyed blessing as regards the 
purity of the air in our rooms, however much we may have been in the 
habit of thinking otherwise. In all cases it has been found that in 
rooms where gas is burning the air near the window is very impure. 
This impure down current of air near the window has been traced by 
the Iconiscope in all rooms tested. The impurity is caused by the cold 
air on the window sinking and drawing down the impure air near the 
ceiling, and this impure air is mixed with the lower air which we are 



230 PHENOMENA CONNECTED WITH CLOUDY CONDENSATION. 

breathing. This effect is, of course, greatest when the windows are 
unprotected by blinds, shutters, or curtains. It is evident that, tliough 
a window may snpply pure air when it is open, it yet does nuicli harm 
when closed by bringing down the impure air, which, if undisturbed, 
would have a less injurious effect. 

It is to be regretted that this investigation does not promise to yield 
mucli of ])ractical valne; nevertheless, as we cultivate not only frnits 
but Howers, so, for the same reason that we cultivate the latter, it is 
thought that these exj)eriments will repay the attention of physicists. 
The colors produced by such simi)le materials as a little dust and a 
little vapor are as beautiful as anything seen in nature, and well rci)ay 
the trouble of re-i»roducing them. 



ON CHEMICAL ENERGY.* 



By Dr. W. Ostwald, 

Of the Universitjj of Leipzig. 



During- the scieiitilic developiiR'iit of chemistry tho liypotlieses wbich 
have served as a primary toundation have always been borrowed from 
a prominent sister seience. At the time of the most rapid development 
of mechanics as founded by Galileo and advanced by his pupils and 
successors, chemistry was mechanical; the solvent action of acids upon 
metals was explained by assuming' that the former possessed points and 
edges by means of which they disintegrated the latter; bodies which 
combine were supposed to have hooks by means of which they attached 
themselves to each other. When Newton based his theory of astro- 
nomical movements upon the assumption of a force acting inversely as 
the S(piare of the distance, chemistry shortly appropriated this idea, 
and traced all processes to the attraction and repulsion of particles. It 
is therefore not surprising that the phenomena of the Voltaic pile 
(which later proved to be so intimately connected with chemical changes) 
were at once utilized to serve as a foundation for a theory of chemical 
processes. These theories, especially that of Berzelius, have prevailed 
a long time, but finally have proved themselves just as insufficient to 
represent chemical phenomena as the mechanical and the attraction 
theory. 

Thus the theory of chemical combinations is to-day a strange and 
contradictory conglomerate of the fossil constituents of the earlier 
theories. The rudiments of the theory of attractions still play the most 
important role, while there is also considerable discussion about posi- 
tive and negative elements, 1. e., the residues of the electro-chemical 
theory, and in most recent times we see the long-forgotten mechanical 
conception again stejiping to the front in stereo-chemistry and being 
accepted by many as a new step in the progress of science. 

In such times it is of great value, on the one hand, to recall the his- 
torical development and the evanescence of theories; on the other hand 
to find in the older theories that which is useful and correct, so as to 
obtain sound building material for a new theory.

232 ON CHEMICAL ENERGY. 

Especially are we forced to couelude, from the fate of x>ast tlieorictS, 
that chemical phenomena must be explained by their own inter-relations; 
that is, must be logically arranged. The use of analogies from other 
fields of natural science has indeed often led to suppositions which for 
the moment vseemed satisfactory; on trial, liowever, such analogies have 
always proved themselves more a drawback than a help, since they 
hindered the unbiased comprehension of facts, and they could not (or 
will not in the future) be cast aside without a great struggle and con- 
siderable sacrifice of time and labor. 

It is scarcely needful at present to prove that the several provinces 
of quantitative science ]iossess in a single conception both the principle 
which distinguishes them and that common principle which unites them, 
namely, the conception of energy. Mechanical energy is distinct from 
thermal. Similarly, chemical energy is distinct from electrical; and in 
each province progress can only be made by studying the various prop- 
erties which the form of energy under examination possesses. 

At the same time, however, the laws which determine the correla- 
tion and conservation of energy constitute the only bond which unites 
the various fields. If heat could not be changed into mechanical energy 
and chemical into electrical, these provinces would stand distinct and 
isolated from each other; and neither thermo-dynamics nor electro- 
chemistry would be possible. This shows that progress in the scien- 
tific conception of chemical i)henomena depends upon primarily deter- 
mining the sevinal pro[)erties of chemical energy as such, and then its 
relation to other forms of energy. This done, we will be able to cope in 
a scientific manner with each chemical process, no matter whether it 
leads to other chemical changes or causes the appearance or destruc- 
tion of other forms of energy. 

The knowledge of the laws of chemical energy is not only scientific- 
ally but also practically of the greatest interest. All energy, which is 
employed in accomplishing the various purposes of industry, is derived 
from chemical sources, the combustion of fuel. Besides, each step that 
we take, every word tliat we speak, in fact every thought formulated 
by our brain, leads to sources of chemical energy; animals and plants 
throughout their whole existence are based primarily upon chemical 
energy and its laws, and the ultimate problems of biology are in every 
respect chemical. 

All forms of energy have this in common, that they may be resolved 
into two factors, both of which have definite properties. 'J'he one, 
which we call intensity, determines whether the energy may remain at 
rest or must undergo an exchange. Thus, for instance, the factor of 
intensity for heat is temperature, since we know that two bodies can be 
at rest with reference to their heat only when their temperatures are 
equal. The second factor we call capacity; it determines how much 
energy at a given intensity is present in the object under consideration. 
With heat, for instance, this is called heat capacity. 



ox CHEMICAL ENERGY. 233 

What now are the factors of chemical energy? If we had a measure 
for its factor of intensity, as the thermometer is a measure of the 
intensity of heat, we wouUl be able to determine for each substance 
Avith reference to another whether it could react with the latter or not? 
just as the thermometer shows us whether or not heat can be trans- 
mitted from one body to another. Our answer is that this question 
has not been completely solved, but that from many phenomena we 
ah^eady possess a chemometer, as we might call the instrument — in 
analogy to the thermometer. 

In order however to be able to explain the theory of the chemome- 
ter, the factors of chemical energy must first be more precisely deter- 
mined. The factor of capacity is in this case most easily discovered. 
The chemical energy which is present under given circumstances is 
proportional to the weight or mass of the .substances involved. Hence 
we sell and buy chemical energy according to weight. This becomes 
more clear from the following consideration: When we buy coal, we do 
not consider the carbcm present, but rather the cheuiical energy, since 
in the use of the fuel we allow the carbon to escape quietl}' through 
the chimney as carbon dioxide, without making any effort to retain it; 
that however which we husband with the greatest care, is the chemi- 
cal energy of the coal, obtained as heat. I have stated with due con- 
sideration that the factor of capacity of chemical energy is proportional 
u) the mass; yet it is not mass, since this conception belongs solely to 
mechanics. It is therefore by no means more correct to say "atomic 
mass" instead of "atomic weight," since in this case the degree of 
chemical capacity is concerned which is proportional to both weight 
and mass, without being one or the other. 

The term " degree of intensity" of chemical energy has something in 
common with the conception which has become familiar in the field of 
chemistry under the term of "chemical affinity," nn)re to denote that 
field in which a more accurate knowledge was especially desirable thaij 
to combine by such a word sufticiently definite ideas. The word was 
there, just as the name of a future street stands on a signboard in the 
outskirts of a city, in a waste field; tents and barracks of the most 
curious kind have been erected from time to time only to be deserted 
again. Only in most recent times solid buildings and i>ermanent set- 
tlements have found a j)lace on this site, and soon a new section of the 
city will be created there, whose importance threatens to throw the 
older portion of the city in the shade. 

J. VVillard Gibbs called the degree of intensity of chemical energy 
the chemical potential; analogous to the degree of intensity of elec- 
trical energy, which is called the electrical potential. So, to avoid the 
vagueness of the term affinity, we will make use of the term chemical 
potential, or in brief, potential. 

IS^ow, it follows from the definition of the degree of intensity, that 
two substances with like potential can not act on each other: and, con- 



234 ON CHEMICAL ENERGY. 

versely, tliat wheu two substances act on each other tlieh' potential 
mast bo difterent. 

That general law whicli can be regarded as expressive of the Second 
Theorem holds also for the chemical potential, namely: Two potentials 
which individually are equal to a third are equal to each other. This 
proposition seems quite self-evident, and therefore equally meaning- . 
less. Yet we can draw from it conclusions tliat are very far reaching. 
It says that two bodies or groups of bodies which are in equilibrium 
with each other, can mutually replace each other at pleasure towards 
a third system in every reaction in which this third system (towards 
which ecpiilibrium has been established) can react. Thus, for example, 
every soluble body can be replaced by its saturated solution, every 
liquor by its saturated vapor, every solid body at its fusing ])oint by the 
melted body withoutcausiugany alteration in tlie equilibrium depending 
upon the former. Among other things this shows that while the heat 
of solution, fusion, and evaporation, change the evolution of heat dur- 
ing a cliemical process, they do not thus affect the equilibrium. The 
thermal theory of affinity, which is even to-day championed by Berthe- 
lot and others, is by this circ-umstauce proved to be quite untenable. 

It is natural in the case of such a far-reaching proposition to require 
proofs. This proof is found in the fact that it is impossible to create a 
peiyotuuni mobile. To have a perpetuum mobile it is not necessary to 
create energy from nothing, but only to transform potential energy into 
kinetic. If it were for instance i)ossil)le to transform the constant heat 
which is })resent in enormous amounts in the ocean into work which 
then could change biick into heat, we would require no more coal to 
propel our steamshi}>s, since all the work which we re(|uired for their 
propulsion would be transformed into heat by friction and could return 
to the ocean in unchanged amounts. Such 'A perpetuum mobile will be 
instantly ))ossible when two substances which individually are in equi- 
librium with a third are not in e(|uilibrium with each other. If we 
assume that a substance .1, when in contact with a large body B (the 
ocean), assumes a temperature which is difterent from that imi)arted to 
a body i>, sinuiltaneously in contact and e(piilibrium with the ocean, 
we w(mld cause a transmission of heat between A and B which would 
be capable of driving a machine. This proof is equally true for every 
other form of Ciiuilibrium and for every form of energy, and thus we 
also prove our chemical proposition. 

When we have thus recognized the conditions under which energy is 
in equilibrium or at rest, we can directly reason that energy can not be 
at rest when its potentials are different. A process must then take 
place by means of which they become equal. This is the most common 
phenomenon with which we are acquainted; everything which takes 
place is based, m the last instance, upon an e(jnalization of energies of 
different potentials. 

Since however energy, as is a fact, has a never-ceasing teudenc3' to 



ON CHEMICAL ENERGY. 235 

equalize itself, the question arises why it has not done so long- ago 
during- the many thousand years which our system of worlds has 
existed. We continually see differences of potential existing in 
nature — compressed air, galvanic elements; all these contain stores of 
energy which are ever ready to act and must therefore be unequal. 
Likewise the fossil fuels and the suli)hides of the metals are able in 
conjunction with the oxygen of the air to bring- forth large amounts of 
energy during their inter action, and can not, therefore, be in eciuilib- 
rium. Aside from the tendency for e(]ualization, which is peculiar 
to energy, other forces are therefore active in nature which hinder or 
detain this, and an accurate understanding- of these natural phenomena 
can only be attained when these opposing and detaining- causes are 
known. 

For mechanical and electrical energy such hindrances can be easily 
created. A spring may be kept wound by a weight; two electrically 
charged bodies, which tend to approach each other, can be kei>t from 
attaining their equilibrium by the dielectric resistance of an interposed 
medium. All these liiudrances however have but this explanation, 
that the differences of energy present are comiicnsated by the use of 
other energies, so that their eipialization is prevented ; at the same time, 
we can prove that, according- to the method employed, large (piantities 
of one form of energy of any magnitude can be compensated by equally 
small quantities of another form of energy, for by means of a small 
switch, enormous currents of electricity can be interrupted and closed 
at will. 

In the case of chemical energy we are however very often unable to 
prove such compensations by the application of other energies. When 
a piece of Avood is exposed to the air, it would be in accordance with the 
general tendency to equalize the energy present, if combustion took 
place and the wood combined with the oxygen of the air. The same 
would apply to organized bodies. Our body consists of combustible 
substances; and, in accordance with tlie chemical affinities present, it 
should combine with the oxygen of the air and burn without cessation. 
Why IS it not consumed? 

If we should attempt to answer this question we should soon become 
entangled in inexplicable contradictions. We can not ask: "Why is 
our body not consumed?" since it does actually burn. It continually 
takes up oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. The same answer 
applies to other chemical phenomena, A stick of sulphur exposed to 
the air seems unchanged, but it is only apparently so. In reality it is 
oxidized; slowly however, and so slowly in fact, tha^ we would not 
notice it in weeks or months. If the process were however continued 
for years or decades of years the oxidation could be measured. The 
rapidity of reaction is clearly proportioned to the surface. If we take 
finely powdered sulphur, Hower or milk of sulphur, whose total surface 
is much greater, we can prove the formation of sulphuric acid in hours 
and days. 



236 ON THEMICAL ENERGV. 

What lias liere been stated for a few cases is a general truth. In 
every case where different substances which could act upon one another 
are in contact without having, practically speaking, any apparent 
action upon each other, we can bring the requirements of the teachings 
of energy into unison with the actual conditions by actually ascribing 
to these substances an action which is, however, s<» slow that it lies 
beyond the possibilities of nieasurenient. 

We have here the means of entering upon one of tiie most important 
and mysterious problems, namely, the search after the chemical activ 
ity of organized bodies, for, as all the activity of organisms depends 
upon changes in their chemical energy, all knowledge in this case 
depends upon a correct elucidation of the character of the chemical 
changes. If we can understand how the chemical processes of com- 
bustion, to which all physiological sources of energy finally lead, can 
be so regulated that they are able at any moment to adapt themselves 
to the ever-changing requirements of the organism, we have taken a 
steji in every respect most important in the knowledge of life. 

Let us take, for instance, a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen. Under 
ordinary circumstances we can preserve this mixture for a long time 
without the formation of a measurable ainount of water. If however 
we place a piece of platinum sponge into it the formation of water 
immediately begins, and it is as suddenly terminated when we remove 
the sponge. The i^latinum sponge has moreover undergone no change 
and is able to exert this action for an unbounded space of time. 

At first it seems as if we had here the first iirojiosition of our later 
natural science, to rudely dispute '' causa arguat effectum,'''' since we 
have here a cause whicli can bring forth extended and large effects at 
pleasure without becoming exhausted. If we ask however Avhat this 
proposition means by cause and effect we find it to be degrees of energy. 
No energy of any kind can be created without the consumption of an 
equal amount of energy, and no difference in tlie potential of energies 
can be called forth without the simultaneous disappearance of equiva- 
lent differences in the potential of other energies. The truth of these 
propositions is not cast in doubt by the experiment with the mixture 
of oxygen and hydrogen, since the heat of combustion remains the 
same both when combination is effected by an electric spark and when 
it is brought about at the ordiiuiry temperature by means of platinum 
sponge. While therefore the law of cause, clothed in the form of a 
principle of energy, regulates the final result of the action in an 
unchangeable manner, the time during which this action takes place 
remains absolutely iiub'pendent of this principle, and we have side by 
side with the absolute necessity of this law of cause, the freedom with 
reference to the time during which it exerts its infiuence. Therefore 
we see that all possible phenomena which, (u^iginating from tlie same 
substances, reach the same jjroducts, arrive at tliese with a very dif- 
ferent rapidity. The object to be arrived at is uncliangeablc; whether 



ON CHEMICAL ENERGY. 237 

it is however to be accomplished in a second or in several thousand 
years is a circumstance over which Ave have full control. 

The name " catalytic bodies" has been given to substances which 
cause chemical reactions without experiencing any change themselves. 
We will now change this definition so as to read thus: Catalytic sub- 
stances are those which modify the rapidity of a definite chemical reac- 
tion without changing their own content of energy. To place a cata- 
lytic substance into the reacting bodies and to remove it requires the- 
oretically no work. This proves that within the strict province of the 
law of energy there still remains room for the greatest variation in the 
temporal extent of the phenomena. 

This peculiar circumstance has its foundation in the fact that in the 
expression of most degrees of energy time is not mentioned, and that 
therefore the eiiuation of energy does not determine the extent of 
time involved in the phenomena. 

One exception is made in the case of kinetic energy, which depends 
upon the rapidity. What has been stated above does not, therefore, 
apply to this form of energy. Upon what the action of catalytic sub- 
stances depends is still a mystery, the solution of which is the more 
difficult, since it can only be explained by means of new principles, 
which are beyond the law of energy. At present we must be satisfied 
with the knowledge that it is a fact and must seek to become acquainted 
with the laws involved. A beginning has already been made; from a 
large number of various investigations it has been found that many 
chemical reactions, which usually take place very slowly, are hastened 
by the presence of free acids; or, to speak in the language of the mod- 
ern theories, by the presence of free hydrogen-ions, and that this action 
is proportional to the concentration of the latter. The greatest variety 
of phenomena have been examined in this respect, partly by me, partly 
by my pupils, and I have as yet found no case where this statement 
did not apply. Free hydrogen-ions are therefore without doubt exceed- 
ingly active catalysators of a general character. 

At the same time numberless specific catalysators exist which act 
only upon certain phenomena. These are the ferments organized and 
unorganized. These also are unable to do more than to change the 
rapidity of certain reactions in one or the other respect, and all 
attempts to explain their action must be based upon this their sole 
property. The laws which they ol)ey appear to be of an extremely com- 
plicated nature, especially with the more complex constituted ferments. 
This is probably due to the fact that they undergo a change themselves 
while infiueucing a certain chemical reaction. 

I need not show in an extended manner that the wonderful action of 
living organisms can be traced to a regular impulse upon the chemical 
processes which take place among their constituents in accordance with 
general chemical laws, and that these again may be traced to the 
action of catalytic substances, If the rapidity of reactiou in a muscltj 



238 ON CHEMICAL ENERGY. 

is hastened which may be regulatecl from a central organ, this muscle 
will accomplish a corresponding- amount of work. When however the 
supply of energy is exhausted, the influence of a catalystor can uot 
force it to any further manifestations. The same is true for all other 
activities of organisms. 

I can uot assume to have made clear the mystery of life in the previ- 
ous pages, but I believe that I have solved a more apparent problem, 
namely to show that the scieuce which is seemingly abstract and for- 
eign to actual life, and which has developed during the last years 
under the name physical chemistry, is a science of the highest real 
imijortauce. If it will be possible for this scieuce to throw light upon 
that most difficult of all the problems of nature, the mystery of life, how 
much easier will it be to exi)lain by means of the new i)rinciples the by 
far much easier problems of technical chemistry which have not been 
solved so far. It is (juite uatural and self-implied, but we must never- 
theless repeat again and again that ''The more i)erfect the theoretical 
evolution of the sciences becomes, the greater will be the scope of their 
explanations and at the same time the greater their practical impor- 
tance."

THE AMERICAN CHEMIST.* 



By I'rof. G. C. Caldwell. 



I have chosen for the subject of my address as retiring president of 
this society, one that seems appropriate to this occasion of the tirst 
gathering of a representation of American cliemists on a fully organ- 
ized basis as an American Chemical Society. My topic is the "Ameri- 
can Chemist; his Past and Present;" and if I were but a prophet I 
would venture to add, his future. Even as a historian I can claim 
neither special gifts nor training, and what I may have to say must be 
regarded only as a contribution to the treatment of so large a subject. 

The earlier records of the work of the American chemist are to be 
found only in periodu-als of a general scientific character; for it is only 
within comparatively recent years, as we know, that he has been fortu 
nate enough to have journals dev^oted exclusively to his own science. 
Before theestabUshment of these chemical journals, the, American Jour- 
nal of Scieriee and Arts, better known as ISillitnan''s Journal, contained 
almost the entire record of his work. Besides and before this were only 
Transactions of scientitlc societies, to which, however, he was but a 
meager contributor, with a few notable exceptions. 

The oldest of these Transactions were those of the American Philo- 
sophical Society of Philadelphia; contemporaneous therewith was the 
New Yorl- Medical Repository. My history begins with what 1 can find 
in these periodicals or Transactions Believing that the whole history 
can be presented in a more interesting manner if I divide the period 
over which it extends into distinct subi)eriods, T will give my account 
of it by decades after and inclusive of the year 1800. What little there 
is on record of the American chemist's work prior to that year may be 
included in one period and set forth in a few words. 

Of that time, just at the close of the last century, Dr. Priestly was 
the most prominent figure in chemical science. Indeed, if it had not 
been for his coming to this country, and his persistent devotion to the 
doctrine of phlogiston, and the opponents whom he aroused, there 
would have been exceedingly little to note of chemical work of any

kind. As far back before this as 1709 a paper was read before the 
Americau Philosophical Society, aud published in the first volume of 
the Transactions, entitled "An analysis of the chalyt)eate waters of 
Bristol, iu Pennsylvania," l)y one Dr. DeNorniandie, This being, 1 
think, the first chemical analysis made in this country, an account of it 
in the author's words will not be inappropriate. It runs as follows: 
Exp. (i) "A small portion of white oak bark infused in the waters 
induced an immediate change from transparency to a dark purple color, 
which it retained twenty-four hours without dei)ositing any sediment. 
(it) Some of the same water after being made hot, or exposed for a 
few hours to the open air, in a great measure lost its irony taste, and 
received no other color than that of a common tincture fiom the white 
oak bark, (iii) One drop of strong oil of vitriol in li ounces of the 
water produced no sensible alteration, and the water after standing- 
some time continued transparent, without depositing any okerish or 
other sediment to the sides, (iv) Ol. Tart. pr. deliq. dropped in some 
of the same water induced a change of color, rendering it somewhat 
yellow, and in time precipitated to the bottom of the cup a fine gold- 
colored oker. (V) Sixteen ounces avoirdujiois carefully evaporated to 
dryness in a china bowl in B. M. {baui marie, i. e., sand bath) left one 
grain of a yellowish brown powder of the taste of tart, tartariz. (vi) 
Linen moistened with the scum floating on the top of the spring is 
tinged with a strong iron mold, (vii) This water in weight is exactly 
the same as rain water. From these experiments it is sufficiently evi- 
dent that this water in its natural state contains a large portion of iron 
dissolved in pure water by means of an acid, which acid is extremely 
volatile and of the vitriolic kind." 

In another paper the author goes on to describe nine other exi>eri- 
ments of the same sort, from which he concludes that liis first dedu(;- 
tion IS confirmed that the water contains considerable iron, that the acid 
must be either vitriolic or nitrous, that there is a small portion of neu- 
tral salts in these waters, that they contain sulphur, and that they are 
slightly alkaline. The author then discusses the medical properties of 
the water, comparing it with the German Si)a. 

Nothing else appears till 3 703, Avhen there is published an account of 
an earthy substance found near Niagara Falls, and vulgarly called 
" spray of the falls." 

We turn from such crude work as this, even though probably the best 
possible at the time and place, to that of Priestly and his opponents, 
with a sense that we have hold of something of far greater importance, 
even if the main writer was all wrong in his theory. Plis first paper 
printed in this country appeared, I think, in 1796, in the same Transac- 
tions on " p]xperiments and observations relating to analysis of atmos- 
pheric air;" also, further experiments relating to " Generation of air 
from water," the conclusion from which is that water is convertible into 
phlogisticated air. From this year on to the end of the century he pub-

lished iminerous short articles in this periodical aii<l in the New York 
Medical Repository. 

In December, 1709, he read a i)aper before the American Philosophical 
Society on '' Change of place in different forms of air throngh several 
interposing- snbstances," and, says Dr. Bolton, "recognizes distinctly 
for the first time the phenomenon of gaseous diffusion." In the volume 
of the Xew York Medical Ilepository for 1798-'99 he published eight let- 
ters to Dr. Mitchell defending tlu^ doctrine of phlogiston. In the same 
journal Dr. J. Woodhouse, professor of chemistry in the University of 
Pennsylvania, had many papers, from 1795 to 1800 and beyond, — oppos- 
ing Dr. Priestley's phlogistic views. What meager showing this is, 
when we consider that on the other side of the ocean, we find in the 
Annales de Chimie, the first volume of which appeared in 1789, such 
names ot French chemists as Fourcroy, Lavoisier, Berthollet, Ohaptal, 
Sennebier, Pelletier, Seguin, Yauquelin, Guyton de Morveau, and others, 
as contributors, from 1789 to 1800, of articles on the greatest variety 
of chemical subjects; qualitative and quantitative analyses of minerals 
and mineral waters, studies of the chemical properties of elements and 
of their compounds, the chemistry of plant life and animal life, proxi- 
mate analyses of some organic substances, the preparation of pure salts 
of various kinds, the illuminating power of different oils, besides the 
discussions on phlogiston, which Avere of course a prominent feature in 
the chemical literature of that period when this theory was receiving 
its death blows at the hands of Lavoisier. Books on chemistry were 
published, such as Methode de Komcnchiture Chimique, Traite de Chiniie, 
Ussai de Sfatique Ghimique, System dcs Connaissanccs Cliiiniquc, Philo- 
sopMe Ghimique; and in that same i)eriod tha Annale.s de Chimie wns, 
started. In Gernumy there was Eichter, author of An/aiuj.syriixden 
der Stochiometrie, der Messkunst Chemischer Elemente, and " TJeher die 
neueren Gegcnstdnde in der Ghemie^^ in which he established by his own 
researches "the doctrine of proportions by weight, and showed that 
acids combined with bases to form salts, and developed the law of neu- 
tralization." There was also Klaproth, the first professor of chemis- 
try in the University of Berlin, who developed esi)ecially (pnintitative 
analysis, established l)y his improve<l methods the c()m])()sition of many 
minerals, and discovered uranium, titanium, and zirconium. In Swe- 
den there was Scheele, who made a multitude of important contribu- 
tions to chemistry, of which even a very imperfect enumeration would 
take too much of my time; and Bergmann, eminent as an analytical 
chemist and for his researches in analytical chemistry. 

In England there was Cavendish who established the composition of 
water, and of nitric acid. 

We pass on to the next decade, 1800-1809, when in England Sir 
Humphrey Davy first appeared prominently as a discoverer in chem- 
istry, and published his account of the isolation of the metals potassium 
and sodium, andDalton with his first developments of theatomic theory;

wlion ill Sweden there Avas the great Berzelius, who, from 1807 on, 
devoted his entire energy to one great aim, the development of the 
atomic theory, and the first vohime of whose Lchrhncli appeared in 1808;

of gases by volume; Thenard, beginning in 1807 his investigations on

Surely something of the si)irit of this great work going on in Europe 
should begin to make itself felt across the Atlantic, even though the 
communication between the New World and the Old was still so difficult 
and narroM'ly limited. lUit tliere is practically nothing recorded in the 
only journals to a\ hich I have access, those already named, and there 
is good ground for believing that nothing important was done. Priest-

with what was being done abroad; such as '"Observations on the dis- 
covery of niter in common salt which had been previously mixed with 
snow," and ''Transmission of acids, etc., in the form of vapor over sev- 
eral substances in hot tubes;" " Production of air by the freezing of 
water," Pobert Hare, jr., first appears in an "Account of fusion of 
strontites and volatilization of platinum," andB. Silliman in an "Anal- 
ysis of a meteoric stone." Also, there is mention of perhaps the first 
soil analysis in America, under the title " On the substances which 
constitute the mineral soil of the environs of Boston." 

All records fail me of any work done in the next decade, nothing 
being given in the above Transactions, till the appearance of Sillirnan's 
Journal in 1819; the eight short papers of that year, one of them by 
Dr. Hare and the others by Silliman, only one to four pages each, and 
relating to unimportant topics, merit no further mention. 

In the twenties over seventy papers of chemical import were given in 
Silliman's Journal, of which sixteen, mostly by Robert Hare, and very 
short Avith but four or five exceptions, referred to new forms of chemical 
apparatus or to reagents; seventeen, from one to seven images in length, 
related to analyses of minerals; there were two papers on the present 
state of chenucal science and three on atomic weights, or points in 
chemical theory; other topics were generally of no special interest. In 
the Transactions of the American Philoso])hical Society, and in the 
Journal of the Franklin Institute which was started during this period, 
and the Proceedings of the Lyceum of Natural History of New York, 
were nine short papers, chiefly on analyses of minerals. 

In the. thirties about one hundred papers appeared in Sillimairs Jour- 
nal and the Journal of the Franklin Institute, nearly all of which were 
short — less than five pages long; but the character of the work, so far 
as indicated by the topics, was becoming higher; twenty-six papers 



THE AMERICAN CHEMIST. 243 

related to sstudies of the properties of eliemical elemeiitiji or their inor- 
gauic compounds, and fifteen to studies in organic chemistry — none of 
them very deep, perhaps, hut still on a liigher plane than heretofore; 
only fifteen related to analysis of minerals or mineral waters, six or 
eight to technical matters, and seven to analytical methods; the remain- 
der were on miscellaneous topics, mostly of subordinate importance. 
About twenty-tive of the whole number of papers were contributed by 
Dr. Robert Hare, many of them very short, and, as in previous years, 
on new forms of apparatus or new methods of preparati(m of substances, 
in the devising of which he appears to have been very ingenious. No 
other single writer was so prominent in the records of either this or the 
preceding decades. 

In the fortk-fi (184S), a new periodical was added, tlie Transactions of 
the American Association for the Advancement of tScience. Furtlicrmore, 
original work in chemistry took a wonderful start; and well it might; 
for such names appeared, familiar enough to some of the oldest of us, 
if not to the younger men m my audience, as W. B. and K. E. Rogers, 
the llrst of whom afterwards took an imiiortant part in the organiza- 
tion of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; J. Lawrence 
Smith, 0. U. Shei)ard, John W. Draper, T. Sterry Hunt, E. N. Hors- 
ford, and W. Gibbs, many of whom had received their inspiration m 
the laboratories of Germany. Smith studied under Ortila, Dumas, and 
Liebig; Draper, a native of England, under Dr. Turner, of the Uni- 
versity of London; Horsford under Liebig; Dr. Gibbs under Rammels- 
burg, Rose, Liebig, and Regnault. 

Over a hundred papers appeared in the periodicals above named, 
and, while greater length does not necessarily mean much, nevertheless 
when i)apers of ten, fifteen, twenty pages or over, are the rule, rather 
than papers of two to four or five pages, it is not far out of the way to 
suppose that when such men as these I have named, and Silliman and 
Hare, write them, they are not made up of padding. Classifying these 
hundred or more papers roughly, about forty-three of them may ju'op- 
erly be called purely scientific papers on inorganic chemistry, t\^euty 
on organic chemistry, twenty on analyses of minerals and waters, ten 
on analytical chemistry, and the rest on technical or other topics more 
removed from pure science. J. Lawrence Smith contributed eight of 
these papers; Hunt, ten; the Rogers brothers, eight. Dr. Hare was 
still prolific, contributing eight papers. Eight of the i)apers were 
purely theoretical, such as those on "The idea of an atom suggested 
by the phenomena of weight and temperature;" "Allotroiiism of 
chlorine as connected with the theory of substitution;'" "Anomalies 
presented in the atomic volumes of phosphorous and nitrogen;" "Prin- 
ciples to be considered in chemical classification;" "Theory of com- 
pound salt radicals." 

In the fifties about one hundred and seventy papers were published, 
against one hundred in the ])recediug decade, classified as follows: 
purely scientific, inorganic chemical work, about sixty; organic, eight; 



244 THE AMERICAN CHEMIST. 

analyticiil, twenty three; mineral analyses and studies, forty; technical 
subjects, nineteen; miscellaneous, eighteen. Several of these papers 
are theoretical studies; as, "Comparison between atomic weights and 
chemical and physical action of barium, strontium, calcium, and mag- 
nesium, with some of their compounds ; " " Numerical relations between 
the atomic weights, and some thoughts on the classitication of the ele- 
ments;" "Theoretical relation of water and hydrogen;" "Apparent 
perturbation of the law of definite ])roportions in compounds of zinc and 
of antimony;" "Rational constitution of certain organic compounds," 
etc. New and well-known names ai)pearing prominently were those of 
Genth, Mallet, Cooke (J. P.), Brush, and C. M. Warren. Robert Hare's 
name disappears. Cooke, in hisarticle, abovementioned, on the numer- 
ical relations between the atomic weights, etc., classifies the elements 
in six series similar to the series of homologues in organic chemistry; 
in each series the difterence between the successive atomic weights is 
a niultii)le of some whole nundjer, this number being different for the 
different series. He shows that the properties of the elements in each 
series follow a law of progression ; the numerical law for the progression 
in the specific gravity is given; and when a sutficient number of deter- 
minations shall have been made of such other i)roperties as are capable 
of measurement, he predicts that numerical laws for each of these kinds 
of variation can be ascertained. Thus he looks forward to a perfect 
science of chemistry in which we shall be able to foretell with certainty 
the properties, not only of undiscovered elements in any given series, 
but also of the compounds of these elements. There are many corre- 
spondences between his classification and that of Mendelcef, and as 
above sIiowmi, he forshadows the idea, already realized with the aid of 
Mendeleef's classification, of tlie possibility of locating and describing 
hithertounknown elements. Hunt contributed seventeen of thejiajiers, 
largely given to the analysis and constitution of minerals; indeed, the 
examination of American minerals was a very prominent feature of the 
chemical work of this decade, as .shown by the number of papers on 
the subject. J. Lawrence Smith and JNIallet did the largest part of 
their work on this line, and the former made an important contribu 
tion to the methods of anlaysis of minerals, in his new i)rocess for the 
se])aration of the alkalies. It was in this decade that the famous work 
appeared of Gibbs ami Genth on tiie Animoniao Cobalt Bases, cover 
ing 59 quarto pages of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge — 
the longest single article that had, up to thattime, appeared on a chem 
ical research. A redetermination of the atomic weight of lithium and 
of antimony was made by Mallet, the fiist work of this kind done by 
an American chemist. It may well be said that this is the first decade 
of chemical research in this country which has some })rominent and 
imi)ortant characteristics to distinguish it i'rom the others that i)re- 
ceded it. 

In the alxtics about two hundred and fifteen papers were published, 



THE AMERICAN CHEMIST. " 245. 

against one hundred and seventy in the fifties, of which ninety per- 
tained to general inorganic chemistry, forty to organic chemistry, 
twenty eight to methods of analysis and new forms of a-p])aratus for 
analytical purposes, thirty to the analysis of minerals and mineral 
waters; seven were on technical subjects, fourteen on meteorites, four 
on agricultural chemical topics, and three on animal or vegetable phys- 
iological chemistry. More attention was given in this decade than in 
the preceding one to more purely scientific studies in general chemis- 
try, for on inorganic and organi(; chemistry together there were one 
hundred and thirty papers, against only sixty eight in the earlier jieriod, 
while analyses of new minerals, also genuine scientific work, were 
almost as numerous as before. The most prominent contributor was 
Lea, nearly all of whose papers, over thirty in number, were on impor- 
tant topics in both inorganic and organic chemistry. Cooke and Hors- 
ford, of Harvard, and Gibbs and J. Lawrence Smith contributed 
important papers, as did also Hunt; Warren made some important 
contributions in organic chemistry. Other contributors were Brush, 
Ordway, Crafts, and Wetherill. Hiiuichs first appeared with his theo- 
retical essays, which some of us have perhaps attempted to master and 
assimilate. Of the papers on general inorganic and organic chemistry, 
about forty were from ten to thirty ]>ages in length, indicating, at least 
as to quantity of nuiterial to be communicated, research studies of con- 
siderable length. The proportion of such long papers was very much 
snuiller in the preceding decades. 

There is nuich work deserving special mention in this decade, such 
as Clark's "Constants of Nature," a collection of all the reliable deter- 
minations of specific gravities, boiling points, melting points, specific 
heats, and expansion by heat, an<l covering 450 octavo pages of the 
^SniWtsonian MlseellaneouH Collections; Warren's Monograph, of 100 
quarto pages in The Transactions of the American Academy of Arts and 
Sciences, ou "A new form of apiKiratus for fractional condensation of 
volatile li({uids free from objections incident to the methods in use;" 
and "Researches on volatile hydrocarbons; " also, his papers ou "A 
new method for combustion in a current of oxygen gas alone, without 
the use of cupric oxide;" and on "The analysis of organic substances 
containing sulphur and chlorine." 

As one result of his work ou the hydro-carbons, Warren showed that 
the elevation of the boiling point for an increment of CIT^ in homolo- 
gous series is 30°, or much larger than was hitherto supposed; and 
that in certain other series derived from the benzole series, differences 
in boiling points for CII2 added or removed are much smaller than 19°, 
Kopp's ligure. 

Worthy of mention is Lea's attempt at a classification of the elements 
in several groups, the members of each group differing by 44-45, show- 
ing that " the elements thus grouped consist of bodies whose proper- 
ties are analogous — and that this classification is in harmony with the 



246 • THE AMERICAN CHEMIST. 

distinguishing characteristics of the substances classified." One such 
group starts with Sb, 120-3; As, 75; P, 31; N, 14; Sn, 59, and Pb, 103-5. 
Another comprises Hg, 200; Cd, 112; Zn, 65-5, and Mg, 24-4; all the 
members of this last group are in one of Mendeleef's groups, and the 
first four members of the first group are also in another of Mendeleef's. 
This grouping is founded on a broader basis; but Lea's was published 
thirty years ago, in 1800. 

Gibbs showed by reference to the volumetric relation of gaseous 
compounds that if the i^roposed new atomic weights, 1(), 12, and 32, be 
accepted for oxygen, carbon, and sulphur, the atomic weights of at least 
fifty other elements must be doubled, and as he is not a man to fail to 
give due credit to others it is fair to infer that he was the first to call 
attention to this necessity. Lea's work on the ethyl bases, as he calls 
them, diethylamine, triethylamine, etc., is comprised in several papers, 
in which he gives a very full account of their reactions and a new 
method of separating them by picric acid. Ordway gave a very exhaust- 
ive paper on soluble glass, its chemistry and applications; Gibbs and 
Lea also made extensive researches on the platinum metals, and very 
notable are the many contributions made by Gibbs on improvements in 
methods of analysis. Everything coming from his laboratory was reli- 
able, and there was much of it. Hunt published three papers on the 
chemistry of mineral waters, in Avhich, on the basis of certain general 
principles laid down, and of a number of analyses of waters of the 
Cham]»lain and St. Lawrence basins, lie attem}»ted to trace the history 
of these waters and account for their origin, and in another pai)er he 
attem])ted also to trace out the origin of the dolomites. Crafts, with 
Friedel, by results of research on the silicic ethers, jiroved, as he thinks, 
convincingly the tetratomic character of silicium. Gaffield's interest- 
ing researches on the action of sunlight on glass were made in this 
decade. Gibbs made a very va]ual)le contribution to the resources of 
physical chemistry by a calculation of the wave lengths of the lines of 
a large number of the elements, from measurements made by Angstrom 
and Ditscheiner, and Iluggin's scale of wave lengths of 1,000 lines. 
Goessmau discussed in a careful and thorough manner the origin of the 
salt beds and the composition of the salt and the brine of the ocean 
water. 

Three notable books appeared in this decade, Cooke's "Chemical 
Physics," Storer's "Dictionary of Solubilities," and Wormley's "Micro- 
chemistry of Poisons." 

In the seventies, about 240 papers were puldished, a part of them 
in three new periodicals. The American Institute of jNIining Engineers 
issued its first volume of Transactions in 1871. Methods of chemical 
analysis naturally occupied mnch of the attention of the chemical mem- 
bers ofthis institute. The Ameriean Chemical Journed and the Journal 
of the American Chemical Society made their first appearance in 1879. 
This society was established in 1877 and published two volumes of 



THK AMERICAN CHEMIST. 247 

Transactions prior to tlie issue of the first vohime of ifs journal. Dr. 
Chii\\i\\ev''i> American Chemist also appeared in this decade.* 

Eighty of the papers published referred to general inorganic chemis- 
try; 47 to organic chemistry; i57 to analytical methods and ap])aratus; 
only 13 to minerals and mineral waters, and the same to technical sub- 
jects; 21 short papers Avere on meteorites; agricultural chemistry had 
14 papers; physiological chemistry o; and sanitary chemistry 2. Ana- 
lytical chemistry was very much more prominent in the work of this 
decade, and iu fact than at any time before it; methods of agricultural 
chemical analysis, as well as of annlysis|)ertaining to the mining engi- 
neering interests, especiali^^ ofirou and steel, received special attention. 
The promiuent contributors were M. C. Lea, J. Lawrence Smith, Gibbs, 
Remsen, and Clarke; there were 130 writers in all, of whom only 14 
contributed 5 or more i)a[)ers, and only 2, Lea and J. Lawrence Smith, 
contributed over 10 papers; but many of these papers were short. Iu 
mass and importance of material published, Gibbs, Clarke, Mallet, and 
Remsen ranked as high as the more frequent contributors, especially 
if they receive the credit due them for work done in their laboratories, 
although published in the names of their assistants or students. The 
beginning of Chittenden's extended work in physiological chemistry 
ajipeared in this decade. Remsen, C. L. .Jackson, and A. Michael also 
became prominent as leaders in research inorganic chemistry. Gooch, 
besides giving us his crucible for filtration, published a valuable work 
on the determination of ]>hosphorus pentoxide. Gibbs began his long 
and difficult researcli on complex inorganic acids, of tungsten, and 
molybdenum. Clarke traced out some new relations l)etween the 
atomic volumes of the eleuients. Hilgard began his work on the 
methods of analysis of soils, in which he is now the universally recog- 
nized authority. J. W. Draper showed that the diagram given in so 
many works at that time, and occasionally even now, exhibiting une- 
qual distribution of heat and actinism in the solar spectrum is mis- 
leading — that, on the contrary, the heat and chemical power are as great 
at one end of the spectrum as at the other, the diffraction sijectrum 
showing no such inequality as the diagram represents. Lea continued 
his research on the action of light on silver salts and also made new 
determinations of the atomic weights of nickel and cobalt. J. Law- 
rence Smitli established the presence of a solid hydro-carbon and free 
sulphur in meteorites. Cooke made new determinations of the atomic 
weight of antimony. 

While there are single researches in the preceding decade of higher 
importance than any that appear in this, a careful comparison of the 
whole amount of work done luight show that there was little difference 
in the real advance made in the two decades. 

* This journal was begun iu July, 1870, and completed seven volumes, ending in 
1876. It had been preceded by an Anicricau reprint of the English Chemical Xeivs, 
with an American supplement. 



248 THE AMERICAN CHEMIST. 

Ill the eUjhtles we >see an enormous advance in clienncal work. One 
newclieniieal periodical appeared, tlie Journal of Analytical Chemutry. 

Exclnsive of papers on the examination of foods and drugs in the 
Keports of Boards of Health of three or four States, and of papers in 
Reports of Agricultural Experiment Stations, the whole number pub- 
lished was about 875, and inclusive of ^lapers excepted as above the 
total would certainly not be less than 1)00, or more than three and a 
half times as many as in the preceding decade. About 130 of these 
papers related to general inorganic chemistry; 255 to general organic 
chemistry; 283 to analytical chemistry ; over 50 to agricultural chemis- 
try, 25 to technical chemistry; 30 to physiological chemistry; 33 to 
analyses of minerals and mineral waters, and also 33 mostly very short 
papers, to analyses of meteorites. The amount of solid work on these 
several lines may be indicated in a measure by the length of the papers; 
a paper of 1, 2, or even 3 pages would as a general thing represent in- 
vestigations of minor importance, and comparatively little actual work, 
although there may be some excei)tions to the rule. Comparing in this 
respect the 3 leading lines of work, general inorganic chemistry, organic 
chemistry, and analytical chemistry, about 00 per cent of the papers in 
analytical chemistry are more than 3 pages long, while only 22 \)qv cent 
of the papers in inorganic chemistry, and 19 per cent of those in organic 
chemistry, exceed that limit. 

About 380 chemists contributed these papers, of whom, however, 
258 appeared but once or twice in the whole decade. The most fre- 
quent contributors were Clarke, Chittenden, Cibbs, H. B. Hill, Jackson, 
Morse, Michael, Mabery, Mallet, Eemsen, E. F. Smith, and Wiley. 
Several valuable contributions were made by others, who i)ublished 
fewer papers, and in some cases very imi)ortant ones. 

The most notable feature in the work of this decade is the great 
amount of work in organic chemistry, done especially under the lead 
of Eemsen, Jackson, and ]\Iichae], most of which seemed to find its 
natural way to the public through Remsen's owni journal. In these 
times, when the Jierichtc, Liebig's Annalen, Jouriud fur Praliischc 
Chcmic, Monat,shafir, and the Journal of the En(/li.sh Chemical Society 
are giving us every year their 1,500 pages and. more of papers on 
research in organic chemistry, there are at least some of us who are 
not only not conversant' with this work, our lines of study being in 
other directions, but are each year getting more and more hopelessly 
out of touch with it. As one of those I would not presume to pass 
judgment on the value of the researches in organic chenustry that are 
now being made in this country; but we can be confident that it is not 
such work as an American need be ashamed of. And I am sure we all 
rejoice that through these investigators our own country is contributing 
a large share of worthy research in this great branch of chemical 
science. 

In inorganic chemistry, Dr. (libbs continued his work into this 



THE AMERICAN CHEMIST. 249 

decade on the complex organic acids. Morley contributed his masterly 
papers on the analysis of air and his work on the atomic weight of 
oxygen; Becker, his digest of investigations on determinations of 
atomic weights since 1814, occupying 270 pages of the Smithsonian 
MisceUaneous Collections; Clarke gave his re-calculations of the 
atomic weights; M. C. Lea, his discovery of the allotropic forms of 
silver; Cooke and Kichards, the re-determination of the atomic 
weights of oxygen and hydrogen; Mallet, his revision of the atomio 
weight of aluminum and determination of the molecular weight of 
hydrofluoric acid; Craft's, his determination of the vapor destiny of 
iodine, with results differing from those of both Deville and Troost, 
and Victor Meyer, and his paper on the vapor density of permanent 
gases; and Warder, some of the first beginnings of work on physical 
chemistry. 

I have had pointed out to me by a comj^etent authority as the most 
significant papers in organic chemistry, " Oxidation of substitution i)rod- 
ucts of the aromatic hydrocarbons," and " Investigations on the sul- 
l)hinides," by Eemsen and his pupils; "Researches on the substituted 
benzyl compounds," by Jackson and his jnipils; " Furfurol and its 
derivatives," by H. B. Hill, and " Researches on allo-isomerism," by 
Michael and his pupils. Other leaders in this organic work were 
Mabery, L. M. ISTorton, and W. A. Xoyes. 

In analytical chemistry nothing more prominent appeared than Mal- 
let's most valuable and exhaustive work, in the report of the lamentably 
short-lived U. S. Board of Health, on "The determination o\' the 
organic matter in potable water " and jNIorley's on "The analysis of 
air." Analytical chemistry was much advanced along certain technical 
lines by the work of the Association of the Ofticial Agricultural 
Chemists, begun in 1884, and by co-operative work on the analysis of 
iron and steel, imblished in the transactions of the Institute of Mining- 
Engineers. 

In i^hysiological chemistry, Chittenden continued with Ely and others 
the important work begun in the preceding decade, and published 
valuable papers on the digestive liquids and the products of their action 
on the proteids. In sanitary chemistry the work begun by the lamented 
Nichols in the seventies was carried further in this decade by Mallet 
in the paper on the determination of organic matter iu potable water, 
already referred to, and the valuable papers by Leeds on potable water 
supplies, in reports of the New Jersey State Board of Health and the 
Journal of this society. A large amount of work on the examination 
of foods and drugs was done under the supervision of the boards of 
health of a very few States, notably Massachusetts ami New York, and 
of certain cities. 

In agricultural chemistry, under the generous provision made by the 
IT. S. Government by an act passed in 188G, giving $15,000 annually 
to every State in which an agricultural college was established under 



250 THE AMERICAN CHP:MIST. 

the act of 1802, aud the uo less generous provision made by some of 
the States themselves, a very laro-e amount of work has been done. 
So close are the relations of chemistry to agriculture, that the opening 
and liberal equipment of a chemical laboratory for special work was 
among the first steps taken, on the establishment of each agricultural 
experiment station under this grant; thus at present a chemist, with 
often one or more assistants, is exclusively engaged in each State in 
agricultural chendcal investigation. Under the liberal appro^triation 
made also by the Department of Agriculture for chemical investigation, 
more liberal than by any other Government, a large amount of valuable 
work has been done at Washington. In the outcome of these various 
provisions may be included Atwater's papers on the sources of the 
nitrogenous food of the plant, Kichardson's on the composition of 
American cereal grains, the work of Jordan, Armsby, and their asso. 
ciates on tlie digestibility and feeding value of fodder materials, and 
Hilgard's continuation of his work on soil analysis. Many papers were 
published on improvements in methods of agricultural chemical analy 
sis, and a very large amount of routine work was done in theexamina- 
ation of commercial fertilizers for tlie purpose of protecting the con- 
sumers from fraud. In all this a prominent part was taken also in this 
decade by Johnson, Goessman, Jenkins, Ilabcock, Osborne, and others. 

Thus my history closes; a hurried one, and therefore imperfect, but 
nevertheless giving, I trust, something of an idea of what we have 
come to in this country, from very small beginnings. From about 
eighty papers in the twenties, the first decade in which any work of 
importance was done, to over nine hundred in the eighties is great 
progress: and the progress justly appears greater, when the character 
of the work is also taken into account. In the twenties the papers 
were mostly about the analysis of minerals, or new forms of apparatus 
or new reagents — and mostly very short papers — and in general much 
below the grade of work that was going on in Europe; in the eighties 
the work was on the same lines and of the same order as that done 
elsewhere, and as well as that, rich in imp!)rtant results. 

But there is room for further progress still, much of it, before we in 
this country shall accomplish as nuich as our brother chemists do in 
Europe, — before our Chemical Society shall, if it publishes a journal, be 
able to send out annually such a volume as the Berlin Society does, to 
say nothing of what appears in other German periodicals. 

What are our prospects, and M'hat our means for doing this? This 
kind of work is done at the universities of Germany and her technical 
schools. We have universities; more of them, so-called, than Ger- 
many has; we have a few technical schools of a high order, and innu- 
merable colleges. These universities and technical schools have their 
chemical laboratories, as have also many of the colleges. Every State 
has its agricultural experiment station, with a working chemical lab- 
oratory. So far then, as concerns laboratories, and men in charge of 



THE AMERICAN CHEMIST. 251 

them more or less specially educated as chemists, there is abundant 
provision. Every one of these universities, collejics, and advanced 
technical schools has a double mission to perform, if it does the whole 
work that is expected elsewhere in the world, of institutions giving 
higher instruction. One of these missions is to teach — to impart 
knowledge that is already a part of the world's possession of know- 
ledge, to the students who are seeking it, now in larger numbers than 
ever before. The other mission is to gain new knowledge — to add to 
the world's stock of it. Here and there is seen a man of wealtli, and 
scientific tastes and ac»[uirements, and an aptitude for research, who 
investigates in his own private laboratory, and does good work there; 
but siu'h a combination is rare. These higher institutions of learning- 
are to be in the future, as they have been in the past, the fittest places, 
and indeed almost the only i)laces, for the making- of both investigators 
and investigations. 

Why is it, with so many of these institutions as we have, making 
claim to this high rank in our system of instruction, that we fall so far 
short of contributing our full share of the world's acquisition of new 
knowledge, year by year? Tlie first and perhaps most important rea 
son is that those upon whom tliis work devolves, and who would be 
glad to do it, have no time for it. Their work of instruction, often 
comprising many branches of science, uses up all their energy. This 
unfortunate condition of affairs is chargeable, to a large extent, to the 
nuiltiplicity of colleges with endowments inadequate for the x>eifM'm- 
ance of the whole work of a college. It may be fairly said that no 
institution of learning is fully worthy of being called a university, or 
a college of high rank, that does mit provide teachers enough, so that 
each one has spare time for investigation. There is room for imjtrove- 
ment, in this respect, even in some of our largest universities. It is 
not always practicable for an outsider, such as the average trustee is, 
to get so thorough an acquaintance with the inner workings of the 
several departments, as to understand how most of a teacher's time 
may be consumed in the management of the petty details of a labora- 
tory full of students, provided that he does his duty there. 

Secondly, given the time when this important feature of college and 
university comes to be properly appreciated, will there be means for the 
work '? There i-an be little doubt that they will then be provided ; if not 
in any other way, when it appears that there are men ready and competent 
to carry on valuable investigations, but who can not for wantof means and 
appliances, new funds for the promotion of such work may perhaps be 
added to those already in existence, such funds as the Elizabeth 
Thompson science fund, now amounting to $27,000, the Bache research 
fund, and the Wolcott Gibbs fund for chemical research. 

Given time and means, have we the men in this country for credita- 
ble scientific research? I think that such an answer to this question 
as is indicated by the records of the chemical research in the decade 



252 THE AMERICAN CHEMIST. 

from 1880 to 1890 is most encouraging'. Great investigators like great 
poets, like men great in any tiling, are born not made; born, may we 
not truly say, out of the spirit of tbe country and the period in which 
their great works are done. But when born they must be nurtured, 
and the place for their nurture is the university. In this sense the 
university must make the investigator as well as the investigation. In 
the land where the spirit of investigation is rife there will be the most 
material out of which to make investigators; and there too will men and 
women destined to be such be most sure to drift into tlie line of life 
work for which they are best adapted and receive the best training 
for it. 

It seems to me that the relations of our society to this matter of the 
furtherance of chemical investigation in this country are of vital impor- 
tance; that if it does not appear in its stated meetings or the meetings 
of its sections scattered throughout the country that it is alive with the 
spirit of research, it will fail to establish its reascm for being; andmem- 
bershij) of it will be of little advantage to anybody, and that the society 
itself will be of little service to the countiy.

THE HIGHEST METEOROLOGICAL STATION IN THE 

WORLD.* 



By A. Lawrence Rotch. 



By the will of Mr. Uriah A. Boydeii, a considerable sum of money was 
left in 1887 to Harvard College Observatory to aid in the establishment 
of an observatory " at such an elevation as to be free, so far as i^racti- 
cable, from the impediments to accurate observation which occur in the 
observatories now existing, owing to atmosi)heric influences." Pre- 
liminary stations were accordingly established in Colorado and in Cali- 
fornia, provided with meteorological and astronomical instruments to 
test the meteorological as affecting the visual conditions. From these 
observations it was concluded that the selection of a proper site was 
Ijy no means a question of elevation alone, and it was thought desira- 
ble, from theoretical considerations, to secure a location within the 
tropics. 

An expedition was accordingly sent to South America, where a sta- 
tion on Mount Harvard, near Lima, Peru, at an elevation of 0,000 feet, 
Wiis occui)ied for a year, and other sites further south were examined 
by the Messrs. Bailey. Owing to the remarkable clearness and steadi- 
ness of the air at Arequipa, Peru, it was finally decided to locate a 
l)ermanent station there, and, under the direction of Prof. W. II. Pick- 
ering, land was purchased outside this city and the observatory build- 
ings were erected in 1891. The city of Arequipa is situated above a 
desert about 80 miles from the Pacific Ocean, in a little oasis formed 
by a river valley at the foot of the Cordillera. The observatory is 
built upon the crest of a hill overlooking this valley, about 400 feet 
above the city and 8,050 feet above the sea. It stands approximately 
in 1(P 22' S. latitude and in 71° 22' W. longitude. Eastward the 
extinct volcano of Pichu-Pichu rises to a height of 18,000 feet; north- 
east, and 10 miles distant, is the quiescent volcano of the Misti, 19,200 
feet in altitude, and 12 mih^s north rises Charchani, 20,000 feet high, 
which is always snow-capped. 

The meteorological station, forming the subject of the article, is situ- 
ated on the latter mountain just below the permanent snow line.

254 HIGHEST METEOROLOGICAL STATION IX THE WORLD. 

Southeast of and about 3,400 feet below the fsuininit is a cirque^ forming 
a plateau less than half a mile s(|uare, Avlii<^h drops several hundred 
feet in a precipice on the south. Near the brink, at an elevation of 
10,650 feet above the sea, is the meteorological station. The instru- 
ments are contained in a small louvred shelter, 22 inches square, placed 
on a rock, and comprise the "exposed" and maximum and raininuim 
thermometers of the U. S. Signal Service i)atteru, a self-recording ane- 
roid barometer, and two self-recording thermometers, all of the well- 
known liichard freres^ construction. The record cylinders revolve in 
rather more than seven days, but as the clock movements operate dur- 
ing ten or twelve days, records for this length of time can be obtained, 
since, as the cylinders do not turn in an even number of days, tl e 
diurnal variations of pressure and temperature^-during the second week 
are not superposed up(m those of the first week. Near the shelter has 
been erected a stone hut, where the person who ascends the mountain 
to care for the instruments can spend the night if necessary. The 
ascent of 8,000 feet from the observatory can be made by mule in about 
eight hours; and though it is intended to have one of the assistants 
visit the station each four weeks, regular ascents have not ])een prac- 
ticable; conseijueutly, during the year the station has been equipped, 
only portions of ten months' records could have been obtained, and 
unforeseen stoppages of the self-recording instruments have farther 
reduced the (quantity of complete records to eight. The automatic 
traces of atmospheric pressure and air tempeiature are controlled by a 
mercurial ])arometer carried up by the observer and by readings of the 
"exposed" and the maximum and minimum thermometers, the two 
latter showing the extremes of temperature which have occurred since 
the last visit. The distance in an air line from the station to the observa- 
tory is about 11 miles, and such is the transparence of the air that on 
a large white disk, which has been placed on the edge of the i)lateau, a 
black spot, 1 inch in diameter, can be seen with the 13-incli telescope 
at the observatory. 

The meteorological equipment of the observatory is quite complete; 
and besides the ordinary instruments for direct observations there are 
the self-recording barometer and thermometer, of Richard freres, an 
anemograph of the Signal Service type, and photographic sunshine 
recorders of the form devised by l*rof. Pickering. Direct observations 
three times a day, at 8 a. m., 2 and 8 r. m., with frequent night observa- 
tions at 2 A. M., have been made during two years but have not been 
reduced. The results of the observations at both stations will be pub- 
lished later in the A)inals of Horranl CoJJege Olhscrratory, and their 
discussion will no doubt add greatly to our knowledge of mountain 
meteorology. Anything more than a brief summary of some of the 
most salient features would, therefore, be out of \)]i\rv here. From data 
for the year 189l-'02, cited by Prof. Pickering in Astrouomi/ and 
Astro- Phyaics^ May, 1802, it appears that the atmospheric pressure and 



i

air temperature at Arequipa are very uuiforni tlirouglioiit the year. 
The highest barometer reading was 22-(!7G inches on August 17, and 
the lowest, 22-472, on January 11). The maximum thermometer read- 
ing, which was exceptionally high, was 79° on June 3, and the lowest, 
38-o°, occurred eight days afterwards. Although the teini)erature 
nevxr descended to freezing, yet there are occasional frosts, and in the 
clear season the intense radiation causes thin ice to form. The clear 
season begins about the 1st ofAi)ri] and continues with scarcely an 
Hiterrui>tion until the 1st of November. During -lanuary and Febru- 
ary, 1892, most of the rain fell, amounting to 2 or 3 inches. In Febru- 
ary, 1893, 1 inches fell in a single storm, but this appeared unprece- 
dented and did great damage. The mornings are generally bright 
throughout the year, most of the rain falling in the afternoon or even- 
ing. Excepting during the rainy season, the air is exceedingly dry, 
relative humidities of 3a per cent having been recorded in March, 1893. 
The wind, as at low elevations, reaches its highest velocity in the mid- 
dle of the day, and it is generally calm at night. For the year above 
quoted, the highest velocity, 17 miles per hour, occurred in December. 
Soon after sunrise a strong wind blows down from the mountains to 
the northeast, after which the wind shifts, decreases in velocity, aud 
resumes its normal course. 

The diurnal i)eriods of the atmospheric pressure and the air temper- 
ature are interesting on account of the small amplitude of both, and 
tlie phases of the former. Taknig the barograph records for December 
at Mollendo at sea level, at Areipiijia (8.050 feet), and at the camp on 
Charchani (1<»,G.")0 feet), the respective diurnal amplitudes are 0-1 inch, 
0-07 inch, and 0-03 inch. Whereas, at the sea-level station, the chief 
minimum and maxinnim occur about 5 P. M. and 11 r. m., res])ectively, 
with secondaries at 4 A. m. and 9 A. M. ; at Arequipa, the chief mini- 
mum occurs about 5 a. m., and the secondary minimum about 4 p. m. 
Tlie night maximum, which is also the chief one, occurs at about the 
same hour at both stations; but at Arequipa the secondary day maxi- 
nnim is advanced to about 1 p. m. 

Not enough records at the Charchani station have been reduced to 
determine definitely the pressure period, but there appears to be a 
double daily maximum and minimum, Avhose times correspond in gen- 
eral to those at Are(piipa. The noon and night maxima have nearly 
equal intensities, but the morning minimum is deeper than the afternoon 
one as at Areijuipa. These facts are the more interesting because some 
preliminary observations by M. Vallot, on the summit of Mont Tjlanc 
(altitude 15,780 feet), showed but a single maximum at about 1 p. m., 
and a single miiiinmm about 4 A. m., with only a tendency toward a 
secondary minimum late in the afternoon. At Cliamounix, in the val- 
ley, the diurnal i)eriod is nearly the same as at Arequipa, so that the 
form of the curve at the Charchani station may be partly due to the 



256 HIGHEST METEOROLOGICAL STATION IN THE WORLD. 

situation of the iustrunieiit in a depression on the flank of the moun- 
tain, the topography of a station being known to influence these i)eriods. 

As has been stated, the permanent snow line is above the camp on 
Charchani, but last March, at the close of the warm and wet season, 
there were 2 feet of snow on the plateau. Snow covered the ground 
down to 11,700 feet, while ice formed at night as low as ll,r)0() feet. 
On the night of March 0, the temperature of the air, in the shelter at 
the Charchani cam^), fell to 20-5o, while over the snow, radiation low- 
ered it to 14°. The temj)eratures do not seem to be greatly influenced 
by the seasons, and the range from January to March, 1893, was from 
13° to 46° F. The decrease of temperature in the 8,000 feet of air 
between the cam]) and observatory, as deduced from nearly simulta- 
neous observations at 8 r. M. and 8 A. m. on IMarch Oand 10, 1893, was 1 
degree for 284 feet in the morning and 1 degree for 309 feet in the even- 
ing, which agrees with similar observations previously made in the 
tropics. The relative humidity was completely inverted at these times, 
the evening observations showing 34 per cent on the mountain and 56 
per cent at the observatory, while the morning observation gave 56 per 
cent on the mountain and 30 jier cent at the observatory, the changes 
from nearly complete saturation to great dryness being very sudden at 
the upper station. 

The physiological eflects of an ascent to the camp on Charchani, 
where the atmospheric jiressure is reduced to about 16*50 inches, are 
very marked. This seems to be about the limit to which mules can l)e 
driven, and seldom in other places have they been taken so high. Few 
persons escape the sorocJic or mountain sickness in some of its forms, 
especially if they stoj) at night. The eflect upon the writer during his 
eighteen hours' sojourn may be interesting. Though ordinarily sick at 
lower altitudes, there Avas here no nausea or severe headache, the usual 
symptoms of mountain sickness, which may i)erhaps be attributed to 
the ascent by mule, without muscular exertion, whereas previous high 
ascents had generally been on foot. Other symptoms however mani- 
fested themselves in abnormal excitability and restlessness which made 
sleep impossible, and by a ]ai)se of memory as well as in a want of 
sequence of ideas. The appetite remained good, and the writer's phys- 
ical condition made it prol-able that he could have climbed higher 
After a rest of two hours at the hut, the pulsations of the heart were. 
115, and the respiration through the lungs 25 per minute. These 
decreased during the night to 88 and 22, respectively, and the temper- 
ature of the blood (measured under the arm) from 9806o to 97*52°, 
the normals at Are(juii)a at night being 80, 21, and 97-10°, respectively. 

All the meteorological data would be much more valuable if obtained 
in the free air upon the summit of Charchani. The establishment of 
a station 3,400 feet higher, however, is a very difficult undertaking, as 
two unsuccessful attempts have been made by parties from the observ- 
atory to cliuib the steep and soow-covered slope, A thermometer shel-

ter, intended for the summit station, was carried some distance up on 
one of tliese occasions. If a suitable site could be selected on the sum- 
mit of Charcliaui, and self recording' instruments placed there, it seems 
feasible to engage an intelligent native to ascend the mountain once a 
month, or oftener, to keep the instruments in operation, since it is 
known that some natives are less incapacitated by great altitudes than 
are foreigners. It is possible that this plan may be carried out by the 
Harvard Observatory, or, if it is found impracticable, a lower and more 
accessible peak to the west of Charchani may be thus utilized. 

The comparatively elevated temperature and small snow-fall on the 
high mountains of Peru offer opportunities for the establishment of 
loftier meteorological stations than are afforded by any other country, 
and the establishment of such a summit station by the Harvard Observ- 
atory would be the crowning of its remarkable series of stations, 
extending from IMollendo, on the Pacific coast, along the railroad which 
crosses the desert of La Joya (4,140 feet), reaches the divide at Vin- 
cocaya (14,300 feet), and descends the watershed to Puno on Lake Titi- 
caca (12,540 feet). Another series, differing little in horizontal distance, 
but relatively greatly separated vertically, for which the observatory 
at Arequipa and the camp on Charchani already furnish steps, would 
make it possible to obtain data of the greatest value for the progress 
of meteorology, which is looking more and more to the study of the 
upper air for its advance; and for this study the mountain summits 
furnish the only practical method of obtaining continuous records 
approximating the conditions prevailing in the free air,

THE MONT BLANC OBSERVATOEY.* 



The project of establishing a meteorological and astronomical observa- 
tory on the summit of Mont Blanc has, under the care of jNI. J. Janssen, 
of the Meudon Observatory, made considerable progress during this 
year's summer months. It has been decided to use the snow itself as a 
foundation on which to rest the building. That this can be done with 
security was shown by some experiments carried out at ^Nlevidon last 
winter. A miniature mountain was made of snow pressed to the same 
density as that which is found on Mont Blanc at a depth of 1 or 2 
meters below the surface. This being made level at the top, disks of 
lead, 35 centimeters in diameter and weighing each about 30 kilograms, 
were placed on the snow, one 
upon the other. After twelve 
of these had been piled up, with 
an aggregate weight of 360 
kilograms, they were removed 
and the depth of the impres- 
sion measured. It was not 
more than 7 or 8 millimeters. 
Thus a structure measuring 10 
by 5 meters might safely weigh 
187,000 kilograms without 
sinking into the snow more 
than a few centimeters. 

The summit of Mont Blanc 
is formed by a very narrow 
edge of rock 100 meters long, 
running from west to east, and 
covered by snow which is 
thicker on the French than on 
the Italian side. The level of 
this snow has not shown any

important oscillations through- 
out a number of years. To obviate the disturl)ing effects of the storms 
which frequently rage around the suinnut, the building is constructed in 
the shapeof a truncated pyrami( I , the lower floor being sunk into the snow.

260 THE MONT BLANC OBSERVATORY. 

The rectangular base measures 10 by 5 meters. The upper floor, which 
will be devoted to the observations, is covered with a flat roof, toward 
which ascent is made by a spiral staircase leading from the basement 
upwards through the whole building, and above the flat roof to a small 
platform destined for meteorological observations. 

The whole observatory has double walls to protect the observers 
against the cold. The windows and doors are also double, and pro- 
vided on the outside with shutters closing hermetically. The floor is 
made of double planks, and furnished with trap doors giving access to 
the snow supporting the observatory, and to tlie screw jacks placed 
iu position for adjusting the level of the building in case the snow 
should yield. The building will be provided with heating apparatus 
and all the furniture necessary to make habitation at such an altitude 
possible. 

Up to the present the observatory has been transported in parts to 
Chamoumx. On the Grands Mulcts a cottage has been erected for the 
use of the workmen and for storing the things destined for the observ- 
atory. 

On the Grand Rocher Rouge another cottage has been built, only 
300 meters below the summit, m which the workers and observers 
can, if necessary, take refuge. Three-quarters of tlie materials for 
the observatory have been transported to the Grands-Mulets (3,000 
meters) and the rest to the Rocher Rogue (4,500 meters). 

Next year the erection on the summit will be carried out. An 
astronomical dome, which is to complete the observatory, will also be 
taken in hand. The work done up to now has been carried out under 
great difficulties, owing to the fact that everything had to be carried by 
hand. But no accident has, so far, marred the success. 

Dr. Capus, who accompanied M. Bonvalot in his well-known expedi- 
tion to the Pamir, has promised his assistance for certain observations. 
But the observatory will be international and open to all observers 
who wish to work there. 



THK OBSERVATORY ON MOUNT BLANC* 

As briefly announced in onr notes last week. Dr. Janssen has recently 
visited the observatory on Mount Blanc. In the current Compte.s ]\en 
dus he gives an account of the expedition from a scientific point of 
view, and the following is a translation of his description : 

Weleft Chamonix on September 8, at 7 a.m., and arrived at the sum- 
mit on Se[)tember 11, at 2:30 p. m. Tlie observatory was then in front 
of us. This construction has several floors, of which the framework, 
formed by large and massive beams crossed in all directions in order to 
insure the rigidity of the whole, produces a deep im[>iession upon the

THE MONT BLANC OBSERVATORY. 261 

One wonders how it has been possible to transport the edifice 
to this altitnde and fix it on the snow. However, if the conditions 
offered by the hard, permanent, and little mobile snows ot the summit 
are carefully considered, it is soon recognized that the snows are able 
to support very consideral)le weights,* and that they will be only slightly 
amenable to displacements, which will render it necessary to straighten 
again the construction which has been fixed upon them. 

On my arrival I made a rapid survey, and saw that the construction 
had not been sunk in the snow as much as 1 had stipulated of the con- 
tractors. I do not approve of this. My guides and myself then took 
possession of the largest underground room. I intended at first to fix 
the instruments for enabling observations to be commenced immedi- 
ately, and the provisions were left on the Rocher-Rouge. This circum- 
stance put us in a state of perplexity, for the weather suddenly became 
very bad, and we had to remain two days separated from the stores. 
The storm lasted from Tuesday until Thursday morning. Beautiful 
weather then set in, and I was able to begin the observations. 

The observations have for their principal object the question of the 
presence of oxygen in the solar atmosphere. The academy knows that 
I worked at this important point during my ascensions to the Grands- 
Mnlets (3,050 meters) in 1888, and at M. Vallot's observatory in 1890. 

But the novelty of the-observations of 1893 lies in the fact that they 
have been effected on the very summit of Mount Blanc, and that the 
instrument employed is infinitely snperior to that of the two j»receding 
ascensions. At the first, in fact, a Duboscq sjiectroscope, incapable of 
separating the B group into distinct lines, was employed, while the 
instrument about to be employed at the summit of Mount Blanc is a 
grating si)ectroscope (the dispersive piece of which I owe to the kind- 
ness of Rowland), with telescopes having a focal length of 0-75 and 
showing all the details of the B group. This circumstance is of consid- 
erable imi^ortance, for it may lead to the discovery, in the constitution 
of the group in question, of valuable elements for measuring in some 
way the effects of the diminution of the action of our atmosphere as 
one ascends into it, and, accordingly, to determine whether thisdiminu- 
tion corresponds to total extinction at its limits. In fact, we shall 
learn whether or no the double lines which make u^) the B group dimin- 
ish in intensity as their refrangibilities diminish — that is, as their wave 
lengths increase. 

This circumstance may perhaps be employed with profit, if not to 
measure at least to observe the diminution of the action of the selective 
absorption of onr atmosi)here. It has been ascertained that the most 
feeble donbles fade away one after the other as the atmosphere is 
ascended — that is to say, as the absorbing action is diminished. Thus, 
under ordinary circumstances, at the surface of our seas or upon our 



* See Comples Ilendits for fiu account of expariuieuts made at Meiidoii on tlie resist- 
ance of slightly compressed snow. {Ante, p. 259.) 



262 THE MONT BLANC OBSERVATORY. 

plains, tliirteeii or fourteen doubles can be seeu, not reckoning that 
which is known as the head of B. 

But even at Chamonix— tliat is, at an altitude of 1,050 meters — the 
thirteenth double is very difficult to niakeout,andat the Grands-Mulets 
(3,050 meters) it is only possible to see from the tenth to the twelfth, 
while at the summit of Mount Blanc I could hardly go beyond the 
eighth. 

It is not to be supposed that we establish a proportionality between 
the numerical diminution of the doubles and that of the atmospheric 
action. The law is evidently of a much more complex character. But 
this diminution, especially when considered in connection with the 
experiments made with tubes full of oxygen, and able to re-produce the 
series of atmospheric phenomena to which we have referred, is sufficient 
for us to conclude that the B group would totally disappear at the limits 
of our atmosphere. It is remarkable, however, that if we take the 
coefficient 0-5(!G that represents the dimijiution of atmospheric action 
at the summit of Mount Blanc according to barometric pressures 

/ —^^^ = 0*506 ) and multiply it by thirteen — the number that repre- 
sents the doubles clearly visible on the plain — we obtain 7-4 as the 
result — that is to say, very nearly the number (8) doubles that can be 
seen be me on the summit of Mount Blanc. 

This result is certainly remarkable, but I repeat that, in my opinion, 
it is only by the comparison with tubes reproducing the same optical 
conditions as nearly as possible that any definite conclusions will be 
obtained. These comijarative experiments have already been com- 
menced in the laboratory of Meudon Observatory, and they lead to the 
same result, viz, the disappearance of the groups A, B, and a at the 
limits of the atmosphere. On account of the importance of the ques- 
tion, however, the experiments will be repeated and completed. 

The question arises as to whether the high temperatures to which 
solar gases and vapors are subjected are not capable of modifying the 
power of selective absorption, and particularly whether the absorption 
of oxygen w^hich takes place in the sun's atmosphere would not be alto- 
gether different from that indicated by the experiments which have 
been made at ordinary temperatures. 

I have already instituted experiments with the idea of replying to 
this objection. I shall give an account of them to the academy in due 
course, but I may say that the absorption spectrum of oxygen, either 
the line spectrum or the unresolvable bands, do not api)ear to be modi- 
fied in an appreciable manner when the oxygen is raised to tempera- 
tures of about 400 or 500 degrees. 

On the whole, I think that observations made on the summit of 
Mount Blanc give a new ami much sounder foundation to the study of 
the question of the purely telluric origin of the oxygen groups in the 
solar spectrum, and lead to the conclusions previously stated. 



THE MONT BLANC OBSERVATORY. 263 

Independently of these observations I have also given some attention 
to the transparency of the atmosphere of this almost nnicjue station, 
and to the atmospheric phenomena which are inclnded in snch an 
extensive view, and across snch a great thickness. I shall speak of 
this on a fntnre occasion. 

The observatory of conrse is not completed. There yet remains 
mnch to be done independently of interior arrangements and the instal- 
lation of the instrnme'nts; l)ut the great difticnlty luis been overcome, 
for we are free to work, and no longer have to reckon with the snow- 
storms; the rest will follow in due conrse. 

I liope that the observatory will soon be able to offer a much more 
comfortable sojourn than I have had there; but that will depend upon 
the weather. Be this as it may, I regret nothing. 1 strongly wished 
to see our work in position^ and still more fervently desired to inau- 
gurate it by observations which are ever in my mind. I am fortunate 
at having been able to realize my desires in spite of some difficulties. 



KELATIONS OF AIK AND WATER TO TEMPERATURE AND 

LIFE.* 



By Gardiner G. Hubbard, 

President of the National Geographic Society. 



CIRCULATION OF AIR AND WATER. 

It was said in oldeu times, "The ^yiud blowetU where it listeth, and 
thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh and 
wbither it goeth." 

That which was unknown, science hath revealed. Tbe wind in its cur- 
rents is governed and directed by laws as fixed as those of the solar 
.system. If a moisture-laden wind passes over the country it leaves 
the land fruitful ; but a dry wind leaves it barren. The currents of air 
are among the most important factors in the physical geography of our 
earth, affecting not only soil and climate but also vegetal and animal life. 

The winds obtain their moisture through evaporation, which goes on 
everywhere and at all times; in the equatorial and polar oceans, from 
the rich cultivated soil and the arid desert, from the valley and the 
snow-clad mountain. Reclus tells us that the evaporation from the 
equatorial ocean is from 13 to 16 feet a year. This estimate is con- 
firmed by the U. S. Geological Survey, which found the evaporation 
from the southern Colorado River to be 102 inches, or nearly 9 feet in 
a year. The quantity of water evaporated from the land must be very 
large, as only about two-fiiths of the rainfall is returned by the rivers 
to the ocean. A great part, i^robably more than one-half of this quan- 
tity, is re-evaporated to fall the second and third time as rain. 

The movements of the atmosphere depend either directly or indi- 
rectly on differences of temperature ; without these difterences the air 
and ocean would be stagnant. There is a constant interchange of 
atmosphere between the equator and the poles. Cool air from the north 
blows toward the equator, first in a southwesterly, then in a westerly 
direction, crossing the Atlantic about the tropic of Cancer. Cool air 
from the south blows in a northwesterly and westerly direction, and 
crosses the Atlantic near the equator. The difterence of solar acces-

266 RELATIONS OF AIR AND WATER TO TEMPERATURE AND LIFE. 

sion between the equator and the poles gives the northward and south- 
ward motion to these currents; the revolution of the earth on its axis 
gives the westerly motion. 

These air currents are the great trade-winds which wafted Columbus 
across the Atlantic and IMagellan across the I'acitic. The trade- winds 
of the nortliern Atlantic are about 20'^ in width from north to south ; 
those of the southern Atlantic are not quite so wide. These winds oscil- 
late northward in August and southward in February, following the 
sun. Between the trade-winds of the north and the trade- winds of the 
south there is a zone of calm. 

While the winds blow over the land as well as over the ocean, their 
movements, interrupted by hills and mountains and attected by tem- 
perature, lose that broad sweep and uniformity so characteristic of the 
ocean. 

Eeturn currents of warm air blow across the ocean from the torrid 
zone toward the northeast in the northern Atlantic, and toward the 
southeast in the southern Atlantic. The trade-winds, or equatorial 
currents, blow around the world from east to west; the polar currents 
blow from west to east. 

The great ocean currents follow the same general courses as the wind 
system. Their movements are initiated by differences in density, caused 
chietiy by temperature and by evaporation ; yet the larger part of the 
motive power is derived from the wind. These movements have been 
ascertaiiu'd by years of observation on vessels in every ocean, sea, and 
gulf, by the cumulative evidence of drifting objects, some of which liave 
had their influence on the spread of vegetal and animal life and even 
civilization itself, and by the researches of scientific exploring expedi- 
tions to polar regions and remote islands. These oceanic movements 
are as well understood as those of the great atmospheric ocean above us. 

When water has acquired its movement, the configuration of the bot- 
tom of the ocean and of the shore line, the rotation of the globe on its 
axis, and the direction and velocity of the wind modify its movement. 

SOUTH AMERICA. 

By this circulation the equatorial waters of the Atlantic blow across 
that ocean, impinge against thecoastof South America, and are deflected 
northward and southward. The southeasterly trade-winds blowing 
over it become surcharged with moisture and pass directly up the val- 
ley of the Amazon, watering the earth with tmpient rains for 2,000 
miles to the foothills of the Andes, where some of this moisture is 
deflected by the mountains southeastward to water southern Brazil; 
the remainder ascends the slopes of the Andes until it is condensed 
and falls as rain and snow, and only dry winds blow across the com- 
paratively narrow plains between the Andes and the Pacific. The vapor 
from the Atlantic falling in rain over the valley of the Amazon and 
along the eastern slope of the Andes and the Cordilleras flows back 



KELATIONS OF AIR AND WATER TO TEMPERATURE AND LIFE. 2G7 

to the ocean through the Orinoco, the Amazon, and la Phxta, and makes 
the interior of South America one of the richest countries of the world. 

The Amazon, a great mediterranean sea, as it is often rightly called, 
is projected into the heart of the continent. Its total fall from the 
foothills of the Cordilleras to the ocean is not over 300 or 400 feet, 
affording for the largest vessels uninterrupted navigation and innumer- 
able harbors for 1,500 miles into the interior and 1,000 miles farther 
for smaller vessels. The aggregate navigable waters of the main 
stream and its tributaries are estimated at 50,000 miles. The moist 
winds abundant!}- water the valley and modify its climate. Their influ- 
ence in tempering the climate is felt directly more than 1,000 miles up 
the valley, and indirectly still farther, through the sliadows thrown by 
the clouds and through the rainfall and the cooling effect of the drops 
of rain falling from a high altitude. It is from 8° to 10^" cooler than 
on either side of this rain belt, and it is more healthful than other 
equatorial regions. Tlie trojiical woods are so thick and the creepers 
and undergrowth so luxuriant that animal life is almost entirely con- 
fined to the trees above and the waters below. Nature has thus far 
been more powerful than man, who has struggled in vain to subdue 
this fertile valley to his use. 

The winds that pass up the valley of Rio de la Plata to the moun- 
tains of Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina are not so heavily charged with 
moisture as those of the Amazon Valley; consequently the thick for- 
ests and dense vegetation gradually disappear, and, instead of an 
inland sea, there are vast planis or pampas over which roam herds that 
could not live in the valley of the Amazon.. Thus the difference in the 
rainfall changes the entire vegetal and animal life. 

Through the center of Soutli America, from the Caribbean Sea to 
the straits of Magellan, there is a vast stretch of lowland through 
which run the waters of the Orinoco, Amazon, and la Plata, with low 
divides between their valleys. A boat can pass up the Orinoco, thence 
by Cassiquiare River to the Rio jSTegro, a branch of the Amazon, thence 
through the Amazon and its branches to a low divide between the val- 
leys of the Amazon and Rio de la Plata. Here there is a carry of 6 or 
8 miles, and then, continuing down la Plata to the Atlantic Ocean, the 
traveller may make a water journey of over 3,000 miles between the 
Cordillera and the eastern plains of South America. 

The easterly currents flowing from the Antartic i)ole are deflected by 
Cape Horn along both the eastern and western coasts of Patagonia. 
On the eastern coast the winds blow offshore, leaving that coast arid. 
The westerly current, as it api)roaches the tropics, is deflected further 
westward and forms the greatest of the equatorial currents. The mois- 
ture of the winds that blow over this Antarctic current is precipitated 
on the cool shores of Patagonia and lower Chile, and these countries are 
correspondingly enriched, while tlie same winds continuing over the 
heated plains of upper Chile, Peru, and southern Ecuador are rarefied 



268 RELATIONS OF AIR AND WATER TO TEMPERATURE AND LIFE 

and take up what little moisture there is in these plains, to be after- 
ward condensed and precipitated on the mountain slopes. 

From this cause the western coast of South America for the 3,000 
miles from lower Chile to upper Ecuador is dry and barren, and would 
be uninhabited except for the mines of gold and silver in the mouutaius 
and the deposits of nitrates and guano along the coast and on the 
islands. Yet the rain fall in South America is greater than in any other 
part of the world, and more than twice as great as the rain-fall in Asia. 

NORTH AMERICA, 

The northern equatorial current, less powerful than the southern, 
crosses the Pacific about the tropic of Cancer, where it is deflected by 
Japan, and flows northward as the Kuroshiwo current, re-crossing the 
Pacific in a northeasterly direction. 

The Pacific Ocean is so wide that it is doubtful if this current would 
reach the American coast were it not for the drift caused by the wind 
which blows across the Pacific with strong and steady force. When it 
strikes the shores of North America it is feebler and has a lower tem- 
perature than the Gulf Stream of the Atlantic Ocean on reaching the 
coast of Euroije. 

The currents of wind strike the coast between the fiftieth and fifty- 
fifth degrees of north latitude, the region of greatest rainfall, and are 
in part deflected northward and southward by the coast range of moun- 
tains; the remaining portion blows over the mountains and uj^ the 
valley of the Columbia. Continual fogs and rains abound on these 
shores, and the coasts of southern Alaska, British Columbia, Washing- 
ton, and Oregon are covered with the densest and largest growth of 
evergreen forest in the world. These winds prevail as far southward 
as the latitude of San Francisco, where the southeasterly trade winds 
commence and blow offshore, leaving southern California and the 
western coast of Central America a zone of calms, <lry and barren. 

While the western coast of the continent is bathed by the waters of 
the Pacific, its eastern shores are washed by the equatorial current of 
the northern Atlantic, which flows around the West India Islands, 
through Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. The trade winds from 
the Gulf of ]\Iexico water the eastern coasts of Central America and Mex- 
ico, and impinging on the mountains of the interior are deflected toward 
the north and east over the Southeastern States and up the Mississippi 
Valley, where they imite with the warm winds which blow directly up 
the valley from the Gulf of Mexico, and water the valley of the Missis- 
sippi. The rainfall in the upper part of the valley is derived largely 
from the Rocky Mountains, the waters of the Pacific carried by the 
winds and deposited on the Ilocky Mountains as rain and snow, being 
again evaporated and carried eastward to fall as rain. 

This great valley extends from Canada southward to the Gulf of 
Mexico, and from the Rocky Mountains eastward to the Alleghauies; 



I 



RELATIONS OF AIR AND WATER TO TEMPERATURE AND LIFE. 269 

it is 1,500 miles long and about 2,000 miles wide, the largest and rich- 
est valley of the temperate zone. 

A very low and narrow divide separates the Mississippi Valley from 
another great valley extending from the Kocky Mountains eastward, 
with a gentle slope to Hudson Bay and the Atlantic. It is as long 
from west to east as the valley of the Mississippi is from north to south, 
and is from 500 to 600 miles wide. The western portion of this plain 
is drained by Saskatchewan Kiver. The winds which blow over this 
valley from the Rocky Mountains in some years water imperfectly the 
western portion of this plain, but with a copious rain-fall the land yields 
abundantly; the eastern portion is watered from Hudson Bay, lakes 
Winnipeg, Manitoba, and the other large lakes of that province. As 
the climate is cold, less rainfall is required than in the valley of the 
Mississippi. 

Another very low divide separates this valley from the great plain, 
2,500 miles long, descending with a gentle slope to the Arctic Ocean, 
through which runs the Mackenzie River. The winds that blow from 
the Arctic Ocean fall in rain and snow in this valley. 

Thus, through the center of America, from the Arctic to the Antar- 
tic Oceans, there are no high elevations, while there is a more uniform 
distribution of rain-fall and temperature than on any other continent. 

From the Arctic Ocean cold currents of water flow along both the 
eastern and western coasts of Greenland and bear immense icebergs 
aiul fields of ice southward until they meet the warm waters of the 
Gulf Stream, when the ice melts, causing fog banks and depositing the 
debris brought from the Arctic glaciers, thus aiding in the making of 
the great fishing banks of Newfoundland. The Arctic current, still 
cold, runs southward inshore from the Gulf Stream, and affects the cli- 
mate of North America to the latitude of New York if not to Cape 
Hatteras. 

From the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf Stream 
passes around Florida and flows along the southern Atlantic States. 
The currents of air from the Gulf Stream blow over slightly cooler 
waters and deposit rain on the eastern side of the Alleghanies and 
water the eastern coast of the United States. 

EUROPE. 

The main Gulf Stream is deflected, by the shape of the ocean bottom 
and the contour of North America, northward and eastward toward 
Europe; but its drift is largely increased by the winds. The drift from 
the southward sets around the North Cape of Norway, 71^^ north lati- 
tude, keeping the coast free from ice all the year round, and is felt in 
the Kara Sea. It is by means of this current that Nansen hopes to 
be borne through the Kara Sea and from the Lena Delta by way of the 
north pole to Greenland. 

The winds that blow over the Gulf Stream water the western coast 



270 RELATIONS OF AIR AND WATER TO TEMPERATURE AND LIFE. 

of France, Great Britam, and Scandiuavia, and temper the cliuiate of 
these northern regions to such a degree that Stockholm and St. Peters- 
burg have become great cities, while in a lower latitude in Labrador, 
on the other side of the Atlantic, "The country is so rocky and rough 
and the temperature so intensely cold in the winter (lower than the 
inhabited parts of Greenland) that Labrador would be worthless and 
uninhabitable except for the seals and hsh." These currents are 
deflected by the coasts of France and Spain toward the west and are 
drifted in different directions by the wind, watering the eastern coasts 
of Spain and Portugal, but having ])recipitated their moisture they 
leave the high lands of Spain dry, cold m winter and hot in summer. 

In the Mediterranean the evaporation is much greater than in the 
Atlantic Ocean ; its water is therefore salt and heavier. To supply this 
loss by evaporation water flows from the Atlantic into the Mediterra- 
nean from west to east as a surface current. The i)rojection of Italy 
and Greece into the sea deflect these currents along each coast of 
both countries. 

The general course of the winds of southern Europe is interrupted by 
the Alps and Apennines in Italy, and by the high mountains in Greece. 
Land and sea breezes water these countries in August and September, 
while the winter snow on the Alps fills the Italian streams in summer 
and irrigates the land through numerous canals. 

A plain, beginning in Holland and Belgium, runs through Germany, 
gradually growing broader, into Eussia, where it is known as the 
Black zone; thence northeastward through a large part of Siberia. It 
is low in the west, gradually rising toward the east, though in Siberia 
its northern margin dips gently beneath the Arctic Ocean. The west- 
ern part of this plain is watered by the winds from the Atlantic and 
from the Is^orth and Baltic seas and the Gulf of Finland. The eastern 
part in Siberia is watered by the winds from the Arctic (-)cean. These 
plains are the granary of Europe and Siberia, although a small part, 
comparatively, of the Siberian plain is good for corn. 

ASIA. 

The regularity in the motion of the currents of air and water pre- 
vailing in the Western Hemisphere and the Atlantic Ocean is apparently 
lacking in Asia and the Indian Ocean. The mountams of America run 
northward and southward, and have little, if any, eflect in originating 
currents of air, and none at all on the ocean currents. In Asia the 
largest and highest mass of mountains in the world runs east and west, 
and from their foothills the great plains of India and China extend to 
the Indian Ocean and the China Sea, bringing a polar climate into close 
contact with the torrid zone. 

Cold winter winds blow from the Himalayas and the high" plateaus 
of central Asia southwestward into Indian Ocean and China Sea and 
drift the waters with them. When the sun turns toward the north in 



RELATIONS OF AIR AND WATER TO TEMPERATURE AND LIFE. 271 

the suininer solstice and the plains in India and China become heated 
by the torrid sun the wind changes and blows toward the northeast. 
At the meeting of the winds the monsoon breaks, and the cyclones of 
India and the typhoons of China follow. They are soon over, and then 
the monsoon blows over Indian Ocean and China Sea. All India, Kash- 
mir, and western Tibet, Farther India, Annam, and eastern China and 
Japan are well watered, 50 inches of rain falling in a year in some parts 
of India. 

In these countries there are generally six months of rainy season and 
six months of dry. In parts of India the water of the rainy season is 
stored in large reservoirs for irrigation in the dry season, while in China 
numerous canals between the different rivers in like manner irrigate the 
land. India and China are among the richest countries of the world 
and have the densest population, though destined to be surpassed in 
the future by the population of the Amazon and Mississippi valleys. 

We have thus seen the effects of the winds and ocean currents in 
modifying the climate and in enriching the great valleys of South Amer 
ica and North America, of Europe, India, China, and Japan. 

DESERTS OR BASINS. 

About one-fifth of the territory in each continent is arid and desert 
land. With one or two possible exceptions these arid regions are basins, 
where the rivers and rain fall either run into salt lakes or are lost in the 
desert and never reach the ocean. These deserts are caused by the 
winds which blow either from colder over warm areas and are there- 
fore dry, or over vast plains or mountainous regions upon which they 
have precipitated their moisture. 

The average rain fall on the great deserts does not exceed 10 inches a 
year, and the evaporation is usually greater than the rain-fall. They 
are situated generally between the twentieth and fortieth degrees of 
north latitude and between the twentieth and thirtieth degrees of south 
latitude. In the northern belt are the Carson and other basins of 
Nevada, the Salt Lake of Utah, the desert of Sahara, Arabia, Persia, 
the Aral-Caspian desert, the Tanin Gobi and Mongolia desert. In the 
southern belt is the desert of Atacama in South America, Kalahari in 
South Africa, and the Australian deserts. These basins in the north- 
ern belt contained formerly lakes much greater than are now found in 
either of the continents. 

Salt Lake was formerly much larger and deeper, for its waters once 
beat upon shores 1,000 feet higher up the mountain sides than at i)res- 
ent. Its waters then found their way to the ocean. This was probably 
in the ice age, when the surrounding mountains were covered with snow 
and great glaciers, and the evaporation was much less than the rain-fall 
and the water from the melting glaciers. 



272 RELATIONS OF AIR AND WATER TO TEMPERATURE AND LIFE. 

lu the desert of Sahara iiuiueroas dry water-courses show where great 
rivers formerly ran iuto Lake Tchad. 

In Asia the Caspian and Aral seas were connected, covering a terri- 
tory many times greater than at present, with an outlet to the Bos- 
phorus and Mediterranean. 

We have not sufficient knowledge of Arabia to know the former con- 
dition of that arid country. The process of desiccation is still going 
on, and how much longer it will continue no one can tell. 

MOUNTAINS OF AMERICA. 

Next we will notice the influence of the mountains on the atmosphere, 
either in enriching or impoverishing a country, or in intensifying the 
movements of the currents of air and water. 

The mountains of America rise at t he Arctic Ocean and from the 
divide between the Mackenzie and Yukon rivers. A second range 
runs from northeastern Alaska through Mount St. Elias. Then these 
two bands extend through British Columbia, gradually widening as 
new ranges arise until they obtain a width of 500 miles at the boundary 
line between British Columbia and the United States, and a width of 
1,000 miles on theline of the Union Pacific Eailroad. These two ranges, 
the Sierra Nevada and the Eocky mountains, come together in southern 
Mexico and extend as a single range through Central America and the 
Isthmus of Panama. On entering South America this range again 
divides, forming the Cordilleran and the Andes systems, and thence 
they extend southward, with a varying width between them of from 
40 to 200 miles. They are connected from east to west by several cross- 
ranges or spurs. From southern Chile the Andes continues as one 
chain through Patagonia and Terra del Fuego to Cape Horn. This is 
the longest and most persistent chain of mountains in the world. The 
peaks gradually rise in height from north to south until in Chile, 
Aconcaqua, 22,427 feet in height, is the culminating point; thence 
southerly the range gradually lowers to an elevation of a few hundred 
feet only at the Straits of Magellan and Cape Horn. Several volcanoes 
in this long range rise to a greater elevation than any of the non- 
volcanic peaks. 

In North America the currents of air from the Pacific Ocean, in 
passing over the Coast, Sierras, and other ranges, deposit a large por- 
tion of their moisture on the mountains. Between these ranges are 
warm valleys, and the winds chilled in crossing the mountains evapo- 
rate the little moisture in these valleys, and they are left dry and arid 
unless irrigated by mountain streams. Thus we have a succession of 
arid valleys and green mountain ranges moistened with rain and snow, 
and rich in forests and vegetation. A number of these valleys are 
inclosed basins, from which the mountain streams have no outlet to 
the ocean and in some of which saline lakes are fouiul.

MOUNTAINS OF ASIA. 

In Asia we liave the largest continent, the highest mountains, the 
most elevated plateaus, and tlie greatest extent of desert land in the 
world. 

The Pamir, or ''roof of the world" — " the abode of the Gods, " as it 
was called by the inhabitants — is a vast plateau of .30,000 square 
miles area, with a north and soutli extension of about 400 miles, and 
with a mean elevation of 12,000 feet. It is traversed by a high range 
of mountains, culminating in the Taghama, 25,500 feet in height. The 
Pamir was the only barrier Alexander could not pass. Now, the 
English, theRussians, and the Chinese meet on this plateau and struggle 
for the control of Asia. From it branch all the great mountain ranges 
of Asia. 

The Hindu Kush range runs west through Afghanistan, between 
Persia and Turkestan, along the southern shore of the Caspian Sea, 
culminating in Blount Ararat, thence as the Caucasus Mountains to 
the Black Sea, while a spur of this chain follows the southern shores of 
the Black Sea to the Mediterranean. The Himalayas run a little south 
of east from the southern part of the Pamir for 1,500 miles, separating- 
India from Tibet and China. 

The Kuen Luen range, sometimes considered as an extension of the 
Hindu Kush, runs from the middle of the Pamir through western and 
part of central China for 2,700 miles. The Thian Shan runs from the 
northern end of the Pamir northeast, separating Tarim and Mongolia 
from Siberia. As it approaches the ocean it turns toward the north 
and ends in Kamchatka, forming the great divide between the waters 
of the Arctic and Paciflc oceans. Between these mountain ranges are 
elevated plateaus, and the former dominate the rainfall and tempera- 
ture of the continent. 

The steeper slope of the mountains of Asia is toward the Indian 
Ocean. Between the Himalayas and Kuen Luen ranges and running 
from the Pamir east is the highest and longest plateau in the world, 
varying from 17,000 to 10,000 feet, its lowest elevation. 

Above this plain the mountains tower from 4,000 to 1S,000 feet. 
Their summits are covered with everlasting snow from 8,000 to 10,000 
feet below their crests. Here is truly the " abode of the snow. " This 
plateau, from its height and position between two ranges of mountains, 
is cold in winter and hot in summer. This is Tibet, the land of the 
Llama. Here all the great rivers that empty into the Pacific and Indian 
oceans, excei^ting the Yukon, the Columl)ia, the Colorado, and the 
Zambesi, have their source. 

In the western part of Tibet the Indus and Brahmaputra rise, one 
running west through a pass 14,000 feet in height into India; the other 
running east, through passes thus far inaccessible and unknown into 
India; east of the head waters of these two rivers rise the rivers of 
Siam and farther India.

274 RELATIONS OF AIR AND WATER TO TEMPERATURE AND LIFE. 

Farther to the iioitbeast rise the great rivers of China, theHoaug ho* 
and Yang-tse-kiang. Their valleys are separated by high chains of 
mountains, extending in a northwest and southeast direction. The 
Hoang-ho runs north and east through the temperate zone of China, 
and the Yang-tse-kiang south and east through the semitropical 
regions of middle China. As they gradually approach, they inclose a 
great valley and become the arteries of the superabundant life of the 
Empire. The eastern 3)art of this great valley, watered by the winds 
from the China Sea, is crossed from northeast to southwest by parallel 
ridges, from which numerous streams descend. The valley of eastern 
China is thus abundantly watered and the rich soil yields bountifu[ 
croi)s. For thousands of years this region has been the home of the 
Chinese, a self-dependent w^orld. It is a limited territory of 1,300 000 
square miles area, no larger than the valley of the Mississippi; yet it 
sustains a population of 400,000 000 or one-third of the people of the 
globe. 

North of the Kuen Luen Mountains, and the valley of the Hoang-ho 
and south of the Thian Shan, is the plateau of the Tarim, sometimes 
called Eastern Turkestan. It is much lower than Tibet, and is trav- 
ersed by cross-ranges of hills or low mountains, through which flows 
the river Tarim. Little rain falls on this plateau, the sand from the 
desert is gradually covering the fertile valleys, the ancient lakes are 
now little more than salt marshes, and where formerly lived bands of 
Huns and Vandals that over-ran Europe, now only a few shepherds find 
a scanty living. This part of the world seems exhausted. '• Without 
a shrub or tree or blade of grass," and no longer fit for the residence 
of man, it has become the sole home of the wild horse and the yak. 
East of this plateau of Tarim are the deserts of Gobi and Mongolia, 
which extend far eastward toward the sea of Japan, a high range of 
mountains separating Mongolia, however, from the seacoast, so that 
only dry winds blow over these great deserts. 

North of the Thian Shan and the Altai mountains is the great i^lniii 
of Siberia. It starts from a lower level than that of the Tarim desert 
and descends Avith a gradual slope northward for 1,500 miles to the 
Arctic Ocean. These plains resemble in some respects the great plains 
of the United States, but the latter slope toward the east and south 
with a climate growing continually wnriner, while the Siberian plains 
slope toward the north, the temperature growing (continually colder. 
The winds in summer blow from the Arctic Ocean over these plains to 
the Altai Mountains, while in the winter they blow from the mountains 
to the ocean. There is a slight evaporation from the Arctic Ocean, but 
the temperature of Siberia is so low and the summers so short that 
the i)lains require comparatively slight rain-fall to fertilize them. 

There is a large portion of Asia, Arabia, Persia, Turkestan, includ- 
ing Caspian and Aral seas, to which we have not particularly referred 
because it is entirely outside of the influence of either the monsoon, 



RELATIONS OF AIR AND WATER TO TEMPERATURE AND LIFE. 275 

trade, or otlier moisturo-beariiig winds. This territory extends from 
Arabia uortlieastward beyond tlie Lake of Balkasli into Siberia, a vast 
extent of conntry, larger than Europe — a dry, rainless desert, hot in 
summer and cold in winter. Part of tills region is from 6,000 to 7,000 
feet above the level of the sea, part below the sea level, yet neither 
height uor depression makes any difterence in this arid land. For- 
merly sections of these countries were thickly populated. The Aral 
and Caspian basins were called the " Garden of the world." In Meso- 
])otamia were Ninevah, Bagdad, and Babylon; in Persia, Susa and 
Persopolis. Historians tell us of great cities, flourishing empires, 
where now is only a barien and sandy desert. We do not know whether 
the climate has changed or whether in ancient days the country was 
thoroughly irrigated, and now through neglect has been buried deep 
in the sand of the desert. Although tbur-hfths of Asia are either 
desert or mountainous land and are only scantily inhabited, two-thirds 
of the population of the world are found within its borders. 



THE WK AGE AND ITS WORK.* 



By A. li. Wallace, F. It. S. 



I. ERRATIC BLOCKS AND ICE SHEETS. 

It is little more tbaii iifty years ago that one of the most potent agents 
in modifying the surface features of our country was first recognized. 
Before 1840, — when Agassiz accompanied Buckland to Scotland, the 
Lake District, and Wales, discovering everywhere the same indications 
of the former presence of glaciers as are to be found so abundantly in 
Switzerland, — no geologist had conceived the possibility of a recent gla- 
cial epoch in the temperate portion of the Northern Hemisphere. From 
that year however a new science came into existence, and it was recog- 
nized that only by a careful study of existing glaciers, of the nature of the 
work they now do, and of the indications of the work they have done in 
past ages, conld we explain many curious phenomena that had hitherto 
been vaguely regarded as indications of diluvial agency. One of the 
first fruits of the new science was the conversion of the author of 
RcUqtikv JMluriancc — Dr. Buckland — who, having studied the work of 
glaciers in Switzerland in company with Agassiz, became convinced 
that numerous phenomena he had observed in this country could only 
be due to the very same causes. In Novembei', 1840, he read a paper 
before the (ieological Society on the " Evidences of glaciers in Scotland 
and the north of England," and from that time to the j^resent the study 
of glaciers and of their work has been systematically pursued with a 
large amount of success. One after another crude theories have been 
abandoned, facts have steadily accumulated, and their logical though 
cautious interpretation has led to a considerable body of well-sup- 
ported inductions on which the new science is becoming firmly estab- 
lished. Some of the most important and far reaching of these induc- 
tions are however still denied by writers who have a wide acquaintance 
with modern glaciers; and as several works have recently ai)peared 
on both sides of the controversy, the time seems appropiiate for a 
popular sketch of the progress of the glacial theory, together with a 
more detailed discussion of some of the most disputed i^oints as to

278 THE ICE AGE AND ITS WORK. 

which it seems to the present wi'iter that souiul reasoning is even 
more re([uire(l than tlie i'urther aecnmnlation of facts.* 

In the hist centnry Swedenborg, Linna'ns, Pallas, De Lnc, and 
many other eminent writers took notice of the remarkable fact tluit 
in Scandinavia, Enssia, Germany, and iSwitzerland detaclied rocks or 
bowlders were found, often in great abundance and of immense size, 
and of a kind that did not exist in situ in the same district, but which 
were often (mly to be discovered in remote localities, sometimes hun 
dreds of miles away. Tbose who ventured to speculate on the origin 
of these travelled rocks usually had recourse to water power to account 
for their removal; and, as their large size and often elevated position 
required some unusual force to carry them, there arose the idea of enor- 
mous Hoods sweeping over whole continents; and for a long time this 
diluvial theory was the only one that appeared to be available, although 
the difticulties of its application to explain all the phenomena became 
greater the more closely those phenomena were studied. Still, there 
was apparently no otlier known or conceivable means of accounting for 
them, and for the enormous mounds of gravel or clay intermixed with 
bowlders which often accom})anied them; and the ehbrts of geologists 
were therefore directed to the discovery of how the water power had 
acted and by what means the supposed Hoods could have been pro- 
duced. 

There were not wanting men who saw that no action of water alone 
could account for the facts. Sir James Hall iiointed this out with 
regard to erratics on the Jura, whose source was undoubtedly in the 
far-distant Alps; and Mr. Grainger, in America, described some of the 
parallel grooves and iiutings runningfornearly amile in Ohio, strongly 
arguing that no action of running water could have produced them, 
but that an agent was required, the direction of whose movement was 
fixed and unalterable for long distances and for a great length of time. 
No light was however thrown on the i^roblem till 1822, when Venetz, 
a Swiss engineer, finding that existing glaciers varied in extent from 
year to year and that historical records showed them to have consider- 
ably increased during the last eight centuries, was further led to 
observe that long before the historical era the glaciers had been 
immensely more extensive, as shown by the smooth and rounded rocks, 
by longitudinal scratches and grooves pointing down the valleys, and 
by numbers of old moraines exactly similar in form and materials to 
those deposited by existing glaciers. He read a paper before the Hel- 
vetic Society of Natural History, and urged that glaciers once stretched

down tlie Rhone Valley as far as the Jura, and there deposited the 
erratic blocks which had so f)iizzled the diluvialists to explain. 

Other writers soon followed the clue thus given. In 1835, Charpen- 
tier, after a close study of the erratic blocks and of their sources, 
adopted the views of Venetz. Agassiz followed, and by his strenuous 
advocacy did much to spread correct views as to the former extension 
of the Alpine glaciers, and their capability of explaining the numerous 
superficial phenomena which in all northern countries had been thought 
to att'ord proofs of enoniKuis floods and of the submergence of a large 
part of Europe under a deep sea. lie has- therefore gained the repu- 
tation of being the originator of the modern school of giacialists, which 
undoubtedly owes much to his energy, research, and powers of exposi- 
tion, though all the more important facts, as well as the logical con- 
clusions to be drawn from them, had been pointed out by previous 
writers. 

Before iiroceeding further, it will be well to give a brief outline of the 
lihenomeua which led to the conclusion that glaciers have formerly 
existed m districts and countries where even perpetual snow on the 
mountain tops is now unknown. These may be briefly classed as (1) 
moraines and drifts; (2) rounded, smoothed, or planed rocks; (3) striae, 
grooves, and furrows on rock-surfaces; (4) erratics and perched blocks. 

(1) Moraines are those heapsorridgesof rock and other debris which 
are deposited on the surface of a glacier from the precipices or moun- 
tain slopes which border it, and which form what are termed lateral 
and medial moraines while upon it, and terminal moraines when, being 
gradually discharged at its end, either from above or from beneath it, 
they form great heaps of rock and gravel corresponding in outline and 
extent to that of the terminal ice-cliff. Such moraines can be seen on 
and near all existing glaciers, and their mode of formation and char- 
acteristics are perfectly well known. - 

(2) Smoothed and rounded rocks, called in Switzerland " roches 
moutonnees," from their supposed resemblance at a distance to sheep 
lying down, are perhaps the most general of all the indications of glacial 
action. Every glacier carries with it, imbedded in its under surface, 
numbers of rocks and stones, which, during the slow but unceasing 
motion over its bed, crush and grind down all rocky projections, pro- 
ducing in the end gently rounded or almost flat surfaces even on the 
hardest and toughest rocks. In many of the valleys of Wales, the Lake 
District, and Scotland every exposed rock has accpiired this character- 
istic outline, and the same feature can he traced on all the rocky slopes 
and often on the summits of the lesser heights; and the explanation of 
how these forms have been produced is not a theory only, but has been 
observed in actual operation in the accessible portions of many glaciers. 
Rocks and stones are to be seen embedded in the ice and actually 
scratching, grooving, and grinding the rock beneath in their slow but 
irresistible onward motion. - - - 



'280 THE ICE AGE AND ITS WORK. 

Oil the whole, considering tlieii abundance in all glaciated regions 
and the amount onntbnuation they give as to the direction and grind- 
ing power of ice, these rounded rocks afford one of the most instructive 
indications of the former presence of glaciers; and we must also agree 
with the couchisiou of Darwin (in a paper written after studying the 
phenomena of ice-action in North Wales, and while fresh from his obser- 
vation of glaciers and icebergs in the Southern Hemisphere) that " one 
of the best criterious between the effects produced by the passage of 
glaciers and of icebergs is boss or dome-shaped rocks." 

(3) Striated, grooved, and tinted rocks, though ciosely connected 
with the preceding, form a distinct kind of evidence of the greatest 
value. Most of the bosses of rock just dcsciibed have been exposed to 
the action of the atmos[>here, perhaps since the ice left them, and have 
thus become more or less roughened or even disintegrated; but where 
the rocks have been protected by a covering of drift, or even of turf, 
and have been recently exposed, they often exhibit numerous i)arallel 
stri;c, varying from the finest scratches to deep furrows a foot or more in 
diameter. - - Perhaps none of the effects of ice so clearly demon- 
strate the action of glaciers as opposed to that of icebergs, owing to 
the general constancy of the direction of the stii.e, and the long dis- 
tances they may be traced up and down slopes, with a steadiness of 
motion and evenness of cutting power which no tloating mass could 
l)ossibly exert. - - - 

(4) Erratic blocks were among the phenomena that first attracted the 
attention of men of science. Large masses of granite and luird ineta- 
morphic rock, which can be traced to Scandinavia, are found scattered 
over the plains of Denmark, Prussia, and northern Germany, where 
they rest either on drift or on quite different formations ol' the Second- 
ary or Tertiary periods. One of these blocks, estimated at 1,500 tons' 
Aveight, lay in a marshy plain near St. Petersburg, and a portion of it 
was used for the pedestal of the statue of Peter the Great. In parts 
of north Germany they are so abundant as to hide the surface of the 
ground, being piled up in irregular masses forming hills of granite 
bowlders, M'hich are often covered with forests of pine, l>irch, and 
juniper. Far south, at Fiirstenwalde southeast of Berlin, there was 
a huge l)lock of Swedish red granite, from one-half of which the gigan- 
tic basinwas wrought which stands before the New ^Museum in that 
city. - - - 

It is however in Switzerland that we find erratic blocks which fur- 
nish us with the most conclusive testimony to the former enormous 
extensicm of glaciers; and as these have been examined with the great- 
est care, and the facts, as well as the main inductions from the facts, 
are generally admitted by all modern writers, it will be well to consider 
them somewhat in detail. It will be found that they give us most 
valuable information both as to the depth and extension of ancient 
glaciers, and also as to tlie possiltilities of motion in extensive ice- 
sheets. 



THE ICE AGE AND ITS WORK. 281 

The. most important of these facts relate to the erratic blocks from 
tlie higher Alps, which are found on the flanks of the Jura Moun- 
tains wholly formed of limestone, on which it is therefore easy to recog- 
nize the granites, slates, and metamorphic rocks of the Alpine chain. 
These erratic blocks extend along the Jura range for a distance of 100 
miles, and up to a heiglit of li,015 feet above the Lake of Neufchatel. 
The tirst important point to notice is that this highest elevation is 
attained at a spot exactly opposite, and lu the same direction as, the 
Rhone Valley, between Martigny and the head of the Lake of Geneva, 
while north or south of this point they gradually decline in elevation 
to about 500 feet above the lake. The blocks at the highest elevation 
and central point can be traced to the eastern shoulder of Mont Blanc. 
All those to the southwest come from the left hand side of the Lower 
Rhone Valley, while those to the northeast are all from the left side of 
the Upper Rhone Valley and its tributaries. Other rocks coining from 
right-hand side of the Ui)per Rhone Valley are found on the right- 
hand or Bernese side of the great valley between the Jura and the 
Bernese Alps.* 

Now. this peculiar and definite distribution, which has been worked 
out with the greatest care by numerous Swiss geologists, is a necessary 
consequence of well known laws of glacier motion. The debris from 
the two sides of the main valley form lateral moraines which, however 
much the glacier may afterwards be contracted or spread out, keep 
their relative position unchanged. Each important tributary glacier 
brings in other lateral moraines, and thus when the combined glacier 
ultimately spreads out in a great lowland valley the several moraines 
will also spread out, while keeping their relative position, and never 
crossing o\ er to mingle with each other. So soon as this definite posi- 
tion of the erratics was worked out it became evident that the first 
explanation — of a great submergence, during which the lower Swiss 
valleys were arms of the sea and the Rhone glacier broke off in ice- 
bergs, which carried the erratics across to the Jura — was altogether 
untenable, and that the original explanation of Venetz and Charpen- 
tier was the true one. - - - 

We must now consider brietiy the distribution of erratics in North 
America, because they present some peculiar features and teach us 
much concerning the possibilities of glacier motion. 

An immense area of the Northeastern States, extending south to 
New York, and then westward in an irregular line to Cincinnati and 
St. Louis, is almost wholly covered with a deposit of drift material, in 
which rocks of various sizes are embedded, while other rocks, often of 
enormous size, lie upon the surface. These blocks have been carefully 
studied by the American geologists, and they present us with some 
very interesting facts. Not only are the distances from which they have 
been transported very great, but in very many cases they are found at 



* A map showing the lines of dispersiil of these erratics is ^iven in I^yell's Antiq- 
uittj of Men, p. 344, and is reproiliicfil in my Island Life, p. 111. 



282 THE ICE AGE AND ITS WORK. 

a greater elevation than tlie i)lace from wliicli they must have come. 
l*rof. G. F. Wright found an enonnoiivS accuniulation of bowlders on a 
sandstone plateau in Monroe County, Pa. Many of th#se bowlders 
were granite, and must have come either from the ^Vdirondack Moun- 
tains, 200 miles to the north, or from the Canadian Highlands, still 
farther away. This accunudation of bowlders was 70 or 80 feet high, 
and it extended many miles, descending into a deep valley 1,000 feet 
below the i)lateau in a nearly continuous line, forming ])art of the 
southern moraine of the great American ice sheet. 

On the Kentucky hills, about lli miles south of Cincinnati, conglom- 
erate bowlders containing" pebbles of red jasper can be tiaced to a 
limited outcro}» of the same rock in Canada to the n(»rth of Lake 
Huron, more tliau 000 miles distant, and similar bowldeis Ikia e been 
found at intervals over the whole intervening country. In both these 
cases the blocks must have passed over intervening valleys and hills, 
the latter as high or nearly as high as the source from whence the 
rocks were derived. Even more remarkable are numereus bowlders of 
Hclderberg limestone on the summit of the Blue Ridge, in Pennsyl- 
vania, Avhich must have been brought from ledges at least 500 feet 
lower than the places upon whi(;h they now lie. The Blue Ridge itself 
shows remarkable signs of glacial abrasion, in a well-defined shoulder 
marking the southern limit of the ice (as indicated also by heapsof 
drift and erratics), so that Mr. Wright concludes that several hundred 
feet of the ridge have been worn away by the ice. 

The crowning example of bowlder transportation is however a ffoidcd 
by the blocks of light-gray gneiss discovered by Prof. Hitchcock on the 
summit of Mount Washington, over 0,000 feet above sea level, and 
identified with Bethlehem gneiss, whose nearest outcrop is in Jetter- 
son, several miles to the northwest, and 3,000 or 4,000 feet lower than 
Mount Washington. 

These varied phenomena of erratic blocks and rock striations, 
together with the enormous (luantity of bowlder clay and glacial diift 
spread over the whole of the Kastein States, terminating southward in 
a more or less abrupt line of mounds having all the characteristics of 
an enormous moraine, have led American geologists to certain definite 
com-lusions in which they all practically agree. It may be well thst to 
give a notion of the enormous amount of the glacial debris under which 
a large part of the Eastern States is buried. In New England these 
deposits are of less thickness than farther south, averaging from 10 to 
20 feet over the whole area. In Pennsylvania and New York, east of 
the Alleghanies, the deposits are very irregular, often CO or 70 feet 
thick and sometimes more. West of the Alleghanies, in New York, 
Pennsylvania, and Ohio, the thickness is nun-li greater, being often 150 
or l!00teet in the wide valleys and 10 or 50 feet on many of the uplands. 
Prof. Newberry calculates that in Ohio it averages GO feet deep over an 
area of 25,000 square miles. 



THE ICE AGE AND ITS WORK. 283 

The direction of tlie stria' and of the travelled bowlders, togctlier with 
thi^ form of the great tenniiial moraines, show that there must "have 
been two mai^i centers of outflow for the ice sheet, one over Labrador, 
the other over the Laurentian Highlands north of Lake Superior. The 
southern margin of the drift may be roughly represented by portions 
of circles drawn from these two points as centers. The erratics on the 
summit of Mount Washington show that the ice sheet must have been 
a mile thick in its neighborliood, and much thicker at the centers of 
dispersion, while the massesof drift and erratics on plateaus 2,(^^^*' ^^^^4^ 
high near its southern boundary indicate a great thickness at the ter- 
mination. The Laurentian plateau is now abont 2,000 feet above the 
sea level, but there are numerous indications from buried river (dian- 
nels, filled with drift and fiir below the sea, which lead to the conclu- 
sion that during the Ice Age the land was nmch higher. That snow 
can accnnudate to an enormous extent over land of moderate height 
when the conditions are favorable for such an accumulation is shown 
by the case of Greenland, the greater part of whose surface is a vast 
plateau of ice flowing outward by numerous glaciers into the sea. The 
center of this plateau where Dr. jSTansen crossed it was over l»,O00 feet 
above sea-level, and it may be very much higher farther north. It 
therefore seems prol)able that the great American ice sheet was at 
least as high, and perhaps much liigher, and this would give sufficient 
slope for the flow to the sonthern border. Of course, during the suc- 
cessive stages of the glaciation there may have been numerons local 
centeis from which glaciers radiated, and during the passing away of 
the Ice Age these local glaciers would have left strijB and other indi- 
cations of their presence. But so much of the area covered by the 
drift — all in fact south of the New England mountains and the Great 
Lakes — is nndulatiug ground, hill, valley, and plateau of modeiate 
height; that here all the phenomena seem to be due to the great con- 
fluent ice sheet during the various phases of its advanceand its passing 
awny. - - - 

It will now be well briefly to sketch the distribution of erratic blocks 
in Great Britain, and the conclusions to be drawn from them as to the 
former existence of an ice sheet under which the greater part of our 
islands was bnried. 

Every mountain group north of the Bristol Channel was a center 
from which, in the earlier and later phases of the Ice Age, glaciers radi- 
ated ; but many facts prove that during its maximum development these 
separate glacier systems became confluent, and formed extensive ice 
sheets, which overflowed into the Atlantic Ocean on the west and spread 
far over the English lowlands on the east and south. This is indicated 
l)artly by the great height at which glacial striie are found, reaching to 
2,500 feet in the lake district and in Ireland, somewhat higher in North 
Wales, and in Scotland to nearly 3,500 feet; but also by the extraordi- 
nary distribution of erratic blocks, many of which can be traced to locali- 



284 THE ICE AGE AND* ITS WORK. 

ties wlieiioe tliey coukl only have been bronght across tlie sea. The 
direction of the glacial stii;e and of the smoothed side of ice- worn rocks 
also indicate that the shallow seas were all filled up by ice. - - On all 
sides of Ireland, except the sonthern coast, the ice flowed outward, but 
on the ncH'theast the flow was diverted southward, and on the extreme 
north, westward, by the pressure of the overflowing ice sheet of Scot- 
land which here encountered it. In like manner, the ice marks on the 
east coast of Ireland and the west coast of Wales are diverted south- 
ward by the mutual pressure of their ice sheets, which, together with 
that of the west of Scotland, filled up St. George's Channel. That such 
was the case is further ])roved by the fact that the Isle of Man is ice- 
bound in a general direction from north to south, and to the summit 
of its loftiest mountains, which rise to a height of over 2,000 feet. This 
could only have been done by an ice sheet flowing over it, and this view 
is further sui)ported by some most remarkable facts in the dispersal 
of local erratics. These are always found to the south of the places 
where they occur in situ, never to the north; and, what is still more 
noteworthy, they are often found far above the native rock. Thus 
bowlders of the peculiar Foxdale granite are fonnd about 1,400 feet 
higher than the highest point where there is an outcrop of this rock. 

The Scotch ice sheet flowed outward on all sides, bnt on the east it 
was met by the southward extension of the great Scandinavian ice 
sheet. On the extreme north the meeting of these two ice sheets 
resulted in a flow to the northwest which glaciated the Orkney Islands, 
wliile the Shetlands, much farther north, received the full impact of 
the Scandinavian ice alone, and are therefore glaciated from the north- 
east. The dividing line of the Scotch and Scandinavian ice sheets was 
in the North Sea, not far from the east coast of Scotland; but farther 
south, at Flamborough Head and Holderness, the latter impinged on 
our coast, bringing with it enormous quantities of Scandinavian rocks. 
Many years ago Prof. Sedgwick described the clift's of bowlder clay at 
Holderness as containing " an incredible number of smooth round 
blocks of granite, gneiss, greenstone, mica slate, etc., resembling none 
of the rocks of England, but resembling specimens derived from vari- 
ous i)arts of the great Scandinavian chain." These are mixed how- 
ever with a number of British rocks from the north and west, indi- 
cating the meeting ground of the two conflicting ice sheets. Similar 
blocks occur all along the coast as far as the cliffs of Cromer in Norfolk. 
Across the peninsula of Flamborough about 2 miles west of the light- 
house there is a moraine ridge containing a few Scandinavian bowlders, 
but mainly composed of British rocks. These latter consist of numer- 
ous carboniferous rocks from the north and northwest, together with 
many of Shap granite — a peculiar rock found only on Shap Fell, in the 
eastern side of the Lake District, together with a few of Galloway 
granite. These facts, it will be seen, add further confirmation to the 
theory of great confluent ice .sheets indicated by the ice-markings upon 



THE ICE AGE AND ITS WORK. 285 

the Viiriuus groups of mountains, Avhile it is liopelessly impossible to 
explain them on any theory of h^cal glaciers, even with the aid of sub- 
mergence and of floating' ice. - - - 

The center of the great glacier sheet of North Wales api)earsto have 
been over the Arenig Mountains, whence erratics of a peculiar volcanic 
rock have been traced to the north and east, mingling with the last- 
described group ; while a distinct train of these Welsh erratics stretches 
southeastward to the country west of Birmingham. 

In the Isle of Man are found many erratics from Galloway and a few 
from the Lake District. But th(» most remarkable are those of a very 
peculiar rock found only on Ailsa Craig, a small island in the Frith of 
Clyde, and a single bowlder of a peculiar i)itchstone found only in the 
Isle of Arran. The Ailsa Craig rock has also been found at Moel Try- 
faen, on the west side of Snow don, and more recently at Killiney County, 
Dublin, on the seashore.* 

The case of the bowlders in the Isle of Man, wiiicli have been carried 
nearly 800 feet above their source, has already been mentioned, but 
there are many other examples of this phenomenon in our islands; and 
as they are of great importance in regard to the general theory of glacial 
motion, a few of them may be noted here. So early as 181 8 Mr. Weaver 
described a granite block on the top of Cronebane, a slate hill in Ireland, 
and several hundred feet higher than any place where similar granite 
was to be found in siin; and he also noticed several deposits of lime- 
stone gravel in places from 300 to 400 feet higher than the beds of lime- 
stone rock, which are from 2 to 10 miles off. Debris of red sandstone is 
also found much higher than the parent rock. Bowlders of Shap gran- 
ite, Mr. Kendal tells us, have passed over Stainmoor by tens of thou- 
sands, and in doing so have been carried about 200 feet above their 
source; and the curious Permian rock, "Brockram," has been carried 
in the same direction no less than 1,000 feet higher than its higluist 
point of origin. t In Scandinavia there are still more striking examples, 
erratic blocks having been found at an elevation ot 4,500 feet, which 
could not possibly have come from any place higher than 1,800 feet.t 
We thus find clear and absolute demonstration of glacier ice moving 
u})hill and dragging with it rocks from lower levels to elevations vary- 
ing from 200 to 2,700 feet above their origin. In Switzerland we have 
proof of the same general fact in the terminal moraine of the northern 
branch of the Rhone glacier being about 200 feet higher than the Lake 
of Geneva, with very much higher intervening ground. - - - 

The facts thus established render it more easy for us to accept one 
of the latest conclusions of British glacialists, A great submergence 
of a large portion of the British Isles during the glacial period, or in 
the interval between successive phases of the glacial period, has long

286 THE ICE AGE AND ITS WORK. 

been accepted by geologists, and maps liave been often published 
showing- tlie small group of islands to which our country was then 
reduced, the supposed subsidence being about 1,400 feet. The evidence 
for this is the occurrence at a few spots of glacial gravels containing 
marine shells in tolerable abundance, the most celebrated being at Mod 
Tryfaoi, on the west side of Snowdon, at a height of more than l,30l> 
feet. Shell- bearing drifts have also been found near Macclestield at a 
height of over 1,100 feet, and to the east of Manchester at between 500 
and 000 feet elevation. Others have since been found on Gloppa,a hill 
near Oswestry. The fact that the shell -bearing gravels of Moel Try- 
faen are nearly 40 feet thick shows that, if they are due to submerg- 
ence, the land must have remained stationary at that level for a con- 
siderable iieriod of time, and there would probably be other stationary 
periods at lower levels. Yet nowhere in the valleys or on the hill slopes 
of Wales, or the Lake District, or in the English lowlands are there any 
of the old beaclies or sea cliffs, or marine deposits of any kind, that 
must have been formed during such a subsidence and which can hardly 
have been everywhere cleared away by subsequentglaciation. Another 
difficulty is that the shells of these drifts are such as could not have 
lived together on one spot, some being northern species, others southern, 
some frequenting sandy, others muddy bottoms, some which live only 
below tidal water, while others are shore species. And, lastly, they 
are very fragmentary, only a small percentage of entire shells being 
found. - - - 

11. EROSION OF LAKE BASINS. 

Lakes are distributed very unequally over the various parts of the 
world, and they also differ nuich m their position in relation to other 
j)hysical peculiarities of the surface. Most of the great continents 
have a considerable number of lakes, many of great size, situated on 
jilateaus or in central basins ; while the northern parts of Europe and 
North America are thickly strewn with lakes of various dimensions, 
some on the plains, others in sub-alpine valleys, others again high up 
among the mountains, these latter being of small size and usually 
called tarns. The three classes of lakes last mentioned occur in the 
greatest profusion in glaciated districts, while they are almost absent 
elsewhere; and it was this peculiarity of general distribution, together 
with the observation that all the valley lakes of Switzerland and of 
our own country occurred in the track of the old glaciers, and in situa- 
tions where the erosive power of the ice would tend to form rock closed 
basins, that appears to have led the late Sir Andrew Eamsay to formu- 
late his theory of ice erosion to explain them. He was further greatly 
influenced by the extreme difficulty or complete inadequacy of any pos- 
sible alternative theory, — a difficulty which we shall see remains as 
great now as at the time he wrote. 

This question of the origin of the lake basins of the glaciated regions 



THE ICE AGE AND ITS WORK. 287 

is especially interesting on account of the extreme divergence of opin- 
ion that still prevails on the subject. While the general facts of gla- 
ciation, the extent and thickness of the old glaciers and ice sheets, and 
the work they did in distributing huge erratics many hundred miles 
from their sources and in covering thousands of square miles of coun- 
try with thick layers of l)owlder clay and drift, are all admitted as 
beyond dispute, geologists are still divided into two hostile camps when 
the origin of lake basins is concerned; and the opposing forces seem 
to be approximately e(]ual. Having for many years given much atten- 
tion to this problem, which has had for me a kind of fascination, I am 
convinced that the evidence in favor of giaciation has not been set 
forth in all its cumulative force, while many of the arguments against 
it seem to me to be either illogical or beside the point at issue. I have 
also to adduce certain considerations which have hitherto been over- 
looked, but which appear to me to aftbrd very strong if not conclusive 
evidence for erosion as against any alternative theory yet proposed. I 
shall therefore first set forth, as fully as the space at my command 
will allow, the general evidence in favor of the ice origin of certain 
classes of lakes, and the sjiecial conditions requisite for the produc- 
tion of lakes by this agency. The objections of the best authorities 
will then be considered and replied to, and the extreme difficulties of 
the alternative theories will be pointed out. I shall then describe cer- 
tain peculiarities, hitherto unnoticed, which clearly point to erosion, as 
opposed to any form of subsidence and uj)heaval, in the formation of 
the lakes in question. Lastly, the special case of the Lake of Geneva 
will be discussed as affording a battle-ground that Mill be admitted to 
be highly favorable to the anti-glacialists, since most of them have 
adduced it as being entirely beyond the powers of the ancient glaciers 
to have produced. 

1. The different kinds of lakes and their distribution. — To clear the 
ground at the outset, it may be well to state that the great plateau 
lakes of various parts of the world have no doubt been formed by 
some kind of earth movements occurring subsequent to the upheaval 
and partial denudation of the country. It is universally admitted 
that existing lakes can not be very ancient, geologically speaking, since 
they w^ould inevitably be filled up by the sediment carried into them 
by the streams and by the wind. Our lakes must therefore be quite 
modern features of the earth's surface. A considerable proportion of 
these plateau lakes are in regions of little rain-fall, and manj' of them 
have no outlet. The latter circumstance is a consequence of the for- 
mer, since it indicates that evaporation balances the inflow. This 
would have favored the formation of such lakes, since it would have 
prevented the overflow of the water from the slight hollow first 
formed, and the cutting of an outlet gorge which would empty the 
incipient lake. Capt. Dutton, in his account of the geology of the 
Grand Canyon district, lays stress on this fact, " that the elevation of 



288 THE ICE AGE AND ITS WORK. 

a platform across tlie track of a river rarely diverts it from its course, 
for the stream saws its bed into the rocks as fast as the obstacle rises." 
Scanty raiu-fall and great evaporation seem therefore to be almost 
essential to the formation of the larger plateau lakes. Earely, such 
lakes may have been formed in comparatively -well -watered districts, 
but the earth movements must in these cases have been exceptionally 
rapid and extensive, and they are accordingly found most often in 
countries subject to volcanic disturbances. Such are the lakes of 
southern Italy, of Macedonia, of Asia Minor, and perhaps those of 
central Africa. 

Quite distinct from these are the sub-alpine lakes of those mountain 
groups which have been subject to extreme glaciation. These are 
cbaracteristically valley lakes, occurring" in the lower portions of the 
valleys which have been the beds of enormous glaciers, their fre- 
quency, their size, and their depth bearing some relation to the form 
and slope of the valleys and the intensity of the glaciation to which 
they have been subject. In our own country we have in Wales a small 
number of valley lakes; in the lake district, where the ice sheet can 
be i)roved to have been much thicker and to have lasted longer, we 
have more numerous, larger, and deeper lakes; and in Scotland, still 
more severely glaciated, the lakes are yet more numerous, many of 
those in the west opening out to the sea and forming the lochs and 
sounds of the western highlands. Coming to Switzerland, which, as 
we have seen, bears indications of glaciation on a most gigantic scale, 
we find a grand series of valley lakes both on the north and south, 
situated for the most part in the tracks of those enormous glaciers 
whoso former existence and great development is clearly proved by the 
vast morames of northern Italy and the travelled blocks of Switzer- 
land and France. In Scandinavia, where the ice age reigned longest 
and with greatest power, lakes abound in almost all the valleys of the 
eastern slope, while on the west the fiords or submerged lakes are 
equally characteristic. 

In North America, to the south of the St. Lawrence Itiver and of lakes 
Ontario and Erie, there are numbers of true valley lakes, as there are 
also in Canada, besides innumerable others scattered over the open 
country, especially in thejSTorth, where the ice sheet must have been 
thickest and have lingered longest. And in the southern hemisphere 
we have, in New Zealand, a reproduction of these phenomena — a grand 
mountain range with existing glaciers, indications that these glaciers 
were recently much more extensive, a series of fine valley lakes form- 
ing a true lake district, rivaling that of Switzerland in extent and 
beauty, with fiords on the southwest coast comparable with those of 
Norway. 

Besides these valley lakes there are two other kinds of lakes always 
found in strongly glaciated regions. These are alpine tarns — small 
lakes occurring at high elevations and very often at the heads of valleys 



THE ICE AGE AND IT8 WORK. 289 

under lofty precipices ; and small or large plateau or low level lakes 
which occur literally by thousands in northern Canada, in Sweden, Fin- 
laud, Lapland, and northwestern Russia. The valley lakes and the 
alpine tarus are admitted by all geologists to be mostly true rock basins, 
while the plateau and low country lakes are many of them hollows in 
the drift with which much of the country is covered, though rock basins 
are also not un frequent. 

Here then we see a remarkable association of lakes of various kinds 
with highly glaciated regions. The question is whether there is any 
relation of cause and effect in the association ; and to determine this 
we must take a rapid survey of other mountain regions where indica- 
tions of ice action are comparatively slight or altogether wanting, and 
see whether similar lakes occur there also. The comparison will, I 
think, prove very instructive. 

Spain and Portugal are preeminently mountainous countries, there 
being a successi<m of distinct ranges and isolated mountain groups from 
east to west and from north to south; yet there is not a single valley 
lake in the whole i)eninsula, and but very few mountain tarns, Sar- 
dinia and Corsica are wholly mountainous, but they do not appear to 
possess a single valley lake. Nor does the whole range of the Appe- 
nines, though there are many large plateau lakes in southern Italy. 
Farther south we have the lofty Atlas Mountain, but giving rise to no 
subalpine valley lakes. The innumerable mountains and valleys of 
Asia Minor have no lakes but those of the plateaus; neither has the 
grand range of the Lebanon, 100 miles long, and giving rise to an 
abundance of rivers. Turning to the peninsula of India we have the 
ranges of the Ghauts, 800 miles long, the mountain mass of the Neil- 
gherries and that of Ceylon, ail without such lakes as we are seeking, 
though Ceylon has a few i)lateau lakes in the north. The same phe- 
nomenon meets us in Soutli Africa and Madagascar — abundance of 
mountains and rivers, but no valley lakes. In Australia, again, the 
whole great range of mountains from the uplands of Victoria, through 
New South Wales and Queensland to the peninsula of Cape York, has 
not a single true valley lake. Turning now to the New World, we find 
no valley lakes in the southern Alleghanies, while the grand mountains 
of Mexico and Central America have a few plateau lakes, but none of 
the class we are seeking. The extremely mountainous islands of the 
West Indies — Cuba, Hayti, and Jamaica — are equally deficient. In 
South xVmerica we have on the east the two great mountain systems of 
Guiana and Brazil, furrowed with valleys and rich in mountain streams, 
but none of these are adorned with lakes. And, lastly, the grand 
ranges of the equatorial Andes, for 10 degrees on each side of the 
Equator, produce only a few small lakes on the high plateaus, and a 
few in the great lowland river plains — probably the sites of old river 
channels — but no valley lakes in any way comparable with those of 
Switzerland or even of our own insignificant mountains. - - -

290 THE ICE AGE AND ITS WORK. 

2. The conditions that favor the production of lal-es by ice erosion. — 
Those who oppose the production of lake basins by ice erosion often 
argue as if the size of the glacier was the only factor, and urge that 
because there are no lake basins in one valley where large glaciers 
have been at work, those which exist in another valley where the 
glaciers were no larger, could not have been produced by them. But 
this by no ineans follows, because the production of a lake basin depends 
on a combination of favorable conditions. In the tirst place it is evi 
dent that ice erosion to some extent must have taken pla<'e along the 
whole length of the glacier's course, and that in many cases the result 
might be simply to deepen the valley all along, not quite equally, perhaps, 
but with no such extreme differences as to produce a lake basin. This 
would especially be the case if a valley had a considerable downward 
slope, and was not very unequal in width or in the nature of the rocks 
forming its floor. The first essential to lake erosion is, therefore, a 
differential action, caused locally either by increased thickness of the 
ice, a more o])en and level valley floor, or a more easily eroded rock, or 
by any combination of these. - - - 

It must always be remembered that glacial erosion is produced by 
the tremendous vertical pressure of the ice, by its lower strata.being 
tliickly loaded with hard rocks frozen into its mass, and by its slow 
but continuous motion. In the lower part of its course a glacier would 
be most charged with rocky debris in its under strata, since not only 
would it have been continually breaking ofl' and absorbing', as it were, 
fresh material during every mile of its onward course, but more and 
more of its superficial moraines would be engulfed by crevasses or 
moulins, and be added to the grinding material below\ That this was 
so is proved by the great quantity of stones and grit in the "till," 
which is thought by Prof. James Geikie to consist, on the average, of 
as much stony matter as clay, sometimes one material i)re])onderating, 
sometimes the other. The same thing is indicated by the enormous 
amount of debris often found on tlie lower parts of large glaciers. 
The end of the great Tasman glacier in New Zealand is thus com- 
pletely hidden for 5 miles, and most of the other glaciers descending 
from Mount Cook have their extremities similarly buried in debris. 
Dr. Diener found the Milam glacier in the Central Himalayas com- 
l)letely covered with moraine rubbish; and Mr. W. M. Conway states 
that the lowest 20 miles of the Hispar glacier (40 miles long) are 
"entirely covered with a mantle of moraine." If these glaciers 
extended to over 100 miles long, as did the Rhone glacier when it 
reached the lake of Geneva, much of this debris would probably ha\e 
found its way to the bottom, and thus sup])ly the necessary grinding 
material and the abundant stones of the "till" found everywhere in 
the trades of the old glaciers. 

Again, althongh ice is viscous and can slowly change its sliape to 
almost any extent, yet it takes a considerable time to adapt itself to 



.THE ICE AGE AND ITS WORK. 291 

continually changing- outlines of tlie valley bottom. Hence, where 
great inequalities occur portions of the rocky floor might be bridged 
over for a considerable s[)ace, and wliere a valley had a narrow 
V-shaped bottom the sub glacial stream might eat away so much of 
the ice that the glacier juight rest wholly on the lateral slopes, and 
hardly touch the bottom at all. On a tolerably wide and level valley 
bottom, however, the ice would press with its fullest intensity, and 
its armature of densely jiacked stones and rock frngments would 
groove and grind the rocky floor over every foot of its surface, and 
with a rate of motion perhaps greater than that of the existing Green- 
land and Alaskan glaciers, owiug to the more southern latitude and 
therefore higher mean temperature of the soil and the ice. At the same 
time sub-glacial streams, forced onward under great hydrostatic pres- 
sure, would insinuate themselves into every vacant groove and furrow 
as each graving tool successively passed on and the one behind it took 
a slightly difterent position; and thus the glacial mud, the product of 
the erosion, would be continually washed away, finally escaping at the 
lower extremity of the glacier, or in some cases getting embayed in 
rocky hollows where it might remain permanently as masses of clayey 
"till," packed with stones and compressed by the weight of the ice to 
the hardness of rock itself. The continual lubrication of the whole 
valley floor by water forced onward under pressure, together with the 
ever changing form of the under surface of the glacier as it slowly 
molded itself to the varying contours of the rocks beneath, would 
greatly facilitate the onward motion. Owing to these changes of form 
and the great upward i)ressure of the water iu all the hollows to which 
it gained access, it seems j)robable that at any one time not more than 
half the entire bottom surface of the glacier would be in actual contact 
with the rock, thus greatly reducing the friction; while, as the process 
of erosion went on, the rock surfaces would become continually smoother 
and the inequalities less pronounced, so that even when a rock basin 
had been ground out to a considerable depth the onward motion might 
be almost as great as at the beginning of the process. - - - 

3. Ohjeetions of modern writers considered. — Prof Bonney and many 
other writers ask why lakes are so few, though all the chief valleys of 
the Alps were tilled with ice; and why, for instance, there is no great 
lake in the Dora Baltea Valley whose glacier produced the great moraines 
of Ivrea opposite its outlet into the plains of Italy, and which form 
a chain of hills 15 miles long and l,r)00 feet high? The answer, in the 
case of the Dora Baltea, is not diflicult, since it almost certainly has 
had a series of lake basins at Aosta, Verrex, and other places where 
the broad level valley is now filled with alluvial gravel. But the more 
important point is the extreme narrowness of the lower part of the val- 
ley above Donnas and again near its entrance into the valley of the 
Po. The effect of this would be that the great glacier, ])robably 2,000 
feet thick or more, would move rapidly in its upper layers, carrying- out 



292 THE ICE AGE AND ITS WORK. . 

its load of stoues and debris to form tlie terminal moraine, while the 
lower strata cliokedin thedetiles, would move very slo^^ly. And once 
out ill the open valley of the Po, then a great inlet of the warm jVfedi- 
terranean Sea, the ice would rapidly melt away in the water and in the 
warm moist atn^osphere. and therefore have no tendency to erode a 
lake basin. - - - 

4. The alternative theory and its di^cuUies. — There is really only one 
alternative theory to that of ice erosion for the origin of the class of 
lakes we have been discussing, viz, that they were formed before the 
glacial epoch, by earth-movements of the same nature as those which 
are concerned in mountain formation ; that is, by lateral pressure caus- 
ing folds or tiexures of the surface, and where such tiexures occurred 
across a valley a lake would be the result. - - 

As this theory is put forward with so much confidence, and by geolo- 
gists of such high rei)utation, 1 feel bound to devote some space to its 
consideration, and shall, I thiidv, be al)le to show that it breaks down 
on close examination. 

In the first place, it does not attem])t to exi)lain that wonderful 
absence ol valley lakes from all the mountain regions of the world except 
those which have been highly glaciated. It is no doubt true that 
during the time the lakes were tilled with ice instead of water they 
would be preserved from filling up by the iiifiux of sediment; and this 
may be fairly claimed as a reason Avhy lakes of this class should be 
somewhat more numerous m glaciated regions, but it does not in any 
way explain their total absence elsewhere. We are asked to believe 
that m the period immediately preceding the glacial epoch — say, in the 
newer Pliocene period, — earth -movements of a nature to produce deep 
lakes occurred in every mountain range without exception that was 
about to be subject to severe glaciation, and not only so, but occurred 
on both sides of each range, as in the Alps, or all round a mountain 
range, as in our lake district, or in every part of a comi)lex mountain 
region, as in Scotland from the Frith of Clyde to the extreme north 
coast — all in this very limited period of geological time. AVe are further 
asked to believe that during the whole period, from the commencement 
of the ice age to our day, such earth -movements have never produced a 
single group of valley lakes in any one of the countless mountain ranges 
and hilly regions throughout the whole of the very much more extensive 
nonglaciated regions of the globe. This appears to me to be simply 
incredible. The only way to get over the difficulty is to suppose that 
earth-movements of this nature occurred only at that one period, just 
before the ice age came on, and that the lakes produced by them in all 
other regions have siiu^e been filled up. But is there any evidence of 
this? And is it probable that all hikes so produced in non-glaciated 
regions, however large and deep they might be, and however little 
sediment was carried down by their infiowing streams, should yet all 
have disappeared. The theory of the ])rcglacial origin of these lakes thus 



ri 



THE ICE AGE AND ITS WORK. 293 

rests upon a series of liiglily improbable suppositions entirely unsup- 
ported by any appeal to facts. Tiiere is however another difficulty 
which is perhaps even greater than those just considered. Whatever 
may be the causes of the compression, elevation, folding, and other earth 
movements wliicdi liave led to the formation of mountain masses, there 
can be no doubt tluit they have operated with extreme slowness; and 
all the evidence we have of surface movements now going on show that 
they are so slow as to be detected only by careful and long-continued 
observations. On tlie other hand, the action of rivers in cutting down 
rocky barriers is comparatively rapid, especially when, as in all moun- 
tainous countries, they carry in their waters large quantities of sediment, 
and during floods bring down also al)undanceof sand, gravel, and large 
stones. - - 

It is in fact only on account of this powerful agency that we do not 
tind valley lakes abounding in every mountainous country, since it is 
quite certain that earth-movements of various kinds nuist have been 
continually taking place. But if rivers have always been able to keep 
their channels clear, during such movements, among the mountains of 
the tropics and of all warm countries, some reason must be found lor 
their inability to do so in the Alps and in Scotland, in Cumberland, 
Wales, and southern New Zealand; and as no reason is alleged, or any 
proof offered, that sufficiently rapid and extensive eartli-movements 
actually did occur in the sub alpine valleys of these countries, we must 
decline to accept such a hypothetical and unsatisfactory explana- 
tion. - 

5. The contours (Old outlines of the lakes Indicate erosion rather than 
submergence. — While collecting facts for the present articles it occurred 
to me that the rival theories of lake formation — erosion and submerg- 
ence — were so different in their mode of action that they ought to pro- 
duce some marked difference in the result. There must be some' criteria 
by which to distinguish the two modes of origin. Under any system of 
earth-movements a valley bottom will simi)ly become submerged, and be 
hardly more altered than if it had been converted into a lake by build- 
ing an artiticial dam in a convenient situation. We should find there- 
fore merely a submerged valley with all its usual peculiarities. If 
however the lake basin has been formed by glacial erosion, then some 
of the special valley features will have been destroyed, and we shall 
have a distinct set of characters which will be tolerably constant in all 
lakes so formed. Now I find that there are three such criteria by which 
we ought to be able to distinguish the two classes of lakes, and the 
application of these tests serves to show that most of the valley lakes 
of glaciated countries were not formed by submergence. 

The first point is that valleys in mountainous countries often have the 
river channel forming a ravine for a few miles, afterward opening out 
into a flat valley, and then again closing, while at an elevation of a 
hundred or a few hundred feet, at the level of the top of the ravine, 



294 THE ICE AGE AND ITS WORK. 

the valley walls sloped back on each side, perhaps to be again flanked 
by precipices. Now, if sncli a valley were converted into a deep lake 
by any foim of subsidence, these ravines would remain under water 
and form submerged river channels. But neither in the lakes, which 
have been sniveyed by the Swiss Government, nor in the Atlas des 
Lacs Fraiicaises of M, Delebecque, nor in those of the German Alps 
by Dr. Alois lieistbeck, nor in the lakes of onr own country, can I find 
any indications of such submerged river channels or ravines, or any 
otlier of the varied rock features that so often occur in valleys. Almost 
all these lakes present I'ather stee[)ly sloping sides with broad, rounded, 
or nearly level bottoms of sancer shape, snch as are certainly not 
characteristic of sub-aerial valley bottoms, bnt which are exactly what 
we might expect as the ultimate result of thousands of years of inces- 
sant ice grinding. The point is, not that the lake bottoms may not in 
a few cases represent the contonrs of a valley, but that they never 
present peculiarities of contour which are not unfrequent in mountain 
valleys, and never show submerged ravines or those jutting rocky pro- 
montories which are so common a feature in hilly districts. 

The next point is, that alpine lake bottoms, whether large or small, 
frequently consist of two or more distinct basins, a feature which could 
not occur in lakes due to submergence unless there were two or more 
points of flexure for each depression, a thing highly improbable even 
in the larger lakes and almost impossible in the smaller. Flexures of 
almost any degree of curvature are no doubt found in the rocks form- 
ing mountain chains; but these flexures have been ])roduced deep 
down under enorinoiisi)ressureof overlying strata, whereas the surface 
beds which are supposed to have been moved to cause lakes are free to 
take any upward or downward curves, and as the source of motion is 
certainly deep-seated those curves will usually be of very gradual cur- 
vature. Yet in the small lake of Annecy there are two separate 
basins; in Lake Bourget also two; in the small lake of Aiguebellette, in 
Savoy, there are three distinct basins of very different depths; and in 
the Lac de St. Point, about 4 miles long, there are also three separate flat 
basins. In Switzerland the same phenomenon is often found. 

The exceedingly irregular Lake of Lucerne, formed by the confluence 
of many valleys meeting at various angles hemmed in by precipitous 
mountains, has eight distinct basins, mostly separated by shallows at 
the narrow openings between opposing mountain ridges. This is 
exactly what would result from glacier action, the grinding ])ower of 
which must always be at a maximum in the wider parts of valleys, 
where the weight of the ice could exert its full force and the motion be 
least impeded. On the subsidence or curvature theory, however, there 
is no reason why the greatest depth should occur in one part rather 
than in another, while separate basins in the variously diverging arms 
of one lake seem most improbable. - - - 

The third point of difference between lakes of erosion and those of 



I 



THE ICE AGE AND ITS WORK. 295 

submersion is the most important ;uid the most distinctive, and fur- 
nishes, I think, what may be termed a diagnosis cliaracter of hikes of 
erosion. In most river valleys through a hilly or mountainous country 
outside of the glaciated districts, the tributary streams enteriug more 
or less at right angles to the main valley are seen to occupy small val- 
leys of their own, which usually open ont for a short distance at the 
same level before Joining the main valley. Of course there are also 
torrents which rush down steep mountain slopes directly to the main 
river, but even these have usually tnit ravines more or less deeply into 
the rock. Now if in such a valley we could mark out a contour line 
200, 300, or 500 feet above the level of the main stream, we should see 
that line continually tnruing up each side valley or ravine till it reached 
the given level at which to cross the tributary stream, and then turn- 
ing back to the main valley. The contour line would thus form a series 
of notches or hiops of great<'r or less depth at every tributary stream 
with its entering valley or deeply cut ravine, and if the mam valley 
were tilled with water this line would mark out the margin of the lake. 
As an illustration of this feature we may take the southwest coast of 
England, which has never been glaciated, but which has umlergone a 
slight recent subsidence as indicated by the submerged forests which 
occur at several places. The result of this submergence is tliat the 
lower parts of its larger river valleys have been converted into inland 
tidal lakes, such as Poole Harbor, Dartmouth Harbor, Kingsbridge 
River, Plymouth and Devonport Harbors, and Carrick Road above 
Falmouth. The Dart River is an excellent example of such a sub- 
merged valley, and its outline at high-water mark is shown at (3) on the 
accompanying illustration (Plate xv), where the characteristic outline 
of such a valley is well indicated, the water ruuning up every tributary 
stream as described above. The lower section (4) shows the same fea- 
ture by means of a map of the River Tweed, near Peebles, with the 700 
feet contour line marked on it by a dotted line.* If the valley were 
submerged to this depth the dotted line would mark the outline of a 
lake, with arms running up every tributary stream just as in the case 
of the river Dart. Although situated in a glaciated district the val- 
ley here is post-glacial, all the old river channels being deeply buried 
ill diilt. 

It we now turn to the valley lakes in glaciated districts we shall find 
that they have a very different contour, as shown by the two upper 
outline maps on Plate xv; (1) showing the upper part of Ullswater 
on a scale of 1 mile to au inch, as in the Dart and Tweed maps, and 
(2) showing the upper part of Lake Como, taken from the Alpine Club 
map, on a scale of 4 miles to an inch. In both of these it will bo seen 
that the water never forms inlets up the inflowing streams, but all of 
these without exception form au even junction with the lake margin.

the Ordnauce Survey Map. 



296 THE ICE AGE AND ITS WORK. 

just as they would do if liowiug iuto a rivei'. Exactly tlie same feature 
is present in the lower portions of these two lakes, and it is equally a 
characteristii; of every lake in the lake district, and of all the Swiss 
aud Italian lakes. On looking- at the maps of any of these lakes one 
can not but see that the lake surface, not the lake bottom, represents 
ai)proximately the level of the pre-glacial valley, and tliat the lateral 
streams and torrents enter the lake in the way they do because they 
could only erode their channels down to the level of the old valley 
before the ice overwlielmed it. Of course this rule does not apply to 
large tributary valleys carrying- separate glaciers, since these would 
be eroded by the ice almost as deeply as the main valley. - - - 

The Lake of Geneva as a test of the rival theories. — When I recently 
began to study this question anew I was inclined to think that the 
largest and deepest of the Alpine lakes, such as Geneva, Constance, 
Lago Maggiore, and Lago di Garda, might perhaps have originated 
from a combination of earth movements with ice erosion. But on fur- 
ther consideration it appears that all the (iharacteristic features of ero- 
sion are present in these as fully as in the smaller lakes. They are sitn- 
ated in the largest river valleys or in i)ositions of greatest concentra- 
tion of the glacier streams: their contours aud outlines are those of 
eroded basins; while all the difiticuities m the way of an origin by 
earth movements are as jnominent in their case as in that of any 
other of the lakes. I will therefore discuss, first, some of the chief 
objections to the erosion theory as applied to the above-named lake, 
and then consider the only alternative theory that has obtained the 
accei)tance of modern writers. 

One of the first objections made was that the lake did not lie in the 
direction of the greatest action of the glacier, which was straight 
across to the Jura, where the highest erratic blocks are found. This 
was urged by Sir Charles Lyell immediately after Ivamsay's paper was 
read, aud as it has (juite recently been put forth by Prof, Bouncy, it 
would appear to be thought to be a real difificulty. Yet a little consid- 
eration will show that it has not the slightest weight. No lake was 
eroded in the line of motion of the central and highest part of the old 
glacier, because that line was over an elevated and hilly plateau, which 
is even now from 500 to 1,000 feet above the lake, and was then still 
higher, since the ice sheet certainly effected some erosion. The great- 
est amouut of erosion was of course in the broad and nearly level 
valley of the preglacial Rhone, which followed the great (nirve of the 
existing lake, and had produced so open a valley beeause the roeks in 
that direetion icere easily denuded. Objectors iuvariably forget or over- 
look the indisputable fact that the existence of a broad, o])en, fiat-bot- 
tomed valley in any part of a river's course proves that the rocks were 
there either softer, or more friable, or more soluble, or, by some combi- 
nation of characters, more easily denuded. A number of favorable 
conditions were combined to render ice erosion easy in such a valley.

Plate XV.

THE ICE AGE AND ITS WORK. 297 

Tlierock was, as we have shown, more easy to erode; owing to the low 
level the ice was thicker and had greater weight there than elsewhere: 
owing to the flatness and openness of the valley the ice moved more 
freely there: owing to the long previous course of the glacier its under 
surface would be heavily loaded with roi'k and grit, which, during its 
whole course, would, by mere gravitation, have been slowly working its 
way downward to the lowest level; and, lastly, all the sub-glacial tor- 
rents would accumulate in this lowest valley, and as erosion went on 
would, under great hydrostatic pressure, wash away all tlie ground-out 
material, and so facilitate erosion. 

Another objection almost equally beside the real question is to ask 
why the deepest i^art of the lake is near the south or convex side, 
whereas a stream of water always exerts most erosive force against the 
concave side.* The answer is, that ice is not water, and that it moves 
so slowly as to act, in many respects, in quite a different manner. Its 
greatest action is where it is deepest, in the middle of the ice stream, 
while water acts least where it is deepest, and more forcibl^^ at the side 
than in the middle. The lake is no doubt deepest in the line of the 
old river, where tlie valley was lowest; and that may well have been 
nearer the southern than the northern side of the lake. 

Another frequently-urged objection is, that as the glacier has not 
widened the narrow valley from Martigny to Bex it could not have 
eroded a lake nearly a thousand feet deep. This seems to me a com- 
l)lete non sequitur. As a glacier erodes mainly by its vertical pressure 
and by the completeness of its grinding armature of rock, it is clear that 
its grinding power laterally must have been very much less than verti- 
cally, both on account of the smaller pressure because it would mold 
itself less closely to the ever-varying rocky protuberances, and mainly, 
perhaps, because at the almost vertical sides of the valley it would 
have a very small stony armature, the blocks continually working their 
way downward to the bottom. Thus, much of the ice in contact with 
the sides of narrow ravines might be free of stones, and would there 
fore exert hardly any grinding power. It is also quite certain that the 
ice in this narrow valley rose to an enormous height, and that the 
chief motion and also the chief erosion would be on the lateral slopes? 
while the lower strata, wedged in the gorge, would be almost station- 
ary. 

The most recent researches, according to M. Falsan, show that the 
thickness of the ice has been usually under-estimated. A terminal 
moraine on the Jura at Chasseron is 4,000 feet above the sea, or 2,770 
feet above Geneva. In order that the upper surface of the ice should 
have had suthcient incline to How onward as it did it was probably 
5,000 or 6,000 feet thick below Martigny and 4,000 or 5,000 feet over 
the middle of the lake. It is certain, at all events, that whatever

tliickiies.s was necessary to cause ouwaid niotiou that thickness coald 
not fail to be produced, since it is only by the onward motion to some 
outlet or lowland where the ice can be melted away as fast as it is 
renewed that indefinite enlargement of a glacier is avoided. The essen- 
tial condition for the formation of a glacier at all is that more ice should 
be produced antiually than is melted away. So long as the quantity 
produceti is ou the average more than that melted, the glaciers will 
increase ; and as the more extended surface of ice, up to a certain point, 
by forming a refrigerator, hel])S its own extension, a very small perma- 
nent annual surplus may lead to an enormous extension of the ice 
Hence, it at any stage in its development the end of a glacier remains 
stationary, either owing to some obstacle in its path or to its having 
reached a level plain wiiere it is unable to move onward, the annual 
surplus of ice produced will go to increase the thickness of the glacier 
and its upper slope till motion is produced. The ice then flows onward 
till it reaches a district warm enough to bring about an equilibrium 
betAveen growth and dissolution. If, therefore, at any stage in the 
growth of a glacier, a thickness of 0,000, 7,000, or even 8,000 feet is 
needed to bring about this result, that thickness will inevitably be 
produced, - - - 

In view therefore of the admitted facts, all the objections alleged 
by the best authorities are entirely wanting in real force or validity ; 
while the enormous size and weight of the glacier and its long duration, 
as indicated by the great distance to which it extended beyond the site 
of the lake, render the excavation by it of such a basin as easy to con- 
ceive as the grinding out of a small alpine tarn by ice not one-fourth as 
thick, and in a sitnation where the grinding material in its lower strata 
wonld probably be comparatively scanty. 

We have now to consider the theory of Desor, adopted by M. Favre, 
and set forth in the recent work of M, Falsan as being "more precise 
and more acceptable" than that of Eamsay, We are flrst made 
accpiainted with a fact which I have not yet alluded to, and wiiich 
most writers on the subject either fail to notice or attempt to explain 
by theories, as compared with w^hich that of Ramsay is simple, proba- 
ble, and easy of comi)iehension. This fact is, that around Geneva at 
tlie outlet of the lake, as well as at the outlets of the other great lakes, 
there is spread out an old alluvium which is always fonnd underneath 
tJie bowlder clay and other {/lacial dejjosits. This alluvium is moreover 
admitted to be formed in every case of materials largely derived from 
the great Alpine range. Nowhere is a fact which of itself amounts to 
a demonstration that the lakes did not e.ri.st before the ice age; because, 
in that case all the Alpine debris would be intercepted by the lake 
(as it is now intercepted) and the alluvinm below the glacial deposits 
would be, in the case of Geneva, that formed by the wash from the 
adjacent s]oi)es of the Jura, ^vhile in every case it would be local not 
Alpine alluvium. - - - 



THE ICE AGE AND ITS WORK. 299 

Summary of the evidence. — As the subject bere discussed is very 
complex, and the argumeut essentially a cumulative one, it will be well 
briefly to summarize its main i)oiuts. 

In the first place, it has been shown that the valley lakes of highly 
glaciated districts form a distinct class, which are highly characteristic, 
if not altogether peculiar, since in none of the mountain ranges of 
the tropics or of non-glaciated regions over tlie whole world are any 
similar lakes to be found. 

The special conditions favorable to the erosion of lake basins and 
the mode of action of the ice tool are then discussed, and it is shown 
that these conditions have been either overlooked or ignored by the 
opponents of the theory of ice erosion. 

The objections of modern writers are then considered, and they are 
shown to be founded either on mistaken ideas as to the mode of erosion 
by glaciers, or on not taking into account results of glacieratiou which 
they themselves either admit or have not attempted to disprove. 

The alternative theory — that earth-movements of various kinds led 
to the production of lake basins in all mountain range, and that those 
in glaciated regions were preserved by being filled with ice — is shown 
to be beset with numerous difficulties, i^liysical, geological, and geo- 
graphical, which its supporters have not attempted to overcome. It is 
also pointed out that this theory in no way explains tlie occurrence of 
the largest and deepest lakes in the largest river valleys, or in those 
valleys where there was the greatest concentration of glaciers, a pecu- 
liarity of their distribution which points directly and unmistakably to 
ice erosion. 

A crucial test of the two theories is then suggested, and it is shown 
that both the sub-aqueous contours of the lake basins, and the super- 
ficial outlines of the lakes, are exactly such as would be i^roduced by 
ice erosion, while they could not possibly have been caused by sub- 
mergence due to any form of earth movements. It is submitted that 
we have here a positive criterion, now adduced for the first time, which 
is absolutely fatal to any theory of submersion. 

Lastly, the special case of the Lake of Geneva is discussed, and it is 
shown that the explanation put forth by the auti-glacialists is wholly 
unsupported by facts and is opposed to the known laws of glacier motion. 
The geologists who support it themselves furnish evidence against their 
own theory in the ancient alluvium at Geneva on which the glacial 
deposits rest, and which is admitted to be mainly derived from the 
distant Alj)s. l>ut as all alluvial matter is necessarily intercepted by 
large and deep lakes, the presenceof this Alpine alluvium immediately 
beneath the glacial debris at the foot of the lake indicates that the 
lake did not exist in preglacial times, but that the river Rhone flowed 
from the Alps to Geneva, carry with it the old alluvium, consisting of 
mud, sand, and gravel, which it hadbrt)ught down from the mountains. 
Still more conclusive however is the fact that the three special features

which biive been shown to indicate erosion rather thcUi submergence 
are ])resent in this hike as fully as iu all other Alpine valley lakes aud 
iinniistakably point to the glacial origin of all of them. 

On the whole, 1 veiiturt to claim that the facts and considerations 
set forth in this i)ai)er show such a number ot distinct lines of evidence, 
all converging to establish the theory of the ice erosion of the valley 
lakes of highly glaciated regions — a theory firjit advocated by the late 
Sir Andrew Kaiusay — thai that theory must be held to be established, 
at all events provisionally, as the only one by which the whole body of 
the facts can be explained and harmonized. 



GEOLOGIC TIME, AS INDICATED BY THE SEDIMENTARY 
ROCKS OF NORTH AMERICA.* 



By Charles D. Walcott. 



TNTRODUrTION. 

Of all subjects of speculative iieology few are more attractive or more 
uucertaiu in positive results thau geologic time. The physicists have 
drawn the lines closer and closer until the geologist is told that he 
must bring his estimates of the age of the earth within the limit of 
from 10,000,000 to 30,000,000 years. The geologist masses his observa- 
tions and replies that more time is required, and suggests to the physi- 
cist that there maj^be an error somewhere in his data or the method of 
his treatment. The geologist realizes that geologic time can not be 
reduced to actual time in decades or centuries ; there are too many par- 
tially recognized or altogether unknown factors; but he can approxi- 
mate the relative position of certain formations and, by comparison of 
their sediments, dimensions, and contained record of life with the esti- 
mated rates of denudation, sedimentation, and organic growth, form a 
general estimate of their relative time duration. It is my purpose to-day 
to take up the consideration of the evidence afforded by the sedimentary 
rocks of our continental area, and largely of a distinct basin of sedimen- 
tation, with a view of arriving, if possible, at an approximate time period 
for their deposition. Before proceeding to examine the conditions of 
denudation, sedimentation, etc., that enter as factors into the calcula- 
tion of the age of the earth on the basis of sedimentary geology, we will 
refer to some of the opinions that have been held by geologists on geo- 
logic time and the age of the earth. 

Soon after geology emerged from its pre-systematic stage and assumed 
an independent position among the inductive sciences speculations on 
the age of the earth were made by both geologists and jihysicists. Hut- 
ton, Werner, Smith, and Cuvier, among the former, arranged and pub- 
lished their observations and those of their predecessors during the 
closing years of the eighteenth century, and in the three succeeding 
decades rapid progress was made in many lines of investigation by

numerous observers, and the literature of geology was enlarged by con- 
tributions dealing with nearly every phase of the subject. 

Hiitton. — Dr. James Hutton was the founder of physical geology and 
the predecessor of Lyell in advocating the uniformitarian theory of 
geology. It is, iu a great measure, true — as Lyell has well said of Hut- 
ton's attempt to give fixed principles to geology — that " too little prog- 
ress has been made toward furnishing the necessary data to enable 
any philosopher, howev^er great h is genius, to realize so noble a project." * 
In his first memoir Hutton t speaks of a method of measuring the dura- 
tion of geologic time as follows: 

"We are investigating the age of the present earth, from the begin- 
ning of that body, which was in the bottom of the sea, to the perfection 
of its nature, whicli we consider as in the moment of our existence; and 
we have necessarily another era, which is collateral, or correspondent, 
in the progress of those natural events. This is the time required, in 
the natural operations of this globe, for the destruction of a former 
earth, an earth equally perfect with the present and an earth equally 
productive of growing plants and living animals. Xow, it must appear 
that if we had a measure for one of those corresponding operations we 
would have an efjual knowledge of the other.

"The highest mountain may be levelled with the plain fi'om whence 
it springs without the loss of real territory in the land; but when the 
ocean makes encroachment on the basis of our earth, the mountain, 
unsupported, tumbles with its weight; and with that accession of hard 
bodies, moviible with the agitation of the waves, gives to the sea the 
power of undermining farther and farther into the solid basis of our 
land. This is the operation which is to be measured; this is the mean 
proportional by whicli we are to estimate the age of worlds that have 
terminated, and the duration of those that are but beginning." 

He then discusses the data for estimating the length of time it has 
taken for a specific amount of erosion, and concludes "that all the 
coasts of the present continents are wasted by the sea, and constantly 
wearing away upon the whole; but this operation is so extremely slow 
that we cannot find a measure of the quantity in order to form an esti- 
mate. Therefore, the present constituents of earth, which we consider 
as in a state of perfection, would, in the natural operations of the 
globe, require a time indefinite for their destruction." 

He believed that the continents thus destroyed were formed from the 
ruins of pre-existing continents, and that there were records of three 
such ijeriods, each of which, in our measurement of time, were of indefi- 
nite duration. I 

LycU.—lu 1830 Sir Charles Lyell began to publish the results of his 
profound and philosophical studies of geologic phenomena. He firmly 
established the broad outlines of the law of uniformity as opposed to

the doctrine of geologic catastrophes and rendered possible a rough 
computation of the age of the eartliou the principle that geologic proc- 
esses were the same daring geologic time as at the present. Before 
this effort the scientist and theologian (with tlie exception of Huttou 
and his followers) vied with each other in their attempts to harmonize 
the Mosaic record with that of nature; they exjianded the seventeenth 
century views of the former and contracted the inductive reasoning 
from geologic phenomena, aiid called in the aid of special creations, 
great catastrophes and other unusual phenomena. This was cleared 
away among geologists by Lyell's work, supplemented later by the 
general law of evolution which, since the appearance of Darwin's Origin 
of Species, has with a few and rare exceptions controlled and directed 
scientific work and thought in this direction. 

Lyell based an argument for the age of the sedimentary rocks as 
known to him on the rate of modification of the species of mollusca 
since the beginning of the " Cambrian i)eriod."' He divided the geo- 
logic series into twelve periods and estimated that 20,000,000 years 
were demanded for a complete change in the species of each period, or 
240.000,000 years in all. This estimate excluded the Primoidial of Bar- 
raudeand the ''antecedent Laurentian formations.*'* 

Darwin. — In the chapter summing up the imperfections of the geo- 
logical record Darwin concludes that, if his theory of the origin of 
species is true, '■'■ it is indisputable that before the lowest Cambrian 
stratum was deposited, long periods elapsed, as long as, or probably 
far longer than, the whole interval from the Cambrian age to the i)res- 
entday; and that during these vast periods the world swarmed with 
living creatures." When mentioning the opinions of various authors 
on the duration of geologic time, he indirectly gives his own views, as 
follows : 

"Mr. Croll estimates that about 60,000,000 years have elapsed since 
the Cambrian period, but this, judging from the small amount of organic 
change since the commencement of the Glacial epoch, appears a very 
short time for the many and great mutations of life which have cer- 
tainly occurred since the Cambrian formation; and the previous 
140,000,000 years can hardly be considered as sufficient for the devel- 
opment of the varied forms of life which already existed during the 
Cambrian period. It is however probable, as Sir William Thompson 
insists, that the world at a very early period was subjected to more 
rapid and violent changes in its ])liysical conditions than those now 
occurring; and such changes would have tended to induce clianges at 
a corresjjonding rate in the organisms which then existed."! 

Houghton. — Eev. Samuel Houghton, in commenting on the geological 
calculus, states that he believes that the time during which organic life 
has existed on the earth is practically infinite. On the basis of the time 
of cooling he assigns an age of 1,280,000,000 years for the Azoic period 
and remarks that the globe was habitable, in part at least, for a longer

period.* At a later date, wlien attempting to assign a minor limit to the 
duration of geologic time, be was driven to the conclusion that geologic 
climates are due to the combined cooling of the earth and sun. On com- 
paring the rates of cooling of such a body as the earth with the maxi- 
mum measured thickness of the several strata, there is a remarkable 
proportion between them, which leads toward the conclusion that the 
maximum thickness of the strata is iirojiortional to the times of their 
Ibrmation. From the combined conclusions deduced from the rate of 
cooling of the eartli and the time required for dei)osition of the sedi- 
mentary rocks, he gives for the whole duration of geologic time a mini- 
mum of 200,000,000 years.t 

Croll. — Dr. James Groll began his studies of denudation as a factor 
in estimates of geologic time in 1805, and reference is made to it in 
I8O74 111 the following year a more elaborate paper was published, 
and subsequently numerous references have been made to it and other 
factors that are to bo considered in the estimate of geologic time. § Dr. 
Croll agrees with Sir W. Thompson that Prof. Tait probably under-esti- 
mated the time when he afltirms that 10,000,000 years is about the 
utmost that can be allowed, from the physical point of view, for all the 
changes that have taken place in the earth's surface since vegetable 
life of the lowest known form was capable of existing there. He re- 
marks : 

"And this is certainly all that ever can be expected from giavitation; 
mathematical computation has demonstrated that it can give no more. 
The other theory, founded on motion in space — a cause as real as gravi- 
tation — labors under no such limitation. According to it, so far at 
least as regards the store of energy which may have been possessed by 
the sun, plant and animal life may date back, not to 10,000,000 years, 
but to a period indetinitely more remote. In fact, there is as yet no 
known limit to the amount of heat which this cause may have i>ro 
duced; for this depended upon the velocities of the two bodies at the 
moment prior to collision, and what these velocities were we have no 
means of knowing. They might have been 500 miles a second, for 
anything which can be shown to the contrary. Of course, I by no 
means aftirm that it is as much as 100,000,000 years since life began 
upon our earth, but I certainly do affirm that, in so far as a possible 
souice of the sun's energy is concerne<l, life may have begun at a ])erio(l 
as remote." II 

Dr. Croll considers the geological evidence relating to the age of the 
sun's heat on the principle that, " in order to determine the present 
rate of sub-aerial denudation, we have only to ascertain the quantity of 
sediment annually carried down by the river systems.''* After extended 
consideration of the evidence he concludes that a period of 24,000,000

years would be required for the depositiou of tlie known sedimentary 
rocks. On the theory that the present existing sedimentary rocks 
have on the average passed at least twice through the cycle of destruc- 
tion and reformation the jieriod is multiplied by three, which results in 
72,000,000 years for the time of duration since the beginning of the 
deposition of the sedimentary rocks. He says further, " It is impossible 
to tell from geological data the actual age of the stratified rocks ; but 
this is not required. What we require is, as already stated, not their 
actual age but an inferior limit to that age." 

Wallace. — The chapter on " The earth's age" contained in Sir A. R. 
Wallace's Island Life, is an admirable summary of his own views and 
those of various geologists, naturalists, and physicists who have written 
on the subject. From the consideration of data bearing on the denuda- 
tion and deposition of strata as a measure of time he thinks that 
28,000,000 years will be sufQcient for the deposition of the known sedi- 
mentary rocks. Of the value of this estimate he says, " It is not of 
course supposed that the calculation here given marks any api^roachto 
accuracy, but it is believed that it does indicate the order of magni- 
tude of the time required. We have a certain number of data, which 
are not guessed, but the result of actual measurement; such are, the 
amount of solid matter carried down by rivers, the width of the belt 
within which this matter is mainly deposited, and the maximum thick- 
ness of the known stratified rocks." t 

By adopting CroU's theory of glacial epochs occurring at certain 
periods of great eccentricity, several datum points are secured by Wal- 
lace that are correlated with certain geologic phenomena of the Ter- 
tiary and Pleistocene periods and the probable date of the Miocene 
period. He then takes the ratio of Lyell for the duration of the geo- 
logic epochs and concludes that 16,000,000 years have passed since Cam- 
brian time. On the basis of Dana's theory that the Tertiary is only 
one-fifteenth of the Mesozoic and Paleozoic combined, the result is 
60,000,000 years for the same interval. Of these figures he says: 

"The estimate arrived at for the rate of denudation and deposition 
(28,000,000 years) is nearly midway between these, and it is, at all 
events, satistactory that the various measures result in 'figures of the 
same order of magnitude, which is all one can expect on so difficult 
and exceedingly speculative a subject. The only value of such esti- 
mates is to define our notions of geological time, and to show that the 
enormous periods of hundreds of millions of years, which have some- 
times been indicated by geologists, are neither necessary nor warranted 
by the facts at our command; while the present result places us more 
in harmony with the calculation of physicists, by leaving a very wide 
margin between geological time as defined by the fossiliferous rocks, 
and that far more extensive period which includes all possibility of 
life upon the earth." |

The results obtained by Wallace are (j[uesti()iied byT. Mellard Reade, 
wbo states tliat Wallace lias not allowed for the erosiou and re-dejwsi- 
tion of the same sediments a number of times.* 

Winchell. — Dr. Alexander Wincliell reviews the opinions of physicists 
and geologists on the age of the world or of ceitain periods, and enu-- 
merates the grounds for the various estimates, as follows: 

" (1) The time recjuired tor the sun to contract from a nebulous con- 
dition or froui the orbit of the earth to its present limits. 

" (2) The time which the sun will re(]uireto cool from its present con- 
dition to a darkened or planetary state. 

" (3) The time recjuired for the earth to cool from incipient incrusta- 
tion to its present state, based on the thermal conductivity of rock 
masses and the rate of inci'eased heat toward the earth's center. 

"(4) Kelative times required for the deposition of all the rocky sedi- 
ments. 

" (o) Calculation based on the obliteration of the rotational effects of 
the upheaval of a continental mass. 

" (0) The time since the middle of the last glacial period, based on 
the theory that epochs of glaciation on the northern hemisphere have 
been caused by extreme eccentricity of the earth's orbit. 

" (7) Estimates based on rates of erosions and dei)osition. 

"(8) The rate of Bluff-recession and Terrace formation. 

" (0) Decrease of temperature of ground covered by ice during the 
glacial period, as compared with temperature of ground not chilled by 
the ice sheet." t 

Dr. Winchell was inclined to accord at least equal contidence to the 
later results of geologic action, such as erosion of river gorges and 
lakeside and seaside bluff's, as he would give to the mathematical 
methods of the x)hysicist. On this basis he deduced the result that the 
whole incrusted age of the Avorld would be 3,000.000 years. In con- 
clusion he says: 

"If our attemi)ts to ascertain the age of the world, or the duration 
of any single period of its evolution, yield only uncertain results, they 
suffice at least to demonstrate that geological history has limits far 
within the wild cimcf ptions of a certain class of geologists. They 
show, if we may credit the indications here regarded most trustworthy, 
a restriction of the modern epoch within limits not exceeding one-tenth 
or one-twentieth the duration sometimes assigned to it."| 

GeUcie. — Sir Archibald Geikie has recently summed up the case of the 
geologist and physicist in a very clear statement, as follows: 

"In scientific as in other mundane questions there may often be two 
sides, and the truth may ultimately be found not to lie wholly with 
either. I frankly confess that the demands of the early geologists for 
an unlimited series of ages were extravagant, and even, for their own 
pur])oses, unnecessary, and the physicist did good service in reducing 
them. It may also be freely admitted that the latest conclusions Ironi 
physical considerations of the extent of geological time require that the 
inter])retation given to the re^-ord of the rocks should be vigorously 
revised, with the view of ascertaining how far that interpretation may

be cap.able of moditication or amendment. lUit we must also remember 
that the geological record constitutes a voluminous body of evidence 
regarding the earth's history which can not be ignored, and must be 
explained in accordance with ascertained natural laws. If the conclu- 
sions derived from the most careful study of this record can not be recon- 
ciled with those drawn from physical considerations, it is surely not too 
much to ask that the latter should be also revised. It has been well 
said that the mathematical mill is anadmirablepieceof machinery, but 
that the value of Avhat it jaelds depends upon the quality of what is put 
into it. That there nuist be some flaw in the physical argument, I can, 
for my own part, hardly doubt, thongh I do not pretend to be able to 
say where it is to be found. Some assumption, it seems to me, has 
been made, or some consideration has been left out of sight, which will 
eventually be seen to vitiate the conclusions, and which, when duly 
taken into account, will allow time enough for any reasonable interpre- 
tation of the geological record."* 

Of the rate of denudation and deposition he says : 

" The rate of deposition of new sedimentary formations, over an area 
of sea tloor equivalent to that which has yielded the sediment, may 
vary from 1 foot in 730 years to 1 foot in 0,800 years. If now we take 
these results and apply them as measures of the length of time reqnired 
for the deposition of the various sedimentary masses that form the 
onter part of the earth's crust, we obtain some indication of the dura- 
tion of geological history. On a reasonable computation these strati- 
fied masses, where most fnlly developed, attain a united thickness of 
not less than 100,000 feet. If they were all laid down at the most rapid 
recorded rate of denudation, they would require a period of 73,000,000 
years for their completion. If they were laid down at the slowest rate 
they would demand a period of not less than 080,000,000." t 

Reade. — Mr. T. Millard Reade has been a large contributor to the litera- 
ture of geologic time, both directly and indirectly. His most recent con- 
clusion is that there appears to be a consensus of oi^inion that 1 foot 
in 3,000 years is a fair estimate of the mean rate of such erosion over 
all land areas throughout all geologic time. The calculation that has 
elapsed since the beginning of Cambrian time, on this basis,*is stated 
as follows: 

" The mean area of denudation throughout post-Archaean times being 
taken as one-third the entire land areas of the globe, the bullc of the 
post-Archean rocks being ex])ressed by the land area of the globe 2 
miles thick, and the rate of denudation 1 foot in 3,000 years, the time of 
accumulation will be 5,280 x 2 x 3,000 x 3 ^ ()r),()40,000!; The time that 
has elapsed since the commencement of the Cambrian is, therefore, in 
round figures, 95,000,000 years." | 

S])eaking of Sir Archibald Geikie's conclusion that the earth's age, 
geologically speaking, nmst be somewhere between 100,000,000 and 
600,000,000 years, he says : 

"This is a large margin, no doubt, but it is an important thing to

know. Different men may put different value on the three factors, bulk 
ot sediment, rate of denutlation, and area of denudation; but I tliink a 
fair and impartial examination of the reasoning- involved in this paper 
will sliowthat the luinciple of the calculation is sound. 

"It must not be forgotten that to arrive at the earth's age Archnean 
time has to be added to my estimate of 9.5,000,000 years, which very 
materially increases the margin of geologic time on which we are 
allowed to draw."*

denudation,! and later reviews the results obtained by the geologist and

who have written on geologic time. On the basis of mechanical deiuida- 
tion and sedimentation he thinks that from (57,000,000 to 90,000,000 
years, at the present rate of sedimentation, would account for every- 
thing that has been produced since the consolidation of the crust.§ 

Df(H((. — In some observations on the length of geologic time. Prof. 
James I). Dana says that geology has no means of substituting posi- 
tive lengths of time in place of the time ratios he has deduced from 
the relative thicknesses of the rock series pertaining to the several geo- 
logic ages, but tliat it affords facts sufficient to j)rove the general prop- 
osition that geologic " //>He is long.'''' lie cites examples, such as the 
retreat of Niagara Falls and the recent growth of coral reefs. Accord- 
ing to his time ratio, if 48,000,000 years is assigned since the commence- 
ment of the Silurian, the I*aleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic time would 
represent, respectively, 30,000,000, 9,000,000, and 3,000,000 years. || 

Me Gee. — In an article on comparative chronology by Mr. W J McGee, 
the conclusion is reached that the antiquity of the glacial dei^osits 
margined by the great terminal moraine is about 7,000 years, and of 
the Columbian formation and of the ice invasion to which it is ascribed, 
200,000 years, and of the Lafayette formation of late Tertiary age, 
10,000,000 years. On this basis the mean estimate of the age of the 
earth is 15,000,000,000 years, and 7,000,000,000 years have elapsed 
since the beginning of Paleozoic time.^ In a subsequent " Note on the 
Age of the Earth" Mr. McGee modifies his former statement, and gives 
as a mean estimate of the age of the earth 0,000,000,000 years, and of 
the duration of time since the beginning of the Paleozoic, 2,400,000,000 
years, which is based on a minimum estimate for the age of the earth of

10,000,000 years and a maximum estimate of 5,000,000,000,000 [5 thou- 
sand million] years.* Mr. McGee, in speaking of these estimates, says: 

''These general estimates are indefinite, and the minima, mean, and 
maxima are alike unworthy of final acceptance; but they stand for a 
real probletn and not a merely ideal one, and represent actual condi- 
tions of the known earth; and, so far as the science of geology is con- 
cerned, the maximum estimate is quite as probable as the minimum, 
while the mean is much more probable than either." t 

Upham. — Prof. Warren Upham, after reviewing various estimates of 
geologic time, concludes that the " probable length of Glacial and Post- 
Glacial time together is 30,000 or 40,000 years, more or less ; but an 
equal or considerably longer preceding time, while the areas that 
became covered by ice were being uplifted to high altitudes, may per- 
haps with good reason be also included in the Quaternary era, which 
then would comprise some 100,000 years." He then applies Prof. 
Dana's time ratios and concludes that the time needed for the earth's 
stratified rocks and the unfolding of its jilant and animal life must be 
about 100,000,000 years.f Mr. Upham's paper gives a number of illus- 
trations of geologic phenomena from Tertiary and Pleistocene geology 
that bear upon the time duration of these epochs. 

From the foregoing estimates of geologic time, the only conclusion 
that can be drawn is that the earth is very old, and that nmn's occupa- 
tion of it is but a day's span as compared with the eons that have 
elapsed since the first consolidation of the rocks with which the geol- 
ogist is acquainted. 

When I began the preparation of this paper it was my intention to 
carefully analyze the sedimentary rocks of the entire geologic series as 
exposed upon the North American continent. I soon found, however, 
that the time at my disposal would make this impracticable, and I 
decided to take up the history of the deposits that accumulated in 
Paleozoic time on the western side of our continent, in an area that for 
convenience I shall call the Cordilleran sea. This was (;hosen because 
(1) I was personally acquainted with many of its typical sections, (2) 
there was abroad and almost uninterrupted sedimentation during Pal- 
eozoic time, and (3) there was a prosi)ect for obtaining more satisfac- 
tory data as a basis of calculation, since calcareous deposits are in 
excess of those of mechanical origin. 

We will now consider several points in relation to the growth or evo- 
lution of the North American continent, as the dei)Osition of mechan- 
ical sediments depend to a considerable extent on the character of the 
adjoining land area, and chemical sedimentation is also infiuenced by it. 

GROWTH OF THE CONTINENT.

Archean continent. From the great tliickuess of mechanical sediments 
it was evidently a period of elevated land and rapid deundation. With 
the close of Algonkian time extensive orographic movements occurred 
that outlined the subsequent development of the continent. The lines 
of the Rocky mountain and Appalachian ranges were emphasized and 
the great basins of sedimentation west of them defined. Subsequent 
movements have elevated the old and formed new subparallel ranges. 
These movements were often of long duration and also separated by 
great intervals of time, as is shown by the long continued base levels of 
erosion during which the great thickness of calcareous deposits accu- 
mulated in the Cordilleran and Appalachian seas. Since Algoukian 
time the growth of the ct)ntinent has been by the deposition of sedi- 
ments in the bordering oceans and interior seas and lakes within the 
limits of the continental plateau ; and it is considered tluit the relative 
position of the continental plateau and the deep sea have not materially 
changed during that period. How much the deposits on the continen- 
tal border have increased its area is unknown, as at present they are 
largely concealed beneath the waters of the ocean. During Paleozoic 
time the two areas of greatest known accumulation were the Appa- 
lachian and Cordilleran seas, where 30,000 feet or more of sediments 
were deposited. In the Cordilleran sea sedimentation was practically 
uniuterru})ted (except during a short interval iu middle Ordovician 
time) until towards the close of Paleozoic time. In the uorthern 
Appalachian sea it continued without any marked unconformity, from 
early Cambrian to the close of Ordovician time, and, south of Xew 
York, with relatively little interruption, until the close of Paleozoic time. 
Certain minor disturbances occurred along the eastern border of the sea, 
but they were not of sufficient extent to affect a general conclusion — 
which is that the depression of tlie areas of deposition within the 
continental platform continued without reversal of the subsidence dur- 
ing Paleozoic time. Duriug Cambrian, and, it may be, late Algonkian, 
time, the extended interior Mississippian region was practically leveled 
by denudation, the eroded material being carried into the Cordilleran 
and Appalachian seas and, probably, to a sea to the south. 

The sedimentation of the Mississipi^ian area in Paleozoic time between 
the Appalachian and the Cordilleran seas was small as compared to 
that which accumulated in the latter. In Devonian time there does not 
appear to have been any sedimentation in the western portion of it 
west of the ninety-fourth meridian and east of the Cordilleran sea, and 
it was slight in the same interval in the Appalachian sea south of the 
thirty- seventh parallel.* There is little if any evidence in the sedi- 



*The non-occurrence of Devonian sediment has not yet been fully explained. It 
has been suggested that the sea beyond the reach of mechanical sedimentation was 
too deep for the de])osition of calcai'eous deposits. It is more probable tliat the sea 
was shallow and an area of non-deposition, or that its bed was raised to form a low, 
level laud surface at a base level of erosion that was subjected to very slight degra- 
dation. 



GEOLOGIC TIME. 311 

ments of Paleozoic time to show that they were deposited in the deep, 
open ocean; on the contrary, they were largely accumulated in partially 
inclosed seas or mediterraneans and on the borders of the continental 
plateau. The former is particularly true of the sedimentation of the 
Cordilleran and Apjjalachian seas and the broad Mississippian sea. 

The close of the prolonged period of Paleozoic sedimentation was 
brought about by what Dana has termed the "Appalachian revolution." 
The topography of the continent was more or less changed, and the 
conditions of sedimentation that followed were unlike those that pre- 
ceded. This revolution raised above the sea level a considerable j)or- 
tion of the Cordilleran and the Appalachian sea beds and also of the 
Mississij)pian sea, east of the ninety- sixth meridian and north of the 
thirty-fcuirth parallel. In its effect it may be compared to the Algon- 
kian revolution* that preceded the deposition of the Paleozoic sedi- 
ments. 

With the opening of new conditions the sedimentation of the Meso 
zoic time began upon the Atlantic border and over large areas of the 
western half of tlie continent with the deposit of mechanical sedi- 
ments — sands, silts, etc. — during Jura-Trias time. They are of a char- 
acter that naturally follows a period of disturbance of pre-existing 
conditions and the formation of new basins of deposition with more or 
less elevated adjoining land areas. At its close orographic movements 
affecting the positions of the beds occurred upon the Pacific and 
Atlantic coasts and also, to a more limited degree, throughout the 
Eocky Mountain region. This does not api^ear to have extended over 
the plateau region or the central belt between the ninety-seventh and 
one hundred and fifth meridians. 

The Cretaceous formations have their greatest development between 
the ninety-seventh and one hundred and twelfth meridians in Mexico 
and the United States, in a broad belt which extends from the bound- 
ary of the latter to the northwest into the British x)ossessions as far as 
the sixty-first parallel. They were of a marine origin until toward 
the close of the period when a prolonged orographic movement ele- 
vated a large area of the continent above sea level and locally upturned 
the Cretaceous strata in the Rocky Mountain area. The shoaling of the 
sea was followed by the formation of great inland lakes in which fresh- 
water deposits succeeded the marine and estuarine sediments. Over 
the coastal regions they were of marine origin throughout. 

The Tertiary sediments deposited on the Cretaceous are marine on 
the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific coasts, and of fresh-water 
origin in the Rocky Mountain and Great Plains areas, where they 
were deposited in the great inland lakes outlined in the previous period. 

" The term " revolution " is used to describe the cuhninatiou of a long series of phe- 
nomena that finally resulted in a distinctly marked epoch in the evolution of the con- 
tinent. The ''Appalachian revolution' began far back in the Paleozoic and culmi- 
nated in the later stages of the Carboniferous, and the Algoukian revolution probably 
began far back in Aigonkian time. 



312 GEOLOGIC TIME. 

GEOGRAPHIC CONDITIONS ACCOMPANYINCf THE DEPOSITION OF PALE- 
OZOIC SEDIMENTS IN THE CORDILLERAN SEA. 

The assumed area of the Cordilleran or Paleo-Rocky Mountain sea 
includes over 400,000 square miles between the thirty-fifth and fifty- 
fifth parallels. To the eastward, during lower and middle Cambrian 
time, a land area is thought to have extended from east of the one 
hundred and eleventh meridian across tlie continent to the Paleo- 
Appalachian sea. This land was depressed toward the close of middle 
Cambrian time, and the Mississippian sea expanded over the wide 
plateau-like interior region, from the Gulf of Mexico on the south to 
the Lake Superior region on the north; westward it penetrated among 
the mountain ridges between the one hundred and fifth and one hun- 
dred and eleventh meridians, laying down the upper Cambrian deposits 
that are now found in New Mexico, Arizona, eastern Utah, the western 
half of Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana, and still further 
north into Alberta and British Columbia. During Ordovician, Silu- 
rian, Devonian, and Carboniferous time this entire Mississippian 
region, except x)ortions in Devonian time, appears to have been cov- 
ered by a relatively shallow sea that was co-extensive with the Appa- 
lachian sea and that communicated freely with the Cordilleran sea.. 
During this same age, however, the Eocky Mountain area of New 
Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, and Montana formed a more or 
less well-defined boundary of ridges and islands between the Cordilleran 
and the interior sea up to the forty-ninth parallel. To the north 
of the latter the conditions appear to have been the same as on the 
eastern side of the continent, where the Appalachian sea communi- 
cated freely with the Mississipi^ian sea. From the data that we now 
have I think that the Palezoic (Mississippian) sea extended at times 
over nearly all of the area subseipiently covered by the Cretaceous 
and the later formations between the G-ulf of Mexico and the Arctic 
ocean. This belt is bounded almost continuously on the east and 
west by Paleozoic rocks that extend from the Arctic ocean to Mexico, 
and whether of Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, or Devonian age they 
carry essentially the same fauna throughout their extent. In the 
outcrops of lower strata that rise up through this Cretaceous area the 
Cambrian, Ordovician, and Carboniferous rocks are found encircling 
the pre-Paleozoic rocks. Instances in which the Archaean rocks have 
been met with immeduitely beneath the Cretaceous in borings in 
Dakota and Minnesota are along the eastern border of the area, next 
to the Archa-an rocks, where it is probable that the Cretaceous over- 
laps the Paleozoic to the Archa'an. 

The western side of the Cordilleran sea seems to have been bounded 
by a land area that separated it from the I'aleozoic sea, which extended 
through central California and the Pacific border of British Columbia 
and Yancouvers Island. From the position of the Carboniferous 



GEOLOGIC TIME. 313 

deposits of California at the i)resent time, it appears that this land 
varied from 100 to 150 miles in width and was practically continuous 
along the western side of the Cordilleran sea. This view is further 
strengthened by the fact that the Carboniferous fauna of California has 
certain characteristics which are not found in the Carboniferous of the 
Cordilleran area. Our knowledge of the conditions north of the fifty - 
fifth pai-allel is limited by the want of accurate geologic data. If Cam- 
brian and Carboniferous rocks were not deposited in the Mackenzie 
Eiver basin and also on the eastern side of the area now covered by 
Cretaceous strata, the inference is that during Cambrian and Car- 
boniferous time there was a laud area to the east and north of the 
northern Cordilleran sea that may have been tributary to the latter. 

SOURCE OF SEDIMENTS DEPOSITED IN THE CORDILLERAN SEA. 

The sediments deposited in every sea or lake are derived from laud 
areas either by mechanical or chemical denudation. 

Mechanical denudation results from the action of the waves and cur- 
rents along the shore and the agency of rain, frost, snow, ice, wind, 
heat, etc., on the laud. Rain is the most important factor and the 
result depends mainly upon its amount and the slope or the gradient 
of the land. The general average of denudation for the surface of the 
land areas of the globe, now usually accepted, is 1 foot in 3,000 years. 
This varies locally, according to Sir Archibald Geikie, from 1 foot in 
750 years to 1 foot in 6,000 years.* Of the rate of denudation during 
Paleozoic time about the Cordilleran Sea we know very little, but I 
think that it was relatively rapid in early Cambrian time and during 
the deposition of the arenaceous sediments of the Ordovician and Car- 
boniferous. The material forming the argillaceous shales of the Cam- 
brian and Devonian was supplied to the sea nuire slowly. These con- 
clusions are sustained by the slight change in the character of the 
faunas where interrupted hy the sands and pebbles of the Ordovician 
and Carboniferous and the marked change between the base and summit 
of the argillaceous shales. As a whole, I think we are justified in 
assuming a minimum rate of mechanical denudation — of considerably 
less than 1 foot in 1,000 years — for the area tributary to the Cordilleran 
sea. 

Chemical denudation is the removal of material taken into solution 
by water. Mr. T. Mellard Keade has discussed this phase of denuda- 
tion in an adniiiable manner.t He came to the conclusion, from what 
was known of the water discharged into the ocean per year, the aver- 
age amount of material in chemical solution, and the area of laud sur- 
face drained by the rivers, tliat an average of 100 tons of rocky matter 
is dissolved per English square mile per annum. Of this he says: "If

we allot 50 tons to carbonate of liuie, 20 tons to sulphate of lime, 7 to 
silica, 4 to carbonate of magnesia, 4 to snlphate of magnesia, 1 to perox- 
ide of iron, 8 to chloride of sodium, and to the alkaline carbonates and 
snl]i]iates, we shall probably be as iiear the truth as present data will 
allow us to come."* By the use of the data given by Mr. John Murray, 
in a paper on the total annual rainfall on the land of the globe and the 
relation of rainfall to the discharge of rivers, t I obtain 113 tons as the 
total amouut of matter in solution discharged into the Atlantic basin 
per annum from each square mile of area drained into it. Of this, 49 
tons consist of carbonate of lime and 5-5 tons of sulphate and phos- 
phate of lime. I 

Mechanical sediments. — With the geographic conditions described as 
prevailing during Paleozoic time, the source of mechanical sediments 
later than the Middle Cambrian must have been from the broken area 
on the eastern side that extended 100 to 200 miles to the eastward 
and to a much greater extent from the land along the western side of 
the sea. The enormous deposit of from 10,000 to 20,000 feet of mechan- 
ical sediments in early Cambrian time is explained by the assumi)tion 
of favorable topographic conditions of denudation following theAlgon- 
kian revolution and the presence of a land area over the interior por- 
tion of the continent, and also, in all probability, between the Avestern 
side of the Cordilleran sea and the western border of the continent. 
During this period the conformable pre-fossiliferous strata of the Cam- 
brian accumnlatcd, and about 6,000 feet of the lower fossiliferous rocks 
as they occur in the Eureka district of central Nevada. Following the 
depression of the continent, which carried down the central area and 
also introduced the Upper Cambrian (Mississippian) sea into the Eocky 
Mountain area of Colorado, etc., there were deposited of mechanical 
sediments in central Nevada :

If ail av^erage is taken of the mechanical sediment deposited subse- 
quent to the close of ^liddle Cambrian time, it will be found to be about 
5,000 feet for the entire area, which, I think, does away with any neces- 
sity for assuming- an additional hypothetical land area for the source 
of the mechanical sediment. The tine sand composing the quartzites 
and the silt forming the shales, as well as the fine conglomerate of later 
deposits, were derived from the adjoining laud areas, and, in all proba- 
bility, currents swept through from the ocean to the south or north, 
distributing the mud and sand contributed from the rivers and streams 
along the shores. 

Chemical sediments. — The present supply of the carbonate of lime, 
silica, etc., contained in sea water is derived from waters poured into 
the sea by rivers and streams. The Cordilleran sea undoubtedly received 
a large contribution from the adjoining land areas, but a considerable 
amount was possibly deri\ed from an oceanic current that circulated 
through it, as the southern equatorial currentof the Atlantic now sweeps 
through the Caribbean. From the vast deposits of carbonate of lime 
it might be assumed, a priori, that the waters of a Mississippi or Amazon 
were poured into it, but there is not any evidence of the existence of 
■ such a river, although the tributary area may have been very large in 
Cambrian and Carboniferous time if the drainage of the country west 
of Hudson Bay was to the westwa7^d. 

Conditions of deposition. — With free communication into the open 
ocean on the south, and probably on the north, during most of Paleo- 
zoic time strong currents must have circulated through the Cordilleran 
sea. The broad distribution of mechanical sediments of a uniform 
character clearly shows this to have been the case, especially in pre- 
Sihirian time. The present known distribution of the mechanical sedi- 
ments indicates that they were mainly brought into the sea from the 
west,* although a vast amount was derived from the land on the east- 
ern side in pre-Ordovician time ; they were quite evenly distributed 
over the sea bed, excejjt where local accumulations of silt and sand 
occurred near the larger sources of supply, or in the direction of pow- 
erful currents within the sea. 

The conditions of the deposition of the carbonate of lime are less 
clearly understood than those governing mechanical sediments, and I 
shall enter upon the discussion of them at considerable length. There 
are three methods by which it is usually considered it may be depos-

ited: (1) agency of organisms; (2) cliemical i)recipitation ; (3) mechan- 
ical methods. 

It is tlie general opionion of geologists that limestone rocks are the 
result ahnost entirely of the consolidation of lime removed from the 
sea water through the agency of life, and that they consist of the 
remains of foraminifera, crinoids, corals, etc., or. their fragments, em- 
bedded in a more or less crystalline matrix resulting from subsequent 
alteration of the original deposits. Tliis, however, has been seriously 
questioned. Sorby, in giving his general conclusions of an extensive 
microscopic examination of limestones, states that — 

"Even if it were possible to study in adetaclied state the finer granu- 
lar particles which constitute so large a i>art of many limestone forma- 
tions, it would usually be impossible to say whether they had been 
derived from organisms which can decay down into granules, or from 
other organisms which can only be worn down into granules, or from 
ground-down older limestone, or, in some cases, from carbonate of lime 
deposited chemically as granules. - - - The shape and character 
of the identifiable fragments do, indeed, prove that much of this must 
have been derived from the decayed and worn-down calcareous organ- 
isms; and very often we may reasonably infer that the greater part, if 
not tlie whole, was so derived; but at the same time it is impossible to 
prove, from the structure of the rock, whether some or liow much was 
derived from limestones of earlier date, or was deposited chemically, 
as some certainly must have been."* 

In their memoir on coral reefs and other carbonate-of-lime forma- 
tions in modern seas, Messrs. Murray and Irvine show that tempera- 
ture of the water has a controlling influence upon the abundance of 
species and individuals of lime-secreting organisms; high temperature 
is more favorable to abundant secretion of carbonate of lime than high 
salinity. + 

Taking the samples of deep-sea deposits collected by the Challenger 
as a guide, the average percentage of carbonate of lime in the whole 
of tlie deposit covering the floor of the ocean is 36-83; of this it is esti- 
mated that fully 90 j^er cent is derived from j)elagic organisms that 
have fallen from the surface water, the remainder of the carbonate of 
lime having been secreted by organisms that lay on, or were attached 
to, the bottom. The estimated area of the various kinds of deiiosits, 
the average depth, and the average percentage of carbonate of lime to 
each are shown in the following table:

The 14 samples under 500 fathoms are chiefly coral muds and sands, 
and the 7 samj)les from 500 to 1,000 fathoms contain a considerable 
quantity of mineral particles from continents or volcanic islands. In 
all the depths greater than 1,000 fathoms the carbonate of lime is 
mostly derived from the shells of pelagic organisms that have fallen 
from the surface waters, and it will be noticed that these wholly disap- 
pear from the greater depths. | 

By a series of experiments Messrs. Murray and Irvine found, "that 
although sea water under certain conditions may take up a consider- 
able quantity of carbonate of lime in solution, yet it is unable perma- 
nently to retain in solution more than is usually found to be present in 
sea water, and it is owing to this that the amount of carbonate of lime 
is so constantly low. The reaction between organic matter and the sul- 
phates present in sea water (to which we have referred) tends also to 
keep the amount of carbonate of lime in solution at about one-half 
(0*12 grams) of what it might contain (0*28 grams per liter). This pecu-

liarity of vsea water in t;ikiiij>- ui) a large amount of aniorplious carbon- 
ate of lime and throwing it out in crystalline form accounts for the 
filling up of tbe interstices of massive coral with crystalline carbonate 
in coral islands and other calcareous formations, so that all traces may 
ultimately be lost of the original organic structures.* 

The authors explain the disappearance of shells and lime deposits in 
the greater depths of the ocean by their being dissolved by the carbonic 
acid in tlie water, which is present in larger quantity at great depths, 
and also is produced by the decomposition of the animal matter of the 
shell and of the various organisms living in the water and on the bot- 
tom. They conclude that — 

"On the whole, however, the quantity of carbonate of lime that is 
secreted by animals must exceed what is redissolved by the action of 
sea water, and at the jn-esent time there is a vast accumulation of the 
carbonate of lime going on in the ocean. It has been the same in the 
past, lor with a few insignificant exceptions all the carbonate of lime in 
the geological series of rocks has been secreted from sea water and 
owes its origin to organisms in the same way as the carbon of tlie car- 
boniferous formations; the extent of these deposits api)ears to have 
been increased from the earliest down to the present geological period." t 

In their report on deep sea deposits, collected by the Challenger expe- 
dition, Messrs. Murray and Renard state that the chemical products 
formed in hUu on the floor of the ocean nearly all originate in a sort of 
broth or ooze, in which the sea water is but slowly renewed. Many of 
them appear to be formed at the surface of the deposit — at the line 
separating the ooze from the superincumbent water, where oxidation 
takes place. In the deeper layers of the deposit a reduction of the 
higher oxides frequently occurs, and at the surface of the mud or 
ooze there are many living animals as well as the dead remains of sur- 
face plants and auimals.| They also conclude that practically all the 
carbon of marine organisms must ultimately be resolved into carbonic 
acid. The quantity of that acid produced in this way must be enormous, 
and can not but exert a great solvent action not only on the dead cal- 
careous structure, but also on the minerals in the muds on the floor of 
the ocean. § Of the effect of this destructive action they say: "In all 
cases, however, calcareous structures of all kinds are slowly removed 
from the bottom of the ocean on the death of the organisms, unless rap- 
idly covered up by the accumulating deposits, and in this way protected 
to a certain extent from the solvent action of the sea water. It is evi- 
dent from the Challenger investigations that whole classes of animals 
with hard, calcareous shells and skeletons, renuiins of which one might 
suppose would be preserved in modern deposits, are not there repre-

sented; altliough they are now living in immense nnmbers in the sur- 
face waters or on the deposits at the bottom in some regions, yet all 
traces of them have been removed by solution. A similar removal of 
calcareous organic structures has undoubtedly taken place in the 
marine formations of past geological ages."* 

From the preceding statements it is evident that initially the greater 
part of the carbonate of lime is taken from the sea water by organic 
agency, but in the working over of this material in the chemical labo- 
ratory at the bottom of the sea a considerable portion is taken up by 
the sea water as amorphous carbonate of lime and thrown out in the 
crystalline form to form the matrix of the undissolved shells, etc. t 

Mr. Bailey Willis has recently studied the question of the deposi- 
tion of carbonate of lime, and states that "chemists describe two con- 
ditions under which bicarbonate of lime may be decomposed into 
neutral carbonate and carbonic acid: first, by diminution of the ten- 
sion of the carbonic acid in the atmosphere; second, by agitation of the 
solution, 

"Theoretically either one of three things may occur to the neutral 
carbonate of lime, if it be thrown out of solution ])y either one of these 
processes. The carbonate may be redissolved, deposited as a calca- 
reous mud, or built into organic structures." He studied some recent 
limestone deposited in the Everglades of southern Florida and found it 
to be formed of fragments of shells embedded in caicite. He states 
that " under the microscope the unaltered structure of the organic frag- 
ments is strikingly different from that of the coarse holocrystalline 
matrix, in whi(;h it is apparent that the crystals developed in place. 
Were this a limestone of some past geologic period it would be con- 
cluded, on the evidence of the crystalline texture of some parts of it, 
that it had been metamorphosed and that tlie organic remains now 
visible had escaped the process which altered the matrix. But the 
observed conditions of its fornnition preclude the hypothesis of sec- 
ondary crystallization."! Apparently the crystalline matrix is one 
]nimary product, and the calcareous mud is another, which being pre- 
cipitated in the solution remains an incoherent sediment. 

I think we may accept the conclusion that the deposition of carbonate 
of lime is by both organic agency and chemical precipitaticni. It is not 
necessary to speak of deposition by mechanical methods except in rela- 
tion to the dej)osition of chemically derived granules. This probably 
takes place, and may be a very important factor in the formation of 
limestones in seas receiving a large supply of calcium from the land. 
Calcareous conglomerates do not enter as a prominent deposit in the 
Cordilleran area.

320 GEOLOGIC TIME. 

There is no evidence in tlie marine geologic formations of this conti- 
nent that they were deposited in the deep sea; on the contrary, tliey 
are nnlike such deposits and bear positive evidence of having been hiid 
down in rehitively shallow waters. Limestones with ripple niiirks and 
sun cracks occur, and beds of ripple-marked sandstones alternate with 
shales and limestones. The more massive limestones, however, appear 
to have accumulated in deeper water. The conditions in the Cordilleran 
sea were, 1 think, more favorable for rapid deposition than in the deep 
open ocean, but probably not as favorable as about coral reefs and 
islands. The limestones and often the contained fossils clearly indicate 
the presence of many of the same conditions of deposition as described 
by the authors I have (pioted. More or less decomposed shells occur in 
nearly every limestone; and a, large j)roportion of limestones, especially 
the nonmetamorphic marbles, clearly shows that they were deposited 
under the influence of the agencies at work in the laboratory of the sea. 
Willis states that this occurs in the shallow waters of the Everglades of 
Florida, and there is no a priori reason Avhy it did not occur throughout 
geologic time; on the contrary, there is no doubt that it did. 

Rate of deposii informer times. — It has frequently been assumed that 
in the earher epochs the conditions were more favorable for rajiid denu- 
dation and inconsequence thereof the transportation and deposition of 
sediment were greater. Prof. Prestwicli considers* that i^rior to the 
sedimentary rocks the land surface consisted of crystalline or igneous 
rocks subject to rapid decomposition owing to the composition of the 
atmosphere and to their inherent tendency to decay. They must have 
yielded to wear and removal with a facility unknown amongst mechani- 
cally-formed and detrital strata where erosion operates. He thus 
accounts for one of the factors that gave the large dimensions and 
thicknesses of the earlier formations. Mr. Wallace thinks that geolog- 
ical change was probably greater in very remote times,t stating that 
all telluric action increases as we go back into the j)ast time and that 
all the forces that have brought about geological phenomena were 
greater.} 

Dr. Woodward says on the opposite view, that in the earliest geolog- 
ical periods each bed of sand, clay, limestone, etc., had actually to be 
formed, and that later deposits had the older sedimentary ones to furnish

material, aud therefore the newer deposits were hiid down more rapidly.* 
This does not impress me strongly; but from my experience among the 
Paleozoic rocks I agree with Sir A. Goikie, that "we can see no i)roof 
whatever, nor even any evidence which suggests — that on the whole the 
rate of waste and sedimentation was more rapid during Mesozoic and 
Paleozoic time than it is to-day."t 

Prof. Iluxley, in his presidential address to the Geological Society 
of London in 1870, treats of the distribution of animals, and says of his 
hypothesis that it " requires no supposition that the rate of change in 
organic life has l)een either greater or less in ancient times than it is 
now; nor any assumption, either physical or biological, which has not 
its justification in analogous phenomena of existing nature.''^ 

In the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, Arizoua, there are 11,950 feet 
of strata of Algonkian age extending uncomformably beneath the Cam- 
brian. There is nothing m this section to indicate that the conditions 
of deposition were unlike those of the strata of Paleozoic and Mesozoic 
time. The sandstones, shakes, and limestones are identical in appear- 
ance and characteristics with those of the latter epoch. The deposition 
of sulphate of lime and gyi)sum occurred abundantly in the upper por- 
tions of the series, and salt is collected by the Indians from the deposits 
formed by the saline waters issuing from the sandstone 8,000 feet below 
the sununit of the series. The sandstones and shales were deposited 
in thin, even laminte and layers, and the sun cracks and ripple marks 
give evidence of slow, uniform deposition. In the upper or Chuar ter- 
raue, there are 235 feet of limestone. And in one of the layers of lime- 
stone, 2,700 feet below the summit of the Chuar terrane, I find abun- 
dant evidence of the presence of spicuhc of sponges and what appear to 
be worn fragments of some small fossils. There is absolutely nothing 
to indicate more rapid denudation and corresponding deposition in this 
early pre-Canibrian series than we find in the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, or 
Cenozoic fornmtions. 

PALEOZOIC SEDIMENTS OF THE CORDILLERAN SEA. 

The great sections of sedimentary. rocks in Arizona, Nevada, Utah, 
Montana, and in Alberta, British America, all bear evidence that the 
sediments of which they are built up were deposited in a connected and 
continuous sea that extended from the vicinity of the thirty-fourth 
parallel, on the south, to the Arctic Ocean on the north. Judging from 
the data now available the width of this sea varies from 300 miles in 
Nevada to 500 miles on the line of the fortieth parallel, and, with inter- 
ruptions by mountain ridges, to 250 miles on the forty-ninth parallel. 
It appears to have narrowed to the north in Alberta and British Colum-

bia. Eoughly computed, it covered, tsoutli of the fifty-fifth parallel, 
400,000 square miles, exclusive of any extension westward into north- 
ern-central California and southwestern Oregon and to the eastward over 
the area subsequently covered by the great interior Cretaceous sea. 
There is also an addition that might be made to allow for the contrac- 
tion of the area by the later north-and-south faults and thrusts. Dr. 
G. M. Dawson estimates that in the Alberta and British Columbia area 
the width of the zone of Paleozoic rocks has probably been rednced one- 
half by the folding and faulting, or from 200 to 100 miles.* The area 
assumed for the Cordilleran Sea is on this account probably one-half 
less than it was before the close of the Appalachian revolution. 

The Wasatch section, on the eastern side of the area under consider- 
ation, has 30,000 feet of strata, of which 10,400 feet are limestone.! 
Further to the west, 250 miles west-southwest, at Eureka, ISTev., there 
are 30,000 feet of strata in the entire section, and of this amount 10,000 
feet are referred to limestone.f In tlie Pahranagat range and vicinity, 
200 miles south of the Eureka section, § the limestones of the Paleo- 
zoic measure over 13,000 feet in a section of lo,500 feet. This section 
includes only 350 feet of the upper beds of the lower quartzite series, 
which is upwards of 11,000 feet in thickness in the Schell Creek range 
of eastern Nevada.|| 

On the eastern side of the area, in Montana, 300 miles north of the 
Wasatch section of Utah, the deposit of Paleozoic sediment is less in 
volume. Dr. A. C. Peale's section gives 3,800 feet of limestone in 5,000 
feet of strata, f] This does not include the 0,000 feet or more of sedi- 
ments that occur below the fossiliferous Cambrian. I believe that the 
Paleozoic section will be found to be considerably thicker to the west- 
ward, in Idaho. Continuing to the north 450 miles, the sections meas- 
ured by Mr. E. G. McConnell give 29,000 feet of Paleozoic strata, 
including 14,000 feet of limestones.** In a " Note on the Geological 
Structure of the Selkirk Eange," Dr. (ieo. M. Dawson describes a sec- 
tion containing upwards of 40,000 feet of mechanical sediments, which 
he refers largely to the Cambrian.tt 

The Paleozoic limestones extend to the north, on the line of the east- 
ern Eocky Mountains, to the Arctic Ocean. In latitude oo° to CO^ 
north, the Devonian limestones are over 2,500 feet in thickness, and 
there are other still lower Paleozoic rocks that have not yet been 
studied in detail. The Devonian limestones extend 700 miles in the 
valley of the Mackenzie, from Great Slave Lake to below Fort Ciood

Hope.* No Carboniferous limestones have been described from this 
region. 

Tabulating the sections south from the Fifty-fifth parallel and allow- 
ing for a great thinning out of the sediments in Idaho and Montana, 
we obtain an approximate general average of 21,000 feet of strata, of 
which 6,000 feet are limestone over an area estimated to include 400,000 
square miles. Each square mile includes 27,878,400 cubic feet of 
limestone for each foot in thickness, and 167,270,400,000 cubic feet for 
a thickness of 6,000 feet, which, with an average of 12-5 cubic feet to 
the ton, gives 13,381,632,000 tons of limestone and imi^urities per 
square mile. The result of 10 analyses of clear limestones within the 
central portion of the area gives an average of 76-5 per cent of carbon- 
ate of lime.t Taking 75 per cent as the proportion of pure carbonate 
of lime (after deducting 50 per cent to allow for arenaceous and argil- 
laceous material in partings of strata, etc.), there remain 5,018,112,0t)0 
tons per square mile; multiplying this by 400,000 tlie result gives the 
number of tons of carbonate of lime that were deposited in what we 
know of the Cordilleran sea in Paleozoic time— or 2,007,244,800,000,000 
tons, or two thousand trillion tons in round numbers. 

The following mode of presentation of the above was suggested by 
Mr. Willis: 

'In order to proceed with a calculation of the period required to form 
this thickness of 15,000 feet of mechanical sediment i)lns 6,000 feet of 
calcareous sediment, it is necessary, first, to compute the cubic volumes 
of the sediments; second, to estimate the area from which tbey were 
derived; and, third, to divide the cubic contents of the sediments by 
this land area. The result thus obtained rej^resents the depth of ero- 
sion required to furnish the whole deposit, from which we may esti- 
mate the time under different assumptions of the rate of erosion. 

"But if we express amounts in cubic feet or tons the figures pass all 
comprehension; therefore to simplify the statement it is well to use a 
mile-foot as a unit of volume, that is, the volume of 1 mile square and 
1 foot thick. (1 mile-foot=0.79 kilometer-meter.) This is equal to 
223,000 tons, if 12J cubic feet of limestone equal 1 ton. 

"Thus stated, mechanical sediments covering 400,000 s(piare miles 
and 15,000 feet thick contain 6,000,000,000 mile-feet (4,740,000,000 kilo- 
meter-meters) ; and calcareous sediments covering the same area and 
6,000 feet thick correspond to 2,400,000,000 mile-feet (1,896,000,000 
kilometer-meters). In the calcareous sediments a liberal allowance of 
one-half may be made for arenaceous and argillaceous matter in the 
limestone and partings, and analyses of 10 clear limestones within the 
central part of the area give a little more than 75 i^er cent of carbonate 
of lime. Applying these reductions we get 000.000,000 mile-feet 
(711,000,000 kilometer-meters) of pure carbonate of lime."

towards the close of middle Cambrian time, than during subsequent 
Paleozoic time. It included a portion of tlie region to the eastward 
and i)robably a belt of land extending well toward the Pacific coast 
of the continental i)lateau. The interior (Mississippian) region, west 
of the ninetieth meridian, probably drained into the sea to the south, 
forming a Cambrian Mississippi river prior to middle Cambrian time. 
This limits the Cambrian drainage into the Cordilleran sea to an area 
estinmted at 1,000, 000 square miles. Tlie average thickness of mechan- 
ical sediments deposited before upper Cambrian time is estimated at 
irom 10,000 to 15,000 feet. Taking the minimum of 10,000 feet and the 
assumed drainage area of 1,000,000 square miles and the rate of denuda- 
tion at 1 foot in 1,000 years, it would have required 2,500,000 years to 
carry to the sea ami distribute the 10,000 feet of sediment. This means 
the deposition of O-OIS of an inch per year, which is very small if the 
supposed conditions of denudation and transportation were as favor- 
able as the character and mode of occurrence of the sediments indicate. 
If one-fourth of an inch per year is assumed as the rate of deposition, 
the 10,000 feet of sediment would have accumulated in 180,000 years 
or, in round numbers, in 500,000 years, which increases the rate of 
denudation to 1 foot in 200 years.* 

In dealing with the post-middle Cambrian mechanical sediments we 
have a somewhat different problem, but, as a whole, rapid deposition 
is indicated. For instance, the Eureka quartzite of the upj)er Ordo- 
vician is a bed of sandstone, varying from 200 to 400 feet in thickness, 
distributed over a wide area, perhaps 50,000 scpuire miles. It is made 
almost entirely of a white, clean sand that was deposited in so short 
an interval that the Trenton fauna in the limestone beneath it and in 
the limestones above it is essentially the same. The sand ai)pears to 
have been swept rapidly into the sea and distributed by strong cur- 
rents. The same is true of the 3,000 feet of the lower Carboniferous 



* By Mr. Willis' metliod {ante, p. 323) the nieclianical sedimeuts of tLe Paleozoic

total the greater part, namely, two-thirds or 4,000,000,000 mile-feet, are of Cambrian 
age. Dividing this volume hy the land area Just given, 1,600,000 square miles, we 
get 2,500 feet as the depth of erosion during the formation of the Camhrian mechan- 
ical sediments. Assuming different rates of erosion we may obtain times differing

sand ami the 13,000 feet in tlie upper portion of tlic Carboniferous, 
while the shales of the upper Devonian accumulated more slowly. In 
this connection we must bear in mind that during the long periods in 
which the calcareous sediments forming the liuiestones were being de- 
l)osited, the tributary land areas were, in all probability, base levels of 
erosion, and chemical denudation was pieparing a great supply of 
mechanical material that, on the raising of the land, was rapidly swept 
into the sea and distributed. In this manner the time period of actual 
mechanical denudation was nnxterially shortened, yet, on account of 
the manifestly slower depositions of the Devonian shales, the rate of 
denudation should be assumed as less than during Cambrian time. 

In post-Cambrian time the area of the land surface was materially 
reduced by subsid<?nce, which did not, however, greatly exteiul the 
Cordilleran sea, and it may fairly be estimated at 000,000 square miles. 
The depth of mechanical sediments already estimated is 5,000 feet and 
their volume 2,000,000,000 mile feet. Dividing the volume by the area 
of erosion we get 3,300 feet as the dei>th of erosion re(|uired.

The rate of 1 foot in 200 years is assumed as the most probable and 
660,000 years as the time required for the removal and dei)osition of 
the 5,000 feet of post-Cambrian mechanical sediments. 

There is one factor that may need to be taken into consideration in 
estimating the time duration of the deposition of the mechanical sedi- 
ments of the Cambrian and i»re(?)-( Cambrian of the northern i)ortioii of 
the Cordilleran sea that w^ould materially lengthen the period. Dr. 
George ]\I. Dawson describes the Nisconlith series, especially in the 
Selkirk range of British Columbia, as composed of ^'blacki.sh argillite- 
schists and phyllites, generally calcareous with some beds of limestone 
and quartzite, 15,000 feet."* It is correlated with the Bow KMver 
series, which contains, in theup])er portion, the lower Cambrian fauna. 
The presence of these calcareous beds indicates a slower rate of depo- 
sition than we have estimated for the lower portion of the Cambrian

series over tlie greater part of the Gordillerau sea; but as yet the corre- 
lation with the sediments of the Oordilleran sea is not sutticiently 
well established to warrant our allowing a greater time period to the 
Cambrian on this account. 

Estimates from chemical sedimentation.— We have estimated that the 
Paleozoic sediments of the Gordillerau sea contain 2,007,244,800,000,000 
[2 thousand trillion] tons (900,000,000 mile-feet) of carbonate of lime 
which was derived by organic or chemical agencies from the sea water 
to which it was contributed by the land. If oceanic circulation could 
be excluded from the problem we might proceed directly to estimate the 
time re(pnred to obtain this amount of lime from the land area tributary 
to the Gordillerau sea. It may be well to make such an estimate on the 
basis that the area of denudation tributary to the Gordillerau sea in post- 
middle Gambrian time had 000,000 S(iuare miles, from which 30,000,000 
tons of carbonate of lime and 12,000,000 tons of sulphate of lime were 
derived i)er annum* if we assume T. Mellard Ileade's rate of erosion — 
of oO tons of carbonate of lime and 20 tons of sulphate of lime per 
square mile per annum. If all of the 42,000,000 tons (eipud to 18-8 mile- 
feet) per annum were deposited within the limits of the Gordillerau sea, 
it would have taken 47,790,000 years for the accumulation of the carbo- 
nate of lime now estimated to have been deposited in the Gardilleran sea. 
Such a result is manifestly a maxinuim, based on the consideration of 
one set of phenomena. In addition, however, to this supply of calcium 
the geographic conditions appear to have been favorable to the free 
circulation of oceanic currents through the Gordillerau vsea, and the 
temperature was favorable to extensive evaporation and to the devel- 
opment of organic life, as shown by the occurrence of corals in the 
Middle and Upper portions of the Paleozoic, from the Mackenzie Kiver 
basin on the north to vsouthern Nevada on the south. These condi- 
tions would reduce the time necessary for the deposition of the carbon- 
ate of lime. 

Ocean water of the present time contains in solution 151,025,000 
tons of solid matter per cubic mile, which is divided among various salts. 
A comparison of the matter in the sea and river water shows that the 
sea contains 3.85 parts of magnesium to 1 of calcium, and river water 
contains 3 parts of calcium to 1 of magnesium. The silica and alumina 
of the river water disappear in sea water, while the sodium is accu- 
mulated. It is from these considerations and the fact that limestones 
are so largely formed of carbonate of lime that I have taken the latter 
as a basis for estimates upon the rate of cheaiical sedimentation, an 
allowance being made for the j^resence of silica, alumina, and magne- 
sium in the limestones. 

*Messrs. Murray and Renard consider that organisms have the power of secretiug 
the carbonate of lime from the sulphate of lime coutained in the sea -water by chem- 
ical reaction. For an account of the chemical action that takes place in the sea 
■water see report of the Deep-sea Deposits of the Challenger Expedition.

Rate of dejmsition in recent ileposlts. — Of the rate of depositiou in 
recent deposits Messrs. Murray and IJenard state, in tlieir report on 
the deep-sea deposits, that — 

" It must be admitted that at the present time we Inive no definite 
knowledge as to the absohite rate of accumulation of any deep-sea 
deposit, although we have some itifornuitioii and some indications as 
to the relative rate of accumulation of the different types of deposits 
among themselves. The most rapid accumulation ap})ears to take 
place in the terrigenous deposits, and especially in the Blue Muds, not 
far removed from the embouchures of large rivers. Here no great time 
would seem to have elapsed since the deposit was formed, so far at 
least as the materials collected by the dredge, trawl, and sounding tube 
are concerned. 

"Around some coral reefs the accumulation must be rapid, for, 
although i^elagic species with calcareous shells may be numerous in 
the surface waters, it is often impossible to detect more than an occa- 
sional pelagic shell among tlie otlier calcareous debris of the deposits. 

''The pelagic deposits as a whole, having regard to the nature and 
condition of their organic and mineralogical constituents, evidently 
accumulate at a much slower rate than the terrigenous deposits, in 
which the materials washed down from the land play so large a part. 
Tlie Pteropod and Globigerina oozes of the tropical regions, being 
chietiy made up of the calcareous shells of a much larger number of 
tro])ical species, must necessarily accumulate at a greater rate than the 
Globigerina oozes in extra- tropical areas or other organic oozes. Diatom 
ooze, being composed of both calcareous and siliceous organisms, has, 
again, a more rapid rate of deposition than the liadiolarian ooze, while 
in a lied Clay there is a minimum rate of growth."* 

Prof. James 1). Dana estimates that the rate of increase of coral reef 
limestone formation's, where all is most favorable, does not exceed per- 
haps a sixteenth of an inch a year, or 5 feet in 1 000 years. Of this he 
says: "And yet such limestones probably form at a more rapid rate 
than those made of shells.''t 

Messrs. Murray and Irvine, in their valuable paper on coral reefs 
and other carbonate of lime fornuitions in modern setis, calculate the 
total amount of calcium in the whole ocean to be (528,340,000,000,000 [628 
trillion] tons; also they estinnite that 92r>, 806,500 tons of calcium are 
carried into the ocean from all the rivers of the globe annually. At this 
rate it would take 680,000 years for the river drainage from the land to 
carry down an amount of calcium equal to that at present existing in 
solution in the whole ocean. They say further: "Again, taking the CArt/- 
leiKjer deposits as a guide, the amount of calcium in these deposits, if 
they be 22 feet thick, is equal to the total amount of calcium in solution 
in the whole ocean at the present time. It follows from this that if the 
salinity of the ocean has remained the same as at the present during 
the whole of this period, then it has taken 680,000 years for the deposits 
of the above thickness, or containing calcium in amount e(pial to that

the ocean.""* According to tliis calcnlation the mean rate ofaccnmn- 
lation over existing oceanic areas is ogoSuo or 0-000032 feet per annum. 

^Vas deposition of chemical sediments more rapid duriiuf Paleozoic 
timef — It has been claimed that the qnantity of lime poured into the 
ocean in earlier times was greater than during tlie later epochs of geo 
logical history, this arising from the more rapid disintegration of the 
Archean, crystalline, and volcanic rocks. It is undoubtedly a fact that 
the ocean was stocked in Archean and Algonkian times with matter in 
solution that produced salinity, but we have no evidence from chemi- 
cal precii)itation that more calcium was i)oured into it than could be 
retained in solution. The Laurentian limestones are crystalline, but, 
as has been shown, this texture is consistent with either chemical or 
organic origin. The unaltered liuiestones of the Algonkian rocks of 
the Colorado canyon section show traces of life iu tliin sections, and 
they may, to a great extent, be of organic origin. Tliere is no evidence 
in the texture, bedding, or composition of ancient limestones to indi- 
cate that they were deposited under conditions of salinity or of sui)ply 
diflering materially from those of the present, and 1 do not find that we 
have reason to believe that the deposition of the carbonate of lime was 
more rapid in the Paleozoic than during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic 
times, even though the snpi)ly from the land may have been greater. 
Where the conditions were favorable for the deposition of lime, as in 
the Cretaceous sea of northern Mexico, we find evidence of an immense 
accumulation of calcareous sediments. Of the amount of calcareous 
deposits in the seas outside of the continental areas that are not open 
to our inspection we know nothing, but judging from the deposition 
that is going on today in the great oceans, the accumulation of calca 
reous sediment has gone on in the past as steadily and uninterruittedly 
as at present, subject to varying conditions of temperature, life, depth 
of water, etc. 

Area of deposition in Paleozoic time. — We have no proof that the 
salinity of the sea or the amount of calcium contained in it has varied 
from age to age since Algonkian time. If it has not, all of the cal- 
cium poured into the ocean during 2,000,000 years would have about 
equaled the amount now contained in the limestones of the Cordilleran 
area. We have, however, to a(;couut for the calcium deposited in the 
interior Mississippian sea and the seas over other portions of this con 
tinent and other continental areas and on i)ortions of the tloor of the 
ocean that are not now accessible for observation. It is also to be con- 
sidered that the land areas subject to denudation in Paleoziuc time 
were, in all probability, of no larger extent than at the present time. 

The area of dry land to-day is estimated to be 55,000,000 squaic 
miles, and of oceans 137,200,000 square miles.t

Mr. T. JVrelliird lieade estimates the area of the Paleozoic forniatioiis 
of l^urope at (i4.-),C()() square miles in the total area of 3,7-!(),r)00 square 
miles. His estimate of the Paleozoic area is of that which is exposed 
at the present time and does not include that which is concealed 
beneath other formations, I think it will be ai minimum estimate to 
consider that an equal area is covered by the later formations, Avhich, 
with that exposed, would give in rouiul numbers 1,290,000 square miles, 
or one-third of the land area of Europe. In North America nearly 
one-half of the total area was covered by the Paleozoic sea; in South 
America it was considerably less; and we know too littleof the Asiatic 
and African continents to place any estimate upon their Paleozoic 
areas. I think, however, if Ave take one-fourth of the present land 
area as the territory covered by the Paleozoic seas we shall be con- 
siderably within the actual amount, even if we add to the surface of the 
continents the mar<iins of the continental platforms now beneath the 
sea. Deducting the one-fourth from the total land area, there remain 
41,250,000 square miles as the land area undergoing denudation during 
Paleozoic time. Tt may be claimed that large areas in the archipelago 
region of the I*acitic and in the Arctic ocean may have been land areas 
at that time. To meet this, 8,750,000 square miles may be added to 
the 41,250,000 giving a total of 50,000,000 square miles as the land 
area of Paleozoic time. 

The estimated areas of the various deep-sea deposits of to day con- 
taining a large percentage of tlie carbonate of lime, are as follows: 
(xlobigeriua ooze, 40,520,000 square miles, mean percentage of carbonate 
of lime, 64-53; Pteropod ooze, 400,000 square miles, i)ercentage of car- 
bonate of lime, 79-26; coral mud and sand, 2,556,000 square miles, 
mean percentage of carbonate of lime, 80-41. In addition to this. 
Diatom ooze covers an area of 10,880,000 square miles, with 22-96 per- 
centage of carbonate of lime; and the mean percentage of carbonate of 
lime inthe Blue ]Mud and other terrigenous deposits that cover 16,050,000 
square miles is 19-20. If we consider only those deposits containing 
over 64 per cent of carbonate of lime, we have 52,500,000 square miles, 
over which there is at the present time a deposition of the carbonate of 
lime being made. We have roughly estimated that in Paleozoic time 
the area of the Paleozoic sea, in which deposits were being accunm- 
lated, was over 13,000,000 square mile-s. It does not appear that there 
is any good reason to suspect that the area of deposition of t\ie car- 
bonate of lime in the open ocean during Paleozoic time was not fully 
equal to that of the present time. Adding this area of 52,500,000 to the 
13,750,000, we have over 66,000,000 stjuare miles as the probable area 
in which calcium was being deposited in Paleozoic time. 

Conditions favorable for a rapid deposition of the carbonate of lime. — 
The conditions most favorable for the rapid accumulation or deposition 
of the carbonate of lime through organic or chemictal agency are warm 
water and a constant supply of water through circulation by currents. 



330 GEOLOGIC TIME. 

This is shown l)y the inimense iibimdiuu-e of life where the margin of 
the continental plateau is touched by tlie d lulf Stream. Another favor- 
able condition is the supply of carbonate of lime l)y river water directly 
into the ocean in the vicinity where the deposition of lime is going ou 
either through "organic or inorganic agem-ies. This is well illustrated 
by the conditions produced by the Gulf Stream. The oceanic currents, 
l)assing alongthe northeastern coast of South America, sweep the waters 
of the Amazon through the Caribbean Sea into the Gulf of Mexico, 
where they meet the vast volume of water coming from the Mississippi. 
These are poured out through the narrow straits between Florida and 
Cuba and carried northward over the sloping margin of the continen- 
tal plateau. Under such favorable conditions the deposit must be 
much greater than in areas Avhere there is little circulation and the 
supply of calcium is limited to the average which is contained in sea 
water. If to the preceding there be added extensive evaporation within 
a partially inclosed sea, the rate of deposition of matter in solution 
will be largely increased. 

Estii)i<(te from deposition of calcium derived from CordiUenoi sea and 
the Older ocean, and from the deposition of mecltanical sediments. — The 
area over which calcareous deposition was going ou during Paleozoic 
time we have estin)ated at Gr>,()0(>,(K)(> square miles, which includes the 
areas of the seas over the continental platforms and those of the sur- 
rounding oceans. As the conditions appear to have been more favor- 
able for the deposition of lime in the Cordilleran and Appalachian seas, 
we will assume that it was four times that of the open oceans.* With 
a land area of oO,()00,000 square miles and a rate of chemical denuda- 
tion of 70 tons per Sfjuare mile per annum, the total calcium contributed 
to the ocean per year during Paleozoic time would be 3,500,000,000 tons, 
or 3-78 times as uuicli as that estimated per annum at the present time, 
which is 925,866,500 tons. This would have i)rovided 50-7 tons for de- 
position ])er annum per square mile in the 65,000,000 square miles of 
ocean and seas, and 202-8 tons for deposition per annum per square nule^ 
in the 400,000 s(]uare miles of the Cordillerau and 600,000 square miles 
of similar seas. On this basis 81,120,000 tons (36-4 mile-feet) were con- 
tributed per annum from the ocean water to the deposit in the Cordilleran 
sea; adding to this the 42,000,000 tons (18-8 mile feet) contributed per 
annum by the denudation of the. surrounding area to the Cordilleran 
sea, we have 123,120,000 tons (55-2 mile-feet) as the amount available 

* Under the retlnction of 50 per ceut for the interbedded and iutermiugled niedian- 
ical sediments and 25 per cent for other nniterial than caleinm deposited from solu- 
tion, Iho apparent amount of calcium deposited in the Cordilleran sea was greatly 
reduced. If this same ratio of reduction is applied to other Paleozoic limestone 
areas I doubt if over 1,000,000 square miles will be found to contain as large an 
average amount of calcium per square mile as the Cordilleran area. On this account 
1,000,000 scjuare miles is the area taken for the greater rate of deposition of calcium 
duriui-' Paleozoic time. 



GEOLOGIC TIME. 331 

for deposit i^er annum in the Cordilleran sea. At this rate it would have 
required 10,300,000 years to have deposited the 15,007,244,800,000,000 
{2 thousand trillion] tons (900,000,000 mile-feet) of calcium in the Cor- 
dilleran sea; adding- to this the 1,200,000 years estimated for the depo- 
sition of the mechanical sediments, we have a total of 17,500,000 years 
as the duration of Paleozoic time. 

In reviewing the preceding estimates we must consider that through- 
out I have increased the various factors above those usually accepted — 
thus for mechanical sedimentation the erosion of 1 foot in 200 years is 
used. If the usually accepted average of 1 foot in 3,000 years is taken 
the time period must be increased fifteen fold (21,000,000 years), or the 
area of denudation from 1,600,000 square miles to 24,000,000, or three 
times the present area of the North American Continent. 

In the estimate for the amount of chemical denudation, the largest 
average is taken — 70 tons of calcium per S(piare mile per annum — and 
the assumption made that all calcium derived from the adjoining drain- 
age area was deixjsited within the Cordilleran sea. Again, the total 
supply provided i>er annum to ocean waters of Paleozoic time is taken 
as 3-78 times greater than the amount annually contributed to ocean 
waters to-day; of this four times as much is assumed to have been 
taken out per annum per S(iuare mile in the Cordilleran sea as was 
taken by the remaining area in which calcium was being deposited. 

The area of the Cordilleran sea is given as 400,000 square miles, but 
it was probably 000,000, if not much more. It maybe claimed that the 
area tributary to the Cordilleran sea was greater than I have estimated. 
The evidence, such as it is, is against such a view. As a whole, I think 
the estimate of 17,500,000 years for the duration of Paleozoic time in 
the Cordilleran area is below the minimum rather than above it. 

If the estimated rate of the deposition of coral limestones — 5 feet in 
1,000 years — given by Prof. James D. Dana is correct, the 19,000 feet 
of Paleozoic limestone in central Nevada would have required 3,800,000 
years to have accumulated under the most favorable local conditions 
surrounding a coral reef. With the exception of large deposits of 
corals in Devonian rocks no appearance of a coral reef is recorded in 
the Cordilleran area. 

TIME RATIOS OF GEOLOGIC PERIODS. 

The time ratio adopted by Prof. James D. Dana for the Paleozoic, 
Mesozoic, and Cenozoic periods is, 12, 3, and 1, respectively.* I*rof. 
Henry S. Williams applies the term {/eochronology, giving the standard 
time unit used the name geocJirone. The geochrone used by him in 
obtaining a standard scale of geochronology is the period represented 
by the Eocene. His time scale gives 15 for the Paleozoic, 3 for the 
Mesozoic, and 1 for the Cenozoic, including the Quaternary and the 
Eecent. t

He draws from this the principle: " The proper reJatire measure of

those periods.^''* 

In considering the time ratios for the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Ceno- 
.zoic rocks of the North American continent as given by Dana and 
Williams, I think that a too small proi)ortion has been given to the 
Mesozoic and Cenozoic. In the Mesozoic of the western central area 
occur the coal deposits of the Laramie series and the great development 
of limestones (from 10,000 to 20,000 feet) in the Cretaceous of Mexico. 
The limits of this paper do not ])ermit of a discussion of the available 
data bearing upon geologic time ratios; but from a comparison of the 
Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic strata and the geologic phenomena 
accompanying their deposition, I would increase the comparative length 
of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic periods so that the time ratios would be : 
Paleozoic, 12; Mesozoic, 5; Cenozoic, including Pleistocene, 2. 

DURATION OF POST-ARCHEAN (rEOLOdlC TIME. 

Taking as a basis 17,500,000 years for Paleozoic time, and the time 
ratios 12, 5, and 2 for Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic (including 
Pleistocene), res])ectively, the Mesozoic is given a time duration of 
7,240,000 years; the Cenozoic, of 2,000,000 years, and the entire series 
of fossiliferous sedimentary rocks, of 27,6r)O,00O years. To this there 
is to be added the period in which all of the sediments were deposited 
between the basal crystalline Archean complex and the base of the 
Paleozoic, Notwithstanding the immense accumulation of mechanical 
sediments in this Algonkian time, with their unconformities, and the 
great dififerentiation of life at the beginning of Paleozoic time, I am not 
willing with our present information to assign a greater time period than 
that of the Paleozoic — or 17,500,000 years. Even this seems excessive. 
Adding to it the time period of the fossiliferous sedimentary rocks, the 
result is 45,150,000 years for post- Archean time. Of the duration of

Archenn or pie-Algonkiaii time I have no estimate based on a study of 
Archean strata to offer. If we assume Houghton's estimate of 33 per 
cent for the Azoic period and 07 per cent for the sedimentaiy rocks, 
Archoan time wouhl l)e represented by the period of 22,250,000 years. 
In estimating for the Archean, Houghton inchided a large series of 
strata that are now placed in the Algonkian of the Proterozoic of the 
U. S. Geological Survey; and T think that his estimate is more than 
one-half too large; if so, 10,000,000 years would be a fair estimate, or 
rather conjecture, for Archean time. 




It is easy to vary these results by assuming different values for area 
and rate of denudation, the rateof deposition of carbonate of lime, etc.; 
but there remains after each attempt I have made that was based on 
any reliable facts of thickness, extent, and character of strata, a result 
that does not pass below 25,000,000 to 30,000,000 years as a mininnim 
and 60,000,000 to 70,000,000 years as a maximum for post- Archean geo- 
logic time. 

I have not referred to the rate of developmeni, of life, as that is 
virtually controlled by conditions of environment. 

In conclnsion, geologic time is of great but not of indertnite <luration. 
I believe that it can l)e measured by tens of millions, but not by single 
millions or hundreds of millions, of years.

THE AGE OF THE EARTH.* 



By Clarence King. 



Among the vari(»us attempts to estimate geological time none lias 
ofleied a more attractive field for lurtlier develoi)ment than Lord Kel- 
vin's mode of limiting the eartii's age from considerations of its prob- 
able rate of refrigeration, pnblished in 186U.+ At that time the conse- 
quences of his physical reasoning could not be fully applied to the con- 
ditions within the earth, so as to test the probability of his hyi)othet- 
ical case, for want of positive knowledge of certain properties of rocks, 
particularly the volume changes of melted rock in approaching and 
experiencing congelation, and the qualitative and quantitative effects 
of pressure upon the fusion and freezing points. Data then lacking are 
for the first time available, and with them it is proposed to apply a new 
criterion to the gradient of Lord Kelvin and to compare with it other 
cases of more probable earth-temperature distribution, which should 
have the effect of advancing his method of determining the earth's age 
to a further order of importance. 

Accepting the hitherto unshaken results of Kelvin and G. A. Darwin 
as to the tidal effective rigidity of the earth, and the further argument 
for rigidity advanced by Prof. S. Newcombf from the data of the lately 
ascertained periodic variation of terrestrial latitude, as together war- 
ranting a firm belief in the rigid earth, it follows that solidity may be 
used as a criterion to test the probable truth of many cases of earth 
temperature distribution; at least so far as to justify the rejection of 
such as involve considerable liquidity of the upper couches. In an 
earth of which the superficial quarter of radius is composed of mate- 
rials that contract from the fluid condition toward and in the act of 
congelation, any temperature gradient in which the downward heat 
augmentation exceeds the rate by which advancing pressure raises the 
fusion point, would obviously reach a fused couche, and all such distri- 
butions may be rejected as violating the requirements of rigidity.

336 THE AGE OF THE EARTH. 

A recent investigation of tlie rock diabase in its relations to lieat 
and i)ressure etlers tlie formerly lacking means of testing the admissi- 
bility of many cases of earth-temperature distribution from the point 
of view of solidity. Ten years ago in a laboratory established by me 
in connection with the U, S. Geological Survey, Dr. Carl Barns began 
a series of experimental researches tending toward the solution of some 
of tlie Tuiknown bnt important points of geological physics. It has 
been my i)rivilege to indicate the direction of much of the inquiry. 
The understanding between us maintained his entire independence in 
the mode and ])rosecution of the investigations, and secured for him the 
fnllest lesponsibility and credit for the purely i)hysical results, many 
of which have at intervals appeared in this aud other Journals. For 
myself was reserved the privilege of making geological api>lications of 
tlie laboratory results. One of the most important of these is Dr. 
Barus's lately completed determination of the latent heat of fusion, 
specitic heats melted and solid, and volume expansion between the 
solid and melted state, of the rock diabase.* To him I am also very 
generally indebted for aid in considering the present problem. 

Diabase was chosen l)y me as fairly illnstrative of the probable den- 
sity and composition of the surface O-O.") or ()-04 of the earth's radius. 
For Laplace's law of distribution, density at the surface is taken ar 
2 7;") and down one-tenth of radius at 3-8S, yielding- a mean density of 
the whole tenth of '^-oo and for the uppcir ti\ e-hundredths of about 3. 
For the whole tenth a rock like the extremely heavy basalt of Baren- 
steint (sp. gr. 3-;)5) would api)roach closely a fair mean expression of 
density. Typical hornblende andesite comes closest to the average 
density at the suriace, but diabase (sp. gr. 2*8 to 3), nearly enough fills 
the conditions of the shell which this study seeks to investigate. The 
particular diabase under <*xaminatiou came from Jersey City, and was 
taken from the immediate vicinity of the Pennsylvania llailroad cut.

Astronomical and geodetic requirements make necessary that density

not twice that of diabase, whence it appears that no probable chemical 
distribution of material could result in a surface couche of 0-05 of 
radius liaviuj;' a greater specific gravity than 3- to 3-3. 

\Valtershausen,t in his interesting scheme of chemical distribution, 
attempts to account for the augmentation of density chiefly by the 
increase of the heavy bases, but leaves the whole surface tenth of radius 
iu silicates. Eruptions of alkaline earths or metals are unknown. In 
fact, with the exception of carbonates of superficial origin the whole 
visible body of the crust is of silicates, and the earliest rocks are seen 
to be made of the debris of still older ones. All that can be said is 
that there is absolutely no known reason why the surface tentli of radius 
may not be of silicates, nor why specific material of widely different 
thermal properties from diabase should be postulated. 

The two principal conditions within the interior of the earth, upon 
which physical state and all purely i)hysical reactions of the specific 
materials depend, are the distributions from center to surface of pres- 
sure and heat. Secular or sudden variations of either or both have the 
power, if carried sufficiently fiir, to disturb chemical and physical equi- 
librium and produce changes of volume, rigidity, viscosity, and con- 
ductivity, as well as changes of state from liquidity to solidity, and the 
reverse. Before proceeding to consider in detail some of the results of 
heat and pressure as existing in the surface 0-05 of radius, it is desira- 
ble to glance at the relations of these two great antagonistic energies 
in the whole radius. Plate xvii gives earth pressures from Laplace's law 
expressed in a gradient of which the ordinates are 100,000 atmospheres 
(larger divisions 1,000,000 atmospheres) and the abscissaj tenths of 
radius. Upon the same diagram are delineated two hypothetical cases 
of earth temperature, the abscissie remaining as for the pressure line, 
tenths of radius, and the ordinates corresponding in interval to the 
100,000 atmospheres lines, are taken as each 1,000° C. The left verti- 
cal boundary of the plate represents the center of the earth and the 
right one the surface. The upper heat gradient corresponding to a tem- 
perature of 3,000° C. at the earth's center is the 100 x 10^ curve of Kel- 
vin. The lower is computed for a central temi)eratuie of 1,711° C, 
about the melting point of platinum, and a secular cooling in 20x10^ 
years. Data for the construction of these gradients are given in the 
tables a few paragraphs later. The feature here called attention to is 
the exceedingly slight change of temperature from very near the sur- 
face downward to the center. In the Kelvin gradient even after the 
lapse of 100 x 10^ years the original maximum temi)erature is reached 
within 0-05 of radius and remains thence unchanged to the center. 
Pressure, on the other hand, augments with one downward sweep 
through theentire radius. On plate xvii its line is seen cutting both tem- 
perature gradients near the surface, passing the 1,741° C. line at a 
pressure of 175 000 atmospheres, and the Kelvin line at 390,000 atmos-

plieres; tlience steadily augiiieiitiii.i;- until at the center it readies the 
impressive figure of 3,01 8, 0(K) atmospheres. 

Since we are to look to heat and i>ressnre for the keys totlie physical 
condition of the matter of the earth, it is important to realize from the 
relation of these gradients, first, that the great effect of heat in oppos- 
ing and overcoming the results of i^ressure must be limited to superficial 
earth-depths not exceeding 20^ miles for an earth of the Kelvin 
assumptions; secondly, that below this depth and onward to the center 
there is a complete reversal of relations and a great and continual 
increase of i^ressure available to oppose and destroy the volumetric 
and other molecular effects of a temperature which has ceased to 
increase. The empire of heat over pressure is thus seen to be purely 
superficial, while that of pressure ov^r heat begins not far below the 
surface and extends more and more powerfully to the center. This is 
obviously true only for such moderate assumptions of heat and time 
as are given in the gradients on Plate xvii, but it will be shown later 
that these figures are, upon the criterion of solidity, far more probable 
than very hot or very old earths. 

Out of the infinite number of jiossible earth-temperature gradients 
to discriminate the i^robably trne case, is of critical imi)ortance in any 
attemi)t to determine the earth's thermal age or to delimit the period 
of active geological dynamics. 

PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE TAHLES. 

The following tables offer figures for the construction of the pressure 
and some of the temperature gradients on both Plates xvii and xviii. 
Data for the distribution of earth pressure may be obtained either from 
the formula of Laplace or that of G, 11. Darwin for radial earth density, 
combined with tlie known decrease of terrestrial gravitation from 
center to surfjice. 

In table 1, Laplace's law is used as giving the most conservative 
values of density at great depths. For the superficial 0-2 of radius, 
however, the two density laws are near together, and as the thermal 
phenomena which determine the earth's age are probably wholly in the 
surface tenth, either law might be applicable to the present purpose. 
As, however, Darwin's law requires a surface density of 3-7, while 
Lajilace only 2*75, the latter accords better with the average si)ecific 
gravity of superficial rocks and is therefore here preferred. 

Tables 2, 3, and 4 give data for three temperature gradients derived 
by mechanical quadrature from the well known Fourier ecjuation in the 
manner given by Lord Kelvin, and are considered assutticieut in num- 
ber and variety to indicate the character of the data; figures for the 
other gra<lients shown on Plate ii are therefore omitted.

THE CHART. 

The chart constituting Plate xviii is constructed to present the pas- 
sage of certain hypothetical temperature gradients through the upper- 
most O.OS of the eartirs radius, and the position in the same held of 
Earus's line nuxrking the melting point in depth of diabase, thus defining 
the relations of the various distributions of earth-temperature to liq- 
uidity. The value of the ordinates is each 1,000'^ C. the abscissae, which 
are platted as etpial in length to the ordinates, rei)reseiit hundredths of 
radius counting downward from the surface whicli is indicated by the 
right vertical boundary of the chart. 

Kelvin's applicatiou of the Fourier equation involves an assumed ini- 
tial excess of temperature, and assigned value of rock conductivity, a 
given period of secular cooling, and the surface rate of augmentation of 
earth-temperature. As thus applied to the case of the cooling earth, it is 
obvious that while the body was of uniform initial heat there would be 
no augmeutatiou of temperature from the surface dowuwardjor other-

THE AGE OF THE EARTH. 341 

wise expressed, the surface rate would be o-.; but tlie monieut refrige- 
ration began a finite rate of downward increment would be established. 
Since the earth's surface is represented on the chart by the right 
vertical boundary, that line would be the thermal distribution for the 
rate oo. A complete process of refrigeration would cause the rate to 
decline until the earth reaches the temperature of space and the line 
of initial tangency coincides with radius, and the rate 0. The angular 
relation of the initial tangent of the present as compared with that of 
the rate cc is determined from observed surface augmentation. 

The value of the integral and the surface rate for any gradient does 
not change if conductivity and age vary reciprocally, and the surface 
rate does not change if the initial excess of temperature varies at the 
same rate as the square root of the product of conductivity and the 
time of secular cooling. If the square root of the product of conduc- 
tivity and age be increased any number of times, and the depth also be 
increased the same number of times, temperature remains unchanged 
if the initial excess is unchanged, but if the initial excess changes, 
temperature will change in the same ratio. 

Upon the chart are delineated two families of temperature distri- 
butions. Those in continuous lines, lettered a to /, are calculated in 
accordance with the maximum surface rate of 50, G feet to 1° F., being 
the generally accepted rate at the time Kelvin's curve was published. 
Those in dotted line, and lettered g to /, are constructed for the rate of 
75 feet to 1° F., the smallest of the observed inland rates. It is the 
value given by Hallock * for the recently completed boring uear 
Wheeling, W. Va. The last published value as reduced from all avail- 
able data by the B. A. committee is 64 feet to 1° F. It is therefore 
extremely probable that unless some general but unrecognized cause, 
like a variation of temperature due to the chemical action of hot water 
and progressive downward either with heat or pressure, tends to raise 
or lower the mean rate, the true surface distribution falls between the 
values of 50.0 and 75 feet per o f. upon which the two families of 
gradients are based. 

The diabase line for melting temperature and depth 1) D is traced from 
its superficial fusion point, 1,170° C. downward, according to the law 
established by Dr. Harus and expressed in table 5. This is the special 
point of interest in the chart and in 'the conclusions to Avhich it gives 
rise. In passing from this surface value of 1,170° 0. through 0.1 of the 
radius, the fusion temperature is raised to 6,139° C. ; continuing thence 
to the center of the earth it reaches the surprising value of 7(»,20U° C. 
In consequence in an earth all of diabase any temperature gradient 
having an initial excess of less than the above central value must in 
reaching the surface either intersect the line D I) twice or fall wholly 
beneath it. Since this line represents melting temperature, any point 
vertically above it in the chart is necessarily more highly heated than

tlio inciting teni]>eratnre for the sanie deptli, and henre in fnsion. Con- 
versely, any jiomt below the diabase line, being' below the melting tem- 
perature for that pressure and depth, falls into solidity. Thus the chart 
IS divided into two areas by the bne, that above it representing Huidity, 
and that below, solidity. For a diabase earth to have been wholly 
melted an initial excess of 70,200''' C. would be rcipiired. Obviously 
any earth having an initial excess of less than the surtace melting point 
1,170° C. wonhl have been always completely solid. Any initial excess 
above that ligure and below 70,200^' C. requires, at the moment before 
refrigeration began, a solid nucleus and a fused zone above it extend- 
ing to the surface, and the lower the initial excess the larger the solid 
nucleus of compression and shallower the initial couche of surface 
fusion. Knowing the law of the rise of the fusion-point it is a simple 
matter of coinputatioii to determine, for any assumed initial excess, 
exactly the radial value of the original solid nucleus and of the original 
supernatant liuid couche. For the region covered by the chart these 
values may be directly scaled off. 

Fourier's equation enables us to go further and assuming that refrig- 
eration is the result of conduction alone, to determine the temperature 
distribution for any given period of refrigeration, and what is of particu- 
lar geological interest — the rate at whicli the fused couche is encroached 
upon by an overlying superficial crust of congelation, and the exist- 
ence, depth, temperature, and pressure differences of any residual fluid 
couche between the upper and lower solids. The relation therefore of 
any temperature gradient to the diabase line oft'ers an immediate test 
of its admissibility as a probable case. Any temperature gradient 
that in passing across the area of the chart from below to the surface 
intersects the diabase line must in reaching the low temperatures of 
the surface intersect it again, and the zone included between the pair 
of points of intersection being above the line, and hence for that inter- 
val of radius above the fusion temperatures, must be a melted shell, 
and as on the criterion of solidity the existence of any considerable 
fusion is precluded, such a case of temperature distribution may be 
rejected. 

I will now trace the several temperature distributions upon the chart, 
and note their relations to time and solidity, beginning with the family 
delineated in continuous lines (surface rate 50.0 feet to 1*^ F.). Line b, 
the gradient of Kelvin, 3,900° 0. initial excess, 100 x 10'^ years secular 
cooling, is seen to enter the chart from the lower regions, maintaining 
even to the shallow depth of 220 miles from the surface, practically, 
its original maxiinuin temperature. From the center of the earth up 
to this point it has remained in the initial solid of compression. At 
the depth noted it intersects the diabase line and jiasses into fusion. 
Since almost the full initial temperature is maintained up to its inter- 
section, it follows that that depth nearly marks the original surface of 
the solid nucleus and that the distance of 220 miles thence to the sur- 



THE AGF. OF THE EARTH. 343 

face measures the depth of the oiigiiial conche of fusion. FoUowing 
the g'radient toward the surface, it is seen (after desci'ibiug its great 
convexity in the tinid region) to intersect the diabase line a second time 
and enter a congealed shell or crust formed by cooling a surface portion 
of the initial fused couclie, and leaving between the nucleus and crust 
a residual present shell of fusion of 1200 mdes from the top to the bot- 
tom. The obvious tidal instability of a 20 mile crust resting ui)on 1200 
miles of truly tinid magma is sufficient basis for the rejection of this 
particular case of temperature distribution. To fulfill tbe require- 
ments of rigidity either the time of cooling must be vastly greater to 
admit of entire congelation, or the initial excess materially less. 

As an illustration of the first of these alternatives, gradient c with 
the same initial excess as h (S.OOC^ C) has been developed to complete 
solidity, which on computation proves to have required about GOO x 10'' 
years, at which time it has but just reached tangeucy wntli the diabase 
line. Yet we are al)Solutely precluded from accei)ting it as a probable 
case and assigning 000 x 10'' years as tlie age of the earth, because the 
temperature values of its emergence at the surface fall below even the 
75 feet to 1° F. surface rate. Its emergence is at a rate of 0-0081° F. 
per foot (124 feet per ° F.), which is far less than the (Hallock) rate 
used in the dotted gradients, itself much less than tlie accepted mean

Gradient ^/, 1,950° C. initial excess, and 15x 10'' years secular cooling, 
falls still some millions of years short of solidity. The initially fused 
surface conche was about 00 miles in depth, the i)resent crust 33 miles 
thick, and the present residual tluidity of 33 miles depth from top to 
bottom. Here again the liquid zone involves tidal instability and 
requires the rejection of the line. 

Gradient e offers more satisfactory conditions: With an initial excess 
of 1,750° C'., about the normal melting point of platinum, and an age of 
20x10*^ years, a condition is reached w^hich throws the convexitj^ of 
the gradient below the diabase line in complete solidity and fulfills all 
the conditions. Here then is a possible age for an earth of diabase. 
Its initial surface couche of fusion would have been about 53 miles, and 
is now^ wholly cooled into solid crust and united with the original solid 
nucleus of coin])ression. 

(xradient /■, initial excess 1,230° C. and 10x10'" years secular cooling, 
would in its first stage have shown only about 5 or miles of surface 
fusion, w'hich would very shortly have cooled into solidity. 

For those whose interest centers in earths of great age and high 
temperature, gradient a is given, initial excess 7,800° C and 400x10*'

would not reach solidity until over 1,500 x 10'^ years, a truly uniformi 
tarian specimen.

spite of its long cooling even after 237x10'* years it is still very far 
from solidity. Of tbe original Huid conche of 22G miles, only about CO

Comparison of gradients of equal initial excess and successively 
longer periods of secular cooling sbows tbe ratio of tbeir retreat from 
rigbtto left across tbe cbart or from lower to bigber values of deptb 
and time.

face rate is seen to bave declined furtber and furtber from tbe original

nunu rate tbence declining into tbe region of inadmissible rates. 

Tbe probable conditions of tbe true gradient are as to initial excess 
and age sucb as fall below tbe diabase line into solidity and emerge at 
the surface with a rate wbicb bas not declined below tbe mean (B A) 
rate of 04 feet to 1*^ F. From tbe point of view of solidity no gradient 
of initial excess above 2,000° 0. is admissible; tbat of 2,500° C, even 
after 100 x lO'' years cooling, still sbows a dee)) sbell of fusion (04 miles 



THE AGE OF THE EARTH. 345 

from top to bottom), nucl since it emerges on the minimum i-iite it lias 
already iallen below the admissible tangent. 

Gradient d, 1,050° C. and 15x10*' years, just cooled to the maximum 
surface rate, has still an inadmissible fluid shell, but if refri.yeration 
had beeu continued for 7 x 10'' to 9 x lO*' years more the line would have 
fallen below the solidity line and its surface rate would not have passed 
tlie mean value. Hence a 1,050'^ 24x10'' year earth is possible and 
marks about the superior limit admissible for initial excess. 

From the iwint of view of age no greater time of cooling is allowable 
than enough to bring the gradient for any initial excess to the mean 
surface rate. Thus the condition for excess and age exclude a line of 
over 2,000° C and 24 x 10'^ years. Conductivity remaining of the value 
used, any higher excess involves fluidity, and anj^ greater age an inad- 
missible surface rate. 

To the extent, therefore, that solidity is a valid criterion and so far 
as the melting temperature of diabase maybe supposed to apply to the 
depth examined, there is no escape from an earth of the low age and 
temperature given except by impugning the rate of surface augmenta- 
tion and the value of rock conductivity here employed. 

Whoever has examined the B. A. committee's reports and summaries 
on underground temperatures must have realized the obstacles to the 
evaluation of a true mean rate. The range of observations is wide, 
from high rates due to residual vulcanism to low ones produced by 
neighboring bodies of cold water, such as are described by Wheeler 
from mines near Lake Superior.* It is not however likely that by 
rejecting anomalies and assigning probable weight to further observa- 
tions the i^resent value will be moved to an important extent. 

We have seen that all probable distributions of earth temperature 
involve in the initial stage a great solid nucleus, practically the whole 
body of the earth, with a shallow surface shell of fusion. In the case 
of the 1,741° C, 20 x 10" year earth there was an initial melted shell 
of 53 miles. Obviously it can not be correct to apply the rock-conduc- 
tivity value obtained at air temperatures and normal pressure to even 
so young and cool an earth with its couche of an initial temperature 
of 1,741° C. and a pressure difference between the top and bottom 
of 22,000 atmospheres. The probable method of cooling the couche into 
solidity, involves three corrections of the accepted rate of refrigeration : 
a, acceleration of the process by i)Ossible convection; h, the direct 
effect of heat and j)ressure up;)n conductivity, and c, the relative con- 
ductivity of matter at the some temperature, liquid and solid. 

a. Convection. Leaving out of present consideration possible poly- 
merization of the magma, or the descent of solid bodies of crust, ver- 
tical transfers of the liquid matter in the fused couche depend upon 
differences of density and this upon the ratio of the rates at which 
density is raised by pressure and lowered by heat. Isometrics of melted

rock under high pressure are of conrse beyond the reacli of experimen- 
tation, hence we are forced to h)ok to those of the avaihible nmterials. 
Isometrics from high-pressure observations have been found to slope as

Since ether boils at 34° C. and dyphenylamine at SIO'^ C, the range 
here given is wide. It is reasonable, therefore, to take the mean value, 
lli'5 atmospheres per ° C, as an index of the slope sought for. In the 
Kelvin earth this rate occurs between O-OIO and 0-015 of radius, the 
crust being 0-0065 of radius thick. In so far therefore as the isomet- 
rics can be regarded as parallel straight lines with a slope of the order 
of the value given above, convection can only have taken place in the 
first 52 miles of the initial couche of fusion, and in the present resid- 
ual couche of 200 miles only the upper 2C> miles would be subject to 
convection. In younger earths the above value per ° 0. will be found 
much nearer the surface, so that in them convection would be confined 
to a shell, which is shallow ni proportion as the earth is young. Ini 
tially when the whole earth was at one temperature there could have 
been no convection, since the change of temperature in depth was w«7, 
but the change of density due to pressure was always pronounced. In 
the case of the 1,7410 C. earth the zone of convection would have early 
been covered and extinguished by the thickening crust, and therefore 
would have played no very important part in accelerating the loss of 
heat, and thus for this particular initial excess is of small effect in 
shortening the estimate of earth's age. 

h. The direct effects of heat and pressure upon the conductivity of 
matter under such high temperature and pressures are also beyond lab- 
oratory investigation, and again we are driven to use the determined 
conduci^ivity value unmodified, or seek for some other property which 
may be considersd as its approximate measure. Such an index is found 
in viscosity, which if not of high quantitative signilicance in defining 
the changing values of terrestrial conductivity in depth, nevertheless 
aflbrds data applicable at least for determining the sign of an import- 
ant coirection. 

Dr. I>arus has lately determined that at least 200 atmospheres of 
pressure are required per 1° C. in order that viscosity may remain con- 
stant. Examining several temperature distributions of the chart and 
applying the computed augmentation of earth pressure, itai)pears that 
the required relation (200 atmospheres to 1° C.) is found at successively 
lower depths for successively higher values of initial excess and age- 
In the 1,741° C. case the relation after 20x 10 « years' cooling is found 
at about 010 of radius counting from the surface, where the vertical

broken line r v of the chart intersects the gradient and marks tlie locus 
of stationary viscosity. As above this point teniperatnre relatively to 
pressure lias augmented more rapidly than the ratio recjuired for con- 
stant viscosity, it follows that viscosity has been diminished by temper- 
ature more than it has been raised by pressure. Below the stationary 
point, on the other hand, an excess of jiressure above the reqnired ratio 
is available for increase of viscosity. 

For the gradient of 3,900'^ C. excess the transitional depth is indi- 
cated by the intersection of the broken line T^ V. In both cases the 
transitional points occupy positions in their respective gradients not 
far below their full initial temperatures, and pressure having been most 
stationary the transitional points have moved but little during the 
whole period of secular cooling, and the earth shells passing through 
them have divided radius into a lower solid of higher viscosity and a 
surface couche, partly liquid, partly solid of lower viscosity. So far 
therefore as viscosity indicates the behavior of conductivity, that also 
should have been systematically diminished (relatively to the surface 
value obtained at normal pressure and temperatures and used iu the 
construction of the gradients) 
from the surface downward for 
a small fraction of radius, till 
at the appropriate depth for 
each excess and age of cooling 
it reaches a transitional value 
and thence increases. 

How this correction, of at 
present unknown value, aft'ects 
the coordinates of a given gra- 
dient qualitatively, is shown 
by the following figure, in 
which are given the diabase 
melting point and pressure R ^ 

line, T) D, gradient b of 3,900° C. excess and 100x10" years' cooling, 
with the viscosity transitional line V V intersecting it, also a dotted 
line c, indicating the position of the b gradient corrected for diminished 
conductivity (viscosity). 

Lagging to the right of the uncorrected gradient, obviously the dotted 
line would require longer refrigeration to reach the state of solidity, 
and it is equally important to note that its ])osition requires its emer- 
gence at the surface with a higher rate than the uncorrected line, and 
thus extends the time of cooling down to the mean rate which marks 
for all gradients the present limit of the process. 

c. Liquid-solid conductivity. Closely involved in the above heat- 
pressure-viscosity correction is the change of conductivity on passing 




348 THE AGE OF THE EARTH. 

isothermally from solid to licjuid. llere again the results of Dr. Hanis* 
throw important light. 

The relatively higher thermometric conductivity of the solid over the 
liquid of equal temperature indicates au additio-nal plus correction for 
time values. 

Both the minus correction due to convection, and the plus corrections 
based upon conductivity diminished below the Everett tigures, sink in 
importance as we i^ass from earths of higher to those of lower initial 
excess, so that until some approximate quantitative values can be given 
them we have no warrant for extending the earth's age beyond 
24,000,000 years. 

That the application of the criterion of solidity here made to Kel- 
vin's method is o])en to the objection of being based on the physical 
relations of an extremely superficial fraction of radius is obviously 
true. Ignorance of the deeper interior distribution of specific materials 
and of their relations to the degree of heat and the range of pressure 
to which they are subjected forbids the construction of a generalized 
line of melting temperatures for the whole of radius. 

It might therefore be contended that a reversal of the diabase con- 
ditions is possible, and the deeper materials may possess the property 
of ice fusion, their melting temperatures suffering depression in>>stead 
of elevation. The high densities required in lower earth depths have 
constantly suggested the concentration there of heavy metals and the 
examples of meteorites has further influenced the idea of a metallic 
nucleus chiefly of iron. And as iron at normal pressure unmistakably 
exhibits ice fusion, any great iron mass at the center might be sup- 
posed to exist as a licpiid in spite of the enormous pressure there 
exerted. 

The distribution of materials and of '' state" under this assumption 
involves a metallic (iron) nucleus, liquid from ice fusion, overlaid by 
less dense couches which at some unassignable depth pass into sili- 
cates of the diabase type, solid from compression under the law shown 
for diabase, and solid to the surface as required by tidal effective rigid- 
ity. 

Ice fusion however is au exceptional phenomenon, nor have we any 
but the most limited data as to its range as regards temperature and 
l)ressuie. Iron is conceded to contract in the act of fusion, but cold 
iron is more dense than the substance either just above or just below 
the fusion point. It is not beyond the range of probability that exces- 
sive pressures might bring about the same density in iron that cooling 
does, and thus isothermally convert ice fusion into the normal type and 
produce a solid nucleus. However that maybe, tidal effective rigidity 
excludes fusion of either type for at least 0-2 of radius.

Other methods have been used for obtaining ;i measure of the earth's 
age, or for some deiiiiite portion of geological time. 

EARTH AGE FROM TIDAL RETARDATION. 

Kelviu's comparison of the earth's present figure with that of 
a thousand millions of years ago, when the terrestrial day would have 
been only half its present length, is one of the most interesting. The 
earth, if then plastic, would have yielded to four times the present cen- 
trifugal force at the equator and shown a correspondingly greater flat 
tening at the poles and bulging at the eiiuator, and "therefore," as Tait 
expresses it, *' as its rate of rotation is undoubtedly becoming slower 
and slower it cannot have been many millions of years back when it 
became solid, else it would have solidified very much flatter than we 
find it." This implies that because a computed earlier and greater 
value of ellipticity does not now exist it could never have existed, in 
other words, that terrestrial rigidity has been and is of such value that 
a form taken in the remote past by the solid earth would not be mod- 
ified by the tidal retardation of rotation and its attendant change of 
centrifugal force. 

There is in modern geology a growing body of evidence which is 
believed to prove the very general plasticity of the lithosphere, by which 
it may experience important deformations from very sloicli/ applied 
stresses. So strongly has this belief taken root that many American 
geologists accept "isostasy" and consider it to be an expression of a 
fluid equilibrium for the earth. 

From abundant geological observation plasticity must be admitted 
for slow deformations enormously in excess of the small change of fig- 
ure which the stress of tidal attraction would produce but for elastic 
resistance. 

Although rigidity prevents a sudden tidal deformation of 5 feet, it 
does not prevent a slow radial deformation of 5 miles of the surface 
matter. How, then, can it be supposed to resist the slow change of 
stress due to tidal retardation of rotation! The excess of the etpia- 
torial over the polar axis is now roughly 25 miles, while the radial range 
of surface inequalities of the lithosphere is about 12 miles, of which a 
large part dates from this side of the beginning of Tertiary time. If 
past plasticity Cfpials present values, the earth's figure could never 
have been a survival from some assumed earlier epoch when centrifu- 
gal force was greater, but must always have been a function of the 
slowly diminishing rate of rotation. 

If the conclusions of the earlier portion of this paper are true they 
go further and exclude the idea of a formerly fluid earth and any epoch 
of solidification. With any admissible assumption of initial excess 
nearly the whole earth must have been solid from the date of the first 
collocation of its matter. 

To whatever radial depth plasticity may descend, what is enough for 



350 THE AGE OF THE BAUTH. 

geologically recent sni)erficial inequalities is siifticient tor a^Uiisting the 
tiguve of the earth to existing forces of rotation. 

The same coast lines which remain stationary under tidal stress are 
slowly rising and falling in a hundred places under the slow applica- 
tion of subterranean energy. 

It therefore appears that no time measure can be deduced from the 
sui)posed tixing of the present ellipticity at some past date. 

ASTKONOMICAL MEASURE OF EARTH TIME. 

Oroll's hyi)othesis from which it was proposed to fix dates by secular 
variations of eccentricity and to correlate the climatic eiiects of those 
variations with geological operations, and thus measure certain inter- 
vals of geological time, retiuired so much (juestionable physical geogra- 
phy and left so many physical doubts that few have been found to accept 
the excessively complex chain of effects lying between eccentricity data 
and geological facts. The objections of Prof. Newcomb, noticed rather 
tlian answered, left Croll's doctrine where it was permissible to believe 
that there was something in it, but not necessarily that definite sequence 
of climates Avhich is the core of the idea. 

The gap in Croll's scheme seems to have been successfully stopped 
by Sir llobert Ball, whose interesting proof of the seasonal inequality 
of the thernuil element in climate due to position of the equinoxes and 
its intensification in periods of high eccentricity offers a new hope for 
the accurate dating ol at least very modern geological climates. From 
this point of view late geological history requires re-examination, and 
if it should appear that a sequence of climates has existed closely par- 
allelling the thermal variations which the astronomical values seem to 
afford, an extremely probable case will have been made out. And t his 
case would be practically substantiated if the hypothesis of H. Blytt 
should yield the confirmation for which he hopes. Blytt * proposes 
and has already attempted to correlate the secular attractional changes 
due to varying eccentricity and precession with the observed succes- 
sive shifting of beach lines. 

So far as he has proceeded it is of interest to note that his time esti- 
mates are more in harmony with the physical than the stratigraphical 
figures. 

Periodic changes in the figure of the hydrosphere relatively to the 
solid earth, due to alterations of attraction, might be predicted with 
some confidence if it were clear that the lithosphere would under the 
slow stresses involved continue to exercise a degree of rigid resistance 
conq^arable with that it opposes to the tidal stress, but there is no proof 
that it would. 

Since we find the solid earth undergoing slow deformations to-day

which are relatively perinaueut, while its efteotive elastic resistance to 
tidal stress is sufticieut to iierniit a water tide, it ai)i>ears tliat either 
the purely telluric stresses are greater thau the moon's attraction, or 
that there is for the time rate of application of equal stress a transi- 
tional value above which the elastic resistance of the earth-solid is 
enough to conserve figure, aiul below which plastic defornuitioniseasy — 
a relation of properties such as Kelvin suggests for the a'ther. Under 
the former alternative, deformations due to purely telluric forces might 
by upheaval or subsidence at any time mask or counteract astronomical 
beach shifting. In the latter case, to make use of the astronomical data 
for displacement of beaches, it is required to ascertain the time rate of 
terrestrial plasticity accurately enough to know that relatively to the 
duration of eccentricity and i)recessioii cycles and their correlative 
attractional variations, the reaction of the lithosphere would differ 
enough from that of the hydrosphere to allow of the beach shifting 
sought. 

Beyond the most modern geological dates the grander earth deforma- 
tions have carried ancient beach lines out of all recognizable radial 
relations with each other and the several oceans of which they mark 
the shores, or else, as is frecjuently the case with rising continents, they 
have been wholly effaced by erosion. Evidently the Croll Blytt time 
measure, interesting as it niayi)rove to be for recent dates, isat j)resent 
inapplicable to any general determination of the earth's age. 

EARTH-AGE MEASURED BY SUN-AGE. 

Since the incrustment of the earth would be almost immediately fol- 
lowed by a climate controlled wholly by the sun's heat, re-distribution 
of the crust by water necessitates a sun heat received upon the earth's 
surface sufficient at least to maintain the temperature above that of 
permanent freezing. 

Newcomb* remarks: 

" If we reflect that a diminution of the solar heat by less than one- 
fourth its amount would i)r(»bably mean an earth so cold that all the 
water on its surface would freeze, while an increase of nuich more than 
one-half would probably boil all the water away, it nuist be admitted 
that the balance of cause which would result in tlie sun radiating heat 
just fast enough to preserve the earth in its present state has probably 
not existed more than 10,000,000 years." 

All we know of the earlier strata indicates a water mechanism for the 
denudation, comminution, and dei)osition of rock. Exactly the division 
of this work between tidal and river forces we may never know, but 
all evidences confirm the conviction that life was continuous from its 
earliest, or at least an early, appearance, and hence clinmte must have 
been continuously suitable for the circulation of continental waters. 
The range of temperature for the time since the beginning of the Huro- 
nian must have been well within Newcomb's limits. So that unless the

352 THE AGE OF THE EARTH. 

selective absorption of either the sun's atmosphere or the eartli's, or 
both, have varied reciprocally or concurrently with radiation, solar 
einissiou can not have had a wide range of either secular or i»aroxys- 
mal change. 

Xevertheless, the age assigned to the sun by Helniholtz and Kelvin 
(15x10^ or 20x10*^ years) communicated a shock from which geologists 
have never recovered. The thermo-dynamic reasoning on which the 
brevity of the sun's life is reached stands undisturbed, yet so powerful 
is the influence of the old uniformation method of estimating the age of 
the total stratified crust, that to many geologists it has seemed easier 
to reject the physical conclusions than to seek a source of error in our 
own very vulnerable methods. 

If, as 1 hold, Kelvin's suggestions as to ellipticity and tidal retarda- 
tion do not apply to an earth readily deformable by slow stress, as this 
one evidently is, there remain but three earth-ages to be weighed — 
Kelvin's value from terrestrial refrigeration, which this i)ai)er seeks to 
advance to a new precision ; Helmholtz and Kelvin's age of the sun, 
which nuist sharply limit the date of the re-distributed earth crust ; and 
the old stratigraphical method. From this point of view the conclu- 
sions of the earlier part of this paper become of interest. The earth's 
age, about twenty four millions of years, accords with the fifteen or 
twenty millions found for tlie sun. 

In so far as future investigation shall prove a secular augumentation 
of the sun's emission from early to present time in conformity with 
Lane's law, his age may be lengthened, and further study of terrestrial 
conductivity will probably extend that of the earth. 

Yet the concordance of results between the ages of sun and earth, 
certainly strengthens the physical case and throws the burden of proof 
upon those who hold to the vaguely vast age derived from sedimentary 
geology.

Wlien we cast a retrospective glance at the history of knowledge 
concerning' onr phinet, Me find that nearly all the great advances in 
geography took place among commercial — and in a very special manner 
among maritime — peoples. Whenever primitive races connnenced to 
look upon the ocean, not as a terrible barrier separating lands, but 
rather as a means of comnumication between distant countries, they 
soon acquired increased wealth and power, and beheld the dawn of 
new ideas and great discoveries, Down even to our own day the 
power and progress of nations may, in a sense, be measured by the 
extent to which their seamen have been able to brave the many perils, 
and their learned men have been able to unravel the many riddles, of 
the great ocean. The history of civilization runs parallel with the 
history of navigation in all its wider aspects. 

Horace and many other poets have sung the i)raises of the sailor 
who '' iirst put forth on cruel ocean, in the frail rude bark. " Rutin 
navigation, as m all other branches of human activity, there has been 
a slow, gradual, and laborious development from the construction and 
management of the simple rait by the river side up to the ironclad and 
Atlantic greyhound of our own day. Many active and original minds, 
many stout and brave hearts, have contributed to these linal results. 
The tempest-tossed sea is now no obstacle and no terror for the 
instructed mariner with a well-found ship. Tlie " severance of the 
sea'' has disappeared along with the ideas associated with the expres- 
sion. Not only so, but the most i^rofound depths of the wide myste- 
rious ocean have in our own time been forced to yield up their hidden 
treasures to the persistent efforts of the modern investigator.

354 THE RENEWAL OF ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION. 

1)6 destinod to succeed or supplant us on the ocean ? That is a ([ues- 
tion which this geiiei'ation must answer. 

The civilized nations at the birth of navij;ation were most probably 
in the same pliase of development as the Pacific Islanders of the pres- 
ent day. Yet it is a most remarkable fact that at the very dawn of 
history we find a commercial people who were able to conduct voyages 
which rival those of the fifteenth century. Long l)ef()re the oldest 
Hebrew and Greek records, the Pheniciaus had settled all over the 
Mediterranean; they were in the ^Egean fourteen — and at Gades on the 
Atlantic eleven — centuries before the Christian era; they made long 
voyages in the Erythra'an Sea or Indian Ocean, as well as on the 
Atlantic beyond the Pillars of Hercules. Herodotus tells us that, 
about six hundred years before Christ, Phenician sailors reported that, 
in rounding Africa, to the south, they had the sun on their right hand. 
"This, for p.iy i)art, " says Ileordotus, '-I do not believe; but others 
may." This observation as to the position of the sun is however 
good evidence that the expedition of Neclio really took place. At all 
events this is the first hint to be found in literature of a visit to the 
Southern Hemisphere, auvl we do not meet with any more definite and 
satisfactory information till the time of the Kenaissance. 

For all practical purposes, the views of the later Greek philosoi)hers, 
with reference to the figure and position of the earth, did not differ 
from those of the modern geographer, exce])t in the dift'erence between 
the geocentric and heliocentric stand[)(>ints. Eratosthenes estimated 
the circumference of the earth at U5,000 niiles, a very renuirkable 
approximation to the truth, and we find him speculating, eighteen 
centuries before Columbus a id Magellan, on the possibility of circum- 
navigating the globe. The ancients divided the surface of the earth 
into five zones. The torrid zone was uninhabitable from heat; the two 
frigid zones toward the poles were uninhabitable from cold, and in the 
Southern Hemisphere there was a temperate zone similar to that of the 
Northern Hemisphere in which the known world w as situated. Aris- 
totle does not say that the soutliern temperate zone is inhabited, but 
Strabo admits that there may be other worlds inhabited by a difierent 
race of men. Poinponius Mela, who lived in the first century of our 
era, speaks as an undoubted fact of the existence of the autochthones 
inhabiting continental land in the Southern Hemisphere, although this 
land was inaccessible owing to the heat of the intervening torrid zone. 
Mela, held (like most of his predecessors) that the habitable world of 
Europe, Asia, and Africa formed a single island surrounded by the all 
encircling sea. Marinus of Tyre, who lived in the second century, 
rejected this view, and returned to the less correct notion of IIipi)ar- 
chus, who had maintained that the known continents were united to 
other similar masses of laud still unknown, and that the Atlantic and 
Indian Oceans were separated from each other, thus forming great 
iuclosed seas, such as the Mediterranean. Ptolemy adopted the views

of Maiiuus, and cousequeutly in his maps uintcil the eastern coast of 
Africa by nnkuowu lands or KSoutheru Ethiopia to the Chinese coast.* 

The science and learning of antiqnity were swept away by the destruc- 
tive incursions of the barbarians, and there is retrogression rather than 
progress to record during the dark and middle ages. 

The Portuguese voyages along the west coast of Africa, initiated by 
Prince Henry, the navigator, must be regarded as among the tirst fruits 
of the lienaissance, and the i)relu(le to the great maritime discoveries 
of the 15th and IGtli centuries. The views of ^lela prevailed in Portu- 
gal, whereas those of Ptolemy were elsewhere supreme. By the time 
of Prince Henry's death in 1400, the Portuguese had reconnoitered the 
coast of Africa for 1,700 miles, and Bartholomew Diaz reached and 
doubled the Cape of Good Hope in 148G. This most successful voyage 
produced an immense sensation. A deathblow was given to Ptolemy's 
view that the Indian Ocean was an inclosed sea; the liery zone of the 
ancients had been crossed; the southern temperate zoiKi of Aristotle, 
Strabo, and Mela had been reached, and it was inhabited. The air was 
filled with the noise of discovery. A few years later Columbus made 
his ever famous voyage iicross the Atlantic; Vespucci announced the 
discovery of a new world in the Southern IlGmii>Y)]\eiG, a fourth part 
unknown to the ancients. The Portuguese sailed to India, the Spice 
Islands, and even China by way of the cape. From a \)enk in Darien, 
Balboa beheld a boundless ocean beyond the new-found lauds in the 
west, and in 1520 Magellan passed into and crossed this great ocean, 
which he called tiie Pacific, thus completing the first circumnavigation 
of the world. These great voyages doubled at a single bound all that 
was previously known of the earth's surface. The si)hericity of the 
earth, the existence of antipodes, were no longer scientific theories, but 
demonstrated facts. The loss or gain of a day in sailing round the 
world, together with a multitude of other unfamiliar and bewildering 
facts, struck the imagination, and altogether the effect of these startling 
events was without parallel in the history of the world. The solid 
immovable earth beneath men's feet was replaced by the mental picture 
of the great floating globe swung in space, supported by some unseen 
power. This grand conception can be traced in the literature of the 
succeeding century. Bacon and Milton had the image of the huge 
spiuniug globe continually before them, and Shakespeare's spirit seemed 

"^ "To reside 

In thrilling region of tliick-ribbed ice ; 
To be iniprison'd iu the viewless winds 
And blown with restless violence round about 
The pendent world." 

Although many voyages were soon undertaken to the Arctic, centu- 
ries passed away before maritime exploration was directed toward the

Antarctic regious. The unknown lands of Ptolemy and other geogra- 
phers, though now cut oflt' from the nortliern continents, still retained 
their place on charts down to the second voyage of James Cook, under 
the names of Sonthern Ethioi)ia, the Austral Continent, Magellanica, 
Regio Brasilio, and Eegio Fatal is. On a globe dated 1534, which I 
lately examined at Weimar, mountains, lakes, and rivers arc shown on 
a largeextentof land in the Pacific, stretching toward the Sontli I'ole. 
In 1G4:2 Tasman showed that Australia and Van Diennufs Laiiel were 
surrounded by the ocean to the south, but the west coast of New Zea- 
land, which he visited, was believed to be a part of the great S(»uthern 
continent, ami this was hehl by some geograi)hers of the eighteenth 
century to extend as far east as the island of Juan Fernandez, to be 
greater in extent than the whole civilized part of Asia, and to contain 
oO,00(),()0() inhabitants. Here is a part of the dedication of a collec- 
tion of voyages, published in 1770 by a former hydrographer of the 
Navy: 

"Not to him — who infatuated with female blandishments, forgot for 
irh<it he went abroad and hastened back to amuse the European world 
with stories of oichantmvni in the New-Cytheria; but to — the man — 
who emulous of Magallianes, and the heroes of former times, undeterred 
by difticulties, and unsedm^d by pleasure, shall pcrshd through crvry 
obstacle, and not by chance, but by virtue and good conduct succeed in 
esiahlislting an intercourse with a southern continent, this historical 
collection of former discoveries in the kSonth Pacific Ocean is presenied 
by Alexander Dalryniple.*' 

About this time a French navigator reported the discovery of laud 
to the southeast of the Cape of Good Hope, and a French expedition 
under j\L de Kerguelen was sent out in 177li to exi)lore it. Kerguelen 
sighted land with high mountains in latitude 49° south and longitude 
69° east, sent a boat on shore, and rather precipitately concluded that 
he had discovered the great southern continent. On his return to 
France he was hailed as a second Columbus, but on being sent out a 
second time to(;oniplete his discovery, the supposed southern continent 
turned out to be the almost barren island which now bears Kerguelen's 
name. 

During his first expedition James Cook showed that New Zealand 
was an island, and that there was no S(nithern continent in the Pacific 
north of the parallel of 40° south. Cook's second ex])edition in 1772 
was undertaken with the express purpose of settling once for all this 
question of a southern continent, and he crossed the whole southern 
ocean in such a manner as to leave no room for doubt that, if such a 
continent did exist, it must be situated within the Antarctic Circle, and 
must be covered with perpetual snow and ice. 

Cook reached latitude 71° 10' south, in longitude 106° 54' west, and 
here he probably saw the ice-barrier and mountains beyond. He 
believed there was a tract of land toward the South Pole extending

tai tlier north in the Atlantit; aud Indian oceans than elsewhere, and 
says : "^ 

"It is true liowever that the greatest part of tliis southern continent 
(supposing there is one) must lie within the Polar Circle, where the sea 
is so pestered with ice that the land is thereby inaccessible. The 
risque one runs in exploring a coast in these unknown and icy seas is 
so very great that I can be bold enough to say that no man will ever 
venture farther than I have (b»ne, and that the lands which may lie to 
the south will never be explored. Thick fogs, snowstorms, intense cold, 
and every other thing that can render navigation dangerous, must be 
encountered, and these difiliculties are greatly heightened by the inex- 
l)ressibly horrid aspect of the country, a country doomed by nature 
never once to feel the warmth of the sun's rays, but to lie buried in 
everlasting snow and ice. The ports which umy be on the coast are, in 
a manner, wholly filled up with frozen snow of vast thickness; but if 
any should be so far open as to invite a ship into it, she would run a 
risque of being fixed there tV)r ever, or of coming out in an ice island. 
The islands and fioats on the coast, the great falls from the ice-cliffs in 
the port, or a heavy snowstorm attended with a sharp frost, would be 
equally fiital.'' 

Two navigators have however ventured farther th.an Cook. Wed- 
dell in 1823 penetrated to 74"^ south, but saw^ no land. Sir James Clark 
Iloss iu 1841 and 1812 reached the seventy-eighth parallel, and discov- 
ered Victoria Land. These three explorers, Cook, Weddell, and Koss, 
are the only ones who have passed beyond the seventieth parallel of 
south latitude. 

A great many ex])editions have sailed between the sixtieth and sev- 
entieth parallels, and nearly all of them have discovered land in these 
southern latitudes. In 1819 Smitli discovered the South Shetlands to 
the south of Cape Horn, and soon afterward a brisk seal fishery among 
English aiul American sealers sprang up in these waters, the seal skins 
bringing a high price in China. Bellingshausen discovered the islands 
of Alexander and Peter the Great; D'Urville discovered Adelie Laud; 
the [Juited States exploring expedition discovered Wilkes' Land; 
Powell discovered the South Orkneys; Biscoe discovered Euderby's 
Land; Balleny discovered the Balleny Islands aud Sabine Land, and 
Dallman more recently discovered Kaiser Wilhelm Islands and Bis- 
nnirck Strait to the north of Graham's Land. 

The greatest, the most successful and most important expedition to 
the Antarctic was, however, that of Sir James Clark Ross, just referred 
to, between the years of 1839 and 1843. He has furnished more trust- 
worthy information than all the ])receding and succeeding expeditions 
put together. The chief object of the expedition was to make magnetic 
observations, and these were carried out with marked success. Ross, 
wiio had previously planted the flag of his country on the north mag- 
netic pole, even sailed within 1(50 miles of the south nnignetic i)ole. 
During the expedition Ross threw a fiood of new light on the physical 
and biological conditions of the Antarctic. He discussed his meteoro- 
logical observations, and })ointed out the permanently low^ atmospheric

pressure of tlie Soutliein Heinispbere; he took surface and deep-sea 
temi)eratures with much regularity; he became a pioueer iu accurate 
deep-sea sounding and deep-sea dredging; he recoguized that the ani 
mals from deep water were ahnost identical with tliose found at similar 
depths by his uncle in the Arctic, and he prophesied that a nearly 
uniform low temperature would ultimately be found everywhere in 
dee]) water, and that living animals would be found at the greater 
depths all over the floor of the ocean. In the account of his voyage 
we find the best expression of all the anxieties, the dangers, the sufiter- 
ings, the charms and fascination, which accompany work in these bit- 
ter, appalling, and magnificent realms of ice, where snow storms, fogs, 
and gales alternate with brilliant sunshine. 

In January, 1841, after passing heavy pack ice far to the south of 
New Zealand, Eoss discovered Victoria Land, consisting of mountain 
ranges from 7,000 to 12,000 and 15,000 feet in height. To the east he 
found open navigable water with off-lying islands, on two of which — 
Possession and Franklin islands — he landed. This bold coast was 
traced for 500 miles to the south, where it terminated, in latitude 78° 
south, in the volcanic cones of Mounts Erebus and Terror, ]Mount Ere- 
bus at the time vomiting forth tiame and lava from an elevation of 
12,000 feet. Glaciers descending from the mountain summits filled the 
valleys and bays of the coast, and i)rojected several miles into the sea. 
It was impossible to enter any of the indentations or breaks on the 
coast, where, in other lands, harbors usually occur. On some days the 
sun shone forth with great brilliancy from a perfectly serene and clear 
sky of a most intense indigo blue, and the members of the exiiedition 
gazed with feelings of indescribable delight upon a scene of grandeur 
and magnificence beyond anything they had before seen or could have 
conceived. 

From the eastern foot of Mount Terror, Ross found a perpendicular 
wall of ice from 150 to 200 feet in height, extending away to the east, 
through which, as he says, there was no more chance of sailing than 
through the clifts of Dover. He traced this ice barrier in an east and 
west direction for 300 miles; and within a mile of it he- obtained a 
dei)th of 200 fathoms, with a fine soft mud at the bottom. In the fol- 
lowing season Ross was not so successful; for weeks he was a prisoner 
in the pack ice. Still, he reached the ice barrier again iu latitude 78° 
10' south, a little to the east of his i)osition in the previous year, but 
no new land was discovered. In the third season Ross made explora- 
tions among the islands to the south of Cape Horn, landing on Cock- 
burn Island, but his attempts to follow in the track of Weddell were 
unsuccessful, owing to the heavy pack ice encountered throughout the 
season. 

It must be remembered that Ross was the only Antarctic explorer 
provided with ships properly strengthened and fortified, and this 
probably accounts for his remarkable performances in tlie i)ack ice. 



THE RENEWAL OF ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION. 359 

The ofteiier I read the account of this iiinj;iiiticent expedition, the more 
do I wish that another such commander, and another sucli expedition, 
might be sent out from this country, provided with steam power and 
all the appliances for investigation which the experience of the ])ast 
fifty years would be able to suggest. With the same amount of good 
luck, priceless additions would certainly be made to human knowledge. 

The Chullcnficr was the first, and up to the present time the only 
steam vessel which has crossed the Antarctic Circle. She was wholly 
unprotected for ice work. Her contributions towards the solution of 
Antarctic problems belong for tlie most part to the deeper regions of 
the Antarctic Ocean. During last year, some interesting observations 
have been furnished by the Scotch and Norwegian whalers, who visited 
the seas and islands immediately to the south of Cape Horn. 

After this brief review of Antarctic exploration we may ask: What 
is the nature of the snow and ice-covered land observed at so many 
points towards the South Pole? Is there a sixth continent within the 
Antarctic Circle, or is the land nucleus, on which the massive ice cap 
rests, merely a grou]) of lofty volcanic hills? This is a question still 
asked and answered ditferently by naturalists and physical geographers. 
To my mind there seems to be abundant evidence that there exists in 
this region a vast extent of true continental land, the area of which is 
greater than that of Australia, or nearly 4,000 OOO square miles. Of all 
the bold southern explorers Ross and D'Urville are the only two who 
have set foot on land within the Antarctic Circle. I can tind no record 
of any ship having come to anchor within the Antarctic area, or indeed 
south of the latitude of GOo south, although Ross met with shallow 
enough soundings off Possession Island, and Wilkes found 11) fathoms 
in Piner's Bay, Adelie Land. 

Ross reports the rocks of Possession, Franklin, and Cockburn Islands, 
on which he landed, to be of volcanic origin, and in his dredgings to 
the east of Victoria Land in depths from 200 to 400 fathoms, he like- 
wise procured many volcanic rocks along with some fragments of a 
gray granite.* All explorers report the islands to the south of Cape 
Horn to be composed of volcanic rocks, but the recent soundings in 
this vicinity by Mr. Bruce indicate the ])resence of metamorphic and 
even sedimentary rocks, and Dr. Donald has brought home some inter- 
esting tertiary fossils collected last year on Seymour Island by a Nor- 
wegian whaler.t We have thus very good reasons for assuming that 

*McCormick compares the monutains of Victoria Land to those of Auverfino in 
Frauce. His sketches are very different from those of Davis, in showing much more 
geological strnctnre and much less snow and ice. See II. McCormick, " Voyages of 
Discovery in Arctic and Antarctic Seas;" London, 1884, vol, i. 

1 Messrs. G. Sharman and Vj. T. Newton, F. R. s., pahcontologists to the Geological 
Snrvey, state that the nine fossils from Seymour Island are of much interest from a 
geological, point of view. They are weathered and somewhat denuded, indicating, 
probably, a long exposure npon a seashore. They bolongto the following well-known 
forms: Five to CucuUwa, one to Cjitlicrea, one to Xafien, and two are pieces of conif-

ill the Antarctic, facing the great Pacitic Ocean, there is a cliaiii of 
active and extinct volcanic cones, rising in Mounts Erebus and Mel- 
bourne to 12,000 and 15,000 feet, similar to, or rather a continuation of, 
that vast chain of volcanoes which more or less completely surrounds 
the whole Pacitic, facing, so to speaii, the circle of continental land 
lof>king out on that great ocean basin. 

When we remember that tlicir ships were wholly uii]notected for ice, 
the voyages of D'Urville and Wilkes to the Antarctic Circle south of 
Australia must be regarded as plucky in the extreme. At Adelie Land 
D'Urville passed through the vast tabular i(;ebergs and reached open 
water within a few miles of the land, which at that point rose to a height 
of 2,000 and 3,000 feet. Here the members of the expedition landed on 
a small island about 000 yards from the maiidand. The rocks are 
described as granite and gneiss, and from the description of their hard- 
ness there can belittle d(>ul»t that the fundamental gneiss so character- 
istic of continental land was here exi)osed. Wilkes was unable to reach 
land, but in the same locality he found very sliallow water, and landed 
on an iceberg covered with clay, nnid, gravel, stones, and large boulders 
of red sandstone and basalt, 5 or G feet in diameter. 

There is another way in which a great deal may be learned concerning 
the nature of Antarctic land. During the Challe)ujer expedition, trans- 
ported fragments of continental rocks were never found toward the 
central iiortions of the great ocean basins m tropical and sub-tropical 
regions. The only rocks dredged from these areas were fragments of 
pumice or angular rock fragments of volcanic origin. In the Cen- 
tral Pacific, however, as the fortieth parallel of south latitude was 
approached — thereforejust beyond the limit to which Antarctic icebergs 
have been observed to drift — a few rounded fragments of granite and 
quartz were dredged from the bottom of the sea; similar fragments 
were obtained in the South Atlantic in high latitndes, and as the Clial- 
lenger proceeded toward the Antarctic Circle in the South Indian Ocean 
these fragments of continental rocks increased in number till, at the 
most southerly i>oints reached, they, along with the mineral particles 
and muddy matter derived from continental land, nmde n\) by far the 
larger part of the deposit. These fragments consisted of granites, 
quartziferous diorites, schistoid diorites, amphibolites, mica schists, 
grained quartzites, sandstone, a few fragments of compact limestone, 
and partially decomposed earthly shales. These lithological types are 
distinctly indicative of continental land, and remembering what has 
just been said as to their distribution, it seems Avholly unnecessary to 
refute the suggestion that these fragments may have been transported 
from the northern continents. 

erous wood. All these genera have a wide distribution in time, and consequently 
tell little as to the ago of the fossils; but some of the shells present so close a reseui- 
blanoe tospecies known to occur in Lower Tertiury beds in Britain, and to others of 
about the same age, reconlcd by I);n\vin and Haker, from Patagonia, r,s to make it 
highly probnblc that tlu'sc Antarctic fossils are likewise of Lower Tertiary age. 



THE RENEWAL OF ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION. 361 

Glimcoriite is auotlier niiueral which w;is procured in the blue iniids 
near Antarctic laud. This mineral tills the shells of foraminifera and 
other calcareoiis organisms, and has been found in the muds along 
nearly all continental shores where the debris of continental rocks makes 
up the greater }>art of the deposit. Glauconite is now in process of 
formation in all these positions, but it is apparently wholly absent from 
the pelagic deposits of the great ocean basins far from continental land, 
as well as from the deposits around volcanic islands. Its i)reseiice in 
the blue muds of the far south is therefore most suggestive of an Antarc- 
tic continent. 

When we come to estimate the extent of this sixth continental area, 
greater difficulties are presented. A knowledge of the depths of the 
surrounding ocean would enable the outlines to be drawn with great 
exactitude, but unfortunately the positions where accurate soundings 
have been taken are few and lar between. In the South Pacific, South 
Atlantic, and South Indian oceans, between the latitudes of 30° and 
50° south, we have most excellent lines of soundings right round the 
world and in these latitudes the average dejith of the ocean is over 
2,300 fathoms, or about 2i miles.* Between the latitudes of 50° and 
Gjo south, the indications we possess appear to show a gradual shoal- 
ing, with an average depth of about 1,700 fathoms, or nearly 2 miles. 
1 have been criticised for showing on bathymetrical charts a great depth 
in the Southern Ocean to the southwest of south Georgia. This has been 
done because of a sounding by Iloss, who paid out 4,000 fathoms of line 
at this spot without linding bottom. Eoss knew perfectly well how to 
take deep-sea soundings, and his observation seems to show that the 
ocean is" here deeper than 4,000 fathoms, and this may well be accepted 
till dis})roved by more trustworthy results; besides the temperature of 
the deep water to the east of South America points t<> a. great depth in 
this region. The depths obtained by the ChaUenger in tln^ luMghbor- 
hood of the Antarcti(; Circle were l,(»7o, 1,800, and 1,300 fathoms, and 
judging from the nature of the deposits 1 think all these were within 
100 or 200 miles from land. Wilkes obtained depths of oOO and 800 
fathoms about 20 or 30 miles from the shore of Adelie Land, and Ross 
obtained many soundings of from 100 to 500 fathoms all over a great bank 
extending 200 miles to the east of Victoria Land; similar depths have 
been found to extend to some distance to the east of Joinville Land to 
the south of Cape Horn. We have no trustworthy indications of ridges, 
barriers, or banks extending far northwards from Antarctica. It is, 
therefore, most probable that the northern continents are everywhere 
cut off from the Antarctic land mass by a depth approaching to, if not 
exceeding, 2 miles. Taking all these indications into consideration I 
have shown on the map what 1 believe to be the probable i)osition and 
extent of Antarctica. Like other continents it would appear to have 
mountain ranges with volcanoes facing one ocean, and lower hills and

great lowhuul i)laiiis stretching' toward the otiier ocean basins. In 
order to acccumt for the distribution of terrestrial organisms in the 
Southern Hemisphere, some naturalists believe that there must have 
been in recent geological times a great extension of Atitarctica towards 
tlie tro])ics. However this nniy be, ail will agree that a very necessary 
preliminary to any profitable discussion of so difficult a subject must 
be a fuller knowledge of the present conditions that ])revail through- 
out the Southern Hemisphere, such as a new expedition alone can be 
expected to supply. 

All observeivs agree in representing the great Antarctic land mnss to 
be buried beneath a heavy capping of perpetual ice and snow. The 
nucleus of rock is only revealed in off-lying islands, or on the face of 
high and bold escarpments. The outlines and larger features of the 
mountain ranges are not obliterated in the highland near the coasts at 
all events, for peak after peak with varied contours are seen to rise, one 
behind the otiier, towards the interior. 

The snow and ice which descend from the steep seaward face of the 
Admiralty and Prince Albert ranges of ^'ictoria Land, while filling up 
the valleys and bays, do not present an inaccessible face of ice at all 
parts of the coast, although this is often stated to be the case. Koss 
himself says: "Had it been possible to have found a i)lace of security 
(for the ships) ui)on any part of this coast, where we might have 
wintered in sight of the brilliant burning mountain, and so short a 
distance from the magnetic pole, both of these interesting spots might 
easily have been reached by travelling parties in the following spring." 
McCormick, a member of Ross's expedition, recommends Macmurdo 
Bay, at the toot of Mount Erebus, as a place where winter quarters 
might be fonnd.and hints that there would be no difficulty in ascending 
ami tiavelling over the land. 

The ice and snow however which form on the slopes of the mountain 
ranges tiicingthe interior of Victoria Land descend to the lower reaches 
of the continent, wiiere they accumulate in vast undulating fields and 
plains, humbeds of feet in thickness, and ultimately this great glacier 
or ice cap is pushed out over all the lowlands into the ocean, forming 
there the true ice barrier, a solid })erpendi('ular wall of ice, probably 
from 1,'J()(> to 1,500 feet in thickness, rising from l^A) to 200 feet above, 
and sinking 1,100 to 1,400 feet below the level of the sea. When the 
forefronts of this great cieeping glacier are pushed into depths of about 
300 or 400 fathoms, large stretches are broken off and fioataway as the 
oft-described, i)erpendicular-faced, horizontally-stratified, table-topped 
icebergs of the Antarctic and Southern oceans, which may be miles in 
length/ and usnally fioat from 150 to UOO feet in height above the sea 
surface.*

THE RENEWAL OF ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION. 363 

No sooDer do these great ice islands — these majestic and sublime sen- 
tinel outposts — of Antarctica sail forth on their new career, than they 
collide the one with the other; the fragments of imiiact are scattered 
over the surface of the ocean, and, with similar fragments derived from 
the steeper land slopes, with salt-water ice, and accumulations of snow, 
they form what is known as the paclx. This pack, when heavy and 
closely set, has been erroneously called by Wilkes and other writers 
the ice barrier — a name which should only be used to designate the 
solid continuous ice wall that is pushed into the sea from the central 
regions of the continent, such as that along which Ross sailed for 300 
miles. 

Waves dash against the vertical faces of the floating ice-islands as 
against a rocky shore, so that at the sea level they are first cut into 
ledges and gullies, and then into caves and caverns of the most heavenly 
blue,* from out of which comes the resounding roar of the ocean, and 
into which the snow-white and other petrels may be seen to wing their 
way through guards of soldier-like penguins stationed at the entrances. 
As these ice islands are slowly drifted by wind and current to the north, 
they tilt, turn, and sometimes capsize, and then submerged prongs and 
s]nts are thrown high into the air, producing irregular pinnacled bergs 
higher, possibly, than the original table-shaped mass. As decay pro- 
ceeds, the imprisoned bowlders, stones, and earth are deposited over 
the ocean's floor as far as sub-tropical regions. 

Tlie late ]Mr. Croll used to speak of an accumulation of ice and snow 
at the South Pole 10 and even 20 miles in thickness; but from all we 
know of the properties of ice, and the relation of its melting or freez- 
ing point to temperature and pressure, it is highly improbable that such 
a thickness of ice will be found on any part of the Antarctic continent. 
If the snow cap rests on rock of a temperature half a degree below the 
freezing point, then the greatest thickness of ice formed on the conti- 
nent would not likely exceed 1,000 or 1,800 feet, and this appears to be 
just a little more than the greatest thickness of the great ice barrier

* The deep bine color is tine to the fact that all the air has been expelled from the 
deeper parts of the ice cap bj^ the coustaut melting andregelation which tal<es place 
thronghont the whole mass as it moves over the land. When a cannon ball was 
fired into this azure-blue ice the ball did not penetrate, but large masses of ice fell 
away, the fractures having a conchoidal appearance like glass. When a ball was 
fired into the upper areolar Avhite layers of a table berg it penetrated without pro- 
ducing any visible effect. Fragments of the white areolar layers were subjected to 
pressure and impact on board ship, and it was observed that these fragments could

ditions.* A party of well-equipped ol)server.s — who siionkl spend a 
winter on the Antaretic continent— would doubtless bring back valua- 
ble int'ormation for the discussion of this interesting problem, such as 
serial temperatures from borings in the ice cap, both \ ertically and hori 
zontally, the temperature of the eartlfs surface beneath the ne, whether 
or not water runs away from under the glaciers, as well as observations 
concerning the appearance of the ni)per surface ot the ice tields and 
the motion of tne ice over the land. 

Our knowledge of the meteorology of the Antarctic regions is limited 
to a few observations during tlie summer months in very restricted 
localities, and is therefore most imperfect. One of the most remarka- 
ble features in the meteoroU)gy of the globe is the low atmospheric 
pressure, maintained in all seasons, in the Southern Hemisphere south 
of latitude 40'^ south, with its inevitable attendant of strong westerly 
winds, large ram and snow-fall, all round the globe in these latitudes. 
The observations hitherto made point to the existence over certain parts 
of these latitudes of a mean pressure of 29'00 inches and under, — as 
for example to tlie southeast of the Falkland Islands and to the south 
east of New Zealand. 

On the other hand, in the Arctic regions there is in the winter months 
no such system of low jnessure in similar latitudes, but instead there 
are two systems of low pressure, having a mean of 2!»'50 inches, which 
are absolutely restricted to the northern portions of the Atlantic and 
Pacific oceans. Over tlie rest of the Arctic regions proper tlu^ mean 
atmosi)heric pressure exceeds 30-0(> inches, being, roughly speaking, 
about the same as the mean pressure of London. In accordance with 
this distribution of pressure, observations show that nortiierly winds 
immensely preponderate over Arctic and sub- Arctic regions. The 
large number of meteorological observations made during tiie ])resent 
century in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere idace these 
tacts in the clearest light, and they are admirably lepresented by Dr. 
Buclian in his new isobaric charts winch accompany the ClKdioif/cr 
repoit. 

In the Nortiiern Hemisphere the land almost completely surrounds the 

" See Murray op. 'it., p. .535: 1886. The motion of glaciers is oltcn compared to 
tliat of rivers and of viscous bodies; but these couiparisous are not strictly correct, 
and may sometimes be misleadiiijf. T!ie jiecuiiarity of ice motion and its erosive 
po^Yer appear to bo largely due to the fact tliat its melting or frerziug i)oiut varies 
with temi)erature and pressure. The pre.<sure being uuequally distributed through- 
out the glacier, minute crystals of ice are melted -where the pressure is greatest; the 
resulting water occujjying less S])acc, regelation at once takes place, and where the 
ice is wholly compact and crystalline jiressurc is exerted in all directions, motion 
taking place in the path of least resistance. The immense thickness of ice some- 
times invoked does not seem necessary to account for the erosive effects produced by 
ghiciers. The stratified apjiearance of the southern icebergs is evidently due to the 
constant melting and regelation which go on throughout the ice cap; in the deeper 
parts of the bergs tbe.se layers are not tliicker than wafers, and where the ice is 
Avholly crystalline the layers disappear altogether. 



THE RENEWAL OF ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION. 365 

Arctic Ocean; in the Southern Hemisphere the open ocean completely 
surrounds the Antarctic continent, and this open ocean carries with it 
the low barometric pressure all r<mnd. ^ow, if the low pressure still 
inrther deepened with increase of latitude towards the South Pole, it is 
certain that the iirevailing winds over all these high latitudes would be 
northwesterly and northerly. Jkit the observations made by Eoss, the 
Challenger, and more recently, in latitudes higher than GO'^ south, by the 
Dundee whalers and others, (juite unanimously tell us that in these 
liigh southern latitudes the i)redominating winds are southerly and 
sDutheasterly. Thus, during the winter of 189L'-'i).3, in latitudes higher 
tlian (iO"^ south,half of the wliole winds recorded by the D'mna were south, 
southeast, and east, being directions opposite to tlu' winds which would 
certainly prevail if pressure diminisluHl steadily to tlie South Pole. 
Sucli surface currents as have been observed in the Antarctic Ocean 
come also from south aud southeast. 

All the teaching of meteorology therefore indicates that a large 
anticyclone with a higher pressure than prevails over the open ocean to 
northwards overspreads the Antarctic continent. While this anti-cy- 
clonic region may not bo characterized by an absolutely high pressure 
at all sea.sons, it must be high relatively to the very low pressure which 
])revails to the northward. The southerly outtiowing winds which 
accompany this anti-cyclone will be dry winds and attended by a small 
precipitation, it is probable that about 74° south the belt of excessive 
preci]»itati()n has been passed, and it is eveu conceivable that at the 
pole precipitation might be very little in excess of, or indeed not more 
tliau equal to, the evaporation. Even one year's observations at two 
points on the xVutarctic continent might settle this point, and enal)le us 
to form a tolerably comi)lete idea of the annual snow-fall and evapora- 
tion over the whole continent. An approximate estimate might then 
be given of the a.iuual discharge from the solid glacier rivers into the 
surrounding ocean. Indeed it is impossible to overestimate the value 
of Antarctic observations for the right understanding of the general 
meteorology of the globe. 

Not less interesting than the meteorology of the land area is that of 
the ocean in southern latitudes. In the neighborhood of the Antarctic 
Circle the temperature of the air and sea surface is, even in summer, at 
or below the freezing iioiut of fresh water. A sensible rise takes place 
ab!)ut the sixtieth parallel, and a temperature of 38"^ F. has been recorded 
in that latitude in March for both the air and sea surface. The general 
result of all the sea temperatures observed by Cook, Wilkes, Eoss, aud 
tiie ChaUenger in the Antarctic Ocean shows that a layer of cold water 
underlies in summer a thin warm surface stratum aud overlies another 
warm but deeper stratum towards the bottom. The cold stratum extends 
like a wedge northwards for about 12°. At depths between 50 and 300 
fathoms at the southern thick end of the wedge the temperature is 28^ 
F.I and at the northern thin end of the wedge it inci eases to about 32'0'5 



366 THE RENEWAL OF ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION. 

at 80 fatlionis. The surface layer ranges from 29° in tlie south to .'^8° in 
the nortli, and the deeper bottom layers range from 32° to 35°. 

Mr. lUichanan found that the density of tlie cohl hiyer, and indeed 
of all the deeper waters, was higher than that of the surface, and his 
admirable researches on the effects produced by freezing sea water, 
appear to give a satisfactory explanation of the effect of these phenomena 
on the distribution of temperature in this ocean. Jt has been found 
that sea water oti freezing is divided into two saliniferous parts, one 
solid, which is richer in sulphates, and one licpiid, which contains pro- 
portionally more chlorides than the parent sea ^ivater.* The liipiid 
brine thus i)r()duced is denser, and sinks into the underlying water, thus 
rendering the deeper water more saline and at the same time lowering 
its temperature. In a basin isolated from general oceanic circulation, 
like the Xorwegian basin of the Arctic regicuis, there is produced in this 
way an uniform teiniierature of about 29° ¥. in all the dcejier waters, 
but no tiace of this state of matters is found ni the Antarctic. On the 
contrary, at the areater dej^ths a temperature is found somewhere 
between 32° and 34° F. as far south as the Antarctic circle, and not 
therefore \ery different from the temperature of the deepest bottom 
Avater of the tropical regions of the ocean. 

The i)resence of this relatively warm water in the deeper parts of the 
Antarctic Ocean may be explained by a considtiration of general oceanic 
circulation. The warm tropical waters which are driven southwards 
along the eastern coasts of South America, Africa, and Australia, into 
the great all-encircling Southern Ocean, there become cooled as they 
are driven to the east by the strong westerly winds. These waters on 
account of their Iiigh salinity, can suffer nnu-li dilution with Antarctic 
Avater, and still be denser than water from these higher latitudes at the 
same temperature. Here again, the density obsei'vations indicate that 
the cold water found at the greater depths of the ocean probably leaves 
the surface and sinks toward the bottom in the Southern Ocean between 
the latitudes of 4.")° and 5G° south. These deeper, but not necessarily 
bottom, layers are then drawn slowly northward toward the tropics to 
supply the deficiencies there produced ])y evaporation and southward- 
flowing surface currents, and these deeper layers of relatively warm 
water appear ]ikeA\ise to be slowly drawn southwards to the Antarctic 
area to supply the place of the ice-cold currents of surface water drifted 
to the north. This warm underlying water is evidently a potent factor 
in the melting and destruction of the huge table-topped icebergs of the 
southern hemisphere. While these views as to circulation appear to 
be well established, still a fuller examiuatiou of these waters is most 

* Petterssea has shown that sea ice exj)an(ls irregnlarly witli heat, and that the 
latent heat is abnormal, being less than that of pnre ice. He also found that the 
chemical composition of the brines formed in Arctic seas by the freezing of ice out 
of a limited quantity of water is different from that of sea water itself. There is, 
however, uo certainty that this behavior of the ice and free sea water is due to the 
formation of the hypothetical cryohydrates of Guthrie.

desirable at different seasons of tlie year, with iniprove<l tlierniometers 
and other instiunients. Here, again, a new Antarctic ''\ ^edition Mould 
supply the knowledge essential to a correct solution of many problems 
in Oceanography. Ross describes a strong tidal curient and rip between 
Possession Island and tlie mainland of Victoria, but on the whole, we 
have very little inforuuition concerning the tides and surface currents 
in the Antarctic. 

No laud animal, and uo trace of vegetation, not even a lichen or a 
piece of seaweed, has been found on land within the Antarctic circle. 
On Cockburn Island, in latitude 04^ south, Hooker collected twenty 
cryptogamic species, three of them seaweeds, and this may be regarded 
as not far from the southern limit of terrestrial vegetation. The fossils 
and fossiliferous beds above referred to distinctly indicate the existence 
of more genial conditions within the Antarctic m past geological times, 
and should be fully explored. 

When we turn to the waters of the Antarctic Ocean, we find at the 
present time a great profusion of life, both animal and vegetable. Dur- 
ing the ChaUcufjcr expedition, myriads of minute spherical tetrasporiie 
were observed to give the sea a peculi.ir green color over large areas. 
Diatoms were frequently in such enormous abundance, that the tow nets 
were filled to the brim with a yellow-brown slimy mass, with a distress- 
ing odor, through which various crustaceans, annelids, and other animals 
wriggled. 

As these marine algte are the primary source of food in the sea, their 
great develoi)ment in the Antarctic Ocean leads to a corresponding 
abundance of animals. Occasionally vast quantities of Co])ei)ods 
Amphipods, and Schizopods were observed to give the ocean a dull 
red color, and the more delicate tow nets were at such times so filled 
with these animals, that they occasionally burst on being hauled on 
board ship. These small crustaceans are in turn the chief food of the 
fishes, penguins, seals, and whales, Avhich abound in the waters of the 
Great Southern Ocean. 

Organisms such as the diatoms and radiolaria, which secrete silica, 
and the foramiuifera and pteropods, which secrete carbonate of lime, 
are, on account of their distribution, the most interesting of all the 
pelagic creatures captured in the surface and sub-surface waters of the 
ocean. Near Antarctic land the deposits at the bottom of the sea are, 
as already stated, mostly made up of rock fragments and detritus from 
the snow-clad Antarctic continent. A little to the north the number 
of these particles decreases, and they are largely rei)laced by the dead 
frustrules of diatoms and radiolaria, and then we find a pure white 
siliceous deposit at the bottom, which is called a diatom ooze. Still 
farther to the north, when the infiueuce of the warm northern currents 
commences to be felt, the diatoms are largely replaced on the surface 
by the calcareous shells of foramiuifera and pteropods, and at the 
bottom of the sea in these latitudes the diatom ooze gives place to a 



368 THE RENEWAL OF ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION. 

pinkisb-white globigernia ooze, composed chiefly of carbonate of lime. 
Still fartber to the north, about the latitude of 40^ south, the sea is 
often about 3 miles in depth, and in such depths where far removed 
from continental land, the calcareous shells are for the most part dis- 
solved, and there is a very remarkable deposit at the bottom, composed 
of a tine red rlay, manganese nodules, zeolitic crystals, magnetic and 
metallic spherules of extra-terrestrial origin, thousands of sharks' teeth, 
and the remains of wliaies and other cetaceans. In these red clay areas 
the trawl brought up m a single haul over 1,500 shiuks' teeth, some of 
them as large as — and n()t to be distinguished from — the specinu'iis of 
Carvltarodoii of Tertiary age; associated with these teeth were 50 or GO 
earbones of ziphiod whales and other cetaceans.* From a careful con- 
sideration of all the conditions, it seems to me that deposition is, in 
these places, at the minimum, and that since Tertiary times there may 
not have been over a few inches of deposit laid down in these red clay 
areas. A new expedition might thoroughly exi)lore one of these peculiar 
and instruetive deposits. 

All over the floor of the Antarctic Ocean there is a most abundant 
fauna, a[)])arently more abundant and more peculiar than in any other 
region of the ocean's bed. In one haul made by the Challotner in a 
depth of 2 miles in latitude 47- south, the trawl brought up (exclud- 
ing ])rotozoa) over 200 specimens belonging to 89 species of animals, 
of which T.j were new to science, including representatives of 28 new 
genera. This and similar trawlings show a larger number of indi 
viduals, genera, and species than any single haul from similar depths 
in other regions of tlie oceans, and I am inclined to think this is inti- 
mately connected with the large number of surface creatures which 
are killed in these latitudes by the mixing of waters from the tropics 
and waters from the Antarctic; for these organisms, on falling to the 
l)ottom, afford a larger supply of food to deep-sea animals here than in 
other localities. 

The following table exhibits the total result of the Cli((Ucn<je)'\s 
trawlings and dredgings soutli of the forty-third parallel, in depths 
greater than 1,200 fathoms; 830 animals were captured (excluding the 
protozoa) belonging to 398 species, of which 320, or nearly all those 
described, were new to science. Of these 102 new species and 30 new 
genera, were not obtained in any other region of the bed of the ocean. 
Among these were 8 new genera and 50 new species of echinoderms, 
many of them exhibiting marked i)eculiarities.t Many other forms, 
such as some species of serolis among the Crustacea, are limited to the 
deep water of the Southern Hemisi)here. The absence of some groups, 
such as the brachyura, in all these dredgings is likewise suggestive.

■ One hundred and sixty -two new species and 30 new genera were not obtained outside this Ant- 
arctic are.a during the cruise. 

It is most probable, indeed ahiiost certain, that the floor of the ocean, 
as well as all pelagic waters, have been peopled from the shallow waters 
surrounding continental land; and herein the deep waters of the Ant- 
arctic we appear to have Aery clear indications of the existence of the 
descendants of animals that once inhabited the shallow water along- 
the shores of Antarctica, while in other regions of the ocean the descend- 
ants oftlie shallow water organisms of the nortlieru continents prevail. 
This is a subject of great interest to all biologists, and can best be 
studied by a more efficient exploration of these southern latitudes. 

This rapid review of the present state of our knowledge concerning 
the Antarctic should, if in any way successful, have at the same time 
furnished di.stinct indications as to the great extent of our ignorance 
concerning all that obtains within the South Polar regions. It should 
likewise have enabled you to appreciate the great advantages which 
would flow from successful exploration in the immediate future. 

Within the past few months I have been in communication with 
geographers and scientific men in many x^iirts of the world, and among' 
them there is complete unanimity as to the desirability, nay, necessity, 
for South Polar exploration, and wonder is expressed that an expedition 
has not long since been fitted out to undertake investigations which, it 
is admitted on all sides, would be of the greatest value in the progress 
of so many branches of natural knowledge. Prof. Neumayer, who has 
so long advocated South Polar exploration, says: "It is certain that 
without an examination and ii survey of the magnetic properties of the 
Antarctic regions, it is utterly hopeless to strive, with prospects of. suc- 
cess, at the advancement of the theory of the earth's magnetism." 
Other eminent geographers and scientific men urge the advantages 
which would accrue to other branches of science.* 

* Prof. Alesautler Agadsiz -writes : ''I wisli you tliL- Ucst success with your jiro- 
posed Antarctic expedition. What you piojiose doing is tlic liglit thing to do, and 
the results ought to be most interesting, judging from the little we know of the few

370 THE RENEWAL OF ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION. 

To deteriniue the nature and extent of the Antarctic coutinent; to 
penetrate into the interior; to ascertain the depth and nature of the 
ice-cap 5 to observe the character of the underlying rocks and their 
fossils; to take magnetical and meteorological observations both at sea 

islands which have heeu hastily visited. Your scheme of havinj^ the ships kept at 
work, souiuliDg, dredging, etc., while the laud parties are exploring the land, is the 
most practical and econouiical way of carrying on such an expedition. It has always 
seemed to me such a waste of time and mouej to have the ships and their crews wait 
on thelandsmeu." 

Prof. Ernest Haeckel writes;' " I have heard with great interest that England 
has the design of setting on foot a great scientific expedition for the exploration of 
the Antarctic Ocean. The task is iu fact as interesting as it is pressing and impor- 
tant. It is remarkable how much money and how many lives have been offered by 
Europe and North America for North Polar expeditions, while the much less known 
South Pole has seemed almost forgotten since Ross's time. And how many great 
and important problems await solution there ! The British nation seems to me called 
upon before all others to carry out this great task, and to send a ship for several 
years (including wintering at a station) to the South Polar Sea. The fruits of such 
an expedition would certainly form a worthy sequel to those which yon have attained 
through the incomparable C'/m/^cHr/er expedition with its wealth of results. It would 
lay the foundation for all time. I hope and wish from my heart that the Engli.sh 
Government views it iu this light, and will grant the large su})plies necessary for 
this expedition. I send you my best Avishes for the speedy comiiletion of the con- 
cluding volume of the great ChalJcnger work. This 'standard work' will remain 
for all time the foundation for all biological and thalassographical investigations, 
in relation to Plankton and Benthos alike, especially of the deep sea. The thorough 
investigation of the Antarctic Ocean with its fauna and flora seems to me a necessary 
suii])lement to the Clialleiiger work.'' 

Prof. F. E. Schultze writes:* " You wish for my opinion on the sul)ject of a more 
extensive exploration of the Antarctic region. I believe I shall be in agreement, 
not only with all representatives of physical geography, Ijut especially witli all the 
biologists in the world, when Isay that there is no region of the surface of our globe 
which is so little known, but so much deserves a thorough investigation as precisely 
thia of the Antarctic. Allow me also to call your attention to the fact that, of all the 
oceans, the soutliern and central part of the Indian C^ceau has hitherto been, least 
exj^lored, and that therefore it mightbe advisable, if o])pnrtnnity offered — say, during 
a winter — to make an excursion to the central part of the Indian Ocean. In the hope 
that to the great C/m??eH(/er expedition maybe added one similar and equally rich in 
results for the exploration of the Antarctic, I wish success to this important under- 
taking from my heart." 

Prof. .J. Thoulet writes: * "There is only one Avay in which to answer the letter 
you have been so good as to write to me, namely to send you my warmest encour- 
a"ement to continue the great and noble task of discovering the secrets of the Ant- 
arctic regions. May you succeed in accomplishing this glorious work, which is not 
ouly scientific but also humanitarian. - - - All who are occupied on science iu 
the whole world earnestly wish for your success. To tell you the truth, I have never 
been very enamoured of Arctic exjteditious; the North Pole is continental, and is iu 
consequence the domain of irregularity, and in my opinion its con<iuest isuot worth 
the efforts which it has already cost. But it is quite otherwise with the Antarctio 
regions, which are oceanic, and therefore subject to rule. The Arctic phenomena 
are complications or exceptions; the Antarctic are general phenomena, and their 
discovery la bound to conduce to the formulation of natural laws — the final aim of 
science.''

and on land; to observe the temperature of the ocean at all depths and 
seasons of the year; to take pendulum observations on land, and possi- 
bly also to make gravity observations at great depths in the ocean; to 
bore through the deposits on the Hoor of the ocean at certain points to 
ascertain the condition of the deeper layers;* to sound, trawl, and 
dredge, and study the character and distribution of marine organisms. 
All this should be the work of a modern Antarctic expedition. Fo ■ 
the more definite determination of the distril)ution of land and wat*^r 
on our planet; for the solution of many problems concerning the ice 
age; for the better determination of the internal constitution and 
sui»erticial form of the earth; for a moie comjtlete kmnvledge of the 
laws which govern the motions of the atmosphere and hydrosphere; for 
more trustworthy indications as to the origin of terrestrial and marine 
l>lants and animals, all these observations are earnestly denumded by 
the science of our day. 

How then, and by whom, is this great work to be undertaken'? I 
can never forget my sensations when once in the Arctic 1 was for several 
hours lost in a small boat m a fog, and at one time there seemed little 
chance that I would ever regain the ship. iSTor again can I forget one 
night inthe Antarctic when, with much anxiety, Capt. Nares,his ofBcers, 
and men, pilote<l the CJudlciu/cr during a gale through blinding snow, 
ice, icebergs, darkness, and an angry sea. The remembrance of these 
experiences makes one almost fear to encourage good and brave men 
to penetrate these forbidden regions. But it is not all gloom and 
depression beyond the Polar circles. Sunshine and lively hope soon 
return. 

A few months ago I bade good bye to Nansen and said, I expected 
within two years to welcome him on his return from the Arctic; but I 
expressed some doubt if 1 should again see the Frum. "I think you 
are wrong," was the reply ; " I believe you will welcome me on this very 
deck, and, after my return from the Arctic, I will go to the South Pole, 
and then my life's work will be liuished." This is a sjiirit we must all 
admire. We feel it deserves, and is most likely to command, success. 
All honor to those who venture into the far north or tar south with 
slender resources and bring back with them a burden of new observa- 
tions. 

A dash at the South Pole is not however what 1 now advocate, nor 
do I believe that is what British science, at the present time, desires. 
It demands rather a steady, continuous, laborious, and systematic 
exploration of the whole southern region with all the ai)pliances of the 
modern investigator. 

This exploration should be undertaken by the Koyal Navy. Two 
shi[)S, not exceeding 1,000 tons, should, it seems to me, be fitted out

for a whokMioimnissioii, so as to extend over three summers and two 
winters. Early in the first season a wintering party of about ten men 
sliould be hmded somewhere to the south of Cape Horn, probably about 
Bismarek Strait at Graham's Laud, The expedition should then i>ro- 
ceed to Victoria Land, wheie a second similar ])arty should winter, 
probably in Macmurdo Bay, near Mount Erebus. The shii)S should 
not become frozen in, nor attempt to winter in the far south, but 
should returu toward the north, conducting- observations of various 
kinds along the outer margins of the ice. After the needful rest and 
outtit at the Falklands or Australia, the i^ositiou of the ice and the 
temperature of the oceau should be observed in the early spring, and 
later the wintering parties should be communicated with, and, if neces- 
sary, reinforced with meu and supplies for another winter. During the 
second winter the deep-sea observations should be continued north- 
ward, aiul in the third season the wintering parties should be picked 
up and the expedition return to England. The wintering parties 
might largely be com|30sed of civilians, and one or two civilians might 
be attached to each ship; this plan worked admirably during the 
CluiUenycr expedition. 

What, it nuiy be asked, would be the advantages to trade and com- 
merce of such an expedition ? It nuist be confessed that no definite or 
very encouraging answer can be given. We know of no extensive 
fisheries m these regions. For a long time seal and sea-elephant fish- 
eries have been carried on about the islands of the Southern Ocean, 
but we have no indication of large heixls or rookeries within the Ant- 
arctic (circle. A whale fishery was at one time carried on in the neigh- 
borhood of Kerguelen,but this right whale, if distinct from or identical 
with Bulana ai(str((lis, appears to have become nearly, if not cpiite, 
extinct. Some expressions of Ross would lead one to suppose that a 
whale corresponding to the Greenland right whale inhabits the seas 
within the Antarctic ice, but we have no definite knowledge of the 
existence of such a species. Although " sulphur bottoms" [Bahvnop- 
tera musculus), "finbacks" {Bakvrioptera sibbaldii), and "humpba(;ks" 
{Megaptera boojys) are undoubtedly abundant, they do not repay cap- 
ture. IJoss and Mc( 'ormick report the sperm whale within the Antarctic 
ice, but there is some doubt on this point. Though penguins exist in 
countless numbers they are at pre.sent of no commercial value. Deposits 
of guano are not likely to be of any great extent. But it is impossible 
to speak with confidence on the commercial asi)ects of such an expedi- 
tion — the unexpected may ({uite well happen in the way of discovery. 

With great confidence, liowever, it may be stated that the results of 
a well-organized expedition would be of capital imi)ortance to British 
science. We are often told how much more foreign governments do for 
science than our own. It is asserted that we are being outstripi^ed by 
foreigners in the cultivation of almost all departments of scientific 
-^ork. But in the pr3,ctical study of all that concerns the ocean this is 



THE RENEWAL OF ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION. 373 

certainly not the case, for however closely we may now be pressed by 
some foreiii'n nations, we have had up to the present time to acknowl- 
edge neither superiors, nor even eijuals in this branch of investigation, 
and, if we be a wise and progressive people, British science will always 
lead the way in this direction. When Queen Victoria ascended the 
throne we Avere in profound ignorance as to the condition of all the 
deeper parts of the great ocean basins; now we have a very accurate 
knowledge of the conditions which obtain over the three-fourths of the 
earth's surface covered by the waters of the ocean. This — the most 
splendid addition to earth-knowledge since the circumnavigation of the 
world — is largely due to the work and exertions of the Royal Navy in 
the Challenger and other deep-sea expeditions, and the mercantile navy 
in our telegraph ships. 

This country has frequently sent forth expeditions, the primary 
object of which was the ac(iuisition of new knowledge, — such were the 
expeditions of Cook, Ross, and the Challenyer; and the nation as a 
whole has always approved such action and has been proud of the 
results, although they yielded no immediate return. Shall it be said 
that there is to be no successor to these great expeditions? The pres- 
tige of the navy does not alone consist in its i)owers of defense and 
attack. It has m times of peace made glorious conquests over the 
powers of nature, and we ask that the officers and men of the present 
generation be aftbrded the same opportunities as their predecessors 
There should be no observations, no experiments, no investigations, 
no work of any kind, no knowledge of any kind, Avith reference to the 
ocean, of which the navy has not had practical experience. And what 
better training for ofticer and man than in an expedition such as that 
now advocated"? 

A iireliminary responsibility rests on the geographers and represent- 
atives of science in this country. It is necessary to show that we have 
clear ideas as to what is wanted, to show that a good, workable scheme 
can be drawn up. When this has been done it should be presented to 
the Government with the unanimous voice of all our scientitic corpora- 
tions. Then, I have little doubt that a minister will be found sufficiently 
alive to the spirit of the times, and Avith sufiticient courage to add a few 
thousand pounds to the navy vote for three successive years, in order to 
carry through an undertaking worthy of the maritime position and the 
scientific reputation of this great Empire. 



THE NORTH POLAli BASIN.* 



By Henry Seebohm, F. L. S., F. Z, S. 



Geograpliy, the child of Mathematics and Astroiinniy, stands in the 
rehition of mother to lialf a dozen other sciences, wliich have long ago 
left the parental roof to establish sections of their own. Like every 
other science, geography is so closely connected with, and dependent 
on, its allied sciences that it is impossible to treat of the one witliont 
invading the province of the others. No one supposes that the mak- 
ing of maps is the whole duty of the geographer. The accurate delin- 
eation of the trend of coast lines, the courses of rivers, the heights of 
mountains, the depths of seas, or the position of towns is onlj' the skel- 
eton which underlies the real science of geography. 

The study of geography may be divided into various sections, but it 
must always be remembered that they dovetail into each other, as well 
as into the allied sciences, to such an extent that no hard-and fast line 
can be drawn between them. The object of dividing so comprehensive 
a section as that of geography into sub-sections is more practical than 
scientific. The classification of facts is an important aid to mennny, 
and introduces order into what might otherwise seem to be a chaos of 
knowledge. 

The foundation of all geography is exploration; but before the trav- 
eller can do good geographical work he must acquire the necessary 
knowledge embraced in the science of cartograi>hy. This includes a 
practical acquaintance with the various instruments used in making 
a survey, the necessary mathematical and astronomical knowledge 
required for their use, and a familiarity with the accepted mode of 
expressing the geographical facts that nmy be acquired on a chart or 
map. Exploration may then be undertaken with some chance of ulti- 
mate success, but the object of exploration must be something more 
than the filling up of blanks in our maps. Many otiier subjects must 
receive atttmtion, subjects which aie collectively included in tlie term 
I)hysical geography, but which require treatment under different heads.

ment of Science, at Nottingham, by the president of the section ; Sept., 1893. (The

376 THE NORTH POLAR BASIN. 

Of tliese the most obvious is the geographical distribution of light and 
heat, as well as the more fitful alterations of Avind and rain with calm 
and drouth; in other words, the numerous causes which combine to 
produce climate. Meteorology or climatology, the geography of the 
air, is a most importaut branch of geography in general; and when we 
come to inquire into the changes which have taken place in the climate 
of different imrts of the earth's surface, especially those which have 
affected the Polar Basin, we enter upon a subject which has claimed a 
large share of the attention of geologists, who have also made a pro- 
found study of the geographical distribution of the various kinds of 
rock which are found on the crust of the earth. Another sub-section 
of great importance is the geographical distribution of organi(; life. 
The geograi)hical ranges of the species and genera, both of plants and 
animals, have become a subject of vastly increased imjiortance since so 
much attention has been directed to the theory of evolutiou; and the 
paramount imi)ortance of the huuum race is so great that ethnological 
geography may fairly claim to be treated as a sub-section, apart from 
the study of the rest of the fauna of a country, liiasmuch as a.map 
with the towns left out is only half a map, the geographer can not 
afford to neglect the races of men with which he comes in contact, nor 
the remains (architectural or otherwise) which existing nations have 
produced, or past races have left behind them. 

I propose, on the present occasion, to elaborate these subjects at 
greater detail, and, with your permission, to take the Polar Easm as 
an example. 

EXPLORATION OF THE POLAR BASIN. 

There is only one Polar P>asin; the relative distribution of land and 
water and the geographical distribution of light and heat in the Arctic 
region are absolutely unique. In no other part of the world is a similar 
climate to be found. The distribution of land and water round the 
South Pole is almost the converse of that round the North Pole. In 
the one we have a mountain of snow and ice covering — it may be a 
continent, it may be an archipelago, but in any case a lofty mass of 
congealed water surrounded by an ocean stretching away with very 
little interruption from land to the confines of the tropics. In the other 
we have a basin of water surrounding a comparatively flat plain of 
pack ice, some of which is probably permanent, but most of which is 
driven hither and thither in summer by winds and currents and is 
walled in by continental and island barriers broken only by the nar 
row outlets of Bering Strait and Baffius Bay and the broader gulf 
which leads to the Atlantic Ocean, and even that interrupted by Ice- 
land, Spitzbergen, and Franz Josef Land. When we further remem- 
ber that this gulf is consiantly conveying the hot water of the tropics 
to the Arctic Ocean, and that every summer gigantic rivers are i)our- 
ing volumes of comparatively warm water into this ocean, we can not 



THE NORTH POLAR BASIN. 377 

but admit that tlie cliiualic coiiditioiis near the two poles dift'cv widely 
from each otlier. 

In looking' at a map of tlie PoUir Basin one can not help remarking 
the curious fact that the North Pole is so very nearly central, and a 
glance at the Southern Hemisphere also shows a rough sort of symmetry 
in the distribution of land and water round the South J'ole. It is a 
curious coincideuce, if this be only accident. 

The history of the exploration of the Polar Basin is a very long and 
a very tragic story. ]\luch has been done, but much remains to do. 
The unex])lored regions of the Polar Basin may be estimated at 1 ,000 000 
scpuire miles. No part of the world presents greater dit'ticultics to the 
exjjlorer. Many brave men have perished in the enterprise, and more 
have only Just succeeded in passing through the ordeal of hunger and 
cold with their lives. For the most part the heroic endurance of the 
tortures of famine has shown a marvel of discii)liiie, though occasion- 
ally the commanders of the expeditions have had to enforce obedience 
to the verge of cruelty, both in the case of men and of dogs. There 
are indeed a few ghastly stories, but the records of Arctic explora- 
tion are records of which any nation might be proud. 

Of recent years there has been but little done to explore the unknown 
parts of the Polar Basin. Adventurous journeys in Central Africa and 
Central Asia have somewhat eclipse<l the exploration of the Arctic 
regions. Two visits to Greenland can not however be entirely passed 
by in silence. In the summer of last year an expedition went to the 
north of Greenland under the command of Lieut. Peary, succeeded in 
reaching latitude 82°, and added material evidence to prove that 
Greenland is an island. The expedition sailed on June G, 1891, steamed 
up Bafitins Bay and Smiths Sound, and on July 25 dismissed the ship 
and established themselves in m inter (juarters in McCormick Bay, on 
the north side of Murchison Sound, in latitude 78°. They laid in a 
stock of game for thg winter, guillemots and reindeer. A most inter- 
esting proof of the successful organization of the expedition is the fact 
that Mrs. Peary was one of the party, and was able to accompany her 
husband on his sledge trip, which started on the 18th of the following- 
April. 

It took the party a week in their dog sledges to round Inglefield Gulf, 
during" which they discovered 30 glaciers, 10 of them of the first mag- 
nitude. During the next three months they explored the north coast 
of Greenland, as far east as longitude 34° west, when a great bay was 
reached, which they named Independence Bay, as they discovered it on 
July 4, The northern shore of this bay was free from snow and ice. 
On August 6 they regained their winter quarters in McCormick Bay. 
On the 8th the steamer arrived, and on the 24th they started for home, 
reaching Philadelphia on September 23. During the sledge j(mrney 
they traveled for a fortnight at an average elevation of 8,000 feet above 
the sea. Besides tlieir important additions to the map of Greenland, 



378 THE NORTH POLAR BARIN. 

tlie sng'gestive fact that tlie thernionieter can rise to 41° F., and tor- 
rents of rain can fall in the middle of February as far north as latitude 
78°, must be regarded as a valuable discovery. 

It was hardly to be expected that so successful a journey should not 
be followed by a second attempt in order to follow up the discoveries 
of the first. Peary has started for the north of Greenland with a more 
carefully organized staff for a longer expedition, andhas already reached 
his winter quarters. They expect to be absent two years or more. In 
March they hope to start for Independence Bay, wiiich was discovered 
on the i)revious expedition, and there the party will divide, with tlie 
object of comi)leting the survey of the coast-line of (Ireenland by reach- 
ing Cape Bismarck, if possible, and at the same time to exi)loie the 
northern coast-line of Independence Bay, hoping that it may land 
them farther north than the highest point yet reached by any An^tic 
traveler. 

In the summer of 1888 Dr. Nansen was bold enough to cross the con- 
tinent of Greenland about latitude 04°, reaching an altitude of 0,000 
feet, and he told his story to this section in his own simple words on 
his return. The distance across was about 10 degrees, and the highest 
point was about one-third of the Avay across from the east coast. If 
the scientific results were necessarily somewhat meager. Dr. Nansen 
established a reputation for bravery and i)hysical endurance, which he 
hopes to increase by an attempt to reach the iSTorth Pole. The Frant 
has already started from Hammerfest, and was telegrai)hedafew weeks 
ago from Waigatz Island. The intention is to enter the Kara Sea and 
to push northward and eastward, hoping- that the warm currents caused 
by the great Siberian rivers will enal)le them to get well into the ice 
before winter begins. Once frozen into the pack ice, Nansen hopes to 
be carried by the currents somewhere near the North Pole, and, after 
drifting for two or three years, he hopes finally to emerge from his ice 
l)rison somewhere on the east coast of Greenland. Foolhardy as the 
expedition appears, it is nevertheless planned with great skill, and its 
chances of success are supposed to be based upon a sufficiently accurate 
knowledge of the ocean currents of the Polar Basin. 

These currents, so far as they are known, are very interesting. The 
Mackenzie and the great Siberian rivers flow into the Polar Basin, and 
the current through Bering Strait is supposed to do the same; but 
both these sources of sui)ply can only be regarded as of minor imjjort- 
ance. Between Spitzbergen and Finmark, however, the Gulf Stream 
enters the Polar Basin 300 or 400 miles wide. To compensate for these 
inward currents, there are two outward currents, one on each side of 
Greenland, which, coming from the center of cold, do their best to 
intensify the rigois of that mountainous island. 

Nansen hopes that the current which carried the Jcainiefte from Her- 
ald Island, north of Bering Strait, in a northwesterly direction for.liW 
or (100 miles, is the same current that flows down the east coast of 



THE NORTH POLAR BASIN. 379 

Greenland, and lie bases Ids lio])es upon three facts. First, that many 
articles from the wreck of the Jcan)if'tie were lound on an u'e-tloe off 
the south coast of Greeidand three 3'ears afterward; second, that a 
harpoon -thrower of a pattern unknown except in Alaska was picked 
up on the southwest coast of Greenland; and, third, that driftwood 
supposed to be of Siberian origin is stranded n\<;nlarl3' m consider- 
able quantity on the coasts of Greenland. The Norwegian at Hammer- 
fest, about latitude 70^, is dei»endent i'or his firewood upon the Gulf 
Stream, which brings him jin ample supply from the Gulf of Mexico, 
whilst the Eskimo on the Greenland coast, in the same latitude, trusts 
to a current from the opposite direction to bring him his necessary store 
of wood from the Siberian forests. 

\\'e can only hope that Nansen will find tlie currents as favorable to 
his needs, and that so much l)ravery may l)e supi)oited by good luck. 

THE IIIYER SYSTEMS. 

By no means the least important ]tliysi('al feature of the Polar Basin 
is its gigantic river systeiys. 

Thexivers which flowinto the Arctic Ocean are some of them amongst 
the greatest in the world. 

Some idea of the relative sizes of the drainage areas of a few of the 
best known rivers maybe learned from the following table, in which the 
Thames, with a drainage area of 0,000 square miles, is the unit: 

9 Thames =1 Elbe (54,000). 

2 Elbes =1 Pechora ( 108,000). 

21 Pechoras =:; 1 Danube (270,000), 

2 Danubes =1 Mackenzie (540,000) 

2 Mackeuzies =1 Yenisei (1,080,000). 

2 Yeniseis = 1 Amazon (2,160,000). 

Perhaps a more scientific classification of rivers would be to call 
those with a drainage area l)etween 2,.")G0 000 and 1,280 000 square miles 
rivers of the first magnitude, a category which contains the Amazon 
alone. There are ten rivers of the second magnitude, with drainage 
areas between 1,280,000 and 640,000 square miles (Ob, Congo, Missis- 
sippi, La Plata, Yenisei, Nile, Lena, Niger, Amur, Yangtse). There 
are twelve rivers of the third magnitude, with drainage areas between 
640,000 and 320,000 square miles (Mackenzie, Volga, Murray, Zambesi, 
Saskatchewan, Ganges, St. Lawrence, Orange, Orinoco, Hoang Ho, 
Indus, and Bramaputra). There are more than a dozen rivers of the 
fourth magnitude, with drainage areas between 320,000, and 160,000 
square miles, but none of them empties itself into the Arctic Ocean. 
They iii"clude the Danube, Euphrates, and several of the African and 
South American rivers. Of the numerous rivers which are of the fifth 
magnitnde, with drainage areas between 160,000 and 80,000 square 
miles, the Pechora belongs to the Polar Basin. The number of rivers 



380 THE NORTH POLAR BASIN. 

of lesser inagnitnde is legion, and it is only necessary to qnote one of 
each as an example. 

Sixth mnonitiide (80,000 to 40,000), rniiiie. 
Seventh iiiagnitnde (40,000 to 20,000), Rhoue. 
Eighth niaguitndo (20,000 to 10,000), Garonne. 
Ninth magnitude (10,000 to 5,000), Thames. 

There is nothing that makes a greater impression upon the Arctic 
traveller than the enormous width of the rivers. The I'echora is only 
a river of the fifth magnitude, but it is more than 1 mile wide for sev- 
eral hundred miles of its course. The Yenisei is more than 3 miles wide 
for at least 1,000 miles, and 1 mile wide for nearly another thousand. 
Whymper describes tlie Yukon as varying from 1 mile to 4 nnles in 
widtb for 300 or 400 miles of its length. The Mackenzie is described as 
averaging 1 mile in width for more than 1,000 miles, with occasional 
exi>ansions for long distances to twice that size. 

The drainage area does not measure the size of the Arctic rivers at 
all adequately. Though the rainfall of nniny of them is comparatively 
small, the size of the rivers is relatively very large, owing to the sud- 
den melting of the winter's accumulation of snow, which causes an 
annual Hood of great magnitude, like tlie rising of the Nile. Even on 
the Amur in eastern Siberia and on the Yukon in Alaska the annual 
Mood is important enough, but on the rivers which flow north into the 
Polar Sea the dannniug up of the mouths bj^ the accunuilations of ice 
produces an annual deluge, frequently extending over thousands of 
square miles, — acatastrophe the effects of which have been nnich under- 
rated and never adequately described. 

If we assume that the unknown regions are principally sea, then the 
Polar Basin, including the area drained by all rivers Howing into the 
Arctic Sea, may be roughly estimated to contain abyut 14,000,000 
square miles, of which half is land and half water. In the coldest part 
of the basin the land is either glacier or tundra, and in the warmer 
parts it is either forest or steppe. 

GREENLAND GLACIERS. 

Greenland, the home of the glacier and the ^lother of the icebergs of 
the Northern Atlantic, rises 9,000 or 10,000 feet above sea level, whilst 
the sea between that lofty plateau and Scandinavia is the deepest 
known in the Polar Basin, though it is separated from the rest of the 
Atlantic by a broad belt or submarine plateau connecting Greenland 
across Iceland and the Faroes with the British islands and Europe. 
Iceland, Spitzbergen, and Novaya-Zemlia, the latter a continuation of 
the Urals, are all mountainous and full of glaciers. The glaciers of 
southern Alaska are some of the largest in the world. The glaciers 
and the icebergs have a literature of their own, and we must j)ass them 
by to say a word or two about the tundra. 



THE NORTH POLAR BASIN. 381 

THE TUNDRA. 

Tlie Arctic Sen, which lies at tlie bottom of the Polar Basin, is fringed 
with a belt of bare country, sometimes steep and rocky, descending iu 
more or less abrupt cliffs and piles of precipices to the sea, but more often 
slojjing gently down in mud banks and sand hills representing the 
accumulated spoils of countless ages of annual tloods, which tear up 
the banks of the rivers and deposit shoals of detritus at their mouths, 
compelling them to make deltas in tlieir efforts to force a passage to 
the sea. In iSforway this belt of bare country is called tlie fjeld, in 
lUissia it IS known as the tundra, and in America its technical name is 
the barren grounds. In the language of science, it is the country 
beyond the limit of forest growth. 

In exposed situations, especially in the higher latitudes, the tundra 
does really merit its American name of barren ground, being little else 
than gravel beds interspersed with bare patches of peat or clay, and 
with scarcely a rush or a sedge to break the monotony. In Sibeiia, at 
least, this is very exceptional. By far the greater part of the tundra, 
both east and west of the Ural Mountains, is a gently undulating plain, 
full of lakes, rivers, swamps, and bogs. The lakes are diversified with 
l)atches of green water plants, amongst wLiu;h ducks and swans float 
and dive; the little rivers flow between banks of rush and sedge; the 
swamps are masses of tall rushes and sedges of various species, where 
l)lialaropes and ruffs breed, and the bogs are brilliant with the white 
tiuffy seeds of the cotton grass. The groundwork of all this variegated 
scenery is more beautiful and varied still, — lichens and moss of almost 
every conceivable color, from the cream colored reindeer moss to the 
scarlet-cupped trumpet moss, interspersed with a brilliant alpine flora, 
gentians, anemones, saxifrages, and hundreds of plants, each a picture in 
itself, the tall aconites, both the blue and yellow s[)ecies, tlu' beautiful 
cloudberry, witli its gay white blossom and amber fruit, the fragrant 
Ledum palustre, and the delicate pink Andromeda polifolia. In the 
sheltered valleys and deep water courses a few stunted birches, and 
sometimes large patches of willow scrub, survive the long severe win- 
ter, and serve as cover for willow grouse or ptarmigan. The Lapland 
bunting and red-throated pipit are everywhere to be seen, and certain 
favored places are the breeding-grounds of plovers and sandpipers of 
many species. So far from meriting the name of barren ground, the 
tundra is for the most part a veritable paradise in summer. But it has 
(Uie almost fatal drawback — it swarms with millions of inos(]uitoes. 

ARCTIC FORESTS. 

The tundra melts away insensibly into the forest, but isolated trees 
are rare, and in Siberia there is an absence of young wood on the con- 
fines of the tundra. The limit of forest growth appears to be retiring 
southward, if we may judge from the number of dead and dying stumps; 



382 THE NORTH POLAR BASIN. 

but this may be a temporary or local variation caused by exceptionally 
severe winters. The Hunt of forest growth does not coincide with the 
isotheruKS of mean annual temperature, nor with the mean temperature 
for January nearly so closely as it does with the mean temperature for 
July. It may be said to approximate very nearly to the Jnly isotherm 
of 53° F. We may therefore assume that a 6-foot blanket of snow pre- 
vents the winter frosts from killing the trees so long- as they can be 
revivified by a couple of mouths of summer heat above 50° F. 

The limit of forest growth is thus directly determined by geograph- 
ical causes. In Alaska and in the Mackenzie Basin it extends about 
300 miles above the Arctic Circle, but in eastern Canada the depres- 
sion of Hudson Bay acts as a vast ice-house, and the forest line falls 
500 miles below the Arctic Circle, whilst on the east coast of Labrador 
the Arctic current from Baffins Bay sends it down nearly as far again. 
On the other side of the Atlantic the limit of forest growth begins on 
the iNorwegian coast on the Arctic Circle, gradually rises until it 
reaches 200 miles farther north in Lapland, is depressed again by the 
ice-house of the White Sea, but has recovered its position in the valley 
of the Pechora, which is rather more than maintained until a second 
vast ice-house, the Sea of Okotsk, combined with Arctic currents, 
repeats the depression of Labrador in Chuski Land and Kamchatka. 

There are no trees on Novaya-Zemlia. Two or three species of wil- 
low grow there, but they are dwarfs, seldom attaining a height of 3 
inches. Novaya-Zemlia enjoys a comi)aratively mild winter, the mean 
temperature of January, thanks to the influence of the Gulf Stream, 
beiug 15° r. above zero in the south and only 5° F. below zero in the 
north. The absence of trees is due to the cold summers, the mean tem- 
perature of July not reaching higher than 45° F. in the south, whilst 
in the north it only reaches 38° F. 

The Lidians of Canada have discovered that when they want lo tiiid 
water in wanter it is easiest reached under thick snow, the thinnest ice 
on the river or lake being found under the thickest blanket of snow. 
On the same xn-inciple the tree roots defy the severe winters juotected 
by their snow shields; but they must have a certain temperature (above 
50° F.) to hold their own m summer. 

The influence of the snow blanket is very marked in determining the 
depths to which the frost penetrates beneath it. Thus we And that a 
Norwegian writer, alluding to latitude ()L'°, remarks '-that the ground 
is frozen Irom 1 to 2i feet m winter, but this depends upon how soon 
the snow falls. Higher up the mountains the ground is scarcely frozen 
at all, owing to the snow falling sooner, and in fact if the snow falls 
very early lower down it is scarcely frozen to any depth." Similar 
facts have been recorded from Canada in latitude 53°. " On this 
prairie land, when there is a good fall of snow when the winter sets in, 
the frost does not penetrate so deep as when there is no snow till late." 
Another writer a little farther south, in latitude 51°, says: " 1 am safe 



THE NORTH POLAR BASIN. 383 

in .saying that the froist penetrates here to an averaj^e of 5 feet, except 
when we have had a great depth of snow in the beginning of winter, 
iu wlueh case it does not penetrate nearly so far." 

THE .STEri'E REGIONS. 

It is not so easy to exphiin the boundary line between the forest and 
the steppe. There are tw^o great step])e regions in the Pohir Basin, 
one in Asia and the other in America. The great Barabinski Steppe 
in southwest Siberia stretches witli but sliglit interruptions across 
southern Eu^sia into Bulgaria. The great prairie region of JNIinnesota 
and INIanitoba reaches the jMcKenzie Basin, and outlying plains are 
found almost up to the Great Slave Lake. The cause of the treeless 
condition of the steppes or juaiiies has giAcn rise to much controversy. 
My own experience in Siberia convinced me that the forests were rocky 
and the steppes covered with a deep layer of loose earth, and I came 
to the conclusion that on the rocky ground the roots of the trees were 
able to establish themselves firmly so as to defy the strongest gales, 
which tore them np when they Avere planted iu light soil. Other trav- 
ellers have formed other opinions. Some suppose that the })rairies were 
once covered with trees, which have been gradually destroyed by fires. 
Others suggest that the earth on the treeless plains contains too nuich 
salt or too little organic matter to be favorable to the growth of trees. 
No one, so far as I know^, has suggested a climatic explanation of the 
circumstance. Want of drainage ma}^ i)roduce a swamp and the defi- 
ciency of rainfall may cause a desert, both conditions being fatal to 
forest growth, but no one can mistake either of these treeless districts 
for a steppe or prairie. 

ARCTIC ANTHROP()L(KIY. 

The anthropology of the Polar Basin presents many i)oints of inter- 
est. On the American coasts of the Arctic Ocean the Eskimo lives a 
very similar life to the Lap}) in Norway and the Samoyede in the tun- 
dras of Siberia. These races of men resemble each other very much 
in their personal appearance, and still more so in their habits. Their 
straight black hair, with little or no beard, their dark and obliquely 
set eyes, their high cheek bones and flat noses, and their small hands 
and ieet, testify to their Mongoloid origin. They are all indebted to 
the reindeer for some of theii- winter dress and for much of their food, 
and they all have dogs; but the Eskimo travels only with dogs, and 
the Lapp only with reindeer, whilst the Samoyede uses both dog 
sledges and reindeer sledges. They all lead a nomadic life, trapping 
fur-bearuig animals in w'inter and fishing in summer; they resemble 
each other in many other customs and beliefs, but they are neverthe- 
less supposed to have emigrated to the Arctic regions from independ- 
ent sources, and many characters in which they resemble each other 
are supposed to have beeu inde])endently acquired. 



384 THE NORTH POLAK BASIN. 

The various races which inhabit the Polar Basin beh)W the limit of 
forest iii-owtli are too iiiinierous to be considered in detail. 

ARCTIC ZOOL,OCV. 

Most zoologists divide the Polar Basin into two zoological regions, or, 
to be strictly accurate, tliey include the (Jld World half of the Polar 
Basin in what they call the Pahiearctic region, and the New World 
half in the Nearctic region; but recent investigations Lave showu that 
these divisions are unnatural and cau not be maintained. Some 
w^riters unite the two regions together under the name of the Holarctic 
region, whilst others recognize a circuin polar Arctic region above the 
limit of forest growth, and unite in a second region the temperate por- 
tions of the Northern Hemisphere. In the opinion of the last-mentioned 
writers the circum polar Arctic region differs more from the temperate 
regions of the Northern Hemisphere than the American portion of the 
latter does from the Eurasian i)ortiou. 

The fact is that life areas, or zoo-geographical regions, are more or 
less fanciful generalizations. The geographical distribution of animals, 
and probably also that of plants, is almost entirely dependent upon two 
factors, climate and i.solaticm, the one playing quite as important a part 
as the other. The climate varies in respect of rain-fall and tempera- 
ture, and species are isolated from each other by seas and mountain 
ranges. The ge()grai)hical facts which govern the zoological provinces 
consequently range themselves under these four heads. It is at once 
obvious that the influences which determine the geographical distribu- 
tion of tishes must be quite different from those which deterinine the 
distribution of mammals, since the geographical features which isolate 
the s[)ecies in the one case are totally different from those which form 
impassable barriers in the other. It is ecjually obvious that the climate 
conditions which mtiuence the geographical range of mammals must 
include the winter cold as well as the summer heat, whilst those which 
determine the geographical distribution of birds (most of which are 
migratory in the Arctic regions) are entirely independent of any amount 
of cold which may descend ui)on their breeding grounds during the 
months which they spend in their tropic or subtroi)ic winter (piarters. 

Hence ail attempts to divide the Polar Basin into zoological regions 
or provinces are futile. Nearly every grou]) of animals has zoological 
regions of its own, determined by geographical features peculiar to 
itself, and any generalizations from these different regions can be little 
more than a curiosity of science. The mean teiiii)erature or distribu- 
tion of heat can be easily ascertained. It is easy to generalize so as 
to arrive at an average between the summer heat and the winter cold, 
because they can be both expressed in the same terms. When how- 
ever we seek to generalize upon the distribution of animal or vegetable 
life, how is it p(»ssible to arrive at a mean geographical distribution of 



THE NORTH POLAR BASIN. 385 

animals? How many genera of molhisks are equal to a genus of 
mammals, or how many butterflies are equal to a bird? 

If there be any region of the world with any claim to be a life area, 
it is that part of the Polar Basin which lies between the July isotherm 
of 50° or 530 F. and the northern limit of organic life. The former 
corresponds very nearly with the northern limit of forest growth, and 
they comprise between them the barren grounds of America and the 
tundras of Arctic Europe and Siberia. 

The fauna and flora of this circuinpolar belt is practically homo- 
geneous; many species of both plants and animals range throughout 
its whole extent. It constitutes a circumpolar Arctic region, and can 
not consistently be separated at Bering Strait into two parts of suliQ- 
cient importance to rank even as sub-regions. 

Animals recognize facts and are governed by them in the extension 
of their ranges; they care little or nothing about generalizations. The 
mean temperature of a province is a matter of indiflerence to some 
plants and to most animals. The facts which govern their distribution 
are various, and vary according to the needs of the plant or animal 
concerned. To a migratory bird the mean annual temperature is a 
matter of supreme indifference. To a resident bird the question is 
equally beside the mark. The facts which govern the geographical 
distribution of birds are the extremes of temperature, not the means. 
Arctic birds are nearly all migratory. Their distribution during the 
breeding season depends primarily on the temperature of July, which 
must range between 53° and 35° F. It is very important however to 
remember that it is actual temperature that governs them, not iso- 
therms corrected to sea level. If an Arctic bird can find a correct iso- 
therm below the Arctic Circle by ascending to an elevation of 5, 000 or 
G,000 feet above the level of the sea, it avails itself of the opportunity. 
Thus the region of the Dovrefeld above the limit of forest growth is 
the breeding place of many absolutely Arctic birds; but this is not 
nearly so much the case on the Alps, because the cold nights vary too 
much from the hot days to come within the range of the birds' breed- 
ing grounds. Here, again, the mean daily temperature is of no impcn- 
tance. It is the extreme of cold which is the most potent factor in this 
case, and no extreme of heat can counter-balance its eft'ect. 

POLAR ISOTHERMALS. 

In estimating the influence of elevation upon temperature it has been 
ascertained that it is necessary to deduct about 3*^ F. for every thou- 
sand feet. The isothermal lines are very eccentric in the Polar Basin. 
The mean temperature of summer is quite independent of that of 
winter. The isothermal lines of July are regulated by geographical 
causes which do not affect those of December or operate in a contrary 
direction. The Gulf Stream raises the mean temperature of Iceland 
during winter to the highest point which it reaches jii the Polar Basin, 
gjM 93 25 



386 THE NORTH POLAR BASIN. 

viz, 30^ to 35^ F., whilst iu siiinmer it prevents it from rising above 
45° and 50^ F., a range of only 15^. In tlie valley of tlie Lena, in the 
same latitude, the mean temperature of January is 55^^ to 50° F. below 
zero, whilst that of July is 00° to 65° F. above zero, a range 115°. 

The close proximity of the Pacitic Ocean has a much less eftect on 
the mean temperature at Bering Strait, which is in the same latitude 
as the north of Iceland. The mean temperature for January is zero, 
whilst that for July is 40° F. The mean temperature for January in 
the same latitude in the valley of the Mackenzie is 25° below zero, 
whilst that for July is 55° F. In this case the contrast of the ranges 
is 40 and 80, which compared with 15 and 115 is small, but the geo 
graphical conditions are not the same. Bering Sea is so protected by 
the Aleutian chain of islands that very little of the warm current 
from Japan reaches the straits. It is deflected southward, so the 
Aleutian Islands form a better basis for comparison. Their mean tem- 
perature for January is 35° F., whilst that for July is 50° F., precisely 
the same difference as that to be found in Iceland. 

The influence of geographical causes upon climate being at present 
so great, it is easy to imagine that changes in the distribution of land 
and water may have had an equally important influence upon the cli 
mate of the Polar Basin during the recent cold age, which geologists 
call the Pleistocene i)eiiod. It is impossible for the traveler to over, 
look the evidences of this so-called Glacial period in the Polar Basin; 
and whether we seek an explanation of the geographical i)henomena 
from the astronomer or the geologist, or both, it is impossible to ignore 
the geographical interest of the subject. 

ARCTIC GEOLOGY. 

No sciences can be more intimately connected than geography and 
geology. A knowledge of geography is absolutely essental to the geol- 
ogist. To discriminate between one kind of rock and another is a 
comparatively small part of the work of the geologist. To ascertain 
the geographical distribution of the various rocks is a study of ])ro- 
fouud interest. If the geologist owes much to the geographer, the lat- 
ter is also largely indebted to the labors of the former. The geology of 
a mountain range or an extended i^lain is as important to the physical 
geographer as the knowledge of anatomy is to the figure painter. 

The geology of the Polar Basin is not very accurately known, and 
the subject is one too vast to be more than mentioned on an occasion 
like the present; but the evidences of a comparatively recent ice age in 
eastern America and western Europe are too important to be passed by 
without a word. 

In the sub-arctic regions of the world there is much evidence to 
show that the climate has in comparatively recent times been Arctic. 
The present glaciers of Central Eurojie were once much greater than 



THE NORTH POLAR BASIN. 387 

they are now, and even in the British Islands glaciers existed during 
what has been called the ice age, and the evidence of their existence 
in the form of rocks, upon which they have left their scratches, and 
heaps of stones which they have deposited in their retreat, are so obvious 
that he who runs may read. Similar evidence of an ice age is found in 
ISTorth America, and to a limited extent in the Himalayas, but in the 
alluvial i>lains of Siberia and North Alaska, as might be expected, no 
trace of an ice age can be found. 

Croll's hypothesis that an ice age is produced when the eccentricity 
of the earth's orbit is unusually great, has been generally accepted as 
the most plausible explanation of the facts. It is assumed that during 
the months of summer perihelion evaporation is extreme, and that 
during the months of winter aphelion the snow-fall is considerably 
increased. The etfect of the last period of high eccentricity is supposed 
to have been much increased by geographical changes. The elevation 
of the shallow sea which connects Iceland with Greenland on the one 
hand, and the south of Norway and the British Islands on the other, 
would greatly inc-rease the accumulation of snow and ice in those parts 
of the Polar Basin where evidence of a recent ice age is now to be 
found; whilst the depression of the lowlands on either side of the Ural 
Mountains so as to admit the waters of the Mediterranean through the 
Black and Caspian Seas, might prevent any glaciation in those parts 
of the Polar Basin where no evidence of such a condition is now dis- 
coverable. But this is a (juestion that must be left to the geologist to 
decide. 

The extreme views of the early advocates of the theory of an ice age 
have been to a large extent abandoned. No one now believes in the 
former existence of a Polar ice cap, and possibly, when the irresistible 
force of ice-dammed rivers has been fully realized, the estimated area 
of glaciation may be considerably reduced. The so-called great ice age 
may have been a great snow age, with local centers of glaciation on 
the higher grounds. 

The zoological evidence as to the nature, extent, and duration of the 
ice age has never been carefully collected. The attention of zoologists 
has unfortunately been too exclusively devoted to the almost hoi)eless 
task of theorizing upon the causes of evolution, instead of patiently 
cataloguing its effects. 

There is a mass of evidence bearing directly upon the recent changes 
in the climate of the Polar Basin to be found in the study of the 
present geographical distribution of birds. The absence of certain 
common British forest birds (some of them of circumpolar range sub- 
generically, if not specifically) from Ireland and the north of Scotland 
is strong confirmation of the theory that the latter countries were not 
very long ago outside the limit of forest growth. 

The presence of species belonging to Arctic and sub-Arctic general 
on many of the South Paciiic islands is strong evidence that they were 



388 THE NORTH POLAR BASIN. 

compelled to emigrate in search of food by some great catastrophe, such 
as au abnormally heavy snow-fall, and the fact that uo island contains 
more than one species is strong evidence that this great catastrophe 
has only occurred once in recent times. The occurrence of a well rec- 
ognized line of migration from Greenland across Iceland, the Faroes, 
and the British Islands to Europe is strongly suggestive of a recent 
elevation of the laud where the more shallow sea now extends in this 
locality. The extraordinary similarity of the fauna and flora of the 
Arctic regions of the Old and the New Worlds can only be fonnd else- 
where in continuous areas, and had it not been for the unfortuuate 
division of the Arctic region into two halves, PaUiearctic and jSTearctic, 
would have attracted much more attention than it has hitherto 
received. 

ARCTIC CLIMATE. 

The raiu-fall of the Polar Basin is small compared to that with which 
we are familiar, but its visible effects are enormous. In Arctic Europe 
and Siberia it is supj)osed to average about 13 inches per annum; in 
Arctic America not more than 9 inches. The secret of its power is that 
about a third of the rain-fall descends in the form of snow, which melts 
with great suddenness. 

The stealthy approach of winter on the confines of the Polar Basin is 
in strong contrast to the catastrophe which accompanies the sndden 
onrush of summer. One by one the flowers fade, and go to seed if they 
have been fortunate enough to attract by their brilliancy a bee or other 
suitable pollen-bearing visitor. The birds gradually collect into flocks 
and prepare to wing their way to southern climes. Strange to say, it is 
the young birdsof each sj^ecies that set the example. They are not many 
weeks old. They have no personal experience of migration, but nature 
has endowed them with an inherited impulse to leave the land of their 
birth before their parents. Probably they inherit the impulse to migrate 
without inheriting any knowledge of where their winter quarters are to 
be found, and by what route they are to be sought. They are sometimes, 
if not always, accompanied by one or two adults; it may be barren 
birds, or birds whose eggs or young have been destroyed, or who may 
therefore get over their autumn molt earlier than usual, or molt slowly 
as they travel southward. Of most species the adult males are the next 
to leave, to be followed perhaps a week later by the adult females. One 
by one the various migratory species disappear, until only the few resi- 
dent birds are left, and the Arctic forest and tundra resume the silence 
so conspicuous in winter. As the nights get longer the frosts bring 
down the leaves from the birch and the larch trees. Summer gently 
falls asleep, and winter as gently steals a march upon her, with no wind 
and no snow, until the fi^ost silently lays its iron grip upon the river, 
which, after a few impotent struggles, yields to its fate. The first, and 
mayhap the second ice is broken up, and when the starrester of the 



THE NORTH POLAR BASIN. 389 

vilifige sallies forth to peg out with rows of birch trees the wiuter road 
down the river to the next village, for which he is responsible, he has 
frequently to deviate widely from the direct course in his efforts to 
choose the smoothest ice, and find a chaunel between the hummocks 
that continually block the way. 

The date upon which winter resumes his sway varies greatly in differ- 
ent localities, and probably the margin between an early and a late 
season is considerable. In 1876, Capt. Wiggins was frozen up in winter 
quarters on the Yenisei, in latitude 004°, on October 17. In 1878 Capt. 
Palander was frozen up on the coast 120 mUes west of P>ering Strait, in 
latitude G7f°, on September 28. 

The sudden arrival of summer on the Arctic Circle appears to occur 
nearly at the same date in all the great river basins, but the number 
of recorded observations is so small that the slight variation may pos- 
sibly be seasonal and not local. The ice ou the Mackenzie River is 
stated by one authority to have broken up ou May 13, in latitude 02°, 
and by another on May 9 in latitude 07°. If the INIackenzie breaks up 
as fast as the Yenisei — that is to say at the rate of a degree a day, 
an assumption which is supported by what little evidence can be found — 
then the difference between these two seasons would be nine days. My 
own experience has been that the ice of the Pechora breaks up ten days 
before that of the Yenisei, but as I have only witnessed one such event 
in each valley, too nuich importance must not be attached to the dates. 

According to the Challenger tables of isothermal lines, the mean 
temperatures of January and July ou the Arctic Circle in the valleys of 
the Mackenzie and the Yenisei scarcely differ, the summer tempera- 
ture in each case being about 55° F., and that of winter — 25° F., a dif- 
ference of 80° F. 

On the American side of the Polar Basin summer comes almost as sud- 
denly as it does ou the Asiatic side, but tlie change appears to be less 
of the nature of a catastrophe. The geographical causes which produce 
this result are the smaller area of the river basins and the less amount 
of rain-fall. There is only one large river Avhich empties itself into the 
Arctic Ocean on the American side, the Mackenzie, with which maybe 
associated the Saskatchewan, which discharges into Hudson Bay far 
away to the south. The basin of the Mackenzie is estimated at 590,000 
S(iuare miles, wliilst that of the Yenisei is supposed to be exactly twice 
that area. The comparative dimensions of the two summer floods are 
still more diminished by the difference in the quantity of snow. 

The snow in the Mackenzie basin is said to be from 2 to 3 feet deep, 
whilst that in the Yenisei, basin is from 5 to feet deep, so that the 
spring tlood in the latter river must be about five times as large as that 
of the former. 

Another feature in which the basin of the Mackenzie differs from 
those of the rivers in the Arctic regions of the Old World is the number 
of rapids and lakes contained in it. The ice in the large lakes attains 



390 THE NORTH POLAR BASIN. 

a thickness at least twice as great as that of the rapid stream, and con- 
sequently breaks up nuicli later. In the Great Slave Lnke theiceattaius 
a depth of (> to 7 feet, and even in the Athabaska Lake, in latitude 58°, 
It reaches 4 feet. The rapids between these two lakes extend for 15 
miles. The ice on the river breaks up a month before that on the lakes, 
so that the drainage area of the lirst summer flood is much restricted. 

The arrival of summer in tlu^ Arctic regions hap]»ens so late that the 
inexperienced traveller may be excused for sometimes doubting whether 
it really is going to come at all. When continuous night has become 
continuous day Avithout any perceptible approach to spring, an Ali>ine 
traveller naturally asks whether he has not reached the limit of perpet- 
ual snow. It is true that here and there a few bart^ patches are to be 
found on the steepest slopes where most of the snowhas been l)lowu 
away by the wind, especially if thesis slopes face the south, where even 
an Arctic sun has more potency than it has elsewhere. It is also true 
that small flocks of little birds — at tirst snow buntings and mealy red 
poles, and later shore larks and Laitland buntings — may be observed to flit 
from one of these bare places to another looking for seeds or some other 
kind of food, but after all, evidently finding most of it in the droppings 
of the peasants' horses on the hard snow-covered roads. The appearance 
of these little birds does not however give the same confidence in the 
eventual coming of summer to the Arctic naturalist as the arrival of the 
swallow or the cuckoo does to his brethren in the, sub-arctic and sub- 
tropic climates. The four little birds Just mentioned are only gipsy 
migrants that are perpetually flitting to and fro on the confines of the 
frost, continually being driven south by snow-storms, but ever ready to 
take advantage of the slightest thaw to press northward again to their 
favorite Arctic home. They are all circumpolar in their distributions, 
are as common in Siberia as in Lapland, and range across Canada to 
Alaska, as well as to (Treenland. In sub-arcric climates we see them 
only in winter, so that their appearance does not in the least degree 
suggest the arrival of summer to the traveller from the south. 

The gradual rise in the level of the river inspires no more confidence 
in the final uu'lting away of the snow and the disruption of the ice 
which supports it. In Siberia the rivers are so enormous that a rise 
of 5 or feet is scarcely perceptible. The Yenisei is 3 miles wide at 
the Arctic Circle, and as fast as it rises the open water at the maigin 
freezes up again and is soon covered with the drifting snow. During 
the summer which I spent in the valley of the Yenisei we had feet of 
snow on the ground until the 1st of June. To all intents and purposes 
it was midwinter, illuminated fi»r the nonce with what amounted to con- 
tinuous daylight. The light was a little duller at midnight, but uot so 
much so as during the occasional snowstorms that swept through the 
forest and drifted up the broad river bed. During the month of May 
there were a few signs of the possibility of some mitigation of the 
rigors of winter. Now and then there was a litrle rain, but it was 



THE NORTH POLAR BASIN. 391 

always followed by frost. If it thawed one day, it froze the next, and 
little or no impression was made on the snow. The most tangible sign 
of coming summer was an increase in the number of birds, but they 
were nearly all forest birds, which could enjoy the sunshine in the 
pines and birches, and which were by no means dependent on the melt- 
ing away of the snow for their supply of food. Between May 1<> and 
30 we had more definite evidence of our being within bird flight of bare 
grass or open water. Migratory flocks of wild geese passed over our 
winter quarters, but if they were flying north one day they were flying 
south the next, proving beyoiul all doul)t that tlieir migration was 
premature. The geese evidently agreed with us that it ought to be 
summer, but it was as clear to the geese as to us that it really was 
winter. 

We afterward learned that during the last ten days of ^Fay a tre- 
mendous battle had been raging 600 miles, as the crow Hies, to the 
southward of our position on the Arctic Circle. Summer in league 
with the sun had been fighting winter and the ncn-th wind all along 
the line, and had been as hopelessly beaten everywhere as we were 
witnesses that it had been in our part of the river. At length, when 
the final victory of summer looked the most hopeless, a change was 
made in the command of the forces. Suinmer entered into an alliance 
with the south wind. The sun retired in dudgeon to his tent behind 
the clouds; mists obscured the landscape; a soft south wiml played 
gently on the snow, which melted under its all-powerful influence like 
butter u])on hot toast; the tide of battle was suddenly turned; the 
armies of winter soon vanished into thin water and beat a hasty retreat 
toward the pole. Theett'ect on the great river was magical. Its thick 
armor of ice cracked with a loud noise like the rattling of thunder; 
every twenty-four hours it was lifted up a fathom above its former 
level, broken up, first into ice floes and then into i)ack ice, and marched 
downstream at least 100 miles. Even at this great speed it was more 
than a fortnight before the last straggling ice blocks passed our post of 
observation on the Arctic Circle; but during that time the river had 
risen 70 feet above its winter level, although it was 3 miles wide and 
we were in the middle of a blazing hot summer, picking flowers of a 
hundred different kinds and feasting upon wild ducks' eggs of various 
species. Birds abounded to an incredible extent. Between ^lay 29 
and June 18 I identified sixty-four species which I had not seen before 
the breakup) of the ice. Some of them stopped to breed and already 
had eggs, but many of them followed the retreating ice to the tundra, 
and we saw them no more until, many Aveeks afterward, we had sailed 
down the river beyond the limit of forest growth. 

The victory of the south wind was absolute, but not entirely unin- 
terrupted. Occasionally tlie winter made a desperati^ stand against 
the sudden onrush of summer. The north wind rallied its beaten 
forces for days together, the chiuds and the rain were driven back, and 



392 THE NORTH POLAR BASIN. 

the half-melted snow frozen on the surface. But it was too late; there 
were many large patches of dark ground which rapidly absorbed the 
sun's heat, the snow melted under the frozen crust, and its final col- 
lapse was as rapid as it was complete. 

In the basin of the Yenisei the average thickness of the snow at the 
end of winter is about 5 feet. The sudden transformation of this 
immense continent of snow, which lies as gently on the earth as an 
cider-down quilt upon a bed, into an ocean of water rushing madly 
down to the sea, tearing everything up that comes into its way, is a 
gigantic display of power, compared with which an earthquake sinks 
into insignificance. It is difficult to imaguie the chaos of water which 
must have deluged the country before the river beds were worn wide 
enough and deep enough to carry the water away as quickly as is the 
case now. If we take the Lower Yenisei as an example, it maybe i^os- 
sible to form some conception of the work which has already been done. 
At Y^eniseisk the channel is about a mile wide; 800 miles lower down 
(measuring the windings of the river), at the village of Kureika, it is 
about 3 miles wide; and following the mighty stream for about another 
800 miles down to the Brekofisky Islands, it is nearly G miles wide. 
Tlie depth of the channel varies from 50 to 100 feet above the winter 
level of the ice. This ice is about 3 feet thick, covered with 6 feet of 
snow, which becomes flooded shortly before the break-up and con- 
verted into about 3 feet of ice, white as marble, which lies above the 
winter blue ice. When the final crash comes, this field of thick ice is 
shattered like glass. The irresistible force of the flood behind tears 
it up at an average rate of 4 miles an hour, or about 100 miles a day, 
and drives it down to the sea in the form of ice floes aiul pack ice. 
Occasionally a narrow part of the channel or a sharp bend of the river 
causes a temporary check; but the pressure from behind is irresistible, 
the pack ice is piled into heaps, and the ice floes are doubled up into 
little mountains, which rapidly freeze together into icebergs, which float 
ott' the banks as the water rises. Meanwhile, other ice floes come up 
behind; some are driven into the forests, where the largest trees are 
mown down by them like grass, whilst others press on until the barrier 
gives way and the waters, suddenly let loose, rush along at double 
speed, carrying the icebergs with theui with irresistible force, the 
pent-up dam which has accumulated in the rear often covering hun- 
dreds of square miles. In very little more than a week the ice on the 
800 miles, from Y^eniseisk to the Kureika, is completely broken uj), and 
in little more than another week the second 800 miles, from the Kureika 
to the Brekoflsky Islands, is in the same condition. 

During the glacial epoch the annual fight between winter and the 
sun nearly always ended in the victory of the former. Even now the 
fight is a very desperate one within the Polar Circle and is subject to 
much geograi)hical variation. The sun alone has little or no chance. 
The armies of winter are clad in white armor, absolutely proof agaiust 



THE NORTH POLAR BASIN. 393 

the sun's darts, which glance harmlessly on G feet of snow. In these 
high latitudes the angle of incidence is yery small, even at midday in 
midsummer. The sun's rays are reflected back into the dry air with as 
little effect as a shell which strikes obliquely against an armor plate. 
But the sun does not tight his battle alone. He has allies which, like 
the arrival of the Prussians on the field of Waterloo, finally determine 
the issue of the battle in his favor. The tide of victory turns earliest 
in Norway, although the Scandinavian Fjeld forms a magnificent for- 
tress, in which theforces of winter intrench themselves in vain. This 
fort^es^• looks as impregnable as that on the opposite coast, and would 
doubtless prove so were it not for the fact that in this part of the Polar 
Basin the sun has a most potent ally in the Gulf Stream, which soon 
routs the armies of winter and compels the fortress to capitulate. 

The suddenness of the arrival of summer m Siberia is probably largely 
due to the geographical features of the country. In consequence of 
the vastness of the area which is drained by the great rivers, and the 
immense volume of water which tliey have to carry to the sea, the 
break up of the ice in their lower valleys precedes, instead of being 
caused by, the melting of the snow toward the limit of forest growth. 
The ice on the effluents either breaks up after that on the main river, 
or is broken up by irresistible currents from it which flow up stream, — 
an anomaly for which the pioneer voyager is seldom i)repared; and 
when the captain has escaped the danger of battling against an attack 
of pack ice and ice floes from a quarter whence it was entirely unex- 
pected, he may l)e suddenly called upon to face a second army of more 
tbrmidable ice floes and pack ice from the great river itself, and if his 
ship survive the second attack a third danger awaits him in the alter- 
nate rise and fall of the tributary as each successive barrier where the 
ice gets jammed in its march down the main stream below the junction 
of the river accumulates iintil the pressure from behind becomes irre- 
sistible, when it suddenly gives way. This alternate advance and 
retreat of the beaten armies of winter continued for about ten days 
during the battle between summer and winter of which 1 was a witness 
in the valley of the Yenisei. On one occasion I calculated that at least 
50,000 acres of pack ice and ice floes had been marched up the Ivureika. 
The marvel is what became of it. To all appearance half of it never 
came back. Some of it no doubt melted away during the ten days' 
marches and countermarches: some drifted away from the river on the 
flooded places, which are often many square miles in extent; some got 
lost in the adjoining forests, and was doubtless stranded among the 
trees when the flood subsided; and some were piled up in layers one 
upon the top of the other, which more or less imperfectly froze together 
and formed icebergs of various shapes and sizes. Some of the icebergs 
which we saw going down the main stream were of great size, and as 
nearly as we could estimate stood from 20 to 30 feet above the surface 
of the water. These immense blocks appeared to be moving at the 
rate of from 10 to 20 miles an hour. The grinding together of the 



394 THE NORTH POLAR BASIN. 

sliai'p edges of the inmiinerable masses of ice as they were driven 
dowu stream by tiie irresistible pressure from behind produced a shrill 
rustling sound that could be heard a mile from the river. 

The alternate marching of this immense quantity ofice up and down 
the Knreika was a most curious i)henomenou. To see a strong current 
up stream for many hours is so contrary to all previous experience of 
the behavior of rubers that one can n(>t help feeling continuous aston- 
ishment at the novel sight. The nionotony which nnght otherwise have 
intervened in a ten days' march i)ast of ice Mas continually broken by 
complete changes in the scene. Sometimes tiie current was upstream, 
sometimes it was down, and occasionally there was no ciirrent at all. 
Frequently the pack ice and ice Hoes were so closely jammed together 
that there was no apparent difficulty in scrambling across them, and 
occasionally the river was free from ice for a short time. At other 
times the river was thinly sprinkled over with ice blocks and little ice- 
bergs, Avliich occasionally "calved" as they travelled on, with much 
commotion and splashing. The ])henomenon technically called "calv- 
ing" is curious, and sometimes quite startling. It takes place when a 
number of scattered ice blocks are quietly- floating down stream. All 
atJonce a loud splash is heard as a huge lump of ice rises out of the 
w^ater, evidently from a considerable depth, like a young whale coming 
up to breathe, noisily beats back the waves that the sudden upheavel 
has caused, and rocks to and fro for some time before it finally settles 
down to its floating level. There can be little doubt tliat what looks 
like a comparatively small ice block Hoating innocentl}' along is really 
the top of a formidable iceberg, the greater part of which is a sub 
merged mass of layers of ice piled one on the top of the other, and in 
many places very imperfectly fro/en together. By some accident, per- 
haps by grounding on a hidden sandbank, perhaps by the water get- 
ting between the layers and thawing the few places where they are 
frozen together, the bottom layer becomes detached, escapes to the 
surface, and loudly asserts its commencement of an independent exist- 
ence with the commotion in the water which generally proclaims tlie 
fact that an iceberg has calved. 

Finally comes the last march past of the beaten forces of winter, the 
ragtag and bobtail of the great Arctic army that comes straggling down 
the river when the <-ainpaign is all over — worn and weather-beaten lit- 
tle i<;ebergs, dirty ice floes that look like floating sandbanks, and strag- 
gling pack ice in the last stages of consumption that looks strangely 
out of place under a burning sun between banks gay with the gayest 
flowers, amidst the buzz of moscpiitoes, th(^ music of song birds, ami 
the harsh cry of gulls, divers, ducks, and sandpipers of various species. 

I have been thus diffuse in describing these scenes, in the first place, 
because they are very grand; in the second place, because they ha\'e 
so important a bearing ui)on climate, one of the great factors which 
determine the geographical distribution of animals and plants; and in 
the third place, because they have never been sufficiently emphasized.

THE PRESENT STANDPOINT OF GEOdUAI'HY.* 



By Clements H. Markham, V. H. S. 



The work of geogTai^liical discovery, during- livinj;- memory, has pro- 
ceeded with such rapidity that many ot us hav<' been halt inclined to 
think that there is little left to be done.' Brilliantly successful expedi- 
tions have traversed the unknown parts of the great continents, blank 
■es on our maps have been tilled up year after year, entrancing nar- 
ratives of perilous adventure have held us in rapt attention during 
each succeeding- session, until we are tempted to believe that the glori- 
ous tale is nearly told. But this is very far indeed from being the case. 
There are still wide tracts, in all the great divisions of the earth, which 
are unknown to us, and which will furnish work to explorers for many 
years to come, while the examination of ocean depths is an important 
task which has but lately been commenced. Moreover, there are regions 
of vast extent whicli are only very partially known to us, the more 
detailed examination of which will enable explorers to collect geo- 
graphical information of the highest value and of the greatest interest. 
It is from the methodical study of limited areas that science derives the 
most satisfactory results. When such investigations are commenced 
it is found how meager and inaccurate previous knowledge derived 
from the cursory information, picked up during some rajiid march, had 
been. A detailed scientific inonograi)h on a little known region of 
comparatively small extent supplies work of absorbing interest to the 
explorer, while he has the satisfaction of knowing that his labors will 
be of lasting value and utility. There is sufiicient work of this less 
ambitious, but not less serviceable kind to occupy a whole army of tield 
geographers for many decades. Exact delineation, by trigonometrical 
measurement, is our crowning work. It is barely commenced. With 
the excejttion of countries in Europe, British India, the coast of the 
United States, and a small part of its interior, the whoh^ world is still 
unmai>ped. Supposing that the surface of the earth does not undergo 
changes, our work will be completed centuries hence, when all the 
regions of the earth have been discovered, have been exi)lored in detail,

and have been scientitically mapped. As the earth's surface is in con- 
stant process of change, our work will never be completed, and we must 
as a race of men labor at it without ceasing. We of this generation 
have received the torch of geographical knowledge from onr fathers. 
It is for us to ditt'use its light over a wider and wider circle while we 
live, and to hand it on, still burning brightly, to our descendants. 

All of us, all the Fellows of this great Society, ought to work in our 
several lines and capacities, for all can hel}) in the diffusion of the light 
of knowledge, some in one way, some in another. I have thought, 
therefore, that we might usefully set apart the opening night of our 
present session for taking a survey; it must necessarily be a rough and 
incomplete survey, but still a general sarvey of some of the work that 
is before us; of the regions that are still unknown and await discov- 
ery, of the tracts that seem most to need more detailed exploration, 
and of the principal geographical problems that remain to be solved. 
We may also glance at the ways in which our society has furnished in 
the past, and may still more in the future furnish aid toward further- 
ing and helping in the great work that is always before us. 

The l*olar areas contain by far the most extensive unknown tracts 
on the globe. Explorers and geographers have been occupied with the 
Arctic regions for the last three centuries, and more especially during 
the last century. Their labors have added a very bright page to the 
story of British maritime achievement. The expeditions have brought 
back abundant valuable results in all branches of science, and by open- 
ing the M^ay to lucrative fisheries have increased the wealth of the 
nation. But their great use has been that to which Lord Beaconstield 
referreil in 1874, "the importance of encouraging that spirit of enter- 
prise which has ever distinguished the English people." At i^resent 
it is our watch below as regards the Arctic regions. We have taken a 
back seat, from which we look on while others do the work. Mr. Peary, 
after a very perilous and adventurous reconnaissance last year, is no\y 
preparing, amidst all the hardships of an Arctic winter, for a supreme 
effort to solve one of the great remaining geographical problems, the 
insularity of Greenland. Our gallant friend Nansen is engaged upon a 
still more heroic enterprise. I believe that the argument on which his 
proceedings are based is sound. I know that if thorough knowledge, 
mature reflection, courage of the highest order, indomitable persever- 
ance, and the faculty for command can secure success Hansen is the 
man to achieve it. But the natural obstacles are very great, and it 
may well be beyond human power to overcome them. We can only 
give these gallant men our warmest sympathy, and resolve that our 
welcome on their return shall be hearty and cordial. 

But even when the great geograi)hical problems with which Nansen and 
Peary are now grapi)linghave been fully solved there will still be a vast 
unknown area within the Arctic Circle and much important work to be 
done. For several reasons I believe that there is land between Prince 



THE PRESENT STANDPOINT OF GEOGRAPHY. 397 

Patrick Island and Siberia Avhicli ougbt to be discovered. The extent 
of the ancient ice ought to be ascertained by an expedition up Jones 
Sound. Franz Josef Land, particularly the coasts and islands on its 
northern face, offer materials of peculiar interest to the ex])l<)rer. Mr. 
Jackson, who left last suniiner to explore the Yahnal Peninsula, has 
proposed to lead an expedition in this direction. The ditticulties will 
be formidable and ought not to be disguised, but the value of the scien- 
tific results to be attained are well worth the unavoidable risk. Another 
direction for research is the area immediately to the north of Cape 
Chelyuskin, in Siberia, where Lieut. Hovgaard, on plausible grounds, 
believes that there is extensive land. It will occupy at least five suc- 
cessive Arctic expeditions, all entirely successful, to complete our knowl- 
edge of the North Polar area, and this society ought never to rest satis- 
fied until the work is thoroughly done. For it must be borne in mind 
that this work will not only unfold to us the varied phenomena of the 
unknown regions. The earth's surface is a connected whole and its 
phenomena are inter-dependent. For example, the climate of Europe, 
as was pointed out in 1873, in no small degree depends on the atmos- 
])heric conditions of the Polar area. For the satisfactory appreciation 
of these phenomena a precise acquaintance with the distribution of land 
and water north of the Arctic Circle is quite necessary, and of that our 
knowledge is still very unlimited. 

If a vast extent of the North Polar area is still unknown, and if, 
as is undoubtedly the case, its complete examination is a scientific; 
desideratum, how much more is this the case within the South Polar 
area? The Antarctic regions, with millions of unknown square miles 
full of geographical work, and teeming with the most interesting- 
scientific problems, have been totally neglected by us for half a century. 
It is not necessary that I should say more, because at our next meeting 
Dr. John Murray will address us fully on the important results to be 
derived from Antarctic discovery, and stir up our enthusiasm as geog- 
raphers and our patriotism as Britons so that we may all combine in a 
hearty effort to procure the renewal of Antarctic research. Certainly 
fifty years is a long time for us to have totally neglected so vast and so 
important a field for geographical discovery. We may now look forward 
to a most interesting Antarctic meeting on November 1*7, and, mean 
while, we will continue our survey of the other parts of the world, which 
either need further exploration or are entirely unknown. 

There is plenty of interesting work even in our quarter of the globe, 
although there are now no discoveries to be made. Even in our own islands 
some of the lakes are unsurveyed and were not systematically sounded 
until our accomplished librarian began the useful work in Cumberland 
this year. The topography of the Alps may be considered to be fairly 
complete, but there are still physical inquiries of great interest which 
commend themselves to scientific Alpine travelers, such as the extent 
and action of ice, the oscillations of glaciers, the origin of the FoUu 



398 THE PRESENT STANDPOINT OF GEOGRAPHY. 

wind, and the effects of the destruction of forests. The liistorical fjeogra- 
pby of the Alps is also in process of elucidation, and in this department 
oar associate, the Kev. W. B. Coolidge, of Magdalen College, Oxford, 
is one of the most industrious workers, but much remains to be done. 
It will l)e remembered too that our secretary, Mr. Douglas Freshtield, 
has written a i)aper on the long-dis[)uted passage of the Alps by Han- 
nibal, and, although his solution of the question has not been univer- 
sally accepted, it is adopted in the latest edition of Arnold's " liome." 
Beyond the Alps there is need of a fuller description of the Oantabrian 
Highlands along the north of Spain, but it is the Balkan Peninsula 
which otters the best new ground in Europe for mountain travelers. 
This year our Oxford travelling scholar, Mr. Cozens-Hardy, has been 
investigating one of the least-explored and worst-mapped regions in 
Europe, that on the frontiers of Montenegro. The value of his work is 
best showu by the fact that the intelligence department has under- 
taken the production of a map based on his observations. On the 
borderland of P^urope and Asia the Caucasus has been revealed to us, 
and we have been made familiar with the splendor of its forests and 
frozen crests within the last (juarter of a century, thanks to our gold 
medallist, Dr. Kadde, and other Alpine climbers. In this region Siguor 
W. Sella, our honoiary associate, M. de Decby, and iMr. H, Woolley 
have conspicuously proved what photogra|)hy can do to present a living 
picture of the physical features and of the inhabitants of a hitherto 
little known country, lieccntly the Jiussian Covernment has under- 
taken a survey of the Caucasus, and the results, as far as tliey are 
available, retiect the highest credit on the officers em[)loyed; but the 
range is of great extent, and here there is plenty of room for mountain 
travelers to break new ground. 

The regions not yet traversed by explorers on the continent of Africa 
have shrunk very considerably since I became a fellow of this society. 
Barth and Vogel were then at work in the direction of Timbuctoo and 
Lake- Chad, Dr. Baikie was on the Niger, Dr. Livingstone was making 
his way to the coast at Loaiido, and Mr. Galton's companion, Anderssen, 
liad reached Lake Ngami; Burton had just proi>osed his expedition to 
Harar. Tanganyika, Victoria Nyanza, and Nyasa, the falls of the 
Zambesi, the heights of Kilimanjaro and Keiua had not been heard of. 
In those days almost every expedition that was sent into Africa revealed 
to us some geographical feature of commanding importance corroborat- 
ing or refuting the theories and speculations of students. 

At present there are only three regions, in Africa, of considerable 
area which otter o[)portunities for discovery on a large scale, namely, 
the Sahara, the region adjoining it to the south, and extending across 
Wadai to the watersheds of the Congo and Nile, and the region to the 
east of the Upper Nile, stretching south of Abyssinia, through the lands 
of the Gallas and Soiualis, to the eastern seaboard of the continent. 



THE PRESENT STANDPOINT OF GEOGRAPHY. 399 

111 the Sahara there are more especially two districts which would 
reward an enterprising- explorer. One has for its center the highlands 
of Tibesti, for onr knowledge of which we are solely dependent on the 
reports of Nachtigal and Gerhard Rolilfs. The other is the highland of 
Ahaggar. Col. Flatters lost his life in an attempt to explore it in 18S1, 
yet the diflficnlties can not be insurmountable. Great interest attaches 
to a thorough examination of the Atlas Mountains, but they are still 
rendered inaccessible in some parts by fanatical tribes. 

The second large unknown African region includes Wadai and the 
districts lying between the scene of Junker's exploration in the east 
and the route recently taken by M. Maistre, in his journey from the 
Ubangi to the Shari. Wadai has only been visited by three Europeans. 
Dr. Vogel was murdered at Wara in 1856, and his diaries have never 
been recovered. Nachtigal crossed the country from west to east in 
1873. Lieut. Masari did so in the opposite direction in 1880. A Euro- 
pean traveller would doubtless meet with considerable difficulties in an 
exploration of Wadai proper, but the outlying districts of this region 
certainly deserve attention, and they are now much more eiisily acces- 
sible from the Ubagni-Welle, or the upper Benue, than they were some 
years ago. 

Far more interesting, however, is the vast region, the greater part of 
which is unexplored, which stretches from the Upper Nile to the Indian 
Ocean. It includes not only the territories of the Galla and Somali, but 
also those highlands to the south of Abyssinia, where little progress 
has been made since the visit of D'Abbadie to Ivaffa in 184o. There 
are commercial as well as geographical motives for opening up these 
almost uidvnown highlands. When I was at Senate, in Abyssinia, a 
merchant arrived from Katta or Enarea with donkeys laden -with coffee. 
I had an interesting conversation with him. Dr. Krapf acting as my 
interpreter. The man said that he had crossed the whole of Abyssinia 
to find a market for his goods, and that he was on his way to Massawa. 
We afterward heard that he was robbed and murdered in the Dagonta 
Pass; so that he never reached his market. This incident has always 
given me a special interest in the highlands south of Abyssinia; and 
parts of them have recently been visited by Italian travellers. Chiarini 
and Cecchi made their way from Shoa to Kaffa, Soleillet reached Katfa 
in 1882, Borelli explored the sources of the Ilawash in 1888, and 
reached the Omo flowing to Lake Rudolf, and Dr. Traversi examined 
the upper Hawash, and Dr. Stecker reached Lake Zuway. The inter- 
esting lake district to the south of Shoa is probably most accessible 
from the north. But assaults should be made on the southern extremity 
of the great Abyssinian Mountain i^lateau. from the east or the south, 
by expeditions starting from Kisimayu or Lake Rudolf. Mr. Chanler, 
with Lieut. Hohnel and Capt. Bottego, who are at present in the tield, 
may possibly solve the problem of the sources of the Jub, but even if 



400 THE PRESENT STANDPOINT OF GEOGRAPHY. 

they do succeed there will still rcniaiii splendid opportiiuities for future 
expeditions.* 

The Italians have recently made great efforts to ascertain the geo- 
graphical features of the Somali country. Signor Bricchetti-Eobecchi, 
especially, has travelled along the whole coast from Mukadisho to 
Allula, and has also crossed the Somali country from Obbia on the shore 
of the Indian Ocean to Berbera on the Gulf of Aden. We had the 
pleasure of welcoming this ardent explorer in the autumn. He had 
previously written a charming book describing his visit to the oasis of 
Jupiter Amnion. 

The country west of the Jub lies within the British sphere of influ- 
ence, and the interests of geography, no less than those of commerce, 
make it desirable that its exploration should be undertaken by British 
travelers. As soon as friendly relations cau be established with the 
Somali and Galla living at the back of Kisimayu, an expedition into 
the country of the Borana Galla ought not to meet with insuperable 
difficulties. Camels, horses, and donkeys are procurable there, so that 
the work of explorers would be much facilitated. A depot might be 
established on or near Lake Rudolf, a district which is said to be rich 
in ivory, and relations might then be established with the tribes inter- 
vening between that lake and the highlands south of Abyssinia, includ- 
ing Kaffa and Enarea. Exploring journeys both from the Shoa coun- 
try to the south, or northward from Lake Rudolf, would lead to a region 
which, although the last to be taken in hand, is certainly one of the 
most interesting in the interior of Africa. 

Outside the regions just referred to we may be said to have obtained 
a fair knowledge of the general geographical features of the African 
continent. Much detail remains to be filled in, and much of the work, 
executed in a hasty and superficial manner, requires to be done over 
again. There are also regions of great interest which have been 
visited, but which will well repay detailed examination. The moun- 
tains of Ruwenzori were discovered by Stanley, and have since been 
passed on the west side by Stuhimann. Capt. Lugard, whom you had 
the pleasure of welcoming from Uganda in the last session, was the 
first to pass them on the eastern side. These mouutains and the coun- 
try between them and Lake Tanganyika comprise a piece of work which 
Mr. Scott Elliot has just set out with the intention of carefully exe 
cuting. Most valuable results may, I think, be anticipated from hie 
labors. 

Excellent work of the same character has just been completed by our 

correspondent, Dr. Gregory, on Mount Kenia, and we anticipate a most 

interesting paper from this accomplished explorer in the course of the 

session. 

Many of the itineraries which crowd and fill up our maps are based 

* Capt. Bottego has eince returned to Europe. 



THE PRESENT STANDPOINT OF GEOGKAPHY. 401 

upon very imperfect materials. Mr. liavenstein, whose unrivalled 
knowledge of all that concerns the mapping of Africa is well known, 
has pointed out to me the want of reliable scientific observations even 
on routes which have been traversed several times. It is not pos 
sible to lay them down on a map with confidence in consequence of 
these deficiencies. The Victoria Falls of the Zambesi, for instance, 
have been visited by scores of travellers, but their exact geographical 
position is still uncertain. Careful astronomical observations have 
never been taken there. Then, again, the statements as to the height 
of Lake Ngami above the sea actually vary between 15,260 and 3,700 feet. 
The Tioge, which enters that lake on the north, has been repeatedly 
ascended, but observations for latitude have never been taken. Sim- 
ilar instances of opportunities neglected might be adduced from all 
parts of Africa, the most deplorable one being that of the now aban- 
doned Egyptian Sudan, where an extensive net of telegraphic wires 
was never utilized for determining the longitudes of Khartoom and 
other places of importance. 

On the other hand, we must remember the admirable work done by 
our distinguished gold-medallist, Mr. O'Neill, in fixing the position of 
Blantyre. Equally careful observations have been taken by the Belgian 
officers in the basin of the Congo and on the shores of Lake Tanganyika. 
Nor must 1 fail to record the good work of the members of the Anglo 
Portuguese, Anglo-French, and Anglo-German boundary commissions, 
and of the officers of the Royal Engineers who carried out the surveys 
for a proposed Mombasa- Victoria railway. We must recognize estab- 
lished facts. It is the work of scientific and carefully trained explorers 
that we now need in Africa. The time for desultory exploring expe- 
ditions is past. Some parts of Africa, including Algeria and Tunis, 
Cape Colony, Natal, and Eritrea are now actually being surveyed. An 
extension of such surveys, on the system proposed by Col. Trotter at 
the Cardiff' meeting of the British Association, to other districts already 
occupied by Europeans is much to be desired. In tlie end they would 
prove cheaper than repeated expeditions yielding imperfect or unrelia- 
ble materials for the mai)-maker. 

Their extension over the greater part of Africa can not of course 
be thought of for many years to come. But I believe that it would be 
quite possible to drive certain carefully selected trunk lines across the 
continent which would serve as bases for all future exploration, and 
which would enable us to utilize existing materials far more efficiently 
than can be done at present. The positions of the main stations on 
these trunk lines would be carefully fixed by astronomical ol)servations, 
and there should be a number of meteorological stations supplied with 
standard barometers, so that we may be able to compute our aneroid 
observations with some confidence in the results. 

Such isthe work of the future as regards the African continent. There 
are two great areas of the Sahara to be discovered. There is Wadai 
SM 93 26 



402 THE PRESENT STANDPOINT OF GEOGRAPHY. 

to be explored. We hope that a well-equipped Eiifilisli expedition 
will, before very long', set out from a base on Lake Ilndolf and ])enetrate 
the highland regions south of Abyssinia. We also hope to receive much 
valuable geographieal iuforuuition from the contemplated work of the 
Hausa Association. There are numerous pieces of local exploration, 
such as the work undertaken by Mr. Scott Elliot in the liuwenzori, 
which are both interesting aud imi)ortaiit. Lastly, there is the estab 
lishmeut of lines of fixed positions and of meteorological stations 
which ought to be kept steadily in view by us and pushed forward as 
opportunity otters. This is the pioueer work which will keep well in 
advance of the regular surveys. The pace of African discovery, during 
my time, has been fast and furious. Hereafter it will be more steady 
and the work will be more scientific. We are proud, as a nation, of the 
illustrious men who, in the face of ai)palling sutterings and hardships, 
and in spite of what might well a})pear insuperable ditticulties, have 
supplied us, in a comi)araiively short number of years, with a general 
knowledge of the interior of Africa. We shall have to ask for equally 
high qualifications as travellers from those who will, in the future, 
emulate the examples of Livingstone and lUirton, of Speke and Grant, 
of Cameron and Stanley, and also for scientific attainments of a high 
order. That the right men will come to the front, who can doubt? 
Some, indeed, are already in the field. We must not, however, forget 
the warning voice ot my illustrious predecessor. Sir Bartle Frere. "No 
country," he said, " possesses the best raw material in such perfection 
as Great Britain. The strong physical constitution, the buoyant 
energy, the keen power of observation, the good-humored inditterence 
to opposition and danger, the determination not to be beaten, aremore 
common among our youth, more lasting among our seniors, than in 
most other races. But this very abundance of natural gifts is apt to 
give us a dangerous contempt for artificial culture. How often have 
our working geographers lamented the neglect of systematic training 
by some of our most enterprising travellers." These wise words were 
addressed to you twenty years ago, and I believe they w ere takcm to 
heart. Our young explorers now- pay much more attention to their 
scientific training than they did forinerh\ There is plenty of important 
work and plenty of very hard work in Africa still, and I am confident 
that Britain will i)roduce the right men to do it, and to do it well. If 
there are sucking Wellingtons and Nelsons among us, there are also 
sucking ]jurtons and Livingstones. The magnificent raw material sur- 
rounds us, and the men who possess the physical advantages enumer- 
ated b.y Sir Bartle Frere will surely add to them the needful scientific 
knowledge when they find that they must <pialify to become good 
ex-plorers. As our country has produced great African travellers in the 
past, so she will send them forth in the future. As long as there is 
work to be done, I say again that there will be no lack of volunteers. 
In the continent of Asia British geographers have been very active 



THE PRESENT STANDPOINT OF GEOGRAPHY. 403 

during tlie present century. Tliey liave made a trigonometrical survey 
of India, and we Icnow what those few words signify, what high scientific 
attainments were required, what hardships and dangers had to be 
encountered, what heaNy loss of life was entailed, and we also know how 
fruitful were the results. The names of Kennell, of Everest, of Waugli, 
of Montgomerie, and of our eminent colleagues Gens. James T. Walker 
and Sir Henry Thuillier, will forever occnpy very honorable niches in 
our geographical temi)le. British explorers have also surveyed and 
maj)ped ^Fesopotamia and Syria, Persia and Afghanistan ; they have 
navigated the Chinese rivers, penetrated over the passes of the Hima- 
laya, traversed the deserts of Manchuria and Turkistaa, and discovered 
the source of the Oxus. Still they have left a great deal for their suc- 
cessors to do. 

Perhaps the most interesting and important unknown Asiatic region 
is the southern part of Arabia, from Yemen on the west to Oman on the 
east, and between the sea coast and the states of Nejd in the interior. 
This unknown region is upward of 450 miles in extent, both in length 
and breadth. Hadramaut, with its lofty mountains and cultivated 
ravines, its settled i)opulation and historic past, is almost a sealed 
book to us. The little we know is derived from the narrative of 
journeys made by Baron von Wrede in 1843, and from the more recent 
excursion of Col. Miles in 1870. Wrede's stories of Himyaritic inscrip- 
tions, wild mountain passes, mysterious quicksands, and terraced cul- 
tivation only quicken our longing to know more. Hadramaut, like the 
Antarctic continent, has been totally neglected by us for half a century. 
I am hai)py to be able to announce to you that our accomplished asso- 
ciates, Mr. and Mrs. Bent, accompanied by a Mohammedan surveyor 
from India and other assistants, are about to undertake the ex]>lora- 
tion of this ])ractically unknown region. The excellent work they have 
already accomplished gives us the assurance that when we welcome 
their return we shall find that they have brought back a rich store of 
valuable and interesting information. 

Leaving Arabia and Syria, we find much work yet to be done in 
Asia Minor. The most important uuexplored field includes the upper 
valley of the Euphrates and Eastern Cappadocia, and toward this part 
of the work our society has already made a liberal contribution. Next, 
turning our attention to Persia, we come to a country which has been 
explored and reported upon by many of our countrymen since the days 
of Sir John Malcolm, and which has now, thanks to our colleague, 
Mr. Curzon,been admirably mapped. Yet even here, as I am informed 
by Mr. Curzon, plenty of useful geographical work remains to be done; 
while a good deal of information that has been collected by officers 
dispatched by the intelligence department at Simla continues to be 
" secret and confidential.'' Thus there are several gaps which it is in 
the power of i)rivate travelers to fill in, so that Persia still aflbrds an 
interesting and far from exhausted field for geographers. 



404 THE PRESENT STANDPOINT OF GEOGRAPHY. 

Entering from the west, jil though the frontier prcninee of Azerbaijan 
has, in its northern lialf, been systematically exi)lore(l and mapped by 
Eussian surveyors, in its southern parts and on the Turkish border 
attention might usefully be i^aid to the Persian Kurds, both nomad 
and seudeutary, the former mostly iu the mountains, the latter in the 
triaugie of which the three points are Suj-Bulah, Bijar, and Sinna. 
Farther south, Luristan still remains unexplored in many parts, espe 
cially in the western subdivision called Pusht-i-Kuh, the home of the 
Feili Lurs. Since Sir Henry Rawlinson and Sir A. Layard were there 
fifty years ago these regions have been almost unvisited. Again, to 
the west of the route, from Tehran to Ispahan, there is a number of 
small districts Avhich are very imperfectly known; while west of the 
road from Ispahan to Shiraz there is an absolute blank on the thirty- 
third parallel, between Kumishah and Yezd. Farther south, the Basha- 
kerd province and Persian Baluchistan are very little known and largely 
unexplored, and in Luristan there is a blank space on the maps between 
the coast range and the caravan route from Faizabad to Lar. So that 
it will be seen that there is a great deal to which a young geographer 
might devote his energies in Persia. The same may be said of Balu- 
chistan, where, between Kharan and the Mekran coast, excei)t along 
the old Kafilah route from Lus-Bela to Panjgur (which was traversed 
by Sir It. Sandeman in 1890), the map is almost a Dlank. 

Parts of Afghanistan are very dangerous for Europeans to be 
employed in, and our knowledge of the mountain ranges between 
Kabul and Herat, which are occupied by the Hazara and other tribes, 
is most inadequate. Our ignorance of Kafiristan is complete. We still 
know nothing whatever of that interesting country, and its explora- 
tion is very desirable. Officers have been on its frontier — Col. Tanner 
on the side of the Kunar River, my old friend. Sir William Lockhart, 
on the north, and the late Mr. McNair from the side of Chitral. But 
the country itself, from the passes of the Hindu Kush to the banks of 
the Kunar, is unknown. Its cxjjloration is one of the great geograph- 
ical achievements that remain to be done in Asia. The results would 
be important both from a itolitical, a geographical, and possibly a com- 
mercial ])oint of view, and there could be few nobler ambitions for a 
young aspirant than to be the first ex^dorer of Kafiristan. In south 
ern Afghanistan much also remains to be done, as, for instance, inthe 
tracts to the west of the British iroiitier, between the Zhob and Iviir- 
ram valleys. 

The Pamir table-land has been largely explored by several European 
travelers; but there is plenty of room for further work, and a sys- 
tematic survey of the whole region would be a valuable contribution to 
geograi^hy. Farther to the east the plains of Turkistan have been 
elaborately explored, and are sufficiently well known. The mountains 
and hills to the south, however, being spurs from the Mustagh Hima- 
layan ranges, are very imperfectly understood- It is doubtful, for

instance, whether the Yarkand River, which rises in tliose ranges, flows 
some distance westward before it enters the plain, or whether it breaks 
tbrongh the mountains 30 or 40 miles to the east and proceeds direct 
to Yarkand. A fairly accurate survey of the northern slopes of the 
Himalayan lianges and the adjoining portions of eastern Turkistan is 
much needed, although a great deal of good work has quite recently been 
executed in the loftier parts of those ranges. 

The recent journey of Mr. Conway among the glaciers and higher 
passes of the Mustagh Himalayas is an example of what the courage 
and skill of an able private explorer may do under the most difficult 
circumstances. Starting from Plnnza and Nagar, he surveyed a con- 
siderable area of country at great altitudes, and he has been able to 
correct and add to the survey of this region, which was executed by 
Col. Godwin Austen. Fellows of the society have already listened to 
Mr. Conway's graphic narratives, and before long his })ainstaking and 
minutely accurate map of one of the most remarkable portions of the 
Himalayan glacier region will be in your hands. In the same region, 
but still farther north, officers of the Indian Survey are pushing their 
observations, and we may hope in due time to be furnished with the 
results. Another surveyor, Mr. Senior, has done much valuable work 
under circumstances of unusual difficulty, among the higher ranges of 
Kula and Lahaul. His merits have been recognized by our 'council, 
and he has been awarded our Murchison Grant. 

^Farther to the east, along the Himalayan chains, the kingdom of 
Nepal covers a tract of country about 500 miles long and 100 miles 
broad, lying between the crests of the mountains and the British fron 
tier. This is still almost a blank upon our maps. Europeans, except 
a few officers at the capital, are debarred by treaty from entering x»repal 
so that the country is very imperfectly known. The passes from ]S^e]>al 
into Tibet have a special interest for us, because the only great army 
that has invaded India since the commencement of British rule in 
Beiigal marched through one of them, the Kirong Pass, and so 
descended from the valley of the Tsanpo into Nepal. It has never, I 
believe, been visited by any European. 

Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, has never been visited by any English- 
man since the days of Manning. There is also a vast and wholly unex- 
plored region of Tibet on the northwest, between the parallels of 34° 
and 36° and the meridians of 82° and 90°. It lies between the explo- 
rations of Capt. Bower on the south side and those of Col. Pevtsof and 
M. Bogdanovich on the north. In southwest Tibet there are also great 
belts of unknown country between the routes of Pundit Nain Sing from 
Ladak to Lhasa, and his route along the upper course of the Yaro- 
Tsanpo River; also between that river and the crests of the Himalayan 
ranges, which form the border of Western Nepal. The course of the 
Tsanpo and the adjoining country on both banks are well known as far 
as the meridian of 93°, and fairly well, but with some uncertainty, to 



406 THE PRESENT STANDPOINT OF GEOGRAPHY. 

04'^ 10'. But from that point down to its entrance into tbe Assam Val 
ley, untler tbe name of the Dihong- Kiver, it is wholly unknown. So 
also is the country eastward up to the meridian of 97° — a region which 
is probably the basin of the tributaries of the Dibong River, which 
flows into the Lohit-Brahniaputra a few miles above the point where 
the latter river joins the Dihoug or Tsanpo. 

The great rivers of central and eastern Tibet — the Giama-Nu Chu, 
the Lantsan, and the Di Chu — are fairly well known in parts; but there 
are considerable portions of the first river, moie particularly, whicli 
need further exploration. There is considerable uncertainty whether, 
below where there is a ferry on the road from Daynl to Kima, the 
Giama Nu-Chu flows southward as the source of the Salwin, or south- 
westward and is the principal source of the Irawadi. This is a geo 
graphical i3roblem of great interest, and offers a splendid oppoi- 
tunity for ambitious young explorers to win their spurs. This whole 
region of complicated mountain and river systems, whicli still conceals 
the sources of the great Burmese streams, urgently calls for bold and 
hardy explorers to disentangle it. It is the borderland of several 
races, mostly broken up into minute tribal divisions, which present the 
same interest to the anthropologist as their country does to the geogra- 
pher. 

In Burma itself much information is still needed to complete our 
knowledge of its geography; but this desideratum is being system- 
atically attended to by the Indian survey department. In Siam 'Slv. 
McCarthy has recently constructed a map, and the trade routes between 
Chieng Mai and the Upper Mekong liave been traversed by Holt Ilal- 
lett, Carl Boch, Archer, and others. But the region lying to the south, 
between the Menam Valley and the lower Mekong, is almost unknown 
to Englishmen. A thorough acquaintance with the country on tlie 
western side of the Mekong is very desirable: such as the cis-^Nrckong 
parts of Luang Prabong and of Nan, and the parts intended to be 
opened up by the projected railway from Bangkok to Korat. I may 
here mention that a valuable communication has just been received 
from Mr. H. Warington Smyth, describing his voyage up the Menam 
and his journeys in the mountainous country to the west of the JNIekong. 
Our young- correspondent is a son of our former colleague, the late Sir 
Warington Smyth, and a grandson of our President Admiral Smyth, 
to whom the society owes so much, and was one of our seven founders. 
Mr. Warington Smyth's narrative is of geographical value and r; 
charmingly written, and it is pleasant to find that in this instance the 
geograi)hical mantle of my distinguished predecessor has so worthily 
descended on his grandson. In the Malay Peninsula there is also 
much to be done; and Mr. Lake has just brought home some good sur 
veying work of previously unexplored country in the territory of Johoi c. 
But we have to deplore the death of iNIr. Becher, who unfortunately 
lost his life in a river in the southern part of the Malay Peninsula just 



THE PRESENT STANDPOINT OF GEOGRAPHY. 407 

after he bad entered upon what promised to be a useful piece of geo- 
graphical work. 

Passing over the great Empire of China, which has been traversed 
in numerous directions, and the geography of which is tolerably well 
understood, we come to Korea. In this peninsula, which until lately 
had scarcely been visited, the pack roads between the principal towns 
are now pretty well known, but there remain a number of routes on the 
western side, from Seoul down to the south coast, and on the east side 
between Gensaii and Fusan, which 3Ir. Cuzron informs me have either 
not been traversed in modern times or are wholly unexplored. There 
is very great need of a survey and map of Korea, and, apart from the 
pack roads, the mountainous parts of the country are quite unknown. 
There is thus very considerable scope for geographical enterprise in this 
great peninsula, which may be looked upon as one of the numerous 
allurements which the unknown parts of the world present to the 
explorer. 

Leaving the great Asiatic continent, and turning our attention to the 
mass of islands to the south, and stretching away eastward to the 
Pacific, we shall find that the most important future work will have to 
be done by the hydrographer rather than by the geographer. Doubt- 
less there are many unreported reefs and shoals, and others whose 
recorded positi(uis require verification. Yet when we think of the 
splendid work of Mr. Wallace in the Malay Archipelago, and ot the 
lonely residence of Mr. Forbes on Timor Laut, there can be no doubt 
that much is also left for the exi)lorer to do on land among those lovely 
islands. vSir William Macgregor will steadily proceed with the exam- 
ination of British New Guinea, and will encourage all well-conceived 
schemes of discovery. Mr. Woodford tells me that, in his opinion, a 
properly equipped expedition would have little diiliculty in passing 
from the headwaters of the Fly to those of the Empress Augusta 
Eiver, and so crossing New Guinea in its broadest part. Meanwhile 
the interior of Dutch New Guinea is a complete blank — another of tlie 
vast tracts which await discovery. Here there is an extensive range 
marked on the maps as the Charles Louis Mountains, and attaining a 
height of 1(),0(>() feet. The particular exploration of this range would 
offer work for geographers and naturalists for many years to come. 
Another interesting piece of work for a young explorer to undertake 
would be a definite solution of the question whether a passage exists 
right through the supposed isthmus from ^laclure Gulf to Geelvink 
Bay, as has l)een reported. More knowledge of the islands to the north 
of New Guinea is also needed, where the natives present the chief 
obstacle to exploration. In the Solomon Islands, Mr. Woodford was 
successful in visiting the interior of (xuadalcanal, but Bougainville 
Island is still absolutely virgin ground, and I am informed by Mr. 
Woodford that there is a most interesting elevated coral lagoon to the 
north of the island of New Georgia, which has hitherto been nude- 



408 THE PRESENT STANDPOINT OF GEOGRAPHY. 

scribed; while Eeniiell and Belloua Islands, to the south of the Solo- 
mon group, are said to be elevated about 400 feet above the sea, yet 
exclusively of coral form<ation. The natives are Polynesian, not of 
Melanesian race, and they would certainly well repay a visit. The 
whole question of the mingiing of Polynesian and Melanesian types on 
these groups of islands calls for careful investigation, as well as further 
study of the formation of coral reefs. Mr. Woodford suggests that it 
would be desirable, if funds could be obtained for the purpose, to make 
an experimental bore with a diamond drill upon some island of purely 
coral formation, situated in very deep water, and as far removed as pos- 
sible from any high land. He thinks one of the islands of the Gilbert 
or Ellice groups would be suitable for the experiment. 

It is unlikely that there are now any undiscovered islands in the 
Pacific, although I w^ell remember the time when we fully expected that 
there might be, and when we were ordered to enter in the deck log, 
during our watches, the visibility of distant objects. Thus our tracks 
formed belts varying from 10 to 15 miles wide, withiu which no new 
islands were to be found. 

Australia has now been explored in its whole extent. The work was 
watched with the deepest interest and sympathy by our society; and 
no less than twelve Australian explorers have received our gold medal. 
Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia proper 
are thoroughly well known; but in western Australia there are still 
large isolated tracts of the country in the interior which are unex- 
plored. The most important lies east of the one hundred and twen- 
tieth meridian and between about 21° and 24° south. Mr. Ernest 
Favenc points out that the important geographical fact to be deter- 
mined by an examination of this tract would be the settlement of the 
question whether Sturt's Creek again reformed, after having been for a 
time lost. Probably some patches of pastoral country and some uncon- 
nected water-channels and saline swamps would also be found. Mr. 
Favenc considers that the geographical jiroblem to be worked out in 
Australia, during the ensuing years, is the evolution of a last river 
system, which will fill up the gap between the heads of the west coast 
rivers and the Tjalve Eyre system. It is not likely that such a system 
will exist in anything more than a fragmentary form, but certain fixed 
drainage rules peculiar to that region may be found to exist which 
would dispel the present notion that the creeks there run at random to 
all points of the compass. The northern coast regions are now well 
known and fairly well settled throughout by sheep farmers; and the 
gold discoveries in the southwest of the continent are extending inland 
and may reach the unexplored space, as belts of auriferous country are 
known to exist across the interior. 

In New Zealand, as Mr. Douglas Freshfieldhas recently pointed out, 
a glorious field is open for the mountaineer, for the so-called Southern 
Alps have the glaciers of the Alps, the forests of the Caucasus, and the

^ords and waterfalls of Norway all brought into close juxtaposition. 
Stirred by the success of Mr. Green's ascent of Mount Cook, the young 
New Zealanders have formed an Alpine club, under the presidency of 
Mr. Harper. The proper line of exjiloration would be to continue 
establishing huts on both sides of the range, so that the relation and 
divergences between the west and the east flanks may be fully investi- 
gated. Hitherto the east side has been principally explored. 

Australia now has geographical societies of her own, active and 
learned bodies, which are doing good work. It has been suggested by 
Baron Sir Ferd. von Mueller, and his idea has been adopted by his col- 
leagues in Australia, that, with the object of establishing close affilia- 
tion between the parent society and all the branches, our council might 
annually elaborate a series of questions for transmission to our colonial 
and provincial colleagues. Such questions might refer to tidal obser- 
vations, oceanic currents, the most important spots for additional hyp- 
sometrical data, accurate determination of longitudes, and the settle- 
ment of new projects for exploration. 1 am quite of opinion that this 
suggestion is well worthy of the consideration of our council. 

The New World, including the two continents of North and South 
America, has been in process of discovery for the last four centuries. 
The nearer parts had to be settled before the more distant parts could 
be explored. The whole of the coasts, indeed, have been surveyed with 
more or less comijleteness, and the U. S. Coast Survey is a monument 
of rigorous accuracy. But much of the interior is still unknown or very 
partially explored. This is certainly the case in the Dominion of 
Canada, and Dr. George M. Dawson recently said that we are far from 
having acquired even a good general knowledge of fertile lands with a 
rigorous climate which will only yield hardy crops, although compara- 
tively little of the region capable of producing wheat is now altogether 
unknown. Then there are vast tracts of unknown country where possi- 
ble mineral wealth would be the only material incentive for their explor- 
ation. 

Within the Arctic Circle there is an unknown area covering 9,500 
square miles between the eastern boundary of Alaska, the Porcupine 
Elver, and the northern coast. Another area of 32,000 square miles of 
considerable interest, and probably containing the head waters of the 
White and Tanana rivers, lies west of the Lewes and Yukon, and 
extends to the Alaska frontier. There is an unknown tract of 27,000 
square miles between the Lewes, Pelly, aiul Stikiue rivers, which lies 
on the direct line of the metalliferous belt of the Cordillera. Between 
the Pelly and Mackenzie rivers there are 100,000 unknown square miles, 
including nearly 600 miles in length of the main range of the Rocky 
Mountains. Our back grant testimonialist, the Abbe Petitot, has made 
a short journey into the northern part of this area from the Mackenzie 
River, but otherwise no published information exists respecting it. 
Another Arctic area, between the Great Bear Lake and the northern

coast, covering' ;">(), 000 S(iuare miles, is also uiikiiowii, and yet another 
ot;)r),OUO scjuaie miles south of the Great Bear Lake, excei)t i'or the 
jouriieysof the Abbe Petitotand Mr. Maefarlane, Farther south there 
is an unknown tract of 81,000 square miles between the Stikine and 
Liard rivers to the north and the Skeena and Pesice rivers to the south, 
and another of 7,500 square miles between the Peace, Athabasca, and 
Loon rivers. An unexplored area south of the Athabasca Lake is 
35,00() s(iuare miles in extent. 

Turning' again to the Arctic regions, there is an area of 7,500 square 
miles east of the Coppermine and west of Bathurst Inlet, and another of 
31,(100 square miles between the Back River and the Arctic coast. 1 
quote Dr. Dawson's tigures, but I do not forget the work that has been 
done by Mr. Warburton Pike from the love of adventure, sometimes 
living on cariboo, at others on musk oxen, at others on caches formed 
when game was abundant, and at others suttering from starvation. 
With no companions, save a few Indians, he has crossed and re-crossed 
the barren lands of America. We next come to the vast unknown tract 
of 178,000 square miles between the Back River and the west coast of 
Hudson Bay, part of which was wandered over but not mapped or 
explored by Hearne in 1809-187li, and I believe it has also been traversed 
by Mr. Pike. There are smaller unknown areas to the south of Hudson 
Bay, while the whole interior of Labrador, covering 280,000 squaiemiles, 
is entirely unknown beyond the short routes of Prof. Hind, Mr. Low and 
Mr. Holme, and Pere Lacasse. This tract is believed to be more or less 
wooded, and in some parts with timber of large growth, but the prac- 
tical utility of its future exploration will probably be derived from its 
metalliferous ores. Dr. Dawson sums u}) his enumeration of unknown 
areas with the calculation that out of the .'>,470,287 square miles which 
form the area of the Dominion of Canada, 054,000 square miles, at the 
very least, are entirely unknown. In looking forward to the future 
examination of these areas. Dr. Dawson I'emarks that the explorers 
should be ])Ossessed of scientihc training and be able to make intelligent 
and accurate observations. The work of Mr. Green and Mr. Topliam 
in the Selkirk range of British Columbia has been excellent, and it has 
brought to our notice a region of the greatest orographic and geological 
interest, part of which is still unmapped and unvisited. 

In the United States there is much that remains to be done in Alaska, 
although the labors of Mr. Fred. Whymper, Seton-Karr, Topham, Nel 
son, and Ogilvie have thrown light on the alpine regions with their 
extensive glaciers, which culminate at Mount St. Eliasand on the basin 
of the Yukon. In the vast territory of the Union itself surveying work 
of a more exact and rigorous character is making progress, and the 
admirable coast survey from the Bay of Fundy to the iriouth of the 
Rio Grande on the east side and from the Strait of Juan de Fuca to 
San Diego on the Paciiic side is comi)let<'d. Its merits were cordially 
recognized by this society when our gold medal was conferred upon

Prof. Baclie iu 185S, Julaiid topograpliy however owes most to the 
geologists, for Powell in the Kocky Mountains region, Hayden in the 
teriitories, and Clarence King on the fortieth parallel have been obliged 
to make their maps as they proceeded with their geological investiga- 
tions. The triangulation in the interior of the States was commenced 
late and its jirogress has been slow. 

There is a great deal of work for an exi»lorer in Central Anierica, 
where our associate, Mr. Maudslay, lias done so much excellent service, 
and where we are also indebted to the researches of ofticers from 
British Honduras. But it is m South America that the most extensive 
unexplored regions are still awaiting the visits of scientific travelers. 
Many parts of the Columbian Andes need exploration, as well as tlie 
basins of the great rivers Japura and Putumayo and some of the 
smaller affluents of the Amazon, such as the Pastasa, Moroua, San- 
tiago, Napo, and Tigre. There is an enormous tract in Colombia, bounded 
by the sloi)es of the Andes on the west, by the Orinoco and Rio Negro 
on the east, on the north by the Meta, and on the south by the Uaupes 
and Japura, which is practically unknown. I have called attention to 
this region ou previous occasions in the hope that some one would 
undertake its exploration. For it was here that the old conquerors of 
the sixteenth century, without watch or compass, sought for El Dorado. 
Another unknown region lies letween Guiana and the Amazon, while 
the rivers Jurus, Jutay, and Teffe are unexplored. The admirable sur- 
vey of the great River Purus and its main tributary secured for Mr. 
Chandless the gold medal of our society, but many of the afHuents of 
the Beni, tlowiug from the Andes of Cuzco, still require scientific 
exploration. 

The mighty Cordilleras of the Andes have only been very partially 
examined. From Mr. Whymiter\s delightful book, with its superb illus- 
trations, we learnt nnu-h about the famous peaks of Ecuador, and some 
of our ideas received correction; while the surveying labors of Mr. 
Wolf in the same region have led to the examiinition of the little 
known provinces between the Andes and the Pacific and to the pro- 
duction of a most valuable ma]) of Ecuador. In Peru the learned presi- 
dent of the Lima (leograi)hical Society, our honorary associate. Dr. 
Luis Carranza, has admirably described the geography of some of the 
provinces of the Andes. Still there is an uudescribed Andean region, 
comprised in the provinces of Lucanas, Parinacochas, Cangallo, Ayma- 
raes, and Cotabamba, and in the coast valleys and deserts betwceu 
Nasca and Lajes. Forbes, Minchin, and Weiner have ascended llii- 
mani and Illampu, but the mountains of the coast range farther south 
are almost unknown, and the great peaks of Sajama and Pallahnari 
are still unmeasured. 

Indeed, the whole orography of western South America is very imper- 
fectly understood, and would well repay further scientific examination. 
The great rivers of the Gran (!hacu, fiowing from the Bolivian Andes 



412 THE PRESENT STANDPOINT OF GEOGRAPHY. 

to the Paraguay, are still incompletely explored, especially the more 
northern streams. Capt. Page read a most interesting paper on the 
subject at our meeting on January 28, 1889. In the discussion which 
followed I mentioned that the Gran Cliacu was one of those regions to 
which geographers might point when they were tauntingly asked what 
was left for them to discover. Capt. Page has since lost his life — a 
martyr to science and to duty. His work will be taken up by others 
where he has left it. The exploration of these streams, especially of 
the Utuquis, and the region through which they pass, must needs be 
completed; for some day they will form great tiuvial highways of com- 
merce. Farther south there are tracts needing examination, especially 
along both sides of the dividing line between Chile and the Argentine 
Eepublic, as well as in Patagonia. The government of Neucinen is one 
of these, a region with mountain slojjes covered with beech {Fayus Ant- 
arctica) and pine [Araucaria BrasUiensls) forests and with active vol- 
canoes along its summits, while its rocks abound in fossil shells and 
wood and send forth thermal springs. The belief that in this district 
the Collon-cua (called in its upper part the Mumini), flowing to the 
Atlantic, has its source in the same lake as the Rio Bio, flowing to the 
Pacific, would be an interesting point for on explorer to clear up. I 
rejoice to tind, from an interesting memorandum furnished me by Capt. 
Don Benjamin Garcia Aparicio, of tUe Argentine corps of engineers, 
that exploration is being zealously promoted and encouraged by our 
sister geographic society at Buenos Ayres. 

We have now made a general survey of the unexplored and undis- 
covered lands of our globe. But the work of geographers is by no means 
confined to the land. 

It is nearly forty years since Maury published the first edition of his 
" Physical Geography of the Sea." He was the founder of a new and 
most interesting branch of our science, which treats of the ocean depths, 
of the currents and temperatures of the sea, of its biology, and of the 
surface of the ocean bottoms. In 1855 this was a new field of research, 
when the Arctic and the CyeJops were running their first lines of sound- 
ings across the North Atlantic, and when Brooke and Wallich were 
inventing the first apparatus for bringing up samples from great 
depths. Since then, through the labors of scientific oflQcers of several 
nationalities, the gates of this new field have been opened wider and 
wider. The result is due to the invention of improved appliances and 
to the persevering work of deep-sea soundings and dredgings as well 
in narrow seas as in the great oceans. This of course is not work for 
individual explorers, but rather for the governments of maritime 
nations. Yet I would urge upon theattention of naval officers, of otticers 
of the naval reserve, and of the mercantile marine that they all have 
frequent oi^portunities of adding to our knowledge, andof doing useful 
work in JV)rwarding the examinations of the depths of the sea and in 
contributing to our knowledge of meteorology. 



THE PRESENT STANJJPOINT OF GEOGRAPHY. . 413 

An immense mass of work remains to be done to enable us to liave 
even a rough and general knowledge of the ocean depths. Additional 
lines of soundings are needed in all directions, especially in the 
Southern Ocean and in the central Pacific, to bring out their general 
contignration. We now have a rough idea of the areas of greatest 
depths, the greatest of all having been obtained off" the coast of Japan 
by the Tmcarora in 4,655 fathoms; but the soundings of the Challenger 
between St. Thomas and Bernmda and of the Eijeria in the Pacific come 
very near to it. The discovery of the very greatest ocean depth will be 
most interesting, but it would be still more so to discover and map the 
submarine ranges and peaks to within, say, 500 ftithoms of the surface. 
I remember that when the Valorous ran a line of soundings across the 
North Atlantic in August, 1875, we got 1,860 fathoms on one day, 1,450 
on the next, and only 600 on the next, bringing up pieces of black vol- 
canic stone. On the two following days the depth increased to 1,250 
and 1,485 fathoms. Here there was clearly either a volcanic peak or a 
ridge; and wherever these are known to occur 1 think that it would be 
very desirable to explore the surrounding ocean bed and ascertain 
their extent and character. We want also the establishment of a more 
complete study of the system of ocean currents by a very extensive 
use of floats adapted to swim at various depths, and also a fuller inves- 
tigation of the temperature and density of the water surrounding the 
shores of all the continents. The work hitherto done in the North Sea 
and the neighboring Atlantic is practically confined to the summer 
months, and a detailed examination at all seasons is needed. Such 
work is now being done under the auspices of Profs. Petterssen, of 
Sweden, and Mohn, of Christiania, Kriimmel, of Kiel, and the fishery 
board of Scotland. We also require a determination of the isotherms 
and isobars on land and sea at all seasons, which will primarily 
involve prolonged observations in the South Polar region, and a more 
complete knowledge of the variation of atmospheric pressure with 
height, and its independent variation in different horizontal planes. 
Such an investigation embraces the whole question of the use of the 
barometer or boiling-point thermometer in measuring heights. 

This will conclude my enumeration of the geographical desiderata in 
the field. It is a long and formidable list, affording work for many 
decades of years to come. But-many of my associates know very well, 
and the rest must now clearly understand, that it is by no means an 
exhaustive list, but only such an enumeration as our limited time will 
admit of our making, merely a rough general survey of the work in the 
field that remains to be done. 

The work of explorers is co ordinated and rendered useful in many 
ways by geographical students, whose valuable labors desire equal 
attention and encouragement. There are many geographical problems 
Miiich must be solved as well by the examination and intercomparison 
of the work of numerous explorers in different regions as by the care-

fill .study and ap[>lication of tlio acliicveiuoiitis of t\\v devotees of our 
science in past ceutuile.s. The advance and extension of geograi)l»y 
depends as nuicli upon its students and scliolars as upon its discoverers 
and ex])Iorers. Comparative geograi)liy is indeed one of the highest 
branches of our science. By identifying sites, comparing descriptions 
\Yritten long ago with the actual surface of the ground, and by deniou- 
strating the changes which have taken place within historical times, it 
IS an indis[)ensable auxiliary to i)hysical geograi)hy. We shall, I am 
sure, all be glad to receive the results of the invest igations of our 
Oxford travelling scholar, Mr. (Iriindy, who has compared the narrative 
of Herodotus with the actual ground where the battle of Plata-a was 
fought. Comparative geography also enables us to comprehend the 
gradual evolution of our science through the discoveries and lifelong 
studies of a long series of devoted men during a succession of ages. 
Such knowledge is of the deepest interest. We therefore welcomed, 
in 1891, Dr. Schlichter's ably leasoned paper on Ptolemy's topography 
of eastern equatorial Africa, and we shall be glad to receive further 
results of his researches. Mr. Ryland's long and careful bibliographi- 
cal and mathematical study of Ptolemy and his laborious corrections 
and veritications have also resulted in an important addition to I'tole- 
maic literature. 

Thesi)iritin which geographical students enter upon their researches 
and the methods they adopt have a special interest at a time when the 
educational efforts of the society justify the expectation that their num- 
bers will soon increase. Dr. H. S. Schlichter, who has already coin 
municated the most interesting paper on Ptolemy's geography of 
Africa — to which 1 have just alluded— has explained to me his system 
of investigation. He not only uses history for the solution of i)hysical 
phenomena, but also resorts to physical facts and observations for 
solving (luestions of historical geography. By looking at the problem 
under consideration in all its bearings and the various ways which 
seem to lead to its solution an insight is obtained into the nature of the 
questions we have to deal with and into the trustworthiness of the 
sourceS'Of our information. fSuch studies lead from one ])roblem to 
another. They open up new questions and lines of research, and not only 
connect physical and historical facts of all times and ages, but also join 
our own minds and thoughts with those of men who lived and worked 
centuries before us. Hardly any branch of science is of greater inter- 
est in this respect than comparative geography, because wherever we 
turn we discover links which connect the development of our race with 
the changes on the surface of our planet. 

Dr. Schlichter is now engaged in studying the desiccation of parts of 
Africa, and he has, with great labor and research, drawn a series of 
se(;tions across that continent. The subjects, in physical geograithy, 
which offer themselves for the investigation of the student are, indeed, 
as numerous as they are fascinating. The juocess of denudation of

erosion atid of triiiisportatiou maybe .studied and compared; wliile, as 
Prof. Lapwortli lias pointed out, the agencies wliicli rule in tlie pro- 
cesses of ui)beaval and depression are still almost nntirely unknown to 
us. The professor's address, delivered at Edinburgh last year, on the 
crests and troughs which succeed each other on the earth's surface in 
endless sequence, of every gradation of size, of ever^^ degree of com- 
plex i I y, offers much nuitter for reflection to the student of geography. 
The geological fold, as described in Prof. Lapworth's address, should 
receive the attention of i)hysical geographers who can take advantage 
of their great opportunities as explorers and as students, by investi- 
g;iting\as well the simple fold, often under altered conditions caused 
by erosion, as the tangential pressures and other indueuces that have 
been at w^ork on it. Thus we should combine with geologists in work- 
ing out nature's problems while we study the earth's i)ast history in 
Older to understaud its present condition; for, although the limits 
between the sciences of geography and geology have been clearly 
detined, the diiference between our studies consists rather in our 
methods and objects than in the materials on which we work. We 
are therefore prepared to give a cordial welcome to Mr. Oldham's 
promised paper on the present condition of the surface of British India, 
as explained by its former geological history. 

If a competent acquaintance with geology is required for an accom- 
l)lished geograpliical explorer, a knowledge of biology is equally desira- 
ble. For instance, the study of the fauna of inland lakes and rivers 
has been pointed out by Darwin and Peschel as important in connec- 
tion with many problems in physical geogra[)hy. It is two thousand 
years ago since Eratosthenes, who presided over geographical science 
at Alexandria, drew scientittc conclusions from the fact that certain 
shells were found near the oasis of Jui)iter Ainmon. It was by the 
study of the fauna of large lakes in ISTorth America and in Asia that 
their marine origin was established, while we deduce the former exist- 
ence of lands now submerged from the comparison of fossil animals. 
Plants have acted an equally important part, both in effecting the 
condition of the earth's surface and in revealing to us its former his- 
t<ny. 

I anticipate that such investigations w'ill occujty some of our present 
and future students and explorers as they have occupied their prede- 
cessors; but they Avill, I trust, always bear in mind that the basis of 
all geographical work, if it is to be really valuable, is the fixing of 
l)ositions astronomically. Accuracy and reliability can alone make 
their work permanently useful. Much attention ought therefore to 
be given to the handling and adjustment of instruments and to their 
im])rovement.' Experience in the held often leads to suggestions which 
bear fruit when thej^ are carefully thought out. Thus there have been 
several forms of range-tinders invented in recent years which might be 
used in making rough surveys. Both Sir George Airy and Mr. Merri- 



416 THE PRESENT STANDPOINT OF GEOGRAPHY. 

field have introduced uew methods of computing' luuars, and ai method 
of semiazimuths, invented by a yachtsman, is now under discussion. 
Dr. Schlichter has recommended the use of an apparatus for photo- 
graphing moon and stars for hinars which is described in the Novem- 
ber number of our Jo«>-iirt/, and Col. IStewart invented another aj^jia- 
ratus for surveying by photography. Improvements are sure to sug- 
gest themselves to intelligent workers. Maj. Watkin has improved on 
the aneroid. Several attempts have been made to improve the arti- 
ficial horizon. Maj. Verner has invented a compass to be used for 
travelling at night. 

Photography now occupies an imi)ortant place in relation to- geog- 
raphy, and a photographic camera should form part of the equipment 
of all exi)lorers engaged in original geographical work. It is to be 
regretted that travellers have not taken more advantage of the facilities 
afforded by the society, as the use of an instrument should be thor- 
oughly mastered before a traveller i)roceeds on a journey. In pho- 
tometry it is necessary that objects represented on the plate should be 
clear and well-defined to facilitate the taking of measurements from 
them; and this has now become specially important since the invention 
of the new method of taking lunars. 

It is in the direction of the improvement of instruments, cameras, 
and other appliances used by the traveller, and of methods of observing 
and computing, that experienced and ingenious men should continue 
to turn their inventive faculties. Very often an Improvement occurs 
to an (jbservei while using an instrument in the field, which after- 
wards, by following up the train of thought, leads to the perfection of 
a practically useful invention. This has been the case from the days 
of Martin Behaim to those of Leigh Smith. 

Many of the rising generation of geographers, whose talents lie in 
that direction, Avill also, it is to be hoped, master the beautiful and 
most useful art of the cartographer, including the work of the compiler 
and of the draftsman. At present there are none too many in this 
country. When we reflect on the exquisite specimens of Italian and 
Catalan portolani which are preserved in the British Museum, and on 
the great geographical interest attaching to early examples of cartog- 
raphy, it is impossible not to regret that we are unable to produce an 
atlas such as the Berlin Geographical Society brought out last year. 
There are as yet no adequate opportunities in this country for devel- 
oping the latent powers of the potential Kretschmers who doubtless 
exist among our young English geographers, but I trust that every 
encouragement will be given to those who, in the future, give their 
attention to this branch of our work. 

Turning once more to the qualifications of an explorer, Mr. Galton 
has suggested to me that the art of geographical description is a very 
needful one. It is seldom that a country resembles what the visitor 
has been led to expect from reading recent descriptions of it. It is not 



THE PRESENT STANDPOINT OF GEOGRAPHY. 417 

the so-called ''word ])aiiitiiij;-,"' now so elaborately employed, that con- 
veys the most correct x^ietare; but rather pithy epithets and sharp, 
clear touches. The (>kl writers were often excellent in doing tliis, with 
their forcible homely language; and they slxmld be read until some 
echo of their pure vigorous style has been caught. The necessity 
for cultivating the describing faculty, and for studying the general 
principles underlying all good description should be inculcated by 
those who train men as geographical explorers; for a traveller is of no 
use if, when he comes back, he fails to convey to others a correct idea 
of what lie lias seen. 

The various subjects to which a geographical student or explorer can 
give his attention are as fascinating as they are numerous; and w^hether 
he devotes his talents to the improvement of instruments, or to the 
work of the draftsman and map-maker, or to the manifold i)hases of 
physical geography, or to discovery in distant lands, or to the elucida- 
tion and illustration of the history and progress of our science, he will 
alike be furthering and advancing our objects and will have a right to 
claim our assistance and our sympathy. 

We do not invite geographers to enter upon any of these difficult 
undertakings vtithout being i)rei3ared to supply them with a suitable 
training, and to give them all the sympathy and encouragement in our 
power. This was not always the case. 1 well remember that a young 
officer in command of the llausa police force came to me for advice, 
just twenty years ago. lie wanted to learn the use of the sextant and 
artificial horizon. At first 1 had no answer to give him: but afterward 
1 found out that a widow named Janet Taylor gave the required instruc- 
tion in the Minories to mates of merchant ships. It was this dearth of 
the means of learning the work of an explorer that forced my attention 
on the duty of finding a remedy. Mrs. Taylor was an efficient teacher, 
I believe, but the Minories are far off, and her single efforts could not 
supply what was needed. It M^as then tliat 1 submitted proposals that 
the society should appoint an instructor and furnish the necessary facil- 
ities for enabling explorers to learn their work. Our council saw the 
importance of supplying a great need, and Mr. Coles was appointed to 
instruct intending travelers in practical astronomy and surveying. My 
proposal included instruction in geology and biology, and now arrange 
meuts are made for teaching what an explorer would need in these 
branclies of knowledge also, as well as in photography. 1 look upon this 
as the most successful measure that has been ado^ited by this societj^ in 
recent years and the one which bas done most to advance the interests 
of geography. Since Mr. Coles began to giye instruction in surveying 
and nautical astronomy, lie has taught 230 pupils, including officers in 
the army and navy, in the consular ancwolonial services, missionaries, 
civil engineers, and private travellers. These instructed explorers have 
done valuable geographical work in all parts of the world — in Africa, 
Asia, North and South America, the Malay Archipelago and Pacific

Islands, and in the Arctic regions. Of tlie 239 pnpils, 20 have studied 
photography, 18 botany, and 40 geology, in addition to surveying and 
nautical astronomy. It is of the utmost imjiortance that explorers 
should be thoroughly trained for their work, and their instruction is 
consequently one of the most indispensable duties of our society. 

In this imperfect survey of our geographical desiderata I have endeav- 
ored to draw the attention of my associates, not only to the extent of 
unknown country to be discovered and explored, and to the numerous 
j)roblems and questions of interest which await solution, but also to 
the duty that is laid upon us — each one of us — to take his share of the 
task, some by useful advice and co-operation, some by encouragement, 
all by a hearty determination to work together for one great end — the 
usefulness and prosperity of our society. 



HOW MAPS ARE MADE.* 



By W, B. Blakie. 



The subject on wliicli I am deputed to address you to-uight is wliat, 
ill the slaug of the day, may be described as "a very hirge order." 
Tiiough the title seems simple euough, the subject itself is so large and 
it spreads and ramifies itself through so many arts and sciences, that 
the temptation to go off from tlie distinct line of my subject into the 
different branches that introduce tliemselves is great, and all these 
branches are to me so interesting, that 1 have found great difficulty in 
confining myself strictly to the story of how a map is made, I have 
forced myself, however, to stay on tlie center line of map-making, and 
i hope, before the evening is over, to give you a clear and distinct idea 
of the principles on which a map is made, for the subject of my paper 
is not "How maps are drawn," but "How maps are made;" and I 
will attempt to show you the naked machinery of the process. 

I have often been amazed at the popular ignorance of what would 
seem to be the very first principles of geography and of map-making, 
and this has induced me to begin at the very A B C of the subject. 1 
intend throughout this paper to avoid technical phrases and mathe- 
matical terms. I have nothing new to tell you; much that 1 am about 
to say is known to every j)erson here present, and I ask you to bear 
with me if occasionally I seem childish in my descriptions. 

One thing more I should like to premise, and that is, that in this 
paper I do not propose to go into any great detail, or to confuse any- 
one here with the numberless scientific corrections and modifi.catious 
that have to be made in all scientific calculations. 1 will speak only 
on general principles; those who know the science thoroughly will 
understand the modifications necessary, while those who have not the 
same advantage will, I trust, be able to grasp the principles of what is 
shown. 

My intention tonight is to show (1) how a spectator finds his position 
on the earth's surface; (2) how he defines and records that position; 
(3) how he makes a map from the information he has found; (4) how he 
fills up the details of that map; and (5) briefly to describe how the map

420 HOW MAPS ARE MADE. 

SO made is drawn and printed, and incidentally to sliow the use of the 
various tools and instruments employed in these o[)erations, 

I assume that we all know that the earth is (roughly speaking) a 
sphere, spinning round on its axis once in twenty-four hours. Now, if 
we take up a sphere, like this ball, and mark a spot on it, there is noth 
iiig whatever to define its position; no north, no south; nothing to 
guule us. One ])0int on this si»here is the same as any other point, 
until we liud some reference spot to measure from; but we have assumed 
that we know that the earth spins round on its axis, and here we at 
once discover something we can measure from. The ends of the axis 
of the ball, which we call the poles, are, we see, at rest compared with 
the rest of tlie surface of the si)inning ball. 

Now, this so-called polarity gives us at once two points of reference. 
Although no one has ever been at either of the poles, the study of the 
subject for hundreds of years has jiroNcd their existence as surely as if 
the poles had been visited and been discovered marked with upstand- 
ing posts. Between these two points, which we call the poles, L can 
mark a point half-way, which, by spinning the ball in contact with the 
pencil, I convert into a line called the equator, the equal divider, 
popularly theWue. You will observe that this middle line, this eijuator, 
is also the largest possible circle on this sphere, and it is from this circle 
that all measurements and references north and south are made. We * 
see on the globe and ou maps a number of other circles parallel to the 
equator to the north and south of it, and drawn at equal distances. 
These are called the parallels of latitude (or wideness), and they mark 
certain degrees of angular divergence from the equator. 

Consider for a moment what this means. In the tirst conception of 
them these lines have no sped tic distance apart, because they really 
are angular measurements, and it is this conception of them I wish to 
get h(»ld of. A degree of Uititude is not necessarily a number of miles, 
and until we know the actual diameter of the earth we can not tell what 
the length of a degree is. It is a proportion of the circumference of a 
circle, a fractional measurement of it. We may speak of a half, a quar- 
ter, of anything, but, until we say what it is a half or a quarter of, the 
phrase conveys no idea of magnitude. It might be half a mile, or half 
a kingdom, or half an inch, or half a crown. Similarly, a degree of a 
circle means nothing so far as length is concerned, until you know the 
size of the circle, when you can at once calculate, with the proper 
mathematical knowledge, the numerical value of a degree at the earth's 
circumference. 

Now, having marked these lines on the surface of the earth, we have 
certain marks on our globe to which we can refer any and every point. 
It may be said, " Why mark these lines on the map? They do not 
exist; they are only imaginary." Quite true! But then the tirst prin- 
ciple of all map-making is to begin with imaginary lines, from which 
to measure the position of every place on that map; and all such imag- 



HOW MAPS ARE MADE 421 

inary lines ate carefully recorded, as we shall see later on, so that they 
can be accurately laid down at any moment by those who know how to 
find them. We find them a great convenience, an absolute necessity, 
indeed, so we leave them drawn on the globe. Imagine a street — any 
street will do, but for a good analogy imagine a street built, like Moray 
Place, in a circle. We can say, speaking of, say, a water plug, or any 
point in that street, that it is on the center line of the street, or the 
line of the lamp-posts, or so many feet to one side or either of these 
lines. There is no visibly marked center line or line of lamp-posts, but 
it can be filled up in a moment by human intelligence, and if there were 
to be frequent references to them these lines would be marked on apian 
for constant use. The parallels of latitude are similar lines drawn for 
convenience or reference. 

The circumference of the earth, like any other circle, is divisible into 
360 degrees, and we number the parallels by the number of degrees of 
angular divergence; only, instead of beginning at a pole and going 
right round, we, for convenience sake, begin at the equator and then 
number 90 degrees towards the North Pole and 00 degrees towards the 
South Pole, 

But one set of reference lines is not enough; we nuist have another 
set, and we get them in the meridians of longitude. We draw these 
through the poles at right angles to the equator. They are all " great 
circles;" that is, each circle is concentric with the globe. The equator 
being a circle, we divide it as before into o60 degrees, and the meridians 
through the i)oints of section from a second system of lines of reference. 
But, unlike the iiarallels of latitude, they are all the same size. One is 
the same as another. How are they to be numbered? Go back for a 
moment to Moray Place, and remember the Uuca we drew — the center 
of the street, and the line of the lamp-posts. How are we to define a 
spot on one of these lines? They are circular, and consequently have 
no beginning and no end. What we should do would be to mark a con- 
venient spot with a fiag, or a peg, or a stone, and say "That is the 
beginning; measure from that.'' 

This is exactly what we must do in longitude. We must mark a 
starting line on the earth, and call it zero; and as all nations have a 
free choice they have not chosen the same. We have chosen tlie meri- 
dian of Greenwich, the French that of Paris, the Americans Washing- 
ton, and the Eussians Pulkova and the Germans used to use Ferro; 
but for all English maps, and now for most foreign ones, the meridian 
of Greenwich is the starting line, the zero of longitude. 

The custom here again is not to reckon 360 degrees round the circle, 
but to reckon ISO degrees east and 180 degrees west. We saw that 
latitude was angular divergence from the equator; but what are these 
degrees of longitude? Look at a ball spinning round opposite a candle. 
We assumed a knowledge that the earth spun round its axis in twenty- 
four hours. Every part of it comes in turn opposite a heavenly body 



422 HOW MAPS ARE MADE. 

(say the sun) once in twenty-four hours, just as every part of this ball 
comes opposite the candle once in each revolutiou. Longitude is, tlien, 
angular divergence measured by the difference of time in coming oppo- 
site a heavenly body. As the circle is divisible into .300 degrees, so the 
day,?, e., the revolution of the earth, is divisibkMuto twenty-four hours, 
and one hour of longitude is consequently equal to 15 degrees. In 
maps longitude is marked in degrees, while in almanacs the elements 
given to reckon it are always written in hours, minutes, and secoiuls. 

Remember once more, that these degrees are not. lengths measured 
on the surface, but are the record of angular divergence from the initial 
meridian. It is all the more necessary to bear this in mind, because 
the length on the surface of the earth of a degree of longitude varies 
enormously, being greatest at the equator and nothing at all at the 
pole, dift'ering thus from degrees of latitude, which, roughly speaking 
and for the purposes of this paper, may be considered equal. 

The idea that latitude and longitude are the measures of angular 
divergence and not absolute distance in miles or yards may be easily 
grasped by familiar illustration. If you can imagine two travellers leav- 
ing Italy by road, the one over the St. (iothard pass and the other 
over Mount Cenis, and two other travellers following them by rail at 
such an interval of time that they are in the railway tunnels at exactly 
the same moment that the pedestrians attain the summits of the 
passes; the pedestrians on the mountain and the railway traveller in 
the tunnel of the St. Gothard pass will be in exactly the same latitude 
and longitude, and so will the travellers by the Mount Cenis routes. 
The pedestrians however will be about 00 yards fiirther apart from 
each other than the railway travellers. The reason of this of course is 
that the pedestrians are forther away from the earth's center, but their 
angular divergence from the ecjuator and the earth's axis are precisely 
the same, whether they are on the mountain or in the tunnel 5,000 
feet below. 

Now, having defined latitude and h)ngitudeand shown how the lines 
representing them are drawn, we must see how in practice the surveyor 
finds the latitude and longitude of a place, and thereby begins his map. 
The poles, as we saw, are first points to measure from, and the eijuator 
the half-way line. It is evident he can not measure directly a line from 
pole to pole, find out the half and call it the equator, and leave pegs at 
each i)arallel in passing. He nuist look to things outside the earth 
itself from which to reckon, and he gets such reference points in the 
heavenly bodies. To his eye these are situated in the great vault of the 
heavens. He sees them as if on the surface of -a hollow globe continu- 
ally revolving around him, rising in the east till they reach their high- 
est point above him, called the culminating ])oint, then setting in the 
west. For thousands of years astronomers have studied these bodies, 
and fixed their api)arent i)Ositions in the celestial vault; and these 
positions are recorded with the utmost i)ossible accuracy in a book, 



HOW MAPS ARE MADE. 423 

compiled by Government, ealled the N((ntu'«l Almanac, and, from the 
practical information given there, the surveyor finds his position. He 
may take tlie sun or he nuiy take the stars, but the jiositions of the 
sun being affected by tlie motion of the earth round it, I proi)ose to 
take a star to illustrate my next rennirks, as its movements are simpler. 

The pole of the heavens is tlie end of the axis of the earth infinitely 
prolonged. The intersection of the plane of the equator with the celes- 
tial vault is called the equinoctial, and as the angular divergence on 
the surface of the earth is measured in degrees from the eipiator and 
called latitude, so the angular divergence of a heavenly body from the 
equinoctial is called its <lecliiiatio)i. As the angular divergence from 
the meridian of Greenwich was called longitude, so the divergence in 
time from a starting i)oint in the heavens is called right ascension. We 
had to fix arbitrarily the meridian of Greenwich as a starting" line on 
the earth. We have also to fix equally arbitrarily a starting i)oint in 
the heavens, and that i^oint may be most simply described as the 
point In the heavens in which the sun is in spring, when the day and 
night are equal. 

The latitude of any place on the earth's crust is equal to the altitude 
of the celestial pole. You can see this in a moment if you imagine 
yourself on the equator and look to the pole, marked, say, by the Pole 
Star. You will see it on the horizon and of no altitude at all; and at 
the equator you have no lat tude, or it is called zero; but, as you 
approach the pole, the Pole Star will gradually appear to rise higher 
and higher until when you reach the ISTorth Pole it will be directly over 
your head, and consequently at right angles to, or 90 degrees from the 
horizon, and your latitude is then also 90 degrees. But thougli the 
Pole Star is very near the Xorth Pole, it does not actualy coincide 
with it, and we must find some other way of finding our latitude accu- 
rately. We get this by taking the altitude of any known star in vari- 
ous ways. I Avill explain the sinqjlest method, of which all others are 
only slight modifications : 

(1) Measure the meridian altitude of the star — that is, its highest alti- 
tude above the horizon. 

(2) Deduct that altitude from 90 degrees, which gives its zetiith dis- 
tance, or the angular distance from a j)oint exactly over your head. 

(3) Add (or substract) the declination of the star (found in the Nau- 
tical Almanac) to the zenith distance, and the result is your latitude. 

I have here a diagram showing how the latitude of Edinburgh would 
be found from the bright star Arcturus, which " culminates," or reaches 
its highest altitude, on our meridian a few minutes before 12 to-night. 

1 measure first its altitude, which 1 find is 54 degrees. Deducting 
that from 90 degress gives its zenith distance = 36 degrees; to that I 
add its declination, which I find from the almanac is 20 degrees, and 
the result is 50 degrees ^ the latitude of Edinburgh. 

Longitude is a more difficult matter, and 1 have no time to go into 
it anything like fully. You will find a beautiful description of it in

Hcrscher.s Astronomy, tlie best by far of all ])()i)nlar books on the sub- 
ject. While hititnde is absolute, longitude, being- diiferenee in time, 
is relative, for there is no such thing as absolute time; and noon at 
any place is merely the moment when the snn culminates on the me- 
ridian. If the observer has a ch)ck whose going he can depend on, 
and he sets it to, and keeps it always at, Greenwich time, he knows 
from that clock or chronometer Avhat time it is at Greenwich when any 
star comes to the meridian. If then he can observe any astronomical 
phenomenon, such as the meridi;ni passage of a star, he has only to 
observe the difference of the times recorded on the clock set to Green- 
wich time and on his local clock, and the difference is the longitude in 
time. This is the principle on which longitudes are taken at sea, 
where chronometers can be kept undisturbed, but for explorers on land 
it is more difficult. 

The moon, however, is a natural clock, very complicated, but still 
readable to the initiated.* It is continually moving through the stars, 
and its angular distance from prominent stars is carefully computed 
for Greenwich, and recorded in the Nautical Almanac for every hour in 
the year. The observer then iinding the nmoirs position by observa- 
tion, and recording its local time, can find in the Nautical Almanac 
when it had the same position at Greenwich, and the difference of the 
times is the measure of the longitude. 

In old days, when ships met, the first (juestion was, Who are you? 
the next, What's your longitude ? The invention of the chronometer 
by Harrison one hundred and twenty years ago has however for sail- 
ors at least, vastly simplified the finding of longitude at sea: and I find 
from inquiry among sailors, that "lunars" are practically a lost art. 
In illustration, I may state that I find from the Nantical Almanac tliat 
Arcturus comes to the meridian of Greenwich at 11:37 to-night. If I 
have a clock or chronometer marking true Greenwich time, I shall find 
that this star will come to our meridian at twelve minutes and forty 
seconds later; the difference of longitude in time is therefore twelve 
nunutes and forty seconds, which, converted into angular measure- 
ment, is .") degrees lOA minutes, the longitude (west) of Edinburgh. 

Note here that at stations differing only in latitude the same star 
comes to the meridian at the same time, but at different altitudes. At 
stations differing only in longitude it comes to the meridian at the 
same altitude, but at different times. The instrument generally used 
for taking altitudes is the sextant.t At sea, where we have a visible

horizon — the line where the sea meets the sky — we measure altitudes 
from this horizon ; but on land we have no true horizon, and then we 
use, what is more accurate, an artificial horizon, which is a cui) of 
mercury in which the heavenly body is reflected. Measure the angle 
between the real body in the sky and its reflection in the mercury, and 
half the angle is the true altitude. 

Projection. — Having discovered our position on the sarl'ace of the 
globe, we come to the representation of it on a flat sheet or map. 

The Latiu dictionary tells us that '-mappa" is a sheet or napkin. 
iS^ow, the surface of the globe is curved, and in vi map we have only a 
flat surface to represent it on, and we shall for a short while study how, 
as it is the basis of all map-drawing. The conventional representation 
on a flat surface of the curved surface of the earth is called projection, 
because in its fundamental idea it is a i)i«'ture of the globe projected or 
thrown forward from the eye on to a flat sheet; but this idea of it is so 
confusing to the mind unaccustomed to think out such things that, 
although it is the invariable way of describing it in all text books, I 
have preferred to show you three forms of projection without assuming 
any ideal throwing of the rays on to planes. 

The first I show is the modified sttreographic or equi-globular i^ro- 
jection (Plate xxii), invented by Philip de la Ilire about the e)id of the 
seventeenth century. A simple way of investigating this projection is 
to fit an iron ring over the center of the globe, and stretch tightly, from 
the North Pole to the South, India rubber bands that coincide with the 
meridians of longitude on the globe, fastening them firmly to the ring 
at the polos. Similarly stretch India-rubber bands over the parallels of 
latitude, fastening them to the iron ring and to the meridians where 
they cross. While the ring is kept on the globe these India-rubber 
bands show the parallels and the meridians on the sphere. When the 
ring is lifted off the globe the India-i ubber shrinks to a plane and shows 
exactly the lines of the stereographic projection. This is the proj<^ctioii 
used in all atlases for the world in hemispheres, for continents, and for 
large surfaces. It gives, indeed, a notion of rotundity and a general 
idea of projection, but the central portions are shrunk in, and the edges 
are distorted. 

The next projecti(^u to be studied is Mercator's. Mercator was a 
Fleming who lived in the sixteenth century. He was almost an exact 
contemporary of John Knox, He was a writer on theology and geog- 
raphy. His real name was Gerard Kremer, which name, meaning mer- 
chant, he Latinized, in accordance with the custom of the day, iuto 
Mercator. 

His invention is very clever. The ccmstruction of it is a little com- 
plicated, and is generally shirked in text books, but the actual idea is 
very simple, and I have here designed a piece of apparatus to illustrate 
exactly what I believe Mercator did wlien he evolved his system. 



426 HOW MAPS AIJE MADE. 

Tliougli I liave ii<» direct evidence to sliow how Mercator argued out 
lii.s system, I liave not the least doubt that it was somewhat thus: 

Mercator was a globe-maker, and no doubt worked from the globe. 
He stripped his gores off the globe, forjning a map like this (Plate xxi, 
fig. 1), wliicli was naturally very inconvenient, owing to the hiatuses 
between the meridians. ITe was obliged to join the gores along their 
meridians (Plate xxi, tig. 2). He then found that he had distorted every- 
thing, and the distortion increased in the higher latitudes, owing to the 
gores being further apart towards the top of the map. In order to 
restore a balance of orientation (or the relative position and direction 
of places), as he had distorted in longitude, so lie had exactly in pro- 
portion to distort in latitude, as shown in Plate xxi, fig. 3, a complete 
Mereator's map of half the Northern Hemisphere, in which you Avill 
observe that the jiarallels are farther and farther apart as the latitude 
gets higher. / 

As these gores are not a familiar shape, I have a square here which 
will catch the eye at once (Plate xxi, fig. 1^/). I distort it first by pull- 
ing it out horizontally as Mercator did in joining the meridians, and 
it ceases to be a square and the orientation is changed (Plate xxi, fig. 
2a). I then distort it in height in the same proportion, and it becomes 
once more asquare with tlie true orientation but larger than the original 
square (Plate xxi, tig. 3a). This is exactly what we did before with the 
gores of the globe. 

Every parallel, in Mereator's projection, is a straight line, and every 
meridian is also a straight line. We have, th«Mj, an excellent sailing 
line from point to point. As Sir George Grove puts it very neatly 
(though he shirks the explanation of the iH'OJection), " The most ignor- 
ant sailor can lay down his course without calculation. In fact, the 
invention of this map has been justly called one of the most remarka- 
ble and useful events of the sixteenth century; because it enables com- 
mon, unlearned peoi)le to do easily and correctly what only clever, 
learned people could have done without it." 

Mereator's j)ro)ection is that used in all nautical charts to this day, 
because to the sailor it is far more important to know his direction or 
course than his distance, which with ordinary nautical knowledge, or 
from nautical tables made for him, he can easily calculate, but he needs 
to see his course. 

In the conical projection (Plate xxii, fig. o) we imagine a cone of paper 
to be rolled round tlie globe, touching it on the middle line of the map. 
jSTear their line of contact the map coincides very nearly with the globe 
surface, and is fairly accurate; but as it gets farther away from the 
touching point the distortion grows, the places being shown larger than 
in reality. For comparatively small areas, such as for maps of p]ng- 
land and France, it is fairly accurate, aiul is the i)r(>jection used in 
atlases. 

In the illustrations (Plates xxi, xxii) we see the same globe projected

on the same scale, but with very different i)roi)ortious. These three 
projectious are typical ones and the most conimonly used, but there are 
many others. For tbose desirous of studying- the subject the best 
work on it I know is the article by 3Ir. Taylor, in the flune number of 
the Scottish Geofjrnjjhical Mayuzine of 181)0, and to that article I refer 
til em. 

Map-making. — We have now seen how the traveller finds liis place 
on the globe's surface, and how, wlien found, he can project or map tliat 
information on a Hat sheet. We shall now see how a map will grow. 
Imagine a slup sailing into unexplored seas and coming- to some 
land, say an island. The navigator at once fixes his position in the 
ship in latitude and longtitude. The navigator's instruments are the 
sextant, the chronometer, and the mariner's compass. The general 
idea of the mariner's compass is that it always points to the north; 
but accurately this is not so. The general direction of the compass, or 
the magnetic pole, is not the true north, but a spot very considerably 
to the west of it, and, in fact, shifts continually; not only in different 
places, but even in the same place, the direction changes from time to 
time, as there are many local causes of disturbance. The navigator, 
then, to fix true north, must find his meridian — that is, he must 
observe the direction of a star or the sun when it culminates or comes 
to the meridian, and from this observation he computes the amount of 
local variation of the compass. In practice it is not the moment of 
culmination he actually observes, but the statement is accurate enough 
for the i»urpose of this popular description. Knowing the variation of 
the compass, he can then take accurate bearings or directions to any 
feature he desires to record. Two or more such bearings to (say) a 
mountain, crossing each other from different known places, fix its posi- 
tion on the map. 

The navigator. — We can now show how a country is mapped. Sup- 
pose a ship visits this island, and fixes, by the ways already indicated, 
a few latitudes and longitudes, and sails round it, fixing here and there 
points on the coast, and perhaps taking bearings of some mountain, 
then the island would be represented in an atlas with several points 
fixed and joined by dotted lines. Nautical surveying is always done 
with the sextant, which measures both vertical angles and horizontal. 

Explorer. — Following in the wake of the sailor comes the explorer. I 
had intended, when I first sketched out this paper, to give an imaginary 
explorer's map of a journey across this island, but I have the privilege 
of showing you something so infinitely precious that I feel it would be 
a piece of bathos to concoct a sham map. Here I have two of Dr. Liv- 
ingstone's own original manuscrijit maps, made on his last journey, 
kindly lent me for to-night by his daughter, Mrs. A. L. Bruce. Here 
we have no conjectures as to what the traveller might do; here are the 
real power, the actual materials of geography. Instead of imagining 
what an explorer should take with liim, I mav mention Livingstone's 



428 , HOW MAPS ARE MADE. 

actual equipment: A 6-incli sextant, an aitificial liorizon, a pocket 
cliiouonieter, a prismatic comi)ass, and a i)Ocket compass; two boiling- 
point tliermometers and twocommon tbei monietersj aneroid barometer, 
a Xdiitical Almanac, and a book of matliematica] tables, 

Tlie sextant, as we lia^ e seen, is for taking astronomical as Mell as 
terrestrial angles; the thermometer and barometer for taking heights. 
The principle on which the latter are calculated is the pressure of the 
atmosphere. Tlie aneroid everybody knows; the boiling-point ther 
mometer is considered better and more accurate, though 1 observe from 
Livingstone's notes, who was the most painstaking and thorough ob- 
server, and who always observed Avith both, that there was little prac- 
tical dift'erence in the readings. Roughly sjteaking, water boils atsea- 
level at 212oF., and the barometer stands at 30 inches, Avhile at 5,000 
leet altitude water boils at 202'Go, and the barometer falls to 24-7 
inches. 

The traveller in unexplored parts generally estimates his distances 
from the time taken at the average rate of marching, just as on board 
sliip <listances covered are roughly taken from the average rate of the 
ship indicated by the log. He takes compass bearings as he goes, and 
keeps an itinerary, recording all useful information gathered on the 
march. He corrects Lis reckoning by taking daily latitudes, and at 
greater intervals, say once a fortnight, longitudes from moon observa- 
tions if he can. He notes heights, gets reports from natives of esti 
mated distances, and in fact gathers all the information he can on every 
subject — rain-fall, botany, zoology, antliropology, and so forth. Living- 
stone did all these, and did them thoroughly. A whole lecture could 
be written on these maps I hold in my hand. Here is one ot his notes: 

"Eight days uj) this river 90 miles, then cross and go three days, say 
3G miles, to stone houses 132 miles — course southwest Lobula, comes to 
northeast, has dark water." 

A traveller with his wits about him can do much with very rough 
instruments, or even with none ar all. He can train himself to use his 
fingers for rough angular measurements, and he can improvise in many 
ways. My own old chief, the late Col. W. B. Holmes, E. E., used to 
make wonderful surveys with his watch alone. 

One great geographical i)roblem — where does the huge river Sangpo, 
which flows in Tibet at the back of the Himalaya , discliarge its waters ? — 
was solved by a native surveyor, A. K., sent out by the Government of 
India, who was obliged to conceal all his observations. I quote from 
the ofticial account: 

"For linear measurement A. K. trusted entirely to his own pace or 
step, which, as hereafter shown, is conveitible into the unit of a foot, 
or any other unit desired; and notwithstanding that in Mongolia he was 
looked down upon as a particularly inferior individual, because, unlike 
the Mongols, he ])ersisted in walking instead of following the universal 
custom of the country, which enjoins riding a horse on all i>ossible occa- 
sions, he yet manfully strode along his travels, pleading poverty, or

otherwise, until at last, on Lis return journey along the eastern flank of 
his route, the Lama with whom he had taken service insisted on his 
riding, if only to promote flight from robbers, especially the mounted 
bands of Chiamo-Goloks, of whom travellers are in constant dread. 
Thus compelled, A. K. mounted a horse, but here also he proved e(|ual 
to the occasion, for he at once set to work counting tlie beast's paces as 
indicated by his stepping with the riglit foreleg. In this way he reck- 
oned his distances for nearly 2'o0 nnlcs, between BarongChaidani (lati- 
tude oG-^ 5', longitude 07^ ;V), and Thudcu Gomba (h'ltitnde 3;p 17'^ 
longitude OC^ 43'), and the results do credit alike to the explorer's 
ingenuity and to the horse's eipiability of pace." 

An account of his Journey will be found in the Scotti.sh Geographical 
Magazine for 1885, p. 352. 

After the explorer comes the surveyor. His business is to produce a 
detailed survey or map of the country. The operations of a cadastral* 
survey on a grand scale, generally made by the Government, are divided 
into two parts: (1) the great triangular survey, and (2) the top(>grai)h- 
ical part, or the filling in of the details required for civil information. 

Before we go furtlier we should gain a thorough idea of tlie]»rinciples 
of triangulation, because on it are founded all the conditions of an accu- 
rate map. The great i)roperty of a triangle is this, that of all plane 
geometrical figures it is the only one of which the form can not be 
altered if the sides remain constant, and that the three angles of a tri- 
angle are together equal to two right angles, so that if we know two of 
the angles of any triangle we can at once calculate the third angle by 
subtracting the number of degrees in the two known angles from 180 
degrees, which is the sum of two right angles. If also we know the 
length of one of the sides of the triangle as well as the number of 
degrees in the angles, a very simple mathematical formula enables us 
to calculate the length of the other sides. 

Now this is exactly what is done in the great trigonometrical survey 
made in this country hy the Ordnance Survey: The surveyor measures 
what is called a hase line. He puri)osely selects an absolutely horizon- 
tal plane otherwise conveiuently situated for the purpose of measure- 
ment. The base line is seldom more than 5 or G miles long, but it is 
measured with "every refinement which ingenuity can devise or ex[>ense 
command." In the Ordnance Survey of the British Isles — to give an 
idea of the care with which such base lines are measured-^the original 
base line, which wason Hounslow Heath, was measured in 1791, first with 
a steel chain, then v>'ith deal rods, next glass tubes, and lastly, again 
with the chain; and was over 5 miles long. Another line was subse- 
quently measured 7 miles long, on Salisbury Plain, in 1794, which is 
the base of the existing triangulation. The verification line at Lough 



*A cadastral survey is properly aud etymologically a survey by a .s^overnnient for 
fiscal purposes, the word being derived from the low Latin capitastrum, a register 
for a poll tax. As such a survey was naturally carried out with the utmost com- 
pleteness, the term "Cadastral Survey" came to be used equally with the term 
" Ordnauce Survey" for the great Government survey of Great Britain aud Ireland, 



430 HOW MAPS ARE MADE. 

Foyle, wliicli was 7 miles long, was measured with specially designed 
compound metal rods of brass and iron, 10 feet long, compensating like 
the balance and spring of a clironometer, so as to be independent of 
expansion and contraction, and their contact a<ljusted with microscopes. 
From this base once fixed, its latitude and longitude being most care- 
fully taken, the surveyor measures the angles of suitably laid out tri- 
angles, ami computes the length of their sides. p]ach of these sides 
in its turn becomes the base of a new triangle. The surveyor plants 
his instrument on the spot fixed on and measures new triaugles, and 
gradually covers the surface of his island with a net^^ork of great 
triangles. The length of these sides are all calculated from the angles 
not measured, but, as a matter of fact, the lengths of these sides so 
computed from angular measurements are infinitely more accurate than 
if they were actually measured with a chain. 

So accurate, indeed, was thetriangulation of this country that when 
the ordnance surveys verified their calculations thirty-three years after, 
in 1827, by actually measuring the check base on Lough Foyle, as already 
described, the greatest possible error was found to be less than 5 
inches. This, be it remembered, was calculated from the base in Salis- 
bury Plain, on\y 7 miles long, at a distance of over 300 miles. The 
mean length of the sides of the triangles was 35 miles, and the longest 
side was 111 miles. The history of the triangulation is quite a romance, 
but Sir Charles Wilson referred to all this at length last month.* 

The instrument with which the angles are measured is the theodolite. 
This network of triangles so laid down is the backbone of all details of 
map-making. All these imaginary sides of triangles are, like the par- 
allels of latitudes and meridians on large maps, the lines to which all 
filling in of detail is referred. Every point on this network is abso- 
lutely fixed, and from these points, as from the line of lamp-posts we 
considered at the beginning, all details are measured. The great trian- 
gulation in the Ordnance Survey being complete, the officers then lay 
off from the great triangles what are called secondary triangles, the 
sides of which are about 5 miles in length, and where necessary, ter- 
tiary triangles, with sides of about 1 inile in length, and from them the 
surveyor breaks up the interior of the triangle with a network of cross 
lines, all self-checking when laid on the paper, and this is the begin- 
ning of ordinary land survey. 

Land siirrei/inf/. — The filling in of a survey is like writing a book. 
Men work differently. No two surveyors use exactly the same method 
of working, and it very much depends on the nature of the ground, the 
extent of his resources, and the accuracy of detail required what method 
the surveyor employs. In a theoretically jierfect survey the triangular 
system would be pursued throughout, but in practice this is not neces- 
sary, nor is it done.

account of the operations of the Ordnance Survey will be found in The Ordnance 
Survey of the United Kingdom, l>y Lieut. C:ol. T. P. White, R. E. (Blackwood, 1886.) 



HOW MAPS ARE MADE. 431 

Of the methods of filling- up. wliich are several, I Mill briefly describe 
two or three of the principal: 

Trdfcrslno irith the chain and throdolitc. — A traverse is detiued as a 
ciicnitons route performed ou leaving any place on the earth's surface 
by stages in different directions and of various lengths with a view of 
arriving at any other place. The angles which the stages (or station 
lines) form with the meridian (/. c, tlie north and south line) are called 
bearings. In other words, it is a walking from point to point in 
straight lines, always recording your distance and ycnir direction. 

These traverse lines are measured with the chain. They are gener- 
ally laid out round the country to be surveyed, and are as multifarious 
as the necessities of the ground require. The bearings in a good per- 
manent survey are measured m ith the theodolite, and when the traverse 
is complete it should be ch>sed where begun, when, if no error is made, 
the bearing of the first line will read on the theodolite exactly as it 
read in the beginning. Cross checks and connecting lines are con- 
stantly taken to test the accuracy of the work, and while the survey is 
going on the measurements of all the features of the country are set 
down in what is called the field book. Where the line does not cross 
the natural features perpendiculars, called offsets, are set off and meas- 
ured from the traverse line to the bends and angles of all surface details, 
bends of streams, fences, houses, roads, and so on, and so the map gets 
filled in bit by bit, P^ither it is set off at the beginning from the ord- 
nance triangulation or subsequently joined to it by trigonometrical 
measurements. Such detail may be made piecemeal and fitted in like 
a Chinese puzzle to the main map of the country and altered or more 
minutely surveyed, according to requirements. For rapid and not very 
accurate purposes exactly the same methods may be adopted as for a 
military reconnoissance or sketch map by pacing the traverse lines and 
taking the bearings with the prismatic compass, and this is what is gen- 
erally done in military sketches. All these operations and measure- 
ments are noted in a field book and are afterwards taken to the office 
and "plotted" on a sheet or sheets of paper. 

There is also a contrivance for filling in a survey, with which no 
field book is used, but by which very fairly accurate work may be 
obtained. It is very little used in this country except for military pur- 
poses, and then generally in a modified form shortly to be noticed; but 
it is much used for topographical work in India and on the continent 
and the United States. This instrument is the jj^rw^ table. It serves 
itself as a theodolite, and the plan actually grows on the ground with- 
out after office work. 

Contour Hues. — A very important part of cadastral survey is the 
plotting on the map of contour lines, or lines of equal height. This is 
done after the features of the surface have been mapped. To draw the 
contour lines we must have a starting point, or, as it is called, a datum 
level. In our Ordnance Survey this is the level of the mean tide at 
Liverpool. 



432 HOW MAPS ARE MADE. 

From the datuui great lines and cross lines of levels are rnu all over 
tlio CDuntry, covering" it with a network; and at all convenient spots 
the heights are permanently recorded by the well known broad arrow, 
and called bench marks. Wherever the broad arrow is fonnd engraved 
on the gronnd its height from the datnm line will be fonnd in tlie ord- 
nance map of that part of the gronnd. A very common spot to find an 
ordnance bench mark is the keystone of the arch of a bridge, which 
wonld naturally be the last thing to be removed. These levels are got 
by spirit levelling. Wiien the main levelling operations have been 
completed the surveyor fixes at what intervals of height his contours 
are to be drawn. 

The surveyor starts, let us say, to determine the line at 100 feet 
above datum. He goes to the nearest bench mark he has to this height, 
say it is 105 feet. He levels down until i;e finds a point 5 feet below 
this bench mark. There he leaves a flag or a peg and goes on finding 
point after point at the same level; that is, he must read the same 
figure on the leveling staff. These j)olnts he then surveys as he would 
any natural feature, and permanently marks the imaginary lines join- 
ing them on the map, thereby showing a line of equal heights. 

Military sketch or reconnoissance is a form of map which ought not to 
pass entirely undescribed. The object of a staft officer in making a 
sketch is to give such a representation of the nature of the ground as 
will give useful information to his general. It may take any amount of 
elaboration, may be as complete as a cadastral survey taken with 
instruments of precision, or it may be merely the roughest indication 
of the nature of the ground, taken with such instruments as may be 
carried in the pocket, or even imi)r()vised without instruments, and be 
a mere eye sketch of the features of the ground. A s the military infor- 
nmtion generally desired is the nature of the ground, whether suitable 
for maneuvering, for artillery, for cavalry, the nature of the roads, of 
the hills, of the rivers, should all be looked to, and rough (contouring 
and hill shading is a very important part of the officer's work. He 
must also get information of defensible spots, of the water supplies, 
the food supplies, and the resources of the country, and this should be 
modified as much as possible on the i^lanor on the report attached to it. 

Though any degree of elaborateness may be used, any instruments of 
l)recision employed, the typical military sketch is nuide with a sketch- 
ing case, which is merely an improvised plane table. The nmin lines 
or traverses are taken from the bearings of the j^rismatic compass laid 
down on the sketch itself. The lines are generally paced or guessed, 
distant objects fixed by bearings from the station i)oints, and the con- 
touring measured angularly by Abney\s level, or sketch by the eye. 
The shading of the hills shows steepness by the lines used to indicate 
them being drawn closer or farther apart. 

Cart(>(/r(q)]tey. — The plans and maps having been drawn, and all 
notes made of information, tliey reach the cartographer or atlas-maker. 
His duty is first to compare all new iiit'or unit ion. with Mliat is (ilready

known; to eliniinate manifest errors, to reduce to scale and to projec- 
tion uniform with his great maps of the same part of tlie world, and 
generally to make everything shipshape for publication. 

Atlas-maMng. — I do not here refer to the Ordnance Survey maps, 
drawings, and prints, which were described with the utmost detail and 
j)recision by Sir Charles Wilson, but to the general atlases, such as 
Johnston's and Bartholomew's. With the information so gleaned the 
cartographer is able to make those beautiful orographical ma|)S, which 
are now so common, showing different levels. 

In our diagram 1 have colored the island orographically, which is 
done by drawing the contour lines and washing over the areas so 
marked with different variations of tint. But I shall not go far into 
this subject. Imagine the map drawn. It may be then engraved, 
like any other picture or line engraving, on a copper plate, and either 
printed from that plate or from lithographic stones, to which an im- 
pression of the plate has been transferred. 

In the ( )rdnance Survey printing oftice, instead of lithographic stone, 
the maps are printed from sheets of zinc, which has much the same 
property of absorbing greasy ink. 

By this time we have got into the printing othce, and to describe it 
in detail would be beyond my province. This part of the subject though 
very interesting, really embraces the whole art of the engraver, the 
lithographer, and the printer. But there is one process I desire to 
show before closing. 

You see daily in books and newspapers, and in our own journal, maps 
printed in black along with the type. There are numberless processes 
for their production; one only I shall briefly note. It is in the type- 
process of Messrs. Walker »S: Boutall, who have kindly sent me a speci- 
men in course of manufacture. 

On a brass plate a coating of a waxy composition is laid; the outlines 
of the map are either drawn on this coating or photographically trans- 
ferred to it. The engraver then scratches through the wax down to 
the brass with a needle. He next takes suitable types and stamps in 
the names also down through the wax to the brass, and comi^letes the 
matrix with the necessary amount of detail, which may be great or 
little. After verification and correction the matrix is readj^ for electro- 
typing. You who know the appearance of stereotype molds will see 
that this resembles the mold of an ordinary stereotype or electrotype 
page. The mold is next covered with black lead and an electrotype 
taken from it, when all the punctures that have been made through the 
wax to the level brass plate come ont level — the scratches as lines and 
the type as lettering. It is then mounted on wood, and is ready to insert 
among type and be printed along with it. 

I have tried to give you very roughlj' an outline of how maps are 
made from the beginning to the end, in almost the same form that 
actual necessity forced me to learn it for practical use.

BIOLOGY IN RELATION TO OTHEPi NATURAL SCIENCES.* 



By J. S. Burdon-Sanderson, F. K. S. 



We tire assembled this evening- as representatives of the sciences — 
men and women wlio seek to advance knowledge by scientific methods. 
The common gronnd on which we stand is that of belief in the para- 
mount value of the end for which we are striving, of its inherent power 
to make men wiser, happier, and better; and our common purpose is to 
strengthen and encourage one another in our efforts for its attainment. 
We have come to learn what progress has been made in departments 
of knowledge which lie outside of our own special scientific interests 
and occupations, to widen our views, and to correct whatever miscon- 
ceptions may have arisen from the necessity which limits each of us 
to his own field of study; and, above all, we are here for the purpose 
of bringing our divided energies into eflectual and combined action. 

Probably few of the members of the association are fully aware of the 
influence which it has exercised during the last half century and more 
in furthering the scientific development of this country. Wide as is 
the range of its activity, there has been no great (piestion in the field 
of scientific inquiry which it has failed to discuss; no important line of 
investigation which it has not promoted; no great discovery which it 
has not welcomed. After more than sixty years of existence it still 
finds itself in the energy of middle life, looking back with satisfaction 
to what it has accomplished in its youth, and forward to an even more 
efficient future. One of the first of the national associations which 
exist in different countries for the advancement of science, its influence 
has been more felt than that of its successors, because it is more 
wanted. The wealthiest country in the world, which has profited more, 
vastly more, by science than any other, England stands alone in the 
discredit of refusing the necessary expenditure for its development, 
and cares not that other nations should reap the harvest for which her 
own sons have labored. 

It is surely our duty not to rest satisfied with the reflection that 
England in the past has accomplished so much, but rather to unite

and agitate in the confideiico of eveiituai success. It is not tlie fault 
of goverunients, but of the nation, tiiat tlie claims of science are not 
recognized. We have against us an overwhehnmg majority of the 
community, not merely of the ignorant, but of those Avho regard tliem- 
selves as educated, ^Yho vahie science only in so far as it can be turned 
into money; for we are still in great measure, in greater measure than 
any other, a nation of shop-keepers. Let ns who are of the minority — 
the remimnt who believe that truth is in itself of supreme value, and 
the knowledge of it of supreme utility — do all that we can to bring 
public opinion to our ,side, so that the century which has given Young, 
Faraday, Lyell, Darwin, Maxwell, and Thompson to England may, 
before it closes, see us prepared to take our part with other countries 
in combined action for the full development of natural knowledge. 

Last year the necessity of an imperial observatory for physical sci- 
ence was, as no doubt many are aware, the subject of a discussion in 
Section A, which derived its interest from the number of leading* physi- 
cists who took i)art in it, and especially from the presence and active 
particii)ation of the distinguished man who is at the head of the 
National Physical Laboratory at Berlin. The equally pressing neces- 
sity for a central institution for chemistry, on a scale commensurate 
with the practical importance of that science, has been insisted upon 
in this association and elsewhere by distinguished chemists. As 
regards biology, I shall have a word to say in the same direction this 
evening. Of these three requirements it may be that the first is the 
most pressing. If so, let us all, whatever branch of science we repre- 
sent, unite our efibrts to realize it, in the assurance that if once the 
claim of science to liberal public support is admitted the rest will 
follow. 

In selecting a subject on which to address you this evening, I have 
followed the example of my predecessors in limiting myself to matters 
more or less connected with my own scientific occupations, believing 
that in discussing what most interests myself I should have the best 
chance of interesting you. The circumstance that at the last meeting 
of the British Association in this town. Section D assumed for the first 
time the title which it has siiu-e held, that of the Section of Biology, 
suggested to me that I might take the word "biology" as my starting- 
point, giving you some account of its origin and first use, and of the 
relations which subsist between biology and other branches of natural 
science. 

OUKilN AND MEANING OE THE TERM " IJIOLOdY." 

The term "biology," which is now so familiar as comprising the sum 
of the knowledge which has as yet been acquired concerning living 
nature, was unknown until after the beginning of the present century. 
The term was first employed by Treviranus, who proposed to himself 
as a life-task the developmentof a new science, the aim of which should 



BIOLOGY IN RELATION TO OTHER NATURAL SCIENCES. 437 

be to .study tlie forms and phenoineiui of life, its ori,i;iu, and tlie condi- 
tions and laM s of its existence, and embodied ^iiat Mas known on tliese 
subjects in a book of seven volumes, wLicli lie entitled Biology, or the 
rhilosophy of Li v in y Nature. For its construction the material was 
very scanty, and was cbietly derived from the anatomists and physiolo- 
gists. For botanists were entirely occupied in completing the work 
which Liunanis had begun, and the scope of zoology was in like man- 
ner limited to the description and classification of animals. It was a 
new thing to regard the study of living nature as a science by itself, 
worthy to occupy ai)lace by the side of natural philosophj , and it was 
therefore necessary to vindicate its claim to such a position. Trevira- 
nus declined to found this claim on its useful applications to the arts 
of agriculture and medicine, considering that to regard any subject of 
study in relation to our bodily wants — in other words, to utility — was to 
narrow it, but dwelt rather on its value as a discipline and on its sur- 
passing interest. lie commends biology to his readers as a study which, 
above all others, " nourishes and ]uaintains the taste for simplicity and 
nobleness,- which affords to the intellect ever new material for reflec- 
tion, and to the imagination an inexhaustible source of attractive 
images." 

Being himself a mathematician as well as a naturalist, he approaches 
the subject both from the side- of natural philosophy and from that of 
natural history, and desires to found the new science on the funda- 
mental distinction between living and non-living materials. In discuss- 
ing this distinction, he takes as his point of departure the constancy 
with which the activities which manifest themselves in the universe are 
balanced, emphasizing the impossibility of excluding from that balance 
the vital activities of plants and animals. The difference between vital 
and physical processes he accordingly finds, not in the nature of the 
processes themselves, but in their co-ordination; that is, in their adapt- 
edness to a given purpose, and to the peculiar and special relation in 
which the organism stands to the external world. All of this is 
exi)ressed in a proposition difficult to translate into English, in which 
he defines life as consisting in the reaction of the organism to external 
influences, and contrasts the uniformity of vital reactions with the 
variety of their exciting causes.* 

The purpose which I have in view in taking you back as 1 have done 
to the begiuing of the century is not merely to commemorate the work 
done by the wonderfully acute writer to whom we owe the first scien- 
tific conception of the science of life as a whole, but to show that this 
conception, as expressed in the definition I have given you as its founda- 
tion, can still be accepted as true. It suggests the idea of orgdnism as 
that to which all other biological ideas must relate. It also suggests, 

*"Lel)eu bestflit in der Gleicbformigkeit der Reaktioiien bei uugleiclifijrmigeii 
Eiuwirkiingeii der Aiissoiiwclt." — Treviraiiiis, Bioloyie vdcr I'hilosophie der hhenden 
Natut; Gotteugen, 1802, vol. i, p. 83. 



438 BIOLOGY IN EELATION TO OTHER NATURAL SCIENCES. 

altliough peiliaps it does uot express it, that action is not an attribute 
to the organism but of its essence — that if, on the other hand, proto- 
plasm is the basis of life, life is the basis of protoplasm. Their rela- 
tions to each other are reciprocal. We think of the visible structure 
only in connection with the invisible process. The definition is also of 
value as indicating at once the two lines of inquiry into which the sei- 
ence has divided by the natural evolution of knowledge. These two 
lines may be easily educed from the general principle from whicli Tre- 
viranus started, according to which it is the fundamental characteristic 
of the organism that all that goes on in it is to the advantage of the 
whole. 1 need scarcely say that this fundamental conception of organ- 
ism has at all times presented itself to the minds of those who have 
sought to understand the distinction between living and non-living. 
Without going back to the true father and founder of biology, Aris- 
totle, we may recall with interest the language employed in relation to 
it by the physiologists of three hundred years ago. It was at that time 
expressed by the term consensus imriium — which was defined as the 
concurrence of parts in action, of such a nature that each does quod 
suum, est, all combining to bring about one eftect "as if they had been 
in secret council," but at the same time constanti quadam naturce lege.* 
Prof. Huxley has made familiar to us how a century later J)escartes 
imagined to himself a mechanism to carry out this consensus, based on 
such scanty knowledge as was then available of the structure of the 
nervous system. The discoveries of the early part of the present cen- 
tury relating to the reflex action and the functions of sensory and 
motor nerves, served to realize in a wonderful way his anticipations as 
to the channels of influence, afferent and eflerent, by whicli the consen- 
sus is maintained; and in recent times (as Ave hope to learn from Prof. 
Horsley's lecture on the physiology of the nervous system) these 
channels have been investigated with extraoidinary minuteness and 
success. 

Whether with the old writers we si)eak about consensus, with Trevi- 
ranus about adaptation, or are content to take organism as our point of 
departure, it means that, regarding a plant or an animal as an organ- 
ism, we concern ourselves primarily with its activities, or, to use the 
word which best expresses it, its energies. Now the first thing that 
strikes us in beginning to think about the activities of an organism is 
that they are naturally distinguishable into two kinds, according as we 
consider the action of the whole organism in its relation to the external 
world or to other organisms, or the action of the parts or organs in 
their relation to each other. The distinction to which we are thus led 
between the internal and external relations of plants and animals has 
of course always existed, but has only lately come into such prominence 
that it divides biologists more or less comjjletely into two camps — on 

*Bausner, De Consensu Partium Eumani Corporis, Amst., 1556, Prief. ad lectorem, 
p. 4. 



BIOLOGY m RELATION TO OTHER NATURAL SCIENCES. 439 

tlie oue liaiid those who make it their aim to investigate the actions of 
the organism and its parts by the accepted methods of physics and 
chemistry, carrying this investigation as far as the conditions under* 
which each process manifests itself will permit; on the other, those 
who interest themselves rather in considering the place which each 
organism occupies, and the part which it jilays in the economy of nature. 
It is apparent that the two hues of inquiry, although they equally relate 
to what the organism does, rather than to what it is, and therefore both 
have equal right to be included in the one great science of life, or 
biology, yet lead in directions which are scarcely even parallel. So 
marked, indeed, is the distinction, that Prof. Haeckel some twenty 
years ago proposed to separate the study of organisms with reference to 
their place in nature under the designation of "oecology," defining it as 
comprising "the relations of the animal to its organic as well as to its 
inorganic environment, particularly its friendly or hostile relations to 
those animals or plants with which it comes into direct contact."* 
Whether this term expresses it or not, the distinction is a fundamental 
one. Whether with the tecologist we regard the organism in relation 
to the world, or with the physiologist as a wonderful comjilex of vital 
energies, the two branches have this in common, that both studies fix 
their attention, not on stuft'ed aninuils, buttertiies in cases, or even 
microscopical sections of the animal or plant body — all of which relate 
to the framework of life — but on life itself. 

The conception of biology which was developed by Treviranus as far 
as the knowledge of i»lauts and animals which then existed rendered 
possible, seems to me still to express the scope of the science. I should 
have liked, had it been within my power, to present to you both aspects 
of the vSubject in equal fulness; but I feel that I shall best profit by the 
present opportunity if I derive my illustrations chiefly from the division 
of biology to which I am attached — that which concerns the hitenial 
relations of the organism, it being my object not to specialize in either 
direction, but as Treviranus desired to do, to regard it as part — surely 
a very important part — of the great science of nature. 

The origin of life, the first transition from non-living to living, is a 
riddle which lies outside of our scope. No seriously-minded person 
however doubts that organized nature as it now i)resents itself to us 
has become what it is by a process of gradual perfecting or advance- 
ment, brought about by the elimination of those organisms which failed 
to obey the, fundamental principle of adaptation which Treviranus indi 
cated. Each step therefore in this evolution is a reaction to external 
influences, the motive of which is essentially the same as that by which

designates as conditions of the struggle for existence." Along with chorology — the 
distribution of animals — (I'cology constitutes what he calls liclations-plujiiiohxjh.

from moment to moment the organism governs itself. And the \Yhole 
process is a necessary outcome of the fact that those organisms are 
most prosperous which look best after their own welfare. As in that 
part of l)iology which deals with the internal relations of the organism, 
the interest of the individual is in like manner the sole motive by which 
every energy is guided. We may take what Treviranus called selfish 
adaptation — Zweclmassigleit fur sich selher — as a connecting link 
between the two branches of biological study. Out of this relation 
springs another which J need not say was not recognized until after 
the Darwinian epoch — that, 1 mean, which subsists between the two 
evolutions, that of the race and that of the individual. Treviranus, no 
less distinctly than his great contemporary Lamarck, was well aware 
that the affinities of plants and animals must be estimated accordnig 
to their developmental value, and consequently that classitication must 
be founded on development; but it occurred to no one what the real 
link was between descent and development; nor was it indeed until 
several years after the publication of the "Origin" that Haeckel enun- 
ciated that "biogenetic law," according to which the development of 
any individual organism is but a memory, a recai^itulation by the indi- 
vidual of the development of the race — of the process for which Fritz 
Miiller had coined the excellent word "phylogenesis;" and that each 
stage of the former is but a transitory re-appearance of a bygone epoch 
in its ancestral history. If therefore we are right in regarding onto- 
genesis as dependent on i:>hylogenesis, the origin of the former must 
correspond with that of the latter; that is, on the power which the race 
or the organism at every stage of its existence possesses of profiting by 
every condition or circumstance for its own advancement. • 

From the short summary of the connection between different parts 
of our science you will see that biology naturally falls into three divi- 
sions, and these are even more sharply distinguished by their methods 
than by their subjects, waiweXy^ physiology, of \>'\i\ch the methods are 
entirely experimental; morphology, the science which deals with the 
forms and structure of plants and animals, and of which it maybe said 
that the body is anatomy, the soul, development; and finally, occology, 
which n^es all the knowledge it can obtain from the other two, but 
chu'tiy rests on the exploration of the endless varied phenomena of ani- 
mal and plant life as they manifest themselves under natural conditions. 
This last branch of biology — the science which concerns itself with the 
external lelations of plants and animals to each other, and to the past 
and ijresent conditions of their existence — is by far the most attractive. 
In it those qualities of mind which especially distinguish the naturalist 
find their highest exercise, and it represents more than anj' other branch 
of the subject what Treviranus tenned the "philosophy of living nature." 
Notwithstanding the very general interest which several of its problems 
excite at the inesent moment I do not propose to discuss any of them, 
but rather to limit myself to the humbler task of showing that the fun-

daiiieutal idea which finds one form of expression in tlie world of living- 
beings regarded as a whole — the prevalence of the best — manifests 
itself with equal distinctness, and plays an equally essential part in the 
internal relations of the organism in the great science which treats of 
them — physiology. 

ORIGIN AN]) SCOPE OF MODERN PHYSIOLOGY. 

Just as there was no true philosophy of living nature until Darwin, 
we may with almost equal truth say that physiology did not exist as a 
science before Johannes Miiller. For although the sum of his numerous 
achievements in comparative anatomy and physiology, notwithstand- 
ing their extraordinary number and importance, could not be compared 
for merit and fruitfulness with the one discovery which furnished the 
key to so many riddles, he, no less than Darwin, by his influence on his 
successors, was the beginner of a new era. 

Miiller taught in Berlin frota 1833 to 1857. During that time a grad- 
ual change was in progress in the way in which biologists regarded the 
fundamental problem of life. Miiller himself, in common with Trevira- 
nus and all the biological teachers of his time, was a vitalist, i. e. he 
regarded what was then called the vis viialis — the Lehenslcraft — as 
something capable of being correlated with the physical forces; and as 
a necessary consequence held that phenomena should be classified or 
distinguished, according to the forces which i)roduced them, as vital or 
physical, and that all those processes — that is, groups or series of phe- 
nomena in living organisms — for which, in the then very imperfect 
knowledge which existed, no obvious physical exi)lanation could be 
found, were sufficiently explained when they were stated to be depen- 
dent on so called vital laws. But during the period of Midler's great- 
est activity times were changing, and he was changing with them. 
During his long career as professor at Berlin he became more and more 
objective in his tendencies, and exercised an intluencein the same direc- 
tion on the men of the next generation, teaching them that it was bet- 
ter and more useful to observe than to philosophize; so that, although 
he himself is truly regarded as the last of tlte vitalists — for he was 
a vitalist to the last — his successors were adherents of what has been 
very inadequately designated the mechanistic view of the phenomena 
of life. The change thus brought about just before the middle of this 
century was a revolution. It was not a substitution of one point of 
view for another, but simply a frank abandonment of theory for fact, 
of speculation for experiment. Physiologists ceased to theorize because 
they found something better to do. May 1 try to give you a sketch of 
this era of progress? 

Great discoveries as to the structure of plants and animals had been 
made in the course of the i^revious decade, those especially which had 
resulted from the introduction of the microscope as an instrument of 
research. By its aid Schwann had been able to show that all organ- 



442 BIOLOGY IN RELATION TO OTHER NATURAL SCIENCES. 

ized structures are built up of those i^articles of liviug substauce whicli 
we uow call cells, and recognize as the seats aud sources of every kind 
of vital activity. Hugo Mold, workiug in another direction, had given 
the name "protoplasm" to a certain hyaline substance which forms 
the lining of the cells of plants, though no one as yet knew that it was 
the essential constituent of all living structures — the basis of life no 
less in animals than in plants. And, finally, a new branch of study, 
histology, founded on observations which the microscope had for the 
first time rendered possible, had come into existence. Bowman, one of 
the earliest and most successful cultivators of this new science, called 
it physiological anatomy,* and justified the title by the very important 
inferences as to the secreting function of epithelial cells and as to the 
nature of muscular co'ntractiou, which he deduced from his admirable 
anatomical researches. From structure to function, from nucroscopical 
observation to physiological experiment, the transition was natural. 
Anatomy was able to answer some questions, but asked many more. 
Fifty years ago physiologists had microscoiies but had no hiboratories. 
English physiologists, l^owman, Paget, Sharpey, were at the same tin\e 
anatomists, and in Berlin, Johannes Miiller, along with anatomy and 
physiology, taught couiparati ve anatomy and pathology. But soon that 
sj)ecialization which, however nuicli we may regret its necessity, is an 
essential concomitant of progress, became more and more inevitable. 
The structural conditions on which the processes of life depend had 
become, if not known, at least accessible to investigation; but very 
little indeed had been ascertained of the nature of the processes them- 
selves, so little indeed, that if at this moment we could blot from the 
records of physiology the whole of the information which had been 
acquired, say in 1840, the loss would be diflicult to trace, not that the 
previously-known facts were of little value, but because every fact of 
moment has since been subjected to experimental verification. It is 
for this reason that, without any hesitation, we accord to 3Iiiller and to 
his successors, Briicke, du Bois-Eeymond, Helmholtz, who were his 
pupils, and Ludwig, in Germany, and to Claude Bernard t in France, 
the title of founders of our science. For it is the work which they began 
at that remarkable time (1840-1855), and which is now being carried 
on by their pupils or their pupils' pupils in England, America, France, 
Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, and even in that youngest contribu- 
tor to the advancement of science, Japan, that i)hysio]ogv has been 
gradually built up to whatever completeness it has at present attained. 
What were the conditions that brought about this great advance 
which coincided with the middle of the century? There is but little

tit is worthy of note that these five distinguished men were merely contempora- 
ries; Ludwig graduated in 1889; Bernard in 1S43; the other three between those 
dates. Three survive — Helmholtz, Ludwig, du I5ois-Reymoud.

difficulty in answering- the question. I have already said that the 
change was not one of doctrine, but of method. There was however 
a leading idea in the minds of those who were chiefly concerned in 
bringing it about. That leading notion was tliat however complicated 
may be the conditions under which vital energies manifest themselves, 
they can l)e split into processes which are identical in nature with those 
of the non-living world, and, as a corollary to this, that the analyzing 
of a vital process into its i^hysical and chemical constitnents, so as to 
bring these constituents into measurable relation with physical or chem- 
ical standards, is the only mode of investigating them which can lead 
to satisfactory results. 

There were several circumstances which at that time tended to make 
the younger i^hysiologists (and all of the men to whom I have just 
referred were then young) sanguine — perhaps too sanguine, in the hope 
that the application of experimental methods derived from the exact 
sciences would aftbrd solutions of many physiological in'oblems. One 
of these was the progress which liad been made in the science of chem- 
istry, and particularly the discovery that many of the compounds which 
before had been regarded as special products of vital processes, could 
be produced in the laboratory, and tliemore complete knowledge which 
had been thereby acquired of their chemical constitutions and rela- 
tions. In like manner the new school protited by the advances which 
had been made in physics, partly by borrowing from the physical lab- 
oratory various improved methods of observing the phenomena of liv- 
ing beings, but chiefly in consequence of the direct bearing of the 
crowning discovery of that epoch (that of the conservation of energy) 
on the discussions which then took place as to the relations between 
vital and physical forces; in connection with which it maybe noted 
that two of those who (along Avith Mr. Joule and your president at the 
last Nottingham meeting) took a prominent part in that discovery — 
Helmholtz and J, R. Mayer — were physiologists as much as they were 
physicists. 1 will not attempt even to enumerate the achievements of 
that epoch of progress. I may however without risk of wearying you, 
indicate the lines along which research at first proceeded, and draw 
your attention to the contrast between then and now. At present a 
young observer who is zealous to engage in research finds himself pro- 
vided with the most elaborate means of investigation, the chief obsta- 
cle to his success being that the problems which have been left over by 
his predecessors are of extreme difticulty, all of the easier questions 
having been worked out. There were then also ditflculties, but of an 
entirely different kind. The work to be done was in itself easier, but 
the means for doing it were wanting, and every investigator had to 
depend on his own resources. Consequently the successful men Avere 
those who, in addition to scientific training, jiossessed the ingenuity to 
devise and the skill to carry out methods for themselves. The work by 
which du Bois-Reymond laid the foundation of animal electricity would

uot have been possible had not its author, besides being a trained phys- 
icist, known how to do as good work in a small room in the upi)er tloor 
of the old university building at Berlin as any which is now done in 
his si)lendid laboratory. Had Ludwig not possessed mechanical apti- 
tude, in addition to scieutitic knowledge, he would have been unable 
to devise the apparatus by which he measured and recorded the varia- 
tions of arterial pressure (1848), and verified the principles which 
Young had laid down thirty years before as to the mechanics of the 
circulation. Nor, lastly, could Ilelmholtz, had he not been a great 
deal more than a mere physiologist, have made those measurements of 
the time relations of muscular and nervous responses to stimulation, 
which not only afford a solid foundation for all that has been done 
since in the same direction, but lias served as models of physiological 
experiment, and as evidence that perfect work was possible and was 
done by capable men, even when there were no physiological labora- 
tories. 

Each of these examples relates to work done within a year or two of 
the middle of the century.* If it were possible to enter more fully on 
the scientific history of the time, we should, J think, find the clearest 
evidence, first, that the foundation was laid in anatomical discoveries, 
in which it is gratifying to remember that English anatomists (Allen, 
Thomson, Bowman, Goodsir, Sharpey) took considerable share; sec- 
ondly, that progress was rendered possible by the rapid advances which, 
during the previous decade, had been made in physics and chemistry, 
and the participation of physiology in the general awakening of the 
scientific spirit which these discoveries produced. I venture however 
to think that notwithstanding the operation of these two causes, or 
rather combinations of causes, the development of our science would 
have been delayed had it not been for the exceptional endowments of 
the four or five young experimenters whose names 1 have mentioned, 
each of whom was capable of becoming a master in his own branch, and 
of guiding the future progress of inquiry. 

Just as the affinities of an organism can be best learned from its 
development, so the scope of a science may be most easily judged of 
by the tendencies Avhich it exhibits in its origin. 1 wish now to com- 
plete the sketch I have endeavored to give of the way in which physi- 
ology entered on the career it has since followed for the last half 
century, by a few words as to the influence exercised on general physi- 
ological theory by the progress of research. We have seen that no 
real advance was made until it became possible to investigate the phe- 
nomena of life by methods which approached more or less closely to 
those of the physicist, in exactitude. The methods of investigation

being physical or chemical, the organism itself naturally came to be 
considered as a complex of siicb processes, and nothing more. And in 
particular the idea of adaptation, wliicli, as I have endeavored to show, 
is not a consequence of organism, but its essence, was in great measure 
lost sight of. Not, 1 think, because it was any more possible than 
before to conceive of the organism otherwise than as a working together 
of parts for the good of the whole, but rather that, if I may so express 
it, the minds of men were so occupied with new tacts that they had not 
time to elaborate theories. The old meaning of the term "adaptation" 
as the equivalent of "design" had been abandoned, and no new mean- 
ing had yet been given to it, and consecjuently the word " mechanism" 
came to be emi^loyed as the equivalent of "process," as if the constant 
concomitance or sequence of two events was in itself a sufticient reason 
for assuming a mechanical relation between them. As in daily life so 
also in science, the misuse of words leads to misconceptions. To assert 
that the link between a and h is mechanical, for no better reason than 
that b always follows «, is an error of statement, which is apt to lead 
the incautious reader or hearer to imagine that the relation between a 
and b is understood, Avhen in fact its nature may be wholly unknown. 
Whether or not at the time which we are considering some physiolog- 
ical writers showed a tendency to commit this error, I do not think that 
it found expression in any generally accepted theory of life. It may 
however be admitted that the rapid progress of experimental investi- 
gation led to too confident anticipations, and that to some enthusiastic 
minds it appeared as if we were approaching within measurable dis- 
tance of the end of knowledge. Sucli a tendency is, I think, a natural 
result of every signal advance. In an eloquent 'Ilarveian oration, 
delivered last antumn by Dr. Bridges, it was indicated how, after Har- 
vey's great discovery of the circulation, men were too apt to found upon 
it explanations of all phenomena whether of health or disease, to such 
an extent that the practice of medicine was even prejudicially afiected 
by it. In respect of its scientific importance the epoch we are consid- 
ering may well be compared with that of Harvey, and may have been 
followed by an undue i)refereuce of the new as compared with the old, 
but no more permanent unfavorable results have sliown themselves. 
As regards the science of medicine, we need only remember that it was 
during the years between 1845 and 18G0, that Virchow made those 
researches by which he brought the processes of disease into imme- 
diate relation with the normal processes of cell development and 
growth, and so, by making pathology a part of physiology, secured its 
subsequent j)rogress and its influence on practical medicine. Similarly 
in physiology, the achievement of those years led on without any inter- 
ruption or drawback to those of the following generation; while in 
general biology the revolution in the mode of regarding the internal 
processes of the animal or plant organism which resulted from these 
achievements, prepared the way for the acceptance of the still greater

revolution wliicli tlie Darwinian epocli brouglit about in the views 
entertained by naturalists of the relations of plants and animals to 
each other and to their surroundings. 

It has been said that every science of observation begins by going 
out botanizing, by which, I suppose, is meant that collecting and record- 
ing observations is the first thing to be done in entering on a new field 
of inquiry. The remark would scarcely be true of jihysiology, even at 
the earliest stage of its develoi)ment, for the most elementary of its 
facts could scarcely be picked up as one gathers flowers in a wood. 
Each of the processes a\ hich go to make up the complex of life requires 
separate investigation, and in each case the investigation must consist 
in first splitting up the process into its constituent phenomena, and 
then determining their relation to each other, to the process of which 
they form part, and to the conditions under which they manifest them- 
selves. It will, I think, be found that even in the simplest inquiry into 
the nature of vital processes some such order as this is followed. Thus, 
for example, if muscular contraction be the subject on which we seek 
information, it is obvious that, in order to measure its duration, the 
mechanical work it accomplishes, the heat wasted in doing it, the elec- 
tro-motive forces which it develops, and the clianges of form associated 
with these phenomena, special modes of observation nnist be used for 
each of them, that each measurement must be in the first instance 
separately made, under special conditions, and by methods specially 
adapted to the required purpose. In the synthetic part of the inquiry 
the guidance of experiment must again be sought for the purpose of 
discriminating between apparent and real causes, and of determining 
the order in which the phenomena occur. Even the simplest exj)eri- 
mental investigations of vital processes are beset with difticulties. For, 
in addition to the extreme complexity of the phenomena to be examined 
and the uncertainties which arise from the relative inconstancy of the 
conditions of all that goes on in the living organism, there is this addi- 
tional drawback, that, whereas in the exact sciences experiment is 
guided by well-ascertained laws, here the only principle of universal 
application is that of adaptation, and that even this can not, like a 
law of physics, be taken as a basis for deductions, but only as a sum- 
mary expression of that relation between external exciting causes and 
the reactions to which they give rise, which, in accordance with Tre- 
viranus' definition, is the essential character of vital activity. 

THE SPECIFIC ENERGIES OF THE ORGANISM. 

When, in 1826, J. Miiller was engaged in in^'estigatingthe physiology 
of vision and hearing, he introduced into the discussion a term, " spe- 
cific energy," the use of which by Helmholtz* in his physiological writ- 

* " Handb. der physiologischeu Optik," 1886, p. 233. Helmholtz uses the word in 
Ihe plural, the "energies of the ueives of special sense." 



BIOLOGY IN RELATION TO OTHER NATURAL SCIENCES. 447 

iugs lias rendered it familiar to all students. Both writers mean by 
the word energy, not the " capacity of doing work," but simply activity^ 
using it in its old-fashioned meaning, that of the Greek word from 
which it is derived. With the qualification '' specific," it serves, per- 
haps, better than any other expression to indicate the way in which 
adaptation manifests itself. In this more extended sense the " specific 
energy" of a part or organ — whether that part be a secreting cell, a 
motor cell of the brain or spinal cord, or one of the photogenous cells 
which produce the light of the glowworm, or the protoplasmic plate 
which generates the discharge of the torpedo— is simply the special 
action which it normaUij performs, its norma or rule of action being in 
each instance the interest of the organhm as a whole of wdiich it forms 
part, and the exciting cause some influence outside of the excited struc- 
ture, technically called a stimulus. It thus stands for a characteristic 
of living structures which seems to be universal. The apparent excep- 
tions are to be found in those bodily activities which, following Bichat, 
we call vegetative, because they go on, so to speak, as a matter of 
course; but the more closely we look into them the more does it appear 
that they form no exception to the general rule, that every link in the 
chain of living action, however uniform that action may be, is a response 
to an antecedent influence. Nor can it well be doubted that, as every 
living cell or tissue is called upon to act in the interest of the whole, 
the organism must be ca]>able of influencing every part so as to regu- 
late its acfion. For, although there are some instances in which the 
channels of this influence are as yet unknown, the tendency of recent 
investigations has been to diminish the number of such instances. In 
general there is no difliculty in determining both the nature of the cen- 
tral influence exercised and the relation between it and the normal 
function. It may help to illustrate this relation to refer to the express- 
ive word AndosHug, by which it has for many years been designated by 
German writers. This word stands for the performance of function by 
the "letting oft" of "specific energies." Carrying out the notion of 
"letting oft" as expressing the link between action and reaction, we 
might compare the whole process to the mode of working to a repeating 
clock (or other similar mechanism), in which case the pressure of the 
finger on the button would rei»resent the external influence or stimulus, 
the striking of the clock, the normal reaction. And now may I ask 
you to consider in detail one or two illustrations of physiological 
reaction — of the letting off of specif c energg '! 

The repeater may serve as a good example, inasmuch as it is, in bio- 
logical language, a highly differentiated structure, to which a single 
function is assigned. So also in the living organism, we find the best 
examples of specific energy where JMiiller found them, namely, in the 
most difterentiated, or, as we are apt to call them, the highest structures. 
The retina, with the part of the brain which belongs to it, together con- 
stitute such a structure, and will aflord us therefore the illustration we

want, with this advaiita.ye for our ])reseiit purpose, that the i)lieiioinena 
are sucli as we all luive it in our power to observe in ourselves. In the 
visual apparatus the principle of voruxdify of reaction is fully exem- 
plified. In the physical sense the word " light'' stands fora»ther vibra- 
tions, but in the sensuous or subjective sense for sensations. The swings 
are the stinuilus, the sensations are the reaction. Between the two 
conies the link, the "letting" off," which it is our business to understand. 
Here let us remember that the man who first recognized this distinction 
between the physical and the physiological was not a biologist, but a 
l)]iysicist. It was Young who first made clear (though his doctrine fell 
on unappreciative ears) that, although in vision the external intluences 
Avhich give rise to the sensation of light are infinitely varied, the 
responses need not be more than three in number, each being in Miiller's 
language, a. "specific energy" of some part of the visual apparatus. 
We speak of the organ of vision as hif/JiJy differentiated, an expression 
which carries with it the suggestion of a distinction of rank between 
diff'eient vital processes. The suggestion is a true one, for it would be 
possible to arrange all those parts or organs of which the bodies of the 
hi<jher animals consist in a series, placing at the lower end of the series 
those of which the functions are continuous, and therefore called vege- 
tative; at the other, those highly specialized structures, as e. e/., those, 
in the brain, which in response to ])hysical light produce physiological, 
that is subjective, light ; or, to take another instance, the so called motor 
cells of the surfaci^ of the brain, which in response to a stiiiinhis of much 
greater complexity i)roduce voluntary motion. And just as in civilized 
society an individual Is valued according to his power of doing one 
thing Avcll, so the high rank which is assigned to the structure, or 
rather to the "specific energy" which it represents, belongs to it by 
virtue of its specialization. And if it be asked how this conformity is 
manifested, the answer is, by the quality, intensity, duration, and exten- 
sion of the response, in all which respects vision serves as so good an 
an exami)le, that we can readily understand how it happened that it 
was in this field that the relation between response and stimulus was 
first clearly recognized. I need scarcely say that, however interesting 
it might be to follow out the lines of inquiry thus indicated, we cannot 
attempt it this evening. All that I can do is to mention one or two 
recent observations which, while they serve as illustrations, may per- 
haps be sufficiently novel to interest even those who are at home in the 
subject. 

Probably every one is acquainted with some of the familiar proofs 
that an object is seen fi)r a much longer period than it is actually 
exi)Osed to view; that the visual reaction lasts much longer than its 
cause. More precise observations teach us that this response is regu- 
lated according to laws which it has in common with all the higher 
functions of an organism. If, for example, the cells in the l)rain of the 
torpedo are "let olf " — that is, awakened by an external stimulus — the

eJectrieal discharge, which, as iu the case of vision, follows after a cer- 
tain interval, lasts a certain time, first rapidly increasing- to a maxi- 
mum of intensity, then more slowly diminishing. In like manner, as 
regards the visual aij.paratus, we have, in the response to a sudden 
invasion of the eye by light, a rise and fall of a similar character. In 
the case of the electrical organ, and in many analogous instances, it is 
easy to investigate the time relations of the successive phenomena, so 
as to represent them graphically. Again, it is found that in many 
physiological reactions, the period of rising " energy" (as Helmholtz 
called it) is followed by a period during which the responding struc- 
ture is not only inactive, but its capacity for energizing is so com- 
pletely lost that the same exciting cause which a moment before " let 
oft'" the characteristic response is now without eftect. As regards 
vision, it has long been believed that these general characteristics of 
physiological reaction have their counterpart in the visual process, the 
most striking evidence being that in the contemplation of a lightning 
flash — or better, of an instantaneously illuminated white disk* — the 
eye seems to receive a double stroke, indicating that although the 
stimulus is single and instantaneous, the response i« reduplicated. 
The most x)recise of the methods we until lately possessed for investi- 
gating the wax and wane of the visual reation, were not only diflBcult 
to carry out but left a large margin of uncertainty. It was therefore 
particularly satisfactory when M. Oharpeutier, of Nancy, whose merits 
as an investigator are i)erhaps less known than they deserve to be, 
devised an experiment of extreme simplicity which enables us, not only 
to observe, but to measure with great facility both phases of the reac- 
tion. It is difficult to explain even the simplest ai)i)aratus without 
diagrams; you wi 11 however nnderstaiid the experiment if you will 
imagine that you are contemplating a disk, like those ordinarily used 
for color mixing; that it is divid ed by two radial lines which diverge 
from each other at an aiigle of 60°; that the sector which these lines 
inclose is white, the rest black ; that the disk revolves slowly, about 
once in two seconds. You then see close to the front edge of the 
advancing sector, a black bar, followed by a second at the same dis- 
tance from itself but much fainter. Now, the scientific value of .the 
experiment consists in this, that the angular distance of the bar from 
the black border ij^ in proportion to the frequency of the revolutions — 
the faster the wider. If, for example, when the disk makes a half rev- 
olution in a second the distance is ten degrees, this obviously means 
that when light bursts into the eye, the extinction happens one-eight 
eenth of a second after the excitation. t

The fact thus deuiuiistiated, that the vi.sual reactiou eonsequeut on 
aninstantaueousilliimination exhibits tlie alternations I have described, 
has enabled M. Charpeutier to make out another fact in relation to the 
visual reaction which is, I think, of equal importance. In all the 
instances, excepting the retina, in which the i^hysiological response to 
stimulus has a definite time limitation, ,ind in so far resembles an explo- 
sion — in other words, in all the higher forms of specific energy, it can 
be shown experimentally that the process is propagated from the part 
first directly acted on to other contiguous pai'ts of similar endowment. 
Thus, in the simplest of all known phenomena of this kind, the elec- 
trical change, by which the leaf of the Dionjiea plant responds to the 
slightest touch of its sensitive hairs, is propagated from one side of the 
leaf to the other, so that in the opposite lobe the response occurs after 
a delay which is proportional to the distance between the spot excited 
and the spot observaxl. That in the retina there is also such propaga- 
tion has not only been surmised from analogy, but inferred from certain 
observed facts. M. Chari)entier has now been able by a- method which, 
although simple, I must not attempt to describe, not only to jirove its 
existence, but to measure its rate of progress over the visual field. 

There is another aspect of the visual response to the- stinuilus of light 
which, if I am not trespassing too long on your patience, may, I think, 
be interesting to consider. As the relations between the sensations of 
color and the physical properties of the light which excites them, are 
among tlie most certain and invariable in the whole range of vital reac- 
tions, it is obvious that they aftord as fruitful a field for physiological 
investigation as those in which wliite light is concerned. We have on 
one side physical facts, that is, wave lengths or vibration-rates; on the 
other, facts in consciousness — namely, sensations of c(^)lor — so simple 
that notwithstanding their subjective character there is no difficulty in 
measuring either their intensity or their duration. Between these there 
are lines of influence, neither physical nor jisychological, which pass 
from the former to the latter through the visual apparatus (retina, nerve, 
brain). It is these lines of influence which interest tlie physiologist. 
The structure of the visual api)aratus aftbrds us no clews to trace them 
by. The most important fact we know about them is that they must 
be at least three in numbei". 

It has been lately assumed by some that vision, like every other 
specific energy, having been developed progressively, objects were seen 
by the most elementary forms of eye only in chiaroscuro, that after- 
wards some colors were distinguished, eventually all. As regards 
hearing it is so. The organ which, on structural grounds, we consider 
to represent that of hearing in animals low in the scale of organiza- 
tion — as, e. g., in the Ctenophora — has nothing to do with sound,* but

confers on its possessor the powci- of Judging- of the direction of its 
own movements in tlie water in which it swims, and of guiding these 
movememts accordingly. In the lowest vertebrates, as, e. g., in the 
dogfish, although the auditory apparatus is much more complicated 
in structure, and plainly corresponds with our own, we still find the 
particular part which is concerned in hearing scarcely traceable. All 
that is provided for is that sixth sense, which the higher animals also 
possess, and which enables them to judge of the direction of their own 
movements. But a stage higher in the vertebrate series we find the 
special mechanismsby which we ourselves a|5preciate sounds beginning 
to appear — not snpplauting or taking the place of the imperfect organ, 
but added to it. As regards hearing, therefore, a uey\' function is 
acquired without any transformation or fusion of the old into it. We 
ourselves possess the sixth sense, by which we keep our balance and 
which serves as the guide to our bodily movements. It resides in the 
partof the internal ear which is called the labyrinth. At the same time 
we enjoy along with it the possession of the cochlea, that more comipli- 
cated apparatus by which we are able to hear sounds and to discriminate 
their vibration -rates. 

As regards vision, evidence of this kind is wanting. There is, so far 
as I know, no proof that visual organs which are so imi^erfect as to be 
-incapable of distinguishing the forms of objects, may not be affected 
differently by their colors. Even if it could be shown that the least 
perfectkforms of eye i^ossess only the power of discriminating between 
light and darkness, the question whether in our own such a faculty 
exists separately from that of distinguishing colors is one which can 
only be settled by experiment. As inall sensationsof color the sensation 
of brightness is mixed, it is obvious that one of the first j)oints to be 
determined is whether the latter represents a ''specific energy" or 
merely a certain combination of specific energies which are excited by 
colors. The ([uestion is not whether there is such a thing as white 
light, but whether we possess a separate faculty l)y which we judge of 
light and shade — a question which, although we have derived our 
knowledge of it chiefly from physical experiment, is one of eye and 
brain, not of wave-lengths or vibration-rates, and is therefore essen- 
tially i»hysiological. 

There is a German proverb which says, "Bei Kacht sind alle Katzeu 
gran." The fact which this proverb expresses presents itself experimen- 
tally when a S])ectrum projected on a white surface is watched, while 
the intensity of the light is gradually diminished. As the colors fade 
away they become indistinguishable as such, the last seen being the 
primary red and green. Finally, they also disappear, but a gray band 
of light still remains, of which the most luminous part is that which 
before was green.* Without entering into details let us consider Avhat

this tells us of the specific euergy of the visual apparatus. Whether 
or not the faculty by which we see gray in the dark is one which we 
possess in common with animals of imperfectly developed vision, there 
seems little doubt that there are individuals of our own species, who, 
in the fullest sense of tbe expression, have no eye for color; in whom 
all color seuse is absent; persons who inhabit a world of gray, seeing 
all things as they might have done had they and their ancestors always 
lived nocturnal lives. In the theory of color vision, as it is commonly 
stated, no reference is made to such a faculty as we are now discussing. 
Prof. Hering, whose observations as to the diminished spectrum I 
referred to Just now, who was among the first to subject the vision of 
the fofalli/ color-blind to accurate examination, is of opinion, on that 
and on other grounds, that the sensation of light and shade is a specific 
faculty. Very recently the same view has been advocated on a wide 
basis by a distinguished psychologist, Prof. Ebbinghaus.* Happily, as 
regards the actual experimental results relating to both these main 
subjects, there seems to be a complete coincidence of observation 
between observers who interpret them difllerently. Thus the receut 
elaborate investigaticms of Capt. Abneyt (with Gen. Festing), repre- 
senting graphically the results of his measurements of the subjective 
values of the different parts of the diminished spectrum, as well as 
those of the fully illuminated spectrum as seen by the totally color-blind, 
are in the closest accord with the observations of Hering, and have 
moreover been substantially confirmed in both points by the measure- 
ments of I)r. Konig in Helmholtz' laboratory at Berlin. J That observ- 
ers of such eminence as the three persons whom 1 have mentioned, 
employing different methods and with a different purpose in view, and 
without reference to each other's work, should arrive in so complicated 
an inquiry at coincident results, augurs well for the speedy settlement 
of this long-debated question. At present the inference seems to be 
that such a specific energy as Hering's theory of vision postulates actu- 
ally exists, and that it has for associates thecolor-i)erceiviug activities 
of the visual apparatus, provided that these are present; but that 
whenever the intensity of the illumination is below the chromatic 
threshold — that is, too feeble to awaken these activities — or when, as 
in the totally color-blind, they are wanting, it manifests itself independ- 
ently ; all of which can be most easily understood on such a hypothesis 
as has lately been suggested in an ingenious pajDer by Mrs. Ladd

Franklin,* that each of the elements of the visual apparatus is made up 
of a central structure for the sensation of light and darkness, with 
collateral ai)pendages for the sensations of color — it being of course 
understood that this is a mere diagrammatic representation, which 
serves no purjjoses beyond that of facilitating the conception of the 
relation between the several '^specific energies." 

EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY. 

Resisting the temptation to pursue this subject further, I will now 
ask you to follow me into a region which, although closely connected 
with the subjects we have been considering, is beset with greater diffi- 
culties — the subject in which, under the name of physiological or 
experimental psychoU)gy, i)hysiologists and psychologists have of late 
years taken a common interest — a borderland not between fact and 
fancy, but between two methods of investigation ^f questions which 
are closely related, which here, though they do not overlap, at least 
interdigitate. It is manifest that, quite irrespectively of any foregone 
conclusion as to the dependence of mind on processes of which the 
biologist is accustomed to take cognizance, mind must be regarded as 
one of the "specific energies"' of the organism, and should on that 
ground be included in the subject-matter of physiology. As however 
our science, like other sciences, is limited not merely by its subject but 
also by its method, it actually takes in only so much of psychology as 
is experimental. Thus sensation (although it is psychological), and the 
investigation of its relation to the special structures by which the mind 
keeps itself informed of what goes on in the outside world, have always 
been considered to be in the physiological sphere. And it is by ana- 
tomical researches relating to the minute structure and to the develop- 
ment of the brain, by observatimi of the facts of disease, and, above all, 
by physiological experiment, tluit those changes in the ganglion cells 
of the brain and spinal cord which are the immediate antecedents of 
every kind of bodily action have been traced. Between the two (that 
is, between sensation and the beginning of action), there is an inter- 
vening region which the physiologist has hitherto willingly resigned to 
psychology, feeling his incompetence to use the only instrument by 
which it can be explored — that of introspection. This consideration 
enables us to understand the course which the new study (1 will not 
claim for it the title of a new science, regarding it as merely a part of 
the great science of life) has hitherto followed, and why physiologists 
have been unwilling to enter on it. Tlie study of the less complicated 
internal relations of the organism has afrbrded so many difficult prob- 
lems that the most difficult of ail have been deferred; so that although 
the psycho-physical method was initiated by E. H. Weber in the mid-

die of tlie ])ros(nit century, by investigations * whicli formed part of tlie 
work done at tliat epoch of discovery, and altlioiigh Prof. Wundt, also 
a physiologist, has taken a larger share in the more recent develoi)ment 
of the new stndy, it is chiefly by psychologists that the researches 
which have given to it its importance as a new discipline have been 
conducted. 

Although therefore experimental psychology has derived its methods 
from physical science, the result has been not so much that physiologists 
have become philosophers as that ])hilosophers have become experi- 
mental psychologists. In our own universities, in those of America, 
and still more in those of Germany, psychological students of mature 
age are, to be found who are willing to place themselves in the dissect- 
ing room side l)y side with beginners in anatomy, in order to acquire 
that exact knowledge of the framework of the organism without which 
no man can understand its working. Those therefore who are appre- 
hensive lest the regions of mind shoidd be invaded by the hisaniens 
sapieiitia of the laboratory, may, I think, console themselves with the 
thought that the invaders are for the most part men who, before they 
became laboratory workers, had already given their allegiance to phil- 
osophy; their pur^xtse being not to relin(|uish detinitely, but merely to 
lay aside for a time the weapons in the use of which they had been 
trained in order to learn the use of ours. The motive that has encour- 
aged them has not been any hope of finding au experimental solution 
of any of the ultimate problems of philosophy, but the conviction that 
inasmuch as the relation between mental stimuli and the mental pro- 
cesses which they awaken is of the same order with the relation between 
every other vital process and its specific determinant, the only hope of 
ascertaining its nature must lie in the employment of the same methods 
of comparative measurement which the biologist uses foi' similar pur- 
poses. Not that there is necessarily anything scientific in mere measure- 
ment, but that measurement affords the only means by which it can be 
determined whether or not the same conformity in the relation between 
stimulus and reaction which we have accepted as the fundamental char- 
acteristic of life is also to be found in mind, notwithstanding that 
mental processes have no known physical concomitants. The results 
of experimental ])sychology tend to sliow that it is .so, and consecjuently 
that in so far, the i)rocesses in question are as truly functions of organ 
ism as the contraction of a muscle, or as the changes produced in the 
retinal pigment l)y light. 

1 will make no attempt even to enumerate the special lines of incjuiry 
which during the last decade have been conducted with such vigor in 
all parts of the world, idl of them traceable to the influence of the 
Leipzig school, l>ut will content myself with saying that the general

purpose of these investii;atious has been to lU'teiiuiiie with tlie utmost 
attainable x^recisi tlie nature of psychical relations. Some of these 
investigations begin with those simpler reactions which more or less 
resemble those of an automatic mechanism, proceeding to those in 
which the resulting action or movement is moditied by the influence of 
auxiliary or antagonistic conditions, or changed by the sinuiltaneous 
or antecedent action on the reagent of other stimuli, in all of which 
cases the effect canbe expressed quantitatively; others lead to results 
which do not so readily admit of measurement. In pursuing this 
course of inquiry the physiologist finds himself as he proceeds more 
and more the coadjutor of the psychologist, less and less his director; 
for whatever advantage the former may have in the mere technique of 
observation, the things with which he has to do are revealed only to intro- 
spection, and can be studied only by methods which lie outside of his 
sphere. I might in illustration of this refer to many recent experi- 
mental researches — such, for example, as those by which it has been 
sought to obtain exact data as to the physiological concomitants of 
pleasure and of pain, or as to the influence of weariness and recupei^a- 
tion, as modifiers of i)sychological reactions. Another outwork of the 
mental citadel which has been invaded by the experimental method is 
that of memory. Even here it can be shown that in the comx)arison of 
transitory as conq^ared with permanent memory — as, for exam])le, in 
the getting off by heart of a wholly uninteresting series of words, with 
subsequent oblivion and reacquisition — the labor of acquiring and reac- 
quiring maybe measured, and consequently the relation between them, 
and that this ratio varies according to a simple numerical law. 

1 think it not unlikely that the only efiect of what I have said may 
be to suggest to some of my hearers the question. What is the use of 
such inquiries? Experimental psychology has, to the best of my 
knowledge, no technical application. The only satisfactory answer I 
can give is that it has exercised, and will exercise in future, a helpful 
influence on the science of life. Every science of observation, and each 
branch of it, derives from the peculiarities of its methods certain ten- 
dencies which are apt to predominate unduly. We sjieak of this as 
specialization, and are constantly striving to resist its influence. The 
most successful way of doing so is by availing ourselves of the counter 
acting influence which two oi^posite tendencies mutually exercise when 
they are sinuiltaneous. He that is skilled in the methods of introspec- 
tion natiTially (if I may be i)ermitted to say so) looks at the same thing 
from an opposite point of view to that of the experimentalist. It is 
therefore good that the two should so w ork together that the tendency 
of the exi)erimentalist to imagine the existence of nu'chanism where 
none is proved to exist — of the i^sychologist to approach the phenomena 
of mind too exclusively from the subjective side — may mutually correct 
and assist each other.

PHOTOTAXIS AND CHEMIOTAXIS. 

Considering- that every organism mnst have sprung from a unicellular 
ancestor, some have thought that unless we are prepared to admit a 
deferred epigenesis of mind, we must look for psychical manifestations 
even among the lowest animals, and that as in the protozoon all the 
vital activities are blended together, mind should be present among 
them not merely potentially but actually, though in diminished degree. 

Such a hypothesis involves ultimate questions which it is unneces- 
sary to enter upon. It will however be of interest in connection with 
our present subject to discuss the phenomena which served as a basis 
for it — those which relate to what may be termed the behavior of uni- 
cellular organisms and of individual cells, in so far as these last are 
capable of reacting to external influences. The observations which 
afford us most information are those in which the stinudi employed ::in 
be easily measured, such as electrical currents, light, or chemical 
agents in solution. 

A single instance, or at most two, must suffice to illustrate the influ- 
ence of light in directing the movements of freely moving cells, or, as it 
is termed, Phototaxin. The rod-like purjde organism called by Engel- 
mann Bacterium plwiometricnm* is such a light-lover that if you place 
a drop of water containing these organisms under the microscope, and 
focus the smallest possible beam of liglit on a particular spot in the 
field, the spot acts as a light trap and becomes so crowded with the 
little rodlets as to acquire a deep port-wine color. If, instead of mak- 
ing his trap of white light, he in-ojected on the field a microscopic 
spectrum, Engelmann found that the rodlets showed their preference 
for a spectral color, which is absorbed when transmitted through their 
bodies. By the aid of a light trap of the same kind," the very well 
known siiindle-shaped and flagellate cell of Euglena can be shown to 
have a similar power of discriminating color, but its preference is differ- 
ent. This familiar organism advances with its flagellum for":vards, the 
sharp end of the spindle having a red or orange eye point. Accordingly, 
the light it loves is again that which is most absorbed, viz, the blue of 
the spectrum (line F). 

These examples may serve as an introduction to a similar one in 
which the directing cause of movement is not physical but chemical. 
The spectral light trap is used in the way already described; the 
organisms to be observed are not colored, but bacteria of that common 
sort which twenty years ago we used to call Bacterium termo, and 
which is recognized as the ordinary determining cause of putrefaction. 
These organisms do not care for light, but are great oxygen-lovers. Con- 
sequently, if you illuminate with your spectrum a filament of a confer- 
void alga, placed in water containing bacteria, the assimilation of

carbon and conseqnent diseugagemewt of oxygen is most active in the 
part of the filament which receives the red rays (B to C). 

To this part therefore Avhere there is a dark band of absori^tion, 
the bacteria which want oxygen are attracted in crowds. The motive 
which brings them together is their desire for oxygen. Let us compare 
other instances in wliich the source of attraction is food. 

The Plasmodia of tlie Myxomycetes, particularly one which has been 
recently investigated by Mr. Arthur Lister,* may be taken as a typical 
instance of what may be called the chemical allurement of liviug proto- 
plasm. In this organism, which in the active state is an expansion of 
labile living material, the delicacy of the reaction is comparable to that 
of the sense of smell in those animals in which the olfactory organs are 
adapted to an aquatic life. Just as for example the dogfish is attracted 
by food which it can not see, so the Plasmodium of Budhamia becomes 
aware, as' if it smelled it, of the presence of its food — a particular kind 
of fungus. I have no diagram to explain this, but will ask you to 
imagine an expansion of living material, quite structureless, spreading 
itself along a wet surface; that this expansion of transparent material 
is bounded by an irregular coast line; and that somewhere near the 
coast there has been placed a fragment of the material on which the 
Badhamia feeds. The presence of this bit of Stereum produces an 
excitement at the part of the Plasmodium next to it. Towards this 
center of activity streams of living material converge. Soon the afliux 
leads to an outgrowth of the Plasmodium, which in a few minutes 
advances towards the desired fragment, envelops, and incorporates it. 

May I give jou another example also derived from the physiology of 
plants"? Very shortly after the publication of Engelmann's observa- 
tions of the attraction of bacteria by oxygen, Pfefler made the remark- 
able discovery that the movements of the antherozoids of ferns and of 
mosses are guided by impressions derived from chemical sources, by the 
allurement exercised upon them by certain chemical substances in solu- 
tion — in one of the instances mentioned, by sugar, in the other by an 
organic acid. The method consisted in introducing the substance to be 
tested, in any required strength, into a minute capillary tube closed at 
one end, and placing it under the microscope in water inhabited by 
antherozoids, which thereui)on showed their predilection for tlie sub- 
stance, or the contrary, by its effect on their movements. 1 n accordciiice 
with the principle followed in experimental psychology, Pfeffert made 
it his object to determine, not the relative effects of different doses, but 
the smallest perceptible increase of dose which the organism was able 
to detect, with this result — that, just as in measurements of the rela- 
tion between stimulus and reaction in ourselves we find that the sensa-

tional value of a stimulus depends, not on its absolute intensity, but on 
the ratio between that intensity and the ijrevious excitation, so in this 
simplest of vital rea<;ents the same so-called psycho-physical law mani- 
fests itself. It is not however with a view to this interesting relation 
that I have referred to Pfeft'er's discovery, but because it serves as a 
center around which other phenomena, observed alike in plants and 
animals, have been iiiouped. As a general designation of reactions of 
this kind Pfeft'er devised the term Gheniotcijcis, or, as we in England 
prefer to call it, Cliemiotaxis. Pfeffer's contrivance for cliennotactic 
testing was borrowed from the pathologists, who have long used it for 
the purpose of determining the relation between a great variety of 
chemical compounds or products, and the colorless corpuscles of the 
bh)od. 1 need, I am sure, make no apology for referring to a question 
which, although purely i)athological, is of very great biological inter- 
est — the theory of the process by which, not only in man, but also, as 
Metschnikoft" has strikingly shown, in animals far down in the scale of 
development, the organism protects itself against such harmful things 
as, whether particulate or not, are able to penetrate its framework. 
Since ( 'Ohnheim's great discovery in 18G7 we have known that the 
central phenomenon of what is termed by pathologists inflammation is 
what would now be called a chemiotactic one; for it consists in the 
gathering togetlier, like that of vultui'as to a carcass, of those migra- 
tory cells which have their home in the blood stream and in the lym- 
l^hatic system, to any point where the living tissue of the body has been 
injured or damaged, as if the ])roducts of disintegration which are set 
free where such damage occurs were attractive to them. 

The fact of cliemiotaxis therefore as a constituent phenomenon of 
the process of intlammation, was familiar in pathology long before it 
was understood. Cohnheim himself attributed it to changes in the 
channels along which the cells moved, and tliis exi)lanation was gener- 
ally accepted, though some writers, at all events, recognized its incom- 
pleteness. But no sooner was Pfeffer's discovery known than Leber,* 
who for years had been w^orking on the subject from the pathological 
side, at once saw that the two processes were of similar nature. Then 
followed a variety of researches of great interest, by which the impor- 
tance of cliemiotaxis in relation to the destruction of disease-producing 
microphytes was proved, that of Buchnert on the chemical excita- 
bility of leucocytes being among the most important. Much discussion 
has taken place, as many present are aware, as to the kind of wander- 
ing cells, or leucocytes, which in the first instance attack nnn-bittc 
microbes, and how they deal with them. The question is not by any 
means decided. It has however I venture to think, been conclusively

shown tliat the process of destruction is a chemical one, that the 
(lestractivc aj^cnt has its source in the cheniiotactic cells — that is, cells 
which act under the orders of chemical stimuli. Two Cambridge 
observers, Messrs. Kanthack and Hardy,* have lately shown that, in 
the particular instance which they have investigated, the cells which 
are most directly concerned in the destruction of morbific bacilli, 
although chemiotactic, do not possess the power of incorporating bacilli 
or particles of any other kind. While therefore we must regard the 
relatiim between the process of devitalizing and that of incorporating 
as not yet sufficiently determined, it is now no longer i^ossible to regard 
the latter as essential to the former. 

There seems therefore to be very little doubt that chemiotactic cells 
are among the agents by which the human or animal organism protects 
itself against infection. There are however many questions connected 
with this action which have not yet been answered. The lirst of these 
are chemical ones — that of the nature of the attractive substance and 
that of the process by which the living carriers of infection are 
destroyed. Another point to be determined is how far the process 
admits of adaptation to the particular infection which is i)resent in 
each case, and to the state of liability or imnumity of the infected indi- 
vidual. The subject is therefore of great comi)]ication. None of the 
l^oints I have snggested can be settled by experiments in glass tubes 
such as I have described to you. These serve only as indications of the 
course to be followed in much more complicated and difficult investiga- 
tions, when we have to do with acute diseases as they actually affect 
ourselves or animals of similar liability to ourselves, and find ourselves 
face to face with the question of their causes. 

It is possible that many members of the association are not aware of 
the unfavorable — I will not say discreditable — position that this coun- 
try at present occupies in relation to the scientific study of thfe great 
subject — the causes and mode of prevention of infectious diseases. As 
regards administrative efficiency in matters relating to public health, 
England was at one time far ahead of all other countries, and still 
retains its superiority; but as regards scientific knowledge we are, in this 
subject as in others, content to borrow from our neighbors. Those who 
desire either to learn the methods of research or to carry out scientific 
inquiries, have to go to Berlin, to Munich, to Breslau, or to the Pasteur 
Institute in Paris, to obtain what England ought long ago to have pro- 
vided. For to us, from the spread of our race all over the world, 
the ])revention of acute infectious diseases is more important than to 
any other nation. At the beginning of this address I urged the claims 
of pure science. If I could, I should feel inclined to speak even more 
strongly of the application of science to the discovery of the causes of 
acute diseases. May 1 express the hope that the effort which is now

being' made to establish in Euglaiid an institution for this ])urpose, not 
interior in elilicieney to thoseof other countries, may have the sympathy 
of all present? And now may 1 ask your attention for a few moments 
more to the subject that more immediately concerns usf 

CONCLUSION. 

The purpose which I have had in view has been to show that there 
is one principle — that of adaptation — which separates biology from the 
exact sciences, and that in the vast field of biological inquiry the end 
we have is not merely, as in natural philosophy, to investigate the rela- 
tion between the phenomenon and the antecedent and concomitant con- 
ditions on which it dei>ends, but to ])ossess this knowledge in constant 
reference to the interest of the organism. It may i)erhaps be thought 
that this way of putting it is too teleological, and that in taking-, as it 
were, as my text this evening so old-fashioned a biologist as Trevira- 
nus, I am yielding to a retrogressive tendency. It is not so. What I 
have desired to insist on is that organism is a fact which encounters the 
biologist at every step in his investigations; that in referring it to any 
general biological principle, such as adaptation, we are only referring it 
to itself, not explaining it; that no explanation will be attainable until 
the conditions of its coming into existence can be subjected to experi- 
mental investigation so as to correlate them with those of i:)iocesses in 
the non-living world. 

Those who were present at the meeting of the British Association at 
Liverpool, will remember that then, as well as at some subsequent 
meetings, the question whether the conditions necessary' for such an 
inquiry could be realized was a burning one. This is no longer the 
case. The i)atient endeavors which were made about that time to 
obtain experimental proof of what was called ^(/>iof/ewesis, although they 
conduced materially to that better knowledge which we now possess of 
the conditions of life of bacteria, failed in the accomplishment of their 
purpose. The question still remains undetermined; it has, so to speak, 
been adjourned sine Me. The only approach to it lies at present in the 
investigation of those rare instances in which, alth<mgh the relations 
bettveen a living organism audits environment ceases as a watch stops 
when it has not been wound, these relations can be re-established — the 
process of life re-awakened — by the application of the required stinuilus. 

I was also desirous to illustrate the relation between physiology and 
its two neighbors on either side, natural philosophy (including chemis- 
try), and psychology. As regards the latter, I need add nothing- to 
what has already been said. As regards the former, it may be well to 
notice that, although physiology can never become a mere branch of 
applied physics or chemistry, there are parts of physiology wherein the 
principles of these sciences may be applied directly. Thus, in the 
beginning of the century, A'oung applied his investigations as to the 
movements of liquids in a system of elastic tubes directly to the phe-

noiiieiia of the ciiculatioii; and a centiiiy before, Dorelli successfully 
exaiuiued tlie inecLauisiiis of locomotion and the action of muscles, 
without reference to any, excepting mechanical principles. Similarly, 
the foundation of our present knowledge of the j)rocess of nutrition was 
laid in the researches of Bidder and Schniidt, in 1851, by determina- 
tions of the weight and composition of the body, the daily gain of 
weight by food or oxygen, the daily loss by tbe respiratory and other 
discharges, all of which could be accomplished by chemical means. 
But in by far the greater number of physiological investigations, both 
methods (the physical or chemical and the physiological) must be 
brought to bear on the same question — to co-operate for the elucidation 
of the same problem. In the researches, for example, which during 
several years have occupied Prof. Bohr, of Copenhagen, relating to the 
exchange of gases in respiration, he has shown that factors purely 
physical — namely, the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide 
in the blood which flows through the pulmonary capillaries — are, so to 
speak, interfered with in their action by the "specific energy" of the 
pulmonary tissue in such a way as to render this fundamental process, 
which, since Lavoisier, has justly been regarded as one of the most 
important in physiology, much more complicated than we for a long 
time supposed it to be. In like manner Ileidenhain has j)roved that 
the process of lymphatic absorption, which before we regarded as 
dependent on purely mechanical causes — i. e., differences of pressure — is 
in great measure due to the specific energy of cells, and that in various 
processes of secretion the principal partis not, as we were inclined not 
many years ago to believe, attributable to liquid diffusion, but to the 
same agency. I wish that there had been time to have told you some- 
thing of the discoveries which have been made in this particular field 
by IVIr. Langley, who has made the subject of '' specific energy" of 
secreting cells his own. It is in investigations of this kind, of which 
any number of examples could be given, in which vital reactions mix 
themselves up with physical and chemical ones so intimately that it is 
difficult to draw the line between them, that the physiologist derives 
most aid from whatever chemical and physical training he may be 
fortunate enough to possess. 

There is therefore no doubt as to the advantages which physiology 
derives from the exact sciences. It coidd scarcely be averred that they 
would benefit in anything like the same degree from closer association 
with the science of life. Nevertheless there arc some points in respect 
of which that science may have usefully contributed to the advance- 
ment of physics or of chemistry. The discovery of Graham as to the 
characters of colloid substances and as to the diffusion of bodies in 
solution through membranes would never have been made had not 
Graham " plowed," so to speak, "with our heifer." The relations of 
certain coloring matters to oxygen and carbon dioxide would have been 
unknown had no experiments been made on the respiration of animals

ami the assimilative, process in plants; and, similarly, tbe vast amonnt 
of knowledge which relates to the chemical action of ferments must be 
claimed as of physiological origin. So, also, there are methods, both 
physical and chemical, which were originally devised for physiological 
purposes. Thus the method by which meteorological phenomena are 
continuously recorded graphically originated from that used by Lud- 
wig (1847) in his " Researches on the Circulation;" the mercurial pump, 
invented by Lothar Meyer, was perfected in the physiological labora- 
tories of Bonn and Leipsic; the rendering the galvanometer needle 
aperiodic by dami>ing was first realized by du Bois-Reymond — in all of 
which cases invention was prompted by the requirements of physiologi- 
cal research. 

Let me conclude with one more instance of a diiferent kind, which 
may serve to show how perhaps the wonderful ingenuity of contrivance 
which is displayed in certain organized structures — the eye, the ear, or 
the organ of voice — may be of no less interest to the physicist than to 
the ])hysioh>gist. Johannes Midler, as is well known, explained the 
compound eye of insects on the theory that an erect picture is formed 
on the convex retina by the combination of pencils of light received 
from different parts of the visual field through the eyelets (oinmatidia) 
directed to them. Years afterwards it was sliown that in each eyelet 
an image is formed which is reversed. Consequently the mosaic theory 
of Miiller was for a long period discredited on the ground that an erect 
picture cimld not be made up of " upside-down '' images. Lately the 
subject has been re-investigated, with the result that the mosaic theory 
has regained its authority. Prof. Exiier* has proved photographically 
that behind each part of the insect's eye an erect picture is formed of 
the objects towards which it is directed. There is therefore no longer 
any difficulty in mnh'rstandiug how the whole field of vision is mapped 
out as coivsistently as it is imaged on our own retina, with the differ- 
ence, of course, that the jjicture is erect. But behind this fact lies a 
physical fjuestion — that of the relation between the erect picture which 
is photographed and the optical structure of the crystal cones which 
produce it — a question which, although we can not now enter upon it, 
is quite as interesthig as the physiological one. 

With this history of a theory which, after having been for thirty 
years disbelieved, has been re-instated by the fortunate combination of 
methods derived from the two sciences, I will conclude. It may serve 
to show how, though physiology can never become a part of natural 
philosophy, the questions we have to deal with are cognate. Without 
forgetting that every phenomenon has to be regarded with reference 
to its useful imrpose in the organism, the aim of the physiologist is not 
to inquire into final causes, but to investigate processes. His question 
is ever How rather than Why.

May I illustrate this by a simple, i^erhaps too trivial, story, wliicli 
derives its interest from its having been told of the childhood of one 
of the greatest natural philosophers of the present century?* He was 
even then possessed by that insatiable curiosity which is the first 
quality of the investigator, and it is related of him that his habitual 
question was, " What is the go of it"?^' and, if the answer was unsatis- 
factory, "What is the particular go of it?" That north country boy 
became Prof Clerk Maxwell. The questions he asked are those which, 
in our various ways, we are ail trying to answer.

FIELJ> STUDY IN ORNITHOLOGY.* 



By H. B. Tristram, F. R. S. 



It is difficult for the mind to grasp the advance in biological science 
(I use the term biology in its wide etymological, not its recently 
restricted sense) which has taken i^lace since I first attended the 
meetings of the British Association, some forty years ago. In those 
days the now familiar expressions of ''natural selection," 'Msolation," 
" the struggle for existence," "the survival of the fittest," were unheard 
of and unknown, though many an observer was busied in culling the 
facts which were being poured into the lap of the philosopher who 
should mold the first g^reat epoch in natural science since the days 
of Linuicus. 

It is to the importance and value of field observation that 1 would 
venture in the first place to direct your attention. 

My predecessors in this chair have been, of recent years, distin- 
guished men who have searched deeply into the abstrusest mysteries 
of physiology. Thither I do not presume to follow them. I ratlier 
come before you as a survivor of the old-world naturalist, as one 
whose researches have been, not in the laboratory or with the micro- 
scope, but on the wide desert, the mountain side, and the isles of the 
sea. 

This year is the centenary of the death of Gilbert White, whom we 
may look upon as the father of field naturalists. It is true that Sir T. 
Browne, Willughby, and Eay had each, in the middle of the seventeenth 
century, committed various observations to print; but though Wil- 
lughby, at least, recognized the importance of the soft parts in afford- 
ing a key to classification, as well as the osteology, as maybe seen from 
his observation of the ]>ccnliar formations, in the Divers [Colymhida) of 
the tibia, with its prolonged procnemial process, of which he has given 
a figure, or his description of the elongation of the posterior branches 
of the woodpecker's tongue, as well as by his careful description of the 
intestines of all specimens which came under his notice in the flesh,

noue of these systeiiuitically noted tli<' habits of birds ai)ait from an 
occasional mention of their niditication, and very rarely do they even 
describe the eggs. Bat White was the first observer to recognize how 
mneh may be learned fioiii the life habits of birds. He is generally 
content with recording his observations, leaving to others to speculate. 
Fond of Mrgilian quotations (he was a fellow of Oriel of the last cen- 
tury), his ([uotations are often made with a view to prove the scrupu 
lous accura(-y of tlie Koman poet, as tested by his (White's) own obser- 
vations. 

In an age incredulous as to that Avhich appears to break the uni- 
formity of natuic, but quick to recognize all the i)henomeua of life, a 
contrast arises before the mind's eye between the abiding strength of 
the objective method, wliich brings Gilbert Wliite in touch with the 
great writers whose works are for all time aud the transient feebleness 
of the modern introspective philosophies, vexed with the i)rob]ems of 
psychology. The modern psychologist propounds his theory of man 
aud the universe, and we read him and go on our way, aud straightway 
forget. Herodotus and Thucydides tell a plain tale in plain language, 
or the Curate of iSelborue shows us the hawk on the wing, or the snake 
in the grass, as he saw them day by day, and somehow the sinqjle story 
lives and moves him who reads it long alter the subtleties of this or 
that philosophical theory have had their day aud passed iuto the limbo 
of oblivion. But, invaluable as has been the exampleof Gilbert White 
iu teaching us how to observe, his field was a very narrow one, circum- 
scribed for the most part by the boundaries of a single parish, and on 
the subject of geographical distribution (as we know it now) he could 
contribute nothing, a subject on which even the best explorers of that 
day were strangely inobservant aud inexact. 

AVIAN DISTRIBUTION. 

A century and a lialf ago, it had not come to be recognized that dis- 
tribution is (along of course with morphology and i^hysiology) a most 
important factor iu determining the facts of biology. It is difficult to 
estinuite what might have been gained in the case of many species, now 
irreparably lost, had Forster aud the other companions of Capt. Cook, 
to say nothing of many previous voyagers, had the slightest conception 
of the importance of noting the exact locality of each specimen they 
collected. They seem scarcely to have recognized the specific distinc- 
tions of the characteristic genera of the Pacific Islands at all, or if they 
did, to have dismisse<l them Avith the remark, "On this island was 
found a flycatcher, a pigeon, or a parrot similar to those found in New 
Holland, but with white tail feathers instead of black, an orange instead 
of a scarlet breast, or red shoulders instead of yellow." As we turn 
over the pages of Latham or Shaw, how often do we find for locality 
one of the islands of the South Sea, and, even where the locality is 
given, subsecpient research has x)rovedit erroneous, as though the speci-

mens liud been .snbseqiieiitly ticketed; Le Vaillaiit described uiaiiy of 
his South African birds from memory. Thus Latham, after describing 
very accurately h'hipidiira Jiahellifcra, from the soutli ishmd of New 
Zeahind, remarks, apparently on Forster's authority, that it is subject 
to variation; that in the island of Tanna another was met with, with a 
different tail, etc., and that there was another variety in the collection 
of Sir Joseph Banks. Endless perplexity has been caused by the Psit- 
tacii.sj^Hf/Difvus of (Imelin (of which Latham's type is at Vienna) being 
stated in the inventory as from I>otauy Bay, by Latham from Otaheite, 
and in his book as inhabiting several of the islands of the South Seas, 
and now it proves to be the female Psittaeus palmarnm from the New 
Hebrides. These are but samples of the confusion caused by the inac- 
curacies of the old voyagers. Had there been in the first crew who 
landed on the island of Bourbon, I will not say a naturalist, but even a 
simple-hearted Leguat, to tell the artless tale of what he saw, or had 
there been among the Portuguese discoverers of Mauritius one who 
couhl note and describe the habits of its birds with the accuracy with 
which a Poulton could record the ways and doings of our Lepidoptera, 
how vastly would ourknowledgeof a perished fauna have been enriched ! 
It is only since we learned from Darwin and Wallace the power of iso- 
lation in the differentiation of species, that special attention has been 
Ijaid to the peculiarities of insular forms. Here the field naturalist 
comes in as the helpful servant of the philosopher and the systematist, 
by illustrating the operation of isolation in the differentiation of siDCcies. 
I may take the typical examples of two groups of oceanic islands, dif- 
fering as widely as possible in their position on the globe — the Sand- 
wich Lslauds, in the center of the Pacific, thousands of miles from the 
nearest continent, and the Canaries, within sightof the African coast — 
but agreeing in origin, the ocean depths close to the Canaries and 
between the different islands varying from 1,500 to 2,000 fathoms. In 
the one we may study the expiring relics of an avifauna completely dif- 
ferentiated by isolation ; in the other we have the opportunity of trac- 
ing theincipient stages of the same process. 

The Sandwich Islands have long been known as possessing an avi- 
fauna not surpassed in interesting j)eculiarity by that of New Zealand 
or Madagascar; in fact, it seems as though their vast distance from 
the continent had intensified the inflviences of isolation. There is 
scarcely a passerine bird in its indigenous fauna which can be referred 
to any genus known elsewhere. But until the very recent researches 
of Mr. Scott Wilson and the explorations of the Hon. W. Kothschild's 
collectors it was not known that almost every island of the group pos- 
sessed one or more representatives of each of these peculiar genera. 
Thus every island which has been thoroughly explored, and in which 
any extent of the primeval forest remains, possesses or has possessed 
its ow n peculiar species of Hemujmtthus, Hiniatione, Phcvornis, Acriilo- 
cercm^ Loxops, Brepanis^ as well as of the massive-beaked finches,

wbich emulate the Geoftpisa of the Galapagos. Prof. Newton has shown 
that while the greater number of those are probably of Anierican origin, 
yet the South Pucitic has contributed its (juota to this museum oforni- 
tholOj;ieal rarities, which JNfr. Clarke very justly proposes to make a 
distincjt biological subregioii. 

That each of the islands of tliis group, how<'ver small, should i)(>s- 
sess a tlora specifically distinct suggests thoughts of the vast X)eriods 
occuj>ied in their difterentiation. 

In the Canary Islands, either because they are geologically more 
recent or because of their proximity to the African coast, which has 
focilitated frequent immigrations from the continent, the process of 
ditt'erentiation is only partially accomplished. Yet there is scarcely a 
resident s[»ecies which is not more or less modified, and this modifica- 
tion is yet further advanced in the westernmost islands than in those 
nearest to Africa. In Fuertaventura and Lanzarote, waterless and 
treeless, there is little change, and the fauna is almost identical with 
that of the neighbouring Sahara. There is a whinchat, Pratincola 
dacoiUv^ discovered by my companion, Mr. Meade- Waldo, peculiar to 
Fuertaventura, which may i>ossibly be fouiul on the opposite coast, 
though it has not yet been met with by any collectors there. Now, our 
whinchat is a common winter visitant all down the West African coast, 
and it seems probable that isolation has i)roduced the very marked 
characters of the Canaries form, while the continental individuals have 
been restrained from variation by their frequent association with their 
migratory relations. A similar cause may explain why the blackbird, 
an extremely common resident in all the Canary Islands, has not been 
modified in the least, since many migratory individuals of the same 
si)ecies sojourn every winter in the islands. Or take the blue titmouse. 
Our familiar resident is replaced along the coast of North Africa by a 
representative species. Partis vltra-niarinns^ differentiated chiefiy l)y a 
black instead of a blue cap and a slate-colored instead of a green back. 
The titmouse of Lanzarote and Fuertaventura is barely separable from 
that of Algeria, but is much smaller and paler, probably owing to 
scarcity of food and a> dry desert climate. Passing 100 miles farther 
to sea, to Grand Canary, we find in the woods and forests a bird in all 
respects similar to the Algerian in color and dimensions, with one 
exception: the greater wing coverts of the Algerian are tipped with 
white, forming a broad bar when the wing is closed. This, present in 
the Fuertaventura form, is represented in the Canarian by the faintest 
white tips, and in the birds from the next islands, Tenerifte and Gomera, 
this is altogether absent. This form has been recognized as Parns 
tencriffa\ Proceeding to the northwest outermost island, Palnia, we 
find a very distinct species, with different proportions, a longer tail, 
and white abdomen instead of yellow. In the ultinui Thule, Ilierro, 
we find a second very distinct species, resembling that of Tenerifte in 
the absence of the wing bar, and in all other respects, except that the 



FIELD STUDY IN ORNITHOLOGY. 469 

back is greeu, like the European, instead of slate, as iu all tlio other 
species. Thus we find in this group a uniform graduation of variation 
as we proceed further from the cradle of the race. 

A similar series of modifications may be traced in the chafifinch {Frin- 
gilla), which has been in like manner derived from the North African 
F. sjjodiogena, and in which the extreme variation is to be found in the 
westernmost islands of Talma and Hierro. The willow wren {Phi/llos- 
copus trochilus), extremely numerous and resident, has entirely changed 
its habits, though not its plumage, and I have felt justified in distin- 
guishing it as Ph.forfioiatus. In iijote and habits it is entirely different 
from our bird, and though it builds a domed nest it is always near the 
top of lofty trees, most frequently in palm trees. The only external 
difference from our bird consists in its paler tarsi and more rounded 
wing, so that its power of flight is weaker, but, were it not for the 
marked difference in his habits and voice, I should have hesitated to 
differentiate it. Jn the kestral and the great spotted woodpecker 
there are differences which suggest incipient species, while the forests 
of the wooded western islands yield two very peculiar pigeons, differ- 
ing entirely from each other in their habits, both probably derived 
from our woodpigeon, but even further removed from it than the 
Columba trocaz of Madeira, and by their dark chestnut coloration sug- 
gesting that peculiar food, in this case the berries of the tree laurel, 
has its full share in the differentiation of isolated forms. If we remem- 
ber the variability of the pignu'uts in the food of birds and the amount 
absorbed and transferred to the skin and plumage, the variability iu 
the tints and patterns of many animals can be more readily under- 
stood. 

One other bird deserves notice, the Caccahis, or red-legged partridge, 
for here, and here alone, we have chronological data. The Spaniards 
introduced Caecahis rnfa into Canary and C. pcfrosa into Teneriffe and 
Gomera, and they have never spread from their respective localities. 
Now, both species, after a residence of only four hundred years, have 
become distinctly modified. C. rufa was introduced into the Azores 
also, and changed exactly in the same manner, so much so that Mr. 
Godmau, some years ago, would have described it as distinct, but that 
the only specimen he procured was iu molt and mutilated, and his 
specimen proved identical with the Cauariau bird. Besides minor dif- 
ferences, the back is one-fourth stouter and longer than in the P^uro- 
pean bird, and the tarsus very much stouter and longer, and the back 
is gray rather than russet. The gray back harmonizes with the vol- 
canic dark soil of the rocks of the Canaries, as the russet does with 
the clay of the plains of England aud France. In the Canaries the 
bird lives under different conditions from those of Europe, It is on 
the mountain sides and among rocks that the stouter beak and 
stronger legs are iudispensiible to its vigorous existence. It is need- 
less to go into the details of many other species. We have here the

effect of changed conditions of life in fonr bnndred years. What may 
they not have been in fonr lumdred centnrics? We have the resnlt of 
peculiar food in the pigeons and of isolation in all the cases I have 
mentioned. Such fa(;ts can only be supplied to the generalizer and 
the systematist through the accurate and minute observations of the 
field naturalist. 

The character of theavi-faunaof the Comoro Islands, to take another 
insular group, seems to stand midway in the dift'erentiating process 
between the Canaries and the Sandwich Islands. From the researches 
of M. Ilumblot, worked out by MM. Milne-Edwards and Oustalet, we 
find that there .are 29 species acknowledged as peculiar; 2 species from 
South Afiica and 22 from Madagascar in process of specification, called 
by M. Milne-Edwards secondary, or derived, species. 

The little Christmas Island, an isolated rock 200 miles south of Java, 
only 12 miles in length, has been shown by Mr. Lister to produce dis- 
tinct and peculiar forms of every class of life, vegetable and animal. 
Though the species are few in number, yet every mammal and land 
bird is endemic; but, as Darwin remarks, to ascertain whether a small 
isolated area or a large open area like a continent has been more fav- 
orable for the i^roduction of new organic forms, we ought to make the 
comparison between equal times, and this we are inca])able of doing. 
My own attention was first directed to this subject when, in the year 
1857-'58, I spent many months in the Algerian Sahara, aud noticed the 
remarkable variations in difi'erent groups according to elevation from 
the sea and the difi'erence of soil and vegetation. The Origin of 
Species had not then appeared, but on my return my attention was 
called to the communication of Darwin and AVallace to the Linn<ean 
Society on the tendencies of species to form varieties and on the per- 
petuation of varieties and s^^cies by means of natural selection. I then 
wrote {Ibis, ISoO, pp. 420-433): 

" It is hardly possible, I should think, to illustrate this theory better 
than by the larks and chats of North Africa. In all these, in the con- 
gen<'rs of the wheatear, of the rock chat, of the crested laik, we trace 
gradual modifications of coloration and of anatomical structure, deflect- 
ing by very gentle gradations from the ordinary type, but when we take 
the extremes presenting the most marked differences. - - - In the 
desert, where neither trees, brushwood, nor even undulations of sur- 
face aftbrd the slightest protection to an animal from its foes, a modi 
tication of colors, Avhicli shall be assimilated to that of the surround- 
ing country, is absolutely necessary. Hence, without exception, the 
upper plumage of every bird — whether lark, chat, sylvan, or land 
grouse — and also the fur of all the small mammals and the skin of all 
the snakes and lizards, is of the uniform isabellineor sand color. It is 
very possible that some further purpose may be served by the prevail- 
ing colors, but this apj^ears of itself a sufticient ex])lanation. Tliere 
are individual varieties of depth of hue annrng all creatures. In the 
struggle for life which we know to be going on among all species a very 
slight change for the better, such as iin])roved means of escai)e from its 
natural enemies (which would be the effect of an alteration from aeon- 



FIELD STUDY IN ORNITHOLOGY. 471 

.spicuoiTS color to one resembling the line of the snrronndino- objects), 
wonld give the variety that possessed it a decided advantage over the 
typical or other forms of the species. - - - To apply the theory to 
the case of the Sahara. If the Algerian desert were colonized by a 
few pairs of crested larks — imfti^Ji' aside the ascertained fact of the 
tendency of an arid, hot climate to bleacdi all dark colors — we know 
that the probability is that one or two pairs wonld be likely to be of a 
darker complexion than the others. These and snch of the offspring 
as most resemlded them wonld become more liable to captnre by their 
natural enemies — liawk^ and carnivorous beasts. The lighter colored 
ones would enjoy more or less immunity from such attacks. Let this 
state of things continue for a few hundred years and the dark-colored 
individuals would be exterimated, the light-colored remain and inherit 
the land. This process, aided by the above-mentioned tendency of the 
climate to bleach the coloration still more, would, in a few centuries, 
produce the GaJerida aht/.ssiiiica as the typical form ; audit must be 
noted that between it and the European (J. cristatu there is no distinc- 
tion but that of color. 

"But when we turn to Galerida isaheUlna, 0. arenicola, and G. mac- 
rorhyncha, we have differences lu^t oidy of color, but of structure. 
These differences are most marked in the form of the bill. Now, to 
take the two former first, G. areniroJa has a very long bill, G. isabdlina 
a very short one. The former resorts exclusively to the deep, loose, 
sandy tracts; the latter haunts the hard and rocky districts. It is man- 
ifest that a bird whose food has to be sought for in deep sand derives 
a great advantage from any elongation, however slight, of its bill. The 
other, who feeds among stones and rocks, requires strength rather than 
length. We know that even in the type species the size of the bill 
varies in individuals — in the lark as well as in the snipe. Now, in the 
desert the shorter-billed varieties would undergo comi)arative difficulty 
in finding food where it was not abundant, and consequently Avould not 
be m such vigorous condition as their longer-billed relation. In the 
breeding season, therefore, they would have fewer eggs and a weaker 
progeny. Often, as we know, a weakly bird will abstain from mat- 
rimony altogether. The natural result of these causes would be that 
in course of time the longest-billed variety would steadily predominate 
over the shorter, and in a few centuries they Mould be the sole exist- 
ing race, their shorter-billed fellows dying out until that race is extinct. 
The converse will still hold good of the stout billed and weaker-billed 
varieties in a rocky district. 

"- Here are only two causes enumerated which might serve to create, 
as it were, a new species from an old one. Yet they are ])erfectly nat- 
ural causes, and snch as I think nuTSt have occurred and are possibly 
occurring still. We know so very little of the causes which, in the major- 
ity of cases, make species rare or common that there may be hundreds 
of others at work, some even more powerful than these, wliich go to per- 
petuate and eliminate certain forms ' according to natural means of 
selection.'" 

It would appear that those species in continental areas are equally 
liable to variation with those which are isolated in limited areas, yet 
that there are many counteracting infiuences which operate to check 
this tendency. It is often assumed, where we find closely allied species 
apparently interbreeding at the center of their area, that the blend- 
ing of forms is caused by the two races commingling. Judging from 



472 FIELD STUDY IN ORNITHOLOGY. 

iusular expeiieiice, I .should be iuclined to believe that the theory of 
interbreeding is beginning at tlie wrong end, but rather that, while 
the generalized forms remain in the center of distribution, we find 
more decidedly distinct species at the extremes of the range, caused 
not by interbreeding, but by differentiation. To illustrate this by the 
group of the blue titmouse. We find iu Central Russia, in the center 
of distribution of tlie family, the most generalized form, Fariis 2>Jcslii, 
partaking of the characters of the various species east, west, and south. 
In the northeast and north it becomes differentiated as P. cyaneus; to 
the southwest and south into P. cfvndcKs ami its various subsi)ecies, 
while a branch extending due east has assumed the form of Pjiavipec- 
ens, bearing traces of affinity to its neigld»or P. vyanens in the north, 
which seems evidently to have been derived from it. 

But the scoi>e of tield observation does not cease with geographical 
distribution and modification of form. The closest systematist is very 
apt to overlook or to take no count of habits, voice, modification, and 
other features of life which have an important bearing on the modifica- 
tion of species. To take one instance, the short-toed lark {Calandrella 
hraehydartyla) is spread over the countries bordering on the Mediterra- 
nean; but along with it, in x\ndalusia alone is found another species, 
Cal. b(vti(la, of a rather darker color, and with the secondaries generally 
somewhat shorter. Without further knowledge than that obtained from 
a comparison of skins, it might be put down as an accidental variety. 
But the field naturalist soon recognizes it as a most distinct species. 
It has a different voice, a differently shaped nest; and, wlnle the com- 
mon species breeds iu the i^lains, this one always resorts to the hills. 
Tlie Spanish shei^herds on the spot recognize their distinctness, and 
have a name for each species. Take, again, the eastern form of the 
common song thrush. The bird of North China, Turdus auritus, closely 
resembles our familiar species, but is slightly larger, and there is a 
minute difference in the wing formula. But the field naturalist has 
ascertained that it lays eggs like those of the missel-thrush, and it is 
the only species closely allied to our bird which does not lay eggs of a 
blue ground color. The hedge accentor of Japan {AocoUor ruhidufi) is 
distinguished from our most familiar friend, Accentor modnlari'^, by 
delicate differences of hue. But, though in gait and manner it closely 
resembles it, I was suri)rised to fine the Japanese bird strikingly dis- 
tinct in habits and life, being found only in forest and brushwood sev- 
eral thousand feet above the sea. I met with it first at Chinsenze— 
(),000 feet, before the snow had left the ground, and in summer it goes 
higher still, but never descends to the cultivated land. If biTth species 
are derived, as seems probable, from Accentor immaculatus of the Hima- 
layas, then the contrast in habits is easily exj^laiued. The lofty moun- 
tain ranges of Japan have enabled the settlers there to retain their 
original habits, for which our humbler elevations have afforded no 
scope.

B*R1) MIGRATION. 

On the solution of the probh'ui of the migration of birds, the most 
remarkable of all the phenomena of animal life, mueh less aid has been 
contributed by the observations of held naturalists that miglit reasona- 
bly have been expected. The facts of migration have, of course, been 
recognized from the earliest times, and have afforded a theme for 
Hebrew and Greek poets three thousand years ago. Theories which 
would explain it are rife enough, but it is only of late years that any 
systematic effort has been made to classify and summarize the thou- 
sands of data and notes which are needed in order to draw any satis- 
factory conclusion. The observable facts may be classified as to their 
bearing on the whither, when, and how, of migration, and after this we 
may possibly arrive at a true answer to the Why? Observation has 
sufficiently answered the first question, Whither? 

There are scarcely any feathered denizens of earth or sea to the 
summer and winter ranges of which Ave can uot now point. Of almost 
all the birds of the holo-arctic iauna, we have ascertained the breed- 
ing places and the winter resorts. ISfow that the knot and the sander- 
liug have been successfully pursued even to Grinnell l^and, there 
remains but the curlew sandpiper ( Tringa s)(har<[)i((ta), of all the known 
European birds, whose breeding ground is a virgin soil, to be trodden, 
let us hope, in a successful exploration by Nansen, on one side or other 
of the Xorth Pole. Equally clearly ascertained are the winter quarters 
of all the migrants. The most casual observer can not fail to notice in 
any part of Africa, north or soutli, west coastor interior, the myriads of 
familiar species which winter there. As to the time of migration, the 
earliest notes of field naturalists have been the records of the dates of 
arrival of the feathered visitors. We possess them for some localities, 
as for Norfolk by the Marsham family, so far back fls 1736. In recent 
years these observations hnve been carried out on a larger and more 
systematic scale by Middendorf, who, forty years ago, devoted himself 
to the study of the lines of migration in the Russian Empire, tracing 
what he called the isopipfescs, the lines of similtaneous arrival of particu- 
lar species, and by I'rof. Palmen, of Finland, who, twenty years later, 
pnrsued a sinular course of investigation; and by Prof. Baird on the 
migration of North American birds ; and subsequently by Severtzoff as 
regards central Asia, and Menzbier as regards eastern Europe. As 
respects our own coasts, a vast mass of statistics has been collected by 
the labors of the migration committee appointed by the British Asso- 
ciation in 1S80, for wiiich our thanks are due to the indefatigable zeal 
of Mr. John Cordeaux and his colleague Mr. John Ilarvie Brown, the 
originators of the scheme by which the hght-houses were for nine years 
used as posts of observation on migration. The reports of that com- 
mittee are familiar to us, but the inferences are not yet worked out. I 
can not but regret that the committee has been allowed to drop. Prof. 



474 FIELD STUDY IN ORNITHOLOGY. 

W. W, Cooke has been carrying on siniijar observations in the Missis- 
sippi Valley, and others, too numerous to mention, have done the same 
elsewhere. But, as Prof. Newton has truly said, all these efforts may 
be said to pale before the stupendous amount of information amassed 
during more than liftiy years by the venerable Herr Giitke, of Heligo- 
land, whovse work we earnestly desire may soon appear in an English 
version. 

We have, through the labors of the writers I have named, and many 
others, arrived at a fair knowledge of *he When ? of migration. Of the 
Howl w^e have ascertained a little, but very little. The lines of migra- 
tion vary widely in different species, and in different longitudes. The 
theory of migration being directed toward the magnetic pole, first 
started by Middendorff', seems to be refuted by Baird, who has shown 
that in North America the theory will not hold. Yet, m some instances, 
there is evidently a converging tendency in northward migrations. 
The line, according to Middendorff, in middle Siberia is due north, in 
eastern Siberia southeast to northwest, and in western Siberia from 
southwest to northeiist. In Euroi)ean Ivussia Menzbier traces four 
northward routes: (1) A coast line coming up from Norway round the 
North Cape to Nova Zembla. (2) The Baltic line with bifurcation, one 
l)roceeding by the Gulf of Bothnia, and the other by the Oulf of Fin- 
land, which is afterwards again subdivided. (3) A Black Sea line, 
reaching nearly as far north as the valley of the Petchora; and (4) the 
Caspian line, ])iissing up tke Volga, and reaching as far east as the val- 
ley of the Obi by other anastomosing streams. 

Palm^n has endeavored to trace the lines of migration on the return 
autumnaljourney in the Eastern Hemisphere, and has arranged them in 
nine routes: (1) From Nova Zembla, round the west of Norway, to the 
British Isles. (2) From Spitzbergen, by Norway, to Britain, France, 
Portugal, and West Africa. (3) From North Eussia, by the Gulf of 
Finland, Ilolstein, and Holland, and then bifurcating to the west coast 
of France on the one side, and on the other up the Rhine to Italy and 
North Africa. {4a) Down the Volga by the Sea of Azof, Asia Minor, 
and Egypt, while the other portion {Ah), trending east, passes by the 
Caspian and Tigris to the Persian (iulf, (o) By the YencvSei to Lake 
Baikal and Mongolia. (6) By the Lena on to the Amoor and Japan. 
(7) From East Siberia to the Corea and Japan. (8) Kamschatka to 
Japan and the Chinese coast. (0) From Gi^eenland, Iceland, and the 
Farohs, to Britain, where it joins line 2. 

All courses of rivers of importance from minor routes, and consider- 
ation of these lines of migration might serve to ex])lain the fact of North 
American stragglers, the waifs and strays which have fallen in with 
great flights of the regular migrants and been more frequently shot on 
the east coavst of England and Scotland than on tbe west coast or in 
Ireland. They have not crossed the Atlantic, but have come from the 
far north, where a very slight deflection east or west might alter their 



FIELD STUDY IN ORNITHOLOGY. 475 

whole course, and in that case they wouhl naturally strike either Ice- 
land or the west coast of Norway, and in either case would reach the 
east coast of Britain. But, if by storms, and the prevailing winds of 
the jSTorth Atlantic coming- from the west, they had been driven out of 
their usual course, they would strike the coast of Norway, and so find 
their way hither in the company of their congeners. 

As to the elevation at which migratory flights are carried on, Herr 
Gatke, as well as many American observers, holds that it is generally 
far above our ken, at least in normal conditions of the atmosphere, and 
that the opportunities of observation, apart from seasons and unusual 
atmospheric disturbance, are confined chiefly to unsuccessful and abor- 
tive attempts. It is maintained that the height of flight is some 1,500 
to 15,000 feet, and if this be so, as there seems every reason to admit, 
the aid of land bridges and river valleys becomes of very slight impor- 
tance. A tri: ial instance will illustrate this. There are two species of 
blue-throat, Ci/anreula suceica and C. huvocyanu ; the former with its 
red-breast patch is abundant in Sweden in summer, but is never found 
in Germany, except most accidentally, as the other is the common form 
of central Europe. Yet l)otli are abundant in Egypt and Syria, where 
they winter, a!id I have on several occasions obtained both species out 
of the same flock. Hence we infer that the Swedish bird makes its jour- 
ney from its winter quarters with scarcely ahalt, while the other proceeds 
leisurely to its nearer summer (piarters. On the other hand, I have 
more than once seen myriads of swallows, martins, sand-martins, and, 
later in the season, swifts, passing up the Jordan Valley and along the 
Bukoa of central Syria, at so slight an elevation that I was able to 
distinguish at once that th^ flight consisted of swallows or house-mar- 
tins. This was in perfectly calm, clear weather. One stream of swal- 
lows, certainly not less than a quarter of a mile wide, occupied more 
than half an liour in i)assing over one spot, and flights of house-martins, 
and then of sand-martins, the in-xt day, were scarcely less numerous. 
These flights nnist have been straight U]) from the Red Sea, and may 
have been the general assemldy of all those which had wintered in 
East Africa. I can not think that these flights were more than 1,000 
feet high. On the other hand, when standing on the highest peak in 
the island of Palma, 0,500 feet, with a dense mass of clouds beneath 
us, leaving nothing of land or sea visible, save the distant Peak of 
Tenerife, 1*5,000 feet, I have watched a flock of Cornish choughs soaring- 
above us, till at length they were absolutely indistinguishable by us 
excejit with field-glasses. 

As to the speed with which the migration flights are accomplished, 
they require much further observation. Herr Gatke maintains that 
godwits and plovers can fly at the rate of 210 miles an hour ( !), and 
the late Dr. Jerdon stated that tlie spine tailed swift {Aca^tln/Uis camla- 
cntus)j roosting in Ceylon, would reach the Himalayas (1,200 miles) 
before sunset. Certainly in their ordinary flight the swift is the only

l)ir(l I have ever noticed to outstrip an express train on the Great 
Northern llailway. 

Observation has shown us that, wliile there is a reguLir and uniform 
miiiration in the case of some species, yet that, beyond tliese, there 
comes a i)artial migration of some species, immigrants and emigrants 
simultaneously, and this, besides the familiar vertical emigration from 
higher to lower altitudes and rice rersa, as in the familiar instance of 
the lapwing and golden plover. There is still much scope for the field 
naturalist in observation of these partial migrations. There are also 
species in which some individuals migrate and some are sedentary, e. </., 
in the few primeval forests which still remain in the Caiiaiy Islands, 
and which are enshrouded in almost perpetual mist, the woodcock is 
sedentary and not uncommon. 1 have often put up the bird and seen 
the eggs; but in winter the number is vastly increased, and the visitors 
are easily to be distinguished from the residents by their lighter color 
and larger size. The resident never leaves the cover of the dense for- 
est, where the growth of ferns and shrubs is perpetual and fosters a 
moist, rich, semipeaty soil, in which the woodcock finds abundant food 
all the year, and has thus lost its migratory instincts. 

But why do birds migrate? Observation has brought to light many 
facts which seem to increase the difficulties of a satisfactory answer to 
the question. The autumnal retreat from the breeding quarters might 
be explained by a want of sufficient sustenance as winter approaches 
in the higher latitudes, but this will not account for the return migra- 
tion in the spring, since there is no perceptible diminution of supplies 
in the winter quarters. A friend of mine, who was for some time sta- 
tioned at an infirmary at Kikombo, on the high plateau southeast of 
Victoria Nyanza Lake, almost under the equator, where there is no 
variation in the seasons, wrote to me that from November to March the 
country* swarmed with swallows and martins, which seemed to the 
casual observer to consist almost wholly of our three sjtecies, though 
occasionally a few birds of different type might be noticed in the larger 
ffocks. Towards the end of March, without any observable change in 
climatic or atmospheric conditions, nine-tenths of the birds suddenly 
disappeared, and oidy a sprinkling remained. These, which had pre- 
A'iously been lost amid the myriad of winter visitants, seemed to consist 
of four species, of which I received specimens of two, Hirundo imella 
and H. soief/dlcnsis. One, described as white underneath, is probably 
H. a'tkiopicH; and the fourth, very small and quite black, must be a 
PsaHdoproene. All these remained through spring and summer. The 
northward movement of all the others must be through some imi)ulse 
not yet ascertained. In many other instances observation has shown 
that the impulse of movement is not dependent on the weather at the 
nu)ment. This is especially the case with sea birds. Prof. Newton 
observes that they can be trusted as the almanac itself. Foul weather 
or fair, heat or cold, the ])uffins, FrutercnJa arctica, rei)air to some of

tlieir stations punctiiall}^ on a given day, as if their movements were 
regulated by clock-work. In like manner, whether the summer be cold 
or hot, the swiftrS leave their summer home in England about the first 
week in August, only occasional stragglers ever being seen after that 
date. So in three different years I noticed the appearance of the com- 
mon swift {Gi/2>'^ehis apus) in myriads on one day in the first week in 
April. In the case of almost all the land birds it has been ascertained 
by repeated observations that the male birds arrive some days before 
the hens. I do not think it is proved that they start earlier; but being 
generally stronger than the females, it is very natural that they should 
outstrip their wejilcer mates. I think, too, that there is evidence that 
those species which have the most extended southerly, have also the 
most extended northerly range. The same may hold good of individ- 
uals of the same species, and may be accounted for by, or account for, 
the fact that, e. //., the individuals of the wheatear or the willow wren 
which penetrate farthest north have longer and stronger wings tlian 
those individuals which terminate their journey in more southern lati- 
tudes. The length of wing of two specimens of Saxicola amanthe in my 
collection from Greenland and Labrador exceeds by 0-G inch the length 
of the Briti.sh and Syrian specimens, and the next longest, exceeding 
them by 0-5 inch, is from the Gambia. So the sedentary rhylloscopus 
trockilns of the Canaries has a perceptibly shorter wing than European 
specimens. 

To say that migration is i^erformed by instinct is no explanation of 
the marvellous faculty; it is an evasion of the diflBculty. Prof. Mobius 
holds that birds crossing the ocean may be guided by observing the 
rolling of the waves, but this will not hold good in the varying storms 
of the Atlantic; still less in the vast stretch of stormy and landless 
ocean crossed by the bronze cuckoo {Chrysococcyx lucidna) in its pas- 
sage from ISTew Guinea to New Zealand. Prof. Palmen ascribes the due 
I)erformance of the fiight to experience, but this is not confirmed by 
field observers. He assumes that the flights are led by the oldest and 
strongest, but observation by Ilerr Gatke has shown that among 
migrants, as the young and old journey apart and by different routes, 
the former can have had no experience. All ornithologists are aware 
that the parent cuckoos leave this country long before their young ones 
are hatched by their foster-parents. The sense of sight can not guide 
birds which travel by night, or span oceans or continents in a single 
flight. In noticing all the phenomena of migration, there yet remains 
a vast unfilled region for the field naturalist. 

What Prof. Newton terms the sense of direction, unconsciously 
exercised, is the nearest approach yet made to a solution of the prob- 
lem. He remarks how vastly the sense of direction varies in human 
beings, contrasting its absence in the dwellers in towns compared with 
the power of the shepherd and the countryman, and, infinitely more, 
with the power of the savage or the Arab. He adduces the experience

of Midch'ii<l(»rff among- the Saniojeds, who know how to reach their 
goal by the shortest way tlirou.uli phices wholly strange to them. 
He had known it among dogs and horses (as we may constantly per- 
ceive), but was surprised to find the same incomprehensible animal 
faculty unweakened among uncivilized men. Nor could the Samojeds 
understand his inquiry how they did it. They disarmed him by the 
question, How now does the Arctic fox find its way aright on the tun- 
dra, and never go astray? And Middendorft' adds, "I was thrown 
back on the unconscious performance of an inherited animal faculty;" 
and so are we! 

There is one more kind of migration, of which we know nothing, and 
where the held naturalist has still abundant scope for the exercise of 
observation. I mean what is called exceptional migration — not the 
mere wanderings of waifs and strays, nor yet the uncertain travels of 
some species, as the crossbill in search of food, but the colonizing 
parties of many gregarious species, which generally, so far as we know 
in our own hemisi)here, tra\'el from east to west, or from southeast to 
northwest. Such are the waxwing {Ampelis garrnld), the pastor star- 
ling {Pastor 'rosciis), and Pallas's sand grouse, after intervals sometimes 
of many years, or sometimes for two or three years in succession. The 
waxwing will overspread western Europe in winter for a short time. 
It appears to be equally inconstant in its choice of summer quarters, 
as was shown by J. Wolley in Lapland. The rose ])astor regularly 
winters in India, but never remains to breed. For this piu-pose the 
whole race seems to collect and travel northwest, but rarely, or after 
intervals of many yciirs, returns to the same quarters. Yerona, 
Broussa, Smyrna, Odessa, the Dobrudscha have all during the last 
half century been visited for one sunuuer by tens of thousands, who 
are attracted by the visitations of locusts, on which they feed, rear 
their young, and go. These irruptions, however, can not be classed 
under the laws of ordinary migration. I^ot less inexplicable are such 
migrations as those of the African darter, which, though never yet 
observed to the north of the African lakes, contrives to pass, every 
spring, unobserved to the lake of Antiocli in North Syria, where I 
found a large colony rearing their young, which, so soon as their 
])rogeny was able to tly, disappeared to the southeast as suddenly as 
they had arrived. 

There is one possible explanation of the sense of direction uncon- 
sciously exercised, which I submit as a working hypothesis. We are 
all aware of the instinct, strong both in mammals and birds without 
exception, which attracts them to the place of their nativity. When 
the increasing cold of the northern regions, in which they all had their 
origin, drove the mammals southward, they could not retrace their 
steps, because the increasing polar sea, as the Arctic continent sank, 
barred their way. The birds reluctantly left their homes as winter 
came on, and followed the supply of food. But as the season in their 



FIELD STUDY IN ORNITHOLOGY. • 479 

uevr residence became hotter in summer, tbey instinctively returned to 
their birthplaces, and there reared their young, retiring with them 
when the recurring winter im[»elled them to seek a warmer climate. 
Those species which, nntitted for a greater amount of heat 'by their 
more protracted sojourn in the northern regions, persisted in re-visiting 
their ancestral homes, or getting as near to them as they could, retained 
a capacity for enjoying a temperate climate, which, very gradually, 
was lost by the species which settled down more iiernianently in their 
new quarters, and thus a law of migration became established on the 
one side, and sedentary habits on the other. 

MIMICRY. 

If there be one question on which the field naturalist may contri- 
bute — as lion's provider to the philosoiiher more than another, it is on 
the now much disputed topic of " mimicry," whether protective or 
aggressive. As Mr. Beddard has remarked on this i>ubject, "The field 
of hypothesis has no limits, and what we need is more study" — and, 
may w^e not add, more accurate observation of facts. The theory of 
protective mimicry was first propounded by Mr. H. W. Bates, from his 
observations on the Amazon, lie found that the grcnip of butterfiies, 
Heliconiida', conspicuously banded with yellow and black, were i^ro- 
vided with certain glands which secrete a nauseating fluid, supposed 
to render them unpalatal»le to birds. In the sand districts he found 
also similarly colored butterflies, belonging to the family Pieridoc^ 
which so closely resembled the others in shape and markings as to be 
easily mistaken for them, but which, unprovided with such secreting 
glands, were unprotected from the attacks of birds. The resemblance, 
he thought, was brought about by natural selection for the protection 
of the edible butterflies, through the birds mistaking them for the 
inedible kind. Other cases of mimicry among a great variety of insects 
have since been pointed out, and the theory of protective mimicry has 
gained many adherents. Among birds, many instances have been 
adduced. Mr. Wallace has described the extraordinary sinnlarity 
between birds of very different families, OrioUis hountenslH and Phile- 
mon moluccensis, both peculiar to the island of Bourn. Mr. H. O. Forbes 
has discovered a similar brown oriole, Ori()Jii,s dccijyiens, as closely 
imitating the appearance of the Philemon timorlaoenfiis of Timor-laut. 
A similar instance occurs in Geram. But Mr. Wallace observes that, 
while usually the mimicking species is less numeronsthan the mimicked, 
the contrary appears to be the case in Bourn, and it is diflicult to see 
what advantage has been gained by the mimicry. Now, all the species 
of Philemon are remarkably somber colored birds, and the mimicry 
can not be on their side. But there aie other brown orioles, more 
closely resembling those named, in other Moluccan islands, and yet 
having no resemblance to the Philemon of the same island, as may be 
seen in the case of the Oriolus pha'ochromus and Philemon gilolensis 



480 FIELD STUDY IN ORNITHOLOGY. 

from Gilolo. Yet the oriole lias adopted the same livery whicli else- 
where is a perfect mimicry. INIay it not therefore be that we have, in 
this group of bi'owii orioles, the original type of the family undifter- 
eiitiated? As they spread east and south we may trace the gradation, 
through the brown striaticm of the New (Juinea- bird to the brighter, 
green-tinged form of the West Australian and the green plumage of 
the Southern Aus^tralian, while westward the brilliant yellows of the 
numerous Indian and African species were developed, and another 
group, preferring high elevations, passing through the mountain ranges 
of Gava, Sumatra, and Borneo, intensified the aboriginal brown into 
black, and hence were evolved the deep reds of the various species 
which culminate in the crimson of Formosa, Oriolus <(rdcns, and the 
still deeper crimsons of 0. trailli of the Himalayas. 

It is possible that there may be similarity without mimicry, and, by 
the five laws of mimicry as laid down by Wallace, very many suggested 
cases must be eliminated. We all know that it is quite i^ossible to find 
between species of very different genera extraordinary similarity which 
is not mimetic. Take, for instance, the remarkable identity of colora- 
tion in the case of some of the African species Muvronijx and the 
American t>^tarneUa, or, again, of some of the African Campophafja' and 
the American Af/ehens. The outward resemblance occurs in both cases 
in the red as well as in the yellow-colored species of all four groups. 
But we find that the Macronyx of America and the Canipophaga' of 
Africa, in acquiiing this coloration, ha\ie departed widely fmmthe plain 
color found in their immediate relatives. If we applied Mr. Scudder's 
theory on insects, we must imagine that the prototype form has become 
extinct, while the juimicker has established its position. This is an 
hypothesis which is easier to suggest than either to prove or to disprove. 
Similar cases may frequently be found in botany. The strawberry is not 
indigenous in Japan, but in the mountains there I found a potentillain 
fruit which absolutely mimicked the Alpine strawberry in the minutest 
particulars, in its runners, its blossoms, and fruit ; but the fruit was simply 
dry pith, supporting the seeds and retaining its color without shrinking 
or falling from the stalks for weeks — a remarkable case, we can not say 
of unconscious mimicry, but of unconscious resemblance. jNIimicry in 
birds is comparatively rare, and still rarer in mammals, which is not 
suri^rising when we consider how small is the total number of the mam- 
malia, and even of birds, compared with the countless species of inver- 
tebrates. Out of the vast assemblage of insects, with their varied 
colors and patterns, it would be strange if there were not many cases 
of accidental resemblance. A strict application of Wallace's five laws 
would perhaps, if all the circumstances were known, eliminate many 
accepted instances. 

As to cases of edible insects mimicking inedible-, Mr. Poulton admits 
that even unpalatable animals have tiieir special enemies, and that the 
enemies of palatable animals are not indefinitely numerous. 



FIELD STUDY IN ORNITHOLOGY. 481 

Mr. Beddard gives tables of the results obtained by Weismaim, Poul- 
ton, and others, which show that it is impossible to lay down any defi- 
nite law upon the subject, and that the likes and dislikes of insect- 
eating animals are purely relative. 

One of the most interesting cases of mimicry is that of the Voliicella, 
a genMS of Diptera, whose larvae live ou the larvie of Hymenopter a, and 
of which the perfect insect closely resembles some sj)ecies of humble- 
bee. Though this fact is unquestioned, yet it has recently given rise 
to a controversy, which, so far as one who has no claim to be an ento- 
mologist can judge, proves that while there is much that can be explained 
by mimicry, there is, nevertheless, a danger of its advocates ju'essing it 
too far. Yolucella homhylans occurs in two varieties, which prey uijon 
the humble-bees, Bomhus nniscormn and B. lapidarius, which they 
respectively resemble. Mr. Bateson does not question the behavior of 
the Volucella, but states that neither variety specially represents B. 
muscorum, and yet that they deposit their eggs more frequently in their 
nests than in the nests of other species which they resemble more closely. 
He also states that in a show case in the Royal College of Surgeons, to 
illustrate mining, two specimens of another species, B. si/lvarmn, were 
placed alongside of the Volucella, which they do resemble, but were 
labeled B. muscorum. 

But Mr. Hart explains the parasitism in another way. He states 
that a nest of B. nmscorum is made ou the surface, without much 
attempt at concealment, and that the bee is a peculiarly gentle species, 
Avith a very feeble sting; but that the species which the Volucella most 
resemble are irascible, and therefore more dangerous to intruders. 
If this be so, it is difficult to see why the Yolucella should mimic the 
bee, which it does not affect, more closely than the one which is gener- 
ally its victim. I do not presume to express any opinion further than 
this, that the instances I have cited show that there is much reason 
for further careful observation by the field naturalist, and much yet to 
be discovered by the physiologist and the chemist, as to the composi- 
tion and nature of animal pigments. 

HEREDITARY ACQUISITIONS. 

I had proposed to occupy a considerable portion of my address with 
a statement of the present position of the controversy on heredity, by 
far the most difficult and important of all those subjects which at 
present attract the attention of the biologist; but an attack of ill- 
ness has compelled me to abandon my purpose. Not that I proposed 
to venture to express any opinions of my own, for with such prota- 
gonists in the field as Weisman, Wallace, Romanes, and Poultou on 
the one side, and Herbert Spencer and Hartog on the other, " Non noa 
trum inter vos tantas componere liieHP 

So far as I can understand Weisman's theory, he assumes the separa- 
tion of germ cells and somatic cells, and that each germ cell contains 
SM 93 31 



482 FIELD STUDY IN ORNITHOLOGY. 

in its nucleus a number of '' ids," each "id " representing the personal- 
ity of an ancestral member of the species, or of an antecedent species. 
" The first multicellular organism was probably a cluster of similar 
cells, but these units soon lost their original homogeneity. As the 
result of mere relative position, some of the cells were especially fitted 
to provide for the nutrition of the colony, while others undertook the 
work of reproduction," The latter, or germ-plasm, he assumes to 
possess an unlimited power of continuance, and that life is endowed 
with a fixed duration, not because it is contrary to its nature to be 
unlimited, but because the unlimited existence of individuals would be 
a luxury without any corresponding advantage. 

Herbert Spencer remarks upon this: "The changes of every aggre- 
gate, no matter of what kind, inevitably end in a state of ecpiilibrium. 
Suns and planets die, as well as organisms." But has the theory been 
proved, either by the histologist, the microscopist, or the chemist? 
Spencer presses the i)oint that the immortality of the protozoa has not 
been proved. And, after all, when Weismann makes a continuity of 
the germ plasm the foundation of a theory of heredity, he is building 
vipon a pure hypothesis. 

From the continuity of the germ-plasm, and its relative segregation 
from the body at large, save with respect to nutrition, he deduces, a 
priori, the impossibility of characters acquired by the body being trans- 
mitted through the germ-plasm to the ott'spring. From this he imjilies 
that where we find no intelligible mechanism to convey an imprint from 
the body to the germ, there no imprint can be conveyed. Romanes 
has brought forward many instances which seem to contradict this 
theory, and Herbert Spencer remarks that " a recognized principle of 
reasoning — 'the law of parsimony' — forbids the assumption of more 
causes than are needful for the explanation of phenomena. We have 
evident causes which arrest the cell multii3lication ; therefore it is ille- 
gitimate to ascribe this arrest to some property inherent in the cells." 

With regard to the reduction or disappearance of an organ, he states 
"that when natural selection, either direct or reversed, is set aside, 
why the mere cessation of selection should cause decrease of an organ, 
irrespective of the direct effects of disease, I am unable to see. Beyond 
the production of changes in the size of parts, by the selection of 
fortuitously arising variation, I can see but one other cause for the 
production of them — the competition among the parts for nutri- 
ment. - - - The active parts are well supplied, while the inactive 
parts are ill supplied and dwindle, as does the arm of the Hindu fakir. 
This competition is the cause of economy of growth — this is the cause 
of decrease from disease." 

I may illustrate Mr. Herbei't Spencer's remarks by the familiar 
instance of the pinions of the Ivakapo (Striuf/ops) — still remaining, but 
powerless for flight. 

As for acquired habits, such as the modification of bird architecture 



FIELD STUDY IN ORNITHOLOGY. 483 

by the same species under changed circumstances, liow tliey can be 
better accounted for than by hereditary transmitted instinct, I do not 
see. I mean such cases as the ground-nesting Bidunculus in Samoa 
having saved itself from extinction, since the introduction of cats, by 
roosting and nesting in trees; or the extraordinary acquired habit of 
the bhickeap in the Canaries, observed by Dr. Lowe, of piercing the 
calyx of HihLscus yo.sasineiisis — an introduced plant — to attract insects, 
for which he quietly sits M'aiting. So the lying low of a covey of par- 
tridges under an artificial kite would seem to be a transmitted instinct 
from a far-off ancestry not yet lost ; for many generations of partridges, 
I fear, must have passed since the last kite hovered over the fore- 
fathers of an English partridge, save in very few parts of the island. 

I can not conclude without recalling that the past year has witnessed 
the severance of the last link with the pre-Darwinian naturalists in the 
death of Sir Eichard Owen. Though never himself a field-worker or 
the discoverer of a single animal living or extinct, his career extends 
over the whole history of palteontology. I say palteontology, for he was 
not a geologist in the sense of studying the order, succession, area, 
structure, and disturbance of strata. But he accunuilated facts on the 
fossil remains that came to his hands, till he won the fame of being the 
greatest comparative anatomist of the age. To him we owe the build- 
ing up of the skeletons of the giant IHnornithidw and many other of 
the perished forms of the gigantic sloths, armadillos, and mastodons 
of South America, Australia, and Europe. He was himself a colossal 
worker, and he never worked for popularity. He had lived and worked 
too long before the Victorian age to accept readily the doctrines which 
have revolutionized that science, though none has had a larger share 
in accunndating the fiicts, the combination of which of necessity pro- 
duced that transformation. But, though he clung fon<lly to his old idea 
of the archetype, no man did more than Owen to explode the rival 
theories of both Wernerians and Huttonians, till the controversies of 
Plutoniaiis and Neptunians came to us from the far past with as little 
to move our interest as the blue and green controversies of Constanti- 
nople. 

Xor can we forget that it is to vSir Richard's indomitable perseverance 
that we owe the magnificent palace which contains the national collec- 
tions, in Cromwell Road. For many years he fought the battle almost 
alone. His demand for a building of two stories, covering 5 acres, was 
denounced as audacious. The scheme was pronounced foolish, crazy, 
and extravagant; but, after twenty years' struggle, he was victorious, 
and in 1872 the act was passed which gave not 5, but more than 7 acres 
for the puipose. Owen retired from its direction in 1883, having 
achieved the crowning victory of his life. Looking back in his old age 
on the scientific achievements of the past, he fully recognized the pros- 
pects of still further advances, and observed, " The known is very small 



484 FIELD STUDY IN ORNITHOLOGY. 

compared witli the knowable, and we may trust in tlie ^Vutlior of all 
trntli, wlio, I tliiiik, will not let that truth remain forever hidden.'" 

I have endeavored to show that there is still room for all workers, 
that the naturalist has his i^laee, though the morphologist and the pliy- 
siologist have rightly come into far greater prominence, and we need 
not yet abandon the field glass and the lens for the microscope and the 
scalpel. The studies of the laboratory still leave room for the observa- 
tions of the field. The investigation of muscles, the analysis of brain 
tissue, the research into the chemical properties of pigment, have not 
rendered- worthless the study and observation of life and habits. As 
you can not diagnose the red Indian and the Anglo-Saxon by a com- 
parison of their respective skeletons or researches into their muscular 
structure, but require to know the habits, the language, the modes of 
thought of each; so the mammal, the bird, and even the invertebrate, 
has his character, his voice, his impulses, aye, I will add, his ideas, to 
be taken into account in order to discriminate him. There is something 
beyond matter in life, even in its lowest forms. I may quote on this 
the caution uttered by a predecessor of mine in this chair (Prof. Milues 
Marshall) : " One thing above all is apparent, that embryologists must 
not work single-handed; must not be satisfied with an acquaintance, 
however exact, with animals from the side of development oidy; for 
embryos have this in common with maps, that too close and too exclu- 
sive a study of them is apt to disturb a man's reasoning power." 

The ancient Greek philosopher gives us a threefold division of the 
intellectual faculties — ^^oovry^ic, i-iczy^irfj, (rwzni' — and I think we may 
apply it to the subdivision of labor in natural science: (fpu-^-qat-, -q rd /.a/i^ 
£xa(7Ta ywcof)U()u<7(x, is the power that divides, discerns, distinguishes — i. e., 
the naturalist; ffuvsat-, the operation of the closest zoologist, who in- 
vestigates and experiments; and en-.'^Dj/^Tj, the faculty of the philoso- 
pher, who draws his conclusions from facts and observations. 

The older naturalists lost much from lack of the records of previous 
observations; their difticulties were not ours, but they went to nature 
for their teachings rather than to books. Now we find it hard to avoid 
being smothered with the literature on the subject, and being choked 
with the dust of libraries. The danger against which Prof. Marshall 
warns the embryologist is not confined to him alone; the observer of 
facts is equally exposed to it, and he must beware of the danger, else he 
may become a mere materialist. The poetic, the imaginative, the emo- 
tional, the spiritual, all go to make iip the man; and if one of these 
is missing, he is incomplete. 

I can not but feel that the danger of this concentration upon one side 
only of nature is painfully illustrated in the life of our great master, 
Darwin. In his early days he was a lover of literature, he delighted in 
Shakespeare and other poets; but after years of scientific activity and 
interest, he found on taking them up again that he had not only grown 
indifferent to them, but that they were even distasteful to him. He 



FIELD STUDY IN ORNITHOLOGY. 485 

had suffered a sort of atrophy on that side of his uature, as the <lis 
used pinions of the Kakapo have become powerless, — the spiritual, the 
imaginative, the emotional, we may call it. 

The case of Darwin illustrates a law — a principle we may call it— 
namelj', that the spiritual faculty lives or dies by exercise or the want 
of it even as does the bodily. Yet the atrophy was unconscious. Far 
was it from Darwin to ignore or depreciate studies not his own. He 
has shown us this when he prefixed to the title-page of his great work 
the following extract from Lord Chancellor Bacon: "To conclude, 
therefore, let no man, out of a weak conceit of sobriety, or an ill-applied 
moderation, think or maintain that a man can search too far, or be too 
well studied in the book of God's word, or in the book of God's works, 
divinity or philosophy, but rather let men endeavor an endless progress 
or proficieuce in both.'' In true harmony this with the spirit of the 
father of natural history, concluding with the words, "O Lord, how 
manifold are Thy works, in wisdom hast Thou made them all, the earth 
is full of Thy riches." 



THE SO-CALLED BUGONTA OF THE ANCIENTS, 
AND ITS KELATION TO A 15EE-LIKE FLY,— ERLSTALIS TENAX." 



By C. R. OsTEN Sacken. 



For more than two thousand years a superstition has been prevalent 
in the minds of the masses, as well as in books, to the effect that, 
besides the usual production of honey bees in hives, they originated 
by spontaneous generation from carcasses of dead animals, and i:)rin- 
cipally from those of oxen. Thus arose in Greece the term Bugonid 
(from fiou:; an ox, and yovrj, progeny), as well as the expression bugenes 
melissae, tmirigena' a])es^ that is, oxen-born bees, in the Greek and Latin 
literature. This superstition prevailed also in northern Africa and in 
some parts of Asia; it continued through the Middle Ages, and found 
expression even in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The friend 
of Luther, the learned and pious Melanchthon, considered it as a 
divine provision; an Italian poet of the sixteenth century put it into 
verse ;t the great naturalist Aldrovandi (1602) accepted it without con- 
tradiction; the English naturalist Moufet (Theatren lusectorum, 1634)| 
spoke of it as a common occurrence {experientia rmtica et vulgaris, I. 
c, p. 12); and, hnally, the learned Bochart (1003) § admitted it as an 
undoubted truth.

t Giovanni Rucellai (1475-1525), in Florence and Rome, died as Governer of S. 
Augelo. His poem: Le J^r;, Amsterd. latin edit. 1681, p. 68, contains an account 
of tbe Bugonia. 

t Moufet was a contemporary of Queen Elizabeth, and died without publishing his 
work. "It fell into the hands of Sir Theod. Mayerne, Baron d'Aubone, one of the 
court physicians in the time of Charles I, who at length published it, prefixing a 
dedication to Sir Wm. Paddy, M. D., in 1634." (This passage, as well as the pre- 
vious history of the " Theatrum Insectorum," will be found in Kirby and Spence, 
Introd. IV, p. 429-430.) I spell Movfd (K. and S. have Mouffet) as I find it on the 
title-page of my copy of the "Theatrum," 1634. By a strange and perhaps siguiti' 
cant coincidence, such works as Moufet's, Swammerdam's, and Lyonet's " Recber- 
ches," were neglected by their contemporaries, and published long after the death 
of their authors.

488 THE SO-CALLED BUGONIA OF THE ANCIENTS. 

The original cause of tbis delusion lies in the fact that a very com- 
inoii fly, scientifically called ^ri.s^rf/ys tenn.v (poi)ularly the drone fly), 
lays its eggs iii)ou carcasses of animals, that its larvfe develop within 
the putrescent mass, and finally change into a swarm of flies which, in 
their shape, hairy clothing and color, look exactly like bees, although 
they belong to a totally different order of insects. Bees belong to the 
Order Hymenoptera, and have four wings; the female is provided with 
a sting at the end of the body; the fly Eristalis belongs to the Order 
Diptera, has only tMO wings and no sting. 

The final extinction of this absurd notion among civilized nations 
was due to two causes : 

(1) Among scientific men, to the confutation of the old belief in spon- 
taneous generation, and the general recognition of the principle: onitie 
vivuni ex ovo, proclaimed by William Harvey (1651), and by the great 
Italian naturalist, Eedi (1668).* 

(2) Among the ignorant crowd, to the introduction of a sanitary 
police, which prevents carcasses from lying about and affording the 
spectacle of bee-like flies swarming around them. 

Modern commentators of Greek and Latin authors have treated the 
Bugonia with a contemptuous sneer,t without taking into consideration 
that a superstition so universal and so persistent can not be dismissed 
so easily, and must necessarily have some foundation in fact. The 
refutation of an error is not complete until the source of the error is 
revealed. In a short paper on the geographical distribution of the fly, 
Eristalis tenex (Entoni. M. Mag., xxiii, p. 97-99, London, 1886), I intro- 
duced incidentally the explanation of the Buf/o7iia, founded upon a 
resemblance of this fly to the honey-bee. Already at that time it seemed 
strange to me that such an obvious and simple explanation had never 
been proposed before. Since then I have undertaken a regular search 
in entomological literature in order to ascertain if any approach to such 
a solution could be found in previous writers, and to inquire into the 
causes that had delayed it so long. I shall now attempt to give an 
account of my inquiry and to show that, as soon as certain conditions, 
necessary for the confutation of that error were fulfilled, the error dis- 
appeared of itself. 

The principal factor underlying the whole intellectual j)henomenon 



"Francesco Redi's work, Esperienze intorno alia generazione degVinsetii, appeared iu 
Florence, 1668. F. Redi, born iu Arezzo, 1626; died in Pisa, 1697. He was the phy- 
sician of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, and at the same time a naturalist, a poet and 
a literary personage iu general. His letters are charming. I possess a Neapolitan 
edition of his comjdete works in seven volumes, dated 1778, and shall quote from it.

with these books to Prof. Zangemeister, director of the University Library in Hei- 
delberg. The commentaries of Prof. Martyn on the Georgica (London, 1741),. which 
I find quoted in Smith's Diction. Biogr. and Mythol., etc., I have not been able to

we are iiKiiiiriii;^' into is the well-kuowii intlueiicc which prevails in all 
human matters, aud this factor is routine. 

"Thinking is difficult, and actiug accordiug to reason is irksome,"* 
said Goethe. People see, and believe in what they see, and the belief 
easily becomes a tradition. It may be asked. If those people had 
that belief, why did they not try to verify it by experiment, the moie 
so as an economical interest seemed to be connected witli it. 

The answer is that they probably did try the exi)eriment, and did 
obtain something* that looked like a bee; but that there was a second 
part of tlie experiment, which, if they ever tried it, never succeeded, 
and that was to make the bee-like something produce honey. If they 
did not care much about this failure, and did not prosecute the experi- 
ment any further, it is probably because, in most cases, they found 
that it was mucli easier to procure bees iu the ordinary way. Tliat 
sucb was really the kind of reasoning which prevailed in those times 
clearly results from the collation of the passages of ancient authors 
about the Bugonia. There were different recipes for it; one wanted the 
ox to be buried with projecting horns, through which, after they 
were cutoff, bees would emerge; anothei- (and no less a. personage 
than Pliny), contended that it is sufficient to use the entrails of 
an ox, and to cover them with dung, etc. Florentinus, an obscure 
writer iu the Geoponicat gives an account of the process that was 
used by Juba, King of Mauritania: "Build a house. 10 cubits high, 
with all the sides of equal dimensions, Avith one door, and four 
windows, one on each side; put an ox into it, thirty months old, very 
fat and fleshy; let a number of young men kill him by beating him 
violently with clubs, so as to mangle both flesh and bones, but taking- 
care not to shed any blood; let all the orifices, mouth, eyes, nose, etc., 
be stopped up with clean and fine linen, impregnated with pitch; let a 
quantity ol*'thyme be strewed under the reclining animal, and then let 
windows and doors be closed and covered with a thick coating of clay, 
to prevent the access of air or wind. Three weeks later let the house 
be opened, and let light and fresh air get access to it, except from the 



" "Denken ist schwer, nach dera Gedachten liandelii nnbequem." Goethe. 

tTlie Geoponica, ov Work of Agriculture, was a compilation of old Greek aud 
Eoman authors ou the same subject, ordered by the Emperor Constantiue Porphy- 
rogeneta, aud executed iu all probability by Cassiauus Bassus, a couteniporary writer 
(I quote from W. Smith, Diet, of Gr. aud Kom. Biogr. aud Mythol., sith voce Bassus). 
Florentinus, to all appearances, is one of the authors made use of in the Geoponica, 
but nothing more seems to be known about him (compare 1. c. siih voce Florentinus; 
the statementof this article, by a different author, is not iu entire agreement with 
that on liassus.) — Prof. A. Merx, of Heidelberg, the celebrated Syriac scholar, told 
nic of an old Syriac translation of the Geoponica, Avhich may possibly have been the 
channel through which the nation of the Bugonia spread eastwards. He added that 
the Hayat el-haiwau (the Life of Animals) by Damiri (or Demiri), and other Arabic 
works, may contain allusions to the Bugonia. It is beyond my province to follow up 
these suggestions, but I take advantage of this opportunity to express to Prof. 
Merx my sincere thanks for the interest he took in my research.

side from which the wind l)k>\\ s strongest. After eleven days you 
will lind the house full of bees, hanging together in clusters, and 
nothing left of the ox but horus, bones, and hair." (Aldrovaudi, 
/. c. p. 58; also a mention in Eedi, I.e. i, p. 53.) Some authors, like 
Celus, and afterwards Columella, show their common sense in declar- 
ing tliat is useless to take all this trouble, when liive-born bees can be 
so easily obtained. I shall return to this subject in treating of the 
literature of the Bmjonia. 

All these errors would have been avoided if the people from the very 
beginning, had known how to distinguish a honey-bee from a bee-like 
tly. Until this knowledge was forthcoming there was no reason for not 
believing in the Bngonia. 

Aristotle* knew that four-winged insects liave the sting in the tail 
and the two-winged ones in the front of the head; and for this reason, 
if he ever came in contact with EristaUs tenax, he would have recog- 
nized a fly, and not a bee, in it. At any rate, although he was a 
believer in spontaneous generation, he never mentioned the Bngonia 
in his paragrai)hs about bees. 

But after Aristotle, for a period of about twenty centuries, the ques- 
tion of Bugonia remained in abeyance, and the belief was accepted 
even by men of learning. I will show in the sectuel that, as late as 
1(»()2, there was a Dutch savant, in whose presence an B. tenax was pro- 
duced from putrescent matter, and who actually took it for a honey- 
bee, and the case before him as an instaiu-e of Bugonia! 

The thesis which 1 maintain is, that it is to E. tenax alone, and no 
other bee-like or wasp-like flies {(Estrida\ Helophilus, etc.) that the 
origin of the belief in the Bngonia is due; in other words, that if this 
particular fly had not existed the belief would never have arisen. 
E. tenax has several attributes which make it jire-emiueutly fitted for 
assuming the role of an oxen-born bee: 

(1) It is more like a hohey-bee than any other fly; the other flies, 
which have been named in connection with the Bugonia, have a differ- 
ent aspect; the (Estridw are more Ukehnmhle-hees; Helophilus is more 
like a wasp. 

(2) It oviposits on carcasses in a state of far advanced decomposition 
in which its larvic thrive, and these habits correspond to the tradition 
of the oxen-born bee. The larvjie of (Estrus (genus Hijpoderma) live 
in the skin of /('r/»/; animals; the wasp-like i7<'/o^>/<ii».s', although a close 
relative of EristaUs in the zoological system, and developing, like that 



" Aristoteles, Hist. Anim. iv, 7, 4 : " The winged ouesamoug insects, are either two- 
winged, like flies, or four-winged, like bees; but none of those which have a sting 
in the tail are two-winged." And 7. c. iv, 7, ,3: "Also the myops (probably Ho'ma- 
topuia ca'cuiiens) and the ccsfrus (Tabanus) have a hard tongue - - - because 
all that have no tail sting use the tongue as a weapon." Also in the. I)c partihus 
anim. iv, 6, 3-4, where Aristoteles says that Uiptera have but two wings, because 
they are lighter than Hymenoptera. I. B. Meyer, Aristoteles Thiirkiindc, Berlin, 1855, 
p. 209, has some critical remarks about these passages. 



THE SO-CALLED BUGONIA OP THE ANCIENTS. 491 

fly, from a rat-tailed larva, is, in comparison to E. tenax, of rather rare 
occurrence, and would not have been noticed so easily and so generally. 

(3) The very common occurrence of Uristalis tenax, and (as I will 
show in the paragraph about its geographical distribution) the truly 
fabulous rapidity of its j)ropagation under favorable circumstances, 
must have struck, from the earliest times, the eyes and the imagina- 
tion of the ignorant crowd, and this obtrusiveness, combined with the 
swarming of the fly round carcasses, and its bee-like aspect led quite 
naturally towards the belief in the Bugonki. 

This thesis, that EristuUs tenax alone is the cause of the Bngonia 
craze, being given, what remains for me to do is to show how, at the 
end of those twenty centuries of inertia, the question about the Bugonia 
came up again, and after some uncertainty and groping, found its solu- 
tion in the recognition of that truth. 

A group of men, almost contemporaries, brought about that solution 
in the seventeenth century, by dint of observing insects in life, and not 
by merely comi)iling' authorities. These men were: Goedart (1620- 
1668), Blankaart (his work appeared in 1688), Swammerdam (1637-1680), 
all three in Holland; Eedi (1626-1(>97) and Vallisnieri (1661-1730) in 
Italy, and Anally Reaumur (1683-1757) in France. 

Goedart {MetaDiorphosis imectoriini, etc., 1662; edition in Dutch 1669) 
gives rough but distinct figures of the larva, pupa, and imago of E. 
tenax [l. c, Tab. ii, p. 25). He calls the larva vermiculus porcinus. The 
imago is distinctly figured as a two-winged fly, and the letterpress also 
speaks of two wings; nevertheless, for some unknown reason, Goedart 
calls it apis (bee). 

That so careful and conscientious an observer should have taken a 
fly for a bee is out of the question. Swammerdam, who reproached him 
with this mistake {Bibl. Nat. Germ., ed. 1758, p. 212), changed his mind 
in another part of his work {I. c, p. 257), and took to task Dr. de Mey, 
Goedart's commentator, as the guilty party. Goedart was not a class- 
ical scholar; Eeaumur (vol. i, p. 29) notices it in a passage, which is a 
choice specimen of French finesse and urbanity: " Ceux meme (les 
naturalistes) qui, par une ignorance peut-etre lieureuse, n'etaient pas 
en etat de lire les anciens, comme Goedart et Mile. Merian, ont travaille 
utilement." It was the classically learned de Mey who saw in Goedart's 
observation an actual case of Bngonia. He took the Eristalis for a 
honey-bee, and composed a preposterous Annotation about it. Swam- 
merdam, the representative of the new science, was seized with an 
almost ludicrous fit of wrath about this piece of presunq)tion. " The 
fuss, says he (/. e.) de Mey makes about this story is truly astonishing, 
and plainly shows that he is equally ignorant of the nature of the bee, as 
of the nature of the fly. This is one of the bad habits of our day that 
statements are made on matters about which one knows nothing, for the 
mere purpose of getting a reputation of Avisdom and knowledge.'' An 
amusing instance of the collision between che old and the new learning. 



492 THE SO-CALLEt) BUGOKIA OF THE ANCIENT8. 

Blankaait {Scliaii2>Iatz dcr R<mj>en, WurtHcry etc.; JJutcb edit., 1088; 
Geinian edit., 1(590) describes and tigurcs the larva, i)upa, and imago 
of j&. tenax. Tlie larva lie calls (after Goedart) Schtvein-Made. Of tlie 
imago, lie says, "eiue Art vou zalimen Bienen {Musca (qnform is) mit 
z\Yci Fliigelii," etc. ("A kiud of tame bees witli wings".) He adds: 
" Quite different from wbat Goedart tauglit us," a reproach wbicb, I 
have shown, is undeserved. 

Swammerdaurs (1(;37-1680) principal work, the " Biblia natune " 
(Leyden, 1737-38; in German, Leipzig, 1858), was published more than 
half a century after his death. 

Swammerdam, in two i)assages of his " Biblia," comes very near con- 
necting J'Jristalis tenax with the Bugonia, and it is only his bias for a 
literary interpretation of a scriptural text which prevents him from 
taking the last step that was needed. In his chapter on bees (pp. 
210-212) he says that because bees are cleanly animals, and never alight 
on carcasses, the story of Samson has appeared to many strange and 
incredible. He offers an explanation very similar to that of Bochart* 
(whom he does not quote and does not seem to know), that the lion was 
not a corpse, but a skeleton. It was in the height of summer; the 
larvae of certain tlies always occurring in carcasses have, in a very short 
time, devoured all the tlesh; the remaining skeleton was soon freed 
from all bad smells by the combined action of sun, rain, and dew; 
under such circumstances it is possible ("es lUsst sich ohuschwer 
begreifen ") that the skeleton may have become the, habitation of bees 
during the swarming season (/. c, p. 211, right column). On page 212, 
Swammerdam continues: "This story of Samson and his bees, mis- 
understood as it was, has undoubtedly given rise to the common ignor- 
ant craze that bees originate from lions, oxen, and horses. The craze 
was probably confirmed by the sight of the great mass of worms which 
occur in such carcasses in summer, the more so as these worms are 
somewhat ("einigermassen") like the larv;e of bees. This apparent 
resemblance has undoubtedly fortified this error, which, ridiculous and 
groundless as it is, has found advocates even among the most learned 
men. The laborious Goedart has not hesitated to make bees breed 
from dung-worms, and the learned De Mey has shared his opinion, 
although what he took for a bee was nothing but a fly, which looked 
somewhat bee-like," etc. 

In a later part of this work (/. c, pp. 25G-257) Swammerdam gives a 
detailed description (Avith figures) of the three stages of UH, stalls tenax. 
He notices (/. c, p. 257 at the bottom) that the fly has been frequently 
taken for a bee, and that Augerius Clutius,t in his little work on bees, 

* Bochart's explanation -will bo given fiirtlier on. 

tTheodor Angur Clutins, also called Dirck Cluyt, apothecary and botanist in 
Leyden, at the end of the sixteenth and the beginning of the next centurJ^ His 
book: On Bees (Yande Bieu, etc.), appeared in Leyden in 1597 and had seven edi- 
tions, the last in 1705. I borrow these statements from H. A. Hagen's Bibliotheca 



THE SO-CALLED BUGONIA OP THE ANCIENTS. 493 

has deuouuced this error. He exonerates Goedart of his supposed 
mistake and charges Be Mey with it (as I have already explained 
above). 

It follows from these statements that Swaramerdam was fully aware 
of the absurdity of the Bugonia craze, but that he did not quite grasp 
the part played by E. tenax in it, and would not, even in the presence 
of sufficient evidence, give up his basis for a literal interpretation of 
the Holy Scriptures. In fact he connects the belief in the Bugonia 
with the story of the bees of Samson, as if the ancients (Greeks and 
Romans) knew anything about Samson ! 

Redi, a contemporary of Swammerdam, stood on the same level with 
him on the question of the Bugonia. Both were adversaries of sponta- 
neous generation, and nevertheless both misunderstood the story of 
Samson. Redi {Esperienze^ etc., p. 58) accepts the interpretation of Boc- 
hart. And with regard to the relation of bee-like flies, and especially 
oi E. tenax to the Bugonia, both seem to have been in the dark. My 
Neapolitan edition of Redi (1778) contains a supplement by Girolamo 
Gaspari* from Verona (?. c, j>. 149), who states quite distinctly that Redi 
only deuouuced the error, and that it was ValUsnieri who explained its 
origin by discovering certain bee-like flies which insert their eggs into 
the skins of animals. But this discovery of Vallisnieri was not quite 
up to the markf what he discovered were Oestridw of the genus Hypo- 
derma, and not E. tenax. Hypodermse are bot flies, some of which look 
more like bumblebees than honeybees; their larvte occur in the skin 
of oxen and of difterent kinds of deer, including reindeer. Vallisnieri 
was also mistaken when he took the bot of the horse ( Gastrus equi), whose 
larva lives in the stomach of this animal, for the representative of the 
wasp, which the ancient wiiters thought was generated from carcasses 
of horses. It is a fly of the genus HelophiJus, which passed for a wasp 
among the ancients; i7eZo2)/<?7?t.s is a close relative of jE/ris'/a7i,s; it has, 
like EristaUs, a rat-tailed larva, which live in putrescent matter. But 
in its coloring Eelophilus resembles a wasp (black, with yellow stripes 
and spots), while EristaUs resembles a bee. And yet that Vallisnieri 
knew E. tenax maybe inferred from his words: ''That stout and stupid 
fly, which is bred from certain worms, provided with a tail, and some- 
times called aquatic intestines {intestini aquaticiy^ (Vallisnieri Esperi- 
enze, etc., p., 149). On the same page Vallisnieri gives instances of the 
confusion between the terms of bees and Jfies in ancient authors, and 
quotes, among others, Lampridius Life of Heliogabalus, chap. 26. I 

entomologica, i, p. 133. I have consulted the fifth edition (1648 -which was kindly 
lent to me by the Grand Ducal Library in Carlsruhe. Clutius also speaks of the 
Ocsirida; (p. 10). The "Augerius" (misprinted Augenius) TeferTeA to by Vallisnieri, 
Esperienze, etc., p. 14 (1726), is evidently the same Clutius. 

' Dr. G. Gaspari {I. c.) quotes from Vallisnieri'a Dialogo fra 'I Malpighi, e Flinio, 
Venezia, 1700. I have not seen this work, but I possess his, Esperienze ed Osserva- 
zioni, etc., second edition, 1726. Antonio Vallisnieri (1661-1730) was professor in 
Padua.

translate this passage of Lami)ri(lius: "As a gift to liis parasites, 
Heliogabalus ofteiitinies sent them vessels filled with frogs, scorpions, 
snakes, and other disgusting- animals. Such were sometimes filled with 
numerous flies, which he called tame heenP Tliese tame bees were 
undoubtedly Eristalis tcnax, and the practical joke of the Roman 
Emperor consisted in frightening his friends with them, 

Eeaumur {Mem., vol. iv, 439, quarto edit, 1738) came a little later 
than the above-quoted authors and made use of their works. (Compare 
vol I, p. 29, and vol. iv, p. 519, about Vallisnieri.) It is Reaumur who, 
for the first time, brought the i>w/7o«i^/ and U. /rMfw distinctly together. 
At the very beginning of the chapter, "Of two-winged flies whicli 
look like bees," in which he gives the life history of this fly, the fidlow- 
ing i^assage occurs : " Such resemblances (between certain hymenoptera 
and diptera) have deceived people at a time when observations were 
not very accurate 5 such resemblances have made people believe that 
honey-bees, humble-bees, hornets, and wasi)s originate in putrescent 
matter upon which those other flies occur."' ("Ce sont ces memes 
ressemblances qui en ont impose dans des temps ou Fon n'y regardait 
pas d'assez pres; ce sont ces ressemblances qui ont fait croire que les 
abeilles, que les bourdons, que les frelons et les guepes venaient de cer- 
taines matieres pourries sur lesquelles on trouvait les autres mouches.") 
This is the explanation of the Bugonia in a nutshell. 

But Reaumur was working at a time when a systematic nomencla- 
ture of entomology was not yet introduced, and that prevented him 
from expressing his meaning with more precision; in other words, from 
naming the species whicli he meant. Thus it happened that the very 
important, but perhaps too concise passage which I quote has ever 
since been entirely overlooked, as if it had never existed. I have 
searched in vain in Kirby and Spence, in Westwood's Introduction,* 
and in other entomological works for any other passage, either allud- 
ing to Beaumur or offering an independent explanation of the origin 
of the Bugonia. 

This apparent missing link in entomological literature encourages me 
to put the whole case before the public, although I feel very unequal 
to the task, especially in its philological and literary aspect. I consider 
the story of the Bugonia principally as an interesting episode in the 
history of science; a remarkable instance of the tenicity of ignorance 
and of the insufficiency of the testimony of the senses alone, without 
the control of previously acquired knowledge. 

The origin of the belief in the Bugonia must be sought in prehistoric 
times, when country people, keeping cattle and bees, observed bee-like 
flies swarming about dead animals. The earliest appearance of the 



"The passage iu Westwood, Intiotl., 11, p. 557: "Many species so much resemble 
humble-bees, wasps, and otlier diptera tliat they are (umstautly mistaken for them 
by the inexperienced," contains no reference -whatever to tlie Bugonia. 



THE SO-CALLED BUGONIA OF THE ANCIENTS. 495 

belief in literature is tbiiiul in the story of Samson [Judges, xiv, <S), of 
wbicli I have already spoken in the j)aragraph about Swammerdam. 
In the vineyards of Tininah Samson had killed a lion, and, ''after 
awhile," on his way to fetch his bride, "he turned aside to see the car- 
cass of the lion: and behold, there was a swarm of l)ees in the body 
of the lion, andlioney; and he took it into his hands, and went on, 
eating as he went,'' etc. As soon as a myth is started it begins to 
grow. The seeing of a swarm of bee-like flies was a fact; the finding 
and eating the honey was the myth grown out of the misconceived 
fact. The riddle, which Samson proposes afterwards, affords the 
proof of another fact: that the belief in the Buf/oni<( was current 
among the people at that time; because, without that substratum, the 
riddle would not have had any meaning: 

Out of the eater camo forth meat 

Aud oat of the strong came forth sweetness. 

The narrator of the tale arranges it so as to make it a preamble to 
the riddle : When Samson gave the honey to his parents he did not 
tell them that he had taken it from the body of the lion; because if he 
told them, they (as believers in the Bugonia) would have solved the 
riddle immediately, without the necessity of guessing. The story, 
therefore, represents a real occurrence, based upon a well-observed but 
wrongly interpreted natural phenomenon. 

It is curious to notice how Samuel Boshart (vol. ii, p. 502) comments 
on this passage of the Book of Judges in order to meet possible objec- 
tions. He admits that bees, besides their natural origin in hives, are 
produced from dead oxen, in conformity to the opinion of numerous 
ancient authors; but he scoffs at the ignorance of those who, relying 
on the scriptural text, admit two kinds of animal-bred bees, and attacks 
especially Moufet on that matter: " ISTec audiendus Mufetus Anglus qui 
in Insectorum Theatro, alias apes scribit esse lepntogenes, alias tauro- 
genes.'''' In order to explain the appearance of bees in Samson's lion, 
Bochait establishes three propositions: 

( 1) Although it is stated in the text that the bees were in the carcass, 
it is not stated that they were horn there (" apes in leonis corpore fuisse 
rei^ertas, non tamen ibi natas''). 

(2) That between the killing of the lion and the finding of his 
remains a whole year had elapsed, because the expression " after a 
while" {post diem) in Hebrew must be understood to mean a whole 
year. A host of authorities are adduced by Bochart to sustain this 
strange proposition. 

(3) That at the end of a year the corpse was reduced to the state of 
a clean skeleton, in which the bees could take shelter without repug- 
nance, the bees being clean animals. 

But Bochart does not explain how those cleanly bees which could 
not stand a rotten lion, could be born from rotten oxen. 



496 THE SO-CALLED BUGONIA OF THE ANCIENTS. 

All this display <>f learning and acute reasoning would have been 
unnecessary if Bocliart Lad known that his pretended honey-bees were 
not bees at all, but two- winged flies. And it is interesting to notice 
how both Swanimerdam and ]>ochart were led astray by their intense 
desire to give a literal interpretation to the scriptural text, and to save 
Samson's bees at any price, although their starting point was quite 
ditl'erent, because Bochart believed in the Bngonia and Swamnierdam 
did not. The former was hampered by the authority of the ancient 
writers, as well as by that of the Holy Scriptures; Swanimerdam by 
the Scriptures alone. 

About the time when I published my above quoted article in the 
Entomological Monthly Mmjazine I communicated my solution of the 
question of the Bngonia, and its possible application to the story of 
Samson, to the eminent i^rofessor of scriptural exegesis in Heidelberg, 
Dr. Adalbert Merx. At the same time I handed to him a box, con- 
taining about half a dozen of pinned specimens o{ BristaUs tenax. He 
received this communication with evident delight, and recognized that 
it offered a sim})le solution of a text which had been discussed for cen- 
turies. Soon afterwards, he published in the German ProtestantLsche 
Kirchenzeitung No. 17, 1887, pp. 389-392, a learned article entitled: 
" Der Honig im Cadaver des Lowen" (The honey in the carcass of the 
lion). It contains a summary of the discussions provoked by Sam- 
son's bees, and thecoutroversies of Alphons Tostatus, Bishop of Avila 
(+ 1454), of Lorinus of Avignon (15.59-1G34), and the Jesuit Bonfrere 
(1573-1643). Professor Merx concludes by accepting the resemblance 
of jE', te7iax to a bee as a natural solution of the question "All the per- 
sons, says he, to whom I showed the specimens of Eristalis at once 
recognized bees in them, except a medical man who had some knowl- 
edge of Entomology."* 

It is now time for me to say something about Bristalis tenax Linne, 
that bee-like fly, the resemblance of which to a honey-bee, has confused 
the brains of the scientific and unscientific world for so many centuries. 
I shall give a short account of its outward appearance, its metamor- 
phosis from the larva, and of some remarkable circumstances con- 
nected with its geographical distribution. It belongs to the large 
family Syrphida; which contains a considerable number of handsomely 
colored flies, very fond of flowers; "they fly with amazing rapidity, 
and many delight to hover immovably over certain spots, to which 
they will return if disturbed for a considerable number of times." 
(Westw. Introd., ii, p. 557.) Their coloring consists in many cases of 
yellow crossbands and sjjots on the abdomen, and also of similar 

* John Curtis, Brit. Ent. Dipiera, N. 432. Eristalis nubilipennis, says: "I have had 
some ditliculty to convince persons totally ignorant of entomology, that the Eris- 
taJes were not hees, and it is worthy of observation that, when resting, the Eristalis 
tenax, and jirobably the whole genus, heave their bodies up and down as bees do, aa 
if they were panting. "

marks ou the thorax; or else they are clothed with a liairy covering 
of different colors. 

E. tenax is of a duller coloring than most of the sj^ecies of the family 
and, in that respect, it has remarkable resemblance to a honeybee. 
"This resemblance is so great (says Eeaumar, iv, p. 440)* that, accns- 
tomed as I am to see bees, I hardly ever dared to take one of those 
flies in my hand without hesitation. - - - The colors, the size, 
the conformation, and the proportions of the different parts of the 
body of these two insects, belonging to two different orders, are very 
much alike. The bees have a slightly more elongated body, and their 
head is proportionally smaller. The fly keeps the wings more or less 
divaricated ; on the contrary bees at rest keep them above the abdo- 
men, the one covering them over; but in sucking flowers, or collecting- 
wax, they often have them divaricated. Both insects frequent flowers, 
and behave upon them in more or less the same manner," etc. 

The coloring of the abdomen of the honeybees is variable; some 
varieties have very distinct brownish-yellow crossbands at its base. 
Just the same varieties occur in the coloring of the fly E. tenax. 

The fly appears in great abundance principally in autumn and, when 
the days become chilly, in a semitori)id state, either sucking flowers or 
crawling slowly upon walls and fences. 

The larva of E. tenax is the well-known rat-tailed larva {ver a qnenede 
rat, so called for the first time by Reaumur, I. e. iv, p. 443); it is figured 
in the same volume, plate xxx. A long tail, with a telescopic arrange- 
ment tor prolonging or shortening it, enables the larvte to live several 
inches deep in the water and to pump air from the surface. They 
freipient putrid waters, sewers, etc., and crawl out of them to change 
into pup;ii in the vicinity. The vitality of these larvje is said to be 
extraordinary, and for this reason Linne gave it the name tenax " Hab- 
itat in fimetis, cloacis, aquis putrescentibus vix prelot destruenda 
larva" (Linne, Syst. Nat., 12th edit., p. 984, 1766). Kirby and Spence 
(vol. IV, p. 189) say: " An inhabitant of muddy pools, it has occasion- 
ally been taken up with the water used in paper-making, and, strange 
to say, according to Linne {Fauna Sueeica) resisted without injury to 
immense pressure given to the surrounding jjulp; like leather-coat Jack, 
mentioned by Mr. Bell {Anatomy of Exprefision in Painting, 170), who, 
from a similar force of muscle, could suffer carriages to drive over him 
without receiving any injury." Geoflfroy (vol. ii, p. 521, 1762) repeats 
the same story : " This larva also occurs in the pulp of rags from which

or some allied species.

paper is made; when this pulp is beaten for the manufacture of paper 
the larva although badly struck by the hammers, is not crushed, but 
survives and i^roduces a Hy. This fact would seem incredible, if it was 
not afiBrmed by the great naturalist." 

This tenacity may have been the cause of the success of this fly in 
the so-called struggle for existence. It has attained an almost univer- 
sal distribution, and the progress of civilization has only increased its 
opportunities. In ancient times it had to look out for stray carcasses; 
civilization offers it its drains, canalizations, cesspools, and dung-heaps, 
in which it can wallow in abundance, and perhaps better i)rotected 
against possible enemies. Different in this from other kinds of insects, 
which disappear with the culture of tlie land, E. tenax thus gained a 
new impulse, and spread in new countries with an astounding rapidity. 
It entered into a kindof commensalism with man, like the.!/ ?/-s'(Y/^/o»/es- 
tica, Teichomyza fusca, and some other dipterous insects, Avliich are at 
present hardly found anywhere except among human habitations. It 
is very rare now to come across a carcass, and to see U. tenax hovering 
about it. The only instance I have found in the literature consulted 
by me concerns another species of Eristalis, E. anthophorinus Zett., 
and that case occurred in a distant and primitive country. Zetter- 
stedt {Dipt. Scand. ii, 666), being in Lapland, observed a small swarm 
of flies of this species round the carcass of a sheep: " Ad cadaver ovis 
putridissium, aquai stagnanti maximam partem immersum, odore fceti- 
dissimum, individua 7 vel 8 souopipiente celerrime circumvolandocon- 
gregautia, et in cadaveris parte supra aquam elevata interdum seden- 
tia, die 16 Junii in Lapponia observavi, ova in cadavere sine dubio 
depositura."* 

The occurrence of this fly is reported from all parts of the Old World 
with the exception of South Africa and the East Indies, about which 
1 have no certain data. It occurs in the whole of Europe, as far north 
as Lapland, the northern and central Asia, beginning with Syria and 
Persia, through China to Japan ; in northern Africa (Algiers) and on 
the islands surrounding Africa (Madeira, the Canary Islands, and, on 
the eastern side, Madagascar and Bourbon). During my twenty years 
of residence in North America, spent in collecting diptera and receiv- 
ing collections from many other entomologists, I never met with a spec- 
imen of E. tenax until I^Tovember 5, 1875, when, to my great astonish 
ment, I found one on a window in Dr. Hagen's house in Cambridge, 
Mass. A year later (October-November, 1876) I observed several 
specimens on the fences of Newport, R. 1. In June, 1877, I sailed for 
Europe, but I heard afterwards that during the same year the fly had 



* (Translation). In LapLand, on the 16tli of June, near a very putrid carcass of a 
sheep, the gi'eater part of which was immersed in stagnant, most offensively smell- 
ing water, I perceived seven or eight specimens flying about rajiidly and emitting a 
piping sound, and sometimes alighting on the portion of the carcass above the water, 
evidently for the purpose of depositing their eggs.

become so common tliat " hiindieds were caught." A few years later 
the specifes was reported trom nearly all the States of the Union, includ- 
ing- California and Washington Territory; also from Canada (Montreal, 
common, as stat(Hl by Mr. Caultield in Cariad. Entom., 1884, p. 138). 

A communication made by the American dipterologist. Dr. Williston, 
proves that the invasion has gone, not from the Atlantic border to the 
West, as one might have expected, but, on the contrary, from West to 
East. Dr. Williston had seen a specimen of E. lenax hidden among a 
lot of duplicates in Prof. Riley's collection, bearing a label St. Louis, 
Angust, 1870. Upon drawing Prof. Riley's attention to the Hy (which 
the latter did not previously know by name) he was assured that the 
species had long been familiar to Mr. Riley in outhouses about St. Louis. 
The surprising rapidity however with which the species spread along 
the Atlantic coast soon after its first appearance renders it probable 
that it can not have existed in St. Louis very long before 1870, other- 
wise it would have reached the Atlantic sooner. We are thus driven 
to accept the following outline of its history. We know that it exists 
in Japan and eastern Siberia; from there it must have migrated to the 
North American Pacific coast perhaps long ago. It did not spread 
eastward at once, because the necessary conditions for its existence 
were wanting on the immense plains it had to cross, just as the Colo- 
rado beetle lived in the Rocky Mountains on ISolanum rostratum, and did 
not spread eastwards until civilization brought the potato plant {Sola- 
nnm tuberosum) with it, and thus bridged over for that beetle the dis- 
tance between its native mountains and the Atlantic coast. The con 
dition which civilization brought, and which favored the rapid east- 
ward progress of U. tenax, consisted in the drains, sewers, and cess- 
pools, those necessary concomitants of crowded centers and the usual 
abodes of the larva of Eristalis.* 

The immigration of E. tenax into New Zealand is of a still more 
recent date than that in North America. The Catalogues of the New 
Zealand Diptera, by Nowicky (1875) and Prof J. W. Button (1881) do 
not mention it. It was first noticed in Wellington (North Island) in 
October and November, 1888. In June, 1890, Mr. W. W. Smith (Ash- 
burton, South Island) writes: "It is now widely dispersed and very 
])lentiful in thp South Island." (Notes on Uristalis tenax in New Zea- 
laud, by W. W. Smith, in the Entom. M. Mag., London, 1890, pp, 240- 
242.) 

About Australia, with regard to E. tenax, I am sorry to say, I have 
no information whatever. 

'' All the details aud references about the jjeographical diatribntiou of Eristalis 
tenax will be found in my two articles: 

1. Facts concerning the importation or non-importation of diptera into distant 
countries (Trans. Ent. Soc, London, 18^4, pp. 489-496). 

2. Some new facts concerning Eristales tenax {Entom, Monthly May., London, 1886, 
jtxiii, pp. 97-99), 



500 THE SO-CALLED BUGONIA OF THE ANCIENTS. 

Except the silk-worm and the honey-bee, I hardly know of any insect 
that can show an historical record equal to that of Eristalis tenax. The 
record begins in the dusk of the xjre-hit»toric times, and continues uj) to 
the present date. In its earliest days 1^. tenax appears like a myth, a 
misunderstood and unnamed being, praised for qualities which it never 
possessed, a theme for mythology in ])rose and poetry; later on, the bub- 
ble of its glory having burst, it gradually settles into a kind of com- 
mensalism with man, it obtains from him " a local habitation and a 
name," it Joins the Anglo-Saxon race in its immense colonial develop- 
ment, it vies with it in prodigies of fecundity, and at present renders 
hitherto unrecognized services in converting " atrocious stuff" into 
pure and clean living matter. 

I close this chapter on the Bugonia-cvAZii with the moral of it, con- 
tained in another sentence from Goethe :

COMPARATIVE LOCOMOTION OF DIFFERENT ANIMALS.* 



By E. J. Marey, 

Memhir of Instiinte of France. 



In the study of organized beings, it is a matter of special interest to 
seek for tbe tie which exists between the special structure of each spe- 
cies and its characteristic functions. Tiie more and more intimate 
union of anatomy and comparative physiology will, without doubt, lead 
to the discovery of the fundamental laws of morphogeny, laws which 
will permit us from the form of an organ, to foresee its peculiar uses. 
These relations are already partially within our grasp, so far as the 
locomotor apparatus of vertebrates is concerned. The volume and length 
of muscles, the relative dimensions of the bony rays of the limbs, the 
form and extent of the articular surfaces, permit us to predict the gait 
of a mammal. And, on the other hand, the correctness of these predic- 
tions may be tested by means of chrono-photography, which fixes the 
character of these movements in a series of instantaneous images. 

The readers of this journal already know how the gait of man, of 
the horse, and of the principal mammals may be represented by true 
geometrical diagrams on which one can readily trace the angular 
motions of the different segments of the limbs, and the speed of each 
part of the body, at every instant and for each gait. 

The different types of flight among birds and insects have also been 
studied by means of chrono-photography. This method can be extended 
to the analysis of the locomotion of all living beings, even to those mov- 
ing in the field of the microscope. This done, it will then be possible 
to unite and classify in a inctorial atlas a series of types of animal loco- 
motion. These types, compared with the anatomical descriptions of 
the various species will furnish the necessary elements for the compar- 
ison which we wish to make. 

It will be a work of time to gather and compare all these anatomical 
and j)hysiological data. The principal difficulty in the way of studying

502 COMPARATIVE LOCOMOTION OF DIFFERENT ANIMALS. 

different types of locomotion is enconntered not so raucli in obtaining 
great numbers of species of animals alive, but in finding snitable 
methods for pbotograpliing each of tbem in its normal gait. 

The greater part of domestic animals lend tbemselves very well to 
these studies; they are readily led to a track i)repared and will travel 
over it regularly. With wild birds the difficulty is greater; we have 
however succeeded in obtaining a number of types. 

Fishes, reptiles, mollusks, and insects are more difficult to manage; 
it is necessary to devise for each species some method which will com- 
pel it to travel regularly before the camera. IMoreover, we must, accord- 
ing to circumstances, so vary the conditions of illumination that the 
animal will sometimes show dark on a light ground, and sometimes 
appear light upon a dark background. I have succeeded, nevertheless, 
in obtaining good pictures of a considerable number of different species, 
as may be judged from the illustrations (PI. xxiii-xxv). This series 
of figures shows certain analogies in the mode of progress of species 
which approach each other in their anatomical characters. Thus 
the adder and the eel both progress by means of horizontal undulations 
which move over the entire length of the body from the head to the 
tail (PI. xxiii). The analogy would be still greater if the eel and 
the serpent both swam in the water, or crawled upon the earth, for 
it is the resistance of the medium, or in other words the nature of 
the point of support, which governs the motions of crawling. In water 
the unduhitions of the body are more regular and more efficacious than 
on the ground, while at the same time they are less extended, and the 
retrograde speed of what we may call the wave of motion is but little 
less than the animal's rate of progress. That is, by the time an undu- 
lation has run from head to tail the animal has advanced by nearly the 
length of its body. On level ground, and still more on a slippery sur- 
face, the undulations of the serj)ent and eel are very much extended 
and progress is slow. 

Among coleopterous and orthopterous insects progress is much as it 
has been described by naturalists. Carlet and M. de Moore have shown 
that insects rest on three legs while the other three move. The sup- 
porting legs constitute a triangular base, formed by the first and third 
leg of one side, and the middle leg of the opposite side. (PI. xxiii, 
xxiv.) 

Among arachnids there are on either side two supporting legs, and 
two legs raised at the same time. But in the spider and scorpion which 
we have taken as types, the walk is so rapid that it is not easy to follow 
the successive motions in their jiroper order although they were photo- 
graphed at the rate of 60 a second. In such cases it is necessary to 
increase the number of figures, and above all, to resort to such methods 
of illumination as we have adopted in studying the spider. This con- 
sists in so illuminating the animal above and below, that while it is 
clearly shown in outline, its shadow is proiected upon the track over

which it runs. Tliis shadow gives much iufoi-matioii in regard to the 
position of the legs for when the feet are resting on the ground the leg 
and its shadow touch at their extremities. (PI. xxiv.) 

One of the most interesting points in these physiological comparisons 
is to see how the anatomical resemblances of different animals corre- 
spond with their functional resemblances. 

Among fishes, for example, we meet in varying degree, with the reptil- 
ian undulation which forms the eel's sole mode of progress, but find 
that it has lost much of its importance. Still very apparent in tlie dog- 
fish (PL XXV) it is found only in the caudal region of those fishes whose 
thick set bodies have lost the greater part of their flexibility, but in 
these cases the widened tail acts more efficiently for it meets with 
great resistance in the water. 

Batrachians in different ijhases of their development have modes of 
locomotion corresponding to the state of their organs. The tadpole of 
a to;\d, in which the feet are still imperfectly developed (Pl.xxv, fig. 2, 
ui>]' " line) swims with its tail after the fashion of a fish. Later on 
(low or Une) the legs begin to be used for locomotion, but the tail still 
ireeps no its energetic action and vibrates continually, while the legs 
move in alternate jerks. Still later (middle line) the tail has disappeared 
and the hind legs are alone nsed in progression. This role of the hind 
limbs which presents so striking an analogy to the swimming of man 
is effected in the following" manner.* 

The animal flexes its legs, bringing them well under the body, then 
spreads them wide apart in such manner that the two legs, directed 
laterally, form a right angle with the axis of the body. Propulsion is 
effected by bringing the outstretched feet quickly together, after which 
they are gradually flexed and brought towards the body, and the series 
"<" movements recommences. 

The lizards, which anatomically approach the serpents, also pre- 
serve in their j)rogressiou something of the undulatory movement 
wiiich we have represented above, but this undulation is complicated 
by the action of the limbs, which play the leading part in the crawling 
of these reptiles (PI. xxv). In the gecko (PI. xxv) the undulation of the 
body is plainly to l)e seen; it is scarcely apparent in the gray lizard. 
In both species it is impossible for the eye to follow the iiicessive move- 
ments of the feet, and to compare them with those of other quadru- 
peds, but from their chrono-photographic images it is easy to see that, 
taking the order of the movements of the limbs as a standard, the 
lizards are trotting animals. The limbs, in short, move diagonally— 
that is, the right fore leg and left hind leg, move simultaneously. 

The undulations of the body are so combined with the movements 
of the legs that the feet are brought close together on the concave side

of the Avave, and widely sei»ai'ated on its convex .side. This implies 
an absolute agreement between tlie number of undulations of the body 
and the steps of the animal. 

It is easy to see from the examples just cited that chrono-photogra- 
phy gives us vastly more information on the subject of animal locomo- 
tion than we can gain by the closest observation, and that, thanks to 
this method, we can, as previously said, compare the anatomical struc- 
ture and the functional characters among the different species of ani- 
mals.

THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL STATIONS OF EUROPE.* 



By Bashford Dean, 

Columbia College, New York. 



Among" European nations the marine laboratory lias long been rec 
ognized as an important aid to the advancement of biological studies. 
Groups of universities, centralizing their marine work in convenient 
localities, have caused the entire coastline of Europe to become dotted 
with stations, well equipped and well maintained. Societies, individu- 
als, and not infrequently governments contribute to their supi^ort. 

Marine stations have become distributing centers, important equally 
in every grade of biological work or training. A student, for example, 
should he visit a small university in the interior of France, would receive 
his first lessons, aided by material sent regularly from Roscoft'or Ban 
yuls; he would examine living sponges, peimatulids, heroes, hydroids, 
Loxosoma, Comatula, Amphioxus. Or, at Munich, remote from the 
coast, as in the laboratory of Prof. Richard Hertwig, he is enabled by 
means of material from Naples to demonstrate the larval characters of 
ascidians or the fertilization processes of the sea-urchin. During his 
winter studies the marine station would thus provide him with the best 
material — sometimes preserved and well fixed, sometimes living', to be 
prepared according to his wants. In summer it affords him the best 
opportunities to see and collect his study types without physical dis- 
comforts and with the greatest economy of time. To the investigator 
the station has become, in the broadest sense, a university. He may 
there meet the representative students of far and wide, fellow- workers 
perhaps in the very line of his own research, and must himself unknow- 
ingly teach and learn. He finds out gradually of recent work, of 
technical methods which often happen most pertinent to his needs. 
He carries on his work quietly and thoroughly; his works of reference 
are at hand; he has the most necessary comforts in working-, and is 
untroubled by the rigid hours of demonstrations or lectures. The sta- 
tion becoming a literal emporium, cosmopolitan, bringing together side 
by side the best workers of many universities, tends moreover to make

observations upon the l»est material sharper by criticism, most fruitful 
in results. It has often been remarked how large a proportion of 
recently published researches was dependent, directly or indirectly, 
upon marine laboratories. 

A brief account of the more important of these stations should not 
prove lacking' in suggestions; especially as in America the work of the 
marine laboratory is often imperfectly understood. Its aims ha\'e been 
associated popularly with those of practical lish culture; and even 
among the trustees of universities a disposition has often been to regard 
an annual subscription for a work place in a summer school as among 
the little-needed expenditures of a biological department. So little 
important has a marine station seemed that the greatest difficulties 
have ever been encountered to insure the support of an American table 
at Naples, although it was well known how large a number of our inves- 
tigators were each year indebted to foreign courtesy for the privileges 
of this station. 




General interest in the advancement of pure science has in Europe 
become a prominent feature of the past decade, and there can be no 
doubt of the importance that has come to be attached to studies bearing 
upon the problems of life, evolution, heredity. Nor, at the same time, 
does it appear that matters relating to practical fisheries have in any 
way lost their interest or support. To these, on the contrary, the rise 
of pure biology has often given important aids. What has appeared 
abstract theory to-day has often been converted into practice to-morrow. 
And even so ardent a partisan of puie biology as Prof, de Lacaze- 
Duthiers does not hesitate to urge this, as sufficiently important in gen- 
eral argument, to vindicate the governmental support of the labora- 
tories of Koscoflt' and Bauyuls. "Facts have been found at every step 
of science wliich were valueless at their discovery, but which, little by

little, fell iuto Hue and led to applications of the highest importance — 
how the observation of the tarnishing of silver or the twitching leg of 
the frog was the origin of photograph;^ or telegraphy— how the purely 
abstract problem of spontaneous generation gave rise to the antiseptics 
of surgery. 

As a preface to the present discussion the general number and loca- 
tion of the European marine stations might conveniently be indicated 
in the accompanying outline map. 

I. — FRANCE. 

The extended sea-coast has ever been of the greatest aid to the French 
student. Along the entire northern coast the channel is not unlike our 
Bay of Fundy in the way it sweeps the waters out at the lunar tides. 
The rocks on the coast of Brittany, massive bowlders, swept and rounded 
by swift running waters, will at these times become exposed to a depth 
as great as 40 feet. This is the harvest time of the collector. He is 
enabled to secure the animals of the deep with his own hand, to take 
them carefully from the rocky crevices where they would ever have 
avoided the collecting dredge. From earliest times this region has not 
unreasonably been the field of the naturalist. It was here that Cuvier, 
during the Reign of Terror, made his studies on marine invertebrates 
which were to precede his Eegne Animal. The extreme westernmost 
promontories of Brittany have, for the last half century, been the sum- 
mer homes of de Quatrefages, Coste, Audouin, Milne- Edwards, and de 
Lacaze-Duthiers. Coste created a laboratory at Concarneau, but this 
has come to be devoted to practical fish culture, and is, at the present 
day, of little scientific interest. It is owing to the exertions of Prof, 
de Lacaze-Duthiers, of the Sorbonne, that the two governmental stations 
of biology have since been founded. The first was established at lios- 
coft', in one of the most attractive and favorable collecting regions in 
Brittany, and has continued to grow in importance for the last twenty 
years. As this station, however, could be serviceable during summer 
only, it gave rise to a smaller dependency of the Sorbonne in the south- 
ernmost part of France, on the Mediterranean, at Banyuls, which had 
the additional advantage of a Mediterranean fauna. 

To these French stations should be added that of Prof Giard, at 
Wimereux, near Boulogne, in the rich collecting funnel of the Straits 
of Dover; that ot Prof. Sabatier, at Cette, not far from Banyuls, a 
dependency of the University of JVIontpelier; that of Marseilles, and the 
Russian station at Ville-Franche, near the Italian frontier. An interest- 
ing station, in addition, is that at Arcachon, near Bordeaux, founded 
by a local scientific society. Smaller stations are not wanting, as at the 
Sables d'Olonne. 

At Roscoff the laboratory building looks directlj^ out upon the chan- 
nel. (PI. XXVI.) In its main room, on the ground floor, work places are

a large glass walled aquaiium room, seen in the a('eoiiii)aiiyiiig ligure, 
while on the other oj)ens directly to adjoining buildings, which include 
lodging quarters, a Avell-furnished library, and a laboratory for ele- 
mentary students. Surrounding the building is an attractive garden, 
which gives one anything but a just idea of the barrenness of the soil 
of Brittany. From the sea w^all of the laboratory one looks out over 
the rocks that are becoming exposed by the receding tide. A strong 
iuclosure of masonry serves as a vlvier to be used for experiments as 
well as to retain water for supi^lying the laboratory. The students 
are, in the main, those of the Sorbonue, and under the direction of Dr. 
Prouho, their maitre dc conferences. They are given every oppor- 
tunity to take part in the collecting excursions, frequently made in 
the laboratory's small sailing vessels, among the rocky islands of the 
neighboring coast. Strangers, too, are not infrequent, and are gen- 
erously granted every privilege of the French student. Liberality is 
one of the characteristic features of Eoscoft'. The stranger who writes 
to Prof, de Lacaze-Duthiers is accorded a work place which entitles 
him gratuitously to every privilege of the laboratory — his microscope, 
his reagents, even his lodging-room should a place be vacant. It 
seems, in fact, to be a point of pride with Prof. Lacaze that the stranger 
shall be welcomed to Eoscoff, and upon entering the laboratory for the 
lirst time, feel entirely at home. He linds his table in order, his 
microscope awaiting him, and the material for which he had written 
displayed in stately array in the glass jars and dishes of his Avork 
place. So, too, he may have been assigned one of the large aquaria in 
the glass aquarium room — massive stone-base stands, aerated by a 
constant jet of sea water. He finds a surprising wealth of material at 
Roscofi', and his wants are promptly supplied. 

At Banyuls(Pl.xxvii),the second station of the Sorbonue, the build- 
ings are less imposing than those of Roscoff. It is a i^lain, three-story 
building facing the north, at the edge of the promontory which shelters 
the harbor at Banyuls. The virier is in front of the station, behind is 
a reservoir cut in the solid rock, receiving the waters of the Mediterra- 
nean and distributing it throughout the building. On the first floor is 
a large aquarium room lighted by electricity, well supplied with tanks 
and decorated not a little with statuary donated by the administration 
of the beaux-arts. The bust of Arago occupies an important place, as 
the laboratory has been named in his honor. A suit of a diver sug- 
gests the different tactics in collecting made necessary by the slightly- 
falling tides of the Mediterranean. The wealth of living forms in the 
aquaria shows at once by variety of bright colors the richness of south- 
ern fauna. Sea lilies are in i)rofusion, and are gathered at the very 
steps of the laboratory. The work rooms of the students are on the 
second floor, equipped in a manner similar to those of Roscofl". The 
directer of this station is Dr. Frederic Guitel. It is usual during the 



Smithsonian Report, 1893.

holidays at fall or winter for the entire classes of the Sorbonne to spend 
several days iu collecting trips in the neighborhood. The region with 
its little port is famous for its fisheries, and one in especial is that of 
the angler, Lophivs, a fish that would not be regarded as especially 
dainty on our side of the Atlantic. 

The station on the Straits of Dover, at Winiereux, has earned a 
Euroj^ean reputation in the work of Prof. Giard. It is but a small 
frame building, scarcely large enough to include the advanced students 
selected from the Sorbonne. The laboratory is, in a way, a rival of 
Eoscoflf, and it is noteworthy that its workers seem to make a point of 
studying the laboratory details of the German universities. 

The marine laboratory of Arcachon, one of the oldest of France, was 
built in 1867 by the local scientific society, and was carried on inde- 
pendently until the time of the losses of the Franco-Prussian w^ar. Its 
management was then fused with that of the faculty of medicine of 
Bordeaux, with whose assistance, aided by that of a small subsidy from 
the Government, the work of the institution was carried on. Arcachon, 
near I)ordeaux, is in itself a most interesting locality. It has become a 
summering place, noted for its pine lands and the broad, mindy phKje, 
picturesque in summer with swarms of quaintly dressed children, the 
local headdress of the peasant mingling with the latest toilet from 
Paris. Here and there is to be seen that accompaniment of every 
French watering place, the goat boy in his smock and berret, fluting to 
his dozen charges, who walk in a stately way before him. The Bay of 
Arcachon is a small, tranquil, inland sea, long known for its rich fauna. 
In large part it is laid out in oyster parks, Avhich constitute to no small 
degree the source of wealth of the entire region. Shallow and warm 
waters seem to give the marine life the best conditions for growth and 
development. The laboratory is placed Just at the margin of the water. 
It inchides a dozen or more work-places for investigators, well sui)plied 
with aquaria, a library on the second iloor, a small museum containing 
collections of local fiiuna, including numerous relics of Cetaceans that 
have found their way into this inland sea. A small aquarium room, 
opened to the public, is well provided with local forms of fishes, and 
like that of Naples, is eagerly visited. Those who are entitled freely 
to the use of the work-places are instructors in French colleges, mem- 
bers of the society, and all the advanced students from the colleges 
of the State. For other students work-place is given upon the pay- 
ment of a fee whose amount is regulated each year by the trustees. 
As at Koscoff, material is plentifully supplied. 

The zoological station at Cette is a direct annex of the University 
of Montpelier, and it will be gladly learned that its temporary building- 
is being replaced by one of stone, which will enable Prof. Sabatier to 
add in no little way to the working facilities of his students. The 
region, in every essential regard, is similar to that of Banyuls. 

The station at Marseilles is devoted in a great part to questions relat- 



510 THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL STATIONS OF EUROPE. 

ing to the Mediterranean fisheries, and owes, in a measnre, its financial 
support to this practical work. 

Villa Franca (Ville-Franche), between Nice and Mentone, is one of 
the most interesting points of the Riviera. Its laboratory is situated 
directly on the mole, a large one-storied building of masonry, with a 
small garden, and with several shops and out-houses. It is supported 
essentially by Russians, and its description has recently been published 
by Prof. Alexis Korotueff (Russian text, Cracow), one of whose figures 
is here reproduced. The station has had as a constant visitor Prof. 
Carl Vogt, of Geneva, and is well known through the work of Dr. 
Bolles Lee. 

II, — ENGLAND. 

The laboratory at Plymouth is quite a recent one, its foundation due 
in the first instance to the efforts of Prof. Ray Lankester. Its building, 
first opened in 18S8, is, in many regards, hardly second to Naples. This 
locality was found well suited for the needs of an extensive marine 
station. Opposite Brittany it takes advantage of the same extremes 
of tide, and the rocky Devonshire coast affords one of the richest col- 
lecting grounds. The situation of the building is a remarkable one; 
it stands at one end of the aucient Hoe of Plymouth — a broad, level park 
whose high situation looks far oft' over the channel. At the rear of the 
building are the old fortifications of the town. As shown in the illus- 
tratioii (PI. XXIX, fig. 2), the building is, at the ends, three-storied. On 
the ground fioor is the general aquarium room, well supplied with local 
marine fauna, and open to the public. The laboratory proper is upon 
the second tloor, divided into eleven compartments, the work places of 
the students. A series of small tanks passes down the middle of the 
room. In the western end are the library, the museum, the chemical, 
photographic, and physiological rooms; in the eastern are the living- 
quarters of the director. The water supi>ly of the laboratory is con- 
tained in two small reservoirs directly between the building and the 
fortifications, and is carried throughout the building by gas engines. 
Tidal aquaria are in constant use for developmental studies. The col- 
lecting for the laboratory is aided by a 38-foot steam launch. 

The present support of the station is not, unfortunately, as generous 
a one as might be desired. The station is obliged to consider in the 
work of its director matters relating to j)ublic fisheries, and is only 
enabled by this means to secure governmental assistance. The build- 
itself was constructed by the eftbrts of the Marine Biological Associa- 
tion of the United Kingdom, under whose auspices the present work is 
being carried on. The investigators' tables are occupied by any founder 
of the association, or liis representative, by the naturalist, or institutions 
who have rented them. The subscription price per year of an investi- 
gator's place is £40, but tables may be leased for as short a time as a 
njontlj. The laboratory provides material for ipvestigation and the

ordinary apparatus of the marine laboratory, exchuling microscopes 
and accessories. Tiie use of tlie larger tanks of the main aquarium 
is also permitted to the working student. The work of the laboratory 
includes investigation of fishery matters, the preservation of animals 
to supply the classes of zoology in the universities and the formation 
Oi type collections of the British marine fauna. The naturalist of this 
station has been for a number of years Mr. J. T. Cunningh'am, whose 
experiments upon the hatching of the sole have here been carried on. 
Other British marine stations are those of Pufifln Island, Liverpool, 
and St. Andrews, northeast, and Dunbar, southeast, of Edinburgh. The 
work of these stations, it is understood, is only in part purely biological. 
The practical matters of fisheries must be considered to insure financial 
support. In addition to these is to be mentioned a station, recently 
equipped, on the Isle of Man. Still another has recently (the latter 
months of 1893) been established at Jersey, in the Channel Islands. 




Zoological station at St. Helier, Isle of Jersey. 

The foundation of this station has been entirely due to private enter- 
pi-ise, and its management seems both independent and j)ractical. The 
proprietors, Messrs. Sinel and Hornell, add to the station's revenue by 
providing alcoholic material for class work, anatomical preparations, 
serial sections. They also edit and publish an interesting little (quar- 
terly, Journal of Marine Zooiogj^ and Microscopy. 

The station will doubtless i^rove a welcome need to the traveling 
biologist who finds, at a half day's journey from England, a richer 
fauna than even Plymouth can offer. It is readily open to investi- 
gators upon payment of a small weekly fee. Of the building and its 
equipment, a brief description might here be given. It is situated 
east of St. Helier, at a ten-minute's walk from the town, facing the main 
road, La Collette, overlooking a picturesque and rugged shore. It is 
but 18 feet above tidal mark, and at low water, especially at lunar 
tides, is immediately adjacent to a rich collecting ground. Twelve 
gqu^^re miles of "zostera prairie" are there exposed, andmay bevisite(i 



512 THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL STATIONS OF EUROPE. 

afoot. And the Miuqiiier reefs, of especial biological interest, are but 
9 miles to the southward. 

The station is a stone building of three stories. The aquarium, on 
the ground floor, is mainly for purposes of exhibition, its adjoining 
room serves to receive and assort the collected material. The second 
story contains the museum and library, serving at the same time as a 
demonstration hall, and upon the third floor are the partitioned com- 
partments for the use of students and investigators. 

At St. Andrews, Prof. Macintosh has studied the questions relating 
to the hatching and development of the North Sea fishes. Its situa- 
tion upon the promontory leading into the Firth of Forth seems to have 
been especially favorable for the study of the North Sea fauna, notably 
of larval and embryonic stages of fishes, and the locality, moreover, 
from its northern position represents a number of boreal forms. The 
importance of St. Andrews is at length better recognized, and a sub- 
stantial grant from the Government will enable a large and iiermanent 
marine station to be here constructed. The facilities for work have, 
up to the present time, been somewhat primitive — a simple wooden 
building, single-storied, has been partitioned o& into small rooms, a 
general laboratory, with work places for half a dozen investigators, a 
director's room, aquarium, and a small out-lying engine house with 
storage tanks. To the laboratory belongs a small sailboat to assist in 
the work of collecting. 

III. — HOLLAND. 

Holland, in the summer of 1890, opened its zoological station in the 
Helder, a locality which, for this purpose, had long been looked upon with 
the greatest favor. (PI. xxx, fig. 2.) There is here an old town at 
the mouth of the Zuyder Zee, the naval stronghold of Holland, a station 
favorable for biological work on account of the rapid-running current 
renewing the waters of the Zee. The station was founded by the support 
of the Zoological Society of the Netherlands, whose valuable work by the 
contributions of Hubrecht, Hoek, and Horst, has long been known in 
connection with the development of the oyster industry of Holland. 
The work of the society had formerly been carried on by means of a 
j)ortable zoological station which the investigators caused to be trans- 
planted to dift'erent points along the East Schelde, favorable on account 
of their nearness to the supplies of spawning oysters. The present sta- 
tion at the Helder is situated directly adjoining the great dike, a small 
stone building, two story, surrounded by a small park, as seen in the 
adjacent figure. In itself the laboratory is a model one. The rooms 
are carefully finished, and every arrangement has been made to secure 
working conveniences. A large vestibule leads directly into two labo- 
ratory rooms and, by a hallway, communicates with the large, well- 
lighted library and the rooms of the director. The aquarium room has,

for convenience, been placed in a small adjacent building. The director 
of this station is Prof. Hoek, and the president of the society is Prof. 
Hiibrecht. 

IV. — NAPLES. 

The Stazione Zoologica at Naples dnring the past twenty years has 
earned its reputation as the center of marine biological work, publishing 
in its MitiliciliiiKjen the results of its researches, and in its Jdhrsbericltte 
a snuimary of the year's contributions to biological sciences. It has 
afforded a locality most favorable for marine research, and has offered 
every convenience for continued studies; it has been the supply center 
for living and preserved material for the majority of the European 
universities; it has published the results of its investigations in its 
monographs and bulletin in a way that has left little to be desired; 
the range of its researches has been of the Avidest and most varied 
interest, botanical, zoological, developmental, physiological, morpho- 
logical. Indeed it may strictly be said that within an equal period of 
time it has contributed more to the advancement of pure biology than 
has any other institution in tlie world. 

The success of the Naples station has doubtless been aided by the 
ricliuess of the fauna of the gulf, but is mainly and unquestionably 
due to its energetic and careful administration. The director of the 
station. Prof Dohrn, deserves no little gratitude from every worker in 
science for his untiring efforts in securing its foundation and system- 
atic management. Partly by his private generosity and partly by the 
financial support he obtained, the original or eastern building was 
constructed. Its annual nuuntenance was next assured by the aid he 
obtained throughout (mainly) Gernuiny and Austria. By the leasing 
of work tables to be used by the representatives of universities a 
sufficient income was maintained to carry on the work of the station 
most efiBcieutly. A gift by the German Government of a small steam 
launch added not a little to the collecting facilities. 

Attractiveness is one of the striking features of the Naples station. 
It has nothing of the dusty, uncomfortable, gloomy air of the average 
university laboratory. Its situation is one of the brightest; it has the 
gulf directly in front, about it the city gardens rich in palm trees and 
holm oaks. Tlie building itself rises out of beds of century plant and 
cactus like a white palace; the fashionable driveway alone sei)arates 
it from the water's edge. In full view is the island of Capri, to the 
eastward is Vesuvius — a bright and restful picture to one who leaves 
his work for a five minutes' stroll on the long covered balcony which 
looks out over the sea. 

The student, in fact, knows the Naples station before he visits it, 
although he can hardly anticipate the busy and profitable stay that 
there awaits him. He has received the circular from the secretarjy of 
SM. 93 33 



514 THE ^[ARINE BIOLOGICAL STATIONS OF EUROPE. 

the laboratory while perlia])s in Geriminy, when he secured the privi- 
lege of a table. He is told of the best method of reaching Naples, the 
precautions he must take to secure the safe arrival of his boxes and 
instruments. He is told to send directions as to the material he desires 
for study; he is notified of the sup})lies which will be allowed him, and 
of the matters of hotels, lodging, and banking, necessary even to a 
biologist. At the tirst sight of tlie building he is impressed most fav- 
orably, and it is not long before he comes to look upon his work-place 
as his particular home, open to him day, uight, and holiday. He likes 
the general air of quietness — in no little way significant of system in 
every branch of the station's organization ; his neighbors are friendly, 
and ho feels that even the attendants are willing, often anxious to give 
him help. 

At present the station at Naples consists of two buildings, the first, 
shown in the foreground in the accompanying illustration (PL xxxi), 
is the older, the main building ; behind it is the newly built jihysiological 
laboratory. In the basement of the main building is the aquarium, 
well managed, open to the public, and eagerly visited. Passing into 
the aiiuarium room from the main entrance, one descends into a long, 
dark, concreted room, lighted only through wall tanks brilliant on 
every side with varied forms of life. There are in all about two dozen 
large a(piaria embedded in the walls of the sides and of the main i)ar- 
tition of the room. The water is clear and blue. The background in 
each aquaria, built of rock work, catches the light from above and 
throws in clear relief the living inmates. The first tank will perhaps 
be full of starfish and sea urchins, bright in color, often clustered on 
the glass each with a dim halo of pale, thread-like feet. In the back- 
ground may be a living clump of crinoids, flowering out like a garden 
of bright-colored lilies. 

In a neighboring tank, rich with dark-colored seaweeds, will be a 
group of flyiug gurnards, reddish and brilliantly spotted, feeling cau- 
tiously along the bottom with the finger like rays of their wing-shaped 
fins. Here, too, may be squids, delicate and fish-like, swimming timidly 
upand down ; perhaps a series of hugetriton snails below amid clustered 
eggs of cuttlefish. In another tank would be a bank of sea anemones 
with all the large and brilliant forms common to southern waters. 
Here may be corals in the background and a forest of sea fans in orange, 
red, and yellow, with a precious fringe of pink coral, flowering out in 
yellow star-like polyps. There may again be a host of ascidians, deli- 
cate, transparent, solitary forms, the lanky Ciona, the brilliantly crim- 
son Cynthia, and huge masses of varied, compound forms. Swimming 
in the water may be chains of Salpa and occasionally a number of 
Amphioxus; the latter, as they from time to time emerge from the sandy 
bottom, flurry about as if with sudden fright, (juickly to disappear. 
Variety is one of the striking characters of neighboring tanks. In oue, 
brilliant forms will outvie the colors of their neighbors; in another, the 



Smithsonian Report, 1893.

least obtrusive mimicry will be exemplitied. The stranger has often to 
examine caiefnlly before, in the seemingly empty tank, he can deter- 
mine on every side the living forms whose color characters screen them 
ettectively. Thus he will see sand colored rays and flounders, the 
upturned eyes of the curious star-gazer almost buried in the sand, a 
series of mottled crustaceans wedged in a rocky background, an occa- 
sional crab wandering cautiously about, carrying a protective garden 
of seaweeds on his broad back; odd sea horses posing motionless mim- 
icking the rough stems of the seaweeds. In the larger tank sea turtles 
float sluggishly about; and coiled anjid broken earthern jars are the 
sharp jawed murrys, suggestive of lionuin dinners and of the cultural 
experiments of Pollio. Aeration in the aquaria is secured effectively 
by streams of air which are forced in at the water surface and subdi- 
vide into bright clouds of minute silvery bubbles. The tanks are 
cared for from the rear i)assageways; attendants are never seen by 
visitors, and constant attention has given the aquaria a well-earned 
reputation. Well-illustrated catalogues in French, German, English, 
and Italian enable the stranger to be better appreciate the aquarium. 

To the remainder of the building strangers are not admitted. A 
marble stairway leads from the door of the aquarium to a loggia which 
opens into the territory of the students. A long pathway of grating 
extends across the open center of the building — whose skylight top 
admits the light to the aquarium below. On the one hand is the main 
laboratory room, on the other the library and separate rooms intended 
for more fortunate investigators. One enters the main laboratory, 
passes a wall of student aquaria, and sees a series of alcoves formed by 
low partitions, each work-place with its occupant, his apparatus, his 
books, his jars — altogether often a picture not of the utmost tidiness. 
A small iron staircase leads to a, gallery, which gives a second tier of 
work-places a ad doubles the working capacity of the room. Here, side 
by side, will be representative workers from universities of every coun- 
try of Europe. 

The library room adds not a little to the attractiveness of the Naples 
station. (PI. xxxi, tig. 1 .) It is a long room, and, as shown in the figure, 
is adorned with frescoes in a truly Italian style. It looks out into a 
long lo{fgii( with view of the sea and Capri, where the student is wont to 
retire iu after luncheon hour with easy chair and book. The working 
library is of the best, and is sure to contain the results of the most recent 
researches. The desk shown in the figure is one on which each day is 
to be found the latest publications. In the upjjer pigeonholes are the 
cards prejiared for each investigator on his advent to Xaples; with 
these he replaces the volumes which he has taken to his work place. 
Every division of the laboratory is carefully organized, and is under 
the charge of a special assistant. Prof. Hugo Eisig, the assistant 
director, has taken the welfare of each student under his i)er!!;onaI 



516 THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL STATIONS OF EUROPE. 

cliarge, and it i.s uot until the end of his stay that the visitor recognizes 
how luucli lias been done for him. 

There is no more interesting department of the station than that of 
receiving and distributing tlie material. Its headquarters is in the 
basement of the jdiysiological laboratory, and here Oav. Lo IManco is 
to be found busy with his aids and attendants amid a confusion of 
pans, dishes, and tables, encountering the Neapolitan fishermen who 
have learned to bring all of their rarities to the station. The specimens 
are (luickly assorted by the attendants; such as may not be needed for 
the immediate nse of the investigators are retained and jirepared for 
shipment to the universities throughout Europe. The methods of kill- 
ing and preserving marine forms have been made a most careful study 
by Lo Bianco, and his preparations have gained him a world wide rep- 
utation. Delicate Jelly-fish are to be ])reserved distended, and the frail 
forms of almost every group have been successfully fixed. The methods 
of the Naples station were kept secret only until it was possible to 
verify and improve them, as it was not deemed desirable to have them 
given out in a scattered way by a number of investigators. 

Lo Bianco has made the best use of the rich material passing daily 
through his de[)artment, and has been enabled to prepare the most 
valuable records as to s])awning seasons and as to larval conditions. 
He knows the exact station of the rarest species, and it seems to the 
stranger a ditlicult matter to ask for a form which can not be directly 
or indirectly procured. It adds no little to the time saving of the 
student to find each niorning at his work i)lace the fresh material 
which he has ordered the day before, often in embarrassment lather 
than dearth of riches. 

A collecting trij) often occurs as a pleasant change from the indoor 
work of the investigator. An excursion to Capri may be planned; the 
launch will be brought to the quay near the station, and the party will 
embark. The collecting tubs are soon scattered over the deck, and 
filled with the dredge contents. Some of the passengers are quickly 
at work sorting out their material, one seizing brachiopods, another 
compound ascidians, another sponges. Others will wait until the sur- 
face nets have been brought in and the contents turned into Jars. All 
will depend upon Lo Bianco as an appelhite Judge in matters of identi- 
fication. 

Many Americans have availed themselves of the privileges of Naples, 
aiul the former lack of support of an American table needs little com- 
ment. Of those wlio have hitlierto visited Naples more than three- 
quarters have beeu indebted to the courtesies of German universities. 
At present, of the two American tables one is supported by the Smith- 
sonian Institution, the other by gift of Mr. Agassiz. 

The entire Italian coast is so rich in its fauna that it is due perhaps 
only to the greatness of Naples that so i'ew stations have been founded. 
Messina has its interesting laboratory well kuown in the work of its

director, Prof. Kleinenberg-. The Adriatic, especially favorable for 
collecting, lias at Istria a small station ou the Dalmatian coast, and at 
Trieste is the Austrian station. 

V. — TRIESTE. 

Trieste possesses one of the oldest and most honored of marine 
observatories, although its station is but small in comparison with that 
of Naples, Plymouth, or Roscoff. Its work has in no small way been 
limited by scanty income; it has offered tlio investigator fewer 
advantages and has therefore become outrivallcd. During the greater 
part of the year it is but little more than the supply station of the 
University of Vienna, providing fresh material for the students of 
Prof. Claus. Its perceutage of foreign investigators appears small; its 
visitors are usually from Vienna and of its university. 

Trieste is, in itself, a small but busy city, growing in active commerce. 
Its quays are massive and bristle with odd-shaped shipping of the 
eastern Mediterranean. Its deep and basin-like harbor alfords a col- 
lecting ground as rich as the Gulf of i^Taples, 

The station has been located at a quiet corner of tlie harbor, just 
beyond the edge of the light-house. (PI. xxxii, fig. 2.) Its building is 
somewhat chalet-like, situated on a small, well wooded kindl, as seen in 
the adjacent figure. About it ar(^ trellis-covered grounds inclosed by 
high wails, and separated from the harbor only by the main roadway 
of the quays. One enters the laboratory garden through a large gate- 
way and passes into a courtyard whose outhouses disclose the i)ails 
and nets of the marine laboratory. Perhaps an attendant will here be 
sorting out the rarities which a bronze-legged fisherman has Just 
brought in. 

A library and the rooms of the director. Dr. Graeffe, are close by the 
entrance of thebuilding. In the basement is the aijuarium room — some- 
what dark and cellar-like; its tanks small and shallow, their inmates 
representing especially stages of Adriatic hydroids and anthozoans. 
On the second story are the investigator's rooms — large, well lighted, 
looking out over garden and sea. Near by is a nuiseum of local fauna, 
rich in crustaceans and in the larval stages of Adriatic fishes. 

VI-IX. — GERMANY, NORWAY, SWEDEN, RUSSIA. 

The German universities have contributed to such a degree to the 
building up of the station at Naples that they have hitherto been little 
able to avail themselves of the more convenient but less favorable region 
of German coasts. The collecting resources of the North Sea and of 
the Baltic haveperliaps been not sufficiently rich to warrant the estab- 
lishment of a central station. On the side of the Baltic, the University 
of Kiel, directly on the coast, may itself be regarded as a marine sta- 
tion. At present the interest in founding- local marine laboratories has, 
however, become stronger. The newly acquired Heligoland has become

the seat of ;i Avell-eqnipped <i()veinineiital station. (Plate xxxiii.) 
The island has been long known as most favorable in collecting I'egions, 
and its i)osition in the midst of the Korth Sea fisheries gives it especial 
importance. Its present building is tliree-storied, of stone, situated 
near the water in the small town on the Jutland side of the island. As 
yet the station has not to compete with its larger rivals, but its work 
has been so designed on the sides of pure biology, l)otany, and practi- 
cal fisheries, that its growth seems an assured and speedy one. Work- 
places are jjrovided for four investigators. Its director is Dr. F. 
Heinke; his assistants, Brs. Hartlaub, Ehreubaum, and Kuckuck. 

The Istrian laboratory at l^ovingo, a favorable collecting y)oint on 
the Adriatic, is to be included among the German stations. It was 
destined by Dr. Hermes, its founder, as the supply depot of the Berlin 
aquarium. Of its work-places, two have been rented by the Prussian 
Government, and a third is at the disposal of Dr. Hermes. 

Germany, however, is facile prlnceps in its active aid in the promotion 
of fresh water stations ; that sitiiated on the margin of the lake of Plon, 
in Holsteiu, near the Baltic, deserves, oven in this connocticm, a passing 
notice. Its building and equipment are certainly as complete as of the 
best class of marine laboratories (PI. xxxiv); its management is an 
entirely similar one, and its director, Dr. Otto Zacharias, has given it 
every care to make its success permanent and increasing. The publi- 
cation of its Forsclumgsberichte has already given it a immiinent 
place among the stations of biological research. 

Norway, like Germany, is strengthening its interest in local marine 
laboratories. Two permanent stations have quite recently been estab- 
lished, one at Bergen, the other at Dnibak, a dozen miles south of 
Christiana. The former is the larger, a dependency of the nuiseum of 
Bergen. It is under the charge of Dr. Brunchorst, to whom its foun- 
dation is due, andDrs. A])i)ellof and Hansen. Its two-storied villa like 
building provides work places for eight investigators. A well-main- 
tained aquarium on the first fioor is open to the public. The second and 
smaller station is devoted almost exclusively to research in morphology. 
It is a dependency of the University of Christiana and is under the 
directorshi]) of one of its professors. Dr. Johan Hjort. With the rich- 
est collecting resources these new stations may naturally be expected to 
yield most important results. 

The Swedish station has long been associated with the work of its 
late director, Prof. Loven. It is situated on the west coast near the 
city of Gothenburg. Its three original buildings, a laboratory and two 
dwelling houses, were constructed about fifteen years ago by a gift of 
Dr. Kegnell, of Stockholm. The laboratory is a wooden building well 
furnished with aquaria, provided in its second story with separate work- 
places for investigators. It is at present maintained by governmental 
subsidy. Its recently appv)inted director is Dr. HJalmar Theel. of the 
State Museum at Stockholm. Its students are mainly from the Uui-

admitted. 

Russians have ever ])een most enthusiastic in marine research, and 
their investigators are to be found in nearly every marine station of 
Europe. The French laboratory on tlie Mediterranean at Ville-Franche 
is essentially su])ported by Russians. At Kai)les they are often next 
in numbers to the Germans and Austrians. The learned societies of 
Moscow and St. Petersburg have contributed in no little way to marine 
research. The station at Sebastopol, on tlie Black Sea, has become 
pernnxneut, possessing an assured income. That near the Convent 
Solovetsky, on the White Sea, though small, is of marked importance. 
It is already in its thirteenth year. Prof. Wagner, of St. Petersburg, 
has been its most earnest promoter as Avell as constant visitor. He, 
in fact, caused the superior of the convent to become interested in its 
work and secured a permanent building by the convent's grant; he was 
then enabled by an appropriation from the Government to provide an 
equipment and is now agitating the matter of the appointment of a 
permanent director. The annual maintenance of the station is due to 
the Society of Naturalists of St. Petersburg. Solovetskaia is said to 
l)0ssess the richest collecting region of the Russian coasts. Its lab- 
ratory is certainly the only one which has at its command a truly Arctic 
fauna. 



THE AIR AND LIFE.* 



By Henry de Varigny, 



Every living thing' breathes, and to maintain life air is as essential 
as water and food and a certain def^ree of heat. This sounds like an 
altogether commonplace idea, and one over which there would be no 
reason to linger were it not that modern science in its exact analysis of 
phenomena has brought to light many curious facts which show how 
varied are the relations between the living organism and its environ- 
ment. 

Before we discuss these various relations, let us say a few words 
about the air itself. It surrounds our globe on all sides to a height 
not actually known, but as life probably can not be maintained beyond 
10,000 or 15,000 meters, tlie air beyond that distance is of no interest 
for our present purpose. It appears, ;uso, that there is no life in our 
seas at a depth greater than S,000 or 10,000 meters, so that we may 
say that all living things are contained in a stratum not more than 
20,000 or L'5,000 kilometers thick. In this thin layer, wherein life attains 
its maximum density at its central part, represented by the sea level, 
all living organisms are contained. It is small when com])ared with 
the dimensions of the earth and the immensities of celestial sjtace, but 
it becomes all tlie more wonderful in view of the variety of the 
forms evolved in it and the development attained by some of them. 

Each organism bears its portion of the weight of this atmosphere, 
a person of average stature suppoiting several thousand kilograms. 
The air contains aqueous vajior, holds in suspension different sorts of 
dust, is stirred by numberless motions; and each of these qualities has 
an effect upon life. 

Chemically considered, air is composed of various elements. It is 
not a simple body, as was supposed up to the end of the last century, 
but a mixture of gaseous bo<lies, susceptible of analysis and separa- 
tion. It is a mixture and not a combination, for its elements unite 
without electric or thermic phenomena, and it is a mixture in which 
the relative pi()]>ortions of the component parts may be considered as 
practically constant. 

Three of its elements preponderate either as to quantity or in physi-

ological importance, viz, oxygen, nitrogen, and ('arbonic acid. Where do 
these elements come from ? What is their proportion "? What becomes 
of them! We naturally ask these questions, and it does not seem out 
of i)lace to consider them here. In our examination of the relations 
between the atmosphere and the living being our chief concern will be 
the influence of organisms on the air, although in the course of our 
study the influence of air upon organisms will also come under notice. 

I. — CONSTITXTENTS OF THE ATMOSPHERE. 

Oxygen was discovered by Priestley and Scheele in 1774. Not long 
after, Lavoisier proved by very simple experiments that oxygen is one 
of the constituent elements of air and that air itself is a compound — a 
mixture of gases. The reader could not do better than to consult on 
this point ^Ir. Berthelot's interesting book. La Revolution Chimique. 
The term oxygen was invented by Lavoisier. Its discovery made a 
revolution in chemistiy and in physiology and was the beginning of an 
era which has been fertile in w(Miderful results. 

Oxygen is a gas heavier than air and is specially favorable to com- 
bustion and respiration. In ],()(H) liters of air there are 208 liters of 
oxygen and 792 liters of nitrogen. These flgures have been obtained by 
the numerous and very exact methods now used m chemistry, and the 
same methods have been employed to determine the constancy of the 
proportion of oxygen. Such investigations w^ere necessary, because 
certain chemists, Dalton and Babinet among others, thought that from 
theoretical considerations the proportion of oxygen in the air ought to 
decrease as the elevation increases, that at the surfjice of the earth 
there ought to be a little less oxygen and a little more nitrogen, while 
in the upper regions of the atmosphere the relative proportions would 
be reversed, so that at an altitude of 10 kilometers, for example, the 
volume of oxygen would be LSI to SIO of nitrogen. Direct analysis, 
however, made by Thcnard of air obtained l>y (Tay-Lussac at an altitude 
of 7,000 meters, and the experiments of Dumas andBoussingault made 
by means of the weighing method, have i)roved that the facts do not 
contirm those theories. The relaiive ])roportions of oxygen and nitro- 
gen in the air, then, may l)e said to be uniform and constant, except 
for slight occasional variations. 

Dumas and Boussingault, who studied the air for oxygen in difterent 
kinds of weather at difterent altitudes, in difterent j^laces and at difter- 
ent seasons, obtained practically identical results, with the usual allow- 
ance for errors. Other chemists, Brunner, Regnault, Reiset, ])oyere, 
and Bunsen, have all by different methods reached the same conclusion, 
which may, therefore, be considered as flrmly entablished. 

Our tirst question is where does this oxygen in the air come from! 
What are its sources ? The permanence of the proportion of the gas 
in the air and the enormous quantity of it consumed by living beings 
and in combustion naturally lead us t<> desire an answer on this point. 



THE AIR AND LIFE. 623 

What we know about it is tliat more than a trillion kilograms are 
contained in the air; that it constitutes nearly half the weight of the 
minerals of tlie globe and eight-ninths of the weight of water, and that 
it abounds in the tissues of all living things. At present, however, 
but one source of oxygen is known, viz, plants, a discovery made by 
Priestley and explained by Perceval and Senebier. Vegetables have 
the property, due to their chlorophyll, of decomposing carbonic acid 
into its elements, carbon, which becomes fixed in their tissues, and 
oxygen, which, on being freed, diffuses itself through the atmosphere. 
There are, of course, many chemical reactions which effect a liberation of 
oxygen, such as the electrolysisof water, the decomposition of chlorate 
of potassium, or sulphuric acid by heat, but is it from such reactions 
as these or from others which occur naturally, that this gas is liberated 
into the atmosphere? We do not know. But the fact being accepted 
that the composition of the air remains constant, there must be some 
processes by which the enormous volume of oxygen, absorbed as it is 
by organic and inorganic combustions at everj^ second in every portion 
of the globe, is restored sooner or later to the atmosphere. Ts it possible 
for plants to perform all this chemical labor ? This is a question we ask 
without being as yet able to answer. Everything seems to indicate 
however that they do suffice for it. 

Although the proportion of oxygen in the aii* is constant, or practi- 
cally so, yet it must not be forgotten that certain local conditions tend 
to increase or diminish its usual ratio. The air loses oxygen in places 
crowded with living beings, in places where substances oxidize either 
slowly or rai)idly, as in public halls, for instance, or in mines, and a 
chemicnl analysis of air quickly shows its condition. Wherever there 
is consumi)tion of oxygen without sufficient circulation of air the pro- 
porticm of oxygen is lessened. These local variations, however, do not 
affect the composition of the whole any more than it is affected by 
forests, where there is abundant ])roduction of oxygen. 

Let us now proceed to consider nitrogen. This gas was discovered 
by liutherfoi'd in 1772, and was proved by Lavoisier to enter into the 
mixture which Ave know under the name of air. It is lighter than air 
and forms seventy-nine one-hundredths of its bulk. It neither burns 
nor is it combustible. It does not serve for respiration, nor can it sustain 
life. It is not toxic, but merely inert, indift'eient, and for respiratory 
purposes inactive. Our knowledge of its origin is limited. We kjiow 
that it is produced by certain thermal springs, the sulphurous ones in 
particular. We know that it is contained in the excretions of animals 
and that they have absorl)ed it from the air they have breathed. Like 
oxygen, it seems to be present in air everywhere in the same propor- 
tions. 

These two elements, oxygen and nitrogen, form the largest and the 
most essential parts of the air. The elements which we shall now con- 
sider are only small and variable portions, we might almost say acces- 



524 THE AIR AND LIFE. 

series were it not tliat analysis shows their i)art in life to be almost as 
important as the fundamental and essential elements. 

The chief of the accessory elements is carbonic acid. Very small 
quantities of it exist in the air in proportions of 4 or 5 to 10,000 vol- 
umes of air. Relatively it is a heavy gas aud distinctly unfavorable 
to respiration or combustion, as Priestley discovered. Its proportioniu 
the air is not fixed, but varies according to place and condition mnch 
more than does that of the other gases. De Saussure discovered very 
marked variations as long ago as 1827, varying between 3-15 and ir)-74 
per 10,000. Boussiuganlt and Levy found a difference between Paris 
and Andilly of o-19 in the town and 2*99 in tlie village. Roscoe and 
McDougall found not so much difterence between Manchester and its 
environs, but at Clermont-Ferrand M. Truchot gives figures of o-15 
per 10,000 ; at Pny de Dome, of 2-03, and at Pic de Sancey, 1-72. These 
examples are enough to show that the quantity of carbonic acid in the 
air varies considerably aud that the air of high places and of the 
country is much purer than in towns. A variation also is produced by 
the seasons, the month, and the year, andDe Saussure notes an increase 
of the gas at night and in cloudy weather. But these variations occur 
in an irregular manner from day today, although they seem less marked 
above the sea, the air being purer there, as on high mountains. Again, 
these variations are much greater in places where the air does not cir- 
cnlate freely and where organic or inorganic combustions are taking 
place. This is not a matter of surprise when we remember that the air 
we have this moment exhaled contains 100 times more carbonic acid 
than the same air when we inhaled it some seconds ago. This being 
the case, we have only to take a close room with one or more persons in 
it, and in time we could note all the possible proportions of carbonic 
acid were it not tliat the experiment is self limited. The normal i)io- 
portion of carbonic acid, as stated by Peftenkoffer, is 0-04 or O-O.") ]>er 
1,000. This may increase in an ill aired room to 0-54 or 0-70, and in an 
ill ventilated sick room to 2-4. In a lecture room it may go np to .■>-2, 
in a schoolroom to 7-2, and even to 21 in an Alpine stable, where men 
and beasts huddle together in winter, stopi)ing the chinks against the 
cold. But there soon comes a limit; the men or the animals die sooner 
or later and the productiim of carbonic acid ceases. They die, killed 
by excess of carbonic acid and by lack of oxygen. A place containing 
more than 4 per cent of carbonic acid and less than IG jier cent of oxj'gen, 
which are the pro])ortions in expired air, becomes rapidly fatal to life. 
But we shall take np this point again when we come to speak of the 
relations of carbonic acid to life. Our object here is to point out that 
the i)roportion of carbonic acid increases largely iu a confined loiality 
and that its proportions vary more than those of oxygen and nitrogen. 

The variations depend npon the rate of production of the gas in 
qnestion, and on that point we know relatively a good deal. Carbonic 
acid has many sources, one of which we have mentioned in passing. 



THE AIR AND LIFE. 525 

All living' beings are piodiicers of carbonic acid, and all breathe, 
although with varied force. Respiration, chemically considered, is the 
combination of a certain quantity of carbon of the body and a certain 
quantity of oxygen of the air; it is a manufacture of carbonic acid 
which is expelled by the lungs. This constant evolution of carbonic 
dcid by animals and also by plants, which breathe like animals, cer- 
tainly varies in intensity; and we know that in the same species of 
animal, for example, the male produces more than the female, the adult 
more than the very young or the very old, the strong more than the 
weak, etc. Everyone knows also that this production is increased by 
exercise, by movement, by sunlight, by the taking of food; diminished 
by rest, by darkness, by want of food. It nmy be said that on the aver- 
age man exhales 20 liters of carbonic acid every hour, or nearly a kilo- 
gram in the twenty-four. The sheep produces more and the bull about 
7 and 8 kilograms. To fully appreciate, however, the rate of produc- 
tion of carbonic acid by animals, let us state it differentl}^ and bring it 
down to a common unit, the kilogram of the weight of an animal. 
The total amount produced will then be compared with the number of 
kilograms that the animal weighs, and we can say that a kilogram of 
horse or ox, or of duck, pi'oduces such and such a quantity every 
twenty-four hours, liy this method we find that birds are the greatest 
producers of carbonic acid. A kilogram of ox excretes from 3 to 7 
grams of carbon every twenty-four hours, a kilogram of turkey about 
20 grams, a kilogram of newly-hatched chicks 56 grams, and of spar- 
rows nearly 00 grams. This ought not to surprise us, for we know that 
the respiratory activity of birds is very great, and the consequent pro- 
duction of carbonic acid necessarily large. 

Boussingault made the calculation, some time ago, that the city of 
Paris alone produces from men and horses about a half a million cubic 
meters every twenty-four hours. At the present time these figures 
would be much larger, and if we estimate the total population of the 
globe at a thousand million, the ('ondusion is evident that man alone 
casts oii" 480,000,000 of cubic meters of carbonic acid per day into the 
atmosphere; in other words, 175,200,000,000 of cubic meters per year ! 
It is difficult to calculate the exact production for animals, but it is cer- 
tainly do.uble or triple, according to (lirardin. We may call the amount 
produced by animals aud men together 700,000,000,000 of cubic meters 
per year. If we .add to this the productions from plants, from the com- 
bustion of wood and coal, the slow i)roductiou from the whole terres- 
tiial surface where vegetable matter is decaying, from mineral sources, 
from volcanoes and their surroundings (Cotopaxi exhales, according to 
Boussingault, more than all Paris), from natural springs, from terres- 
trial depths, it will not surprise us that Mr. Armand Gautier concludes 
that 2,500,000,000,000 \2h billion] of cubic meters of carbonic acid is 
produced every year. And even that enormous sum is certainly less 
than the actual fact. 



526 THE AIR AND LIFE. 

With this formidable aniouiit of production in view, we may well be 
astonished that the proportion of carbonic aci<l in the atmosphere 
remains so slii;ht, for we can easily calculate what proportions it would 
reach in ten, twenty, or a hundred years, and how fatal such i)ropor- 
tions would be to life, were there not some cause constantly at work 
destroying? this gas. We are sure therefore that some powerful means 
eliminates this gas from tlie atmospliere in about the proportion in 
whicli it is produced. Three of these means Ave know, viz, an.mals, 
plants, and the sea. 

Although plants by their respiratory function are exhalers of car- 
bonic acid, they absorb a much larger quantity of it for their nutrition. 
They absorb this gas and decompose it into its elements, carbon, which 
becomes part of their tissues, and oxygen, which they restore to the 
air. Plants are great producers of oxygen. 

Next in order of carbonic-acid destroyers are animals having skele- 
tons or calcareous carapaces, such as shellfish, corals, nearly all marine 
and terrestrial animals which form carbonate of lime. Van Dechen 
has estimated that the calcareous strata of the carboniferous rocks 
alone contain six times more carbon than the atmosphere now has, a fact 
which suggested to Sterry Hunt, the American geologist, that there 
must be some other source of carbonic acid, namely, interstellar space. 
Indeed, if the carbonifevous rocks should liberate into the atmosphere 
all the carbonic acid they contain, the pressure upon that gas would 
be so great that a large ])art of it Avould be soon liquified or even 
solidified. (Stanislas Meunier.) 

Lastly, the sea has a most important part in the absorption and 
regulation of the production of carbonic acid, and thus prevents its 
accumulation in the air beyoiid certain limits. Experiments made by 
Mr. Schloesing prove that sea-water holds in solution a nnich larger 
quantity of carbonic acid than the air contains. When carbonic acid 
increases in the air on account of a production in excess of the destruc- 
tion, a portion of it becomes dissolved in the sea- water and unites 
with the neutral insoluble carbonate of lime that that water always 
contains to form a soluble bicarbonate. Inversely, when the quantity 
of carbonic acid diminishes in the atmosi)here, the soluble bicarbo 
nate decomposes into the neutral carbonate which remains in the 
sea, and into carbonic acid, which penetrates into the atmosphere. 
In short, when there is equilibrium of tension between the carbonic 
acid of the atmosphere and the acid of the sea water, nothing is 
produced, but the moment the equilibrium of tension is destroyed the 
sea proceeds, by this simple chemical process, to restore it. This 
adjustment, constantly going on, is made possible because the sea con- 
tains a much greater amount of carbonic acid than the atmosphere — 
ten times more according to a calculation of Mr. Schloesing. However 
great, then, the production of carbonic acid may be on the surface of 
the globe by all the agents we have enumerated, we are certain that 



THE AIR AND LIFE. 527 

the j>roportions of this gas iu the atiiiosplieie as a whok^ can vary 
but slightly, owing- to the power of the sea to absorb the gasandmaiu- 
tain the equilibrium. 

There is no doubt that oxygen, nitrogen, and carbonic acid are the 
most im[)ortant elements of the air from a chemical standpoint. Other 
bodies, however, are normal iu the atmosphere. Ammonia is one of 
them. It has been found by G. Ville in the extremely small proportion of 
24 grams per 1,000,()()0 kilograms of air. Nitric acid is another which 
has been discovered in rain w^ater iu the proportion of 1 to 10 milligrams 
in a liter of water. Ozone also is found, oxygen that has become con- 
densed or in some way more potent under the induence of atmospheric 
electricity. But as a matter of fact these bodies exist in the- air in 
very trifling proportions and there is no need to consider them further 
at present. Their functions with regard to life are, however, cleaj, 
and we will mention them again further on. 

II. — CHEMICAL EFFECTS OF ATMOSPHERIC GASES. 

Having iu)w become acquainted with the elements of the atmos- 
phere, their relative proportions in the aerial mixture, the manner in 
which they are produced and destroyed, and assuming that it is a 
fairly well establislied principle that the composition of air varies l)ut 
little, remaining the same within the above indicated limits, and having 
shown the part i)erformed by aninuite life in maintaining the composi- 
tion of the atmosphere, we may now discuss the functions of the atmos- 
l^here with reference to animate life. 

For simpliflcation Ave shall make a separate examination of the func- 
tion performed by the several constituent elements of air. Oxygen is, 
to all appearances, the vital gas par excellence, and with it we shall 
begin. It is universally known to be necessary for the respiration of 
animals and men, and its great usefulness lias been clearly <lem<m- 
strated by physiology. Man is a great consumer of it, inhaled aircou- 
taining on an average from 20 to 21 volumes of oxygen while there are 
but 16 volumes in exhaled air, the organism therefore has absorbed 4 
volumes. In twenty-four hours the human body retains over 740 grams, 
or 510,500 cubic centimeters, representing for all mankind an aggregate 
of 500,000,000 cubic meters per day. Children and aged people con- 
sume less oxygen than the middle aged, the latter absorbing 014 grams 
in twenty-four hours, while 375 grams suffice for a child of 8 years. 
Various other conditions also exert a perceptible influence, a person's 
vigor, sex, external temperature, inaction or activity either increasing 
or diminishing the consumption of oxygen. The gas is absorbed by the 
tissues which it reaches chiefly through the lungs and blood, although 
one eightieth as much as is taken up by the lungs is absorbed by the skin. 
All living tissues require oxygen, for all breathe, and the lungs are noth- 
ing but the instrunumt of respiration. The chemical operation by which 
respiration is essentially constituted is jjerformed elsewhere, in the 



528 ' THE AIR AND LIFE. 

tissues themselves. The hiiiiis, notwithstaudiiiii- the opinion of physiolo- 
gists of the last century and of Lavoisier liinisell", are but the inlet tlirough 
which the vital gas is admitted. IJespiration is an operation essentially 
chemical; the oxygen in air passes throngh tlie walls of the exceedingly 
fiue capillaries of the lungs, wliere it finds in the red globules of blood a 
certain substance, hemoglobin, which unites with it by virtue of its 
chemical afllnity and transports it to every part of the organism, there 
to assist in the chemical operations, especially the oxidations which 
attend life iu the cells aud tissues or iu the organs formed by them. 
The result is a production of carbonic acid, the oxygen of which is 
supplied by the air and thecarbou by the tissues. Blood is then noth- 
ing but a vehicle; it brings the re(|uisite oxygen to the tissues and 
carries off the carbouic acid which would soou cause death, if allowed 
to accunuilate there. 

While respiration is common to all animals, it is far from being 
equally active in all; it is more intense in birds than in mammals, in 
mammals than in reptiles and mollusks; ou the other hand, an active 
animal will consume more oxygen than a slothful on(^ or one plunged iu 
sleep, lethargy or hibernation. Yet all animals breathe; none can dis- 
pense with oxygen, and if that gas fails them, they die. 

It is not otherwise with vegetables. True, plants exhale oxygen 
through their function of nutrition, but, as was pointed out by Priestley, 
they absorb some through their function of respiration. With them also 
this function nuiy vary in intensity. During germination a large quau 
tity of oxygen is required and we thus understand why so many seeds 
can not germinate under water where the supply of oxygen is insuffi- 
cient, or in compact soils that are not easily penetrated by air. One 
seed may demand one-hundredth of its weight in oxygen, another seed 
will thrive on one-thousandth or one-half of one-thousandth, but all 
need some. Plants also require oxygen during growth; they consume 
it in large quantities when blooming, at which time chemical operations 
are so rapid and so intense as to give rise to (piite a perceptil)le produc- 
tion of heat. At every instant in their lives they consume oxygen, and 
it is for this reason that large quantities are not kept in our dwellings, 
especially at night, when they produce carbonic acid, oxygen being 
exhaled only by day. Even wheu api)arenMy dead, jilants still breathe; 
their separated parts — blossoms, leaves, fruits — inclosed in a vase tilled 
with air, consume oxygen and i)roduce carbonic acid. If i)la('ed in a 
medium devoid of oxygen, death sjx'cdily follows. 

So then, no life is possible without oxygen, neither for animals nor 
for plants. This much has been determined by science since the day 
of Lavoisier's discovery. 

The hasty conclusion might be reached by some that an unusual pro- 
portion of oxygen makes life more intense, and that wherever there is 
a lack of air life is also absent. Investigations by Paul Bert, and 
esj)ecially by M. Pasteur, during the last hfteen or twenty years, have 
shown how erroneous are such conclusions. 



THE AIR AND LIFE. 529 

Living beings are adapted for life in an atmosphere containing one- 
fourth oxygen and tliree-fonrths nitrogen. Experiments show that if 
the proi)ortion of oxygen be decreased even by one fourth the air can 
not sustain lile. The adai)tation of living beings to the atmosphere is 
thus confiued within narrow bounds, and it is therefore proper to ask 
whether a variation in the opposite direction, that is, by excess of oxy- 
gen, would not likewise be injurious to life. Paul Bert contributed 
much toward a solution of this problem. Experiments have established 
a fact that seems very strange at first, but which will less surprise those 
accustomed to consider the adaptation of living beings to their envir- 
onment. Oxygen, the vital and pre-eminently vivifying gas, is also a 
virulent ]>oison, not only for animals, but for plants; for cells as well as 
for the entire organism. If the tension of the oxygen of the air be 
raised to a certain degree, or, what amounts to the same thing, if its 
volume be increased to a certain proi:>ortion, that air becomes at 
once a death-dealing agent. This can be demonstrated in two ways, 
either by subjecting the animal or plant to an abnormal atmospheric 
pressure or by placing it in air in which the proportion of oxygen 
has been artificially increased. In both instances the same phenomena 
take place and death soon su})ervenes. The cause for this is not well 
known as regards i)lants, but Paul Bert has shown that animals die in 
an atmosphere overcharged with oxygen as soon as their blood contains 
one-third more than the normal ]>roi)ortion of oxygen. The reason for 
this is that the hemoglobin in the blood, coming in contact with such 
atmosphere, becomes saturated with oxygen, and after that a por- 
tion of that gas at once dissolves in the blood, or rather in its liquid 
serum. Therein lies tlie cause of all the mischief, that oxygen carried 
in the serum is dissolved, free, uncombined, and on coming in contact 
with the tissues it kills them. Here we have the method of the proc- 
ess, but the cause is not yet understood. We can only state the fact 
that tissues can not stand free oxygen and will take and utilize that 
gas only by borrowing it from the red globules which convey it in their 
hemoglobin as already explained. In other words living tissues absorb 
oxygen indirectly and will not tolerate it when directly suppli<Ml. 

Notwithstanding all this, oxygen is none the less a powerful thera- 
peutic agent. Like all poisons, it may be administered in beneficial 
doses and a salutary latitude exists between the normal (luantity found 
in blood and that at which danger would begin. 

This poisonous property of excessive oxygen is one of the most curi- 
ous facts that recent years have brought to our notice, and it is so 
clear, so marked, that it can be no longer oi)en to doubt. 

On the other hand, a general statement that without oxygen there 
can be no life would be quite incorrect. Pasteur's investigations have 
shown that while certain microbes can live only with air and oxygen, 
there are others, which he has called '' anaerobic," that thrive best 
when deprived of air. It is so with the micro-organisms which cause 
SM 93 34 



530 THE AIR AND LIFE, 

fermentation. They produce fermentation only when in a medium 
devoid of oxygen, and M. Pasteur was fully justified in saying that fer- 
mentation is a consequence of life without air. What, then, occurs in a 
fermenting medium'? A particular kind of microbe (each kind of fer- 
mentation being caused by a special microbe) transported by air or water, 
or intentionally introduced, has beeu living in that medium for some 
timeonthe oxygen therein contained. After a time, the free oxygen hav- 
ing been consumed by the microbe, the supply is practically exhausted. 
Some oxygen, however, is left in the medium, not free, but in combi- 
nation with elements of the latter; and the microbe has the power of 
extracting or decoinbining that gas and of applying it to its own use. 
As this can only be done by destroying an existing chemical combina- 
tion, the elements are released and, in the process of disengagement? 
cause the characteristic phenomena of fermentation. Thus, in the alco- 
holic fermentation of saccharine substances, as cane or grape sugar, the 
microbe removes from the sugar a portion of its component oxygen, 
thus decomposing it into free carbonic acid and alcohol. This is 
one illustration out of a hundred useless to enumerate. All experiments 
prove that wherever fermentation takes place a microbe is present, 
which, unable to find its requisite sui)ply of oxygen, takes it from the 
surrounding substances by decomposing them and changing them into 
new compounds containing in part the same elements as the origiiuil, 
but differently united. Thus those microbes that are apparently most 
averse to the contact of air, the anaerobies, breathe oxygen like all 
other beings. We nuiy practically coiu-lude that life is not impossible 
in the absence of free oxygen, and at the same time we may assert that 
wherever there is life there is some means by which the living being 
can procure its supply of oxygen. The apparent exception in the case 
"of the anaerobic microbes is therefore no exception. 

Between the essentially anaerobic microbes and those that are aero- 
bic, that require free oxygen, there are of course all the stages of 
transition and it would not be possible here to enter into all the partic- 
ulars by which to show that differences exist only in degree. A 
reminder that vegetable cells, by reason of their aptitude to cause 
alcoholic fermentation, for instance, are both aerobic and anaerobic 
will suffice. " Let us put a beet in carbonic acid," says Mr. Duclaux, 
"we shall see it make alcohol. Let us also put cherries, plums, apples, 
any kind of sweet fruit, whole sacchariferous plants, again their sugar 
is partly turned into alcoh(d and carbonic acid. Under these novel 
conditions of life they in nowise differ from yeast, except that they are 
less able to endure life without air, that they do not carry fermentation 
so far, and that life ceases before a complete transformation of their 
sugar is accomplished. But these are mere differences in degree." We 
shall be less surprised at these differences if we recall the discoveries 
of Paul Bert, mentioned above, for we found that even animal tissues 
are anaerobic. Did we not see that tissues are killed by free oxygen 
dissolved in the serum of blood, and that they derive no advantage from 



THE AIR AND LIFE. 531 

thnt pis unless they take it from the combination of oxygen with hem- 
oglobin? Anaerobism is then a characteristic of animal tissues no less 
than of certain microbes, and yet none of them can dispC^nse with oxygen. 
There is no life without oxygen; yet, no life with too much oxygen. 
Such is the conclusion that has bee,n established by actual facts. 

We shall now discuss nitrogen. As may be inferred from its other 
name, "azote," nitrogen is unfit for the sustenance of life, and any 
aninuil or plant placed in an atmospliere of nitrogen will die a speedy 
death. Not that this gas is i)oisonons, for we inhale it in large quan- 
tities without feeling its intiuence, but it is inert, inefi'ective, neither 
an agent in — nor a subject for — combustion. It has no share in respir- 
ation, and it would seem that its only function in the atmosphere is to mit- 
igate the action of oxygen. Death would soon follow in an atmosphere 
of oxygen alone, through injury to the lungs and poisoning of the tis- 
sues, but when mixed with an inert gas the oxygen penetrates the ogau- 
ism in moderate quantities only. Oxygen is tempered by nitrogen in 
the same manner as the alcoliol in wine is tem[)ered by water. That 
is, to be sure, a very useful functjon, but of a negative order. And yet 
what else can be expected of an inert gas? If however some account 
be taken of the chemical constitution of living beings and of the 
abundi'.nce of nitrogen they contain; if also account be taken of the 
fact that four-fifths of the atmosphere consists of nitrogen and that 
animals will die when deprived of nitrogenous food, as was shown by 
Magendie, it would seem that that gas must perform some other more 
important and active function. Let us take this well established fact 
for a starting point: Nitrogenous food is indispensable to maintain life 
in beings of the higi.er orders. How can plants which directly or 
indirectly provide the nutriment of those beings, lay up a supply of 
nitrogen? The natural answer is, they take it from the atmosx)here. 
But how ? 

That question is one that has engrossed the earnest attention of 
chemists and agriculturists, and in France, notably, Boussingault, 
Berthelot, Deherain, and George Ville have devoted considerable time to 
its study. They ascertained that certain plants obtain nitrogen eithe» 
in the form of nitrates produced by (;ombination of the nitric acid of the 
air with substances in the soil, or in the form of ammoniacal vapors 
But M. Berthelot several years ago showed that there was another 
factor in the problem, tlmt tlie soil doubtless contains microbes endowed 
with the power of so treating the nitrogen of air that it can be assimi- 
lated by i>lants. This theory has been fully confirmed by two German 
scientists, Messrs. Hellriegel and Wilfarth, whose most vahiable inves- 
tigations have been lecently published. They discovered that certain 
plants, and especially leguminous ones, possess the property of thriving 
in soil poor in nitrates, and of taking the requisite quantity of nitrogen 
from the air by means of special microbes that live on their roots. If 
the microbes are destroyed, the growth of the plant will be stunted, if 



532 THE AIH AND LIFE. 

tliey are aided in reacliiug the roots by means of sprinkling with water 
in which rich eartli has been kept for a few hours, the plant will at 
once prosper. Better still, if two leguminous plants are put in sterilized 
soil, and if, as was done by M. Breal of the Museum, a small quantity 
of the liquid, charged with microbes that fills the nodes of any thriving 
legumincms plant, be injected into the root of one of the two plants, 
it nourishes at once, whilst the other that was not inoculated remains 
stunted. There is no controverting this demonstration. The microbes 
on the roots of leguminous i)lants are agents through which plants 
assimilate nitrogen. A new study is open to agricultnrists and there 
is no doubt that other facts of tlie same purport will be discovered 
in this unsuspected field of investigation. In our present discussion 
we need only know that atmospheric nitrogen is retained by plants, 
and, as we know that nitrogenous food is necessary to higher beings, 
and that the sni)ply of such food can invariably be traced back to jjlants, 
we may conclude that the nitrogen of air is an indisi)ensable agent in 
animal as well as vegetable life. Though an inert, and at first glance 
useless gas, it nevertheless performs an essential function in nutrition 
of all beings. Our legitimate conclusion therefore is that without nitro- 
gen there can be no food, no plants, no life. It is proper to add that 
plants derive nitrogen not exclusively from air, iV)r nitrates and ammo- 
nia also sui)ply some, but these compounds are themselves drawn from 
atmospheric nitrogen and our proposition remains true. 

We now come to carbonic acid. That gas, as we know, is in the 
highest degree a noxious element, and without doubt we shall find 
nothing but mischief to charge to its account. It is indeed noxious, 
and we lose no time in expelling it from our organism; it is irrespira- 
ble, and plants as well as animals soon die when placed in a medium 
containing even a comparatively slight ])ropt)rtion of it. Even 1 per 
cent of carbonic acid in air causes perceptible disorders to life, and 
when there is 10 per cent life is in danger, and death is l)ut a question 
of time. The tissues are injured by blood charged with carbonic acid, 
and when we breathe au atmos])here rich with this gas the blood glob- 
ules only imperfectly discharge the carbonic acid that they gathered 
from the tissues, and on returning to these tissues the blood is there- 
fore charged with that gas and lacks oxygen, or, in other words, is 
quite unfit to sui)port life. The reason Avhy these blood globules retain 
the carbonic acid when coming in contact with impure atmosphere is 
that they are unable to throw it off unless its tension in the atmosj^here 
be less than in the globules. Now, when that gas is superabundant 
in the atmosphere, its tension is greater there than in the globules, 
and, in the absence of any cause inciting separation from the globules, 
the gas is retained and suffocates the animal by killing its tissues. 
Before producing death there is a decided anaesthesia which Bichat 
fully proved by experiments, in which he injected into the carotid 
and nervous centers of an animal, venous blood charged with carbonic 



THE AIR AND LIFE. 533 

acid and taken from another animal of the same species. It also pro- 
duces insensibility when locally applied to the skin, n form of anaes- 
thesia that has been long known and frequently utilized. Indeed, 
Pliny tells us, in his Natural History, that marble and vinegar benumb 
the parts to which they are applied, so that these may be cut or cau~ 
terized without causing pain. In this case the anaesthetizing agent is 
the carbcmic acid set free by the action of the acetic acid of the vinegar 
on the carboiuite of lime. 

When carbonic acid acts ui>on the entire organism, instead of on a 
portion of it, as when inhaled into the lungs, it brings about a general 
anaesthesia which has been investigated by several scientists. One of 
these, M. Ozanam, was so well pleased with the result that he did not 
hesitate to recommend that carbonic acid be used for an anaesthetic 
instead of ether or chlorolbini. So far as we know his advice has not 
beenfollowed and it isunlikely that surgeons will ever avail themselves 
of so dangerous an agent. Yet a number of cases are known where men 
were thoroughly infected with carbonic acid without suffering death. 
In all such cases, there has been complete anaesthesia, before which, 
as reported by some of the i^atients, they passed through a most enchant- 
ing stage, when they fancied themselves in the midst of enrapturing 
music and refulgent light. But this stage is soon followed by absolute 
loss of consciousness, and if the poisonous agent continues to i)ervade 
the blood or fails to separate from it, everlasting sleep is the result. 
Accidental deaths caused by carbonic acid are not rare, and have 
been noted wherever alcoholic fermentation runs its course as in brew- 
eries and wine vaults, and where there is a natural or artificial emis- 
sion of carbonic acid gas as in caves or in close or poorly ventilated 
rooms crowded with men or animals. The air in public halls becomes 
rapidly vitiated. As much as 10 ]>arts of carbonic acid per thousand 
have been found in theaters, in schoolrooms, and in lecture-halls, and 
in a crowded stable on the Al})s tlic proportion was as great as lil parts 
of carbonic acid in 1 000 i)arts df air. Atmospheres of this description 
are poisonous, as has been proved. Thus, during the war in India, 14G 
prisoners were confined in a small room at 8 o'clock in the evening. 
At 1* in the morning only 50 were living, and at <laybreak there 
remained only 23, and these were inadyingcondition. In likenumner, 
out of 300 prisoners locked in a poorly ventilated cellar after the battle of 
Austerlitz 200 were suffocated by carbonic acid after a few hours. A 
similar accident happened at the celebrated assizes of Oxford, when the 
judges and a portion of the audience were suffocated through the same 
agency. It may be that in those cases the infiuenceof another poison, 
which in the opinion of M. Brown Sequard, is exhaled from tlie lungs, 
was superadded to that of the carbonic acid; but it nuist be c(mceded 
that the existence of such a poison is by no means certain although 
it seems i^robable. To return to cases of suffocation b}^ carbonic 
acid, we may mention those in which men and animals are killed by 
gas that, after flowing from natural springs, accumulates in neighbor- 



534 THE AIR AND LIFE. 

iiig hollows. These "valleys of death*' have been described by several 
explorers. No vegetation, no shrubs, not a blade of grass grows there, 
the sterility is absolute. The ground is bare, stony, and as if under the 
stroke of death. Here and tliere are scattered the bleacliiug bones of 
birds, mammals, or even of men, who unaware of the deadly properties 
of those accursed places, Imve attempted to cross them and have been 
overcome by the carbonic acid which, heavier than air, has accunuilated 
in }»laces sheltered from the winds. 

Deadly alike for animals and i^lants, by which it is thrown off as soon 
as it has been formed in their tissues, the carbonic acid presents indeed 
the appearance of a death-dealing agent, the most noxious of all gases. 
The best that can be said is that it m ly act a kiudly part in tlie hour 
of death of superior beings. It accumulates in the organism by slow 
degrees on the approach of death, which is almost invariably by 
asphyxia, and it may be that when man is falling into his last sleep, 
when his body is about to undergo the final dissolution, tins gas serves 
to lull Ids intelligence, gently produce insensibility, and assist him 
through the final act of physical life In any event, this is a likely 
supposition, and it would thus -appear that this gas, which is said by 
some physiologists to usher us into this world by promoting child-birth, 
intervenes again to facilitate our exit. 

This is not however the sum total of tlie action of carbonic acid in 
life. It has another function, more active, more essential, of deep inter- 
est, and which we ought not to overlook. 

All animals, whetlier directly or indirectly, feed on plants, and 
plants take from the .soil the greatest part of their mineral elements. 
Nitrogen and oxygen they take from the atmospheie, but whence 
do they draw the carbon that is so abundant in their tissues? Two 
sources of supi)ly are known. Carbonic acid exists in the ground in 
the shape of carbonates formed by its combination witli various sub- 
stances, and in humus or surface soil co iiposed chiefiy of fragments of 
vegetation dead and decomposed. But inasmuch as humus was not 
available for the first plants, its carbon can not be taken into account. 
The carbonates in the ground seem therefore in accordance with the 
opinion of Mathieu de Dombasle and a number of agriculturists and 
chemists who followed him, to be the only purveyors of carbon necessary 
to ])lants. Still the experiments of Sprengel, of Saussure and of others, 
have shown that carbonates were credited with more importance than 
they really possess, and at a more recent date it has been proved by 
Liebig that plants thrive well in a soil destitute of carbonates. But 
whence then do they drive their carbon! We now know that they 
take it from the atmosphere. They possess the proi)erty of decompos- 
ing the carbonic acid of the air and of setting its elements free, releasing 
the oxygen and retaining the carbon in their tissues. The 41,000,000 
hectares of cultivated land in Fraiu-e absorb at least sixty millions of 
tons of carbon each year. There are however two conditions without 



THE AIR AND LIFE. 535 

which this important operation cau not be accomplished; the plant 
must be supplied with chlorophyll, the green matter which imparts 
color to the leaves ; there must also be sohir light, and the tempera- 
ture must not be too low. As a matter of fact, chlorophyll can only 
decompose carbonic acid in the light and under certain conditions of 
temperature; it ceases to operate in cold weather or in darkness, and 
when it is deficient, when there is a lack of leaves, the j)lant droops 
and dies from starvation. For it is a point worthy of our careful notice 
that the function of chlorophyll is one of nutrition, decidedly distinct 
from that of respiration, by the operation of which ])lants, after the man- 
ner of animals, absorb oxygen and throw oft" carbonic acid. These two 
functions are not equally active, the former being much more so than 
the latter, although it only operates by day. If it were not so and 
if the two functions were exactly balanced, it would be impossible for 
the plant to grow, as it would lose through the one what it gained 
through the other. 

It is then chiefly by the medium of the leaves, and in a less degree 
by the roots, that the carbonic acid of the atmosphere is absorbed, and 
in any event, that gas must pass through the leaves, the green ijarts 
fed with chlorophyll, in order to be utilized by the plant. 

We now see that this virulent poison, so decidedly noxious that it 
destroys aninml life as soon as it accunuilates even to a slight degree 
in the atmosphere, is one of the essential foundations of life on the 
globe. If it should disappear from air, vegetation would immediately 
die, and a few days would suffice to accomplish the deatli of .all that 
breathes and moves on the surface of our planet. True, carbonic acid 
by itself is a most noxious substance to life; but when in normal pro- 
portions in the atmosphere it is as necessary and indispensable to life 
as it is fatal when the air is surcharged with it. 

The foregoing are the relations of air, studied from the standY)oint of 
its chemical composition, to life as it manifests itself on earth — of the 
normal air studied without regard to any artificial cause by which it 
may be vitiated — of physiological air, so to speak. 

III. — MECHA?nCAL EFFECTS OF THE ATMOSPHERE. 

We shall now discuss another phase of this comi)lex question and 
turn our atteuti<m to air in connection with its weight. This aspect 
is quite as worthy of investigation as the foregoing, for there is a very 
positive relationship between life and atmospheric pressure. 

As already said, the atmosphere has weight and air exerts a pressure 
on the earth and on all living beings. The pressure varies according to 
the level, being lighter in elevated regions and greater in low regions. 
As the barometer is carried from mountain tops toward the plains, 
then to the level of the sea and finally into the depths of mines, it 
plainly shows the increase in pressure. Slight variations of pressure 
have little effect on living beings; but when the difference is great, 



536 THE AIR AND LIFE. 

when man rises in a balloon or c^limbs moiintaius, or betakes himself 
to places where the pressure is naturally or artificially great, he 
experiences certain effects which deserve some mention. Animals 
as well as men are sensitive to barometric variations, as may be easily 
verified by observation and experiment. It is not always essential to 
carry animals up iu the air, or to take them down in diving bells that we 
may observe the manner in which they are affected by an increase or 
decrease of pressure, for the experimenter will also experience the 
same effects, the nature of which is su(;h as to make the experiment 
superfluous; investigation may be ('onducted in the laboratory where, 
by means of special apparatus, it iS' possible to lessen the pres- 
sure of air to any desired degree, or again to enhance it to ])oints 
which startle imagination, to such points that the air is liqiu^fied, even 
solidified. With proi)er apparatus we can at will obtain a virtually 
absolute vacuum, or i)ressures of from 800 to 1,000 atmospheres; and 
thus have no dilliculty in ascertaining the influence of atmospheric 
pressure on animate life, and in coniirming the conclusions drawn from 
the valuable researches made in this field by .lourdanet, Paul Bert, and 
others. 

A circumstance that should be noted from the very outset is that all 
beings, whether on land or in water, can stand without evil conse- 
quences certain variations in atmospheric pressure. Man, for instance, 
may work underground at a depth of 1 kilometer without suftering 
inconvenience from the increased pressure, and may rise to altitudes of 
5 or G kilometers in the air without fatal results from decreased pres- 
sure. The same is true for birds and most mammals, and on the other 
hand fish that live in great depths can rise to a ceitain level without en- 
dangering life by lessened pressure, without bursting as they do when 
they rise too near the surface. But it is none the less certain that in 
vaiiations of pressure there are limits beyond which no living beings can 
safely go, and that outside of such limits, which vary somewhat accord- 
ing to species or groups, all beings die when the i^ressure is increased or 
decreased. What is the process of death in both cases? That is the 
question that confronts us. Let us first consider the case of decreased 
pressure: what are the symptoms exhibited t Four hundred years ago 
the Jesuit missionary, Acosta, gave us an excellent account of the 
effects attending the ascent of high mountains, and conse(piently the 
effect of rarefaction of air and decreased pressure. " While climbing a 
mountain in Peru," says he, '• I was suddenly seized and surprised by 
a distemper so deathly and so strange that I well nigh dropped from 
my saddle to the giound. - - - Happening then to be alone with 
an Indian, whom I begged to assist me in keeping astride of my horse, 
I was taken with such a paroxysm of sobbing and vomiting that I 
thought I wouhl surely die. - - - It only lasted for three or four 
hours until we reached a nuich lower region. - - - And these 
injurious effects are felt not only by men, but also by beasts."' - - - 



THE AIR AND LIFE. 537 

And further: " I ain inclined to believe that the air in that region is 
so subtle and delicate that it is not adapted for hunur.i breathing which 
requires it to be coarser and more temperate." The correctness of 
these last words, uttered three hundred years before the time of 
Priestley and Lavoisier, is striking. The air at high elevations is 
indeed too rare, too subtle for superior beings to breathe. The dis- 
temper described by Acosta is that which, in different localities, is called 
puna^ soroche, veta, mountain or balloon sickness. More recent descrip- 
tions of it have been given by Tschudi, Lortet, and many others; all 
have observed the dizziness, the vomiting, the anxiety, the fainting by 
which it is characterized. Certain experiments by Lortet and by Chau- 
veau and others have shown that respiration is abated and at the same 
time quickened. There have been noted intense muscular pain, and 
circulatory and nervous disorders which end in paralysis and death, if, 
as happened in the disaster of the " Zenith," these disorders occur 
sinuiltaneously for some time. 

Without describing the opinions held at various times in regard to 
the cause of these dreadful accidents, we shall confine ourselves to 
recalling the explanation recently given by Paul Bert and other physi- 
ologists. It is a very sim])le one; the deadly disorders are brought 
about by a diminution of the tension of oxygen, the diminution grow- 
ing out of the relative rarefaction of that gas, the air being more rari- 
tied, more <lilated, as it were, in elevated than in intermediate regions. 
In truth, Paul Bert's researclies show that in these cases the diminution 
of pressure kills organisms not by its mechanical effect, but by a chem- 
ical effect, by the scarcity of oxygen, by producing inioxi/hetuia, or 
deficiency of oxygen in the blood. An animal immersed in a raritied 
atmosphere dies from the same cause as an animal breathing in a close 
non- ventilated space; both die for lack of oxygen. In the case of fish 
living in great <le})ths, when they come too near the surface the gases 
which exists in their bodies in a state of powerful tension easily burst 
the tissues asunder as soon as the exterior pressure becomes notably 
less than the interior. This same thing sometimes happens to man, as 
we shall see presently. 

The case we have just examined is that of anaiiimal, or man, passing 
gradually from a low or intermediate level to a very high one. We have 
now to consider another case, that in which the transition from a 
normal or high pressure to a low one takes place suddenly. Instances 
of this occur when a man working under a i^ressure of 3 or 4 atmos- 
pheres in the caisson of a bridge pier suddenly returns to the surface ; or 
when a diver is too hasty in coming out of the water, or when an an'onaut 
is accidentally lifted to high elevations by a balloon overcharged with 
gas. In cases Avhen pressure is rapidly diminished death is known to 
supervene in a very short time. An animal placed in a bell glass in 
Avhich the pressure, normal at first, is suddenly lowered by means of a 
few strokes of the air-pumj), will be prostrated and die forthwith, 
although the final pressure may not be at all incompatible with life, if 



538 THE AIR AND LIFE. 

tlie diininntion be l>ronglit on by degrees. We see here some difference 
betAveeu tlie plieuoineiia i)reseiited and those wbicli occur iu the case of 
gradual reduction of pressure, a difference which is explained when we 
examine the bodies of the vi(;tims by the fact that there are found 
under the skin, in the tissues and in the vessels, free gases, a condi- 
tion that nin'er occurs normally. The cause of death is revealed by 
these gases. Blood and all the tissues constantly contain, as we know, 
gases such ;is oxygen, nitrogen, etc., that are either free or combined 
with the globules, and in proportions which vary with the external 
pressure; that is, according to the degree of tension of the same gases 
in the atmosphere. If the barometric pressure gradually decreases, 
the tension of the gases in the organism decreases in the same manner. 
The gases gradually pass from the blood into the atmosphere without 
causing any disorder. But if the rarefaction is sudden, this gradual 
operation can not be accomplished, and the result is tluit the gases in 
the blood and tissues, being i a contact with an atmosphere in which 
the pressure is much less than in the blood, are suddenly released in 
the shape of bubbles and the circulation is paralyzed. To avoid acci- 
dents of this kind men working in compressed air are always cautioned 
against a too sudden return to tlie open air. They have little to fear 
from the compressed air; all the danger lies in the removal of this com- 
pression. ''We pay as we go out,'' as they put it in their picturesque 
language. 

So nuicli for a decrease of pressure, whether rapid or slow. In the 
case of slow depression the harm is done by a deficiency of oxygen, by 
anoxyhemia, and it is for this reason that aeronauts take oxygen along, 
so as to counteract the rarity of the atmosphere at great heights. In the 
case of rapid de[)ression, whether the transition be from a high to an 
intermediate or normal pressure, or from an intermediate to a low 
pressure, the trouble arises from another cause, of a mechanical nature, 
from the swift release of the gases contained in the tissues, and es])e- 
cially in the blood, thereby producing a stoppage of the circula- 
tion. The ])reseuce of free air or of any other gas in the A^essels is 
known to quickly produce paralysis of the heart. Whenever the sud- 
den change of pressure is from high to intermediate, anoxyhemia does 
not intervene and the mechanical cause prevails. If the intermediate 
pressure changes to a low pressure, anoxyhemia takes place if the 
change is slow. Both anoxyhemia and disengagement of gases occur 
if the change is sudden. 

Let us now consider the cases in which the pressure is increased 
That which takes place in the depths of mines need not be discussed, 
for the increase is insignificant, and its physiological effects may be left 
out of account. The influence of au increased pressure is best studied 
as affecting divers, for instance, and men engaged in sinking bridge 
piers. These men work in ;i medium where the barometric pressure is 
high, much higher than in the deepest mines, for tlie reason that the

pressure of water, wliicli is uiucli denser than air, must be oft'set by a 
considerable compressiou of air, equal to 3 or 4 atmospheres. When 
that compression is moderate the disorders are slight, and are confined 
to a buzzing" sensation in the ears, bleeding of the nose, and benumbing 
of the limbs; but breathing becomes slower and the pulse more lag- 
gard. In some cases the nervous system exhibits abnormal excite- 
ment, similar to that produced by intoxication. It is quite natural to 
infer that these accidents are the result of an increase in the tension 
of carbonic acid and indeed that gas does produce the mischief so 
long as the compression does not go beyond certain limits, for it accu- 
mulates in the organism, and, as a natural consequence, suffocates and 
poisons it. But if heavy pressures are brought iuto play, as was done 
by Paul Bert, a very uncommon and quite different result is reached. 
That lamented physiologist, laboring under the Impression that he 
would retard the fatal effect of compression, charged the air with a 
large proportion of oxygen for the purpose of combatting the poisonous 
action of carbonic acid, and was not a little surprised to find that his 
attempts only resulted in precipitating the catastro])he. By analyzing 
the phenomena he found that under considerable pressure, over 6 
atuiospheres, the oxygen of air, by acquiring a very strong tension, 
becomes a poison in the same manner as it does for an auinml breath- 
ing under normal pressure in a medium abounding in that gas. And 
the evidence of the injurious effects of oxygen is furuished by the fact 
that an animal can easily stand a pressure of 20 atmospheres if the air 
IS poor ill oxygen, if that gas, being nnne rare, attains a tension but 
little higher than that which it possesses in the normal air under ordi- 
nary pressure. When under excessive tension, or in too great abun- 
dance, Avhich amounts to the saiue thing, oxygen always proves to be a 
poison of the most dangerous kind, aud it is for this reasou that ani- 
mals and men die in a normal atmospheric medium so soon as the pres- 
sure increases beyond certain limits. Whether the compression be 
swift or slow, it is the excess of oxygen that is fatal. If we leave out 
of consideration all cases in which the changes of pressure are rapid, 
and in which, as when the pressure is suddenly lessened, a purely 
mechanical agent intervenes, we shall generally find that the action of 
gradual variations is not of a physical nature, but exclusively a chem- 
ical one, induced by putting the organism in contact with air that is 
either too rich or too poor in oxygen. 

It is proper to add that habit, here as elsewhere, plays an important 
part.* For instance, Indians and animals in the Cordilleras are proof 
against the mountain sickness that attacks travellers, and animals living 
in great depths undergo pressures that no being on land or in shallow 

* Recent investigations conducted by Messrs. Miintz .and Regnard have proved 
that when carried to elevated regions or subjected for some time to experimental 
rarefaction, a person acquires the power of absorbing larger quantities of oxygen. 
This exTilains the beneficial etfectof a sojourn in the mountains. 



540 THE AIR AND LIFE. 

waters could stand. This however adds no new iihase to the question. 
There are for all, without excejition, certain increases or decreases of 
pressure that prove fatal, and from a general standpoint there is no 
importance in the fact that their adaptations are different, for theditfer- 
ences are in degree, not in kind, and the nature of the ])henomeua 
remains unchanged. 

We are then justified in saying that while the influence exerted by 
variations of pressure over animate life is apparently mechanical it is 
actually a chemical one. Does this also apply to the action of atmos- 
pheric movements'? If we leave out of consideration the ett'ect on the 
chemical composition of air had by the winds and other atmospheric 
motions in promoting a ditfusion of such gases as are produced in abund- 
ance at various places, together with the regulating action of the ocean, 
we shall satisfy ourselves that the influence of these movements is purely 
physical. Looking at this question from the particular point of view 
of this discussion, these movements must be considered as regulators of 
temperature and as propagators of certain forms of life. They nuist of 
necessity be the former, since winds are chiefly caused by unequal heat- 
ing of the ground and air in diflerent places, and, if there were no wind, 
the temperature would soon become unbearable and noxious to life. 
Without winds, the water from the ocean would not be carried overland 
by the clouds, and great droughts would follow. Without winds, air 
vitiated by local causes would remain in that condition; impure gases 
from natural or artificial sources would disperse but slowly. Wind is 
the cleaner, the sweeper of the air; it drives it, stirs it, mixes it, trans- 
ports' it over every land and every sea, and insures a general distribution 
in the whole atmosphere of such elements as are produced in super- 
abundance at any one point. It maintains the purity of the atmosphere, 
or at least its homogeneous composition, and aids in preventing exces- 
sive inequality of temperature. 

Atmospheric movements also assist in regulating the individual tem- 
perature of men and homeothermic animals. Wind keeps air from 
becoming saturated with moisture. We all know how oppressive heat 
is in a warm and moist atmosphere when perspiration is not easily evap- 
orated, and on the other hand, absolutely dry air is not without its incon- 
veniences and irritates the lungs. By distributing in every part of the 
atmosphere the moisture which is pleutifully produced in some of its 
parts, wind does living beings a great service. It is also useful in pro- 
moting the dispersion of a number of insects and vegetables, which it 
carries afar, beyond the sea, to distant islands and continents. But it 
also is objectionable, in that it scatters at the same time the pathogenic 
microbes and spreads diseases of which they are the cause. I shall not 
now dwell on this point, for it will claim our attention later. It is 
enough now to note the simultaneous influ(?nce for good and evil whi(;h 
is exercised by atmospheric movements, the nature of such influence 
being entirely due to that of the objects transported by them. 



THE AIR AXD LIFE. 541 

IV. — SECONDARY INGREDIENTS ' OF THE ATMOSPHERE, 

We have now examiued the relationship of animate life with the 
chemical composition of air, with its pressnre and its movements. It 
remains for ns to consider the relationship with air contents. There 
are many accidental, secondary, inconstant elements in air. Some are 
gaseous, of natural or artificial origin, such as carbonic oxide, carburetted 
hydrogen, and hundieds of others. We shall say nothing of these here, 
for after all every substance known in chemistry may, according to 
locality and circumstances, be found in air, and their presence is always 
accidental. Those of which we pro]>()se to speak are regular although 
unessential elements of air. Among these we shall especially exam- 
ine vajjorized water or moisture and certain solid substances, animate 
and inanimate, not mentioning for the present pulverized minerals cast 
forth by volcanoes, produced by industries, or drawn from the earth. 

Moisture is at all times disseminated through the atmosphere in the 
shape of clouds or fogs and also in the form of invisible vapor. It is 
concerning the latter that we propose especially to speak. It has a 
dual origin. One part is supplied through evaporation by the Avater 
contained in the seas, the rivers, and the ground. This evaporation is 
determined by both the temperature of the air and the quantity of 
moisture already contained in it. Another part comes from living 
beings, from transpiration through the pulmonary and cutaneous sur- 
faces of animals and from evajjoration normally going on from the 
leaves of plants. This production of watery vapor by living beings is 
very variable and is considerably modified by external conditions. An 
animal or man breathing in very dry air will produce a much greater 
(luautity of vapor, for the breath when exhaled is saturated with it; but 
if very moist air be inhaled the production is very small and merely 
restores to the atmosphere the moisture taken from it. All mankind 
produces about 15,000,000,000 kilograms of water in twenty-four hours, 
but this is much more a restitution than a creation. In like manner 
j)lants add but little to the supply of moisture in the air if it already 
abounds; but in dry air they emit enormous quantities. It has been 
l^ossible to estimate, for instance, that a grove of oOO full-grown, healthy 
trees emits nearly 4,000 tons of moisture in twelve hours of daylight. 
Vegetal transpiration is less by night and barely equals one-fifth of the 
evaporation by day. This single illustration will suffice to show how 
great is the iiroduction of moisture by vegetation. N^ow, if one stops to 
consider that in the United States, for instance, the surface area of 
foliage is, according to Mr. J. M. Anders, at least four times as great 
as that of the laud, one will realize how important a part is filled by 
vegetation in connection with the question we are now studying, and 
^ill not wonder that certain physicists have estimated the quantity of 
water in the form of vapor contained in the atmosphere at 72 thousand 
billions of tous or cubic meters. 

This moisture which is diffused in air in greatly variable ]:)r<)portions, 



542 THE AIR AND LIFE. 

dope lid in f>' on locality, time, ami many other conditions which I shall 
not ennmerate, is of considerable importance with iei;ard to life. Air, 
when too dry, iritates the respiratory organs ; when too moist it impedes 
transpiration, or rather checks its beneficent effects. Va[)orized moist- 
ure performs still another function of greater importance. It inter- 
poses between the ground and the sky a beneficent screen which during 
the day mitigates the sun's heat by absorbing a portion of the rays 
and prevents it from scorching the ground and vegetation; and at 
night, inversely, it precludes excessive cooling by radiation. In fine, 
moisture allows the luminous rays of heat to jiass, but absorbs a grt'at 
portion of the dark rays, v/hether they come from the sun, the earth, 
or any other source. The experiments of Tyndall, and especially of 
Pouillet, have jiroved that air, throngh the medium of its moisture, 
absorbs nearly one-fourth of tlie solar heat, and allows only three- 
fourths of it to reach the earth. If it were not for this screen, this 
strainer, our summer days would be at the same time much warmer 
and much colder, as is the temperature on high peaks or that which 
is encountered at high altitudes in balloon ascensions. For the higher 
the altitude the thinner the layer of vaporized water lying between 
the snn and the observer, and under such circumstances the sun is 
scorching. Its rays, meeting less obstruction, overheat everything, 
and on the other hand the surrounding air is extremely cold, since it 
contains but little moisture and absorbs very little heat. So that if 
there were no moisture, our summer days would be torrid and at the 
same time icy cold; we would be scorched by the sun, but the air 
would remain cold, and in the shade very low temperatures would be 
occasioned by the great radiation. 

At night moisture moderates radiation. The earth, heated during the 
day, tends during the night to reliiupiish that heat and to return it to 
the interplanetary spaces. This radiation is considerable when the 
sky is very clear and the weather very dry; a clear night is colder 
than a cloudy one; it is colder on summits having but a thin layer of 
atmosphere and vaporized water above than in low lauds, over which 
is spread a thicker atmospheric layer. Radiation is a phenomenon that 
can not be avoided considering that the temperature i)revailing in 
celestial si)ace is infinitely low, probably less than 100° below zero; but 
it increases as the air becomes drier, and contains less moisture by 
which the dark lieat rays emitted by the earth can be absorbed. In 
the absence of moisture, the sun would no sooner set than considerable 
refrigeration would take place, as it does on high mountains, on elevated 
table lands, in Thibet for instance, or even in deserts like Sahara, where 
the atmosphere is very dry; and such refrigeration would prove very 
injurious and ev^en fatal to many animals and plants. Moisture, there- 
fore, mitigates the heat of day and the cold of night ; it establishes some 
uniformity where extremes unfavorable to life would otherwise alter- 
nate. Let us also point to the ])artit tills in preventing total darkness 
during the night by receiving light in altitudes which the solar rays 



THE AIR ANr LIFE 543 

still ijeuetrate after the orb has left us. It may be said that many forms 
of animal and vegetable life would disappear but for the vaporized 
water in the air ; this will be enough to eonvey an idea of its importance. 
The action of the numerous solid substances found in the atmos- 
phere is as varied as their nature. Physically pure air is, in fact, a 
myth, and can only be obtained in laboratories by using certain pre- 
cautions. Even :it the highest altitudes in which the number of air- 
microbes is small and where they are in most cases actually absent, as 
are also vegetable or animal particles, there are always to be found 
mineral dusts, very tinely pulverized, to be sure, some of which comes 
from the ashes ejected by volcanoes or from the soil itself, and some 
from the infinitesimal fragments of aerolites that have crossed our 
atmosphere. We can easily iierceive these dusts with the naked eye 
on looking at a ray of the sun when it strikes across a room. But if we 
wish to thoroughly analyze them, we must resort to the microscope 
and the aeroscope. We shall then find the most diverse elements; 
desiccated animalcuhe, worms, rotifers, etc., vibriones, infusoria, frag- 
ments of insects, of wool, scales from butterflies' wings, hairs, feathers, 
vegetable fibers, mushroom spores, particles of pollen, of flour, of 
dust from the soil, and finally microbes. But little interest attaches to 
many of these fragments considered from the present standpoint, 
although it is an interesting fact to know that pulverized matter of 
volcanic origin, like that which was recently cast off by Krakatoa, can 
remain for years floating in the air at very high altitudes and, by the 
action of the winds, move around the earth and produce the luminous 
pheiujmcna of so great interest that have been noticed by the physi- 
cists of every country and that we all saw for ourselves a few years 
ago. With regard to life, a matter of interest is the presence of grains 
of pollen which being carried to great distances by the wind may event- 
ually fecundate flowers of the same species ; the presence of the sj^ores 
of cryptograms which promote the dispersion of that group; again, 
the presence of numerous seeds so constructed as to be easily trans- 
I)orted by air, thus promoting their dissemination. These seeds are 
very light and provided with appendices that enable them to float in 
air for along time and to travel over immense distances, and fljially to 
be sown far away and thus expand ihe domain and habitat of the 
species from which they sprang. Instances of this kind are plentiful 
and it were idle to attempt a longer recital. Another matter of inter- 
est is the presence of microbes. Many among them are innocuous, but 
there are also some that are deadly. Cast off into the air by patients 
affected by tuberculosis, smallpox, scarlet fever, measles, diphtheria, 
or any microbian disease, taken from the ground on which contami- 
nated matter has been thrown, these microbes are lifted and transported 
by the air and scattered in every direction, near and far, in a trail of 
death. They are particularly numerous in inhabited i)laces. At Mont- 
souris, M. Miquel found from 30 to 770 per cubic meter, according to 
.wind, season, etc., 5,500 in the Rue de Kivoli, from 40 to 80,000 in hos- 



544 THE AIR AND LIFE. 

l)ital wards, whilst at 7,()()() meters above the sea and at a distance 
from land noDe at all are found. These flgnres will sufficiently indi- 
cate how dangerous an agent air may be under certain circumstances 
and how it transmits death. 

As we have seen, air carries at once both life and death. Each one 
of its elements is indispensable to life, and each one is a death-dealing 
agent according to conditions and doses. That element which appears 
to be the best supporter of life becomes at times a dangerous poison ; 
while the element that is apparently useless and most noxious is shown 
by analysis to be one of the essential foundations of life. The con- 
clusion must be that not one of them could disappear or change its 
condition without at once turning the earth into a naked and barren 
globe, deprived of all animate life. 

On closer examination another fact is disclosed to us. In the very 
felicitous words of J. B. Dumas, all living beings are nothing but con- 
densed air. The i)lants owe their existence to air, and animals could 
not exist without plants. The elements of plants are themselves air, 
and as animals depend on plants, the connection is close, intimate, 
and direct; man is condensed air. And since throughout the centuries 
during which human-kind has existed, that same air has done nothing 
but pass without intermission through the bodies of our ancestors, 
forming a part of them for a time and then becoming disengaged, onr 
present body is composed of the same elements as was that of onr fore- 
fathers. Our substance is the same as theirs. And that substance 
which is also that of the plants of yore, is incessantly moving through 
space in a ceaseless tide. To day or to-morrow, a flower or a fruit, it 
will unite at one time with the sluggish organism of a moUusk, at 
another with the brain of a Descartes, a Pascal, a Joan of Arc, or a 
Shakesi^eare. It never stoi)s; its cycle, of which no human eye ever 
saw the beginning and no human mind can imagine the end, seems to 
be intinite; alternating from life to death, as old as the world and, 
withal, eternally young, it wonld, if it only were conscious, have ex- 
hausted all the joy and all the grief that life can afford and experienced 
all the emotions, the most imble and the basest. 

The air that lately gently fanned our faces is the sum total of all 
life that has been, it is a myriad of lives ; it is those who preceded us ; it 
is the dear dead for whom we mourn; it is now a part of ourselves, to- 
morrow it will proceed on its way, going through incessant meta- 
morphoses, passing from one organism to another without choice or 
favor, until the time comes when our i)lanet shall die and the sub- 
stance of all that was life shall return to the cold eartli, a gigantic 
grave that will revolve in silence and desolation through the unfath- 
omable depths of the darkened heavens. 

And then? Science returns no answer. In the book of nature which 
is spread before us and which we eagerly scan for a key to the future, 
two i)ages are missing, the two very pages that we care most for, the 
lirst and the last. 



DEEP-SEA DEPOSITS.* 



By A. Daubree. 



Tlie expedition of the Challenger will rank as among the most famous 
ever undertaken in the interests of science. The new and weiglity facts 
which the expedition disclosed, as well as their thorougli investigation, 
are admirably set forth in the published reports. 

For a long time naturalists believed that the existence of any life in 
the great sea depths was rendered imjDossible by the enormous pressure 
and the total absence of light. 

Althougli Capt. John lioss and Lieut, (since General) Sabine declared, 
in 1829, that in exploring Baftin Bay living animals had been drawn 
from a depth of more than 1,800 meters, this assertion as well as similar 
ones which came from no less reliable sources, did not meet the credit 
which they deserved. Not until 18(30, when Dr. Wallich returned from 
an expedition to Greenland and Newfoundland, was justice done to 
these assertions which ran counter to current theory. 

About the same time, as early as 1858, the laying of a sub-marine tel- 
egraphic cable between Europe and America led numerous and syste- 
matic soundings to be taken. These brought new ideas into biology 
and geology, and the importance of a thorough exploration of the great 
ocean basins began to be better understood. 

An observation made by Mr. Alphonse Milne-Edwards upon the 
fragments of a sub-marine cable intended to unite Algeria and Sardinia, 
which had remained at a depth of 2,000 to 2,200 meters, should be men- 
tioned here as of substantive value on the question in point. He noted 
coral and shells which had evidently attached themselves to this cable 
at their first growth, as several of them had taken its exact shape and 
were still alive when taken from the water. 

The impulse thus given, scientists of various nationalities, from Nor- 
way, England, and the United States began to organize expeditions for 
the special purpose of exploring the deeper regions of the sea. Michael 
Sars on the coast of Norway, Louis Agassiz and Count Ponrtales in 
the Atlantic (18(57 to 18()9 and again in 1872), published results of very

^reat interest, and equally remarkable results were readied by Wy ville 
Thomson and Carpenter wlio explored first in the neigbborliood of the 
Faroe Islands and afterwards in the Mediterranean. 

Perceiving in the data already acquired the promise of future dis- 
coveries, several English scientists conceived the project of a voyage 
around the world for this special object, a vast scheme and one to 
which they devoted all their efforts. The admiralty, after conferring 
with the Royal kSociety, put at their disposal a screw steam corvet of 
1,200 horse power, the Challenger, which swept with its dredge the 
bottom of all oceans, and whose name will last forever in tlie history 
of science. The scientific commission on board was provided with 
machines, laboratories, and every resource that could be desired, and 
was ]n'esided over by Sir Wyville Thomson, who, as we have seen, had 
previously undertaken similar explorations. 

The exi)edition of the Challenger, like several of those which pre- 
ceded it, was si^ecially designed to search for living things at great 
depths, but it was also proposed in the programme to study with care, 
by soundings and with the dredge, the forms and the mineral constitu- 
tion of the great ocean bottoms. 

The relatively small quantity of sediments heretofore collected in 
pi'evious cruises, and the very limited areas to which the investigations 
had been confined, did not permit the statement of general laws con- 
cerning the distribution of the deposits formed in the abysses of the 
sea. Their geological importance, nowever, was perceived from the 
early researches, and they thus opened the way for special explorations 
in this new realm. 

Tlie voyage of the ChaUmger lasted for three years and a half, from 
December 7, 1S72, to the 27tli of May, 1870. It was made under the 
command of Sir George S. Nares, who in January, 1875, left the shij) 
to the command of Capt. Frank Thomson, in order that he himself 
might direct the Alert and the Diseoverij to the Arctic seas. 

A publication composed of thirty-nine large volumes has acquainted 
us with the numerous conquests which science owes to this memorable 
enteri^rise, specially in zoology, botany, physics, and chemistry. The 
magnificence of the edition, the beauty of the maps and of the plates, 
many of which are colored, leave nothing to be desired. The last vol- 
ume,* under the title of Deep-Sea, DeposlU, describes the nature of the 
bed of the seas at their greatest depths. It is a collection of informa- 
tion for the most i^art entirely new, and the things brought to light are 
Of a nature which greatly stimulates the imagination. 

If we consider how rich is the array of observations contained in 
this volume, it will not seem astonishing that its authors have made us

wait more than sixteen years for it. They had however already par- 
tially satisfied the impatience of the world of learning- by publishing 
the principal results as separate memoirs. 

Mr. John Murray, on board the exploring ship, had the duty of col- 
lecting, examining, preserving, and classifying all the specimens brought 
to the surface by soundings or the dredge, and of making all the notes 
relating to their derivation. Since his return to England this scientist 
has devoted himself entirely to the examination of this large quantity 
of material. 

In 1878 Sir Wyville Thomson* and Mr. Murray were happily led to 
ask the collaboration of the eminent Belgian ijetrologist, the Abbe 
Renard, jjrofessor at the University of Ghent, whose microscopic inves- 
tigations of rocks had already contributed much to the progress of 
science, and had secured him special authority in that study. 

Among thedififlculties presented to these gentlemen were the tenuity 
of the dusts, often extreme, the almost constant fragmentary form of 
the particles, and the change in their nature, effected by the chemical 
action of the sea. 

In another j)ortion of the work Mr. Eenard had given a description 
of the rocks, mostly of a volcanic nature, collected in the Oceanic 
Islands, and had determined with precision their crystalline elements.t 
These rocks were to serve as terms of comj)arisou with the debris of 
the same nature which occupies so large a sjiace in the great ocean 
depths. 

In addition to the collections of the Challenger, Messrs. Murray and 
Eenard had at their disposal the sediments gathered by several other 
English expeditions. Prof. Mohn, of Christiana, gave them the deposits 
dredged in the North Atlantic by the iS^orwegian expedition, whose 
beautiful and important publications are known to all naturalists. 
Besides these, the Coast Survey of the United States and Mr. Alex- 
ander Agassiz consigned to them a series of specimens of soundings, 
obtained by various American ships. Thus, the material gathered by 
almost all the sub-marine explorations, were used in the investigations, 
the results of which we are about to consider. 

The two great French expeditions, vso well known from their splendid 
discoveries in the deep seas, are not spoken of in this article, because 
they were of a subsequent date to that of the Challenger and because 
their i)nrpose was essentially zoological. That of the Traraillenr was 
from 1880 to 1882, and that of the Talisman in 1883. Of the studies 
made by Albert First, sovereign prince of Monaco, the first date from 
1885. 

Before noting the discoveries relative to the great depths of the sea, 
it is well to recall in a succinct manner the knowledge already possessed,

after iTinuinerable examinatious, of marine sediments in comparatively 
shallow regions, bordering continents and islands, and whicli we shall 
designate here under the name of marginal. 

MARGINAL SEDIMENTS OF THE SEA. 

The configuration of the bottom of the ocean had drawn the atten- 
tion of the ancients, and their observations on this subject, as upon 
many others, proves the sagacity of the Greek philosophers. In a 
special work Posidonius adopts the oi)inion expressed more than a 
century before by the great geometrician, astronomer, and geographer, 
Eratosthenes, that the earth, save for accidents which are imperceptible 
in such dimensions, is spherical.* 

After having studied the three voyages of Eudoxus of Cyzique, Posi- 
donius concludes that the ocean surrounds the inhabitable land, and 
that a ship leaving the west with Eurus at the stern would arrive in 
India after traversing a distance estimated by him at 70,000 stadia.f 
The same author states that the depth of the sea near Saidinia reaches 
nearly 1,000 or<jy€s, or Greek fathoms. (About 1850'".) This is proba- 
bly the oldest notice of a deep sea sounding, and it is to be regretted 
that the process by which it was obtained is not known. 

After the immortal discoveries of Christopher Columbus, of Vasco 
de Gama, and Magellan, had added a hemisphere to the map of the 
world, the knowledge of the .sphericity of the earth, of the existence 
of the antipodes, gave rise to many new ideas. Magellan tried in his 
voyage across the Pacific to measure its depth, but in vain. Up to 
that time, that is to say, until the middle of the sixteenth century, a 
depth greater than 400 meters had not been sounded. 

It is but just to recall here the name of Buache,| member of the 
Academy of Sciences, who made in 1737 a first attempt to represent 
the bed of the sea by the aid of contours. In a memoir published 
in 1752 he says: "The use I have made of soundings, which no one 
before myself had ever employed to represent the bottom of the sea, 
seems to me very proper to show in an obvious manner the sloi)es or 
declivities of the coasts, and carries us by degrees to the bed of the 
basins of the sea." 

The nature of the material constituting the bed of the sea, Herod- 
otus tells us had also been the subject of his meditations. 

Strabo, with the penetration and certainty of his judgment, § remarks 
that the sea continues to receive without interruption the alluvium of

tbe rivers and tends thus to fill itself up. He considers however that 
the sediments of the rivers, instead of extending- over all the ocean 
bottom, are deposited near the mouth, Strabo attributes to the move- 
ment of the sea, to its respiration, as it was then called, the impossi- 
bility for the sediment to extend a great distance from the shore. The 
wave, says lie, expels all foreign bodies from its bosom, producing thus 
a purification. On the other hand, the presence of deposits of shells 
in tlie interior of continents had not remained unperceived, and this 
important observation leads Strabo to say that ''the sea has, during 
periods more or less long, covered, then left dry, by withdrawing itself, 
a goodly portion of the continents."* 

This different point of view may give a notion of ancient deposits 
of the sea, and couvsequently .serve to clear up the history of present 
deposits. 

The origin of organized fossil bodies, thus vaguely seen by several 
philosophers of antiquity, was fully confirmed in the fifteenth and six- 
teenth centuries. By a flash of genius, Leonardo da Vinci saw the 
present sediment of the seas in the shell layers of the Apennines in 
which, as engineer, he was making excavations. Bernard Palissy, ou 
his side, without knowledge of this conclusion, was himself led to it 
through his observations in Saiutonge. Simple potter as he was, he 
offered to prove against all tlie doctors of the Sorbonne that fossils 
are the debris of organisms which have lived in the place where they are 
found, "while the rocks were nothing but water and mud, which became 
petrified after the water dried up." No one is ignorant how this resem- 
blance has been since then clearly recognized and accepted in regard to 
the series of strata which succeed each other in enormous thicknesses in 
the interior of the continents. Thus for a long time we have been com- 
pelled to admit that fossiliferous strata result from the sediment formed 
in ancient epochs of the history of the globe, during which time the 
sea covered vast regions which have now emerged. 

The deposits which we see to-day forming in the ocean are the con- 
tinuation of those which.have accumulated there through the ages since 
the epoch when tlie mass of water condensed upon our globe and sur- 
rounded it with a liquid envelope. 

The rocks continually attacked by atmosj^heric agencies are reduced 
little by little to small fragments. The chemical action of the air, the 
physical part performed by the water, the physiological influence of 
plants concur to produce their more or less complete disintegration. 
Continents, upon the surface of which this work is going on every- 
where, are thus covered with the debris of the rocks which running 
water can easily take hold of. Whether such waters are rivulets, tor- 
rents, streams, or rivers, they seize, carry ofl", and drift toward the 
ocean the mineral particles. This hap])ens even with tlie most tena- 
cious rocks, such as granite. This detritus is partially arrested in the

course of riveT-s, hence theaccuraulations of ooze, sand, and gravel, well 
known under the name of alluvium, which border difiterent portions of 
tlieir course, and the even and level surface of which recall the cover- 
ing of water which has s})read them out. 

At the mouth of the rivers, in the sea as in lakes, the retard in 
velocity of the waters effects the operation in the most marked man- 
ner; therefore plains of alluvium are specially developed in these 
places. 

The alluvium is not restricted to this border; it is formed in the oi)en 
sea by the action of a transportation effected by waves, tides, and 
currents more or less constant. These motions affect also the deposits 
which come from the ocean coasts. We learn this from the marine 
maps which give, together with the ocean depths, the nature also of 
its bottom as it has been determined by soundings. Exaiuination of 
these maps shows that the deposits in question are spread out usually 
in flat form and constitute the real submarine plains, com))arable with 
the slimy and even plains existing at the mouth of rivers. Such are, 
for example, the bottom of the English Channel and the deposits which 
border France in the ocean. 

Thus the sea may be considered as an immense work-room of tritu- 
ration, of transportation and deposition. It produces on a large scale 
the same effect that takes place over a distance of a few kilometers in 
the bed of a torrent. Deposition is finally effected in the relatively 
calm regions of the ocean basin. 

In this incessant work of demolition the liquid waters have also very 
active co-laborers whose importance is not recognized in temperate 
countries such as we dwell in. They are the masses of ice which 
accumulate in the valleys around the mountainous masses covered 
with i)erpetual snow. In spite of their apparent immobility, these 
glaciers, of so impcKsing and magnificent an aspect, have a descending 
movement, slow and continuous. Thus they constitute, on account of 
their solid state and their enormous weight, even more than li(juid 
water, most energetic agents of wear and transportation. In tlic 
region not far from the i)ole, the part performed by glacial torrents and 
floating ice permeated with fine detritus throughout their mass is 
specially recognizable 

The Norwegian ex])edition, the labors of which have been i)ublished 
under the direction of the eminent professor, Mohn,* has very clearly 
determined the facts in question, so far as concerns Si)itzbergen, Ice- 
lan<l, and Greenland. The ooze from the glacial trituration extends 
over the wliole bottom of the North Atlantic, and seems to form its 
chief sediment as far as 30° of latitude. The presence of similar 
deposits has been ascertained along the coast of North America, and 
in the Southern Hemisphere as far as about 40°.

DEEP-SEA DEPOSITS. 551 

Mr. Kordeiiskiold, in his second expedition to Greenland, plainly- 
recognized also tlie abundance of dusts from tLe friction of the glaciers 
on their bottom. When this very fine clay has been dried by the sun, 
it is put in motion by the least breeze, and the air is filled far around 
with clouds of dust, so that the rocks and plants are covered with a 
sort of grayish powder, wliich gives a somber appearance to the whole* 
country. The eminent traveller saw, in transportations of this nature, 
not only one of the elements of marine sediments, but also the probable 
origii! of the diluvial ooze, known under the name of loess, in conformity 
with the views of Mr. Kichthofen.* 

It nuist also be remarked that the currents of the atmosphere carry 
across the widest seas terrestrial dust of all kinds, volcanic and other. 
The deposits of the ocean find active collaboration in this aerial trans- 
portation. 

Marine sediments are not composed merely of mineral debris, more 
or less fine, pebbles, sands, and ooze. Solid reuuiins which mollusks 
and other inhabitants of the sea leave after death, are associated 
with this debris in large numbers, and are sometimes deposited in pre- 
dominant proportion. Such remains often lose their characteristic 
forms in consequence of dissolving chemical action so as to augment 
the mass of deposits apparently inorganic. 

It is thus that these various accumulations gradually come to con- 
stitute around continents a sort of belt which constantly increases, t 

In co-ordinating all that was known of these marginal deposits, the 
only ones which had then been studied, Delesse published thirty years 
ago a lithological study of the sea bottom. The hydrographic maps made 
by naval officers and engineers served as the basis for his works.| In 
regard to the seas bordering France, which were the j)rincipal object of 
the author's studies, he himself examined all the specimens collected both 
on the shores and farther out. Tables of hundreds of deposits show 
their exact derivation, their physical, mineralogical, and organic char- 
acteristics,§ and also their chemical composition. An atlas annexed 
to the text gives three lithological maps, very skillfully executed, 
representing, one, the seas of France, another the seas of Europe, and 
the third the seas of North America. 

In certain regions of the shore the nature of the sea bottom has been 
so completely studied in all its particulars that an idea almost as exact

may be foriued of it as if the bottom were not concealed from us by the 
covering of water above. Such is specially the case for the Straits of 
Dover. 

Thome de Gamond, who was the initiator of the proposal to make a 
tunnel across the English Channel, saw the necessity of hrst malcing a 
Study of the submarine ground.* Altliongh he had onl^- his own personal 
resources and was un})rovided with any diving apparatus, the projector 
of this attempt, with a boldness wliicli j)roveshis excessive enthusiasm 
for his idea, did not hesitate to launch himself into the sea in a strange 
apparatus of his own invention. After diving with great intrepidity 
three times in one day, he managed to acMjuire usefnl data for a distance 
of a kilometer and a half from the shore. 

Later, Avhen the same problem came to be studied in a more exact 
manner, the necessity of a basis of absolutely exact data was perceived. 
First of all, it was necessary to determine upon the sea bottom the con- 
tinuity of the different strata of the cretaceous formation, which appear 
very much alike in both the French an<l English cliff's on both sides of 
the channel. A commission composed of Messrs. Larousse, Potier, and 
Lapparent made 7,(»00 soundings, of which nearly 3,000 returned deter- 
minable si)ecimt'ns. Thus, thanks to geology, the enterprise which at 
tirst appeared so doubtful, rested hencefortli upon positive facts ac(;u- 
rately established. It was learned that the boring could be continuously 
carried on in a layer of so-called (jrey cliall' soft enough to be easily 
worked, ami snfliciently impervious not to allow the penetration of 
water. 

Lastly, and <piite recently, after having been forced to abandon a 
sub-marine passage, it was suggested to build a bridge across the straits 
of Dover. The bottom of the channel was again made the object of 
numerous careful investigations. This time the nature of the ground 
upon which the jnles would rest had particularly to be known. The 
exploration made in 1890 by Mr. J. lienanlt, hydrographic engineer, 
furnished the data, and in addition to the usual material for sounding 
and diedging, he constructed special apparatus for drilling which was 
used. Four hundred drillings were made, and not fewer than 3,000 
soundings. 

The marginal sediments of which we have just spoken, and to which 
Messrs. Murray and llenard give the name terrigenous, extend along 
the continents, over a zone which, measured from the shore, occupy the 
variable dimensions of from 10!J to 500 kilometers. They also form the 
bottom of inland seas, such as the Mediterranean, the seas of North 
China, of Japan, and of the Antilles. 

Besides the marginal deposits that we have just mentioned, and the 
deposits of the great depths which we are about to consider, there

exist some whicli form, as it were, an iutennediary between tliem and to 
which the authors give the name littoral deep sea deposits. 

Terrigenous debris still form the principal part of these deposits. In 
fact, among the products carried oif from terra firina, there are some 
which remain suspended long enough in the air or in the sea to be trans- 
ported at last into the domain of the deep seas. It is thus that par- 
ticles of quartz and of other rocks, the continental origin of which is 
easily recognized, have been met with at a depth of 7,000 meters. 

The blue muds must be specially noted : They are characterized by a 
slate color which comes from the presence of organic matter in a state 
of decomposition. They often exhale an odor of sulphuretted hydrogen 
and in that case they are mixed with sulphide of iron. This often 
happens in the vicinity of a continent where large rivers bring in sus- 
pension reducing organic substances. Fragments of minerals such as 
quartz, mica, and feldspar, in very fine grains of the diameter of half 
a millimeter at most, often appear in them. 

ABYSSAL SEA DEPOSITS. 

Until recent times no ocean sediments had been explored, except 
those formed as we have Just seen, in the vicinity of continents and 
islands, and which border them, like belts usually of small width com- 
])ared with the vast dimensions of the sea. 

Beyond a depth of 500 or 000 meters the waves and currents seem 
no longer to exercise an erosive influence. The agitation of the water 
and the mechanical action witnessed in tlie vicinity of land are not 
felt in the abysses unless in excei>tional cases. It appears from the 
tliermometric observation of the Challenger^ it is true, that the cold 
waters have a motion at the great ocean bottoms from the poles toward 
the e(]uator, but the motion is very slow and could exercise but slight 
influence upon the distribution of marine sediment. 

Thousands of kilometers may be sailed over in certain directions 
across the Atlantic and the Pacific without seeing any land above the 
surface, but finding everywhere depths of several thousands of meters. 
What takes place in these vast regions where the waves which toss the 
surface cannot exercise a mechanical action on any solid mass"? This 
could not be known or even surmised before many soundings, made 
over large areas, had furnished their contingent of observations. To 
bring up specimens of the bottom from several thousand meters below 
the surface was a difficult operation, and to do it successfully ingenious 
and ])owerful apparatus, skillfully nianipuhxted, was needed. The expe- 
dition of the Challenger surmounted all obstacles. 

The bottom deposits of the great oceanic basins which differ much 
from the marginal, have received the name i)elagic. We prefer to use 
here the term abyssal, which expresses with greater precision the greafc 
depth which constitutes their essential character. - - - 



554 DEEP-SEA DEPOSITS. 

However worthy of interest the question of life iu the abysses of the 
sea may be, we shall pass it by here, to study the strictly luiueral sub- 
stances with which these organized vestiges are usually associated. 

The thing to be noted before all others, in the central parts of the 
great oceanic basins, is the gradual disappearance of terrigenous 
dei)osits, which are replaced by volcanic debris. 

This contrast had been perceived as early as 18o(i, when the sound- 
ings were made in the North Atlantic for laying the telegraphic cable 
between Ireland and N«nvf(mndland. The idea which had at first pre- 
sented itself was that the scoriacc^ous silicates brought to the surface 
might be only the ashes thrown out by the steamers which cross that 
l)art of the sea in great numbers. But a more careful examination 
shows well-marked debris of pumice and obsidian. Hence they must 
be considered as substances thrown up by volcanoes and probably by 
those not distant from these regions, tliose of Iceland, the Azores, the 
Antilles, or of Central America. 

At the present time from numerous soundings, made in most varied 
regions, we learn that volcanic substances are spread generally over 
the great depths of the ocean. They oftenest form an incoherent, vitre- 
ous, and spongy material, similar to that designated for a long time by 
the name of pumice., from the name of the islands where it was found in 
ancient times. Their spongy texture is due to the gases and vapors 
which were disengaged from them before their substance was cold or 
hardened. 

Often also, the substances brought by the dredges from the bottom 
of the sea are likewise of vitreous nature; but instead of being trachy- 
tic in composition like the pumice fragments, they are nearer to the 
basalts. The small fragments or lapilli are of the size of a nut or a 
pea. 

It is remarkiible that the vitreous texture, comparatively rare in the 
volcanoes of terra firma, should be so frequent in the volcanic debris 
which occupy the bottom of the sea, which seems to indicate that cir- 
cumstances are favorable to its iJioduction in submarine erujitions. 

Mr. Murray (in a communication made to the Royal Society of Edin- 
burgh iu 1870) was the first to bring to notice the importance and the 
large i)lace that substances of volcanic origin occupy at great depths. 
The original character however of the igneous ejections becomes 
more or less modified under the prolonged action of sea water. While 
the pumice changes to an earthy and friable matter, the pyroxenic 
hipiJli produce a substance of brilliant luster similar to that named 
palafionite by Sartorius and Watterhausen. Some rock materials, such 
as the pumice fragments, from their porosity float for some time after 
reaching the surface of the sea before the water gradually penetrates 
their pores and carries them to the bottom. It is thus that the Chal- 
lenger often found in its nets fragments of pumice, varying in bulk from 
the size of a man's head to that of a mustard seed, and usually round 



DEEP-SEA DEPOSITS. 555 

in sliape. This pumice resembled that from Lipari with elongated 
libers and silky in api)earance. Isolated bits floated on the surface of 
the sea, partly covered with the marine animals which had fastened 
themselves on its surface. The frequency of its appearance is easily 
explained, for the sea receives an enormous quantity of rock fragments 
of the same nature from many rivers flowing into it; such particularly 
is the case in New Zealand, in Jai)an, and in South America. 

As is easy to understand, pulverulent material in suspension, coming 
from eruptions, has also been observed on the high seas. 

Let us add that at various times navigators have remarked on the 
surface of the sea an accumulation of pumice under the form of a float- 
ing covering, sometimes so closely adhering and so extensive as to hin- 
der the progress of ships. Such was the case in July, 1878, in the 
south of the Pacific Ocean, according to Capt. Turpey, and according 
to Capt. Harrington in March, 1879. The Challenger, however, did not 
observe in its passage any rafts of this sort. 

The circumstances which accompanied the eruptic^n of Krakatau or 
Eakata on the 27th of August, 1883,* are sufficient to account for the 
abundance of pumice at the bottom of the abyssal regions of the sea. 

At the time of this cataclysm the prodigious abundance of fine parti- 
cles thrown out was such that the sky was obscured by them. An eye 
witness relates: "The sun being in mid-heaven, there was no light in 
the sky nor even a diffuse trace at the horizon, and this horrible night 
lasted eighteen hours. The ship Loudon was obliged to remain still 
where it was in view of the peril awaiting it." Some hours later, on the 
28th of August, 500 kilometers west of the Straits of Sunda, the ship 
le Salazie met a violent storm, accompanied with lightning and fearful 
claps of thunder ; after an interval of a few minutes the rain was rei)la('ed 
for thirty-six hours with sand which blinded the travellers, and soon 
after that by a white and iuqjalpable dust, composed of pumice, so that 
at daybreak the sliii) appeared as though covered with snow. 

The important share of fragmentary volcanic ejections in the depths 
of the sea thus receives an easy explanation as we shall see. 

In regard to volcanoes situated upon continents, the extremely small 
particles known under the erroneous name of ashes and the little peb- 
bles, grains, or lapilli, on account of their small size, are often carried 
by atmospheric currents to considerable distances and a great jiart of 
them reach the sea where they are finally deposited. The transporta- 
tion of verj' fine particles has so to speak no limit, both in the air and 
in water which is in motion. 

In addition to sub-aerial volcanoes, there are some whose opening or 
crater is submarine, so that the bottom of tlie sea is frequently the

556 iDEEP-SEA. DEiPOSlTS. 

seat of the eruption. Kecent soundings have revealed in tlie Great 
Ocean the presence of isolated and conical mountains, having the form 
characteristic of volcanoes and rising from the deep without however 
reaching the surface. Although circumstances do not favor their obser- 
vation, submarine eruptions seem to be numerous. In many cases 
eru})tions are betrayed by sulphurous emanations, columns of vapor, 
ejections of ashes, scorise, and pumice. Sometimes there appear 
islands formed of the incoherent debris which disappear later, as has 
been seen in the Mediterranean, as in the Atlantic — in the neighborhood 
of the Azores, and in the Pacific Ocean. 

After the eruption of Krakatau an enormous deposit of this incohe- 
rent matter covered the whole country; its thickness over a radius of 
15 kilometers was from UO to 40 and sometimes SO meters. Two islands, 
Stears-Eiland and Calmeyer-Eiland, foruied by these ejections, were 
thrown up. There was formed also in a few hours an immense floating 
barrier of pumice, which closed the Bay of Kampong in the Straits of 
Sunda. The length of the barrier was nearly 30 kilometers by a width 
of more than 1 kilometer and a depth of 4 to 5 meters, or 150,000,000 
of cubic meters of i)rojectiles. It could then be seen how the wear and 
trituration of this friable material rubbing together is effected in the sea. 
Hitting and rubbing against each other, the stones became round and 
acquired the form of rolled pebbles, as generally shown in the ])nmice 
fished or dredged from the ocean. On the other hand, this trituration 
caused a multitude of very small S[)linters, similar in appearance and in 
mineralogical composition according to the examination made by Mr. 
lienard to the pulverized pumice brought up so abundantly bj^ the 
dredges from the great depths. Mr. Verbeek estimates that the total 
volume of sand and cinders from this formidable cataclysm reached 18 
cubic kilometers. Enormous as is this vokime, it was exceeded by that 
thrown up by Timboro, or Tambora, in 1815, the volume of which was 
at least, it is said, 150 cubic kilometers. 

The oceanic basins are favorably situated to receive from many 
points, and quite frequently, volcanic ejections; the general distribu- 
tion of volcanoes on the surface of the globe explains the considerable 
part which th<4r ejections occupy in the sea depths. In fact, the largest 
number of them, about seven-eighths, are situated in the long lineal 
series which wind about the Pacific Ocean as well as about many islands 
in that ocean. The circumference of this immense mass of water may 
be compared to a ring of fire where the volcanic action is scarcely ever 
interrupted. The Atlantic shows also numerous centers of activity of 
the same nature, both in the archipelagoes and in the continents which 
they border. 

It must therefore happen that the small particles, ashes, and lapilH, 
which are projected from the eru])tive openings of our planet, reach (for 
the most part), by reason of their fineness, to the great oceans ; if they do 
not fall directly into them they are carried to them by the currents of 
air, and often to great distances from the crater whence they issued.

MINERAL SUBSTANCES OF EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL ORIGIN. 

Amoug- tlie substances which have been met in deep-sea deposits, 
there are some to which it does not seem to the authors possible to 
attribute a terrestrial origin. On account of their rarity they form 
only an insignificant portion of the deposits; but the interest they 
present results from the cosmic origin which we are led to attribute to 
them. In 1876 Mr. Murray called attention to the singular character 
of these particles. 

In the midst of the portions which can be extracted by the magnet 
from certain muds of the abyss black microscopic globules are found, 
the interior of which consists of metallic iron, and they are covered 
with a pellicle of magnetic oxide. Traces of cobalt are found in them. 

With these metallic spherules are associated others of the nature of 
stones; they are brown and of a bronze luster; their diameter aver- 
ages a half a millimeter and never reaches twice that dimension. 
Microscopic examination proves that they are not strictly spherical, 
that their surface instead of being smooth is striated, and that their 
structure is laminated, taking an eccentric arrangement. These small 
bodies have then the texture as well as the form of those which 
abound in stony meteorites and which are characteristic of them. 
Like the latter, which (lustav Rose has designated under the name of 
chondrnles, they consist of a silicate belonging to the species enstatite 
or bronzite. If we assume a meteorite to fall into the sea and become 
disintegrated, it will be easy for us to understand that such globules 
would l)e disengaged. 

The metallic globules resemble wholly, in exterior appearance, those 
which are produced when bits of iron at white heat tiy into the air, 
such for instance as are prod^^iced by the blow of the lianmier on the 
anvil. Similar ones are doubtless produced when meteorites throw off 
sparks in traversing the atmosphere with great rapidity heated to 
incandescence. Messrs. Murray and Kenard consider themselves, there- 
fore, authorized to designate the metallic dusts, as well as the stony 
globules, as cosmic dusts. 

It appears from a great number of examples that the cosmic dusts 
are found specially in the red clay which occupies the great depths of 
the Pacitic, for from all continental land. Under these conditions the 
deposit seems to be of slight thickness and to be effected with extreme 
slowness. Facts which we witness daily render it easy to understand 
a cosmic co-operation in the building up of sub-marine deposts. 

Every one has noticed the abundance of dust contained in the atmos- 
phere that a ray of sun entering a dark room suffices to reveal. Such 
dust is still more apparent in the layer which settles upon all the objects 
in an uninhabited place, and even in the open country where the air is 
comparatively tranquil. It is more and more the unanimous opinion 
that the atmosphere is no less active a vehicle than water in the forma- 
tion of sedimentary deposits. 



558 DEEP-SEA DEPOSITS. 

Many observers have catalogued the substances contained in atmos- 
pheric dusts. We need not mention here the organic and organized 
particles, among which, as Mr. Pasteur and his pupils have shown us, 
microbes occupy such a preponderant i)lace. What interests us is that 
the mineral grains are also prodigiously abundant. This mineral por- 
tion consists principally in very minute debris of terrestrial rocks, 
which, in spite of their extremely small dimensions, can be exactly 
determined by the microscope — such as quartz, limestone, the volcanic 
silicates, and oxide of iron, which are easily diagnosed. 

In the course of these microscopic examinations, minute substances 
have been found differing- entirely by their spherical form from the 
small fragments j^roduced by the crushing- of rocks. The substances 
in question resemble exactly the hollow globules or vesicles of oxide 
which the quick combustion of metallic iron gives for example, when the 
old-fashioned tinder box is used or when a horse's shoe strikes sparks 
from the pavement. It is legitimate, however, not to consider all these 
globules as having an artificial origin. 

Two classes of considerations may be appealed to on this subject. 

First, it is demonstrated that lumps formed of metallic iron or 
containing granules of that metal, reach us from celestial space and 
undergo in the higher regions of the atmosphere an artificial combus- 
tion. The latter fact is manifested by the long trains of smoke, often 
persistent, which accompany the meteorites. They contain very prob- 
ably globules analogous to those i:>roduced from horse-shoes on the 
pavement. 

In several circumstances the enormous volume of the dust in question 
has been ascertained from the clouds or trails which have accompanied 
the fall of celestial bodies. By reason of the importance of the fact, 
we will cite several examples. 

At the time of the fall of the holosiderite, or iron of Hraschina, near 
Agram (May 26, 1731), there was perceived, after the explosion, a black 
cloud which lasted, it is said, for three hours and a half after the fall. 

At the moment of tlie fall of the iron of Braunau, in Hungary, 
which took place July 11, 1847, many persons, warned by two violent 
reports, remarked a small black cloud which appeared horizontally, 
with the accompaniment of violent reports; two globes of fire, which 
issu.ed from the cloud, fell upon the ground. The cloud became gray 
and then disappeared. 

The mass from which, on the 14th of May, 1803, chondritic meteorites 
fell in the environs of Orgueil (Tarn et Garonne), gave forth a jet of 
sparks; then left behind it a trail, which was at first luminous, and then 
changed to a cloud, lasting from eight to ten minutes. 

Before the explosion of the meteorite to which we owe the aero- 
lites which fell on the 9th of December, 1858, at Ausson and at Chirac, 
near Montrejeau (Haute Garonne), a considerable jet of incandescent 
gmoke was seen to escape from the uucleus, A cloud of whitisU 



DEEP-SEA DEPOSITS. 559 

vapor formed in the center of the explosion, and a trail of the same 
vapor lasted with this cloud over the whole line followed by the 
meteor. 

The tall at Aigle, May 20, 1803, according to the circumstantial nar- 
rative of Biot, was announced by a flaming globe accompanied by 
a violent explosion which lasted five or six uiinutes; it was at first 
like four cannon shots, tlien a discharge resembling a volley of mus- 
ketry. This noise came from a small, very high cloud of a rectangular 
shape which seemed motionless all the time the phenomena lasted. 

Beside the fall of meteorites, properly so-called, it is certain that 
cosmic dusts also fall. They have not attracted as much atten- 
tion as they should, for it is difticult to distinguish them from those of 
terrestrial origin, which are incomparably the most numerous. They 
are recognized however, when preceded by the remarkable phenomena 
of light and noise which we have just mentioned. The catalogue i)ub- 
lished by Chladni in 1824 informs us of several examples, among which 
is tlie following: In 1810, in Montreal, Canada, a black rain was 
observed, accompanied by an extraordinary darkening of the sky, and 
reports like those from artillery, and very brilliant lights. At first it 
was supposed to be a tire in a neighboring forest, coinciding with a 
violent storm. But the wliole phenomenon and the examination of the 
matter which fell proved that it was due to the arrival in the atmos- 
phere of substances foreign to our globe. 

There fell at Lcebau, in Saxony, January 13, 183o, a i)owder formed 
of magnetic oxide. This fall followed the explosion of a bolide which 
moved, it was said, with extraordinary swiftness, and the flashes from 
which seemed to burn in }»assing tlirough the atmosphere. 

The chondritic meteorites of Orgueil, the appearance of which in the 
atmosphere has been mentioned, and which are so interesting from 
many points of view, were very instructive with regard to the existence 
of meteoric dust. They are friable to such a degree that several speci- 
mens were reduced to powder by simple pressure between the fingers. 
It is a matter of astonishment that they reached the surface of the globe 
whole. Perhaps this fact may be explained by presenting the two follow- 
ing circumstances : At firsteach fragment was enveloped at themoment 
of fall with a vitrified crust more solid than the rest of the mass. 
Also, the various portions of the substance are cemented by alkaline 
salts. Water in dissolving this cement brings about the complete disin- 
tegration of the meteorite, which turns to powder of the most extreme 
tenuity. So that if on the 14th of May, 1864, the sky, instead of being 
perfectly clear had been rainy, or merely covered with clouds through 
which the stones would have had to pass, nothing could have been 
gathered up but a viscous mud, the fall of which has been observed on 
several occasions. 

In addition to the facts derived from contemporary phenomena, a 
second argument for ])elief in the cosmic origin of certain ferruginous

globules collected .in atmosj)lieric dust arises from the discovery that 
has beeu made of quite siiuilar globules iu sedimeuts anterior to the 
existence of man, several of which date even from very remote geolog- 
ical periods. To limit our exainples, we will mention, according to 
Messrs. G. Tissandier and Stanilas Meunier,* the abundance of the 
small bodies in question in the green sand and the clays under the sheet 
of bubbling water of the artesian wells of Paris. 

This cosmic origin makes it clear how similar dust would abound in 
regions far removed from any inhabited place. At the summit of the 
highest mountains, upon Mont Blanc, for example, the melted snow 
water gives a sediment in Miiich the globules we speak of are not 
wanting. 

The presence of nickel in certain dust seems to confirm their extra- 
terrestrial origin. Such was the case with those which Mr. Albert 
Tissandier collected on the col des Tours at 2,710 meters of altitude, on 
the occasion of his ascension in 1877. 

From the limited number of falling meteorites, the products of which 
are collected each year, a very incomplete idea is formed of their fre- 
quency. The enormous majority necessarily escapes the most eager 
search even in the midst of the densest populations, either being dis- 
guised in the vegetation, on account of their usual smallnessof size, or 
else because they enter the soil. The largest number also fall in unin- 
habited or savage countries and specially in the basin of the seas. 

It is thus recognized <i iwiori that cosmic dusts must exist not only 
on the surface of continents, but also on the basin of oceans. 

Without diminishing the incontestable importance of the facts just 
set forth, there must also be taken into account certain geological 
plienomena to which the mineral globules may owe their birth. Such 
is the opening of vertical canals like volcanic chimneys, which under 
the names of (liatrones traverse the terrestrial crust, the production of 
which I liave recently realized by the experimental method,! 

The perforation of different rocks, traversed by currents of gas which 
has at the same time a very strong pressure, a great swiftness, and a 
high temperature must have produced dusts, the spheroidal grains of 
which, often hollow, are very abundant. 

CHEMICAL AND MINERALOGICAL PRODU' TIONS FORMED ON THE 
GREAT OCEAN BOTTOMS. 

We see every day on the continents rocks of very different kinds 
chemically modified under the mere action of air and water, and tlnis 
giving birth to new substances. In the same way the deposits formed 
iu the depths of the sea have not escaped certain chemical actions, in 
spite of the temperature near zero which reigns there. A state of

extreme fineness renders them all tlie more susceptible of influence. 
The mineral substances which sea water holds in solution contribute 
no doubt actively in these modifications. 

Before the expedition of the ChaVicnger the results of these reactions 
and the mineral species i)roduced therefrom were, for the most part, 
unknown, although such species occupy a large portion of the ocean 
bed. The exact study which has been made of them by the Challenger 
constitutes for geologists and mineralogists perhaps the most interest- 
ing part of the exploration. We will review in succession the species 
which have been ascertained. 

Red da I/. — Of all marine sediments the tyi»e most widely spread over 
the deep seas has received the name of red clay. It is essentially a 
hydrated silicate of alumina, the color of which is due to an intimate 
mixture of [)eroxide of iron ; sometimes also it takes a brown (;oIor from 
the oxide of manganese. Plastic, like most of the clays, greasy to the 
touch, it can be molded in the fingers. When dry it adheres in a cohe- 
rent mass, and subjected to the blow-pipe, it is fused into a black, mag- 
netic globule. 

In spite of its homogeneous appearance it is rare that red clay is not 
mixed with very small fragments of pumice and other volcanic produc- 
tions. When they are not recognizable by the naked eye this debris 
reveals its granular nature to the touch. Accidentally red clay may 
also contain detritus of continental origin, drifted by floating ice or 
carried far by winds. All this debris is very fine, and it rarely exceeds 
one-twentieth of a millimeter. 

Usually led clay is associated with calcareous and siliceous debris, 
coming from organisms of a microscopic size, which have been men- 
tioned above. These organisms are mixed in variable proportions, and 
sometimes predominate so as to greatly modify their aspect. Hence the 
names (jlobigcrlna ooze and radiolarlan ooze, according as one or the 
other of those beings characterize it. Each of these categories of 
deposits in the great bottoms occupies vast extents. (The area of the 
radiolarian ooze extends si)ecially between latitudes 20 degrees north 
and 10 degrees south; the globigerina oozes occupy nearly 110 degrees 
of latitude, aiul attain sometimes 5,000 meters in depth. Both disap- 
pear near the polar regions.) The terrigenous deposits represent only 
14 per (^ent of the superficies of sea bottoms, the red clay occupies 38 
per cent, and the globigerina mud 30 per cent. The diatomacea, a sort 
of alg;e with a siliceous skeleton, specially abound toward the polar 
regions. Thus, as we have said, these various organisms have lived 
for the most part in the waters of the surface, whence their solid debris 
have fallen after death into the depths. Vast regions of the Pacific, of 
the Atlantic, and of the Indian Ocean are occupied with red clay, 
associated with microscopic organisms. According to a numerous 
series of soundings, as the depth is greater, the calcareous shell of 
various organisms disappears gradually from the slimy sediment, so

that finally, far from the surface nothing- is found but the red clay, 
entirely without lime, under organized form. The shells of pteropods 
disappear first, then the envelopes of the foraminifers, Avliich a coating 
of organic matter seemed to protect. It seems probable that this elimi- 
nation of carbonate of lime is due to the action of carbonic acid dis- 
solved in the deep laj^ers of oceanic waters, where its chemical activity 
is reinforced by the enormous jiressure that reigns. The silica of the 
organisms resists the best, and it is thus that their skeletons, spicules, 
and other siliceous vestiges accumulate on the bottom. 

Everything seems to indicate that the formation of red clay is essen- 
tially due, like that of most of the other minerals which are to come 
under our notice, to the decomposition of the incoherent and very 
tenuous volcanic productions which abound on all the great ocean beds. 
In the regions where red clay shows its most distinct characteristics 
this transformation of the volcanic rocks into clayey matter may be 
followed through its successive phases. The clayey matter is the direct 
product of a chemical decomposition, si^ecially of the silicates, which 
are basic and in part represented by the pumice and the volcanic 
glasses. 

Ebelmeu,* so prematurely taken away from science, which he 
endowed with discoveries full of genius, was the first to show how 
the aluminous silicate rocks, principally tliose of eruptive origin, so 
frequent at the surface of the globe, are decomposed by the mere action 
of the atmosphere; their protoxides, such as lime and magnesia, are car- 
ried off iu a state of carbonate, while the alumina is concentrated with 
the silica, so as to form a hydrated silicate of the clay family. 

The same slow reactions seem to take place upon the ocean bottom at 
the expense of the volcanic silicates, aided perhaps by the chemical 
action of the sea water. Certain fusible muds contain, very probably, 
portions still undecoraposed, but in such fine dust that they may be 
confounded with the clay. It has been so with the muds that I have 
obtained by experiments upon the trituration of feldspar; they are so 
finely divided that they are soft as clay to the touch and possess the 
same plasticity. 

Zeolites. — Notwithstanding the very low temperature which prevails 
at the ocean bed, the <jhemical reactions seem to produce sharply-crys- 
talized minerals, the most remarkable of which, without doubt, belongs 
to the double hydrated silicates, known under the name of zeolites. 
These zeolites are met with in great abundance under the form of 
small isolated crystals^ simple or grouped geometrically, often in 
spherules of hardly a half millimeter in diameter, and in all cases con- 
fused with the clay. Crystallographic and chemical analyses show 
that they must belong to the species called chrisfianite or pMUppsite. 
This discovery was made in the center of the Pacific. It was repeated 

*See the article by Mr. Chevrenl \nt\\QJourrial des Savants, 1884, p. 104. 



DEEP-SEA DEPOSITS. 563 

in the Indian Ocean. It might have been thonght that these innu- 
merable crystals of christianite came from the simple <lisintegra- 
tion of volcanic rocks, with the paste of which they would have been 
associated; but the forainiiiifers brought up from the deeps by the 
dredge are completely enveloped with crystalline coverings of this 
mineral, which proves the fact iiot to be so. The formation of the 
zeolite is posterior to the deposit of tiie sediments engendered by the 
transformation of volcanic substances which cover the bed of the sea. 

Crlnuconiie. — Among the mineral deposits found on the sea bottoms 
is another hydrated silicate, known under the name of glauconite, which 
has for its bases aluminium, protoxide of iron, and other metals. Its 
mode of formation as well as the great extents on which it is found, 
specially call attention to it. It takes the form of small grains of a 
green color, and completely similar in form, dimension, and apijearance, 
to the particles of the same mineral which abound in various geological 
}»eri<)ds of the series of stratified rocks from the most ancient times to 
the most recent. Glauconite thus plays an important part in space as 
well as in time. The formation of this mineral in the great sea deeps, 
brought to notice forty years ago by Bailey and Pourtales, has been 
the object of many investigations, specially by Ehrenberg. 

Hydrated oxide of manganese {icad); hydrated oxide of iron {limonife). — 
Two other species to be mentioned, which submarine chemistry has pro- 
duced, and no doubt is still i>roducing, are the hydrated oxides of man- 
ganese and of iron, which are specially observed in nodules. These sub- 
stances are disseminated over the whole surface of the sea-bottom, but 
specially in the red clay area. It is easy to understand this association ; 
the volcanic rocks from which these clays are obtained containing 
abundance of iron and manganese in their mineral constituents, jjeri- 
dot, i)yroxen, and others. In consequence of their decomposition the 
oxides are liberated in conformity with the reactions so ably demon- 
strated by Ebelmen.* 

Among the organic and inorganic debris which in the red clay regions 
serve as center to the ferro-mauganiferous concretions, the remains 
of vertebrates have been frequently found. The bones thus found are 
the most enduring portions of the skeleton, such as the tympanic bones 
of the cetacea and the teeth of the shark. Just as we see the calcare- 
ous organisms eliminated at great depths, so also it is found that, 
except these massive portions, all bones of vertebrates are missing in 
the deep sediments. Some of these remains of vertebrates belong to 
extinct species. 

Phosphate of lime. — Off the cape of Good Hope, the dredge brought 
up from various depths of between 200 and 4,000 meters, quartzy and 
glauconitic muds, charged with the remains of various organisms, some 



* In .an appendix Mr. Gibson points out, by the aid of spectroscopic analysis, in tne 
manganese nodules, traces of various »deuients, barium, strontium, lithium, titanium, 
vanadium, and thallium.

of a calcareous nature, like tlie foramiuifers, others of a siliceous nature, 
like the spicuhe of sponges, the radiolaria, and the diatomacea. 

In these muds are found solid concretions from 1 to 4 centimeters in 
diameter and embedding all the organic and inorganic elements of the 
sediment. Chemical analysis has demonstrated that the cement of 
these concretions consists princi]>ally of phos])hate of lime. 

The sediments with the phosphatic nodules present the greatest 
resemblance to certain well-known strata belonging to various stages 
of certain series, especially of the cretaceous period, viz, the green 
sandstone, the glauconitic sandstone, the white chalk. The resem- 
blance, which is not only in the nodules, but also in the sediments 
which contain them, is such that there is evident similarity in their 
mode of formation. 

In regard to the origin of this phosphate of lime, the simplest idea 
and the one that everything confirms is that it is derived immediately 
from the decom])Osition of animal debris buried in the sediment after 
death. Their form is destroyed by the elfect of the reactions of the 
sea water upon them. 

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 

The expedition of the Challenger deserves the gi'atitude of science, 
not alone because it has shed light upon important facts in the province 
of physical geography, and because it has furnished many new ideas 
of the animal and vegetable life that people the abysses of the ocean. 
The nature of the bed of those abysses, vast areas whose depth exceeds 
4,000 meters and sometimes attain more than 8,000 meters, was, but a 
short time ago, hardly known to us. Deposits formed from the terra 
firma observable not far from continents do not continue in the abys- 
mal regions, where the motions of the sea, to which marginal deposits 
owe their origin, exert no influence. 

In those regions, mineral particles ui)on which the meclianical action 
of the water has left an imprint are not to be found, but instead vol- 
canic and pulverized matter, as well as clayey substances i)roduced by 
their chemical decomposition, the Avhole mixed with remains of micro- 
scopic organisms. Such are the deposits which cover the largest part 
of the sub-marine crust of the globe. 

We see for the first time the principal outlines of a geological map 
of the sea bottom, showing the manner in which the diflerent types of 
deposits are distributed upon the great ocean beds. This ma}) is 
annexed to the volume; it contains, in synoi)tic form and in convention- 
alized colors, the results of more than two thousand soundings made 
at depths greater than 2,000 meters.* 

Among other facts which appear from the map iu question, the first 
to attract the attention is how much the abyssal deposits exceed the 



* There were 1,600 of these soundings iu the Atlantic, 300 in the Indian Ocean, and 
400 iu the Pacific. 



DEEP-SEA DEPOSITS. 565 

margiual deposits in extent. The great predominance of red clay and 
globigerina-mnd ooze is noticed at first sight botli in the Atlantic and 
in the Pacific. In regard to the diatom ooze, it is seen to abound in 
the Antarctic Ocean beyond 50 degrees of latitude. 

The deposits in the abyssal regions are in complete contrast not only 
with the present deposits of seas less deep, but also in a marked way 
with those formed in the seas in ancient geological periods and which, 
laid down for a depth of thousands of meters, constitute the series of 
stratified rocks. 

In these ancient formations the sediments of abyssal nature seem to 
be lacking, or to be at least very rare. Hence the conclusion that the 
parts of the sea where sedimentary earths are successively formed are 
not, as to conditions of depth, comparable to those where the abyssal 
regions of the Atlantic and Pacific are found. They were not very far 
from the emerged portions or continents, and did not attain to very 
great depths. 

We are therefore led to the conclusion that from the most remote 
epochs the continental elevations have occupied very nearly the same 
parts of the globe. The prominences have been gradually modified by 
general ujjheavals, as has happened on a small scale, for example, in the 
formation of the Alpine chain. The great depressions then go back to 
a great antiquity and the general configuration of the terrestrial sphe- 
roid, with its vast and deei) depressions as we now know them, must have 
been outlined from the most ancient epochs of its history. 

This is the confirmation of an idea which has been previously reached 
from other considerations Agassiz formulated it in 1872, in discuss- 
ing the observations made by Pourtales upon the deeps of the Atlantic, 
and in remarking that no vestiges of stratified earth, either ancient or 
modern, were to be found there. 

Various facts lead us to think that the clay which covers the bottom 
of the oceanic basins was deposited with extreme slowness. The 
deposit seems not to have been thick and seems to go back, at least 
in certain parts, to very remote periods. This explains the relative 
abundance with which the cosmic dusts, as well as the more enduring 
of the cetaceous remains, are found there. The terrigenous deposits 
accumulate upon an entirely different scale of rapidity. 

^ow that we know the mode of formation of the deposits in the great 
deeps of the sea, and the chemical reactions producing the various 
species of minerals, new horizons are opened to us with regard to phe- 
nomena of which we formerly had no idea, and which nevertheless has 
for its stage more than half the solid crust of our planet. 

The examination of the beautiful work under our notice shows how 
numerous are the facts upon which the conclusions of the authors are 
based. It proves also the conscientious care which was bestowed upon 
the specimens procured which were examined by all themethods known 
to science. 



566 DEEP-SEA DEPOSITS. 

Let us do honor then to the men who organized tlie expedition of the 
Challenger^ to those men who carried it out with so much courage, 
energy, and skill, and let us render no less worthy homage to the two 
scientists Mr. John Murray and Mr. A. F. Renard, the important results 
of whose labors we have endeavored to set forth.

THE MIGRATIONS OF THE RACES OF MEN CONSIDERED 

HISTORICALLY.* 



Bv Prof. James Bryce. 



There are two senses in which we may claim for geograjihy that it is a 
meeting point of the sciences. > All the departments of research which 
deal with external nature touch one another in and through it — geology, 
botany, zoology, meteorology, as well as, though less directly, the various 
branches of physics. There is no one of these whose data are not, to a 
greater or less extent, also within the province of geography; none 
whose conclusions have not a material bearing on geographical prob- 
lems; and geography is also the point of contact between the sciences 
of Nature, taken all together, and the branches of inquiry which deal 
with man and his institutions. Ceography gathers up the results which 
tbe geologist, the botanist, the zoologist, and the meteorologist have 
obtained, and presents them to the student of history, of economics, of 
politics — we might, perhaps, add of law, of philology, and of architec- 
ture — as an imi)ortant part of the data from which he must start, and 
of the materials to which he will have to refer at many points in the 
progress of his researches. It is with this second point of contact, this 
aspect of geography as the basis for history, that we are to occupy our- 
selves to-night. Understanding that the Scottish Geographical Society 
desires not merely to present a current history of discovery, but to 
bring into prominence the economic, social, and political aspects of the 
science, and to inculcate its significance for those who devote them- 
selves to the presently urgent i)roblems which civilized man is called to 
deal with, I have chosen, as not unsuitable to an inaugural address, a 
subject which belongs almost eciually to physical and descriptive geog- 
raphy on the one side, to history and economics on the other. The 
movements of the races and tribes of mankind over the surface of our 
planet are in the first instance determined mainly by the pbysical con- 
ditions of its surface and its atmospbere, but tliey become themselves 
a part, and, indeed, a great part, of history; they create nations and 
build up states; they determine the extension of languages and laws;

tbey bring wealth to some regions and leave others neglected ; they mark 
out the routes of commerce and affect the economic relations of differ- 
ent countries. 

No line of historical inquiry sets before us more clearly at every stage 
the connection between man as an associative being — toiling, trading, 
warring, ruling, legislating — and that physical environment whose influ- 
ence over bis development is none the less potent and constant because 
he has learned in obeying it to rule it and to make it yield to him con- 
stantly increasing benefits. The topic is so large and branches off into 
so many other cognate inquiries that you will not expect me, within 
the narrow limits of an address, to do more than draw its outlines, 
enumerate the principal causes whose action it sets before us, touch 
upon the successive epochs which its history presents, and refer to a 
few out of the many problems its consideration raises. The migrations 
of peoples have been among the most potent factors in making the 
world of to-day different from the world of thirty centuries ago. If 
they continue th ey will be scarcely less potent in their influence on the 
future of the race; if they pass into new phases, those phases will be 
the expression of new conditions of society; if they cease, that cessa- 
tion will itself be a fjict of the highest economic and social significance. 

I. — FORMS OF DIFFUSION. 

At the outset it is convenient to distinguish the different forms which 
movements of population have taken. These forms may be grouped 
under three heads, which I propose to call by the names of Transfer- 
ence, Dispersion, and Permeation — names which need a few words of 
illustration. 

1. By Transference I mean that form of migration in which the whole, 
or a large majority, of a race or tribe quits its ancient seats in a 
body and moves into some other region. Such migrations seldom occur 
except in the case of nomad peoples who are little attached to any par- 
ticular piece of soil; but we may almost class among the nomads tribes 
who, like our own remote Teutonic ancestors, although they cultivate the 
soil, put no capital into it in the way of permanent improvements, and 
build no dwellings of brick or stone. The prehistoric migrations usu- 
ally belonged to this form, and so did that great series of movements 
which brought the northern races into the Roman Empire in the fifth 
and sixth centuries of our era. In modern times we find few instances 
of Transference, because such nomad races as remain are now shut up 
within narrow limits by the settled States that surround them, which 
have possessed, since the invention of gnni^owder and of standing 
armies, enormously superior defensive strength.* We should however 
have had an interesting case to point to had the Dutch, when pressed 
by the power of Philip 1 1, embraced the offer that came to them from 



* In 1771 a great Kalraiik horde inoveil en masse from the steppes of the Caspian

MIGRATIONS OF RACES OF MEN CONSIDERED HISTORICALLY. 569 

England to migrate in a body and establish themselves, their dairying, 
their flax culture, and their linen manufacture, in the rich pastures and 
humid air of Ireland. 

2. Under the head of migrations by Dispersion I include those cases 
in which a tribe or race, while retaining its ancient seats, overflows into 
new lands, whether vacant or already occupied ; in the latter event 
sometimes ejecting the original inhabitants, sometimes fusing with 
them, sometimes dwelling among them, but remaining distinct. 

Examples are furnished by the case of the Norsemen, who found Ice- 
land practically vacant, while in England they became easily, in Ire- 
land and Gaul more slowly, mingled with the previous inhabitants. 
When our own ancestors came from the Frisian coast they slew or drove 
out the bulk of the Celtic ijopulation of Eastern Britain ; when the 
Franks entered Gaul they became commingled with it. It is by such a 
process of disi)ersion that the British race has spread itself out ovei- 
North America and Australasia. In much smaller numbers the Span- 
iards diffused themselves over southern North America, and the north- 
ern and western parts of South America; and by a similar process the 
Eussians have for two centuries been very slowly filling the better parts 
of Siberia. Whether in any case of dispersion the migrating popula- 
tion becomes fused with that which it finds, depends chiefly on the dif- 
ference between the level of civilization of the two races. Between 
the English settlers in North America and the imtive Indians there 
has been hardly any mixture of blood; between the French in Canada 
and the Indians there was a little more; between the Spaniards and the 
less barbarous inhabitants of Mexico there has been so much that the 
present Mexican nation is a mixed one, the native blood doubtless i)re- 
dominating. Something however also depends on the relative num- 
bers of the two races; and sometimes religion keeps a- dispersed people 
from commingling with those among whom it dwells, as has hapiieued 
in the case of the Jews, the Armenians, and the Parsees. These last 
are a remarkable instance of an extremelj^ small nation — for there are 
not 80,000 of them all told — who, without any political organization, 
have, by virtue of their religion, preserved their identity for more than 
a thousand years. Dispersion has been the most widely operative form 
of migration in modern times which have enabled remote parts of our 
large world, separated by broad and stormy seas, to be colonized more 
easily than in the tiny world of ancient or medieval times was possible 
either by land or by sea. 

3. The third form, which we may call Permeation or Assimilation, 
is not in strictness a form of migration at all, because it may exist where 
the number of persons changing their dwelling-place is extremely small ; 
but it deserves to be reckoned with the other two forms because 
it produces effects closely resembling theirs in altering the char- 
acter of a population, I use the term Permeation to cover those 
instances, both numerous and important, in which one race or nation

SO spreads over another race or nation its language, its literature, 
its religion, its institutions, its customs, or some one or more of 
these sources of influence, as to impart its own character to the nation 
so influenced, and thus to substitute its own for the original type. In 
such a process the infusion of new blood from the stronger people to 
the weaker may be comparatively slight, yet, if sufficient time be 
allowed, the process may end by a virtual identification of the two. Of 
course, when there is much intermairiage, not only does the change 
proceed faster, but it tells on the permeating as well as on the perme- 
ated race. The earliest recorded instance of this diffusion of a civiliza- 
tion with little immixture of blood is to be found in the action of the 
Greek language, ideas, and manners upon the countries round the east- 
ern half of the Mediterranean, and i^articularly upon Asia Minor. 
The native languages, to some extent, held their ground for a while in 
the wilder parts of the interior, but the upper classes and the whole 
type of culture became everywhere Hellenic. In the same way the 
Eomans Romanized Gaul and Spain and the more fertile regions of 
North Africa. In the same way the Arabs, in the centuries immedi- 
ately after Mohammed, Arabized not only Egypt and Syria, but the 
whole of North Africa down to and including the maritime parts of 
Morocco, and ha^•e in later times, though to a far smaller extent, estab- 
lished the influence of their language and religion on the coasts of 
East Africa and in parts of the East Indian Archipelago. There is 
reason to believe, though our data are scanty, that in somewhat simi- 
lar way the Aryan tribes, who entered Iiulia at a very remote time, dif- 
fused their language, religion, and customs over northern Hindustan 
as far as the Bay of Bengal, changing to some extent the dark races 
whom they found in ])ossession of the country, but being also so com- 
mingled with those more numerous races as to lose much of their own 
character. Hinduism and languages derived from Sanskrit came to 
prevail from the Indus to the Brahmaputra, although it would seem 
that to the east of the Jumna the proportion of Aryan intruders was 
very small. We ourselves in India are giving to the educated and 
wealthier class so nmch that is English in the way of ideas arid litera- 
ture, that if the process continues for anotlier century, our tongue may 
have become the lingua frauMi of India, and our type of civilization 
have extinguished all others. Yet if this happens it will happen with 
no mixture of blood between the European and the native races, possi- 
bly with little social intimacy between them. The instances just men- 
tioned show in what different ways and varying degrees assimilation 
may take place. In some of them the assimilated race still retains a 
distinct national chnractei'. The Moor of Morocco, for instance, differs 
from the Arab mucli as the Greek-si)eaking Syrian and the Latin-speak- 
ing Lusitanian differed from a Greek of Attica or a Roman of Latium. 
But the Finnish tribes of northern and eastern Russia, Yoguls, Tcher^- 
niisses, Tchuvasses, and Mordvins, who have been gradually Russified

during" the last two centuries;, are ou their way to becoiue practically 
uudistinguisbable from the true Slavonic Russians of Kieif. And, to 
come nearer home, the Celts of Cornwall have been anglicized, and 
those of the Highlands of Scotland have in many districts become 
assimilated to the Lowland Scotch, with no great intermixture of blood. 
It iswortb wbile to be exact in distinguishing this process of Permea- 
tion from cases of Dispersion, because tlie two often go together — that 
is to say, the migration of a certain, though perhaps a small, number 
of persons of a vigorous and masterful race into a territory inhabited by 
another race of less force, or iierhaps on a lower level of culture, is apt 
to be followed by a predominance of the stronger type, or at any rate 
by such a change in the character of the whole population as leadsmen 
in later times to assume that the number of migrating persons must 
have been large. The cases of the Greeks in Western Asia and the 
Spaniards in the New World are in point. We talk of Asia IMinor as 
if it had become a Greek country under Alexander's successors, of 
Mexico and Peru as Spanish countries after the sixteenth century, yet 
in both instances the native population must have largely prei^onder- 
ated. If therefore, we were to look only at the changes which the 
speech, the customs, the ideas, and institutions of nations have under- 
gone, we might be disposed to attribute too much to the mere move- 
ment of races, too little to the influences which force of character, 
fertility of intellect, and command of scientific resource have exercised, 
and are still exercising, as the leading races become more and more the 
owners and rulers of the backward regions of the world. 

II. — CAUSES OP MIGKATION. 

We may now proceed to inquire what have been the main causes 
to which an outflow or an overflow of population from one region to 
another is due. Omitting, for the present, the cases of small colonies 
founded for special purposes, these causes may be reduced to three. 
They are food, war, and labor. These three correspond in a sort of a 
rough way to three stages in the progress of mankind, the first belong- 
ing especially to his savage and semi-civilized conditions, the second to 
that in which he organizes himselfin political communities, and uses his 
organization to prey upon or reduce to servitude his Aveaker neighbors; 
the third to that wherein industry and commerce have become the rul- 
ing factors in his society and wealth the main object of his efforts. The 
correspondence however is far from exact, because the need of subsist- 
ence remains through the combative and industrial periods a potent 
cause of migration, while the love of war and plunder, active even 
among savages, is by no means extinct in the mature civilization of 
to day. 

1. In speaking of food, or rather the want of food, as a cause, we must 
include several sets of cases. One is that in wliich slieer hunger, due 
perhaps to a drought or a hard winter, drives a tribe to move to some 



572 MIGRATIONS OF RACES OF MEN CONSIDERED HISTORICALLY. 

new region where the beasts of chase are more inimerous, or the pas- 
tures are not exhausted, or a more coi)ious rain-fall favors agriculture.* 
Another is that of a tribe increasing so fast that the pre-existing means 
of subsistence no longer suffice for its wants. Anda third is that where, 
whether or not famine be present to spur its action, a people conceives 
the desire for life in a richer soil or a more genial climate. To one or 
other of these cases we may refer nearly all the movements of popula- 
tions in primitive times, the best known of which are those which 
brought the Teutonic and Slavonic tribes into the Roman Empire. 
They had a hard life in northern and eastern Europe; their natural 
growth exceeded the resources which their pastoral or village area sup- 
plied, and when once one or two had begun to press upon their neigh- 
bors, the disturbance was felt by each in succession until some, pushed 
up against the very gates of theEmj)ire, found those gates undefended, 
entered the tempting countries thatlay towards the Mediterranean and 
the ocean, and drew others on to follow. Of modern instances the most 
remarkable is the stream of emigratiou which began to swell out of Ire- 
land after the great famine of 1846-'47, and which has not yet ceased 
to flow. 

Among civilized peoples the same force is felt in a slightly differ- 
ent form. As population increases the competition for the means of 
livelihood becomes more intense, while at thesametiuie the standard of 
comfort tends to rise. Hence, those on whom the pressure falls heav- 
iest (if they are not too shiftless to move), and those who have the 
keenest wish to better their condition, forsake their homes for lauds 
that lie under another situ. It is thus that theRussian peasantry have 
been steadily moving from the north to the south of European Russia, 
till they have now occupied the soil down to the very foot of the Cau- 
casus tor some 500 miles from the jjoint they had reached a century and 
a half ago. It is thus that, on a smaller scale, the (xreek-speaking pop- 
ulation of the west coast of Asia Minor is creeping eastward up the 
river valleys, and beginning to re-colonize the interior of that once pros- 
])erous region. It is thus that North America and Australasia have 
been tilled by the overflow of Europe during the last sixty years, for 
before that time thegrowthof the United Statesand of Canadahad been 
maiidy a home growth from the small seeds jilauted two hundred years 
earlier. That the mere spirit of enterprise, apart from the increase of 
l)opulation, counts for little as a cause of migration, seems to be shown 
not only by the slight outflow from Europe during last century, but by 
the fact that France, where the population is practically stationary, 
sends out no emigrants save a few to Algeria, while the steady move- 
meut from Norway and Sweden does little morethan relieve the natural 
growth of the population of those countries. As regards Euroi>ean 



* A succession of dry seasons, which may merely diminish the harvests of those 
who inhabit tolerably humid regions, will produce such a famine in the inner parts 
of a continent like Asia as to force the people to seek some better dwelling-place.

emigration to America, it is worth iiotiug- that diiriug the hist thirty 
years it has been steadily exteudiug", not only eastward toward the 
inland i)arts of Europe, but also downward in the scale of civilization, 
tapping, so to speak, lower and lower strata. Between 1840 and 1850 
the flow toward America was chiefly from the British Isles. From 1849 
onward, it began to be considerable from Germany also, and very 
shortly afterward from Scandinavia, reaching a figure of hundreds of 
thousands from the European continent in each year. From Germany 
the migratory tendency spread into Bohemia, Moravia, Poland, and the 
other Slavonic regions of the. Austro-Hungariau monarchy, as well as 
into Italy. To-day the people of the United States, who had welcomed 
industrious Germans and hardy Scandinavians because both made good 
citizens, become daily more restive under the ignorant and semi-civil- 
ized masses whom Central Europe flings upon their shores. At the 
other end of the world, the vast emigration from China is partly attrib- 
utable to the need ot food; but to this I shall recur ijresently when wt 
come to speak of labor. 

2. The second of our causes is war. In early times, or among the ruae 
peoples, it is rather to be called plunder, for most of their wars were 
undertaken less for permanent conquest than for booty. The invasions 
of Britain by the English, of Gaul by the Franks, of P^ngland and Scot- 
land by the Norsemen and Danes, all began with mere piratical or raid- 
ing expeditious, though ending in considerable transfers of population. 
The same may be said of the conquest of Pegu and Arakan by the Bur- 
mese in the last century, and (to a smaller extent) of that southward 
movement of the wild Chin and Kachin tribes whom our j)resent rulers 
of Burmah find so troublesome. It was in war raids that the movement 
of the Bantu races to the southernmost parts of South Africa, where they 
have so largely displaced the yellowish Hottentot race, seems to have 
begun. So the conquests of Egypt and Persia by the first successors 
of the Prophet, so the conquests of Mexico and Peru by the Spaniards, 
though tinged with religious propagandism, were primarily expeditions 
in search of plunder. This character, indeed, belongs all through to 
the Spanish migrations to the JSTew World. Apparently few people went 
from Spain meaning, like our colonists a century later, to make a living 
by their own labor from the soil or from commerce, which, indeed, the 
climate of Central and South America would have rendered a more dif- 
ficult task. They went to enrich themselves by robbing the natives or 
by getting the precious metals from the toil of natives in the mines, a 
form of commercial enteriirise whose methods made it scarcely distin- 
guishable from rapine. In modern times the discovery of the precious 
metals has he]])ed to swell the stream of immigration, as when gold 
was discovered in California in 1846 and in Australia a little later; but 
in these instances, though enrichment is the object, rapine is no longer 
the means. There are, however, other senses in which we may call war 
a source of movements of races. It was military policy which planted 
the Saxons in Transylvania and the French in Lower Canada, and the 



674 MIGRATIONS OF RACES OF MEN CONSIDERED HISTORICALLY. 

Scotch and English settlers in the lower and more fertile parts of Ulster; 
it is military policy which has settled Kussian colonies, sometimes armed, 
sometimes of agricultural dissenters, along- theTraus-caucasiau frontiers 
and on the farther shore of the Caspian. It was military policy which 
led Shalmaneser and Nebuchadnezzar to carry off large parts of the 
people of Israel and Judah to settle them in the cities of the Medes or 
by the waters of Babylon.* 

As regards the more regular conquests made by civilized states in 
modern times, such as those of Finland, Poland, Transcaucasia, and 
Transcaspia by Kussia, of Bosnia and Herzegovinaby Austria, of India 
and Cape Colony by Great Britain, of Cochin China and Annam by 
France, it may be said that they seldom result in any considerable trans- 
fer of population. Such effects as they have are rather due to that 
process of Permeation which we have already considered, 

3. Labor ( /. f ., the need for labor) becomes a i)otent cause of migrations 
in this way — that the necessity for having in particular paits of the 
world men wiio can undertake a given kind of toil untter given climatic 
conditions draws such men to those countries from their previous dwell- 
ing place. This setof cases differs from the cases of migrationsin search 
of subsistence, because the migrating population may have been tolera- 
bly well off at home. As the food migrations have been described as an 
outflow from countries overstocked with inhabitants, so in these cases 
of labor migration what we remark is the inflow of masses of men to All 
a vacuum — that is, to su])ply the absence in the country to which they 
move of the sort of workpeople it reijuires. However, it often happens 
that the two phenomena coincide, the vacuum in one country helping 
to determine the direction of the influx from those other countries whose 
population is already supeiabuiulant. This has happened in the case 
of the most remarkable of such recent overflows, that of the Chinese 
overthe coasts and islands of the Pacific. Theneed of Western America 
for cheap labor to make railways and to cultivate large areas just 
brought under tillage, as well as to supply domestic service, drew the 
Chinese to California and Oregon, and but for the stringent prohibitions 
of recent legislation would have brought many thousands of them into 
the Mississippi Valley. Similar conditions were drawing them in great 
numbers to Australia, and especially to North Queensland, whose cli- 
mate is too hot for whites to work in the fields; but here, also, the influx 
has been stopped by law. Ten or twelve years ago they were beginning 
to form so considerable a proportion of the population of the Hawaiian 
Isles that public opinion there compelled the sugar-planters to cease 
imx)orting tliem, and, in order to balance them, Portuguese labor was 
brought from the Azores, and Japanese from Japan. Into Siam and 
the Malay Peninsula, and over the Eastern Archipelago, Chinese migra- 

* So the Siamese, after their conquest of Tenasserini, carried off many of the Talain 
population and settled them near Bangkok, where they remain as a distinct popula- 
tion to this day. 



MIGRATIONS OF RACES OF MEN CONSIDERED HISTORICALLY. 575 

tioii goes on steadily; and it seems not inn)r()bable that in time this 
element may be the prevailing one in the wliole of the Iiido-China and 
the adjoining islands, for the Chinese are not only a more prolific but 
altogether a stronger and hardier stock than either their relatives the 
Shans, Burmese, and Annamese, or their less immediate neighbors the 
Malays. If in the distant future there comes to be a time in which 
the weaker races having been trodden down or absorbed by the more 
vigorous, few are left to strive for the mastery of the world, the Chinese 
will be one of those few. None has a greater tenacity of life. 

Xot unlike these Chinese migrations, but on a smaller scale, is that 
of Sauthals to Assam, and of South Indian coolies to Ceylon (where the 
native population was comparatively indolent), and latterly to the isles 
and coasts of the Carribbean Sea. Here there has been a deliberate 
importation of laborers by those who needed their labor; and, although 
the laborers have intended to return home after a few years' service, 
and are indeed under British regulations, supplied with return passage 
tickets, permanent settlements are likely to result, for the planters of 
Guiana, for instance, have little prospect of supjilying themselves in 
any other way with the means of working their estates. The coolies 
would doubtless be brought to tropical Australia also, but for the dis- 
like of the colonists to the regul ations insisted on by the Indian Govern- 
ment; so instead of them we see that importation of Pacific islandersinto 
North Queensland which is now a matter of so much controversy. Under 
very different conditions we find the more spontaneous immigration of 
French Canadians into the northern United States, where they obtain 
employment in the factories, and are now becoming permanently resi- 
dent. At first they came only to work till they had earned something 
wherewith to live better at home; but it constantly happens that such 
temporary migration is the prelude to permanent occupation. So the 
Irish reapers used to come to England and Scotland before the migra- 
tion from Ireland to the English and Scottish towns swelled to great pro- 
portions in 1847. The Italians who now go to the Argentine Kepnblic 
less frequently return than did their predecessors of twenty years ago. 

In all these instances the transfer of jwpulation due to a demand for 
labor has been, or at least has purported to be, a voluntary transfer. 
But by far the largest of all such transfers, nowhappily atauend, was 
involuntary — I mean that of Africans carried to America to cultivate 
the soil there for the benefit of white proprietors.* From early in the 



* I do not dwell on the slave trade in ancient times, because wo have no trust- 
worthy data as to its extent; but there can be no doubt that vast numbers of bar- 
barians from the west, north, and east of Italy and Greece were brought in during 
tive or six centuries, and they must have sensibly changed the character of the 
])opulation of the countries round the Adriatic and ^gean. Here of course there 
was no question of climate, but slaves were caught because their captors did not 
wish to work themselves. The slave trade practiced by the merchants of Bristol 
before the Norman Conquest and that practiced by the Turkoman, recently, resem- 
ble these ancient forms of the practice. 



576 MIGRATIONS OF RACES OF MEN CONSIDERED HISTORICALLY. 

sixteenth ceutiiiy, when the (lestiuctiou oF the native Indians by their 
Spanish taskmasters in the Antilles started the slave trade,* down to 
our own times, when slavers still occasionally landed their cargoes in 
Brazil, th*^ number of negroes carried from Africa to America must be 
reckoned by many millions. In 179J it was estimated tliat 60,000 were 
carried annually to the West Indies alone. The change effected may 
be measured by the fact that along the southern coasts of North 
America, in the West India islands, and in some districts of Brazil 
the negroes form the largest part of the population. Their total num- 
ber, which in the United States alone exceeds 7,000,000, can not be less 
than from 13,000,000 to 1(),000,000. They increase rapidly in South 
Carolina and the (xulf States of the Union, are stationary in Mexico 
and Peru, aud in Central America seem to diminish. Though some 
have suggested their re-migration to Africa, there is not the slightest 
reason to think that this will take place to any ap])reciable extent. On 
the other hand, it is not likely that they will, ex(;ept, perhaps, in the 
unsettled tropical interior of the less elevated i^arts of South America, 
spread beyond the area which they now occupy. The slave trade is 
unfortunately not yet extinct on the east coast of Africa, but it has 
caused so comparatively slight a transfer of population from that con- 
tinent to Arabia, the Turkish dominions, and Persia as not to require 
discussion here. 

Before quitting this part of the subject a passing reference may be 
made to two other causes of migration, which, though their effects 
have been com]iaratively small, are not without interest — religion and 
the love of freedom. Religion has operated in two ways. Sometimes 
it has led to the removal of persons of a particular faith, as in the case 
of the expulsion of the Jews from Spain by Ferdinand and Isabella, 
the Catholic, an event which affected not only Spain l)ut Europe gen- 
erally, by sending many caj)able Spanish Jews to Holland and others 
to the Turkish East. Similar motives led Philip III to expel the Moris- 
coes in A. D. 1G09. The present Jewish emigration from Russia is also 
partially, though only partially, traceable to this cause. In another 
class of cases religion has been one of the motive forces in promi)ting 
war and concpiest, as when the Arabs overthrew the dominions of the 
Sassanid kings, overran the eastern part of the East Roman Empire, 
subjugated North Africa and S])ain; and also in the case of the Spanish 
conquests in America, where the missionary spirit went hand in hand 
with, andAvas not felt to be incompatible with, the greed of gold and 
the harshest means of satisfying it. The latest American instance 



* The first negroes were brouglit from Morocco to Portugal iu 1442, soon after 
which they began to be brought iu large numbers from the Guinea coasts. There 
were already some in Hispauiola in 1502; and after 1517 the trade from Africa seems 
to have set in regularly, though it did not become large till a still later date. Las 
Casas lived to bitterly repent the qualified approval he had given to it, in the 
interests of the aborigines of the Antilles, whom labor in the mines was swiftly 
destroying; but it is a complete error to ascribe its origin to him.

may be t'ound in tbe occupation and goveniiiient of Paraguay by the 
Jesuits. Finally, we sometimes tind religious feeling' tbe cause of 
peaceful emigrations. The case which has proved of most historical 
significance is that of the Puritan settlement in Massachusetts and 
Connecticut; among those of less note may be reckoned the flight of 
the Persian fire worshippers to Western India; the Huguenot set- 
tlements in Brazil and on tlie southeastern coast of North America, 
destroyed soon after their foundation by the Portuguese and Spaniards, 
and tlie later flight of the French Protestants after the revocation of 
the edict of Nantes; the emigration of the Ulster Presbyterians to the 
United States in last century; the foundation of various German 
colonies at Tiflis and other places in the Russian dominions.* Nor 
ought we to forget one striking instance of expatriation for tlie sake 
of freedom — that of the petty chieftains of Western Norway, who set- 
tled Iceland in the ninth century to escape the growing power of King 
Harold the Fairhaired. 

in. — CHANNELS OF MIGRATION. 

From this political side of our subject we return to its physical 
aspects iu considering the lines which m'gration has tended to follow. 
These have usually been the lines of least resistance, L e., those in 
which the fewest natural obstacles in the way of mountains, deserts, 
seas, and dense forests have had to be encountered. The march of 
warlike tribes in early times and the movements of groups of emi- 
grants by land in modern times have generally been along river valleys 
and across the lowest and easiest passes in mountain ranges. The 
valley of the lower Danube has for this reason, from the fourth century 
to the tenth, an immense historical importance, for it was ah)ng its 
levels that the Huns, Avars, and Magyars, besides several of the 
Slavonic tribes, moved in to occupy the countries between the Adriatic 
and the Theiss. While the impassable barrier of the Himalaya has at 
all times prevented any movements of population from Tibet and 
Eastern Turkistan, the passes to the west of the Indus, and especially 
the Khaiber and the Bolan, have given access to many invading or 
immigrating masses, from the days of the primitive Aryans to those 
of Ahmed Shah Durani in last century. So in Europe, the Alpine 
passes have had much to do with directing the course of streams of 
invaders to Italy. So in North America, while the northern line of 
settlement was indicated by the valley of St. Lawrence and the Great 
Lakes, the chief among the more southerly lines was that from Vir- 
ginia into Tennessee and Kentucky over the Cumberland Gap, long 
the only practicable route across the middle Alleghanies. 



*The Tiflis Germans left Wiirtemberg iu order to avoid the use of an obnoxious

Russian army.

578 MIGRATIONS OF EACES OF MEN CONSIDERED HISTORICALLY. 

Of migrations by sea it has already been remarked that owiug to 
improvements in navigation, they have now become practically inde- 
pendent of distance or any other obstacle. In earlier times also they 
played a considerable part, but only in the case of sucli seafaring peoples 
as the Phenicians, the Irreeks, and the Northmen, — instances in which 
the number of persons transferred nnist have been comparatively small, 
though the historical results were profound. Those which most nearly 
approach the character of national movements were the transfer of a 
vigorous Phenician shoot to Carthage, of a mass of Greeks to South 
Italy and Sicily, and of the Jute>, Saxons, and Angles to Britain. 

The most important physical factor in determining lines of movement 
has, however, been climate. Speaking broadly, migration follows the 
parallels of latitude, or more precisely, the lines of equal Jiiean tem- 
perature, and not so much, 1 think, of mean annual heat as of mean 
winter heat. Although the inhabitants of cold climates often evince a 
desire to move into warmer ones, they seem never to transfer themselves 
directly to one differing greatly from that to which they are accustomed ; 
while no people of the tropics has ever, so far as I know, settled in any 
part of the temperate zone. There is one instance of a north European 
race establishing itself on the southern shores of the Mediterranean — 
the Vandals in North Africa; and the Bulgarians came to the banks 
of the lower Danube from the still sterner winters of the middle Volga. 
But in the few cases of northward movement, as in that of the Lapps, 
the cause lies in the irresistible pressure of stronger neighbors; and 
probably a similar pressure drove the Fuegians into their inhospitable 
isle. 

The tendency to retain similar climatic conditions is illustrated by 
the colonization of North America. The Spaniards and Portuguese 
took the tropical and sub-tropical regions, neglecting the cooler parts. 
The French and the English settled in the temperate zone; and it was 
not till this century that the country toward the Gulf of Mexico began 
to be occupied by incomers from the Carolinas and northern Georgia. 
When the Scandinavian immigration began, it Howed to the northwest, 
and has filled the States of Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Dakota. And 
when the Icelanders sought homes in the New World, they chose the 
northernmost place they could find by the shores of Lake Winnipeg, 
in Manitoba. So the internal movements of population within the 
United States have been along theparallels of latitude. The men of 
New England have gone west into New York, Ohio, and Michigan, 
whence their children have gone still farther west to Illinois, Iowa, 
Oregon, and Washington. Similarly the overflow of Virginia poured 
into Kentucky and Tennessee, and thence into southern Illinois and 
Missouri; while it is chiefly from the Carolinas that Georgia, Alabama, 
Mississippi. Arkansas, and Texas have been settled. The present negro 
emigration fro)n the eastern States of the South is into Arkansas and 
Texas. Oregon is the only Northern State that has received any con-

siderable number of iininigraiits from the old slave States; and western 
Oregon enjoys, in respect of its maritime position, an equable climate, 
with winters milder than those of Missouri. 

lY. — THE LARGER SERIES OF MIGRATIONS. 

Without attempting- to present a chronological view of the prin- 
cipal migrations by which the population of the world has been shifted, 
I will attempt to indicate very briefly the main epochs at which these 
have been most frequent or most important. They may be classed in 
five groups, corresponding- to five i>eriods in the history of those parts 
of the world of which we possess a history. The first epoch covers pre- 
historic times, times known' to us only by faint traditions and by the 
results of philological and archicological inquiry. We are able to say 
that certain movements of races did take place before the date of our 
earliest written records, but unable to fix these movements to any point 
of time. Thus there is reason to believe that the Celtic races advanced 
from east to west, partly forcing- into corners, partly fusing- with, that 
earlier population of Gaul and Britain which is usually called Iberian, 
and of which the Basques are supposed to be representatives. Thus 
the Etruscans descended from the Alps into middle Italy, as the ances- 
tors of the Latins and Sabellians would appear to have done at an 
earlier date. It seems probable that the Slavs and Letts came to the 
Oder and the Vistula from the southeast. Recent philological research 
lends weight to the view that the Phrygians and the Armenians, bath 
races of the Indo-European fiimily, were originally settled in south- 
eastern Europe, and crossed the Bosphorus into the seats where authen- 
tic history finds them. At some remote but quite undetermined time 
Aryan invaders entered northwestern India, and slowly spread to the 
south and east from the Punjab; while, at a still earlier epoch, another 
race coming- from the west passed througli Beluchistan (where it has 
left a trace of its passage in the langtiage spoken by the Brahuis) and 
moved southeastward into the Dekkan and southern India, in which 
its four great allied tongues, those we call Dravidian,* are now spoken 
by nearly 30,000,000 people. ISTor have we any materials for ascertain- 
ing- the time at which the Polynesian Islands were occupied by the two 
races, the brown and the black or negroid, which now inhabit them, 
and both of which seem to have come from the East Indian Archipelag-o, 
passing- from isle to isle in their canoes against the trade winds that 
blow from the American coast. Finally, it is to prehistoric and prob- 
ably to very remote times that belongs the settlement of the two 
American continents by immigrants from Asia, immigrants who appear 
to have crossed Bering Straits, or made their way along the line of the 
Aleutian Isles,t and thence to have slowly drifted southward from 

^TaiTiil, Tehigii, Canarese, and INIalayalam. 

ISoiiiu recent writers wonld refer the entrance of the present American races into 
their continent to a period so remote as that in which Asia was joined by dry laud 
to America.

Alaska to Tieria del Fuego. That the process of settling- these vast 
areas must have taken an enormous space of time is i^roved, not only 
by the archaeological evidence drawn from human bones and other relics 
of primitive man, but also by the great differences, both physical and 
linguistic, between the various American races — dift'erences, however, 
whicli are nowise iucomi)atible with the doctrine of a common Asiatic 
origin. 

The first migrations of which we have distinct historical evidence, 
besides those of the Phenicians and Israelites, are the movement of 
the Dorians into Peloponnesus and of the ^^^olians and louians to the 
west coast of Asia Minor. Somewhat later, in the seventh century, 
B. c, collisions seemed to have occurred among the nomad tribes to the 
north of the Black and Caspian seas, which led to the irruption of a 
people called Cimmerians, who advanced as far as Ephesus, and part 
of whom seem to have i)eruuinently settled on the south coast of the 
Euxine, and of a host of Scythians who ravaged Western Asia for 
many years, and were bought off by Kiug Psammetichus on the fron- 
tiers of Egypt. Whether any permanent settlements followed these 
irruptions does not appear, but they are interesting as the first of the 
many instances in which the roving people of the steppe have descended 
on the settled States to the south, carrying slaughter and rapine in 
their train. 

Passing over such minor disturbances of i)opulation as the Celtic 
occupation of North Italy and of that part of Asia Minor which from 
them took the name of (ralatia, and i)assing over also the premature 
descent of the Cimbri and the Teutones into the Poman world in the days 
of Marius, who slaughtered them at Aix (in Provence) and Vercelli, Ave 
arrive at the third great epoch of movement — that which the Germans 
call ])ar excellence the wandering of the peoples (VOlkerwanderung). 
The usual account describes this movement to have begun from the 
nomads of Mongolia, living near the Great Wall of China, one trii)e 
aggressing on or pro])elling another, until those who dwelt westward 
near the Caspian precipitated themselves on the (Joths, then occui)y- 
ing the plains of the Dnieper and Dniester, and drove them across the 
Danube into the Roman Empire. Whether this was the originating 
cause, or whether it is rather to be sought in a lack of food and the 
natural increase of the tribes between the Baltic and the Euxine, there 
certainly did begin with the crossing of the Danube by the (Joths, in 
A. D. 377, an era of unrest and displacement among all the peoples 
from the Caspian to the Atlantic, which did not end till the destruction 
of the Scandinavian power in Ireland at Clontarf, in 1014, and the 
rolling back of the great Norwegian invasion of I'higland, at Stamford 
Bridge, in lOGG. The Goths, the Vandals, Suabians, Burgundians, 
Franks, Saxons, Lombards settled in various provinces of the Pomau 
Em])ire and founded great kingdoms. Elinor tribes, such as the Alans, 
Rugians, and Herulians, moved hither and thither, without effecting 



MIGRATIONS OF RACES OF MEN CONSIDERED HISTORICALLY. 581 

any distinct and jx'rnianent settlement. A vast nniltitnde of Huns 
ranged across Central Europe, carrying- destrnction as far as the Seine. 
^'arious Slavonic tribes occiii)ied the countries along the Danube and 
the east coast of the Adriatic; they even tilled the isles lying- off the 
Dalmatian coast (where only Slavonic is now spoken), and descended 
into (h'eece, in the modern population of wliich they form a large ele- 
ment. Tlie Bulgarians, a Finnish people from the Volga, settled among 
the Danubian Slavs and adopted their language, while the Avars, 
penetrating farther west, held the great Hungarian plain for two cen- 
turies. Last of all, at the end of the ninth century, came the Magyars, 
another Finnish tribe, who retained tlieir old language and have played 
a brilliant part in history. A century before they entered Hungary, 
the Norsemen and Danes had begun those piratical expeditions which 
ultimately turned into migrations, largely changing the i)0])ulation of 
eastern Britain and of northern France. At one moment the North- 
men of Iceland seemed on the point of spreading from their settlement 
on the coast of Bast Greenland into North America, where they made 
descents at points the most southern of which have been plausibly 
conjectured to lie in Massachusetts or Long Island. These expeditions 
met with so much resistance from the natives that the idea of perma- 
nent settlement, apparently for a time entertained, was abandoned. 
The Norsemen had not, lilce the Spaniards five centuries later, and the 
I^vnglish of the seventeenth century, the advantage of firearms, and 
tliey came from a very small nation, which could not afford to waste 
its men; so this case has to be added to that list of attempted coloniza- 
tions which might, like the settlement of the Phocteans in Corsica and 
the Huguenots in Brazil, have changed the course of liistory had tliey 
but prospered. These seven centuries of unrest left no i)opulatioii in 
Europe unchanged, and gave birth not only to the states and nations 
of the middle ages and the modern world, but to modern civilization as 
a whole, creating new tongues and new types of culture from the mix- 
ture of the intruding races with the provincial subjects of Rome. 

The tburth grou]> of migrations overlaps in time that wliich we have 
Jnst been considering, and in three countries overlaps it also in space — 
viz, in North Africa, in Spain, and in tlie Thraco-Danubian lands. 
But its origin was wholly distinct and its character different. It begins 
with the outbreak of the Arabs from their remote peninsula imme- 
diately after the death of Mohannned — we may date it from the first 
defeats of the Romans in Syria in A. D. 632, and of the Persian in A. D. 
(hio — and it did not quite end till the cession of Podolia to the Turks, 
ten centuries later, in A. D. 1()9.5. It changed the face of Western and 
Southern Asia, as the Volkerwanderung changed that of Europe, yet 
it involved far less transfer of population, and worked more by way of 
})ermeative conquest than of migration pro])er. The Arabs spread 
over Irak, Egypt, Syria, North Africa, Sicily, and the Iberian penin- 
sula; twice they laid their grasp on the southeastern corners of Gaul. 



582 MIGRATIONS OF RACES OF MEN CONSIDERED HISTORICALLY. 

Tlieir new religion gave au Arab tinge to tlie literature and habits of 
Persia and Western Turkistan; its influence is strong to-day in the 
East Indian Archipelago and on the coasts of East Africa, as well as 
in the vast inland region from Timbuctoo to Somali Laud, After their 
conquering force had fully spent itself, the initiative passed to the 
Turks, and an infusion of Turkoman blood and Musselman ideas helped 
to transmute the former subjects of the East Roman Empire in Asia 
and Europe into the so-called Ottomans of to-day. The wave has for 
two centuries been visibly receding. Since 1878 we have seen the 
Mohamuiedan Beys retiring fi'om Bosnia as they retired thirty years 
ago from Servia; the Circassians, and still more recently, some of the 
tribes of Daghestan, have gone forth from their mountain homes; the 
Pomaks are beginning to leave Bulgaria; it is probable that in forty 
years more hardly a Musselman Avill be left on European soil, unless 
the jealousies of Euroi»ean powers should still keep the barbarian 
enthroned in Constantinople. Not less remarkable than the movement 
of the Arabs to the Oxus and the Tagus, and of the Turk from the 
Oxus to the Adriatic, was the movement of the races from beyond the 
Indus and the Hindu Kiish into India. The irruptions which begin 
with the expedition of Mahmud of (xhazni in the eleventh century 
brought some of the mixed Central Asiatic races, who passed as 
JMoguls, and a probably greater number of Pathans (Afghans) into 
Upper India, in parts of which they sensibly affected the character of 
the iwpulation. Here too, more was done in the way of assimilative 
influence than by an infusion of blood, for the Musselman bands car- 
ried their religion to the shores of the Bay of Bengal and far into the 
Dekkan; they introduced a new and splendid style of building and au 
exquisite richness of decoration; their deeds were recorded by the tirst 
regular chroniclers of India. In a fourth region, that of the countries 
north of the Black Sea, the irruptions of Zinghis Khan and his sons 
brought about some permanent changes. But it is doubtful hoAV far 
the presence of such Tartar and Mongolic tribes as still remain in the 
Crimea and along the Volgo is due to those invasions; and since, 
whatever their consequences may have been, they are not due to Islam, 
for the Mongols were lieathen, they do not fall within the group of 
migrations we are now considering. 

The fifth group begins with the discovery of America in 1492, if we 
ought not rather to date it from the first long voyages of the Portu- 
guese, opening with the passage of Cape Bojador in 1435 (under an 
Euglish captain) aud culminating in the rounding of the Cape of Good 
Hope and opening of the sea route to India, by Bartholomew Diaz in 
USf), followed by Vasco de Gama's voyage to Malabar twelve years 
later. 

Four great eras of settlements belong to this group. The first is 
that of the Spaniards and Portuguese in tropical America; the sec- 
ond is that which brings the negroes from Africa to America; the 



MIGRATIONS OF RACES OF MEN CONSIDERED HISTORICALLY. 583 

third is the colonization of tlie temperate parts of the North American 
coast by the English, French, ami Dntch in the seventeenth century; 
the fourth is the immense outtlow from Kurope, not only to America 
but also to Australasia, and — in a much smaller degree — to South Africa, 
auovertlowmainlydueto the progress of physical science; firstly, in intro- 
ducing the use of steam for ocean voyages, and, secondly, in so acceler- 
ating the growth of population iu Europe that the impulse toward less 
crowded lands became stronger than ever before. The scale of this 
outtlow of the last seventy years has been far larger than that of any 
previous time, and has indeed become possible only because ocean 
transit is now so swift, safe, and cheap. The export of Chinese to 
America, and of Indian coolies to and fro in the tropics, is in like man- 
ner attributable to the cheapness with which they can now be carried 
for long distances, as well as (in the case of the coolies) to the increased 
demand for tropical products which the growth of population and of 
wealth iu the north temperate zone has created. 

v. — THE CORRELATIONS OF MIGRATION. 

Among the many questions suggested by the facts we have noted, 
I will advert to two or three only. 

One of these bears on the analogy between the migrations of man- 
kind and those of other animals and of plants. If the majority of our 
geologists are right iu holding that man existed in those very remote 
times in which great changes of climate were still taking place, the 
analogy must then have been close. Races of men may, in paheolithic 
times, have moved northward or southward, according to the recession 
or advance of the great ice sheet that once covered the northern part 
of the north temperate zone, just as we know that animals moved, and 
just as we find that certain species of i)lants have, iu our latitude, 
sometimes occupied the low country, 'and sometimes retired to sub- 
arctic regions or ascended to the tops of the loftiest mountains. It 
has been lately maintained that the Eskimo of Arctic America are 
the descendants of the Cave men of Britain and France, driven north 
many thousands of years ago by the growing mildness of the climate. 
We know that changes in the level of the sea have produced revolu- 
tions in the fauiia and flora of countries, not only by affecting the 
course of ocean currents, and tliereby the climate, but also by bringing^ 
when lands formerly separated l)ecame parts of the same continent, 
species from one land to another, where the incomers overpowered or 
expelled the old inhabitants, or became, under new conditions and 
through the struggle between competing species, themselves so modi- 
fied as to pass into new forms. If man existed at a time so distant as 
that wherein Bering Straits and the North Sea and i^art of the Medi- 
terranean were dry land, we may conjecture, from the influence of these 
physical changes upon the animal and vegetable world, what their 



584 MIGRATIONS OF RACES OF MEN CONSIDERED HISTORICALLY. 

influence may have been upou him in causing tribes to move from place 
to place, and in bringing about alterations of racial types. 

The geological record supplies ample evidence how greatly the si)ecies 
of animals and plants have transferred themselves from one dwelling 
place to another in distant ages. The horse, in his earlier forms, was 
abundant in America, but he vanished there, and had been long extinct 
when the Spaniards of Oortez won JNIexico by the terror he inspired. 
The camel, it appears, was originally a New World beast, and the 
gigantic ^eg((ow<, of California, a European tree. But it is seldom that 
we are able to fix the causes which have brought about these transfer- 
ences. And even with regard to those Citmparativelj' few migrations of 
animals which haveoccurred within recent times it is seldom that any pal- 
pably operative ground canbeassigued. The latest instance of any con- 
siderable migration, apart, of course, from theagency of man, is theinva- 
sion of Europe by the brown rat, a native, it seems, of East Central 
Asia, which has practically expelled the black rat from Europe, just as 
the latter has been ejecting weaker rodents from South America. 

In prehistoric times the movements of animals must have frequently 
told upon man. It appears that some centuries before our colonists 
entered North America the bufialo had begun to move eastward from 
the i)rairie highlands in and near the R')cky Mountains toward the 
Mississippi ; and in order to tempt him still farther eastward the Indians 
began to burn the forests which covered its banks and those of the 
Ohio River in what are now the States of Illinois, Indiami, and Ken- 
tucky. The abundance of animal food thus brought within their reach 
seems to have checked the progress of the tribes in the arts of seden- 
tary life, throwing them back into the stage of hunters. 

Since man, in his advancing civilization, has begun to domesticate 
animals and to understand how to improve the soil and make full use of 
Its capacities, the chief transfers of animals and plants to new regions 
have been due to his action. He has peopled the New World and 
Australasia with the horses, cattle, and sheep of Ihirope, turning to 
account tracts which might otherwise have remained a wilderness. The 
trees he has brought from distant regions have sometimes grown to for- 
ests and changed the aspect of whole countries. Thus, the toi)S of the 
Neilgherry hills in Southern India have nearly lost their beautiful 
ancient woods, and are now, since the English took them in hand, cov- 
ered with the somber Eucalyptus and Acacia mclanoxyloti from Austra- 
lia, or with plantations of tea from China, or of quinine from Paraguay. 
The landscape of Egypt, as we see it, must be quite different from that 
which Moses or Herodotus saw; for most of the trees belong to si)ecies 
which were then unknown on the Nile. JMany creatures and many 
plants have also followed man without his will. The rats which our 
ships carry, and the mosquitae-; whose eggs lurk in the water barrels, 
hnd their way to land and plague new countries; the English sparrow 
is now a nuisance in North America, though less pernicious than the 



MIGRATIONS OF RACES OF MEN CONSIDERED HISTORICALLY. 585 

Englisli rabbit iu Australia. Species of shrubs and herbaceous plants, 
the seeds of most of them brought accidentally from America or Asia, 
have thrice overrun the Hawaiian Islands, so that the present vegeta- 
tion of the group is largely different from that which Cook found little 
more than a century ago. Thus the migrations of men, which nature 
once governed, have now come to be followed by those of other crea- 
tures, and are the vsource of many a change u})on the face of nature 
herself. 

VI. — INFLUENCES RESULTINCf FROM MIGRATION. 

If we ask what has been tlie result of the changes we have been 
considering on the political organizations of mankind, and on the types 
of human culture, the answer must unquestionably be that they have 
become fewer and fewer. From the beginning of authentic history the 
j)rocess of reducing the number of tribes, of languages, of independent 
political communities, of forms of barbarism or of civilization, has gone 
on steadily, ami indeed Mith growing speed. For many parts of the 
world our data do not go far back. But if we take the part for which 
the data are most complete, the basin of the Mediterranean, we find 
that now there are only nine, or at the most ten, languages (excluding 
mere dialects) spoken on its coasts, while the number of States, count- 
ing ^lontenegro, Egypt, Malta, and ^Morocco as States, is ten. In the 
time of Herodotus tliere must have been at least 30 languages, while 
the independent or semi independent tribes, cities, and kingdoms were 
beyond all comparison more numerous. The result of migrations has 
been to overwhelm the small tribes and merge them in larger aggre- 
gates, while the process of permeation, usually, though not always, a 
sequel of conquest, has assimilated even those among whom no consid- 
erable number of intruders came. Sometimes the mere contiguity of 
the new and stronger race extinguishes the weak one, as in the case of 
the Tasmanian aborigines.* But more frequently the weaker is simply 
absorbed into and accepts the language and general tyi)e of the 
stronger, which is not necessarily the more gifted or the more civilized; 
and thus Britain has become Anglicized, the Celtic population retain- 
ing its languages and some of its distinctive marks only in western 
and mountainous corners; thus the Wends of i!^orth Germany have 
been Germanized, thus the Laps of the extreme north of Europe are 
being absorbed by the Norwegians, Finns, and Bussians; thus some of 
the Albanian clans arc being Hellenized; thus the Talains of I*egu are 
becoming merged in the Burmese, as possibly the latter may ultimately 
be in the Chinese. The remarkable thing is that neither this blending 
of races, nor the transfer of races to new climatic and economic condi- 
tions, tends to develop new types to anything like the same extent as 



* So the Guaaches of Tenerife sooa disappeared as a distinct race, though some of 
their blood remains; so the Maories and native Hawaiians have become greatly 
reduced in numbers, and are likely to become before long extinct. 



586 MIGRATIONS OF RACES OF MEN CONSIDERED HISTORICALLY. 

it destroys the old ones. The Crown is allowed to create one new Irish 
peerage for every three that die out. Nature uses her prerogative far 
more sparingly; she does not produce a new type for ten that vanish. 
Since the nations of modern Europe took their present distinct charac- 
ters with their languages and their local seats between the sixth and 
the eleventh centuries, no new nation has appeared in Eurojie, nor is 
there now the least likelihood that any will. Neither has the settle- 
ment of European man in the New World wrought any marked changes 
in national t^q^es even when there has been a blood-mingling on a great 
scale. The average Mexican, who is by extraction more than half an 
Indian, is for most practical purposes, religious, social, and ethical, a 
Spaniard. The man of Pennsylvania or Ohio is still more palpably an 
Englishman, nor does the immense infusion of Irish and German blood 
seem likely to affect the Anglo-American type as it tixed itself a cen- 
tury ago. Nothing shows more clearly the strength which a well-estab- 
lished racial character has than the fact that the climatic and economic 
conditions of America have so little altered the English settlers in 
body, so comparatively little even in mind. Nothing better illustrates 
the assimilative power of a vigorous community than the way in which 
the immigrants into the United States melt like sugar in a cup of tea, 
and see their children grow up no longer Germans or Norwegians, or 
even Irish or Italians or Czechs, but Anglo-Americans. With the 
negroes, on the other hand, there is practically no admixture; and so 
far as can be foreseen they will remain, at least in the sub-tropical i)arts 
of the South, distinctly African in their physical and mental character- 
istics for centuries to come. The same remark holds true of the white 
and black races in South Africa, wiiere the process of blood mixture, 
which w^ent on to some extent between the Dutch and the Hottentots, 
has all but stopped. 

Will this i)rocess of extinguishing and assimilating the weaker 
nationalities and their types of culture continue into a distant future? 
Have those movements of population which have been hitiierto so 
powerful a factor in that process nearly reached their limit? Since a 
time long before the dawn of history the various races seem to have 
been always in an unstable equilibrium, some constantly pressing ui>oii 
others, or seeking to escape from crowded into vacant, from cold or 
sterile into more genial or more fertile, lands. Is the time near at hand 
when they will have settled down in a permanent fashion, just as our 
globe itself has from a gaseous state solidified by the combination of 
its elements into its present stable form ? 

Over large parts of the earth this time seems already within a 
measurable distance. Nearly all of the north temperate zone, except 
parts of southwestern and southeastern Siberia (especially along the 
lower Amour), and parts of Western Canada, is now occupied, and 
most of it pretty thickly occupied. Districts there are which may be 
more closely packed: the Western United States, for instance, though 



MIGRATIONS OF RACES OF MEN CONSIDERED HISTORICALLY. 587 

all the best laud has already been taken up, can support a far larger 
population than they uow haA'e, and the same may be said of large 
tracts along the Alleghanies. But the attractions to emigrants 
become daily slighter as the conditions of agriculture grow less favor- 
able through theinlerior(iuality of the untouched land and theapproach- 
ing exhaustion of that which has been tilled for two or three decades, 
not to speak of that vast natural increase of the population already on 
the spot, which intensities the competition for employment. We may 
conjecture that within the lifetime of persons now living the outflow 
from Europe to North America will have practically stopped. A some- 
what longer time will be required to fill not only the far less attractive 
parts of I*Torthern Asia 1 have mentioned, but also such scantily 
inhabited though once flourishing regions as Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, 
and Persia, because a more torrid sun, and atrocious misgovernment, 
keep these regions, so to speak, out of the market. In the Southern 
Hemisphere, whose land area is far smaller, there are the temperate 
districts of Australia and South Africa, of which, so far as our present 
knowledge extends, no very large part has moisture enough to be 
available for tillage; while in South America there are La Plata, 
northern Patagonia, and the highlands of Bolivia, I'eru and Ecuador.* 
The elevation above the sea of these latter tracts gives them a tolera- 
ble climate, but their wealth lies chiefly in minerals, and the parts 
which are both healthy and fit for agriculture are of comparatively 
small extent. There remain the tropics. Vast regions of the tropics 
are at present scantily peopled. Most of equatorial South America is a 
forest wilderness. Much of tropical Africa — where it is not condemned 
to sterility by the want of water — seems to have a population far 
below what it could support, owing not merely to the wars and slave 
raids which devastate the country, but also to the fact that peoples 
unskilled in tillage can not make the soil yield anything like its full 
return of crops. The same remark applies to Borneo, Celebes, ISew 
Guinea, Luzon, and some of the other isles of the Eastern Archipelago, 
among which only Java has as yet seen its resources duly developed. 
That there will be considerable migrations and shiftings of population 
among the races that now inhabit the tropics is probable enough. 
India ( except the central provinces and Assam ) and China are both 
filled to overflowing, and will doubtless continue to send out streams 
of emigrants which may in time fill up the vacant spaces in the Eastern 
Archipelago, perhaps in South America, perhaps even in Africa, unless 
some of its indigenous races should ripen into a greater capacity for 
patient and steady toil than any, except the Egyptian, has yet shown. 
But none of these tropical peoples, save the Chinese — for Japan hes 
outside the tropics— has a native civilization, or is fitted to play any 
part in history either as a conquering or as a thinking force, or in any 



*The elevated parts of ei(natorial Africa an- mnch smaller, though possibly large 
enough to support a European population of some few millions. 



588 MIGRATIONS OF RACES OF MEN CONSIDERED HISTORICALLY. 

way, save as i)roduceis by i)liysical labor of material wealth. None is 
likely to develop toward any higher eoiiditiou than that in which it 
now stands, save niider the tutelage, and by adopting so much as it 
can of the cnltuie, of the live or six European ix'oples which have 
practically appropriated the torrid zone, and are dividing its resources 
between them. Yet the vast numbers to which, uiuler the conjoint 
stimuli of science aiul peace, these inferior black and yellow races may 
grow, coupled with the capacity some of them e\'ince for assimilating 
the material side of European civilization, may enable them to play a 
larger part in the future of the world than they have played in the 
past. 

It is, of course, possible that the great European i:)eoples, or some of 
them, may, after a few generations, acquire the power of thriving in 
the tropics, of resisting malarial fevers, and of rearing an of('s[>ring 
which need not be sent home to a cold climate during the years of boy- 
hood. We may call it possible, because our experience is still too 
short to justify us in calling it impoSvSible, But it seems so far from 
probable tiiat in considering the future of the leading and ruling races 
of the world we nuist practically leave their permanent settlement in 
the tropics out of the question, and restrict our view to the two tem- 
perate zones. In these, as has been said, there is no longer room and 
verge for any great further removal of masses of men from one country 
to another. If, indeed, we were merely to look at a map indicating the 
comparative density of population in Northern Asia, Europe, and 
America, and see how much denser it is in the agricultural parts of 
France or Germany, for instance, than in Southwestern Siberia or the 
noithwest of the United States and Canada, we might fancy the space 
remaining to be suflicient for many centuries to come. But if we were 
to compare such a map of to-day with a similar map of the world in 
1780, and note how much of what would then have been marked as 
empty space, including all the vast area between the Alleghanies and 
the Pacific, has now been occupied, we shall realize the immense 
advance that has been made towards the establishment of an equilib- 
rium of population and the relative shortness of the future during 
which we can look to emigration as a remedy for the evils which afHict 
the toiling masses of Europe. In this respect, as in many others, the 
world seems to be entering on a new era, whose phenomena will prove 
unlike any that have gone before. 

It may be thought that as migrations have been a frequent cause of 
war in the past, the establishment of such an eijuilibrium will make 
for peace. But it must also be remembered that the pressure of each 
nation on its neighbors, and of the members of each nation on one 
another, tends to grow more severe with that severer struggle for sub- 
sistence which increasing numbers involve, and which, after a few 
more generations, the outlets that now still remain will no longer 
relieve. 



THE ^'^-TATIOI^'' AS AN ELEMENT IX ANTHROPOLOGY.* 



By Daniel G, Brinton. 



The subject wliicli I bring' before you is one which I have selected in 
order to impress upon you forcil)ly the true breadth and full meaning 
of the science toward the cuiti\ation of whicli we have assembh^d at 
this time. 

There is no other word wliicli so thoroughly expresses the purpose of 
this brancli of learning as that which we have adopted — Anthropology, 
the science of man, the study of the nature of man, the search for and 
correct expression of those laws, and all the hiws, which govern the 
birth, growth. dev('lo])nH'nt, and decay of all his traits, powers, and 
facvdties. 

Anthroi>ology means this, and notlung less than this. Its motto is 
that of the character in the Terentiau drama — 

''»! me viiUiim liitmannin alioiinn puto.'' 

It embraces everything and excludes nothing which pertains to 
humanity, whether in the individual or in his various aggregations. It 
omits no part or function of him as unworthy of its notice; it admits 
the existence of none so suj)erior or sacred as to be beyond the pale of 
its investigations. The held which it goes forth to reap is the world, 
and its harvest season covers all time since man first set foot upon it. 

It is signally unfortunate that the full connotation of the term has 
not been <'onstantly present in the minds of those who have pursued 
the science. We should not then have witnessed tlie cheerless spec- 
tacle of one school of anthroi)ologists claiming that man is nothing 
more than the highest mammal, and that the study of his anatomical 
and physiological relations exhausts the definition of their science, and 
that those who go beyond these are merely " historians and men of 
letters;" or that of anotlier school, which, disregarding the incalculable 
potency of man's physical conditions, seeks to erect the science exclu- 
sively on Ihe basis of the products of the mental faculties, his arts, 
institutions, religions, and languages. 



*Pre8idential address before the luteruatioual Congress of Anthropology at Chicago, 
1893. (From proceedings of the congress, jip. 19-34.)

590 THr: "nation "as an element in anthropology. 

Each is eiiually iu error. No correct and comprehensive idea can be 
formed of the varions elements wliich liave rendered man what he is, 
or iiuy race or stock of men what it is, nnless all these phenomena 
receive dne consideration, and the various agencies which intinence 
them are weighed with impartial fairness. The historian must become 
an anatomist, the anatomist a linguist, if he Avould reach positive results 
in this study. 

You observe that the i>rogramme of this congress includes physical 
anthropology, arclnieology, ethnology, folk-lore, it3ligions, and linguis- 
tics. It would be an epoch in the history of the science, a notable 
era in its development, if the labors we are about to enter upon should 
lastingly impress on all who pursue this branch that every one of these 
departments is equally important, that not'one of them can be neglected 
or o\erlooke(l, that the richest iu result.'' is slill hut 2)rimi<s inter })ares^ 
a brother among brethren. 

To illustrate how closely the multitudinous intluences which they 
rcjuesent are woven together, and how eacdi bears ui)on the whole 
nature of man, I shall consider with brevity in what manner that entity 
which we call a "• nation '' api)ears as an eltMiient in anthropology. I 
have been i)artly, though by no means wholly, led to make this selec- 
tion l)ecause this particular question has been much misunderstood in 
some (juarters and its bearings misconceived. As late as at the con- 
gress at ^Moscow last year, a distinguished writer in our branch of 
science said, ''Nationality has nothing to do with anthropology. It is 
a product of history and concerns liistory only." 

So far from this being correct, I shall endeavor to show that nation- 
ality has ever been and is to-day an agent more powerful in modifying 
both the physical and the psychical elements of man than either race, 
climate, religion, or culture; and therefore that it must constantly 
occupy the attention of the anthropologist, whether his researches are 
in the purely physical or in the intellectual fields. 

1 desire to emphasize the fact that the anthropologist will never 
fully comprehend the science which he professes to follow, will never 
attain the preception of its whole significance, if he omits from its 
study, as not pertaining strictly to it, any infiuence whatever which 
bears upon and modifies in any direction the evolution of the human 
species. This the nation does with a directness and a potency which 
can not be misunderstood or called in question. 

Let us inquire what it is we mean by the expression "a people" or 
"a nation," when we use these terms as synonymous. I can find no 
more i)rofound and true definition than that given by the most philo- 
sophic English poet of this century, Robert Browning, in these words: 

"A people is but the attempt of many 
To rise to the completer life of one." 

The incompleteness and im]»erfectness of the life of the isolated 
individual, and his conscious or unconscious aspirations for completion 



THE "nation "as AN ELEMENT IN ANTHROPOLOGY. 591 

and perfection, are the motives which have ever nrged man to establish 
those relations with his fellows which result in what we call social ties 
or bonds. 

Although to the superficial observer these seem to have been most 
heterogeneous and fortuit-ous, a comprehensive analysis reduces them 
to a very few so far as their guiding principles are concerned. Here as 
elsewhere in ethnology we are impressed with the paucity, yes, I may 
even say the poverty, of the resources Avhich have been utilized by man 
in his upward marcli to conscious culture. 

Wherever we find men united together under some form of social 
compact, we shall find also that this compact will fall under one of 
three categories. It is based upon community, either real or theoretical, 
of blood, of territorial area, or of purpose. These three forms are 
mutually incompatible; they are exclusive of and in sharp contrast 
with one another; they react very differently upon the individual and 
the race; and they belong markedly to different periods in the history 
of a people, to different stages of its advancement in culture. 

It may be laid down as a rule with few or no exceptions that the 
earliest form of the social bond is one of blood, of kinship, of con- 
sanguinity and affinity. The unit of the primitive horde is the family; 
the one cohesive princii:)le which it recognizes as socially binding is 
purity of descent, the maintenance of the integrity of the stock, as its 
members understand it. Here then we see a mighty influence at 
work to preserve in primitive times and conditions the unity of the 
l^hysical type. The visible aim of communities in the lower stages of 
culture is to preserve at all costs the characteristics of the race to 
which they belong, and the particular traits of the variety of that race 
as inherited from their ancestors. This is the guiding principle of 
what is known as matriarchy and the custom of tracing the genealogical 
line through the maternal and not through the ])aternal ancestry. 
Positive certainty as to parentage nuist in every case be limited to the 
mother, and for that reason the female line always insures a higher 
probability of purity of descent. 

Of course the degree with which the conservation of the type was 
really maintained under this system depended on the local laws or 
customs regarding marriage and the fidelity required of married women. 
It is true that in both these respects there is considerable divergence 
in early conditions. In some places exogamous marriages prevailed; 
that is, the wife must not be an acknowledged relation of the husband; 
more frequently, marriages must be endogamous, that is, she must be 
of his recognized kin ; though often this again is limited, as that she 
must not be an offspring of the same mother, or not be within certain 
degrees of kinship. Reminiscences of these restrictions still prevail 
in civilized communities, in the laws prohibiting the marriage of near 
relations, or, as in England, prohibiting marriage with a deceased 
wife's sister. 



592 THE " NATION " A8 AN ELEMENT IN ANTHROPOLOGY. 

In spite of these limitations, which differ widely in different tribes, 
the general influence of the principle of consanguinity as the basis of 
the social compact unquestionably aided through countless ages to 
individualize the physical types of the human species, and thus to 
develop and render liernument its races and varieties as we now know 
them. 

So powerful was this prejudice in favor of the ancestral type, that it 
was a general custom in i)rimitive times to destroy at or shortly after 
birth any aberrant types, and to bring all into accord with the tribal 
idea. For instance, in certain parts of Mexico there is a tendency to 
congenital albinism in the native })opulation ; and before the coiKiuest all 
children displaying tliis tendency were sacrificed to tlie gods before the 
age of puberty. Among the Papuans, when a child is born of a lighter 
color than the average of the tribe, it is assiduously held in the smoke 
of green branches until it is tanned to the projier hue. Indeed, 
whenever there was any material variation from the received type, 
the infant was sure not to live to that period of life when he or she 
could transmit it to offspring; and thus a potent factor in the evolution 
of the species toward mo<lified forms was absent throughout all the 
chiUlhood of the human race, owing to the conditions of tlie i)revailing 
social compact. 

The somatologist will object to this, that in the very earliest times 
and within limited areas we find that a wide diversity of typei)revailed. 
For instance, I sujjpose the oldest remains of the hnnum race found ui» 
to the present have been unearthed in Western Europe. I Jut these 
venerable relics show tlie existence there in remotest times and at no 
great distance apart (not more than a few days' walk of an active 
pedestrian), of men with broad heads, and others with narrow heads, 
with narrow faces and with wide faces, Avitli exjianded flat noses and 
with narrow aquiline noses, of stature below the medium and others 
above the medium ; and we may reasonably conclude from their descend- 
ants that some were blonds with yellow hair, while others were swarthy 
brunettes with locks like the raven's wing. So that Prof. Kollmann, 
who has made this subject a special study, can not see his way clear to 
admit less than four different races struggling for the soil of Western 
Eurojie in prehistoric times. 

Yet if we may judge from some historic data and all analogy, these 
ancient peoples, like all others, strove to retain in its purity the type 
of their ancestors by a social organization looking to that end. 

Two customs prevail everywhere in primitive life which largely 
counteract the result of consanguine marriages; the one is adoi)tion, 
the other concubinage. Usually, in their unceasing wars, the males of 
conquered tribes were killed and the women taken as ca])tives, thus 
ii!troducing through the females of another line the peculiarities of 
their variety or race. 

In some instances however, the males were in part preserved and 



THE ''nation" AS AN ELEMENT IN ANTHROPOLOGY. 593 

adopted into the claus of the couqueraug tribe, either as members or as 
slaves. In either case they led to a modification of the ascendant 
type. 

So varied were and are the cnstoms and rules of primitive [)eoples in 
all these respects that it would be vain to attempt to establish a formula 
representing the degree in which the integrity of the racial or ethnic 
type was maintained; but the aim of their institutions being always and 
definitely this, we may be sure that they tended very positively to pre- 
serving the lineage undefiled, and to perpetuating the physical and 
mental traits of each community. When this did not occur, it was in 
contradiction to the theory of the social compact, and arose from igno- 
rance of the natural conditions which insure perpetuitj^ of type, or their 
disregard, owing to the cravings of individual appetite. 

In entire contrast to all tliis are both the theory and the practice which 
we find in the next higher step in social relations, that which has for its 
basis a geographical or territ(nial concept. 

In this, it is not the notion of kinship butthatof conntrywhich is pre- 
dominant. The patriot of this epoch fights no longer for his lineage, 
but for his land, not for his relations, but for the realm. He expresses 
in this the sentiment which actuates the nation, properly so called. 
Consanguine governments are tribal governments; with the birth of a 
genuine nationality, the family, the gens, the tribe, are all doomed to 
disappear, and with them the modifying influences they exerted on the 
race. 

The inter veuiug step between the tribe and the nation is usually said 
to be the federation, in which several tribes agree to forget their jeal- 
ousies and unite in defense or offense. This condition is transitory, and 
I shall pass it by, in order to consider the direct influence of nationality 
on those elements of human nature which are the i)eculiar topics of 
anthropologic science. 

The first object of nationality is unity, and this in the fullest sense of 
the term and in all the relations of national life. 

Almost the very first of its aims is physical unity. A visible contrast 
between the inhabitants of different areas under one rule is suggestive 
to the legislator of a lack of harmony in other respects. The influence 
of a court, or of centralization generally, has ever been to disseminate 
throughout the realm one standard of physical beauty, as also one of 
costume and deportment; and this irrespective of how many discrepant 
varieties go to make up the body of the nation. 

In this, as in all other respects, the chief efforts of the nation tiuough 
its rulers are directe<^l toward destroying those indi\idual and tribal 
traits which forms of government based on consanguinity make it their 
chief end to cherish. 

This contrast presents itself early. We find for instance that the 
native rulers of ancient Pern, the Incas, were accustomed, as soon as 
they had subjugated a new province, to deport large numbers of its 
SM 93 38 



594 THE "nation "as an element in anthropology. 

inhabitants to divStant })arts of their empire and supply their places 
with inhabitants of other tribes who had been long- subject to their 
rule. 

This plan of partial deportation and colonization was familiar to the 
Carthaginians, Romans, and other enterprising nations of the Mediter- 
ranean Basin, and explains to a large extent the constant blending of 
extreme i»hysical types which the somatologist discovers in the remains 
from the oldest cemeteries around that great interior sea. We know 
by history and tradition that the '* blond Libyans," the light-haired, 
blue-eyed natives of Northern Africa, tall and dolichocephalic, were 
transported in large numbers across the sea to the north, and settled 
amcmg the smaller, swarthy, and brachycephalic tribes, whom we 
vaguely hear of under the names of Ligurians, Aquitanians, and 
Iberians. 

Another physical lever which the nation, as distinct from the tribe, 
brings to bear on the physical traits of the species within its limit 
is its iniiitary organization. This is no longer classilied by clans, or 
gentes, but is an army, with its soldiers drawn indiscriminately from all 
parts of its territory, and moving indifferently into all parts as occasion 
calls ior. In earlier and more disturbed times, when social ethics were 
less regarded than to day, the presence of large numbers of men can- 
toned and quartered upon the inhabitants, often exercising over them 
a l)rutal authority, led to constant commingling of race types and the 
gradual extinction of local peculiarities. 

The iutiuence which the nation as an anthropologic element exerts on 
language is one which demands our special attention. When it is 
rightly understood, much of that contest which has been going on for 
years between ethnographers, as to the worth or worthlessness of lan- 
guage as a guide in ethnography, will appear in a different light. 

It is obvious that it would be consonant with the si)irit of a gentile 
or consanguine society to preserve pertinaciously its. own inherited 
speech, and to oppose any changes in it. But it is just as much in its 
spirit to desire to confine its own tongue to its own members and to 
look with jealousy on others than thOfeC of the true blood making use 
of it. Professional linguists in the American field are well acquainted 
with the prevailing unwillingness of the natives to give much informa- 
tion about their languages. They regard with suspicion and distrust 
in(]uirers into their own peculiar dialects; it is in the nature of a tres- 
pass upon i)rivate property. The federations of tribes never go so far 
as to attempt to establish linguistic or dialectic unity. Only incident- 
ally and accidentally does one tongue partly encroach upon another one 
in this stage of society. 

For this reason the linguistic classification in ethnography is a truly 
valuable one in all conditions of life where the consanguine rule ])revails. 
The language is then a trustworthy guide of affiliation, both exclusively 
and inclusively, and the instances are extremely rare, if any indeed 



THE '' NATION "as AN ELEMENT IN ANTHROPOLOGY. 595 

exist, wliere one tribe had deliberately forced another to change its 
language as the condition oteniering into an alliance. 

The so-called ''Empire of Anahuac," ill Mexico, tlie organization of 
which had not wholly emerged from the consanguine condition, held as 
conquered and tributary many tribes of different s])eech, but had made 
no eftbrt to impose upon any of them its own sonorous and beautiful 
language. On the other hand, Peru, which had reached a condition of 
national existence, exerted constant and strong iDressure, as its histo- 
rian, Garcilaso de la Yega, assures us, to crush and extirpate all other 
tongues throughout its domains than the Kechiia, that spoken by the 
Incas and their congeners. It Avas declared to be the official language, 
and there was no hope for promotion for one not familiar with it. In 
this respect, those enlightened rulers of the Peruvian state displayed 
an insight into what constitutes the very strongest bond of national 
unity, which we here in the United States appreciate yet but imper- 
fectly. It is within my own memory that the acts of assembly of my 
own State were issued in two languages, thus encouraging a long- 
existing linguistic discrepancy between the citizens of that common- 
wealth. Linguistic unity is the indispensable basis of national unity. 
When, as is the case with one of the i^resent Eiiro})eaii empires, we 
hear of thirty-six different languages being current under one rule, we 
may be sure there is no real coherence in the nation. 

The recognition of this fact, and the steady efibrts directed toward 
the extermination of subordinate tongues and the substitution of a 
general or national one in their i^lace, has led to the phenomenon of 
peoples of the same descent speaking different idioms, and those of 
alien origin expressing themselves through one and the same medium. 

It remains true nevertheless — and this is an important point too 
often lost sight of in the discussion — that this substitution of one lan- 
guage for another never takes place witliout an extensive admixture of 
blood; for there is no more potent and prompt method of attacking the 
integrity of a language than by inter-marriage. Indeed, except in 
cases of slavery, we may almost establish the formula that the admix- 
ture of blood under such circumstances bears the fixed relation of one- 
half to one; that is, that when a language has superseded another, 
one-half of the marriages in the latter have been with members of the 
former. Of course, by marriages in this relation we mean continued 
sexual unions, not necessarily legal ceremonies. 

Whatever the national form of government adopted, the principal 
maxims of jurisprudence and the ethical principles upon which they 
repose are profoundly modified by the substitution of the national in 
jjlace of the tribal idea. 

I will illustrate this contrast by an example familiar to the students 
of the early history of this country. 

The European settlers in the colonies of Pennsylvania and New York 
could not understand why, when in time of peace an Indian murdered 



596 THE ''nation" AS AN ELEMENT IN ANTHROPOLOGY. 

a white uiau, they could obtain no redress from the tribal government 
with whom they had treaty relations. They regarded such indolence a 
breach of faith and proof of evil intention. It was nothing of the kind. 
A crime of blood was something which concerned the consanguine 
gens only; it was a family matter with which the tribal council had no 
concern and about which it could take no action ; it was in no sense a 
crime against the commonwealth. 

This view of the case was something wholly incomprehensible to the 
Europeans, who belonged to states where a felony or a breach of the 
peace is an attack on the community. In other words, ethnic jurispru- 
dence is something quite different when the nation appears on the stage 
of history from what it is in the tribal condition. 

This contrast runs through the whole of ethics. In a thoughtful 
article, published some years ago in the Zeitachrift fiir Efhnologie, Dr. 
Kulischer j)ointed out that in primitive conditions ethics presents a 
dualistic aspect: It demands the cultivation of kindness, protection, 
assistance, love, and peace to our friends, but quite as much does it 
prescribe hatred, enmity, robbery, murder, and deception toward our 
enemy. The nation breaks down the walls of narrow tribal animosi- 
ties; it increases the number of those whose patriotic interests are in 
common, and thus widens the area of duty and the conceptions of 
ethics; but who dares say that our own conceptions of ethics are much 
beyond the primitive stage when still the greatest hero among us is the 
most skillful in murdering men — the most expert military commander? 

Anything like a categorical imperative in ethics, a prescription of 
duty which should be the law of everyone toward all men would be 
out of the question in a society based on relationship or on narrow 
territorial considerations. 

Nowhere does this ethical contrast become more apparent than in 
the relations of the one to the'many, of the individual to the mass, a 
feature in ethnic jurisprudence admirably brought out in his recent 
masterly work on the subject by Dr. Albert Hermann Post. 

In the tribal, totemic. or consanguine condition of government the 
individual is not regarded as an independent unit. The obligations he 
has to fultill are those of his gens, and his actions are regarded, not as 
his own, but as those of a member of his gens. 

If he robs or murders, the punishment falls, not on him personally, 
but on the gens; and if blood money or other compensation is 
demanded, it is not from him that it is required, but from the gens. 

He in turn is liable for any crime his fellow-clansmen may commit; 
and in this vicarious expiation he sees nothing in conflict with the 
principles of abstract justice. He has not yet reached to the conscious- 
ness of himself as an individual. He accepts the obligations of his 
clan as his own, and is scarcely aware that he suffers any diminution 
because he can create no obligations himself otherwise than in his posi- 
tion as a representative of the clan or gens. 



THE ''nation" AS AN ELEMENT IN ANTHROPOLOGY. 597 

This is also true of his civil rights and tliose which refer to prop- 
erty. Wherever the cousanguiiie theory is iu force, the communal idea 
of property is also active. The land belongs iu part or iu whole to the 
kith and kin, in the nature of common land, or is sublet by the heads 
of the comnuiuity on longer or shorter tenures. Personal property is so 
only in the sense that it belongs to the members of an immediate family 
or subgens, not to an individual, and in many instances passes in the 
female line. 

It is obvious that in such a condition of society uo idea of independ- 
ent personal duty or individual morality could rise in the mind; and 
should any such enter through foreign instigation, it Avould be con- 
demned as false, destructive, and treasonable. 

Permit me to dwell on this point with some detail because of its 
prime importance. Those considerations which establish in a commu- 
nity its moral code, its ideal standard of what is right, of conscience, 
and of duty, pronounce the final sentence on the fate of that commu- 
nity. In all earlier conditions the preservation of the gens or tribe 
rested more on measures of destruction than of protection. Hence, 
toward the alien and the stranger justice and mercy were out of place 
and actually prohibited. C?esar tells us of the ancient Germans, (and 
Nordenskjold repeats the same of the modern Tchuktches of Siberia,) 
that they respected no law of honesty in dealing with strangers or 
those alien to their tribe. To cheat such in trade, to deceive and to 
Ijlunder them, Avas actually meritorious. 

In such communities the stranger has no rights, and can claim no 
protection as a fellow human being. He can only attain such through 
some rite of adoption into the tribe, or through some ceremony by 
which he can claim the privileges of hospitality — what German writers 
call the Gastrecht. The gens, the clan, the tribe, is an isolated unit, in 
natural antagonism to the race at large, and recognizes no sort of soli- 
darity with its other members, nay, regards them as foes. 

How different is all this in the developed system of the state ? There 
the individual man is held accountable for his own actions. He is con- 
sidered responsible for the deeds he commits and, therefore, feels that 
he is answerable to himself for the opinions and etliical tlieories which 
lie at the basis of Ins life and direct his conduct. For the first time 
in the histor}" of the race he learns the meaning of persoiialiti/, the 
highest lesson which advancing civilization can impress on humanity. 
He sees that by himself he must either stand or fall; that no vicarious 
expiation can meet the demands of what is eternally right; that his 
responsibility does not belong to another, nor can it be involved by the 
actions of another, but ever centers in his own thoughts and actions. 
Thus is he gradually euumcipated from that condition of tutelage and 
hereditary bondage in which he was so long kept by the consanguine 
theory of government. 

I can not too strongly impress upon you that this concept of person- 



598 THE ''nation" AS AN ELEMENT IN ANTHROPOLOGY. 

ality is a totally ditt'ereut cDuditiou from that of the isolated primitive 
man. We may ima<;iiie such an one, living alone with his one wife, his 
cliildren around him, his household goods and gods all within his lonely 
lodge. That man's monogamy, his sense of [»roi)erty, his feelings of 
duty and responsibility, of association and independence, can in no 
way he assimilated to those of the man who is the free product of the 
state, developed through countless generations of gradual culture. 
To the scientitic anthroi)ologist the one is the complete contrast to the 
other; they have nothing in common but their external membershij) of 
the same species and a vague resemblance of external coiulitions. 

The individual is indeed the true purpose of the state. Its aim dis- 
tinctly is that he, or she, as au individual, shall be provided with, and 
protected in, the greatest possible amount of personal liberty; in this 
being in the utmost contrast to consanguine governments, where the 
individual is nothing, the tribe everything. 

The value of personal liberty is as a means toward the accpiisition of 
personal happiness, and hence we are willing to accept the definition of 
the modern idea of justice as advanced by the enn"nent French anthro 
l)ologist, Andre Lefevre — that it is the respect for every interest which 
contributes to the highest general happiness of humanity; and we can 
not refuse to accept the definition of morality which Ho\elac(]ue and 
Herve offer, as the only one which anthropologists can recognize; that 
it is tlie i>rinciple of organization for the purpose of satisfying the phys- 
ical and intellectual needs of all men; a princii)le which they justly 
add, can only be carried out successfully by guaranteeing to the indi- 
vidual the highest degree of personal liberty in every direction, limited 
by no other barrier than the enjoyment of similar liberty by every other 
individual. 

It is obvious on very slight reflection that the state as an element in 
anthropology has by no means worked out its full destiny in modifying 
the physical and psychical nature of man. As a form of government 
it is far from covering the whole of the earth's surface, and where it is 
nominally present it is still further in many instances from that per- 
fected condition in which it has thrown aside the clogs and fetters of 
the consanguine system to which it succeeded. 

Take the vast Emj)ire of China for instance. It is ruled by a foreign 
dynasty on general principles of statecraft. But throug-hout all the 
really ( 'hinese portions of the empire the details of the family system 
are retained with wonderful tenacity. 

But we need not go so far for examples. Wherever we find a system of 
castes orof privileged classes, au hereditary nobility, or a state church, 
a transmissible community of property, whether real or personal, any 
inequality in the rights and responsibilities of sane adult individuals 
before the law, any concessions which relieve classes, or i)ersons, or 
sects, or societies, or sexes of their full measure of liability, or confer 
upon them privileges or deny them rights enjoyed by others, there we 



THE "nation" as AN ELEMENT IN ANTHROPOLOGY. 599 

are in the presence of a form of governnieiit still clinging" in these 
respects to the i)rimitive theories of human society. The student of 
ethnological jurisprudence will class it to this extent with the totemic 
and gentile systems of the lower and earlier strata of liumau develop- 
ment. 

Let me illustrate this by the relative position of woman in a tribe and 
in an enliglitened State. I could not touch upon a weightier question 
to the somatologist, for none other so intimately relates to physical 
anthropology. 

In spite of the matriarchal system, woman in all lower conditions of 
society is treated as inferior to man and is deprived of many rights 
which he enjoys. The exceptions to this are extremely rare, if any 
really exist. The cause of her inferiority is solely her less physical 
powers; it has ever been because she is bodily th.e weaker. The forms 
of marriage have made no difterence. Whether a nnin could legally 
take to himself a multitude of wives, or whether, as in Thibet to-day, a 
woman could legally take a multitude of husbands; whether she was 
.bought openly in tlie nnitrimonial market, or whether, as in this coun- 
try, she could pick and choose at will from all her admirers; whether 
polygamy or monogamy prevails she has ever been treated as man's 
inferior, disallowed equal rights, prevented from equal liberty. So it 
remains to-day, though with some improvement. 

At first she was but a slave and a beast of burden; at present, so far 
as the enjoyment of civic rights in modern states is concerned, she has 
risen to be classed among idiots and children. Surely we may hope 
that she has not yet attained the acme of her evolution. 

A peculiar interest is attached to the development of this iufiuiryby 
the fact that it was originally an American contribution to our science. 
The first who clearly pointed out the distinction between gentile and 
political conditions of society, that is, between the tribe and the 
state, was the late Mr. Lewis H. Morgan; and, although we have been 
obliged materially to modify many of his opinions, to him belongs the 
credit of being the earliest to present in scientific form this important 
truth in anthropology. He did not perceive very clearly its bearings 
on physical anthropology, to which I have referred above, but he was 
fully awake to the potent agency of the state, as distinguished from 
the tribe, on the psychical nature of man. The following sentence from 
his chapter on the evolution of Greek culture Avill show this: 

"That remarkable development of genius and intelligence which 
raised the Athenians to the highest eminence among the historical 
nations of mankind occurred aftei' they had adopted democratic insti- 
tutions, and these gave its inspiration." 

By "democratic institutions" Mr, Morgan meant the substitution of 
a national for a tribal life. 

But it would be an error to consider the state as we now know it, 
even in its best examples, as the final form which this element will 



600 THE ''nation" AS AN ELEMENT IN ANTHROPOLOGY. 

take in moldiug the body and the iiiiiid of man, his aspirations and 
his ethical instincts. Already there are evident signs that at no very 
distant future the human race will outgrow the limits of nationality 
and will demand and find vsome guiding principle which will break 
down the barriers which the nation, under present conditions, must 
perforce erect around itself; which will do away with the latent hos- 
tility which now requires the maintenance of enormous military estab- 
lishments, and will successfully solve the problem of absolutely con- 
serving the rights of the individual without impairing the efficiency of 
the organization. 

It is easy to predict from what direction and under what impulses 
this desirable result will be brought about. Every year is making it 
clearer to the eye of the attentive observer; and never anywhere or at 
any time has there been in the history of humanity a grander example 
of its growth and potency than here, at this moment, we have spread 
before our admiring gaze. It is by means of international action, 
through associations and organizations formed for international i)ur 
poses, that the highest and ultimate efficiency of government will be 
reached; and then it will be discovered to be one with anthropology, 
the science of man, the discovery of the laws which will lead him to 
the utmost symmetrical development of all his faculties, to his maxi- 
mum efficiency, to his highest happiness. 



SUMMARY OF PROCxRESS IN ANTHROPOLOGY. 



By Otis Tufton Mason. 



GENERAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 

C<»n2>rchcH.sii-(' ivorks. — No great work ai>peared in 1893 in \A'bich a 
distinguislied anthropologist summed up tlie results of his studies upon 
the whole subject of the natural history of man. The annual address 
of the president of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and 
Ireland brings together the work done by that society in an orderly 
manner, and a lecture bureau course of instruction was given by sj^e- 
cialists through the United Kingdom under its auspices. 

The Anthropological Society in Washington conducted successfully 
twelve Saturday lectures by distinguished si)ecialists, covering the 
ground of the whole scieuce. Dr. Brinton, in Philadelphia, also con- 
tinued his comprehensive course. In most German universities there 
is some one professor who delivers an encyclopaedic series of lectures 
on anthropology. 

During the year tlie program of the ficole d' Anthropologic in Paris 
was as follows: 

Medical geography. M. Bordier. 
Autliropogeny and huiiiaii cml)ryology. ]\L Duval. 
Ethnology. Georges Hervt^. 
Linguistics and ethnography. Andr6 Lefevre. 
History of civilizations. Ch. Letourneau. 
Zoological anthropology. T. G. Mahondeau. 
Physiological anthropology. L. Manouvrier. 
Comparative ethnography. A. de Jlortillet. 
Prehistoric antlirepology. G. de Mortillet. 
' Geographic anthropology. Fr. Schrader. 

These lectures are of the highest order, and are recognized by the 
minister of public instruction as of general utility. 

In the New Standard Dictionary just issuing by Funk & Wagnalls, 
of New Y'ork, as much attention is paid to words in this department of 
knowledge as in any other. Cassell, Johnston, the old reliable diction- 
aries, in their new editions, at last recognize the importance of this 
science. 

The classification of anthropology in the British Association's Notes 

and Queries into anthropogrnphy and ethnology takes the last-named 

term out of the realm of biological anthropology and places it at the 

head of all the functional sciences of man.

602 SUMMARY OF PROGRESS IN ANTHROPOLOGY. 

Socidicfi, — The iiaiiie of societies oigauized for the study of man 
alone is k'giou. Add to this the sections of academies and institutes 
of general science tliat have for their aim the study of whatever cou 
cerns man, and with this condjine the work of other special societies 
that bear in some fashion upon this latest of sciences, and the general 
student becomes bewildered. These societies pul)lish Jouriuils, bulle- 
tins, proceedings, memoirs, and even periodicals. 

Xot satislied with home societies, students in every enlightened 
country combine in stated assemblies. Of these the chief are: Inter- 
national Congress of Anthropology and Prehistoric^ Archi^ology, held 
in 1893 in Moscow; Society of Americanists; Congress of Anthropology 
at the World's Columbian Exposition, and the German Society of 
Anthropology, held annually. 

Furthermore, each imtional association for the advancement of 
science has a section of anthropology. To these belong Section II, 
American Association for the Advancement of Science; Section of 
Anthropology in the ]>ritish Association; Section of Anthropology in 
theCerman Society of Xaturalists and Physicians; Section of Anthro- 
pology in the French Association for the Advancement of Science. 
And, of especial interest, the colonies of Germany, France, and Eng- 
land have organized associations in the Orient based on those at 
home. 

At the American Association for the Advancement of Science the 
chief contributions to anthropology were as follows : The Biloxi Indians 
of Louisiana, vice-presidential address by the Pev. J. Owen Horsey, 
showing them to belong to the Siouan stock : The lecture of Dr. Brin- 
ton upon " Early man," assigning to the human race as its birth-place 
the nKHintainous zone extending from the western foot-slopes of the 
Alps through the Hinmlayas nearly to the borders of the Yellow Sea: 
The paper by Prof. W. H. Holmes on "Primal shaping arts;"' the 
phenomena of the shaping arts are classitied by materials, processes, 
function of the product, culture stage of the artist, by order of develop- 
ment, and by peoples or races.

In June, 1893, the Societa Romaua di Autropologia was organized in 
Rome, with one hundred founders. The society will devote itself to 
the science of man in all of its branches. Prof. Guiseppe Sergi, author 
of Principles and methods of classifying the human race, and kSys- 
tematic catalogue of the varieties of man in Russia, was made presi- 
dent. Florence boasts still of the most efficient anthropological society 
in Italy. 

At Moscow, during the first three weeks in August, the scientific 
people gave themselves to entertaining congresses, to wit: The Inter- 
national Congress of Anthropology and Prehistoric Archaeology, eleventh 
session, and The International Congress of Zoology, second session. 
Even in the last-named, papers were read that were of interest to an- 
thropologists, such as Psychophysical study on the memory of sensa- 
tion, by X. Savelier, and study of the re[)artition of animals in vertical 
contours.

The World's Fair Congress of Aiitliroi)ology a1* Cliicago was oi)eiied 
with an address l)y the president, Dr. Brinton, on -'tbe nation as an 
element in anthropology."* Pai)ers on physical anthropology were read 
by Franz Boas, (Jerald M. West, and Manuel A. Muniz; on etlmology 
communications were made by Dr. Brinton, Walter Hough, Miss 
Fletcher, Carl Lundiolz, and O. T. Mason. Dr. Brinton aflirmed that 
no good evidence exists of contact between America and Asia in i)re- 
Columbian times, but this was denied by Prof. Mason. Miss Fletclier's 
essay on Omaha music was a defense of the opinion that the 'uusical 
scales of civilization are found in savagery in an undeveloped state. 
Mr. Mason's paper was a resume of American aboriginal tools, uses of 
natural power, metric apparatus, meclianics, engineering, and maclnnery. 

In archaeology, the leading paper was by Mrs. Zelia Kuttall on the 
Mexican calendar system, elaborately set forth in a series of charts. 

Communications on folk-lore and religion were made by W. W. Newell, 
Franz Boas, J. Walter Fewkes, G. F. Kunz, Morris Jastrow, Mrs Sara 
Y. Stevenson, and Mrs. ^Matilda C. Stephenson. 

One of the most instructive performances at the Congress Avas the 
explanation of exhibits and visits paid by invitation to the various 
parts of the grounds. 

The Columbian Historical Exposition in Madrid was so far a success 
that there was brought together in the new national library and museum 
building the greatest collection of Americana ever under one roof. The 
Smithsonian Institution and many bureaus of the Government in 
Washington, the great museums of Philadelphia, New York, Boston, 
and Cambridge, mul especially the Hemenway ex|)edition, were well 
represented. Besides, all the Latin American States sent their treasures 
to complete the exhibition. Most of the valuable collections appeared 
again in Chicago. 

MnseuviH. — The museum idea was prominent in the minds and the 
publications of the World's Columbian LLxposition during its entire 
progress. Prof. F. W. Putnam, who was appointed general manager 
of the department of anthropology, made most extended collections 
with this end in view. The result was most gratifying. Not only was

provision made for a museum at the new University of Cliieago, but 
the citizens, led by :\Ir. Field witli the munitieent «;ift of >=l!.(>0() 000, pro- 
vided for a great museum iu Jackson Park. To this will be attached 
a department of anthropology, including arts, physical anthropology, 
etlinology, and arcliiii'ology. The material is greater than that upon 
which any other institution of the kind was ever founded. Other 
museums in the United States were greatly helped by the Exposition, 
the Peabody Museum in Cambridge, the I^^atural History Museum in 
Kew York, especially with the Emmons collection from southeast Alaska, 
the National Museum in Washington, and the collections in Philadel- 
phia. There were also many private cabinets formed and enriched from 
the same source. It is fair to say that anthropology in America has 
never before had its activities so stimulated and increased. 

The development of laboratories for anthropological study, research, 
and instruction is slow. Physical anthropological apparatus will be 
noted further on. But, there could scarcely be said to exist in the 
world prior to 1893 a single building or institution where the material had 
been set out to teach the whole history of mankind or the whole round 
of anthropological science. Therefore the assemblage of objects to illus- 
trate anthropology toward which the eyes of students turned in 1893, 
was the World's Columbian Exposition. The material ot the science 
manifested itself there in the following forms: 

(1) Representatives of living races in native garb and activities. 

(2) Things or objects connected with every phase of human life. 

(3) Pictorial representations of apparatus of life in action and repose. 

(4) Books and descriptive publications, throwing- light on man and 
of his inventions. 

These exhibits were under the following auspices: 

(1) The exposition authorities, under the lead specially of Prof. F. W. 
Putnam, aided by Prof. Sargent, Dr. Franz Boas, Dr. C. S. Wake, Miss 
Alice Fletcher, Mrs. Zelia Nuttall, Mr. Stuart Culiu, Mr. W. K. Moore- 
head, Dr. West, Mr. G. A. Dorsey, and a large corps of army and navy 
and civilian assistants who travelled especially over the countries 
involved in the Columbian period. 

{'2) The (rovernment of the United States, iu the Government build- 
ing especially installed by the Smithsonian Institution through the 
National Museum, the Bureau of Ethnology, and other Departments. 

(3) Foreign and home exhibitors, m. the foreign government build- 
ings, in the exhibits from abroad and from home through all the great 
public structures. 

(4) Concessionaires in the Midway Plaisance and also in the bazaars 
everywhere throughout the grounds. Indeed, it would not be too 
much to say that the World's Columbian Exposition was one vast 
anthropological revelation. Not all mankind were there, but either in 
persons or pictures their representatives were. 



606 SUMMARY OF PEOfiRESS IN ANTHROPOLOGY. 

Every teclinical, artistic, industrial thought that had ever entered 
luiman minds could be seen in their primitive or in their most eloquent 
expression. From the rude human habitations about the anthropo- 
logical building to the results of co-operative architectural dreams which 
constituted the White City, was a long way on the road of evolution in 
the builder's art. The same would be true of the arts of dress, adorn- 
ment, food, rest, transportation, manipulation, and manufacture, com- 
merce and exchange, heating and illumination, mechanics and mechan- 
ical forces. 

The forlorn savage woman depicted on the <loorway of the Transpor- 
tation building at one end of a series of weary burden bearers was in 
strange contrast with the spirituelle paintings of angels on the walls 
above her head. But this was only one of a series of transformations 
which made the Chicago Exposition the most imposing anthropological 
exhibit the world has ever seen. The financial panic that seized the 
world i)revented many thousands of scholars from stndying the exposi- 
tion and put back the science of man quite as nuich as it did his mate 
rial progress. 

Professor Putnam's dc^partment of the Plxposition included all sub- 
divisions of anthropology. It embraced (1) the ethnographical exhibition 
of native American peoples living in their native habitations on the 
grounds; (2) a general ethnographic exhibit in the building; (3) an 
archa'ological exhibit in the building and casts of ruins in Yucatan 
shown outside; (4) exhibit of aiu'ient religions, folklore, and games; 
(5) anthropological laboratories devoted to physical anthropology, crimi- 
nal anthropology, psychology, and neurology with apparatus and dia- 
grams; ((>) an anthropological library in all branches of the science. 

The anthropological exhibit of the Government was devoted (1) espe- 
cially to showing the relation of the material activities of North America 
to the linguistic classitication that had been recently completed; (2) to 
the exi)osition of the recent explorations made by Prof William H. 
Holmes in quarry sites of the aborigines in various portions of the 
Union. This was done in a most creditable manner; (3) a synoptical 
view of the early history of mankind from the earliest stone age to the 
first iron age, set out by Professor Thomas Wilson. 

Of great i)ublic interest among the foreign exhibits were the armor 
in the German village, the gold work from Colombia, the Turkish and 
theCairene bazaar, the Java village, the Samoan village, the Dahomey 
village, the Japanese and the Hindoo bazaars. Indeed, only an ex- 
tended catalogue will reveal the riches of the material. 

Current literature. — Very frequent inquiries are made by those who 
wish to look up some special question or to begin some new study in 
anthropology. It is no longer i)()ssible to prepare for this summary a 
creditable bibliogra])hy in the space assigned; but it is also not 
necessary. Students who have access to the following publications 



SUMMARY OF PROGRESS IN ANTHROPOLOGY. 607 

do not need any further lie)]) in following- up the literature of the 
science: 

(1) Tiie American AnthropoJoguij Washington; (juarterly; Judd & 
Detweiler, Extended bibliography on all studies relating to man. 

(2) The Index Mediciis and the Index Catalogue of the Surgeon-Gen- 
eral's Office, Washington, especially thorough in anthropo-biology. 

(3) The catalogues of the Literary Bureau, Boston. 

(4) Archiv fiir Antltropologie, Braunschweig-; quarterly. Most 
exhaustive lists, with short digests of books and papers. 

(5) MittheUungen der Anthropologlschen Gesellschaft in Wien. Full 
bibliographies. 

(6) Annuaire des Journanx, etc., Paris, 1892, 

Mr. G. W. Bloxam has placed anthro])ologists under lasting obliga- 
tions to hiiu by his printing a complete index to the publications of the 
Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland (1843-1891). 
This includes also the journal and transactions of the Ethnological 
Society of Loudon (1843-1871), the journal and memoirsof the Authro 
pological Society of London (1863-1871), the Anthropological Eeview, 
and the journal of the Anthropological Institute (1871-1891). 

OencraUiteratnre. — The literature of the world has become impregnated 
with anthropc^logy. Science, The American Naturalist, and especially 
The PoimJar Science Monthly, in America, give a large share of their 
pages to this topic. Nature, The Academy, The Athenanim, and all the 
great quarterlies of London; Revue Sciottifique in Paris; Globns and a 
host of other journals in Germany, are common carriers of the best 
kind which send weekly, monthly, and quarterly cargoes of information 
to intelligent readers. 

The gallery of anthropology is still in the future. At the World's 
Columbian Exposition, as mentioned, groups of lower races in costume 
were well set up, and photography was efficient in putting life into 
accounts of peoples inaccessible to the most of us. Gabriel de IMortillet 
has advocated the extension of the work of the camera, and im Thurn 
makes a good argument for its use in South America. 

There is no good guide to anthropological studies published in 
America. The reprint of the British Notes and Queries was a timely 
piece of work by the British association. 

ANTHROPO BIOLOGY. 

The sources of information concerning the biology of man are, first 
of all, the organs of the anthropological societies. In Germany and 
France far more attention is paid to craniology, measurement of the 
other parts of the body, the teeth, comparative anatomy of man and 
the lower animals, and greater stress is laid ui)on the importance of 
these studies. In England and the United States crauiological meas- 
urements are discounted. All the literature of this branch of the 
science may be sought in the bibliographies of Surgeon-General's

Anthropologist, Wasliiiigtoii; Archirfilr Anthiopolo</ie, Braunschweig; 
Mittheihmgen der Anfhropologischcn Gesellschaft in Wein. 

Dr. Brinton, in «SV/r/ur (February 24), enters a vigorous protest against 
tbemulti})lieation of jaw-breaking compounds of Greek roots to repre- 
sent diflereut cranial measurements and indexes. 

Craniologists baAC differed in opinion concerning tlie orientation of 
the skull for the puri)0ses of measurement. All agree tbat it should be 
set as in life where the owner is looking straight ahead. To set up 
the skull after death in the i)osition of the living head gazing at tbe 
horizon is the problem. Dr. Eugene Hirtz to this end has utilized tbe 
cadaver as an intermediary between the Hvrug and tbe skeleton, since 
tbe eye remains fixed in its orbit after death. Tbe paresis of the mus- 
cular system is then complete — the eyes are imn)obile. Tbe problem is 
to compare tbe visual axis of tbe cadaver with the plane of tbe cranium 
as used by the experimenter and with the gaze of the living fixed on 
the horizon. Tbe conclusion is that tbe ''orbital axis" of Broca is 
nearly parallel to the plane of the visual axes, or tbe so called horizon- 
tal plane of tbe living. {BuU. Soe. d'Antkrop. de Paris, 4 s., iv, 386-380.) 

Dr. Manouvrier, who bas devoted years to the study of 'the long bones 
of the human body, communicated to the Paris Anthropological Society 
a memoir on the morphological variations of the body of the femur in 
tbe human species. The conclusion reached is that pUitycnemy, retro- 
version of tbe bead of tbe tibia, and platymetry, seen in prehistoric 
remains, in savages, and among modern Europeans, do not represent 
anatomical survivals through atavism, but are all derived through 
physiological causes, allied to the kind of life and diflereut external con- 
ditions susceptible of exaggeration or modification. {Bull. Soc. d''An- 
throp. de Paris, 4 s., iv, 111-144.) 

MM. Azoulay and Regnault have made a comparison in the compar- 
ative form of the incisors of apes and the vaiious races of men. In 
tbe apes the outer enameled surface is wide amd shaped like a hoe, of 
the uncivilized races the edges are more nearly parallel, and in the 
civilized races they are quite so. Measures were taken of tbe length 
of the free border and of the side of tbe enamel and tbe difl'erence 
noted. The order of succession, as regards the elongation and rectan- 
gular form of the enamel, is: apes (chimpanzee and gorilla), negroes, 
New Caledonians, Australians, Polynesians, Javanese, Annamites and 
Cbiuese, Europeans, Indians, Bengalese. {Bull. iSoc. dWntkrop. de 
Paris, 4s., iv, 2G7-2C0.) 

Prof. Cope some years since aftirmed that the tubercular forms usual 
in the cusps of human molars point to a reversion to tbe lemurian 
dentition. In Anatomischer Anzeiger (No. 24, 1892), Dr. H. F. Osboru, 
of Columbia College, presents tbe result of his own researches, with 
a summary of other work, since Cope. The ])iimitive mammalian 
molar is a single cone, to whicb other cusps have been added, as 



SUMMARY OF PROGRESS IN ANTHROPOLOGY. 609 

inaiiy as six appearing in some primates. The luiman molar, there- 
lore, is a reversion to the leamrine type. Brinton allhrms that the study 
of these traits in racial anatomy h^is no definite result. 

Two essays in the Contemporary Review, by Mr. Herbert Spencer, on 
the insufficiency of "natural selection," were the occasion of many 
papers by anthropologists representing a variety of points of view. 
Notable among these should be read Cattell on Survival of the Fittest 
and Sensation Areas, 

Prof. Hartnmnn publislied the second part of his second volume on 
the anthroi)ological material in tbe Royal University at Berlin (Appen- 
dix to Arch. f. Anthrop., xxii, pt. 3). The classes treated are: Old 
Egyptian skulls; Guanches, of Tenerifte; Nigritians; modern Egyp- 
tians; Bantu, Kaffirs and Bechuana; Khoi-Khoi, or Hottentots; San, 
or Bushmen; Germans from the interior of Austria; Sloven; Finns. 

Ui)on the question of the color-sense among aborigines the experi- 
ments of Blake and Franklin among American Indians are valuable. 
It has been frequently affirmed that Indians do not know colors by 
name, but Gatschef s researches contradict this. At Haskel Institute 
four hundred and eighteen Indians of difl'erent tribes were tested, and 
only three cases of color blindness found to exist — two for red and one 
for green. These were males and all full blooded. This ratio of seven- 
tentlis of 1 per cent as comi)ared with 5-36 per cent in Switzerland and 
4-12 in Germany would seem to argue the diminution of the faculty of 
color in civilization. [Science, New York, June 2.) Dr. J. Ambialet has 
studied with great care the artificial deformation of the head called 
Toulousiau and pul)lished his results in Vantliropologie (Paris, IV, 11- 
27.) The paper is illustrated with many cuts, which add greatly to the 
clearness of the text. The people of Toulouse bandage the heads of 
their babies, and tliat compels the brain to grow out in other lines. 
These Toulousians are naturally short-headed, but by the eftects of 
the constrictions mentioned they come to be dolichocephalic or long- 
headed and tlic skulls to be elongated, oval, pitched up at the occiput, 
trapezoidal, bilobic, etc. 

The disastrous decrease of population in France has given rise to a 
national association termed "Congres de la repopulation de la France." 
This society held its session the current year in Paris, under the presi- 
dency of Dr. Gustav Lagneau. Questions discussed were, assistance to 
))oor children; protection to women with child; modifications of fiscal 
laws looking to increase of population; change of laws respecting 
illegitimates, etc. Resolutions denouncing war and advocating dis- 
armament were passed. 

The Marquis de Nadaillac has published a short ])aper {Science, Jan- 
uary 27) on the extrem(\s of heat aiul cold endured by man. The fol- 
lowing records in centigrade are (quoted: —

PHYSIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY. 

In the International Coiigress of Experimental Psychology, of 1892, 
reported in Mind, 1893, ii, 42-53, is printed a iiajier by Prof. A. Bain, 
on the respective spheres and mutual helps of introspection and psycho- 
physical experiment in psychology. The author still holds that intro- 
spection, or the self-consciousness of each individual working apart 
must si ill remain at the head of the resources for imparting to psychol- 
ogy a scientitic character. A few of the researches where both methods 
are applicable are: 

(1) The muscular mechanism, the primary instrument of our activ- 
ities for all purposes whatever, 

(2) The theory of the intellect as expressed by such terms as mem- 
ory, retentiveness, association, reproduction, and the like. 

(3) The momentary fluctuations of ideas in and out of consciousness. 
Many phrases have come into use in connection with it, such as 
"threshold" of consciousness, recency of impressions, area of con- 
sciousness, lapses of attention, etc. 

(4) The determination of the condition of permanent association or 
enduring memory, as against temporary or so-called "cram." 

Among the great issues now awaiting solution Prof. Bain places in 
the foreground plurality of simultaneous impressions in every one of 
the senses. Attached to it is the question of the operative power of 
impressions while momentarily standing aside from the conscious area. 
For these problems introspection needs to be helped out by experi- 
mentation, while the delicacy of tact in the self-conscious observer is 
also of the utmost importance. One of the most pregnant issues in 
the whole field of psychology is the swaying of tlie will by motives 
outside of pleasure and pain, otherwise called the " fixed idea." 

Until there is a more general agreement than at present on the 
analysis of the fundamentals of the intellect, it is premature to recom- 
mend a searching investigation into the working of similarity in diver- 
sity, on which hangs the inventive powers of the mind, Just as much 
as simple memory reposes the adhesion of conjunctions in time. For 
the present there is abundant scope for introspection in roaming over 
the accessible facts of psychical life. By the nature of the case the 
initiative in the more fruitful inquiries will be most frequently taken 
by introspection, which also by its powers of anal^'sis will still open 
the path to the highest generalities of our science.

Prof. Sally published au appeal to parents relative to studying the 
child-miud, of which the following is a brief: 

1. Atteution and observation. — Early attention and interest (in looking, touching, 
etc.) and gradually •widening observation. Exact as well as hasty observation. 

2. Memory. — Earliest recognition of persons. What is remembered best. Out-of- 
the-way facts, insignificant details, etc. Strength of verbal memory, new words 
introduced into a familiar story, and the like. 

3. Imagination and fancy. — Anthropomorphic fancy, child-myth, personifications 
of nature. How the unknown in sjiace and time is filled. Child-lies. Imagination 
interfering with observation and producing " illusions of sense." 

4. Reasoning. — First curiosity about the origin of things, himself, of the Deity, 
etc. Childish puzzles, things that seem strange and inspire thinking. Childish 
explanation. How it translates our explanations of things, puts its meaning into 
our words. 

5. First use of articulate sounds, characteristic omissions, alterations and trans- 
positions of sounds in repeating words. Order of acquiring sounds. Invention of 
new word-sounds. Original applications of common words. 

6. Pleasure and pain. — First manifestation of pleasure and displeasure (smiling, 
frowning, etc.). Instinctive and acquired likes and dislikes. Favorite .amusements. 

7. Fear. — First manifestation of fear — of the dark, of animals, of big moving 
things. Are they dne to instinct or to experience or suggestion? 

8. Self-feeling. — Self-pity, self-caressing, vanity, jealousy, property in toys, etc. 

9. Sympatliy, affection. — Early feelings toward auimals and human beings as bear- 
ing on the question of innate sympathy. Cruelty of children. 

10. Arlistio taste. — Special preferences for colors, forms, rhythms, melodies, etc. 
Ideas of Y>rettiness, grandeur, etc. First signs of laughter, or of a sense of the comical 
or ludicrous. 

11. Moral and religious feeling. — Earliest signs of respect for authority. First 
exercise of judicial function by the child in scolding or commanding others or him- 
self. First conception of right and wrong. Illustrations of feelings of justice in 
little children, of moral sensibility and of callousness. 

12. Volition. — Imitation of others in words, gestures, etc. Effect of other's verbal 
suggestion on childish action. Examples of self-will, of defiance of commands. 
Hesitation in acting and self-restraint. 

13. Artistic productions. — Spontaneous dramatic invention (make-believe i in play. 
Original manual construction (building, etc.). Invention of stories. First drawing 
of animals, men, etc. (Preserve examples.) Noticeable grades of progress in these. 

Prof. Scripture contributes sound advice to those who would take 
graduate instruction in psychology {Science., New York, July 28). The 
student must begin with knowing the methods of making experiments; 
this should be followed by careful work in the theory of measurements, 
treating of the probability integral, the mean variation, etc. One of 
the great differences between psychological and ijhysical measurements 
is that the conditions can not be controlled as in j)hysics; mean varia- 
tions are thus greater and the deductions from the results not the same. 
Psychological experiments resemble those taken once on each of a 
number of persons. The study of the methods of statistics has also to 
be made for the sake of mental statistics. The making of measure- 
ments brings in the study of fundamental and derived units and the 
construction of apparatus. The subject's touch, sight, hearing, etc., 
require a knowledge of the physical processes used in stimulation.

Hearing lectures will never make a ])sycliologist ; the fundamental 
course for all special instruction is the laboratory work. The student 
must be trained by repeated exercises in making the measurements 
explained in the lectures, including exercis<'s on touch, temperature, 
hearing, siglit, in the graphic method, chronometry, dynamometry, 
audiometry, photometry, colorimetry, etc. This should be followed 
by work in the construction of apparatus, elements of mechanical 
drawing, use of tools.

THE RACES OF MEN. 

In the United States the chief sources of publication on ethnological 
topics are: The reports and ])apers of the I'eabody Museum, in Cam- 
bridge; the Journals of the Hemenway Southwestern Expedition; the 
transactions of the American Philosophical Society ; but, most extended 
of all, the reports aud bulletins of the Bureau of Ethnology, and the pub- 
lications of the Smithsonian Institution and of the National Museum. 

xVbroad the study is stimulated in a multitude of ways. The 
Anthropological Institute of (Ireat Britain and Ireland is specially 
strong in this line of study through its colonial attachments. Besides 
this society, the Colonial Museum, tlie British Museum, the I^oyal 
Asiatic Society, flood the world with good literature, especially con- 
cerning the Eastern Hemisphere. Branches of these great societies 
are established in JJombay, Calcutta, Hongkong, Shanghai, Sydney, 
Wellington, publishing also literature on ethnology. 

Interest in the study of ethnology is kept alive in France partly by 
bringing to the city of Paris families and groups of colonial natives. 
In the Palais des Arts liberaux, Champs de Mars, was oj)ened in 1893 
an exposition of colonial African ethnology. Besides one hundred aud 
thirty Dahomoans, rei)resentatives of the Ogowe, Whydah, Godome,

Cotoiioii, Porto Novo, Allada, Savi, and Abomey peoples, were exhibited 
iu native dress and habitations, working at their national trades. The 
chief source of information is V Anthropologies Paris, in w^hich excellent 
reviews of tlie literature of the subject will be found. 

Every German city has an ethnographic nniseum. In Berlin, Dr. 
Bastian, with a competent force, has charge of the great Museum ftir 
yiilkerkunde and in Dresden Dr. A. B. Meyer has his home. The 
ZeitschHftfiiriJthnologie, Berlin, is a kind of diary or merchant's blotter, 
giving information concerning ethnological material as it conies to hand, 
to be journalized and posted up later on. The publications of the Dres- 
den Museum on the Melanesian islanders are works of great merit. 

In Holland the Internationales Archiv fiir Ethnologie is published at 
great expense by J. D. E. Schmelz, with colored lithographic plates. 
The work of Italian ethnologists must not be overlooked, especially in 
Central Africa. The Arehivio per V Antropologia <U Firenze, organ of the 
Societa di Antroj)ologia, is the medium of imblication. 

Interest in the study of Etruscan origins still continues. Apropos of 
Dr. Brinton's suggestion that this people are to be classed with the 
Libyans, Prof. Giuseppe Sergi, of Rome, announces in Nuova Anto- 
logia, September, 1893, that from the side of physical anthropology this 
is true. In this connection should be read Dr. Kleinschmidt's refer- 
ence of the Etruscans to the Aryan stock, nearest to Lithuanian and 
Lettish and GaetanoPolari's comparison of the same language with the 
Basque. 

Dr. Zograf has studied the ])eople of Great and Little Russia. They 
are not homogeneous, but result from the mixing of Slavo- Lithuanians 
and LTralo-Altaic elements. The people of Little Russia differ slightly 
from province to province in costume and manners. The region of the 
steppes which extend between the Carpathian and the Don has been 
l)eopled by colonies from diverse sources, by Great and Little Russians, 
Bulgarians, Servians, Moldavians, and Geimans. The Nogais Tartars 
are cantoned in the Crimea. {IjAntJiropoIogie, Paris, IV, 228.) 

Dr. Braislin has studied the human nasal canal as an ethnological 
characteristui with reference to the viability of the white and negro 
race in the same area. He thinks that the wider, shorter, and shallower 
canals in the negroes account for their being more subject to pulmonary 
diseases and that they present characteristics specially adapted forpre- 
jiaring the inspired air of a tropical climate for reception into the lung 
structures. {Hcience, New York, March 31.) 

Dr. Felix von Luschan, of Berlin, finds in the modern Jews, descend- 
ants of three different races, the Hittites, the Aryan Amorites, and 
the Semitic nomads, who immigrated into Syria about the time of 
Abraham. {Seience, New York, January 12.)

An excellent review of this work is in Arehiii f. Anthropolof/ie (xxii, 
31()-;}27). 

The Khniers, of Cambodia, have been studied by Dr. Maiirel, and 
the results of his investigations are made known in one of the Memoires 
(le la Societe cVAnthropolor/ie de Far is. They are the easternmost branch 
of the Aryan stock arriving from India with their native culture and 
have become mixed with various other strains. 

The publishers of V Anthropoloyie have brought together the papers 
of Br. Eitel upon the Hak-ka (Paris, iv, 129-181), the general title of 
the Chinese inhabiting the province of Canton. These peojile have 
spread themselves throughout Indo China. With diverse elements 
that are mutually antagonistic, they seem to be bound together by a 
common interest. The population of Canton is as mixed as was that 
of England after the Norman conquest. The Miao-tse aborigines have 
been corralled in the mountainous districts to the northwest by a 
migrating people, who came to occupy the entire i^rovince and who 
entitled themselves the Aborigines (Pun-ti). Later, these had to 
defend themselves successively against two other invaders of different 
race. These last are the Hak-ka and the Tchao-Tcheow or Hok-lo. 
The last named prefer the water and the Hak ka the land. Both peo- 
ples came from the northwest, one following the waters, the other the 
mountains. The monograi)h of Dr. Eitel is devoted to the Hak-ka, 
their ethnography and history. 

Dr. IMichaut has published a work on the A'inos. As was often 
pointed out, these people are neither Mongol nor Japanese, but 
approach astonishingly the Eussian Moujik and are probably an aber- 
rant branch of the white race. They are remarkably pure in blood, and 
may foreshadow the coming of the Eussian to the Pacific coast to claim 
their own. The language is absolutely special, but approaches the 
Mantchoo in phrase and syntax. (Bull. Soc. (VAnlhroi). de Paris, 4. s., 
IV, 250-2G3.) 

The greatest interest now centers in the ethnology of northeastern 
Asia outside the question of the identity of the present peo];)les with 
those of America. The Kamchatkans, Ghiliaks, Koriaks, Yukaghirs, 
and others are supposed to be the remnants of the aborigines of north- 
ern Asia and even of the Japanese Isles. The studies of Schlegel in 
Chinese, of Morse in the shell heaps of Japan arc thought to be con- 
firmatory of this. The arts of these small people agree in many respects 
with those of the Hyperborean Americans. 

I^ew light is thrown upon the African pigmies by the researches of 
Stuhlmann, an associate of Emin Bey. In stature they average 1-25 



SUMMARY OF PROGRESS IN ANTHROPOLOGY. 615 

meters. They are very prognatliic and l>raehyeeplialic and the eoh^r is 
brown or reddish yellow rather than blaek. Stuhlmann looks upon the 
pigmies as relies of a peculiar variety of our species that once extended 
over Africa and parts of Asia. Dr. Brinton however, iu a lecture 
before tlie Washington Anthropological Society aftiruied that the size 
of these people had been brought about through degeneration. 

Mr. G. F. Scott Elliot, at the end of his notes on native West African 
customs, has the good Judgment to give a catalogue of the tribes on the 
upper Zambesi, with names, geographical locations, and definite posi- 
tion by latitude and longitude. [J. Anthrop. IriMt., xxiii, 85.) 

Br. Karl Sai)per publishes in I*eiermann''s MitfheiliDif/en a short 
account of the ethnography of Guatemala. The languages at i)resent 
spoken or formerly used are : 

1. Tbo Pipil of Salama. 11. Aguacatec. 

2. The Pipil of Comapa. 12. Jacalteca.

The second part of the paper relates to culture, and especial attention 
is given to the varieties of habitations,* and an excellent map accom- 
panies, showing in color the location and spread of each language. 

Tlie Tierra del Fiiegians received more than their share of attention 
in a monograph published in the Archip fur AnthropoJogie (Braun- 
schweig, XXII, 155-218, figs, and tables). These islanders are given 
under three stocks. 

(1) Ona (Wua; Jacana Kunny of Fitzroy; Aonik of Brinton) iu the 
east. 

(2) Jahgau (Jagan or Japoos or Tekenika of Fitz Eoy) in the south. 
(.3) Alakaluf (Alekoolip) in the vSouthwest. 

In every kind of cranial measurement these i)eoplesHare compared 
with one another and with the rest of mankind. The author comes to 
the long deferred conclusion that the Fuegians resemble Europeans 
most and came from that continent. 

The Polynesian Society of Wellington, New Zealaiul, takes up the 
problem of the Oceanic races with great vigor, publishing a quarterly 
journal. jSTecessarily the great majority of papers are in the grai)hic 
rather than in the logic stage, as should be. Papers of general value 
are: On Savage Island, E, Tregear and J. M. Ossmond; Asiatic origin 
of Oceanic numerals, E. Best; Asiatic gods iu the Pacific, E. Tregear; 
Relationship of Malayan languages, T. L. Stevens, and many communi- 
cations ou the Maories.

61G SUMMARY OF PROGRESS IN ANTHROPOLOGY. 

The Solomon islanders are in the midst of a series of archipelagoes 
whose population is often called melanoid or negroid. The studies of 
Hagen lead to the conclusion that there is not here an unicjue type 
{V Anthropologies Paris, iv, 215). Emigrants from the west, Malays and 
Polynesians, or Malayo-Polynesians, according to the linguists, have 
continually arrived there, following the currents and the winds, and 
have profoundly modi lied the older elements, creating leally a Melano- 
Polynesian type. 

GLOSSOLOGY. 

In the American Anthropologist (vi, 381-407) Messrs. Hewitt and 
Borsey attack Duponceau's theory of polysynthesis in the Indian lan- 
guages. Mr. Hewitt is a learned Iroquois, and Dr. Dorsey is as familiar 
with Siouan languages as with his own. The former says: "The 
materials of the language of the Iroquois consists of notional words — 
nouns, verbs, adjectives; representative words — prefixive and inde- 
pendent pronouns; relational words — adverbs, conjunctions, and suftix- 
ive prepositions; and derivative elements, formatives and tlexions." 
The distinctive nature and characteristic functions of these elements 
can not be changed at will by any speaker. In the category of notional 
words noun stems may not indifterently assume the functions of verb 
stems or adjective stems. The comi»ound stems of word sentences may 
become parts of speech when the linguistic sense has conie to regard 
the separate meanings of the elements thus combined. This is para- 
syuthesi.s. In the Iroquoiau speech all the developments of the lan- 
guage expressed by the terms, word-sentence, stem-formation, and 
indection are based primarily on the well-known princijde of juxtaposi- 
tion and a more or less intimate fusion of elements, but the living and 
traditional usage of the language has established the following mor- 
phothetic canons: 

(1) The simple or compound stem of a notional word or of a word- 
sentence may not be employed isolatedly without a prefixed simple or 
complex personal pronoun or a gender sign or llexion, 

(2) Only two notional stems may be combined in the same word- 
sentence, and they must be of the same part of speech. 

(3) The stem of a verb or adjective maybe combined with the stem 
of a noun, and the stem of the verb or adjective nuist be placed after 
and never before the noun stem. 

(4) An adjective stem may not be combined with a verb stem, but it 
may unite with the formative auxiliary tha', to cause or male, and Avith 
the inchoative 5. 

(5) A qualificative or other word or element may not be interposed 
between the two combined stems of notional words, nor between the 
simple or compound notional stem and its simi)le or complex pronominal 
prefix, derivative and formative change being effected oidy by prefixing

or suffixing suitable tiexioiis and foriuatives to the forms fixed by the 
foregoing- canons. 

Dr. Washington Matthews, reviewing the new edition of the Riggs 
Dalofa (licfioHory, published by the Smithsonian Institution as Vol. 
IV of Contributions to Knowledge, pays a just tribute to the original 
work and its author. Great and worthy praise is bestowed upon the 
Rev. J. Owen Dorsey for tlie editorial supervision of the new volume, 
and the reviewer says that tlie improvements are largely dialectic*. This 
shows how thoroughly the jtioneer members of the Dakota mission did 
their scholarly work [Am. Anthroj)., Wash., VI, 96). 

The question of the phoneticism of the Maya is reviewed by Cyrus 
Thomas in the American Anthropologist (Washington, vi, 241-270), who 
says that their ideographic character is maintained by Forstemaun, 
Schellhas, Seler, and Valentini; their i)honetic character by Chareucy, 
de Rosny, and Thomas, and an intermediate ground is assumed by 
Brinton, who gives to them the name ikonomatic. 

A substantial contribution to the extension of ethnology through 
linguistics has been made by Rev. J. Owen Dorsey in a paper before 
the Madison meeting of the American Association proving that the 
Biloxis, a tribe on the southern border of Louisiana, belong to the 
Siouan or Dakotan linguistic s!ock. This family is now traced along the 
western side of the ^lississippi River from the gulf to its source, through- 
out the entire drainage of the JMissouriand the Arkansas and along the 
eastern slopes of the Appalachians from Washington city to central 
South Carolina. 

Ul)on the study of American native languages abroad. Dr. Brinton 
draws attention to a report on American lingnistics made at a confer- 
ence in Madrid by Don Francisco de Fernandez y Gonzalez and luinted 
by the Athen;T3um. In the Anales de la JJrdversidad, of Santiago, 
Chile, is a i)aper entitled, " La linguistica Americana, su historia y su 
estado actual,'' by Diego Barros Arana and Rodolfo Lenz. 

A valuable addition to the resources of Mexican archaeology is Dr. 
Seler's publication with textual explanation of Humboldt's collection of 
maguey paintings. In the city of Mexico, in 1803, Humboldt purchased 
sixteen hieroglyphic paintings collected by Boturini Beuaducci, 1740, 
confiscated by the Government and phiced in the hand of Leon da 
Gama to study. In 180G these paintings were presented to the Ber- 
lin Royal Library and there they remained until in 1888, they were 
exliibited to the Congress of Americanists. Photograpliic facsimiles 
were published by the Royal Library as a gift to the Columbus Cen- 
tennial. 

But the remainder of Boturini's collections were scattered and lost 
sight of nearly a hundred years, until M. Aubin, 1830-1840, with assid- 
uous care gathered them and took them to Paris. Fifty years hmger 
they were kept with miserly cu'cumsi)ection from inquisitive eyes 
until M. Eugene Goupil bought them and placed them in the hands 
of M. Bobau to catalogue. Already a v'olume has appeared entitled,

Documents imur servir a VHistoirc (hi Mexiqucj piiblislied by Leronx. 
Dr. Ihintoii furnislios iu Science (Marcli 10) a good account of the mate- 
rial, and says that all that has been previously written about Mexico 
has no more im])ortanee than the histories of Egypt, composed before 
the decipherment of the hieroglyphics. 

In Science Dr. Cresson shows the method pursued by him in his 
attempt to analyze the Maya hieratic and demotic scrii)t by the pho- 
netic elements of which it is composed. The Maya graphic system 
seems to be based upon a primitive ideographism, the elements derived 
from natural and artificial motives. These symbols received phonetic 
meanings. This representation of ideas or words by pictures, whole 
or abbreviated, Dr. Brintou calls the iconomatic stage of writing. 
Both Mexican and Maya were of this character. The Maya especially 
had gotten beyond it toward the higher stage. {Science, ^ew York, 
December 15.) 

Canon Isaac Taylor, reviewing a paper of von der Gabelentz on the 
probable connection between Basque and Berber speech, says: "We 
may adhere to the old conclusion that in the more essential points the 
aftinities of the Basque are with the languages of the Ural-Altaic class, 
which are totally different from the Berber languages, which belong 
rather to the Eamitic fam ily. [Acad, 1893, July 20.) 

Since the appearance of Horatio Hale's paper on the possibility of 
inventing language, nuich has been written on child language, Clark 
University, at Worcester, has taken up the matter seriously of making 
a collection of the secret languages of children, of which the old time 
"hog Latin" is only one example. 

TECHNOLOGY. 

The divisions of primitive technology, out of which all useful human 
enterprises spring, are the following: 

(1) The study of materials, their qualities and geographical distribu 
tion. 

(2) The study of the forces of nature, power of man, beast, wind, 
water, elasticity of rigid substances and gases, electricity, — as they 
have been subdued and put to work by man. 

(3) Tools, utensils, apjjaratiis, the study of their working parts, 
their manual and operative parts, their attachments and consequent 
machines. 

(4) Mechanics, the gradual working out of the inclined plane, lever 
roller, wheel and axle, pully, screw, and the like, for the conversion of 
time, directitm of motion, resistance, one into another. 

(5) The processes of work, the manner in which the operations of an 
industry have been carried on from beginning to end. 

(0) The products of the arts in their designs, structures, functions, 
and influence on the whole body of human industry. 
The round through which all these activities go is: 



SUMMARY OF PROGRESS IN ANTHROPOLOGY. 619 

(1) Exploitation of the euitli for raw material iu its three kiugdoiiis; 
and in the case of plants and animals, increasing the snpply through 
domesticatiou and cultivation. 

(2) The application of tools and power to these substances so as to 
convert them into forms to gratify human desire or to meet human 
needs. 

(3) The transfer of the material in any stage of its mani]>ulation from 
place to idace, on men, beasts, uagons, ships (u- trains, called trans- 
portation and travel. 

(4) The buying and selling of commodities involving weighing, meas- 
uring, and valuing, or weights, measures, and money, the development 
of the middle man, the wholesale merchant, the retail merchant, the 
broker, the banker, etc. 

(5) The consumption of the ultinuite product and all the utensils and 
customs involved therein. 

Each one of these operations in its historic elaboration involves the 
growth of the areas involved from the smallest territory occupied by 
a self supporting tribe to the occupation of the entire earth as a single- 
culture area. It also includes the differentiation of labor among men, 
giving to every man a greater diversity of thought and action in each 
operation, and requiring at the same time the cooperation of a greater 
number of men as specialists to accomplish the same kind of work. To 
unfold all arts of all peoples in all time and gather them into a single 
system of technic life is the purpose of technologic science. 

The effect of the earth on arts is techno-aeographij ; the effect of races 
on arts is ethnotechnography, and from each point of view that gives a 
different motive to studying man, the arts of life are classified on dift'er- 
erent concepts. 

Nowadays every trade has its journal, and the jiublishers never lose 
an opportunity to explain and illustrate the evolution of their craft. 
Thii Journal of the ^Society of Arts, hondoi^, is the first publication to 
consult upon this topic. 

Mr. E. H. Man gives an account of the technique of the Nicobar pot- 
tery {J. Anthrop. Inst., xxiii, 21-27). The manufacture is confined to 
one small island named Chorora, and the entire work of preparing the 
clay and molding and firing the pots has to devolve on the women of 
the community. It is related that a Chorora woman, while visiting 
another island, attempted to make a cooking pot, but she paid the pen- 
alty with her life. Clay at Chorora having been exhausted, material 
must be had from other ishinds, demanding a sea trip of a few miles. 
The duty of procuring the clay and the sale of the finished articles 
devolves on the men. (Compare Holmes and Cushing, An. Rep. Bur. 
Ethnol.) 

Having prepared a quantity of clay by freeing it from small stones 
and other extraneous matter, and having kneaded it witli fine sand 
until of a proper consistency, the operator seated herself on the ground 
and placed before her a piece of board on which she laid a ring or hoop

about 8 iiiclies in diiiiueter made of cocoaiuit leaves neatly bound 
together. This served as a stand for a shallow dish, in Avhich was 
placed a circular ]>iece of plantain leaf to facilitate the handling of 
the clay and preventing its adhesion to the unsized platter. With one 
or more haiidfuls of clay, according to the size of the pot, the base of 
the utensil Avas loughly shaped on the dish: then rolls of clay of the 
required thickness and previously ]»repared were l)uilt up layer after 
layer until the pro])er dimensions had been attained; the operator, 
the while turning the pot round and round, shaping it with her eye 
and hand. The vessels are set aside on a raised jilatform to dry for 
one or two days, according to the size of the pot and the state of the 
weather. When dry it is taken from the platform, superfluous clay 
on the inside scraped off with a Cyrena shell, and the excess of material 
on the outside removed by means of a fine strip of bamboo moistened. 
The hands of the potter moistened are gently passed over the inner and 
outer surfaces of the vessel to smooth them. The rim is finished ofl with 
the bamboo strip. For firing a primitive kiln is prepared in some open 
space near the hut, and bits of broken pottery are stuck in the ground a 
few inches apnrt to serve as a stand. Under the pot a layer of fine wood 
ashes and a quantity of cocoanut shells and scraps of firewood are 
heai)e(l uj) and a wheel-like object larger than the pot is laid on its 
ui)turned base; against this are laid l)ranches and firewood, which are 
to be lighted outside the vessel but are not to come in contact with it. 
The fuel is kindled and the flame fanned, if necessary, by two or three 
women, who, armed with sticks in both hands, act as stokers until the 
vessel is baked. It is removed with the sticks and left to cool upon a 
bed of fine sand, where it receives the necessary black stripes. The 
l)ainting is accom]»lished by means of strips of unripe cocoanut husk 
1 to 2 inches broad, laid on the pot while hot. The stain produced by 
the acid Juice turns black in a moment. To save her fingers from 
being burnt the artist keeps the i)ot in jwsitiou by means of a cocoa- 
nut-shell cup. The entire surface is then rubbed with moist strips of 
iiusk to give a light copper color to the whoh» surface. Makers' marks 
are added and the whole is completed. 

The study of maize is the study of a large number of American 
Indian tribes. h]thnologists will therefore be grateful to Dr. J. W. 
Harshberger for his monograph on the origin and distribution of maize 
in America. The origin of the plant is sought in the highlands of 
IMexico, south of the twenty-second degree of north latitude. From 
this source it got into the United States by two routes, through northern 
Mexico and through the West Indian Islands, It was carried to South 
America by the Isthmus of Pananm, extending, according to Brinton, 
along the great Andean system until it reached the Gran Chaco, where 
we find the native tribes, no way related to the Kechuas of Peru, bor- 
rowing its name from these people. South American words for maize

duced to this arehi[)elag(» from the southern continent. 

Even in our day the Mexicans excel in feather mosaics, some beauti- 
ful exami)les of which are to be seen at the National IMuseum. But in 
l)re-C'oluml)ian times more attention still was i»aid to snch matters. Of 
this we have evidence in the beautiful examples lately brought to light. 
Mrs. Nuttall, at the World's Congress of Arclneology, presented 
colored sketches of a great number, and Dr. Seler resumed the subject. 
{Zischr.f. Ethnol,^ Berlin, xxv, 44.) 

M. Adrien Mortillet, in a classification of weapons of offense, bases his 
subdivisions upon the relation of the action to the hand, (1) held in the 
hand, (2) working by means of something held in the hand, or (3) thrown 
from the hand. Each oue of the classes of bruising, slashing, and 
piercing weapons may again be thus subdivided. The Africans have 
developed the slashing projectile in two forms, the bladed arrow and 
the thrown knife or trumbash. M. Dybowski read a paper before the 
Paris Anthropological Society upon the last-named weapon. {Bull. 
Soc. (VAnthrop. de Paris, 4. s., iv, 07-100.) 

Mr. J. D. McGuire, in the American Anthropologist (Washington, VI, 
307-320), attacks the division of the stone age into paleolithic and neo- 
lithic from a new point of view. Unwittingly archseologists have got- 
ten into the habit of calling chipped stone by the former and battered 
and ground stone by the latter title. Mr. McGuire clearly shows that 
battering stoKC is easier and therefore may be older than the chipping 
art. He shows that among the best-known writers there is no unanim- 
ity of opinion as to the status of the chipped-stone age, and avers that 
the weight of authority is against the existence of any considerable 
period of time in which man lived either in Europe or America, when 
his only imi)lemenfcs were those that were chipped. 

The evidences of extensive prehistoric irrigation are found in Ari- 
zona. Mr. F. Webb Hodge brings them together in the American 
AnthropoUxjist (Washington, vi, 323-330). In the valleys of the Sal- 
ado and the (xila, in southern Arizona, the ancient inhabitants engaged 
in agriculture by artificial irrigation to a vast extent. The princijial 
canals constructed and used by the ancient inhabitants of the Salado 
Valley controlled the irrigation of at least 2o0,0U0 acres. The outlines 
of at least 150 miles of ancient main irrigating ditches may be readily 
traced, some of which meander southward from the river a distance of 
14 miles. 

From nuiny hundreds of scattered sources Dr. Max Bartels has gath- 
ered the jiterature of the world upon the history of medicine among 
l)rimitive peoples. It is not generally noticed that sav^ages have a 
l)ractice of medicine and surgery, notwithstanding their theory refers 
every disease to spirit influences. Indeed, there are in most tribes, 
besides the medicine man, wise women and men who give themselves 
1o the cure of disease by medicine and wounds by treatment. The

then discusses separately: (1) Tlie phenomena and means of sickness;

useful to turther study. 

Upon the question of the settlement of America the author of this 
summary at the World's Congress of Anthropology in Chicago took the 
ground that the peopling of the American Continent from Asia is the 
only hypothesis tenable upon present data. There never was known 
to history a day in which commerce was not going on. Asiatic species 
of animals have migrated in the present epoch. A series of land- 
locked seas lie on a great circle from the Indian Ocean to Vancouver 
Island. These seas abound in the best food products of the world. 
Winds are favorable, oceanic movements are favorable, climate is 
favorable. 

It is easier now to follow the currents of the ocean and the trade winds 
than it is to oppose them. Indeed, one of the advanced movements of 
civilization was in so doing. But the first migrants did not venture into 
the great aerial and oceanic currents. They remained on the shallow 
and land-locked water, where the food was most abundant and the 
danger least. Migration could have derived much momentum from 
the vis a fcrgo, applied by hostile men or favoring winds and currents. 
But we must look for the strongest motive in the active desires for food, 
defense, shelter, adventure, etc. 

.ESTHOLOGY OR THE SCIENCE OF BEAUTY. 

The arts of pleasure are now studied on the side of technical evolu- 
tion or elaboration. The forms and colors of art objects are derived 
from natural objects oi- from other art objects of a simpler culture stage. 
The departures from the lines of nature are referred to the Avant of 
skill in the aitist, the want of vision or imagination, and the technical 
limitations or least-resistance lines of the material. 

As in the evolution of the industrial arts, the invention, the inventor, 
and the public want grow and are dwarfed co-ordinately, so in the fine 
arts. The best illustration of the union of minds in one complicated 
sesthetic effect the world has ever seen was the buildings of the Chicago 
Exposition. The union of the plans of a dozen geniuses of structure 
and decoration formed a kind of artist trust or combine, the last step 
in the synthesis of the ])eautiful. 

The charm of this artistic climax was enhanced by the presence on 
the grounds and in the buildings of all forms of art — textile, fictile, 
coloring, graphic, glyphic, tonic, landscape, and architectural. These

represented the i)r(»j4res,s of taste — national taste, savage taste, barhaiie 
taste, historic taste, woven togetlier like a 1)eantilnl tapestry. 

In a former suunnary was given th(^ tabulated form of weapons and 
tools adopted by M. Adrien de Mortillet in his lectures before the Ecole 
d' Anthropologic. The course in I8O0 was devoted to dress and adorn- 
ment, their history and diversities, considered in relation to parts of 
the body. Adornment followed the parts of the body, as follows: 

Jewelry of the head — crowns, diadem^, and frontlets. Jewelry of 
the ears — drops, pendants, and studs. Nose jewels, inserted in the 
septum or alae. Labrets, pelele, botoque, bezote, and labrets. Teeth 
jewelry. Neck jewelry, neck rings, collars, torques. Shoulder and 
breast jewelry, epaulets and gorgets. Waist decoration, bandstiexible 
and rigid. Decoration of the lower part of the body. Arm jewels, 
armlets, bracelets. Finger jewelry. Leg decorations, leglets and ank- 
lets. Foot jewelry. Jewelry of the clothing. {Krv. McnsneJle, ui, 91).) 

No journal or nuigazine is devoted to this kind of study of compara- 
tive art and the natural history of art. The work of Henry Balfour 
on the evolution of decorative art and the papers of Holmes in the 
reports of the Bureau of Ethnology may be taken as text-books. 

SOCIOLOGY. 

The comparative history of society is nowadays studied in the fol- 
lowing aspects: 

(1) The family group, or really the groups of human beings that 
stand around the mother and child, their number and duration. 

(2) The governmental group, involving the structure and actions of 
hordes, tribes, confederacies, states, nations, and international agree- 
ments. 

(3) The industrial group, conunonly called guilds, unions, boards of 
trade, chambers, for mutual offense and defense in business. 

(4) Social groups, for mutual entertainment, help, culture, etc. 

(o) Religious groups, studied in the comparative science of religions. 

Th<^ United States in addition to its govenunental assemblies under- 
takes the study of the combinations of men as laborers and as business 
men. 

Every university has a school of political and social science, and in 
Philadelphia is published the journal devoted to that subject with 
extended bibliographers. The Johns Hopkins University school issues 
series of studies of great value. A section of the American Associa- 
tion is devoted to economics in the widest sense of the term. All 
periodicals are tilled with sociology; it is the most attractive of all 
scientitic hobbies. 

MYTHOLOGY AND FOLK-LORE. 

Prof. Caird detines religion to be ''man's ultimate attitude toward 
the universe.'" But, in trying to arrange a number of objects in accord-

ance with tliis detiiiitiou it would be iiet'essaiy tiirtlier to explain its 
verbal elements.* 

Religion, as it enters the field of comparative or scientific stndy, is 
what men think concerning a spirit world and what they do in pursu- 
ance of such thinking. The thoughts of a spirit world involve the fol- 
lowing questions: 

(1) Its location and physiography, systems of cosmogony. 

(2) Its peoples, their forms, origins, lives, thoughts, sayings, etc. 

(3) Its government, including its entire social system. 

(4) Its relation to this world. 

The operative side of religion, or the cult, includes also 
(1) The place of worship and its fittings in all their details. 
(L*) The organization of society on the basis of religion and the place 
of each individual in the system. 

(3) The conduct in and with respect to the holy place, including 
prayer, sacrifice, fasting, incense, music, decorations, feasts, preaching. 

(4) Piety or everyday conduct toward the gods, especially the con- 
duct of the laity. 

(5) Sacred books or what took their place in more primitive society. 
The Musee des Religions, or the Guimct Museum in Paris, i)ublishes 
La Revue des Religious and special monographs. 

For American religions study the w^orks of Brinton, Boas, Dorsey, 
Powell. 

At a meeting of the Anthropological Society of Washington the sub- 
ject of breaking vases deposited with the dead Avas discussed. Mr. 
Cushing said that formerly the notion at the basis of the custom was 
to kill the vessel and send its spirit to dwell with the owner in the 
other wM)rld. In modern times the custom also was a precaution 
against gra\e robbers. Prof. N. G. Poletis, of the University of 
Athens, works out the study of breaking vessels as a funeral rite of 
modern Greece. Vessels either specially detlicated to the deceased or 
having been used at funeral rites are broken at the grave. Fragments 
of vases have been discovered on the Bathron, at the upper opening 
of tombs at Myceiue; huge heaps of potsherds are found at old Alex- 
andria, Greek, Egyptian, and Roman, belonging to various epochs. 
The present Greek custom is to break clay vessels upon the grave, and 
also as the remains ])ass out in front of the dead man's house. Some- 
times the same thing goes on along the whole road following the 
funeral. While the priest pronounces the words: "Dust thou art and 
unto dust slialt thou return,'' he pours water upon the grave from a 
vessel specially brought for the purpose. This done the vessel is 
instantly broken while the priest fiings with it upon the grave a hand- 
ful of earth. (J. Anihrop. I))st., xxiii, L'8-41.)

The fifth annual nu^eting of the American Folklore Society was 
held in Montreal, September 13. The society was incorporated, and 
mensurcs taken to publish si)ecial monographs. The papers by Heli 
Chatelain on the retarded development of African civilijcation, by W, 
W. Newell on the material and objects of folklore, and by Adolf Ger- 
ber on P>rer Rabbit, a comi)arative study, were of especial value. 

ARCHyEOLOGY. 

Dr. .Mori/ Hoernes lays down with great care the fundamental prin- 
cii)lcs of a system of study and instruction in prehistoric arclKeology, 
of which the following is the scheme: 

A. — i)i;i-iNni-oN. 

1. The it'hitiou of prehistory to history and to tho historical tstudy of aiiti(|uitif8. 

2. The place of prehistory iu the syllabus of anthropology, its relatiou to jjliysical 

anthropology and ethnology. 

H. — ANALYSIS. 

1, Propa'deutics. 

a. History of the science. 

b. Study of resources. 

(I. Literary sources, both direct and indirect. 

h. Monuments (attention. 1, to the topographic and, 2, rauseographic order, 
by means of examining h)calities and handling the objects). Classitica- 
tion of objects, both on the natural history and the archaeological con- 
cept. 

c. Criticism and explanation. 

2, Systematic representation. 

a. Fundamental factors: Culture areas and groups of mankind. 

b. Development factors: Invention, borrowing, remodeling, transmitting. 

c. Separate forms or classes: Language, religion, jurisprudence, the family, the 

state, the house, and the hearth; food, clothing, ornament, weapons, 
tools, industries, trade, navigation, art, etc. 

3, Typological repreisentatiou: Forms of dwelling places, industrial places, forti- 

ficatious, religious iuclosures, cemeteries, depots, filso apparatus, with 
their fuuctiou aiul (levplopmeot,

1). Culture history : Iiitfllecrual tloiuination of men over auimals, tertiary times,

ar<lia'oh)gy and the inlluence of its historic culture stages npon prehis- 
toric Europe; first appearanceof later jieopies of Europe in their his- 
toric se<ineuce. 

The year 189.'5 ntai ks an epoch in Ameiieaii aicliivology and divides 
students into two shai'i)ly separated schools. Th(^ older school believes 
m the existence of i)aleolitliic man in the United States, the new 
school does not. In the presence of such sites as Trenton, the former 
discovers geological evidence of the very great antiquity of man in the 
occurrence of rudely cliipjied objects in sitK, the other school says 
these objects are in the talus and have rolled down from the surface 
above. The old school says, but these pieces are very rude and have 
uacred surfaces. Men used very rude or paleolithic tools first, and 
after that came the fineriinished tools. The new school says these 
pieces are the rubbish, the rejected mass of stone knappers. They are 
quarry refuse, and not tools at all. Many hundreds of thoustmds of 
them have been picked up in the wcu'kshops of the modern Indians. 
Mr. Vv'illiam 11. Holmes, of the lUireaii of Ethnology, made most of the 
diggings by which this oi»inionis substantiated. 

In a i)aper by lloimes on the distribution of stone implements in the 
tide water portions of Maryland and Virginia, the author has in view 
the whole history of each stone implement, from the source of the raw 
material to the finding of the specimen where it finally left the hand of 
the savage. He speaks of the origin and form of the stone, the pro- 
cesses of manufacture, the rejection at the source of the stone of all 
pieces tried and found wanting, the transportation, the caching or stor- 
ing, the specialization of form in after work and the uses or functions. 
Four inaterials were used for chipped tools, (piartzite bowlders, quartz 
pebbles, rhyolite quarried in the mass, jasper quarried in the mass. Of 
these the author says : '• It is of the utmost importance, in taking up the 
stone implements of a region, that each material be traced to its source 
so that from this point of view a study can be made of the work of quar 
lying, shaping, transporting, and finishing." Holmes gives the follow- 
ing classes of implements, in the order of distance from the quarry, 
beginning with the heaviest: 

1. Mortars, and many improvised tools. 

2. Sharpened Itowlders for rude mauls and axes. 

3. Notched and sharpened ])owlder8 for hafting. 

4. Picks and chisels for soapstone and other <iuarries. 

5. Net sinkers, carried along the streams. 

6. Pestles, shajied by ])icking. 

7. Hammer stones, the hotter the shape the further they were carried. 

8. Soapstone vessels, often 10 miles from (luarry. 

9. Grooved axes, selts, scrapers, drills, knives, spear points, arrow points, pipes, 

oruameuts,

The paper is clearly illustrated. [Am. Anthrop., Washington, vi, 
1-14. 

The JouDKil of Gcokxji/, liublished in Chicago, No. 1, January-Feb- 
ruary, 1893, will have a department of archieologic geology, under the 
direction of Prof. William II. Holmes. Already papers on archaeology 
have ai)peared. 

Comparative study slowly unravels the tangle of American archieology 
and ethnology. Dr. J. Walter Fewkes witnessed and became familiar 
with the snake dance of the IIoi)i (Moki) Indians, and in studying the 
old writers, Sahaguu in i)articular, was struck with the wonderful simi- 
larity of the Mexican pictures to the real dances in Arizona. This, with 
the co-operation of Dr. Ed. Seler, Dr. Fewkes has worked out in the 
American Anthropologist. (Washington, vi, 280-300.) 

American arclneology was greatly enriched by the pubbcation of a 
folio volume on the ruins of Tiahuanuco in the highlands of ancient 
Peru. The work consists of two parts, tlie text and 42 photolitho- 
graphic plates. By means of maps, illustrations in the text, ground 
plans and sketches, the authors have placed thems(dves entirely at the 
service of the student. This work is of the same excellent character 
as the Necropolis of Ancon, issued by Reiss and Stiibel a few years 
since. The authors discuss the ethnic origin of the sculptures, the 
material, the dimensions of the blocks (weighing as much as 150 tons), 
the means of transport for many miles and across several inlets of 
LakeTiticaca; the skill in dressing, smoothing and polishing, and carv- 
ing, with implements not much harder than the stone itself. 

A great shock was given to European arch.eology by attacks upon the 
age of the Canstatt and the Neanderthal skull. It is well known Ihat 
Prof. De Quatrefages went so far as to claim a Canstatt and a Neander- 
thal race for early Europe. In the report of the German Aiitliroi)o- 
logical Congress it was shown that the tirst-named skull was found 
associated with Koman pottery, and the last-named was picked up on 
the surface. At the same conference Prof. Virchow indorsed the 
opinion of Steenstru]) that the evidence of contemporaneity of man 
and mammoth in Europe is not only iuadefjuate, but for dimatic and 
geologic reasons no such co-existence was possible. 

Oscar Montelius began the publication of his great w^ork, Jm civilisa- 
tion lyrimitive en Italic depuis V introduction du ntetal, upon which he has 
labored for twenty years. It will be an album of 300 plates grand 4to, 
with more than 3,500 woodcuts and explanatory text. His volume 
upon the history of tlie influence of Orientalism upon Europe during 
the Stone Age, the P>roiize Age, and the Iron Age till about 500 u. c. 
is his Civilization of Hiccdcn in Heathen Times in new form, done into 
French by Salomon Reiuach.

The outcome was a judj^inent against Bndge of £.")(), which his confreres 
l)aid, because they believed he was acting always in the interests of the

PHYSIOGRAPHY' AND ANTHROPOLOGY. 

All sciences are coming more and more to contribute to authroi)ology. 
The International (leographic C'Onference in Chicago furnished an 
example of this statement. Mr. (Jardiuer (J. Hubbard selected as the 
topic of his presidential address. The relation of air and water to tem- 
perature and life. The following titles also show the current of tiionght:

all dwelt upon tliis close bond between geogra|)hy and history. 

Dr. F. Schrader deliveied a lecture before the Ecole d'Anthropologie 
on the inliuence of terrestrial forms upon human development. In the 
order of se(pience from the ISTurth the author distinguislies live zones: 

(1) A boreal zone, quasi continuous and little varied. 

(2) A north temi)erate zone, extended, much varied, presenting for 
the development of humanity the greatest possible number of condi- 
tions. 

(3) A sonth temperate zone analogous but inferior to the last named. 
More ht to receive culture than to create it. 

(4) An inter-troi)ical or equatorial zone, hot, rainy, with alternations 
of aridity and continuity of heat. Less diversified in its ensemble than 
the temperate zone. 

(5) A frigid zone of the south, of no importance in the development 
of man. {Ker. Mens.', Paris, ill, 200-21!).) 

The destruction of vast numbers of animals by the men of early times 
in the eastern continent created a gap in tlie evidence upon which the 
knowledge of very early migrations is to be based. M. Edward I )upont 
has brought together his studies u})on the fauna and man of the qua- 
ternary epoch {Bull. Soe. Beige de geol., 1892). Especially valuable is 
the paper on the study of man considered as a geological force. Spe- 
cies disappeared before the coming of man, doubtless. (,)uite as true 
is it that they were exterminated by man. But in the earliest times 
this destruction was feeble and the author inclines to the view tliat the 
quaternary fauna disappeared through natural causes.

NORTH AMERICAN BOWS, ARROWS, AXl) (,)ITIVI:rs. 



By Otis Titfton Mason. 



" If the canopy of Heaven wero a bow, and the earth were the curd tldereoC; and if cilani- 
ities were the arrows, and mankind the marks fur those arrows; a;id if Ahnighty (iod, tlie 
tremendous and the glorious, were the unerring archer, to who:ii ( oiild the sons of Adam tiee 
for protection f The sons of Adam must flee unto the Lord." — 7V))ii/r« InsHtutes. p. xlviii. 

Ill iio series of museum specimens is the natural liistory of linma]i 
invention better exemplified than in the apparatus of war and the 
chase. The history of wartare especially involves the right understand- 
ing of two words — oftense and defense. The perfecting of defensive 
apparatus has been stimulated by the perfecting of weapons of offense, 
and on the contrary the ingenuity of the human mind has been taxed 
to make the offensive implement of war more i)Owerfiil than the defen- 
sive.* Protection of the body is secured by what is generally termed 
armor. The protection of the family, the tribe, the army corps, is 
achieved by fortification of some kind. 

In the modern art of war this conflict of defense against ofiense 
reaches its climax in the built-up steel rifle-cannon and the nickel and 
steel Harveyized armor i)]ating. One of the modern guns will send its 
shot (juite through a plate 20 inches thick. Now the primitive form of 
this terrible piojectile was the arrow, and of the steel i)late the ances- 
tor was the trifiing hide and stick armor of savagery. 

Offensive implements in all ages and stages of culture are for three 
purposes — to bruise, to slash, and to pierce the body of the victim. 

Bruising weapons are found everywhere, but were highly develoi)ed 
in the Polynesian area, because there abundance of hard wood exists 
and little stone with conchoidal fracture for chipping. 

Among the African savages, l)ecause they possess iron which may 
be worked from the ore, edge or slashing wea]>ons have been espe- 
cially elaborated. 

Among the American aborigines, where obsidian, Jasper in all its 
varieties, chert, fpiartz, and other siliceous stcnies al)ound, i)iercing 
weapons seem to have been the favorite class. 



* These two subjects as developed by the Aiiiericau aborigines will be treated 
subsequently. Shields and armor will lie (b'scribed by 'Sir. Walter Hmmh. 

631 



632 NORTH AMERICAN BOWS, ARROWS, AND QUIVERS. 

However, each of the ebief types of savai;ei'y possesses in some form 
the three great chisses of bruising, shisliing, and piercing weapons. 
For instance, the Polynesians had tlie chil), the spear, and the shark's- 
teeth sword. The Africans fought witli icnobsticks, assegais, bows 
and arrows, and edge weapons in great variety. Tlie Americans, 
especially the iNIexicans. developed a sword with obsidian edge and the 
tomahawk. 

The further subdivision of tliese three classes of weapons is based 
upon their manipulation. Every weapon and every tool consists of 
two parts — the working part and the manual or operative part, — that 
which wounds or kills and that by which it is held or worked. Indeed, 
the fact is sometimes overlooked that the manual or operative i)art of 
a tool or weai)on has undergone greater changes in the course of his- 
tory than the working part. The bow therefore must be studied (juite 
as carefully as the arrow. 

In the rudest form of tool or \vea])on a single piece of stone or 
wood serves both purposes, but e\en in this simple form one part tits 
the hand better and the other is more adapted to the work. A stone 
used for bruising generally has one end better htted to the hand and the 
other shaped by nature to effect the purpose. The stick used as a spear, 
or a club, or a sword, even in savagery, has the dift'erentiation of hold- 
ing end and working end. 

This study of the manual end of a weapon gives rise to the classiti- 
cation of Adrien de Mortillet into weapons held and used in the hand, 
weapons thrown from the hand, and weapons worked by some interme- 
diary apparatus between the hand and the working part. 

Ballistic weapons of America are bolas, throwing sticks or sling- 
boards with their varied darts, slings and stones, blow-tubes and darts, 
and bows and arrows. Some tribes are said to throw the tomahawk 
with good effect. Each of these involves mechanical i)rinciples worthy 
of the most careful study. 

In this paper attention will be ccmfined to the types of bows, arrows, 
and quivers of the North American aborigines, with incidental references 
to similar forms found el>iewhere. It is true that the tribes included 
within this area developed the greatest variety of forms of primitive 
bows and arrows. The built up bows of Asia, studied and described 
by Mr. Balfour,* are of a higher order of invention and net'd oidy be 
mentioned. 

Mexican bows, arrows, and shields have been carefully described by 
Mr. Adolf Bandelier. The South American area has been little inves- 
tigated, but the North American Indian archery aftbrds an excellent 
oi)portunity for the consideration of all the forces and devices which 
entered into human inventions as motives. 

The geographic distribution of materials foi. weapons and of game

NORTH AMERICAN BOWS, ARROWS, AND QUIVERS. 633 

has given rise to an iiiHiiite Aariety of forms. The faihire of .certain 
kinds of trees in many places lias pnt the bowyers to their wit's end in 
devising substitutes for producing the bow's elasticity. The exigen- 
cies of climate and the gloved hand modify the form of the arrow in 
some regions. The progress of culture, the demands of social customs, 
and skill of the manufticturer enter into the study of the bow and. the 
arrow. In other words, in passing from the Mexican border northward 
to the limit of human habitation, one finds the rudest arrow and the 
rudest bow and the most elaborate arrow and bow ever seen among 
savages. 

Again, in making this journey he will observe how qui(!kly his passage 
between certain isotherms, forested regions, deserts, tallies with a 
sensitiveness of the bow or the arrow, which take on new forms at 
every degree of latitude or temperature. 

Finally, if the student be observant, the arrow will write for him long 
chapters about the i)eople, the fishes, birds, and beasts of the separate 
regions and their peculiar habits. 

The following scheme of weapons devised by M. Adrien de Mortillet 
is modiried to fit the North American Area. 

A.— BHUISINO AN1> MA?;(iLIN(i WEAPONS 

1. Held ill the liaiid — Stones, clnbs. 

2. At end (if handle. — Pogainoi^g;ins and casse tetes. 

3. Tiirowii frim hand. — Sling stones, rabbit sticks, bolas. 

15.— SLASHINt; AND TEARIX(; WEAPONS. 

4. Held hi hand. — Stone daggers and swords. 

5. At end of handle. — Sioux war clubs, tomahawks. 

6. Thrown from hand. — Little used. 

C. — PIERCINC; WEAPONS. 

7. Held in hand. — Hone and stoue daggers, slave killers. 

8. At end of handle. — Lances of all kinds. 

9. /Vrt;Vc^/'e.5.— Arrows, harpoons, blow-tube darts. 

Besides those thrown from the hand — stones, rabbit sticks, and 
bolas — there were four types of manual or operative api)aratus used for 
propelling missile weapons by the Nortli American aborigines, — the 
bow, the throwingstick, the sling, and the blow-tube. 

The throwingstick existed throughout the Eskimo area, in south- 
eastern Ahiska, on the coast of Calitbrnia and in Mexico. It is not nec- 
essary here to more than menticui its occurrence in" South Ajnerica and 
Au.stralia. This weai)on has been described by the author at length in 
the rejjort of the Smithsonian Institution (1884), and this pa})er was 
the starting point of half a dozen by others which well-nigh exhausted 
that subject. 

The sling is found on the California coast north of San Francisco. 

The blow-tube existed only in tho.se areas where the cane grew iu

abuiubuice, es})e('j;illy in tlie Soulheiii States of the Union. One or 
two tribes of the Mnskliogean stoek and tlie Cherokees em])h)ytliis wea- 
pon for killinj;' biribs in swampy i»bices. The Choctaws about New 
Orleans make still a eonipoundblowtnbe by fastening four or five reeds 
together after the manner of the I'andean jjipe. lu ]\Iexico and Central 
America this weapon was common. In tropical South America, how- 
ever, much care was bestowed upon the manufacture of two varieties 
of Zarabatana constructed of two pieces of wood grooved and fitted 
together and the Pucuna made by inserting one tube inside of another 
and tamping the interveuing places with wax. 

From the inventor's point of view, the blow-tube with the dart, driven 
to the mark by the elasticity of the breath, should be the antecedent 
and parent of the gun, pistol, and cannon.* Historically the archer 
was the father of the cannonier. It is doubtful whether the inventors 
of gunpowder ever saw an American <n- Malayan blow-tube. 

The universal projecting device of Noith America was the bow for 
propelling arrows and barl)ed harpoons. It is found in its simplest 
form in tlie south and east and becomes more complicated as we travel 
westward and nortliwnrd. The following tyi)esare to be distinguished: 

First. The plain or '• self" bow, made of a single [)iece of hard, elastic 
wood, in each locality the best that could be found. (Plates LXi-LXiii.) 

Second. The com])ound l)ow made of two or more pieces of wood, 
baleen, antler, horn or bone fastened together. (Plates lxii,lxiv,i.xv.) 

Third. The sinew-lined bow, consisting of a single piece of yew or 
other wood, on the back of which shredded sinew is i)lastered by means 
of glue. (Plates LXI-LXIII.) 

Fourth. The sinew-corded bow used almost exclusively by the 
Eskimo. They are made from drift and other wood and backed with 
finely twisted or braided sinew cord and reinforced with wedges, 
splints, and bridges. (Plates lxv-lxxiii.) 

Each one of these fimr types may be sub-divided according to the 
region or tribe. Every location furnishes a species of wood or mateiial 
best suited for the bow-nuxker, and this has its effect upon the structure 
of the weai)on. The game to be killed is another cause of variation. The 
tribal fashions, and material, and game, bring to pass a goodly number 
of special forms of bows which will now have to be studied in more 
detail, commencing at the south where the structure is simplest and 
proceeding to the north where it is most comi)lex. Associated with 
each tyi)e and structure and region of the bow was its appropriate arrow. 
Kothing c<»uld be more intimate than this relationship. It might almost 
with safety be said that the arrows of each culture region could be shot 
with little effect from the bows of another region. 

Again, excepting the little piercer at the end, which does tlie killing, 
the arrows shaft and feathers and nock really belong to the bow, that 
is, to the manual or operative itart before mentioned. 

* It is worthy of note, that etijmologically " cauuoa," is a derivative from the 
Greek Kiwa—n reed.

Most of the words coiitaiiuMl in this vocabulary stand for t'haracter- 
istic'S "wliich are important in the study of bows and arrows according 
to natural history methods. By means of these terms any number of 
bows and arrows may be laid out so as to become types for all sub-

eliminated, slowly, but the most scrupulous curator is not able to get 
rid of all that at once. 

In all times the bow and the arrow have been the basis of much art 
and metaphor. Kot only is this true in higher culture, as in the Bible, 
the Homeric poems, or the "arrow-head" w^riting of the Mesopotami-

THE BOW. * 

lu ancient times there was no otlier weajxjn into which a human 
being conld throw so much of himself— his hands, his eyes, his whole 
-mind, and body.! At any rate this is true of JSforth America, where 
this arm was pre eminent. In Polynesia and in Africa the case would 
be different. All of the early travellers in America si)eak of the sincere 
attachment of the warrior or the hunter to his artillery. 

The noteworthy parts or char^icteristics of a bow are — 

1. Back, oi- i)ait of the bow away from tlu' archer. 

2. Belly, or part toward the archer. 

3. Limbs, or jjarts above and below the grip. Also called arms. 

4. Grip, or portion held in the hand. 

5. Nocks, or ends upon which the bowstring- is attached. 

6. Horns, or parts projecting beyond the limbs, at the end are the nocks. 

7. String, made of sinew, babiche or cord. 

8. Seizing, application of string to prevent the splitting of the wood. 

9. Backing, sinew or other substance laid on to increase the elasticity. 

10. Wrist guard, any device to prevent the bow-string from wounding the wrist of 
the left hand. 

Bows, as to structure, are — 

1. Self bows, made of a single piece. Of thes<! tlie horns may be separate. 

1 in a cable. Called sinew corded bows. 
i with sincw glned on. Sinew lined bow. 

2. Backed bows ( wrapped about. Seized bows. 

" with ^•(■u(■c^ many kinds.. 

3. Compound. 

Bows arc to be studied also as to their materials, their shape, their 
strength, their history, and their tradition. (Plates lxi-xcv.) 

In every Indian wigwam were kept bow-staves on hand in different 
stages of readiness for work. Indeed, it has beeu often averred that an 
Indian was always on the lookout for a good i)ieceof wood or other raw 
material. Tiiis, thought he, will make me a good snow-show frame or bow 
or arrow and I will cut it down. These treasures were put into careful 
training at once, bent, straightened, steamed, scraped, shaped, when- 
ever a leisure moment arrived. ISTo thrifty Indian was ever caught 
without a stock of artillery stores. 

Instances are on record where the wood for bows, the scions for arrows, 
the stones for heads, and even the pluuuige for the feathering were 
articles of commerce. 

As a rule, however, the savage mind had as its problem, not that of 
the modern of ransacking the earth for materials and transferring them 
to artiticial centers of consumption, but the development of the resources

of eacli culture area, to make the bow aud the arrow that each region 
woukl best help hhu to create. His was an epoch of differentiation. 

"The rule laid down by the Apaches for making' tlieir bows and 
arrows was the following' says Bourke: 

"The length of the bow or rather of tlie string should be eight times 
the span from thumb to little finger of the warrior using it. 

" The curvature of tlie bow was determined almost entirely by indi- 
vidual strength or capriee. 

" The arrow should equal in length tlu^ distance from the owners arm- 
])it to theextremity of his thumb nail, measured on the inner sideof his 
extended arm; tlie stem should i>roJect beyond the reed to a distance 
equal to the span covered by the tliumb and index finger. This meas- 
urement included the barb when made of sheet iron. The iron barb 
itself should be as long as the thumb from the end to the largest Joint. 

"Torquemada says that the Chichimecs, among whom he includes 
the Apaches, made bows according to their stature, a very vague 
expression. {Mon. Ind. lib., xxi, introduction.) 

" Gomara savs that the Indians of Florida traen arcos de doce palmas. 
{Hist, (le las liidias, 181.) 

" Landa describes the Indians of Yucatan as making bows and arrows 
in the manner of the Apaches; La largnra del arc(j es siempre algo 
menos (pie el que lo trae.'' (See Cosas de Yiieatan, Brasseur de Bour- 
bourg, Paris, ]86Jr.*) 

Baegert says the bows of the Lower Califoruia Indians were more 
than six feet long, slightly curved, and made from the root of the wild 
willow. The modern cottouwood bow, from the same region, is a long, 
clumsy affair, very near to the most primitive types. (Plate lxi, fig. 1.) 
The bow-strings were said to be made of the intestines of beasts. The 
shafts of arrows were common reeds straightened in tlie hre, six spans 
long, feathered, fore-shafted with heavy wood, a span and a half long, 
with triangular flint poiut.t (Plate xli, fig. 2.) 

Coville says that the Panamint Indians of Death's Valley, California, 
make their bows from the desert juniper (Jimiperus californica utahen- 
sis). The Indian prefers a piece of wood from the trunk or a large limb 
of a tree that has died and seasoned while standing. In these desert 
mountains moist rot of dead wood never occurs. The bow rarely 
exceeds three feet in length and is streugthened by gluing to the back 
a covering composed of strips of deer sinew laid on lengthwise. The 
string is of twisted sinew or cord made from twisted hemp. J 

These Panamint belong to the Shoshonean sto(;k, spread out over the 
Great Interior Basin, and all the tribes use the sinew-lined bow, with 
transverse wrappings of shredded sinew. (Plate lxi, fig. 4.) 

The bow of the Chemehuevis (Shoshonean) is characteristic of the 
stock to which they belong, being of hard wood common in the region, 
elegantly backed with sinew and bound with shredded sinew, orna-

meiited also at the end by the skin or rattle of the rattlesnake.* The 
type belongs to the stock everywhere. 

"The Apache bow was made always of the tou,yh, elastic mountain 
mulberry, called par excellence, ' Iltiu,' or bow wood. Occasionally the 
cedar was employed, but the bows of horn, such as were to be seen among 
the Crows and other tribes of the Yellowstone region, were not to be 
found among the Apaches and their neighbors of Arizona. 

"The elasticity of the fiber was increased by liberal a])pliciitions of 
bear, or deer fat and sincM' was, on rare occasions, glued to the back 
for tlie same purpose. + 

It is not probable that any southern tribes of the family, to which 
the Apache belong, ever dwelt east of the Rocky Mountains. The 
Athapascan sinew^ veneered bow is found strictly west of the Rockies, 
the slender variety in the Basin and British Columbia, the flat vaj-iety 
on the Pacific Slope. The Navajo also have adopted this type of 
sinew-lined bow. 

The Cherokees lived in the Piedmont portion of the Appalachians 
in Carolina. Georgia, and Tennessee. The finest oak, ash, and hick(n"y 
abounds in this region. These tribes used every variety of available 
elastic wood for bows, the toughness of \\ hich they improved by dipping 
them in bear's oil and warming them before the fire.f The Ciierokees 
were Iix)(pu)ian and their bows niay betaken as the counter])art of those 
made by the Six Nations. The Algonquin bows were similar. 

The Pawnee warrior always preferred a bow of hois (Varc, and besides 
the one in actual use he would often have in his lodge a sti(;k of t^je 
same material, which at his leisure he would be working into shape as 
a provision against possible exigency, l^ows of this wood were rarely 
traded away. Boiv iVitrc^ however, was to be obtained only in the 
South, and for the purpose of procuring it a sort of commerce was kept 
U[) with certain tribes living there. § 

The Blackfeet made their bows of the Osage Orange, but they were 
compelled to procure it by trade from the tribes down on the Arkansas 
River. 1 1 The Blackfeet are Siouan in language and dwelt in the buffalo 
country in northwestern Dakota. They were in the same mode of life 
as the Pawnees, who dwelt farther south and are of the Caddoan stock. 
The whole length of the Missouri River was traversed in this Blackfeet 
commerce. (Plate i.xxxiv, fig. 2.) 

The Central Eskimo, about Hudson J>a.v, have two kinds of bows 
(pitique), a wooden one (Boas's figs. 438 and 439, p. oOU), and another 
nmde of reindeer antlers (Boas's figs, 440 and 441, p. 503). Parry gives 
a very good description of the former (ii, p, op)):

concave side, when struug, by si piece of bone 10 inches long, firmly 
secnred by treenails of the same material. At each end is a horn of 
bone, or sometimes of wood covered with leather, with a deep notch for 
the reception of the string. The only wood which they can procure 
not possessing suffieient elasticity combined with strength, they ingen- 
iously remedy the defect by securing to the back of the bow, and to 
the horns at each end, a quantity of small lines, each composed of a 
plat or ''sinuet" of three sinews. The number of lines thus reaching 
from end to end is generally about thirty; but, besides these, several 
others are fastened with hitches round the bow, in pairs, commencing 
8 inches from one end, and again united at the same distance from the 
other, making the whole number of strings in the middle of the bow 
sometimes amount to sixty. These being put on with the bow some- 
what bent the contrary way, produce a spring so strong as to require 
considerable force as well as knack in stringing it, and giving the 
requisite velocity to the arrow. The bow is completed by a woolding 
round the middle and a wedge or two here and there, driven in to 
tighten it. 

The bow represented in Boas's ftg. 439, p. 503, is from Cumberland 
Sound and resembles the Iglulik pattern. The fastening of the sinew 
lines is different and the piece of bone giving additional strength to the 
central part is wanting. In Cumberland Sound and farther south 
wooden bows each made of a single piece Avere not very rare; the wood 
necessary for their manufacture was found in abundance on Tudjan (Res- 
olution Island), whence it was brought to the more northern districts. 

The bows which are made of antler generally consist of three pieces, 
a stout central one beveled on both ends and two limb pieces rivete^ 
to it. The central part is either below or above the limbs, as repre- 
sented in Boas's lig. 440, p. 503. These bows are strengthened by 
sinew cord in the same way as the wooden ones, and generally the 
joints are secured by strong strings wound around them. A remark- 
able bow made of antlers is represented in Boas's fig. 441, p. 503. The 
gripis not beveled, but cut olf straight at the ends. The joint iseffected 
by two additional pieces on each side, a short stout one outside, a long 
thin one inside. These are firmly tied together with sinews. The short 
piece prevents the bow from breaking apart, the long one gives a 
powerful spring. The specimen figured by Boas was brought home by 
Hall from the Sinimiut of Pelly Bay, and a similar one was brought by 
Collinson from Victoria Land and deposited in the British Museum. 
The strings are attached to these bows in the same way as to the 
wooden ones."* Plate lxiv, fig. 4; lxv, figs. 1, 2. 

The compound Eskimo bow is found in a region where timber does

ideal mateiial for the purpose. Last of all came the whaler with i)lenty 
of hoop wood, and the ship's blacksmith. In the National Museum the 
material for the comj)ouud bow is baleen, antler, horn, ivory, and wood 
from whale ships. The grip is the foundation piece, round and rigid. 
The limbs are worked to shape, spliced on to the ends of the grip and 
seized in place by a wrapping of sinew yarn or cord or sinnet. The 
notches are cut on both sides of the nock, which is often pegged on to 
the end of the limb with treenails. The whole class of projecting 
weapons must be looked upon as a lesson in techno-geography and 
as a remarkable example of the i)ower of human ingenuity to throw off 
all precedents and predilections under suflicient stress and lesort to 
those new methods which luiture declares to be the only thing to do. 

As previously intimated every Indian boy learned to make a bow. 
Every Indian man had a certain amount of skill in the art, and when 
he scoured about the forests, the capabilities of trees for his purposes 
engaged his thoughts. He saved up good pieces for a rainy day and 
made the improvement of his artillery a pastime. When he became 
old, if the fortunes of his existence accorded him such a doubtful bless- 
ing, he kept his hold on his tribe by becoming a bosvyer when he 
could no longer take the field. Since the substances used in making 
bows are of the region, techno-gc<>graphy finds an excellent illustration 
in the study of the bows of North America, which may be on this basis 
thus divided: 

(!) The hard-icood, seJf-hoiv (ire<(. It embraced all North America 
east of the liocky Mountains and south of Hudson Bay. This area 
extends beyond the mountains along the southern border, and is invaded 
by the compound bow at its northeastern extremity. Indeed, in those 
regions where more highly differentiated forms i)revailed, it constantly 
occurs as the fundamental pattern. (Plates lxi-lxiv, lxxx, lxxxi, 

LXXXIII-LXXXVI, LXXXIX.) 

(2) The conipound-hoic area. By the compound bow is meant one in 
which the gri]) and the two wings are separate pieces, or one in which 
the cupid's bow is made uj) of as many bits of horn as are necessary. 
There are really two compound-bow areas, the northeast Eskimo and the 
Siouan. The former has been described by Boas. 

The compound bows of the Sioux are made of buffalo and sheep horn 
and of the antler of the elk. Dr. Washington Matthews states that he 
has seen a bow made of a single i)iece of elk horn. All the examples 
examined by the writer are wrapped with flannel or buckskin so as to 
conceal every trace of the joints made by the union of the different 
parts. The compound bows of the Si(^ix are the most beautiful in 
shape of any among savage tribes and recall the outlines of the con- 
ventional form of artists. In both types the comi)ound bow arose 
from a dearth of wood for nmking a self-bow. (Plates lxii, lxiv, lxv.) 



NORTH AMERICAN BOWS, ARROWS, AND QUIVERS. 643 

The horn bow was not coiiflned to the parts of America inhabited by 
the great ruinitiants. Pandarus' bow is thus described by Homer — 

'Twas foimfd of liorn, and smoothed with artful toil, 

A mountain goat desigut'd the shining spoil, 

Who pierced long since, beneath his arrows bled, 

The stately quarry on the cliffs lay dead. 

And sixteen palms his brows large honors spread. 

The workmen joined and shaped the bended horns, 

And beaten gold each taper point adorns. 

(Balfour in the work quoted has exhausted this theme.) 

(3) The sinew-lined how area. — By sinew lined bow is meant one in 
which finely shredded sinew is mixed with giue and laid on so that it 
resembles bark. This area extends up and down the Sierras in the 
western TJnited States and British Columbia, on both slopes, and 
reaches as far north as the headwaters of the Mjickenzie. (Plate LXi.) 

The occurrence of hard wood in the Great Interior Basin and of yew 
and other soft woods on the western slopes gives rise to the wide, thin 
bow in the latter, and the long, ovate, sectioned bow in the basin. 

The Shoshonean or narrow bow occupies the interior basin, and is 
found also in the hands of Athapascans in Canada, and Apache, 
Navajo, and Pueblo tribes farther south. Its chief characteristic, in 
addition to the ovate section, is that in many examj)les, at intervals of 
a few inches, after the back was laid on, it was wrapped with narrow 
bands of sinew. These hold the backing to the wood and prevent split- 
ting (Pi. LXi), This device seems necessary with these narrow exam- 
l^les. Scarcely one may be found an inch across the back, affording not 
enough sticking space for the glue. With the broad California bows it 
was different. 

(4) The sinew-corded bow area. — Where the bow has a backing made 
up of a long string or braid of sinew, i^assing to and fro along the back. 
This has been carefully studied and described by Murdoch.* 

He divides the bows into classes, and shows how each of these 
classes originated, partly by the resources and exigencies of the 
environment and partly throngh outside influences. There are practi- 
cally four classes of this corded or laced pattern, to wit: 

(a) The Cumberland Gnlfti/pe. — In these the sinew cord, or yarn, is 
made fast to one nock, and passed backward and forward along the 
back of the compound bow forty or fifty times. In addition to this, 
additional strength is given by half turns and short excursions to and 
fro on the back of the grip, Mr. Murdoch considers this the primitive 
type of the sinew-backed bow, (Plates lxiv, lxv.) 

{b) The iSouth AJaslan type. — The bow is of wood, broad, flat, and 
straight, but narrowed and thickened at the grip. The back is flat, 
and the belly often keeled, and fre(inently a stiffener of wood or ivory 
occurs under the sinew lining. There is a subtype of this bow from 

' Report of U. S. National Museum, 1884, p. 307-316. Plates I-XII. 



644 NORTH AMERICAN BOWS, ARROWS, AND QUIVERS. 

the Kuskoqiiim area, in whicli the ends bend backward abruptly, so as 
to lie along the string, as in the Tatar bow. In this tyjie the strands 
of sinew cord lie parallel, pass entirely from end to end, and the last 
one is wrapped si)irally around the rest. The whole of the broad part 
cf the limbs is often seized down with spaced spiral turns of the cord. 
Next to the Cumberland type this is simplest, and is only a slight 
departure from it. (Plates lxv-lxvii.) 

(f) The Arctic type. — The bow is shorter and narrower, the ends are 
often bent as in the Tatar bow, and strips of sealskin are put under the 
backing. The cord is always braided sinew, passes from nock to nock, 
but is laid on in a much more complicated manner, and much more 
"incorporated with the bow." The whole process of laying on the 
backing is minutely des(uibed by Mr. Murdoch. (Plates lxviii-lxx.) 

{d) The Western type. — Bow broader and flatter than the last, but 
less contracted at the grip, either straight or Tatar shape. The 
backing is in three parts, none of which extend as far as the nocks. 
The first cable goes from end to end near the nocks; the second from 
elbow to elbow, say afoot from each nock; the third along the straight 
part of the back. The cables become practically one alongthegrip. The 
method of laying down and knotting this intri(;ate lashing must be 
studied from the ligures (Plates lxxi, lxxii,) so that in the Eskimo area 
we have : ( I) The plain or self-bow, of one piece ; (2) the compound bow, 
of whalebone, antler, bone, ivory or wood ; (3) the compound and sinew- 
corded bow; (4) the single-cabled straight bow; (5) the single-cabled 
Tatar or three-curved bow; (6) the complex-cabled straight bow; (7) 
the complex-cabled Tatar bow; (8) the three-cabled straight bow; (9) 
the three-cabled Tatar bow. 

The material of bows varies geographically. Beginning in the south 
the regions may be roughly marked off — 

(1) Mexican border : Cottonwood, willow, mez(piit, bois d'arc, juniper. 

(2) Southern United States: Hickory, oak, ash, hornbeam, walnut. 

(3) Northeastern United States: Hickory, oak, ash, walnut, hornbeam, 
sycamore, dogwood, and, indeed, any of the many species of hard wood. 

(4) Mississippi A^illey: Same as on the Atlantic slope. 

(5) Plains : Bois d'arc coffee tree and ash, wood procured in connnerce. 

(6) Interior basin: Mezquit in the south, abundant woo'ls in the 
north, hard and elastic; species not determined. 

(7) California and Oregon: Evergreen woods, yew, spruce. 

(8) Columbia Biver: Same as California. 

(9) Southeastern Alaska: Willow, spruce. 

(9) Western Canada: Birch, willow, maple, si)ruce, cedar. 

(10) Eskimo: Driftwood and timber from whale ships and wrecks. 



NORTH AMERICAN BOWS, ARROWS, AND QUIVERS. 645 

The bow-string amoug the North American tribes was made of the 
followiug: 

(1) Strips of tough rawhide phxiii or twisted. 

(2) String made of the best fibers of the country — hemp, agave, etc. 

(3) The intestines of animals cut into strips and twisted. 

(4) But most frequently of sinew. 

The strip of gristle extending from the head along the back and serv- 
ing to support the former, and those taken from the lower part of the 
legs of deer and other ruminants were selected. These were hung up to 
dry. For making bow-strings the gristle was shredded with the fingers 
in fibers as fine as silk in some tribes, but coarser in others. These fibers 
were twisted into yarn on the thigh by means of the palm of the hand, 
after the juanner of the cobbler. For making the twine some tribes 
employed only the fingers. Taking two yarns by one end between the 
tips of the thumb and forefinger extended of the left hand, the twister 
seized one yarn with his right hand, gave it two or three twists and laid 
it down on the palm of the left where it was kept in place by the 
fingers. Seizing the other yarn he repeated the process, brought it 
over the first yarn, laid it on the palm, caught the other yarn with the 
fingers of the left and seized the yarn first twisted with his right hand, 
all without losing a half turn. The writer has seen this work done with 
great rapidity. New strands of shredded sinew or vegetable fiber may 
be introduced at any time. 

Both in New Mexico and in Alaska the natives make twine by means 
of a twister that works after the fashion of the watchman's rattle. But 
this device may be an innovation. The string of the Cherokee bow is 
said to have been made of twisted bear's gut.* The same material is 
mentioned in other connections east of the Mississippi River. There is 
a faint suspicion that in some instances the narrator mistakes the sinew 
cord for gut strings. 

The study of the knots of savages is yet incomplete. Again many 
bows are sent to museums without strings, or unstrung, or falsely strung. 
The lower end of a bow-string, technically called the noose, was fast- 
ened on by the " timber-hitch," two half turns or hitches. There is no 
"eye," so called, wrought on the string, but the bow is strung by mak- 
ing two or more half hitches around the notches at the upper end. 
Neither is there any nocking point seizing on the bow-string of any 
Aiaericau tribe. 

The ancient bowyers made these ends of their bows of horn and 
trimmed and polished them in great fashion. Many examples from 
the Malayan and the Papuan area have the extremities very daintily 
carved. But the American bow has nothing approaching this. In a 
few Oregon examples the sinew backing is at the extremities gathered 
up in a hornlike extremity and finished off with fur, beads, and the like. 

" Jones, So. Indians, 252. 



646 NORTH AMERICAN BOWS, ARROWS, AND QUIVERS. 

Otherwise the end of the bow stave is rounded, cut in ou one side or 
on two for the bow-string. ^ 

It was not the custom to apply a "packing" or a woolding on the 
grip of bows. The eastern tribes did not. But the compound bow of 
the Sioux, the tiat yew bows of the California tribes, and the ellipsoidal 
sinew-backed bow of the Shoshouean tribes, were so treated. In 
addition to this, in many cases, the bows were painted in several colors, 
geometric figures were marked on them, and additions of bead-work 
made them quite fine. This decoration of the bow occurs among west 
coast tribes that manifest extraordinary artistic tastes in baskets and 
other work. 

The warrior and the hunter tended their bows with as much care as 
though they were children. Every time they were used they were care- 
ful to oil them in order to preserve their elasticity. The western Eskimo 
wound uj) his bow when he desired to use it, and was careful to unwind 
and straighten it as soon as the hunt was over. This winding was done 
by twisting the sinew cable along the back by means of ivory levers 
making only a half turn, and then sliding their whole length through 
the cable before repeating the process. The ordinary self-bow Miien 
not in use was straightened and pushed into the bow case. (Plate 
XCIII.) 

The author can find little authentic information concerning the 
bracing of the bow by the North American Indians. Those that he 
has seen perform the operation followed the old English method, placing 
the bottom horn against the hollow of the left foot, holding the upper 
horn in the left hand, bending the bow with the left knee, and tying the 
bowstring with the right hand. There was usually no eye in the bow- 
string that slid down on the bow and pushed up into the nock in 
bracing. 

Frequent reference is made to the bracer or wrist guard of the ]S^orth 
Americans. In the far north the gloved hand and the long sleeve made 
such device almost unnecessary, but a few specimens of carved bone or 
ivory objects in collections from the liyperborean area bear that name. 
The Indian, par excellence, wore upon his left wrist a band of rawhide, 
from 2 to 3 inches wide, as a guard against the bowstring. Many of 
these come from the Southwest, where they are ornamented with silver 
and worn in ceremonies. 

"Among the Yurok bows and arrows were made by old men skilled 
in the art."* As will be seen further on in studying the arrow, there 
was really no guild or craft of bowyers. In his childhood the Indian 
made the best bow he could. Whatever ingenuity he expended upon 
it yielded him an immediate patent. lie not only had the exclusive 
use of it, but every improvement which he made upon it inured to his 
advantage at once in the form of sustenance, flattery, and substantial 
social reward.

NORTH AMERICAN BOWS, ARROWS, AND QUIVERS. 647 

So far as known the savages of America were right-handed. But 
there is nothing in any bow from the northern portion of tlie continent to 
show this fact. Left-handed archery was certainly quite uncommon. 
In a large number of darting boards or throwing sticks, which under 
certain technical exigencies are used by the Eskimos in place of the bow, 
there are only two specimens that are left-handed. Among the women 
of tlie same areas, not one implement has been found fitting the left 
hand. 

The conditions of sending an arrow into the vital part of any game 
are distance, wind, varying elasticity of the bow, varying weight of the 
arrow, proper shape of the weapon, penetrability of the game. Each 
one of these variables is rendered as constant as possible by the hunter, 
in skulking, getting to windward, using woo<l of the greatest strength 
for bows, and making one's own arrows. The intellectual stimulus in 
the creation and using of the bow and arrow was incalculable. 

Oliver Marcy gives the following on arrow penetration : 

" I have in my possession the sixth dorsal vertebra of a buft'alo, the 
spine of which contains an iron arrow point. The arrow struck the spine 
about li inches above the center of the spinal canal, and penetrated tlie 
bone 0-82 of an inch. The bone at the point struck is 0-55 of an inch 
thick, and the point of the arrow protrudes beyond the bone 0*27of an 
inch. The arrow was shot from the rigiit side of the animal and the 
plane of the point was horizontal. The animal was mature and the 
bones well ossified. Thcuigh the vertebra has been much weathered, 
the epiphyses adhere closely. The animal was not as large as some 
individuals. The whole vertical length of the vertebra is 13 inches, 

"The arrow must have penetrated several inches of tlesh before 
striking the bone.'' * 

He does not take into consideration also the thick hide and matted 
woolly hair, both especially thick at the point struck. 

As it is customary in rating the stature of a people to disregard the 
giants and the dwarfs, so in rating theXorth American projectile we may 
as well omit the marvellous and exceptioiml successes in company with 
the egregious shortcomings in order to know the importance of the 
average. When these allowances are made, there is enough to show 
that for accurate and rapid and effectual shooting the bow and arrow 
in the hands of a skilled warrior or hunter were a creditable weapon. 
The distance at which an Indian bow will do execution has not been 
studied among the tribes. As i)reviously said, the design of the hunter 
or the warrior was to get close up. In all the sham battles which the 
writer has witnessed from his boyhood, the warriors almost touched 
each other. The dexterity with which they parried and fenced with 
the arm shield and the bow and arrow was marvellous. The absence of 
noise, the invention of game drives, the universality of decoys, the 
hundreds of disguises, theefticient skulking, the imitations of the cries 
of animals, all point to the intention of getting within a distance of 20 
yards or less.

The South Americau weapon is half as long' again and may do better 
farther off. 

At the reijuest of the author the president of the Washington Arch- 
ery Club, Mr. Maxon, made experiments in the penetrating power of 
Indian arrows and the propulsive power of Indian bows. The result 
was that the self or plain bows are not equal to the best archery bows. 
But the sinew-backed bows of the Pacific coast were capable of as great 
execution as man is capable of making.* 

"Constant i)ractice," says Capt. John G. Bourke, ''had made the 
Apaches dextrous in the use of the bow, arrow, and lance; their aim 
was excellent, and the range attained was perhaps as much as 150 yards. 
I am able from my own recollection to supply a number of illustrations of 
the great force with which the arrow was discharged, although a person 
observing for the first time an arrow coming toward him would be sur- 
prised at its apparent lethargy. 

"In the summer of 1871 I was riding by the side of Gen. Crook on the 
summit of the elevated plateau known as the Mohollon Mountains, in 
Arizona. We were a short distance ahead of a large column of cavalry 
and our immediate party was quite small. We ran into an Ai^ache 
ambuscade. A number of arrows were discharged, two of them pierc- 
ing pine trees to a depth of at least G inches. On another occasion a 
pine door three-eighths of an inch thick was penetrated. In July, 1870, 
a friend of mine, M. T. Kennedy, was mortally wounded by an Apache 
arrow which pierced his chest. The autopsy disclosed the fact that the 
arrow had no head." 

"Mackenzie speaks of having driven a headless arrow 1 inch into a 
jiine log on the Colnmbiu Kiver in 1703. (See Voyages, London, 1800, 
p. 2G9.) 

"Maltebrun speaks of the force with which the Apaches shot their 
arrows. 'At a distance of 300 paces they can pierce a man.' ( Univ. 
Geog., art. ' Mexico,' Eng. translation, Philadelphia, 1832, vol. in, lib, 
or cap. 85th, }). 293.) I doubt this very much, as in my own experience 
I have limited their range to 150 yards. 

"Cabeza de Vaca seems to have been greatly impressed with the dex- 
terity of the Indians seen along his route from Florida to the Pacific 
coast settlements. He tells us that with their arrows they could pierce 
through oaks as thick as a num's thigh; that the range of the arrow 
was 200 paces; that Spaniards had been transfixed by arrows notwith- 
standing that they wore good armor. (In Teniaux, vol. Vii, p. 107.) 

"Don Antonio Espejo also asserts that the wild tribes living in the 
drainage of the Rio Grande could pierce a coat of mail with their 
arrows. (iSee his ' Relacion,' in Hakluyt, vol. in, 160, p. 4G1, A. D. 
1581.) 

"Domenecli says that the Indians have trials of skill with arrows and 
will often keep ten in the air at one time. {Deserts, vol. ii, p. 198. ) Refers

to Apache arrows sunk up to the feathers in the giant cactus on the 
side of the Santa Catalina Canyon in Arizona, 1870."* 

Marvellous stories are told of the i)recision with which the American 
Indian could shoot. Cockburn said that the Indians of Darien could 
strike down with arrows the smallest flying bird. By shooting upward 
they were said to cause an arrow to pin a bird feeding on the ground. 
Sticking a shaft in the ground, they would shoot upward and the 
descending arrow would split the one sticking in the ground. t 

The use of the bow was a part of the education of a boy. Among 
the many hundreds in the National Museum a great number are marked 
"boy's bow." In handling them the student must often speculate on 
the deferred breakfast that hung on the action of these miniature imple- 
ments. We are told also that boys were frequently called out to shoot 
for prizes. That was the predecessor of all manual training schools, 
wherein skill and support went hand in hand with the Indian lad. 
Indeed, their games and pastimes were spirited imitations of the suc- 
cesses of their elders. 

The author is not able to obtain reliable information as to whether 
the American tribes shot always "overhand" — that is, over the bow 
hand, with the arrow drawn inside the bow. Dr. Shufeldt, in his prac- 
tical experiments to ascertain the mode of arrow release among the 
Navajos, incidentally remarks that the arrow was on the left side of 
the bow and rested on the top of the hand. In many descriptions, 
however, the forefinger is described as surrounding the arrow shaft. 

At present the bow and the arrow have well nigh disappeared from 
the face of the earth as an active weai)on. Four hundred years ago it 
stood in the forefront, where it had remained during thousands of years. 
It might be properly questioned whether, in the long run, the arrow 
had not destroyed more human lives than the bullet. In Canada, and 
sparingly elsewhere, bow guns or rude arbalests are found in the hands 
of Indians, but they are without doubt introduced. The arrow, having 
reached its highest elaboration as such in America, was superseded by 
the musket of the Aryan race. 

The Iroquois tribes were among the first to receive firearms from the 
early settlers. On this account they soon abandoned the bow and the 
arrow. Colden says that they had entirely laid them aside in his day 
(1727). This abandonment of the bow for the gun has been spoken of 
as showing the Iroquois to have been a progressive people. Certain it 
is that this prompt adoption of the firearm put this confederacy at once 
at the head of the eastern Indians and made them a terror to the Algon- 
quian tribes. 

The almost entire absence of noise in the movement of the arrow and 
the shooting of the bow is the greatest ditferentiation from the gun, 
which alarmed the whole earth, man and beast. It may be said that 



Capt. J. G. Bourke, letter. t Hausard, p. 26. 



650 NORTH AMERICAN BOWS, ARROWS, AND QUIVERS. 

the noise of the gun put the man or beast to be killed quite as much 
out of the reach of that weapon as the little alarm created by the archer 
had moved the victim away from his weapon. 

THE ARROW. 

" The ancient arrow-maker 
Made his arrow-heads of sandstone. 
Arrow-heads of chalcedony. 
Arrow-heads of flint and jasper, 
Smooth and sharpened at the edges, 
Hard and polished, keen and costly.' 

LllNGFELLOW. 

The continent of America furnishes excellent facilities for the study 
of the arrow. Every variety of climate, material, and land or water 
game are here, to create an indeiinite diversity of structures. 

In its simplest form, the arrow is a straight rod pointed at one end, 
perhaps in the fire, and notched at the other end for the bow-string. 
But such a missile would be of little worth; and so the arrow has 
undergone many modifications in answer to the demands of the hunter. 
The parts of a highly developed arroAv are the following: 

(1) The shaft; of which it is necessary to study the material, the 
technique, the form, the length, the grooves, and the ornamentations. 

(2) The shaftment; which is that part of the shaft upon which tlic 
feather is fastened. This section of the arrow varies in length, in form, 
and greatly in ornamentation, because it is the part of the weapon 
upon which bands and other ornamental marks are usually placed. 

(.')) The feathering; or the strips of feather or other thin nniterial laid 
on at the butt of the arrow to gi\e it directness of flight. The study 
of this feature includes the method of seizing; the attaching to tlie 
shaftment; the position of the feather, whether flat or perpendicular to 
the shaft; the manner of trimming the plume; the line, whether straight 
or spiral, upon which each feather is laid, and the glue or cement. 

(4) The nock ; or the posterior end of the arrow, seized by the fingers 
in releasing. This is a very important feature in the study of this 
weapon. For instance, the Eskimo arrows have flat nocks, while all 
other arrows in the world seem to be more or less cylindrical or spher- 
ical. In sonn^ the form is top-shaped; in others, bull)ous; in others, 
cylindrical; and in others, spreading, like the tail of a fish or swallow. 
In modern arrows a footing is added to the nock. 

(5) The notch; or cut made at the end of the arrow to receive the 
bowstring. Each stock of aborigines has its own way of making this 
cut at the end of the arrow; and this characteristic, born of the mate- 
rial, though seemingly unimportant, is frequently helpful to the student 
in deciding upon the tribe to which the arrow belongs. 

(G) The foreshaft; or that piece of hard wood or bone or ivory or 
antler laid into the anterior portion of the shaft and trimmed to a 
symmetrical shape. It serves the double purpose of making the front 



NORTH AMERICAN BOWS, ARROWS, AND QUIVERS. 651 

of the arrow heavier tliaii the rear, and also affords a better means of 
attacliing' arrow-heads or liarpoou barbs of special form. 

(7) The head; or that anterior part of au arrow which makes the 
wound or produces the result. Before coutact with the white race, 
aborigines were wont to make their arrow-heads of stone, bone, wood, 
shell, and even of cold hammered metal. The study of the arrow-head 
involves the point or blade, the faces of the blade, the facettes and 
serrations and notches of the expanding blade, the butt or tang for 
attachment, the barbs, and sometimes the barb piece, which is an extra 
bit of bone or other substance fastened to the posterior end of the 
stone head to multi|tly tlie number of barbs. (Plate lv, ligs. 2, o.) 

Kow, each one of these parts may be varied in number, in foini, in 
material, in artistic tinish; or one or more may be wanting. It will be 
seen therefore at once what an excellent instrument the arrow may be 
for the study of the natural history of invention, how it has been 
influenced by climate and by material resources, how it has been modi- 
fled for definite functions, and has developed complexity with age. 

It will readily be seen from au examination of the foregoing analysis 
that the creation of au arrow involves a great many of our modern 
crafts. In every locality the arrow-maker has shown, first of all, a 
wonderful acquaintance with the materials at hand, as though he had 
searched all the resources of the mineral, vegetable, and animal world, 
and after studying all there was, had selected the best. We are not able 
now to discover that the savage could have found any better material 
within his own environment. For the selection and creation of the shaft 
there was demanded a knowledge of the best kind of woods, and the 
invention of knives, straightening apparatus, "sandpaper," dyeing- 
apparatus, and glue or cement of some kind. In fastening the various 
parts of the arrow together sinew was employed. The savage stripped 
from the leg or the neck of one of tiie larger mammals a mass of sinew 
which he allowed to dry. It was then carefully iK)unded and shredded. 
When he was ready to use this material he placed several of the strips or 
fillets in his m )uth until they became thoroughly soaked with saliva. 
Then, holding with his left hand the parts to be attached and one end of 
the sinew flllet, he held the other part of the sinew in his right hand and 
revolved the arrow shaft with the left, holding the parts still together 
until one or two turns were nuide. He could then use the flugers of 
his left hand in smoothing down the sinew and directing its course, 
while with the right he held the unwound i^ortions tight and directed 
the sinew to its position. When the wrapping or seizing was nearly 
flnished the loose end was carefully drawn under the last turn or two, 
pulled tight, and cut ott', so that neither end was visible. The whole 
was carefully rubbed down and allowed to dry. The sinew in drying 
shrunk very much and bound the parts flrmly together. (I'late i, fig. (».)

feather is carefully split from one eud to tlie otlier, and the jiith and 
unnecessary parts of the quill carefully removec, so as to leave the 
plume and only a strip of the midrib. In laying the feather upon the 
arrow-shaft differences of manipulation existed among the different 
tribes. In some of them the midrib was laid close to the shaftment 
and glued tight, while the ends were seized with sinew, and the plume 
was shorn either very close to the .shaftment in a parallel line or into 
some other artistic form. Not only the knowledge of birds was necessary 
in the choice and the arrangement of the feather, but there was a great 
deal of mythology connected with the proper bird whose feathers should 
be placed upon the arrow and the position and seizings connected with 
the feathering. (Plates xl-lx.) 

The manufacture of the head of the arrow and its various parts 
involves knowledge of bone, ivory, or horn, and also familiar acquaint- 
ance with stone and stone-working. Arrowheads differ from one 
another in material, in size, in form, and in methods of attachment. 
The savage arrow-maker was a mineralogist. He not only knew the 
qualities of rocks but also their best methods of working, as well as the 
best conditions in which they existed for his purposes in nature. In 
each country the material employed is in every case the best from that 
region. In a large collection from the United States arrow-heads have 
been made of every variety of quartz, chalcedony, agate, jasper, horn- 
stone, chert, novaculite, slate, argillite, and obsidian. In rare cases even 
quartz crystal, earnelian, amethyst, and opal were used. In working 
these materials the savage inventor soon found that the physical 
properties and availability of the material changed by natural sur- 
roundings, lie knew by experimentation that a stone lying in a lu'ook 
yielded him better results than one exposed to the sun and the weather 
on the open fields, and that a bowlder buried in the damp earth where 
it has lain for many centuries gave him safer results with less work 
than the brook pebble, so that he not only became a critical expert in 
the qualities of materials, but also was led to become a quarry man 
in order to exploit the proper materials. It has been very well shown 
by Professor Holmes that many spots supposed to have been the 
refuse heaps of Indian camps for many years, are only the sites of 
of ancient stone quarries, and the })ieces found buried in these heaps 
are the refuse of their manufacture. In places the necessary rock 
could not be found in bowlders either on the surface or in the streams 
or in the gravel beds, but the materials were part of ancient ledges 
under ground, as in Ohio, Arkansas, and other places. It was neces- 
sary there to remove tlie surface soil, to dig out great pits, and by 
means of sledges and fire and other means within the capabilities of 
this Indian workman, to detach cores and masses of material which 
could be subsequently worked up into arrow-heads and other imple- 
ments. As soon as the arrow-maker had secured his stock he began 
to work it up into the shape desired, first, with a stone hammer, by 



NORTH AMERICAN BOWS, ARROWS, AND QUIVERS. 653 

means of which he knocked oft" ftakes or spalls of the pro]»er size and 
shape. Sometimes he would introduce between his stone hammer and 
the block of material a "pitching tool" of antler or hard bone. As 
soon as the tlake of proper dimensions was removed, the next thing with 
the artist was to bring this into proper form by means of the flaking 
tool or flaker. The method of dressing the chip of flint into shape 
varied from tribe to tribe; in some the pressure was downward; in 
others it was upward; and the method of holding the hand and doing 
the work will be described under the head of " arrow-makers' tools." 
Arrow-heads are frequently confounded with spear-heads and knife or 
dagger-blades. The smallest objects of this class are usually arrow- 
heads, and the size alone would decide in many cases, because, after 
reaching a certain weight, the blade would defeat its own ])urpose 
by being any larger. But there is no difference in shape between 
the arrow-head and the other objects mentioned. A great deal of 
attention has been paid to the forms of arrow-heads, but they may be 
reduced to a few simple classes, such as the leaf-shaped, either com- 
plete or truncated; the triangular, and the stemmed. Sub divisions of 
these classes have been formed by archeologists, but many of these 
are such as have resulted from the limitations of the material m the 
hand of the artist. Fie has simply made that particular form because- 
the material would yield to that and no other. Prof. Thomas Wilson, 
in classifying the arrows in the National Museum, mentions those, first, 
with beveled edges, the bevel being in one direction; second, with ser- 
rated edges; third, with bifurcated stem*; fourth, with long barbs at 
the ends; fifth, triangular in section; sixth, broadest at the cutting 
end; and, seventh, all polished arrows. 

As will be seen in the general and special descriptions of arrows, 
other substances besides stone were used for the heads. In the north 
and among the Esquimauan stock, frequently bone, ivory, antler, horn, 
and wood are found taking the place of stone. In each case that 
material w^as selected which would bring about the best results. For 
instance, what is called the "rankling" arrow, for the destruction of 
the reindeer, has its head made from the leg bones of the deer, the 
barbs upou the side are very sharp, and the dowel, for the insertion 
into the shaft of the arrow, very small, so that when the animal is 
struck the head would easily come out of the shaft and at every move- 
ment of the victim be carried further in toward its vital parts. Com- 
ing southward along the Pacific Slope, slate replaces chipped stone, 
and for barbed arrows native copper, bone, and wood are used. A 
few arrows from this region have also heads of shell. Along the 
Kocky Mountain slopes, in the land of the buft'alo, before the days of 
iron heads, bone Avas used quite as often as stone in the fabrication of 
arrow-heads. Very few specimens are preserved in cur museums of 
arrows from the tribes of the Eastern States, but historians convince us 
they were not diftereut from their Western relatives in the material and

form of their arrow-lieads. Of the ancient inliabitants of this conti- 
nent the perishable material of arrows constituting the shaft and other 
parts has rotted and left us naught but the stone heads. Even those of 
bone and wood and other material have passed away, so as to leave the 
impression that the Indians of this eastern region used only stone; but 
all authorities agree that otlier substances were employed quite as 
freijuently as the last named. 

There are as many ways of classifying arrows as there are parts of 
the arrow, and more, some important parts furnishing several classific 
concepts. These will be set down as they occur without regard to order, 
each time seeking to exhanst the arrow.

As to the feathering, arrows are (1) without feather; (1*) two feathered; 
(3) three or more feathered ; and, as to the attachments, (1) glued to 
the shaft; (2) fastened only at the ends; (3) with the quill inserted at 
its ends into the arrow shaft. The nock of American arrows are (1) 
Hat as in the hyperborean zone; (2) bulbous or spread, as in Canada 
and North United States; (3) cyliiulrical, as in California and the 
sonthern tier of States. (Plates xl-lx.) 

There are innumerable references to ancient arrow makers among 
the North American Indians, but the piobability is tliatthe life history 
of the bowyer is repeate<l in that of the superannuated tietcher. First 
comes the boy struggling through his primitive institute of technology, 
then the warrior or hunter, skillful in making an arrow and in Avearing 
it out. Last of all he takes the wings of Hermes from his feet and 
spends his closing years in making arrows for his sons. 

There was, according to Chi[)pewa tradition, a particuhir class of 
men among our Northern tribes, before the introduction of firearms, 
called makers of arrow-heads. The same is related by other Algon- 
kians.* Longfellow's ancient arrow-maker will occur to every reader at 
once.

arrows led a man into iiuiiiy trades — quarryiiian, stoneeutter, niiiieralo- 
gist, sinew dresser, and wood worker. In the far North lie must be 
also worker in bone, ivory, and horn. As a rule, in ail savagery, both 
wnth men and women, the user of an implement must be its manufac- 
turer. Yet, the differentiation of trades is a necessary step in the 
progress of culture, and our Indians had taken it more than once. 

The North American savages were excellent (piarrymen. In every 
region they knew the very best kinds of siliceous stones, the very best 
places to find these stones, the natural conditions under Avhich they 
were kept in the most fracturable state, the best way to break, flake, 
and chip each stone into the desired shape.* The Indian was also a 
good lapidary, as numerous sites examined by Holmes will attest. 

Arrow-heads are found in immense numbers about the fields and along 
the banks of rivers in the CFuited States. It would not be an error to 
say that they are numbered by millions. They occur in great abundance 
ui)on the sites of ancient cami)s, near shell heaps, fishing grounds, and 
about the fields where used to wander the deer and other game sought 
by the Aborigines. This is evidence that the making of an arrow-head 
was an easy matter, while the shaft required much time and jtatience 
to finish. 

It has been said that by means of the stone, the shape and artistic 
skill with which it is wrought, the edges, the tang, and the conse- 
quent attachment to the shaft, arrows differ from tribe to tribe and 
individual makers show certaiu*idiosyncrasies in the same tribe. Chert, 
slate and ivory in Eskimo land, wood and bone along the volcanic 
portions of the Pacific Slope, in British Columbia and Alaska; the 
most beautiful heads in the world of obsidian and jasper series in 
Oregon and California, coarser stone in the East at once proclaim 
what kind of arrows this or that tribe used. 

According to Holmes the stages in making an arrowhead are fractur- 
ing, chipping, flaking. Fracturing is done at the quarry or wherever the 
original stone is picked up. The simplest fashion is breaking one stone 
with another; but stone from a (piarry works better than surface bowl- 
ders. When the workable stone was in masses the Indian had more con- 
venient tools, stone hammers or sledges, jiicksof wood or antler, and even 
fire if he had need of it. The first operation is to break up the original 
bowlders or masses so as to get out of its interior spalls capable of 
being wrought into blades. Each kind of stone had its own best way 
of treatment, whether quartz, <iuartzite, rhyolite, chert, agate, Jasper, 
chalcedony, obsidian, or what not. There did not exist in the United 
States so pliable a form of flint as that occurring in great abundance 
in western Europe. Obsidian and jasper gave the best results. 

Chipping was also done with a hammer, but, this time, a pebble of 
hard stone, oblong, convenient for the thumb and two fingers, and

somewhat bluntly pointed. The writer has often seen arrow-makers 
hold a spall of stone in the left hand between the thumb and closed 
fore tingjer, and by means of a dainty hammer stone knock off flakes 
with the greatest rapidity, barely touching the edge of the spall at 
each blow. Arrow-heads for common use may be finished by this 
means. (Plate i.) 

The flaking of blades was done with a flaker. The simplest form of 
the flaker is a piece of bone from the leg of a deer, pointed at one end. 
The essential characteristics of the working end of this tool are that it 
be stout enough to stand any amount of pressure that a man can give, 
and that it be of such a texture that it will " take hold" of the stone. 
The outer side of antler, hard bones from the legs of ruminants, and 
even soft iron are excellent, but ivory or steel are not good materials for 
flakers. (Plate i.) 

The Eskimo* make the best flakers, working the point from antler of 
the caribou and the handle from ivory, carving the latter to fit the hand 
and to give to the workman the best " purchase." The point is set in 
the end of the handle and firmly lashed in place by means of rawhide. 

All tribes do not use the flaker similarly. If the reader will take a 
tooth-brush handle in his right hand and a chip of siliceous stone in the 
other, he may try the following methods: 

(1) Lay the spall or chip on a table or bit of wood, holding it firmly 
in place with the left thumb and forefinger. Grasp the tooth-brush 
firmly in the right hand, with the thumb on the top. The handle will 
work better if it be sharpened like a husking peg. Press down the point 
near the edge of the spall firmly, and remove chips along the under side. 

(2) Lay the chip on the palm of the left hand gloved, or upon a bit 
of rawhide, holding it in place with the fingers, but not the thumb. 
Press off flakes along the edge of the chip. 

(3) Grasp the chip between the thumb and forefinger, so that its 
outer edge will lie along the ball of the thumb. Hold firmly with 
fingers and press off flakes toward the thumb. 

In all cases the operator needs confidence and knack. Wonderful 
results are achieved by good workmen in such brittle material as bottle 
glass, obsidian, and the jaspers. 

There are in Washington several men connected with the Bureau of 
Eth lology who are capable of j^roducing the most beautiful arrow- 
heads from bits of obsidian or glass. 

Within the past year or two a new lig' i. has been thrown upon the 
whole operation of arrow-head-making. Extensive ancient quarries 
have been opened in Washington City, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Minne- 
sota, Arkansas, and the processes revealed. There were several steps 
followed certainly by the eastern fletcher. t 

(1) The digging of moist stone from the quarry.

(2) The making- of blanks on the spot. 

(3) The finishing- by the processes named. 

The arrow-maker among the Virginia Indians, foi- making his 
shafts, used a knife Avith a bhide of beaver tooth set in a wooden lian- 
dle. This served him for saw, knife, and chisel. John Smith tells us 
that he made the uotcli in his^rrow-shaft by grating with, this knife. 
For chipping his arrow-heads of stone he used "a little bone, "which 
he ever weareth at his bracer, or any splint of a stone or glasse in the 
forme of a hart." The arrow-head -was fastened to tlie shaft -with deer 
sinew, held firm by mean.s of a glue made of the tops of deer horns 
boiled to a jelly. This method is not unlike that of the Apache, Utes, 
and other tribes of the great interior basin.* 

This is a charming connecting link between the prehistoric and the 
historic. The knife with a blade of beaver tooth may at this very day 
be seen in the hands of the Eskimos about the Yukon mouth. One 
could say that a grip or handle of wood or antler had a groove sunk 
into one end, the root of the tooth was laid in this, and the two lashed 
with wet rawhide. At present the Eskimos use their beaver-tooth knife 
to put a fine edge on their blades of steel. The front enamel of the 
tooth is so much harder than the rear that it makes a perfect chisel, and 
would act well for knife or saw. " The little bone that he weareth at his 
bracer" for flaking his arrow-heads one miglit see any day in the hands 
of a Ute warrior a few years ago, and Maj. Powell collected and depos- 
ited several in the National Museum. This is simply a little bit of the 
fibula of the deer. On the west coast and in Eskimo-land this tool has 
its grip and its working part distinct. Finally, in the administration of 
the sinew for seizing, and the glne for binding all tight, one had only 
to watch the Apache Indian described in this text. 

The arrows {qaqdjung) of the central Eskimos are made of round 
pieces of wood, generally tapering a little toward the lower end, to 
which two feathers of an owl or some other bird are attached. The 
bone heads of these arrows are Joined to the shaft, as represented in 
Boas's fig. 443, p. 501. The difference in the methods used l^y the Mac- 
kenzie and the central tribes in fastening the point to the shaft is very 
striking. The arrow tang of the former and of the western tribes is 
pointed and inserted in the shaft (Boas's fig. 444:, p. 51).")), wliile that of 
the latter is always beveled and lashed to it (Boas's figs. 442 and 443, 
p. 504). The direction of the bevel is either parallel or vertical to the 
edge {id. fig. 445, p. 505). Other forms of arrows are shown in id. fig. 
446, p. 506. A similar difference between the fastenings of the foreshaft 
to the spear handle exists in the two I alities. Western tribes give its 
base the form of a wedge {id. fig. 447, p. 506), which is inserted in the 
shaft, M'hile the central Eskimos use a mortise. (Plates lii-lx.) 

Formerly slate heads were in general use {id. fig. 448, p. 500) ; now the 
heads are almost everywhere made of iron or tin, riveted or tied to the

point {id. tig. 4:4r), p. 50(1). In aueient j;Taves fliut heads are frequently 
found, some of wliich are represented in id. tig. 449, p.. 507. On Soutli- 
ampton Island stone heads are in nse even at the i)resent time. Fig. 
423, p. 491, probably shows how they were attached to the shank.* 

The Panamint arrows are made from the stems of the reed {Phragmi- 
tcs vulgaris) and from willow shoots. The shafts are about 3^ feet 
long. jS^early mature, but still green, reeds are cut, their leaves removed, 
and the stems dried and straightened in the hands before a fire. Use 
is also made of a small stone, across the face of which have T)een cut 
two grooves large enough to admit an arrow shaft. This stone is 
heated, and a portion of the crude arrow is laid iu one of the grooves 
until it is hot. The cane is then straightened by holding it crosswise 
lu the teeth and drawing the end downward. By repeating this pro- 
cess throughout the whole length of the shaft a marvelously straight 
arrow is produced. The head of the arrow is a pin of very hard wood 
taken from some species of greasewood {iStrij)Iex). It is about 5 inches 
long, and tapers evenly to a blunt j)oint. The base of the head is 
inserted about three-fourths of an inch into the hollow of the reed, 
and rests against the uppermost joint. It is bound in place by a thin 
band of sinew. Al each joint of the arrow shaft is burned a ring of 
diagonal lines. The base of the shaft is notched to receive the bow- 
string, and feathered with three half feathers, bound on with sinews 
and twisted so as to give to the arrow a rotary motion. t (I'l. xli, fig. 1.) 

" The Spokane Indians laid a i)iece of buckskin on the hand, and from 
a flint pressed off flakes with a piece of deer's horn," These Indians 
belongto theSalishan family, and it is easy by means of the old material 
in the Museum to rehabilitate this ancient arrowmaker of Washington 
State. His process of flaking is that marked 4 in Plate i. The material 
on which he worked was incom])arable, and his handiwork now forms 
the treasures of the Museum. 

"At the base of Mount Uncle Sam" says Dulog, "on the west of Clear 
Lake, California, there is a tract 2 or 3 miles in extent covered with 
fragments of obsidian. 

"With material so plentiful, the surrounding Indians are careful to 
choose only those pieces best shaped by nature for their purpose; but 
at places distant from the source of supply, the obsidian, which is often 
brought.] n large blocks, is chipped off in flakes from around a central 
core by blows of a rock. 

" The old exi)ert put on his left hand a i^iece of buckskin, with a hole 
cut in it to let the thumb pass through, something like the 'palm' 
used by sailmakers. This was of course to protect his hand Avhile at 
work. In his right hand he took a tool of bone ground down to a 
blunt point. These tools, made often from the leg bone of a deer, are 
assorted in sizes, large ones being used for coarse work and small ones 
for fine work. 

"A piece of obsidian of the right size was held in the left hand, theu 
the right thumb was pressed on the top of the stone, while the point of

the bone avjis stronj^ly pressed against the under edge of the proposed 
arrowhead, and a little splinter of obsidian worked off. The oi>eration 
was similar to the opening of a can with one of the old fashioned can 
openers that work without leverage. Oftentimes materuil is spoiled in 
the sharpening. Around deserted camps piles of rejected fragments 
are sometimes found, either broken in putting on the edge or not being 
near enough the desired shape to pay for working np. 

"A good deal of the sharpener's work, too, consisted in freshening up 
the edges of points blunted by use. 

"One arrow-head, weather-worn by exposure, was shown me, with a 
border of fresh fractures extending from one-eighth to one-fourth of an 
inch in from the edge, where the sharpener's tool had been. 

"There results from this process a serrated edge, which in the best 
specimens is beautifully tine and regular, but in rougher tools is often 
coarse. The old workman was careful of his stock in trade, and rolled 
up the fruit of his industry in a piece of ragged blanket to prevent its 
being injured while in transit from jdace to place."* 

In this charming bit of description the old man played the following 
roles : 

(1) Discriminating the best pieces of stone to work, mineralogist. 

(2) Obsidian knai)i)er, stone-breaker. 

(3) Flaker, with deer-horn tool working on the palm. 

(4) As retouching injured blades, repairer of arrow-heads. 

(5) Preserver of forms, a kind of wild Vishnu, laying np against 
future work all his stock in trade. 

There seems to be little modern testimony to the assertion that the 
savage had learned to bevel the sides of his arrow heads alternately, for 
the purpose of making his arrow revolve in the air. Mr. Cushing has 
shown that this alternate beveling of the edges was a natural result of 
holding- the i)iece of stone in a certain way along the thumb during the 
operation of chipping. 

Lieut. Kay was the first to actually send to the National Museum a 
bit of antler, 6 inches long and about three quarters of an inch in 
diameter, to be used like a stonecutter's launch or pitching tool or a 
smith's ininch in knocking off chips in the process of arrow-making, f 
But there are constant references to this intermediary tool. The writer, 
who has experimented in most aborginal stone-working methods, has 
not attempted to use this apparatus in order to know its limits. 

The substitution of hoop iron and other metal and glass for arrow- 
heads was one of the iirst lessons of acculturation learned by the Ameri- 
can tribes. No custom or fashion was violated by this; the shaft and 
feather, that is, the manual part of the arrow, and all social and mythic 
portions' remained unchanged. f This is the universal law of transfer 
from lower to higher grades. It is for the reason that woman's arts 
merely take better tools to do the very same work that savage women 
are easier to elevate than men.

For straightenins the shafts of arrows, and even the bone or ivory used 
for X)oiuts, tlie abori,uiiies employed a kind of wrench. In the south it 
was merely a convenient bit of wood, spindle-shaped, having a hole 
through the middle. The Utes used the end of the horn of the moun- 
tain sheep, perforated with holes of different sizes. The Plains Indians 
utilized the hard bones of the buffalo. The West Coast tribes made 
use of blocks of elk horn, and the Eskimo carved out of walrus ivory 
excellent tools for this purpose.* (Plate xxxix.) 

For grinding down and polishing arrow shafts the Indian had a 
special set of tools. There are in the L^ S. National Museum from sev- 
eral localities small slabs of sandstone with a shallow groove running 
longitudinally in which the arrow shaft was laid and drawn back and 
forward. The leaves of grass containing siliceous matter served for the 
smoothing- process. Finally, a smooth stone or bit of bone served to rub 
down the shaft and put ou the finishing touches. The term "shaft 
grooves " is preferable for those straight or serpentine or zigzag furrows 
cut on an arrow shaft between the shaftment and the head or the fore- 
shaft. They have been alleged to bo symbolical of the lightning to invoke 
the spirit of destruction to dwell in the arrow. Others denominate them 
"■blood-streaks," supposing they i)romote bleeding from a wound, so 
that the hunter could follow up his game by the trail of blood. The 
reed shafts never bear such streaks; the Eskimo do not make them, 
neither do the Northwest Coast Indians. Athapascan, Shoshonean, 
Siouau, Kaiowan tribes are especially given to this practice. The fur- 
rows do not always follow the same plan, and it would have been easy 
some years ago to work out series of patterns for these marks and 
determine their relation to tribes. They are in general : (1 ) straight and 
parallel; (2) wavy and sinuous; (o) zigzag, without design. (PI. xli, 
fig. 3.) 

The same tribe used arrows of about one length and weight, as cor- 
rect shooting, like good penmanship, is a balancing of a hundred sensi- 
bilities. Every good archer drew his bow to the arrow head every shot, 
for near or for far. If one's bow be drawn always to arrow-head, and 
one's arrows be always of the same length, whether from his own quiver 
or from another's, the elements of variability are much reduced. It 
nuist be from some such cause that the arrows of each tribe agree so 
nearly in length. Indeed, since neighboring tribes shoot one another's 
arrowSj there is undoubted inter-tribal agreement in length within limits. 
It is not here affirmed that the arrows of a tribe are exactly of a length. 
The variations are within certain narrow limits. 

The author has measured a large number of quiver contents. The 
arrows of one quiver agree absolutely. The arrows of a tribe agree 
within a narrow margin. Often, especially in the buffalo region, there 
seemed to be a species of international agreement in the length of the 
arrow. 

The foreshafted arrow finds its occasion first of all in the country of

the reed cane — that is, akiiig tlie southern portion of the United States. 
It may then be traced through those portions of California wliere the 
rhus, ehler, and other pitliy twigs abound. In the Eskimo area it has 
a multitude of structures and functions. 

The foreshaft in the South and Southwest is a slender bit of hard 
wood sharpened and let into the top of the shaft and having the arrow- 
head attached to the fore end. The reasons are two. A hollow reed 
or a very pithy twig affords a very poor attachment for the arrow-head; 
and, secondly, this slenderer, heavier rod aids the directness of the 
flight. Indeed, the very long reed arrows of the Apache and Mohave 
tribes have for that reason insignificant feathers. 

In the Eskimo arrows the heavy foreshafc of bone or ivory serves 
another purpose. Bone being heavier than wood, when oue of these 
arrows is shot at an object in the water and the head is detached, the 
arrow stands perpendicular, and is dragged along by the divided line, 
the feather bobbing about and enabling the hunter to follow up his 
game. 

In the harpoon arrow and the harpoon, the foreshaft furnishes an 
excellent socket piece for the barbed head or the "loose-shaft". There 
is no doubt, also, that its much greater specific gravity assists in the 
direct or straight-forward motion of the weapon. Many of these missiles 
are discharged into the water, in wliich case the ivory foreshaft is of 
great assistance. 

. It is often said by frontiersmen that the Plains Indians had two ways 
of mounting an arrow-head with relation to the notch at the nock. If 
the plane of the arrow-head be horizontal when the arrow is in position 
for shooting — that is, at right angles to the notch, the missile is a war 
arrow, to go between the ribs of men. But if the plane of the head be 
vertical when the bow is drawn, the missile is a hunting arrow for pass- 
ing between the ribs of buffalo aiul other mammals.* 

"Dodge explains that the Comanches place the notch of the arrow 
in the same plane with tlie notch of the string so that it may surely 
pass between the ribs of the animal which are up and down; for the 
same reason, the blade of the war arrow is perpendicular to the notch, 
the ribs of the human enemy being horizontal. ( Wild Indians^ San 
Francisco, 1882, 419.) 

Captain Bourke thinks this is a mistake. He says, " I have seen all 
kinds in the same quiver." 

There is more authority and reason for the assertion that the barbed 
arrowheads among these same Indians were for war and tlie leaf-shaped 
and rhomboidal heads were for hunting, because they could be easily 
withdrawn from tlie wound and used again; but the Eskimo have a 
barbed arrow, with ivory or bone barb piece, fitted into the head of the 
shaft in the most temporary fasliion, so that when shot into an animal 
the head remains, rankles, and works its way into the flesh. For the

same reason the foresliafted arrows of the South aud Southwest are 
loosely put together. The coloring- of the shaft of arrows is techni- 
cally called the riband. The Eastern tribes, the Basin tribes, and the 
Eskimo paint their arrows very little. Not much stress could be laid 
on this characteristic except on the California and Oregon coast. Here 
the a^^thor finds the following to be true : Tlie arrows in the same quiver 
have the same riband. Tlie arrows in the same tribe have the same 
general type of riband, and the same colors occur in old arrows. From 
tribe to tribe there occur differences in riband, but they have not been 
studied out. 

The selling of prepared paints and dyes to the Indians by traders 
has introduced inextricable confusion into this characteristic. The 
riband on the arrow is generally in the shaftment or that portion of the 
arrow covered by the feathering. These bands and stripes have been 
called clan marks, owner marks, tribal marks, and the like, but they 
are not decisive in such matters. 

According to Mr. Hough "African arrow-heads and feathering are 
fastened on with grass, palm-leaf strips, and other vegetable libers, and 
many are tanged or socketed, and are not lashed at all."* Piipuan 
arrows are served with, vegetal liber, the Ainos use bark, and in 
South America many tribes lash with natural libers. 

Most tribes of North America do not use any cement in fastening the 
head upon the shaft. The shrinking of the sinew is quite sufiticient to 
hold all snugly in place. But in the Southwest of the United States, 
the Algarohia glandulom, t\\e Prosop'iH juU flora ., aud the Laria mexicana 
yield excellent gum, which is used by the Shoshonean and Yuman 
tribes to attach the arrow-head, without the use of the sinew. t (PI. 
Ill, hg. 2.) Pine tree pitch and animal glue are also used. 

The feathering of an arrow is an interesting study from place to 
place. It is governed by a host of considerations. As to this char- 
acteristic, arrows may be un feathered, two feathered, three feathered, 
many feathered. The feathers vary in length from those only an inch 
to others a foot long; in adhesion, from those attached only at their 
extremities, and lying close or standing ott", to others glued hard and 
fast to the shaftment their entire length. In some tribes the strips of 
feather are laid flat along the shaftment, as among the Eskimo and 
the west coast tribes, but in the great majority the feathers radiate 
from the shaft. In some tribes the strips of feathering are without 
"ornament, in others they are shorn along the margins to be straight, 
triangular, and notched and a bit of downy feather is left at the nock 
as a streamer. In this respect, when carefully cut, some of the west- 
coast arrows present a decidedly natty appearance. 

On one occasion an Apache Indian came to the author\s department 
of th*". National Museum and, at his request, placed the feathering aud

head upon an arrow. The feathers were split carefully and any exces. 
sive pith or horny portion of the quill removed. The pieces to form 
the feathering were trimmed to the same length. The Indian next 
shredded some sinew, wliich had been sent to the Museum from Huj)a 
Reservation in California, prepared by the relatives of the Apaches 
that had been separated from them for centuries. This he chewed 
until it was soft and pliant. He was now ready to lay on his feathers. 
They were placed on the shaftment, wrapped slightly at the ends with 
sinew to hold them in position until they could be adjusted to suit his 
rigorous taste, at equal distances apart and at the proper distance 
from the nock. Placing the shaft under his left arm and holding the 
soft sinew in his right arm, he revolved the arrow with the thumb and 
fingers of his left hand and guided tlie wrapping with his right hand. 
Here was a ])rimitiv^e machine, with shaft and two bearings, used for 
the purpose of winding evenly a thread upon a spool. The wrapping 
or "seizing" of an Indian arrow is a very pretty and uniform piece of 
work. Mr. Hough calls attention to the operation of this Apache fletcher 
and gives drawing.* Among the northwestern Eskimos it is common 
to neglect the seizing of sinew and to insert the ends of the quill portion 
of the feather into the soft wood by means of a pointed ivory implement. 
As mentioned, ^•ery many Eskimo arrows are found without feathers 
at all, the very heavy foreshaft or iron head carrying the arrow forward 
with sufficient accuracy. On the other hand, many of the barbed har- 
poons and bird tridents of the Eskimo are provided with feathers. In 
the feathering of an arrow one feather must be uppermost, called in 
archery the cock feather. In some beautiful specimens from Cooks 
Inlet and near by one feather is snow wliite. But the author has 
examined many hundreds of arrows without being able to detect that 
the arrow-maker had in mind to draw attention to any one of the 
feathers so as to create a true bottom and top to his missile. In the 
Eskimo two-feathered arrow tlu^re is, of course, always one feather on 
top and another under. 

The number of feathers on a Xorth American arrow is an exceed- 
ingly variable quantity. As a general rule the Eskimo have two and 
the Indians three. This will do i^retty well as a rule, but many three- 
feathered and no-feathered arrows occnir in Eskimo land, and among 
Indain tribes no-feather arrows are common. The function of the 
feather is to retard the rear end of the missile and cause the arrow to 
go straight. This object being capable of accomplishment in other 
ways the feather may be omitted. 

The feathering of an arrow nuist be studied: 

(1) The species of bird from which the feather is taken. 

(2) The "number of feathers, two, three, nuiny. 

(3) The shape and trimming of the feathers. 

* American Anthropologist, iv, 61. 



664 NORTH AMERICAN BOWS, ARROWS, AND QUIVERS. 

(4) Method of attacliment, by sieziiig, or gluing, and to each of these 
there are many varieties. 

(5) Tlie part of tlie feather attached to tlie shaftnient, close glued, 
standing off, or seized all ahnig by a spiral sinew thread. In many 
museum specimens the glue has disappeared and feathers appear 
standing off that ought to be close laid. 

Tlie featliers of arrows are usually laid on in a line with the shaft, 
but many examples have come to light in which the feathers have a 
spiral direction on the shaftmeut. On one occasion the writer saw an 
Apache Indian linish the feathering of an arrow by seizing the two 
ends of the feathering and giving them a twist, simply to make the 
featliers lie flat on the arrow shaft. This goes for what it may be worth 
in accounting for the spiral position of many feathers. It is inconceiv- 
able that any savage should grasp tln^ i)roblem of the rifle bullet and 
construct his missile accordingly. 

Captain J. (I, Bourke, U. vS. A., furnishes the following : " The Apaches 
use three hawk feathers, arranged e(]uidistant along the shaft in the 
direction of the longer axis, fastene<l with sinew. 

"TheUabeson the Amazon use three feathers spirally. (Wallace, 
Amazon, London, 1853, 403.) 

•<■ The Pinias of the Gila have two feathers instead of three. {Cre- 
monii, 103.) 

"Mackenzie states that the Hare Indians of British North America 
who are, like the Apaches, members of the great Tinneh ftimily, use but 
two feathers. ( Voyages, London, ISOO, 40.) 

" According to Morgan, the arrows of the Iroquois had but two 
feathers and ended at the ])ower extremity in a twist. {Leaf/iie of the 
Iroquois, N. Y., LS.")1, 300.) 

"The arrows of the Apache-Yumas are feathered spirally with three 
feathers making a quarter-turn around the shaft. (Corbusier, in Amer. 
Antiquarian, i^ovember, 1880.) 

"Maximilian, i*rince of Wied, speaks of the feathers of the Mandan 
arrows being tied on at both ends like those of the Brazilians; he also 
speaks of the si)iral line, either carved or painted red, which runs 
along the greater number of arrows, and says that it represents the 
lightning.'^ (London, 1843, 389.) 

"The exidanatiou I received was that the runnel permitted the 
escape of blood and reduced the chances of expelling the arrow or the 
shaft."* 

The nock of the American arrow is far more important than that on 
the bow. A good classification may be based on this characteristic as 
pointed out long ago by this writer. The following classes are easily 
recognized : 

(1) The fiat nock, as in all Eskimo arrows and in very few others. 

(L') The cylindrical nock, most noteworthy on all reed arrow shafts 
of the South and in those of the far Orient. 

(3) The bulbous nock, exaggerated in size on the West Coast, by cut- 
ting away the cedar wood as much as it would permit, and then wrap- 

*J. G. r.ourke, U-tter. 



NORTH AMERICAN BOWS, ARROWS, AND QUIVERS. 665 

ping the butt end of the arrow with a narrow riband of birch bark until 
it resembled a small Turk's head knot. The Plains Indians also created 
a bulbous nock by whittling away the arrow shaft a fourth of an inch 
above the end, leaving a cylinder for a finger grip. 

(4) The swallow-tail nock, an exceedingly dainty form affording a 
wide open notch and flaring finger grip, without waste of material. 
(Examples in Plates xliii-xlvii.) 

Notches for the bow-string were either very shallow, angular gashes, 
U-shaped cuts Avith parallel sides or gracefully curved incisions resem- 
bling the horizontal portion of the Greek letter i)si. 

Combining tbe notch with the nock the student has a mark which is 
helpful in deciding the band or tribe. At any rate, American arrows 
dift'er in both. 

There is another characteristic noticeable at this jwint, tbe distance 
of the nock from the feathering. In some tribes the latter crowds 
down over the nock. In otlier, more dainty specimens, the feathering is 
several inches away. 

This special characteristic connects itself with Prof. Morse's most 
interesting study respecting " arrow release." It will be easily seen 
that tlie thin, flat nock of the Eskimo lends itself easiest to the second 
or the third class of Prof. Morse, while the bulbous nock and the 
flaring nock conform most easily to his first class, in which the thumb 
and first joint of the forefinger pinch the butt of the arrow. Coming 
south, into the reed arrow country, where the nock is cylindrical, the 
Tertiary release might be looked for. 

Dr. Shnfeldt describes the method of arrow-release among the oSTava- 
joes.* 

"Having read, with great interest, Prof. Morse's pamphlet on arrow- 
release, it was with no little curiosity that I handed a bow and two 
or three arrows to an old gray headed warrior present, and asked 
liim, ' Draw — as if you were about to kill the worst enemy you had in 
the whole world.' The old fellow seized the bow and arrows, and 
immediately drew one of them to its very head. This is the position he 
stood in at'the time: His left foot was slightly in advance of the right, 
the bow was firmly vSeized at its middle with the left hand, while it was 
held somewhat obliquely, the upper moiety inclining toward the right 
from the vertical line, and, of course, the lower limb having a correspond- 
ing inclination toward the left side. The two spare arrows were held 
with the bow in the left hand, being confined by the fingers against its 
right outer aspect. With the right hand he seized the proximal end 
of the arrow in the string, using the thumb and index finger, at a point 
fully an inch or more above the notch, and consequently including the 
feathers. The ring finger bore against the string below this seizure, 
and its pressure was re-enforced by its being overlapped by the middle 
digit, the little finger being curled within the palm of the hand. 

"This corresponded to Prof Morse's secondary release as figured on 
page 8, of the above referred-to pamphlet, with the exception that the 
middle finger should overlap the annularis, and was not of itself used

to draw back the striii^ti'. I noticed, too, that the arrow at its head was 
on the left .side of tlie bow and simply rested on top of liis clinched 
hand. This man wore, in common with all the others who used the 
bow, a stift leather biacer, fastened by buckskin striiif^s about his left 
wrist, the collar being about 2 inches deep, and this, in several others 
who stood near and who wore them, was ornamented with silver but- 
tons. He drew the arrow back and forth three or four times without 
(•hanging' the position of his finger or hands, when J suddenly asked 
him to shoot as if he were going to kill a squirrel running up a tree. 
He smiled at this and simply drew the bow the same irai/. Upon 
fnrthcr questioning liim, he told me that the Navajoes rarely held their 
spare arrows in the l)()w hand, as he now had them, but carried a scab- 
bard (quiver of buckskin) full, in front of them, from which they could 
be removed with great rapidity while firing; this he immediately 
demonstrated to me from one of the scabbards worn by an Indian there 
present." 

In archery-arrows aiul in Asiatic examjjles a piece of hard wood is 
inserted at the nocking end of the arrow. But in American arrows 
the nock is always a part of the wood of the shaft. This piece, in 
technical language, is called the "footing," but it need not be here dis- 
cussed. 

The subject of poisoned arrows in North America is a vexed one. 
A very high authority has said that the thing was unknown. But I 
have the testimony of Bourke to the contrary. iSTo one avers that these 
aborigines prepared a vegetable poison, like the curari. But the toxic 
effect of putrid flesh was known, whether or not bitten freely by rattle- 
snakes. Dr. W, J, Hoffman will l»ring together the evidence on this 
subject.* 

Powiaken, a Salish chief, declared to Mrs. McBean that obsidian 
and glass ]>oints in iiriows were poisonous (U. S. N. .M. letter). 

The Koniagas i>oisoned their arrow and lance points with a prepara- 
tion of aconite, by drying and pulverizing the root, mixing the i)owder 
with water and, when it fermented, applying it to their weapons. 

Bourke furnishes the following: "Selecting the roots of such plants 
as grow alone, these are dried and ]Kmnded or gr:ited." (S(()ier, Bil- 
HiKfs Ex., 178.) 

They made arrow points of copper, obtaining a su])]>ly from the 
Kenai of Copper River; and the wood was as finely finished as if turned 
in a lathe.

THE QUIVER. 

The quiver is difilicult to study, because collectors have paid little 
attention to it. Among all the Plains tribes they are objects of beauty, 
and have been gathered as bric-a-brac, with little information of their 
whereabouts. (PI. lxxvii-xciv.) The same rules are to be observed 
in the study of the quiver that we apply to all other objects connected 
with aboriginal industries. The quiver is largely of the region. In 
the first place the material out of which each example is made must 
be furnished by nature; hence it is of sealskin in one [)]ace, of cedar 
wood in another, of soft pelt in another, and in the south land is fre- 
quently made of some kind of soft basketry. Again, the structure of 
the (piiver must be adapted to its function, that is, to the bow and 
arrows to be carried; also to the exigencies of the weather and the 
surroundings The parts of a most elaborate ((uiver are: 

(1) The bow case, a long, slender bag, into which the bow is thrust. 

(2) The arrow case, a pocket in which the arrows are kept, points 
downward, as a rule. 

(3) The stiffener, a rod of wood attached along the outside of the 
arrow case, to keep it rigid. 

(4) Baldric, a band of buckskin, or in the finest examples, of elegant 
fur, lined and decorated with quill work, passing over the left shoulder, 
across the breast, and attached by its ends to the quiver. It is for 
carrying the quiver. 

(5) Fire bag, a leather ]>ouch in which the Indian hunter kept his 
flints, steel, spunk, awl, and other subsidiary apparatus needful on his 
journe3% It Avas tied to the middle of the bow case or the stiffener. 
Among several of the mountain tribes the squaw lavished all her skill 
upon her husband's quiver. The costliest beaver, marten, otter, and 
mountain lion pelt was invoked. It was lined with soft buckskin, or in 
later times with red strouding. IJeads of every imaginable color were 
worked uiDon the border of the arrow case and upon the lining of the long 
pendant therefrom. Strips of fur, daintily cut in fringes, were sewed 
about the bottom of the bow case, and every spot capable of rich 
decoration received it. Between this and the plain salmon-skin cap- 
sule, into which the Eskimo thrust his arrows, there are many grada- 
tions of quivers, as will appear in the treatment of the several tribes. 

"The quiver of the Central h^skimo, says Boas, is made ot seal-skin, 
the hair of Avhich is removed. It comprises three divisions, a larger 
one containing the bow and a smaller one containing 4 or 6 arrows, 
the head directed toward the lower end of the case. When extracted 
from the quiver they are ready for use. Between the two compartments 
there is also a small pouch, in which tools and extra arrow-heads are 
carried. (Plate xciii). 

"When travelling tlie Eskimo carry the quiver l)y aii ivory handle; 
when in use it is hung over the left shoulder. Boas's fig. 4r)l, p. 508, 
represents quiver handles, the first being fashioned in imitation of an 
ermine." * 

" F. Boas, The Central Eskimo, vi Hep. Bur. Mthnol., p. 508.

"The quiver of tlie Blackfeet was made from the cougar .skiu and was 
frequently valued at one liorse." * 

Throughout the area of fur-bearing animals the pelt of any one of 
them of sufficient size served as a ([uiver or arrow bag. These are, for 
the most i:)art, slovenly in ai)pearance. But the Blackfeet and other 
Plains tribes formerly made up their bow cases and quivers from large 
skins. In later times leather and cow's hide with the hair on were sub- 
stituted. The elaborate make-up was preserved. 

" The Yurok quiver was made of the skin of the raccoon or marten 
turned wrongside out and suspended by a string-. In the lower end 
moss was stufl'ed as a cushion for the arrow-heads, t The bow was 
stuffed into this bag' with the arrows and the wonder is how a man 
could keej) the bow from destroying the arrows. In traveling, however, 
the bow was held in the left hand. 

NOTES ON THE BOWS, ARROWS, AND QTTIVERS OF VARIOUS TRIBES. 

Baegert says that the shafts of the iSoutliern California arrows consist 
of reeds, Avhicli they straighten ])y the fire. They are above (> spans 
long, and have, at the lower end, a notch to catch the string, and 3 or 4 
feathers about a finger long, not nnich projecting, and let into slits made 
for that purpose. At the ni)i)er end of the shaft a pointed piece of heavy 
wood, a si)aii and a half long, is inserted, bearing usually at its extrem- 
ity a Hint of a triangular shape, almost resembling a serpent's tongue 
and indented like the edge of a saw. The Oalifornians carry their bows 
and arrows always with them, and as they conunence at an early age 
to use these weapons many of them become skillful archers. | (Plate xci, 

XCII.) 

The arms of the Apaches according to Pike are the bow and arrow. 
Their bow forms two demicircles, with a shoulder in the middle; the 
back of it is entirely covered with sinews, which are laid on in so nice 
a manner by the use of some glutinous substance as to be almost 
imperceptible; this gives great elasticity to the weapon. Their arrow 
is more than the "cloth yard" of the English, being 3^ feet long, the 
upper part consisting of some light rush or cane, into which is inserted 
a shaft of about 1 foot made of some hard, seasoned light wood; the 
point is of iron, bone, or stone, and Avhen the arrow enters the body, in 
attempting to extract it the shaft [foreshaft] comes out of its socket 
and the point remains in the wound. With this weapon they shoot 
with such force as to go through the body of a man at a distance of 
100 yards. § 

"The Apache arrow was composed of three distinct parts — the reed, 
the stem, and the barb; the last affixed to the stem, and the stem, of

hard wood, inserted in the reed, and both hekl firmly in place by liga- 
tnres of sinew. The stem was made of a hard wood called kk-ing, and 
the reed in Apache 'klo-ka,' meaning- 'arrow grass.' There is a great 
advantage in the use of this reed, because the arrow afterwards needs 
no straighteuing, whereas the arrows made by the Zunis and others 
must l)e subjected to a special process to make them shoot true. 

"The nse of sinew for securing the barb to the stem was believed to 
be based upon the fact that after the arrow had entered the body the 
warm blood, flowing from the wound, would soften and loosen the sinew, 
disengage the barb, and increase the discomfort, pain, and danger to 
the victim. 

" It may be of interest to students of lingnistics to know that the 
Apache word for l)ullet, ' ka,' is really the word for arrow, aiul much as 
the word has survived the Aveapon itself has survived, because the 
cross section of a ritle bullet, taken along the greater axis, is all the 
same as the same section made on a donble-tnnged arrow."* 

''In the American XafuraUst, vol. XL, p. 264, Mr. Edwin A. Barber 
describes nine different kinds of arrow-heads — leaf-shaped, triangular, 
indented at base, stemmed, barbed, beveled, diamond-shaped, awl- 
shai)ed, shaped like a serpent's head. 

"All the above forms maybe found in use among the Apaches to-day. 
The same warrior may have in his (piiver representatives of several 
types, sometimes serrated, sometimes non-serrated, but all deadly. 
Arrows intende<l sim])ly for the killing of birds or small game were not 
always barbed, but were generally provided with a cross piece about 
2 inches below the tip. [This same sto]) is found in Cauadn.] 

"The arrow of the Apache sometimes terminates in a triangular 
]nece of hard wood, which seems to be perfectly effective as a weapon. 
One set of these is now in my possession, made of Florida orange 
wood by Koth li, a Chiricahua prisoner confined at Fort Marion. 

"Just such arrows were observed by Columbus upon first reaching 
this continent. 'They carry however in lieu of arms, canes dried in 
the sun, on the ends of which they fix heads of wood, dried and sharp- 
ened to a point.' (Letters of Columbus, Ilakluyt See, Loudon, 1847, 
vol. II, p. G.)* 

"Stone arrow-heads Avere made preferably of obsidian (dolguini), 
next of chalcedony, petrified Avood, jasper, or other sili<;eous rock, 
lastly of fragments of beer bottles; but if pieces of hoop iron could be 
picked up they Avere always utilized. 

"Arrows made out of domestic glass Avere described over a cen- 
tury ago by Lawson, in his account of the Carolina Indians. He 
mentions having seen in an Indian toAvn, 'very long arrows headed 
with pieces of glass Avhich they had broken from bottles.' (Quoted by 
Squier and Davis, JMounds of the Mississippi Valley, in Hmithsonidn 
Contyihiitions, \o\. Vi, 21.'>; but there the opinion is expressed that these 
may have been obsidian.) 

"It may be well to remember that the Indians of the Soutlnvest 
were perfectly familiar AA'ith obsidian, and that the Apache name for 
glass means obsidian. It may have been only a coincidence, but I do 
not at this moment remember any glass arrows that were not brown 
glass, the nearest apjiroach in appearance to obsidian. I have seen 
the green arrows, but they were made of the semi-i)recious stone called 
aqva marina, found among the Navajoes.

''The process of luaniifaetnre was in each case the same, and con- 
sisted in chipi)ing small fragments from the edges of suitable jneces of 
material, the chii)])ing implement being a portion of hardened deer or 
elk horn held in the right hand, the siliceous stone being held in the 
left over a Hap of buckskin to protect the lingers. 

"I once made it my business to solve the problem how long it would 
take Apaches whose village had been captured and destroyed by troops 
to provide themselves aucM- with weapons which would render them a 
menace to the scattered settlements of the frontier. I singled out an 
Apache at random and stipulated that he should employ no tools of 
iron, but allowed him to gather from the ground such chips of chalced- 
ony as ho pleased.

Indian will spend days aud even weeks upon one piece, unless he is 
alluding to some one making a 'medicine bow and arrows for a si^ecial

"Gen. George Crook, who was a very close observer of the habits 
and customs of the wild tribes among whom he served, relates that the 
Indians of Oregon used obsidian and made the barbs Avith remarkable 
facility and rai>idity, from tifty to sixty in an hour. {ISinithi^oitimi 
Iicport, 1871.) Jle also states that the Klamaths were making their 
arrows of broken Junk bottles, the tool used, a knife in place of a horn, 
and a blanket instead of a buckskin. 

[Captain Bourke is evidently thinking of the making of arrow heads. 
Every tribe of Indians spent days and even weeks upon arrow shafts 
and bows. As in the manufacture of pottery the operation can not be 
finished at a single sitting as has been shown ])revious]y.] 

"The Iloopa Indian, who is a relative of tiie Apache, makes his arrows 
in much the same manner, but the obsidian or jasper head is untanged 
and lashed with sinew.''* 

"Catlin says that every Apache tribe has its factory in which 
arrow-heads are made, and in those only certain adepts are allowed to 
make them for the use of the tribe. Erratic bowlders of flint are col- 
lected (and sometimes luought an immense distance) and broken with 
a sort of sledge-hammer, made of a rounded ]»ebbleof hornstone, set in 
a twisted withe, holding the stone and fonning a handle. 

"The stone, at the indiscriminate blow s of the sledge, is broken into 
a hundred ])ieces, and such Hakes selected a«, from the angles of their 
fracture andthickness, will answer as the basis of an arrow-head; and 
in the hands of the artisan they are shaped into the beautiful forms and 
proportions which they desire, and which are to be seen in most of our 
museums. 

"The master workman, seated on the ground, lays one of these tlakes 
on the palm of his left hand, bidding it firmly down with two or more 
fingers of the same hand, and with his right hand, between the thumb 
and two forefingers, places his chisel (or punch) on the point that is to 
be broken oft; aud a co-operator (a striker) sitting in front of him, with

a mallet of very hard wood, strikes the chisel (or punch) on the upi)er 
end, tlakiug- the Hint ofifou the under side, below each projecting point 
that is struck. The I3int is then turned and chijiped in the same 
manner from the opposite side, and so turned and chipped until the 
required shape and dimensions are obtained, all the fractures being- 
made on the palm of the hand. 

"In selecting a Hake for the arrow-head a nice judgment nuist be 
used or the attempt will fail; a Hake with two opposite parallel or 
nearly parallel i)lanes is found, and of the thickness required for the 
center of the arrow-point. The first chipping reaches near to the center 
of these planes, but without quite breaking it away, and each chipping 
is shorter and shorter, until the shape and the edge of the arrow-head 
are formed. 

"The yielding elasticity of the palm of the hand enables the chip to 
come off without breaking the body of the flint, which would be the 
case if they were broken on a hard substance. These people have no 
metallic instruments to work with, and the instrument (pnnch) which 
they use I was told was a piece of bone; but on examining it I found it 
to be a substance much harder, made of the tooth (incisoi) of the sperm 
whale, or sea lion, which are often stranded on the coast of the Pacific. 
This punch is about (5 or 7 inches in length and 1 inch in diameter, with 
one rounded side and two i)]ane sides; therefore ])resenting one acute 
and two obtuse angles to suit the ])oints to be broken. 

"This operation is very curions, both the holder and the striker sing- 
ing, and the strokes of the mallet given exactly in time with the music, 
and with a sharp and rebounding blow, in which, the Indians tell us, is 
the great medicine (or mystery of the operation). 

"The bows also of this tribe, as well as the arrow-heads, are made 
with great skill, either of wood and covered on the back witli sinew, or 
of bone, said to be brcmght from the sea-coast, and probably from the 
sperm whale. These weapons, nuicli like those of the Sioux and 
Comanches, for use on horseback, are short, for convenience of hand- 
ling, and of great i)ower, generally of 2A feet in length, and their mode 
of using them in war and the chase is not surpassed by any Indians on 
the continent."* 

"The bows of the Beothucs are all of sycamore, which being very 
scarce in their country, and the only wood it produces that is fit for 
this use, becomes very valuable. Mr. Peyton informed Lloyd that their 
bows were roughly made of mountain ash or dogwood ; they were formed 
by splitting the piece of wood selected for the purpose down the middle, 
the round side of which formed the back of tlie bow. The sticks are 
not chosen with any nicety, some of them being knotty and very riule 
in appearance, but they show a considerable amount of c(tnstructive 
skill. Except in the grasp the inside of them is cut flat, but so obli 
quely and with so nmch skill that the string will vibrate in a direc- 
tion coinciding directly with the thicker edge of the bow. The bow 
is fully 5^ feet long. The string was made of deer's sinew. 

"Beothuc arrows were made of jtine (white) or sycanioie, and were 
slender, light, and straight. The head was a two edged lance about (J 
inches long, made of iron taken from the traps, and other objects of 
that metal, which they had stolen from the furriers and fishermen. 

"Cartwright says, in his journal of a residence in Labrador, that the 
head of the arrow was a barbed lance G inches long made out of an old

nail let into ii cleft in the top of the shaft, and secured there by a thread 
of deer's sinew. The stock Avas about 3 feet iu length. It was feathered 
with the 'gray goose wing.' They also use the feathers of the 'gripp,' 
or sea eagle, on their arrows."* 

This testimony is of the same character as that relating to John 
Smith. The Beothucs did not belong to any of the great Indian families 
known, but were a stock apart. The rudeness of manufacture is also 
noticeable in contrast with those of the Eskimo. 

"The weapons used in the loway tribe, and of whii li these people 
have brouglit many, are very similar to those used in most of the 
uncivilized tribes of iforth America, consisting of the bow and arrows, 
the lance and the javelin, Avar-clubs, kuives, etc., and with these, as a 
protection in battle, a leathern shield, made of the hide of the buft'alo 
bull, sufficiently thick and hard to arrest an arrow or to turn the blade 
of a lance." t 

The loways belong to the Siouan stock and their arrows are a shaft, 
iron head, and three tolerably long feathers. The nock is either bulbous 
or flaring, affording a grip for the thumb and fore finger. The quiver 
is an elaborate affair. Indeed the quivers of the Siouan and other 
stocks preying upon the buffalo were the most complicated on the con- 
tinent. 

The Blackfeet do not make bows of the horn of the elk or of the 
mountain sheep. Their country does not produce any wood suitable 
for bows, and they obtain by barter the bow wood, or yellow wood 
{Madura anrantiaca) from the river Arkansas. For their quivei s they 
prefer the skin of the cougar {Felis co7icolor, Linn). Tlie tail hangs 
down from the quiver, is trimmed with red cloth on the inner side, 
embroidered with white beads and ornamented at the end or elsewhere 
with strij)s of skin-like tassels. 

" I saw few lances among the Blackfeet, but umm war clubs which 
they have taken from the Flatheads. Many have thick leather shields 
painted green and red, and hung with feathers and other things." | 

All the Sioux tribes use a short arrow, with long shaftment bearing 
three eagle feathers. The shafts were marked with the lightning fur- 
rows, and streaked in different colors. The Sioux procured iron cen- 
turies ago and substituted it for the stone head. One of the rarest 
specimens in any museum is a Sioux arrow with a jasjer i)oint. 

Mr. Dorsey says tluit the Omaha use the following as their arrow- 
measures: From the inner angle of the elbow to the tip of the middle 
finger, and thence over the back of the hand to the wrist bone. 

"When in need of arrow points the Sioux Avoiild take his rawhide or 
buckskin sack or bag and go in search of the above-mentioned stones; 
when found would take another heavy stone, and by striking and break- 
ing the stone, would gather the fragments that would serve for arrow 
or spear points. Those flakes which required less work in trimming or

chii)piiig would be placed in bis sack, aud when enough were collected 
he would take tliein to his lodge to fashion. Plolding the arrow, spear, 
or knife piece in his hand, he would chip carefully with another flint or 
iron rock, or placing- the sharp edge against the projecting piece or par- 
ticle to be removed, being carelul in only chipjiing or forcing off sufficient 
to make the stone in proper shape, with sharp edge and point. They 
made the grooves in war clubs, axes, hammers, or bone breakers by 
constant pecking. 

"There was another kind of arrow point they made of which I never 
heard before, .and that was out of the tront part of the foreleg of an 
elk, between fetlock and knee joint. They would take that bone and 
break it, and slivers that would answer were made into arrow points 
by grinding them on a stone. They make a good arrow point, but not 
so strong as the flint points. 

"The stone arrow points were each separately bound with sinews to 
protect them from breaking even in the quiver, and the arrows were 
unwrapped before starting after a herd of buffalo."* 

The unwrapping of the sinew before shooting is quite new testimony, 
but Mr. Allen has lived on the frontier many years in Montana. 

"Among the plains Indians," says Dodge "a good bow takes a long 
time and much labor in its construction. The best wood is the osage 
orange {'bois (Van-'' of the old French trappers, corrupted into 'bow 
dark' by plains Ame^ncaus). This wood grows in comparatively a lim- 
ited area of countrj^, and long journeys are sometimes made to obtain 
it. Only the best are selected, straight, aud as free as possible from 
knots. The seasoning i)rocess is slow and very thorough. A little 
cutting, shaping, and scraping with knife or piece of glass, then a hard 
rubbing wi:h buffalo fat or brains, and the stick is put aside in a warm 
place, to bt^ worked at again in a few days or 'weeks. A good bow 
with fair usage will last many years, but it is liable to be broken at 
any time by accident. Each warrior, therefore, possesses several sticks 
of bow wood in various stages of completion. 

"The strings are formed of closely-twisted fibers of the sinews of 
animals. These sinews are cut out their full length. Each is then sub- 
divided longitudinally into stijings, and these picked and re-picked into 
fibers as fine as hair and as long as possible. With the rude means at 
their disposal it requires no little skill so to put and twist these fibers 
together as to form a string perfectly round and of precisely the same 
size and tension from end to end. 

"The arrows require in the aggregate much more labor than the 
bow. Any hard, tough, straight-grained wood is used. It is scraped 
to proper size and shape, and must be perfectly round. The head is 
either of stone or iron — of late years almost exclusively of iron, for stone 
of the necessary hardness is extremely difficult to work, and twenty or 
more stones ate spoiled or broken for each arrow-head made. 

"Under the most favorable circumstances, however, the most skill- 
ful Indian workman can not hope to complete more than a single arrow 
in a hard day's work. In a short fight, or an exciting dash after game, 
he will expend as many arrows as will keep him busily at work for a 
month to replace.! 

"The constructive industry of the men was confined princiivally to 
the making of arms, bows, arrows, shields, and spears. These were all 
objects in which they took great pride. The favorite material for bows

was hois (Pare [Macluni auyaHtinca). Wlieu these could uot be obtained 
liickory or coffee bean {(ri/i)iiioch(<his C((ii(((h')isi.s) was used. The name 
ti-r((]i-i.s, bow, seem to indicate that bows were once made of bone, the 
ribs of thebuft'alo or other hir^e animal, skillfully fitted and wrapped 
throughout with sinew. Forty years ago bows of this kind, and also 
of elk horn were occasionally found in use. Choice bows were some- 
times nmdeof red cedar, and if carefully used answered well, but were 
extremely liable to be shattered by any rough handling. The making 
of a good bow was a task involving long and painstaking labor. It 
was wrought into shape only a little at a time, being repeatedly oiled 
nu'anwhile, and constantly handled to keei) the wood pliable. When 
tinishe<l the bow was sometimes wra])ped with sinew and its strength 
thereby greatly increased. The string was of sinew from the back of 
the buffalo. As soon as the sinew was taken from the animal the i)ar- 
ticles of tiesh adhering were scraped off and the minute fibres care- 
fully separated. The best of these were selected and twisted into a 
string of uniform size and elasticity. One end of this string was 
fastened securely in place u[K)n the bow, and the other lurnished with 
a loop so adjusted that in an instant, as occasion required, the bow 
might be strung or unstrung. 

'■According to ])unbar much labor was sjtent by the Pawnees in the 
construction of ariows. The shafts were made from sprouts of dog- 
Avood {Cornus stoJ<mifer((). The bark was removed and the rods were 
rubbed between two grooved stones, held firmly together in one hand 
till reduced to a proper size and smoothness. The head, made of hoop 
iron, was then inserted in one end of the shaft and bound in position 
with sinew. The back end of the shaft was now furnished with a triple 
row of feathers attached by means of glue and sinew and the end 
notched to fit the bowspring. With a small chisel-like instrument 
three slight grooves or channels were cut along the shaft between the 
head and the feathers and the arrow was complete. Various reasons 
were assigned for this channeling. Some claimed that it caused the 
arrow to adhere more firndy in the wound; others tliat it was simply 
designed to facilitate the fiow of blood. The ntanufacture of arrows, 
as of bows, was a slow and irksome process. Three or four were prob- 
ably the limit of a day's work, even after the rough nuiterial was 
already at hand. So exact were they in making them that not only 
were the arrows of different tribes readily distinguishable, but even 
individuals could recognize their own arrows Avhen thrown together 
with those of others of the same band. Disputes sometiines arose after 
the slaughter of a herd of buffalo as to whose some particular carcass 
rightfully was. If the arrow still remained in the body the question 
was easily decided by drawing it out and examining tlie make of it. 
Some indians made two kinds of arrows, one for hunting and another 
for war. In the latter the head was so fastened that when an attempt 
was nnide to draw the shaft from a wound the head was detached and 
remained in the body of the victim. The Pawnee never used such. 
When once he had i)ossessed himself of a good bow and a supply of 
arrows the Pawnee was as solicitous in the care of them as a hunter 
would be of a choice rifie. The bow, if not in actual service, Avas kei)t 
close in its case, and the arroAvs in the quiver. Great pains were taken 
that they should not become by any chance wet, and much time Avas 
s])ent handling them, that the bow should not lose its spring and the 
arroAvs should not warp. The average length of the former was 4 feet; 
of the latter 26 inches."*

NORTH AMEIRCAN BOWS, ARROWS, AND QUIVERS. 675 

The case for the bow and the quiver are of the skin of some auiuial, 
often of otter, fastened to each other; and to the latter the tail of the 
animal at full length is appended. The bow is i)artly covered with elk 
horn, has a very strong' string of twisted sinews of animals, and is 
wound round in different places with the same to strengthen it. The 
bow is often adorned with colored cloth, porcupine (quills and white 
strips of ermiue.* 

"The Pawnee bow case and quiver were made of skin, dressed to be 
impervious to moisture. The usual material was elk skin. Indians 
who could afford it sometimes made a (piiver and case of the skin of an 
otter or panther. In removing a skin which was to be used for this 
purpose from the carcass, care was exercised that every particle of the 
skin, that of the head, tail, and even the claws, should be retained, 
and appear in the case when linally nnule up. Cases of this make, 
with their heavy coating of fur virtually waterproof, were very highly 
prized.-'t 

"The bow-makers of both the Ilupa and Klamath tribes," says Ray, 
"are specialists, and the trade is now confined to a. very few old men. 
I have here seen no man under 40 years of age that could make a bow 
or an arrow, and only one old man who could make a stone arrow-head. 

" To make a bow, the wood of a yew sa[)ling l*i to 3 inches in diam- 
eter is selected and rough-hewn to shape, the heart side inward and the 
back carefully smoothed to the form of the back of the bow. The sinew 
is laid on while the wood is green and held in place until dry by means 
of a twine wrapping. In this condition it is hung in the sweat house 
until the wood is thoroughly seasoned, when it is flnislied and strung, 
and in some cases the back is varnished and painted. The most deli- 
cate part of the operation is to get the proper tension on the sinew 
backing. If too tight the wood crimps or S])linters when the bow is 
strung, and a lack of proper tension leaves the bow weak and w<n'th- 
less. When the bow is seasoned it has a reverse curve of about 3 
inches. 

"The sinew for the backing and bow-string is taken from the back 
and the hind leg of the deer at the time of killing, and dried for future 
use. When required it is soaked until jdiable, stripped into line shreds 
and laid on by commencing at each end and terminating at the center 
of the bow. The sinew is slightly twisted and dried before it is placed 
on the bow. 

"The glue used to fix the backing is obtained by boiling the gland 
of the lower jaw and the nose of the sturgeon. This is dried in balls 
and preserved for use, and is prepared by simply dipping it in warm 
water and rubbing it on the wood. 

"The arrow shafts are usually made from the wood of the wild cur- 
rant, and are worked to shape with a knife and tried by the eye. After 
roughing they are allowed to season and are tiien finished. Any curves 
are taken out with a straightener, made of a piece of hard wood, spindle 
shai^ed and perforated in the ndddle. The arrow-heads used in war 
and for big game are usually made from Hint and obsidian, and more 
recently of iron and steel. The flakes for the stone heads are knocked 
off' by means of a pitching tool of a deer antler. The stone heads are 
made with a chipper composed of a crooked handle, to which is lashed

Point Barrow. The work is hekl in the left hand on a pad and Haked

ner as 1 found the Innuits doing in northern Alaska. 

"The bows made by these people are effective for game up to 50 or 
75 yards, and Avould inflict a serious Avound at 100 yarcls. At 50 yards 
the arrows will penetrate a. deer from 5 to 10 inches. 1 never heard of 
one passing entirely through a deer.* 

"Eells says that "'bows and arrows are used at present by the Twana 
in Washington state only as playthings, and are very poor; but form- 
erly they were very common. The bows were about 3 feet long, and 
were made of yew wood, the strings of sinews or the intestines of rac- 
coons. The arrows were about 2J feet long, were made of cedar, with 
feathered shafts, and points of stone, and of nails, after they obtained 
them; and the quiver of wolf skin. Arrow-heads are sometimes made 
of brass or iron, 2 or 3 inches long, half an inch wide, and very thin, 
and also of very hard wood, 5 inches long, and round. Sometimes, for 
birds, they are nmdc of iron-wood, about 5 inches long, with two prongs, 
one of them being half an inch shorter than the other. "t 

According" to Capt. Wilkes the Klamet bows and ariows^ are made 
the tirst of yew about 3 feet long, flat, li to 2 inches wide, backed with 
sinew and painted. The arrows are over 30 inches long, some of close- 
grained wood, a species of Spiraea, others of reed. Feathers are 5 to 8 
inches long. The barbed head of obsidian is inserted in a fore shaft 3 
to 5 inches long. This is left in the wound. Shallow blood channels 
are sometimes cut in the shaft. The bow is held horizontally, braced 
by the thumb of the left hand and drawn by the thumb and three lin- 
gers of right hand. The chest is thrown back and the right leg for- 
ward in shooting. Quivers are of deer, raccoon, or Avild-cat skins.J 

The Clallam bows were short and small, nuide of yew. The arrows 
were small and pointed with bone or iron.§ The Clallanis are one of 
the Salishan tribes from whom Wilkes gathered manj'^ bows and 
arrows, now in the iSIational Museum. The arrow shafts are of cedar, 
and have a large, bulbous nock, wra])ped with birch bark. Some of 
them have two-barbed points of wood, bone, or metal. 

Bows of the Shush wap were formerly made chiefly of wood of the 
juniper {Juniperxs oecideiitaJis), named poontlp. They were also some- 
times made of yew {Taxus hrcvifolia), named skin-ik, though this tree 
is scarcely to be found in the Shushwap country. It is reported how- 
ever to grow far up in the North Thompson Valley. The bow was often 
covered on its outer surface with the skin of a rattlesnake, which was 
glued on in the same manner which was customary among some of the 
tribes of the Great Plains. Arrows were made of the wood of the serv- 
ice berry. Arrow-heads and spear-heads were made of various kinds 
of stone, always chipped. ||

"The arrows and spears in Puget Sound were usually i)ointed v\'ith 
bone; the bows were of yew, and though short, were of great i)0wer. 
Vancouver desciibes a superior bow used at Puget Sound. It was 
from 2i to 3 feet long, nuide from a naturally curved piece of yew, 
whose concave side became the convex of the bow, and to the whole 
length of this side a strip of elastic hide or serpent skin was attached 
so tirndy l)y a. kind of cement as to become ahnost a part of the wood. 
This lining added greatly to the strength of tlie bow, and was not att'ec- 
ted by moisture. The bowstring was made of sinew." Vancouver's

where." (Vancouver's Fo^/., vol. ii, p. 81; Wilkes's -tVar. m V. S. Ex-

Lieut. Allen, IT. S. Army, has described tlKi excessive pains which the 
Copper River Indians bestow upon the fashioning and caring for their 
bows. There are no iirst rate, tough, elastic woods near them. Birch 
and willow and such soft s[>ecies are theonlj' stock in trade. And yet, 
by dint of heating or toasting, boiling, greasing, and rubbing down 
they convert these poor materials into ex3ellent arms. It is here that 
the wooded wrist guard or l)ridge is attached to the grip on the inside. 

The Hong Kutchin Indians (Athapascan faunly) closely allied with 
Lieut. Allen's people, make their bows of willow after the same pains- 
taking fashion, and their arrows of pine. The bows are almost straight, 
and in order to prevent the string from lacerating the wrist they do not 
wear a wrist guard, but lash a bit of wood to the inside of the grip [see 
Plate II). The Kutchin tribes all use a similar bow, but do without the 
guard. The quiver is simply a bag of skin worn under the left arm. 
It has two loops for the bow and the arrows are inserted notch down.| 

"The arrow-heads of the Kutchin are of bone for wild fowl, or bone 
tipl)ed with iron for moose or deer; the bow is al)out 5 feet long, and 
that of the Hong-Kutchin is furnished with a small piece of wood 3 
inches long by 1^ broad, and nearly 2 tliick, which ])rq)ects close to the 
part grasped by the hand. This piece catches the string and prevents 
it from striking the hand, for the bow is not bent much. There are no 
individuals whose trade is to make spears, bows, or arrows."

" The Kutcliin still retain the bow, which is of the same shape 
through all the tribes, with the exception of the small guard in the 
Hong-Kutchin bow, mentioned before. The quiver is the same, and 
worn under the left arm; it is furnished with two small loops to hold 
the bow, thus leaving' the hunter both hands free to use his gmi. The 
arrows are i)laced in the quiver with the notch downwards. The Kut- 
cliin are not expert with the bow; uo doubt they were better shots 
before firearms were introduced among' them. The bowis made of willow 
and will not send an arrow with sufficient force to hill a deer more than 
from rA) to (!0 yards. The arrows are luade of piue.''* 

Father Morice says that " the ouly])ursuit for which our l^ene may be 
said to have been amply provided with homemade implements was 
war and its allied occupation, hunting-. The offensive weapons in use 
among them were arrows, sjiears, lances, and cas.se-tetcs. 

"The only really polished stone implement of Dene manufacture 
was the Cia'IJt or cas-sr tcie. The specinuMi illustrated is of a hard gran- 
ite stone. A variety of that weapon, similar in form, but more elon- 
gated (being' at least twice as long) was usually made of cariboo horn. 

"Apart from the common arrows, the Carriers made use of two other 
varieties of missiles of Sekanais origin. The heads of both kinds were 
made from cari1)oo horn. The first of these, called lir<ich(U'nl:ic((elh (cut 
arrow) by the Carriers, was conical in form and not less than (> inches 
in length. The broader extremity thereof was hollowed out to receive 
a wooden shaft which served to dart it off from the bow like a common 
arrow, with this difference, however, that when in motion the horn ]>oint 
detached itself from the shaft. This ]m>jectile was deadly, and intended 
only f<n- use against an enemy or for killing' huge game. To shootsmaller 
game, such as grouse, rabbits, etc., they ha<l recourse to a curiously- 
wrought trii)le arrow head consisting' of three flat pieces of bone or horn 
triangular in shape and not unlike the feathers on a sea-otter arrow. 
These plates were seized to the arrow shaft in several places by sinew 
passing' through the i>lates and around the wood. The manner of fast- 
ening to the sliaft was similar to that delinerited in ^Nlorice's tig. 14.'' 

The knives were ordinarily made of the conunon arrow-head tlint, but 
those of beaver teeth were more esteemed. 

'' Their arrow, common arrow heads, a\ ere of two kinds, bone and 
Hint. The first were nmde of the front teeth of the beaver, reduced 
by scraping' to the required shape. They were reputed the most effec- 
tive. Flint arrow-heads were of diiferent sizes, forms, and material. 
They are produced in Morice's paper for the sake of comparison with 
those used by the moniid-bnildeis of Illinois and other States of the 
American Union Mith which they will be found identical in shape and 
material, though a distance of at least L*,()0() miles separate the Abori- 
gines who made them. He says the 'two marked A and I> may be 
described as the typical arrow-heads of the Western Denes, and are of 
the blackish resonant Hint, generally used in the falnication of alxn-i- 
ginal Mcapons. C and D are comi)osed of a semi translucent bluish 
variety of siliceous stone not so common and consequently more i)rized 
thai: tlie ordinary arrow-Hint. E represents the most beautiful of all 
the Dene arrow-heads in my possession. It has been ingeniously 
chipped from a hard cryst;illine species of dint, and its form and finish 
display evidences of, I should say, exct])ti()nally good workmanship. 
Some are also formed of a whitisli siliceous pebble; but the points 
made therewith are, as a rule, of a rather rough description.' "

NORTH AMERICAN BOWS, ARROWS, AND QUIVERS. 679 

" The regular liuntiiio- or war bow of the Tse'kehiie was of niouutam 
maple (Acer glabrum. Tow) and 5i feet or more in length. The edges, 
both inner and outer, were smoothened over so as to permit of strips of 
uuplaited sinew being twisted around to insure therefor the necessary 
strength. These jneces of sinew were fastened on with a glue obtained 
from the sturgeon sound, which also did service for all kinds of gluing 
l)urposes among each of the three tribes, while still in their prehistoric 
period. The central part of the bow, which w^as so thick as to ap])ear 
almost rectangular, was tinally covered with a tissue of differently- 
tinged porcupine quills. 

"Great care was taken to obtain a bow-string impermeable to snow 
and rain. With this object in view, delicate threads of sinew were 
twisted together and afterwards rubbed over with sturgeon glue. 
Tins first string was then gradually strengthened by additional sinew 
threads twisted annind the iirst and main cord, each overlaying of 
sinew being thoroughly saturated with glue. Finally when the string 
had attained a sufticient thickness for efficient service it was repeat- 
edly rubbed over with gum of the black pine {Ahics Ixdsanica). 

"A less elaborate bow (tig. 'M) is still to this very day in use among 
the Tse'kehne in connection with the blunt arrow already mentioned. 
It is of seasoned willow (.SVf/ a; longifolia), and being devoid of any 
sinew backing or other strengthening device, its edges are more angular 
than those of tig. 30. Its string consists merely of a double line of 
cariboo skin slightly twisted together. The specimen tigured above 
measures 4 feet 10 inches. 

"The Carrier bow was never much more than 4 feet in length, and 
the woodeu part of it wns invariably juniper {J. occideiitalis). Instead 
of being twisted around as in the Tse'kehne bow, the threads of sinew 
were glued on the back after the fashiou of the Eskimo bow, w ith this 
difference, however, that in the Carrier weapon the sinew was not 
plaited. When a layer of thin sinew^ strips had been fastened length- 
wise on the entire back of the bow% it was allowed to dry, after wiiich 
others were successively added until the desired strength had been 
obtained. A process analogous to that whereby the Tse'kehne bow- 
string was made was followed in cording the string of the Carrier bow.""* 

"The most powerful as w'ell as most artistic weapon is the bow. 
It is made of beech or si)ruce in three pieces, curving in opposite 
direction, and ingeniously bound by twisted sinews, so as to give the 
greatest possible strength. Arrows, as well as spears, lances, and 
darts, are of white spiuce, and pointed with b<me, ivory, tiint, and 
slate. 

"They have two sorts of bows, arrows pointed with iron, tiint, and 
bone, or blunt for birds. {Sinipfion Nar., 123.) 

"They ascended the Mackenzie in former times as far as the Ram- 
parts to obtain tlinty slate for lance and arrow-points. (Richardson's 
Jo«r., vol. I, p. 213.) 

"One weapon was a walrus tooth fixed to the end of a wooden staff. 
(Beechey's 1 >>//., vol. i, p. oVo.) 

"At ('oppermine liiver arrows arc ])(>inte<l witli slate or copper.

Hupa arrow-uiaker (Athapascan stock), northern California. The same outfit Avould 

do for any other craftsman of this class throughout the temperate regions of North 

America, only the form of the tool would be changed. 

Fig. 1. The shaft. A simple twig or rod or switch of any suitable wood. If the 
pith be thick, the rod is treated much as a reed. If it be meager the twig 
may be whittled away at certain parts to change the form. Among certain 
tribes the arrow shafts are made of sections split from large sticks. 

Fi<i, L'. The point. The material is as varied as stone with couchoidal fracture 
may be. Spalls are struck off and made into arrowheads by a multitude 
of processes explained in the text.

saved up for future use. 

Fk;. 4. Gum. The exudations from trees or glue from fish or animal substances used 
to hold the feather to the shaft, the head in its place, or to smear over th^ 
sinew seizing to give it a smooth and homogeneous appearance. 

Fig. 5. Paint moktar. The j>aint mortars of the American aborigines are discoidal 
stones usually, with a shallow cavity. In this cavity ochers and other

glue, used like a tinner's soldering iron. 

Figs. 3 and 4. Akkowhead chippers. Showing |the primitive method of joining 
the working parts to the handle. One point is a bit of bone, the other a 
rod of soft iron, which in this example replaces one of bone or antler. 

Fig. 5. The Pitching tool. A column of antler used like a cold chisel in knocking 
oS' spalls or flakes or blades by means of some kind of hammer. 

Figs. 6 and 7. Rasping and polishing stones. All the American tribes used coarse 
sandstone for wood rasps, and in the making of arrow shafts cut grooves in 
the rasp to give rotundity to the wood. The polishing was done with finer 
sandstone, shagreen, siliceous grass, etc. 

Fi«i. S. Glue shell. An implement made of muscle shell woru over the finger and 
employed in smoothing down glue and sinew on bows and arrows.

EXPLANATION OF PLATK XL VI. 

SiouAN Arrows, Dakota Tribks. 

Fig. 1. Shaft, of osier. Shaftmeut, banded with red. Feathers, three, seized with 
sinew at the eud and shorn neatly on the onter edges. Near the nock of 
the arrow is an ornamental feather in the feathering, produced by leaving 
the plume on both sides of the rib of the feather for about an inch, so that 
the arrow at this point appears to have six feathers. The nock is slightly 
spreading; notch, U-shaped. No head. Total length of shaft, 27| inches. 
Cat. No. 21286, IT. S. N. M. Sioux Indians, Miunesota. Collected l>y Rev. Geo. 
Aiuslie. 

Fig. 2. On this arrow a pj^ramidal piece of bone serves for a head, and the shaftment 
IS striped with blue and re<l. This specimen is iigured for the purpose of 
showing oddities of form since the adoption of the rille. Neither of these 
arrows, probably, was ever used. Among the Plains Indians the ii'on 
arrowhead was introduced many years ago, and samples with stone heads 
are extremely rare and quite open to suspicion. Leugth, 24 inches. 

Cat. No. 8439, U. S. N. M. Sioux Indians, Fort Berthold. Collected by Drs. Gray 
and Matthews, U. S. Army. 

Fig. 3. Shaft, a rod of osier; blood streaks, very jagged. Feathers, three, seized 
with sinew, loosely wrapped, glued to the shaftment, and there are streaks 
of blue paint drawn between the featherings. The nock is bulbous; the 
notch is widely angular. Head, of chalcedony, notched on the sides and 
glued into a notch in the end of the shaft. The seizing is gone from this 
arrow, but the notches in the side of the head, as well as the clean appear- 
ance of the shaft, indicate that it was once present. 

Fig. J. Shaftment, a delicate rod of osier; blood streaks, wavy. Shaftment tapering 
toward the nock. Feathers, three, seized at the end Avith sinew and stand- 
ing off from the .shaftment. Nock, slightly expanding; notch, swallow- 
tail-shaped. Head, a piece of wire driven into the eud of the shaft, very 
neatly seized with sinew, and sliarpened at the point. Length, 26 inches. 
Cat. No. 2466, TJ. S. N. M. Sioux Indiau.s. Collected by Br. Washington Matthews, 
U. S. Army. 

Fig. 5. Shaft, of osier. Shaftment, banded with red. Feathers, three, seized at 
each end with sinew and glued. The nock is swallowtail-shaped; notch, 
angular. In the arrows of the Sioux the nock is usually very much 
Avidened out at the extremity, giving the warrior a tirm grip in releasing. 
Head, of obsidian, rudely chippe<l and inserted into the notch in the end 
of the shaft. In the companion to this arrow the blood streaks are slightly 
jagged. The head is of white jasper and the featlier is lOi mclies long. 
Length, 24 inches. Length of feathers, 10 niches.

EXPLANATION OF PLATE XL VI I. 
SiouAX Arrows, Nebraska and Dakota. 

Fig. 1. Shaft, of osier. The shaftment is ilecorated with alternate hands of red, 
hlue, and yellow. The shaftmont is cut away at the outer end so as to 
leave the nock a projecting cylinder and give a better grip to the fingers 
in discharging the arrow. Notch, U-shaped. The head, a slender blade 
of iron let into a "saw cut" in the end of the shaft, the two lips of this cut 
being shaved down neatly so as to form no impediment to the progress of 
the arrow. This is a very delicate and effective weapon. The iron blade 
is slightly barbed at the base. Length of shaft, 26 inches. 

Cat. No. 76831, V. S. N. M. Sioux Indians, ^Nebraska. Collected by Governor 
Furness. 

Fig. 2. Shaft, of hard wood. Shaftment ornamented with yellow and red bands. 
Feathers, seized with sinew, held on spirally, and glued to the shaftment. 
It is difficult to say whether this spiral arrangement was designed to make 
the arrow spin through the air. Authorities differ on this point, and the 
object of direct flight at close range would be more than canceled by the 
disadvantage ofuutangling a revolving arrowhead in the hair of the buffalo 
or deer. The nock is bulbous; notch, angular. Head, a diamond-shajjed 
blade of sheet iron, inserted into the end of the shaft, and seized with sinew. 
Length of feathers, 7-k inches ; total length of shaft, 26 inches. 
Cat. No. 131356, V. S. N. M. Collected by lilis. A. C. Jackson. 

Fig. '.^. Shaft, of hard wood; point of iron, long triangle, inserted into the saw cut in 
the head and seized with sinew. Feathers, three, glued on, seized at the 
ends with sinew aud trimmed down. The shaftment is ornamented with 
a blue band. The nock is fish-tail pattern. Shaft streaks sinuous. Other 
arrows from this same tribe have different colored bands in the shaftment. 
Length of shaft, 2 feet 3 inches. 

Cat. No. 8418, U. S. N. M. Gros Ventres, Siouau stock. Collected by L)r. Matthews, 
F. S. Army. 

Fig. 4. Blood streaks, quite straight. Feathers, three, glued to the shaft, and seized 
with sinew. The strips of sinew Avith Avhich the Sioux Indians lash their 
featherings are much broader than those used by the West Coast ludians, 
and very often are laid on like an open spiral or coil. The feathers are 
.shorn. Nock, spreading; notch, shallow. Head, diamond-shaped, the mar- 
gins of the inner half being filed like a saw. The head is inserted in the 
end of the shaft and seized with sinew. Total length of shaft, 25 inches.

FlG. r>. Example of arrows from the Sioux Indians by the I^. S. "Weather Bureau. 
This large number of arrows promiscuously gathered affords an excellent 
opportunity for studying the lines within which the bands aud tribes of 
the same family vary their arrows. The shafts are all slender, made of 
Lard wood. Some have shaft streaks, others none. They vary also in the 
number of streaks on the shaft and their form, whether straight, sinuous, 
or zigzag. These arrows differ also in the length and form of the points, 
in the length, attachment, and ornamentation of the feather, Imt all have 
the wide lish-tail nock, and this seems to be an unvarying (iiuxlity in Sioux 
arrows.

quite close to the midrib. Nock, cylindrical ; notch, U-shaped. Foreshaft, 
of hard wood, painted red, sharpened, inserted into the end of the .shaft, 
and seized with sinew. Head, an extremely delicate point of obsidian, 
triangular, inserted into a notch in the end of the shaft, and seized with 
sinew diagonally laid on notches on the sides of the arrowhead. Total 
length of shaft, 30 inches.

ity. The shaftinent i.s ornamented with zigzag lines in the same colors. 
Featlier.s, three, glned to the shaftmeut aud, seized at either end with sinew. 
Nock, cylindrical ; uotch, very slight. Head, of obsidian, slender, sagittate 
in form ; the tang inserted in a slit at the extremity of the shaft and seized 
with sinew. This shaft has ab.arli of very narrow regnlar grooves around 
the upper extremity, as though produced by a lathe. This feature is com- 
mon to many California .•urows. Total leugth of shaft, 29 inches. 

Cat. No. 126517, TJ. S. N. M. niii)a Indians. California. CoUeoted liy Capt. P. H. 
Kay, IJ. S. Array. 

Fig. 4. Shaft, a rod. Shaftment, striped with green. Feathers, three, seized at 
the ends witli sinew and laid flat ou the shaftment. Nock, cylindrical; 
notch, U-shaped. Head, of gray chert, long, and delicately inserted in the 
end of the shaft by a seizing which passes around the deep notches at the 
sides. Total length, 34 inches. The shafts of the California arrows are of 
wild currant, rhus, willow, and other straight twig-like stalks. 

Cat. No. 131110, V. S. N. M. Pitt Indian.s, California. Collected by N. .J. Purcell. 

Fig. 5. Shaft, a rod; striped with narrow bauds of blue and red and the natural 
color of the wood. Feathers, three, neatly shorn, seized with sinew and 
glued fast to the shaftment. The sinew is colored with a red paint 
resembling shellac. Nock, cylindrical ; notch, shallow. Foreshaft, of hard 
wood, painted blue, inserted in the end of the shaft and .seized with sinew. 
In many of the California arrows the foreshafts have been revolved between 
two coarse pieces of sandstone, or by means of a file cut so as to give the 
!ip])e.arance of being neatly seized with A^ery line thread. It also confers a 
suspicion of machinery ou some of these later examples. The head is of 
jasper, triangular, delicate, tapering, deeply notched on the side, and held 
in place by a diagonal lashing of sinew. Other specimens from the same 
quiver have heads of chalcedony, the edges of which are beautifully ser- 
rated. Total length, 31 inches.

Fio. 6. This figure shows the v.ariety of arrow points in use among the Indians of 
Upper California. Glass, obsidian, steel, iron points, and wooden foreshaft 
sharpened, together with others in the same plate, give an understand- 
ing of the various ways of attaching the arrowhead to the shaft and fore- 
shaft.

Fig. 1. The shaft is spindle-shaped, taperiug to the nock. Feathers, two, held on 
flat and seized with pack thread. Nock, expanding; notch, angular. 
Head, a bit of iron wire, inserted in the end of the shaft, which has been 
pointed for the purpose, aud expanded at the end into a leaf-shaped blade. 
In some samples the barbs have been cut into this leaf shape partlj-^ by 
means of a filing, to enable the hunter to retrieve his game the better. 
The total length of the shaft is 28 inches.

Fig. 2. Similar to fig. 1 in every respect, excepting the jioint. There are endless 
varieties in these. 

Fig. 3. Stem, a single rod or twig. Point of brown bottle glass inserted into a notch 
in the end of the shaft and held in place by a broad baud of sinew. Feath- 
ers, three, seized at the end with sinew. Shaftment painted red. The 
notch siiuilar to those of the Chinese arrows. Length of arrow, 31| inches. 
Cat. No. 76021, U. .S. N. M. Tribe unknown, probably Central California. 

Fig. 4. Shaft, of spruce. Feathers, three, seized with sinew. Nock, cylindrical; 
notch, angular. The point is a slender spindle of hard wood inserted into 
the end of the shaft, seized with sinew, and sharpened at the point. This 
is a very delicate aud effective weapon. Total length, 25 inches.

Fig. 5. Shaft, of twig. Shaftment striped with narrow bands of red and blue. 
Feathers, three, glued to the shaftment. Nock, cylindrical ; notch, very 
shallow. The head consists of a stone blade and a barb piece of bone. 
The barb piece is inserted in the end of the shaft and seized with sinew. 
The barbs are f of an inch long. The stone blade, of red jasper, is fastened 
to the bone barb piece by a diagonal lashing of sinew. This device is for 
the purpose of retrieving. If shot into a fish it enables the hunter to 
secure the animal and free the arrow. If shot at a burrowing animal aud 
the creature escapes into its hole the hunter has a means of recovering the 
game. Total length of shaft, 30 inches. The adjoining figure on the left 
is of the same type Avith different ribbon.

Fig. 1. Shaft, of cedar, 23^ inches long and i inch thiclc. A streak of red around 
the middle and either end. The sliaftment is somewhat Hat, and orna- 
meuted with two narrow stieaks of red and one bright streak of blue. 
Feathers, three, two black and one banded brown and white; the ends 
inserted into. slits cut in the shaft and seized with sinew poorly laid on. 
The middle portions of the feathers are not glued to the arrow. The nock 
is Hat, in a plane with the head, and is simply notched. The barb piece 
of bone is 8 inches long and is let into a socket in end of arrow shaft. It 
has a strong barb on one side at right angles to the head. It is ornamented 
with deep longitudinal farrows. The triangular head of bone is a flat 
blade inserted neatly in a deep slit at the head of the barb piece, which 
is smoothed down so as to present no impediment to the passage into the 
animal struck. 

Cat. No. 127627, U. S. N. M. Alaska. Collected by J. W. Johnson. 

Fig. 2. Shaft, of spruce, cylindrical; coarsely made ; banded with red paint. Feath- 
ers, three, seized with sinew, one of them at the middle of the flat side 
and the other two at the round corners of the other side. As usual with 
the Eskimo, the end of these feathers is sunk into notches cut in the soft 
wood. The nock is flat; the notch, angular. There is a barb piece of 
bone set into the shaft, at the end, by a cylindrical tenon, and is seized 
with sinew. Blade, of iron, set into the barb piece at right angles to the 
plane of its longest diameter and cross section. One barb in the side of 
the barb piece. Total length, 28 inches.

Feathers, three, seized with sinew thread and standing oft" quite a distance 
from the sliaftment. The nock is flat; notch, angular. Blade, of slate, 
inserted into the end of the barb piece of bone. The single barb is 1|- 
inches long and is formed on one side by a narrow notch. Two shallow 
gutters extend from this barb to the end of the shaft. The barb piece is 
fitted into the end of the shaft by a dowel or peg made of bone and lashed 
with a fine sinew thread. The blade is covered by a cap made of two 
pieces of cedar neatly cut for the blade and the end of the barb piece and 
joined together with a braid of sinew. This is a very effective and neatly- 
made weapon. Total length of shaft, 30 inches. 

Cat. No. 90404, T'. S. N. M. Kadiak. Alaska. Collected by ATm. J. Fisher. 

Fig. i. Shaft, of cedar; al)out half an inch in diameter in the middle, tapering 
slightly forward to within two inches of the end, where it is cylindrical, 
and tapering backward gradually to the nock. Feathers, three, laid on 
at ecmal distances apart and seized with fine sinew thread. The plume of 
the feather is neatly cut into a triangular shape. The .sliaftment is painted 
red. The nock is a bulb of extraordinary size, which gives the hunter all 
the griji he could ask. Notch, shallow and angular. Foreshaft, of bone, 
let into the end of the shaft by a dowel cut on the end of the bone. A 



Explanation of Plate LII — Continued. 

small wooden plug is inserted into the front end of this and perforated. 
The head is a small triangular piece of bone, barbed on one side, cut away 
at the butt to form a very short dowel to be inserted into the perforation 
in the shaftment^ and perforated near the base to receive a lanyard or 
martingale of braided sinew, which, near the other extremity, has two 
branches, one of which is attached to the front of the shaft and the other 
towards the butt end. This arrow operates in the following manner: 
When this line is unrolled it resembles a kite's tail — the bird to which the 
barb is attached representing the tail and the spreading bifurcation the 
point attached to the kite. This line is neatly rolled uji on the shaft to 
the end of the foreshaft. The barbed head is then put in place ; the line 
tucked under the coil and drawn tight, but not ffistened. The hunter 
shoots the game with this arrow; tbe barb penetrates beneath the skin; 
the sudden movement of the sea otter withdraws the barb head from 
the foreshaft and loosens the slight fastening of the coil, which is then 
unrolled, and the bone head, being heavier, sinks in the water, while 
the light shaft supports the feather above the surface, the whole appa- 
ratus acting as a drag to the game and also as a buoy to enable the hunter 
to follow. Total length of shaft. 34J inches. 

Cat. No. 10^07, IT. S. N. M. Kadiak, Alaska. Conccted by W. H. Dall. 

Fig. 5. Shaft, of spruce, cylindrical. Shaftment, llattened. Three black feath- 
ers, seized with sinew. The nock is Hat; notch, rectangular. The l)arbed 
head is leaf-shaped, with two small barbs on one side and one on the other. 
The head is fitted into the end of the shaft, Avhich is seized with sinew. 
Length, 33^ inches.

Fig. 6. Shaft, of spruce wood, cylindrical. Shaftment, flattened. Feathers, three, 
seized at one end with sinew and at the other with siuew thread. The 
feathers are laid on at the round corners of the flattened shaftment, so that 
really there could have been another feather at one of the corners. The 
nock is flat; the notch of the usual U shape. Foreshaft, of walrus ivory, 
one end cut into the shape of a tenon and inserted in the end of tbe shaft 
and seized with sinew thread. The front end of this shaft is jierforated 
and into this is inserted a plug of soft wood. The delicate head has two 
barbs on either side, and a perforation through the body for holding a 
sinew cord, which attaches it to the shaft. The head is loosely fltted into 
the foreshaft by a conical tang. This weapon is shot from a bow into a 
sea otter or other game. The barbed head becomes fastened in the skin 
and withdraws from the foreshaft. The ivory head sinks in the water, 
leaving a feathered shaft bobbing in the air. The whole acts as a drag 
upon the game and also enables the hunter to follow. Length of shaft 
and foreshaft, 31i inches.

Fig. 1. Shaft, of spruce wood, tapering from the bead backwards to a point, to 
which a single feather is fastened by a seizing of sinew. The point, of 
walrus ivory, inserted in a split in the end of the shaft, and seized with 
sinew. Other specimens of these darts are eizedwith a fine rawhide line 
of babiche. Length of shaft and point, 19 inches.

Fig. 3. Shaft, of pine, short and thick. Head, of bone, spatulate and spliced on to 
the shaft and held in place hy sinew. In the specimens of this type made 
after contact with the whites the type of this sjjatulate point has a saw 
cut across the end, into which a blade of iron is inserted and held in place 
by a rivet. The connection between these two forms should be especially 
noted, as the more recent could not be explained without comparison with 
the ancient form. Length of shaft, 1 foot 5^ inches; foreshaft, 5 inches.

Fig. 1. The shaft tapers both ways from the middle aud is Ihittened at the nock. 
Feathers, two, laid on spirally and seized at the end with sinew. Nock, 
flat; notch, U-shaped. The blade of the head is sagittate, and there are 
two barbs on each side of the tang, which is inserted in the end of the 
shaft and seized with sinew. Length, 29 inches. 

Cat. No. 72765, TJ. S. N. M.; also 72759. Ooglaamie Eskimo, Point Barrow. Col- 
lected by Capt. P. H. Ray, U. S. Army. 

There is a great variety of form iu this class of arrows, the design being always 
the same. In one specimen the tang is cylindrical and a series of barbs is tiled on 
the edges of the blade. In another the tang is made of walrus ivory, and the iron 
blade inserted into the end of this tang has barbs on the lower edges of the blade. 
In another specimen one-half of a pair of scissors is used as a head. The part in 
front of the hinge, tiled with two edges, forms the blade, and the jiart behind the 
hinge is filed and straightened out so as to form the tang and a very efficient barb. 
This is a remarkable specimen of the adaptive geniuj of this people. In the shaping 
and filing of this scissors blade all of the characteristics aud marks of the barbed 
arrow with a stone head are preserved, except that the metal is substituted for the 
bone aud stone. 

Fig. 2. Shaft, of spruce wood, cylindrical. Shaftment, gradually flattened toward 
the nock. Feathers, two, extending off from the shaft, and seized with 
sinew-twisted thread. The nock is flattened; notch, parallel-sided. The 
barb, apiece of antler, sharpened at one end, inserted into the end of the 
shaft, and seized with fine sinew thread. The four barbs are on one side 
of the barb piece, and they project from the shaft, as iua feather, and this 
effect is emphasized by a little furrow just where the barbs proceed from 
the shaft. The point, a formidable blade of iron, with jagged barbs at 
the lower extremities, inserted into a "saw cut" on the end of the barb 
piece aud fastened with a copper rivet.

two parts. The shank is barbed on one side, inserted into the end of the 
shaft, and seized with twisted sinew. The head is sagittate; the tang 
inserted into a cut iu the end of the shank and seized with sinew. Total 
length of shaft, 29^ inches. ^

Fig. 6. Shaft of spruce. The head is of steel or iron. On each side of the head 
are six sharp barbs put in with a file, and a portion of the long tang pro- 
truding from the shaft is also serrated. The head is split, the tang 
driven in and held in place by a lashing of sinew twine. Feathers, two, 
seized at the end by narrow bands of sinew cord and standing ofl" from 
the shaft. This type of arrow is evidently the direct descendant of the 
aboriginal form, in which the head consists of a barbed piece and the 
blade. These murderous heads of iron exist in great variety over the 
Mackenzie region and have evidently been procured by the Eskimo from 
the Hudson Bay Company. A collection of them is a very interesting 
study in the variation of the arrowhead. Length of shaft, 2 feet; fore- 
shaft, 5 inches.

EXPLANATION OF PLATE LIX. 
The D1S6ECTJOX OK A Sea-Ottkk Arrow, Cook's Lnlkt. 

This is the most elaborate and iugenious arrow known, and alJ of its parts, in 
every specimen, are most delicately finished. Such a weapon may well have been 
used in hunting the most costly of fur-bearing animals — the otter. 

The shaft is of spruce, gently tapering toward the nock, which is large and bell 
shape. Into the end of this shaft is inserted a foreshaft of bone, and into the end 
of this fits the barb. Feathers, three, symmetrically trimmed and seized at both 
ends with delicately-twisted sinew thread. The barbed head is perforated, aud 
through these perforations is attached a braided line at least teu feet long. The 
other end of the line is attached to two points on the shaft by a martingale. When 
not in use, the line is coiled neatly 011 the shaft and the barb is put in place in the 
foreshaft. When the arrow is shot, the barb enters the flesh of the otter, the loose 
fastening is undone, the line unrolled, the foreshaft drops into the arrow; the shaft 
acts as a drag and the feathers as a buoy to aid the hunter in tracing the animal. 
See fig. 4., PI. Lii. 
Fig. 1. Arrow with line unrolled showing relation of parts. 

Fig. 2. Theshaftment. Attention isdrawn to the delicate seizing with sinew thread, 
the natty trimming of the feather, the most efficient nock. 

Fig. 3. The lines and knots. Notice is given of the elegance of the braid, the 
efficient manner of " doing up" the line, the peculiar knot for the mar- 
tingale. 

Fig. 4. The arrow ready to be shot. 

This form of arrow with its southern type of sinew-backed bow is found also on 

the Keniles, where these were taken by Alents, carried over by the Russians to hunt 

sea otter.

Fig. 1. Made of iiine wood; the shaft, head, and jjoint cut out of one piece. 
Feathers, three, 4|- inches long, laid on flat in the following manner : The 
three feathers were first attached to the butt of the arrow Ity a coiled 
Avrapping of sinew, their other extremities pointed backward; then they 
were doubled backward and the ends seized Avith sinew. This makes 
a very secure fastening for the feather. The coiled wrapping is continued 
over the nock and fastened off in the notch. Nock, flat; notch, U-shaped. 
The head, bulbous. The point is cut out of this by whittling away the 
wood so as to leave a long projection like a nail or spike. Total length, 
31| inches.

a common cut nail, driven into the end of the shaft and seized with sinew. 
At the inner part of this seizing a piece of nail is lashed on crosswise so 
as to prevent the arrow going more than two inches into the body of the 
tlie game. Total length of shaft, 25 inches.

Fig. 3. The sii.^ft, of osier. There is no feather. The nock is tightly seized with 
sinew cord; notch, U-shaped. The peculiarity of this arrow is that the 
point, of iron or bone, is lashed to the beveled end of the shaft and the 
tang is projected backwards into a long barb. This arrow is used in 
shooting prairie dogs. It is said that the Navahoe uses now a little bit 
of mirror with which to throw the sunlight into the eyes of the prairie 
dog until he can get near enough to drive one of these arrows into his 
body. Upon the least alarm or injury the creatures dive into their holes 
and this arrow enables the hunter, if he strikes one of them, to retrieve 
his game. The action of this arrow is very similar to that of the vermin 
hook used by the Ute Indians, and also to those of the northwest coast. 
Total length of shaft, 33 inches (32^ inches). 

Cat. No. 126740, TJ. S. N. M. JS'avalioe Indiana. Collected by Thomas Keam.

with twisted sinew thread. One feather is in the middle of one of the 
flat sides ; the other two feathers are at the round corners of the other 
side. The flat nock flares a little upward, and the notch is angular. 
This IS a bident or double-pointed arrow, having two barbs of bone 
inserted into the end of the shaft, so as to give them a sjiread of three - 
fourths of an inch at their points, one of Avhich is a little longer than the 
other. They are held to the shaft by a wrapping of sinew cord. The 
barbs face inward. Total length of shaft, 26 inches.

the same cord attaching them to the tip of the shaft and holding them in 
place. Length of shaft, 35 inches.

portion of this weapon deserves especial study. A little band of ivory, 
fitted over the shaft, lA inches from the upper end. Precisely similar 
bands are frequently labeled ornaments. Into the extremity of the shaft 
is inserted a delicate point of walrus ivory, triangular in cross section. 
Two of the edges are finely barbed. Three larger barbs, also triangular in 
section, have their lower ends driven into the shaft under the ivory baud, 
and the edges lie along in grooves extending to the end of the shaft. The 
barbs of these three points are on the inside. Just at the end of the shaft 
each of these outer barbs is perforated, and smew thread attaches them 
together and also to the central barb, and is also wrapped around the 
bases of these barbs just above the ivory band. Length of outer barbs, 6

Fig. 1. Bow. made of yew. This is a bow with a single curve on the back, double 
curve on the inside, broad and flat. Constricted at the grip and narrow- 
ing toward the nocks. Along the inside is a little furrow. The grip is 
ornamented with a tuft of long hair seized in place by a band of birch 
bark. This bow is exactly of the form of the sinew-lined bows farther 
south and inland. Perhaps the cold and dampness of the coast regions 
are unfavorable, affecting the glue. The bowstring is a single ribbon of 
sinew twist. Length, 3 feet 10 inches.

EXPLANATION OF PLATE LXV. 

Sixew-Backed Bows of Eskimo. 

Fig. 1. Compound bow, made of reindeer antler and backed witb sinew. The spec- 
imen is from Cumberland Gulf, the farthest point east at which sinew- 
backed bows have been found. This is an interesting specimen also because 
it exhibits the method of makina: the compound bow after the advent of 
the whalers. The grip piece is spliced and riveted to the limbs. In the 
old regime these three pieces were fastened together by lashings of sinew 
cord or braid, very strongly at the points where the upper and lower seizing 
occur in this bow. Two views given. Murdoch says of this type: "The 
main part of the reenforcement or backing consists of a continuous piece 
of stout twine made of sinew, generally a 3-strand braid, but sometimes a 
twisted cord, and often very long (sometimes 40 or 50 yards in length). 
One end of this is spliced or knitted into an ej^e, which is slipped round 
one 'nock' of the bow, usually the upper one. The stiands then pass up 
and down the back and round the nooks. A comparatively short bow, 
having along its back some dozen or twenty such plain strands, and tiuished 
oft' by knotting the end about the ' handle,' appears to have been the origi- 
nal pattern. The bow from Cumberland Gulf (fig. 1) is such a one, in 
which the strands have been given two or three turns of twine from the 
middle. They are kept from untwisting by a 'stop' round the handle, 
which passes between and around the strands." 
Cat. No. 34053, TJ. S. N. M. Collected by L. Kunilieii. 

Fig. 2. Southern type of sinew-backed bows of Murdoch. The essential features of 
these southern bows are — 
First. The substitution of a columnar for a breaking strain upon the wood secured 
by winding a great many yards of sinew twine or braid backward and forward 
along the back of the bow, from nock to nock. 

Second. The addition of strands in the cable inserted by means of half-hitches at 
various points, laid on as shown in the following jilate. 

Third. Holding the strands together in a cable by a coiled twine running froiu end 
to end.

Sinkw-Backki) Kows ok Esicyvio. 

Pj-atk i.xvu represeuts four examples of sinew-backed bows of Murdoch's southern 
types. The following characteristics are to be noted: First, in all of them 
the backing extends from nock to nock with here and there extra strands let 
into the cable by means of any number of half hitches passing around the 
bow and into the cable. These have the additional value of keeping the 
wood from cr.acking. In the third example in the plate is exhibited the 
characteristics of the bent or Tatar pattern. The bow has really three 
curves, the great one in the middle and two shorter ones near the end. 
The bends where the small curves meet the larger one are strengthened 
with bridgesof wood and seizing of sinew. In three specimens on the page 
the cable or backing Las been twisted by means of an ivory lever described 
in the text and held thus by a seizing which is rove through one-half of 
the strands holding the whole in place. The twisting of the sinew serves 
to tighten the bow. In figures 4, 5, 7 the bow is shown with a device 
for keeping the cable from untwisting. In all examples except figure 6 
one-half of the bow is shown.

Plate showing Murdoch's Arctic type of bow. The noteworthy features are — 
First. These bows are much shorter than those of southern type and are said l>y 
Murdoch to be of very graceful shape. In some examples the ends are bound up as 
in some of the southern bows and the b;ick reenforced with a sliort rounded splint of 
wood or antler in the bend. 

Second. The backing of these bows is always '' of a very comjilicated and perfect 
jsattern, usually very thoroughly inoorjiorated with the bow by means of hitches and 
a very complete seizing of many turns running nearly the whole length of the bow 
and serving to equalize the distribution of the strain and thus prevent cracking." 

Third. Another notable feature is in some examples the division of the backing into 
two cables in which the twist runs in opposite directions so that when the two cables 
are sewed together neither one can untwist. The examples shown in the plate are 
numbered as follows:

EXPLANATION OF PLATE LXXI. 
Sinkw-Backki> Bows of Eskimo. 

The first two figures upuu this plate, Ifiaud 17, illustrate a bow in which the south- 
ern type of wood has adniiuistered upon it the hacking of the Arctic type. The 
method of adniiuistering the short strands by means of half hitches to prevent the 
splitting of the wood is exhibited in the second <lrawing, figure 17. 

The last two figures upon this plate l)eloug to what Murdoch calls the Western 
type. Perhajjs it might be called the Chukchi type. The nu)st noticeable feature 
is that the hacking does not pass around the nocks at the ends of the bow, but the 
whole cable is held upon the back by means of a series of half hitches. The wood 
of the bow is either straight or of Tatar shape. 

These examples are Cat. Nos. 8822, from Yukon Delta, figures 16 and 17, collected

The priucipal figure upon this plate shows the administration of the braided line 
just at the point wheie tlie third cable coming from the nock crosses the bend in the 
bow. It is at this point that the greatest strain occurs and there is more pressing 
need for additional protection. Of this bow Murdoch says that '' it approaches very 
close to the Arctic type, but shows traces of the Western model in having the ends 
of the long strands stretched across the bend and one single short strand returning 
to the tip from beyond the bend, while a fourth is precisely of the Arctic tyjie, with 
a very large number of strands." The ivory levers shown upon the plate have been 
described, and are used in Cat. Nos. 2506 and 89466, U. S. N. M.

Thi8 i»late ishows the inaiiiier in which the ivory levers are used in winding up the 
double cable on the back of an Eskimo bow. It will be seen that each lever has a 
hook at each end, but on alternate sides. The end of each lever is thrust through 
the middle of a loose cable, hook side downward. It is then revolved through half 
a circle, as far as it will go, then pushed its entire length, which brings the hook 
at the other end in place for another half turn, and so on. A rawhide string is passed 
through both cables, wrapped about the grip and made fast. This prevents the 
cables from unwinding while the bow is in use.

ORIENTAL SCHOLARSHIP DURING THE PRESENT CEN- 
TURY.* 



By Prof. Frederick Max Muller. 



- - - When we wish to express sometliing removed from us as far as 
it can be, we use the expression "So far as the East is from tlie West." 
Is ow what we who are assembled, here are aiming at, what may be called 
our real raison d'etre^ is to bring- the East, which seems so far from us, 
so distant from us, nay, often so strange and iiidifl'erentto many of us, 
as near as possible — near to our thoughts, near to our hearts. It seems 
strange indeed that there should ever have been a frontier line to sep- 
erate the East from the West, nor is it easy to see at what time that line 
was first drawn, or whether there were any physical conditions which 
necessitated such a line of demarcation. The sun moves in unbroken 
continuity from East to West, there is no break in his triumphant prog- 
ress. Why should there ever have been a break in the triumphant 
progress of the human race from East to West, and how could that break 
have been brought about? It is quite true that as long as we know 
anything that deserves tlie name of history, that break exists. The 
Mediterranean with the Black Sea, the Caspian with the Ural Moun- 
tains may be looked upon as the physical boundary that separates the 
East from the Wesc. The whole history of the West seems so strongly 
determined by the Mediterranean, that Ewald was inclined to include 
all Aryan nations under the name of Mediterranean. But the Mediter- 
ranean ought to have formed not only the barrier, but likewise the 
connecting-link between Asia and Europe. Without that high-road 
leading to all the emporia of the world, without the pure and refresh- 
ing breezes, without the inlinite laughter of the Mediterranean, there 
would never have been an Athens, a Eome; there would never have 
been that spirited and never-resting Europe, so different from the solid 
and slowly -changing Asiatic continent. Northern Africa, however, 
Egypt, Palestine, Pheuicia, and Arabia, though in close proximity to 
the Mediterranean, belong in their history to the East, quite as much as

Babylon, Assyria, Media, Persia, and India. Even Asia Minor formed 
only a temporary bridge between East and West, which was drawn up 
again when it had served its purpose. We ourselves have grown up so 
entirely in the atmosphere of Greek thought that we hardly feel sur- 
prised when we see nations such as the Pheniciaus and Persians, looked 
upon by the Greeks as strangers and barbarians, though in ancient times 
the former were far more advanced in civilization than the Greeks, and 
though the latter spoke a language closely allied to the language of 
Homer, and possessed a religion far more x^ire and elevated than that 
of the Homeric Greeks, The Eomans were the heirs of the Greeks, and 
the whole of Europe succeeded afterwards to the intellectual inherit- 
ance of Eome and Greece. Nor can we disguise the fact that we our- 
selves have inherited from them something of that feeling of strange- 
ness between the West and the East, between the white and the dark 
man, between the Aryan and the Semite, which ought never to have 
arisen, and which is a disgrace to everybody who harbors it. Xo one 
in these Darwinian days would ventnre to doubt the homogeneous- 
ness of the human species, the brotherhood of the whole human race; 
but there remains the fact that, as in ancient so in modern times, mem- 
bers of that one human species, brothers of that one human family, look 
upon each other, not as brothers, but as strangers, if not as enemies, 
divided not only by language and religion, but also by what people call 
blood, whatever they may mean by that term. 

I wish to point out that it constitutes one of tlie greatest achievements 
of Oriental scholarship to have proved by irrefragable evidence that 
the complete break between East and West did not exist from the begin- 
ning; that in prehistoric times language formed really a bond of union 
between the ancestors of many of the Eastern and Western nations, 
while more recent discoveries have proved that in liistoric times also, 
language, which seemed to separate the great nations of antiquity, 
never separated the most important among them so conipletely as to 
make all intellectual commerce and exchange between them impossible. 
These two discoveries seem to me to form the highest glory of Oriental 
scholarship during the present century. - - - 

I begin with the prehistoric world which has actually been brought 
to light for the first time by Oriental scholarship. 

1 confess I do not like the expression lyrchhtonc. It is a vague term, 
and almost withdraws itself from definition. If real history begins only 
with the events of which we possess contemporaneous witnesses, then, 
no doubt, the whole period of which we are now speaking, and many 
later periods also would have to be called prehistoric. But if history 
means, as it did originally, research and knowledge of real events based 
on such research, then the events of which we are going to speak are 
as real and as tridy historical as the battle of Waterloo. It is often 
su]>posed that students of Oriental languages and of the Science of Lan- 
guage deal with words only. We have learned by this tinie that there 



ORIENTAL SCHOLARSHIP DURING THE PRESENT CENTURY. 683 

is iio such thing as "words only," that every new word represented 
really a most niomentous event m the development of our race. What 
people call ''mere words" are in truth the monuments of the fiercest 
intellectual battles, triumphal arches of the grandest victories won by 
the intellect of man. Wlien man had formed names for body and soul, 
for father and mother, and not till then did the first act of human his- 
tory begin. Not till there were names for right and wrong, for God 
and man, could there be anything worthy of the name of human society. 
Every new word was a discovery, and these early discoveries, if but 
properly understood, are more important to us than the greatest con- 
quests of the kings of Egypt and Babylon. 

Not one of our greatest explorers has unearthed with his spade or 
pick-axe more splendid i^alaces and temples, whether in Egypt or in 
Babylon, than the etymologist. Every word is the palace of a human 
thought; and in scientific etymology we possess the charm with which 
to call these ancient thoughts back to life. It is the study of words, 
it is the Science of Language, that has withdrawn the curtain which 
formerly concealed these ancient times and their intellectual struggles 
fioiu the sight of historians. Even now, when scholars speak of lan- 
guages, and families of languages, they often forget that languages 
mean speakers of languages, and families of speech presuppose real 
families, or classes, or powerful confederacies, which have struggled 
for their existence and held their ground against all enemies. Lan- 
guages, as we read in the book of Daniel, are the same as nations that 
dwell on all the earth. If, therefore, Greeks and Eomans, Celts, Ger- 
mans, Slavs, Persians, and Indians, speaking different languages, and 
each forming a separate nationality, constitute, as long as we know 
them, a real historical fact, there is another fact equally real and his- 
torical, though we may refer it to a prehistoric period, namely, that 
there was a time when the ancestors of all these nations and languages 
formed one compact body, speaking one and the same language, a lan- 
guage so real, so truly historical, that without it there.would never have 
been a real Greek, a real Latin language; never a Greek republic, 
never a Boman empire; there would have been no Sanskrit, no Yedas, 
no Avesta, no Plato, no Greek New Testament. We know with the 
same certainty that other nations and languages, also, which in histor- 
ical times stand before us so isolated as Phenician, Hebrew, Babylon 
ian, and Arabic, pre-suppose a prehistoric, that is, an antecedent 
powerful Semitic confederacy, held together by the bonds of a common 
language, possibly by the same laws, and by a belief in the same gods. 
Unless the ancestors of these nations and languages had once lived 
and worked together there would have been no common arsenal from 
which the leading nations of Semitic history could have taken their 
armor and their swords, the armor and swords which they wielded in 
their intellectual struggles, and many of which we are still wielding 
ourselves in our wars of liberation from error and in our conquests of

trutli. These are stern, iinniovable facts, just as Mont Blanc is a 
stern, irremovable fact, tliougli from a distance we must often be satis- 
fied with seeing its gigantic outline only, not all its glaciers and all its 
crevasses. What I mean is tliat we must not attempt to discover too 
much of what hapi)ened thousands of years ago, or strain our sight to 
see what, from this distance in time, we can not see. - - - 

Nothing has shaken the belief, for I do not call it more, that the old- 
est home of the Aryas was in the East. All theories in favor of other 
localities, of wliich we have heard so )nuch of late, whether in favor of 
Scandinavia, Eussia, or Germany, rest on evidence far more i)recarious 
than that which was collected by the founders of Comparative Philology. 
Only we must remember, what is so often forgotten, that when we say 
Aryas we predicate nothing — we can predicate nothing — but language. 
We know, of course, that languages presuppose speakers, but when we 
say Aryas we say nothing about skulls, or hair, or eyes, or skin, as little 
as when we say Christians or Mohammedans, English or Americans. 
All that has been said and written about the golden hair, the blue eyes, 
and the noble profile of the Aryas, is pure invention, unless we are pre- 
pared to say that Socrates, the wisest of the Greeks, was not an Arya, 
but a Mongolian. We ought, in fact, when we speak of Aryas, to shut 
our eyes most carefully against skulls, whether dolichocei)halie, or 
brachycephalic, or mesocephalic, whether orthognathic, prognathic, or 
mesognathic. We are completely agnostic as to all that, and we gladly 
leave it to others to discover, if they can, whether the ancestors of the 
Aryan speakers rejoiced in a jSTeanderthal or any other kind of skull 
that has been discovered in Europe or Asia. Till people will learn this 
simple lesson, which has been inculcated for years by such high authori- 
ties as Horatio Hale, Powell, and Brinton, all discussions on tlie original 
home of the Aryas are so much waste of time and temper. 

There is the same difference of opinion as to the original home of the 
Semites, but all Semitic scholars agree that it was " somewherein Asia." 
The idea that the Semites proceeded from Armenia has, hardly any 
defenders left, though it is founded on an ancient tradition preserved 
in Genesis. An eminent scholar, who at the last moment was [)revented 
by domestic afHiction from attending our Congress, Prof. Guidi,* holds 
that the- Semites came probably from the Lower Euphrates. Other 
scholars, particularly Dr. Sprenger, placed the Semitic cradle in Arabia. 
Prof. IS'oldeke takes much the same view with regard to the home of 
the Semites, which 1 take with regard to the home of the Aryas. We 
can not with certainty fix on any particular spot, but tliat it was " some- 
where in Asia'' no scholar would ever doubt. 

It is well known also that some high authorities. Dr. Hommel, for 
instance, and Prof. Schmidt, hold that the ancestors of the Semites and 
Aryas must for a time have lived in close i)roximity, which would be a 



* Delia sede primilira dei Popoli, Se»iitici. "Proceedings of the Aocademia dei liucei," 
1878-79. 



ORIENTAL SCHOLARSHIP DURING THE PRESENT CENTURY. 685 

new coimrmatioii of the Asiatic origin of the Aryas. But we hardly 
want that axhlitional .support. Benfey's arguments in favor of a Euro- 
pean origin of the Aryas were, no doubt, very ingenious. But, as his 
objections have now been answered by one,* the ohl arguments for an 
Asiatic home seem to me to have considerably gained in strength. I, 
at all events, can no longer join in the jubilant chorus that, like all 
good tilings, our noble ancestors, the Aryas, came from Germany. Dr. 
Schrader, who is often quoted as a decided supporter of a European 
origin of the Aryas, is far too conscientious a scholar to say more tlian 
that all he has written on the subject should be considered " as purely 
tentative." (Preface, p. vi.) 

With regard to time, our difticulties are greater still, and to attempt 
to solve difticulties which can not be solved, seems to me no better than 
the old attempt to square the circle. If people are satisfied with 
approximate estimates, such as we are accustomed to iu geology, tliey 
may say that some of the Aryan languages, such as Sanskrit in India, 
Zend in Media, must have been finished and used metrical form about 
2000 B. C. Greek followed soon after. And when it is said that these 
languages were finished 2000 b. c, that means simply that they had 
become independent varieties of that typical Aryan language which 
had itself reached a highly finished state long before it was broken up 
into these dialects. This tyi)ical language has been called tlie Profo- 
Aryan language. We are often asked why it should be impossible to 
calculate how many centuries it must have taken before that Proto- 
Aryan language could have become so differentiated and so widely diver- 
gent as Sanskrit is from Greek, or Latin from Gothic. If argued 
geologically, we might say, no doubt, that it took a thousand years to 
produce so small a divergence as that between Italian and French, and 
that therefore many thousands of years would not suftice to account 
for such a divergence as that between Sanskrit and Greek. We might, 
therefore, boldly place the first divergence of the Aryan languages at 
5000 B. c, and refer the united Aryan period to the time before 5000 
B. G. That period again Avould recpiire many thousands of years, if we 
are to account for all that had already become dead and purely formal 
in the Proto- Aryan language before it began to break up into its six 
ethnic varieties, that is, into Celtic^ Teutonic^ Slavonic, Greek, Latin,

If then we must follow the example of geology and fix chronological 
limits for the growth of the Proto-Aryan language previous to the con- 
solidation of the six national langaages 10,000 b. c. would by no means 
be too distant as to the probable limit of what I should call our his- 
torical knowledge of the existence of Aryan speakers somewhere iu 
Asia. 

And what applies to those Aryan speakers applies with even greater 
force to the Semitic, because the earliest monuments of Semitic speech,

difiereiitiated as Babylonian, Pbenician, Hebrew, and Arabic, go back, 
as we are told, far. beyond tlie earliest documents of Sanskrit or Greek. 
Here also we must admit a long period previous to tlie formation of the 
great national languages, because thus only can the fact be accounted 
for that on many points, so modern a language as Arabic is more primi- 
tive thau Hebrew, while, in other grammatical formations Hebrew is more 
primitive than Arabic* 

Whether it is possible that these two linguistic consolidations, the 
Aryan and Semitic, came originally from a common source is a question 
which scholars do not like to ask, because they know that it does not 
admit of a scholar-like answer. ISTo scholar would deny the possibility 
of an original community between the two during their radical period, 
and i)revious to the development of any granmiatical forms. But the 
handling of this kind of linguistic protoplasm is not congenial to the 
student of language, and must be left to other hands. Still, such an 
attempt should not be discouraged altogether, and if they are carried out 
in the same spirit in which in the last number of the "-Journal of the Ger- 
man Oriental Society,'''' Prof. Erman has tried to prove a close relation- 
ship between Semitic and Bgyiitian, they deserve the highest credit. 
Another question also which carries us back still further into unknown 
anti(|uity — whether it is possible to account for the origin of languages, 
or rather of human speech in general — is one which scholars eschew, 
because it is one to be handled by philosophers rather than by students 
of language, I must confess, the deeper we delve, the farther the solu- 
tion of this problem seems to recede from our grasp; and we may here 
too learn the old lesson that our mind was not made to grasp begin- 
nings. We know the beginnings of nothing in this world, and the prob- 
lem of the origin of language, which is but another name for the origin 
of thought, evades our comprehension quite as much as the problem of 
the origin of our planet and of the life upon it, or the origin of space 
and time, whether without or within us. History can dig very deep, 
but, like the shafts of our mines, it is always arrested before it has 
reached the very lowest stratum. Students of language, and particu- 
larly students of Oriental languages, have solved the problem of the 
origin of species in language, and they had done so long before the days 
of Darwin ; but like Darwin, they have to acce])t certain original germs 
as given, and they do not venture to pierce into the deepest mysteries 
of actual creation or cosmic beginnings. 

And yet, though accepting this limitation of their labors as the com- 
mon fate of all human knowledge. Oriental scholars have not altogether 
labored in vain. No history of the world can in future be written 
without its introductory chapter on the great consolidations of the 
ancient Aryan and Semitic speakers. That chapter may be called 
prehistoric, but ihe facts with which it deals are thoroughly historical, 
and I say once moie, in the eyes of the student of language, they are 



§ee Priver, H^hr^vj T^mes, p, 132.

as real as the battle of Waterloo. They form the solid foundation of 
all later history. They determine the course of the principal nations 
of ancient history as the mountains determine the course of rivers. 
Try only to realize what is meant by the fact that there was a time and 
there was a place where the ancestors of the poets of the Veda and of 
the prophets of the Zend Avesta shook hands and conversed freely with 
the ancestors of Homer, nay, with our own linguistic ancestors, and 
you will see what a shiftiuii,' of scenery, what a real transformation 
scene Oriental students have produced on the historical stage of the 
world. They have brought together the most valuable and yet the 
least expensive museum of antiquities, namely, the words which date 
from the time of an undivided Aryan and an undivided Semitic broth- 
erhood ; relics older than all Babylonian tablets or Egyptian papyri ; 
relics of their common thoughts, their common religion, their common 
mythology, their common folk-lore, nay, as has lately beeji shown 
by Leist, Kohler, and others, relics of their common jurisprudence 
also. - - - 

At the present moment, when the whole world is preparing for the 
celebration of the discovery of America, or what is called the New 
World, let us not forget that the discoverers of that old, that prehis- 
toric world of which I have been speaking, deserve our gratitude as 
much as Columbus and his companions. The discrveries of Sir William 
Jones, Schlegel, Humboldt, and of my own masters and fellow-workers, 
Bopp, Pott, Burnouf, Benfey, Kuhn, and Curtius, will forever remain 
a landmark in the studies devoted to the history, that is, the knowl- 
edge of our race, and, in the end, the knowledge of ourselves. If 
others have followed in their footsteps and have proved that these 
bold discoverers have sometimes been on a wrong track let them have 
full credit for what they have added, for what they have corrected, and 
what they have rejected; but a ]Moses who tights his way through the 
wilderness, though he dies before he enters on the full possession of 
the promised land, is greater than all the Joshuas that cross the Jor- 
dan and divide the land. Many travellers now tind their way easily to 
Africa and back; but the first who toiled alone to discover the sources 
of the Nile, men such as Burton, Speke, and Liviugs.tone, required 
often greater faith and greater pluck than those who actually dis- 
covered them. As long as I live I shall protest against all attempts 
to belittle the true founders of the Science of Language. Their ^•ery 
mistakes often display more genius than the corrections of their 
Epigoni. 

It may be said that this great discovery of a whole act in the drama 
of the world, the very existence of which was unknown to our fore- 
fathers, was due to the study of the Science of Language rather than to 
Oriental scholarship. But where would the Science of Language have 
been without the students of Sanskrit and Zend, of Hebrew and Arabic? 
At a Congress of Ovientaljsts we have a right to claim what is due to

tliem, and 1 doubt whether anybody here present would deny that it is 
due in the first place to Oriental scholars, such as Sir W. Jones, (Jole- 
brooke, Schlegel, Bopp, Burnouf, Lassen, and Kuhn, if we now have a 
whole period added to the history of the world, if we now can prove 
that long- before we knew anything of Homeric Greece, of Vedic India, 
of Persia, Greece, Italy, and all the rest of Europe, there was a real 
historical community formed by the speakers of Aryan tongues, that 
they were closely held together by the bonds of a common speech and 
common thoughts. It is equally due to the industry and genius of 
Oriental scholars, such as De Sacy, Gesenius, Ewald, and my friend 
the late Prof. Wright, if it can no longer be doubted that the ancestors 
of the speakers of Babylonian and Assyrian, Syriac, Hebrew, Pheni- 
cian, and Arabic formed once one consolidated brotherhood of Semitic 
speech, and that however different they are when they appear for the 
tirst time in their national costumes on the stage of history they could 
once understand their common words and common thoughts like mem- 
bers of one and the same family. Surely this is an achievement on 
which Oriental scholarship has a rig^ht to take pride, when it is chal- 
lenged to produce its title to the gratitude of the world at large. 

If we now turn our attention to another field of Oriental scholarship 
which has been fruitful of results of the greatest importance to the 
student of hisrory, and to the world at large, we shall be able to show, 
not indeed that Oriental scholars have created a whole period of his- 
tory, as in the case of the Aryas and Semites, before their respective 
separation, but that they have inspired the oldest period in the history 
of the world with a new life and meaning-. Instead of learning by 
heart the unmeaning names of kings and the dates of their battles, 
whether in Egypt, or Babylon, in Syria and Palestine, we have been 
enabled, chiefly through the marvellous discoveries of Oriental scholars, 
to watch their most secret thoughts, to comprehend their motives, to 
listen to their prayers, to read even their jirivate and confidential 
letters. Think only what ancient Egypt was to us a hundred years 
ago! A Sphinx buried in a desert, with hardly any human features 
left. And now, not only do we read the hieroglyphic, the hieratic, and 
demotic inscriptions, not only do we know the right names of kings and 
queens 4000 or 5000 years B- c, but we know their gods, their worship; 
we know their laws and their poetry; we know their folk lore and even 
their novels. Their prayers are full of those touches which make the 
whole world feel akin. Here is the true Isis, here is Hunmn Nature, 
unveiled. The prayers of Babylon are more formal; still, how much 
more living is the picture they give us of the humanity of Babylon and 
Nineveh, than all the palaces, temples, and halls! And as to India, 
think what India was to the scholars of the last century! A name and 
not much more. And now! Not only have the ancient inhabitants 
ceased to be mere idolaters or niggers; they have been recognized as 
our brothers in language and thought,

The Veda has revealed to us the earliest phases in the history of 
natural leligioii, and has placed in our hands the only safe key to the 
secrets of Aryau mythology. jSTa^, I do not hesitate to say that there 
are rays of light in the Upauishads and in the ancient philosophy of 
the Vedanta which will throw new light, even to-day, on some of the 
problems nearest to our own hearts. And not only has each one of the 
ancient Oriental Kingdoms been reanimated and made to speak to us, 
like the gray, crumbling statue of Memnon, when touched by the rays 
of dawn, but we have also gained a new insight into the mutual rela- 
tions of the principal nations of anticiuity. Formerly, when we had to 
read the liistory of the world, every one of the great Kingdoms of the 
East seemed to stand by itself, isolated from all the rest, having its 
own past, unconnected with tlie past history of other countries. 

China, for instance, was a world by itself. It had always been inhab- 
ited by a peculiar people, different in thought, ni language, and in 
writing even from its nearest neighbors. 

Egypt, in the gray morning of antiquity, seemed to standalone, like 
a pyramid in a desert, self contained, proud, and without any interest 
in the outside world, entirely original m its language, its alphabet, its 
literature, its art, and its religion. 

India, again, has always been a world by itself, either entirely 
unknown to the Northern nations, or surrounded in their eyes by a 
golden mist of fable and injstery. 

Tiie same applies more or less to the great Mesopotamia!! Kingdoms, 
to Babylon and Nineveh. They, too, have their own language, their 
own alphabet, their own religion, their own art. They seem to owe 
nothing to anybody else. 

It is somewhat different with Media and Persia, but this is chietly 
due to our knowing hardly anything of these countries before they 
appear in contiict Avith their neighbors, either as conquerois or as con- 
quered, on the ancient battle-fields of history. 

In facr, if we look at the old maps of the ancient world, we see them 
colored with different and strongly contrasting colors, which admit of 
no shading, of no transition from one to the other. P^very country 
seemed a world by itself, and, so far as we can Judge from the earliest 
traditions which have reached us, each nation claimed even its own 
independent creation, whether from their own gods, or from their own 
native soil. China knows nothing of what is going on in Babylon and 
Egypt; Egypt hardly knows the name of India; India looks upon all 
that is beyond the Himalayan snows as fabulous, while the Jews, more 
than all the rest, felt themselves a peculiar people, the chosen peojile 
of God. 

Until lately, if it was asked whether there was any communication 

at all between the leading historical nations of the East, the answer 

was that no communication, no interchange of thought, no mutual 

influei!(;e was possible, because language placed a barrier between 

SM 93 44 



690 ORIENTAL SCHOLARSHIP DURING THE PRESENT CENTURY. 

tliein whicli made couimuuicatioii, and more particularly iree intellec- 
tual iutercourse, entirely impossible. 

If therefore it seemed that some of these ancient nations shared 
certain ideas, beliefs, or customs in common, the answer always was 
that they could not have borrowed one from the other, because there 
was really no channel through which they could have connuunicated, or 
borrowed from each other by means of a ratioiial and continuous con- 
verse. Thanks to the more recent researches of Oriental scholars, this 
is no longer so. One of the tirst and one of tlie strongest proofs that 
there was, in very ancient times, a very active intellectual intercourse 
between Aryan and Semitic nations, is the Greek Alphabet. The Greeks 
never made any secret of their having borrowed their letters from 
Phenician sclujol masters. They called their letters Phenician, as we 
call our numerical figures Arabic, whde the Aral^s called them Indian. 
The very name of Alphabet in Greek is the best proof that at the time 
when the Greeks were the pupils of Phenician writing-masters, the 
secondary names of the Semitic letters, Aleph, Beth, Gimel, Daleth, had 
already been accei)ted. Originally the Aleph was the picture not of a 
bull, but of an eagle; Beth not of a house, but of another bird; Gimel 
not of a camel, but of a vessel with a handle; Daleth of a stretched 
out hand. This iutercourse between Phenicians and Greeks must have 
taken place previous to the beginning of any written literature in 
Greece, previous therefore to the seventh century at least. When avb 
speak of Greeks and Phenicians in general, we must guard against 
thinking of w hole nations, or of large numbers. The work of humanity 
in the past, more e\'en than in the j)resent, was carried on by the few, 
not by the many, by what Disraeli called "' the men of light and lead- 
ing," the so-called Path-makers ot the ancient world. They represent 
unknown millions, standing behind them, as a Commander-in-chief rep- 
resents a whole army that follows him. The important point is that in 
the alphabet we have before us a tangible document, attesting a real 
communication between these leaders of progress and civilization in 
the East and in the West, a bridge between Phenicia and Greece, 
between Semitic and Aryan people. The name of the letter Alpha in 
the Greek alphabet is a more irresistible i)roof of Phenician influence 
than all the legends about Kadmos and Thebes, about a Phenician 
Herakles or a Phenician Aphrodite. It is strange that not one of the 
classical scholars who have written on the traces of Phenician influence 
in the religion and mythology of Greece should have availed himself 
of the Greek alphabet as the most palpable proof of a real and most 
intimate intercourse between the Phenicians and the early inhabitants 
of Greece. 

But their discoveries have oi>ened even wider vistas. It was one of 
the most brilliant achievements, due to the genius of the Vicomte de 
Rouge to have shown that, though they discovered many things, the 
Phenicians did not discover the letters of the alphabet. Broken arches

of tlie same bridge that led from Plieuicia to Greece have been hiid 
bare, and they lead clearly from Plienicia back to Egypt. It is well 
known that even the ancients hardly ever doubted that the alphabet 
was originally discovered in Egypt and carried from thence by the 
Phenicians to Greece and Italy. Plato, Diodorus Siculus, Plutarch, 
and Gellius, all speak of Egypt as the cradle of the alplmbet, and Taci- 
tus [A nnals, xi. 14), who seems to have taken a special interest in this sub- 
ject, is most explicit on that point. It was supposed for a time that the 
Egyptians simply took certain hieroglyphic signs, and made them stand 
for their initial letters. This AVas called the akrological theoi^y, but it 
is no longer tenable. The alphabet was never a discovery, in the usual 
sense of the word; it was like all the greatest discoveries, a natural 
growth. It arose, without any intentional effort, ft'om the employment 
of what are called complimentary hieroglyphics.* - - - 

What the Vicomte de Rouge did, was to select the most ancient 
forms of the Phenician alphabet, as they are found on the sarcophagus 
of Eshmunezar (or better still, on the Stone of Mesha, wiiich was not 
known in his time), and to show how near they came, not indeed to the 
most ancient hieroglyphics, but to certain hieratic cursive signs which 
have the same phonetic values as their corresponding Phenician letters. 
This was a most brilliant discovery, and I still possess a very scarce 
paper which he sent me in 1859. He never published a full account of 
his discovery himself, but after his death his notes were published by 
his son in 1874. 

I know" quite well that some scholars have remained skeptical as to 
the Egyptian origin of the Phenician letters. My friend Lepsius Avas 
never quite convinced. Attempts have been made to derive the Pheiii 
cian letters from a cuneiform source or from the Cypriote letters, but 
the result has hitherto been far from satisfactory. The Phenician let- 
ters must have had ideographic antecedents. Where are we to look 
for them, if not in Egypt? What has always made me feel convinced 
that Kouge was right is the fact that we have to deal with a series, 
and that 15 out of the 23 letters of this series are almost identical 
in Phenician and in Egyptian. We are perfectly justified, there- 
fore, in making a certain allowance for some modifications in the 
rest. These modifications are certainly not greater than the modifica- 
tions which the Phenician letters underwent later in their travels over 
the whole civilized world. But there is another argument in Rouge's 
fa vol- which has often been ignored, namely, the fact that the Egyptians, 
whenever they liad to transcribe foreign words, have fixed in many cases 
on tbe identical letters which served as the prototypes of the Phenician 
alphabet. This fact, first pointed out by Dr. Hincks, is one of the many 
valuable services which that ingenious scholar has rendered to hiero- 
glyphic studies; and the Yicomte de Rouge has been the first to 
acknowledge how much his own discovery owes to the labors of Dr.

Hiucks, x)ai"ticiilarly to his paper on the P^gyptiau alphabet published in 
" The Transactions of the Irish Academy in 1847." All the facts coucerii- 
iiig" the history of the alphabet have been carefully put together in 
Lenormant's great work, ^^JEssai snr la Propagation de V Alphabet Phent- 
C'?e»." Here, then, we have a clear line of communication between 
Egypt, Phenicia, and Greece, which Oriental scholarship has laid bare 
before our eyes. To judge from the character of the hieratic letters as 
copied by the Phenicians, the copying must have taken place about the 
nineteenth century b. c.*; accordiug to others, even at an earlier date. 
It is well known that hieroglyphic writing for monumental purposes 
goes back in Egypt to the Fourth, or even the Second Dyuastyt, and on 
these earliest inscriptions we not oidy tind the hieroglyphic system of 
writing fully develoi>ed, but we actually see hieroglyphic i)ictures of 
paper| and books, of inkstands and pens. But here again the beginnings 
escape us, and the origin of writing, though we know the conditions under 
which it took place withdraws itself from our sight almost as nnich as 
the origin of language itself. The question has been asked whether, as 
the oldest cuneiform writing clearly betrays an ideographic origin, its 
first germs could be traced back to the ideographic alphabet of Egypt. 
This would make Egypt the schoolmaster, or at least the older school- 
fellow of the Mesopotamian Kingdoms. But, whatever the future may 
disclose, at present Oriental scholarship has no evidence with which to 
confirm such a hypothesis. 

The same applies to another hypothesis which has been advocated 
with great ingenuity by one of the members of our Congress, M. Terrien 
de Lacouperie. He thiidcs it possil)le to show that the oldest Chinese 
letters, which, as is generally admitted, had an ideogi'ai)hic beginning 
like that of the Egyptian hieroglyphics, owed their first origin to 
Babylon. It is generally supposed that the cuneiform alphabet used 
by the Semitic inhabitants of Babylonia and Assyria was invented by 
a non-Semitic race called Sumerians and Accadians. AVhether the 
Chinese borrowed from these races or from the Babylonians is difficult 
to decide. It nuist likewise remain for the present an open <piestion 
whether these Sumerians and Accadians can be identified with a race 
dwelling originally in the North and East of Asia. There are scholars 
who place the original home of the Accadians on the Persian Gulf, 
though the evidence for this view also is very weak. We nnist not 
forget that ideographs, such as i)ictures of the sun and moon or of the 
superincumbent skj', of mountains and plants, of the mouth and nose, 
of eyes and ears, must of necessity share certain features in common 
in whatever country they are used for hieroglyphic purposes. The 
scholar has the same feeling with regard to these very general ideo- 
graphic pictures which he has with regard to the very indefinite roots of

language wliicb are su])posed to be shared in comnion by the Semitic 
and Aryan families of speech. Both are too protoplastic, too jelly- 
like, too indefinite for scientific handling.* 

Still no researches, if only carried on methodically, should be dis- 
couraged a jM'iori, and we must always be willing to learn new lessons 
however much they may shock our inherited opinions. 

It is not so very long ago that the best Semitic schohirs stood aghast 
at the idea that the cuneiform letters were borrowed from a non-Semitic 
race, and that some of the cuneiforiii inscriptions should contain speci- 
mens of a non-Semitic (n^ Accadian language. We have got over this 
surprise, and though there are still some formidable skeptics, the fact 
seems now generally recognized that there was in very ancient times 
an intercourse betAveen the Semitic and non-Senntic races of Asia as 
there was between the Egyptians and the Phenicians, and between the 
Phenicians and Greeks, that is, between the greatest people of antiq- 
uity, and that these non-Semitic people or Accadians were really the 
schoolmasters of the founders of the great Mesopotamian kingdoms. 
But though we must for the present consider any connection between 
Chinese and Babylonian writing as extremely doubtful, there can be no 
doubt as to the rapid advance of the cuneiform system of writing itself 
from East to West. This wonderful invention, more mysterious even 
than the hieroglyphic alphabet, soon overflowed the frontiers of the 
Mesopotamian kingdoms, and found its way into Persia and Armenia, 
where it was used, though for the purpose of inscriptions only, by 
people speaking both Aryan and non-Aryan languages. Here, then, 
we see an ancient intercourse between people who were formerly con- 
sidered by all historians as entirely separate, and we are chiefly 
indebted to English scholars, such as Rawlinson, Norris, Sayce, Pinches, 
and others, for having brought to light some of the ruins of that long 
buried bridge on which the thoughts of the distant East may have 
wandered toward the West. 

Few generations have witnessed so many discoveries in Oriental 
scholarship, and have lived through so many surprises, as our own. If 
any two countries seemed to have been totally separated in ancient 
times by tlie barriers both of language and writing they were Egypt 
with its hieroglyphic and Babylon with its arrow-headed literature. 
We only knew of one communication between Egypt and its powerful 
neighbors and enemies, carried on through the inarticulate and mur- 
derous language of war, of spears and arrows, but not of arrow-headed 
writings. Who could have supposed that the rows of wedges covering 
the cylinders of Babylonian libraries, which have taxed the ingenuity 
of our cleverest decipherers, were read without any apparent difficulty 
by scribes and scholars in Egypt about 1500 b. c? Yet we possess

now in the tablets found at Tel-el-Amarna, in Egypt, a kind of diplo- 
matic correspondence, carried on at that early time, more tlian a thou- 
sand years before the invasion of Greece by Persia, between the kings 
of Egypt and their friends and vassals in Babylon. Syria, and Palestine- 
These letters were docketed in Egypt in hieratic writing, like the dis- 
patches in our Foreign Office. They throw much light on the political 
relations then existing between the Kings of Egypt and the Kings of 
western Asia, their political and matrimonial alliances, and likewise 
on the trade carried on between different countries. They confirm 
statements known to ns from hieroglyphic inscriptions in Egyi>t, more 
particularly those in the temple of Karnak. The spelling is chiefly 
syllabic, the language an Assyrian dialect. Doubtful Accadian words 
are often followed and explained by glosses in what may be called a 
Cauaanite dialect, which comes very near to Hebrew. But how did 
the kings of Egypt understand these cuneiform dispatches'? It is true 
we meet sometimes with the express statement that those to whom 
these missives were addressed had understood them,* as if this could 
not always be taken for granted. It is true also that these letters were 
mostly brought by messengers who might have helped in inter])reting 
them, provided they had learned to si)eak and read Egyptian. But 
what is more extraordinary still, the King of Egypt himself, Amenophis 
ITT, when writing to a king whose daughter he wishes to marry, writes 
a dispatch in cuneiform letters, and in a language not his own, unless 
we suppose that the tablet which we possess was simply a translation 
sent to the King Kallimma Sin, and as such kept in the archives of the 
Egyptian Foreign Office. 

It is curious to observe that the King of Egypt, though quite willing to 
marry the daughters of smaller potentates, is not at all disposed to send 
P^gyptian princesses to them. For he writes in his own letters (p. 20) 
"A daughter of the King of the land of Egypt has never been given to 
a 'Nobody.'" Whatever else we may learn from these letters, they are 
not patterns of diplomatic language, if indeed the translation is in this 
case quite faithful.! In these dispatches, dating from 1400 b. c, a num- 
ber of towns are mentioned, many of which have the same names as 
those known to us from hieroglyphic inscriptions. Some of these names 
have even survived to our own time, such as Misirim for Egypt, Damas- 
cus, Megiddo, Tyre (Surrii), Sidon (Siduna), Byblos (Guble), Beyrut 
(Biruta), Joppa (Yapu), and others. Even the name of Jerusalem has 
been discovered by Sayce in these tablets, as UrulsaI'm, meaning in 
Assyrian the town of jieace, a name which nnist have existed l)efore 
the Jews took possession of Canaan. Some of these tablets (eighty- 
two) may be seen at the British Museum, others (100) at Berlin, most 
of the rest are in the nuiseum at Gizeh. We are indebted to Mr. Budge

for having- secured these treasures for the British Museum, and to 
Dr. Bezold and .Afr. Budge for having translated and published them. 

To us this correspondence is of the greatest importance, as showing 
once more the existence of a literary and intellectual intercourse between 
western Asia and Egypt, of which historians had formerly no suspi- 
cion. If we can once point to such an open channel as that through 
which cuneiform tablets travelled from Babylonia and Syria to P]gpyt, 
we shall be better prepared to understand the presence in Egypt of 
products of artistic workmanship also from western Asia, nay, from 
Cyprus, and even from Mycente. I possessed potsherds sent to me by 
Schliemann from Mycen;ie, which might have been broken oft' from the 
same vessels of which fragments have been found at lalysos, and lately 
in Egypt by Mr. Flinders Petrie. I have sent these potsherds to the 
British ]\ruseum to be placed by the side of the pottery from lalysos, 
and to our TTniversity Museum at Oxford. Mr. Flinders Petrie in the 
Am/7^>»^, June 25, 1892, writes: ''Mykenrean vase-types are found in 
Egypt with scarabs, etc., of the Eighteenth Dynasty, and conversely 
objects of the Eighteenth Dynasty, including a royal scarab, are found 
at Mykeine. And again, hundreds ot pieces of pottery, purely Myke- 
na^n in style, have been found in various dateable discoveries in Egypt, 
and without excej^tion every datum for such, lies between laOO and 1100 
B. c. and earlier rather than later in that range.'' I do not mean to say 
that this tixes the date of the Myken;ean pottery, nor do I wish to rely 
on evidence Avhich is contested by some of the best Egy])tian scholars; 
otherwise, 1 should gladly have appealed to the names of the Mysians, 
Lycians, Carians, lonians, and Dardanians, discovered in the epic of 
Pantaur about 1400 b. C, in the reign of Rameses II ; and to the name 
of Acha»ans, read by certain Egyptian scholars in an inscription at 
Karnak, ascribed to the time of Meneptah, the son of Bameses II. 
What we shall have to learn more and more is that the people of antiq- 
uity, even though they spoke different languages and used different 
alphabets, knew far more of each other, even at the time of Amenophis 
III, or 1400 B. o., than was supposed by even the best historians. The 
ancient world was not so large and wide as it seemed, and the number 
of representative men was evidently very small. The intiuence of 
Babylon extended far and wide. We know that several of the strange 
gods worshiped by the Jews, such as Rimmon, Nebo, and Sin, came 
from Babylon. The authority of Egypt also was felt in Palestine, in 
Syria, and likewise in Babylon. The authenticity of the cuneitorm 
dispatches found at Tel-el-Amarna in Egypt has lately received an 
unexpected confirmation from tablets found at Tel-el-Hesy, probably 
the ancient Lachish. Here a letter has been found addressed to Zim- 
rida, who in the Tel-el-Amarna tablets was mentioned as governor of 
Lachish, where he was murdered by his people.* In the same place 
cylindeis were found of Babylonian manufacture, between 2000 and

1500 B, o., and copies, evidently iiiade of them in the West. Similar 
cylinders occur in the tombs of Cyprus and Syria, helping us to tix 
heir dates, and showing- once uiore the intercourse between East and 
West, and the ancient migration of E;istern thought toward Europe. 

Kor should we, when looking for clmnnels of communication between 
the ancient kingdoms of Asia, forget the Jews, who Avere more or les.> 
at home in every ])art of the world. We must remember that they 
came originally from Vr of the Chaldees, then migrated to Canaan, and 
afterwards sojourned in Egypt, before they settled in Palestine. Afte 
that we know how they were led into ca})tivity and lived in close prox- 
imity and daily intercourse with Medians, Persians, Babylonians, and 
Assyrians. They spoke of Cyrus, a believer in Ormazd, as the anointed 
and the shepherd of Jehovah, because he allowed tliem to return from 
Babylon to Jeiusalem. Darius, likewise a follower of Zoroaster, Avas 
looked on by them as their patron, becaused he favored the re-building 
ot the Temple at Jerusalem. When we consider these intimate rela- 
tions between the Jews and their neighbors and conquerors, we can 
easily imagine what useful intermediaries they must always have been 
in the intellectual exchange of the ancient world. 

There are two countries only which really ren)ained absolutely iso- 
lated in the ])ast, China and India. It is true that attempts have oeL^a 
made to show that the Chinese intiuenccd the inhabitants of India in 
very ancient times by imparting to them their earliest astronomy. But 
Biot's arguments have hardly convinced anybody. And as to Chinese 
porcelain being found in ancient Egyptian tombs, this too has long 
been surrendered for lack of trustworthy evidence. 

Nor have the attemi>ts been more successful which were intended to 
show that the ancient astronomy of India was borrowed from Baby- 
lon. It is well known that the Babylonians excelled in astronomy, and 
that in latter times they became the teachers of the Greeks, and indi- 
rectly of the Indians. But the 27 Vedic Nakshatras or lunar stations 
are iDerfectly intelligible as produced on Indian soil, and require ]io 
foreign intiuenc^ for their explanation. If the Indians had in Vedic 
times been the pu])ils of the Babylonians, other traces of tliat inter- 
course could hardly be absent. It was indeed thought for a time that 
one Avord at least of Babylonian origin had been discovered in the hymns 
of the Rig-Veda, the Babylonian iikdkI, a ceitain weight of gold. This 
AA^ord has certainly travelled far and wide. We tind it in the tablets of 
Tel-el-Amarna, in Hebrew, in Arabic, in (ireek. and in Latin.* inhid, a 
mine. But the verse in the Big- Veda in Avhich tliis )iunu( was sui)posed 
to occur, re(juires a different inter])retation nor Avouldone Avord be suhi 
cient to indicate ai real intellectual intercourse between Babylonians 
and Vedic Indians, On the same ground Ave can hardly use the Avord 
sindhu in the Babylonian inscriptions as proving a commercial inter-

course between India and Babylon. Sindhu, as my learned friend, 
Prof. Sayce, informs me, occurs in cuneiform texts as far back as 3000 
B. C. as the name of some textile fabric. In Sanskrit saindhava would 
mean what grows on tlie Sindhu or the Indus,* and would therefore 
be a very good name for cotton or linen. But so long as this word 
stands alone, it would not be safe to build any conclusions on it as to 
an ancient trade between India and Babylon. 

For the pix^sent, therefore, we must continue to look upon China and 
India as perfectly isolated countries durir.g the period of which we are 
here speaking. But though in the ej^es of the historian tlie ancient 
literature of these two countries loses in consecpience much of its inter- 
est, it acquires a new and peculiar interest of its own in the eyes of the 
phiU)sopher. It is entirely home grown and home-spun, and tlius forms 
an indei)endeut parallel to all the other literature of the world. It has 
been truly said that the religion and the phdosophy of India come upon 
us like meteors from a distant planet, perfectly independent in their 
origin and in their character. Hence, when they do agree witli other 
religions and philosophies of the ancient world, they naturally inspire 
us with the sanu^ conhdence as when two mathematicians, working 
quite independently, arrive in tlie end at the same results. t 

It is true that in these days of unexpected discoveries we are never 
entirely safe from surprises. But as far as our evidence goes at pres- 
ent — and we can never say more — the idea once generally entertained 
and lately revived by Prof. Gruppe, that there was some connection 
between the ancient religion of India and those of Egypt and Babylon 
IS, from a scholar's i)oint of view, simply impossible. Before the time 
of Alexander the Great it would be very difHcult to point out any 
foreign intellectual importation into the land of the Indus or the 
Seven Rivers. The knowledge of the alphabet nuiy have reached 
India a little before Alexander's invasion. We know that Darius sent 
Skylax on a scientitic expedition down to the mouth of the Indus. This 
expedition, like other scientific expeditions, was the forerunner of Per- 
sian conquests along the Indus. The people called in the cuneiform 
inscriptions Gaddra and Hidhu, that is, in Sanskrit, Ganhddra and 
Sindhu^ occur among the conquests of Darius, at least in his later 
inscriptions. It is quite possible therefore that even at that early time 
a knowledge of reading and writing may have been comuumicated to 
India. Travellers from India were seen by Ktesias in Persia at the 
beginning of the fifth century B. c, and he describes some whom he 
had seen himself as being as fair, or actually as white, as any in the 
world. Others he describes as black, not by exposure to the sun, but 
by nature. This was probably written at the same time when Buddha, 
in a sermon which he delivered (the Assalayana Sutta), said : " The

Bralinians are the white caste, the other castes are black/' Tliis refers 
to their coh)r {r<(ni<i), not, as has been sni)p()sed, to their character. 

But we have as yet no real evidence of writing, not even of inscrip- 
tions, in India before the time of Asoka, in the third century b. c. 
Tlie Indian alphabets certainly came from a Semitic alphabet, which 
was adapted, systematically, to the requirements of an .\.iyan language. 
We can see it still in a state of fermentation in the local varieties that 
have lately been pointed out by my friend. Prof. Biihler, the iiighest 
authority on this subject. As to the religion of Buddha being influ- 
enced by foreign thought, no true scholar now dreams of that. The 
religion of Buddlia is the danghter of the oldBrahmanic religion, and 
a daughter in many respects more beautiful than the mother. On the 
contrary, it was through Buddhism that India for the first time stepped 
forth trom its isolated position, and became an actor in the historical 
drama of the world. A completely new idea in the history of the 
world was started at the third Buddhist Council in the third century 
B. c, under King Asoka, the idea of conquering other nations, not by 
force of arms, bnt by the jiower of truth. A looiution was proposed 
and cairied at that council to send missionaries to all neighboring 
nations to preach the new gosi)el of Buddha. Such a resolution would 
never have entered into the minds of the ancient Egyptians, Babylon- 
ians, Assyrians, not even of the Brahmans. It pre-supposed quite a 
new conception of the world. It announced for the first time a belief 
that the different nations of the world, however separated from each 
other by language, religion, color, and customs, formed nevertheless 
one united family; that each of its members was responsible for the 
rest; in fact, that humanity was not an empty word. 

It is a curious coincidence, if no more, that the name of the missionary 
who, according to the chronicle of Ceylon, was sent to the North, to 
the Himalayan border lands, namely Madhyama, should have been 
found in a Stui)a near Sanchi, as well as that of his fellow-worker, 
Kasyapa. We read in an inscription: "These are (the relics) of the 
goodman of the family of Kasyapa, the teacherof the whole Haimavata," 
that is, the Himalayan border land.* We seldom find such monumental 
confirmations in Indian history. This important discovery, like so 
many others, was due to Gen. Cunningham, in one of his earlier works. 
{The Bkilsa Topes, pp. 119, 187, 317.) 

China, the other isolated country of antiquity, was soon touched by 
the rising stream of Buddhism, and thus brought for the first time into 
contact with India and the rest of the world. The first waves of 
Buddhism seem to have reached the frontiers of China as early as the 
third century (217 B. c), and so rapid and constant was its progress 
that in 61 b. c. Buddhism was accepted by the Emperor Miugti as one 
of the three state-religions of China. We soon hear of Buddhists in 
other countries also, and if we consider that we have now arrived

at a third period in the history of aiiti<iuity, which may truly be 
called the Alexandrian or Alexandrinian period, we need not wonder 
that the military roads which liave been opened from the Indus to the 
]^.nplirates and to the jVIediterranean were soon trodden by peaceful 
travellers also, carrying both industrial and intellectual merchandise 
from East to West. From Kashmir, Buddhist missionaries seem to have 
penetrated into Hellenised Bactri. Alexander Polyhistor, who wrote 
between 80 and 60 b. C. attests their presence there under the name of 
Samanioi., which stands for the Pali name Samana, a Buddhist friar. 
Their presence in Bactria is attested somewhat later, at the beginning 
of the third century A, D., by Clement of Alexandria, Avho speaks of 
the Samanaioi as powerful philosophers among the Bactrians, and 
again by Eusebius, at the beginning of the fourth century, who writes 
that among the Indians and Bactrians there are many thousands of 
Brahmans. With regard to Bactria this can refer to Buddhists only, 
for the old orthodox Brahmans did not leave their country, and 
Brahman has always been retained by the Buddhists as a title of honour 
for themselves. Early traces of the Buddhist religion have been dis- 
covered likewise in the countries north of Bactria, in Tukhara, and in 
the towns of Khoteu, Yarkand, and Kashyar. M. Darmesteter has 
shown that in the second century li. c. Buddhist missionaries were 
hard at Avork in the western part of Persia, and it is a signiticant fact 
that tlie name of Gantama, the founder of Buddhism, occurs in the 
Avesta, in the Fravardin Yasht.* This shows how close!}' the most 
distant parts of the world had been brought together by the genius of 
Alexander the Great, and by the genius of that still greater conqueror, 
Gautama Sfdcyamuni. Here again, it is mainly due to the labors of 
Oriental scholars that so many traces of the work done by Alexander 
and his successors Iiave been rediscovered. With Alexander we have 
entered on a new period in the history of the world, a period marked 
by the first strong reaction of the West against the East, inaugurated 
in the fifth century B. C. hy the victories of Marathon, Thermopyht;, 
and Salamis, which were almost contemporary with the first victories 
of Buddha. But while the victories of Miltiades, Leonidas, and Alex- 
ander the Great belong to history only, Buddha, the Gina or Victor, as 
he is called, is still the ruler of the majority of mankind. - - - 

I have so far tried to show what Oriental scholarship has done for us 
in helping us to a right ai:)preciation of the historical develo])nient of 
the human race, beginning on the Asiatic continent and reaching its 
highest consunlmation on this small Asiatic peninsula of ours, which 
we call Europe, nay, on this Aery spot where we are now assembled, 
which has truly been called the center of the whole world. It is due 
to Oriental scholarship) that the gray twilight of ancient history has 
been illuminated as if by the rays of an unsuspected sunrise. We see

700 ORIENTAL SCFTOLARSHIP DUEING THE PRESENT CENTURY. 

continuity and unity of ])ur})ose from beginning to end, when before 
we saw ^lotliing but an undeeipherable cliaos. With every new dis- 
covery tliat is made, whether in the royal libraries of Babyh^nia, or in 
the royal tond)s of Egypt, or in the sacred l)ooks of Persia and India, 
the rays of that sunrise are spreading wider and wider, and under its 
light the ancient history of our race seems to crystallize, and to dis- 
close in the very forms of its crystallization, laws or purposes running 
through the most distant ages of the world, of which our forefathers 
had no suspicion. Here it is where Oriental studies appeal, not to 
specialists only, but to all who see in the history of the human race 
the supreme i)roblem of all philosophy, a problem which in the future 
will have to be studied, not as heretofore, by /r^^/Zor?' reasoning, but 
chietly by the light of historical evidence. The Science of Language, 
the Science of Mythology, the Science of Religion, aye, the Science of 
Thought, all have assumed a new asi)e(^t, chietly through the discoveries 
of Oriental scholars, who have placed facts in the ]»lace of theories and 
disi)layed before us the historical development of the human race as 
a worthy rival of the development of nature, displayed before our eyes 
by the genius and patient labors of Darwin. - - - 

But, before T conclude, nmy 1 be allowed to tax jour i)atience a 
few minutes longer, and to ask one more (piestion, though I know 
that many here present are far more competent to return an authorita- 
tive answer to it than your president. Is the benefit to be derived from 
Oriental studies to be confined to a better understanding of the past, 
to a truer insight into that marvellous drama, the history of the human 
race in the East and in the West, whether in historic or prehistoric 
times? May not our Oriental studies call for general sympathy and 
support, as helping us to abetter understanding of the present, luiy, 
of the future also, with regard to the ever-increasing intercourse 
between the East and the West? Why should so many practical men, 
so many statesmen, and rulers, and administrators of Eastern countries, 
have joined our Congress, if they did not expect some important prac- 
tical advantages from the study of Eastern languages and Eastern lit- 
erature ? 

If the old ]>ernicious i)rejudice of the white man against the black, 
of the Aryan against the Semitic race, of the Greek against the Bar- 
barian, has been inherited by ourselves, and there are few who can say 
that they are entirely free from that (Uuiniosa iKvycditas, m)thing, I 
believe, has so powerfully helped to remove, or at h'ast to soften it, as 
a more widely spread study of Oriental languages and literature. 



STONE AOE P.ASIS FOR OKIENTAT, STTTDY.* 



By Prof. E. B. Tylor, F. K. S. 



It seems si suitable iutrodiictiou to the work of this section to sur- 
vey broadly the races belonging to the vast Oriental region and to 
examine the information now available as to the order of their stages 
of civilization. In the large definition adopted by this Congress, the 
Oriental world reaches its extreme limits. It embraces the continent 
of Asia, stretching through Egypt over Africa, and into Europe over 
Tnrke^, and Greece, while extending in the far East from group to 
gr p of ocean islands, where Indonesia, ^Melanesia, Micronesia, and 
Polynesia lead on to the continent of Australia and its outlier, Tas- 
mania. Immense also is the range of time through which the culture- 
history of this Oriental region may be, if often but dimly, traced. His- 
tory illuminates its comparatively later periods. The earlier can only 
be inferentially reconstructed by com[»arison of the still representative 
races and languages, and their renniins materially i)reserved in the vsoil 
and intellectually in culture; that is, in the arts, institutions, and beliefs 
which have lasted on from the ancient world. On the maps which 
represent the Oriental world, as known to history, we see a band of 
civilized nations stretching from Egypt through Phenicia, Babylonia, 
Assyria, Medo-Persia, India, China. This compact culture band is 
underlaid by traces of former barbarism and geographically skirted by 
barbaric border-lands, while a savage region is either actually met with 
beyond these limits, or its former existence inferred inside as well as 
outside them. In agreement with recognized principles of the develop 
ment of culture, it may, I think, be taken that the low culture extending 
widest, represents the earliest platform of culture over the whole regign ; 
that an inner but still vast inlying district rose to the barbaric level, 
and that within this again the higher cultitre area was formed. Indeed, 
the terrace-temple of Babylonia, where terraces narrower, but more 
lofty, rise one above another, seems to my mind a suggestive model of 
these stages of culture : where the higher- degree covers the smaller area.

702 STONE AGE BASIS FOR ORIENTAL STUDY. 

It is to the wide foundation platform of Oriental culture that my remarks 
to-day specially refer, not from any over-estimation of the importance of 
this basis, as compared with the higher stages, but because these latter 
have, with the aid of historical record, become more familiar to the 
studious world; while as to the lowest and widest Oriental culture 
level, I have even some new evidence to offer. 

The former i^resence of races of low culture in countries where none 
now remain is more than by any other symptom proved by the presence 
in the ground of stone implements and other objects characteristic of 
low culture amonj^ modern savages and barbarians, and doubtless also 
characteristic in the remote past. Thus tlie Stone Age is practically 
identified with the savage and low barbaric periods. Moreover, the 
usual division of the Stone Ago into the later and higher Xeolithic or 
ground stone i)eriod, and the earlier and lower Paleolithic or chipped 
stone period, the evidence for which has been thoroughly threshed out, 
may here be taken for granted. As to the Paleolithic period, discov- 
eries of the last generation have established the presence of tribes of 
men over a large part of Europe whose high antiquity is shown by the 
geological i^osition in which their relics are found in Quaternary gravel- 
beds and caves, and by their association with that extinct fauna which 
gives their age the concise name of the Mammoth period. That.their 
stage of culture was that of savage hunters and fishers is obvious from 
the rude stone implements themselves, and from other objects of more 
or less Eskimo tyi)e, while at the same time, carvings and scratched 
outlines of animals show an extraordinary sense of art. It has been 
proved also that the rude tribes, whose existence was argued from their 
rudely chipped stone instruments, Avere not confined to Europe. Let 
us notice their few but important occurrences within our Oriental area. 

Egypt, it is important to notice, has yielded imi)]ements of well- 
marked Paleolithic type, a solid basis for its history of culture. They 
may be traced on into Syria, while the laterite l)eds of South India, 
by their similar quartzite implenu'nts, testify to the former habitation 
of the Peninsula by tribes there representing the primitive savage life. 
In Siberia, where the remains of the nuimmoth have been preserved so 
perfectly, I should think that the weapons of coeval man might prob- 
ably be found in corresponding quantity, but, so far as I know, no 
thorough quest for them has yet been made.. 

At the farthest extreme of our Oriental boundary in Tasmania 
stone implements which njust be classed as low Paleolithic in type 
appear. So remarkable are the characters of these implements and the 
circumstances of theiroccurrence, that as they are very scarce in Europe 
I have j)laced on the table all the specimens I have been as yet able to 
obtain. The point I have to draw attention to is that though of rude- 
ness beyond that of the remotest ages known, they remain in use into 
our own time. It is now more than thirty years since my attention was 
aroused by seeing a stone implement from Tasmania in the museum of 



STONE AGE BASIS FOR ORIENTAL STUDY. 703 

the Soniersetsliire Natural Flistoiy Society at Taunton, which led me 
to make inquiry at the International Exhibition ot ISGli ot Dr. Milli- 
gau and other repre.sentatives of Tasmania. Their answer 1 printed 
in I860, Avith a comi)arison with the implements of the Paleolithic age. 
'^ The Tasmanians sometimes used for cutting or notching wood a very 
rude instrument. Eye witnesses describe how they would pick up a 
suitable hat stone, knock off chips trom one side, partly or all round the 
edge, and use it without more ado; and there is a specimen correspond- 
ing exactly to this description in the Taunton ^luseum. An implement 
found in the drift near Clermont would seem to be much like this,'' 
[Early History of Mankind^ p. 195). This, if not the earliest published 
notice of these Tasnumian implements was one of the earliest; but it 
will be observed that it did not yet amount to stating that these rude 
savages used no stone implements except such rudely chi})ped cues, for 
it was not yet proved that they did so. This proot was required to 
bring the Tasmanians into the position where 1 wish to i>lace tliem 
before you now, that of modern savage representatives of the remotely 
ancient Paleolithic ages. The requisite evidence has since been sup- 
plied by the archaeologists and geologists of the Royal Society of Tas- 
mania. 

It was not a (piestion merely of studying the make of imi)lements 
buried in the ground, as the time was not yet past for descriptions by 
Englishmen who had actually seen how the natives made and used 
these roughest of human implements. They might be mere fragments 
l»icked up or detached by a blow from the rock, but the more artificial 
tools were much improved upon by skillfully, with another stone, strik- 
ing off chips along the margin, so as to give a good cutting edge; but 
tins edge-chipping was only done on one side. The natives were never 
known to grind an edge, nor to fix the chipped stones in any kind of 
handle. Of this, the accounts of observers who saw the art carried on, 
and who, one would think, must have been aware if the natives could 
do anything better, may be taken as good testimony. At any rate it 
is proof positive tliat such specimens as are here exhibited are char- 
acteristic of the general standard of the Tasmaiiian implement-maker's 
art. It is seen by comparison with ordinary Paleolithic implements 
from the drift-gravels and bone-caves that the modern savage was dis- 
tinctly lower than the ancient. The pick of the Europeans of the 
Mammoth period, edged and pointed by alternate chipping on both 
sides, is far superior to anything seen or described in Tasmania. The 
typical '-hatchet" or "tomahawk," as it is sometimes called, of Tas- 
mania, is at most the equivalent of the one-side edged " scraper" of 
Paleolithic Europe. 

Thus it appears that in this far off corner of the Oriental world Paleo- 
lithic man. not even of the highest, had survived within living memory. 
The question must of course be raised as to whether the low stage of 
Tasmanian implements may be due to degeneration; but it is difflcult, 



704 STONE AGE BASIS FOR ORIENTAL STUDY. 

without altering our conception of human nature, to suppose the rude 
ancestors of the savages to have habitually edged their chopping-stoues 
on both sides, and given up this for the one-edged flake, for many pur- 
poses mucli less effective. Not less instructive is the fact that the Tas- 
manians were not known to fix their chopping-stones in any kind of 
handle, but only to grasp them in their bare hands. What was the 
practice in this lespect among the Europeans of the Mammoth i)eriod 
is not yet (juire conclusively known. Some ot their tools or weapons 
were obvnjiisly made for grasping in the hand. Others may have been 
fixed to wooden hafts, though it is hardly proven that they actually 
were. At any rate, the Tasiimnian exam])le warns us iiot to rely on the 
argument that to i)nt a handle to a hatchet inust have suggested itself 
naturally to the lowest savages, for it seems not to ha\ e suggested itself 
to Tasmanians. When they saw the European hatchet and how to use 
It, they "were transported with joy.' and took to it at once. If their 
ancestors, liavnig fixed their chipi)ed stones m withes or boughs, after- 
wards held them in their naked hands instead, man is a less intelligent 
animal than other experience of him would a\ arrant. Even if it should 
prove by further quest that stone implements of higher finish, say equal 
to the Australian, occur in the ground or were made by the Tasma- 
nians, this would not much alter the inferences as to their culture-his- 
tory, but would still leave the Tasmanians as a people actually seen in 
modern times to pursue their life on a Paleolithic footing under cir- 
cumstances where Neolithic man would have pra(;tised his higher art. 
We can hardly overestimate the anthropological importance of this 
negroid race, whose grievous extirpation so sadly clouds our colonial his- 
tor3\ in the light of tliese facts Paleolithic man ceases to be a mystery, 
now tliat we can see the portraits and examine the life of his far P^ast- 
ern counterpart They enable us to realize, at least in vague outline, 
a state ol man in geological antiquity which has lasted on into modern 
life. It is most instructive to examine what the condition of these mod- 
ern Paleolithic people was in other respects, and the labors of Mr. Ling 
Rotii, who has collected ill a single volume (" The Tasnidnians"' London, 
bS90) almost every scrap of record, puts it before the world in a i)ic- 
ture which, considering how much of the evidence comes irom unedu- 
cated witnesses, is on the whole remarkably consistent. Of savage 
tribes not in a state of decay, the Tasmanians may be reckoned among 
the lowest known. Their want of art in stone impleuientniaking agreed 
with their condition as to other weapons and tools. They had no boAv 
and arrow, like that of their Australian neighbors, no throwing-stick 
to burl their spears, and their spears, though they seem to have known 
how to point them with a human bone, were usually long sticks 
straightened by bending, and the points of which had been thrust into 
the fire and sharpened. These, and wad^lies or clubs tolerably Rlia{>ed, 
were their weapons of the chase and war. They had not even the 
rude bark canoe of the Australians, but a canoe-like raft ot rolls of 



STONE AGE BASIS FOR ORIENTAL STUDY. 705 

bark. They were string-makers, good plaiters, and basket-makers, 
and it is noticed that some of their stitches and phiits are familiar in 
our own basket-work and point lace. They made fire with the ordinary 
fire-drill. Their wandering life accounts for the rudeness of their sim- 
ple huts and wind-shelters of boughs and bark. Mentally, they have 
been well defined in the following words: '^ Their intellectual character 
is low, yet not so inferior as often described. They appeared stupid 
when addressed on subjects which had no relation to their mode of 
life, but they were quick and cunning within their own sphere." 

Morally, it is not difficult to understand how two kinds of state- 
ments are made about them, which seem incompatible, but are not 
really so. Their inofi'ensiveness when not ill treated or alarmed or hos- 
tile, gave place to sly and rancorous cruelty toward those they regarded 
as enemies. Their nomad life brought with it the ancient savage cus- 
tom of abandoning the sick and aged. As nomad hunters they had 
but the first rudiments of government by the strong man of the tribe; 
but as usual among such tribes, when war broke out, the authority of 
a leader or Mar chief was recognized. The two great tests, language 
and religion, hardly place the Tasmaniaus below recognized savage 
levels. Enough of their language is preserved to show it as simj)le 
and scanty, of an agglutinating type, mi-na=I, mi-to = to me; pugga-na=

verbally man-one (obviously he held out one hand). There is a propor- 
tion of emotional and imitative words, and no doubt it is true, as 
described, that their sentences depended much on tone and gesture. 
It would have been most instructive to have had examples of how this 
was managed, but, unfortunately, here the information fails. The Tas- 
manian is distinctly a low orga'jized language, but not at all a language 
belonging to man in what is called " a state of nature." Still less is 
this the case with the Tasmanian religion, which is a well-marked 
animism, extending about as high in its development as among other 
savages. The accounts given by a number of Europeans, of whom 
some confused white man's ideas with native, require criticism ; but 
the mistakes generally disappear on comparison, and the vocabularies, 
which show what religious ideas the natives had words for, are an 
excellent test. It is quite clear that the word icarraica=shndow 
served them to describe the souls of the dead, who became guardian 
spirits of their friends and hostile, ghosts to their enemies, so feared 
that men would not willingly go out at night; that there was a good 
land of the dead, with life like this continuing, or that this land came 
to be identified with England, whence the dead came back as white 
men ; that demon spirits could i)ossess men with epilepsy and other 
spirits could expel them; that the laud and forest swarmed with spirits, 
among whom is especially mentioned the echo, which tlrey called 
SM 93 45

linliamia «-wr/-rtM"ma = talking .shadow. The spirit or god Bediarapa, 
whose name was identified witli thunder and lightning, and who was 
feared accordingly, is vouched for by full evidence; but the deity, 
"whom they call the good spirit," and who presides over the day, is 
not to be found in the vocabularies, and collapses on comparison of 
documents. 

Taken all together, there is deliniteness in these accounts of a low 
Stone Age people seen in actual modern existence. How is it that 
modern savage man should differ so little from man at the highest 
geological antiquity? The answer seems to be that of possible perma- 
nence as well as possible development in culture. Let a tribe arrive 
at a condition of equilibrium with surrounding nature, its '•'■ milieu 
environnant,^^ to use the phrase of Lamarck, in which it can hold its 
own, this may be a condition whicli suggests no progress. As there 
were shells of the Tertiary period indistinguishable from those now 
living, so there are men. Behind the Paleolithic period lies that unde- 
fined past which, whether keeping tribes unchanged under unchanged 
conditions or changing under changing conditions, has to account for 
the condition of savage man, which indeed is within a moderate inter- 
val of our own. It is a question not of nature, but of degree. 

The Oriental area thus i^resents a basis of man in the Paleolithic 
stage of culture, relics of which remarkably occur in boundary districts. 
Let us now examine the Oriental area occupied by traces of the Neo- 
lithic stage. 

The South Sea Islanders are the best known of high Stone Age 
peoples. On the continent of Asia history knows of some peoples, the 
Ichthyophagi of the Beluchistau coast and the aboriginp! tribes of China, 
as still using stone tools or weapons, but for the most part the former 
use of these is only apparent by the celts and arrow-heads of stone 
found in the ground, and exi^lained mystically by peoples who have 
forgotten their real purpose. Hindus still worship a polished celt under 
a sacred tree as a symbol of Mahadeva, and the Japanese see in the 
arrow-heads they x^ick up in the fields the spirit-arrows of storm fights 
in the sky. Egypt here, as usual, vindicates its place as the museum 
of culture-development. The flint arrow-heads and ceremonial flint- 
knives have long been known, and now the researches of Mr. Petrie 
show Egypt, not in its remotest antiqui^y, actuallj'^ emerging from the 
age of stone into that of copper and bronze, flint-flakes remaining in 
use for cutting and chipping tools and to arm the reaper's sickle. This 
is an industrial condition which may remind us of that of Mexico before 
the Spanish conquest. 

This consideration of the Oriental world during the Neolithic or later 
Stone Age raises a problem which is complementary, and in some 
respects converse, to that of the development of culture. It leads us to 
trace the migration of culture ft-om the higher nations into the lower. 
Even in what is called the unchanging East the culture of the ruder 



STONE AGE BASIS FOR ORIENTAL STUDY. 707 

tribes is far from being (so to speak) their own, so i)ali)ab]yhas it been 
affected by the influence of foreigners of higher and, consequent!}^, more 
powerful organization, thoughts, and arts. In the present state of 
anthropology it is particularly desirable to ask the opinions of special 
students of the great Oriental nations, from Egypt to China, as to 
what may be called the old trade-routes by which ideas have been car- 
ried over the barbaric WM>rld. It seems that this carrying has beeu 
actively going on within the limits of what is technically known as the 
Stone Age. Ever since Cook's voyages the Polynesians have stood, and 
rightly so, as especially representative of the Stone Age. And yet the 
traces of their communication with cultured Asia are shown by various 
symptoms. Playing on the Jew's-harp and flying kites are the sports 
of Asiatic nations, but they spread contimuiusly from Asia over Mela- 
nesia and Polynesia, where they may have been before the late times 
in which they find their w^ay into Europe. 

Especial interest attaches to the system of the universe j)revaleut 
over tiie South Sea Islands, examined so as to show how far it differs 
from the simple doctrine of the three worlds, the /W/oAa of earth, firma- 
ment, hell — a system which, resting on the apparent direct evidence of 
the senses, belongs everywhere to man in the earliest stages of knowl- 
edge. The Polynesian systems I take as so obviously belonging to the 
borrowed and degenerate forms of the Babylonian planet-system that 
I think the questions open are merely in which form and by what route 
they spread over the Pacific Islands. According to the ideas of the 
Mangaians themselves, the earth they live on is on the top of a vast hol- 
low cocoanut shell, the interior of which is Avaiki, the under- world, 
into which the sun and moon descend by western openings and rise in 
the East. Above, the ten heavens of the blessed spirits rise one above 
the other. Below, the dismal Hades is divided into stages of gloom 
and decay, down to mere nothingness. 

In the New Zealand cosmology, as recorded by Mr. John AVhite in 
his Ancient History of the Maori, we have a system of the same source, 
only varying in details. Above the fiat earth the ten heavens rise in 
successive strata. The lowest three contain the clouds and storms, 
and the lake, which by its overflow pours down rain and hail. Above 
these are seven heavens inhabited by human souls, other spirits, and 
gods, up to the highest, where Rehua dwells. The counteri)art, ten 
hells, or rather, stages of the under-world, have the fonr uppermost 
under Hine-niu-te-po, Great Woman Night, so that it is there that the 
sun sets. Below are six more dismal regions, in the lowest three of 
which is the goddess Meru, the lowest of all being called Meto — that 
is, extinct or putrid. 

Now it is plain that the knowledge of astronomy of the Polynesians 
neither needed nor authorized these schemes of strata above and below, 
of which they could Jiuow nothing; but regarded as degenerate ver- 
sions of the Babylonian-Greek astronomy, where the orbits of the sun, 



708 STONE AGE BASIS FOR ORIENTAL STUDY. 

moon, and five planets were iuteri)ieted as indicating the seven con- 
centric splieres, with others for the fixed starS; the difficulty is met. 
Even in the Hindu, lUiddhist, and Moslem systems of" the universe, 
though derived from this planetary source, the planetary part (all, 
indeed, that gives the system its value) has long since dropped out of 
sight, and the spaces the heavenly bodies occupied have been turned to 
account in complex series of heavens and hells. Both the Indian and 
Moslem systems may be easily traced into the Indian Archipelago, and 
it is a last, and I think not unreasonable, step to suppose them spread- 
ing over the Pacific Islands. The ^Mangaian and Maori schemes even 
bear a closer resemblance to the Hindu than to the Moslem, indicating 
Indian religions as their carriers. 

Thus I close this attempt to lay a Stone Age basis (if I may use the 
expression) for the study of Oriental civilization. Not attemi)ting here 
to rise to the Metal Age and to begin the study of the higher stages, to 
which alone it has been habitual to confine the term civilization, I com- 
mend to Oriental scholars the thought (of which it is well never to lose 
sight) of the humbler and more ancient stages of life which underlie it.

MEMBKR OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.

I'ermunoit Secretartj of Ihe Acadenn/ of Science)*. 



Tlie learned man whom I j^resent to your attention to-day — Henry 
Milne-Edwards — is a peculiar and interesting- fignre among Frencli nat- 
uralists, equally distiuguislied by liis origin, by the period to wliicli be 
belonged, by liis discoveries, his system of instruction, the pupils he 
trained, and by the lasting intluence he exercised upon natural history 
during a long life entirely devoted to sciince and his country. He 
filled a great place in our academy and rendered service to zoology 
and to higher education that will not be forgotten. 

His life exhibits many interestinf? changes. The son of a foreigner, 
an Englisliman, lie was eager to be identified with. France, furnishing a 
new proof of that assimilating power which has always been one of the 
strong points of our nation. This i)roof was all the more marked that 
the young Edwards api)ears to have been at first rich enough not to 
depend upon any special advantage he might derive from his title to 
French citizenship. Afterwards, however, to the benefit of mankind 
and the honor of our country, necessity urged our fnture brother to the 
scientific career in which he was to fill so important a position. This 
was about the first third of the century which is now so near its eud. 
The great founders of modern zoology of the nineteenth century, Cuvier 
and Geoffrey Saint-Hilaire, had nearly reached the term of their careers. 
After a struggle, which will long be celebrated in the history of the 
sciences, Cuvier stood victorious, and his pnpils were almost the sole 
leaders in the line of instruction, following the methods of their mas- 
ter and striving to complete, according to his principles, the framework 
of a theory which seemed henceforth to be based upon a strong and 
immovable foundation, with distinct boundary lines, in the ]>crmanence 
of species. The classification founded upon the so-called natural method 
and supported by observations of comparative anatomy Avas then con- 
sidered the ultimate end of zoology.

710 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF HENRY MILNE-EDWARDS. 

Just at this time appeared Milne-Edwards. His Natural History of 
Crustaceans appeared at first sight to be a simple development of the 
teachings of Cuvier, but lie infused into them an entire order of new 
and fruitful ideas drawn from physiology which greatly modified the 
conception of the principle then held — that of the subordination of 
types, Milne-Edwards placed side by side with this another i^rinciple 
prolific in consequences — that of thedivisiou of labor — and it contributed 
to the inauguration of a great system of studies and theories which 
shivered the conventional framework of classification, placed in doubt 
and rendered purely relative that permanence of species — the corner- 
stone of Cuvier's system — propounded in short the great problems of 
the origin and i)rogress in evolution of the types of organized beings. If 
the light is not yet and never can be perfectly clear on the question of 
origin, it will not lessen the glory of the scientific generations that 
have followed during the last fifty years, bringing these questions into 
the foremost rank and breaking the mould of exclusive dogmatism. 

Without doubt the sagacious and temperate mind of Milne-Edwards 
sometimes refused to handle these problems ia all their bearings, but 
no less has he the great and lasting honor of having taken a personal 
share in their elaboration and of supplying some of their fundamental 
principles. Silence would be unjust to his memory, and I shall ask 
permission to express my sentiments later with regard to this work of 
his, as the time for hesitation is jiast. Everywhere in the civilized 
world these questions are continually agitated, and an excess of timidity 
would enfeeble the authority even of the Academy and French science. 
However uncertain and obscure they may seem, their interest to phi- 
losophy and human destiny is too great for us to refuse to present them 
here, with the gravity and reservations that respect for truth and the 
dignity of science demand. 

I. — HI8 CAREER. 

Henry Milne-Edwards was born at Bruges, October 23, 1800. We 
lost him on the 20th of July, 1885, his long life having been full of work 
profitable to humanity. He was the twenty-eighth child of William 
Edwards, planter and colonel of militia at Jamaica. His father was mar- 
ried twice. After leaving the colonies and then residing sometime in 
England he established himself in Belgium. There our fellow scientist 
was born, and he took advantage of the place of his birth, at that time 
part of France, to claim the title of French citizen after 1811. The 
sympathetic and hospitable genius of France has always known how 
to gain the affection of foreigners who dwell on her soil, and to associ- 
ate them by national ties with her own destiny she turns to account the 
inherent qualities of the races that cultivate her soil and those of 
neighboring ones, which she has always had the art and energy to 
assimilate by voluntary attraction. Few acquisitions of this kind have 
been more fruitful than that of Edwards. 



BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF HENRY MILNE-EDWARDS. 711 

William's love for our country luust have been very strong-, for it had 
resisted a severe test, he having been imprisoned by the Imperial 
police for seven years for aiding in the escape of some Englishmen 
incarcerated at Bruges. As soon as he was released, in 1814, he went 
to Paris to live, and reclaimed for his son the benefits of the law which 
recognized him as a French citizen. 

Meanwhile, owing to his captivity, he had not been able to conduct 
the early education of his son Henry; this was directed by a brother 
24 years older, and named William, after his father. This William 
Edwards also has become prominent among the physiologists of his 
time. He is one of the founders of the Ethnological Society of Paris, 
and has left some interesting ex}>eriments as a memorial. There is no 
doubt that by his example and the bent of his mind he exercised a great 
influence on the vocation of Henry. It is said that the latter, having 
received as a gift Buffonh Hisfori/ of Animals^ attempted to analyze it 
at the age of 11 years, the first indication of that inquiring spirit which 
at a later period constantly incited his mind to new discoveries. 

Reared in ease, married at the age of 23 to an amiable and distin- 
guished lady. Miss Laura Trezel, the daughter of a colonel who after 
ward became general and minister of war, it would appear that Henry 
Edwards under such circumstances need never have been called upon 
to expose himself to danger in the pursuit of the sciences. In the 
beginning of his career, if he took a diploma as doctor of medicine it 
was j)robably in consequence of the same i^rincipleby which his father, 
faithful to the ideas of Rousseau and the eighteenth century, made him 
learn a manual avocation. Henry lived surrounded by friends of his 
own age who were well instructed and had inquiring minds like him- 
self. He was then a rich young lover of art, intereste<l in painting, 
and above all in music, and we know he retained these fine tastes 
through life, manifesting them in the soirees he gave to men of letters 
at the museum. 

During the first years of the Restoration, the French mind, emerging 
from the long milifary repression of the Empire, took a new flight. 
Everywhere throughout the country and in all departments, intelligent 
men grouped together to take possession of the donniin that was 
enkindled anew to mental effort and liberty. Whilst William Edwards 
was more particularly allied with the learned physiologists and anat- 
omists, B^clard, Laennec, Breschet, and Magendie, his brother Henry 
cultivated the society of physicians and artists. These last he met at 
the Sorbonne, where the present generation would not be likely to look 
for such associations. 

This ancient refuge of theologians was at that time appropriated to 
lodgings for artists and sculjitors, later transformed into laboratories 
and dissecting rooms, which our times have in their turn torn down 
and rebuilt on a grander scale for other edu<'ational purposes. Perhaps 
we may be permitted to cast a parting regret at the old buildings 



712 BIOGRAPHICAL 8KETCH OF HENRY MILNE-EDWARDS. 

wliicli for two centuries have sheltered generations animated by a very 
different spirit, but equally devoted to the culture of the ideal. 

There Milne-Edwards enjoyed himself in the society of artists and 
seemed destined to pass his life in an elegant dilletantism, but fate had 
decreed otherwise, and the brilliant lover of art was to be tranformed 
into a savant of the tirst order. As is usually the case, this was effected 
by the pressure of necessity: Duris nrgens in, rebus egestas, the trans- 
formation took place. In 1825, in consequence of family circumstances, 
Henry's situation suddenly changed. He was obliged to give up an 
iuheritance that constituted the principal part of his possessions, and 
to labor for the necessary means of support for his family. The publi 
cation of elementary works on medicine and materia medica seems to 
have at tirst sufficed. At that time he met with help from the circle of 
devoted friends he had so well known how to make when he connected 
himself with distinguished young men like Dumas, Adolphe Brong- 
niart, and Audouin, all of whom before very long became scientific lumi- 
naries themselves. They all met later as fellow members in the bosom 
of our Academy. The friendly aid given to Edwards numifested itself 
in the line of original research and in his career of instructor. 

To speak first of this latter calling, it became to him a real vocation. 
In 1832 Mdne-Edwards was appointed professor of hygiene and natural 
history in the Central School of Arts and Manufactures, a school over 
which Dumas, as one of the original founders, exerted a powerful 
influence. Milne Edwards had declined the offer of a place in the 
school system of Belgium during the preceding year, at the time of the 
establishment of the new kingdom. 

For the last time he made a practical use of his medical knowledge 
in taking care of the sick, through a sentiment of pure devotion, dur- 
ing the great cholera epidemic of 1832. But from that time he turned 
in another direction, displaying more and more his double talent of 
IH'ofessor and writer. At one time he gave a course in natural history 
at Henry IV College, but only to the junior class. From the close of 
the year 1837 he no longer taught, as I can certify from my per- 
sonal recollection as a pupil of that College; his merit and his work 
called him to a higher sphere. In fact, on the 5th of November, 1838, 
he was ap])ointed a member of the Academy of Sciences in the zoolog 
ical section, to replace Frederick Cuvier, and in 1811 succeeded his 
friend, Victor Audouin, in the chair of entomology at the museum, 
which he exchanged in 1801 for that of mammology. In 1841 he added 
to this the title of chairman of the '• Faculte des Sciences,'' whicli he 
had filled as substitute since 1838, and his well-known spirit of order 
and justice caused him to be chosen dean m 1810; he filled the double 
offices of professor and dean at the Sorbonne u^) to the last day of his 
life, having faithfully discharged his public and i)rivate duties with 
great activity, without a break, and rarely ever so much as requiring 



BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF HENRY MILNE-EDWARDS. 713 

a substitute. Eecall that to complete liis cursnm Jionorum he was 
mnde clievalier of the Legion of Honor in 1834, and grand officer in his 
old age; that he belonged to the Royal Society of London, to the 
Academies of St. Petersburg, Berlin, Vienna, Brussels, Boston, Phila- 
delphia, etc., in brief, to most of the great societies of learned men. 
Honors of every kind, some of them official, others more precious, com- 
ing from savants his peers in different parts of the world, were contin- 
ually bestowed upon him, and day after day crowned this long life 
which had been consecrated to the search for truth. 

His private life was not always so happy ; it was marked by more than 
one of those painful crises from which no man can be exempt. 

I have told you the first difficulties he encountered from a material 
point of view, and how these difficulties only gave a greater impetus 
and energy to the scientific education of our fellow-worker. What 
happy hours he enjoyed when, refreshing himself from his daily labors 
in holiday excursions, he dedicated his journeys to Granville, the Chau- 
sey Isles, St. Malo, C'ancale, and Mount St. Michel, to original studies 
of marine animals in their native habitat on the seashore, making his 
observations direct from nature, dissecting fresh animals and sketching 
them with an accurate and skillful hand. 

These labors were accomplished with all the more enthusiasm that they 
were undertaken with his friend Audouin, both of them young, ardent, 
and accompanied by devoted wives who had no other ideals than their 
husbands, and who sketched and painted in water colors the animals 
that were captured each day. The Annals of Natural Sciences have 
preserved the record of this double collaboration by giving a place to 
their most interesting works on crustaceans, annelids, ascidians, 
polyps, and various zoophytes. 

Milne Edwards had already explored the coast of Provence and 
Italy, and in 1831, through his connection with General Trezel he was 
enabled to extend his investigations to Algiers. 

This domestic felicity was soon to become clouded by sorrow. More 
than half of his ten children died at an early age. Though he had the 
happiness of seeing his son Alphonse — first his pupil, then his com- 
petitor — succeed him at the museum, and become a fellow member of 
the Academy, and though his daughters, who married, successively, 
the son of Dumas, gave him the satisfaction of seeing heirs to two 
illnstrious names grow up around him, still his life was saddened by the 
ill health of his beloved wife, the partner of his struggles and successes 
for twenty years. In 1839 she was attacked by a serious lung trouble, 
which proved fatal at the close of three years in spite of the tender care 
lavished upon her by her devoted husband. 

He sought consolation in his work and in the friendship of the young 
savants around him whose studies he directed. Quatrefages, Blancli- 
ard, Lacaze-Diithiers, Marion, and many others, can bear witness to his 
sympathy for youth and his constant and zealous encouragement. 



714 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF HENRY MILNE-EDWARDS. 

If Milne-Edwards does not display the fervor of language and bold- 
ness of theory of some of his contemporaries, such as Blainville, none 
the less he roused a spirit of inquiry in his hearers, without which 
there can be no really original research and an enthusiasm which sus- 
tains the inquirer amidst the obscurities and disappointments of patient 
investigation. 

He made a toiu- of Sicily in 1844, in company with Quatrefages and 
Blanchard, that has become celebrated in the history of zoology. He 
did not hesitate to go down into the sea to a depth of 8 meters, by 
means of a diving apparatus, m order to study the life of marine 
animals. Tliis practice has now become customary at Roscoflfs labora- 
tory, under the direction of our co-worker, Lacaze-Duthiers, and the 
soundings of the Talisman revealed many other mysteries to Alphonse 
Milne-Edwards; but fifty years ago it was venturesome to take the 
initiative, the apparatus being less perfect, the use of it less under- 
stood, and it required considerable courage for a scientist to bury him- 
self in this fashion for the first time in the depths of the sea in order 
to wrest from it the secrets of life. 

At the same time, in the course of his daily life at Paris, Milne- Ed wards 
made his home at the nuiseum a center for learned men, gathering 
them around him in social evening reunions which are still remembered 
by my contemporaries. One was sure of meeting there the highest 
order of men, both Frenchmen and foreigners. Englishmen, attracted 
by a common nationality, or at least ancestry, came willingly, and we 
listened with respect to these men so devoted to science, an honor "to 
their country; they were living models of the in'ofession to which each 
of us intended to dedicate our lives. In the midst of this group the 
refined, pleasing figure of Milne-Edwards was always seen moving 
from one to another, ready to show his sympathy with each by an 
appropriate word to the young as well as the old, and to express his 
opinion, nearly always a characteristic one, in the scientific discussions 
going on around him. 

This social and stirring life which he enjoyed, was interrupted in 1856 
by a serious afte^'tion of the stomach. Milne Edwards had all his life 
suffered from a delicate constitution struggling to resist disease. It 
was thought at first that the crisis of this illness would be fatal. I 
can still recall that face, sallow from jaundice, the eyes bright with the 
fire of intellectual life. 

He at length partially triumphed over illness, it might be said by 
the strength of his will power. Not only did he refuse to submit to 
disease, but at this very time undertook the editing of his great work 
on comparative physiology and anatomy which was to occupy him for 
twenty-five years. What a forcible example of mental power, proving 
that man should never despair, however great the perils and tests of 
material or moral life! 

Meanwhile Milne-Edwards continued in the service of science and 



BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF HENRY MILNE-EDWARDS. 715 

ill tlie career of teacher. At the museuni, as at the Sorboiiiie, every- 
where, this litth^ mail was to l)e seen, firm, benevolent, always conversant 
with the least detail, whether administrative or scientific, ever ready 
to practice what he preached. Those who knew him in the council 
board of the University will not forget his kindly interest in watching 
the development of young scholars; they remember those note books, 
those special memoranda of their work and standing that he filed each 
day so conscientiously. He had in the highest degree the sentiment 
and love of the good. 

In this way he left his impress on the history of the '• Faculte des 
Sciences," at Paris, and aided in the revolution effected in the last 
twenty years, as well as in the entire system of higher instruction; 
both have been re-constructed under an impulse which more than one 
of my listeners has contributed to give by his support and devotion. 
I would cite as an example of the pioneer efforts of Milne-Edwards 
those scholarships for students which have proved so fruitful in the 
encouragement ot youthful talent in our i)ublic educatioiuil institutions. 
He started tliis system in 1849 by means of limited assistance, which 
was withdrawn, owing to the vfolent reaction of that i)eriod, but was 
continued on a larger scale thirty years later through tlie liberality of 
the republican government. 

Of a different but not less usefnl class, the scientific excursions of 
Milne-Edwards and his pupils to the sea-shore were the prelude to the 
creation of those stations of marine zoology now encircling our coast, 
like a crown of honor, through the zeal of such men as Lacaze-Duthiers, 
Pouchet, Bert, Sabatier, Marion, and Giard, foreign workers speedily 
following their example. 

Milne-Edwards, belonging essentially to the scientific class, never 
extended his services and authority to the arena of politics. He was 
ready however to perform in a manly way the duties of a citizen in 
any emergency. When the gloomy days of the siege of Paris came, 
and the city was surrounded by the enemy, Milne-Edwards, already 
afflicted by the loss of one of his sons-in-law, who had been killed at 
Gravelotte, nevertheless brought to the national defense a patrotic 
band of learned men, whose unanimity of sentiment and action will 
redound in history to the honor of French science and the Academy. 

When the shells were crashing against the museum he remained at 
his post, going back and forth from the Jardin des Plantes night and day 
to provide as quickly as possible for every contingency. There came a 
day still more distressing, when he had to go to Fort Bicetre and look 
for young Desuoyers, the son of a devoted friend, who had been mor- 
tally wounded, and he himself held the reins and led the ambulance 
along a road whereon the enemy's shells were raining fast. 

Such are the incidents that have diversified the lives of the men of 
our day, not less troubled, perhaps, than were the savants of the six- 
teenth century from foreign and civil wars. 



716 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF HENRY MILNE-EDWARDS. 

Peace re- established, lie resumed liis course of instruction and the 
publication of his great work. AVben the work was finished a well- 
earned joy and reward awaited biin; bis scholars, friends and admirers, 
under the leadership of M. de Quatrefages, presented him with a medal 
of lionor. Milne-Edwards was then an octogenarian, crowned with 
honor and years; be bad made bis literary debut in lS:2o, nearly sixty 
years back, and, continuing bis labors for half a century, awaited the 
end of bis mortal life with the serenity of a wise man, offering us this 
beautiful example of a career that was active and useful to the last, 
thus showing that the constant exercise of the intellectual jiowers, in- 
stead of exhausting a man, sustains him beyond the common term of 
years, and preserves him from decay by continually bringing bis facul- 
ties into play in the strict fulfilment of daily duties. He also died, like 
the Roman emperor, repeating that noble word, Lahorfmxts. 

II. — HIS SCIENTIFIC AVORK. 

The time has come to examine the scientific work of Milne-Edwards. 
He was at the head of the French School of Natural History for many 
years. The greater number of the scientists constituting that body 
to-day were his pui)ils. It is necessary', then, to pass in review his spe- 
cial works and those that in conjunction with this organization had 
established his rei)utation, also to note his share in the scientific move 
ment of his times and the general theories he supiwrted, without sup- 
pressing the gaps in certain directions, due to his spirit of piccision in 
practical matters, and perhaps to a kind of theoretical timidity that 
characterized his conclusions. 

I will speak first of his special work. It was chiefly directed to the 
study of marine aninmls, crustaceans, annelids, mollusks, and zoophytes. 
This work, undertaken at the start in collaboration with Audouin, was 
afterward pursued alone by Milne-Edwards, giving the impulse to a 
vast series of zoological studies that have extended to our day with a 
fecundity inexhaustible as life itself. Up to that time it was the custom 
to study principally dead animals, dried or preserved in alcohol. The 
inconvenience of this mode was perhaps less with terrestrial animals, 
their shape being better defined and less affected by the great differ- 
ence of density of their habitat. ^larine organisms are otherwise 
affected ; their tissue and their organs, sustained during life by the water 
in which they are submerged and scarcely differing from it in density, 
are subject after death to great variations of fi)rm and dimension. Up 
to that time there had also been a preference for the morphological 
study of the liard parts or skeletons, such as the shells of mollusks, the 
carapaces of crustaceans, the solid supports of radiates. The interior 
organs, it is true, had been carefully examined after the method of 
Cuvier, but this had been done with subjects preserved in liquids, 
which distorted them, contracting and changing the greater part of 
their tissues, not to speak of the dissolvent action of the liquids upon

certain products. All these objects remaiued little understood, aiul the 
functions of their organs were still more obscure. Thus a new order 
revealed itself when naturalistvS — Milne-Edwards, one of the first — 
began to study marine organisms no longer in collections but in their 
own habitat in the bosom of the sea, even in the active conditions of 
their existence. This new class of study marked one of the character- 
istic features of the work of ]\Iilne-Edwards, and of those following him 
of the French school — 1 mean to say this intimate and consistent union 
of physiology with anatomy. Science has been re created, owing to the 
gradual ascendancy of the points of view revealed by this union over 
questions of simple classification that had hitherto been dominant under 
the influence of Liun?eus, de Jussieu, and Cuvier, 

In 1827 Milne-Edwards published conjointly with Audouin his ''Ana- 
tomical and Physiological Investigations of the Circulation of Crusta- 
ceans," investigations that made a sensation and in 1828 gained the 
Academy's prize for experimental physiology. Studies on the respira- 
tion of crustaceans and on the branchial modifications for the purpose 
of adapting crustaceans to life on the earth, investigations of the nerv- 
ous and muscular systems of crustaceans, their geographical distribu- 
ion being regulated, according to this author, by the double considera- 
tion of the existence of several distinct centers of creation and by the 
unequal fitness of species for swimming, combined with purely physical 
conditions of teinx)erature. The nearer we approach the equator the 
more varied and more highly organized species become. 

The investigations of the organization and classification of deca^joda 
crustaceans that Milne- Edwards had been making from the year 1831 
served as a prelude to a more extensive work — his Natural History of 
Crustaceans — of which I will presently speak. In 1851 he again took 
up the interesting morphology of these same decapodal crustaceans. 

The study of annelids naturally accompanies that of crustaceans; 
the greater part have the same habits and often even serve them for 
]>rey. From 1821) Milne- Edwards and Audouin were also engaged in 
describing the species that inhabit the coast of France and in reform- 
ing their classification. In 1837 Milne P^dwards was engaged in exam- 
ining the structure and functions of the circulatory system of anne- 
lids. In 1845 he returned to the study of myrianids and he described 
the mode of multiplication of these singular organisms, showing how 
their penultinate ring is developed and divided into several distinct 
rings, constituting a new animal which for a certain time remains 
united to its parent before separating from it to lead an independent 
existence. Often, even before this separation takes place, it becomes 
in its own turn the point of departure of a similar section and for the 
production of a third organism like itself and its progenitor, and so on; 
so that in this way as many as six young ones attached in a series may 
be seen at the posterior extremity of the parent individual or stock 
which serves as common ancestor. 



718 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF HENRY MILNE-EDWARDS. 

Between tlie years of 1826 and 1845 the history of mollusks, and 
especially that of ascidiaus, equally owe important contributions to 
Milne-Edwards. He particularly observed the circulation of these 
animals, which is more perfect and better developed than that of insects, 
and exhibits in some cases a remarkable i)ecu]iarity. Their blood 
does not only flow in vessels with partitions strictly limited by special 
membranes, but continues to flow on into a system of openings placed 
between the different organs in which the alimentary juices mingle 
directly with the mass of nutritive fluid. De Quatrefages pursued 
the same system of observations in works which it is not my present 
province to criticise with respect to their individual character and 
originality. A great discussion speedily took place between Tere- 
boullet and other learned men on the question of " phlebenterism," 
the name Quatrefages gave to his discovery, and the result was impor- 
tant modiflcations in the theories accepted up to that time as to the 
true character of the circulation and nutrition of the lower animals. 

Zoophytes could not escape the new method inaugurated by the 
investigation of marine organisms. After starting with experiments 
on polyps, sea nmts, and s^tonges, Milne Edwards resumed his studies 
more thoroughly in 1833, 1835, and 1837. He first examined jelly-fish, 
hitherto regarded as a sort of gelatinous, nearly amorphous mass; in 
reality, their structure is one of the most complicated, their translu- 
cense preventing, at first sight at least, the multiplied details of tlieir 
organization from being distinguished. 

In his investigations of alcyouaria on the coast of Algiers this learned 
naturalist made apparent the singular structure of those ])olypiers, 
which contain both tlie organs l)elongingto the young individuals that 
are placed at the terminal surface and the collective organs which 
exist only for the benefit of the community, but communicate with 
the digestive centers of the individuals in such a manner that all profit 
by the nourishment absorbed by each, thus establishing a common 
circulatory system between the individuals of one colony. So diverse 
are modes of life that it is diflicult to assign varied organizations to one 
systematic fonnula. By his studies of the anatomy of coral in 1838, 
and above all by his observations of the nature of coral reefs, Milne- 
Edwards paved the way for the admirable works which were the 
foundation of the reputation of our colleague, Lacaze-Duthiers. 

But I must pause in this long enumeration of the special labors of 
Milne-Edwards to take them up as a whole, to analyze them, and show 
their historical share and importance in the development of the nat- 
ural sciences; for this a longer time would be required than 1 have 
at my disposal to-day, and, I do not hesitate to say, a voice having more 
authority. However I can not pass by in silence two books which 
attracted the attention of their time by. reason of entirely distinct 
claims. I will speak first of the works relating to the production of bees- 
wax. A great dispute had arisen between agricultural chemists about 



BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF HENRY MILNE-EDWARDS. 719 

the origin of the fat of animals, a dispute connected with a question of 
more extended bearing — that of the origin itself of the direct principles 
of human beings. Some thought that vegetables alone make fatty 
matter; that introduced by food into the bodies of herbivorous animals, 
it tben passes into the tissues of those animals which are powerless of 
themselves to form it. Such was the opinion entertained in the dis- 
cussion by the greater part of intelligent minds, especially by Boussin- 
gault, justly considered an authority on these questions. Others, Liebig 
in i)articular, thought on the contrary that the fundamental chemical 
agencies which govern production of the direct principles have the 
same source in vegetables and animals, and they advanced in support 
of this theory several proofs carefully deduced from the production of 
fatty substances. But these proofs were indirect and were deemed 
insufficient by their opponents. A long controversy ensued; it was cut 
short, but not by the study of the agencies which engender fatty sub- 
stances — agencies still unknown. The definite result of the process 
however may be known by determining the relative weight of fatty 
substances contained in the organism and in the food of mammals and 
birds in various periods of their existence, i)articularly in the condi- 
tions of fattening domestic animals. 

Milne-Edwards, associated with Dumas, made an ingenious and deli- 
cate demonstration as a result of his study of insects. This related to 
the i)roduction of tlie honey which bees manufacture so abundantly. 
Determining by comj^arison the quantity of fatty matter that pre-exists 
in the bodies of bees — a quantity relatively minute — and by feeding a 
hive exclusively with the sugar necessary to the fabrication of their 
honeycombs, the authors established as a fact that wax is made at the 
expense of the saccharine element; that is to say, without the aid of a 
fatty substance furnished by alimentation. The test was exact; added 
to others made in various places, it carried conviction to all, even t(j its 
opponents. 

There is another book of Milne-Edwards that should be taken up as 
a proof of the superior tendency of his mi)ul; this work belongs to the 
early period of his career when he was dividing his energies between 
his medical vocation and his scientific studies. This was a publication 
made in 1829, in company with the philanthropic political economist, 
Villerme, and related to the influence of temperature upon the mortal- 
ity of newly-born infants. The authors showed how these infants are 
exposed to danger under the influence of variations of temi)erature, 
especially of cold, their organs being as yet unaccustomed to react 
against the surrounding medium. Kow the rules relating to obligatory 
l^^esentation of newly-born infants before the officer of the civil govern- 
ment, as well as to their baptism in church, exj^ose them to a chill dan- 
gerous in proportion to the low degree of the outside temperature. The 
authors proved this to be cause of mortality, by statistics compiled at 
different seasons and in distinct localities, and demanded a reform of 



720 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF HENRY MILNE EDWARDS. 

tbese inuideious laws and the substitution of an authorized ceititicate 
for the actual presence of the infant. Tlieir opinion was founded upon 
unanswerable i) roofs, but it is not easy to contend against the routine 
of established custom. This reform did not take place, still another 
generation was needed to receive it with tolerance; it i:: only in our day 
that the principle at stake has been definitely acknowledged. 

111. — HIS 'JHEORKTICAL VIEWS. 

Enough notice has been given to the books and special work of 
Milne Edwards. Surely the original and special studies of a learned 
man are the necessary basis of his work, and it is principally by means 
of such that he acquires authority. However, these do not constitute 
his entire work, and often not the essential i)art of it. This last rests 
rather upon the labors accomplished as a whole by the author, by unit- 
ing his individual work with the bearing of the general ideas and theo- 
ries he promoted. This confirmation is not wanting to Milne-Edwards. 
From tlie beginning of his career he wrote treatises on the diffusion of 
knowledge among the people, specially useful in lines of instruction 
that set forth the views and natural laws for which his name still 
stands. 

These views were principally developed in works of a more original 
character that still remain to science, such as the Natural History of 
Crustaceans, which comprises this order as a whole, uniting and co-ordi- 
nating the results of the first part of his scientific career; the Introduc- 
tion to General Zoology, and Lessons on the Physiology and Comparative 
Anatomy of Man and Animals, a vast encyclopedia of nature in four- 
teen volumes, setting forth the labors of his contemporaries and treating 
the general systems that have held a place in the science of the nine- 
teenth century. 

The Natural History of Crustaceans, was written in the first years of 
the reign of Louis Philippe, a short time after the death of Cuvier, and 
under the inspiration of the lively disputes that had first taken jilace 
between him and Geoftry Saint-IIilaire with regard to the unity and 
correlation of organic systems in animal species. Milne-Edwards con- 
tributed his quota of new facts and original views to these theories 
of natural philosophy. He held to the anatomical structure of the 
tegumentary skeleton of a great zoological type — the crustaceans — a 
skeleton having homologous j)arts that fulfil the most opposite func- 
tions, locomotion, prehension, mastication, sight, touch, respiration, 
generation, etc. According to him the body of the crustacean type is 
comi)osed of twenty-one zoonites or elementary animals, associated so 
as to constitute the animal as a whole; each of these zoonites, sup- 
ported by a special stem that is connected with the solid framework or 
dermo-skeleton and constitutes a central ring with parts hanging to 
it, thus forming a double series of members. If the zoonites always 
resembled each other we would have a uniform organism repeating 



BIOGRAPHICAL SKKTCH OF HENRY MILNlT-EDWARDS. 721 

itself iu every part like ;i iiiyriapod, but this eoutbririity may vary from 
different causes so as to constitute a multiplication of types. In cer- 
tain families it happens sometimes that one or more of the zoonites 
failing to perfect normally causes important modifications of form and 
structure ui the others of the same family, and consequently among 
neighboring zoonites. Sometimes the adjacent rings weld and mingle 
together, this blending remaining marked by the ijcrsistence of certain 
grooves or lines of less resistance; some among them lose at a certain 
period the organs that existed at an earlier stage of life. In this way 
the caudal fin of young crabs disai)pears in the adult. Crustaceans of 
the i^arasitic order present in this respect the strangest suppressions 
and malformations, retaining at the end of a certain period only the 
organs of nutrition that are necessary to their jtarticular kind of life; 
in compensation, also, sometimes becoming enormously developed. 
These abortions, arrests of development, and atrophied parts not only 
apjjear among the zoonites but also in their anatomical elements them- 
selves. In fact each zoonite in turn is formed of several distinct parts 
or sclerodermites, which also, by welding together, produce arrests of 
development and atrophied members. In opposition to this it is observed 
that the determinate part has an excessive development and a rela- 
tive preponderance, for, Increasing in size, it extends and trespasses 
upon neighboring parts. It multiplies itself, sometimes by a simple 
repetition, sometimes by a redoubling, so to speak, of its typical j)arts. 
But nature does not limit herself to a single process to attain her 
end. It may also happen that this preponderating element grows by 
a general development that is simultaneous and uniform throughout 
the different parts. Thus there is an indefinite variety of natural com- 
binations, all remaining subject to the limits of one same fundamental 
type and to a kind of economy in processes and modified elements. 
Crustaceans and marine animals of the lower orders in general offer a 
most suggestive spectacle of these phenomena to the philosophic 
mind. 

Nothing is more interesting than to survey, with Milne Edwards, this 
extensive, at the same time homogeneous, group of crustaceans. From 
them may be learned not only the form and the nature of organs but 
the way these organs act; in other words, the study of structure is 
always intimately connected with that of function and its offices. This 
method is an innovation upon Cuvier's, which was to distribute the 
animal kingdom strictly according to its organization — that is to say, 
its anatomy. 

Milne-Edwards to a wonderful degree extended the limits of the zo- 
ology of his time by introducing physiology as an essential part. This 
was an original characteristic and one of the consequences of the new 
method of study that he inaugurated in examining marine animals in 
their own jdace and in a living state. 

The examination of the lower animals otters immense resources in 
SM t)3 40

this respect that had not beeu uiidei'stood when naturalists devoted 
themselves chiefly to the study of vertebrates, the organic structure of 
which is usually distinct and si)ecialized as to functions. In the lower 
orders oflices become more and more simplitied, the common or.nan has 
uuiltiple functions, tht.' essential cliaracter of these functions tending 
to manifest itself more radically. 

While Milne-Edwards was pursuing his original investigations the 
character of his i)rofcssorship at the " Facnlte des Sciences '' led liim to 
embrace the whole animal kingdom in his range, and he kei)t in con- 
stant touch with the fresh discoveries of zoologists. He thought it 
expedient to build upon his i)rivate notes a more enduring work that 
would rej)resent his method of instruction in a more definite manner. 
To this feeling was due the conception of his great work, Lessons on 
the Physiology and CotiiparaUve Anatomy of Man and Animals which 
does the highest honor to his conscientious methods and to the scojie 
of his intellect. The publication of this book continued in fourteen 
volumes, over a term of twenty-four years, through critical periods in 
Milne- Edward's ])ersoiuil health as well as in French society. 

In this masterwork the author apj)roaches first the study of all 
organized systems destined to divers functioiis in the animal chain. 
He proceeds to follow a method of historical and progressive explana- 
tion that is full of interest and worthy to exemplify the march of the 
human mind in the search for truth. Studying every organized system, 
Milne-Edwards shows their innumerable transformations and the prog- 
ress or degradation of organization among general types according to 
the relative importance of the function to which the class is destined; 
in short, he shows its adaptation to the varied conditions of existence. 
In this connection he treats successively the great problems offered by 
the study of life, its origin, and its manifestations ; problems that per- 
haps no century has more incessantly and deeply agitated than our 
own, Milne-Edwards might be reproached for a want of boldness 
sometimes in the discussion of these great questions, his wise and T)ru- 
dent mind preferring to lend itself to the solution of lesser ones. It is 
certain that he did not refuse to recognize the evidence of facts and of 
their relation to origin revealed to us by geology; but he would not 
engage in the conjectural line of systems and theories by which the 
attempt has been made to explain the descent of animals. A\'hile 
recognizing tlu^ fact that living animals are derived from animals that 
lived in the geological periods, he was promi)t to add that we could not 
account for the production of organisms' capable of presenting a form 
specifically new and suited for transmission to their progeny. If he 
declares in fitting terms that he ''could not connect himself with those 
who reijresent the Deity as moulding brute matter with his hands in 
order to give form to a preconceived idea of one organized being or 
another, and breathing into this still inert machine the principle of 
life," to balance this statement he also adds that tlu' known properties 



J3I0GKAPHICAL SKETCH OF HENRY ?,11LNE-EI)WAKI)S. 723 

of iiiiitter, whether inert or active, seems to him iusiitticieut to give such 
a result, and that the intervention of a su[)erior power to him appears 
necessary. To sum up all, he remains loyal to the old conceptiou 
which regards life as -an organizing force of ponderable matter," and 
the organization of the living being not the cause of the vital power it 
posseses, but, ou the contrary, a consequence of the properties of that 
force. 

Milne-Edwards did not take up these new views of our time. To use 
a comparison often made since the days of the ancient poets, the evolu- 
lutiou of life was likened to a permanent tlame, according to the theory 
of a purely kinematic creation by a system of co-ordinated impulses, 
ceutralized in some one direction by merely mechanical conditions, 
and sustained by a consummation of energy independent even of that 
direction. To this conce[)tion, founded on facts borrowed exclusively 
from the physical and material world and tending to regard the individ- 
uality of every human being as an illusion and man himself the simple 
result of his organic construction, philosophers given to the study of the 
moral world oppose another and an apparently contradictory concep- 
tion, which, founded ou the existence of conscience, regards the psycho- 
logical individual as primordial and the exterior world as determined 
by his own thoughts, having no intelligible existence outside of his 
mind. Between these contradictory views and methods I can not 
decide here; this is not the place to insist upon the solution of prob- 
lems that must long, if not forever, remain veiled to the weakness of 
the human understanding. Let us however guard against declining 
to. investigate or refusing even to voice such questions, either from the 
side of mysticism, which would deny the fundamental object of all 
science, or from the side of the professed skepticism, which to-day 
threatens to overtake so many wearied minds. 

Whatever may be said and thought in regard to this subject, it was 
not these tremendous (piestions that our learned brother i)referred to 
spend his time in considering, it was not upon these tliat he left his 
mark. Such was not the design of a work that was based u^jon the 
research of other men. A book of reference, with whatever ability it 
may be compiled, requires acertain sentiment of sacrifice and self-abnega- 
tion on the part of its author; if he renders the greatest services to 
the present generation in tlie necessary course of years he seldom 
escapes finding Ids work incomplete and old fashioned. During the 
long series of years dedicated to its publication science undergoes 
various changes, that become still more accentuated as earlier impres- 
sions give way to others in the lapse of time. This is inevitable by 
reason of the ever-increasing nnmber of workers, the diversity of lan- 
guages and nations, each looking at science from the point of view most 
nearly conformed to its own geidus and traditions, liesides, this indi- 
viduality is more aggressive than it was formerly. A man after becom- 
ing learned and familiar with methods would often rather acknowledge 



724 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF HENRY MILNE-EDWARDS. 

his indebteduess to tliein than ^mjioU liiin.self under the banner of a 
master. By reason of these manifold circumstances a book of a general 
character, a compilation with whatever care it may have been prepared, 
will seldom live beyond the generation for which it was compiled; 
sooner or later it will be replaced by one of the same kind more in 
touch with the works of the day and itself destined to a transient fame. 

IV. — HIS ZOOLOGICAL PHILOSOPHY. 

It is better to dwell upon the individual and original ideas of Milne- 
Edwards tliat will remain associated with his name and to which he 
has given definite and lasting expression, if, indeed, any theory can 
lay claim to such a character in the incessant changes and revolutions 
of human knowledge. Milne-Edwards, in fact, had been led by his 
indefatigable labors and his ever improving methods of iiistruction to 
explain certain general theories respecting the agencies which control 
the innumerable metamorphoses of organs and their correlative func- 
tions. He took up these theories again in one of the most remark- 
able of his smaller books, published in 1858, under the title of "An 
Introduction to Ueneral Zoology, or Notes on the Tendencies of Nature 
in the Constituti-on of the Animal Kingdom." 

This title itself is characteristic of the man and of his times. In 
fact, nature is now rarely spoken of as if it were regarded in the light 
of an actual personality having a character, te;ideucies, and caprices 
after the fashioii of a moral being. Whether right or wrong, language 
implying that nature is a working machine has been substituted for 
these sentimental expressions, but at bottom these later ideas have no 
less significance. In reality, whatever the language used, the question 
in point is always to examine and ascertain the same essential rela- 
tions between organic systems and functions; facts flow out of these 
relations, or, as 1 might say, out of the investigation of living beings 
and the phenomena of which they are the seat. Only instead of seeking 
to discover in them a pre conceived design for some special and often 
puerile purpose, the scientist recognizes with admiration the harmony 
and general co-ordination in the permanent regularity of natural laws, 
the condition of the persistence of human beings, alike as individual 
types and as successive generations. 

One of the simplest and most interesting of tliese necessary rela- 
tions was discovered by Milne-Edwards, who traced its consequences 
with wonderful quickness of perception. This was the principle of the 
division of labor, which he first observed in his studies of crustaceans 
to operate both in the development of the types of animal species and 
in the perfecting of those types. 

To start from this point of departure, two laws, according to Milne- 
Edwards, are discoverable in animal organisms: a tendency to varia- 
tion, or the law of change, and the law of economy by virtue of which 
this variation takes jjlace in each type within given limits^ exhaust- 



BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF HENRY MILNE-EDWARDS. 725 

ing' all the {'ombinatioiis comprised in those limits. But the variatious 
themselves are not pro(luce<l by chance, — and just at this point this 
author begins to present original views,— they take place through a 
principle similar to that which governs the mechauical industrj'- and 
organization of human societies, the principle of the division of labor. 
This is in a manner l)orrowed by political economy. 

When human societies are in their primitive stage each man is 
obliged to provide for his separate needs, he must i)rocure his food, 
construct his dwelling, manufacture his clothing and all objects neces- 
sary to his life, health, and personal defense. Among civilized peoples, 
on the contrary, each member of the association devotes himself to the 
accomi)lishment of a fixed portion of this labor, but he performs this 
with a greater degree of economy and perfection; thus the social 
machine becomes co-ordinated and hierarchical while being perfected. 

To carry these ideas into the animal order every living creature is 
fitted to procure food and to repi'oduce its kind, these fundamental 
functions being common to vegetables and animals. The distinctive 
feature of the latter is that they are capable of feeling and of motion, 
these functions being fulfilled in a way that leads to the persistence of 
the individual and of the species; it may be said that every animal is 
absolutely perfect. The human mind however conceives of different 
degrees in this perfection. At the foot of the ladder we perceive 
animals like sponges and certain zoophytes constituting a mass of 
uniform appearance qualified for the same functions throughout all 
the parts, while performing apparently automatic movements. The 
same tissue seizes the food to be digested, contracts, dilates, breathes 
at the expense of the surrounding watery medium, appears to be 
affected by the sensations of light and heat, is multiplied and repro- 
duced in the case of spontaneous or accidental fracture. A hydroid 
polyp may be cut in i)ieces and each separate piece will be capable 
of carrying on without change an individual existence similar to that 
of the original body. By this it will be seen that the function 
existed before the organ ; far from being the i)roduct of the organ it 
serves to fit it for a special purpose. ! n fact, by the side of these simple 
animals, such as sponges or hydroid polyps, we meet with others in 
which each function begins to be set apart for special purposes. Diges- 
tion is performed in special cavities, generation is effected in a distinct 
manner; circulation, respiiation, power of motion, all the sensations 
acquire in succession their proper working api)aratns, to be in turn 
divided into different parts that are destined to the performance of one 
of the acts of which the whole constitutes the general function. 

Thus digestion first taking })lace in an interior cavity provided with 
a tissue similar to that which constitutes the general surface of the 
body, soon acquires a special cavity, a stomach at first adventitious 
and temporary, but becoming permanent in other species. In propor 
tiou as the scale of life ascends the animal is at the proper time pro- 



12C) BIOGRAPHICAL SKKTCH OF HENRY MILNE-EDWARDS. 

vided with orifices for receiving iiouri^lmient and lor tlirowing- oil' waste 
matter, also with fixed conditions of life and a definite form. Next, 
the digestive apparatus is divided into several regions, one designed 
for the introduction of food, another for its chemical o})erations, and 
still another for the absorption of nutritive juices. The form of each 
of these regions is again subdivided, prehensile organs are seen to 
appear employed for seizing prey, other organs employed in sharing 
and submitting it to a preliminary mechanical i)reparation. Special 
glands are observed that manufacture cheiaical agents designed to 
effect changes in the various kinds of food. In other cases the trans- 
portation of digested material instead of ])eing effected by contact and 
by means of diffusion among the tissues, gives place to a new appara- 
tus which carries them thoughout — this is the vascular system — and 
by virtue of a growing specialization it develoi)S a double current for 
distributing the fluids even to the most remote organs, Avhere they give 
up their nutritive elements, and are brought back to the center to again 
resume their first ofitice; from this process the vessels and the heart 
result, which again sei)aTat<' into different ]»arts. each ])erforming a 
distinct act. 

In this may be observed all the a])plications of the new principle and 
its infiuence upon the division of organic labor as distributed into 
multiplied functions, each one performed by a suitable apparatus 
resulting from the specialized development of one part or another, 
hencefortli to be set apart for one sole purpose, whilst it becomes 
insufficient if not absolutely useless for all other purposes. It mustl)e 
understood in addition to this that this i)aitial function remains neces- 
sarily co-ordinated witli other fuuctions in the general physiological 
action of which it ])erforms one part, that is to say, that the complete 
system while centralizing more and more always as a whole, becomes 
particularized into special oigans. 

The result of this provision is Avork better done and continually' per- 
fected, so that as a result of tlie princii)le of the division of labor we 
have the perfecting of particular organs for a special purpose, along 
with the elevation of tl)e general animal ty])e and of the part it i)Iays 
in the order of nature. 

Advancing still further, tlu' ])rinf'iple of the division of labor enables 
us to reach the heart itself of zoological pliilosophy. From the moment 
that the organ does not create the function, but is on the contrary 
modified and adapted by it, from the point of view of classification the 
form and even the existence of the organ do not assume the arbitrary 
significance it- was formerly deemed nci essary to attribute to them; it 
it is no longer permissible to si)eak o^' established and preponderating 
types. On the conti-ary the zoological siguiticance of one anatomical 
tyije varies continually in passing from one group of aiiimals to another. 
It varies even in sinnlar parts of the same animal, according to the 
diverse fuuctions the <n'gan is called upon to iierform. 



BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF HENRY MILNE -EDWARDS. 727 

We see fioin tliis liow the new piiuciitle, slightly vagne at the first 
glauee, acquires an ever-increasing clearness and importance by reason 
of its chain of deductions. The applications that may be made of this 
far-reaching principle are innumerable and infinitely varied,- it may be 
said it controls the entire catalogue of animal life. 

We must not forget that this progress is often relative. If mollusks 
have a general superiority over insects because of their digestive appa- 
ratus and circulation, they are on the contrary inferior in their organs 
of locomotion and the activity of their life in general. In a higher 
order, if man is superior in intelligence to the dog, he has less highly 
developed olfactory organs; his sense of sight is also equally inferior to 
that of most 1 )irds. 

Other examples still might be givcMi. In tact, we have likened the 
principle of the division of labor in animal organisms to that which 
takes place in the history of humanity. But if we compare societies 
of animals to human societies we will see that the functional division of 
social work is often carried to a greater extent among the former than 
among men. Among ants and bees the work of reproduction of the 
species is distinct from the work of maintaining the colony. Certain 
individuals, sometimes one only, are set aside for the generative office. 
There is only one female in a hive of bees, while the colony is fed and 
supporte<l by the activity of the working bees that have become sterile 
by the atroi)hy of the organs of generation. To a systematic mind this 
feature of animal societies would seem to be a mark of superiority, but 
I shall not insist upon this claim. I have only wished to show the 
relation the progress of the lower animals bears to our own, and the 
analogies that exist in certain respects. 

Whatever these analogies may be they add nothing to the impor- 
tance of tlie iniiiciple of the division of labor, and the interest of the 
general deductions flowing therefrom. It is greatly to the honor of 
Milne-Edwards that he has shown the full bearing of this principle, 
and followed up its a])plication with a keenness of perception, method of 
logic, and force of deduction that are incomparable. However exten- 
sive the work of a learned man may be, whatever personal authority 
he may derive from his times, his name rests with posterity only on 
what it stands for, whether tliis be the discovery or explanation of 
some renuirkable fact, or the demonstration of a general theory and 
its bearing upon a science as a whole. This latter claim Milne- 
Edwards had the good fortune, the talent, and the htsting glory to 
establish, and in consequence his name will remain among those of 
the leading naturalists of the nineteenth century.
