special meetin(j (iv the ijoakb i)v kegents. 

October 21, 1891. 

Pnrsnant to a call by tlic Scciotaiy, a special incctiiigoftlio Board of 
Kegcuts was held at the Jiistitutiou to-day at 1(>:.'>() a.m. Present: 
the Honorable Levi P. Mortem, Vice-President of th(> United States; 
tlie Honorable S. IM. Cnllom, the Honorable E. L. Gibson, the Honor- 
able li. Butterworth, Dr. A. I). White, Br. J. (\ Welling, Dr. Henry 
Coppee, Gen. M. O. Meigs, and the Secretary. 

The Vice-President took the chair and called the meeting to order, 
and on Dr. Welling's snggestion, there being in) objection, the rea<ling 
of the minntes of the last annnal nu^eting was dis])ensed with. 

The Secretary then stated that he had, sonn? months since, entered 
on a correspondence with Mr. Thomas G. Hodgkins, of Setanket, Long- 
Island, and that Mr. Hodgkins had intimated his desire to give a con- 
siderable snm to the fnnd of the Smithsonian Institntion "for the in- 
crease and dififnsiou of knowledge among men." Fnrther correspond- 
ence led to visits to Mr. Hodgkins by the Secretary and by tlie Assistant 
Secretary, and to prolonged conferences with him, the resnlt of which 
was that Mr. Hodgkins offered a donation of .|2(K),(>()(), concerning 
which the Secretary had telegi-ajthed the Eegcnts Jnne 22, and npon 
receiving the individual approval of most of the Uegents to the ac(;ept- 
ance of the snm named, Mr. Hodgkins had later, on September 22, at his 
home on Long Island, given this annnint in casli to the Secretary, who, 
in com])any Avith tin; Assistant Secretary, had bronglit it to Wasliington 
and deposited it in the Treasury of the United States, with the under- 
standing that an early meeting of the Regents would be called as a 
body to c()nsi<ler as to its accei>taiu'e. 

The exact terms in which Mr. Hodgkins made this gift wonld, the 
Secretary said, be stated later; but he gives .$200,000 to the Smithsonian 
Institntion to l)e added to the Smithson fund piopcr "for the increase 
and diffnsion of knowledge among men," with the condition that the 
income of -$100,000 of the gift shall be used, under this general purpose, 
for the especial one of the increase and dillusion of knowledge by in- 
vestigating and spreading knowledge concerning all the i»henoniena of 
atmospheric air. 

XI 



XII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 

This meeting' was, tlierefore, called in pnisnance of this understand- 
ing, and also with regard to some matters concerning tlie Zoological 
I'ark. 

Dr. Welling said tliat lie had been instrncted by his colleagues on 
the Executive Committee to bring the matter of this donation before 
the Regents in such a way that they can accept or reject the munificent 
gift made by Mr. Hodgkins. He then read the following preamble and 
resolutions : 

Whereas, Thomas G. Hodgkins, of Setauket, Loug Islautl, has placed iu the hands 
oftlie Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the sum of two hundred thousand 
dollars, for the purpose declared by him in a formal statement, as follows : 

September 22, 1891. 

I, Thomas G. Hodgkins, of Setauket, New York, desiring to increase the endow- 
ment of the Smithsonian Institution, founded iu the city of Washington, for the 
increase and diffusion of knowledge among men, have transferred to Samuel Pierpont 
Langley, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the sum of two hundred thousand 
dollars, the same to be delivered to the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution, to whom I give it in trust, to be invested permanently in the Treasury of the 
United States, as a part of tlie Smithson fund, and its interest to be applied to the 
increase and diffusou of knowledge among men ; this fund to be called the Hodgkins 
Fund, and all premiums, prizes, grants, or publications made at its cost, to be 
designated by this name; the interest of one hundred thousand dollars of this fund 
to be permanently devoted to the increase and diffusion of more exact knowledge in 
regard to the nature and properties of atmospheric air, in connection with the wel- 
fare of man in his daily life and in his relations to his Creator, the same to be 
effected by the offering of prizes, for which competition shall be open to the world, 
for essays in whiih important truths regarding the phenomena on which life, health, 
and human happiness depend shall be embodied, or by such other means as iu years 
to come may appear to the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution calculated to 
produce the most beneficent results. * * * 

(Signed) Thomas G. Hodgkins. 

Witness : 

(Signed) M. L. Chambers. 

Therefore, be it 

liesolved, That the Regents hereby accept the sum in question, subject to the con- 
ditions thus stated by the donor, and that the Secretary is instructed to carry into 
effect these conditions, and to administer the income as in the case of the income 
from other funds belonging to the Institution. 

Refiolvcd, That the Secretary is instructed to place the sum of $200,000 iu the U. S. 
Treasury, at six per centum interest, under the terms of section 5591, of Title lxxiii, 
of the Revised Statutes of the United States. 

liesolrcd, That the thanks of the Board of Regents are tendered to Mr. Hodgkins 
for his generous and public-spirited donation, and that an engrossed copy of the 
above preamble and resolutions be transmitted to him by the Secretary. 

In answer to a question as to whether this was an absolute gift to 
the Institution, the Secretary said that Mr. Hodgkins thoroughly under- 
stood tliat this gift was subordinate to the general title of the Smith- 
sonian fund, though it was to bear his own name as a sub-title. 

Senator Gullom addressed the meeting at length, quoting frequently 
from the Kevised Statutes, arguing iu favor of accepting the gift with

its conditions, and conidiKliiii;' his iciiiarks with a motion tliat the 
resohitions be adopted. 

The Chairnum liavin,u- put the (question, the lesohitions were unani- 
mously adopted. 

The Secretary then brouy,lit before the Kegent.s the ditticulties under 
which he was hiboriui>- from tlie insufficient appropriations for the Na- 
tional Zooloji'ical Park, and alter a full discussion of the special diffi- 
culties of the situation bc]ony:in<;' to a novel undertiiking-, where no one 
could say beforehand what appropriation would certainly be reiiuired 
under each item, but where limited approi)riations are nevertheless 
made in unchangeable si>ecittc items, unsupplemented by discretionary 
power, the following preamble and resolution were adopted: 

Whereas, the Natioual Zoolo<;ical Park has been plaeed iiuder the direction of 
this Board, under h'gishxtive conditions (juite other than those conteinplated at the 
time that the responsibility of its administration was accepted by it: 

Resolved, That the Secretary is authorized aiul instructed to represent to the 
proper committees of Cougrciss the difficulties wjiich these conditions impose upon 
the administration of the Institution, and to advise such legislation as may do away 
with the present system by which half of the expense of said i^ark is paid from the 
revenues of the District of Columbia; and also to advise such changes in the form 
of future appropriation bills as may be rerjnisite to do away with the especially 
imposed difiiculties which are now encountered in carrying on the work. 

Adjourned.

Dr. Coppee moved that a committee, to consist of one member of the

The Board of Regents of the Smitlisoniau Institution desires to place on record 
the expression of its sincere sorrow and its sense of the great loss it has suffered in 
the death of Gen. Montgomery Cunningham Meigs, a member of the Board and 
one of its Executive Committee. His valuable services to the Institution l)egan 
indeed before he was officially connected with it as a regent and continued until 
his death. 

While Gen. Meigs was prominently associated with many useful undertakings, his 
record as a soldier and as a citizen is marked bj' unswerving fidelity and extraor- 
dinary capability. The principal events of liis life can only bo briefly mentioned, 
as showing what varied experience he placed at the service of the Institution, 



JOUKXAL OF PKOCEEI)IN(;S. XV 

He was born on tho 'M of .M:iy, ISKJ, at Augusta, (ia., where his father, Charh's 
D. Meigs, afterwards the einineut physk-iaJi and autlior of IMiihuhslphia, was then 
practieiug medicine. After preliminary studies at the University of Pennsylvanin, 
he entered the Military Academy at West l*oint on the 1st of .Inly, \H'.i2, and was 
graduated with distinction in 1836. He was ;it once appointed to a position in the 
artillery service, and in the following year was transferred to the Corps of Engi- 
neers. In 1849 he was engaged in the P^ngineer Bureau at Washington, and from 
that time until the outbreak of the civil war his activity was principally directed 
to the construction of (iovernment works. Toward the close of 1852 he made a sur- 
vey at Washington to determine the best plan for supjilying the (uty with w;(ter. 
He was eventually i)laced in charge of the work, which included the designing and 
construction oi" the Potomac ac([ueduct. This remarkable work contains a single 
arch of 220 feet span, wliich still remains the largest stone arch hitherto constructed. 

He also had charge, as supervising engineer, of the north and south extensions 
of the National Capitol and of the construction of the iron dome, as well as of the 
northward extension of the General Post-Office building. 

When the war broke out he was appointed colonel of the Eleventh Infantry 
(May 14, 1861) and afterwards quartermaster-general of the LI. 8. Army, with the 
rank of brigadier-general. This post required unusual administrative ability, with 
a probity which conunanded general recognition, and it was becaus(s of his high 
integrity and the strength of his personal character, as well as his acknowledged 
capacity for business, that he was entrusted with the handling and use of hundreds 
of millions of dollars in the greatest war ever waged. 

This is not the jjlaee to recount liis military services. 'I'hey were numerous and 
admirably discharged. His duties took him to all parts of the country, conuectiid 
him with many fields of labor, and (sngaged him on the most varied commissions. 
Suffice it to say tliat he fully justiiied the conlidence imposed in him liy President 
Lincoln, performing with signal ability the duties entrnstt'd to him. In 1864 he 
received the well earned title of brevet major-general in the Army. 

ICvcn during tlie jjeriod of his service in the Army he was eng.iged in other occu- 
pations; rendering the Smithsonian Institution most im|>ortant service in 1S76 by 
devising the new building for the National Museum, a marvel of economic desigTi. 

While still full (tf vigor (ien. Meigs was retired from active service (tn the 6tli 
of February, 1882, by the inexoiable law whicli makes the grand eliniaeterie tlu' 
period avIicu military inaction begins. But he was by no means idle. He signalized 
his talent as an architect l)y the construction of the Pension-Ottice l)uilding at 
Washington between the years 1SS2 and 1SS7. 

He was elected a fellow of the National Academy of Sciences in l8fi.T, and a regent 
of the Smithsonian Instittition, as a "citizen of Washington," and directly upon his 
entrance into the board, December 2G, 1885, became an active member of its Exe(!U- 
tive Committee, llv was always ]»resent, extremely i)ainstakiug, and eminently 
judicious in his counsel and judgment on imi)ortant points of business and policy. 
He had just been nominated as regent for another term of six years when he was 
taken away from us by sudden illness (.January 2, 1892). 

He was eminent as a soldier, as a scientitie investigator, as a public-spirited citi- 
zen, and as a man. Industrious and exact in business, he knew no idle time. He 
was a busy man even when he 8i)ent a year in Euro])C for his health in 1X67 and 
1868, as well as on his visit th(!r(^ in 1875 on (rovernment service. 

Few regents havt; been of such importance to the Institution as (ien. Meigs, .and 
it is fitting that we shr)uld record our tribute (d' thankfulness for his <'minent serv- 
ices and our great sorrow at his loss. He Avas a man faithful in all things, who has 
left behind him an enduring reputation. 

Senator Gibson moved the adoption of the moiiioriiil iiiid iliat ;i coi).;'

XVIII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 

three items: For buildiugs, improvements, and maintenance. While 
all were insufficient, that for maintenance (which was essentially for 
the care and food of living animals) was peculiarly inade<iuate, since it 
left him unable to care for creatures who could not care for themselves, 
and ought not to be allowed to suffer. This item, then, was notably 
different in kind from those providing for buildings or roads, which 
might be left incomi)lete with less immediate damage or only i^ecuniary 
loss. 

Senator Morrill expressed his regret at the deplorable insufficiency 
of the appropriations for the park, and at the necessity of contemplating 
the sundering of the park from the Institution, but he was of the opin- 
ion that such a separation would become desirable unless some change 
was made. He thought it out of the question that the matter should 
continue on ihe present footing, and the Smithsonian ought not again 
to be put under the necessity of caring for any part of the park out of 
its private funds, even temporarily and indirectly. 

Further renuirks were made by Mr. Breckinridge and Mr. Wheeler. 

With reference to the administration of the Institution, the Secretary 
recalled that the Assistant Secretary has, as such, no power to act in 
the Secretary's place, such as the Assistant Secretary in any Exe(;u- 
tive Department possesses, and that he can not even execute such 
routine signatures of necessary vouchers and like papers as in Executive 
Departments the law authorizes, not only him, but his subordinates 
to do. 

Ajiart from the imi)ortant administrative duties assigned to the 
Secretary, ther(^ i)resent themselves daily a great many vouchers and 
like routine papers for the Treasury from the different bureaus under 
his charge — papers v.iiich, as has just been stated, would in every 
bureau of any Execati\'e Department of tlu^ Government be signed by 
a snbordinate oflicer; wliile here the Secretary- or Acting Secretary 
nuist i)ersoual]y sign such routine money papers, under a custom which 
has grown step by step from small beginnings to be a hardly tolerable 
burden in the illness or absence either of the Secretary or of the Act- 
ing Secretary, while for their joint illness no i)rovision is made what- 
ever. To meet in part the difficulties arising from the necessity of dele- 
gating authority for signing vouchers and like Treasury papers, it 
was stated that by i)roi)er action of the Board of Eegents all re({uire- 
meuts of the Treasury Department might be met. 

No similar difficulty exists in any Executive Department, because 
in all such the lav,' provides not only tor the Secretary and Acting- 
Secretary, but for a line of succession of subordinate officers author- 
ized to execute such acts as the daily conduct of their respective 
bureaus rendt'rs necessary. 

The Secretary pointed out that, owing to the established princii)lesof 
conduct in the Sniithsoniaii Institution (which there was no intention 
here of departing from), the Secretary's power had never been diffused 



JOURNAL OF rUOCEEDING^. XIX 

and (Icleiiated as was tlic cast' in the Executive Dei>artiiu'nts of the (lov- 
('riiiiieiit, where thei'e were several persons in every separate bureau 
who had a right, in case of the absence not only of the Secretary and 
Acthig- Secretary, bnt of the head of the bureaii itself, to carry on its 
affairs, and especially to sign such money pa])ers as were required for 
its current business with the Treasury. Tliere was no time, howev<'r, 
in tlie i>ast twelve years, when, in the joint excnl of the illness of tlie 
Secretary and the Acting Seeretaiy, there was any sucli ]>rovisi(Hi for 
carrying on the cui'rent business of the Institutntn. The Secretar\' 
further pointed out that since the provision for an Acting Secretary 
wi'.s lirst made in lS7t>, he had made a comjuitation of the anrount of 
business coming before the Secretary then and now, which shows that 
the work is at i)resent from eight to ten times that when the tirst legis- 
lation for an Acting Secretary was asked for. 

Dr. Coppee said that owing to his long connection with the Institu- 
tion — perhaps the longest of any member present, witli the possible 
exception of Senator Morrill — he felt particularly in a position to cor- 
roborate the statements made by the Secretary as to the growth of the 
business of the Instituticm since the passage of the act relating to the 
appointment of an Acting Secretary, and he thought the best manner 
of effecting this immediate relief to the Secretary was covered by the 
following resolution : 

Resolved, That tlic Secretary be empowered to appoint some suitable person who, 
in cast? of need, may sij^n such retjuisitions, vouchers, abstracts of vouchers, accounts 
current, and indoisements of checks and drafts as arc nee(h'd in the current l)usi- 
nessofthe Institution or of any of its bureaus, and are custonuirily bigHcd in the 
l)urc:tus of other (h'partmcnts of the (iovernment. 

lie added that as this came before the I>oard at a late hour he would 
move, in order to give time for its consideration, that the whole matter 
be ])ut in thi' hands of a committee appointed b.\' the Chancellor with 
power to act. 

The Chancellor stated that undoubtedly the increased growth of the 
Institution had introduced new demands, and that it was desirable 
that the action in reference to them should be carefully studied. 

After further remarks by Mr. IJreckinridge and Mr. Henderson and 
other members of the Board, Dr. Cop]>ee said that he thought the 
action of the Executive Committee could cover the ground of the reso- 
lution, and, on motion of the Vice-President, the whole subject was 
referred to the Executive Committee with power to act on the resolu- 
tion. 

The Secretary said, in connei-tion with what had just been done, 
that the increased burdens of extraneous duties imposed by Congress 
were accom])anied by special exjx'iises for administtuing appropria- 
tions for which no legislative pro\ ision was made, and which necessa- 
rily fell on the limited Smithsonian fund. i>artly in indirect ways.

secretary, or steuograj)hers, or clerks, or messengers to a,ttend to the 
administrative duties common to all tlie bureaus under the Eegeuts' 
care. 

Dr. Coppee offered the following resolution, at the same time calling 
the attention of the Board that it referred to public funds only: 

Resolved, That the Secretary be iustructed to ask for au appropriation by Congress 
to meet the miscelhiueous expenses incident to the administration of the public 
funds with which the Regents are intrusted. 

On motion the resolution was adopted.

special meeting of the hoard of regents. 

March 29, 1892. 

A special meeting of the Board of Regents was liekl to-day at a 
quarter before 10 o'clock A. m. Present: The Chancellor — Mr. Chief- 
Justice Fuller, in the Chair; the Hon. Levi P. Morton, Vice- 
President; the Hon. S. M. Culloiu; the Hon. E. L. Gibson; the Hon. 
Joseph AVheeler; the Hon. H. C. Lodge; the Hon. W. C. P. Breckin- 
ridge; Dr. J. C. Welling, and the Secretary. 

The reading of the minutes of the last meeting was dispensed with, 
and the Secretary read a telegram from Dr. Copi)ee, expressing his 
regret at his inability to be jiresent. 

The Secretary stated that the meeting had been called at the reipiest 
of three of the Eegents chietly on account of the action of the Appro- 
priations Committee of the House of Representatives — a matter in 
which the good name of the Institution was in some measure involved, 
— whereby the ai)propriations for vaiious Gov'ernment interests undei- 
the charge of the Regents had been reduced to such an extent that the 
prosperity of all these departments Avould receive a blow from which 
they could not hope to recover for years to come. 

Especial stress was laid upon the inadequacy of the appropriations 
for the I^ational Zoological Paik and attention was also called to the 
fact that the park is already visited on fair days by thousands not 
oidy of adults but of children, while dangerous animals are there with- 
out sufrtcient buildings or cages or inclosures, and without means to 
])i(»vide thenL and that the only protection of the public and esjjecially 
of children n)ust be from incessant guardianship, which the present 
small and overworked force is unable to ])ro])erly render. 

The S«'cretary stated that he was unable to carry on tlie jyark with 
less expenditure for maintenance than i2(),()00, or with a less total 
a])])i'oi)riation than 850,000, in case it were made in one item. 

Tlie following resolutions were introduced by Mr. Wheeler: 

livnolnd, Tliat tlio Board of Ki-gcuts of tin- Siiiitlisoiiiaii Institution would ro- 
s]»t'ctfiilly represent 1o Congress tin; iiu])()ssil)ility of niaintaininj; tlu'adiuiuistratiou

April ;M), 1890, with a less a])])ropriation for maintenance than $2(;,()()(), or with a less 
total appropriation than $50,000. 

Jhaolrt'd, That the Soeretary of the Institution l)e recinested to couiniunicate this 
resolution to the President of the .Senate and Speaker of the House of Ke])re8enta- 
tives, with a preliminary statement oi' the reasons and considerations on which it is 
based. 

Aftei- sonu' Inrtlier discussion, the resolntions weie adoi)ted, with 
the understanding that such limited moditication of the wording might 
be made as to meet any technicality suggested by the Treasury De- 
partnuMit. 

There was a general exinessionof opinion among the Regents that the 



XXII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 

coiulition of tlie affairs of the x)ark should be brought to the attention 
of (Jongress by exphmation on the floor of the House and iSenate from 
Regents and friends of the Institution. 

Further remarks on the matter were made by Mr. Lodge and Dr. 
Welling. 

The Secretary then read a communication from Mr. Thomas G. 
Hodgkins, dated March 10, 1892, in which Mr. Hodgkins stated that 
he desired to relinquish the option of ('(mtributiiig the further sum of 
$100,000 to the Smithsonian fund. 

There beiug no further business befor*^. the Board, the meeting- ad-

States Senate, l)y the Vice-President of the United States, December 
15, 1891, the Hon. Joseph Wheeler, and the Hon. Henry Cabot Lodge, 
of the House of Representatives, by the Speaker {2)ro tempore) of the 
House, January 15, 1892, and Dr. H-enry Coppee, by joint resolution 
of Congress approved January 20, 1892. 

The Board has suffered the loss by death of Gen. Montgomery C. 
Meigs on Januiiry 2, 1892. Dr. ISToah Porter, an ex-member of the 
Board, died on March 4, 1892. lleference is made to them elsewhere in 
the necrologic notices. 

ADMINISTRATION. 

I beg to repeat the recommendation contained in my report of last 
year, that Congress be requested to make some provision for meeting 
the actual expenses of the administration of the affairs of the General 
Government confided to the Institution. There is no such provision 
now for the considerable and increasing clerical expenses, which belong 
not to any single Government bureau under its care, but to the charge 
of their common administration, and these expenses all fall ultimately 
upon the Institution. 

Another difficulty arising out of the great extension of the interests 
under the care of the Regents, which makes the duties of the Secretary 
and the Assistant Se(iretary altogether different from what they were 
in its early history, has been calling for relief for some time, and has 
finally been met by appropriate action of the Board; for, apart from the 
need of a Congressional appropriation which shall i^rovide for the 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3 

increased expenses of tlie clerical force in the Secretary's office engaged 
in transacting- purely (lox-ernnient business, I luive directed the atten- 
tion of the Regents to the fact that the Chancellor of the Institution 
(in whom alone the power of appointing an Acting Secretary is v^'sted 
by law) may be absent when the Acting Secretary is ill and when 
there is no one to relieve him. Such a case has actually ]U'esented 
itself, directing attention to the necessity of authorizing the Secretary 
to delegate authority for performing certain subordinate but indis- 
pensable functions, such as signing a certain class of papers. 

Owing to the established principles of concbict in the Smithsonian 
Institution (which there has been no intention of de])arting from) the 
Secretary's power has never been diffused or delegated even as far as 
is usual in the case of Executive Departments of the Government, 
where there are several persons in every separate bureau constituting a 
line of succession of those who are authorized, in case of the absence 
of its head, to carry on ordinary business and es[»ecially to sign all 
such routine papers as are required for its current business with the 
Treasury. There lias been no time however in the ])ast twelve years, 
when, in the joint event of the illness or absence of the Secretary and 
the Acting Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, any such provision 
has existed for carrying* on even the routine business. 

At the meeting of the Regents on January 27, 181)2, the following- 
resolution was introduced, and was duly given effect through the 
Executive Committee in the appointment of an ofticer of the Insti- 
tution to act according- to its provisions: 

'■'■Resolved, That the Secretary be empowered to a|)point some 
suitable person, who, in <'ase of need, may sign such re([uisitions. 
vouchers, abstracts of vouchers, accounts current, and indorsements of 
cliecks and drafts. ;t i are ueedtMl in the current business of tiie Institu- 
tion, or of any of its bureaus, and are customarily signed in the bureaus 
of other Departments of the Covernment." 

FINANCES. 

1 have recalled the fact that the gift of 1200,000 to the Institution by 
]\Ir.. Thomas Cr. Ilodgkins, of Setauket, Long Island, to which \ briefly 
refi'rred in my report of last year, was formally accepted by tin; Board 
of Regents at a special meeting held October 21, 181)1. 

At this meeting I stated that I had entered on a corresi)ondence 
with Mr. Hodgkins in which he had intimated his desire to give a 
considerable sum to the fund of the Smithsonian Instituti(m for the 
"increase and diffusion of knowledge among men," The c<u-respond- 
ence was followed by personal visits both by the Secretary and by the 
Assistant Secretary, the result of which was that Mr. Ilodgkins olfcred 
a donation of §200,000, concerning which the Secretary telegraphed 
the Regents on June 22. [Jpon being- advised of the individual 
approval of most of tlu^. Regents to the accei)tan(;e of the sum named, 
Mr. Ilodgkins later, on September 22, at his home on Long Island,

gave the amoiiut in cash to the Secretary, Avho deposited it in the 
United States Treasury at Washington, witli the understanding that 
an early meeting of the Board woukl be called as a body to consider 
its acceptance. 

The essential conditions are that the income of !|10(),000 of this gift 
shall be permanently devoted to the increase and diffusion of more 
exact knowledge in regard to the nature and properties of atmos- 
pheric air in connection with the welfare of man; the income of the 
remaining >^1(U>,0()() being for the general purposes of the Institution, 

In view of the importance of the subject I Inive referred to it again 
later in the report, under a- distinct heading. 

I may call attention in this i)lace to the fact that the Smithsonian 
Institution is, by rea^oii of its far-reac-hing connection with the scien- 
tific world, enabled to make specially effective use of sums given for 
immediat(^ employment i)i specific pur})oses or investigations. A few 
such special trusts (distinct from those for adding to the permanent en- 
dowment) have been committed to the Institution in the past, through 
the Secretary, and yet I feel assured that, were the intentions of the 
Regents better understood in this regard, the Institution would much 
more frequently be made the medium for giving eft'ect to the plans of 
those interested in promoting specific researches, as well as in making 
permanent endowments. 

The i)ermanent funds of the Institution areas follows: 

Bequest of Smithsou. 1846 $515, 169. 00 

Residuary legacy of Smithsou, 1867 26, 210. 63 

Deposit from savings of income, etc. , 1867 108, 620. 37 

Beciuest of James llamiltou, 1875 1, 000. 00 

Bequest of Simou Habel, 1880 500. 00 

Deposit from proceeds of sale of Ijonds, 1881 51, 500. 00 

Hodgkins' gift, 1891 200, 000. 00 

Total permaueut Smitlisouiau fund iu the Treasury of the United 

States, bearing interest at 6 per cent, per annum $903, 000. 00 

At the beginning of the fiscal year the balance o]i hand was $40,062.11. 
Interest on the invested fund, amounting to '$I:4:,I81.3G, has been 
received from the Treasury of the United States during the year, and 
from sales of puldications and miscellaneous sources, including repay- 
ments on account of international exchanges, $2,974.23, making a total 
of $87,517.70. 

The total expenditures, as shown in detail in the rei)ort of the Execu- 
tive Committee, have been $39,ti42.o7, leaving an unexpended balance 
on June 30, 1892, of $47,875.33. This includes a sum of $10,000, the 
amount of a bequest of $5,000 from the late Dr. J. H. Kidder and a 
donation of a like amount from Dr. Alexander Graham Bell personally 
to the Secretary for physical investigations, which was, with the donors 
consent, deposited by the Secretary to the credit of the funds of the 
Institution, subject to order. Neither of these sums, then, forms a j)or-

Astro-Physical Observatory. The bahuice avaihible for the general 
inirposes of the Institution on July I, 1<S9l\ was •S'>7,S7.3..'v), but tlus is 
in large part held against various liabilities, fen- scientific pur[>oses. 

The Instituticni has been charged by Congress witli the disburse- 
ment during the year of the following appropriations: 

Forlut.M'u.itioiiiil Exchuu.ues $17,000 

For Etlinolopjioal Rosi-archcs 50,000

To these should be added the small unexpended balance of the special 
api)ropriatioii of .i5i>2,000 made April 30, 1890, for the i^ational Zoolog- 
ical Parlj. 

The vouchers for the disbursement of these ai)propriations have been 
examined by the Executive Committee, and the various items of expen- 
diture are set forth in a letter addressed to the .Speaker of the House 
of Ile])resentatives, in accorda!H*-e with a provision of the Sundry Civil 
Act of October 2, 1888; while the expenditures from the Smithsonian 
fund have likewise been examined and ai)proved by the Executive 
Committee, and are shown in their report. 

J may call attention to the fact that the Secretary has been <lesirous 
to see a change in the phraseology of the Sundry Civil Act making ap- 
propriation for ethnological researches, which would relieve him from 
the ])ersojial responsil)ility imposed by the language of former bills. 
Such a change has now been made, whereby the appropriation is placed 
"under the direction of the SmitJisonian Institution," instead <>f in the 
charge of the '^ Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution," as heretofore, 
Th(^ vouchers from the Bureaii of l^thnology are therefore now scruti- 
nized by the Executive Committee, as are all other expenditures of the 
Institution. 

The estimates for the fiscal year (mding .June .'iO, 180;5, forwarded to 
the Secretary of the Treasury, under date of Octol)er 7, 1801, were as

BUILDINGS. 

I have repeatedly urged upon your atteution the necessity for more 
ample accommodatious for the rapidly increasing collections of the 
National Museum, a necessity that has been emphasized by the difli- 
culties attending the preparation for the Museum exhibit at the 
World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago and the Columbian Histori- 
cal Exposition in Madrid. 

In the light of past experience, it is not unreasonable to anticipate a 
large increase in the collecticms of the Museum in the shape of donations 
from exhibitors at tliese expositions, if any assurance can be given 
that such material will eventually be properly installed. If no such 
assurance can be given a great amount of material will be lost to the 
Institution, the value of which would, in my opinion, nearly equal the 
estimated cost of a new building for the Museum. 

The present Museum building was finished and occupied in 1881. 
The collections increased so rapidly that as early as 1883 the Regents, 
at their meeting of January 17, recommended to Congress the erection 
of a new building. 

Since 1883 the collections have again increased to such an extent 
that a new building as large as tlie present one could now be advan- 
tageously tilled with material held in storage, and I can only repeat 
with increased emphasis the closing sentence of my letter of January 
21, 1890, to the Hon. Leland Stanford, chairman of the Senate Com- 
mittee on Public Buildings and Grounds, " That unless more space is 
provided, the development of the Government collection, which is al- 
ready partly arrested, will be almost completely stopped." 

The Museum collections have overflowed into every part of the 
Smithsonian building, and special provisions have been made for them, 
beginning with the galleries long since erected in the main hall, not 
contemplated in the original plans of the building, and which seriously 
interfere with lighting the exhibition open to the public. The storage 
space of the Institution building needed for other purposes, is now also 
almost exclusively occupied by jVIuseum specimens, and some relief 
must be fouud. 



REPOET OF TTTE SECRETARY. 7 

A bill providiiiii' for the orcctiou of a lire-prool' l)uikliii,ii' for the 
^STatioiialMusemn was introduced in the Senate by the lion. J. S. Mor- 
rill, and passed the Senates on A])i'il 1."), 18!»li, but failed to seeure 
favorable action in the House. 

The work of flre-proo ting- the so-called "chapel'' of the west wing- 
of the Smithsonian building; has been practically completed, and I 
would especially urge that the balance of this ap])ro))riation, unex- 
I)ended, by reason of a limiting clause introduced in the act, on account 
of which the money is not available for certain repairs originally con- 
templated, should be now made available by Congress for increasing 
the storage room in the east wing' of the building', and at the same 
time that certain rooms be fitted for the special needs of the Govern- 
ment Exchange Bureau, now occu])ying' rooms in the Main l>uilding, 
urgently needed for other purposes. 

The new buildings erected or in x>i'Ogress of erection for the collec- 
tion of living animals, being all in the Zoological Park, are mentioned 
in the report upon the park. 

RESEARCH. 

In pursuance of the long established policy of the Institution, finan- 
cial aid has, during the past year, been extended to original investi- 
gators in the domain of science, and considering the modest sum that 
it has been found possible to devote to this purpose, the results are 
gratifying. 

The subscripticm for twenty copies of the Astronomical Journal, 
which are distributed abroad as exchanges of the Institution, has been 
continued. 

To the Lick Observatory, through its director. Prof. Holden, an addi- 
tional grant has been made for the continuance of experiments in lunar 
photograpiiy. 

Prof. E. W. Morley is still engaged in his determinations of the 
density of oxygen and hydrogen, for which some special a])paratus has 
been jn'ovided by the Institution. 

Mention has been made in previous reports of the aid exteiuled to 
Prof. A. A. Michelson, of Clark University, in his experiments with the 
refractometer, and in tlu^. determination of a uiuversal standard of 
length founded on the wave length oi light. In furtherance of the 
latter project, the Institution will, during the coming summer, send one 
of its scientific staff to assist Prof. Michelson in his investigations 
under the auspices of the International Bureau of Weights and Meas- 
ures in the laboratory of the Bureau at Sevres, I 'ranee. 

T>oth these latter investigaticms refer to fundamental constants of 
nature, and their results promise to be of wide and lasting imi)ortance. 

Allusion was nmde in my last report to aid extended to Dr. Wolcott 
Gibbs in his investigations of the physiological action of chemical com-

pounds. These investigations are now completed, and liave resulted 
in a substantial contribution to this branch of science. 

Astro-phy steal Observatory. — The Smithsonian Astro-physical Ob- 
servatory still occupies the temporary wooden shelter upon the grounds 
just south of the Smithsonian building, and the money given to the In- 
stitution for the erection of a more permanent building is still held 
while awaiting the action of Congress in providing a site. The ob- 
servatory has received much of my i^ersonal attention during the year. 

In statements to Congress and elsewhere some brief official expla- 
nation has been given of the object of this observatory, which, as it 
has not been explicitly given in previous reports, I repeat here in the 
most succinct manner before entering on any description of the special 
work. 

The general object of astronomy, the oldest of the sciences, was, un- 
til a very late period, to study the places and motions of the heavenly 
bodies, with little special reference to the Avants of man in his daily 
life, other than in the application of the study to the purposes of navi- 
gation. 

Within the past generation, and almost coincidentally with the dis- 
covery of the spectroscope, a new branch of astronomy has arisen, 
which is sometimes called astro-physies, and whose purpose is distinctly 
different from that of finding the places of the stars, or the moon, or the 
sun; which is the i)rincipal end in view at such an observatory as that, 
for instance, at Greenwich. 

The distinct object of astro-physics is, in the case of the sun, for ex- 
ample, not to mark its exact place in the sky, but to lind out how it 
affects the earth and the wants of man on it; how its heat is distributed, 
and how it in fact affects not only the seasons and the farmer's crops, 
but the whole system of living things on the earth, for it has lately 
been proven that in a physical sense, it, and almost it alone, literally first 
creates and then modifies them in almost every possible way. 

We have however arrived at a knowledge that it does so, without 
yet knowing in most cases how it does so, and we are sure of the great 
importance of this last acquisition, while still largely in ignorance how 
to obtain it. We are, for example, sure that the latter knowledge 
would form among other things a scientific basis for meteorology and 
enable us to predict the years of good or bad harvests, so far as these 
depend on natural causes, independent of man, and yet we are still 
very far from being able to make such a prediction, and we cannot 
do so till we have learned more by such studies as those in question. 

Knowledge of the nature of the certain, but still imperfectly un- 
derstood dependence of teriestrial events on solar causes^ is, then, of 
the greatest practical consequence, and it is with these large aims of 
ultimate utility in view, as well as for the abstract interest of scien- 
tific investigation, that the Government is asked to recognize such 
researches as of national importance ; for it is to such a knowledge of 



REPOKT OF THE SECRETAIJY. 9 

causes with such i)nK'ti('aI (•(»iise<iiieiit'es tliat this chiss oT iiivestiii'a- 
tioii aims and tends. 

Astro-physics by no means coiitines its investijiation to tiie sun, 
though tliat is the most im}>oitant subject of its study and one whicli 
has been undertaken by nearly every leading government of the civil- 
ized world but the Indted States. France has a great astro-physical 
observatory at Meudon, and Germany one on an equal scale at l*ots- 
(him, while England, Italy, and other countries have also, at the na- 
tional expense, maintained for many years institutions for the prosecu- 
tion of astro-physical science. 

It has been observed that this recent science itself was almost coeval 
witli the discovery of the spectroscope, and that instrument has every- 
where been hirgely emi)loyed in most of its work. Of the heat which 
the sun sends, however, and which, in its terrestrial manifestations, is 
the principal ol)]ect of our study, it has long been well known that the 
s[)ectroscope could recognize only about one-quarter — three-quarters 
of all this solar heat being in a form which the ordinary spectroscope 
(;an not see nor analyze, lying as it does in the almost unknown "infra- 
red" end of the spectrum, where neither the eye nor the photograph 
can examine it. It has been known for many years that it Avas there, and 
we have had a rough idea of its amount, with an almost total incapacity 
to exhibit it in .detail. Our imi^erfect knowledge of this region is at 
l)resent represented by a few inadequate types of parts of it given in 
drawings made by hand, where the attempts to depict it at all are even 
to-day more crude than the very earliest charts of the visible spectrum, 
made in the infancy of spectroscopic science. 

One of the first i^ieces of work which this observatcn-y has under- 
taken is to explore and describe what may be properly called " this great 
unknown region," l»y a method which the writer has recently been able 
to bring to such a degree of success as to give good grounds for 
its (continued prosecution and for the hope that a complete map of this 
whole region will shortly be i)roduced by an automatic and therefore 
trustworthy i)rocess, showing the lines corresponding to the so-called 
Fraunhofcr lines in the uiiper spectrum. 

The firstsyear's work of any such observatory must ordinarily con- 
sist largely in ]»ei'fecting its apparatus and determining its constants, 
but a ]»ortion of this necessary labor has been deferred in favor of this 
principal task, of which it is hoped that another year will see the es- 
sential completion. In this, the present principal scientific work here, 
all resources of the observatory are, then, for the time being engaged. 

I have acknowledged in a previous report the valuable assistance of 
Prof. 0. C. ITutcliins, of I)Owdoin College, avIio efficiently aided in in- 
stalling the api)aratus. Prof, IIut(;hins was obliged to leave in Aug- 
ust. On the 16th of November Dr. William Hallock was appointed 
senior assistant. 

At different times during the year, there have been employed as

assistants Mr. C. A. Saunders, Mr. C. T. Child, and Mr. F. L. O. Wads- 
worth. A photographer and a laborer complete the present force of 
the Observatory. 

lu tlie latter part of the year, Dr. Hallock, to my regret, advised me of 
his proximate call to another duty, and the work was later left tempo- 
rarily in the charge of Mr. Wadsworth, who had joined the staff in June, 
but who was sent to Europe in July, for the purpose, elsewhere referred 
to, of contributing to the work of establishing a wave-length standard 
under Professor Michelson. The labor has been carried on under the 
disadvantages of these interruptions, and also under others of another 
kind, due to the fact that the extremely delicate apparatus, which is 
used in a perpetually darkened room, is, by reason of the location of the 
temporary observatory shed, in proximity to trafBc-laden sti'eets, where 
there is danger that the passing vehicles affect the accuracy of the ob- 
servations both by earth tremors and by magnetic disturbances. Not- 
withstanding these latter drawbacks, much better results have been 
obtained than it was supposed could be reached in such a situation, 
and these, as I have said, I trust, another year will enable the Institu- 
tion to make jiublic. 

EXPLORATIONS. 

Several explorations have been carried on during the year by the 
TJ. S. Fish Commission, resulting in the transfer to the Museum of many 
large and varied collections of zoological, botanical, and geological 
material. Dr. W. L. Abbott has continued liis work in Asia and has 
contributed collections made in Kashmir. Dr. Edgar A. Mearns,of the 
Internati<inal Boundary Commission, has sent several large collections 
of natural-history specimens obtained near the border line between the 
United States and Mexico. Mr. P. L. Jouy has made important col- 
lections in Arizona and New Mexico. Collections of the fishes of Nica- 
ragua have been received from Mr. C. W. Richmond. 

Mr. W. W. Eockhill, the distinguished traveler, whose previous ex- 
plorations have been mentioned in my reports and who has already 
deposited in the Museum very valuable collections which he made illus- 
trating the religious practices, occupations, and amusements of various 
peoples in different i^arts of China, Thibet, and Turkestan, has started 
upon a second journey to hitherto almost unknown parts of Thibet, 
with such aid (much more limited than I could wish) as it was possible 
for me to afford him. From his known qualities as an explorer it may 
be confidently expected that his journey will result in imx)ortant con- 
tributions to our knowledge of this country. 

PUBLICATIONS. 

The number of ])ublications during the year has been about the same 
as in preceding years. 

As has been frequently stated, the publications of the Institution 
proper are of three classes : First, the series of " Smithsonian Contribu- 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 11 

tioiKs ti) Knowledge," in i^uarto foiiii, (•<>iii])iisin,n' original memoirs of 
researelies believed to i^reseut new truths, and whic.li, as required, 
are liberally illustrated with tijiures or plates; secondly, the series of 
"Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections," in octaA"(> size, contaiuiiig' 
special reports, systematic lists of synopses of species, etc., whether 
from the organic or the inorganic world, instructions to naturalists for 
collecting and preserving specimens, special bibliographies, tabulated 
results, and other aids to scientific investigation not generally requir- 
ing illustrations; and lastly, the series of " Smithsonian Annual Ke- 
ports," presenting to Congress, through the Secretary, the condition of 
the Institution, accompanied, under the early plan of Professor Henry, 
by scientific articles from competent writers, either original or selected, 
but as a rule in un technical terms, representing the advances made in va- 
rious departments of research and frequently admitting of illustration by 
plates or figures. Th^se articles are intended to be of interest not alone 
to the correspondents and collaborators of the Tnstitution, but to that 
large number of the educated ])ublic who follow such statements with 
profit when they are presented in popularly intelligible form. 

SmitlisoHUdi Co)it}'ihi(tio)is to Knoirkulf/c. — The only publication of the 
year in this series is a memoir detailing the results of original experi- 
ments in aerodynamics by the Secretary,* and occu])ying 11;j quarto 
pages, illustrated with 11 figures and 10 i)lates. 

S)nitJi>ioniaH Miscellaneous (JoUeelions. — The number of titles in this 
series during the year is 47, of which none seem to call for any partic- 
ular comment. 

Smiilisonian Annual lieporf. — I have referred in my report for 1S89 
to a modification of the plan on which the Appendix was ])repared. 
From 1880 to 1888 the Appendix was chiefly devoted to an annual sum- 
mary of progress in various branches of science. The growing inefll- 
ciency of this summary, due to causes elsewhere mentioned, led me to 
return in the report for 188!> to the earlier ])lan of Prof. Heury, whicli 
was to present a selection of papers by eminent, or at least conqietent, 
expositois, chosen from the scientific literature of the year. This modi- 
fication, or rather this return to tiie nu'thod of the earlier reports, 
has been continued, and seems to me(^t with general api)reciation at the 
hands of the correspond<'nts (»l"the Tnstitution and others to whom the 
reports arii sent. The re})ort for 1800 issued during the year embraces 
a considerable range of scientific investigation and discussion. Many 
of the papeis are the work of distinguished investigators, and all are 
presented in untechnical language so as to interest the laigest number.

12 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

surface of tlie moon is of special and growing interest to geologists, 
wlio have rarely access to the largest class of telescopes, and what we 
know of it is derived very largely from maps made from eye-studies by 
astronomers. 

Within a few years photography has beeu used with such increasing 
advantage in this interesting field, that it is believed by those compe- 
tent to express an opinion, that i^hotographs can shortly be produced 
which will exliibit in a i)ermanent form everything that a trained eye 
can recognize at the most i^owerful telescope. If this surprising result 
be not actually obtained, I am of opinion that it is attainable; and I 
have proposed to procure, through the association of the Smithsonian 
Institution with some of tlie leading observatories of the world, a series 
of photographic representations of hitherto unequaled size and defini- 
tion, which shall represent the moon's snrfiice as ftir as possible on a 
definite scale, and entirely without the intervention of the draftsman. 
Photographs of the moon made at the Harvard, Lick, and Paris observ- 
atories have been placed at the disposition of the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion for publication, and it is intended to issue a series of them accom- 
panied by explanatory text. Whether this considerable work shall 
appear as one of the regular series of "Contributions to Knowledge,"' 
or as a special publication in a more limited edition, has not yet been 
decided. 

Smithsonian Tables. — The meteorological and i)hysical tables, originally 
prepared by Dr. Guyot and first published in 1851, have been in such 
demand that they have already passed through four editions. The last 
edition was exhausted several years ago, and in considering the advisa- 
bility of issuing a fifth edition, it was determined in 1887 to rev^ise the 
tables to conform to the present state of our knowledge. The work has 
been divided into three parts, meteorological, geographical, and i)hysi- 
cal, each one being independent of the others, but the three capable of 
forming a homogeneous volume. 

In carrying out this plan I was able to secure the assistance of Prof. 
William Libbey, jr., of Princeton, under w hose editorship the last edi- 
tion was issued in 1884, and Prof. Libbey, devoting gratuitously such 
time to the work as he could command from his engrossing college duties, 
prepared the first volume of the series, the "Meteorological Tables." 
The plan of the work was then somewhat modified and a farther re- 
vision was made by Mr. G. E. Curtis, who was at the time emj^loyed upon 
other work at the Smithsonian Institution, and by the end of December, 
1891, the manuscript was essentially ready i'ov the printer. Since that 
timeit has been passing through thejiress, and it is hoped thait the volume 
will be entirely finished by the close of the present calendar year. 

SMITHSONIAN INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE. 

The international exchange service, through which the Smithsonian 
Institution is known to most of the large libraries and to a vast num- 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13 

berofscietitific lueii tbrouiihout the world, has received sueh attention 
in my recent reports that it seems unnecessary to dwell upon it at 
length here. 

Tlie work of the bureau continues to increase, and in spite of many 
labor-saving devices in the clerical work suggested by experience, it will 
be impossible to meet all the demands made for transi)ortation of doc- 
uments unless some considerable inciease is also made in the amount 
appropriated by the General Government in the near i'uture. 

The United States Government has undertaken, by a treaty fornni- 
lated at Brussels in 1886, and iiually proclaimed by the President in 
1889, to carry on a system of international exchanges. These various 
countries adhering to the treaty have formally agreed each to estab- 
lish a bureau charged with the duty of attending to the exchange of 
official documents, i)ar]iamentary and administrative, which are pub 
lished in the country of their origin, and the bureaus of exchange will 
furthermore serve as intermediaries between the learned bodies and 
literary and scientific societies of the contracting States for the recep- 
tion and transmission of their i)ublications. 

In transmitting al)road each State assumes the expenses of i)acking 
and transportation to the place of destination, but when the transmis- 
sions are made by sea, special arrangements i-egulate the share of each 
State in the expense of transportation. 

The Smithsonian Institution, having since 1850 conducted an ex- 
change service with means of communication over the entire world, has 
been charged by the United States Government with the conduct of 
its own exchange business, and appropriations for the purpose have 
accordingly been made of late years to the Institution,- covering at 
present tlie greater part of the expense. The deticiency arising each 
year has been met from the Smithsonian fund, and tlie Institution hag 
continued its i)aid agents in I'^ngland and in Germany, as these two 
countries have not signitied their adherence to the treaty in question, 
but maintain exchange relaticnis with the United States independently 
of other countries concerned in the treaty. By referring to the cura- 
tor's statistical report contained in the Ajipendix, it will be seen that 
over 100 tons of books passed through the exchange office during the 
fiscal year, representing 07,0:J7 ])ackages — an increase of (),3()L packages 
over the number liandled during the prc^ceding year — while n\)on the 
exchange books, accounts of pnblications received and transnutted are 
kei)t with 20,082 societies or institutions and individuals. The expen- 
ditures upon this account haveauKninted to $2(),.)10.49, of which $17,000 
were ap[)ropriated by (Congress, $2,108.11 Avere repaid by Government 
bureaus, and $30.75 by State institutions and others, leaving a 
deficiency of $1,171.30 to be met by the Smithsonian Institution. 

The exjjcnses, it will be noted, take no acconnt of the rent value of 
the rooms in the Institution occnpied in this manner b>' the (Jeneral 
Government for exchange i)urposes, or that portion of the; service ot 



14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

the regular officers of the Institution occupied with exchange business, 
and the sum appropriated by Congress would be entirely inadequate 
were it not that the chief ocean steamship companies have, since the 
early days of the Institution, granted the privilege of free freight for 
its exchange boxes. I have repeatedly called attention to the impro- 
priety of further trespassing upon the generosity of these companies, 
the privilege having been originally intended as a direct encouragement 
of the philanthropic aims of the Institution, whereas now a very large 
proportion of the freight thus carried is Government property and the 
service is conducted under an international treaty. 

I may further call attention in this place to the fact that an additional 
treaty made at Brussels in 1886 and proclaimed by the President of the 
United States on January 15, 1889, wherein lU'ovision is made for the 
immediate exchange of ofticial journals, parliamentary annals and docu- 
ments, has never been executed. A bill making an appropriation of 
$2,000 for this purpose passed the Senate in 1891, but no final action 
thereon has been taken. 

The amount estimated for the conduct of the exchange service for 
the year 1892-'93 was $23,000, a sum which was expected to cover the 
X)reseut expense of the Exchange Bureau in a single item, including the 
$2,000 just mentioned. At the close of the fiscal year the Sundry Civil 
Appropriation bill, of which this was an item, had not become a law. 

I desire to mention again here the increasing difficulty of making 
provision for the storage of Government publications not needed for 
immediate transmission abroad. A iiortion of the building is now de- 
voted to this imrpose which is needed more and more each year for the 
more legitimate purposes of the Institution. 

The exchange offices are also needed for the growing reference library 
of scientific books belonging to the Institution, and with a view to re- 
lieving the overcrowded condition of the library by removing these 
offices to the basement, 1 have urged upon Congress the desirability of 
making available for the purpose, the balance of an appropriation orig- 
inally intended for repairs and alterations to the western part of the 
building, which, by reason of a restricting clause in the appropriation 
act, can not be used for the work first x)roposed. By the expenditure 
of about $10,000 the basement of the east wing, now damp and some- 
times flooded with water, can be made thoroughly healthy and weU 
adapted to the needs of the exchange Avork. 

In my report for 1890 I stated that there had been expended from the 
Smithsonian fund for the support of the international exchange sys- 
tem, in the interests and by the authority of the National Government, 
$38,141.01 in excess of appropriations, advanced from January 1, 1868, 
to June 30, 1886, for the exchange of official Government documents, 
and $7,031.81 in excess of appropriations from July 1, 1886, to June 30, 
1889, advanced for the purpose of carrying out a convention entered 
into by the United States, or an aggregate of $45,175.82.

Of these accessions, 297 volumes, 0,303 i)arts of volumes, and 774 i)am-

seum; and 857 medical dissertations Avere dejwsited in the library of 
tlie Surgeon-General, U. S. Army; the remaining- publications were 
sent to the Library of Congress on the Monday following their receipt. 

The reading- room continues to be well used ; it has only been possi- 
])le t(> providf^ room upon the shelves for new periodicals by removing 
to the special libraries under the charge of (curators or to the Library 
of Congress such technical periodicals as experience has shown are 
seldom called for by general readers. 

The i)laii detailed in my report for 1887-'88 for increasing- the acces- 
sioufs to the library and for completing- the series of scientific journals 
already in i)ossession of thi^ Institution has been continued; the sup- 
])lementary work involved by the issue of new scientitic journals within 
the last few years has added somewhat to the work originally planned. 

The small collection of books forming what is called '' the Secretary's 
library" has been added to this year, but is already encroaching- upon 
the limited space available for library purposes. These books, as I have 
stated in my previous reports, are mostly, if not exclusively, books of 
scientific reference, and are, under certain restrictions, available to all 
connected with the Institution. 

I regret to state that Mr. John Muidoch, who has been the efiicient 
librarian of the Institution since 1887, resigned his position on May 
15, 1892. At the close of the year his successor had not been appointed. 



16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

MISCELLANEOUS. 

Tomb of Smithsou. — During the .summer of 1S!>1, upon the oc(;asion 
of ii visit to Europe, I made a s])ecial journey to Genoa for the purpose 
of seeing if the phxee of sepulture of the founder of the Institution was 
properly cared for. The tomb of Smithson is on the hill of San Be- 
nigno, high above the Gulf of Genoa, in a small obscure cemetery, 
whose existence is unknown to most of the people of the city. It is the 
property of the English Government and in the immediate charge of 
the British consul. Smithson's tomb is a substantial structure, but it 
appears to have had no attention during the sixty years of its existence, 
though other tombs in the small inclosure give evidence of continued 
care. A small sum of money, the interest of which is sufficient to de- 
fray the expense of the care of the inclosure and tomb, was i)laced to 
the credit of the United States consul at Genoa, who kindly consented 
to take charge of the matter. 

Statue of Prof. Baird. — A bill to provide for the erection of a bronze 
statue of Prof. Baird in the grounds of the Institution was introduced 
in the Senate by Mr. Morrill, but failed to pass. This was a renewal 
of previous efforts in this direction and the result is particularly disap- 
pointing to the friends of the Institution. 

Statue ofRohert Dale Given. — A bill to appropriate $20,000 for a statue 
to the Hon. Eobert Dale Owen, of Indiana, first chairman of the Board 
of Regents of the Institution and one of its staunchest friends, was in- 
troduced in the Senate by Mr. Voorhees and passed, but failed to secure 
favorable action in the House. 

Perkins collection of copper implements. — An amendment to the Sun- 
dry Civil Bill providing for the purchase by the Institution of a further 
collection of prehistoric copper implements belonging to Mr. Freder- 
ick S. Perkins, was proposed, but failed to secure favorable action in the 
House. 

Stereotype plates. — The Institution is possessed of a large collection 
of stereotype plates and engravers' blocks. An effort has been made 
to arrange these in a systematic manner to facilitate reference, but 
owing to the pressure of routine work, nuicli yet remains to be done in 
this direction. It is the policy of the Institution to permit the use of 
these plates by pubhshers under reasonable conditions. 

Government collections at Washington. — There was passed during the 
first session of the Fifty-second Congress a joint resolution (H. Res. 92) 
defining the policy of the Government with reference to the scientific 
and literary collections, designed to facilitate the use of such collections 
by students, and to encourage the establishment of institutions of learn- 
ing at the national capital. 

Assignment of rooms. — Pendulum observations by officers of the U. S. 
Coast and Geodetic Survey have been continued in a, basement room 
specially fitted for such work. 

The use of the "chapel" of the Smithsonian building was granted

to the Aineiicau Oiieiital Society as a placcof assembly in Ai)ril. 1892, 
and hiter to the Art ( Jon.iiress for a h)aii exhibition of works of Amer- 
ican artists, hehl duriiiu- the session of tlie Coni^ress in ^Fay, 1892. 

The HodgJiiits (/iff. — In May, 1891, a letter received from ^fr. Thomas 
Geori^e Ilodgkius, of Setauket, N. Y., led to a correspondence in which 
he was advised by the Secretary of the objects of the Institution. At 
Mr. Hodg'kins's re([uest, the iSecretary, andsabse(|uently, the Assistant 
Secretary, made several visits to him at his home, and in conversation 
with him learned more in detail his wishes witli reference to a ])rop(jsed 
gift. 

Mr. Hodgkins wished to present to the Smithsonian Institution the 
sum of 8200,01)0, the interest of A 100,000 of which was to be used for 
the general purposes of the Institution in the "increase and diffusion 
of knowledge among men," provided that the interest of the other .$100,- 
000 should l>e used in the investigation of the properties of atmos})heric 
air considered in its very widest relationship to all branches of science. 

Before taking any steps with regard to this offer, a telegram Avas sent 
(m June 22, I8t)l. to each Regent who could be reached in this country, 
reipiesting his individual opinion of the propriety of accepting Mr. 
Hodgkins' proposition. Favorable opinions having been received in 
answer to this from nearly all the Kegeuts, Mr, Hodgkins later, on 
Septend)er 22, at his home,' on Long Island, i)laced his gift of •$200,000 
in cash in the hands of the Secretary, with the understauding that an 
early n.ieeting of the Regents would be called to consider its formal 
acceptance under the terms which Mr. Hodgkins proposed. 

A meeting of the Regents was therefore called at the earliest day 
practicable (October 21, 18!) 1), and the matter having been laid before 
them in detail, the gift was accepted in the terms of the donor. 

It seems appropriate at this time to make a statement in elucidation 
of Mr. llodgkins's wishes as they have been expressed in various 
conferences with the Secretary and the Assistant Secretary. It is not 
his intention that liis fund should be applied to special investigation in 
sanitary science, but he desires rather that the standard of work 
should be primarily in relation to the demands ol" ])ure science, believing 
that application in many directions would follow. lie has si>oken of 
the experiments of l-'ranklin upon atmosi>heric electricity as one of the 
investigations which, if carried on at tlie piescnt day, would be 
germane to his foundation; ami has, in fuitiier illustration of his 
meaning, also referred to the prize awarded by the French A{;ademy of 
Sciences to Paul Bert for his discovery in regard to the intluences of 
oxygen on the phenomena of vitality, as ai)pro]»riate to his own pro- 
posed foundation. His great interest in the diffusion of knowledge 
concerning air grows out of his belief that the air is of the highest 
importance to man in (n^ery aspect of his physical and mental condition, 
and he hopes that his gift will stimulate scientific investigation of the 
highest order by the best minds, believing that by this means the 
H. Mis. Ill 2 



18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

attentiou of mankind may best be concentrated and kept concentrated 
on the importance of the subject. He has expressed a hope that it 
might be thought advisable to offer some very considerable prize, 
which, being pubhshed to the eutu^e world, wouhl by its magnitude call 
attention to the subject in which he was so much interested. 

Much consideration nas been given to the question as to how the 
donor's wishes may best be carried into effect, for no small difftculty 
arises from the universality of the application of his foundation, since 
manifestly there is no branch of natural science which is not affected 
by it. Meteorology, hygiene and related subjects are most obviously 
concerned, while others, though less obviously, are no less immediately 
connected, such as geology, for instance, which has for its field the 
crust of the earth, now recognized as being largely formed of atmos- 
pheric deposits and molded by atmospheric intlueuces. This is only 
an instance of what we find in the case of nearly every one of the 
whole circle of sciences, biological and physical, all of which appear 
on examination to be affected by our knowledge of the atmosphere in 
a very real and important sense. 

In order to secure the advice and co-operation of scientific men 
throughout the world, letters were addressed to a number of eminent 
specialists, stating the circumstances of Mr. Hodgkins's gift to the 
Institution, and explaining his wishes. The following letter is an 
example : 

Sir: I have the honor to inform you that a bequest has been made 
to the Smithsonian Institution by Mr. Thomas G. Hodgkins, the income 
of a portion of which is to be devoted to the increase and diffusion of 
more exact knowledge of the nature and properties of atmospheric air. 

In carrying out the donor's wishes, it is proposed to offer a number 
of prizes for scientific investigations of a high order of merit bearing 
upon the properties of the atmosphere, to be awarded without regard 
to the nationality of tlie author. 

While hygiene will occupy a prominent place, it is not intended to 
limit these "prizes to any single class of investigations, however im- 
portant, but to extend them over the whole field of the natural sciences, 
as far as these may be regarded as related to each other through the 
atmosphere as a common bond. 

In illustration of my meaning, I may instance as proper subjects for 
investigation — 

1. Anthropology, considering man himself as modified by climate, 

and his arts as affected by the atmosphere; 

2. Biology, in connection with the atmosphere as a fountain of life; 

3. Chemistry, in its many obvious relationships to the subject; 

4. Electricity, considered in connection with atmospheric electricity; 

5. Geology, considered in connection with the action of the atmos- 

phere in its formation and deformation of the surface of the 

planet; 
and so on through almost the whole circle of the sciences. 

I now write to ask if you will kindly suggest the nature of the prin- 
cipal relationsliips existing between physics and the atmosphere, and 
indicate one or two subjects arising out ot these relations which you 
consider to be proper lor prize essays. 



RKPOKT OF THE SECKETAHY. 19 

T sluill also be jxlad to know if you will conscut to ho a incinbev of a 
coininittce to award such ai prize, if jiivcii, and to leain from you in 
the saniecoMiieetiou of any important icsearcli, .iicrniane to your own 
studies, that would be nuiterially advanced by a grant Irom the funds 
now available under this liberal construction. 

In further illustration of my meaniui;', I take the liberty of inclosing 
a copy of a reply made to me in answer to a similar impiiry concerning 
the science of anthropoh)gy, which 1 do merely to show more clearly 
the character of the information I desire. 

The following was the inclosure. It is an answer by a distinguished 
anthropologist to a similar <|uestion, and was inclosed as an illustration 
of the fact that the terms of the Ilodgkins donation api)ly <'ven to sci- 
entific matters which may appear at first sight disconnected with the 
subject (/. f. to anthroi>ology), but which upon consideration are seen 
to be intimately related to it: 

Dear, Sir : In reply to your imjuiry concerning the relations existing 
between anthropology and the study of the atmosphere I l)eg leave to 
say that the natural history of man takes into consideration: — 

(1) Man, as modified by climate, 

(2) His arts as occasioned and afi'ected by the atmosphere. 

As to the first, the atmosphere, through climate, elevation, etc., upon 
man considered as an animal, is l)elieved to have affected his bodily 
form and stature, the color of his eyes, hair, and skin; his longevity, 
fecundity, and vigor, and therefi)re to have been the most ])otent factor 
of all iii producing those varieties of onr si)ecies called races, and to be 
at the foundation of these problems whose discussion constitutes the 
science of ethnology. 

As to the second, most of the arts and activities of man depend upon 
the atmosphere^ for their suggestion and methods. For example, his 
habitations, clothing-, and the common occupations of his daily life are 
most obviously controlled by hisatmosphei'i*' surroundings, which make 
him in the Arctic regions a hunter of furs, dwelling underground; in 
the temperate zone a farmer, dwelling- in houses; in the tropics a 
hunter of ivory, dwelling- in open shelters from the sun. 

Permit me to observe further, that the study of the air can not be 
omitted in connection with the sci<'nce of sociology. E\en philology 
draws its material and i)erha]»s derives it forms largely from the atmos- 
])here, andthei»rimitive]>hil()S()phiesand mythologies of the world are 
filled with imag<'ry an<l theories derived therefrom. Therefore in select- 
ing, at your rexjuest, from the relationships of the atmosi)here to the 
science of antliiopi)logy in general, two or more subjects foi" i)rize 
essays, I have only too much s(u)])e. 

After nuu;h consideration I would pro])ose to suggest that a ])rize of 
not less than $1,000 sliould be offered for an essay upon oneof the fol- 
lowing topics: 

1. The relation of atmospheric phenomena, to the cosmogenies, 

creeds, and cults of all peoi)les. 

2. Atmos])heric changes as determiniu.g the foi-nis of primitive so- 

ciety, family and tril)al organizations, etc. 

3. As between the monogenistic and the i)olyg-euistic theory of the 

origin of man, what light is thrown u[)on the (luestion by a study 
of atmospheric intluences upon nnui's ])hysical constitution. 

4. Atmospheric infiueuees and phenomena as afi'ecting constructive 

and decorative architecture. 



20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

These essays vshould be presented within a specitied time and sub- 
mitted to the judgment of a committee, of vrhieh I should be Avilling 
to be a member. Notice of tliis prize coukl advantageously be made 
public through the following special journals: L'Anthropologie, Paris; 
Archiv fiir Anthropologic, Braunschweig. 

In regard to your incjuiry as to any in>portant research germane to 
the subject in which 1 am personally interested, which would be ad- 
vanced by a grant of money, I beg leave to say that I am at present 
hindered from pursuing my investigations into the influence of climate 
and other atmosidieric phenomena in bringing about the distribution 
of tribes and stocks of North American aborigines at the time of the 
discovery, by the need of a small sum of money which might be placed 
at my disposal. If I had $500 unfettered by conditions, I could within 
a year's time undertake to bring together the elements for the solution 
of this problem, whii-h has puzzled for so many years students of 
ethnology and philology. 

i anj, very resjiectfully yours,

As soon as the attention of the ])ublic had been directed to Mr. 
Hodgkins's gilt, numerous applications for assistance from the fund 
were made, and T deemed it advantageous to appoint a special advisory 
committee, to which might be referred nmtters pertaining to the 
Hodgkins fund. This committee was comi>osed of Surgeon John S. 
Billings, U. H. Army, Director of the Army MedictJ Museum, in behalf 
of hygiene and tlie related sciences; Prof. F. W. Clarke, chemist of 
the U. S. Geological Survey; Mr. William II. Dall of the U. S. Geolog- 
ical Survey, well known for his biological and an.thropological studies; 
Prof. AVilliam 0. Winlock, in behalf of astronomy and physics, and the 
Assistant Secretary of the Institution, Dr. G. Brown Goode, who acted 
as chairman. The committee has held several meetings, and I desire 
at this time to express my high api)reciation of the value of the work 
which they have already done, both as a committee and individually. 
At the close of the year, the committee had under consideration, at my 
request, a form of circular to be issued to learned institutions and in- 
vestigators throughout the world, calling attention to the establish- 
ment of the Hodgkins fund, and announcing certain prizes which it is 
intended to olter for essays upon specihed subjects. 



THE NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

1 took occasion in my last report to invite your attention to the fact 
that the very rapid growth of the collections of the Museum was be- 
coming, under existing circumstances, a source of great embarrass- 
ment. The difficulties of the situation have increased during the past 
year, since, while the influx of specimens has continued, no additional 
space has been provided for their reception and only an insignificant 
additional sum of money for their maintenance. 



KKl'ORT OF THE SIX'KKTAKY. 



21 



Tills iiiisolicited iuciTiise of the ('ollcctioii.s should pri-jxTly be, a 
souicc of <;i;ititi('atioii rather than of einbarrassmeut. Growth is osseii 
tial to the welfare of a museum, and to check it is sur*^ to produce un- 
fortunate results. It seems undesirable to say to the friends of the 
Museum that their valuable donations can not be received. Such a 
course would alienate their sympatliy, and the Museum would lose the 
advantage of their good oftici's. Under existing' conditions, however, 
the necessity of resorting to so uiulesirable a measure is perilously 
near. The increase of tlu^ ctdlections from certain other simrces can 
not even thus be checked. 

Large collections are made every year by the Department of Agri- 
culture, the (leological Survey, the Fish Commission, and other De- 
partments and Bureaus of the Government, either as an essential part 
of their work or incidentally. By provision of law the Museum is made 
the custodian of these collections, and it can not, therefore, do other- 
wise than to receive and preserve them. 

Many valuable objects are exposed to dust and vandalism from the 
lack of sufficient money to procure the necessary cases for their protec- 
tion. Series of objects, such as the great Lacoe collection of fossil 
plants, recently acquired, are frequently ottered with the condition that 
suitable cases be provided. For the safe-kecqdng of tln^ objects already 
in the possession of the IMuseum and foi- the reception of those ottered, 
nunuu'ous storage and exhibition cases are a lu'cessity. 

The number of si)ecimens of all kinds in tin? Museum at the close of 
the year, as shown by the following table, nearly eipialled three and a 
quarter millions. The increase for the year was about 2()0,0()0 speci- 
mens, or nearly dcuible that of bSlM.

'No census of the collection taken. 

TTp to 1890 the numbers have reference only to specimens received through the Museum, and do 
not include specimens received for the National Herbarium through the Department of Agriculture. 
The figures given for 1890-'91 include, for the first time, the number of specimens received both at the 
National Museum and at the Department of Agriculture for the National Herbarium. 

^The actual increase in the collections during the year 1889-'90 is nnich greater thiin appears from a 
comparison of the totals for 1889 and for 1890. This is explained by the apparent absence of any increase 
in the department of lit]iology and metallurgy ; the total for 1890 in both of these departments com 
bined, showing a decrease of 46,314 specimens, owing to the rejection of worthless material. 

■•Although about 200 specimens have been received during the year, the total number of specimens 
in the collection is now less than that estimated for 1889, owing to the rejection of worthless material. 

^The collection now contains between 3,000 and 4.000 specimens. 

*No estimate of increase made in 1890 or 1891.

' The actual increase iu the collections during the year 1889-'90 is much greater than ajipears from a 
coiiiparispn of the totals for 1889 and for 1890. This is explained by the apiiarent absence of any increase 
in the depart ment of lithology and inetallurgy ; tlie total for 1890 in both of these deiiartuieids com- 
bined, sliowing a decrease of 40,314 specimens, owing to tlie rejection of \Miit bless material. 

■^Included in the historical collection. 

^The total number of specimens in the deitartmenr of liiiils in 1.S90-'91 was O2..so() insltad of O2.(iol. 

••Only a small )iortiiin of llie colleciiou represented by tliis iiiiniber was received liiiriiig tlie year 
18g9-"90. 

"The decrease in this dejiartment for the year 1891-'92 was occasioned b\ tlie tniiisl'er of l,0(iO 
skeletons to the department of vertebrate fossils. 

''Vyi to 1.-90 the niinibers have reference only to specimens received through the Museum, and do 
not include specimens received for the National Heibariiim tlirougli tbc Di'partment of Agriciillure. 
The figuies given for 1890-'91 include, for the first time, the number of specimens receiveil both at the 
National Museum and at the Department of Agriiulture for the National Herbaiiuin. 

'(Collections combined in October, 18S9, under Department of Geology. Tlie ajiparent decrea'<e of 
more than 50 i)er cent of the estimated total for 1889 is accounted for (1) by the rejection of several 
thousands of specimens from the collection, and (2) by the fact that uo estimate of the specimens in 
the reserve and duplicate series is included. 

'Transferred to the National Zoiilogical Park. 

Note. — The fact that the figures for two successive years relating to tlie same collection are un- 
changed, does not necessarily imply tliat there has been no iucrea.so in tlie collection, but that for soma 
spacial reason it has not been possible to obtain the figures showing the increase. 



24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

Condition of the exhibition halls. — The results of over-crowding are 
evident everywhere in tlie exhibition halls. The installation of the 
collections and the comfort of visitors are interfered with. It has 
become necessary to narrow the aisles in many halls to such a degree 
that they are almost impassable, and on occasions when unusual num- 
bers of visitors are in the city, many objects of interest have to be 
withdrawn from exhibition. The unavoidable crowding of the cases 
interferes with the lighting, so that many objects are practically 
hidden fi-om view. 

To relieve the present pressure, as regards space, I have, in address- 
ing Congress, brought forward two propositions. For immediate and 
temporary relief 1 have recommended the erection of light galleries 
in two of the halls, with the intention of hereafter asking for others of 
the same character. Such galleries, unlike those in the main Smith- 
sonian hall, were provided for in the original plans of the building, and 
can be erected without detracting from the appearance of the halls. 

While these galleries would add materially to the available exhibition 
space, we must look to the erection of a new museum building for more 
permanent relief from the present overcrowded condition. A bill 
providing for the construction of a new building has twice received 
favorable action by the Senate, but has failed to pass the House. 

It is greatly to be hoped that both the galleries and also an addi- 
tional building may be provided without further delay. 

Curatorships. — There are now in the Museum thirty-three organized 
departments and sections, under the care of eight curators, paid by the 
Museum, and twenty honorary curators, detailed for special duty from 
different bureaus of the Government. While the latter render very 
important and highly appreciated services, they are, of course, more 
especially occupied with their own peculiar duties, and can not devote 
more than a small portion of their time to the interests of the Museum. 
The technical character of the tluties of the curators renders highly de- 
sirable the employment of a larger paid staff of men who have had 
special training for nuiseum work. In order to secure the services of 
such persons, however, and to obtain the best results for the Museum, 
greater inducements should be offered in the way of compensation. 
There are few professors in our colleges who do not receive larger sal- 
aries than it is now possible to pay the curators of the Museum, who, 
nevertheless, in addition to their onerous executive duties as custodians 
of the collections, are expected to furnish scientific information for re- 
plies to the thousand of inquiries received every year. 

It maybe added that the proper preservation of the collections often 
entails much manual labor, and in many instances immediate and stren- 
uous efforts are lu^eded to save from entire loss large collections of a 
perishable nature. Urgent work of this kind is not unfrequently per- 
formed by the curators. 

It is most desirable that the scientillc staff" of the Museum should be 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25 

periiuiiK'iitly ideutifiecl with it, and this coiKlition can iiardly he reached 
unless a niajovity at least of the curatois are ])aid from its ai>]tro|)ria- 
tions. The permanent assi<;iinient of the curators to tlieir respective 
departments, with adecpiate compensation and the absencie of e.\trane(»us 
duties, would materially advance the work of the ^luseuni on its scien- 
titic side. 

The lack of means to employ a sufticient inunber of assistants in the 
lower grades causes a largeaniount of minor routine work to fall on the 
curators, who are capable of rendering services of a higher (diaracter. 
On account of this condition of affan\s many plans of the greatest iini)()r- 
tance to the ^Museum are held in abeyance from year to year, or are 
never consummated. 

Clerical force. — Allusion has been made in my former rei»orts ro the 
need of additional clerical assistance in the iVIuseum. This need 
becomes greater every year as the collections increase in magnitude. 
The salaries paid for clerical work are less than in the executive depart- 
ments of the Government and elsewhere, and the Museum on many 
occasions has lost the services of comi)etent clerks, trained in their 
special work, who have been attracted to other tields of labor by higher 
compensation. Some of the dei)artments in the Museum are entirely 
without clerical assistance, and the curators are ol)liged to devote time 
which could l)e nuu-h Itetter employed, to the simple but necessary 
work of cataloguing and labelling s]>ecimens, ])rei)aring invoices, and 
unpacking boxes. 

For the safekee])ing of the collections, whicii have greatly increased 
in intiinsic \alue as well as extent, a larger nund>er (jf watchmen is 
necessary. The force is now so small that it is difticult to grant the 
usual leaves of absence without exposing the collections to danger, 
ft is also Avith difhculty that the cleanliness of the floors and cases is 
maintained, on account of the limite<l number of labcu^ers and cleaners 
which the i)resent appropriation will i)ermit the "Museum to employ. 

DisfrihiUwH of specimens. — The distribution of duplicate material to 
e<lucational institutions has been continued as far as practicable. This 
means of dilfusing knowledge is one of the most popular features of the 
.Museum work, and has been carried on unceasingly for nearly half a 
century, during which time nearly half a million sjiecimens, embracing 
mamnnds, fishes, marine invertebrates, birds, shells, rocks, ores, min- 
erals, and ethnological objects, ha\'e been given to Museums and other 
educational institutions in the United States, Miiile important ex- 
changes with similar institutions abroad have residted in nnich good to 
the Museum. This work, too, is now being seriously liindered, owing 
to lack of si)ace for the pro[»er handling and separation of the duplicate 
material, and its classification and arrangement into series for distribu- 
tion. 

The material distributed during the year consisted chietiy of nuner- 
als, marine invertebrates, and casts of prehistoric stone implements, 
and amounted to 32,098 specimeas. 



26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

Fublications. — There lijis been unusual activityin the work of this de- 
partment of the Museum during the year. The report for 1889 has been 
publish ed, and the report for 1890 has been put in type, Th e manuscript 
of the report for 1891 was sent to the Public l*rinter and is now going- 
through the press. Vol. xiii of the '' Proceedings" of the National Mu- 
seum has been published. Of the ^'Bulletin," jSTos. 39 (Parts A to G)^ 
41 and 12 have been issued. 

The Proceedings and Bulletins of the iSTational Museum are not "pub- 
lic documents," hence no part of the edition is regularly apportioned 
for distribution by the Senate and House, or to the legal depositcn-ies. 
The edition of 3,000 copies, now printed, is only snflieiout to supply in 
limited measure the very urgent requests from public libraries, educa- 
tional institutions, and scientific investigators in the United States and 
throughout the world. A larger appropriation for printing is needed, 
so as to enable the Museum to place a full series of its publications in 
representative libraries in different parts of each State. It is not the 
intention that the annual number of issues of the Proceedings and Bul- 
letins should be increased, but that a larger edition of each should be 
printed. On account of the small edition, the Museum fails to receive 
in exchange the valuable publications of many scientific institutions. 

The amounts hitherto appropriated, though expended with strict 
economy, have been found inadequate. 

Visitors. — The total number of visitors to the Smithsonian building 
during- the past year was 114,817, and to tlie Museum 269,825; total, 
384,642. This is an increase of 13,453 over the previous year. 

Heating and W/hting. — The larger part of this approi)riation is ex- 
pended for fuel and gas. As has been explained in connection with 
the estimates for previous years, it is necessary for the safety of the 
collection that the buildings should be kept at a nearly even temj)era- 
ture day and night throughout the winter. The reduction of this ap- 
priation below the minimum of $12,000 will make a deficiency estimate 
necessary. From lack of fuel, required to maintain the proi^er temper- 
ature, some of the ofl&ces had to be abandoned on several occasions 
during- the winter of 1892. The longer the heating apparatus is used 
the less efidcient it becomes, and of late it has been necessary each 
successive year to expend a larger sum for replacing worn-out jiarts. 
The wires of the burglar alarms, watchman's call boxes, and other 
electrical apparatus, have deterioiated fiom long- use, and need imme- 
diate attention. 

There are at present in use in the Museum building twenty-five arc 
lights, and this number is not sufticient to illuminate the entire build- 
ing, there being no lights in the courts and an insufllicient number in 
the halls. It is thought that with an additional plant, costing about 
$5,000, the building may be so lighted that it can be thrown oi)en 
occasionally to the public at night, to the advantage of tliose persons 
who are unable to avail themselves of the regular hours of exhibition. 



KEPOKT OF THE «ECliETAUV. 27 

The purchase (»r an additional ciiuinc will also reixler it i)()ssible io 
provide a.uaiiist the contiii^ciK y ot total darkness in case of damag'e 
to dynamo, line, or motor. 

By tlie appropriation of -"^a.OOO for the removal of decayed wooden 
Hoors, and the substituting of gi-anolithic or artilicial stone pavement 
therefor, it has been j^ossibk' to comi»lete a much needed improvement 
in several of the halls and courts of the Museum. 

With a view of securing the best pavement possible, as well as fen- 
the ])urpose of obtaining for future guidance a practical knowledge of 
the merits of the artilicial stoue flooring made by <lifferent bidders, 
three proposals which did not vary materially in amount, were accei>ted. 
It will require a greater length of time than has yet elapsed to pro- 
nounce upon the relative merits of these pavements, but they have 
already proved themselves far more satisfactory than the wooden floors 
for which they were substituted, and it is hoped that it will soon be 
possible to put down the same, or some equally durable form of pave- 
jiient, in the parts of the museum which still lack this improvement. 

The WorhV.s Columbian Exposition. — The work of preparing an ex- 
hibit for the World's Fair in Chicago has been continued during the 
year. A full report of the participation of the Smithsonian Institution 
and the National Museum in this exhibition will be deferred until such 
time as a complete statement can be made. 

BUEEAU OF ETHNOLOGY. 

Ethnological researches among the North American Indians have 
been continued by the Smithsonian Institution, in compliance with 
acts of Congress, during the year 1891-'92, under the direction of Maj. 
J. W. Powell, who is also Directoi- of the U. S. Geological Survey. 

The work of the Bureau of Ethnology during the year has been con- 
ducted on the same systematic plan before explained as in successful 
operation. The authors of the i)ublications of the Bureau prepare 
tiiem from material personally gathered by themselves in the tield, 
which is supplemented by study of all the information attainable fiom 
other sources. 

In addition to the issue during the year of the Seventh Annual IJe- 
])ort and of six other volumes of publications, mentioned under that 
heading in the report of the Director hereunto ap[)ended, at the close 
of the fiscal year the Eighth and Ninth Annual Keports were in tyi)e, 
the tenth had been delivered to the Public Printer, and the eleventh 
and twelfth were on tile ready for delivery to that (»flicial as soon as 
there should be any ])rospect that their ])rinting could be conunenced. 
Other rei)orts and papei's not intended to form parts of the series of 
annual rei)orts were also hied as ready for printing. 

Another feature of the year's work consisted in the collection by 
officers of the Bureau, under the authority of law, of erhnoh)gic objects 



28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

for the exhibit at the World's Columbian Exposition. This authority 
was opportune, as objects of that character are becoming scarce and 
costly and jirobably could not, after a few montljs, be secured for pres- 
ervation in a permanent collection. A similar work of preservation, 
also authorized by law, was executed in the restoration of the ruin of 
Casa Grande, in Arizona. 

Mention of these special operations does not imply that the re- 
searclies into the religions, customs, history and other ethnologic data 
of the Indian tribes were omitted during the year. Details respecting 
all the work of the Bureau will be found in the report of its director, 
given in the Appendix. 

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK. 

The insufficiency of the appropriations for the maintenance of the 
National Zoological Park was pointed out in the report for the year 
ending June 30,1891, and experience amply supports the opinions there 
expressed. It does not seem superfluous to repeat the following passage 
from this last report : 

"The primary object for which Congress was asked to establish a 
National Zoological Park was to secure the preservation of those Amer- 
ican animals that are already nearly extinct, and this object it was 
thought would be best secured by the establishment of a large inclosure 
in which such animals could be kept in a seclusion as nearly as possible 
like that of their native haunts. It was believed that, except for initial 
expenses for buildings and roads for the public, this could be done with 
an outlay comi^a rati vely small, probably not exceeding $50,000 a year; 
for, after the necessaiy land was once acquired and fenced in, smaller 
inclosures and paddocks could be set off and inexpensive barns erected 
at about this yearly charge. 

It was, in the nature of things, inevitable that some provision should 
be made for the convenience of a curious and interested jniblic, as well 
as for the care and well being of animals unaccustomed to the i)res- 
ence of man. For the tirst of these it was intended to set aside a con- 
siderable area, on which the principal buildings should be placed and 
to which shonld be taken, as was expedient, such of the animals as 
might interest the public, the larger ])ortion of the park being still 
considered as a natural preserve where animals need be disturbed by 
no unusual surroundings, and where it was hoped they might, after 
the time necessary for their acclimation, breed their young. 

The maintenance of a park devoted ta these purposes, that is, pri- 
marily to useful and scientific ends, and secondly to recreation, seemed 
to those interested in its success a legitimate tax upon national re- 
sources, but when Congress decided that one-half of the necessary 
expenses should be raised by local taxation it seemed only fit that the 
tax-payers should be heard in their wish to liave prominence given to 
the feature that principally interested them, and their chief interest was 
natnrally in the park as a place of recreation. That this was recog- 
nized by a considerable body in Congress became evident from the sub- 
sequent debates. 

The moral right of the people of the District to ask consideration of 



REPORT OF THE SECKETAKV. 29 

their wishes for entcrtainineiit in return for the outlay which falls 
ui)ori them eau not be questioned, and so far as this could be reco^;- 
uized it iiitioduced a tendency to provide an establishment uiore like 
an ordiiuuy zoological garden, or permanent menagerie, than the com- 
paratively inexpensive scheme at first contemplated. 

Ill view of the circumstances an ap])ropriation was asked of Con- 
gress, which was believed to be smaller than was consistent with the 
proper ultimate development of the park, but on an estimate Avhich 
proposed to begin on the most economical scale. Tlius, for tlie general 
maintenance of the collection, $35,000 was asked, which is about the 
same as the annual sum silent in the Central Park meuitgerie, Xew 
York, having an area of about 10 acres, and atleast -$10,000 less than is 
spent either at the zoological garden in Cincinnati or IMiiladelphia, ea.-h 
haviiig an area of about 40 acres. ^Y]u*n it is rellected that tliese 
latter enterj)rises are conducted for business i)ur[)0ses by businessmen, 
that they have their collections already nearly comi)lete and purchas(i 
but few new aninuils, it will be seen that the sum asked for tin; main- 
tenance of the 07 acres of tlie National Zoological I*ark witli all the 
expensive animals yet to be jn'ocured was certainly not extra\agiint. 
Congress reduced this estimate to $17,o00, a sum Ibr which as ;i y(;ar's 
experience has now shown the Park can not be maintain(Hl. 

For buildings, an a[)propriation of .$;>0,8."J0 was asked. Jn this con- 
nection it may be recalled that in the Philadelphia gardens the build- 
ings and inclosures cost $101,705. Tlie sum estimated was intended to 
cover all inclosures and structures of every character indispensable on 
the modest scale projjosed. Congress reduced this to $18,000. 

The average expense of preparing such uncultivated grounds in city 
parks elsewhere has proved to be at least $2,900 per acre. The sum ol" 
$20,500 was asked for that i)urpose, as no moic than sufficient to fit 
such portions of the park as were necessary for th(5 immediate accom- 
modation of the public. Congress reduced this to $15,000. 

These icihictions have not only obliged me to retard the development 
on the lines that had been laid down, but have increased the ultimate 
cost; for where living creatures are in question it is plain that they 
have not (mly to be fed and guarded but to be housed; and all this at 
once, under penalty of their loss. Congress has plainly intended that 
they should be preserved, and that some sort of roads and access for 
the publi<' should be provided this year. 

The result has necessarily been, that with every elTort to obtain j)er- 
maiu'ut results there has been a partial expenditure of the absolutely 
insufticieut grant on enfor(;ed expedients of a temjjorary character, 
which are not in the interest of economy. 

It is extremely desirable that a sum (or emergencies be secured in the 
next appropriation. In carrying forward, from the beginning, novel 
and untried work of such varied clmracter. unforeseen diliicnlties nuist 
iiu'vitably arise, but no provision has been made Ibi- these, nor even for 
such readily anticipatecl emergencies as are caused, for instance, by 
floods in grounds traversed by a stream which has been known to rise 
C feet in less than half an hour. 

The difficulties which these c )nditions have imposed <m the admin- 
istration of the park may be laiily called extreme, and the amount and 
character of what has been effected nnist be considered in this con- 
nection. In s])ite of these the result, 1 thiidi, may be said to be, that 
atleast as a sonr(;e of inteiest and anuisement to the people the i)ark 
has exceeded the most sanguine expectations." 



30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

It will be observed that, of the $101,350 asked, two-thirds were for 
buildings and grounds which, if not provided for, could wait with com- 
paratively little inconvenience, whik' the reuiaining third, or $85,000, 
was for the care and food of living animals, for policing of the park 
and for the safety of the public, matters which, when the garden was 
once opened, could not wait, and could not be materially diminished, 
but constituted a comparatively fixed sum without which the park 
could not go on, and which should therefore be given nearly as it 
stood or withheld altogether. Congress, however, it will be seen, re- 
duced all these items nearly in the same proportion, that is, to about 
one-half. 

Two-thirds of the desired appropriation was of a natnre that could 
perhaps be reduced one year and made good later; the other third (that 
for food of living animals and maintenance), as painful experience has 
shown, could not be materially reduced and could not be made good 
later; and it is the deficiency on this item that has been the special 
cause of the difficulties of the administration. 

Inadequacy of appropriations. — Embarrassment also arose from the 
fact that the small amount ap])ropriated was specified and allotted un- 
der three separate subordinate heads and in three nearly equal amounts, 
although the needs were not equal. As the bounds of these allotments 
could not be overstepped, it occurred that, while there were relatively 
sufficient funds under one item (the care of grounds), there was entire in- 
adequacy under the much more essential head which i)rovided for the 
maintenance and care of living animals. No matter liow great the emer- 
gency or serious the need, it was, of course, impossible to change this 
allotment, and while the total appropriated by (Jongress might, by close 
economy, have been sufficient, yet there was danger that the animals 
would be unfed and that the force of watchmen and keepers, although 
overworked, would be i n adequate for their proper protection ; and as there 
existed no authority to give away or sell the animals, disaster of some 
kind would have ensued but for the aid indirectly given by the Smith- 
sonian Institution. 

It may here be mentioned that it was expected that a large number 
of animals would be obtained from the Yellowstone National Park, 
that being the principal great preserve for wild game C(mtrolled by the 
Government of the United States. With the consent of the honor- 
able the Secretary of the Interior, a hunter was employed to capture 
large wild animals in cimsiderable numbers, which were to be for- 
warded to the park at Washington. When a number of bears, deer, 
and elk were thus obtained, the reduced apinopriations were insufficient 
to continue his employment or to transport the animals already captured. 
A still more regrettable consequence was the necessity of refusing abso- 
lutely all gifts made by the public, as there were no means of paying for 
the transportation of animals or for tlieir subsistence when received. This 
has been a serious disadvantage to the collection, not only at present, 



REPORT OF THE SECKETAKY. 31 

but as regards its future, tor it need liardly be said that it lias dis- 
couraged and vebuiited uiaiiy i)ublic-si)irited citizens who would have 
been glad to ])rcseiit animals to the park, and who \\ill now cease to 
have any further interest in the enterprise. 

DinKjvrs hi/frcshcf. — On tiie .Ith of September, 1S!»1. a tieshet ot un- 
usual violence inva<h'd the valley of K'ock (^reek. Such was the rapid- 
ity of the increase of water that in less than half an hour tlie little 
stream had risen feet and had become a torrent of considerable mag- 
nitude and ])ower. The piers lor the bridge had Just been completed, 
but the banks above and below were not yet ])rotected from the abra- 
sion of a flood. In consecpience of this the water formed an eddy 
near one of the piers, causing it to break, and cracked one of the abut- 
ments. It is believed that this unfortunate accident was not due to any 
defect in the design of the pier (wliich was constructed un(hn' the com- 
l)etent supervision of the late Gen. ]Meigs), but rather to the fact that 
the frcslu^t occurred betbre the neighboring banks weie iirojicrly pre- 
l)ared. 

The damage to the pier was by no means the total extent of that 
caused by the flood. The bear-yards, then nearly completed and ready 
for occupation, were very seriously injured by the precipitation into 
them of many tons of rock and earth. Tins made it evident that the 
bank of earth and decomposed rock on the cliff above the yards could 
not be depended on without some additional safeguard. The heavy 
fall of water seriously injured and cut away the new r< ►ads, gutters, 
and drains that were yet fresh and unsettled, removed whole banks of 
earth from fresh slopes and washed oiit trees and bushes. The creek 
changed the level of its banks, cutting out a new channel for itself in 
several i)laces, and < overed the slopes with hundreds of tons of gravel 
and sand, and occasionally even deposited considerable stones, which 
were lifted by the rushing water and left upon the grass as a. striking 
evidence of the violence of the flood. Imnu'diate stei)s were commenced 
to repair the damage, butthis work was not completed within the flscal 
year on account of the insufficiency of the appropriation. 

The bear-yards are in an abandoned (]uarry, adjoining a i)recipice 
whose summit is upon tlie extreme boundary line of the])ark. For this 
reason no permanent i)rotection can be provided until the Government 
secures tlie few contiguous roods needed at the top. With this the sum- 
mit of the precipice, formed of the original rock, would constitute the 
cheap and natural barrier. For protection uiuler the actual, existing 
conditions, the only measure (and it is both incomplete and expensive) is 
to build a I'ctaiuing w;dl reaching from the solid rock of the cliff high 
enough to hold any detritus that might be disjjlaced by the action of 
rain or frost.* This has been commenced, but left incompleted owing 
to lack of funds.

32 REPOET OF THE SECRETARY. 

A considerable force of men was employed in repairing the roads, 
gutters, and drains, and in diverting tlie course of the stream so as to 
prevent further erosion of the banks. The amount expended in par- 
tially repairing the damage caused by the freshet was nearly $5,0(H). 
This unexpected demand upon already insufficient appropriations was 
another cause of embarrassment. 

Influx of visitors. — Public interest in the park has steadily increased 
from the beginning, and even in its present unfinished state the number 
of visitors in a single day sometimes reaches from five to ten thousand 
or more. It was supposed that when the collection should be of notable 
size, when the buildings were completed, the grounds improved, and 
the means of access ample, that a large number of visitors would fre- 
quent the park, but so very large and so immediate an attendance could 
hardly have been anticipated. It was Ibund that the force of watch- 
men was quite insufilicient properly to direct and control the throngs of 
people that on holidays passed through the unfinished houses and along 
the roads and paths. There are five entrances to guard, and eight sep- 
arate houses and inclosures where animals and property are kept, so 
far distant from one another that a watchman or keeper should be 
stationed at each, while in the larger houses, like the general animal 
house and the elephant house, it is desirable to have more than one 
keeper on hand, during the presence of great crowds, botli for the pur- 
pose of protecting children as well as to prevent mischievous individ- 
uals from injuring the animals. The services of the keepers are required 
chietiy in the day, but there must be watchmen to relieve each other 
during the whole twenty-four hours. Under these circumstances, the 
appropriation allowed— for the guarding of the animals, the public, and 
the policing of the 107 acres by day and l)y night— but six men includ- 
ing both watchmen and keepers. 

Defideney appropriation. — In view of these and other circumstances 
it seemed proper to ask a measure of relief from Congress. The fol- 
lowing estimates were accordingly framed and a deficiency appropria- 
tion asked to meet them :

Note.— I'liis appropriation is rendered necessary because of the 
storm of September 5. 1891, which greatly damaged the works of im- 
provement in the park. The sum asked is for the purpose of reim- 
bursing the appropriation for the amount actually expended in repair- 
ing those damages and preventing similar o(xurrouces for the future.

and much danger to the public and many accidents to the animals en- 
sued in consequence. The deer and antelope were annoyed and injured 
by (logs, the flock of valuable Angora goats was nearly destroyed by 
being poisoned by visitors with laurel {Kalm'ia latifolia), and many 
other injuries were inflicted on the animals, while the administration 
was in anxiety lest some grave accidents, such as were almost to be 
expected under these circumstances, sliould occur amoug the crowds of 
visitors, embracing not only adults, but children, of the latter of whom 
there were often many hundreds present and unprotected. 

Tlijit tliis niixiety was not unwarranted was shown on the night of 
May 24, when a grizzly bear, during the absence of the single watch- 
man, scrambled up the ahnost perpendicular cliff' in the rear of t]\^i 
yards and escaped from the park. After fruitless attemjits to capture 
him, and the injury of one of the employes whom he wouuded, orders 
were reluctantly given to shoot him. 

The following letter, setting forth the urgent needs of the park, was 
addressed to the Secretary of the Treasury on January 23 : 

Smithsonian Institution, 
Washington, J). 0., January 33, 1892. 

Sir: 1 beg leave to invite your attention to the estimates under the 
Smithsonian Instituticm for the fiscal year ending rTune 30, 1893, duly 
submitted to you October 7, 1891, and to the modified form in which 
these estimates were transmitted to Congress, whereby it w(udd seem 
to be reciuumended that no increase be made over the amounts appro- 
priated for the current year. 

While feeling that all the amounts asked for by the Institution have 
been only such as are ade(piate with the strictest economy, I have to 
ask your especial attention to the tluee items for the National ZocUogi- 
cal iPark, /. e., Improvements, Ikiildings, and Maintenance. Disasters 
from floods and like contingencies for which no juovision w^as made by 
Congress in the appropriations for the i)resent year emphasize the 
necessity of securing the full amount estimated undei- the headings 
Improvements and Buildings, while there exists exceptional necessity 
in the item for Maintenance, which is essentially for the food and care 
of living animals. 

The approi)riations made by the act of March 3, 1891, for " nuiin- 
tenance" during the i)resent fiscal year (for which .$35,000 was asked), 
was $17,000, but the sum of $5,122.71 from the appropriation of April 
30, 1890, w^as available and has been used for this purpose; and even 
with this addition it has been necessary to ask fi)r a deficiency ap])ro- 
l)riation of $4,431, chiefly to cover expenditures which w^ere found to 
be absolutely necessary to prevent loss to the Government. 

The mininuim ex i>en(li tares for the present year under this item will 
therefore be $22,(;22.71; the expenses for the first six months being 
$14,209.73, or at the rate of $28,539.40 per annum. I trust, therefore, 
that it is made sufficiently clear that witli an appropriation of $17,500 
it will be impossible to properly care for an<l feed tlie animals now on 
hand. 

Tliepast exjienditures would have been still larger but that the work 
on the accounts fin- the Treasury lias in part been done gratuitously by 
the Institution, which has also supplie<l free of cost office rooms, as weU

jistlu' aid and siqxM'visioii of uiij)aid naturalists. Tliis can notl)C reck- 
oned npon for the fnture, bnt lias been sanctioned bytlie Reuents as a 
means to nu'ct the exigency until the need of a larger a|)]>roi)riation can 
be rei)resented to Congress, and in the meantime the working force has 
been reduced to an extreme degree, the policing, foi- instance, being now- 
done by one watchnnm, aided by two employes who are largely engaged 
w ith othei- duties; and these three men are required to maintain order 
over an area of 1(!7 acres, visited during each day by thousands of people. 
Tliese <letails are mentioned in connectn)n with the fact that(unless sonu' 
small ])urchases of animals made at the outset be excepted) it is under 
like stringencies of economy in every branch of the administration that 
the expenses have already amounted, as shown above, to nioie than 
* 14.000 in six months. 

I can not too em])hatic-ally represent tlie peculiar difficulties that must 
aris(» in administering an insuflicient approi)riation for the care of liv- 
ing wild aninmls, unable to care for themselves where they are, if no 
provision has been nuide by Congress for disposing of them elsewhere. 

In view of increased expenses since the estimates were jnepared, due 
directly to the unexpectedly great i)opular interest manifested in the 
park, and to the extraordiimry increase of visitors, [ now feel com- 
])elled to either increase the estimate for maintenance to $30,000, to 
cover further contingencies, or to ask that the total appropriation 
re(]uested for the park be made in such form as to allow a certain dis- 
(aetionary power to meet them. If under the circumstances state<l, the 
latter would, in your judgment, be the more advisable course, I would 
resi)ectfully ask that you recommend to Congress that the three items of 
improvements ($1*0,000), l)uildings ($27,000), and maintenance ($20,000) 
be ai)propriated in one sum of $73,000, as follows: 

Nalional Zoolofiical Park, Smith no )ii(iii I)istiti(tioi) : 

Coutiuuiiiii the constructiDii of lojids, wnlks, ln-i(l.<;'es, water supply, soweni-j^o, iiiid

of the United States JSenale. 



36 KErOllT OF THE SECRETARY. 

Smithsonian Institution, 

Washington, April 3, lf<93. 

Sir : In accordauce with the instruction of the Eegents of the Sinith- 
soiiian Institution, I have the honor to transmit a resohition passed by 
them on the 29th of March, 1892, together witli the foHowing prelim- 
inary statement of the considerations on which it is based : 

The National Zoological Park was placed under the Regents of the 
Smithsonian Institution by the act of April 30, 1890, to l)e administered 
by them, first " for the advancement of science " and, second, " for the 
instruction and recreation of i)eople. " 

The necessity of protecting the unexpectedly large crowd of people 
that have been attracted to the Park and of i)roviding for their access 
to the animals, as well as for the protection of the latter, has made it 
necessary to assign to this secondary object a disproportionate share of 
the approi)riations, and it seems unavoidable that this subordinate 
feature should thus claim the larger portion of the expenses, as long as 
the collections are open to the iwblic, as in ordinary zoological gardens. 

The appropriations for the fiscal year 1891-92 were nuule under three 
heads: Improvements aiul care of grounds, $15,000; buildings, $18,000, 
and maintenance, $17,500, these amounts being about one-half those 
that were submitted to Congress as nectessaryto make preliminary pro- 
vision for the security and accessibility of the collections and to ad- 
minister their trust Avith safety to the public. 

The Eegents recognized the impossibility of doing this with such 
means; but, considering that the animals were already in the Park, in 
view of this public safety, and regarding the act as mandatory upon 
them, they, with the aid of a balance, economized, in anticipation from 
the original apj^ropriation made for the organization of the Park, and 
a deficiency item of $1,000, to meet urgent needs, have endeavored to 
get through the year until relief could be had from Congress. In doing 
so they have been obliged to reduce the number of watchmen and em- 
ployes of the Park in every grade till the iiublic safety threatens to be 
endangered, while yet a considerable part of these watchmen have been 
called on to labor continuously through Sundays and holidays ten to 
twelve hours a day without extra compensation, and have in other re- 
si)ects felt obliged to carry economy to a degree which would have been 
unjustifiable, except upon compulsion under such circumstances. 

They would, in their oj^inion, have been unable to administer the 
Park to the close of the fiscal year, even under these conditions, had 
they not, in view of the emergency, also given without charge the 
services of officials and employes paid from the private Smithsonian 
fund. The total expenditure for maintenance during the current year 
may, under these conditions, be expected to be $23,000. These facts 
were represented by them through the Secretary of the Institution in a 
letter dated January 23, 1892, to the Secretary of the Treasury (a copy 
of which is a])pended) and by him transmitted to Congress. 

For the year 1892-93 the following estimates were sent to the Treas- 
ury Department: Improvements, $20,000; buildings, $27,000, and 
maintenance, $26,000. 

In the sundry civil bill (H. K. 7520) as now reported to the House 
of Re])resentatives, there is ai)propriated for improvements $9,000, 
for buildings $10,000, and for maintenance, $10,000; in all $29,000. If 
the Kegents considered, as they must, $9,000 as inadequate for a year's 
e\])enditure in laying out the roads and grounds in a new park of 107 
acres, they yet would not have felt compelled to make this present rej)- 
reseutation, since such improvements may await the action of a future

of tlio nuiuiuls must hv pvovulvd for witliout delay, while under "main- 
tenance" come not only their food and warmth, but the ])rotectlon of 
theimblic; and that in tlu'case of animals, which are helpless to ])rovide 
tor themselves and dangerous if not liuardiMl, can not wait future action, 
has been a pressin<i' consideration to tiuMn. 

The lie<ients think it pro])er to remark that the roads of the i)ark in 
the vicinity of the caj^es have bi'en crowded with visitors, to the num- 
ber of as many as 10, ()()() in a day, l)efore there was time to juake any 
means for the permanent care of the animals, or pro\ ide proper roads 
to get to them, even had the means for these been api)ropriated, and 
that there is, in their Judginent, e\ery reason to expect during the com- 
ing summer the visit of still larger throngs, composed n(»t only of adults, 
but of children. 

The Kegents feel desirous to represent that they can not be held re- 
s])onsiblelbr the imnn'nent danger which nuist result, ujuler the contem- 
jilated withdrawal even of these means for })rotection which exi)erience 
lias already shown to be absolutely insufficient. They Avould also ask 
attention to the fact that small as the a])propriation is, it is in several 
items, and that under no emergency is any discretion allowed them as 
to their relative amounts, although the whole matter of exi)enditure is 
here for a novel puri^ose, on which only experience could decide the 
relative exigency of each part. 

if Congress intended tliat the park must be maintained on the ap- 
l)ro])riation under which the liegents have been unable to administer it 
t lie last year (improvemeut, $ir),0(>(); buildings, 8l'S,0U0; maintenance, 
><17,r)()0), they deem it reasonable to bring the attention of Congress to 
the fact that a discretion might pro[)erly be exercised by them as to what 
])ro})ortion they should ap]>ly to the imminent needs of the ])ublic safety 
and what to matters of less urgency, aiul that they should either be 
allowed to exjiend on tlie part upon which the safety of the public and 
the existence of the animals especially depends, that which their ex- 
])erience has sliown to be indispensable, or that they should be relieved 
of responsibility for the conse(]uences. 

They .desire to add in further explanation that they do not sni)p()se 
that with the total ap]»ropriation of $r)(),0()0, of which .si*(i,(>(K) is for 
''maintenance'' (mentioned in the resolution), the park can be i»ro]ierly 
conducted, and that they beli«^ve this sum to be in fact inade(iuate for 
such (conduct, their intent being to state to Congress the sum below, 
which, according to their experience, it is im])ossible to undertake that 
the i)ark shall be carried on another year, tliough not credital)l.\', yet 
without most ])robab]e danger.

in relation to the estimates on page 281 of the JSook of Estimates, for the fiscal year

Smithsoxiax Ixstitutiox, 
Wd.ihuti/ioti, J). ('., JcDi liar 11 :.'■'), 1S92. 

Sir : I beg leave to invite your attention to the estimates under the Smithsonian 
Institution for the fiscal year ending .lune 30, 1893, duly submitted to you October 
7, 1891, and to the modified form in ^vhich these estimates were transmitted to Con- 
gress, whereby it would seem to be recommended that no increase Tie made over the 
amounts a])propriated for the current year. 

Whilu feeling that all the amounts asked for by the Institution have lieen only 
such as are adequate with tlu' strictest economy, I have to ask your special atten- 
tion to the three items for the National Zo(>logical Park, /. c, improA^ements, build- 
ings, and maintenance. Disasters from Hoods and like contingencies, for which no 
])rovision was made by Congress in the appropriations t(n' the present year, enqdui- 
size the necessity of securing the full amount estimated uiuler the headings Improve- 
ments and Buildings, while there exists exceptional necessity in the item for 
maintenance, which is essentially for the food and care of living animals. 

The appropriations made by the act of March 3, 1891, for "maintenance" during 
the present tiscal year (f(u- which $35,000 Avas asked), was $17,500, but the sum of 
$5,122.71 from the appropriation of April 30, 1890, was available and has be<Mi used 
for this pnri)osc; and even with this addition it has been necessary to ask for a defi- 
ciency appropriation of $4,434, chieliy to cover expenditures which were found to be 
absolutely necessary to prevent loss to the (lovernmeut. 

The minimum expenditures for the present year under this item will therefore be 
$22,622.71; the expenses for the first six numths being $14,269.73, or at the rate of 
$28,539.46 i>er annum. I trust, therefore, that it is made sufficiently dear that with 
an a])]tropriation of$l7,500 it Avill beimpossible to properly care for and feed the an- 
imals now on hand. 

Th<^ past expenditures would have been still larger but that the work on the ac- 
counts for the Ti'easnry has in part been done gratuitously by the Institution, which 
has also snit])li(^(l free of cost office rooms, as well as the aid and supervision of un- 
paid naturalists. This can not be reckoned upon for the future, lint has been sanc- 
tioned by the Regents as a means to meet the exigency until the need of a larger ap- 
propriation can be represented to Congress, and in the meantime the working force 
has been reduced to an extreme degree, the iiolicing, for instance, being now done by 
one watchman, aided by two employes who are largely engaged with other duties; 
and these three men are reijuired to maintain order over au area of 167 acres, visited, 
during each day^ by thousands of peo]>le. These details are mentioned in connection 
with the fact that (unless some small juirchases of animals made at the outset lie 
excepted) it is under like stringencies of economy in every branck of the adminis- 
tration, that the exjienses have already amounted, as shown above, to more than 
$14,000 in six months. 

I can not too emphatically represent the peculiar difficulties that mrist arise in 
administering an insufficient approi>riation I'or the care of living wild animals, un- 
able to care for themselves where they are, if no provision has been made by Con- 
gress for disposing of them elsewhere. 

In view of increased expenses since the estimates were prepared, due directly to 
the unexpectedly great popular interest manifested in the park, and to the extraor- 
dinary increase of visitors, I now feel compelhMl eitlu'r to increase the estimate for 
maintenance to $30,000, to cover further contingencies, or to ask that the total ap- 
propriation requeste<l for the jiark be made in such form as to allow a certain discre- 
tionary power to meet them. If, under the circumstances stated, the latter would, 
in your judgment, be the more advisable course, I would resjjectfully ask that yon 
recommend to Congress that the three items of improvements ($20,000), building 
($27,000), and maintenance ($26,000) be appropriated in one sum of $73,000, as fol- 
lows:

The Coimaittec on Appropiiatioiisof tlie United States kSeiuite linally 
recommended tliat tlie sum allowed by the House for the Park bo raised 
to "^To.OlK), and that the amount be ;t])pi'oi)riate(l in one item, that is to 
say, without assigning- special sums to s])ecial subordinate heads. 

In the conference committee ui)on the sundry civil bill the amonnt 
recommended l)y the Senate was reduced to >*")(). 000, bnt the embarrass- 
ment of s])ecial snblieads of ai»]>ro})riation was removed. The bill was 
linally passed* in the following terms. 

National Zoiilogical Park: For continuing the construction of roads- 
walks, bridges, water siii)])ly, sewerage, and drainage; and for grading, 
planting, and otherwise improving th« grounds; erecting and rei>air, 
ing buildings and inclosures for animals; and for administrative pur- 
poses, care, subsistence, and transportation of animals, iiu'luding sala- 
ries or compensation of all necessary employes, and general incidental 
expenses not otherwise ])rovided for, tifty thousand dollars, one-half of 
which sum shall Ix^paid from the revenues of the District of Columl)ia 
and the other half iiom the Treasury of the United States; and a le- 
port in detail of the e\])enses on account of the National Zoological 
Park shall be made to Congress at the beginning of each regular ses- 
sion. 

Worix (drccuJi) done. — Notwithstanding a compulsory waste of means 
caused by the fact that insufticient appropriations made it necessary 
to do certain urgent Avork provisionally and imperfectly, it is believed 
that results have been attained at a smaller expense than is usual in 
establishments of the same nature elsewhere. The following table 
shows the cost of the princii)al works i)roj(ict(Ml up to June .'iO, 1892, 

In elucidation of these statements, the ])lans and <lra wings of a 
])ortion of the work given (on a necessarily small scab' in the text) may

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 



The area occupied by tlie buildings and iiiclosiires for animals in the 
Park is not far from 40 acres. 

Work for the next fiscal year. — The limited amount appropriated by 
Coug-ress will not permit a rapid development of the Park. Kearly 
$30,000 of the sum allowed will be required for the feeding and care 
of the animals and the maintenance of the necessary staif of employes. 
Tlie remainder will be applied to carrying out the plans already de- 
vised; that is to say, to completing the structures yet unfinished, 
making secure the inclosures and building additional quarters where 
necessary, in strengthening the banks of tlie ci-eek agaiust erosion, in 
completing the ponds for aquatic animals, in extending somewhat the 
water supply, sewerage, and drainage, and in grading and <lressing 
the roads and slopes. 




Pl-ATE v.— House for Bison and Elk. 

There is an urgent need for a better structure for the elephants than 
the temporary barn which was hastily erected for their accommodation 
and which they have ever since occupied. It is calculated that a com- 
plete building suitable for the accommodation of elephants and other 
animals of the same general habits and needs would cost about $15,000. 
Only a portion of this sum need be appropriated for the present, as the 
house could be built upon a plan that admits of enlargement. 

Access to the 2Hirl:—T\ie. Rock Creek Bail way Company intend, as I 
understand, to carry a branch of their road directly to the Ontario 
avenue entrance to the park and to transfer passengers from all the 
city street-car lines without extra charge. In that case there is no 
doubt that the number of visitors will be greatly increased. The widen- 
ing and improvement of Quarry road and the extension of Kenesaw

Additious to the collections. — Tlie collection is now addc*] to only 
tlirougli <>it'ts made by i)nl)lic-spiritedcitizensa!i(l liie soinewiiat linnted 
accessions derived from the Yellowstone Park. As before meiitii»ne(l, 
lack of fuuds lias preveuted any notable increase from these sources. 
It is decreased by the inevitable d<'aths which the experience ol' older 
zo()l()gical gardens shows will not be less than from LM) to .'>() per cent 
annually. 

Accessions from the Yellowstone Park are iisnally limited to a. very 
nari'ow range of specimens and can not be deiK'iided on for j)roducliig 
a really valuable and characteristic collection oi" the North American 
fauna. Under the terms of the first appropriation act it was allow- 
able to [)rocure by purchase "rare specimens nototherwise attainable." 
This provision was nearly ineffective owing to the inadequate fund 
given, and it was omitted from the act passed at the recent session ot 
Congress. 

The total niind)er of animals in the park is 44.S <»!' which .'>4(> arc in- 
digenous to North America. Fifty-five of the animals were obtained 
by i)urchase. 

NECROLOGY. 

MONTGOMERY CUNNIiNCillAM MEIGS. 

Montgouiery Cunningham Meigs was a son of the eminent physician 
and medical autli(n\ Charles J). IVFeigs. He was born May .'i, ISK!, in 
Augusta, (ly.. and graduated from the United States Military Academy 
at West Point in 1S36. He was assij^iied first to the artillery service, 
and snbsequently to the Corps of Engineers. In 1852 he was directed 
to make a survey at Washington, T). C, with the view of determining 
the best plan for supplying the city with water. The ])lan proposed 
by him received the approval of the War Department and was adopt(;d 
by Congress, General Meigs, then a captain of engineers, being 
charged with its execution — a task that occupied his attention Un- a 
l»eriodof ten years, and which he complete<l with signal siu-ccss. During 
the prosecution of this important work Capt. Meigs was also placed in 
<'liarge. as supervising engineer, of the north and south extensions ol 
the Cai)itol, and of the construction of its crowning iron dome, as well 
as ot the noithcrn extension of the General Post-Oflicc Uiiilding. 

lie ser\ed with eminent distinction throughout the war of the re- 
bellion, leaching the rank of brigadier-general in chargeof the (^)iiarter- 
niaster's Department. The place s(mght him not only for liis high in- 
tegrity and acknowledged cai)acity for business, but on account of the 
strength of his personal character. In 1S(!1 he received the well earned 
title of brevet major general in the xVrmy. 



46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

With the close of the war ends the most active period of his life, 
and begins the gentle course of an honored old age, devoted among 
other occupations to tlie advancement of the best interests of this In- 
stitution. He was a member of the ]S"ational Academy of Sciences and 
one of the fonnders of the Philosophical Society of Washington. He 
was appointed by a joint resolution of Congress in 1885 a Regent of the 
Smithsonian Institution, and from his entrance into the Board became 
an active member of its executive committee, which positions he tilled 
until his death, which occurred at his residence in this city on the 2d 
of January, 1892, 

Of Gen, Meigs as a man alike in external or in moral aspects, one 
cau only speak in terms of respect. Personally, he will be remem- 
bered by all, even until his very last days, as erect in carriage, with a 
soldierly bearing which did not recognize the lapse of years, and a 
manner both dignified and engaging. In character he was not only 
conscientious and sagacious, but firm at a time when tirmness tried 
every quality of a man. What more can be added when we have said 
that he was a nnm faithful in all things, who has left behind him a repu- 
tation both high and enduring? 

NOAH PORTER. 

Noah Porter was born in Farmington, Conn., December II, 1811, and 
graduated at Yale College in 1831, During a tutorship in Yale in 1833- 
1835, he devoted himself Jto the study of theology. He was appointed pro- 
fessor of moral philosophy and metaphysics at Yale in 1846. In 1871 
he was called to the presidency of Yale, which post he resigned in 1880. 
During President Porter's administration the progress of the college 
Avas marked. As a teacher, and in his personal relations with the 
students, he was one of its most popular presidents. He received the 
degree of D. D. from the University of the city of New York in 1858, 
and that of LL. D. from Edinburgh in 188G. His writings cover a wide 
range of subjects, but are mainly philosophical. He was one of the 
most scholarly metaphysicians this country has produced. His con- 
nection with the Smithsonian Institution began January 20, 1878, 
when he was elected to the Board of Regents by a joint resolution of 
Congress, as a citizen of Connecticut, and this connection terminated 
with his resignation December 31, 1889, on account of failing health. 

His death occurred on March 4, 1892, in the eightieth .\ear of his age. 
President Dwight said of him in an address delivered at his funeral: 

He was strong in the native force of his mind, (luick in liis mental 
action, keen in his insight, ttrm in his grasp of truth, )ich in his think- 
ing, but most of all, wide in his reach. His eye kindled with enthusi- 
asm as he saw the lirst opening of new ideas. His face beamed with 
joy as he gained new measuies of knowledge. The field of truth was 
full of attractiveness for him, and he was glad to enter it by any path- 
way. He has been in the brotherhood of scholars a man of mark and of

The tiekl work of the year Is divided into (1) an^hajology and (2) general held 
studies, the latter being directed chiefly to religion, technology, and linguisties. 

Archd'oliujical field work. — The explorations of the Bureau for the last fiscal year 
wer<! eonf inued under the personal supervision of Mr. W. II. Holmes, with Messrs. 
Cosmos Mindeleff, (ierard Fowke, and William Dinwiddle as assistants. 

The worlc begun in the tide-water regions of Maryland and Virginia in the sjiring 
of 1891 was continued throughout the present year. Careful attention was given 
to the examination and mapping of the shell deposits of the Lower Potonuxc and the 
Ciiesapeake, ami many of the historic village sites visited by John Smith and his 
;issoeiates were identified and examined. Tlie renuiins ni)on tliese sift^s i\n; idtmtical 
with those of the many otiier village sites of tlu^ region. Mr. Holmes studied the 
;ir('lueology of South, West, and Khod*; riviu-s and of the shonssof tlie bay above and 
below Annapolis. The middle Patux<'nt was visited and the site of tiie ancient vil- 
lage of Mattpanient idontitied and examined. Tin^ valley of the Happahannock in 
the vicinity of Fredericksburg and a number of the othtu- western tributaries of the 
Potomac received attiMition. Ancient soapstone (juarricis, one in Fairfax (bounty, 
Va., three in Montgomery County, Md., and one in Howard County, Md., were 
studied, and collections of the (luarry rejecrs and imi>lements used in (|uai'rying and 
<-utting the stone were obtained. 

In .Inly Mr. Holmes made a trij) to Ohio to assist in the resurvey of sev«^ral geo- 
inotrii; earthworks at N(!wark and near Chillicothe. A visit was made, to the great

5() REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

When the work of le-suiveyiiig th<' earthAvoiks at Newark and Cliillieotlie was 
finislied, Mr. Holmes made a journey into Indian Territory to examine an ancient 
qnarry formerly su])posed to be a Spanish silver mine. It was reported by Mr. AVal- 
ter P. Jeuuey, of the Geological Survey, that this was reallj'' an Indian flint quarry, 
and the visit of Mr. Holmes confirmed this conclusion. Seven miles northwest of 
Seneca, Mo., and 2 or 3 miles west of the Indian Territory line there are numer- 
ous outcrops of massive whitish chert, and in x^laces this rock has been exten- 
sively worked for the purpose of securing flakable material for the manufacture of 
implements. The pits and trenches cover an area of about 10 acres. They are 
neither as deep nor as numerous as the Flint Ridge quarries. The product of this 
quarry was also the leaf-shaped blades of the usual tyjie, the size being greater than 
in the other similar ipnirries of the country as a result of the massive unflawed 
character of the stone. 

In May Mr. Holmes visited and examined a numbta- of extensive ([uarries of novac- 
ulite in Arkansas, one of which had been visited during the previous year. A great 
(juarry situated upon the summit of a long mountainous ridge at the head of Cove 
Creek is the most extensive yet discovered in this country. The ancient excavations 
extend along the crest of the ridge for several miles. The largest jiits are still 2o 
feet deep and upwards of 100 feet in diameter. The product, of this ciuarry was also 
leaf-shaped blades of the type obtained from the other tjuarries, and closely aualiv 
gous in size, shape, and appearance to those of Flint Ridge, Ohio. Mr. Holmes next 
passed north into Stone County, Mo., to visit a very lai'ge cave situated about 
20 miles southeast of Helena, the county seat. Neither human remains nor works 
of native art were found within the cave. The manufacture of chert implements 
had been carried on extensively in the surroumling region. From Stone County he 
went to southwest Minnesota, and spent ten days in the study of the red ]ti)>estone 
quarry so famous in the hist(n-y of the Coteau des Prairies. Evidence of the pre- 
historic operation of this quarry was found in the series of ancient pits extending 
across the prairie for nearly a mile in n narrow belt and following the outcrop of 
the thin layer of i)ipc8toue. 

The ancient copper mines of Isle Royale, Lake Superior, were next visited and 
mapped, and extensive collections of stone hammers were obtained from the very 
numerous pits and trenches. 

Mr. Holmes then went west to Little Falls, Minn., to examine the locality from 
which certain flaked ([uartz objects, supposed to be of paleolithic age had been 
obtained. It was found that these bits of quartz were the refuse of the manufacture 
of blades of cjuartz by the aborigines and at a period not necessarily more remote 
than the period of quarry working already described. 

Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff, early in July, 1891, closed the field work on the Rio Verde, 
in Arizona, an account of which was given in the last annual report, and returned to 
Washington, after which time lu' was engaged for the remainder of the fiscal year in 
office work. 

Mr. Gerard Fowke completed the exploration of the .Tames River and its northern 
tributaries, making interesting discoveries in Botetourt, Bath, Alleghany, and High- 
land counties. He then began an examination of the prehistoric remains of the 
Shenandoah Valley, remaining in the field until December. Later he examined the 
islands and coast between the Savannah and St. Johns rivers, locating mounds and 
shell heaps. In the s])ring he resumed w^ork in the Shenandoah Valley, making a 
careful and thorough investigation of every county. The results show that this re- 
gion was not the seat of any permanent occupation by the aborigines, though it 
seems to have been a place of resort for hunters in lai'ge numbers. 

Mr. William Dinwiddle was engaged during the year in mapping and examining 
the shell banks and other aboriginal remains of the PotimKic-Chesapeake region. 

As Prof. Cyrus Thonuis was engaged most of his time during the year in necessary 
office work, his field work was limited. Finding it desirable that more accurate

should lie obtaiiietl, lie euijngcd Mr. I". W. \Vrij;lit to iiiaki^ a careful survey and 
measurement of tlieni. As the result showed that they were of unusual inii)ortan(e 
oil account of their peculiiir character as compared with other ancient works of tin' 
same section, I'rof. Thomas thought it necessary to maki^ a personal examination of 
them, and did so. During the sam(> trip lie examined certain important monuds in 
Illinois, among which was tlie noted ••Cahokia" or "Monk's Mound," of Madison 
County, His object in tliis case was to asceiiaiu the present contlition of this re- 
markahh^ monumeut, and to investigate cert-am other jioints in r<datioii to which 
s;ttisfact<uy conclusions could he reaclnnl only by personal insjieclion. 

He also made during the summer aiuitlier examination of the Newark works and 
I'ort Ancient, in Ohio, iu order to settle some [loints which previous reports had 
overlooked. At his suggestiou the director had a icsnrvey made, under Mr. (Jaiinett's 
direction, of the four most noted circh^s of the Ohio works, tlie ]dane table being 
used to show their exact form as tlu^y at present appear. 

ilr. 1'. II, Cushing, during the summer and autumn numths ot' 1S!»1, made some ex- 
aminations on the shores of Lake Erie, near Butfalo, and of Lake ( Mitario iu Orleans 
County. \. v.. where he discovered pbttery of the well-known net-impressed lacust- 
rine or littoral type, and also, at the former point, some pits or slightly indurated 
cavities in the sand, which ho considered to be connected with the manufacture of 
that pottery. By experiments made without the aid of modern appliances of any 
kind he diiplicate<l the ancient, specimens found in the vicinity and show'cil tiiat 
these pits, lined with ordinary tishing nets, had actually been used simply and 
etfectivcdy for shaping ])ottery. fie has ]>repared an illustrated report giving the 
details on the subject. 

(iciirral field .siudieN. — In August, 1891, Mrs. Matilda C. Stevenson resumed her in- 
vestigations into the mythology, religion, and sociology of tlie Zuhi Indians, mak- 
ing careful study ol' the shrine worship, which constitutes such an important feature 
in the religion of those people. She added to the already valuable collection of 
photograjihs and sketches of their sanctuaries, made in previous years liy Mr. James 
Stevenson, and by the aid of the war priest of Zuni, secured from the tribe some 
interesting objects. 

Through the intluence of the war priest, the priest of the Ka-ka and thenrgists of 
the "medicine societies," Mrs. Stevenson was able to be presc^nt at Zuni cere- 
monials almost continuously fi'om the time of her airivalto her dej)arture in March. 

Dr. W. J. Hoffman proceeded early in August to the Menomonoe Jieservation, Wis- 
consin, in respons(> to an invitation from the Mitawok or chiefs of tln^ Mitavvit (or 
"Grand Medicine Society") of the Menomonee Indians, to observe the ritualistic cere- 
monies and order of initiation of a new candidate for membership, for comparison 
with similar ceremonials of other Algonquian tribes. In addition to the mythologic 
material collected at this attendance, he also secured much valuable information re- 
lating to the primitive customs and usages of the Mciuomonce for use in the ))r(!para- 
tion of a monograph upon that ])eople. Specimens of their workmanship were alsti 
collected. 

As he had been appointed a special agent for makingetlmologic collections lor the 
(•xhibit to 1)0 made by the Bureau of Kthnology* at the World's Columbian Exposi- 
tion, he secured a collection of .Menomonee mateiial, as well as a number ol" <lesired 
objects at White Earth R(\servation, Minnesota. In May, 1892. he visited the Crow 
Agency. Mont., to procun- a coUecttion of articles to illustrate the industries and 
workmanship of the Crow In<lians. It was specially desirable to obtain .some of the 
elaborate <dothiug for which tlm tribe is remarkable. A uni(|ne series of articles was 
obtain(;d, after which a visit was made to the isolated bandof Ojil)wa at Leech Lake, 
Minn, to c(dlect various specimens desired to complete the collection illustrating 
early ()jil)wa history. 

On his return, Dr. Hotfman ag.iiu stopped al, i lie MtMiomonee h'eservation to make 



52 EEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

tinal collections of ethnologic material and to complete his studies of the ritual and 
initiatory ceremonies of the Grand Medicine Society, a meeting of which body had 
been called for this special purpose. He returned to Washington in June, 1892. 

Mr. James Mooney, during the held months of the fiscal year, continued the col- 
h?ctiou for an exhibit at the World's Columbian Exposition, of objects to illustrate 
the daily life, arts, dress, and ceremonies of the Kiowa in the southeastern part of the 
Indian Territory. That tribe was selected as continuing in its primitive condition 
more perfectly than any other which could be examined with profit. He succeeded 
in making a tribal collection which is practically complete, including almost every 
article in use among the Kiowas for domestic uses, and for war, ceremony, amuse- 
ment, or dress. A number of illustrating photogrnphs were also obtained. On his 
return in August this collection was labeled and arranged in cases ready for trans- 
portation to Chicago on the opening of the Exposition, and by means of the photo- 
grajjhs and costumes obtained several groups of life-size figures were prepared to 
show characteristic scenes in Indian life. 

In November he again set forth to obtain additional information upon the ghost 
dance, especially among the principal tribes not before visited. After a short stay 
in Nebraska with the Omahas and W' innebagoes, neither of whom, as it was found, 
had taken any prominent x>art in the dance, he went to the Sioux at Pine Ridge 
Agency, S. Dak., the chief seat of the late outbreak, where he collected a largo 
number of songs of the dance and much miscellaneous information on the sub- 
ject. From there he went to the Piiites in Nevada, among whom the Messiah and 
originator of the ghost dance resides. Here he obtained the statement of the doc- 
trine from the lii)s of the Messiah himself, took his portrait, the only one ever taken, 
and obtained a number of dance songs in the Piute language. He then returned to 
the Cheyennes and Arapahoes in the Indian Territory, among whom he had l)egun 
the study of the dance, and obtained from them the original hotter which the Mes- 
siah had given them, containing the authentic statement of his doctrine and the 
manner in which they were to observe the ceremonial. He returned to Washington 
in February. 

In May he again started out to gather additional ethnologic material, especially 
with regard to the Kiowas, and to obtain further collections for the World's Co- 
umbian Exposition. Going first to the Sioux, he proceeded next to the Shoshones 
and Northern Arai)ahoes, in Wyoming, and then turned south to the Kiowas, in the 
Indian Territory, where he was still at work at the close of the fiscal year. 

Mr. H. W. Heushaw, on May 14, 1892, proceeded to New Mexico and California 
for the ])nrposo of pursuing certain linguistic investigations and to make collections 
for the World's Columbian Exposition. This duty was continued until the close of 
the fiscal year. 

Rev. J. Owen Dorsey, from January 14 to February 21, 1892, made a trip to Le- 
compte, Rapides Parish, La., for the purpose of gaining information from the sur- 
vivors of the Biloxi tribe. He found only one person, an aged woman, who spoke 
the language in its purity, and two others, a man and his wife (the latter the 
daughter of the old woman), whose dialect contains numerous modifications of the 
ancient language. From these three persons he obtained several myths and other 
texts in the Biloxi language, material for a Biloxi-English dictionary, local names, 
personal names, names of clans, kinship terms, lists of flora and fauna, with their 
Biloxi names, and grammatical notes. Ho filled many of the schedules of a coi»y of 
the second edition of " Powell's Introduction to the Study of Indian Languages" 
(English-Biloxi in this instance). He brought to Washington a few botanical speci- 
mens, for which he had gained the Biloxi names, in order to obtain their scientific 
names from the botanists of the Smithsonian Institution. He photographed three 
Biloxi men and two women, all that could bo found. There were about seven other 
Biloxi residing in the pine forest 6 or 7 miles from Lecompte, but they would not 
be interviewed. The Biloxi language contains many words which resemble their

Mr. Alhert S. (iaischcl, ha\'ing met witli little success in his ]>re\ious attempt, in 
1X81, to study the Wi(diita, language in the lield, continued to watidi for better o])]»or-

54 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

Much of lii.s time, during the year was einph)yeil iu writiug the flual pages of the 
report on the field work and explorations which for several years had heen in his 
chai'ge, and in adapting it to a change in the form and manner of its ]>ul>licati(m 
which had heen made necessary. This involved the re-writing of many pages and 
a material condensation of the introductory portion relating to the distributit)u of 
types of mounds. It was completed by the close of the fiscal year and filed for ])m1)- 
lication, nearly all the illustrations having been drawn and ])repared for engva\ - 
ing. 

He devoted all his spare time to the study of the Maya Codices and iu the prepa- 
ration of a report of the discoveries he made therein. One of these, which is deemed 
of much interest and importance, is that, when the Dresden Codex, which is consid- 
ered the most ancient of those known, was written, the year consisted of 365 days, 
and that the calendar was arranged precisely as it was foixnd to be by the Spanish 
con([uerors. But his most important discovery was made during the closing days 
of the year. This consisted in what may be termed the discovery of the key to the 
signification of the hieroglyphic characters of the Codices by which it is probable 
that the inscriptions may ultimately be read. This discovery, which the tests so 
far applied appear to confirm, consists, first, in the evidence that the characters as a 
rule are phonetic and, second, in ascertaining the signification of a sufficient number 
to form a basis for the interpretation of the rest. If this discovery proves to be 
what, from the evidence presented, it appears to be, it Avill be of incalculable im- 
portance to American archaeology. 

Early in the year the Avork of Mr. Cosmos Miudeleff commenced in repairing and 
securing the preservation of the Casa Grande ruin. This work was ordered by act 
of Congress and plans had been prepared by Mr. Mindeleft" while in Arizona during 
the previous year. These plans provided for the excaA'^atiou of the interior of the ruin, 
the underpinning of the walls w^ith brick and cement, the use of tie-beams to hold 
the walls in place and render them more solid, the restoration of the lintels over door 
and window openings, and the filling of the cavities above the lintels with brick 
and cement. The work was completed in November and was inspected and ac- 
cepted. Although all that was deemed necessary to preserve the riiin could not lie 
done with the appropriation provided, still it is believed that enough was done to 
preserve it in its present condition for many years. All the work done was directed 
to the preservation of the ruin, no attempt at restoration being made. In .tune, 
1892, the President, in accordance wdth the authority vested in him by Congress, 
reserved from settlement twelve quarter sections about the ruin, comprising an area 
of about 480 acres. A number of specimens obtained duriug the excavation were 
sliipped to Washington and deposited iu the National Mnseiim. 

Duriug a part of the year Mr. Mindeleft' was engaged iu the prej)aration of a 
report upon his field work of the previous year. This report, entitled ''Aboriginal 
Remains in the Valley of the Rio Verde, Arizona," was completed and will appear iu 
the Twelfth Annual Report of the Bureau. Aside irom a comprehensive treatment of 
the ruins in the valley of the Verde the report will contain the first illustrations 
]iublished of ancient irrigating ditches, and the first comjirehensive data, including 
illustrations of cavate lodges. It is fully illustrated from photographs, plans, and 
surveys made by the author. .Subsequently lie rommenced a scientifii^ report on 
the Casa Grande ruin of Arizona. 

No new work was undertaken in the modelling room during the year, as the entire 
force was occupied upon the preparation of duplicates of models jireviously made, 
for use at the World's Columbian Exposition and elsewhere. Six models, in addi- 
tion to other material, were sent to Spain, to be exhiliited at the historical exposi- 
tion at Madrid. The series comprised models of the Puelilo of Znili, New Mexico, 
the Pueblo of Walpi, Arizona, Mummy Cave clilf rniu. Arizona, all of large size, and 
three smaller models of ruins.

was therefoic unai)l(^ to resume iironiiscd wi>ik (ui his (dder Zuni material for the 
Bureau until August, 1891, when he b(\gau the preparation of a contribution in- 
tended to a])pear in the Twelfth Anunal Report of the l^ureau, on the Zuni myths of 
creation and nugratiou as related to the, mythic drama-dance organization, or Jutku 
of the Znnis, and the so-called Cachina ceremonials of all Pneblo and other south- 
western tribes. Mr. Cnshing's discoveries as set forth in this essay contirni and 
substantiate the opinion held by the Director that all ])rimitive so-called dance cer- 
emonials are essentially dramatic, ami they go so far as to indicate also that all 
])rindtiv(^ ceremonials, of whatever initnre, are essentially dramaturgic, thns making 
his contribution of general as well as of special significance. 

In January, 1892, Mr. Cnshing again reported at Washingtcni and was regularly 
engaged as an ethnologist of the Uurean on tlu! Isr of February, and h;is since been 
occuitied iu elaborating his paper on the myths of the drama dances and on a 
study of manual concepts or the influence of jirimitive hand-usages on nuuital de- 
velopment in frhe culture growth of mankind. 

Mrs. Stevenson returned from the field w<uk befort^ mentioned iu March, 1892, and 
was einploye<l for tlie reimiinder, of the fiscal year in ])re]>aring her field notes for 
])ublicatiou. 

Mr. G(a-ard Fowke was engaged during December and January in i)re])aring a, re- 
])ort of the season's w<n"k by him in archieology, arranging and classifying the speci- 
mens pi'ocured, and end)odyiug in rejiorts. ])revionsly prepared, tlie results of recent 
discoveries. 

The office work of Dr. Hoffman consisted iu arranging the material gathered dur- 
ing the preceding field season ami in pre])aring for publication an account of the 
Midewiwin, or so-called ''Grand Medicine Society." of the Ojibwa Indians of AVhite 
Earth, Minnesota. This work, which forms (ure of the papers accompanying the 
Sc\enth Annual Report, (unbraces new material ami consists of the traditions of the 
Indian cosmogony and genesis of mankind, the "materia medica " of tli(> shamans, 
and the ritnalOf initiation, together with the musical notation of the chants and 
songs used. 

I Mning I lie winter and spring moidhs a delc.gat ion id' Meuomonce Indians from Wis- 
consin visited ^^'ashington and Dr. Hofiiuan freipieutly conversed with them to ob- 
tain information ex))lanatory of the less known ])racticcs of the Menomoncii ceremony 
(d' the Mitawit, or their "Grand Medicine Socitd.y," for the purpose of comparison 
with the ritual as observed ))y the Ojibwa. Iu addition a large nuiss of mythologies 
material was obtained, as well as texts in the Menomonee languagi!. 

On returning from the field iu August 1891, Mr. James Moouey spent about ton 
weeks in arranging his Kiowa collection for the World's Columbian Exposition, 
writing out a series of descriptive labels, and in copying all the more im]tortant 
<locinnents relating to the ''ghost dance" from the files of the Indian Ofiice and the 
War Dei)artmcnt. He then again went out into the field, as above stated, returning 
to Washington in I'eiuuary 1892. Alxmtthree months were then occnjiied in ar 
ranging the material thus obtained and in writing the ]»relimiiiary cha])((us of his 
report on the ghost dance. He al.so su])erinteuded the })ieparation, at the National 
Museum, of a number (d' grou]»s of life-size figures to accomjiaiiy the Kiowa collec- 
tion at the World's Fair. 

I.'ev. J. Owen Dorsey coutinued the arrangement of Kwa]>a texts with interlinear 
and free translations and critical notes. He revi.sed the proof of " Omaha and I'onka 



56 REPORT OF THE fiEORETAEY. 

Letters," a Ijullet ill prepaied from () eg ilia texts collected liy Tiiinself. He fiiiisbed 
the eollatiou of all the Tntelo words recorded by Dr. Hale. Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt, and 
biiuself, with the result that he hnd 775 words in the Tuteh)-Euglisli dictionary. 
He furnished a list of several hundred linguistic and sociologic questions to be used 
among Indian tribes, 'i'licse (jnestions were in addition to those contained in the 
second edition of l^twcil's Introduction to the Study of Indian Languages and were 
based on original investigations made by Mr. Horsey among the Sionan tribes. He 
prepared for pnblication the following articles: Siouan Onomatopes (sonnd-roots), 
illustrated by charts; The Social Oroanization of Siouan Tribes, illustrated by fig- 
ures consisting chiefly of material gained by himself from the Dakota tribes, the 
Omaha, Ponka, Kwapa, Osage, Kansa, lov.a, Oto, Missouri, Winnebago, and Tntelo ; 
Nanibozhu in Sionan j\Iythology; Games of Teton Dakota Children (translated and 
arranged from the original Teton manuscript in the Bnshotter <'ollection of the 
Bureau of Ethnology). 

After his return i'roni Louisiana he devoted most of his time to the arrangement of 
the material collected in his Biloxi note-books. He prepared a Biloxi-English dic- 
tionary of 3,183 words on about 7,000 slips in alphabetic order. He arranged the 
Biloxi texts for publication, adding to the myths (with their interlinear and free 
English translations and critical notes) a list of several hundred Biloxi phrases. 
In his article on the Biloxi kinship system, he gave 53 kinship groups, of which 
number only 27 have their counterparts in the Dakota, (f'egiha, and other Siouan 
languages of the Missouri valley. The elaboration of all the Biloxi material could 
not be completed by June 30, 1892. 

Mr. Alberl S. Gatschet assisted in augmenting and improving the data for the 
Tribal Synonymy now in preparation, by extracting material from a number of 
books and original reports especially referring to southern and southwestern In- 
dians. His main AV(n-k during the year was directed towards extracting and arrang- 
ing some of the more extensive vocabularies made by him previously in the field. 
After completing the Tonkawe of Texas, he caided each word of the Shawano and 
Creek languages obtained by him, copied the historical and legendary texts of both, 
and extracted the lexical and grammatic elements from them to serve as the ground- 
work for future grammars. The remains of the Virginia or Powhatan languages 
that are known were also made accessible by carding the terms. 

During the fiscal year Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt was a part of the time engaged in careful 
study of the grammatic forms of the Iroquoian languages, especially in the ascer- 
tainment of the number and order in which the aftixes maybe used with one and 
the same stem or base. He was also engaged in translating, extracting, and trans- 
ferring to library cards, from the "Decouvcrtes et Etablissements des Franfais dans 
I'Amerique seiitentrionale," by Pierre Margry, matter relating to the manners, cus- 
toms, beliefs, rights, ceremonies, and history of the Iroquois, which matter is now 
placed on about 20,000 cards. 

He continued his work on the Tnscarora Dictionary and directed attention to de- 
velo])ing the full number of ordinary sentences in which every generic noun may 
be employed, which affords a measure of the capacity of the vocabulary ibr the ex- 
pression of thought. 

Mr. James C. Pilling continued bis bibliographic work throughout the year, with 
special attention to the Athapascan family. Work upon this fanuly was begun 
early in the fiscal year, on October 13 the maniiscript was sent to the printer, and 
at the close of the year but a few pages of the linal proofs remained unread. The 
Bibliography of the Athapascan Languages forms a pamphlet of xiii-|-125 pages. 
While this volume was being put in type Mr. Pilling began the collection of mate- 
rial for a number of bibliographies relating to the languages of the northwest coast 
of Ameri<'a — the Chinookaii, Salishaii, and Wakashan, and satisfactory i)rogress has - 
been made. Probably one or more of them will beready to send to the printer dnr-

EXPENSES. 

The expenses of the exchange bureau are met iu part by direct appropriation by 
Congress and in part by appropriations made to Government Departments or 
Bureaus, either in their contingent funds or iu specified terms for repayment to the 
Smithsonian Institution of a portion of the cost of transportation. In 1878 the 
Board of Regents established a charge of 5 cents per pound weight for the publica- 
tions sent out or received by the various Government bureaus, this charge being 
necessary to prevent an undue tax upon the resources of the Institution, as the ap- 
propriations made l)y Congress have never been sutiicient to meet the entire cost of 
the service. For similar reasons it has been found necessary to make a charge of 
the same amount to State institutions, and from these a further small sum has been 
received. 

The appropriation made by Congress for the fiscal year 1891-'92 was in the follow- 
ing terms : 

For expenses of the system of international exchanges between the United States 
.'ind foreign countries, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, including 
salaries or compensation of all necessary employees, seventeen thousand dollars. 

The receipts and disbursements by the accounting officer of the Smithsonian 
Institution on account of international exchanges, under date of July 1, 1892, and 
covering the fiscal year immediately preceding, were as follows :

TIk^ forc^oiiiil lahli' shows tluit. the entirti iiinouiit received from (Joveriiiiieiit bu- 
reau and others was !t^2, i:^!>. IJ), making the sum practically available for the siM^cilic 
l>iii"itosc of exc!ian<>esti<l!l, I39.1i), while the expenst'shave amounted to $20,310.4}*, (he 
dehciency of $1,171.30 Ixdng made uj) from tiie, Smithsonian fund. 

The advantages iuive been pointed out in previous rejiorts of combining in a single, 
item the various appropriations for the exchange service, now divided into comitar- 
ati\'ely small sums among the several larger appropriation bills of the Government, 
l)iit tlu^ matter seems to be of sufficient importance to call attention to it again in 
liiis place. 

For the year INItl-'iH' an estimate for the entire exi)euH<! of the service of $23, ()()() 
was submitted, this sum being intended to include these smaller amounts alluded to, 
and also an item of $2,000 to cover the expense of an inunediate exchange of parlia- 
iiientary documents with the countries entering into the treaty of Brussels in 18!S6. 
The amount appropriated was $17,000, the same as that for the preceding year. 

COHKESPONDEXCK. 

The name of eacii person or institution sending or receiving i)ublieations through 
tiie exchange bureau was heretofore entered upon a large ledger card, showing all 
such packages received or sent. This system has proved itself of great convenience, 
but with the large increase in the number of cards the space occupied has become 
of serious moment, and it was therefore found desirable to begin a new series of 
cards, of smaller size, entering in an abbreviated form the receipts from correspond- 
ents u])()n a blue card, while the packages forwarded to these correspondents are 
entered ui)0u a white card. This system was put in operation January 1, 1892, and 
during the six months succeeding, 9,808 cards of the new form have been prepared, 
representing tht^ number of correspondents Avith whom communication has been had 
during that period. There have been added to the list of corres])ondeuts during the 
year 1,834 names.

Tender the treaty allutled to in the Secretary's rejiort for 1887- "88, the exchange of 
the official publications of the United States Government with other governments 
has been continued by the Smithsonian Institution, and it now forms a very large 
proportion of the bureau's work. 

The entire numl)erof ]»uitli(:itions sent abroad during the year under (he provision 
of the act of Congress of .March 2, 18()7, aim of the treaty aljove referred to, was 
27,87.?, and there have been received in return 1,911 packages or Noiumes. The 
United States (government Departments ha\'t! forwarded to their cnrrespondents 
abroad 20,373 packages, ami liave received in rettirn 13,000 packages. The total 
numl)er of excliauges on Gov(^rumeTlt account has been 11,941 received ami 52.783

EPFICIKNCY OK THE SERVICE. 



It is, perhajis, desirable to rehearse brietiyhere the method of receiving and hand- 
ling exchange packages received by the Institution. 

iScientific societies and individuals in the United States desiring to forward their 
publications abroad send them to the Smithsonian Institution, where a record is 
kojit of the number of packages received, under the sender's name, and also a record 
showing each person or institution to which a copy of the work in question is trans- 
mitted. The books are then packed, with invoices from other senders, and for- 
warded by freight to tlie Government liureau abroad which has undertaken the 
task of distributing all exchange i)ackages in that country. The books are for- 
warded direct to the paid agents of the Institution, if in Great Britain or Germany,

hiircau of tin- United States or otlu'i- corrcsiioinients (d' tlus Institution eau not expect 
tinir jinldications to be deliver<Ml with t lie same pr(nuptness with whieli they may be 
sent by mail or by e\]ires,s. The transnussions are especially slow to foreign eountries 
with wliiili we haxc eomparati\<'ly iiifre(|neiit commnniiation. To Enghiinl and 
Germany, Avhere, as before stated, the agencies are nnder control aiwl jtay of the 
.Smithsonian Institution, and to France, cases are dispatched on the average about 
three times a month. 

S]iecial care is taken to insure the safe delixcry of the jiaekage to the pi'rson ad- 
dressed, and the easesof failure constitutes but a small percentage of the entire num- 
ber of packages handled. Souu) errors are incvital)le unless the gn/atest eare is ex- 
ercised by the .sender in securing the propei- aildicss of his correspondent.^. 

With each ])a.ekage sent out a receipt card is forwarded r(M|nesting acknowledg- 
ment tiiereon (d'the package; in (lutistion, and wiicn this receipt is placeel in the tiles 
of the exiduiiige office the record of that particular package is complete. 

Transmissions from abroad receivcnl Iiy freight in large cases arc; distrilmted in t he 
United States by registered mail, a record tirst having been made of the name of the 
sender and of the recipient of each package. A recei[it card, returnable l)y mail 
■without postage, is sent with each of these packages, and should be returned at 
once by the recipient in at'kuowledgiuent of the i)a.ckage, otherwise i'urther trans- 
missions to that address can not 6e niad(?. It should l)e borne in mind that as no 
rec<nd is madi; of the title of the book eontaiin-d in each package, it is not always 
possible to trace a given work unless the date of its dispat(di to the exchange ol'lico 
is known. 

I give this account of tiie W(uking of the Exchange Service, as f am led to believe 
from a iiumhei' of inquiriis with refereiu'c, to this Bureau that it is not thoroughly 
uneh'rstood by all who ha\e h.id occasion to make use of it. 

I am gratified to st.ite that, the re(;onnueudatiou for additional assistance con- 
tained in }»re\"i()us rei)orts having been approved, it has been ixtssible to bring the 
records ami tiles into ainueh more satisfa.ctory stati' than heretofore, as, owing to 
the insufficient c lerical force, the wm-k has been for several years ])a.st somewhat in 
arrears. By theailojition of ncsw and abbr(sviat(>d forms for records tluich^rical work 
has been materially decreased without tiie sacritice* of accuracy, though in s])ite of 
this reduction in the work aiul the iucrt^ase of tin; force it is only now possible to kee]) 
the work of the Unreau well u]) to date. This, I think, will readily be understood 
if it is reuuMulxu'ed that since JSSt! the number of |>ackages accounted lor has lieeu 
nearly donltled. 

Six thousand four hundred and sixty-one more packages wen; handhul in 1891-92 
than in tlie previous year, and on .June 30. 1892, tliere were but 102 ]>ackages on 
hand to be disposed of. 

The increased number of Hhijuuents to the ])rincipal foreign countries has been 
inaiutaiued, as shown in the tables appended as Exhihit A. A further improvement 
in this direction can l)e looked for only wh(ui the appropriations made by Congress 
beconu' suHieieid to enable the Institution to i»ay for fast freight. As it is now, 
fn^e freight is granted by a majority of the ocean steamship com])aiiies to the Smith- 
sonian Institution in its endeavor to increase and difFuse knowledge among men, 
while full rates would bi; charged to the United States Government for a similar 
service; and where! the privilege ol" fre^e freight has not b(>.en secured the exchange 
boxes art; sent by slow steamers or by sailing vessels of["ering low rates. 

I take pleasure in bearing witness to tin; conscientious eflicieiicy of Hh; employes

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. G9 



Al'PKNDIX III. 

REPORT OF THE ACTING MANAGER OF THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL 

PARK. 

Sir: I li;ive the honor to submit the foHowiiii;' report of the ojx'ratioiis of the 
National Zoological Park for the rtscal year ending .June 30, 1892: 

At the close of the last year the jiark had but Just been occupied ))y Ihe animals 
of the collection.. The expei'ience of tiie present season has been valuable as indi- 
cating the lines along which development should proceerl. 

The main road having been laid out, the permanent locations for the aninaals 
were established at convenient distances near it. The bridge across the creek was 
contracted to be built, and a temporary bridge established until such time as the 
permanent structure should be completed. The work of com]ileting the bear yards 
was also continued. 

On September ,5, a disastrous rain storm occurred, during which Rock Creek, the 
small stream that flows through the park rose to a height nearly equalling that which 
it reached at the time of the famous Johnstown flood in 1890. The rise was extra- 
ordinarily rapid, being, according to the watchmen of the park, at the rate of 6 feet 
within two hours. Within a short time a cavity 10 feet deep was excavated by the 
stream alongside of one of the bridge piers, undermining one of its corners, the 
temporary bridge was swept away, a large quantity of earth and rock was precipi- 
tated from the cliff above into the bear pits, the banks of the creek were eroded and 
a considerable amount of tilling waslu'd away, and the roads and gutters of the 
])ark recently laid were cut out and injured to a very great extent. The cost of 
repairing the damages thus occasioned was nearly $.5,000, a sum that could not well 
be spared from the scanty appropriation, and the loss embairassed the park very 
seriously during the entire season. 

The bridge pier damaged by the storm Avas rebuilt iind this delayed the linal com- 
pletion of the bridge, which was not finally opened for travid until about October 1. 

For the same reason the occu])ation of the bear yards was ])ostponed until a retain- 
ing wall much larger and stronger than had been anticipated could be built, it be- 
ing considered dangerous to place the animals in yards wliere sonu! tons of rock and 
earth might fall alter any serious storm. 

The main animal house, although far from complete, Wiis hastily jjrepared for the 
reception of animals by closing it up with temporary work and substituting ff)r the 
metal roof designed by the archite(;t a ielt roof of cheaj) construction. The com])le- 
tion of the tower at the eastern end was deferred until irinr<> funds should be avail- 
able. 

As soon as the cooler autumn weather set in the numl)er of visitors to the ])ark 
greatly increased. There was during each Sunday of October and until nearly the 
last of November an average attendance of about 7,000 ])eople each Sunday, the 
number reaching over 10,000 on some particularly line days. The dnily .-ittendance 
• luring the week was considerably less. 

This largo influx of visitors tested the arrangements whi(di had been made, and 
they were found wanting in several respects. The bridge was found to be too nar- 
row and dangerous for foot passengers. The road was in some localities so narrow 
that it Ixicame inconveniently and dangerously crowded. The number of watchmen 
was found to be entirely inade,(iuate, and the crowd was so great in tin; principal 
animal house as to be extremely uncomfortable. 



70 REPORT OF THK SECRETARY. 

To remedy tliis state of affairs it seemed necessary to place footways upon the 
bridge, to relieve the main roadway hy making side roads and walks, to enlarge the 
ground plan of the animal house, and to provide more ample means of exit. It 
seemed hest also to remove from the house as many animals as could be properly ac- 
commodated in quarters outside, both for the convenience of the public and the health 
of the animals. 

The limited means at the disposal of the j^ark did not permit the full completion 
of this plan. New roadways were cut out and new sidewalks built, an addition to 
the animal house was commenced in the shape of a large wooden shed situated on 
the north side. None of these were entirely completed at the close of the liscal year. 

A grading plan for a portion of the park was furnished by Mr. F. L. Olmsted. 
This contemplated the excavation of a large jiond for aquatic animals upon the 
meadow west of the bridge, the shaping up of the banks of the creek and their pro- 
tection from erosion by means of riprap and the formation of a smaller pond to the 
north of the road near the main entrance. But little of this could be done during 
the year, the expenses of preparing the winter quarters of the animals being such 
that all surplus funds were exhausted. It was indeed found necessary to limit the 
expenditures to the barest necessities, and although an additional apiiroi)riation of 
$1,000 was made by Congress it was with difficulty that the park was maintained 
until the end of the year. The force of employes was reduced to the lowest possi- 
ble number, and every device was used to insure the strictest and most parsimonious 
economy. 

The scantiness of the resources of the park made it necessary to j)08tpone any pur- 
chases of animals, and the collection has therefiu'e increased but slowly. There were 
on .Tune 30, 448 living animals in the collection, of which .S20 were mammals, 63 birds, 
and 65 reptiles. A catalogue of the additions made is appended hereto. Ninety-six 
animals have been presented to the park during the year, of which 43 were mam- 
mals, 26 birds, and 27 reptiles. 

The insufficient nature of the temporary quarters in which it has been necessary to 
keep the animals has led to a considerable mortality. Besides this, it is found that 
many specimens do not survive the fiitigue and excitement of the journey necessary to 
reach the park, and they succumb shortly after their arrival here. The most alarm- 
ing mortality has been that of the ])ears, two of which died from injviries received, two 
others from pulmonary trouble. While the bear yards are certainly ]nctures(jue and 
elfective from the landscape architect's point of view, it is believed that they are not 
now proper sanitary dwellings for the animals, as they are constantly damp, are too 
cold in winter and too hot in summer. It is intended to take measures to remedy 
their defects. 

Owing to the small number of watchmen necessarily employed, one of the bears 
escaped by climbing up a nearly perpendicular wall over .50 feet high. He was pur- 
sued and an attempt was made to capture him. This was, however, unsuccessful and 
it was found necessary, finally, to shoot him. 

The elephants have continued constantly to gain in weight since arriving at the 
pai'k. "Dunk" now weighs 7,260 ])ounds, having gained 1,110 pounds. " ( lohhiust" 
weighs 4,920 pounds, having gained 860 pounds.

Sir: I have the honor to submit herewith the report on the library of the Smith -

The operations of the library have been conducted as in the two preceding years.

Following is a statement of the volumes, parts of volumes, pamphlets, and charts

Of these publications, 297 volumes, 6,363 i>arts of volumes, and 774 pamphlets — 
7,434 in all — were retained for use in the National Museum. 

Eight hundred and fifty-seven medical dissertations were deposited in the library 
of the Surgeon-General, U.S. Army; the remaining publications were sent to the 
Library of Congress on the Monday after their receipt. 

In carrying out the plans formulated by the Secretary for increasing the library ))y 
exchanges, 803 letters asking for publications not on our list, or asking for numl)ers 
to complete the series already in the library, have been written. As a result of this 
correspondence it gives me pleasure to report that 444 new exchanges were acquired 
by the Institution, while 220 defective series were c(>mi»letod either wholly or as far 
as the publishers were able to supply missing parts. 

Below is a comparative statement of the operations ol" the library since .Tune 30,

Sinitiisoiiiaii Institution is to tiniiisii l)iiet' accounts of scieutilicdiscov- 
eiy iu partieulai' direetions; occasional reports of the investigations 
niade by colhiborators of the Institution; memoirs of a i^'eix^'al cliarac- 
ter or on S])ecial topics, wlietherorii^inal and prepared expressly for the 
pur])Ose, or selected from foreign journals and proceedings; and briefly 
hi jnesent (as fully as space will permit) such papers not published in 
the Snuthsonian Contributions or in the Miscellaneous (-ollecticms as 
may be sup|»ose(l to be of interest or value to the numerous correspond- 
ents of the institution. 

It has been a pronunent object of the Board of Eegents of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual report 
re(|uired of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more remark- 
able and important deyeh)pments in physical and biological discovery, 
as well as showing the general character of the operations of the Insti- 
tution; and this purpose has, during the greater part of its history, 
been carried out largely by the i)ublication of such i)apers as would 
l)ossessan interest to all attracted by scientitic progress. 

In 18S0, the Secretary, induced in i)art by the discontinuance of an 
annual summary of jirogress which for thirty years previous had been 
issued by well-known ])rivate publisliing firms, had prepared by com- 
petent collaborators a serit's of abstracts, showing concisely the 
prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology, 
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoiilogy, and 
anthro])ology. This latter ]»lan was continued, though not altogetlun- 
satisfactorily, down io and including the year 1SS8. 

In the re])ort for 1889, a return was made to the earlier method of 
])resenting a miscellaneous selection of ])a])ers (sonu^ of them original) 
embracing a ('onsiderable range of scientilic investigation aiul discus- 
sion. This method has been continued in the ])resent repm-t, for 1802.

THE iAIi:TE01U)L0(ilCAL WOllK OK THE SMITHSONIAN IN- 

STlTrTIOX.* 

Tho Smitlisouiiin Institution Ims ;il\v:iys made it a rnlc ol' action to 
undertake vsucli lines of work as point the way to great public utilities, 
and these liave subsequently been made the function of useful govern- 
ment bureaus of ai)plied science. 

This is notably true in the case of meteorology, which was developed 
by the Institution in both its scientific and its iiopular asi)ects. until its 
importance became so well understood, and its utility so widely ap- 
preciated, that in 1S7(), (Jongress made it the duty of the riiief Signal 
Officer of the V. S. Army to observe and rei>ort storms for the benefit 
of commerc*^ and agriculture. 

The interest of the Smithsonian Institution in meteorology began 
with the organization of its work by its first secretary, Prof. Josci)h 
Henry, in 1847, and from that time to the present — nearly half a cen- 
tury — meteorological science has been granted an important share of its 
labors and expenditure. 

In his " programme of organization, " submitted on the 8tli of Decem- 
ber, 1847, in giving examples of objects for which appropriations might 
l)roperly be made, the Secretary mentioned first, and urged ui)on the 
immediate attention of the Institution, a "system of extended meteor- 
ological observations for solving the problem of American storms. " 
This clear appreciation of the existing state of knowledge, and of the 
utilities to be gained, are set forth in the following words, with which 
he commends this undertaking: 

Of late years, in (nir country, m<Ko adilitions have heon made to nieteoroloi^y tlian 
t() any ottier branch ofpliysical science. Several important generalizations have 
been arrived at, and definite theories proposed, wlrich now enable us to direct our 
attention, with scientilic precision, to such points of observation as can not fail to 
reward us withnew andiutenistingresults. It is proposed to organize a systemof ob- 
servations which shall extend as far as ]»ossible over the North American continent. 
Tlie present time a])i)ears to be jtecnliarly auspicious lor conunencing an enterprise 
of the ])i'oposed kind. Tho citizens of the Ihiited States are now scattered over 
every part of the southern and western portions of North America, and the extended 
lines of the telegraph will furnish a ready means of warniiig tlie more northern and 
eastern observers to be on the watch for tlie iirst appearance of an advancing storm. 

In the inauguration of this system of observations, Prof. Henry so- 
licited the suggestions of the most experienced American meteorolo- 
gists — Espy, Loomis, and Guyot — who extended their cordial co-opera- 
tion.

90 METEOROL(lGI('AL WORK OF SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. 

Accompauyiiig the above-quoted presentation of liis programme the 
Secretary published a valuable, and now liistoric, report by Prof. 
Loomis upon the meteorology of the United States, in which he showed 
what advantage society might exi)ect from the study of storms, what 
had been already done in this country toward making the necessary 
observations, and, finally, what encouragement there was to a further 
prosecution of the same researches. He then jjresented in detail a plan 
for unifying- all the work done by existing observers, and for supple- 
menting it by that of new observers at needed points, for a systematic 
supervision, and, finally, for a thorough discussion of the observations 
collected. 

On the J 3th of December, 1847, the Board of Regents adopted the 
"programme of organization," and on the 15th inaugurated the sys- 
tem of meteorological observations by an appropriation of $1,000 for 
the purcliase of instruments and other related expenses. 

In the following year (1848) Prof. Espy, who was then the official 
meteorologist of the Navy Department, was assigned to duty under the 
direction of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. In connec- 
tion withEsj^y, the Secretary (Henry) addressed a circular letter to all 
persons who would probably be disposed to take part in the contem- 
plated systems of observations, and cooperation was solicited from the 
existing systems under the direction of the Surgeon-General, and of 
the States of New York and Pennsylvania. As a result of these efforts 
the Institution at the close of ISIO, already had one hundred and fifty 
daily observers, and the number continued to increase. 

In order to unify the methods adopted by observers, Prof. Guyot 
was requested to prepare a pamphlet of Directions for Meteorological 
Observations,* which was publislied in 1850, and to compile a collec- 
tion of Meteorological Tables, which was published as a volume of the 
Miscellaneous Collections in 1852. In 1857, after careful revision by 
the author, a second and much enlarged edition of the Tables was pub- 
lished, and in 1859, a third, with further amendments. xUthougli de- 
signed primarily for the meteorological observers reporting to the 
Smithsonian Institution, the Tables obtained a much wider circulation, 
and were extensively used by meteorologists and physicists in Europe 
and the United States. An imj)ortant step taken at the inception of 
the Smithsonian system was the introduction of accurate instruments. 
Standard barometers and thermometers were imported from Paris and 
London, with which those made for the use of the Institution were 
compared, and sets of such apparatus were furnished to observers. 

In 1849, Prof. Henry personally requested the telegraph companies to

such elementary telegraphic Aveather re])()rts were thus furnished the 
Institution daily, without charge. This action of ]*rof. Henry, which 
has sometimes been erroneously ascribed to Prof. Espy, was the be- 
ginning of telegraphic weather service, nothing of the kind having 
been attemi)ted in Euro])e until a later date, and by means of these re- 
ports ])redictions of coming storms, with all the Jiow recognized advan- 
tage to the country at large, were juade possible. With the material 
thus obtained the Institution was enabled in LS.")!), to construct the hrst 
current weather map, gi\'ing daily, from "live data," the meteorological 
conditions over the whole cimntry. This ma]) was hung where the pub- 
lic <'ould have g<Mieral access to it to observe the changes, and its indi 
cations were tirst published at large by signals displayed from the high 
tower of the Institution. This method was followed, and further ex- 
tended, by publications in the Washington Eroiiiuj t^iar in ISoT, and 
such general interest was manifested in the subject that telegraphic 
weather rei)orts were thereafter furnished to the yHtar for daily publi- 
cation. The systematic notification of the general i)ublic by the press 
and otlierwivSe of Aveather observations, api)ears, then, to have been 
undoubtedly due to Henry, and unquestionably to have preceded by a 
year a similar j)ubIication in 1858, of Leverrier, to whom this pioneer 
step has been erroneously attributed. 

In 1858, the meteorological inap already in use was improved by the 
adoption of circular disks of different colors, which were attached to it 
by pins at each station of observation, and indicated by their color 
the state of the atmosphere — white signifying clear Aveather; gray. 
cloudy; black, rain, etc. The disks had an arrow stamped u])on them, 
and as they AA'cre so arranged that they could be attached to the map in 
any direction, the motion of the Avind at each station was shown by them, 
and the ''probabilities'' thus more accurately forecast. 

The study of the meteorological data, begun in 1849, continued under 
the direction of the Institution fm- twenty-five years, during which tinu' 
numerous publications were issued relative to temperature, rainfall, 
hygrometry, and casual phenomena, Avhile i)oi)ular information was con- 
tinuously disseminated by publishing telegraphic weather reports, maps, 
etc. Ajnong the associates of the Institution in this branclj of investi- 
gation may be mentioned I*rof. J^vspy, and later. Prof. J. H. Coftin, Mr. 
C. A. Schott, ami others. Their Avork may be concisely <lescrib(^d as 
follows: Prof. Espy utilized the already collected data in the prepa- 
ration of his Third an<l Eourtli Meteorological Reports. After the 



92 METEOROLOGICAL WORK OF SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. 

Smitlisoniaii observations were practically completed, Mr. Scliott* took 
the data and prepared elaborate tables ot" tenii^erature and precipita- 
tion, wliicli were published in the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowl- 
edge. , 

Prof. Coflint compiled his great work on the laws of the winds, and 
contributed various lesser works to the bibliography of the Institution 
on meteorological subjects. 

The first collection of meteorological tables compiled by Dr. Guyot, 
at the request of the Institution, was published in 1852, as a volume of 
the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, and new editions were pub- 
lished in 1857, and 18.59. Twenty-tive years later the wfU'k Avas again 
revised, and a fourth edition was published (1884). The demand for 
these tables exhausted this edition in a few years; it was then de- 
cided to re-cast the work entirely, and publish it in three parts, one of 
meteorological, one of geograx^hical, and one of physical tables, each 
representative of the latest knowledge in its field, and independent of 
the others, but the three forming a homogeneous series. 

The desirability of establishing a meteorological departnuMit under 
one comprehensive system, with an adeipiate appropriation of funds, 
was frequently urged by the Smithsonian Institution, and in 18(59 an 
api^ropriation of $25,000 was made by Congress for the adoption and 
nuiintenance of a code of weather signals on the northern lakes, under 
the direction of the Chief of the Signal Cor])s of the United States 
Army. The Government having thus evinced a willingness to take 
charge of the meteorological system of the country, and it being the 
policy of the Institution to do nothing which could be accomplished as 
well by other means, the work of the Smithsonian in this direction was 
freely relinquished by the Institution, although its formal transfer to 
the War Department did not take place until 1874. 

During the period when the Smithsonian was directly in charge of 
meteorological researches in the United States, its expenditures in 
this connection, which had been voluntarily assumed, were over |G0,000. 
In addition to this the Institution made a contribution of incalculable 
value in the stimulus given to investigations of this class by the active 
personal interest of its first Secretary, who always devoted much time

of the material already aecumulated was eontinued by the Institution. 

The Smithsonian Institution may, then, be termed the i)arent of the

THE lUyTOKY OF THE TELESCOPE.* 



!>y Piol". C. S. IlASTmGS, Yalv Uiiircr.sitij. 



Tlicie is no instiuuieiit wliicli has done so mn{;!i to widen the scope 
of human knowledge, to extend our notions of tlic universe, and to stim- 
uhite intelh'ctual activity as has the telescope, unless the microscope 
be regarded as a successful rival. But even admitting a parity in 
scientitic iin|)ortance, the former instrument is incomparably niorv 
interesting in its history, in the same degree that its history is more 
simple and more comprehensible. To trace its development from a 
curious toy in the hands of its discoverer, for we shall see that this term 
is more appropriate than inventor, to the middle of this century, is to 
be brought into contact with most of the great philosophers, from the 
tiiue of the Renaissance, who have achieved greatness in physical 
science, Galileo, Torricelli, Huyghens, Cassiui, jSTewtoi], Halley, Kepler, 
Euler, (yahiiault, the Herschels, father and son, Fraunhofer, Gauss — 
from only a portion of the list of great names. Its growth toward per- 
fection has constant 1\- carried with it increased [>recisi()n in the applied 
sciences of navigation ami of all branches of engineering. It would be 
easy to show that even pure matheniatics would be in a far less forward 
state had there been no problems of astronomy and physics which were 
tirst suggested by the emi)loyment of the telescope. It is to. this his- 
tory that I venture to invite your attenti(m this evening. L purpose to 
re\iew succinctly the origin and development of tliis potent aid in the 
study of nature, to mmu' some of the more imi)ortant ac^hievemeuts de- 
l)ending ui)on it, and to tra(;e its gradual improNcment to the nuigniti- 
cent and coni])licated instrument which constitutes the modern eipia- 
torial. After this sketch I shall tiy to give an ideai of the imperfections 
which the conscientious artisan has to contend with in attaining per- 
fection, and to make clear the methods which ha-\ e been employed in 
reducing these imperfections in the noble instrument now erected at 
this institution,! and ex])lain why its ])osse!4Sors are so hopeful of grat- 
ifying success.

06 THE HISTORY OF THE TELESCOPE. 

Galileo learned in 1009, while visiting Venice, tliat a marvellous in- 
strument had been invented the preceding year in Holland, which 
would enable an observer to see a distant object with the same distinct- 
ness as if it were only at a small fraction of its real distance. It required 
but little time for the greatest physicist of his age to master the prob- 
lem thus suggested to his mind, and after his return to Padua, where he 
held the position of professor of mathematics in the famous university 
of that city, he set himself earnestly to work making telescopes. Such 
was his success that in August of the same year he sent to the Vene- 
tian senate a- more perfect instrument than they had been able to pro- 
cure from Holland; and in January of the next year, by means of a 
telescope magnifying thirty times, he discovered the four satellites of 
Jupiter. This brilliant discovery was followed by that of the mountains 
in the moon ; of the variable x>li<ises of Venus, which established the 
Goiiernican theory of the solar system as incontestible, and of the true 
nature of the Milky Way, together with many others of less philosoph- 
ical impoi'tance. Though Galileo did not cliange the character of the 
telescope as it was known to its discoverer in Holland, he made it 
much more perfect; and above all, made the first and most fertile ap- 
plication of the instrument to increase the bounds of human knowledge, 
so that it is inevitable that his name should be indissolubly connected 
with the instrument. Thus the form which he used is to this day 
known as the Galilean telescope. 

Considering the enormcms interest excited throughout intellectual 
Europe by the invention of the telescope, it seems surprising that its 
early history is so confused. Less than two years after it was first 
heard of, a discovery, iterhaps the greatest of a thousand years in the 
domain of natural philosophy, had been made by its means. Notwith- 
standing these facts, the three contemporary, or nearly contemporary, 
investigators assign the honor to three different persons, and if we 
should write out the names of all those to whom more modern writers 
have attributed the invention, the list would be a long one. The sur- 
prise will not be boundless, however, if we consider the task before a 
historian in the next century who undertakes to justly apportion the 
honor of the invention of the telephone among its numerous claimants. 
The analogy, though suggested in the obvious fact that the telephone 
is to hearing just what the telescope is to sight, may be made much 
closer if we could imagine the future historian de[>rived of all but verbal 
description, that contemporary diagrams and models were wholly want- 
ing. Under such conditions it is difficult to believe that the historian 
would easily escape ante-dflting the discovery of the telephone projjcr 
on account of descriptions, generally imi)eriect, of the acoustic tele- 
phone. But this would fairly represent the condition of the material 
at the command of an investigator of the present day into a question 
of science of the early part of the seventeenth century. No wonder, 
then, that the invention has been attributed to Archimedes, to Jloger 



THE HISTORY OF THE TELESCOPE. 97 

Bacon, to Porta, and to many others who have written on optics; but 
to find the name of Satan iu the list is certainly surprising. Still we 
read that a very learned man of the seventeenth century, named Arias 
^lontanus, tinds in the fourth chapter of Matthew, eighth verse, evi- 
dence that Satan possessed, and probably invented, a telescope; othei- 
wisc, how could he have •' sliown him all the kingdoms of tlie world 
and tlie glory of them*'!'* It seems tc> be well established now, liow- 
ever. that Franz Lippershey, or Lii)pe]sheim, a spectacle maker at 
Middleburg, was the real inventor of the telescope, and that ( Galileo's 
first telescope, avowedly suggested by news of the Hollander's achieve- 
ment, was an independent invention. 

That this discovery was really an accident we may be quite sure, 
for not only was there no developed theory of optics at that time, but 
even the law of refraction, which lies at the basis of such theory, was 
quite unknown. So, too, it seems to me quite certain that Galileo's 
invention nuist have been empirical and guided by somewhat precise 
information, vsuch as that the instrument consisted essentially of two 
lei]ses, of which one was a magnifying and the other a diminishing 
lens. .Vt least, that (ialileo's telescope was like that of the Hollander; 
that, theoretically considered, it is not so sinqde as that made of two 
magnifying lenses, as is evinced by the fact that Kepler, the first 
l>liilosopher to establish an api)roximate theory of optical instruments, 
only two years later invented the latter and prevailing form; and 
finally, that (xalileo published no contributions to the theory of optics, 
seem (piite sufticient reasons for such a belief. But, in any case, (Ia- 
lileo's merit is in no wise lessened by having failed to do what coiUd 
not be done at that time, and the value of his discoveries in emanci- 
])ating men's minds from autliority in matters of pure reason is incal- 
culable. 

No other discoveries <»f gieat moment were made until over a gen- 
eration after (raliUi* i)rove(l the existence of spots on the sun in Kill. 
This cessation of activity was doubtless owing to the dilUculty of se- 
curing telescopes of greater clficiency than that ]»ossessed by (lalileo, 
and wl\ich he would hardly hav(^ left until its ])owers of discovery had 
been fnlly exhausted in his own hands. By the middleof the seventeenth 
century, however, several makers of lenses had so far improved the 
methods of grinding and ])olishing, that telescoi»(\s notably su])erior in 
]»()\ver to that of (i^ableo were procurable. Of these Torricelli, Divini, 
and Campani, all Italians, — Auzout, Avho constructed a te]escoi)e 000 
feet in length, though no means was ever found for directing such an 
enormous instrument towards the heavens, — but above all, Huyghens, 
have W(m distinction as telescope -makers. The last named philos- 
oj)her discovered, by means of a telescope of his construction, the lar- 
gest satellite of Saturn in 1(555, tlius adding a fifth member to the list

of planetary bodies unknowu to the ancieuts. But his most important 
astronomical discovery, made also in 105"), was the nature of tlie 
rings of Saturn. This object had greatly puzzled Galileo, to whose 
small telescope the planet appeared to consist of a larger s])here 
flanked on either side by a smaller one; but when in the course of the 
orbital motion of Saturn the rings entirely disappeared he was wholly 
unable to suggest an explanation. This planet had thus j)resented 
a remarkable problem to all astronomical observers for more than 
forty years, and the records of the eftbrts to solve it during that inter- 
val afford us a most excellent means of judging the progress in practi- 
cal optics. Huyghens announced these discoveries early in 1650, but 
that relating to the ring was given in the form of an anagram, the 
solution of which was first published in 1659. This discovery was 
contested in Italy by Divini, but was finally confirmed by members of 
the Florentine Academy with one of Divini's own telescopes. 

A few years later the famous astronomer Cassini, having come to 
Paris from Italy as royal astronomer, commenced a series of brilliant 
discoveries with telescopes made by Campani, of Eome. AVith these, 
varying in length from 35 feet to 13(5 feet, he discovered four satellites 
to Saturn in addition to the one discovered by Huyghens. The whole 
number was increased by Herschel's discovery of two smaller ones in 
1789, a hundred and five years after Cassini's last discovery, and again 
by Bond's discovery of an eighth in 1818. The Saturnian system, to 
which the telescope has doubtless been directed luore frequently than 
to anything else, thus serves as a record of the successive im])rove- 
ments of the telescope. Highly significant is the fact that the discov- 
eries of the eighteenth century were made with a reflecting telescope, 
the otliers all being with refracting instruuients. 

Cassini's discovery in 1681 of the two satellites now known as Tethys 
and Dione, was not accepted as conclusive until long afterwards, when 
Pound, in 1718, wich a telescope 123 feet in length, which Huyghens 
had made and presented to the Royal Society, saw all five. This par- 
ticular instrument is of especial interest, because it is the only one of 
those of the last half of the seventeenth century which has been care- 
fully compared with modern instruments. Moreover, it is without 
doubt quite equal in merit to any of that period. But we find that, 
although it had a diameter of 6 inches, its performance was hardly 
better than that of a perfect modern telescope of 4 inches in diameter, 
and, ])erhaps, 4i feet in length, while in regard to convenience in use 
the modern compact instrument is incomparably superior. 

Another notable discovery of this period was that of the duplicity 
of the rings of Saturn by the Ball brothers in 1665, though its inde- 
pendent discovery by Cassini ten years later first attracted the atten- 
tion of astronomers. The earlier discovery was made by means of a 
telescope 38 feet long which seems to have been of English manufac- 
ture. We must regard Cassini's discovery of the third and loiuth sat-

cUite.s of kSaturu, however, as maiUiii-i tlie \ ery taitlicst reaeli of tlie 
old form of telescope; a century was to elapse and an entirely new 
form of telescope was to be developed before another considerable ad- 
dition to onr knowledge' of the aspect of the heavenly- bodies was to be 
iiiadt\ It is true larger telescopes were made, and ITuygheus invented 
a means by wliich they could be used without tubes, but notwithstand- 
ing this improvement they proved so cumbers(une as to be impracticable. 

The older o[)ticians had tbund that if they attempted to increase the 
diameter of a teleseojje they were obliged to increase its length in a 
much more rapi<l ratio to secure distinct vision. The reason of this 
was not clearly understood, but it was sui)posed to be owing to the fact 
that a wave front, changed in curvature by passing througli a s])herical 
surface, is no longer strictly spherical. This deviation in shai)e of tlu; 
refracted wave from a true sphere is called spherical aberration. When 
the refracting surfaces are large and of considerable curvature this 
soon becomes very serious, but by using small curvature, which, in a 
telescope, obviously conesponds to great length, theefl'eets of the error 
can l)e made insensible. Xewton's discovery of the com])osile, nature 
of light and of the phenomenon of dispersion enabled him to explain 
the true cause of indistinctness in short telescoi)es: mimely, that the 
refraction by the objective varies for different colors; conseiiuently, if 
the ocular is placed for one particular color, it will not be in the light 
position for any of the others, when(;e the image of a star or ])laiiet 
will stem to be suirounded by a fi'inge of colored light. Newton found 
this source of indistinctness in the image, wliich is now known as 
cliromati(; aberration, many hnndred times as serious as the s})her 
ica I aberrations. As he was i)ersuaded by his ex])eriments that this 
obstacle to further improvement in the refracting telescope was in- 
snperable, he turned his attention to a form of teleseojn' m hich had 
been suggested a number of years earlier in which (he image was to 
be formed by retlection from a concave mirror, and constructed a small 
one with his own hands which is still in the possession of the b'oyal 
Society. This little instrument seems to have been ol" about the same 
]»ower as Galileo's instrument with which he discovered the satellites 
of Jupiter, but is was hardly more than (J inches in length. 

Since that time the retlecting telescope has had a remarkable history 
of develo])menl in the hands of a number of most skillful mechani- 
cians, who liave also for the most part beeu distinguished by their dis- 
coveries in i»liysical astronomy; we may therelbre advantageously 
depart from the chronological treatment and follow the history of this 
type of instrument. This c(mrse is the more natural because we may 
probably regard the snpremacy of the relleetor (undisputed a century 
ago) as passed away tore\'er. 

Even after Newton's invention was made ])ul»lic, little was done 
towards the improvement of telescopes Ibi- half a century, until Hadley 
presented a relleetor of his own construction to the iioyal Society iu

1723, which was found to be e(j[ual to the Huygheus refractor of 123 
feet in length. From this time we may date the l)eginuiug of the 
superiority of reflectors, A few years kiter Short commenced his 
career as a practical optician, and for thirty years he was unapi)roached 
in the excellence of his instruments. During this time many telescopes, 
more powerful than the best of the previous century and infinitely more 
convenient in use, had been made and scattered throughout Europe, 
but during this period also there was a singular dearth of telescopic 
discovery. Perhaps men thought that the harvest had already been 
gathered ; or, perhaps, we may find the explanation in that the great 
cost of telescopes so restricted their use that the impulse to discovery 
by their means was confined to a very small class. In view of the 
remarkable manner in which the standstill in this branch of science 
was finally followed by a brilliant period of discovery, rivalled alone 
by that of Galileo, we might well regard the latter cause as the chief 
one. 

William Ilerschel was born in 1738 in Hanover. In 1755 he left his 
native country, and going to England, secured a i)osition as organist 
in Octagon Chapel, Bath, where we find him in 1700. Here he became 
so profoundly interested in the views of the heavens which a borrowed 
telescope of moderate power yielded, that he tried to purchase one in 
London. The cost of a satisfactory instrument proving beyond his 
command, he determined to construct one with his own hands. Thus 
he entered upon a course which was to reflect honor upon himself, his 
country, and his age, and which was to add more to physical astronomy 
than any other one man has added before or since. With almost 
inconceivable industry and perseverance he cast, ground, and polished 
more than four hundred mirrors for telescopes, varying in diameter 
from 6 to 48 inches. This in itself would imply a busy life in any arti- 
san, but when we remember that all this was merely subsidiary to his 
main work of astronomical discovery, we can not withhold our admira- 
tion. 

Fortunately for science as well as for himself, he made early in his 
career a discovery of the xevy first importance which attached the at- 
tention of all Christendom. On the night of March 13, 1781, Herschel 
was examining small stars in the constellation of Gemini with one of 
his telescopes of a little more than G inches in diameter, when he per- 
ceived one that ai)peared "visibly larger than the rest." This proved 
to be a new world, now known as Uranus. The discovery led in the 
following year to his ai>pointment as astronomer to the king, George 
III, with a salary sufficient to enable him to devote his whole time to 
astronomy. 

One of the fruits of this increased leisure was the construction of a 
telescope far more powerful than had been dreamed of by his prede- 
cessors, namely, a telescope 4 feet in diameter and 40 feet in length. 
Commenced in 1785, Herschel dated its completion as August 28, 1789, 



THE HISTORY OF THE TELESCOPE. 101 

when he (liS(H)veiecl by its uieaiis a sixth satellite <>l" Saturn and, less 
than a month later, a seventh, even closer to the planet and smaller 
than the sixth. We may regard this a(diievement as markinji the limit 
of progress in the reflecting telescope, for, although at least one as 
large is now in use, and one even half as large again has been con- 
structed, it is inore than doubtful whether they were ever as perfect as 
Herschers at its best. 

There has been one improvement however in the reflecting telescope 
since the time of Herschel which ought not to be left unnoticed here, 
namely, that of replacing the heavy metal mirror by one of glass, made 
even more highly reflective than the old mirrors by a thin coating of 
silver deposited by chemical methods upon the jtolished glass. The 
great advantage of this modern form of reflector lies, not so much in 
the greater lightness and rigidity of the material as in that the surface 
when tarnished can be renewed by the simple process of replacing the 
old silver fllm by a new one; whereas in the metal reflectors a tarnished 
sui'face required a repetition of the most difficult and critical i)ortion of 
the whole process of construction. The construction is also so comi>ar- 
atively simple that an efficient reflector is far less expeusiv^e than are 
refracting telescopes of like power, so that this may be regarded as 
particularly the amateur's telescope. On the other hand, such tele- 
sco})es are, like their ])redecess<)rs. extremely inconstant, and they re- 
(juire much more careful attention to keep them in working order. It 
is for these reasons, doubtless, that silver-on-glass reflectors have donc^ 
so little for the advancement of astronomical discovery. In astroncun- 
ical pliotograi)hy, however, they promise to do much; and indeed, at 
the present date by far the best photograi)hs Ave have of any nebuhe 
have been made by 'Slv. Common's magnificent reflector of 3 feet iu 
diameter, and by the L*() inch reflector of Mi-. Ifoberts. 

We must go back now to a quarter of a century before Herschel dis- 
covered the new ))lanct, — to the very year indeed when that great 
astronomei' first set foot on English soil, — in or<ler to trace tlio history 
of another form of tele.sco])e whicli has remained unrividlcd for the last 
half century in the more diflicult lields of astronomical research, and 
wliich to-day finds its most ])erfe(;t development in the instruments at 
Mount Hamilton, at Tulkowa, at Vienna, and at Washijigton. 

jS'ewton had declared that, as a result from his exi)eriments, separa- 
tion of white light into its constituent colors was an inevitable accom- 
jtaniment of deviation by refraction, and consequently the shortening of 
the unwieldy retractors was imi)ractical)]e. The (;orrectiH*ss of the ex- 
Iteriments remained unquestioned for nearly a century; but a famous 
(Icrnniii mathematician. Fouler, did (piestion his conclusion. His argu- 
ment was that since the eye does produce colorless images oi' white ob- 
jects it might be possible by the proper selection of cuives to so combine 
lenses of glass and of water as to jnoduce a telescope free from the color 
defect. Although JMilei-'s premise was an error, since the eye is not free 



102 THE HISTORY OF THE TELESCOPE. 

from dispersion, his efforts liad the effect of leading- to much more crit- 
ical study of the phenomena involved. In this Jolni Dolland, an Eug- 
lish optician, met with brilliant success. Repeating an experiment of 
Kewton's with a prism of water opposed by a prism of glass he found 
that deviation of light could be produced without accompanying dis 
persion into prismatic colors. More than this, he found that the two 
varieties of glass, then as now common in England — crown or common 
window glass, and flint glass, which is characterized by the presence 
of a greater or less quantity of lead oxide — possessed very different 
powers in respect to disi>ersi(m; thus, of two prisms of these two vari- 
eties of glass which would deflect the light by the same angle, that 
made of flint glass would form a spectrum nearly twice as long as the 
other; hence, if a prism of crown glass deflecting a transmitted beam 
of light, say 10 degrees, were combined with one of flint glass which 
would deflect the beam of light 5 degrees in the opposite direction there 
would remain a deflection of 5 degrees without division into color. It 
also follows that a i)ositive lens of crown combined with a negative 
lens of flint of half the i)ower would yield a colorless image. Such 
cond)iuations of two different substances are called achromatic systems. 

It is a singular fact, wortli noting in passing, that more than twenty 
years before Dol land's success, Mr. Chester More Hall had invented 
and niade achromatic telescopes, but this remained unknown to the 
world of science until after Dolland's telescopes became tamous. 

For along time this ingenious invention remained fruitless for astro- 
nomical discovery, (though they were early api)lied to meridian instru- 
ments,) on account of the impossibility of securing sufficiently large and 
})erfect pieces of glass, more particularly of flint glass. Not until after 
the beginning of this century was any real advance in this branch of 
the arts exhibited. Even then success appeared, not in England or 
France, where most strenuous efforts had been made to im])rove the 
quality of optical glass, but in Switzerland. There a humble mechanic, 
a watchmaker named (ruinaud, spent many years in ettbrts, long un- 
fruitful, to make large pieces of optical glass. What degree of success 
he attained therc^ during twenty years of experiment we do not know, 
though from the fact that during that period good achromatic tele- 
sco])es of more than 5 inches in diameter were unknown we must con- 
clude that his success was limited. In 1805 he joined the optical 
establishment of Fraunhofer and TJtzschneiden in Munich. Here he 
ren)ained nine years, and with the increased means at his disposal, and 
the aid of Fraunhofer, he perfected his methods so far that the pro- 
duction of large disks of homogeneous glass became only a matter of 
time and cost; that is to say, all of the large pieces of optical glass 
which have since been produced, whether in Germany, France, or Eng- 
land, have been made by direct heirs of the i»i'actical secrets of this 
Swiss watchmaker. 

Fraunhofer was a genius of a liigh order. Although he die(i at the 



THE HlJ^TORY f)F THE TELESCOPE. 103 

oarly aoo nf 39, he had not only l^ionglit the nchromatic telescope to a 
(U'jiice of ojjtical ]K'iieetioii which niade it a rival of the most ])<)werful 
of the relh'ctor ty])«', and so far improved its method of inouiitiiig', that 
his system has replaced all others; but he also made some capital dis- 
co\eries in the domain of i)hysical optics. His great achievement was 
the c(mstrnction of an achromatic telescoi)e U.G inches in diameter, 
w ith which the eldci- Srruve made at Dorpat his remarkable series of 
discoveries and measurement of donl)le stars. The character of 
Struve's woik demonstrates the excellence of the telesco])e, and shows 
ns that it is to be i-anked as the ecpial of all but the very best of its 
l>redecessors. Indeed, it may lairly l)e concluded that not more than 
one or two telescopes, and those made and used by Ilerschel, had ever 
been of .i^reater })ower, while in convenience for use the new refractor 
was vastly superior. 

For a long time Fraunhofer and his successors. Merz and Mahler, 
from whom the great telescopes of Pulkowa and of the Harvard Observ- 
atory were procured, icmained unri\ ailed in this tield of optics. But 
they have been followed In' a number of skillful constructors whose 
products have, since the middle of the century, been scattered all over 
the world. In ( Jermany, Hteinheil and Schi(>der: in France, Canchois, 
JMartin, and the lleniy brothers; in England, Cook and (iriil)!); and in 
this country the ('larks and Brashear, h-<v<' eacii jjroduced one or more 
great telescoi>es which has rendered his name tamiliar to all readers of 
astnmomical history. ( )f these the Clarks, father and son, have beyond 
a doubt won the first i)lace, whether determined by the character of 
the disco\eries made by nu'ans of their instruments or by the fact that 
the two most ])Owerful telescopes in existence were made by them, 
namely, the new refractor of .">() inches in diameter, at Pulkowa, and tlu' 
gicnt rt^ractor of.'] feet diameter, of the Lick ()l)servatory in ralifornia. 
'i'lie most uotal>le discox'ciies made witii their telescopes are the satc^l- 
lites of Mars and tiie com[)anion to Sirius; but besides these there is a 
long list of double stars of tluMuost difticult character discovered by 
the makers themselves, by Dawes, in I'^nglaud, by Ibiinham, in our 
own country, and by a nund)ei' of other observers. 

W(! ought not to terminate our review of the development of the tel- 
escope without a reference to the parallel develoi)ment of the mounting 
of great telescopes. Indeed, <lid this not lead us too far from the im- 
mediate aim in view, we might iind a. great deal of interest and Ix^ 
brought info agre<'able contact with sonu'of the cleverest nu'chanicians 
and engineers of two ceiituiies by tracing its course. A\e should 
meet with lluygluMis, ;is the inventor of the aerial telescope, and per- 
hajts consider the claims of his c(>nfeiuporar\ , K'obeit Ilook, as a rival 
inventor, for we may be sure that nothing which brings us to a study 
of that curious and able philosopher wouhl tail to possess in ter(^st. We 
should find ilerschel confrcuifed with the problem as to how he should 
use his gieat 4()-foot telescoi>e. and the study of his solution would

guide us in valuing the results of the subsequent efforts of Lassel and 
Eosse. The same line of study would bring us to Grubb's clever and 
interesting equatorial mounting of that anachronism, the 4-foot Mel- 
bourne reflector. But we should find nothing of very notable interest 
in the mounting of refractors, after the time of Huyghens and Hook, 
until Fraunhofer invented ii type of mounting for the famous Dorpat 
equatorial, which still remains in its essential features as the type in 
universal use. With the increase in size of the telescopes to be directed 
towards the heavens, however, the number and complexity of the me- 
chanical problems to be solved has been vastly increased, so that they 
have taxed the best powers of some of the ablest mechanicians. The 
Eepsolds, of Germany, and Sir Howard Grubb, of Dublin, have specially 
distinguished themselves in this field of activity. But it seems to me 
that none have shown greater fertility of resources, greater skill in the 
solution of every problem affecting the comfort and efficacy of the ob- 
server, and greater taste, combined with accurate workmanship, than 
have the celebrated firm which has mounted the telescope at Mount 
Hamilton and that at Carleton College, 

We come now to a consideration of the present state of the art of 
lens-making. We ask why such a very large proportion of the tele- 
scopes in existence are bad; why there was a time, brief it is true, dur- 
ing which the glass-maker was certainly in advance of the demands of 
telesco])e-makers; and why, finally, the first of the great modern objec- 
tives was in the hands of the most skillful optician in Great Britain for 
seven years, and even then this maker asserted that it Avas incom])lete. 

These questions can not be answered in a word, but we can, at least, 
gain much in persjjicuity by recognizing that the reasons are of two 
distinct kinds, namely, purely technical, and theoretical; and by re- 
garding them briefly in succession. 

The art of lens-making can be certainly traced back to the 13th cen- 
tury, though the methods at a much later day than that were so rude 
that, as we have seen, Galileo had the utmost difliculty in making a 
lens good enough to bear a magnifying power of 30 times. At the 
])resent day there is little difficulty in selecting a spectacle glass which 
would rival that most famous of all telescopes. Not until after another 
generation of effort was there such notable improvement in the tech- 
niijue of lens-making that farther astronomical discovery was i)ossil)le. 
The reasons for this slow progress are to be found in the extremely 
critical requirenuMits for a good lens. A departure by a fraction of a 
hnndrcd thousandth part of an inch from a correct geometrical surface 
will greatly impair the performance of an objective. But even at this 
day the limit of accurate measurement may be set at about a one-hun- 
dred-thousandth of an inch, while it is (juite probable that ten times 
that value was vanisliingly small to the artisans of a century or more 
ago. It was necessary therefore to devise a method of polishing — 
for it is a comparatively simple matter to grind a surface accurately — 



THE HliSTORY OF THE TELESCOPE. 1 Of) 

which should keep the surface true within a liiuit far transcendiug the 
raiii.'C of measureiiieuts. Huyghens is the first who seems to liave (h»iie 
(his, by polishiiiii upon a paste which was formed to the lilass and then 
(hied, and by using only the central i)ortion of a hirge lens. In Italy 
Canspani develoi)ed a system which he most jealously guarded as a 
secret until his death, consisting of i)olishing with a dry powder on 
paper cemented to the grinding tools. This method still survives in 
i'aris to the exclusion of almost all others, and it is probably the best 
for work which does not demand the highest scientific precision, 

Newtou however was the first to introduce a method which has 
since been developed to a state of surprising delicacy. Casting about 
for a means which should be sufticiently ''tender," to use his own ex- 
]»ression, for i)olishing the soft speculum metal, he fixed upon i)itcli, 
shaped to the mirror while warm, as a bed to hold the polishing powder. 
But the enormcms value of this substance lies not so much in the com- 
l)arative immunity which it gives from scratching, but in the fact that 
under slowly changing forces it is a liquid, but under those of short 
duration it behaves like a hard and brittle solid. Thus it is possible 
to slowly alter the shape of a lens while polishiug, in any desired direc- 
tion. It was only after the ]nactical recognition of this fact that really 
excellent lenses were nuich more than a question of good fortune. The 
l)erfecting of this method belongs without doubt to the English of the 
last century and the early i)art of this. In the Philosoi)hical Transac- 
tions, we find many long papers relating to this art, contributed by 
skillful and suc<-essful anuiteurs. We may therefore regard the tech- 
i!i(pu' of the art of lens-making as practically complete at the middle of 
this century and as common property, so that success no longer de- 
pends upon the holding of some special or secret method. 

We are now (after this, I fear, somewhat dry discussion of a necessary 
])oint) in a condition to explain the differences between the processes 
pursued by most telescope niakersand that of the maker of the Carletou 
("olh'ge telescoi)e. 

This is the ordinary method: After securing perfect pieces of glass, 
crown and flint, as like as i)()ssible to those generally used, and having 
fixed upon the general shape of the lenses, a guess is made as to the 
lin>])er radii of the foui- surfaces to detennme the desired focal length 
and corrections both for color and spherical aberration. The success 
of this guess has much to <lo with the necessary outlay of labor, and 
fherei'ore ])ast expi'rience is of great value as a guide. iMter working 
tlic lour surfaces to the dimensions pro\ isionally adopted so far as to 
admit of lairly good seeing through the objective, an examination of the 
errors is made. Should the errors of color be S(> small that their final 
correction w ill not make the telesco])e more than from 3 to 10 per cent 
greater or less than the desired focal length, the crown lens will i)rob 
ably be comi)leted in accordance with the prctvisional figures. I'hen 
the Hint lens will be modified in such a tlirei^tion as will tend to correct 



106 THE HISTORY OF THE TELESCOPE. 

the observed errors of color and lignre, until, by a purely tentative proc- 
ess, the color error is practically negligible and the error of figure is 
small. Then follows a process when the qualities of skill, conscientious- 
ness, and perseverance have full scope. This process tirst introduced, or 
at least made public by roucault, is known as local correcting. It 
consists in slowly polishing away portions of the lens surfaces so that 
errors in the focal image become so small, not that tliey can not be de- 
tected, but that one can not determine whetlier they are on the one 
side of truth or the other. Local correcting has always seemed to me 
to be eminently unscientific and unnecessary. It is a process of mak- 
ing errors small which ought not to exist. 

Mr. Brashear's method is essentially different from this. Before the 
glasses are touched every dimension and constant of the finislied 
objective is known with great accuracy. His whole aim is to make the 
surfaces geometrically perfect; and by ingenious polishing machinery, 
which embodies twelve years of his thought and experience, he is 
enabled to do this with truly astonishing exactness. All the surfaces 
which admit of investigaticm — usually three in his ordinary construc- 
tion — are made rigidly true without regard to the character of the focal 
image. This leaves only one surface which is known to l)e very nearly 
a sphere, but probably deviating slightly within in tlie direction of a 
l)rolate or oblate spheroid. A glance at the character of the focal image 
will determine this point. Then the polishing machine is adapted to 
bring about a change in the proper (lirecti<»n, and after action during a 
measured interval of time, the image is again examined, and from the 
observed change in character the necessary time for complete correc- 
tion by the same or contrary action may be deduced. It will be 
observed that by this means it is quite possible to correct errors which 
are much too small to betray their nature, since a step in the wrong 
direction carries with it no consequences of the slightest moment, since 
any step may be retraced. 

When we learn that Mr. Brashear's telescope objectives have always 
had a focal length differing only from one-tenth to one one-huudred- 
and-eightieth of 1 per cent of the value prescribed, we have a sugges- 
tion of the success of his efforts. But adding to that t\ie fact that he 
is absolutely untrammelled by purely mechanical considerations, either 
as to the shape of his lenses or the character of his materials, leaving 
these questions to be decided alone by the requirements of the astrono- 
mer, it seems to me that we may fairly accord to him the merit of the 
most important improvements introduced into his art for a very long 
period. 

I shall not venture to demand nnich of your time in considering the 
purely theoretical difficulties in telescope construction, not merely be- 
cause the subject has already taxed our patience, but because it would 
be of almost too technical a character did we allow ourselves to regard 
anything but the most general features. 



THF HISTORY OF THE TELESOOPE. 107 

Tbe obvious r('(|uir<iii«Miis ure that in a good objective tlio li'-lit coui- 
iii_i>' from a point in tlie object sliould be concentrated at a point in tiie 
iinaji'c; but tliis, combined with a prescribed focal ]cn,ntli, may 1)6 re- 
duced to tliree coiulitions: First, a lixed focal length; second, freedom 
fr(tm color error; third, freedom iVom splierical alxn-ration for a partic- 
ular color or wave lengtli of light. Now let us catalogue what provi- 
sions we have for satisfying these conditions. They are, four surfaces, 
wliieh uuist be spherical but may have any radii we please, the two 
thicknesses of the two lenses, and the distance Avhicli se])arates the 
lenses — tluit is, seven elements which may be varied to suit our require- 
ments. As a matter of fact, however, on acconnt of the cost of the 
material and the fact that glass is perfectly transparent, for powerful 
telescopes we must make the lenses as thin as possible; and we shall 
tind also that separating the lenses introduces errfU's away from the 
axis which are, to say the least, undesirable. We have left, therefore, 
only the four radii as arbitrary constants. These, however, are more 
than enough to meet the three requirements. To make the problem 
determinate we uuist add another condition. The suggestion of this 
fourth condition and carrying- the ]>rol)lem to its solution is the work 
of the great mathematicians who have directed their thought to it. 
Clairault i)roposed to make the fourth condition that the two adjacent 
surfaces should tit together and the lenses be cemented. This condition 
would be, doubtless, of great value were it i)Ossible to cement large lenses 
without changing their shapes to a degree which would quite spoil their 
performance. ^Sir John llerschel published a very important i)aper in 
1S21, in wliich he made the fourth condition that thesi»herical aberiation 
should vanish, not only for objects at a very great distance, but also for 
those at a moderate distance. In this ]»aper he computed a table, after- 
wards greatly extended by Prof. IJaden Powell, for the a\'owed i)urpose 
of aiding- the practical optician. It was tiiis feature undoubtedly which 
brought his construction, not at all a good one as we shall see, into 
more general use than any other for some time. But, as all nerschefs 
tables were deiived from calculations whicli wholly disregarded the 
tidckness of the lenses, I am (pute unable to see how they could have 
been <»f any nmterial aid, and am inclined to suspect that the discredit 
with which oi»ticians have received the dicta of mathematicians con- 
cerning their instruments may have been due in part to this very fact. 
It is a singular fact, for which 1 have in vain sought the explanation, 
that r'raunhofer's objccti\es ar(^ of Just such a torm as to comply witii 
the lleischelian solution, although they must have been made (piite 
independently. 

(lauss made th<'f(»urth condition that another color or wave length 
of light should be also free from s])herical aberration. This seems to 
have been a tour deforce as a mathematician, not as a sober suggestion 
of an improvement in ccuistiuction, for in a ])oint of fact the construc- 
tion is very bad. It was generally believed that this con«lition could 



10!^ THE HISTORY OF THE TELESCOPE. 

iioL be fultilled; tlierefore Gauss, who was particularly fond of doing 
wliat all the rest of the world believed imx^ossible, straightway did it. 
There has been only one eltbrt to carry out this suggestion of Gauss, 
and that forty years later by Steinheil, but it proved a disappointment. 
A much larger objective made by (31ark a few years ago, of the general 
form of Gauss's objective, probably does not meet the Gaussian condi- 
tion, — at least this condition is extremely critical, and I believe it is not 
asserted tliat the objective was ever thoroughly investigated. It has 
been the father of no others. 

It is hardly surprising, since none of these forms have any real merit, 
that the practical optician has, following the line of least resistance, 
adopted a form which costs him less labor than those heretofore men- 
tioned and is quite as good. V>y making tlie curve equi-;'onvex the 
trouble and expense of making one pair of tools is saved, although this 
would hardly appear a satisfactory i-eason for choice of a particuhir 
form to the astronomer, who simply demands tlie best possible instru- 
ment of research. 

The reason for so much futile work on the theory of the telescope 
objective is not far to seek. It had always been tacitly assumed that 
the condition of color correction, one of those which serves to determine 
the values of the arbitrary constants, was readily determinable — in 
fact, one of the doniie of the problem, wliereas it is just this datum 
which has offered peculiar difficulties. Fraunhofer brought all the re- 
sources at the command of his genius to bear upou this point, and frankly 
failed, although in the effort he made a splendid discovery, which has 
assured a permanence to his fame no less than that of the history of 
science itself — the discovery of the dark, or Fraunhofer, lines iu solar 
and stellar spectra. Gauss i)roposed the condition that the best objec- 
tive is that which produces the most perfect concentration of light about 
the place of the geometrical image of a point, just as the best rilie 
practice is that which produces the niaxinuim concentration of hits 
about the center of tlie target. That this is a false guide appears at once 
from the consideration that if we take even as much as 10 per cent of 
the light from an object and diverted from the image so far that it can 
not be found, tlie telescope may still bo practically perfect; all of Her- 
schel's did much worse than this. But if you take that same 10 jjer 
cent and concentrate it very close about the image, the telescope will 
be absolutely worthless. 

The true difficulty with most of the theorists is this: There is no 
recognition of the relative weight or importance of unavoidable errors. 
The optician is <'onfronted at the very outset by the fact that absolute 
elimination of color error is impossible, for certain physical reasons 
which we have not time for considering farther. He can reduce the 
color error of the old single-lens type of telescopes hundreds of times, 
and hence the length of the telesco]>e tens of times. It is tliis fact 
which prevents the still farther sliortening of telescoiies, which keeps

the ratio of length to (liaiiu'tcr not less than tiftecn to one in large tele 
scopes. This restriction being recognized, let us re\ ise our limiting coir 
ditions. They now become, first, lixed fo(;al length; second, l»est color 
<'orrection; third, freedom from spherical aberration for a paiticular 
wave-length of light. We therefore have still one arbitrary constant 
undetermined. How shall we tix its value, and thus solve tiie problem 
comi^letely ? Surely there is only one rational guide. Consider the 
residual errors and make the fourth condition such as to reduce these 
errors as far as possible. Xow the only remaining errors are secondary 
color error and spherical aberration for colors other than that for which 
it is eliminated, or more scientitically, chromatic difference of spherical 
aberration. Which of these is the gravest defects Our answer must 
de|)end upon the use to which the ol)jective is to be put. If it is a 
high-power microsco[)e objective, it is certainly the second. If it is an 
objective to be used for photographing at considerable angular dis- 
tances from the axis, our ({uestion loses its ])hysical significance, since 
we ha\ e excluded the consideration of eccentric refraction. But if the 
ol)jective is to be for a visual telescope, there is no ([uestion that the 
defect of secondary color error is incomparably the most serious. Our 
fourth and determining condition must, therefore, be better color cor- 
rection. 

These are therefore the consideraf ions whicli have served as guides 
in the construction of the Carleton College objective. First, the selec- 
tion of the materials which, in the present condition of the art of opti- 
cal glass making, possess in the highest degree the desired physical 
l)roperties; second, a general discussion of every possible combination 
of these two pieces of glass and a selection of the forms whi(;h yield 
the best at tainable results. This conscientious strife after scientihc 
perfection, the unexcelled skill with which the results of analysis have 
been interpreted into the reality of substance, the gratifying identity 
of pre<licted and realized values of ]>hysical characteristics — all of these 
have led some of those v. ho have watched the growth of this new in- 
sti'ument of research with the most solicitous attention to the belief 
that although not tin' most powerful in existence it nu»y well be the 
m(»st jx'rfcct great telescope yet made. Let us thcretbre (congratulate 
the possessors of this m)ble instrument, wish them (iod s])eed in their 
search after knowledge, wliile we remiml them that although no as- 
tronomer can ever n»ake another discovery which will rival that made 
by the insignificant tube lirst directed toward the heasens by the 
i'aduan philosophei', yet no mind can weigh the imj)ortance of any 
truth, liowever trivial in ap])earance, which may be added to that store 
whicli we call "science."' 



GEOLOGICzVL CHANGE, A2^T) TIME.* 



By Sir Akciubald Geikie, 
Director-General of the Geolofiical ^Si(rrci/ of Great Britain. 



Ill its bciieficent projiress tlirougii these islands tlie British Asso- 
ciation Tor the Advancement of Science now for the fourth time receives 
a welcome in this ancient capital. Once again, under the shadow of 
these anti(pie towers, crowded memories of a romantic past till our 
thoughts. The stormy annals of Scotland seem to move in possession 
before our eyes as we walk these streets, whose names and traditions 
ha\e been made iamiliar to the civilized world by the genius of litera- 
ture. At every tuin, too, we aie reminded, by the mouuments which 
a grateful city has erected, that for numy generations the pursuits 
which we are now assembled to foster have had here their congenial 
home. Literature, philosojthy, science, have each in turn been guided 
by the influence of the great masters who have lived here, and wliose 
renown is the brightest gem in the chaplet around the brow of this 
Queen of the North. 

Lingering for a moment over these local associations, we shall find a 
jieculiar api)ropriateness in the time of this renewed visit of the Asso- 
ciation to l<](linl»urgh. A hundred years ago a renuirkable grouj) of 
men was discaissing here the great problem of the history of the earth. 
James Hutton, after nmny years of travel and reflection, had com 
numicated to the Koyal Society of this city, in the year 1785, the first 
outlines of his fannuis Theoiy of the Earth. Among those with whom 
he took counsel in the elaboration of his doctrines were Black, the 
illustrious discoverer of fixed air and latent heat; Clerk, the sagac- 
ious inventor oi' the system of l)reaking the enemy's line in naAal tac- 
tics; Hall, whose fertile ingenuity de\ised the first system of exi)eri- 
ments in illustralion of the structure and origin of rocks; and IMayfair, 
Ihi'ough whose sympathetic enthusiasm and literary skill Hut Ion's 
\ lews cauK^ ultimately to be understood and a[)preciated by the world 
at large. With these friends, so well able to comprehend and criticise 
his eliorts to pierce the veil that shrouded the history of this globe, he

paced the stieettj amid which Ave are now gathered together; with them 
he sought the crags and ravines around us, wherein Kature has hiid 
open so many impressive records of her past; with tliem he sallied 
forth on those memorable expeditions to distant parts of Scotland, 
whence he returned laden with treasures from a field of observation 
Avliich, though now so familiar, was then ahnost untrodden. The cen- 
tenary of llutton's Theory of the Earth is an event in tlic annals of 
science which seems most fittingly celebrated by a meeting of the 
British Association in Edinburgh. 

In choosing from among the many subjects which might properly 
engage your attention on the present occasion, I have thought that it 
would not be inappropriate nor uninteresting to consider the more 
salient features of that Theory, and to mark how much in certain 
departments of inquiry has sx)rung from the fruitful teaching of its 
autlior and his associates. 

It was a fundamental doctrine of Ilutton and his school that this 
globe has not always worn the aspect which it bears at present; that 
on the contrary, proofs may everywhere be culled that the land which 
we now see has been formed out of the wrecli of an older land. Among 
these proofs, the most obvious are supplied by some of the more 
familiar kinds of rocks, which teach us that, though they are now por- 
tions of the dry land, they were originally sheets of gravel, sand, and 
mud, which had been worn from the face of long- vanished continents, 
and after being spread out over the floor of the sea were consolidated 
into compact stone, and were finally broken up and raised once more 
to form part of the dry land. This cycle of change involved two great 
systems of natural processes. On the one hand, men were taught that 
by the action of running water tlie materials of the solid land are in a 
state of continual decay and trans])ort to the ocean. On the other 
hand, the ocean floor is liable from time to time to be upheaved by 
some stupendous internal force akin to that Avhich gives rise to the 
volcano and the earthquake. Ilutton further perceived that not only 
had the consolidated materials been disrupted and elevated, but that 
masses of molten rock had been thrust upward among them, and had 
cooled and crystallized in large bodies of granite and other eruptive 
rocks which form so prominent a feature on the earth's surface. 

It was a special 'characteristic of this philosophical system that it 
sought in the changes now in progress on the earth's surface an ex- 
planation of those which occurred in older times. Its founder refused 
to invent causes or modes of oi)eration, for those with which he was 
familiar seemed to him adeipiate to solve the i)roblems with whicli he 
attemi)ted to deal. Xowhere was the profoundness of his insight more 
astonishing than in the clear, definite way in wliich he i)roclaimed and 
reiterated his doctrine, that every part of the surface of the continents, 
from mountain top to seashore, is continually undergoing decay, and is 
thus slowly travelling to the sea. Ue saw that no sooner will the «ea 



GEOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND TIME. 113 

floor be elevated into new land than it must necessarily become a prey 
t<» this universal and unceasing' de.uradati()n. He perceived that as the 
transport of disintegrated material is carried on chiefly by runninu' 
water, rivers must slowly dig out for themselves the channels in which 
they How, and thus that a system of valleys, radiating from the water 
l)arting of a country, must necessarily result from the descent of the 
streams from the mouutaiu crests to the sea. lie discerned that this 
ceaseless and wide-spread decay would eventually lead to the entire 
demolition of the dry land, but he contended that from time to time 
this catastrophe is prevented by the operation of the under-ground 
forces, whereby new continents are upheaved from the bed of the ocean. 
And thus in his system a due proportion is maintained between laud 
and water, and the condition of the earth as a habitable globe is pre- 
served. 

A theory of the earth so simple in outline, so bold in conception, so 
full of suggestion, and resting on so broad a base of obser\ation and 
retlectiou, ought (we might think) to have commanded at once the atten- 
tion of men of science, even if it did not immediately awaken the inter- 
est of the outside world; but, as Playfair sorrowfully admitted, it 
attracted u_otice only very slowly, and several years elapsed before any 
one sliowed himself publicly concerned about it, either as an enemy or 
a friend. Some of its earliest critics assailed it for what they asserted 
to be its iireligious tendency, — an accusation which Hutton repudiated 
with niucli warmth. The sneer levelled by Cowper a few years earlier 
at all in(|uiries into the history of the universe was perfectly natural 
and intelligible from that poet's point of view. There Avas then a wide- 
spread belief that this world came into existence some six thousand 
years ago, and that any attempt greatly to inci'ease that antiquity was 
meant as a blow to the authority of Holy Writ. So far however from 
aiming at the overthrow of orthodox beliefs, Hutton evidently regarded 
liis "Theory" as an important contribution in aid of natural religion. 
He dwelt with unfeigned pleasure on the multitude of proofs which he 
was able to accumulate of an orderly design in the operations of nature, 
decay and renovation being so nicely balanced as to maintain the hab- 
itable^ condition of the planet. But as he refused to admit the pre- 
dominance of violent a(;tion in terrestrial changes, ami on the contrary 
contended for the etiicacy of the (piict, continuous processes which we 
can even now see at work around us, lie was constrained to require an 
uidimitcd duration of ])ast time for the production of those revolutions 
ot which he i)erceived such clear and abundant i)roofs in the crust of 
the earth. The general i)ul)lic, howcvei'. failed to comprehend that the 
doctrine of the high anti({uity of the glol)e was not inconsistent with 
the conq)arative]y recent ai)pearance of man, — a distinction which seems 
so obvious now. 

Hutton died in 171>7, beloved and regTetted by the circle of friends 
who had learned to ai»i)reciate his estimable character and to admire his

genius, but with little recognition from the world at large. Men knew 
not then that a great master had passed away from their midst, who 
liad laid broad and dee^) the foundations of anew science; that his 
name would become a household word in after generations, and that 
])ilgrims would come from distant lands to visit the scenes from which 
he drew his inspiration. 

Many years might have elapsed before Ilutton's teaching met with 
wide acceptance, had its recognition dei)ended solely on the writings of 
the philosopher himself. For, despite his linn grasp of general prin- 
ciples and his mastery of the minutest details, he had acquired a liter- 
ary style which, it must be admitted, was singularly unattractive. 
Fortunately for his fame, as well as for the cause of science, his devoted 
friend and disciple, Playfair, at once set himself to draw up an exposi- 
tion of Ilutton's views. After five years of labor on this task there 
appeared the classic " Illnstratious of the lluttonian Theory," a work 
which for luminous treatment and graceful diction stands still without 
a rival in English geological literature. Though professing merely to 
set forth his friend's doctrines, Playfair's treatise was in many respects 
an original contribution to science of the highest value. It placed for 
the first time in the clearest light the whole philosophy of Hutton regard- 
ing the history of the earth, and enforced it with a wealth of reasoning 
and copiousness of illustration which obtained for it a wide apprecia- 
ation. From long converse with Hutton, and from profound reflection 
himself, Playfair gained such a comprehension of the whole subject, 
that discarding the non-essential parts of his master's teaching, he was 
able to give so lucid and accurate an exposition of the general scheme 
of Nature's operations on the surface of the globe, that with only slight 
corrections andexi)ansions his treatise may serve as a text-book to-day. 
In some respects, indeed, his volume was long in advance of its time. 
Only, for example, within the present generation has the truth of his 
teaching in regard to the origin of valleys been generally admitted. 

Various causes contributed to retard tlie progress of the Huttonian 
doctrines. Especially potent was the influence of the teaching of Wer- 
ner, who, thimgh he perceived that a definite <n-der of sequence could 
be recognized among the materials of the earth's crust, had formed 
singularly narrow conceptions of the great processes whereby that 
crust has been built up. His enthusiam, however, fired his disciples 
with the zeal of proselytes, and they spread themselves over Europe to 
preach every where the artificial system w^hichthey had learned in Sax 
ony. By a curiousfate PMinburgh became one of the great headquarters 
of Wernerism. The friends and followers of Hutton found themselves 
attacked in their own city by zealots, who i)roud of superior minera- 
logical ac(purements, turned their most cherished ideas upside down 
and assailed them in the uncouth jargon of Freiberg. Inasmuch as 
subterranean heat had been invoked by Hutton as a force largely in- 
strumental in consolidating and upheaving the ancient sediments that

alone admitted by Werner, wlio belie\e(l tlie rocks oftlie eaitli's crust 
to liave been cUietly chemical precii)itates from a primeval universal 
ocean, those who adopted bis views received the equally descriptive 
name of ]Sre])tunists. The battle of these two contendinii- schools raged 
liercely here for some years, and tliougb mainly from the youth, zeal, 
and energy of Jameson, and the intluence which his position as ])ro- 
fessor in the university gave him, the Wernerian doctrines continued 
to hold their ])la('e they were eventually abandoned even l)y flanu'son 
himself, and the debt due to the memory of Ifntton and Playfair was 
tardilv acknowledged. 

The })ursuits and the (juarrels of philosphcrs have from early times 
been a favorite subject of merriment to the outside world. Sucli a feud 
as that between the Plutonists and Xeptuuists would be sure to furnish 
abundant matter for the gratification of this propensity. Turning over 
the ])ages of Kay's "Portraits," where so much that was distinctive of 
Edinburgh society a. hundred years ago is embalmed, we find Hutton's 
personal iieculiaritiesand jtursuits touched off in good-humored carica- 
ture. In one plate he stands with arms folded and hammer in hand, 
meditating on the face of a clifi', from which rocky prominences in 
shape of human faces, perhaps grotes(pie likeiu'sses of his scientific 
o[)ponents, grin at him. In another engraving he sits in conchue with 
his friend Black, possibly arranging for that famous banquet of garden 
snails which the two worthies had persuaded themselves to look upon 
as a strangely neglected form of liuraan food. More than a generation 
later, when the lluttonists and Wernerists weie at the height of their 
antagonism, the humorous side of the controversy did not escape the 
notice of the author of ''AVaverley,'' who, you will remember, when he 
makes Meg Dods recount the various kinds of wise folk brought by 
Lady Peneloi)e Pennfeather from Edinburgh to St. Konan's Well, does 
not f(»rget to include those who "rin upliill and down dale, knapping 
the chucky-stanes to pieces wi' hammers (like sae mony road-makers 
run dalt), to see how the \varld was mad*'." 

Among the names of the friends and followers of Hutton there is one 
wlMcli on this occasion deserves to be hehl in especial Inmor, that of 
Sir .James Ilall, of Dunglass. Having acconq»aiiied Hutton in some 
of his excursions, and having discussed w ith him the i>i()l)]ems pre- 
sented l)y the rocks of S(M»tland, Hall was fanuliar with the views of 
iiis master, and was able to sui)ply him with fresh illustrations of them 
from dirterent parts of the country. (Jifted with remarkable originality 
and ingenuity, he soon ])erceived that some of the questions involved 
in the theory of the earth could probably be solved by direct physical 
experiment. Hutt<Mi however mistrusted any attempt "to ju<lge of 
tiie great operations of nature by merely kindling a tii-e aiul looking 
into the bottom of a little crucible." Out of deference to this preju- 



116 GEOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND TIME. 

dice Hall deliiyed to carry out his intention during Button's lifetime. 
But afterwards lie instituted a remarkable series of researches which 
are memorable in the history of science as the first methodical endeavor 
to test the value of geological speculation by an appeal to actual ex- 
periment. The Neptuuists, in ridiculing the Huttonian doctrine that 
basalt and similar rocks had once been molten, asserted that, had such 
been their origin, these nuisses would now be found in the condition of 
glass or slag. Hall however triumphantly vindicated his friend's \\e\v 
by proving that basalt could be fused, and thereafter by slow cooling- 
could be made to resume a stony texture. Again, Hutton had asserted 
that under the vast pressures which must be effective deep within the 
earth's <*rust, chemical reactions must be powerfully influenced, and 
that under such conditions even liniestoue may conceivably be melted 
without losing its carbonic acid. Various siiecious arguments had 
been adduced against this proposition, but by an ingeniously devised 
series of experiments Hall succeeded in converting limestone under 
great pressure into a kind of marble, and even fused it, and found that 
it then acted vigorously on other rocks. These admirable researches, 
which laid the foundations of experimental geology, constitute not the 
least memorable of the services rendered by the Huttonian school to 
the progress of science. 

Clear as was the insight and sagacious the inferences of these great 
masters in regard to the history of the globe, their vision was neces- 
sarily limited by the comparatively narrow range of ascertained fact 
which up to their time had been established. They taught men to 
recognize that the present world is built of the ruins of an earlier one, 
and they explained with admirable perspicacity the operation of the 
processes whereby the degradation and renovation of land are brought 
about. But they never dreamed that a long and orderly series of such 
successive destructions and renewals had taken place and had left 
their records in the crust of the earth. They never imagined that from 
these records it would be possible to establish a determinate chro- 
nology that could be read everywhere and ap'iilied to the elucidati<m 
of the remotest quarter of the globe. It was by the memorable obser- 
vations and generalizations of William Smith that this vast extension 
of our knowledge of the past liistory of the earth became possible. 
While the Scottish philosophers were building up their theory here, 
Smith was (juietly ascertaining by extended journeys that the stratified 
rocks of the west of England occur in a definite sequence, and that 
each well-marked group of them can be discriminated from the others 
and identified across the country by means of its inclosed organic 
remains. It is nearly a hundred years since he made known his views, 
so that by a curious coincidence we may fitly celel)rate on this occasion 
the centenary of William Smith as well as that of James Hutton. No 
single discovery has ever had a more momentous and far reaching in 
llueuce on the progress of a science tliaii that law of organic succession 



GEOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND TLME. 117 

which Smith established. At tirst it served merely to determine the 
order of the stratified rocks of England. I>ut it soon proved to possess 
ji worldwide value, for it was found to furnish the key to the struc- 
ture of the whole stratitied crust of the earth. It showed that within 
that crust lie the chronicles of a. long- history of i)Iant and animal life 
upon this }>lanet, it sui)i)lied the means of arraugiiij^- the materials for 
this history in true chronological sequence, and it thus oi)eued out a 
mag'niticent vista through a vast series of ages, each marked l)y its 
own distinctive types of organic life, which, in in-oportion to their an 
tiqnity, dei)arted more and more from the aspect of the living world. 

Thns a liuudred years ago, by the brilliant theory of Hutton and tlie 
fruitful generalization of Smith, tlie study of the earth rccei\"cd in our 
country the impetus which has given birth to tlie modern science of 
geology. 

To review the marvellous progress which this science has made dur- 
ing the first century of its existence would recpiire not one, but many, 
hours tor adeiiuate treatment. The march of discovery has advanced 
along a multitude of different ]>aths, and tin? domains of nature which 
have been included within the growing territories of human knowledge 
have been many and ample. Nevertheless, there are certain depart- 
ments of investigation to which we may protitably restrict our atten- 
tion on the present occasion, and wherein we may see how the leading 
}>rinciples that were proclaimed in this city a hundred years ago ha\ e 
germinated and borne fruit all oxer the world. 

From the earliest times the natural features of the earth's surface 
have arrested the attention of mankind. The rugged mountain, the 
cleft ravine, the scarped cliff, the solitary bowlder, have stimulate«l 
curiosity and prom]ited many a speculation as to their origin. The 
shells embedded by millions in the solid rocks of hills far remo\ed frou! 
the seas have still further pressed home these "obstinate questionings." 
Hut for many long centuries the advance of inquiry into such matters 
was arrested by the paramount intluence of orthodox theology. It was 
not merely that the church opi)ose<l itself to the simple and obvious in- 
terpretation of these natural |>henomena. So inq)licit had faith l)ecome 
in the accepted views of tiie earth's age. and of the history of creation, 
that even laymen of intellig<'n<'e and learning set themsehes unbidden 
and in perfect good faitli to exi>lain away the difliculties which nature 
so persistently raised up, and to reconcile her teachings with those of 
the tlieologians. In the various theories thus originating, tlie amount 
of knowledge of natural law usually stood in inverse ra,ti(t to the share 
l)hiyed in them by an uncontrolled imagination. The speculations, for 
exanq)le, of Ibirnet, Whiston, Whitehurst, and others in this country, 
cau not be read now without a smile. Jn no sense were they scuentiflc 
researches; tliey can only be looked upon as exercitations of learned 
ignorance. Springing mainly out of a laudable desire to i)r(unote what 
was belie\'ed to be the cause of true religion, they heli)ed to retard 



118 GEOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND TIME. 

inquiry, and exercised in that respect a baneful influence on intellectual 
progress. 

It is the special glory of the Edinburgh school of geology to have 
cast aside all this fanciful trifling. Huttou boldly proclaimed that it 
was no ])art of his philosophy to account for the beginning of things. 
His concern lay only with the evidence furnished by the earth itself as 
to its origin. With the intuition of true genius he early jjerceived that 
the only solid basis from which to exj)lore what has taken place in 
bygone time is a kno^^ ledge of what is taking place to-day. He thus 
founded his system upon a careful study of the processes whereby geo- 
logical changes are now brought about. He felt assured that Nature 
must be consistent and uniform in her working, and that only in pro- 
portion as her operations at the present time are watched and under- 
stood will tlie ancient history of the earth become intelligible. Thus, 
in his hands, the investigation of the Present became the key to the 
interpretation of tlie Past. The establislnnent of this great truth was 
the first step towards the inauguration of a true science of the earth. 
The doctrine of the uniformity of causation in Nature became the 
fruitful principle on which the structure of modern geology could be 
built up. 

Fresh life was now breathed into the study of the earth. A new 
spirit seemed to animate the advance along every i^athway of inquiry. 
Facts that had long been familiar came to possess a wider and deeper 
meaning when their connection with each other was recognized as parts 
of one great harmonious system of continuous change. In no depart- 
ment of Nature, for exam})le, was this broader vision more remarkably 
displayed than in that wherein the circulation of water between land 
and sea plays the most conspicuous part. From the earliest times men 
had watched the coming of clouds, the fall of rain, the flow of rivers, 
and had recognized tliat on this nicely adjusted machinery the beiiuty 
and fertility of the land depend. But they now learned that this 
beauty and fertility involve a continual decay of the terrestrial surface; 
that the soil is a ]neasure of this decay, and would cease to afford us 
maintenance were it not continually removed and renewed; that 
through the ceaseless transi^ort of soil by rivers to the sea the face of 
the land is slowly lowered in level and carved into mountain and valley, 
and that the materials thus borne outwards to the floor of the ocean 
are not lost, but accumulate there to form rocks, which in the end vcill 
be upraised into new lands. Decay and renovation, in well-balanced 
proportions, were thus sliown to be the system on which the existence 
of the earth as a habitable globe had been established. It was impos- 
sible to conceive that the economy of the planet couUl be maintained 
on any other basis. Without the circulation of water the life of plants 
and animals would be impossible, and with that circulation the decay 
of the surface of the land and the renovation of its disintegrated mate- 
rials are necessarily involved. 



GEOLOOIOAL CIIANrxE, AND TIME. 119 

As it is now, so must it have been in jtast time. Hntton and Play- 
fair pointed to the stratified roclis of tlie eartlTs crust as demonstra- 
tions that the same ])rocesses wliicli are at work to-day have been in 
oi)eration from a remote antiquity. By thus phicing tlieir theory on a 
basis of actual observation, and providing in the study of existing 
oj^erations a guide to tlie interi)retation of those in past times, they 
rescued the investigation of the history of the eaith from the specula- 
tions of theologians and cosmologists, and establislied a place for it 
among the recoginzed inductive sciences. To the guiding influence of 
their i»hilosophical system the i)rodigious strides made by modern 
geology are in large nu^asure to be attributed. And here in their own 
city, after the lai)se of a hundred years, let us oj'fcr to tlu'ir memory 
the grateful homage of all who have ]trotited by tlieir labors. 

But while we recogidze with admiration the far-rcacliing intluenceof 
the doctrine of uniformity of causation in the investigation of the his- 
tory of the earth, we must upon reflection admit that tlw doctrine has 
been pushed to an extreme jterhaps not contemi»lated by its original 
founders. To take the existing conditions of Nature as a platform of 
actual knowledge from which to start in, an inquiry into former condi- 
tions was logical and prudent. Obviously, however, human experience, 
in the few centuries during which attention has been turned to such 
subjects, lias been too brief to warrant any dogmatic assumption that 
the various natural processes must have been carried on in the past 
with the sanu' energy and at the same rate as they are carried on now. 
Variations in energy might have been legitimately conceded as possi- 
ble, though not to be allowed without reasonable proof in their favor. 
It was right to refuse to admit the operation of s])eculative causes of 
change when the phenomena were ca]»able ol" natural and adequate 
explanation by reference to causes that can be watched and investi- 
gated. But it was an eri-or to take for granted that no other kind of 
process or intiiu'ni-e, nor any vaiiation in therateof activity save those 
of which man has had actual cognizance, has j)layed a part in the ter- 
restrial economy. The uniformitarian writers laid themselves open to 
the charge of maintaining a kind of perjx'tual motion in the machinery 
of Nature. Tiiey could iind in the records of the earth's history no 
evidence of a beginidng. no prospect of an end. They saw that many 
successive renovations and <lestructions had been efle<'ted on the 
earth's surface, and that this long line of vicissitudes ibrmed a series 
of which the earliest were lost in anti(]uity, while the latest were stdl 
in ])rogress towards an apjuirently illimitable future. 

The (discoveries of WiUiam Smith, had they been adequately under- 
stood, would hav(^ been seen to olfer a corrective to this rigidly uni- 
formitarian conception, for they revealed that the crust of the earth 
contains the long record of an unmistakable older of progression in 
organic types. They provc<l that ])hints and animals have varied

had yet been found, or indeed was ever likely to be found, of the first 
living things that appeared ujion the earth's surface, the manifest sim- 
l)lification of types in the older formations pointed irresistibly to some 
beginning from which the long procession has taken its start. If then 
it could thus be demonstrated that there had been upon the globe an 
orderly march of living forms from the lowliest grades in early times 
to man himself to-day, and thus that in one department of her domain, 
extending through the greater portion of the records of the earth's his- 
tory, Nature had not been uniform, but had folh^wed a vast and noble 
plan of evolution, surely it might have been expected that those who 
discovered and made known this plan would seek to ascertain whether 
some analogous physical progression from a definite beginning might 
not be discernible in the framework of the globe itself 

But the early masters of the science labored under two great disad- 
vantages. In the first place, they found the oldest records of the earth's 
history so brokeu up and eftaced as to be no longer legible. And in 
the second place, they lived under the spell of that strong reaction 
against speculation which followed the bitter controversy between the 
Neptunists and Plutonists in the earlier decades of the century. They 
considered themselves bound to search for facts, not to build up theories; 
and as in the crust of the earth they could find no facts which threw 
any light upon the i>rimeval constitution and subsequent develoi^ment 
of our planet, they shut their ears to any theoretical interpretations 
that might be ottered from other departments of science. It was 
enough for them to maintain, as Ilutton had done, that in the visible 
structure of the earth itself no trace can be found of the beginning of 
things, and that the oldest terrestrial records reveal no physical con- 
ditions essentially different frcmi those in which we still live. They 
doubtless listened with interest to the speculations of Kant, Laplace, 
and Herschel on the probable evolution of nebuhie, suns, and ])lanets, 
but it was with the languid interest attaching to ideas that lay outside 
of their own domain of research. They recognized no i)ractical con- 
nection between such speculations and the data furnished by the earth 
itself as to its own history and i)rogress. 

This curicms lethargy with respect to theory on the part of men who 
were popularly regarded as among the most speculative followers of 
science would ])i()bably not have been speedily disi)elled by any dis- 
covery made within their own field of observation. Even now, after 
many years of the most diligent r<'search, the first chai)ters of our 
])lanet's history remain undiscovered or undecipherable. On the great 
terrestrial palim])sest the earliest inscriptions seem to have been hope- 
lessly effaced by those of later ages. But the question of the prim- 



\

eval condition and subsequent histoiy of the planet might be consid- 
ered from tlie side of astronomy and physics. And it was by investi- 
gations of this nature that the geological torpor was ev-entually dissi- 
]iated. To our illustrious former president, Lord Kelvin, who occupied 
this chair when the association last met in Edinburgh, is mainly due 
the rousing of attention to this subject. l>y the most convincing argu- 
ments he showed how impossible it was to believe in the extreme doc- 
trine of uniformitarianism. And though, owing to uncertainty in re- 
gard to some of the data, wide limits of time were postulated by him, 
he insisted that within these limits the whole evolution of the earth 
and its inhabitants must have been comi)rised. While therefore the 
geological doctrine that the present order of Nature must be our guide 
to the interpretation of the past reumined as true and fruitful as ever, 
it had now to be widened by the reception of evidence furnished by a 
study of the earth as a planetary body. The secular loss of heat, 
which demonstrably takes place both fiom the earth and the sun, made 
it quite certain that the present could not have been the original con- 
dition of the system. This diminution of temperature with all its con- 
sequences is not a mere matter of si)eeulation, but a physical fact of 
the present time as much as any of the familiar physical agencies 
that affect the surface of the globe. It points with unmistakable di- 
rectness to that beginning of things of which Hutton and his followers 
could lind no sign. 

Another modification or enlargement of the uniformitarian doctrine 
was lirought about by continued investigation of the tei'restrial crust and 
consequent increase of knowledge respecting the history of the earth. 
Though llutton and Playfair believed in periodical catastropiies, and 
indeed re(]uired these to recur in order to renew and preserve the habit- 
able condition of our planet, their successors gradually came to view 
with rei)ngnauee any appeal to abnormal, and especially to violent 
manifestations of terrestrial vigor, and even persuaded themselves that 
such slow and comparatively feeble action as had been witnessed by 
man could iil(»ne be recognized in the evidence from which geological 
history must be eomi)iled. Well do 1 remember in my own boyhood 
what a cardinal article of faith this pi-epossessiou had become. \\c 
were taught by our great and honored master, Lyt^ll, to believe im- 
plicitly in gentle and unilbrm operations, extended over indetlnite 
[)eriods of time, though i)ossil»ly some, with the zeal of i)ar(isans, car- 
ried this belief to an extreme which Lyell himself did not ai)prove. 
The most stu])end(ms marks of tm'restrial dislurbance, siu-li as the 
structure of great mountain chains, were deemed to be more sjitisfac- 
torily accounted for by slow movements prolonged through indefinite 
ages than by any sudden convulsion. 

What the more extreme members of the uniformitarian school failed 
to ])erceive was the absence of all evidence that terrestrial catastrophes 
even on a colossal scale might not be a part of the present economy of 



122 GEOLOGtCAL CHANGE, AND TIME. 

this globe. Such occurrences might never seriously affect the whole 
earth at one time, and might return at such wide intervals that no ex- 
ample of them has yet been chronicled by man. But that they have 
occurred again and again, and even within comparatively recent geologi- 
cal times, hardly admits of serious doubt. How far at different epochs 
and in various degrees they may have included the operation of cosmi- 
cal influences lying wholly outside the planet, and how far they have re- 
sulted from movements within the bod}' of the planet itself, nuist remain 
for further inquiry. Yet the admission that they have played a part in 
geological history may be freely made without imi)airii]g the real value 
of the Huttonian doctrine, that in the interpretation of this history our 
main guide must be a knowledge of the existing processes of terrestrial 
change. 

As the most recent and best known of these great transformations, the 
Ice Age stands out conspicuously before us. If any one sixty years ago 
had ventured to affirm that at no very distant date the snows and 
ghiciers of the Arctic regions stretched southwards into France, he 
would have been treated as a mere visionary theorist. Many of the 
fiicts to which he would have api)ealedin supi)ortof his statement were 
already well known, but they had received various other interpretations. 
By some observers, notably by Hutton's fi'iend, Sir James Hall, they 
were believed to be due to violent debacles of water that swept over the 
face of the land. By others they were attributed to the strong tides 
and currents of the sea when the land stood at a lower level. The uni- 
formitarian school of Lyell had no difficulty in elevating or depressing- 
land to any required extent. Indeed, when we consider how averse 
these philosophers were to admit any kind or degree of natural opera- 
tion other thiui those of which there was some human experience, we 
may well wonder at the boldness with which, on sometimes the slender- 
est evidence, they made land and sea change places, on the one hand 
submerging mountain ranges and on the other placing great barriers of 
land where a deep ocean rolls. They took such liberties with geogra- 
phy because only well-established processes of change were invoked in 
the operations. Knowing that during the passage of an earthquake a 
territory bordering the sea may be upraised or sunk a few feet, they 
drew the sweeping inference that any amount of upheaval or depression 
of any part of the earth's surface might be claimed in explanation of 
geological i>roblems. The ]>rogress of inquiry, while it has somewhat 
curtailed this geographical license, has now made known in great detail 
the strange story of the Ice Age. 

There can not be any doubt that after man had become a denizen of 
the earth, a great physical change came over the Northern hemisphere. 
The climate, which liad previously been so mild that evergreen trees 
flourished within ten or twelve degrees of the north pole, noAv became so 
severe that vast sheets of snow and ice covered the north of Europe and 
crept southward beyond the south coast of Ireland, almost as far as the 



GF.OLOGlrAL CHANOK, AND TIME. 123 

soutliern sliores of Englaiul, and across the Baltic into France and Ger- 
many. This Arctic transformation \\'as not an episode that lasted merely 
a few seasons, and left the land to resninc thereafter its ancient aspect. 
Witli \arioiis successive tiuctuations it must have endured for many 
thousands of years. When it begjan to disappear it i)robably faded 
awa.N as sl()\\i>- and imperceptibly as it had advanced, and when it 
hnall.N \anished it left Europe and Xortli America jnofoundly chan<ied 
in the character alike of their scenery and of their iidiabitants. The 
ru.uii'ed rocky contours of earlier times \vvv(\ i^rouiid smooth and pol- 
ished by the march of the ice across them, Avhile the lower grounds were 
buried under wide and thick sheets of clay, j^ravel, and sand, left l)e- 
hind by the meltin,«i- ice. The \ aried and abundant tlora which had 
spread so far within the Arctic? circle was driven away into more 
southern and less un,i;enial climes. But most nienu)rable of all was 
the extirpation of the prominent large animals which, before the ad- 
vent of the !<•»', had roanu'd over Europe. The lions, hyenas, wild 
horses, hipi)opotaniuses, and other creatures either became entirely ex- 
tinct or were <lriven into the Mediterranean basin and into Africa. In 
their i)lact^ came northern forms — the reindeer, glutton, musk ox, woolly 
rhinoceros, and mammoth. 

Such a marvellous transformation in climate, in scenery, in vegetation 
and in inhabitants, within what was after all but a brief portion of geo- 
logical time, though it may have involxed no sudden or violent convul- 
sion, is sundy entitled to rank as a. catastrojjhe in the liistory of the 
globe. It was ])rol)ably brought about mainly if not entirely by the 
oi)eration of forces exteriuil to tln^ earth. No similar cahimity having 
befallen the continents v.ithin the time during which man has been 
recording his e\perieiu;e, the Ice Age might be cited as a contradiction 
to the iloctrine of unifornuty. And yet it manifestly nrrixt'd as part of 
the estal)Iished ordered' Xature. Whether or n(»l we graid that other 
ice ages lueceded the last great one, we must admit that the conditions 
um.ler w Iiieh it arose, so far as we know them, ndght conceivably have 
occui-red before and may occur again. The- various agencies called 
into i)lay by tin- extensive icfrigeration of the northern hemisphere 
were not different from those with which we are familiar. Snow fell 
and glaciers cre])t as they do to-day. Ice scored and ])olished rocks 
exac tly as it still does among the Alps and in Norway. There was 
nothing abnormal in the phenomena, save the scale on which they 
were manil'ested. .\nd thus, taking a broad view of (he whole subje<'t, 
we recognize the catastrophe, while at the same time we see in its i)rog- 
ress the operation of those same natural ])r()cesses w hich we know to 
be integral jtarts of the machinery whereby the surface of the earth is 
continually tian stormed.

the least memorable is the promulgalion of the tirst w ell iounde<l con-

ceptions of the high antiquity of the globe. Some six thousand years 
liad previously been believed to comprise the whole life of the j^lanet, 
and indeed of the entire universe. When the curtain was then tirst 
raised that had veiled the history of the earth, and men, looking beyond 
the brief span within which they had supposed that history to have 
been transacted, beheld the records of a long vista of ages stretching 
fiir away into a dim illimitable past, tlie prospect vividly impressed 
their imagination. Astronomy had made known the immeasurable 
fields of space; the new science of geology seemed now to reveal bound- 
less distances of time. The more the terrestrial chronicles were studied 
the farther could the eye range into an antiquity so vast as to dety all 
attempts to measure or define it. The progress of research continually 
furnished additional evidence of the enormous duration of the ages 
that preceded the coming of man, while, as knowledge increased, periods 
that were thought to have followed each other consecutively were found 
to have been separated by prolonged intervals of time. Thus the idea 
arose and gained universal acceptance that, just as no boundary could be 
set to the astronomer in his free range through space, so the Avhole of by- 
gone eternity lay open to the re(i[uirements of the geologist. Playfair, 
re-echoing and expanding Hutton's language, had declared that neither 
among the records of the earth, nor in the planetary motions, can any 
trace be discovered of the beginning or of the end of the present order 
of things; that no symptom of infancy or of old age has been allowed 
to appear outhe face of nature, nor any sign by which either the past 
or the future duration of the universe can be estimated; and that 
although the Creator may put an end, as he no doul)t gave a begin- 
ning, to the present system, such a catastrophe will not be brought 
about by any of the laws now existing, and is not indicated by anything 
which we i)er(;eive. This doctrine was naturally espoused with warmth 
by the extreme uniformitarian school, which required an unlimited 
duration of time for the accomplishment of such slow and quiet cycles 
of change as they conceived to be alone recogniza])le in the records of 
the earth's past histoiy. 

It was Lord Kelvin, who, in the writings to which I have already 
referred, first called attention to tlie fundamentally erroneous nature 
of these conceptions. He pointed out thar from the high internal tem- 
perature of our globe, increasing inwards as it does, and from the rate 
of loss of its heat, a limit may be fixed to the planet's antiquity. He 
showed that so far from there being no sign of a beginning, and no 
prospect of an end, to the present economy, every lineament of the 
solar system bears witness to a gradual dissipation of energy from some 
definite starting point. No very precise data were then, or indeed are 
now, available for computing the interval which has elapsed since that 
remote commencernent, but he estimated that the surface <^)f the globe 
could not have c(msolidated less than twenty millions of years ago, for 
the rate of increase of temi)erature inwards would in that case have 



GEOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND TLMK. ^'2') 

Ikhmi liijiher than it actually is; nor more than lour hundred millions of 
years aiio, for then there would ha\'e been no sensible increase at all. Me 
was inclined, Avhen lirst dealing with the subject, to believe that from 
a review of all the evidence then axailable, some such period as one 
hundred millious of years would eml)ra('e the whole geological history 
of the globe. 

It is iu)t a pleasant experience to discover that a fortune whicli one 
has unconcernedly believed to be ami)le has somehow taken to itself 
wings and disap])eared. When the geologist was siuldeidy awakened 
by the energetic warning of the physicist, who assured him that he had 
enormously overdrawn his account with past time, it was but n.atural 
under the circumstances that he shoidd think the accountant to be mis- 
taken, who thus returned to him dishonored the large drafts he had 
made on eternity. He saw how Avide were the limits of time deducible 
from physical considerations, how vague the data from which they had 
been calculated. And though he <-ould not help admitting that a limit 
nnist be fixed beyond whicjh his chronology could not be extended, he 
consoled himself Avith the rellection that after all a hundred millions of 
years was a tolerably ample period of time, and might i)ossibly have 
been quite sufflcieiit for the transaction of all the prolonged se(pience 
of events recorded in the crust of the earth. He Avas therefore dis- 
l)osed Ut accpiiesce in the limitation thus imposed upon geological his- 
tory. 

But ])hysical in»iuiry continued to be pushed forward with regaid to 
the early history and antiquity of the earth. Further consideration of 
the influence of tidal friction in retarding the earth's rotation, and of 
the sun's rate of cooling, led to sweeping reductions of the time allow- 
able for the evolution of the ])lanet. The geologist found himself in 
the plight of Lear when his bodyguard of 100 knights was cut down. 
"What need you flve-and-twenty, ten or five'?" demands the inex- 
orable physicist, as he remorselessly strikes slice after slice from his 
aUowance of geological time. Lord Kelvin is willing, I believe, to grant 
us some twenty Uiillions of years, but Professor Tait would have us 
content with less than ten nullions. 

In scientilic as in other nnindane questions there may often be two 
sides, and the truth nuiy ultiiimtely be found not to lie wholly with 
either. I frankly confess that the demands of the early geologists for 
an uidiiiuted series of ages were extravagant, and even, for their own 
l»urposes, unnecessary, and that the physicist did good service in re- 
ducing them. It may also be freel\ admitted that the latest conclu- 
sions from physical considerations of the extent of geological time re- 
quire that the interi)r(^ration given to the record of the rocks should 
b(! rigorously i<;vised, with the view of ascertaining lunv far that inter- 
])retalion may be capable of modification or amendment. l>ut we nuist 
also remeud)er that the geological record constitutes a voluminous body 
of eviden(;e regarding the earth's history which can not be ignored, and

must he expliiiiie<l in accoidauce with ascertained nntnral laws. If th& 
conclusions derived from the most careful study of this record can not 
be reconciled with those drawn from physical considiM'ations, it is surely 
not too much to ask that the latter should be also revised. It has been 
well said that the matheinatical mill is an admirable piece of machinery, 
but that. the value of what it yields depends upon the quality of what 
is put into it. That there nuist be some flaw in the physical ar,i>'ument 
I can, for my own ])art, hardly <loubl, though I do not i)retend to be 
able to say where it is to be found. ISome assumption, it seems to me,, 
has been made, or some consideration has been left out of sight, whicii 
will eventually be seen to ^■itiate the conclusions, and which when duly 
taken into account will allow time enough for any reasonable interpre- 
tation of the geological record. 

In problems of this nature, where geological data capable of nu- 
merical statement are so needful, it is hardly possible to obtain trust- 
worthy computations of time. We can only measure the rate of changes 
in progress now, and infer from these changes the length of time re- 
(piired for the completion of results achieved by the same processes in 
the past. There is fortunately one great cycle of movement which ad- 
mits of careful investigation, and which has been made to furnish val- 
uable materials for estimates of this kind. The universal degradation 
of the land, so notable a chara(?teristic of the earth's surface, has been 
regarded as an extrem(;ly slow process. Though it goes on witliout 
ceasing, yet from centuiy to century it seems to leave hardly any ])er- 
ceptible trace on the landscapes of a country. Mountains and plains, 
hills and valleys api)ear to wear the same familiar aspect which is 
indicated in the oldest pages of history. This obvious slowness in one 
of the most important dei)artmeuts of geological activity doubtless 
contributed in large measure to form and foster a vague belief in the 
vastness of the antiquity required for the evolution of the earth. 

But, as geologists eventually came to perceive, the rate of degrada- 
tion of the land is capable of actual measurement. The amount of 
material worn away from the surface of any drainage basin and carried 
in the form of nuid, sand, or gravel, by the main river into the sea 
represents the extent to which that surface has been lowered by waste 
in any given period of time. But denudation and deposition nuist be 
equivalent to each other. As much material must be laid down in sed- 
imentary accumulations as has been mechanically removed, so that in 
measuring the annual bulk of sediment borne into the sea by a river, 
we obtain a clue not only to the rate of denudation of the land, but also 
to the rate at which the deposition of new sedimentary formations takes 
place. 

As might be expected, the activities involved in the lowering of the 
surface of the land are not everywhere equally energetic. They are 
naturally more vigorous where the rainf\ill is heavy, where the daily 
range of temperature is large, and where frosts are severe. Hence they

Actual nieasuienient of tlu' proportion of sedinuMit in river water 
sliows that while in some cases the lowerin.i;- of the surface of the land 
may be as much as -.j„ of a foot in a year, in others it falls as low- 
as ,. J,,,,. In other words, tlio rate of dejiosition of new sedimentary 
formations, over an aica of sea Hoor eipiix alent to tliat wliieh has 
yielded the sediment, may vary fr<»m one foot in se\en hundred ani' 
thirty years to one foot in six thonsand eiiiht hundred years. 

I f now we take these lesults and apidy them as measurcvs of the leu'itu 
of time recjuircd fortiie dejXKsition of the \arions sedimentary masse.s 
that form the outer ])art of the earth's crust, we obtain some indication 
of the duration of geoh)gica] history. On a reasonabk' com])utation 
these stratilied masses, wliere most fully developed, attain a united 
thickness of not less than 100,()()() feet. If they were all laid down at 
the most rapid recorded rate of denudation, they would icquire a 
])eriod of seventy-three nullions of years for their completion. If they 
were laid down at the slowest rate they would denuind a jieriod of not 
less than six hundred and eij^hty millions. 

But it may be arjiued that all kinds of terrestrial energy are grow- 
iuii' feeble, that the most active denudation now in ])io,<;ress is nnich 
less vigorous than that of bygone ages, and hence that the stratified 
part of the earth's crust may have been put together in a. much briefer 
space of time than modern events might lead us to su])pose. Such 
arguments are easily adduced and look sufficiently si)ecious, but no 
contirmation of tliem can be gathered from the rocks. On the contrary, 
no one can thoughtfully study the various systems of stratitied forma- 
tions without being impressed by the fullness of their evidence that, on 
the whole, the accunndation of sediment has been extremely slow. 
Again and again Ave encounter groups of strata comi)osed of thin paj)er- 
like lamina' of the finest silt, which evidently settled down (juietly and 
at intervals on the sea bottom. We lind successive layers covered 
Avith rii)})le-marks and sun-cracks, and we recognize in them memorials 
of ancient shores where sand and nuid trauipiilly gathered as they do 
in sheltered estuaries at the ])resent(lay. >\'e can see no proof what- 
ever — nor e\en any evidence which suggests — that (mi the whole the rate 
of waste aiul sedimentation was more rapid during Mesozoic and l*ala'- 
ozoic time than it is to-day. Had there been any marked difference in 
this rate from ancient to modeiii times, it would be incredible that no 
clear proof of it should have licen ri'corded in the crust of the eaith. 

iJut in actual fact the testimony in faxor of the slow accumulation 

and high anticpiity of the geological lecord is much stiongei' than might 

be inferred from the mere thickiu'ss of the stratified formations. These 

I sedimentary depositshave not been laid down in one unbroken se(pience, 

but have had their continuity interrupted again and again by upheaval

easily (lemonstrate tlie leiigtli of time represented there by vstill exist- 
ing sedimentary strata to be a astly less tliaii the time indicated by the 
gaps in the series. 

There is yet a further and impressive body of evidence furnished by 
the successive races of plants and animals which have lived upon the 
earth and have left their remains sealed up within its rocky crust. No 
one now believes in the exploded doctrine that successive creations and 
universal destructions of organic life are chronicled in the stratitied 
roclvs. It is everywhere admitted that, from the remotest times up to 
the present day, there has been an onward march of development, type 
succeeding type in one long continuous progression. As to the rate of 
this evolution x>i'eeise data are wanting. There is however the im- 
portant negative argument furnished by the absence of evidence of 
recognizable speciiic variations of organic forms since man began to 
observe and record. We know that within human experience a few 
species have become extinct, but there is no conclusive proof that a 
single new species have come into existence, nor are appreciable 
variations readily apparent in forms that live in a wild state. The 
seeds and j^lants found with Egyptian mummies, and the flowers and 
fruits depicted on Egyptian tombs, are easily identitied with the vege- 
tation of modern Egypt. The embalmed bodies of animals found in 
that country show no sensible divergence from the structure or propor- 
tions of the same animals at the ])resenr day. The human races ot 
Northern Africa and Western Asia were already as distinct when i»or- 
trayed by the ancient Egy])tian artists as they are now, and they do 
not seem to have undergone any perceptible change since then. Thus 
a lajise of four or live thousand years has not been accomi)anied by any 
recognizable variation in such forms of plant and animal life as can be 
tendered in evidence. Absence of sensible change in these instances 
is, of course, no proof that considerable alteration may not have been 
accomplished in other forms more exposed to vicissitudes of climate 
and other external intiuences. But it furnishes at least a presumption 
in tinor of the extremely tardy progress of organic variation. 

If however we extend our vision beyond the narrow range of human 
history, and look at the remains of the plants and animals ])reservedin 
those younger formations which, though recent when regarded as parts 
of the whole geological record, must be many thousands of years older 
than the very oldest of human monuments, we encounter the most im- 
pi-essive proofs of the persistence of specific forms. Shells which lived 
in our seas before the coming of the Ice age present the very same 
peculiarities of form, structure, and ornament which their descendants 
still ])ossess. The lapse of so enormous an interval of time has not 
sufliced seriously to modify tliem. So too with the plants and the 
higher animals which still survive. Some forms have become extinct, 
)>ut few or none Avhich remain display any transitional gradations into

new s])ecies. We imist admit that such trausitious have occurred, that 
indeed they liave been in proj^ress ever since organized existence began 
upon our phmet, and arc doubtless talving phice now. But m'c can not 
detect them on the way, and we feel constrained to believe that their 
march must be excessively slow. 

There is no reason to think that the rate of organic evolution has 
ever seriously varied; at least no proof has been adduced of such va- 
riation. Taken in connection with the testimony of the sedimentary 
rocks, the inferences deducible from fossils entirely bear out the opinion 
that the building up of the stratified crust of the earth has been ex- 
tremely gradual. If the many thousands of years which have elapsed 
since the Ice age have produced no appreciable modification of sur- 
viving plants and animals, how vast a period must have been required 
for that marvellous scheme of organic development which is chronicled 
in the rocks! 

After careful reflection on the subject, I affirm that the geological 
record furnishes a mass of evidence which no arguments drawn from 
other departments of nature can explain away, and which, it seems to 
me, can not l)e satisfactorily interpreted save with an allowance of time 
much beyond the narrow limits which recent physical speculation would 
concede. 

1 have reserved for hnal consideration a branch of the history of the 
earth which, while it has become, within the lifetime of the present 
generation, one of the most interesting and fascinating departments of 
geological inquiry, owed its first impulse to the far-seeing intellects of 
Hutton and Playfair. \^"ith the i)enetration of genius these illustrious 
teachers perceived that if the broad nuisses of land and the great 
chains of mountains owe their origin to stupendous movements which 
from time to time have convulsed the earth, their details of contour 
nuist be mainly due to the eroding power of running water. They 
recognized tluit as the surface of the land is continually worn down, it 
is essentially by a [)r<)cess of scnl[)tnre that the physiognomy of exery 
country has l)een develoi)ed, valleys being hollowed out and hills left 
standing, and that these ineipmlities in topographical detail are only 
varying and local accidents in the progress of the one great i)rocess of 
the degredation of tlie land. 

From the broad and guiding outlines of theory tlius sketched we

lution is written as legibly on the landscapes of the earth as on any

origin, has gradually been developed aftei' many precedent mutations,

memorial of mauy successive stages iu geographical evolutiou. Within 
certain limits land and sea have changed places again and again. 
Volcanoes liave broken out and have become extinct in many countries 
long before the advent of man. Whole tribes of plants and animals 
have meanwhile come and gone, and in leaving their remains behind them 
as monuments at once of the slow development of organic types, and 
of the prolonged vicissitudes of the terrestrial surface, have furnished 
materials for a chronological arrangement of the earth's topographical 
features. Nor is it only from the organisms of former epochs that 
broad generalizations may be drawn regarding revolutions in geog- 
raphy. The living plants and animals of to-day have been discovered 
to be eloquent of ancient geographical features that have long since 
vanished. In their distribution they tell us that climateshave changed ; 
that islands have been disjoined from continents; that oceans once 
nnited have been divided from each other, or once separate have now 
been joined; that some tracts of land have disappeared, while others 
for prolonged periods of time have remained in isolation. The pres- 
ent and the past are thus linked together, not merely by dead matter, 
but by the world of living things, into one vast system of continuous 
progression. 

In this marvellous increase of knowledge regarding the transforma- 
tions of the earth's surface, one of the most impressive features, to my 
mind, is the power now given to us of perceiving the many striking 
contrasts between the present and former aspects of topography and 
scenery. We seem to be endowed with a new sense. What is seen by 
the bodily eye — mountain, valley, or plain — serves but as a veil, beyond 
which, as we raise it, visions of long-lost lands and seas rise before us 
in a far-retreating vista. Pictures of the most diverse and opposite 
character are beheld, as it were, through each other, their lineaments 
subtly interwoven, and even their most vivid contrasts subdued into 
one blended harmony. Like tlie poet, "we see, but not by sight alone;" 
and the "ray of fancy" which, as a sunbeam, lightened up his land- 
scape, is for us broadened and brightened by that play of the imagina- 
tion which science can so vividly excite and prolong. 

xVdmirable illustrations of this modern interpretation of scenery are 
sup])lied by the district wlierein we are now assembled. On every -side 
of us rise the most convincing proofs of the reality and potency of that 
ceaseless sculpture by which the elements of landscape have been carved 
into their present shapes. Turn where we inay, our eyes rest on hills 
that project above the lowland, not because they have been upheaved 
into these positions, but because their stubborn materials have enabled 
them better to withstand the degradation which has worn down the 
softer strata into the plains around them. Inch by inch the surface of 
the land has been lowered, and each hard rock successively laid bare has 
communicated its own characteristics of form and color to the scenery.

burgh, we aHow the bodily eye to wander over the lair landscape, and 
the mental vision to rau<it; through the long vista of earlier landscapes 
which science here reveals to us, what a strange series of i)ictures passes 
before our gaze ! The busy streets of to-day seem to fade away into the 
mingled copsewood and forest of pre-historic time. Lakes that have long 
since vanished gleam through the woodlands, and a rudecam)e pushing 
from the shore startles the red deer that had come to drink. While we 
look, the picture changes to a jxtlar scene, with bushes of stunted Arctic 
willow and birch, among which herds of reindeer browse and the huge 
mammoth makes his home. Thick sheets of snow are draped all over the 
hills around, and far to the northwest the distant gleam of glaciers and 
snowtields marks the line of the Highland mountains. As we muse (m 
this strange contrast to the living world of to day the scene appears to 
grow more Vrctic in aspect, until every hill is buried under one vast 
sheet of ice, 2,(»0() feet or more in thickness, which fills up the whole 
midland valley of Scotland and creeps slowly eastward into the basin of 
the North Sea. TTere the cuitain drops ujton our moving pageant, for 
in the geological record oi this })art of the country an enormous gap 
occurs before the coming of the Ice Age. 

When once moie the sjtectacle r(\sumes its movement the scene is 
found to ha\e utterly changed. The familiar hills and valleys of the 
Lothians have disapi)eared. Dense jungles of a strange vegetation — 
tall reeds, club mosses, and tree-ferns — spread over tlu^streamiug swam i»s 
that stretch for leagues in all directions. Broad lagoons and oi)en seas 
arc dotted with little voh'-anic cones which throw out their streams of 
lava and showers of ashes. Beyond these, in dimmer outline and older in 
date, we descry a wide lake or inland sea, covering the whole midland 
valley and marked witli long lines of acti\e volcanoes, some of them sev- 
eral thousand feet in height. And still furtlierand fainter over the same 
region, we may catch a giimjjse of that si ill earlier exj)anseof sea which 
in Siluiiaii times oversi)read most of Brifian. Butl)eyond this scene our 
vision fails, VV^e have reaclunl the limit across which no geological 
evidence exists to lead the imagination into the primeval darkness

CrEOLOGlOAL HISTOliY OF THE YELLOWSTONE 
NATIONAL PAKK.* 



By Arnold Hague, 

U. S. Geological Siirreii. 

In the short time allotted to me 1 can only liope to present a brief 
sketch of the main geological features of the country which you are 
about to visit. JNIy remarks must, of necessity, be more or less iucom- 
]3lete, as my desire is uot so much to elucidate any special problem 
connected with the many interesting geological questions to be found 
here, but rather to offer such a general view of the region as will 
enable you, during your live days' trip through the Park, to understand 
clearly something of its physical geogra])hy and geology. 

The Yellowstone Park is situated in the extreme northwestern por- 
lion of the Territory of Wyoming. Its boundaries, as determined by 
the original act of Congress setting apart the Park, are very ill- 
defined. At the time of the enactment of the law establishing this 
national reservation, the region had been but little explored, and its 
relation to the physical features of the adjacent country was but little 
nnderstood. Since that time, surveys have shown that only a narrow 
strip, about '2 miles in width, was situated in the Territory of Mon- 
tana, but it was also found that a still narrower strip extended west- 
ward into the Territory of Idaho. The question of ])roperly establish- 
ing the boundaries, based upon our present knowledge of the ccmntry, 
is now before Congress, and an act has already i)assed the Senate, pro- 
posing to make the northern boundary coincide with the boundary 
between Wyoming and Montana, and tlie western boundary coincide 
with the Wyoming and Idaho line. The act under consideration 
extends tlie soullu'rn Ixamdary of the Park to the 44th ])arallel of lati- 
tude, carrying the area of the reservation scmthward 9S miles. The 
eastern ])oundary is made to coincide Avith tlie meridian of 101)^ .'>0', 
adding a strq) of country about 24^ miles in width along the entire 
eastern side ol' Hie Park. 

The area ol" the Pai'k, as at present defined, is somewhat more than 
.'],3(K) s(piiire miles, and the projiosed addition increases the I'eservation

by nearly 2,0U0 snuaic. miles. The Fark plateau, with the adjacent 
mountains, presents a sharply defined region, in strong contrast with 
the rest of the northern Rocky Mountains. It stands out boldly by 
itself, unique in topogTaphical structure, and complete as a geological 
problem. 

The central portion of the Yellowstone l*ark is, essentially, a broad, 
elevated, volcanic plateau, between 7,000 and 8,500 feet above sea-level, 
and with an average elevation of about 8,000 feet. Surrounding it on 
the south, east, north, and northwest, are mountain ranges with culmi- 
nating peaks and ridges rising from 2,000 to 4,000 feet above the 
general level of the inclosed table-land. 

For present purposes it is needless to confine ourselves strictly to 
legal boundaries, but rather to consider the entire region in its broader 
physical features. It is worthy of note, however, that by the proposed 
enlargement the protected area will agree closely with the geographical 
province. 

South of the I'ark, the Tetons stand out prominently above the sur- 
rounding country, the highest, grandest peaks in the northern Rocky 
Mountains. The eastern face of this mountain mass rises with nn- 
riv^alled boldness for nearly 7,000 feet above Jackson Lake. I^i'orth- 
ward, the ridges fall away abruptly beneath the lavas of the Park, only 
the outlying spurs coming within the limits of the reservation. For the 
most part the mountains are made up of coarse crystalline gneisses and 
schists, probably of Archean age, flanked on the northern spurs by up 
turned Palieozoic strata. 

To the east, across the broad valley of the Upper Snake, generally 
known as Jackson Basin, lies the well-knowii Wind River Range, 
famous from the earliest days of the Rocky Mountain trappers. The 
Northern end of this range is largely composed of Mesozoic strata, 
single ridges of Cretaceous sandstone penetrating still farther north- 
ward into the regions of the Park, and protruding above the great 
flows of lava. 

Along the entire eastern side of the Park stretches the Absaroka 
Range — so-called from the Indian name of the Crow Nation. The 
Absaroka Range is intimately connected with the Wind River, the two 
being so closely related that any line of separation must be drawn 
more or less arbitrarily, based more upon geological structures and 
fo^ms of erosion than upon i^hysical limitations. 

The Absarokas offer, for more than 80 miles, a bold, unbroken bar- 
rier to all western progress; a rough, rugged country, dominated by 
high peaks and crags from 10,000 to 11,000 feet in height. Only a 
few adventurous hunters and mountaineers cross the range by one or 
two dangerous, precipitous trails known to but few. The early trap- 
pers found it a forbidding land; prospectors who followed them, a 
bnrren one. 

At the northeast corner of the Park a confused mass of mountains

coniu'cts the Absarokas with tlic Snowy Itaiijie. This Snowy Ranj;v 
shuts in the Park on the north, and is an c.iu;ill.\' roni;h r<^j;iou of conn 
tiy, with ek'N'atcd mount -liu luasscs coNcred with snow tlio jiieater part 
ot the year, ;is tlie nanu' wouhl indicate. Only tlie southern sh)pes, 
wliieli rim in the I'ark I'egion, come within the limit of our investiga- 
tion. Here the roidcs are mainly granites, gneisses, and schists, the 
sedinu-ntary beds, for the most part, referable to the pre-( 'and)rian 
series. 

The Galhitin Range incloses the Park on the north and northwest. 
It lies directly west of the Snowy, only separated by the broad valley 
of the Yellowstone River. It is a range of great beauty, of diversified 
forms, and varied geological problems. Electric Peak, lu the extreme 
ncH'th western corner of the Park, is the culminating ])oint in the range, 
and affords one of the most extended views to be found in this part of 
the country. Archean gneisses form a prominent mass in the range 
over which occur a series of sandstones, limestones, and shales, of Pale- 
ozoic and Meso/oic age, representing Cambrian, Silurian, Devonian, 
Carboniferous, Trias, Jura, and Cretaceous. Immediately associated 
with these sedimentary beds, are large misses of intrusive rocks, 
which hav^e played an important part in bringing about the present 
structural features of the range, Tiiey are all of the andesitic t^'jie, 
but sliowing considerable range in mineral composition, including 
]>yroxene, hornblende, and hornblende mi(;a varieties. These intrusive 
masses are f)unil in narrow dikes, in immense interbedded sheets 
forced between the different strata, and as laccolites, a mode of occur- 
rence first described from the Henry Mountains in Utah, by Mr. G. K. 
CJilbert, but now well recognized elsewhere in the northern Cordillera. 

We see then tiiat the Absarokas rise as a formidable barrier on the 
eastern sid(^ of tiie Park, the Gallatins as a steep mural face on the 
west side, while the other ranges terminate ai>ru]>tly, rimming in the 
Park on the north and south, and le iving a depressed region not unlike 
llu; parks of Colorado, only covering a. more extended area with a rela- 
tively deeper basin. The region has been one of profound dynamic 
action, and tlic center of mountain building on a grand scale. On the 
accompanying map of the Yellowstone Park, which shows the position 
of the princii)al o!))ects of interest, the relations of the ranges to the 
plateau are clearly indicated. 

It is not my purpose at the present time to enter u]>()n the details of 
ge:)logical structure oftln^se ranges, each offering its own special study 
and field of investigation. My desire is simi)ly to call your attention 
to their general features and mutual relations. So far as their age is 
concerned, evidence goes to show that the action of upheaval was con- 
temporaneous in all of them, and coincident wMth the powerful dy- 
namic movements wliich uplifted the north and south ranges, stretch- 
ing across (Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana. This dynamic move- 
ment blocked out, for the most part, the Rocky Mountains, near the

in this region profound fanlting and displacement continued the work

burst; indeed the region may be considered long since extinct. These 
volcanic rocks present a wide range in chemical and mineral composi- 
ticm and jdiysical structure. They may all however be classed under 
three great groups — andesites, rhyolites, and basalts — following each 
other in the order named. In some instances, erupti<ms of basalt oc- 
curred before the complete extinction of rhyolite, but in general, the 
relative ageof eaeh group is clearly and sharply defined, the distribu- 
tion and mode of occurrence of each presenting characteristics and 
salient features frequently marked by periods of erosion. 

Andesites are the only volcanic rocks which have i)layed an impor- 
tant part in ])roducing the present structural features of the moun- 
tains surrounding the Park. As already mentioned, they occur in 
large masses in the Gallatin range, while most of the culminating 
peaks in the .Absarokas are composed of compact andesites and ande- 
sitic breccias. On the other hand, the andesites are not confined to the 
mountains, but played an active role in filling up the interior basin. 
That the duration of the andesitic eruptions was long continued, is 
made evident by the plant-remains found in ash and lava beds thnmgh 
2,000 feet of volcanic material. The plants have as yet been too little 
studied to define positively their geological horizons. It is quite pos- 
sible that they may indicate marked differences of climate between the 
lower and upper beds. 

In early Tertiary times, a volcano Durst forth in the northeast cor- 
ner of the depressed area encircled by the Park Mountains, not far 
ft"om the junction of the Absaroka and tSnowy ranges. While not to 
to be compared in size and grandeur with the volcanoes of California 
and the Cascade Ivange, it is, for the Rocky ^lountains, one of no mean 
proportions. It rises from a base about (),500 feet above sea-level, the 
culminating peak attaining an elevation of 10,000 feet. This gives a 
height to the voh-anoof 8,.500 feet from base to summit, measuring from 
the Arcluean rocks of the Yellowstone Valley to the top of Mount Wash- 
burne. The average height of the crater rim is about 9,000 feet above 
sea level, t\w volcano measuring 15 miles across the base. The erup- 
tive origin of AFount Washburne has long been reciognized, and it is 
frequently referred to as a volcano. It is however simi)ly the highest 
peak among several others, and re])resents a later outburst which de- 
stroyed in a measure the original rim and Ibrm of the older crater. The 
eruptions for the most part were basic andesites. Erosion has so worn 
away the earlier rocks, and enormtms masses of more recent lavas 
have so obscured the original form of lava-tlows, that it is not easy for 
an inexperienced eye to recognize a volcano and the surrounding ])eaks 
as the more elevated points in a grand cratei- wall. By following 
around on the ancient andesitic rim, and studying the outline of the 
old crater, together with the <-omi»osition of its lavas, its true origin 
and history may readily be ma<le out. This older crater has as yet 
received no special designation. l)ut when our maps and reports are 
finally published, this ancient geological ruin will receive an approjiriate

dcsigiuitioii. This old volcano of early Tertiary time occupies a prom- 
inent place in the geolo<;ical deve]o])iiient of the Park, and dates back 
to the earliest outbursts of lava which have in this region changed a 
depressed basin into an elevated plateau. We have here a volcano 
situated far inland, in an elevated region, in the heart of the Rocky 
Mountains. It lies on the eastern side of the continent, only a few 
. miles from the great continental divide which sends its waters to both 
the Atlantic and Pacific. 

After the dying out of the andesitic lavas, followed by a period of 
erosion, immense volumes of rhyolite were eruj)ted, which not only 
threatened to fill uj) the crater but to bury the outer walls of the vol- 
cano. On all sides the andesitic slopes were submerged beneath the 
rhyolite to a lieight of from 8,0()() to S,500 feet. This enormous mass 
of , rhyolite, poured out after the close of the andesitic period, did more 
than anything else to bring about the present physical features of the 
Park table-land, A tourist inaking the customary trip through the 
I'ark, visiting all the prominent geyser basins, hot si:»rings, and the 
Grand Canon and Falls of the Yellowstone, is not likely to come upon 
any other rock than rhyolite, excepting, of course, deposits from the 
hot springs. If he extended his journey to the lake region, taking in 
Shoshone, Lewis, and Yellowstone lakes, and spending a week or ten 
days going over the beaten routes of travel, he will not, unless he as- 
cends Mount Washburne, leave the rhyolite lavas. A description of 
the rhyolite region is essentially one of the Park plateau. Taking the 
bottom of the basin at 6,500 feet a,bove sea level, these acidic lavas 
were piled up until the accumulated mass measured 2,000 feet in thick- 
ness. It completely encircled the Gallatin Range, burying its lower 
slopes on both the east and west sides; it banked up all along the west 
Hanks of the Absarokas, and buried the outlying spurs of the Teton 
and Wind River ranges. 

The Park Plateau covers an area approximately 50 by 40 miles, with 
a mean altitude of 8,000 feet. It is accidented by undulating basins of 
^•Hried outline and scored by deep canyons and gorges. Strictly speak- 
ing it is not a i)lateau; at least it is by no means a level area, but a rug- 
ged country, characterized by bold escarpments and abrupt edges of 
mesa-like ridges. But few large vents or centers of volcanic activity 
for the rhyolite have been recognized, the two princii)al sources being 
the volcano to which reference has already been made, and- Mount 
Sheridan in the southern end of the Park, Mount Sheridan is the 
most commanding peak on the plateau, with an elevation 10,200 feet 
above sea level and 2,000 feet above Heart Lake. From the summit of the 
l)eak on a clear day one may overlook the entire plateau country and the 
mountains which shut it in, while almost at the base of the peak lie the 
magnificent lakes which add so much to the quiet beauty of the region, in 
contrast with the rugged scenery of the mountains. From no point is the 
magnitude and grandeur of the volcanic region so impressive. The lava- 
flows — bounded on the east by the Absarokas — extend westward not

In the Uiand C'anon of the Yellowstone the andesitic breccias are found 
beneath the rliyolites, but the deepest cuts fail to reveal the underly- 
ing sedimentary beds. Although the rocks of the jdatean for the most 
])art l)elong to one group of acidic Ia\as, they by no nn'ans present tlie 
great uniformity and monotony in Held appearance that might be ex- 
pected. These 2,0(K> scpiare miles ofler as grand a iield for the study of 
structural forms, develoi)ment of crystallization, and mode of occurrence 
of acidic lavas as could well be found aiiywliere in tlie world. They 
vary from a nearly holocrystalline rock to one of pure volcanic glass. 
Obsidian, pumice, pitchstone, ash, ])reccia, and an endless development 
of transition forms alternate with the more conii)act lithoidal lavas 
which make up the great mass of the rhyolite, and wiiich in colors, 
texture, and structural developments i)i'esent an equally varied aspect. 
In mineral conii)ositi(ui these rock are simple enough. The essential 
nunerals are orthoclase and (inartz, with more or less plagioclase. 
Sanidine is the prevailing feldspar, although in many cases plagioclase 
forms occur nearly as abundantly as ortlioclase. Ohemical analyses, 
whether we consider the rocks from the crater of Mount Sheridan, the 
summit of the plateau, oi- the volcanic glass of the woild-renowned 
Obsidian Cliff, present comparatively slight differences in ultimate com- 
position.

140 GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE YELLOWSTONE PARK. 

The rock from Madison Plateau was collected on the north side of 
Madison Canyon and was selected as a typical rock coYerin<>' large areas 
of the Park. It is purplish-gray in color, rough in texture, porphy- 
ritic in structure, and characterized by well-developed sanidin and 
quartz. The obsidian, from Obsidian Cliif, is an excellent example of 
pure volcanic glass, wholly devoid of porphyritic crystals. In general 
the investigations of the laboratory confirm the observations of the 
field geologist, that the differences exhibited by the volcanic i)roduct are 
not of cliemical or mineral composition, but rather of physical con- 
ditions under which the magma has cooled. 

I have dwelt suinewhat in detail upon tlie nature of these rocks for 
two reasons: First, because of the dififtculty met with by the scientific 
traveller in recognizing the uniformity and simplicity of chemical com- 
position of the rhyolite magma over the entire i)lateau, owing to its 
great diversity in superficial habit; second, on account of their geolog- 
ical importance in connection with the unrivalled display of the gey- 
sers and hot springs. Tliat the energy of tlie steam and thermal 
waters dates well back into the period of volcanic action, there is in 
my opinion very little reason to doubt. As the energy of this under- 
ground heat is to day one of the most impressive features of the 
country, I will defer commenting upon the geysers and hot springs 
until speaking of the present condition of the Park. 

Although the rhyolite ernptions were probably of long duration and 
died out slowly, there is, I think, evidence to show that they occupied 
a clearly and sharply defined period between the andesites and basalt 
eruptions. Sin(;e the outpouring of this enormous body of rhyolite 
and building up of tlie plateau the region has undergone profound 
faulting and displacement, lifting up bodily immense blocks of lava 
and modifying the surface features of the country. Following the rhy- 
olite came the period of basalt eruptions, which, in comparison with 
the andesite and rhyolite eras, w^as, so far as the Park was con- 
cerned, insignificant, both as regards the area covered by the basalt 
and its influence in modifying the physical aspect of the region. The 
basalt occurs as thin sheets overlying the rhyolite and in some 
instances as dikes cutting the more acidic rocks. It has broken out 
near the outer edge of the rhyolite body and occurs most frequently 
along the Yellowstone Valley, along the western foothills of the Gal- 
latin Eange and Madison Plateau, and again to the southward of the 
Falls River basin. 

After the greater part of the basalt had been poured out came the 
ghicial ice, which widened and deepened the pre-existing drainage 
channels, cut profound gorges through the rhyolite lavas and 'modelled 
tlie two volcanos into their present form. Over the greater part of the 
Cordillera of the central and northern Rocky Mountains wherever the 
peaks attain a suCQcieutly high altitude to attract the moisture-laden 
clouds evidences of the former existence of local glaciers are to be

found. lu the Teton Range several well-dettiied cliaracteristic glaciers 
still (>xist u]><)ntlio abrupt slopes of Mount Haj'den and Mount JMoran. 
They are the remnants of a much larger system of glaciers. Tlie Park 
region i)reseuts so broad a. mass of elevated country that the entire 
plateau was, in glacial times, covered with a heavy capping of ice. 
Evidences of glacial action are everywhere to be seen. 

Over the Absaroka Range glaciers were forced down into the Lamar 
and Yeirowstone valleys, thence westward over the top of Mount Evarts 
to the Mammoth Hot Springs Basin. On the opposite side of the Park 
the ice from the summit of the Gallatin Range moved eastward across 
Swan Valley and passing over the top of Terrace Mountain joined the 
ice fiehl coming from the east. The united ice sheet plowed its way 
northu'ard down tiie valley of the Gardiner to tlie Lower Yellowstone, 
where the broad valley may be seen strewn with the material trans- 
ported from l)oth the east and west rims of the Park. 

Since the dying out of the rliyolite eruptions erosion has greatly 
moditied the entire surface features of the Park. Some idea of the ex- 
tent of this action may be realized when it is recalled that the deep 
cafions of the Yellowstone, Gibbon and Madison rivers — canons in the 
strictest use of the word — have all been carved out since that time. 
To-day these gorges measure several miles in length and from 1,000 to 
1,500 feet in depth. 

To the geologist one of the most impressive objects on the Park 
l)lateau is a transported bowlder of granite which rests directly upon 
the rliyolite near the brink of the (rrand Canon, about 3 miles beh)w the 
Falls of the Yellowstone. It stands alone in the forest, miles from the 
nearest glacial bowlder. Glacial detritus carrying granitic material 
may be traced upon both sides of the canon wall, but not a fragment 
of rock more than a few inches in diameter, older than the recent lavas, 
lijjs been recognized within a radius of many miles. This massive 
block, although irregular in shape and somewhat pointed toward the 
top, measures 24 feet in length by 20 feet in breadth and stands 18 feet 
above the base. The nearest point from which it could have been trans- 
]»orted is distant 30 or 40 miles. (Joining upon it in the solitude of the 
forest with all its strange, surroundings it tells a most impressive story. 
lu no ])lace are the evidences of frost and lire brought so forcibly to- 
gether as in the Yellowstone National Park. 

Since the close of the ice ]>eriod no geological events of any moment 
have brought about any changes in the physical history of the region 
other than those produced by the direct action of steam and thermal 
waters. A few insigniticant eruptions have probably occurred, but 
they failed to modify the broad outlines of topographical structure and 
present but little of general interest beyond the evidence of the con- 
tinuance <d" volcanii; action into <[uaternary times. Volcanic activity 
in the Park maybe considered as long since extinct. At all events in- 
dications of fresh lava-tiows within historical times are wholly want-

iiig". This is not without interest, as evidence of uudei-gTouud heat 
may be observed everywhere throughout the Park in the waters of the 
geysers and hot springs. All our observations point in one direction 
and lead to the theory that the cause of the high temperatures of these 
waters must be found in the heated rocks below, and that the origin of 
the heat is in some way associated with the source of volcanic energy. It 
by no means follows that the waters themselves are derived from any 
deep-seated source; on the contrary, investigation tends to show that 
the waters brought up by the geysers and hot springs are mainly sur- 
face waters which have percolated downward a sufficient distance to 
become heated by large volumes of steam ascending through fissures 
and vents from much greater depths. If this theory is the correct one 
it is but fair to demand that evidence of long-continued action of hot 
waters and super-heated steam should be apparent upon the rocks 
through which they passed on their way to the surface. This is pre- 
cisely what one sees in innumerable places on the Park plateau. In- 
deed, the decomposition of the lavas of the rhyolite plateau have pro- 
ceeded on a most gigantic scale, and could only have taken place after 
the lapse of an enormous period of time and the giving off of vast 
quantities of heat, if we are to judge at all by what we see going on 
around us to-day. The ascending currents of steam and hot water 
have been powerful geological agents, and have left an indelible im- 
pression upon the surface -of the county. The most striking example 
of this action is found in the Grand Canon of the Yellowstone. From 
the lower falls for o miles down the river abrupt walls upon both 
sides of the canon, a thousand feet in de]Dth, pri'seut a brilliancy and 
mingling of color beyond the power of description. From the brink of 
the canon to the water's edge the walls are sheer bodies of decomposed 
rhyolite. Varied hues of orange, red, purple, and sulphur-yellow are 
irregularly blended in one confused mass. There is scarcely a piece of 
unaltered rock in place. Much of it is changed into kaolin; but from 
rhyolite, still easily recognized, occur tiansition products of every pos- 
sible kind to good jjrocelain clay. This is the result of the long- con- 
tinued action of steam and vapors upon the rhyolite lavas. Through 
this nuiss of decomposed rhyolite the course of ancient steam vents in 
their upward passage may still be traced, while at the bottom of the 
canon hot springs, fumaroles, and steam vents are still more or less 
active, but probably with diminished power. 

It is needless to weary you with the details of this decomposition, 
but I may add that investigations in the laboratory upon these tran- 
sition products fully substantiate field observations. 

Still other areas are quite as convincing, if not on so grand a scale, 
as the Yellowstone Canon. Joseph's Coat Basin, on the east side of 
the canon, and Brimstone Hills, on tin; east side of the Yellowstone 
Lake, an extensive area on the slopes of the Absaroka Eange, both 
present evidences of the same chemical processes brought about in the

saiiu' luaniier. It is not statiiij;- it too stioiigly to say tliat the plateau on 
the east side of the (irand Canon, from Uroad (Jreeiv to Telican Creek, 
is eoni])letely undermined by the action of superheated steam and 
alkaline waters on the rhyolite lava. Simihir processes may be seen 
ijoing- on to-day in all the geyser basins. To accomplish these changes 
a long period of time must have been recpiired. The study of com- 
paratixely fresii vents shows almost no change from year to year, al- 
though careful scrutiny during a period of tive years detects a certain 
amount of disintegration, bnt infinitely small in comparison with the 
great bo<lies of altered rock. This is well shown in a locality like the 
Monarch Geyser in the iSTorris Geyser Basin, where the water is thrown 
out at regular intervals through a narrow fissure in the rock. 

The Grand Canon of the Yellowstone otters one of the most impres- 
sive examples of erosion on a grand scale within recent geological 
times. It is self-evident that the deep canon must be of much later 
origin than the rock through whicih it has been worn, and it seems 
(piite clear that the course and outlines of the canon were in great part 
determined by the easily eroded decomposed material forming the 
canon walls, and this in turn was brought about by the slow processes 
just described. 

The evidence of the anti(iuity of the hot spring deposits is, perhaps, 
showji in an equally striking manner and by a wholly ditterent proc- 
ess of geological reasoning. Terrace Mountain is an outlying ridge of 
the rhyohte plateau just west of the Mammoth Hot S])rings. It is 
covered on the summit with thick beds of travertine, among the eldest 
portions of the Mammoth Hot Springs deposits. It is the mode of 
occurrence of these calcareous deposits from the hot waters which 
has given the name to the mountain. Lying upon the surface of 
this travertine on the top of the mountain are found glacial bowlders 
brought from the summit of the Gallatin Range, fifteen miles away, 
and transported on the ice sheet across Swan Valley and deposited 
on the top of the mountain, TOO ieet above the intervening valley. It 
offers the strongest possible evidence that the traveitine is older than 
the glacier which has strewn the country with transported material. 
How much travertine was eroded by the ice is, of course, impossible to 
say, bnt so friable a material would yield readily to glacial movement. 

Still another method of arriving at the great anti(iuit>- of the thermal 
energy and the age of the hot spring foimation is by determining the 
rate of deposition and measuring the thickness of the accumulated 
sinter. This method, although the one which would perhaps first sug- 
gest itself, is in my opinion by no means as satisfactory as the geo- 
logical reasoning already given. It is unsatisfactory because no uni- 
form rate of dei)osition can be ascertained for even a single area, like 
the r))])er Geyser Basin, audit is still more dilficult to arrive at any 
conclusion as to the growth of the sinter in the past. Moreover, it is 
quite possible that heavy deposits may have suftered erosion before the 



144 GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OE THE YELLOWSTONE PARK. 

present sinter was laid down. It however corroborates other meth- 
ods and possesses the advantage of being a direct way. 

It may be well to add here that there exists the greatest contrast 
between the deposits of the Mammoth Hot Springs and those found 
upon the plateau. At the Mammoth Springs they are nearly ])\\ve 
travertine, with only a trace of silica, analyses showing from 95 to 99 
per cent of calcium carbonate. On the plateau, the deposits consist 
for the most part of siliceous sinter, locally termed "geyserite." The 
reason for the difference is this : At the Mammoth Hot Springs the 
steam, although ascending from fissures in the igneous rock, comes in 
contact with the waters found in the Mesozoic strata, which here form 
the surface rocks. The Jura or Cretaceous limestones liave furuished 
the lime held in solution and precipitated on the surface as travertine. 
On the other hand, the mineral constituents of the plateau waters are 
derived almost exclusively from the highly acidic lavas, which, as it 
will be seen by reference to the analyses, carry but a small amount of 
lime. 

Deposition of sinter from the hot waters of the geyser basins de- 
pends in a great measure on the amount of silica held in solution, 
which varies considerably at the different localities and may have 
varied still more in past time. The silica, as determined by analyses, 
ranges from .22 to .60 grammes per kilogramme of water, the former 
being the amount found in the water of the caldron of the Excelsior 
Geyser and the latter at the Coral Spring in the I^Torris Basin. Analysis 
shows that from one-fifth to one-tliird of the mineral matter held in so- 
lution consists of silica, the remaining constituents being readily solu 
ble salts carried off by surface drainage. A few springs highly charged 
with silica, like the Coral, deposit it on the cooling of the waters; but 
such springs however are exceptional, and I do not recall a single in- 
stance of a spring in the Upper Geyser Basin precipitating silica in this 
way. At most springs and geysers it results only after evaporation, 
and not from mere cooling of the water. It seems probable thai the 
nature and amount of alkaline chlorides and carbonates present influ- 
ence the separation of silica. Temperature ■ also may in some degree 
infiueuce the deposition. My friend, Mr. Elwood Hofer, one of the best 
guides to this region and a keen observer of nature, has called my 
attention to an observation of his made in mid-winter, while on one of 
his snow-shoe trips through the Park. He noticed that certain over- 
flow jjools of spring water, upon being frozen, deposited a considerable 
amount of mineral matter. He has sent me specimens of this material, 
which, upon examination, proved to be identical with the silica depos- 
ited from the Coi al Spring upon thecoolingof the water. Demijohns of 
gej'ser water which have been standing for one or two years have failed 
to precipitate any silica. Quite rei-ently, in experimenting n\)on these 
M'aters in the laboratory, it was noticed that on reducing them nearly 
to the freezing point no change took place, but upon freezing the waters 



GEOLOGICAL HISTOKV OV THE YELLOWSTONE PARK. 145 

there was iiii abmulant sepaiatioii of tVec silica. The waters frozen in 
this way Avere eoHeeted from the ('oral Spriiiy, Norris r>asiii, and the 
Taurus (Tcyser, Shoshone Basin. 

Ag'ain, there is no (h)ul»t that the al,ii'ous growths found th»urishing 
in the hot waters of the Park favor the secretion of silica and exert an 
iutluenee in buildiug* np the geyserite far greater than one would at 
tirst be led to suppose. These low forms of vegetable life occur in 
nearly all ])ools, springs, and running waters, up to a temperature of 
185° F. (only lo° beh)w the boiling point), at the Upper (Jeyser Basin. 
If time permitted, much might b(i said on this subject. I will only add 
that Mr. Walter PI. Weed, in eonnection with his other duties on the 
Geological Survey, has devoted much tiuje to a study of these algous 
growths, and the results of his investigations will form an important 
chapter in the linal publications. 

Several methods have been devised for ascertaining the growth of 
deposition of the geyserite. One way is by allowing the water to 
trickle over twigs, dried grasses, or almost anything exposing consid- 
erable surface, and noting the amount of incrustation. This way 
gives the most rapid results, but is far from satisfactory and by no 
means reproduces the conditions existing in nature. Other methods 
employed are i)lacing obje(;ts on the surface of the water or, still 
better, partially submerging them in the hot ])ools, or again by allow- 
ing the water to run down an inclined plane with frequent intervals 
for evaporation and concentration. 

The vaiulals who deliglit to inscribe their names in publi<' places 
have invaded the geyser basins in large numbers and left their 
addresses upon the geyserite in various places. It is interesting to 
note how ([uickly these inscriptions beconu' indelible by the deposition 
of the merest lilm of silica upon the lead-Dcncil marks, and, at the 
same time, how sh)wly they build up. Names and dates known to be 
six and eight years old remain ])erfcctly legil)h', and still retain the 
coh)r and luster of the graphite. That there is some increase in the 
thickness of the incrustation is evident, although it grows with 
incredil)le slowness. Mr. Weed tells me that he has been able, in at 
least oiu', instancM', to chip olf this siliceous tilm and reproduce the 
writing with all its original distinctness, showing conclusively that a 
slow deposition has taken place. I*encil inscriptions upon the sili- 
ceous sinter at llotomahana Lake, in New Zealand, are said to be 
legible after th(^ hi))se of twenty or thirty years. It is easy to see 
that various ingenious <levices might be planned to estimate the rate 
of dei)osition, ])ut in my oj)inion none of them e(pial a close study 
of the conditions found in nature, especially wheie investigations of 
this kind can be watched from year to year. All observations show 
an exceedingly slow building up of the geyserite formation. Tiiis is 
Avell seen in the repair going on where the rims snri'ounding tlu^ hot 
pools have been broken down, and where it might be supposed that 
H. Mis. 114 10 



146 GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE YELLOWSTONE PARK. 

the building-up process was under the most favorable conditions; yet, 
in a. number of instances, I can see no appreciable change in three or 
four years. Ile-visiting hot springs in out-of-the-way places after 
several years' absence, I am surprised to see that objects that I had 
noted carefully at the time remain unchanged. Taking the entire 
area of the Ui)per Geyser Basin covered by sinter, I believe that the 
development of the deposit does not exceed one-thirtieth of an inch a 
year, and this estimate I believe to be much nearer the maximum than 
the minimum rate of growth. The thickness of the geyserite has 
never been ascertained; the greatest thickness measured is 70 feet, 
the depth reached in the conduit of Old Faithful geyser, without 
meeting any obstruction. Supposing the deposit around the Castle 
geyser to have been built up with the same slowness as observed 
to-day, and assuming it to grow at the rate given — one-thirtieth of 
an inch a year--it would re(|uire over twenty-flve thousand years to 
reach its i)resent development. This gives us a great antiquity for the 
geyserite, but I believe that the deposition of the siliceous sinter in 
the Park has been goi/ig on for a still longer period of time. It is 
certain that the decomposition of the rhyolite of the plateau dates 
still further back. 

From a geological j)oint of view, there is abundant evidence that ther- 
mal energy is gradually becoming extinct. Tourists re-visiting the Park 
after an absence of two or three years occasionally allude to the springs 
and geysers as being less active than formerly and as showing indica- 
tions of rapidly dying out. It is true that slight changes are con- 
stantly taking place, that certain springs become extinct or discharge 
less water, but this action is fully counterbalanced by increased activity 
in other localities. Close examination of the source of the thermal 
waters fails to detect any diminution in the supply. Moreover, it stands 
to reason that if the flow of these waters dated — geologically sY)eaking — 
far back into the i)ast, the few years embraced within the historical 
records of the Park would be unable to indicate any i)erceptible change 
based upon a gradual diminution of the heat.* Accurate descriptions 
of the region go back only to 1871, the year of the first exploration by 
Dr. F. V. Hay den. 

The number of geysers, hot springs, mud-i3ots, and paint-pots scat- 
tered over the Park exceeds o,.")00, and if to these be added the fumaroles 
and solfataras from which issue in the aggregate enormous volnmes of 
steam and acid and sulphur vapors, the number of active vents would 
in all in-obability be doubled. Each one of these vents is a center of 
decomposition of the acid lavas. In the four principal geyser basins the 
geysers in action — or known to have been active within the past sixteen 
years — nnmbered 84. The following list comprises all the geysers that 
are known in the Norris, Lower, Midway, and Upper Geyser Basins.

They are all siliceous alkaline waters lioldiiig' the same mineral con 
stituents, but in varying qnautities. SiHca forms the principal deposit 
not only immediately around the springs, but over the entire floor of 
the basins. The carbonates, sulphates, chlorides, and traces of other 
easily soluble salts are carried off in the waters. Oxides of iron and 
manganese and occasionally some calcite occur under certain condi- 
tions in the cauldrons of the hot springs or immediately around their 
vents. Concentrations from large quantities of these waters tail to 
show the presence of even a trace of copper, silver, tin or other metal. 
Nearly all the waters carry arsenic, the amount present, according to 
Messrs. Gooch and Whitfield, varying from .02 to .25 per cent of tbe 
mineral matter in solution. 

Among the incrustations found at several of the hot springs and 
geysers is a leek-green amorphous mineral, which proves on investiga- 
tion to bescorodite, a hydrous arseniate of iron. The best occurrence 
observed is at Joseph's Coat Springs, on the east side of the Grand 
Canon of the Yellowstone, where it occurs as a coating upon tlie sili- 
ceous sinter lining the cauldron of a boiling spring. Analysis shows

Alteration of the scorodite into linionite takes place i-eadily, which 
in turn nnderi;«>es disintegration by the wea-rini;- of the water, and is 
mechanically carried away. So far as I know this is the only occur- 
rence where scorodite has been recognized as deposited from the 
waters of thermal si)rings. Although i)ure scorodite is only sparingly 
preserved at a few localities in the Yellowstone Park, it is easily recog- 
nized by its characteristic green color, in strong- contrast with the 
white geyserite and yellow and red oxides of iron. After a little 
piactice the mineral green of scoro<lite is not easily mistaken for the 
vegetable green of the algeous growths. The latter is associated every- 
where with the hot waters, while the former, an exceedingly rare min- 
eral, is obtained only in small quantities after diligent search. In 
xVmerica traces of arsenic have been reported from several springs in 
Virginia, and quite recently sodium arseniate has been detected in the 
hot s])rings of Ashe County, N. C. Arsenical waters of sufticient 
strength to be beneficial for remedial purposes and not otherwise 
deleterious ai'e of rare occurrence. In France the curative properties 
of aisenical waters have long been recognize<l, and the famons sani- 
taiiuni of La Ijourbonle in the volcanic district of tlu^ Auvergne has 
achiexed a wide reputation for the el'licacy of its waters in certain 
tbrins of nervous diseases. Ilygeia Springs, supplying the bath houses 
at the hotel in the Lower Oeyser Basin, carries .'.i of a grain of sodium 
arseniate to the gallon. The Yellowstone Park waters, while they 
carry somewhat less arsenic than those of La I>ourboide, greatly excel 
the latter in their enormous overflow. It is stated that the entire 
discharge from the sjjrings of La Bourboule, amounts to 1,500 gallons 
per minute. The amount of hot water brought to the surface by the 
hot springs throughout the ])ark is by no means easily determined, 
although during the i)rogress of our investigations we hope to make 
an approximate estimate. Some idea of the amount of hot water 
bionght to the surface ami carried off by the great drainage channels 
may b*; tbrmed at the Midway Basin. According to the most accurate 
measurements which could be made, the discharge from the caldron 
of the Excelsior Geyser into the Firehole Kiver during the pa-st sea- 
son amounted to 4, 100 gallons of boiling water ])er minute, and there 
is no evidence that this amount has \aried within the last two or three 
years. The sample of the Excelsior Geyser winter collected August 
25, 1884, yielde<l .19 grains of sodium arseniati^ to the gallon. It is 
impossible to say as yet what curative i)roi)erties these park waters

may possess in alleviating' the ills of mankind. Nothiug but an 
extended experience under proper medical supervision can determine. 
I may say that no hot si)riuys with which I am acquainted prove so 
delightful for bathing purposes and so agreeable in their action upon 
the skin. 

Changes modifying the surface features of the park in recent times 
are mainly those brought about by the tilling ui> with detrital material 
from the mountains, the valleys and depressions worn out by glacial ice, 
and those produced by the prevailing climatic conditions. Between the 
park country and what is known as the arid regions of the West there 
is the greatest possible contrast. Across the park plateau and the 
Absaroka range the country presents a continuous mountain mass 
75 miles in width, with an average elevation unsurpassed by any area 
of equal extent in the northern Eocky Mountains. It is exceptionally 
situated to collect the moisture-laden clouds, which coming from the 
southwest precipitate immense quantities of snow and rain upon the 
cooled table-land and neighboring mountains. The climate in many 
respects is quite unlike that found in the adjacent country, as is 
shown by the meteorological records, the amount of snow and rainlall 
being higher, and the mean annual temperature lower. Eain storms 
occur frequently throughout the summer, while snow is quite likely to 
fall any time between September and May. Protected by the forests 
the deep snows of winter lie upon the plateau well into mid-summer, 
while at still higher altitudes, in sheltered places, it remains throughout 
the year. By its topographical structure the park is designed by 
nature as a reservoir for receiving, storing, and distril)uting an excep- 
tional water supply, unexcelled by any area near the head-waters of the 
great continental rivers. The Continental Divide, separating the 
waters of the Atlantic from those of the Pacific, crosses the park 
plateau from southeast to northwest. On both sides of this divide lie 
several large bodies of water which form so marked a future in the 
scenery of the plateau that the region has been designated the lake 
country of the park. Yellowstone Lake, the largest lake in North 
America at this altitude (7,740 feet) and one of the largest in the world 
at so high an elevation above sea-level, presents a superficial area of 
139 square miles, and a shore-line of nearly 100 miles. From measure- 
ments made near the outlet of the lake in September, 188(5, tiie driest 
period of the year, the discharge was found to be 1,525 cubic feet per~ 
second, or about 34,000,000 imperial gallons per hour. 

At the same time all the priucij^al lakes and streams in the park 
were carefully gauged. Dr. William Ilallock, who undertook this work, 
estimated that the amount of water running into the park and leaving 
it by the Yellowstone, (xallatin, Madison, Snake, and Falls rivers, the 
five main drainage channels, would be equivalent to a stream 5 feet 
deep, 190 feet wide, with a current of 3 miles per hour, and that over 
an area of 4,000 square miles the minimum discharge was equal to 1

cubic foot per second ])or square mile. For tlie ] (reservation and regu- 
lation of this water supply tlie forest, wliicli covers the mountains, 
valleys, and table-lands, and everywhere borders upon the lake sliores, 
is of inestimabh^ value. Of the jtreseut park area about 84 per cent is 
forest clad, almost wholly made up of coniferous trees. The timber is 
by no means of the finest <|uality, but foi- tlie i»uri)osc of water protec 
tion it meets every jjossible requirement. IMucli has been said of Iiit«' 
years by scientilic and ex])erienced i)ersons of the great necessity ot 
preserving the forests near the sources of our great rivers. It is mainly 
for the forest i»rotection that the proposed <'nlargement is demanded 
by the public welfare. In my oi>inion no region in tlie Kocky JMount- 
ains is so admirably adapted lor a forest reservation as tlie Yellowstone 
National Park. 



SOAPING (1EY8ERS.* 



By Arnold Hauue, 

I'. S. CcdUxjUul Surrey. 



At the Buft'alo meet in ji, October, 1S8S, Dr. Kayinoiul jtieseiited a 
paper entitled '* Soai)inji' (ieysers," in wliieh lie called attentioii to the 
use of soap by tourists to cause eruptions of several of the well-known 
geysers in the Yellowstone Park. Incorporated in this paper appears 
a conimuuication received from me, written from camp in the park, in 
rei)ly to some inquiries on the subject. The letter discussed somewhat 
briefly the means employed by visitors to the park to hasten the erup- 
tions from hot springs and reservoirs of hot water, which remain dor- 
numt for days, or even weeks or months, at a tempera tn re near the 
boiling-point, without any <lisi)lay of geyser-action. As the jiapcr lias 
called forth considerable comment, L desire to elucidate one or two 
points in relation to tlie temjieratnre of the springs, and to answer 
some incpiiries about the composition of the thermal wateis. 

In the summer of 188r>, a Chinaman, employed as ii laiindryman for 
the accommodation of the t(»nrists at the Upper (leyser Uasin, acci- 
dentally discovered, much to his aniazenuMit, that soap thrown into the 
si)ring from which he was a<'Custonu'd to draw his su])i)ly of water 
l)roduced ail eruption in every way similar to the actual workings of 
a geyser. Tourists, with limited time at their command, who had 
travelled thousands of miles to look u])on the wonders of the Yellow- 
stone, soon fell into the way of coaxing the laundrynuin's spring into 
action, to [)artly compensate them for their sore <lisaiipointm«'nt in 
witnessing only the periodical eruptions of Old Faithful. Successful 
attempts upon this spring soon led to various endeavors to accelerate 
action in the dornnmt and more famous geysers, in a short tinu^, so 
poi)ular became the desiic to stimulate geysers in tiiis way, that the 
park authorities were compelled to enforce rigidl\' tlie nih- against 
throwing oitjects of any kind into the springs. 

In connection with a thorough investigation of the thermal waters 
of the Yellowstone l*ark and tiie ])henoraena of the geyers, I under-

154 SOAPING GEYSERS. 

took a number of experiments to ascertain the action of soap upon the 
Avaters and to determine, if possible, those physical conditions of 
various pools and reservoirs which permitted the hastening of an erup- 
tion by the employment of any artificial methods. This investigation, 
conducted from time to tiuie, as opportunity oft'ered, throughout the 
field-season of 1885, included experiments ui)on the geysers ami hot 
si)riugs <»f the iri)])er. Lower, and Norris geyser basins. The results 
proved, beyond all question, that geyser-action could be forced in a 
number of ways, but most conveniently by the application of soap. 
The greater part of the more powerful geysers undergo no perceptible 
change with a moderate use of soap, although several of them may, 
under favorable i)hysical conditions, be thrown at times into violent 
agitation. In most of the experiments, Lewis's concentrated lye, put 
up in one-half pound cans f<n^ laundry purposes, was employed. Each 
package furnished a- strong alkali, equivalent to several bars of soap. 
In this form alkali is more easily handled than in bars of soap, more 
especially where it is required to produce a viscous fluid in the larger 
reservoirs; and, in conducting a series of experiments for comparative 
inirposes, it seemed best, in most instances, to employ the same agent 
to bring about the desired results. 

Old Faithful, the model geyser of the i)ark, exhibits such marked 
regularity in its workings that attem])ts to hasten its action appear 
futile. The interval between erui)tions is about sixty-five minutes, 
and rarely exceeds the extreme limits of fifty-seven and seventy-two 
minutes. After an eruption of Old Faithful, the reservoir fills up 
gradually; the water steadily increases in temperature; .and conditions 
favorable to another eruption arc produced under circumstances pre- 
cisely similar to those which have brought about the displays for the 
past eighteen years, or as far back as we have authentic records. The 
few experiments which have been made upon Old Faithful are insuffi- 
cient to aft'ord any results bearing on the question; but it seems proba- 
ble that soon after the water attains the necessary temperature an 
eruption takes place. 

Of all the powerful geysers in the park, the Bee-Hive offers the 
most favorable conditions for producing an eruption by artificial means, 
all the more striking because the luitural displays are so fitful that 
they can not be predicted with any degree of certainty. Observations, 
extending over a period of several years, have failed to determine any 
established law of periodicity for the Bee-Hive, even for three or four 
consecutive months, although they indicate that some relationship may 
exist between its display and those of the famous Giantess. Frequently 
the Bee-Hive Avill play several times a day and then beconu^ dormant, 
showing no signs of activity for weeks and months, although the water 
may stand above the boiling-point the greater part of the time. The 
name Bee-Hive was suggested by the symmetry of the cone built 
around the vent. It rises about 4 feet above the sloping mound of 



SOAPING GEYSERS. 155 

geyseritc, and hi cross-section measures about o feet at the toj). while at 
the bottom of I he cone the Aent is less tbau 10 inches in width. From 
the toj) of this narrow vent it is only possible to sink a Aveijiiit 17 feet 
l)eforc strikiuii' a ])roJecting Icdj^e, Avhich interferes with all cxanuna- 
tion of the ground below. The constant boiling and bubbling of the 
water, the irregularity of its action, and the convenient location of the 
geyser, within an easy walk from the hotel, make attempts to acceler- 
ate the erui)tions of the I>ee-IIive most attractive to tourists. 

In most instances such efforts are futile ; yet success does so fre- 
quently reward the astonished traveller that, unless the geyser were 
carefully watched by the authorities, attempts would be nuule daily 
throughout the season. If the conditions are favorable to an eruption, 
it usually takes place in from ten to twenty-five minutes after the addi- 
tion of laundry soap or lye. It is doubtful if more than two eru])tions 
of the Bee-Hive have ever been i)r()duced on the same day by aitifi- 
cial means, although I know of no reason, based niton tlu' structure 
of the geyser, why more displays might not be obtained, for the 
reservoir and vent fill up witii boiling water very rapidly after each 
eruption. 

Although the Giantess is situated only 400 feet from the Bee- 
Ilive, these two differ in surface and under-ground structure and 
mode of action as widely as any two of the more prominent geysers 
of the Park. Around the (riantess no cone or mound has formed. 
The broad basin is only partially rimmed in by a luirrow fringe 
of siliceous sinter, lising above and extending out over the deep 
blue water. At the surface this basin measures about 15 to 20 feet 
in width by 20 to 30 feet in length. It has a funnel-shaped caldron, 
30 feet in depth, ending in a vertical vent or neck, 12 feet deep, 
thi-ough which a sounding-lead maybe dropped into a second reservoir, 
meeting a jtrojeeting ledge or obstruction of some kind, 01 feet below 
the surface. After an outburst of the (liantess, the basin, wliich has 
been com]>letely emptied of its water, gradually fills again to the 
toj) : and, for days belore another eruption, a steady stream of hot 
water ov<'rllows the brim. The intervals between the eruptions of the 
Cliantess \;\\y from twehe to twenty days, and the <lisi)lays last sev- 
eral hours, being unsurj)assed for violence and grandeur by any geyser 
in the U])]>er Basin. Artificial nn'ans have never bi'cu successful in 
bringing this geyser into action, although, jbr days before an erup- 
tion, it is an easy matter to cause an agitation of the water by tin-ow- 
ing into the basin small ])ieces of sinter, or to ])roduce a boiling on 
the surface, lasting several minutes, by sim])ly stirring the water with 
a stick. 

The Giant, one of the most violent of the geysers in the llppeii" 
Basin, more closely resembles the liee-Hive than any other of those 
iilong the Firehole Kiver. It has built up a cone 10 feet in height, 
one side of which has been partly broken down by some eruption more 



156 SOAPING GEYSERS. 

violent than any witnessed at the jneseut day. Through this notched 
side, steam and broken jets of water are constantly emitted ; and on 
this account but little examination has been made of the underground 
reservoirs and vents. The Giant is litful in its a<*tion, at times playing 
Avith considerable regularity every fourteen days, and at other times 
lying dormant for nearly a year. I have no positive knowledge that 
an erujition of the Giant has ever been produced by any other than 
natural causes. At the time of my experiments no eruption of the 
Giant had taken place for several mouths, although the water was 
constantly agitated, so mnch so that it was quite impossible to exam- 
ine the vent with any satisfactory results. The only effect produced 
by the application of lye Mas additional height to the eolumn of water 
thrown ont and a decided increase in the thum])ing and violence of 
the boiling. 

In the Lower Basin, the Fountain has been more carefully studied 
than the other geysers ; and, its action and periodicity of eruptions 
having been fairly well ascertained, it afforded the most favorable 
conditions for observing the action of soap and lye upon the Avaters. 
In its general structure the Fountain belongs to the type of the 
(Tiantess, having a funnel-shaped caldron which, long before an 
eruption, overflows into an adjoining basin. At the time of my ex- 
periments upon the Fountain, the intervals between eruptions lasted 
about four hours. This interval allowed sufticient time to note any 
changes Avhich might take place. My own experiments Avith lye 
yielded no positive results ; although it seemed highly i»r<)bablc that 
action might be hastened by the ap]>lication of soap or lye just before 
the time for an eruption, or when, for some cause, the eruption Avas 
overdue. 1 preferred to make the attempt to bring about an exi^losion 
before the usual time, only Avaiting until the AA^ater in the pool had 
nearly reached the boiling-point. All exiieriments failed. The pre- 
vious year, Avhen wishing to produce action for the purpose of photog- 
raphy, I AA^as enabled to accomi)lish the desiied result by A'igorously 
stirring with a slender pole, the water near the top of the vent con- 
necting Avitli the lower reserA'^oir. In this instance, it should be said, 
the usual interval of time between eruptions had long since passed; 
the geyser AAas, so far as time was concerned, a half-hour overdue. 
My opinion now^ is that the experiments Avith lye failed because the 
temperature had scarcely reached the boiling point. 

The Monarch, in the Norris Basin, is quite unlike those already 
described, and affords evidence of being a much ncAver geyser. It is 
formed by two coiiA^ergent fissures, on the line of a narrow seam in the 
rhyolite, probably coming together below the surface. The main vent 
measures about 20 feet in length and, at the surface, 3 feet in width. 
But slight incrustation is found around the vent, the conditions not 
being favorable to deposition. In this narrow fissure the AA^ater, Avhich 
ordinarily stands about 15 feet beloAv the surface, constantly surges 



SOAPING GEYSERS. 157 

and boils, ex('e[)t iininediatoly after au eruption. The intervals be- 
tween eraptions vary somewhat from year to year; but at the time of 
these experiments the action was fairly regular, t\n) geyser playing 
every four hours. [ was successful in obtaining an eruption (juite equal 
to the natural displays, which throw a column of water oU feet into 
the air. Here at the Monarch there is no surface reservoir, and the 
narrow fissure, filled with loose blocks of rocks around which the 
water is in constant agitation, prevents all measurements of depth. 

Tlie results of the many experiments, not only upon active geysers 
but upon a large number of hot springs, determine fairly well the 
essential conditions which render it possible to bring about geyser 
action by artificial means. Negative results are frequently as valuable 
for this inquiry as experiments yielding imposing displays. 

Outside of a few exceptional instances, which could not be repeated, 
and in which action was probably only anticipated by a few minutes 
in time, geyser eruptions produced by soap or alkali appear to demand 
two essential requirements: First, the surface caldron or reservoir 
should liold but a small amount of water, exposing only a limited area 
to the atmosphere; second, the water should stand at or above the 
boiling point of water for the altitude of the geyser basin above vsea 
level. The i)rincipal factor which makes it possibles to cause an 
eruption artificially is, I think, the super-heated and unstalde condi- 
tion of the surface waters. Many of the geysers and hot springs pre- 
sent singular phenomena of pools of water heated above the theoret- 
ical boiling point, and, unless disturbed, frequently remain so for 
many days without exhibiting any signs of ebullition. It may not be 
easy to describe accurately these super-heated waters; but anyone 
who has studied the hot springs and pools in tlie Park and carefully 
lujted the tem[)eratures, (juickly learns to recognize the peruliar i\\). 
pearance of tliese basins when heated above the boiling point. They 
look as if they were "ready to boil," except tliat tlie surface remains 
placid, oidy interrupted by numerous steam-bubbles, rising through 
the water from below and bursting (|uietly upon reaching the surface. 

Marcet, the French physicist, lias specially investigated the phenom- 
ena of super-heated waters, and has succeeded in attaining a tcmjjera- 
tureof 105° ('. befm-e ebullition. Super-heated waters in nature, how- 
ever, appear to have been scarcc^ly recognized, except during the prog- 
ress of the work in the Velh)wstone Park, in connection with a study 
of the geysers. The altitudes of the geyser basins above sea-level 
Inive been ascertained by long series of barometric readings, contin- 
ued through several seasons. In conducting a series of observations 
i.pon th(^ boiling ))oints of th(i thermal waters in the Park, Dr. Wil- 
liam Ilallock, who had charge of this special investigation, deter- 
mined the theoretical boiling-point by noting the mean daily readings 
oC the mercurial colum!i. The exact boiling-point of a i)ure surface- 
water, obtained from a neighboring mountain stream and the boiling- 



158 SOAPING GEYSERS. 

point of tlie thermal waters from the springs, were determhied from 
actual experiments by heating over a lire, employing every possible 
precaution to avoid sources of error. Surface waters and deep-seated 
mineral waters gave the same results, and coiucided with the calcu- 
lated boilingi^oint at this altitude. Hundreds of observations have 
been carefully taken where the waters in the active and running 
springs boiled at temperatures between 198° and 199o F. 

As will be shown later in this paper, the thermal waters are solu. 
tions of mineral matter too dilute to be affected to any appreciable 
extent as regards their boiling-point by their dissolved contents. The 
theoretical boiling-point for the springs and pools in the Upper Geyser 
Basin may be taken at 92.5° 0. (198.5 F.). In many of the large cal- 
drons, where the water remains quiet, a temperature has been recorded 
of 94° C. (201.2° F.) without the usual phenomena of boiling. This 
gives a body of super-heated water, with a temperature at the surface 
1.5° 0. (2.7° F.) above the point necessary to produce explosive action. 
Thermometers plunged into the basins show slightly varying tempera- 
tures, dependent upon their position in the basin. They indicate the 
existence of numerous currents, and a very unstable equilibrium of 
the heated waters, which are liable, under slight changes, to burst 
forth with more or less violence. It is under these conditions that geyser 
action can be accelerated by artificial means. If into one of these 
super-heated basins a handful of sinter pebbles be thrown, or the sur- 
face of the water be agitated by the rapid motion of a stick or cane, 
or even by lashing with a rope, a liberation of steam ensues. This is 
liable to be followed by a long boiling of water in the pool, which iu 
turn may lead to geyser action. There is some reason to believe that, 
at least in one instance, an eruption has been brought about by a violent 
but temporary gust of wind, which either ruffled the water or disturbed 
the equilibrium of the pool, and changed momentarily the atmospheric 
l^ressure. 

In Iceland travellers liave long been accustomed to throw into the 
geysers turf and soft earth from the bogs and meadows which abound 
in the neighborliood, the eftect produced being much the same as tliat 
of sinter pebbles and gravel upon the geysers in the National Park. 
So well was this understood that at one time a peasant living ueiU' the 
Iceland locality kept a shovel solely for the accommodation of those 
visiting the geysers. 

In my letter to Dr. Ilaymond 1 mention the curious fact that the 
Laundryman's Spring, now known as the Chinaman, in which geyser 
action may most easily be produced by artificial means, has never been 
regarded by the Geological Survey as anything but a hot spring, and 
]io one has ever seen it in action without the application of soap, ex- 
cept in one instance, when it was made to ])lay to a height of 20 feet 
after stirring it vigorously with a pine bough for nearly ten minutes. 
In our records it is simply known as a spring. 



SOAriNG GEYSERS. 159 

If soap or lye is tliiowii into most of the small pools, a viseous tluid 
is formed; and viscosity is, I think, the piineipal cause in hastening 
geyser action, Mscosity must tend to the retention of steam within 
the basin, and, as in the case of the super-heated waters, where the 
temperature stands at or above the boiling point, explosive liberation 
must follow. All alkaline solutions, whether in the laboratory or in 
nature, exhibit, by reason of this viscosity, a tendency to bump and 
boil irregularly. Viscosity in these hot springs must also tend to tiie 
formation of bubbles and foam when the steam rises to the surface, 
and this in turn aids to bring about the explosive action, followed l)y a 
relief of pressure, and thus to hasten the final and more powerful dis- 
play. Of course relief of pressure of the superincumbent waters upon 
the column of water below the surface basin is essential to all eruptive 
action. These conditions, it seems to me, are purely physical. Un- 
doubtedly the fatty substances contained in soap aid the alkali in ren- 
dering the water viscous. On the other hand, when concentrated lye 
is used it acts with greater eneigy and furnishes a viscous fluid, where 
soap would yield only surface suds insufficient to accomplish any phe- 
nomenal display. 

It is well known that saturated solutions of mineral substances 
raise the boiling-point very considerably, the temperature having been 
determined for many of the alkaline salts. Fn general, I believe the 
boiling-point increases in proportion to the amount of salt held in solu- 
tion. Actual tests have shown that the normal boiling-point of sili- 
ceous waters in the Park does not differ appreciably fi'om the ordinary 
surface waters, mainly, I suppose, because they are extremely dilute 
solutions. 

The amount of lye required to produce a sufficiently viscous condi- 
tion of the waters increases but slightly the percentage of mineral 
matter held in solution. 

All the waters of the principal geyser basins ])resent the closest 
resemblance in chemical composition, and, for the purposes of this 
paper, may be considered as identical in their constituents. They have 
a common origin, being, for the most jiart, surface waters which have 
percolated downward for a sufficient distance to come in contact with 
large volumes of steam ascending from still greatei- depths. The min- 
eral contents of the hot s])rings are mainly derived from the acid lavas 
of the Park plateau, as the resnlt of the action of the ascending steam 
and sui»er-heated waters upon the rocks below. These thermal waters 
are essentially siliceous alkaline water, carrying the same constituents 
in somewhat varying (luantities, but always dilute solutions, ne\'er ex- 
ceeding two grams of mineral matter per kilogram of water. When 
cold they are potable waters, for the most part slightly alkaline to the 
taste, and probably wholesome enough, unless taken daily for a long- 
period of time. 

The following analyses of three geyser waters, sele<;ted from the

The differences of temperature shown in these three waters are 
simi^ly due to the varying interval between the time of collection and 
the last preceding eruption of the geyser. In the case of the Fountain, 
the water rises in a large open basin, which slowly fills np, increasing 
in temperature until the time of the eruption, the form of the basin per- 
mitting the collection of the water two or three hours before the next 
outburst. In the case of the Fearless the surface reservoir is a shaHow, 
saucer-shaped basin, into wliich the water seldom rises before attaining 
a temperature near the boiling-point. At the Bee-Hive the water only 
reaches a sufficiently high level to permit of its collection without 
difticulty when the temperature stands at or near the boiling-i)oiiit. 

Dv. Raymond has made the suggestion that the addition of caustic 
alkali would possibly precipitate some of the mineral ingredients found

tliat the <>eyser waters are probabk too dihite solutions to be niueli 
intiiieneed by such additions. An.None who i^Iances at th(^ analyses of 
the waters of the Hee Hive, b\>untain, and l'\'arless must see, i flunk, 
that they are not only too dilute to undergo any marked ehange of 
teuii)eratuie, but that the mineral eoustitiients consist mainly of tlie 
earbomites and chlorides of the alkalis, associated with a relatively 
large amount of free silica which wouhl remain unaeted upon by caustic 
alkali. There is nothing iu the waters to be thrown down by the 
addition of alkali or permit any chemical condHuations to be formed 
by the addition of a small amount of soaj). The desire of tourists to 
"soap a geyser" during their trip through the Park grows annually 
with the increase of travel, so much so that there is a steady demand 
for the Toilet soap of the hotels. If visitors could have their way, the 
l)eautiful blue springs and basins of the geysers would be "in the 
suds" constantly throughout the season. Throwing anything into the 
hot springs is now prohibited by the Government authorities. It is 
certainly detrimental to the preservation of the geysers, ami the 
practice can not be too strongly condemned by all interested in the 
^N^ational lieservation.

COKTIISrENTAL PROBLEMS OF GEOLOGY.* 



By G. K. Gilbert. 



Introduction. — For a decade atteutioii has been turned to the con- 
tinents. Through the distribution of animals and plants Wallace has 
studied the history of tlie former conn«K'tion and disconnection of land 
areas. Theories of interchange of land and water have been i)ropounded 
by Suess and Blytt. By means of geodetic data Helmert lias discussed 
the broad relations of the geoid to the theoretic spheroid. Darwin has 
comi^uted tlie strength of terrestrial material necessary to sustain the 
continental domes. .lames Geikie, treating nominally of coast lines, 
has considered the shifting relations of land and sea, and a half score 
of able writers have debated the question of continental permanence. 
The American Society of Naturalists, now holding its annual meeting 
at Princeton, N. J., devoted yesterday's session to the consideration of 
such e\idences of change in the geography of the American continent 
as are contained in the distribution of animals and plants. The inter- 
continental congresses auxiliary to the World's Fair next summer are 
to be devoted to the discussion of continental and inter-continental 
themes ; and a committee, at the head of which stands one of our vice- 
])residents, invites the geologists of the world to assemble for the con- 
sideration of those broader questions of earth structure and earth history 
which aftect more than one hemisphere. This occasion, too, in which, 
after three years' sojourn in the land of the raccoon and the opossum, 
we return to the land of the sable and the beaver, brings forcibly to 
mind tlie continental extent of our society and its continental liekl. It 
is not strange, then, that tlie continents have seemed to me a litting 
tlieme of which to speak to you to-day. Realizing not only the breadth 
and grandeur, but tlie inherent difficulty of the subject, I do not hoi)e 
to enlarge the contril)ution the decade has made, nor shall I attempt 
to summarize it; neither is it my desire to anticipate the discussions 
of the World's Fair congress. It is my pur])ose rather to state, as 
clearly as I may, some of the great unsolved problems which the con- 
ti.nents propound to the coming inter-continental congress of geologists.

CONTJNEXTAL PROBLEMS OF GEOLOGY. 



Differentiation of continentid and oeeuniv plateaus. — It is one of the 
paradoxes of the subject that our ideas as to the essential character of 
the continents liave been greatly modified and claritied by the recent 
exploration of the seai. Tlie work, especially, of the Challenger and 
the BlaJce in delineating' and sampling- the bottom of the ocean has 
given new dctinitions, not only to the term ''deep sea, "but also to the 
term "continent," as they are employed by students of terrestrial 
mechanics and of ijhysical geography. To the continental lands are 
now added the continental shoals, and the depth of the deep sea is no 
longer its sole characteristic. Look for a moment at this generalized 
profile of the earth's surface. It expresses in a concise way the rela- 
tions of area to altitude and of both to the level of the sea. Murray, to 
whose generalizations from the Challenf/er dredgings and soundings 
the student of continents owes so much, has computed, with the aid 
of the great body of modern data, the areas of land and ocean bed con- 
tained between certain contours, fourteen in number,* and from his

heights and horizontal distances represent terrestrial areas. The full 
width of the diagram from side to side stands for tlie entire surface of 
the earth. The striking features of the profile are its two terraces or 
horizontal elements. Two-fifths of the earth's area lies between 11,000 
and 10,000 feet beneath the ocean, constituting avast submerged pla- 
teau, whose mean altitude is — 14,000 feet. This is the plateau of the 
deep sea. One-fourth of the earth's area falls between the contour 
5,000 feet above the ocean and the contour 1,000 feet below, and has a 
mean altitude of + 1,000 feet. This is the continental plateau. The two 
plateaus together comprise two-thirds of the earth's surface, the re- 
maining third including the intermediate slopes, the areas of extreme 
and exceptional depth, and the areas of extreme and exceptional height.

CONTINENTAL PROBLEMS OE GEOLOGY,

Tims ill the broadest possible way, ;iiul in a iiiaiiiicr iiraclically iiule- 
pendeiit of the distribution of land and water, we have the ocean floor 
clearly differentiated from the continental plateau. It is at once evident 
that for the discussion of the i>Teater terrestrial i)robleiiis connected 
with the configuration of the surface, and especially of the problems of 
terrestrial mechanics, we must substitute for the continents, as limited 
by coasts, the continental plateau, as limited by the margins of the 
continental shoals. 

It does not follow from the profile, which, as 1 have said, represents 
only the relation of extent to altitude, that all districts of continental 
plateau are united in a single body, and in point of fact they are not com- 
jjletely united; but the greater bodies are brought together, and the 
only outlying district is that of the Antarctic continent. Running- a line 
along- the edge of the continental shelf where a gentle slope is exchanged 
for a stec]) one, and passing- freely, as occasion may rcfpiire, from the 
coast down to the line of 1,000 fathoms, a continental outline is pro-

duced in which Xorth America and Eurasia are united through the 
shoals of the Arctic ocean, and in Miiich Australia and the greater 
islands of the l^ast Indies are. joined to southwestern Asia. Antarctica 
alone stands separate, being iiarted from South America by a broad 
ocean channel, im])er(ectl\- surveyed asyet, but believed to have a depth 
of between 1,000 and -!,()0() fathoms. The lower plateau, or the floor of 
the deep ocean, is less continuous, being- separated by tracts of moder- 
ate depth into three great bodies, coinciding ap])roximately with the 
Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian oceans. 

Rifjiditi/ versus isosfasij. — The first of our continental problems refers 
to the conditions under Avhich the differentiation of the eaitlTs surfa(;e 
into oceanic and continental ])lateaus is ])ossible. How are the conti- 
nents su])])orted ? l^h^ery i)ait of the oceanic plateau sustains the Aveig-ht 
of the superjacent column of water. At the same level beneath the 
continental idatean each unit of the lithosi)here sustains a column of 
rock both taller and denser than the column of water and weighing 



166 CONTINENTAL PROBLEMS OF GEOLOGY. 

about three times as much. The differeuce between the two pressures, 
or the dilierential pressure, is about 12,000 pounds to the square iuch, 
aud this force, applied to the entire area of the continental plateau, urges 
it downward and urges the oceanic plateau upward. Referring again to 
the diagram in Figure 1, the entire weight of the continental i)lateau, 
pressing on the track beneath it, tends to produce a transfer of material 
in the direction from left to right, resulting in the lowering of the higher 
plateau and the raising of the lower. To the question, how this tendency 
is counteracted, two general answers have been made: first, that the 
earth, being solid, by its rigidity maintains its form; second, that the 
materials of wliich consist the continental plateau and the underlying 
portions of the lithosphere are, on the whole, lighter than the materials 
underlying the ocean tioor, and that the difference in density is the 
couii)leme]it of the difference in volume, so that at some level horizon 
far below the surface the weights of the superincumbent columns of 
matter are equal. The first answer regards the horizontal variations of 
density in the earth's crust as unimportant 5 the second regards them as 
important. The first maybe called the doctrine of terrestrial rigidity; 
the second has been called the doctrine of isostasy. At the present time 
the weight of opinion and, in my judgment, the weight of evidence lie 
with the doctrine of isostacy. The differential pressure of 12,000 pounds 
per square inch suffices to crush nearly all rocks, and it may fairly be 
questioned whether there are any rock masses which in their natural 
C(mdition near the surfiice of the earth are able to resist it. The samples 
of rock to which the pressures of the testing machine are applied have 
been indurated by drying; but it is a fact familiar to quarrymen that 
rocks in general are softer as they lie in the quarry below the water- 
line than after they have been exposed to the air and thoroughly dried. 
It is probable therefore that rocks lying within a few hundred or a few 
thousand feet of the surface are unable to resist such stresses as are 
imposed by continents. At greater depths we pass beyond the range 
of conditions which we can reproduce in our laboratories, and our infer- 
ences as to physical conditions are less confident. The tendency of 
subterranean high temperatures is surely to soften all rocks, and the 
tendency of subterranean high pressures is probably to harden them. 
It is not known which tendency dominates; but if the tendencies due 
to pressure are the more powerful, we are at least assured by the phe- 
nomena of volcanism that their supremacy admits of local exception. 

Nature of drnsity (Jiffereneei'i. — If we accept the (hictrine of isostasy 
and regard the material under the continents as less dense than that 
under the ocean floors, the question then arises whether the difference 
in density is due merely to a difference in temperature or whether it 
arises primarily from differences in composition. This, which may be 
called the second problem of the continents, is so intimately related 
to the one which follows that we may pass it by without fuller state- 
ment.

CONTINENTAL PROBLEMS OF GEOLOGY. 167 

What caused the continental plateau? — The i)r()blein of tlie origin of 
tlie continents remains almost untouched. Those who have pro- 
]>ounded theories for tlie formation of mountain ranges have sometimes 
included <'ontinents also, but as a rule without adequate adaptation to' 
the special conditions of the continental problem. So far as 1 ani 
aware, the ••.ubject has been seriously attacked only by our second 
ju'csident, Prof. Dana. He postulates a globe with solid nucleus and 
molten exterior, and ])ostulates, further, local differences of condition, 
in consequence of which the formation of solid crust on the liquid en- 
veloi)e was for a long period confined to certain districts. In those 
districts successive crusts were formed, which sunk through the liquid 
envelope to the solid nucleus and by their accumulation built up the 
continental masses. The remaining areas were afterward consolidated, 
and subsequent cooling shrunk the ocean beds more than it shrunk the 
continental masses, because their initial tem])eratures (at the beginning 
of that process) were higher.* That the philosoj)hic mind may find 
satisfaction in this explanation, it appears necessary to go behind the 
second postulate and discover what were the conditions which deter- 
mined congelation in certain districts long betbre it l)egan in others. 

Can it be shown that the localization of congelati(m, having been 
initiated by an otherwise unimportant inequality, would be periiet- 
uated by any of those cumulative processes which are of such im])or- 
tance in various departments of idiysics? Andean it be shown that 
siu'h a process of continent-buildiug" would segregate in the continental 
tract certain kinds of matter and thus institute the conditions essential 
to isostatic eqnilibrium "? To the first of these questions no answer is 
ap]»arent, but I incline to the opinion that the second maybe answered 
in the affirmative. If we assume the liquid envelope to consist of va- 
rious molten rocks arranged in the order of their densities and if we 
assume, further, that their order of densities in the li(iuid condition 
corresponds to their ordei- ol densities in the solid condition, then the 
successive crusts whose heaping built up the continents would all be 
formed from the lightest material, and the isostatic condition would be 
satistied. 

It was the fashion of the last generation of physical geographers to 
study the forms of continents as delimited by coasts, seeking analogies 
of continental forms with one anotiier and also with various geometric 
figures, especially the triangle. The geiu^rali zations resulting from 
these studies have not yielded valuable ideas, and the modern student 
is apt to smile at the effVu't of his ])redecess()r to dis(M)ver the ideal geo- 
metric ligure where th<^ unbiased eye sees only irregularity. Ibit barren 
as were those studies i am not satisfied that their method was faulty, 
and as a i)hysiograplier 1 have such a})pr(H',iation of the ideas that 
sometimes grow from studies of form that 1 have attem])ted to apply 
the old method to the new conception of the continental ])latcau. Con-

lessing in advance that my only result has been negative, I neverthe- 
less recite what I have done, partly because negative contributions to 
an obscure subject are not entirely valueless and partly with the 
thought that the forms whose meanings I failed to discover may never- 
theless prove significant to some other eyes. 

What I did was to draw upon a globe the outline of tlie continental 
plateau and then view it from every direction. Afterwards I developed 
the figure upon a jilane surface, employing for that purpose a mode of 
projection which is probably novel. As tliis mode is not susceptible of 
mathematical fornmlation, and therefore will not find place in the litera- 
ture of cartography, I may be pardoned for applying a trivial name and 
calling it the orange-peel projection. The name almost explains it. Con- 
ceive the continental i^lateau to be outlined upon a spherical orange 
and the rind of the orange to ])e divided by a sharp knife along the 
sinuosities of the outline; conceive then that the ]>ortiou of the rind

es])ecially from tlieii' sttuly as <Ielineated on the globe, it a]»i)eared pos- 
sible that a portion of the continental plateau might belt the earth as 
a great circle. The discovery of such a belt would be imi)ortant, for by 
assuming that it Avas originally etjuatorial Ave might be led to new hy- 
p(^theses of continental development. In a rotating liquid si)here the 
only differentiation of surface condition we can readily conceive is that 
between equatorial and polar regitms, and if such differentiation were 
sulticient to cause or localize continental elevations, then these eleva- 
tions would constitute either t\A'o polar tracts or else an equatorial belt. 
Moreover, I have been induced by recent studies of the physical history 
of the moon to suspect that thc^, earth may at one time have received 
considerable accessions from without and that these accessions were 
made to the equatorial tract. If these suspicions are well foiiuded, pe- 
culiar characters may have been given to a tract having the form of a 
belt. So for a double reason I was led to compare the outline of the 
continental plateau with a great circle. To this end a great circle was 
chosen, coinciding as nearly as possible with the line of greatest con- 
tinental extension, and the projection was so modified as to render the

(rauses? AVith American geologists the idea, recently advocated, that 
the chief movements are those of the ocean finds little favor, because

low coastal plains and oceanic waters. In Cretaceous time the two 
marijins of what are now the Great Plains had the same height, or at 
least the western margin was no higlier than the eastern ; but now the 
western margin lies from four thousand to six thousand feet above the 
eastern, and the intervening rock mass api)ears to have been gently 
tilted with(mt im])<ntant internal distortion. Such geographi*' revo- 
lutions are not to l)e exjdained by the shifting of the hydro-sphere nor 
by its dilatation and contraction. N"either can they be ascribed to iso- 
static restoration of an eijuilibrium deranged through the transfer of 
masses by erosion and sedimentation, for that liypothetic process i.« 
essentially conservative. Neitlier is it easy to believe that the two mar- 
gins of the plains have differed, since the Cretaceous, to the extent of 
one mile in their radial contraction due to secular cooling of the globe; 
nor is it easy, at least for the disciple of isostasy, to believe that such 
a change can have resulted from the localization of deformation con- 
sequent on the slowing of the earth's rotation. Each of these processes 
may have been concerned, but I conceive that the essential factor still 
awaits suggestion. Our knowledge of surface processes, as compared 
to subterranean, is so full that the field of plausible epigene hypothe- 
ses may be exhausted, but the vista of hypogene i)ossibility still opens 
broadly. 

Are continents permanent? — The doctrine of the permanence of the 
continental plateau, enunciated long ago by Dana and more recently 
advocated, with a powerful array of new data, by Murray and Wallace, 
has made rapid progress toward general acceptance. Nevertheless its 
course is not entirely clear, and among the obstacles still to be over- 
come is one whose magnitude is perhaps magnified for the American 
student by proximity. All who have studied broadly the stratigraphy 
of the Appalachian district have concluded that the sediments came 
chietly from the east, and the detailed Appalachian work of the past 
decade is disclosing a complicated history, in which all chapters tell of 
an eastern paheozoic land and some chapters seem to testify to its wide 
extent. At some times the western shore of this land lay east of the 
sight of the Blue Ridge, and there is serious doubt w^hether the exist- 
ing belts of coastal plain and submerged continental shelf afford it 
sutticient space. For the present, at least, the subject of continental 
permanence must be classed with the continental problems. 

Do continents (fro IV f — According to my own view^ there is yet another, 
a sixth, continental ])roblem deserving the attention of the World's 
Fair inter-continental congress. We have been told by the masters of 
our science (and their teaching has been echoed in every text-book and 
in every classroom), that through the whole ])eriod of the geologic 
record the continents have grown; not that the continental plateaus 
have been materially extended, not that the pendulum has moved 
always in one direction, but that the land area has on the whole 
steadily increased. From this doctrine there has been no dissent — 



CONTINENTAL PROBLEMS OF GEOLOGY. 171 

and possibly there should be no dissent — but the evidence on which it 
is founded appears to nic so far from conclusive that I venture to 
doubt. 

The evidence employed consists partly in the geueral distribution of 
formations as shown by the oeoloyic map and i)artly iu inferences drawn 
from certain formations which contain internal evidence that they origi- 
nated on coasts. With the aid of such data are drawn the outlines of 
ancient ocean and land at ^■arious geologic dates, and from the com 
parison of these outlines contineutal growth is infened. In passing 
from the formation boundaries of the geologic map to the oceanic limits 
of the charts of aiuuent geography, allowance is made for the former 
extent of non-littoral formations beyond their present boundaries. 
This allowance is largel.y conjectural and the range of possible error is 
confessedly great. In i)assing from the observed limits of littoral for- 
mations to the coast lines of ancient geography little or no allowance 
is usually made for the former extent of the formations, and I conceive 
that great possibility of error is also thus admitted, louring a period 
of oceanic transgression over the land, all portions of the transgressed 
surface are successively coastal, and tlie coastal deposits they receive 
are subsequently buried by off-shore deposits. When tlierefore littoral 
beds are found in remnants of strata surviving the processes of deg- 
radation, it is indeed proper to infer the ])roximity of ancient coasts 
during their formation, but the inference that they represent the limit 
of transgression for that epoch may be far from the truth. For these 
reasons it appears to nie that the specific conclusions which have been 
reached with reference to the original extent of various formations are 
subject to wide uncertainties; and, if this be granted, then but brief 
attention to a simple law of (Unuidation is necessary to show that the gen- 
eral conclusion maybe illusory. The process of degradation by aque- 
ous agencies is chiefly regulated, not by the thickness of formations, 
but by the height to whicli they are uplifted. Thus the present extent 
of most formations is determined in large part by crustal oscillations 
subsequent to their deposition. As formations are progressively eroded, 
the under-lying and older can not be attacked until the over-lying and 
younger have been carried away, and so the outcro})s of the older of 
necessity project beyond the boundaries of the younger. The progress 
of vague inferencte, making indefinite allowance for tlieuidcnown quan- 
tity of eroded strata, nearly always assigns to the older formation, 
wlii<;h projects visildy beyond the newer, a greater original extent. It 
ap])ears to me thus possible that the greater part of the data from which 
contineutal growth is inferred may be factitious and misleading. 

Furthermore, inference, such as it is, deals with only one phase of 
the problem. It is applied to the incursions of the sea upon the land, 
but it is not ai)plied to the excursions of the lan<l upon the sea. Just 
as we infer from stratified rocks the presence of the sea, so also we 
infer from unconformities the .sea's absence; and to the student of 



172 CONTINENTAL PROBLEMS OF GEOLOGY, 

ancient geograplij^ the two classes of evidence are equally iinportant. 
But the strata, spread widely over the surface of the laud, are con- 
spicuous phenomena, while unconformities are visible only here and 
there and are usually difficult of determination. For this reason the 
data derived from unconformity have never been assembled. Essays 
toward ancient geography have dealt only with the minima of ancient 
land, never with its maxima, and the question of continental growth 
can not be adequately treated while half of the history is ignored. 

We may borrow a figure from the strand of a lake. As the waves 
roll inward, each records its farthest limit by a line upon the sand and 
each obliterates all previous wave lines which it overpasses. The ob- 
server who studies thetransient record at any point may find a series of 
lines, of which the highest is the oldest and th6 lowest is the newest, and 
he may infer that the lake level was higher when the first wave left its 
trace and that the water is receding from the land. But, if he continue 
his observations through many days and fix monuments to record from 
time to time the lowest land laid bare between the waves, he may dis- 
cover that the highest wave line and the lowest record of ebb corre- 
spond in time with the play of the largest waves, and that the lowest 
wave lino and the highest record of ebb correspond to the play of smaller 
waves, and thus reach the conclusion that the lake level has remained 
unchanged. In the study of Time's great continental strand we are not 
even able to observe directly the wave lines of rhythmic transgression, 
but infer their positions from data often ambiguous; and of the lower 
wave limits, the lines of maximum regression, Ave are absolutely 
ignorant. 

It may be true that a priori considerations afford a presumption in 
favor of continental growth, but such presumption should not be per- 
mitted to give color to evidence otherwise neutral ; and moreover it is- 
not impossible to discover an ffj)r/ori presumption in favor of continental 
diminution. Assuming that hyj)ogene agencies cause continental areas 
to rise above the ocean, the work of epigene agencies constantly tends 
to remove the projecting eminences and deposit their material about 
their margins, so as to extend the area of the continental plateau. Thus 
we have a strong a priori presumption in favor of continental growth. 
On the other hand, if we admittheprincipleof isostatic equilibrium, then 
the continental eminences have low density ; and as they are worn away 
by epigene processes the material which rises from below to restore them 
has greater density and maintains a somewhat less altitude. The proc- 
ess of isostatic restoration tends thus toward the permanent levelling 
of continents, and if the hypogene initiative should cease the continents 
would ultimately be reduced to ocean level, and finally, through proc- 
esses of solution, to a level below the ocean; so, assuming the initiative 
processes of the under earth to be of finite duration, tlie work of terres- 
trial degradation, combined with isostatic restoration, should afford a 
continental history characterized in an earlier stage by growth and in a 



CONTINENTAL rKOi;i>EMS OF GHOLOCJY. 173 

later stage by deeadence. In our igiioraiicc of subterranean forces we 
should use sucli a priori coiisidcrations only as a means fortlie sugges- 
tion of liy[)otliescs. As they liave (h)ubtless served to promote the 
theory of continental growth, they should also be permitted to indicate 
the possibility of continental retrogradation. 

Sumnuiri/. — Tiie problems of the continents ha\t' been touciied to-day 
sobrietly that a snmnuiry is almost superlluous. 'riie doctrine of isos- 
tasy, though holding a leading i)ositiou, has not full.\- supplanted tlie 
doctriue of rigidity. If it be accepted, there remains the (juestiou 
whether heat or composition determines the gra\ity of the ocean beds 
and the le^'ity of continents. For tlie origin of continents we have a 
single hyj)othesis, wliich deserves to be more fully compared with the 
body of modern data. The newly determined configuration of the con- 
tinental mass has yielded no suggestion as to its oiigin. The cause of 
differential ele\ ation and sul)sidence within the continental plateau is 
unknown and has probably not been suggested. The i)ermanence of 
the continental i)lateau, though highly ])robable, is not yet fully estab- 
lished; and the doctrine of continental growth, though generally ac- 
ce]>ted, has not been placed be.\'ond the Held of profitable discussion. 
Thus the sulyect of continents affords no less than a. half dozen of great 
problems, whose complete solution belongs to the future, ft is not al- 
together pleasant to deal with a. subject in regard to which the domain 
of our ignoran(;e is so broad; but if we are optimists we may be com- 
forted by the reflectiou that the geologists of this generation, at least, 
will have no occasion, like Alexander, to lament a dearth of worlds to 
con(j[uer.

early histoiical times it was known among the Greeks that bronze had 
preceded iron at an earlier period, and this knowledge, passing to the 
Romans in a later age, was expressed in the line of Lucretius which has 
been often quoted iu this connection, " sed irrior <rris crat quam ferri 
cognitus nsns.'''' 

But there is e\'idence to show that the use of coi^per was indei)endent 
of, if it did not precede, that of bronze, particularly in places where 
tlie metal was indigenous. This evidence consists in the discovery of 
copper implements and weapons instead of or sometimes accompany- 
ing bronze, mingled with numerous stone articles of the same charac- 
ter, in various places in Europe and the East. The prehistoric people 
had learned the art of extracting copper fi-om its ore, and in some cases 
l)racticed it near the places where the metal was used for implements 
and weapons. Prehistoric copper mines have been reported from the 
Urals and elsewhere, and a circumstantial account of such a mine, 
which Mas discovered in 1827 near Bischofshofen in Salzburg, in Ger- 
many, has been published by M. Much, an arch<e(»logist who examined 
it in LS79.* The traces of the old workings, nearly obliterated after so 
long a time, had led to the establishment of a nourishing mod<H'n cop- 
per mine on the same vein. Just as the trenches on the outcrops of the 
coi)i)er bearing rocks in the Lake Su])erior district served as guides to 
modern miners in sinking shafts there. The Salzburg mine, however, 
was in copjx'r ore and not native coj)per, and was a mine in the proper 
sense of the term, with extensive underground workings. The remains 
of small smelting furnaces, with slag heaps and other rubbish, were

found in the neighborliood, in the midst of Avhich were a i'^w pieces of 
the copper produced from the ore on the spot by the prehistoric smelt- 
ers.* I^o iron tools or signs of their use were found in this mine, which 
was assigned by the arclueologist who examined it to the time of the 
neighboring lake dwellers, who used its copper for weapons and tools. 
Another mine in the Tyrol, referred to by the siuue author, was also 
apparently worked to sup])]y a colony of lake dwellers situated near by. 

It might be expected on l)oth mineralogical and metallurgical grounds 
that copper would be used before bronze, and even before smelting was 
discovered, because copper, like gold and silver, is found in the native 
state in many places, while considerable metallurgical skill is necessary 
for the production of bronze. Moreover, bronze is an alloy of copper 
and tin, and, except in the comparatively rare cases where copper 
and tin ores occur together, tin would have to be transported to the 
copper-smelters to produce the alloy. In North America,! while cop- 
per was known to the natives, bronze had not appeared at the epoch of 
discovery by Europeans, and neither smelting nor even melting was 
necessary for the production of the copper arti('les found in use by the 
discoverers. 

The first comers to the northern part of tliis continent were struck 
with the absence of metals in the nati\'e weapons and implements, and 
found their place supj)lied by stone and bone. The iidiabitauts were 
in the neolithic stage of culture. They were, indeed, in possession o! 
copper, but, as far as the discoverers observed, it was almost exclusively 
used for ornamental purposes, and formed, apparently, no part of the 
native equipment in the arts of life. Exclusive of the [Spaniards, the 
earliest voyagers who left records or reports of their explorations sailed 
along the coast, or visited different parts of it, from Labrador to Flor- 
ida, and the inhabitants of the whole seaboard were found sparingly 
in possession of the "red metal." Thus, in the account of Cabot's voy 
age in 1497, given in Hakluyt, there is this brief statement: "Het: 
(Cabot) declareth further that in many places of these Regions he saw 
great plentie of copper among the inhabitants." The account is a 
translation from Peter Martyr, and the words '^ great plentie of " are not 
warranted by the original. J Cabot's observations were made on the 
northern coast of the continent, and he went as far as 60° north lati- 
tude. A similar brief statement is given in the account of the voyage 
of Ccrtereal in 1500, who is said to have gone as far north as 50°. The 
account (in llamusio) describes the painted inhabitants, their clothing 
of skins, and other particulars, and states that they had bracelets of 
silver and copper. The mention of silver is unfortunate. Verrazano's

report goes more into particulars, lie coasted from ."U to beyond 41'^ 
north latitude in the year 15lil, and made several laiulinjis. ITe says 
of the natives, at a point on the coast apparently in the neighborhood 
of New York, that they had "many plates of wiouiiht copper, which 
tliey esteeme more than Isolde." On sailiu;"' along thecoast to the east- 
ward he saw certain hills and concluded that they had some "minerall 
matter in them, because," he says, " we saw many of them [the nativesj 
have headstones of copper hanging at their eares." On the southern 
and eastern coast, therefore, according to these accounts, the copper 
was used for ornaments. IS'eitlier of the observers cpioted siteahs of 
copper weai)ons in that part of the country, which they would have 
been likely to notice, as they naturally paid special attention to the arms 
they nught have to encounter. Nor did later exjjlorers who described 
the e(piii)ment of the natives in detail have occasion to give greater 
prominence to copper. 

In Cartier's second voyage to the St. Lawrence, in 1535, he kidnaped 
the principal chief of a local tribe to take with him to France, follow 
ing- the common practice of the time, and this chief was visited on 
shipboard by condoling members of his tribe, who were assured that 
he would return the next year, " which, when they heard," says the 
account in llakhiyt, " they greatly thanked our captain and gave their 
lord three bundles of beaver and sea wolves skinnes, with a greatknife 
of red copper that commeth from Saguenay," Jlereis an instance of a 
copper weapon or implement. The quantity of copper which the North 
American Indians possessed at the epoch of disco\ery, although the 
metal was diffused over a very wide teiritory, was very small compared 
with stone. A glance at collections of aboriginal articles, like that of 
the Smithsonian Institution in Washington or the Peabody Museum in 
Cambiidge, will at once show how relatively insignilicant it was. The 
Smithsonian has between six and seven hundred copper articles from 
mounds, graves, and othei- S(mrces within the territory of the United 
States, while there are thousands of stone arrow and si^ear heads and 
implements in its collection. The Peabody and other cop]»er collections 
are very nnich smaller. A closer examination of the Smithsonian 
exhibit will show that tlu'. copper articles from the south and east are 
niaiidy of an ornamental chaiacter and few in number com])ared with 
those found toward the m)rthwest. As Wisconsin is approached the 
copper articles not only increase in number, but tlie i)ro]»ortion of arrow 
and s])ear heads and iniplements far exceeds that of the ornaments. 
Among the Wisconsin specimens ar(^ pieces of "tloat" copper, varying 
in size from those weighing several pounds down to nuggc^ts, which 
indicate the convenient matviial of which some of tlu' nuinufactured 
articles were i)robably made.

178 PRE-COLUMBIAN COPPER-MINING 

Wisconsin. This condition is no doubt largely due to the indefatiga- 
ble zeal of Mr. F. S. Perkins, of Wisconsin, who has devoted himself 
for many years to collecting copper articles of Indian origin from all 
parts of the State, about four hundred of which are in the Smithsonian 
cases. But the phenomenon can be explained in anotlier way when 
one reflects that Keweenaw Point is directly nortli of the State and 
was the seat of the ancient copper mines which have attracted the 
attention of archaeologists, and was the center of distribution of the 
native copper which was the object of the desultory mining carried on 
there. Wisconsin is also in a very favorable situation for receiving the 
drift which brought "float" copper from the copper-bearing rocks of 
Keweenaw, which "float" was apparently often manufactured into 
implements. The State covers a district which was near the mines and 
is in a direct course for people leaving them going south. It may be 
found that that district was the seat of the ancient miners themselves. 

The yield of mounds, graves, and fields, as shown in the colie(;tions, 
confirms in a general way the observations of the first discoverers. In 
the eastern and southern parts of the country the majority of the copper 
articles whic;h have been found are breast-plates, bracelets, beads, 
bobbin-like objects and other ornaments, while in the north and west, 
and especially in Wisconsin, implements and weapons prevail. The 
Wisconsin vSpecimens are like those figured by ^Yh\tt\esey{Smithsonia)i 
Contributions, vol. xiii), which were found in the mining district itself, 
and those found at Brock ville, Canada, and shown in Wilson's "Prehis- 
toric Man." Otliers, apparently of the same character, are mentioned by 
Wilson as being found near Marquette, Mich., east of the copper dis- 
trict. 

The present evidence, therefore, sliowsthatcoi^per had not passed its 
ornamental or precious stage on the seaboard and in the south at the 
time this continent was brought to the attention of Europe. It was not 
a part of the general native equipment, either for war, or hunting, or 
other useful purposes, and its i)osition in the native economy was not 
like the noticeable part it played in the armament of the Mexicans and 
Central Americans of the same jjeriod. 

At the advent of Europeans copper w^as eagerly sought for in trade 
with the whites. An olficial present of coj^per articles is particularly 
mentioned in the account of Cartier's voyage before referred to, and 
Ealph Lane writes from Roanoke, in 1585, to his company in England 
that they could not do better than send over copper articles of all kinds 
to trade with ; " copper carry eth the price of all, so it be made red," he 
explains. The copper obtained from the whites was very soon, with other 
imported things, disseminated by barter among the different tribes. In 
Frobisher's third voyage to the Labrador coast (lat. 58°), in 1578, he 
noticed the evidence of tliis aboriginal trade, and says " the natives 
have traffic with other people, and have barres of iron, arrowe, and 
speare heads and certain buttons of copi)er which they use to weare 



IN NORTH AMERICA. 179 

upon their foreheads for oriiainent, as our ladies iu the court of Eng- 
land doe use great pearle." This trade with the natives must have 
been considerable. The lisliing tieets wiiicli swarmed iu the northern 
waters carried on trade, and copper and iron articles formed a part of 
their outward cargoes. According to Anthony l*arkhurst, who had 
been in the business and on the fishing grounds, trade to Newfoundland 
from r^ngland was brisk in 1548, and an estimate which he made for 
Ilakluyt shows that in loTS there were 100 Spanish vessels engaged in 
cod fishing, 20 to 30 whalers from Biscay, 50 Portuguese, and 150 French 
and Breton vessels. The English contingent was then mucli smaller 
than in former years. 

After the arrival of Europeans, bringing an assortment of " novel- 
ties ''of all kinds, there was no reason why the Indians should trouble 
themselves further to obtain domestic coppei- by tiie toilsome process of 
searching and digging for it, because they now had not only a ready and 
sufficient supply of that metal for ornamental purposes, but were intro- 
duced to many other things of superior attractiveness, especially iron, 
in the form of knives, hatchets, etc., which at once superseded coj)per 
for pi-actical use. " The Chippewa chief, Kontika, asserted in 1.S24 
that but seven generations of men had passed since the French brought 
them brass kettles; at which time their people at once laid aside their 
own manufactures and adopted those of the French." * The testimony 
of the earliest voyagers to the possession of copper ornaments by the 
natives is therefore of imi)ortance, because there was very soon enough 
of the imported article in the country to make a show . Incidentally, 
also, archa'ologists have to keep this fact of foreign imi)ortation iu 
mind in deciding upon the origin of coi^per articles in " finds." Lake 
Superior copper, of which pre-Columbian Indian articles were made, 
occurs in the native state, and is free from the impurities which are 
found in copper that has been smelted, so that chemical analysis could 
often decide whether a given specimen was of native (U'igiu or imported. 
On some copper articles found in the north, si)ecks of silver have been 
noti(ted. This is a snre token of Lake Superior co])per which has never 
been melted. 

In the absence of evidence that the Indians of fhe United States had 
any knowledge of smelting, it must be inferi-ed that all the coi)perthey 
])ossesse(l was found in the metallic or native state. There is nothing 
to show that they weie aware of the existence of ('o|i|)er ore as a sonrce 
of metal. No remains of smelting places, or slag, or other indications 
of metallurgi(;al operations havt^ yet been found. If they had known 
smelting they could have had an ain})le supi^ly of the metal, because 
ores of (•oi)per are eom])aiatively abundant in the United States, while, 
as a nmtter of fact, coi)i)er was a larity w ith them. Native copper occurs 
in snudl quantities in many jdaces in the United States, but there is no 
evidence at present tliat the northern Indians had knowledge of any

but two localities where it oonld be obtained in any quantity. These 
were the Coppermine lliver in the British Possessions, and the Lake 
Superior copper district. The latter aflbrds the most remarkable occur- 
rence of native copper in the world, and the present mines on Keweenaw 
Peninsula — including the famous Calumet and Hecla, the Tamarack, 
Quincy, and others — are of Avorld-wide fame. The same de])Osits were 
worked superticiallj^ over their whole extent long- before the advent of 
Europeans to these shores. 

By referring- to the map of Michigan it will be seen that Keweenaw 
Peninsula is a prominent geographical feature and extends a consid- 
erable distance into Lake Superior. Its northwestern shore and the 
continuation thereof through Ontonagon County is practically parallel 
to the opposite or north shore of the lake. Through the middle of 
Keweenaw Point runs a belt of elevated land which is several hundred 
feet above the lake in some places, and extends from the extreme point 
through the peninsula and Ontonagon County into Wisconsin. This 
elevated belt, which is known as tlie "mineral range," sometimes rises 
Into bluffs which are abrupt on the southeastern or shoreward side, 
but sloi)ing in the op[)Osite direction or toward the lake. The dip of 
the formation composing this range (sandstone, and sheets of igneous 
rock, including conglomerates) is in a general northwesterly direction, 
or towards the lake and the north shore. On Isle Royale, near the 
north shore of the lake, the same formation occurs, but dipping in the 
opposite direction, viz, to the southeast or towards Keweenaw. " Trap" 
rock carrying copper is also found on the north and east shores of the 
lake at St. Ignaceand Michipicoten Island. The copper-bearing series 
of the "mineral range" consists of sheets of igneous rocks — diabase, 
diabase-amygdaloid, and melaphyr — which include beds of conglom- 
erate all carrying native copper. Both of these classes of rocks are 
mined. The famous Calumet and Hecla mine is in tlie conglomerate, 
as is also the Tamarack, while the Quincy, Atlantic, and others are in 
the amygdaloid rocks. 

The product of the mines is divided by the miners into three classes, 
stamp rock, " barrel work," and mass copper. By stamp rock is meant 
that Mdiich contains the copper in line particles and is sent to the pow- 
erful steam stamps to be crushed, in order to separate the grains of 
copper by washing (jigging), just as gold-bearing quartz is stamj)ed. 
"Barrel work" means the pieces of copper which are large enougli 
to be detached from the rock without stamping and are packed in 
barrels and sent directly to the smelters. They vary in size from pieces 
about as large iis the hand to those not too large to be conveniently 
packed in barrels. Pieces too large for this constitute the third class, 
" mass copper," which includes the huge pieces of many tons' weight 
Avhich are occasionally met with. All this cojiper vshows as such in the 
rock, and the ancient miners had only to follow down a promising out- 
croj) showing "barrel work" for a few feet and hammer away the rock 



IN NORTH AMERICA. 181 

from the copper to secure the latter. Wlien tliey caiiie upon mass cop- 
per tliey were compelled to abandon it, after liammcrini;' off i)r()jcctin<;- 
pieces, because they bad no tools I'or cutting' it up and r('m()\iuy it. 
Several instances of this sort have been fouud. 

The ancient mines were not mines in the strict sense of the word, 
because they were not underground workings. As described by AVhit- 
tlesey, who examined them at an early date,* they were shallow pits 
or trenches, and sometimes excavations in the faces of the cliffs, scat- 
tered along the mineral range from Ontonagon to near the end of the 
peninsula. At the time modern mining began they had become mere 
depressions in the ground, owing to the accumulations of earth, leaves, 
and decayed vegetable matter within them. Forest trees were grow- 
ing in them and upon the waste thrown out of them, so that it was 
diflicult to distinguish them from natural depressions due to the weather- 
ing of the rock beneath the soil, or, in some cases, from the hollows 
left by the ui)turned roots of fallen tiees. After their character was 
discovered, however, they served as guides to the uiodern miners, who 
often sank shfifts upon the copper bearing rocks, which were revealed 
by clearing them out. No mine has been oi)ened on the lake that was 
not thus "prospected" by the old miners. Trenches like those on 
Keweenaw Point and Ontonagon, but, if anything, more elaborate, were 
found on Isle Royale, and Sir William Logan mentioned similar work- 
ings on the east shore of the lake near jMaimanse. All of these work- 
ings contained stone hammers or mauls, amounting in all to a countless 
number. 

A few wooden shovels, strongly resembling canoe paddles, were 
found in some of the diggings, together with the remains of wooden 
bowls for baling, birch-bark baskets, and some si)ear or lance heads 
and other articles of copper. In Ontonagon County the old w<n'kings 
were for the most part shallow depressions oidy a few feet<leep. Some 
of them in the bluff jvhich showed outcroi)X)ings of coi)i)er rock were 
liardly large enough to shelter a bear, while others weie larger. In 
Houghton County (i. e., on the Keweenaw promontory) on the (,>uincy 
location, theie were broad and deep pits in the gravel, i)robably dug 
for the float copi^er, lumps of which arc still met with in the neighbor- 
hood. At the Central mine, further outon the point, there was a i)it 
filled in with rubbish, which was at lirst supposed to be mitural. It 
was 5 feet deep and 30 long. On examination, a "flat ])iece of coi)i)er, 
5 to inches thick and 9 feet long, was found, which ibrmed i)art of 
a piece still in the vein. IJioken stone mauls were all about it, show- 
ing that the miners could do notliiiig with it. Its upper edge had been 
beaten by the stone mauls so severely that a lip or s)roJecting rim had 
])een formed, which was bent downwards." Otiier localities toward 
the end of the peninsula and at the Copper Falls location are described 
by Mr. Whittlesey, and as late as 181)0 depressions in the ground, of 



Smithsonian Contributions, vol. xiii, 1862. 



182 PRE-COLUMBIAN COPPEE-MINING 

small diinensions, were pointed oat to tlie writer at the latter place as 
the work of the old miners. Modern miners would regard the whole 
system as nothing more than i^rospectiug work and not mining i)roper, 
as there were no shafts or tunnels or underground workings of any 
kind. As Mr. Whittlesey expressed it, "the old miners performed the 
part of the surface explorers." 

I am fortunate in being able to add to the foregoing the testimony of 
an eye-witness of some other discoveries in this district, viz, that of 
Mr. J. H. Forster, a well-known mining engineer who lived in the dis- 
trict many years. He was at one time superintendent of one of the 
mines, and was engaged on the Portage Lake Ship Canal as State 
engineer when tlie canal was opened, when he discovered some copper 
articles in an ancient grave at that point. He Avrites in regard to the 
discovery of old operations: " The largest mass of float copper found 
in modern times - - - weighed 18 tons, and contained very little 
rocky matter. When found in the Avoods, on the Mesnard location, it 
was covered with moss and resembled a flat trap bowlder. It had been 
manipulated by the ' ancient miner,' and much charcoal was found 
around it. Its top and sides were i^ounded smooth, and marks of stone 
hammers were apparent. All projections — every bit of copper that 
could be detached — had beeu carried away. - - - Subsequent 
explorations disclosed the epidote lode whence the mass came — torn 
from its matrix doubtless by the ice. The mass had been transported 
only about 50 feet and dropped on a ridge. When the lode was stripped 
of the drift the jagged edges of a mass lu place were exposed. It was 
of the same length, thickness, and structure of the ' float.' It was 
observed at the time that if the 'float' could be set up on edge on the 
piece in place it would fit in exactly. A beautiful illustration of the 
power and direction of the glacier was thus afitbrded." Mr. Forster 
was present when the famous Calumet conglomerate lode was opened. 
At that point a small mound was found in the woods, while explora- 
tions were in progress, upon which large pine, maple, and birch trees 
were growing. Eoots of trees still more ancient were found in the 
drift. After stripping off the timber a pit was sunk, which reached 
the solid conglomerate at the depth of ] 5 feet. " But it was a hard 
rock filled with stamp copper only, and could not be mined by the 
ancient miners." 

Numerous stone hammers and biich-bark baskets were found in the 
workings. Mr. Forster thinks the dirt was carried out of the pit in 
these baskets. On the north side of Portage Lake, on the extension of 
the Isle Ivoyale lode (oi)posite Houghton), the drift being shallow, 
"long trenches were dug on the back of the lode 3 feet wide and deep. 
There was much small mass or nugget copper (barrel worki released by 
the disintegration of the soit epidote vein stone." This was thrown 
out, while the earth was thrown behind tlie miner as he advanced, and 
the work resembled that of an expert " navvy." No evidence of deep

mining- could be found. As usual, stone luxmniers and cliarcoal were 
found in tlie trenches. A remarkably deep trench which was tilled 
with earth and leaves was disco\ered at tlie South Pewabie (now 
Atlantic) mine, several miles west of the last locality, which extended 
2 or 3 feet into the solid rock. At the? bottom " was a well-delined 
transverse tissnre vein of (juartz, about l.* feet wide, containing- here 
and there chunks of solid copper. Hy the several pits sunk on the 
course of the vein, ])roof was had that it had been worked sui)erticially 
several hundred feet in length. I walked through it a long distance. 
The surface of the formation was shattered and decomposed, hence the 
old miners could come at the quartz handily. They did lu^t carry the 
rock out to the surface to dump it, but piled it up neatly on each side 
of the drift. At one point I found a handsome specimen of ((uartz and 
copper laid up carefully in a niche. It weighed several pounds. - - - 
As in other cases, we had proof that the ancient miner did not sink 
any shafts and do real mining; he was only a surface gleaner." Of 
the ancient workings on Isle Ivoyale, on the north shore of the lake, 
which were very extensive and have been described as extending 20 
feet and more in the solid rock, Mr. Forster says: " As I understand it, 
these extensive works were upon a high outcrop, promising natural 
drainage. And I should infer from what I heard from Mr. A. C, Davis, 
the agent, and others who opened the Minong mine* that the ancient 
workings were among disturbed shattered rocks, among which were 
found much mass cojiper and barrel work. The ancients Avere after 
these pieces of copper. Mr. Davis found many considerabh^ masses, 
handled and beaten by the ancient men, which were too large for them 
to carry away." t 

*Oii Islo K()ya](\ 

tFroiiialotter to tlie writer. Mr. Forster refers to the views of another mining man 
on the old copper workings on Keweenaw, wlio wns the agi-nt (or snjjerintendent) of 
the Mesnard mine, and his opinions as an export are vahiable. Mr. Forster's letter 
continnes as follows : 

"Mr. .laeob llouglitou, in a paper entitled 'The Ancient Copper Mines of Lake 
Superior,' says, s])eaking of the so-called ancient mines: 

" 'Tlicir mining operations were crude and primitive. The process was to heat 
tlic embedding rocks by bnilding fires on the ontcro])s of tins v(dns or Ixdts, to par- 
tially disintegrate the rocks by contraction produced by the sudden throwing on of 
water, and to compbite the removal of the pieces t)f native cop])er by mauling off the 
adhering ])articles of rock with stone hammers. This is attested by the pres- 
ence in all ancient pits of large quantities of charcoal and numberless hammers, the 
latter sbowing marks of long usage. Tl'e miiicrs Lad not advanced to any knowl- 
edge of the artiticial elevation of water, as is shown by the lact that api)arently, in 
all cases, tlie pits have only been sunk to a de])tli where the limit in num power in 
baling out the water is reached. 

"• The pits, the charcoal, the stone hnnmiers, and the imi)lemen(s and tools made 
of copper are the only relics left of the races that wrought these mines. Neither a 
grave, vestige of a habitaticm, skeleton, or l)one has been found. ' 

''In connection with these last remarks by Mr. Houghton, I beg to state that while 
I was State engineer on the Tortage Lake and Lake Superior Ship Canal, the super- 



184 PRE-COLUMBIAN COPPER-MINING 

At tlie Miimesota mine, in Oiitouagoii County, was i'oand a large 
piece of mass copper wliicli liad been raised some distance iu the exca- 
vation and abandoned by the old Avorkeis, As this was the first large 
mass discovered, and gave rise to considerable speculation, it deserves 
special mention. The account is taken trom Forster and Whitney's 
report on the geology of the Lake Superior cf)pper region, and is as 
follows: In the winter of 1847-''48, Mr. Knapp, the agent of the Min- 
nesota, found an artificial cavern on the mine location containing stone 
hammers, and at the bottom was a vein with jagged i^rojections of 
copper. After the snow had left in the s]»ring he found other excava- 
tions, and particularly one 26 feet deep, filled \Yith clay and a matted 
mass of moldering vegetable matter. On digging 18 feet he came to a 
mass of native copper 10 feet long, 3 feet wide, ar.d nearly 2 feet thick, 
'weighing over 6 tons. '' On digging around it the mass was found to 
rest on billets of oak su])ported by sleepers of the same material. 
This wood, by its long exposure to dampness, is dark-colored and has 
lost all of its consistency. A knife blade may be thrust into it as 
easily as into a peatbog. The earth was so packed around the copper 
as to give it a firm support. The ancient miners had evidently raised 
it about 5 feet and then abandoned the work as too laborious. They 
had taken off every projecting point which was accessible, so that the 
exposed surface was smooth. Below this the vein was subsequently 
found filled with a sheet of copj>er 5 feet thick and of an undetermined 
extent vertically and longitudinally. - - - The vein Avas wrought 
in the form of an open trench, and where the copper was most abundant, 

intendent iu laying water pipes opened a Aery old grave. The grave was in the 
yellow sand, in a grove of Norway pines, near Lake Sa])erior. At the bottom there 
was an exceedingly thin layer of mold, darker than the sand. Some human teeth 
were found and a string of copper Iteads strung on sinews. The sinews, much 
decayed, still held the heads iu place. The copper bead was a small thin j)iece of 
copper about one-fourth of an inch long. It was riidely bent into a cylinder for the 
string to pass through, but was not welded; the edges were iu contact, but not 
fastened together. This grave was at the Grand Portage or carrying place. 

"In dredging, the dipper brought up from the bed of the ship canal where the 
sand drift had originally been at least 25 feet deep, several perfect stone hammers 
and a copper implement which I pronouuced to have been the head and ferule of a 
pike pole. It was about 18 inches long, taperiug, sharp, and solid for two-thii'ds the 
distnnce from the small or lower end. At the upper or pole end the copper had been 
flattened out and then bent round to form a socket for the pole. There Avas a slight 
o]»ening betAveen the two edges of the curved copper; it Avas not joined or av elded. 
Tlie pike Avas bright and shiniug like a clean copper kettle. 

"I sa,Av it, and it was dredged from the bottom of the canal, and its position, as 
regards strata, Avas under the drift or dune sand and ou the hard graA^el and clay 
underlying. I know of no other tinds in that section. The gravel and hard pan 
fouud in the bottom of the dredged canal I regarded as the bed of the ancient 
stream or estuary, now filled up with drift sand blown in from Lake Superior. 
How much the glacial drift had to do in filling up the ancient gorge in which the 
present canal is only a line, I can not say. In some of the marshes cut by the canal 
were fouud three distinct forests, one growing on top of the other, to a depth of 14 
feet."

there the excavatious extended deepest. The trench is j,'enera]ly tilled 
to within a foot of the snrlaoe with the wash from the surrounding 
surface, interiningied with leaves nearly decayed.'' Whittlesey says 
of this mass: '^ Its upper surface and edges were beaten and pounded 
smooth, all the irregularities taken off, and around the outside a rim 
or lip was formed, bending downwards, - - - Such copper as could 
be sei)arated by their tools was thus broken off; the beaten surface 
was smooth and i^olished. 

''On the edge of the excavation in which the mass was found there 
stood an ancient heiidock, the roots of which extended across the ditch, 
1 counted the rings of annual growth on its stump and found them to 
be 290." Mr. Knapp felled another tree growing in a similar position, 
wiiich had 395 rings. "The fallen and decayed trunks of trees of a 
l)revious generation were seen lying across the i»its.'' A shaft was 
subsequently sunk on the lode revealed by this trench, which aa as iu 
rich ground, to a great depth. The abandonment of this mass of cop- 
])er formerly gave rise to conjectures. It Avas supposed that the ancient 
miners were interrupted in their work "by some terrible pestilence 
- - - or by the breaking out of war; or, as seems not less probable, 
by the invasion of the mineral region by a barbarian race, ignorant of 
all the arts of the ancient Mound-builders of the Mississippi and of 
Lake Superior.^'* But from a consideration of tlie evidence of the 
character and scope of the old workings which we now possess it will 
be seen that it is unnecessary to go so far for an explanation. As was 
clearly the case at the Central and Mesnard mines and on Isle lioyale, 
the mass at the Minnesota was abandoned by the old miners because 
they found it im])ossible to get any more ])ieces from it. They had no 
tools which could cut it, and even at the present time mass copi)er is 
the least desirable form in which the metal i^resents itself in the mines, 
on account of the labor and expense of cutting it n\), although there 
are steel tools especially invented for the purpose. The practice of 
hammering oif pieces from mass copper is mentioned by visitors to the 
lake from the French missionaries down to Schoolcraft. There was a 
large mass on the Ontonagon, which has been in the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution for many years, which was considerably reduced iu size in this 
way in the course of a hundred and fifty years by casual visits, 

A great antiquity has been assigned to these workings by some 
writers, and it used to be supposed that a, Imsy industry was suddenly 
interru])ted in them at some time over five hundred years ago. The 
tiee with three hundred and ninety-five rings of growth has been used 
to support an argument that the Avorkings must have been abandoned 
at least as long ago as the middle of the fifteenth (century, or, to be 
exact, reckoning from 1847, before the year 14r)2, This A\M)uld be at 
least forty years before the voyage of Columbus and eighty-four years 
before Cartier visited Montreal. Although it may be true that Avork

186 PRE-COLUMBIAN COPPER-MINING 

ceased at the particular trencli where that tree was felled at the date 
indicated, it does not necessarily follow that all the workings were 
abandoned at the same time. Indeed, the tree which grew on the 
dump of the pit Avhere the Minnesota mass was found did not begin its 
growth until over a hundred years later, or after the French had been 
up the St. Lawrence and there had been considerable traffic with 
Europeans on the seacoast. Hovr hmg a 2)<trtc ante the wliolc system 
had been worked can only be a matter of conjecture. When one 
reflects that many hundreds of men were busily engaged for several 
consecutive seasons, with all the feverish energy born of the modern 
thirst for gold, in the diggings of a)iy one of the i)lacer cam])S which 
are now seen abandoned in Idaho, Oregon, and California, it will be 
apparent that the old miners on Lalve Superior must have taken a long 
time for their leisurely work. Their tools were primitive, their work 
was desultory, and they knew nothing about the desire of wealth. 
Primitive peoples are supposed not to have prosecuted any industry 
.persistently and assiduously, like modern civilized men. Where there 
are no wages, no expenditures, no companies and employees, no stocks 
or fluctuations of the market, nothing even which can be called a 
demand, there is no need of pushing a laborious work. It was also, 
probably, only in the summer, and it may have been only at considera- 
ble intervals, that Keweenaw, Ontonagon, and Isle Eoyale were visited 
for copper. It must also not be forgotten that the ancient miners only 
carried away "barrel work." They were forced to abandon mass 
copper. Barrel work from the excavations and float copper froai the 
neighboring and remote drift wouhl furnish the material necessary for 
all the tools, weapons, and ornaments that have been found, and 
although the quantity of coi)per from these sources was small when 
reckoned in tons, yet the desultory and selective kind of mining which 
produced it, especially if carried on by a comparatively small number 
of persons over such an extensive territory as the mineral range of 
Keweenaw, would naturally require an indefinite length of time. 

From the historical references which will be presently considered, it 
will appear tiiat Keweenaw and Ontonagon' were known as a copper 
district at the time the French arrived in Canada. But as it has been 
inuigined that an extinct race superior in culture to Indians opened the 
trenches and mined copper there, it maybe well to give a comparatively 
modern instance of a similar search for copi)er by Indians l)efore taking 
U]) the historical argument. Such an instance is afforded in Hearne's 
narrative of his Journey from Prince of Wales's Fort in the Hudson's 
Bay Company's territory to the Coppermine River in 1771. Hearne 
was an employe of the Hudson's Bay Company, ami undertook the expe- 
dition in the interest of the company. His party was composed of 
Indians who were not very far removed in i>oint of culture from their 
savage stone-using ancestors of three or four generations previous, and 
no better idea could be gained of the character and life of neolithic man 



IN NORTH A]\[EEICA. 187 

as lie was in that ])art of the world, of his methods of obtniiiiiig subsist- 
ence, liis <;eiieral decree of develoimieiit, and, incidentally, his stealtii 
and ferocity in attack on liis neolithic fellow men, than is contained in 
this book. After a journey of several months throuy,h barren wastes, 
dnrin*;' which he endured the fireatest hardshii)S and was in dan«;er of 
starvation, llearne reached the Coijperinine liivei', and, after his sav- 
ages had surprised and murdered some unsuspecting Esquimaux, he 
visited the copper '' mine," which he thus describes: ''This mine, if it 
deserve that appellation, is no more than an entire jumble of rocks and 
gravel, which has been rent many ways by an eartlnpiake. Through 
these ruins there runs a small river. The Indians who were the occa- 
sion of my undertaking this journey represented this mine to l)e so rich 
and valuable that if a factory were built at the river a ship might 
l)e ballasted with the ore instead of stone. - - - liy their account 
the hills were entirely composed of that metal, all in handy lumps like 
a heai> of pebbles. But their account differed so nun-h from the truth 
that 1 and almost all my companions exi)euded near four hours in 
search of some of this metal, with such i)Oor success that among ns all 
only one [)iece of any size could be found. This, however, was remark- 
ably good, and weighed above 4 ])ounds. I believe the copper has 
formerly been in much greater plenty; for in many places, both on the 
surface and in the cavities and crevices of the rocks, the stones are 
much tinged with verdigris." They afterwards found smaller ](ieces 
of the metal. 

He goes on to remark that the Indians imagined that every bit of 
copper they found resembled some object in nature, but hardly any two 
could agree what animal or i)art of an aninud a given piece was like. 
He also says that by the help of firc^ and two stones the Indians could 
beat a piece of eopi)er into any shape they wished. The Iiulians were 
really living in a copper age of their own. Hearne says: "Before 
Churchill lliver was settled by the Hudson's Bay ('onipany, which was 
not more than tifty years previous to this journey being undertaken, 
the northern Indians had no other metal but copper among them, 
except a small quantity of ironwork, which a, ])arty of them who vis- 
ited York Fort about the year ITlo or 1714 i)urchased, and a few pieces 
of old iron foun<l at ('hur<'hill Biver, which had undonl)tedly been left 
there by ("apt. Monk. This being the cas<', nnndx'rs ol" them from all 
(pKU'ters used every summei- to resort to these hills in search of coi>per, 
of which they made hatchets, ice-chisels, bayonets, kni\es, awls, arrow 
heads, etc. The many ])aths that had l)een beaten by the Indians on 
these occasions and which are yet in many places very i)erfect, espe- 
cially on tlw dry ridges and hills, is snri)rising. The Copper Indians set 
a gr<'at vahu; on their miti\'e metal even to this day, and i)refcr it to iron 
for almost every use exceptthat of a hatchet, a knife, and an awl; for 
these three necessary im])lements c()])pcr makes but a very i)oor substi- 
tute." The Esquimaux tents were plundered of their copper by 



188 PRE-COLUMBIAN COPPER-MINING 

Hearue's Indians. They found arrows ''shod with a triangular piece 
of bhick stone, like slate, or a piece of copper.'' " Their [the Esqui- 
maux] hatchets are made of a thick lump of copper, about 5 or G inches 
long and from 1^ to 2 inches square. They are bevelled away at one 
end like a mortise chisel. This is lashed into the end of a piece of wood 
about 12 or 14 inches long, in such a manner as to act like an adze; in 
general they are applied to the wood like a chisel and driven in with a 
heavy club instead of a mallet. Neither the weight of the tool nor the 
sharpness of the metal will admit of their being handled either as adze 
or ax with any degree of success." 

This testimony of a modern eye-witness to the working and use of 
co^jper by aborigines is very instructive, and it requires little imagina- 
tion to see that we have here a reproduction of the conditions that pre- 
vailed on Keweenaw Point two and three hundred years before. The 
summer visits of the miners, the manufacture of the copper into tools 
and weapons, some to be used in the neighborhood and others to be 
carried away for barter — for Hearne gives the rate of exchange between 
copper and iron from tribe to tribe — were doubtless the same in both 
cases; even the mythical or "medicine" feature of the subject, which 
was noticed by early writers in the stories of the Indians of Lake 
Superior, is not wanting here. The Coppermine story was that a 
woman (who was a magician) was the discoverer of the mine and used 
to conduct the Indians there every year. Becoming offended, she 
refused to accompany the men on one occasion when they left the place, 
after loading themselves with coi)per, but declared that she would sit 
on the mine until it sank with her into the ground. The next year 
when the men returned (women did not go on these ex2)editions) she 
had sunk to the waist and the quantity of copper had much decreased. 
On the next visit she had disappeared and the principal part of the 
copper with her, leaving only pieces here and there on the surface. 
Before this untoward event the copper was so plentiful that the Indians 
had only to turn it over and pick out such pieces as would best suit 
the different uses for which they intended it. 

From this account it will be seen that it is not necessary to imagine 
a mysterious and extinct race more advanced in industrial arts than 
Indians to account for the ancient mines on Lake Superior. Besides, 
other workings requiring as much labor have been carried on by Indians. 
The catlinite or j)ipestoue quarry in Minnesota was worked far into 
the i)resent century. The mica mines in North Carolina, which are 
now worked, were operated in a way and to an extent suggestive of the 
Lake Superior copper mines, and were abandoned, according to Prof. 
Kerr, the geologist who examined them, a little over three hundred 
years ago, or after the arrival of the whites. There are also novaculite 
mines in Arkansas, obsidian workings in the Yellowstone Park, soap- 
stone pottery quarries in several places in the Eastern States and iu 
California, and especially the astonishingly extensive workings at Flint 



IN NORTH AMERICA. 189 

Kidge, Licking County, Ohio, w licie cliert Avas mined and manufactured 
into various articles at " Avorksliops" on the grounds. Some of these 
various diggings were uii<h>ubtedly the work of "Indians;" wliat the 
others were must be left to arcba'ologists to decide. All give evidence 
that the natives of the country were close observers and i)ossessed 
a considerable degree of skill in detecting and obtaining the various 
minerals which pleased their taste or were of use in tl eir simple lives. 

The reason which has been given for supposing that the ancient 
miners on Lake Superior had disappeared before the arrival of the 
whites is that the Indians made no mention of the mines to the French 
and had no tradition about them. But the first French explorers of 
the St. Lawrence, who lett a record of their voyage, were informed by 
the Iiuliaus even of the (xulf — over 1,500 miles away— that copper came 
from a distant country in the west, and this statement was confirmed 
as they proceeded up the river. The same story was repeated a hun- 
dred years later, after settlements had l>een made, and it persisted until 
the source of the copper was found. 

In the account of C-artier's second voyage, in la.');"), given in Hakluyt, 
it is stated that the natives of the south shore of the (hilfof St. Law- 
rence informed him that the way to Canada was toward the west, and 
that the north shore betbre Canada was reached was the beginning of 
Saguenay, "and that thence comnu'th the red coi)per of them named 
Caignetdage."'' Subsequently, at Hochelaga (Montreal), the natives 
described to the French the voyage up the St. Lawrence and the Ottawa 
to Saguenay. "^Moreover, they showed us with signs that the said 
three fals being i>ast, a nmn nnglit sayle the space of three moneths 
more alongst that river, and that along the hills that are on the north 
side there is a great river which (even as the other) commeth from the 
west, we thought it to be the river that runneth through the countrey 
of Saguenay; and without any sign or question mooved or asked of 
them, they tooke the chayne of our Captaines whistle which was of 
silver, and the dagger-haft of one of our fellow Mariners, hanging on 
his side being of yellow cojjper gilt, and shewed us that such stufife 
came from the said Iliver." " Our Captaiiui shewed them redde copper, 
which in their language they call Caignetadze, and looking towards 
that countrey fin a ditt'erent dii-ection from Saguenay], with signs asked 
them if any came from thence, they shaking their heads answered no; 
bat they shewed us that it came from Saguenay." "But the right and 
ready way to go to Saguenay is up that way to Hochelaga [Montreal], 
and then into anothei' | river] that commeth from Saguenay ]the Ottawa] 
and then entei-etli into the foresaid river ]th<^ St. Lawrence] aiul that 
there is yet one moneths sayling tliither. Moreover they told us and 
gave us to understand that there are people - - - and many 
inhabited towns and that they have great store of gold and red copper 
- - - and that beyond Saguenay the said river entereth into two or 
three great lakes, and that there is a sea of fresh water found, and as 



100 PRE-COLUMBIAN COPPER-MINING 

they have heard say of those of Saguenay, there was never iiiau heard of 
that fouud out the end thereof, for as they tokl us they themselves 
were never there." 

Allowing for the difirtculty of communicating by signs and the many 
chances of misunderstanding, of which the interpretation of the Indian 
signs to mean gold is doubtless an instance, this is a geographical descrip- 
tion which can almost be followed on the map, and the account shows 
that the St. Lawrence Indians knew that the copper they had came from 
a place in the west where there were great lakes and a " sea of fresh 
water." This was all hearsay with them, as they had never visited the 
distant country, which was inhabited by other tribes. But it seems 
evident enough that there was at that time a widely diffused knowledge 
of the source of the copper, which would hardly have been the case if 
the supiily had ceased two or three generations before. When, over a 
hundred years later, French settlements had been established and 
traders and missionaries began to push forward to the great " sea of 
fresh water," they continually encountered the statement that copper 
could be found on its shores, and Indian guides tiually took them to 
the precise localities where the metal had formerly been mined, and 
whence it was still occasionally obtained. Copper specimens, some- 
times of large size, all reported as coming from Lake Suijerior, were 
not uncommon, at this time, as the following extracts show, and it seems 
evident that Indians still visited the old diggings and carried away 
such pieces of copper as they could iind. 

The Abbe Sagard, who was a missionary to New France about the 
year 1030, gave an account of the resources of the country in his 
"Graml Voyage du pays des Hurons," jjublished at Paris inl63L*. He 
did not penetrate as far as the upper lakes, but says that there were 
copper mines in that distant country which might prove profitable if 
there was a white population to support them and miners to work them, 
which would be the case if colonies were established. He saw a speci- 
men of co])per from the mines, which, he says, Avere 80 or 100 leagues 
distant from the country of the Hurons. In Margry's Decoureiies et 
etahlinsements des Francais, Premiere partie, voyages des Francais surles 
grands lacs^ 1614-1684, p. 81, is an extract fr<nn a letter relating to an 
exploration for cojjper written by Sieur Patoulet in Canada to Colbert 
in Paris. It is dated at Quebec, November 11, IGOO, and is as follows: 
"Messrs. Joliet and Pene, to whomJM. Talon paid 100 and 400 livres 
resjiectively, to exi)l()re for the copper deposit which is above Lake 
Ontario, specimens iron) which you have seen, and ascertain if it is abund- 
ant, easy to work, and if there is easy transportation hither, have uotyet 
returned. Tlie first named should have been here in September, but 
there is no news of him yet, so that a report of what may be expected 
of the mine must be postponed until next year." On page 05 of the 
same volume is a letter from Jean Talon to the king, dated Quebec, 
November L>, 1071, in which occurs the following reference to copper, 



IN NORTH AMERICA. 101 

one locality of wliicli had then become known: " The copper specimen 
from Lake Superior and the ^'antaoiui^on (Ontonagon) Iviver which I 
send, indicates that there is some deposit or some river bank which 
yichls this substance in as pure a state as could be wislied, and more 
than 20 rrenchmen have seen a mass of it in the lake which they esti- 
mate at eight hundred weight. The Jesuit fathers among the Ottawas 
use an anvil of tliis metal which weighs about 100 pounds. It only 
remains to tind the source of these detached pieces." lie then gives 
some description of the Ontonagon lliver, in which he attempts to 
account for the tormation in situ of the copper specimens fonnd in its 
neighborhood ({jalcis de ee mc.sfrdl, evidently float copper), and goes on 
to say: "It is to be hoped that the frequent Journeys of the Indians 
and French, who are beginning to make expeditions in that direction, 
will rt^sult in the discovery of the place which furnishes such pure 
metal, and that without expense to the king." 

The passages from the Jesuit Kelations, which have been often quoted 
in this connection, show that the mining districts were well known to 
the Indians. Father Dablon, in the Kelations for l()01)-'70, describes 
these places, of which he was informed by the Indians. The tirst was 
Michipicoten Island, on the east shore of the lake ; then came St, Ignace, 
on the north shore, and then Isle Koyale, "celebrated for its copper, 
where could be seen in the cliffs several beds of red copper separated 
from each other by layers of earth." The other principal locality was 
the Ontonagon river, from which place the French had received a cop- 
per specimen three years previously wliich weighed 100 pounds. The 
Indian (Ottawa) women of this region, the father says, while digging 
holes for corn, used to find pieces of copi»er (float copper) weighing 10 
and I'O pounds. A hundred years later Alexander Henry mentions the 
same thing of this locality, and adds that the Indians beat the pieces 
of cojjper into bra(;elets and spoons. Father Dablon goes on to say 
tliat opinions diflered as to the place the Ontonagon copper came from 
sonui thinking it was near the forks of the river and along the eastern 
branch (near the old workings), while other guessers placed it elsewhere. 

The informati(»n tlie Indians gave was not si)ontaneous, for b'ather 
Dablon says that it ie(|uired some address to induce them to reveal the 
mineralogical secrets which they wished to conceal from the whites. 
This reluctance to give information about mineral localities has sur- 
vived down to a very recent period, and stories are known to the older 
residents of the coi)])er district, some of them amusing enough, illus- 
trating this trait. At all events. Father Dablon's Indians knew pre- 
cisely where the old mining localities were. He says he was assured 
that in the land to the south there were deposits (ininc.siti the French 
word) of the metal in various places. He had just been speaking of 
Keweenaw Point, but the connection is not close enough to wai-rant 
the inferenc.e that he meant immediately to the south of the point. If 
that could be shown, there would be a diiect reference to the "dig- 
gings" on the peninsula. 



192 PRE-COLUMBIAN COPPER-MINING 

But most of the misapprehension in this matter has arisen from the 
use of the misleading term " mine" in connection with this district- 
We associate witli that term shafts or tunnels and under-ground work, 
ings, none of which ever existed on the lake. The ancient miners weie 
not miners in the proper sense of the word as were those prehistoric 
men who mined copper ore iu the Tyrol, or those other prehistoric minevs 
who sank shafts and ran drifts in the chert deposits of Belgium. On 
the contrary, they were, as has been abundantly shown, only surface 
prospectors, and appear to have dug for copper wherever they happened 
to find it. If the pieces were loose float in the gravel, as at the Quincy 
location, and as the Ottawa squaws found them at Ontonagon, in 1(!70, 
and the later Indians in Henry's and Schoolcraft's time, well and good, 
they " mined " them and beat them into shape. If the copper was in 
huge masses on the surface as at the Mesnard they "mined" it in that 
shape by working off pieces with their stone hammers. If the copper 
was fast in the rock they broke it out by hammering the rock away 
from it, and if the rock extended into the ground they dug down around 
it, broke away what " barrel work " they could, and treated the " mass " 
as they did that already dug for them on the surface. They had uo 
idea corresponding to the word mine. Hence there is no apparent 
reason why there should have been mu(;h of a distinction in the minds 
of people who were not miners between jjlaces where they dug copjjer 
out of the gravel, as in the trenches at Quincy, and places where they 
were obliged to dig around rocks to obtain it. 

It is largely the undue emj)hasis upon the idea of mining that has led 
writers to create another race than the Indians to practice that skilled 
art on Keweenaw Point, Isle Royale, and the Canadian shore. The false 
or exaggerated idea has led to an equally exaggerated inference. All 
this is wen illustrated in a passage in Wilson's "Prehistoric Man," 
describing an interview with an old Chippewa chief some fifty years 
ago. He was asked about the ancient copper miners, and declared that 
he knew nothing about them. The Indians, he said, used to have copper 
axes, but until the French came and blasted the rocks with powder 
they had no traditicms of the copper mines being worked. His fore- 
fathers used to build big canoes and cross the lake to Isle Royale, where 
they found more copper than anywhere else. This is a distinct tradition 
enough of one famous copper locality — Isle Royale — although it maybe 
unreliable from its late date, but the story shows how the belief that 
the Indians had no tradition of the old mines could originate. The old 
chief very properly denied knowing about a thing that never existed. 
His ancestors never carried on mining, but only digging. Deep mines, 
where blasting is done, which very likely he had seen, were, of course, 
unknown to them. 

Like this old chief. Father Dablon's Indians showed full traditional 
knowledge when tliey told him of the mineral localities where, several 
generations before, copj)er had been extensively dug. The ancient 



IN NORTH AMERICA. 193 

trenches in the woods had long been covered and contained no visibh; 
copper. They possessed only an antiquarian interest to which the 
Indians were strani^ers. and also, as Father Dablon relates, his Indian 
iViends were not disposed to give more information than they could 
lielp. 

The first systematic exploring or "i)rospecting" party to search for 
the Ontonagon lode was sent out from (Quebec about the same year that 
Father Dablon described the place, viz, 1G()9. The expedition returned 
without accomplishing its object for want of time, and was met on Lake 
Erie by La Salle's jyarty going to tne Mississippi. No mining was done 
there until a hundred years later under Alexander Henry, 

The foregoing extracts from the account of Cartier's voyage, the 
Abbe Saga rd, the Jesuit Relations, and Margiy, show the continuity 
of the ancient or pre-Columbian raining on Lake Superior and the mod- 
ern. As soon as the French arrived at the St. Lawrence in 1535, they 
found the natives knowing proj)ortionately as much about the distaut 
source of the copper they i)ossessed as the ordinary e.astern citizen does 
now. Over a hundred years later, after settlements had been made, 
there was still living knowledge that copper came from Lake Superior, 
and especially the Ontonagon River, Avhere it was easy to find float 
copper. But during this long i)eriod active importation of European 
articles had been going on so that, as the Chippewa chief exi)lained, 
native industries, including tlie search for copjter, luid been interrupted. 
Iron articles, knives, hatchets, weapons, and innununable other desira- 
ble things made it unnecessary for the Indians to exert themselves in 
ex])k)iting the old source of supply. Rut when the French began to 
imiuire for coi)per they were taken to the precise localities where tlie 
metal had formerly been obtained which, like all nnning districts, were 
fall of abandoned and forgotten workings, and tliey were shown the 
metal in i)lace. 

Native copper, as has been said, occurs sparingly in several places 
in the eastern part of the country. In the Appalachian region ores olt 
copper occiu" and have been extensively mined, but native copi)er does 
not occur there except as a mineialogical rarity. Nevertheless it has 
been suggested that co])per was produced in that ]»art of the country 
in pre-Columbian times. If tliis were so there should be evidences q; 
old mines and of smelting operations of some kind, because copper ore

iiaw and Uiitonagon in the North, has remarkably few copper relics 
from the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee. Tlie idea 
doubtless arose from the statements in the accounts of the ^Spanish 
explorers of this region and of the French and English colonies on the 
coast. De Soto's march was a continuous pursuit of an ignis fatuiis. 
He was told that gold or copper and other riches were in the Appala- 
chians, and was kept i)erpetually on the move after them, while they 
eluded him in the most tantalizing manner. He did find pearls, and 
probably in large quantities; the contents of graves show that that 
form of wealth really existed. But that other form of wealth — "a 
melting of gold or copper" — which he coveted, kept moving before him 
from town to town and tribe to tribe all through his weary journey^ 
and he never found it. The Spaniards on the Florida coast in the follow- 
ing years were persuaded that there was great mineral wealth of some 
kind in the Appalachians, and told of a town in the region where the 
minerals were supposed to be, which they called La Grand Copal. This 
tovrn was said to be GO leagues northwest of St. Helena, on the South 
Carolina coast. 

De Soto's march was undertaken in 1539. In 1562 the French estab 
lished a short lived colony at Port Eoyal, S. C, under Capt. Kibault, 
which was succeeded two years later by another at the river of May 
(tlie St. John's), in charge of Eeue Laudonniere, the history of which, 
with its tragic end, was brought prominently to notice by Parkman 
some years ago. Laudonniere wrote a full description of the resources 
of the country, in the course of which he says (Hakluyt's translation), 
" there is found amongst the savages good quantitie of gold and silver 
which is gotten outof theshippes that are lost upon the coast, as 1 have 
understood by the Savages themselves. They use traffique thereof one 
witli another. And that which maketh me the rather believe it, is that 
on the coast towards the cape, where commonly the shippes are cast 
away, there is more store of silver than towards the north. Neverthe 
less, they say that in the mountains of Appalatcy there are mines of 
copper, which I thinke to be golde." From these mountains came " two 
stones of fine christal," which ATere presented to the French, together 
with a number of pearls, and they learned from the Indians that there 
was "an infinite quantity of slate stone, wherewith they made wedges 
to cleave their wood," in the same mountains. A " king" of the coun- 
try lying near these mountains sent Laudonniere '' a i^lateof a miuerall 
that came out of this mountaine, out of the foot whereof there runneth 
a streame of golde or copper, as the savages thinke, out of which they 
dig up the sand with an hollow and drie cane of reed until the cane be 
full; afterward theyshake it, and hnde that there are many small graines 
of copper and silver among tliis sand ; which giveth them to understand 
that some rich mine must needs be in the mountaine."

the country twenty years before, this Trould be a most interesting

account of jniinitive painiin.ii\ nii opeiation faiiiiliar to nil uold ]>i'0- 
spectors and known in many i)aits of the world. Jhit the snspicion 
arises that tlie Indians bad watclicd the Spaniards oi)eiatin<;' in tliis 
way in the streams in their search for gold and were describing; their 
method. The description, moreover, could not apply to coi)])er, 
although it is true of gohl, which is found in the sands of the streams, 
and is "panned out" in the manner described. The etfortto find coi)- 
per from this mineral region was unavailing. On JJibaidt's arrival to 
succor Laudonniere's ]iarty, tlie Indians offered to conduct him, in a 
few days' journey, to the mountains of Apalatcy. "Jn those mouu- 
taines, as they sayd, is found redder co})per, which they call in their 
language Sieroa Pira, which is as much to say asredde mettal],wheieof 
1 had a piece, wliich at the very instant I showed to Captaine Eibault, 
which <'aused his gold finer to make an assay thereof, which reported 
unto him that it was ]).erfect golde." This assay confirms, or perhaps 
was the cause of, Lau<lonniere's surmise that the copper of Apalatcy 
was gold. Jt is not easy to understand at this distance Avhy there 
should have been any difliculty in recognizing the metal at once. 
There was evidently some misunderstanding or misinterpretation of 
the questions and the answers between the French and Indians in ref- 
erence to the red metal, so that while the French meant <-opper the 
Indians understood gold. At any rate, the French saw no copper from 
the Ai)palachians. 

Sir AValter Ealeigli planted a cohmy at Eoanoke Island in l.">8r), of 
which Kalph Lane was su])erintendent. Jle, also, soon heard of min- 
eral wealth in the mountains to the west, and was eager to find copper 
there. It must be remembered that it was a great disappointment in 
Europe to find that the land which Columbus and his successors had 
discovered was a continent, and incessant attempts were made to find a 
way through or around it to the south seas and (-athay, which were 
continued into the ]>reseidj century. Therefore lva]i»h liane wrote that 
'* the discoverie of a good mine by the goodnesse of Ciod, or a passage 
to the south sea. or some way to it, and nothing els can bring this 
countrey in request to be inhabited ])y our nation." And particularly 
with reference to the rumoied mine to the west, he says: "And that 
which made me most desirous to have sonuMloings with the Mangoaks,* 
either in friendship or otherwise to have had one or two of them pris- 
oners, Avas, for that it is a thing most notorious to all the countrey, 
that thei'e is a Province to the which the said Mangoaks have recourse

the sa^•ages of the Chawanook, and. all them to the Westward, but also 
to all them of the maine; the countrey's name is of fame and is called 
('haunis Temoatan.

196 PRE-COLUMBIAN COPPER-MINING 

"The uiinerall they say is Wassader which is copper, but they call 
by the name of wassader every mettall whatsoever; they say it is of 
the colour of our copper, but our copper is better than theirs, and the 
reason is for that it is redder and harder, whereas, that of Chauuis 
Temoatan is very soft and pale. - - - Of this mettall the Man- 
goaks have so great store, by report of all the savages adjoining, that 
they beautify their houses with great i)lates of tlie same." Chauuis 
Temoatan, or the mineral country, was said to be twenty days' journey 
from the Mangoaks. 

This account contains a variation of the descrii)tion given the French 
twenty years before, of washing or panning out, but in the English 
account there is a distinct reference to melting or smelting. The Indi- 
ans told Lane that after the material from the stream was caught in a 
bowl it was "cast into a lire, and forthwith it melteth, and doeth yield 
in live parts at the first melting, two parts of mettall for three parts of 
oare." It is impossible to understand this statement as it stands. It 
may ]»ossibly have referred to the use of fire in getting out the mica, or 
may have been a tradition of some Spanish operations obscured by 
time and confused by interpretation. The story survived into the next 
century. The English, however, did not see this operation, nor did 
they see any " greate plates" of copper. The 0]ily things of the kind 
were small, probably like those found in graves and mounds. "An 
hundred and fifty miles into the maine," Lane continues, " in two towns 
we saw divers small plates of copper, that had been made, as we under- 
stood, by the inhabitants that dwell further into the country, where, as 
they say, are mountains and rivers that yield also white grains of 
mettall wijich is to be deemed silver." If the Indians had possessed 
large plates the English would doubtless have seen them as well as the 
small, and some of them would have turned up before now, as the 
smaller ones have, in graves. 

That extensive mines really existed in the region indicated by the 
Indians, which produced a peculiar mineral in abundance, Avill appear 
when we put together the Spanish, French, and English accounts of the 
rumored mineral wealth and the region from which it came, and com- 
pare them with the results of modern discovery. The Spaniards were 
after gold, and learned, as they believed, that it was to be found in the 
Appalachians, because when they asked after a country rich in mineral 
they were referred there. Laudonniere sx)eaks of a singular mineral 
which was sent to him, which occurred in plates and was found in the 
ApiJalachians, together with "christal" and slate stone; and Kalph 
Lane hears of a "marvellous and strange" mineral which occurred in 
large plates with which the Indians adorned their houses. The mine, he 
says, was " notorious" in the M^liole country, and was in the mountains 
to the west of Ivoanoke, This mineral, which was not copper or any 
ore of copper, occurring in large plates which were paler and softer 
than copper, was undoubtedly mica, and the ancient mines Avhich were

tlie cause oi" the early milling exeiteineiit were rediscovered in tlie 
monntains of Xortli Caioliiia in 18(>8, Prof. Kerr, wlio was State geol- 
ogist of North Carolina, thus describes them:* "There is one poiut of 
great inteiest connected with the history of inica-niiiiing in this State 
which it is worth while to refer to in this connection. This industry 
is not really new here; it is only revived. Thei)resent shai'ts and tunnels 
are continually cutting into ancient shafts and tunnels, and hundreds 
of the spurs and lidges of the mountains, (all over iAIitchell County espe- 
cially), are found to be honeycondjcd with ancient workings of great 
extent, of which no one knows the date or history. In ISOS uiy atten- 
tion was first called to the existence of old mine holes, as they are 
called in the region. lU'ing invited to visit some old Sptaiish .silrer 
mines a few miles south of Bakersville, 1 found a dozen <n- nioK^ open 
pits, 40 to 50 feet wide by To to 100 feet lo]ig, filled up to 15 or 20 of 
depth, disposed along the slo[>ing crest of a long terminal ridge or spur 
of a neighboring mountain. The excavated earth was ])iled in huge 
heai)s about the margins of the pits, and the whole overgrown with the 
heaviest forest trees, oaks, and chestnuts, some of them 3 feet or more 
in diameter and some of the largest belonging to a former generation 
of forest growth, fallen and decayed, facts which indicate a mininuim 
of not less than three hundred years. There is no appearance of a mineral 
vein and no clew to the object of these extensive works, unless it was to 
ol)tain the large plates of mica, or crystals of kyanite, both of which 
abound in the coarse graidte rock. - - - Since the develoi)ment of 
mica-mining on a large scale in .AI itched and the adjoining counties it 
has been ascertained that there are hundreds of old pits and connecting 
tunnels among the spurs and knobs and ridges of this rugged region, 
and there remains no doul)t that irnning was carried on here for ages 
and in a very systematic and skillful way; for among all the scores of 
mines recently opened, I am inlbrmcd that scarcely one has turned out 
l)rolitably which did not follow the old workings and strike the ledges 
wrought by those ancient nuners. The pits aw. always open 'dig- 
gings,' never regular shafts; and the earth and debris often amount to 
enormous heaps.*' 

This description would api>ly almost word Ibr word (o the Lake

or .10 up to several hundred pounds in weight, which split icadily into 
plates or sheets, sometimes A feet in diameter, and would cut 10 by 20

tbeir graves, was naturally prominent iu their minds when the strangers 
were inquisitive about riches, and tliey answered according to their 
light. It does not appear that copper was known to the Southern 
Indians except as an article of barter, as it was all along the coast, but 
mica held the place with them in point of production that copper occu- 
pied with the Northern Indians. 

Reviewing, now, the whole evidence— historical, mineralogical, and, 
to a slight extent, archiii'ological — it appears that when this continent 
was revealed to Europeans the natives of the country were in the full 
neolithic period, but were using copper to a slight extent. They were 
probably mining it in a desultory way in the Keweenaw workings just 
as they were mining mica in the mountains of Isorth Carolina. How 
long this had been going on it is impossible to say. The metal was 
principally used for ornamental purposes in the South, where it was 
scarce, but where it was plentiful, in the North, and particularly toward 
the center of production, it was put to a i)ractical use. There is at 
present no evidence that the Indians had any knowledge of smelting, 
which art is necessary to a real metal age. The progress from stone, 
through copper, to bronze could hardly be expected on the northern and 
eastern parts of this continent, because there was no tin available in 
the northern and eastern parts of the country with which to make 
bronze. To be sure the Indians had distant neighbors in Mexico and 
Central and Southern America, some of whom possessed the rudiments 
of smelting and were in an incii^ient bronze "age," from whom a knowl- 
edge of smelting, whereby copper could be obtained from its ores, 
might possibly have been acquired in the course of centuries by the 
slow process of aboriginal intercourse, if all native industrial develop- 
ment had not been interrupted by the intervention of Europeans. As 
it was, however, it seems clear that metallurgy was not known among 
the North American Indians when this continent was discovered. 



THE rOLYXESTAX BOW.* 



Bv E. Tkegeak. 



Pei'liiips ono ot'tlie most puzzlinu' inoblems known to aiitliropolo,iiists 
is to aceoniit foi- the apparent dislike shown by the fair Polynesians 
for the use of the bow^ and arrow. They fonnd the mighty weapon of 
tlie arelier in the hands ot almost every Melanesiau or Papuan inliabi- 
tant of the neighboring- islaudvS; they had experience of its fatal powers, 
and yet, except in the case of tlie Tongans, the weapons appeared to 
be viewed with disfavor and neglect. 

The bows used by the Tongans in the days of Cook were slight and 
by no means powerful instruments. Each bow was titted with a single 
arrow of reed, which was carried in a groove cut for that purpose along 
the side of the bow itself. By the time that mariner arrived among 
these islanders, in 18()(), they had possessed themselves of more power- 
ful bows and arrows, probably j)rocured from Fiji or imitated from 
Fijian weapons, as constant intercourse of either warlike or pacific 
character was then going on between the Friendly and Fijian islands. 
Moreover, they had also procured guns at that epoch. 

Tlie Hawaiian weai)ons were spears, javelins, clubs, stone axes, 
knives, and slings; the use of the bow being contiiied to rat shooting. 
The Tahitians used the bow only as a sacred ])laything; the bows, 
arrows, quiver, etc., being kept in a certain place in charge of appointed 
persons and brought out on stated occasions. The arrow was not 
aimed at a mark, but merely shot off' as a test of strength and skiil, 
one archer trying to shoot farther than another. The Samoans did 
not use the bow, but fought with the club and spear, the sling being 
the missile weapon, as it also was in the Mar<piesas. 

In regard to New Zealand, the subject has been handled at any 
length only by two writers. The first was JMr. C Phillips, whose 
paper appeared in the Transactions of the Xcw Zealand Institute, vol. 
X, p. 97. The article did not deal with the bow pro})er so nuich as with 
the weapon known to the Maoris as kotaha, which consists of a sfick 
and whip with wiiich a spear is thrown. ^Ir. Phillips made some 
incidental remarks on this paper, which ])rovoked Mr. Colenso to reply 
in an article published in the Transactions of the Xeic Zealand Institute, 
vol. XI, p. 100.

200 THE POLYNESIAN BOW. 

Mr. Coleuso's argunieiit, briefly summarized, refers to the subject as 
follows. He considers — 

First. That the bows and arrows found in the hands of Maori children 
were probably imitated from models shown to them by Tupaea, the 
Tahitian interpreter brought to New Zealand by Capt. Cook, or, per- 
haps, fiom models shown by foreigners, some of whom — notably a 
Hindoo, a Manpiesan, and a Tahitian — were resident among the Maoris 
when the Kev. Mr. M;irsdeu arrived in 1814. 

Se<'ond. That neither Tasmaii, Cook, Parkinson, Forster, Crozet, 
Polack, Cruise, Nicholas, Marsden, nor any other of the early visitors 
to New Zealand mention seeing the bow or hearing of its use. That 
Mr. Colenso himself, m his frequent journeys about the country (in 1834) 
and continual listenings to stories of war, never heard of the bow 
being used in combat. 

Tliird. That there is no mention in old legends of the bow being 
used as a weapon, either in the stories of the destruction of monsters, 
the deaths of chiefs in battle, or in the lists of arms, although these 
lists are given with great fidelity and attention to detail. 

Of these three divisions, the first is not scientifically decisive. It is 
possible, and even probable, that the jMaoris were taught the use of 
the bow by early visitors, but it can not now be proven. The bow 
might have been kept as a childish toy, although not used as a 
weapon; exactly, for examiile, as with the modern English, with whom 
bows and arrows are playthings, although but a few years ago (ethno- 
logically speaking) they were the national weapons. 

The second argument is from negative evidence. There may have 
been bows and arrows in New Zealand, and yet they may not have 
been produced or si)oken of in the presence of new-comers; but that 
such a reticence occurred is most imiu'obable, and, although the evi- 
dence IS negative, it is of great value. Few impartial people will 
belive that the bow was a weapon of the New Zealander during the last 
century if no explorer or missionary saAV or heard of it.* 

The third argument is an exceedingly important one. If in the lists 
of weapons mentioned in New Zealand tradition the bow has no place, 
the conviction left in the minds of most Maori scholars will be that the 
omission marks the absence of the bow itself from Maori knowledge.t 

Time, however, has a modifying effect on opinion, and the one thing 
certain to come to the interested student of anthropology is a wonder- 
ing faith in the power of Time to dissolve and form and redissolve not 

*In the Aiiclland Weckh/ Is^'eirs of April 16, 1892, is au account of an old Pakclia- 
Maori named John Harmon, who came to New Zealand a child in 1805, and is now 
dead. "He told a tale of a battle between the Ngati-whatua and the N»ati-maru in 
the Thames Valley which was fought out with bows and arrows." It would jier- 
haps be well if some member of this Society resident among either of these tribes 
would make inquiries among the old men as to what circumstance gave rise to Har- 
mon's story. 

+ 0n the other hand, I do not know of any list of weapons or legend of monster- 
killing which includes the kolaha as a weapon. Yet I am informed by Mr. Percy 
Smith that not only was lie shown an old ruined pa which Avas couqueicd by spears 
or darts throAvn more than a quarter of a mile by means of the '• whip," but that he 
k nows that they wcie in use at least two hundred years ago.

only tlie tribos of the cartli, but our Icnowh'd.m' t'onceniiu.u' tlicni. I 
received lately a lettei' IVoiu u iVieud in IIk^ north of the North Ishmd 
of New Zealand, who iiilbriued inc th;it in di.Q^uing' a drain upon his 
property at Manuapai he eanie upon ai bow in a. i)erfect state of [)reser- 
vation. It was lyin<;- in a bed of sandy clay, the surface of which was 
apparently undisturbed and vir5j;iu. The tinder proceeded (in the usual 
fashiou which horrities arclueologists) to clean his treasure trove; but, 
luckily, before Ik- had tinished his work of scraping' and oiling the bow, 
a friend interfered, and the original soil adheics to a portion of the 
weapou, 

I have deposited the bow in the ^Museum for safe-kee]»iug. It is C 
feet 43 inches in length ; in shape reseuibUng the bows of Fiji, the New 
Hebrides, and other ^lelanesian islands, it is almost certainly a war- 
bow, and it would try the strength of an athletic nuin to draw an arrow 
to the head upon so stiff au arc. It was unaccompanied by any lelics 
whatever. 

Several methods of accounting for the deposit of the bow in the 
locality might be suggested. It might have been buried in modern 
times by a Euroiiean or by a A'isiting native of the South Sea islands. 
This is improbable, as the weapon must have been of some value to its 
owner, and is too large to have been easily lost. Again, the bow, if 
not a Maori we;ipon, might have belonged to some prehistoric; inhabi- 
tant. There seems to be a concensus of tradition that tlie Polynesian 
and Malayan islands were once peo])led by races exterminated or 
driven inland by the present occupiers of the seaward positions. In 
New Zealand many scholars believe that the I*Iaori immigration dis- 
possessed a peoi)le then in occupation.* If, on farther testing, the bow 
should be found to be of Melanesiau pattern, but of New Zealand wood, 
it would strengthen the theory that a people of Melanesian (u-igin once 
occui)ied this country. 

The evidence brought forward by Mr. Colenso in his paper nuikes it 
almost certain that no Maori within historical times has used the bow 
as a weapon. But did the ancient Maori use the bow ? If we turn to 
comparative philology the auswc^r is probably in the afSrmative. The 
evidence stands thus:

■v/ PHAIf. In New Zealand the equivalent for the Polynesian i^is 
TT'if (as fare, '^ a house," becomes ichare, etc.); consequently we must 
expect to find the word as whana. The Maori word whana means "to 
recoil or spring back as a bow;" ''a spring made of a bent stick, as a 
trap." When we compare the compound words, tawhana, bent like a 
bow; l-owhana, bent, bowed; Itorowhana, bent, bowed, etc., there can 
be little doubt but that whana. originally with the Maori meant what 
it did with all other Pacific islanders, viz, "a bow," and that they 
knew its use as a weapon. Just as the Maori words amatiatia, taurna^ 
etc., for the double canoe or ontriggered canoe prove former use, even 
though the modern Maori knows notbing of such vessel. The other 
Maori forms, pana., "to thrust away," and lu^nga, "to throw," have 
taken slightly divergent meanings. 

The Maori word pcwa, meaning " arched, bow-shaped," and " the 
eyebrows" (with its comiDOund, koroptewa, " a loop or bow") also proba- 
bly signified a weapon. Petva has been iDreserved as "bow" by the 
Motu people of New Guinea (a Polynesian colony among Papuans), but 
may be a foreign word, since it has no universahty in the Pacific as 
farm has. 

* On page 61 of Mr. Codrington's " Malanesian Languages" appears a note by Mr. 
Fison as to the Tongans having got the word /aw a with the bow from Fiji. No 
authority is greater with regard to Melanesiau speech than is the opinion of Mr. 
Fison, but I believe in this matter that he had been misled by his native informant. 
In the lirst place, the bow had been in use long before the lifetime of the native in 
question began, and this makes the etymology of the name beyond his knowledge 
except as a guess ; and, in the second, the wide distribution of the word among 
Polynesians makes it probable that the Tongans used the same word as the rest of 
their nation, and did not need to borrow from Fiji.

is the added misfoituue that the fmiu of words is not accurately 
repeated, and in its inaccurate form d(»es not mean what is true. It is 
often hardly vorth while remarking this to those Avho make these state- 
ments, because the words convey to them little or uo signitication, and 
are to them as true as any other unmeaning sentence. Tlie connection 
between electricity and tlie aether is certainly not, as fai* as is known, 
well described by saying that " electricity is the aether," and we can not 
say with any certainty that electricity is or is not a vibration. Hertz's 
exi)eriments have given an experimental proof of MaxweH's theory that 
electrica.l phenomena are due to tlie a-ther, ami llerzt's exi)eriments 
deal with vibiations. One can not however say, because the pressure 
of 15 pounds ]»er square inch exerted by the atmospheie is due to the 
air, that therefore "pressure is the air"; nor even, because a person 
who studied the projx'rties of the air had studied them by means of 
sounds propagated through it, can one assert that '' pressure is a vibra- 
tion." It is to be hoiked lu) one will now assert that •' electricity is 
pressure." The example is gi\en to illustrate the absurdity of the state-

any new theory. And yet one comes across [)eoi)le who, after listening 
to an interesting lecture Lord IJayleigh might give, illustrated by Mr. 
Boys's sound-pressure meter, would make the above statements, and 
really think they understood them. 

The subject is very diflllcult; one that has engaged the attention of

lowiug even as far as others cau go into this wonderful region. If the 
present articles cau give to most who read them glimpses which un- 
fold intelligible ideas of even the outskirts of this region, it is all that 
any writer can reasonably expect who is not one of those masters of 
exposition who combine the highest scientilic and literary abilities. 

Consider for a minute tlie question at issue. That electric and mag- 
netic pheuoinena are due to the same medium by which light is propa- 
gated — that all-pervading medium by whose assistance we receive all 
the energy on this earth that makes life here possible, by which we 
learn the existence of other Avorlds and suns, and analyze their struc- 
tures and read their histories; that medium which certainly pervades 
all transparent bodies, and probably all matter, and extends as far as 
we know of anything existing: this wonderful all pervading uiedium is 
the one we use to i)ush and juill with when we act by means of electric 
and magnetic forces; and remember that we can pull molecules asunder 
by this means as well as proiiel trains and light our houses. The forces 
between atoms are controlled by this all-pervading-medium, which 
directs the compass of the mariners, signals around the globe in times 
that shame e'en Shakespeare's fancy, rends the oak, and terrifies crea- 
ation's lords in the lightning flash. It was a great discovery that proved 
all concord of sweet sounds was due to the medium that supplies the 
means of growth to animals and plants, and deals destruction in the 
whirlwind; and yet the 80 miles depth of our air is but an infinitesimal 
film compared with the all-pervading illimitable aether. 

That there is a medium by which light is transmitted in a manner 
somewhat analogous to that by which the air transmits sound has been 
long held proved. Even those who held that light was due to little 
particles shot out by luunnous bodies were yet constrained to super- 
I)Ose a medium to account for the many strange actions of these parti- 
cles. ISTow, no one thinks that light is due to such particles, and only a 
very few of those who have really considered the matter think that it can 
be due to air, or other matter such as we know. How does light exist 
for those eight minutes after it has left the sun and before it reaches 
the earth ? Between the sun and earth there is some matter, no doubt, 
but it is in far-seiiarated parts. There are Mercury and Venus, an<l 
some meteors ami some dust JU) doubt, and wandering molecules of 
various gases, many yards apart, that meet one another every few days, 
perhaps, but no matter that could pass on an action from point to point 
at a rate of thousands of miles each second. Some other medium must 
be there than ordinary gross matter. Something so subtle that the 
planets, meteors, and even comets — those wondrous fleecy fiery clouds 
rushing a hundred times more quickly than a cannon-ball around the 
sun — are imperceptibly impeded by its presence, and yet so constituted 
as to take up the vibrations of the atoms in these fiery clouds and send 
them on to us a thousand times more rapidly again than the comet 
moves, to tell us there is a comet, and teach us what kinds of atoms

vil)rat(' ill its tail. How can a medium have those contraiy piopeitics!? 
How can it oft'er au imjierceptible resistance to the comet, and yet take 
up the vibrations of the atoms ? These are liard questions, and science 
has as yet but dim answers to them, hardly to be dignified by the name 
of answers — rather dim analogies to show that the properties su[)posed 
to CO exist, though seeming contradictory, are not so in reality. 

One of the most beautiful experiments man knows — one fraught 
with more suggestions than almost any hundred others — is that by 
which a ring of air may be thrown through the air for many yards, and 
two such rings may hit, and shivering, rebound. These rings move 
in curved jiaths past one another witli almost no resistance to their 
motion, urged by an action not transmitted in time from one ring to 
another, but, like gravitation, acting wherever a ring may be, and yet 
the air through Avhich they move can take u)> vibrations from the rings 
showing thus that there is no real contradiction between the ])roperties 
of things moving through a medium unresistedly in certain i)aths round 
one another, and yet transmitting other motions to the medium. This 
same air can push and pull, as wlien it sucks up waterspouts and deals 
destruction in tornadoes. Hence there seems no real contradiction 
between a medium that can imsh andjiull and transmit vibrations, and 
yet offer no resistance to such fragile, light, and large-extended things 
as rings of air. 

It is important to understand something about the properties that 
this medium must have in order to explain light, electricity, and mag- 
netism, because there is no use expecting a medium to possess contra- 
dictory i)roperties. It is also well to recollect that for about tw^o hun- 
dred years the existence of a medium by which light is propagated has 
been considered as certain, and that it would be very remarkable if 
this medium, which can be set in vibration by material atoms, acted 
on matter in no other way. It seems almost impossible but that a 
medium whicli is moved l)y atoms, and which sets them into motion, 
should be able to mo\e sucli armies of atoms as we deal with in material 
bodies. Even if we knew nothing of electricity and magnetism, it 
would be natural to look for some imiiortant })liciioiiieiia. due to the 
action of this medium on masses of matter. Th(> medium is n vera cttusa^ 
and if it can be sliowii that tlie same set of properties by which electric 
and magnetic forces are explained will also enable it to transmit vibra- 
tions that have all the properties of light, it will surely be beyond a 
doubt but that these electric and magnetic actions are those very ones 
Ave would naturally expect from the medium that i»roi»agates light. 

Clerk 3laxwell some years ago showed that this was so, but as far as 
any facts known at that time could prove, there were other theories of 
electric and magnetic actions which ex])lained tlieir known i)henomenn 
without the intervention of a medium. The matter stood somewhat 
thus: The older thecuMes of <'lectric and nmgnetic force explained all 
phenomena then known. These older theories assumed that electric

and magnetic forces were propagated instantaneously througbout 
space; that if the sun became electrified it would instantaneously 
begin to induce electricity on the earth; that there would be no delay 
of eight minutes, such as occurs between a light occurring on the sun 
and its acting on the earth. Similarly in the case of magnetic actions, 
they were supposed to be propagated instantaneously throughout 
space. It was, no doubt, known that it took time for an electric signal 
to be transmitted along a conducting cable. This is however a very 
much more complicated i^roblem than the simple one of supposing a 
body surrounded by a non-conductor to be electrified. Will it or will 
it not instantaneously act on all conductors in space, and begin to in- 
duce electrification on them ? As far as was known such actions as 
this, actions tlirough non-conducting sj^ace, were instantaneous. Such 
an instantaneous action could not be transmitted by the air. Air can 
not send on from point to point any effect more rapidly than a molecule 
of air can moving carry it forward, and that is only a little faster than 
the velocity of sound; and there was every reason to know that electric 
induction through air was propagated much more rapidly than that. 
There was every reason to believe that electric and magnetic forces 
acted without any material intervention. 

In fact, in these older theories there was no thought of any medium 
to transmit the actions; it was supposed that electricity acted across 
any intervening space instantaneously. There is no real difficulty in 
such a supposition. As far as we know gravitation is just such an 
action, and as far as was then known there was no experiment that 
disproved the supposition in the case of electric and magnetic actions. 
It was known that no experiment had ever been devised that could test 
whether this action was instantaneous or whether it was propagated 
at a rate such as that of light. It was known that this action was 
enormously more rapid than sound, but as light goes about 300,000 
times as fast as sound there was plenty of spare velocity. Tiiese older 
theories explained all that was known, and they suiJj)osed nothing as 
to the existence of an intervening medium. Any theory that assumed 
that induction was not instantaneous, but that energy having been 
spent on electrification at one place work would be done at another 
after some time, as in the case of light generated on the sun not reach- 
ing the earth for eight minutes, any theory that assumed such a dis- 
appearance of energy at one place and its re-appearance at another 
after the lapse of some time must assume some medium in which the 
energy exists after leaving the one place and before it reaches the 
other. A theory that only supposes instantaneous action throughout 
space need not assume the existence of a medium to transmit the action, 
but any theory that supposes an action to take time in being trans- 
mitted from one place to another nuist assume the existence of a 
medium. Now, Maxwell's theory assumed the existence of a medium, 
and along with that led to the conclusion that electric and magnetic 



hertz's experiments. 207 

actions were not propa.uatod instiuitiineously, bnt were propagated 
witli the velocity ol" light. Accordiuu' to his theory an electric distnrb- 
ance occurring on the sun wonhl not ])i'odnce any <'i'fect on the earth 
tor about eiglit minutes after its occurrence on the sun. No exi)eri- 
nients were known to test the trutli of this deduction until the genius 
of Jlertz brought some of the most beautifully conceived, ingeniously 
devised, and hiborinusly executed of ex])eri7nents to ;>. brilliantly suc- 
cessful conclusion, and demoiistrutcd the juopagation of electric and 
magnetic actions with, the velocity of light, and thereby i)rove<l experi- 
mentally that they are due to that sanu' wonderful, all-pervading 
medium by means of which wc get all the energy that makes life here 
possible. 

The i)roblem to be solved was, arc e]ectri<' and nmgnetic actions propa- 
gated from place to place in a Unite time, or are they simultaneous 
everywhere? How can exiieriments be made to decide this? Consider 
the corresponding problem in sound. What methods are there for de- 
termining the rate at which sound is i)ropagated? An experiment that 
measures the rate can tell whether that rate is tiuite or whether it is 
infinitelj^ great. There are two important methods employed for meas- 
uring the velocity of sound. The second is really only a moditication 
of the first direct method, as will be seen. The direct method is to nmke 
a sudden sound at a ])lac{i and to find how long afterward it reaches 
a distant jdacc. In this juethod there is required some practically in- 
stantaneous way of comnmnicating between the two i)laces, so that the 
distant observer may know when the sound started on its journey. A 
modification of the method does not require this. It depends on tiie 
use of refiection. If a sound be made at a distance from a refie(;ting 
surface, the interval of tinu' between when the sudden sound is made and 
when the retlectcd sound (the echo) retui'iis, is the time the sound took 
to travel to the retlcctor ami back again. A well-known modification 
of this method can be apjdied if we can secure a succession of smldcn 
sounds, such as taps, at accurately equal intervals of time, We oiigi- 
nate such a regular succession of taps, and alter the distance from llie 
rertector until each refiected tai)Occuis sinuiltaneously with the succeed- 
ing incident ta]>. Or if the distance at which we can i)ut the refiector 
be sufficiently great, wc may arrange it to l)e such tint a icfiected tap 
is heard sinuUtancously Avith the second, third, fouilh, or any desired 
succeeding ta]). The coincidence of the taps with their refiections can 
be fairly accurately observed, ami a fairly accurate estimate foi med of 
the velocity of sound, /, c, the velocity at which a con>pressingor rare- 
fying of the air is i)roi)agated by the air. Instead of altering the dis- 
tance of the source of sound from the reflector, we may ourselves move 
about between the souiceand the refiector, and we can find some places 
where the reflected taps occur simultaneously with the incident taps, 
and some ])laces where they occur between the incident on(\s. This is 
pretty evident, for if we start from the source toward the reflector, as 



208 hertz's experiments. 

we approach it we get the reflected taps earlier and the incident ones 
later than when we were at the source. How far must we go toward 
the reflector in order that the original and reflected taps may again ap- 
pear simultaneous*? We must go half the distance that a tap is propa- 
gated during the intervnl between two taps — half the distance, because 
in going away from the source we are approaching the reflector and so 
make a double change — we not only get the original ones later, but we 
also get the reflected ones earlier, and so coincidence will have again 
been reached when we have gone half the distance between any pair 
of compressions travelling in the air. Now, if the taps succeed one 
another slowly, the distance in the air between any two of them trav- 
elling through it will be considerable; any one of them will go a con- 
siderable distance from the source before its successor is started after 
it. If, on the contrary, they succeed one another rapidly, the distance 
between the travelling taps will be small. 

In general, if v be the velocity with which a tap travels, and t be 
the interval of time between successive taps, the distance apart of the 
taps travelling in the air will be X = vt. By arranging, then, that the 
taps shall succeed one another very rapidly, /. e., by making t small, 
we can arrange that A may be small, and that consequently the ois 
tauce between our source of sound and the reflecting wall may be 
small too, and yet large enough to contain several places at distances 
of ^X apart between the source and the reflector where the incident 
and reflected taps occur simultaneously. Now, a very rapid succes- 
sion of taps is to us a continuous sound, and where the incident and 
reflected taps coincide we hear simply an increased sound, while at 
the intermediate jflaces where the incident taps occur in tlie inter- 
vals between the reflected tai)s we do not hear this eftect at all. In 
the case of a succession of sharp taps we would hear in this latter 
place the octave of the original note, but if the original series be, 
instead of taps, a simple vibration of the air into and out from the 
reflector, the in and out motions of the incident waves will in some 
l)laces coincide with the in and out motions of the reflected wave, and 
then thei'e will be an increased motion, while at intermediate places 
the in and out motions of the incident wave will coincide with rhe 
out and in motions of the reflected wave, and no motion, or silence, 
Avill result, so that at some places the sound will be great and at inter- 
mediate ])laces small. 

This whole eflect of having an incident and reflected wave travel- 
ling simultaneously along a medium can be simply and beautifully 
illustrated to the eye by sending a succession of waves along a chain 
or heavy limp rope or an India-rubber tube fixed at the far end so as 
to reflect the waves back again. It will then be found that the 
chain divides up into a series of places Avhere the motion is very 
great, called loops, se})arated by points Avhere the motion is very 
small, called nodes. The former are the places where the incident and

roHected motions rciiitbrcc, wliilr the lattc'i" are where tlu^sc iiiotioiis 
arc o]>i)()S('(l. if we iiioasure the distaiicc between two nodes, we know 
tliat it is hair the distance a wave tra\-els durini;- a single ^•il)ration of 
the string, and so can calcnlate the velocity of the wave if we know 
the rate of vibration of the string. This is the se(;ond method men- 
tioned above for finding the ^■elocity of sound. There are so many 
things illustrat<'d by this \ibrating chain that it may be well to dwell 
on it for a few moments. We can make a wave travel up it, either 
rapidly or slowly, by stressing it much or little. If a wa\e travels 
rapidly, we must gi\'e it a \eiy rajtid vibration if we Avish to have 
many loo[)s and nodes between our source and the reflector; for the 
distaiu'c fronrnode to node is half the distancje a wave travels during 
a vibration, and if the wave goes fast the vibration must be rapid, or 
the distance from node to node will be too great for there to be many 
of them within the length of the chain. 

Another i>oint to be observed is the way in which the chain moves 
when transmitting a single wave and wlien in this condition of loops 
and no<les, /. c\, transmitting two sets (»f waves in opposite directions. 
There are two ditterent motions of the parts of the chain it is worth 
considering separately. There is in the f.rst place the displacement 
of any ]\\\k up or down, and in tlie second i)lace there is the rotation 
of a link on an axis which is at right angles to this up and down 
nn)tion. Xo\a , when waves are going nj) the cliain those links are 
rotating most rapidly which are at any tinn^ most dis])laced; it is the 
links on the tops and bottoms of waves that are rotating most rapidly. 
On the other hand, in the case of looi)s and nodes the links in the 
mi(hlh» of hjops never rotate at all; they are much displaced uj) and 
down, but they kec)) ])aralh'l to their original direction all the time, 
while it is the links at the nodes where there is no displacement up 
and down that rotate first in one direction and tlien l)ack again; 
there is. in tiie loops and nodes c(»ndition, a separation of the most 
rotating and the most dis])laced links which does not occur in the 
simi)le wa\c. 'iliere is a corres])onding relation between the most 
rotat<Ml and tiie most rapidly moving links. Tiiese are tlie same 
links haltway up tlie simple waves, but in the loo])s and nodes the 
most rai»idly moving links never rotati^ at all, while those at the 
nodes that get most lotated are not displaced at all. These remarks 
will be seen hereaft<'r to throw light on some of the phenomena ob- 
served in connection with Hertz's experiments; hence their importance. 

It Mill be observed that the method of measuring the velocity at 
which a disturbance is ])i()pagated along a string, and which depends 
on measni'ing the distance between two nodes, is really only a moditica- 
tion of tin- direct m<'thod of linding out how long a disti'.i'bance takes 
to go from one )>lace to another: it is on<' in which we make the waves 
register ujion Themselves how long they took, and so does not iciiuire 
us to have at our dis|)osal any method of sending a message from one

place to another more quickly than the waves travel, and that is very 
important when we want to measure the rate at which disturbances 
travel that go as fast as light. If tlie wave travels very fast, we must 
have a very rapid vibration, unless we have a great deal of space at 
our disposal; for the distance between two nodes is half the distance 
the wave travels during one vibration, and so will be very long if the 
wave travels fast, unless the time of a vibration be very short. 
Hence, if we wish to make experiments in this way, in a moderate 
sized room, on a wave that travels very fast, we must have a very 
rapid vibration to start the waves. 

II. 

In the preceding article a general method of measuring the velocity at 
which a disturbance is propagated was described. It depended on be- 
ing able to ])roduce a regular succession of disturbances at equalinter- 
vals of time. These were made to measure their om'u velocity by 
reflecting them at an obstacle. Then, by the interference of the inci- 
dent and reflected waves, a succession of looi>s and nodes are produced 
at intervals of half the distance a disturbance is i)ropagated during 
the time between two disturbaiu^es. It is a general method applicable 
to any sort of disturbance that takes time to get from one place to 
another. It has been applied over and over again to measure the rate 
at which various kinds of disturbance are X)ropagated in solids, liquids, 
and gases; it was applied in a inodified form years ago, to measure the 
length of a wave of light; and, within the last year, some of the most 
beautiful experiments on iihotography ever described are applications 
of this principle by Ilerr Wiener and M. Lippman. 

There are three things essential to this experiment: (1) Some method 
of originating waves; (2) some method of reflecting them; (3) some 
method of telling where there are loops and where there are nodes. 
We will take them in this order: 

(1) How can we expect to originate electri(; weaves? If, when a body 
is electrified positively, the electric force due to it exists sinuiltane- 
ously everywhere, of course we can not expect to produce anything like 
a wave of electric force travelling out from the body; but if, when a 
body is suddenly electrified, the electric force takes time to reach a 
place, we must su])pose that it is propagated in some way as a wave of 
electric force from the body to the distant place. This of course 
assumes that there is a medium which is in some peculiar state when 
electric force exists in it, and that it is this peculiar state of the medium 
which we call electric force, existing in it, that is propagated from one 
place to another. It must be carefully borne in mind what sort of a 
thing this is tliat we call the electric force at any place. It is not a 
good name, — electric intensity would be a better one; but electric force 
has come so i.iuch into use it is hardly to be expected tliat it can be 
eradicated now. Electric force at any place is measured by the 



hertz's experiments. 211 

iiK'clianicnl lone that would be exerted at the place if a unit ({uautity 
of electricity were there. It is not a force itself at all; it is only a 
descrii)tion of the condition of the medium at the ])lace which makes 
electricity there tend to move. The air near the earth is in such a con- 
dition that everything immersed in it tends to move away from the 
earth with a finxe of about 1.2C dynes for each cul)ic centimeter ol the 
body, i. c. each cubic centimeter tends to moxc with a force of 1.26 
dynes. Kow, the condition of the air that causes tliis is never described 
as volume (brce existinj>' at the ])lace, tlioui^h we do describe the corre- 
sponding" condition of the a'ther as electric force existing' there; and as 
volume force existing would be a very objectionable jjescription of the 
condition of the air, when being at different pressures at various levels, 
it tends to make bodies move with a force i)ro])orti()nal to their vol- 
ume, so electric force existing is a very objectionable description of the 
condition of the fether, whatever it is, that tends to make bodies move 
with a force in proportion to their electric charges. We know more 
about the structure of the air than we do about the ;ether. We know 
that the structure of the air that causes it to act in this way is that 
there are more molecules jumping about in each cubic centimeter near 
the earth than there are at a distance, and we do not know yet what 
the structure of the a4her is that causes it to act in this remarkable 
way; but even though we do not know the nature of the structure, we 
know some of its effects, by means of wiiich we can measure it, and we 
can give it a name. Although we know very little indeed about the 
structure of a piece of stressed india rubber, yet we can m<^asure the 
amount of its stress at any pLice, and can call the india rubber in this 
peculiar condition "^stressed india rubber." As a matter of fact, we 
know a great deal more about the peculiar condition of the a4her that 
we describe as "electric force" existing, than we do about the 
"stressed india rubber;"' and there is every reason to suppose that the 
structure of the a'ther is, out of all comparison, more simple than that 
of india rubber. 

When sound-waves travel through the air, they consist of compres- 
sions followed by rarefactions, and between them the i>rcssure varies 
from i)oint to point, so that here we have travelling Ibrward a stnu'ture 
the sanu; as that of the air near the earth, and waves of sound might 
be described as consisting ol' a succession of positive and negative 
"volume Ibrces" travelling forward in tlu^ air; tliis ibrm of expression 
would no doubt be objectionable, but still if all we knew a1)out the 
properties of the air near the earth was that it tended to make bodies 
move away from the earth with a force proportional to their volume, it 
is quite likely that this condition of affairs near the earth might have 
been described as the existence of a "volume forc<'" near the eaith, 
and when it was discovered that this action was due 1o a medium, the 
ail-, it would have been <pute natural to describe this state of the air as 
"volume force" existing in it: an(l then wlien waves of sound were ob 



212 hertz's experiments. 

served it would be quite natural tluit they should be described as 
waves of "volume force," especially if the ouly way in which we could 
detect the presence of these waves was by observing the force exerted 
on bodies immersed in it, which was proportional to their volumes, and 
which we happeii to know is really due to differences of pressure at 
neighboring' points in the air. We do not know what is the structure 
of the aether that causes it to exert force on electrified bodies, but we 
know of the existence of this property, and when it is in this state we 
say that "electric force" exists in it, and we have certain ways by 
which we can detect the existence of " electric force," one of which is 
the production of an electric current in a conductor, and the consequent 
electrification of the conductor, and if this is strong enough we can 
produce an electric spark bet^veen it and a neighboring conductor. 
When a conductor is suddenly electrified, the structure of the aether 
which is described as electric force existing in it travels from its neigh- 
borhood through the surrounding icther, and this is described as a 
wave of electric force travelling through the surrounding aether. It is 
desirable to be quite clear as to what is meant by the term a wave of 
electric force and what we know about it. We know that it is a region 
of wther where its structure is the same as in the neighborhood of elec 
trifled and some other bodies, and owing to which force is exerted on 
electrified bodies, and electric currents are pi-oduccd in conductors. 

We may then I'easonably expect that, if it is possible to electrify a 
body alternately positively and negatively in rapid succession, there 
will be produced all round it waves of electric force — that is, if the 
electric force is i)ropagiited by, and is due to, a medium surrounding 
the electrified body, if electrification is a special state of the medium 
that fills the space between bodies. 

(2) The next question is: How can we reflect these waves? In order 
to reflect a wave, we must int<'rpose in its way some body that stops it. 
What sort of bodies stop electric force? Comluctors are known to act 
as complete screens of electric force, so that a large conducting sheet 
would naturally be suggested as the best way to reflect waves of elec- 
tric force, lieflection always occurs when there is a change in the 
nature of the medium, even though the change is not so great as to 
stop the wave, and it has long been known that, besides the action of 
conductors as scieeus of electric force, different non-conductors act 
differently in reference to electric force by differing in si)ecific inductive 
capacity. Hence we might expect non-conductors to reflect these 
waves, although the reflection would probably not be so intense from 
them as from conductors. Hence this question of how to reflect the 
waves is pretty easily solved. All this is on the supposition that there 
really are waves. If electric force exist everywhere simultaneously, 
of course there will be no waves to reflect, and consequently no loops 
and nodes produced by the interference of the incident and reflected 
waves.

(.'>) Tlu' third i)r(»i)l<Mii is: How can we expect to detect wliere there 
are loops and wiiere tiieic are nodes .' Recall the eflects of electric force. 
It tends to move electrilied bodies. If then an electrified body were 
placed in a loop it would tend to vibrate ui> and down. This method 
may i)ossibly be employed at some future tinu\ and it may be part of 
the cause of photographic actions, for these have recently been conclu- 
sively proved to l)e due to electric tbrce; but the alternations of electric 
force from positive to nepitive that have to be emi)loyed are so rapid 
that no body large enougli to be easily visible and electrified to a^ reason- 
able extent could be expected to move sutticiently to be visibly dis- 
turbed. It is possible that we luay tind some way of detecting the 
vibrations hereby given to the electritied ions in an electrolyte; and 
it has recently been stated that waves originated electrically shake the 
elements in sensitive photographic films sufficiently to cause changes 
that can be develo])ed. The other action of electric force is to produce 
an electric current in a conductor and a resultant electrification of the 
conductor. Two effects due to this action have actually been used to 
detect the existence of the wave of electric force sent out by a body 
alternately electrified positively and negatively. One of these is the 
heating of the conductor by the current. Several experimenters have 
directly or indirectly used this way of detecting the electric force. The 
other way, which has proved so far the most sensitive of all, has been 
to use the electrification of the conductor to cause a spark across an 
air s]>ace. Tliis is the method Hertz originally emph)yed. A pnori^ 
one would not have expected it to he a delicate method at all. It takes 
very considerable electric forces to produce visible sparks. On the 
other hand, the tinu' the force need last in order to ])roduce a spark is 
something very small indeed, and hitherto it has not been possible to 
keep up the alt<'ruate electrifications for more than a minute fraction of 
a second, and this is the reason why other api)arently more promising 
metiiods have failed to be as sensitive as the nu4hod of [»roducing 
s])arks. If two conductors be placed very close to one another in 
such a direction that the electric force is in the line joining them, their 
near surfaces will be op])ositely electrified when the electric force 
acts on them, and we may expect that, if the force be great enough 
and the surfaces near enough, an electric spark will i)ass I'rom one to 
the other. This is roughly the arrangement used by Hertz to detect 
whether there are loops and nodes between the originator of the waves 
and the reflector. 

Now aiises the problem of how to electrify tlie body alternately i)osi- 
tivcly and negatively with sufficient rapidity. How rapid is '• with suffi- 
cient rai)idity'if" To answer tiiis we nuist form someestimate of how raj)- 
idly we may expect the waves to be propagated. According to Maxwi'Ifs 
theory they should go at the same rate as light, some 3tH),()(H), (»()(» of 
meters per second, and it is evident that if we are going to test Maxwell's 
theory w«^ must mak<* provision f()r sufficiently rai)id electric \iliratious

to give some lesult if the waves are propagated at tliis enormous rate. 
The distance from a node to a node is half the distance a wave travels dur- 
ing a vibration. If we can produce vibrations at the rate of 300,000,0(10 
per second, a wave would go 1 metre during a vibration, so that, with 
this enormous rate of alteinatiou, the distance from node to node would 
be 50*^^'"* We might expect to be able to work on this scale very 
well, or even on ten times this scale, /. e., with alternations at the rate 
of 30,000,000 per second, and 5 metres from node to node, but hardly 
on a much larger scale than this. It almost takes one's breath away 
to contemplate the i)roduction of vibrations of this enormous rapidity. 
Of course they aie very much slower than those of light; tbese latter 
are more than a million times as rapid; but 300,000,000 per second is 
enormously more rapid than any audible sound, about a thousand 
times as fast as the highest audible note. A short bar of metal vibrates 
longitudinally very fast, but it would have to be about the thousandth 
of a centimeter long in order to vibrate at the required rate. It would 
be almost hopeless by mechanical means to produce electric alterna- 
tions of this frequency. Fortunately there is an electric method of pro- 
ducing very rapid alternate electritications. When a Leyden jar is 
discharged through a wire of small resistance, the self-induction of the 
current in this ware keeps the current running after the jar is dis- 
charged, and re-charges it in the opposite direction, to immediately 
dischargee back again, and so on through a series of alternations. This 
action is quite intelligible on the hypothesis that electrifications con- 
sists in a strained condition of the aether, which relieves itself by means 
of the coiiductor. Just as a bent spring or other strained body, when 
allowed suddenly to relieve itself, relieves itself in a series of vibra- 
tions that gradually subside, similarly the strain of the ;ether relieves 
itself in a series of gradually subsiding vibrations. If the spring 
while relieving itself has to overcome fricticnuil resistance, its vibra- 
tions will rapidly subside; and if the friction be sufticiently great, it 
will not vibrate at all, but will gradually subside into its position of 
equilibrium. In the same manner, if the resistance to the relief of the 
strain of the medium, which is offered by the conducting- wire, be 
great, the vibrations will subside rapidly, and if the resistance of the 
wire be too great, there will not be any vibrations at all. 

Of course, quite independently of all frictional and viscous resistances, 
ai vibrating spring, such as a tuning-fork that is producing sound-waves 
in the air, which carry the energy of the fork away from it into the sur- 
rounding medium, will gradually vibrate less aud less. In the same way, 
quite independently o. the resistance of the conducting wire, we must 
expect that, if a discharging conductor produces electric Maves, its 
vibrations iiuist gradually subside owing to its energy being gradually 
transferred to the surrounding' medium. As a consequence of this the 
time that a Leyden jar takes to discharge itself in this way may be very 
short indeed. It may i)erforni a good many oscillations in this very 



HEliTZ's EXPERIMENTS. 215 

slioit time, but then each oscilhitioii takes an exeeedingiy short time. To 
.net some idea of what (luaiitities we are dealing- \vith,eousider the rates 
ol' oscilhition which wonhl give wave-lengths that were short enough to 
be conveniently dealt with in laboratories. Three liundred million per 
second would give us waves 1 meter long; consider what is mcaut by 
1(K),0U0,U(H) i)er second. Wemayget some conception of it by calculating 
the time corresponding to one hundred million seconds. It is more than 
three years and two montlis. The pendulum of a clock would have to 
oscillate three j^ears and two months before it would have performed 
as many oscillations as we require to be performed in one second. The 
])endulum of a clock left to itself without weights or springs to drive it, 
and only given a single impulse, would practically cease to vibrate after 
it had i^erformed 40 or 50 vibrations, unless it were veiy heav}-, /. c., had 
a great store of energy or were very delicately suspended, and exposed 
only a small resistance to the air. A light pendulum would be stopped 
by communicating" motion to the air after a very few vibrations. The case 
of a Leyden Jar discharge is more like the case of a nmss on a spring 
than the case of a pendulum, because in tlie cases of the Leyden Jar 
there is nothing quite analogous to the way in which the earth pulls 
the i>e.ndulum : it is the elasticity of the aether that causes the»electric 
currents in the Leyden jar discharge, Just as it is the elasticity of the 
spring that causes the motion of tlie matter attached to it in the cas(^ 
of a mass vibrating on a spring. 

It is possible to push this analogy still furthei. Under wiuit condi- 
tions would the spring vibiate most raj>idly !? When the s])rihg was 
stiff and the mass small. What is meant by a spring" being stiff? When 
a considerable force only bends it a little. This corres])onds to a con- 
siderable electric force only electrifying the Leyden Jar coatings a little, 
i. c. to the Leyden jar having" a small capacity. We would conse(}uently 
expect that the discharge of a Leyden Jar with a small capacity would 
vibrate more rapidly than that of one witli a large c;ii)a<'ity, and this is 
the case. In order to make a Leyden Jar of very small capacity we nmst 
have small conducting surfiices as far i-.part as possible, and two sepa- 
rate [)lates or knobs do very well. The second condition for rapid vibra- 
tion was that the mass moved siiould l)e small. In the case of electric 
currents what keeps the current running after the plates have become 
discharged and re-charges them again, is tlie so-called self-induction of 
the current. It would be well to look upon it as magnetic energy stored 
up in the oether around the current, but whatever view is taken of it, it 
evidently corresponds to the mass moved, whose energy keeps its mov- 
ing after the spring is unbent, and re-bends the spring again. Hen(!c we 
may conclude that a small self-iiuluction will favor rapidity of oscillation, 
and this is the case. To attain this we must make the distance the cur- 
rent has to run from plate to plate as short as i^ossible. The smaller the 
plates and the shorter t\ui connecting wiie the nun^e rapid tlie vil)ra- 
tions; in fact, the rapidity of vibration is dire(;tly proportional to the 



21G hertz's experiments. 

linear dimensions of the system, and for tlie most rapid vibrations two 
spherical knobs, one charged positively and the other negatively, and 
discharging directly from one to the other, have been used. 

Hertz in his original investigations used two plates about ^C'" square, 
forming parts of the same plane, and separated l)y an interval of about 
()()""• Each plate was connected at the center of the edge next the other 
l)late with a wire about 3(^"' long, and terminating in a small brass 
knob. These knobs were within 1! or 3""" of one another, so that 
when one plate was charged positively and the other negatively they 
discharged to one another in a spark across this gap. An apparatus 
about this size would produce waves 10 or 12 meters long, and its rate 
of oscillation would be about 30,000,000 per second. As the vii)ration 
actually produced by these oscillators seems to be very complex, the 
rate of oscillation can only be described as '^ about " so and so. In a 
subsequent investigation Hertz employed two elongated cylinders 
about 15*='" long and about 3"" in diameter, terminated by knobs 
about 4*^'" in diameter, and discharging directly into one another. 
Such an oscillator produces waves from 00 to 70"" long, and conse- 
quently vibrations at the rate of between 1(K),000,000 and .500,000,000 
per second. Most other experimenters have used oscillators about the 
same dimensions as Hertz's larger a})paratus, as the effects produced 
are more energetic; but many experiments, es])ecially on refraction, 
require a smaller wave to be dealt with, unless all the apparatus used 
be on an enormous scale, such as could not be accommodated in any 
ordinary laboratory. When we art^ thus aiming at rapid rates of vibra- 
tion, it must be recollected that we can not at the same time expect 
many vibrations after each impulse. If we havc^ a stiff spring- with 
a small weight arranged so as to give a lot of its energy to the 
surrounding medium, we can not expect to have very much energy to 
deal with, nor many vibrations, and, as a matter of fact, we find that 
this is the case. The total duration of a spark of even a large Leyden 
jar is very small. Lord Rayleigh has recently illustrated this very 
beautifully by his photographs of falling*drops ami breaking bubbles. 

We can not reasonably expect each spark to have more than from ten 
to twenty effective oscillations, so that, even in the case of the slower 
oscillator, the total duration of the spark is not above a millionth of a 
second. It is very remarkable that the incandescent air (heated to in- 
candescence by the sparlc) should cool as rapidly as it does, but there 
is conclusive evidence that it remains incandescent after the spark 
proper has ceased, and consequently lasts incandescent longer than the 
millionth of a second. \V^hat is seen as the white core of the spark 
may not last longer than the electric discharge itself, and certainly 
does not do so in the case of the comparatively very slowly oscillating- 
sparks thj)t have been analyzed into their component vibrations by 
l)hotograi>hing them on amoving plate. The incandescent air remain- 
ing in the path of such discharge is probably the conducting iiath 



hertz's experiments. 217 

tliroug'h wliicli the osciilatiiig- ciiriciit rushes backward and forward. 
Once the air gap lias been broken tlirough, tlie character of the air gap 
as au opponent of the passage ol" electricity is coniph^tely changed. 
Before the air gap breaks down it requires a considerable initial dif- 
ference of electric pressure to start a current. Once it has been broken 
down, the electric current oscillates backward and forward across 
the incandescent air gap until the whole difterence of electric pressure 
has subsided, showing that the broken air-gap has become a conductoi' 
in which e\ en the feeblest electric pressure is able to produce an elec- 
tric current. If this were not so, Leyden jars would not be discharged 
by a single s]»ark. 

All this is (pute in accordance with what we know of air that is — or 
even has lately been — incandescent; such air conducts under the feeb- 
lest electric force. All this is most essential to the success of our oscil- 
lator. ( )nly for this valnable pro[)erty of air, that it gives way suddenly, 
and thence forward offers but a feeble opposition to the rapidly alternat- 
ing discharge, it would have been almost impossible to start these rapid 
oscillations. If we wish to start a tuning fork vibrating we must give 
it a sharp blow; it will not do to press its prongs together and then let 
them go slowly; we must apply a force which is short-lived in compari- 
son with the i)eriod of vibration of the fork. It is necessary then that 
the air-ga]) must l)reak down in a time short compared witli the rate of 
oscillation of tlu^ discharge; and when this is rcipiired to be at the rate 
of 400,000,000 per second, it is evident liow very remarkably suddenly 
the air-gap breaks down. From the exi)eriments themselves it seems as 
if any even minute roughness, dust, etc., on the discharging surface 
interfered with this rapidity of break-down; it seems as if the points 
spluttered out electricity and gradually broke down the air-gap, for 
the vibrations originated are very feeble unless the discharging- surfaces 
are kept highly jjolished; gilt brass knobs act admirably if kept pol- 
ished np every ten minutes or so. One of the greatest desiderata in 
these experiments is some method of making sui'e that all the sparks 
should iiave the same character and be all good ones. 

III. 

In the foregoing, the ])rinciples ui)()ii which a rapidly vibrating elec- 
tric oscillator should be constructed have l)een considered, and how the 
sudden break-down of the air-gai) enabled these rapid vibrations to be 
started. It is probable that this break-down occurs in a time smaller 
than the thousand-millionth of a second. How very rajtid the inter- 
atonn'c motions nnist be! 

Consider now the princii)les on which an apparatus is to be con- 
structed to receive the vibrations pi-oduced by this oscillator. We may 
observe in the tirst place that as we are dealing with a succession of 
impulses at equal intervals of tinn^ w(^ (;an utilize resonance to accuuui- 
late the effect of a single impulse. Kesouance is used in an immense 



218 hertz's experiments. 

variety of circumstances to aecuiiiulate the effect of a series of im- 
pulses, aud is avoided in auotlier immense variety of circumstances 
to prevent accumulating the effect of a series of impulses. We see, 
we liear, we pliotogTaph by using it; we use it to make musical sounds, 
to keep clocks and watches going, to work telegraplis. By avoiding 
it carriages drive safely over rough roads, shi^is navigate the seas, 
the tides do not now overwhelm the hiiid, the earth and planets 
preserve their courses round the sun, aud the solar system is saved 
from destruction. Resonance maybe thus described: If a system is 
able to vibrate by itself in any way, and if we give it a series of im- 
pulses, each tending to increase the vibration, the effect will be cumu- 
lative, and the vibration will increase. To do this the im^iulses must 
be well timed, at intervals the same as the i^eriod of vibration of the 
system itself. Otherwise some of the impulses will tend to stop the 
the vibration, and only some to increase it, and on the whole the effect 
will be small. 

In order to use resonance in the construction of the detector of 
waves of electric force, we must make our detector so as to be capa- 
ble of an electric vibration of the same period as the generator of the 
waves. If we do this we may expect the currents i)roduced in it to 
be increased by each wave, and thus the electrification at its ends to 
increase, and so increase tlie chance of our being able to produce a 
visible spark. Tw^o ways of using a detecti)r have been mentioned. 
One is to observe the heating of a conductor by tlie current in it, 
and the other to observe a spark due to the electrification at the 
end of the conductor. The latter is the most sensitive and has 
been most frequently employed, aud is the nietliod first employed by 
Hertz. Two forms of detector may be used for observing sparks. One 
form consists of a single conductor bent into a circle with its two ex- 
tremities very close together. An electric charge can oscillate from 
one end of this to the other round the circle and back again. If the 
circle be the proper size, about 70^'" in diameter for the large-sized 
oscilhitor and about 8"" in diameter for the smaller-sized one de- 
scribed in the last article, the period of oscilhition of this cliarge will 
be the same as that of the charge on the generator of the waves, and 
its oscillation will be increased 'by resonance until, if the ends of the 
circular wire be close enough together, the opposite electrification of 
the ends will become great enough to cause a spark across the gap. 
The other form of detector depends on using two conductors, each of 
which has the same period of electric oscillation as the oscillations we 
wish to detect. These are placed in such a position that an end of one 
is near that end of the other which will at any time be oppositely electri- 
fied. For example, if the electric force in our waves be in vertical lines, 
then if we place two elongated conductors, one vertically above the 
other and separated by a very small air space, the electric force alter- 
nating up and down will cause currents to run up and down the con- 



hertz's kxperiments. 219 

diictors simuitaueously, and tlic ii]»i)er ends (jf both will be similarly 
electrified at any instant, wliilc the lower end of the n[)])er one will 
always be oppositely electritied to the upper end of the low conductor, 
and if these two points, or two short wires connected with them, be 
close enough together, a spark Avill pass from one to the other whenever 
the electric force sets up these electric oscillations in the conductor. 
Thus this apparatus is a detector of the electric force. Whenever there 
is a spark we may be sure that there is electric force, and whenever we 
can not get a spark we may be sure that there is either no electric force 
or at any rate too little to produce sparks. The apparatus will be more 
sensitive for electric forces that oscillate at the same rate as the natural 
vibration of the electric charge on the conductor, because the effect of 
each impulse will then add to that of the last; resonance will hel]) to 
make the electrifications great, and so there will be a better chance of 
our being able to produce a spark. 

We may weaken the strength of this air-gap by reducing the pressure 
of the au' in it. To do this the ends of the conductors, or wires con- 
nected witli them, must lead into an exhausted air vessel, such as a 
Geissler's tube. There is no donbt that much longer spaiks may thus 
be produced, but they are so dim and diifused that when dealing with 
very minute quantities of electricity those K})arks in a vacuum are not 
more easily seen than the smaller and intenscr s[)arks in air at atmos 
l)heric pressure. The additional complication and difficulty of manii)u- 
lation from having the terminals in a. vacuum are not compensated for 
by any advantages. This whole dete(;ting ap])aratus works on some- 
what the same i)rinciple as a resonator of definite size connected with 
one's ear when used to detect a feeble note of the same pitch as the 
resonator. Such a resonator might very well be used to find out where 
this note existed and where it did not. It wotdd detect where there 
were compressions and rarefactions of the air i)rodncing currents of air 
into and out of your ear. In the same way the conductor sparking tells 
where there are alternating electric forces making currents alternately 
up and down tlie conductor, and ultimately ele(;tri}ying the end enough 
to make it si)ark. In the sound resonator there is nothing exactly like 
this last phenomenon. We have much more delicate ways of detecting 
the currents of air than by making them break anything. If anybody 
would allow the electric currents from a Hertzian detector to be led di- 
rectly into the retina of his eye, it would probably be a very delicate 
way of observing, though even in this direct application of the cuirent 
to an organ of sense it is possible that these very rapidly altctnating 
currents miglit fail to produce any sensible effect, for they are not 
rapid enough to pi-oduce the ])hoto-chemical effects by which we see. 

To recapitulate the arrangements proposed in order to detect whether 
electric force is propagated with a finite velocity, and if possible to 
measure it if fiuite, it is proi)osed to create electric oscillations of very 
great rapidity, oscillating some four or five bunded million times per 



220 hertz's experiments. 

second, and it is expected thereby to produce ^\ aves of electric force 
whose length will be less than a meter if they are propagated with the 
velocity of light. It is proposed to do this by causing an electric charge 
to oscillate backwards and forwards between two conductors, and 
across an air gap between them. This oscillating (iharge is to be started 
by charging the conductors, one positively and the other negatively, 
until they discharge by a spark across this air gap. By making the 
conductors small, and the distance the charge has to go from one to 
the other small, the rate of oscillation of the charge can be made as 
great as we require. If waves are produced by this arrangemenj:, we 
can reflect them at the surface of a large conducting sheet, and then 
loops and nodes will be produced where the incident and reflected waves 
co-exist. The loops will be places where the alternating electric forces 
are great, while at the nodes there will be no electric forces at all. In 
order to detect wliere there are these alternating electric forces and 
where there are none, it is proposed to use either ai single wire bent 
nearly into a circle, with a very minute air-gap between its ends, or 
elvse two conductors x)laced end to end, with a minute air gap between 
their ends. In either case, if the natural period of vibration of a 
charge on the single conductor, or on each of the conductors in the 
second arrangement, is the same as the rate of alternation of the elec- 
tric force we wish to detect, there may be sufticieiit electrification of 
the neighboring ends to cause a spark across the minute air-gap. We 
are thus in jiosscssion of a complete apparatus for determining whether 
electric waves are produced, and what their wave length is. 

The experiment is conducted as follows: 

The two conductors which are to generate the waves are placed — say, 
one above the other, so that the electric charge will run up and down 
in a vertical line across the spark gap between them. They might be 
placed horizontally or in any other line, but for definiteness of descrip- 
tion it is well to suppose some definite position. We may call them A 
and B. They are terminated in polished knobs, between which the spark 
passes. A and B are connected with the termitials of a Euhmkortf 
coil, or a Wimshurstor other apparatus by which a succession of sparks 
may be conveniently made to pass from A to B. Before the spark 
passes, A and 7> are being electrified, and when the spark occurs the 
electricity on A rushes over to B, and part of it charges B, while the 
electricity on B rushes across the spark and i)artly charges A, this 
taking place alternately up and down. Each time there is less elec- 
tricity, for some is neutralized during each oscillation by the opposite 
charge; for energy is being spent, some in overcoming the resistance of 
tlie spark gap, *'. e., in producing the heat developed there, and some in 
])roduc{ng electric waves in the surrounding medium. Thus the elec- 
tric energy of the two oppositely charged bodies ^L and B is gradually 
dissipated, and one way of describing this is to say that the two oppo- 
site electric charges combine and neutralize one another. This whole

language of tiilkingof oloctiic cliargcs on Ixxlio.s, and clcctdc currents 
from one to the other, of ekM'trie eharges iieutraHzing one another, and 
so forth, is not in accorchmce witli the most recent developments of 
electro-magnetic theor.\. At the same time, those for whom these 
articles are written are familiar with this language and with the view 
of the subject that it is framed to suit, while they are unfamiliar with 
a'ther electrically and magnetically strained and thereby the seat of 
electric and magnetic energy, and conse<]uently it would have added 
very nuich to their difticulty in grasi)ing the details of a complicated 
(juestiou if it had been devSi^-ribed in unfamiliar terms and from an un- 
familiar point of view. 

The electric force in the neighborhood of the vertical generator will 
lie in vertical planes through it, and as A and B are alternately positive 
and negative, the electric force will alternately be from above down- 
Avards, and from below upwards. If then this foice is ])ropagated out- 
wards in a series of waves, we may expect that all round our generator 
waves of electric Ibrce will be diverging; \^aves in which the force will 
be alternately down and uj). The state of atfairs might be roughly 
illustrated l)y elastic strings stretched out in every direction from our 
generator. If their ends at the generator be moved alternately down 
and up, waves will be pro])agated along the strings, waves of alternate 
motion down and up. 

lu order to reflect these waves we require a metallic sheet of consid- 
erable area some two or three wavelengths away from the generator; 
so far away in order that we may Imve room for our detector to find 
the loops and nodes formed every half wave-length where the outgoing- 
waves meet those reflected from the screen; not too far away or (mr 
waves will be too feeble even at the loops to affect our detector. The 
waves are thrown off all round, but are most intense in the horizontal 
I)laue through the si)ark, so that our <letector had better be placed as 
near to this plane as possible. TIh' detector may be either a very 
nearly closed circle of wire or two condu<'tors, each somewhat longer 
and thinner than the combined lengths of the generating conductors, 
and placed vertically over one another, and separated by a minute air 
gap. As the theory of this latter form of detector is simi)ler than that 
of the circle, it will simplify matteis to consider it alone. The two con- 
ductors should each have a period of electrical oscillation u]) and down 
it, the same as that of the charges on the genei-ator. The generator 
consists of two conductors certainly, but then during the time the S[)ark. 
lasts they are virtually one conductor, being c(mnected by the spark 
across which the electric charges are rushing altei'nately up and <lown. 
Hence the period of oscillation of the charges on the generator corre- 
s])onds to that on a single conductor of the same size as its two ]>arts 
combined. 

Various experiments have been made as to the best form for these 
conductors that form the detector They might be made identical

■w^ith the generator, only that the sx^ark gap in the generator shonlcl 
be represented by a connecting wire. They may be longer and thin- 
ner. If longer, they should be thinner, or they will not have the 
same period of vibration. On the whole, the best results have been 
got with conductors somewhat longer and thinner than the generator. 
It is not generally convenient that the spark between the two conduc- 
tors that form the detector should take idace directly from one to the 
other. It is not easy to make arrangements by which the distance apart 
of these conductors can be regulated with sufficient accuracy. The most 
convenient way is to connect the lower end of the upper conductor and 
the upi^er end of the lower one each with a short thin wire leading, one 
to a fixed small knob and the other to a very fine screw impinging on 
the knob. The screw may then be used to adjust the spark gap be- 
tween it and the small knob Avith great accuracy. This spark gap 
must be very small indeed, if delicate work be desired. A thousandth 
of a centimeter would be a fair-sized spark gap. The minute sparks 
that are formed in these gai)S when doing delicate work are too faint 
to be seen, except in a darkened room. Having placed the detector in 
positiori between the generator and the screen, the difficult part of the 
observation begins. It is heart-rending work at first. A bright spark 
now and then arouses hope, and long periods of darkness crush it again. 
The knobs of the generator require re-polishing; the spark gap of the 
detector gets closed up: dust destroys all working, and not without 
much patience can the art be attained of making sure of getting sjtarks 
whenever the conditions are favorable, though it is easy enough not to 
get sparks when the conditions are unfavorable. 

Before making any measurements all this practice must be gone 
through. It is hard enough with the success of others before us to en- 
courage us, with their advice to lead us, with a clear knowledge of 
what is to be exi>ected to guide us. How much credit then is due to 
Hertz, v;ho groped his way to these wonderful experiments from step 
to step, without the success of others to encourage him, without the 
advice of others to lead him, without any certainty as to what was to 
be expected to guide him. Patiently, carefully, through many by- 
paths, with constant watchfulness, and checking every advance by re- 
peated and varied experiments. Hertz worked up to the grand sim- 
plicity of the fundamental experiment in electricity that is engaging 
our attention. 

Having gained conmiand over the apparatus we may look about for 
places where sparks occur easily and for others where they can not be 
produced. Two or three places may be found where no sparks can be 
observed. These places will be found to be nearly equi-distant. They 
are the nodes we are in search of. The distance between any pair is 
half the distance an electric wave is propagated during the period of 
an oscillation. Their presence proves that the electric force is not prop- 
agated instantaneously, but takes time to get from place to place. If

series of two or more such places between the iu'enerator and the re-

is propagated from place to i)lace, and does not oc<'ur siinultaneonsly 
everywhei'e. It sets the crowning stone (ui ^MaxwidTs theory that elec- 
tric force is due to a m.cdiuni. Witliont a medium tliere can be no 
])ropagation from })lace to place in time. It only lemainsto contirmby 
calculation that the rate of ])ropagation is th<' same ;(S that of light. 
This is a complicated matter. It involves the (piestion of how fast 
should, on any theory, the charge oscillate n}) a.nd down a conductor. 
The problem has only been accurately solved in a few six'cial cases, 
such as that of a sphere by itself. The conductors tliat have been 
em])loyed are not this shape, are not by themselves, and- so only rough. 
api)roximations are possible as to the rate at which these oscillations 
occur. Knowing the wave lengtli will not <leterniine the velocity of 
l)roi)agation unless we know the period of vibration : and consiMjuently 
this direct measure of the velocity has only been rouglily nnide; but 
it agrees as accurately as could be cxpecti'd with Maxwell's theory 
that it must be the same as the \-clocity of light if electri(;al i)henomena 
are due to the same medium as light. Tlie conviction tliat more accu- 
rate (h'terminations will conlirm this agreement is founded niton safe 
ground. 

It was i)oiiitc(l out tliat the a'ther that transmits light and is set in

itself. This a;tlier can hardly help lia\ing other properties than 
merely transmitting a compnrativ<'ly small range ol' vibrations. It can 
hardly hel]) inoducing other ])henomena. \\'hen it has been shown 
that, if there is a medium concerned in conv<'ying electric and mag- 
netic actions, it must possess proiierties which would enable it to 
transmit waves like light; and when it has been sliown that there is a 
medium concerned in con\eying electric and magnetic actions, and that 
the rate at which they are conveyed is approximately the same as the 
rate at which light is i»roi)agated; the conclusion is almost unavoid- 
able that we ai'c dealing with the same medium in both cases, and that 
futuri^ experiments, cai)able of accurate calculation and observation, 
will confirni the conclusion that electric* force is ])ropagated through, 
and by means of, the luminiferous a'ther with the velocity of light. 
We really know \ery little about the natuic of a wave of light, ^\'e 
know a great <leal more about electric and magnetic forces, and much 
may be tearnt as to the nature of a wave of light by studying it under 
the form of a wa\e of electric force. The waves ))roduced by the 
Hertzian generator may be a nu'ter long or more. The dithculty is to 
get them short enough. We know a good <leal about how they are 
prodiUH'd, and from this, and also by means of suitable detectors, we 



224 hertz's experiments. 

can study a great deal about their structure. They are truly very 
long waves of light. Atoms are Hertzian generators whose period 
of vibration is hundreds of millions of millions per second. A Hert- 
zian generator may vibrate rapidly, but it is miserably slow compared 
with atoms. And yet the wonder is that atoms vibrate so slowly. H* 
a Hertzian generator were, say, 1()~' *^^'" long, about the size of a good 
big atom, its period of vibration would be some hundreds of times too 
rapid to produce ordinary light. Atoms are j)robably com])licated 
Hertzian generators. By making a complicated shape, as, for exam- 
ple, a Leyden jar, a small object may have a slow period of vibraticm. 
All that is re<]uii'ed is that the capacity and self-induction may be 
large in comparison with the size of the conductor. We saw that these 
rapidly vibrating generators have but little energy in them; they rap- 
idly give out their energy to the aether near them. This is also the 
case with atoms. These, when free to radiate, give up their energy 
with wonderful rapidity. How short a time a flash of lightning lasts! 
It is hardly there but it is gone: the heated air molecules have so sud- 
denly radiated otf their energy. The reason ^xhy atoms in the air, for 
instance, do not radiate away their energy like this is because all their 
neighbors are sending them waves. Each molecule is a generator, but 
it is a detector as Avell. It is kept vibrating by its neighbors: it occu- 
pies a part of the a?ther that is in continual vibration, and so the atom 
itself vibrates. As each atom can radiate so rapidly, it must be a good 
detector; its own vibrations must be very much controlled by the 
neighborhood it finds itself in; and as the waves of light are very long- 
compared with the distances apart of molecules, those in any neigh- 
borhood are probably, independently of their motions to and fro, each 
vibrating in the same way. 

It is interesting to calculate how much of the energy in the air is in 
the form of vibrations of the {lether between the molecules of air. A 
rough calculation shows that in air at the ordinary density and tem- 
perature only a minute fraction of the total energy in a cubic centi- 
meter is in the ;ether; but when we deal with high temperatures, such 
as exist in lightning flashes, and near the sun, and with very small den- 
sities, there may be more energy in the aether than in the matter within 
each cubic centimeter. All this shows how wide-reaching are the re- 
sults of Hertz's experiments. They teach us the nature of waves of 
light. We can learn much by considering how the waves are generated. 
Let us consider what goes on near the generator, consisting of two con- 
ductors, A and B, sparking into one another. Before each spark, and 
Avhile A and B are being comparatively slowly what is called charged 
with electricity, the ;ether around and between them is being strained. 
The lines of strain are the familiar tubes of electric force. If A be 
positive, these tubes diverge from all points of A, and most from the 
knob between it and /i, and converge on 7^. Where they are narrow. 



hertz's experiments. 225 

tliea'ther is inucli stiniiu'd; w hoic wide, the a-ther is l)ut little stiaiii('<l. 
Each tube must be looked upon as a tube of unit strain. 

The nature of the strain of the a'ther is uot known; it is, most i)iob- 
ably, some increased motion in a perfect Ii<]uid. \Vc n)ust not be 
snri)rise<l at the nature «f the strain being" unknown. We do uot 
know the nature of the change in a piece of India, rubber when it 
is strained, nor indeed in any solid, and though the a^tlier is mucli 
sim])ler in structure than india rubber, it can hardly be wondered 
at that we have not yet discovered its structure, for it is only within 
the present century that the existence of the aether was demonstrated, 
while men have known solids and studied their proi)erties and struc- 
tiue for thousands of years. Any way, there is no doubt that the 
a'ther is strained in these tubes of force when ^l and /> are oppositely 
charged, and that the energy per cubic centimeter of unstrained icther 
is less than that of strained aether, and that the work done in what is 
called charging A and B is really done in straining the a'ther all rcmnd 
them. When the air-ga]) breaks down, and an eh'ctric si)ark takes 
its place, there is (piite a new series of phenomena produced. Sud- 
denly, the strained a'ther relieves itself, and in doing so, sets up new 
motions in itself. The strained state was probably a peculiar state of 
motion, and in changing back to ordinary .Bther a new and quite dis 
tinct state of motion is set uj). This new state of motion all round tlie 
(•(mdnctors is most intense near the spark, and is usually described as 
an electric current in the conductors and across the spark, or as a rush- 
ing of the electric charge from one conductor to the other. The elec- 
tric current is accompanied by magnetic force in circles round it, and 
the tubes of magnetic force detine the nature of the new movement in 
the a'ther as far as we know it. 

Hitherto, for the sake of simplicity, the existence of this magnetic 
force has been unnoticed. It is due to a i)eculiar motion in the a'ther 
all ronnd what aie called electric currents. The currtuit in fact con- 
sists of little else than a line, all round which this moxement is going 
on; like the movement surrounding an electrified body, but also un- 
like it. Whenever electric forces are changing, or electrified bodies 
moving, or electric currents running, there this other peculiai- mo- 
tion exists. We have every reason for thinking that this, whicli may 
be called the magnetic strain in the a'ther, as the nio\M'ment all lound 
electrified bodies was callcMl the electric strain — that this magnetic 
strain only exists in these three cases: (1) When the electric strain is 
changing; (li) when electrified bodies are moving, and {'.j) when electric 
currents are running. Thes(^ three may be all cases of one action; 
certainly the magnetic strain that accompanies each is the same, and 
it seems most likely that the electric change is only another as])ect 
of the magnetic- strain. There are analogies to this in the motion of 
matter that partly helj) and i)artly annoy, because tlie\ partly agree 
and i)aitly will not agree- Avith the a'thcrial phenomena. Take the case

described in a tonner aiticle of a chain transmitting' waves. Atten- 
tion was drawn to the displacement of a link and to its rotation. Now 
for the analogy: To seem at all satisfactory the first thing that wonld 
strike one would be to pay attention to two motions, to the velocity of 
displacement of the link and to its rotation. This wonld lead to inter- 
minable difticulties in carrying out the analogy. We can not liken 
electric strain to a velocity in this direct and simple way, because what 
are we to do with a change in the strain which produces the same ef- 
fects as a continuous current? A change in the strain is all very well, 
it would be like a change in the velocity, but what about a continuous 
change in the velocity : We can hardly sui)pose a velocity continually 
increasing forever; we are evidently landed in immediate difficulties. 
It is better therefore to be content to liken the electric strain to a dis- 
placement of the chain link. It seems most likely that it really is a 
peculiar motion in the ;ether, but we nnist be content for the present 
with the analogy. If we want to drive it further, we must suppose 
stress in the chain that draws the link back to be due to a motion in 
the chain or of things fastened to it, and then the changed motions 
produced by a displacement of the chain might be analogous to the . 
peculiar motions accompanying electric strain. It would lead us too 
far to work out this analogy. 

Returning to the simpler case of the diidsacement of the link 
representing electric strain, and the velocity of its rotation representing 
magnetic strain, see how the actions near a Hertzian generator may 
be likened to what takes place when a wave is being sent along a 
chain. While the conductors are being slowly cliarged we nnist sup- 
pose electric strain to be produced in all the surrounding space. This 
is a comparatively slow action, and as the rate of propagation is 
very rapid, the electric strain will rise practically simultaneously 
in the whole neighborhood, and that it does so is a most important 
fact to be taken account of in all our deductions from these experi- 
ments. This slow charging must be rei)resented by a slow raising 
of one end of the chain, which raises the rest of it to a great distance 
apparently sinniltaneously if the raising be done slowly. Suddenly 
the air-gap breaks. This might be represented by lifting the chain 
with a weak thread, and by having the end of the chain fastened 
to a pretty sti'ong spring. When the thread broke the sjn-ing would 
pull the chain back (piickly, would pass its position of equilibrium, and 
thus commence a series of rapid vibrations on each side of this posi- 
tion; the vibrations would gradually die away owing to the energy of 
the spring being gradually spent, i)artly on friction in itself, and partly 
in sending waves along the chain. In actually performing the experi- 
ment, an india-rubber tube or limp thin roi)e is better than a chain 
when hung horizontally, as the chain is so heavy; when it can be hung 
vertically, a chain does very well. In the description it simplifies 
matters to describe a chain, because it is easier to talk of a link than of 



hertz's experiments. 227 

a bit of the rope; a link lias an individuality that identities it, while a 
Int of tltei'o])e is so indefinite that it is not so easy to keep in mind any 
])aiti<'ular bit. 

Consider now what these waves are. what sort of motion oriiiinates 
them. When the spiinj^ first starts, the near ]»aits of the chain 
mo\es first. What happens to any link? One end of it moves down 
before the other. What sort of motion then has the link? It must 
be rotatinji'. Thus it is that chanye in the disphicement is j>enerally 
accompanied by rotation of the links. Thus it is that change in 
the electric strain is accompanied by nuignetic strain. The analogy 
goes farther than this. Ea(;h wave thrown oft' may be described as a 
wave of displaced — or as a wave of rotating — links, and the most dis- 
placed are at any time the most rapidly rotating links. Just m the 
same way, what have hitherto been called waves of electric force may 
also be looked upon as waves of magnetic force. Because there are two 
as])ects in which the motion of the chain may be viewed does not 
diminish from the essential unity of character of the wave motion in its 
waves; and similarly the fact that these Hertzian waves have an elec- 
tric and a magnetic as])ect does not diminish from the essential unity 
of character of the wave motion in them. At the same time the two 
elements, the displacement of a link and the rotation of a liidv, are 
(juite distinct things; either might exist without the other; it is only 
in wave propagation that they essentially co-exist. In the same way 
electric strain and magnetic strain are quite different things; thongh 
in wave motion, and indeed whenever energy is transmitted from one 
place to another by means of the icther, they essentially co-exist. 



ox THE DISOHARCtE OF ELECTRICITY TIIROT^OII EX- 
HAUSTED TUBES WITHOUT ELUCTRODES.* 



Bv J. J. Thomson, F. R. S. 



The following experiments, of which a short account was read before 
tlie Cambridge Philosophical Society last February, were originally 
undertaken to investigate the phenomena attending the discharge of 
electricity through gases when the conditions are sinii)litied by confin- 
ing the discharge throughout the whole of its course to the gas, instead 
of, as in ordinary discharge-tubes, making it pass from metiillic or glass 
electrodes into the gas, and then out again from the gas into the elec- 
trodes. 

In order to get a closed discharge of this kind we must produce a 
finite electromotive force round a closed circuit, and since we can not 
do this by the forces arising from a distribution of electricity at rest, 
we must make use of the electromotive forces produced by induction. 
To break down the electric strength of the gas such forces must be very 
intense while they last, though they need not last for more than a short 
time. Forces satisfying these conditions occur in the neighborhood of 
a wire througli which a Leyden Jar is discharged. During the short 
time during which the oscillations of the Jar are maintained enormous 
currents ])ass through the wire, and as with a moderate-sized Jar these 
currents change their direction millions of times in a second, the elec- 
tromotive force in the neighborhood of the wire is exceedingly large. 
To make these forces available for producing an electrodeless discharge, 
all we have to do is to make the wire conn(;cting the coatings of the Jar 
the jtrimary of an induction-coil of which the discharge-tube itsdf forms 
the secondary. The arrangements which I have employed for this pur- 
])ose are represented in the accomi)anying diagram. 

In {a) A is the inside coating of a L('yd<Mi jar: this is connected to 
E, one of the poles of a Wimshnrst electrical nmcliine, or an induc- 
tion-coil, the other pole F of the machine being connected to B, the outer 
coating of the Jar. A C D is a wii-e connected to the inner coating of 
the Jar, a few turns C (which we shall call the primary coil) are made in 
this wire; these turns are scpiare if the discharge-tube is sqnare, ciicu- 
lar if the discharge-tube is a spherical bull). The wire at I) is attached 
to an air-break, the other side of which is connected with the outer

coating of the Leyden jar. The knobs of this air-break ought to be 
kept brightly polished. The loop C is connected to eartli. The dis- 
charge-tubes, which were in general either rectangular tubes or spher- 
ical bulbs, where placed close to the turns of C. When the difference of 
potential between A and B is sufficiently large, a spark i)asses across 
the air-break, and the electrical oscillations set up produce a large 
electromotive force in the neighborhood of the coil, sufficient under 
t^ivorable circumstances to cause a bright discharge to pass through the 
vacuum-tubes. In some experiments tlie jars, at the suggestion of 
Prof. Oliver Lodge, were connected up differently, and are represented 




(WimJiurst)

by (/i) in Fig. 1. Two jars were used, the outside coatings of which, A 
and B, Avere connected by the wire containing the primary coil C, the 
inside coating of the hrst jar was connected to one pole of the Wims- 
hurst, that of tlie second to the other. With this method of arranging 
the jars no air-s])ace is required, as the sparks pass between the ter- 
minals of the machine, and the ]>olishing of these terminals is not nearly 
so important as tliat of the knobs of the air-break in the arrange- 
ment («). 

Before proceeding to describe the appearance prescmted by the dis- 
charge, I will mention one or two imints which may i)r(>ve useful to any 
one who wishes to rei)eat the experiments. According to my experi- 
ence the discliarge is more easily obtained in bulbs than in square tubes, 
and with a Wimshurst machine than with an inductic^n coil. If an in- 
duction-coil is used a break which will transmit a large current ought 
to be substituted for tlie ordinary vibrating one supplied with such in- 
struments. It is essential to sncci'ss that the gas in the bulbs or tubes 
shoidd be quite dry and at a suitable ])ressnre; there is a pressure at 
which the brilliancy of the discharge is a maxinuim, and as in endeav- 
oring to get at this piessure the exhaustion may be carried too far, it 
is convenient to use a form of mercury pumy which will allow of the 
easy admission of a little gas; the pattern which I have used and found 



DISCHARGE OK KLKCTRK ri'Y. 281 

to answer very well is called the Lane-Fox pattern. When any ^as is 
introdnced it should be sent throu.iih sulphurie acid to .^ct rid of any 
moisture that may be in it. Owing', I tliink, to the pressure in ordin- 
ary in('an<lesct'nt lamps being- very dittcrent from that at which the 
discharge has its maximum ])rdliancy, 1 have nu't w itii \('r.\ i)oor suc- 
cess in attemi)ts to i)roduce these discharges in already exhausted 
tubes such as incandescent lamps, though 1 have tried a considerable 
number by different makers; on the other hand, the radiometers w-hich 
I have tried allow the discharge to pass pretty readily, though it is in- 
terfered with by the vanes, and is not comparable in brilliancy with 
that obtained in home-nuide tubes and bulbs. I liave obtained s])arks 
easily with apparatus of the following dimensions: Iwo gallon Jars, the 
outside coatings connected by a wire about 2 yards long, the coil con- 
sisting of three or four turns, each about 3 inclies in diameter. I have 
some bulbs which with this apparatus will give a bright discharge when 
the distance between the terminals of the Wimshuist is only j inch; 
these are, however, excei)tioiuUly g(»od ; it more fre(|uently takes a spark 
an inch or an inch and a half long t(» [)roduce the discharge. 

I find that Ilittori; in Wiedenmnn's Annalen, xxi, p. 138, describes 
the light produced in a tube round which the wire connecting the coat- 
ings of a Leyden jar is twisted; the luminosity in Hittorf's experiments 
seems to have filled the tube, and not, as in the experiments described 
in this paper, been confined to a ring. It seems possible that the dif- 
ference in the apjiearance in the tubes may have been due to the exist- 
ence of an electrostatic action in Hittorf's experiments, the prinuiry 
coil getting- raised to a high potential before the discharge of the jar, 
an<l inducing a distribution of electricity over the inside of the glass 
of the tube; on. the passage of the s])ark the potential of the primary 
coil will tall, and the electricity on the glass re-distribute itself; to effect 
this re-distribution itnuiy pass through the rarified gas in the discharge 
tube and produce luminosity. 

In my experiments 1 took two precautions against this effect. In 
the fii'st jdact^ I connected the ])riijKiry coil to earth, so that its i>oten- 
tial befoie dischaige took place was unaltered, ami as an additional 
precaution I sei)arated the discharge tube from the primary by a cage 
made of blotting paper moistened with dilute acid; the wet blotting 
])a])er is a sufiiciently good c(mductor to screen off any i)urely electro- 
static eifccts, but not a good enough one to intertere to an ai)preciable 
extent with the eh'ctro-motive forces arising from ra])idly alternating 
currents. In this way we can screen off any electrostatic effects due to 
causes which operate before the electrical oscillations in the jars begin. 
When once these have commenced, there ought not, I think, to beany 
separation of the electro-motive forceps into tw^o parts, one being calh'<l 
ele<'tro static, the other (dectro-dyiumiic. As this is a])oint on which it 
is desirabh? to avoid an> misunderstandiug, I hope to be excused if I 
treat it at sonu' lengtli. 



232 DISCHARGE OP ELECTRICITY. 

Ill the matliematk-al treatment of the pheiioiueua of the "Electro- 
magnetic Field," it is customary and not inconvenient to regard the 
electro-motive force as derived from two sources, or rather as consisting 
of two parts, one i^art being calculated by the ordinary rules of electro- 
statics from the distribution of electricity in the field, the other part 
being the difterential coefficient of the vector potential with respect to 
the time. From a mathematical point of view, there is a good deal to 
be said for this division; the two forces have very distinct and sharply 
contrasted analytical properties. Thus the electrostatic force possesses 
the property that its line integral taken round any closed curve van- 
ishes, while the surface integral of its normal component taken over a 
closed surface does not in general vanish. The "vector potential 
force," on the other hand, does not in general vanish when integrated 
round a closed curve; the surface integral of its normal component 
taken over any closed surface however vanishes. When however 
our object is not so much mathematical calculation as the formation of 
a mental picture of the processes going on in the field, this division 
does not seem nearly so satisfactory, as the fundamental quantities 
concerned, the electrostatic and vector potentials, are both of con- 
siderable complexity from a physical i3oint of view. We might judge 
that this division of the electro-motive force into two parts, the one de- 
rivable from an electrostatic, the other from a vector, potential, is rather 
a mathematical device than a physical reality, from the fact which I 
pointed out in a report on electrical theories [B. A. Report^ 1886), that 
though the electrostatic jiotential satisfies the mathematical condition 
of being propagated with an infinite velocity, the total electro-motive 
force in the electro-magnetic field travels with the.velocity of light, and 
nothing physical is jiropagated at a greater velocity. 

In an experimental investigation such as that described in this paper, 
it is not so important that our method of regarding the phenomena 
should lead to the shortest analysis as that it should enable us to pic- 
ture to ourselves the processes at work in the field, and to decide 
without much calculation how to arrange the experiments so as to bring 
any effect which may have been observed into greater prominence. 

The method which I have adoj^ted for this purpose is the one de- 
scribed by me in the Philosophical Magazine, March, 1891, and which 
consists in referring everything to the disposition and motion of the 
tubes of electrostatic induction in the field. These tubes are either 
endless, or have their ends on places where free electricity exists, every 
unit of positive electricity (the unit being the quantity of electricity on 
the atom of a univalent element) being connected by a unit tube to a 
unit of negative electricity, the tube starting from the positive elec- 
tricity and ending on the negative. At any point in the field the elec- 
tro-motive intensity varies as the density of the tubes of electrostatic 
induction at that point. When the electricity and the tubes in the 
field are at rest, the tubes distribute themselves so that the electro-motive 



DISCHARGE OF ELECTRICITY. 233 

iuteusity at iiuy point is derivable from a potential function ; as soon, 
however, as the equilibrium is disturbed, the tubes move about and get 
displaced from their original positions, the disposition of tubes and 
therefore the electro-motive intensity are changed, and the latter will 
no longer be derivable from a i)otential function, and according to the 
mat] lematicaltheory would be said to include forces diie to electrostatic 
and electro-magnetic induction. According to our view, however, the 
cause of the electro-motive intensity is tlie same in both cases, viz, the 
j)resence of tubes of electrostatic induction, and the electro-motive in- 
tensity ceases to be derived from a potential, merely because the dis- 
tribution of these tubes is not necessarily the same when they are 
moving about as when they are in equilibrium. It is shown, in the 
])a])er already referred to, that these tubes when in motion produce a 
magnetic force at right angles, both to their own direction and to that 
in which they are moving, the magnitude of the force being 47r times 
the product of the strength of the tube, the velocity with A\hich it is 
moving, and the sine of the angle between the direction of the tube and 
its direction of motion. In an electric tield in which the matter is at 
rest, these tubes when in motion move at right angles to themselves 
with the velocity '' r," that at which electro-dynamic disturbances are 
propagated through the medium. We can easily show that, K being 
the specific inductive capacity of the medium, the line integral of 
47r K times the density of these tubes taken round a closed circuit is 
equal to the rate of diminution of the luimber of lines of magnetic in- 
duction passing through the circuit. Thus, since the fundamental 
laws of electro-dynamic action, viz, Faraday's law of iiuluctiou and 
Am])cre's law of magnetic force, follow from this conception of the field 
as i)roduced by tubes of electrostatic induction moving at right angles 
to themselves with the velocity " v," and producing a magnetic force at 
riglit angles both to their own direction and to that in which they are 
moving, and proportional to the product of the strength of the tube 
and its velocity, it is a coiicei>tiou which will account for all the known 
phenomena of the field. It furnishes, in tine, a geometrical instead of 
an analytical theory of the field, it will also be seen that from this 
point of view the magnetic force, when introduced to calculate the 
electio-motive forces arising from in<lu('1ion, logicall\' comes in as an 
intellectual middle-man wasting mental effort. 

We may thus regard the distinction between electrostatic and elec- 
tro-magnetic* electro-motive forces as. one introduced for convenience of 
analysis rather than as having any physical reality. The only differ- 
ence which I think could from made from a i)hysical point of view would 
be to <lefine those effects as electrostatic which are due to tubes of elec- 
trostatic induction having free ends, and to confine the term electro- 
magnetic to the effects produced by closed endless tubes. It is only 
however when the electro-motive forces are produced exclusively by the 
motion of magnets that all the tubes are closed; whenever batteries or 
comlensers are used, open tubes are ])resent in the field.

DISCHARGE OF ELECTRICITY. 



It will be useful to consider here the dispositiou aud motion of the 
tubes of electrostatic induction in the arrangement used to produce 
these electrodeless discharges. We shall take the case where two jars 
are used, as in fS, Fig. 1, as being the more symmetrical. 

Just before the discharge of the Jar, the tubes of electrostatic induc- 
tion will be arranged somewhat as follows : There will be some tubes 
stretching from one terminal of the electric machine to the other; others 
will go frcmi the terminals to the neigliboring conductors, the table on 
which the machine is placed, the floor and walls of the room, etc. The 
great majority of the tubes will, however, be short tubes passing through 
the glass between the coatings of the jars. Let us now consider the 
behavior of two of these tubes, one from the jar A, the other from B, 
when a spark passes between the terminals of the machine. Whilst the 
spark is passing these may be regarded as connected by a conductor; 
the tubes which originally stretched between them now contract, the 
repulsion they exerted on the surrounding tubes is destroyed so that 
these now crowd into the space between the terminals, the two short 
tubes under consideration now taking somewhat the form shown in Fig. 
2. These tubes, being of opposite sign, tend to run together; they do 







so until they meet as in Fig. 3, when the tubes break up as in Fig. 4.^ the 
upper portion running into the spark gap, where it contracts, while 
the lower portion rushes through the dielectric to discharge itself into 
the wire connecting the coatings of the jars, an intermediate position 
being shown in Fig. 5. These tubes while rushing through the dielec- 
tric produce, as already stated, magnetic forces; some of them on their 
way to the discharging wire will pass through the discharge tube; if 
they congregate there in sntflcicnt density, discharge will take place 
through the rarefied gas, , 

The discharge of the jar is oscillatory, and we have only followed the 



DlsrHAIUil-: OF ELKCTRICITV. 235 

motion of the tubes (luviiij^ u |);iii of the osciUatioii; when, however, 
this tube euterib the wire between the Jars a tube of oi)i)osite kind 
emerges from it; the same thing happens when theother portion enters 
the spark gap. These go through the same processes as the tubes we 
have foHowed, but in tlu' reverse order, until we get again two short 
tubes in the jars, but opposite in sign to the original ones; the process 
is then repeated, and so ou as long as the vibrations last. 

In order to see what are the most adsautageous dimensions to 
give to our apparatus, let us consider on what the maximum electro- 
motive force in the secondary depends. Let us take the case of a con- 
denser of capacity C discharging thiough a- circuit whose coefiticieut of 
self-induction is L; then, if the potential difference between the plates 
of the condenser is initially Vn, the current ;/ at the time / is (suppos- 
ing as a very rough approximation that there is no decay in the vibra- 
tions) given by the equation 

CVo . t 

The rate of variation of this, y, is therefore 

Vo t 

So that if iNI is the coefficient of self-induction between the primary 
and a secondary circuit, the maximum electro-motive force around the 
secondary is MV,, /L, Avhich for a given spark-length is independent of 
the capacity of the condenser. In practice it is advisable, iiowever, to 
liav^e as nuu'h energy in tlie jars to start with as possible, and better 
results are got with large jars than with small ones. Using a six-plate 
Wimshurst maciiine 1 got very good results with two " gallon jars; " 
with a large induction coil the best results Avere got with two " pint- 
and-a-halt jars,'' 

The best number ol' turns to use in the primary coil (J depends ui)on 
the size of the leads; if all the circuit were available for this coil one 
luin would give the laigest electro-motive tbrce, because, though lor a 
given rate of change of the current in the primary the <'ffect on the sec- 
ondary increases with the number of turns, the rate of change of the 
current varies inversely as the self-indu(;tion of the i>rinuiry, so that if 
all the circuit is in the coil (J, since an increase in the number of turns 
will increase the vself-induetion of the circuit faster than the mutual in- 
duction, it will diminisli the eh'ctn)-motiv<' force round the secondary, 
in practice however it is not possible to have the whole of the wire 
connecting the coatings of the jar in the coil C; and in this case an in- 
crease in the number of tuiiis may increase tlie nmtual induction more 
than the self-induction, and so be advantageous. Tlie best result will 
be obtained when the self-induction in the coil C is e((nal to that of 
the remainder of the circuit. It is very easy to find by actual trial 



236 DISCHARGE OF ELECTRICITY. 

whether the additiou of au extra tuiii of wire is beneficial or the re- 
verse. The brightness of the discharge depends upon the time of the 
electrical oscillations as well as upon the niagnitudt of the electro-mo- 
tive force. Thus, in an experiment to be described later, the brilliancy 
of the discharge was increased by putting self-induction in the leads, 
which, though it diminished the intensity of the electromotive force, 
increased the time constant of the system. When the discharge tube 
was square and the coil C had also to be square it was found most 
convenient to make it of glass tubing bent into the required form and 
filled with mercury. When however the discharge was required in a 
bulb, the primary coil was made of thick gutta-percha-covered copper 
wire wound round a beaker Just large enough to receive the exhausted 
bulb. There is sometimes coasiderable difficulty in getting the first 
discharge to pass through the bulb, though when it has once been 
started other discharges follow with much less difficulty. The same 
effect occurs with ordinary sparks. It seems to be due to the splitting 
up of the molecules by the first discharge; some of the atoms are left 
uncombined, and so ready to conduct the discharge, or else when they 
re-combine they form compounds of smaller electric strength than the 
original gas. AVhen the discharge was loath to start, I found the most 
effectual way of inducing it to do so was to pull the terminals of the 
Wimshurst far apart and then, after the jars had got fully charged, to 
push the terminals suddenly together. In this way a long spark is 
obtained, which, if the pressure of the gas is such that any discharge 
is possible, with the means at our disposal will generally start the dis- 
charge. 

Appearance of the discharge. — Let us suppose that we have either a 
square tube placed outside a square primary or a l>ulb placed inside a 
circular coil of wire, and that we gradually exhaust the discharge tube, 
the jars sjiarking all the time. At first nothing at all is to be seen in 
the secondary, but when the exhaustion has proceeded until the pres- 
sure has fallen to a millimeter or thereabouts, a thin thread of reddish 
light is seen to go round the tube situated near to but not touching the 
side of the tube turned towards the jyrimary. As the exhaustion i)ro- 
ceeds still further, the brightness of this thread rapidly increases, as 
well as its thickness; it also changes its color, losing its red tinge and 
becoming white. On continuing the exhaustion the luminosity attains 
a maximum, and the discharge passes as an exceedingly bright and 
well-defined ring. On continuing the exhaustion, the luminosity begins 
to diminish until, when an exceedingly good vacuum is reached, no dis- 
charge at all passes. The pressure at which the luminosity is a maxi- 
mum is very much less than that at which the electric strength of the 
gas is a minimum in a tube provided with electrodes and comparable 
in size to the bulb. The i^ressure at which the discharge stops is ex- 
ceedingly low, and it requires long-continued pumping to reach this 
stage. We see from these results that the difficulty which is experi- 



DISCHARGE OF ELECTRICITY. 237 

enced in getting the discbage to pass tbroiigii an ordinary vacnuni-tnbe 
wbei) tbe pressure is very low is not altogetber due to tbe difficulty of 
getting" tbe electricity from tbe electrodes into tbe gas, but tbat it also 
occurs in tubes witbout electrodes, tbougii in tbis case the critical 
pressure is very nni(;b lower tban wben tbere are electrodes. In otber 
words, we see tbat as tbe state of tbe bulb sipproacbes tbat of a per- 
fect vacuum its iiisulatiug power becomes stronger and stronger. Tbis 
result is continued by several otber experiments of a different kind, 
which will be described later. 

Tbe discbarge presents a perfectly continu<ms appearance, with no 
sign of striation, of wbicb I have never observed any trace on any of 
these discharges, though I must have observed many thousands of 
them under widely different conditions. 

Action of a ma<j)iet on the discharfic — Tbe discharges wbicb take 
place in these tubes and bulbs are produced by })eriodic currents, so 
tbat the discharges themselves are periodic, and the luminosity is pro- 
duced by currents j^assiug in opposite directi<ms. As tbis is the case, 
it seemed possible that the uniformity of the luminosity seen in the 
discharge was due to tbe super-position of two stratified discharges in 
opposite directions, the places of maximum luminosity in the one 
fitting into those of minimum luminosity in the other. Since these 
discharges are in opposite directions, they will be pushed opposite 
ways wben a magnetic force acts at right angles to them, the dis- 
cbarges in opposite directions can thus be separated by the application 
of a magnetic force and examined separately. In tbe experiment wbicb 
was tried with this object, a scpiare tube was used placed outside the 
primary, the tube at one or two places being blown out into a bulb so 
as to allow of tbe wider separation of the constituent <liscbarges. 
Wben one of these bulbs was i)lace(l in a magnetic field where tbe 
force was at right angles to tbe discharge, the luminous discbarge 
tlirougb the bulb was divided into two portions wliicli were dri\en to 
oi)posite sides of the bulb; each of these portions was of uniform lumi- 
nosity and exhibited no trace of striation. It was noticed, howevei", in 
making this experiment that tbe discharge seemed to have much greater 
(lifiiculty in ])assing through tbe tube when the electromagnet was on 
tban wben it was oft. Tbis observation was followed up by several 
other experiments, and it was found thai tbe discbarge is r(>tarded in 
a nu)st remarkable way by a magnetic force acting at right angles to 
the line of discharge. Tbis effect is most strikingly shown when the 
discbarge passes as a ring through a s])herical bulb. If such a bulb 
is placed near a strong electro-magnet, it is easy to adjust tin' length of 
spark so tbat when tbe magnet is oft' a brilliant discbarge passes 
through the bulb, while when tbe magnet is on no discharge at all can 
be detected. The action is very striking, and the explanaticui of it 
wliicb seems to fit in best with tbe jdienomena 1 have observed, is that 
the discbarge through tbe rarefied gas does not rise to its full intensity 



260 DISCHARGE OF P:LECTRICITY. 

suddenly, but as it were feels its way. The gas tirst breaks down 
along' the line where the eleetro -motive intensity is a niaximuiu, and a 
small discharge takes place along this line. This discharge produces 
a su])ply of dissociated molecules along which subsequent discharges 
can pass with greater ease. Thus under tlie action of these electric 
forces the gas is in a state of unstable equilibrium, since as soon as 
any small discharge passes through it the gas becomes electrically 
weaker and less able to resist sul)sequent discharges. When the gas 
is in a magnetic held, the magnetic force acting on the discharge pro- 
duces a mechanical force which displaces the molecules taking part in 
the discharge from the line of maximum electric intensity, and thus 
subsequent discharges do not find it any easier to pass along this line 
in consequence of the passage of the previous one. There will not 
therefore be the same instability in this case as in the one where no 
magnetic force acted upon the gas. A confirmation of this view is, I 
think, afforded by the appearance presented by the discharge when 
the intensity of the magnetic held is reduced, so that the discharge 
Just — but only jnst- — passes when the magnetic held is on. In this case 
the discharge, instead of passing as a steady fixed ring, flickers about 
the tube in a very undecided way. 

If the strength of the magnetic held is reduced still further, so that 
the discharge passes with some ease, the bright ring which, when no 
magnetic force is acting, is in one i)lane, is changed into a luminous 
baud situated between two planes which intersect along a diameter ot 
the bulb at right angles to the magnetic force. These planes are in- 
clined at a considerable angle, one being above and the other below 
the plane of the undisturbed ring. This displacement of the ring by 
the magnetic force shows tliat it consists of currents circulating tan- 
gentially round the ring. 

This action of a magnet on a discharge flowing at right angles to its 
lines of force is not, however, the only remarkable effect produced by a 
magnet on the discharge. Wlien the lines of magnetic force are along 
the line of discharge, the action of the magnet is to facilitate the dis- 
charge and not to retard it as in the former case. The first indication 
Of this was ol)served when the jars were connected, as in {a) Fig. 1. 
The earth connection being removed, in this case there is a glow from 
the glass into the bulb, due to the re-distribution of the electricity 
induced on the glass by the primary when it is at a high potential 
before the s})ark passes. If the ])rimary is connected to earth by a 
circuit with an air break in it, the intensity of the glow may be altered 
at will by adjusting the length of the air break; when the air-space is 
very small tliere is no glow; when it is long the glow is bright. The 
bulb in which the discharge Avas to take place was placed on a piece of 
ebonite over the i)ole of an electromagnet, and the air-space in the 
earth connection of the primary was adjusted so that when the magnet 
was ort' no glow was observed in the tube. When the nuiguet was on, 



however, a glow radiating' in the direction of tlie lines of magnetic, 
force was produced, which lasted as long as the magnet was on, and 
died away rapidly, but not instantaneously, when the magnet was 
taken oft". In this case the discharge seems to be nuicli easier along 
the lines of magnetic force. 

The following experiment shows that this <'ftect is not (routined to 
the glow discharge, but is also o[»crative when the discharge passes 
entirely through the gas, A scpiare tube ABCD (Fig. <») is placed out- 
side the luinuiry EFdII, the lower part of the discharge tube CD being 
situated between the ])oles L M of an electro-magnet. l>y altering the 
length of spark of the Winishurst macliine, the electro-motive intensity 




Fig. 6. 

acting on flic secondary can be so adjusted that no <}ischarge i^asses 
round the tube ABCD when the magnet is off", whilst a blight dis- 
charge occurs as long as the magnet is on. The two effects of the 
magnet on the discharge, viz, tlu^ stopi>age of the discharge across the 
lines of magnetic force, and its acceleration along them, maybe prettily 
illustrated b.\' i)lacing in this exjteriment an exhausted bulb X inside 
the i)rimary; then the spark length can be adjusted so that when the 
magnet is off the discharge passes in the bulb, and not in the scpiare 
tube, while when the magnet is on the discharge passes in the S(piare 
tube, and not in the bulb. 

The experiments on the effect of the magnetic lield on the discharge 
were tried with air, carbonic acid, and oxygen, but 1 could not detect 
any differen<;e in the behavioi of the gas«^s. 

The explanation of the longitudinal effect of magnetic force seems 
more ol)scure than that of the transverse effect: it is ])ossible how- 
ever that l)otli may be due to the sanu^. cause, for if the feeble dis- 
charge which we suppose precedes the main discharg(^ branches away 
at all from the line ol" main discharge, the action of the magnetic force 
when it is al(»ng the discliarge will tend to bring these branches into 
the main line of discharge; and tlius there will be a greater sujjply of 
dissociated molecules along tlie main line of discharge, and therefore 
an easier i)ath for the sidjsecpient disclnnges when the magnetic force 
is acting than \y\nm it is absent, 

It is perhaps not necessary to assume tiiat the mechanical acticui of 



240 DISCHARGE OF ELECTRICITY. 

the magnetic force is on a small discbarge preceding the main one; 
the action of the magnetic force on the chain of polarized molecules 
which are formed before the discharge passes might produce an effect 
equivalent to that which we have supposed was produced on an actual 
discharge. 

The chain of polarized molecules would be affected in the following 
way: The magnetic held due to the electro-Diagnet consists of tubes of 
electrostatic induction moving about these tubes, as well as the direc- 
tion in which they are moving, are at right angles to the lines of mag- 
netic force. The short tubes of electrostatic induction wliich join the 
atoms in the molecules of the gas will, under the influence of the electric 
forces, set themselves parallel to the direction of the electro-motive in- 
tensity at each point. 

Thus, when the magnetic force is at right angles to the line of dis- 
charge, tubes of electrostatic induction parallel to those in the molecules 
will be moving about in the field; and since parallel tubes exert attrac- 
tion and rei)ulsiou on each other, the molecular tubes will be knocked 
about and their efforts to form closed chains made much more difficult 
by the action of the magnet. On the other hand, when the lines of 
magnetic force are parallel to the discharge, the moving tubes are at 
right angles to those in the molecules, and widnot disturb them in the 
attempt to form chains along the line of magnetic force; they will in 
fact assist them in doing so by preventing all attempts in directions 
across the lines of force. 

Prof. G. F. Fitzgerald has suggested to me in conversation that tliis 
action of a magnet on thedischarge might be the causeof the " streamers" 
which are observed in the aurora; the rare air being electrically weaker 
along the lines of magnetic force than at right angles to them will cause 
the discharge in the direction of those lines to be the brightest. 

Discharge through different gases. — I have examined the discharge 
through air, carbonic acid, hydrogen, oxygen, coal gas, and acetylene. 
As I have already mentioned, at the highest pressures at which the 
discharge passes through air, the discharge is reddish, and gets brighter 
and whiter at lower pressures. If the discharge is examined through 
a spectroscope, the lines in the spectrum coincide with those obtained 
by sparking through air in the ordinary way with a jar in the circuit. 
The relative brightness of the lines in the spectrum of the discharge 
without electrodes varies very much with the pressure of the gas and 
the length of spark in the jar circuit. With a long spark in this cir- 
cuit, and the pressure such as to give a bright white discharge, the 
spectrum is very much like that of the ordinary jar discharge in air. 
When however the pressure is so low that the discharge passes with 
difficulty, a few lines in the spectrum shine out very brightly, whilst 
others become faint, so faint indeed sometimes that if the air spectrum 
were not thrown into the field of view of the spectroscope at the same 
time, they might pass unnoticed. Three lines which are very persist-

from the pumj). 

1 am in(lel)ted to Prol'. Liveinj;- for the h>an of a very tine direct- 
vision s])ectroscope, and to him and Mr. IJobinson, of the Cambridge 
Chemical Laboratory, for valuable advice in the attempts which 1 made 
to plioto,i>rai)h the spectra of some phosphorescent glows mentioned 
])clow. 

1 should like to call attention to the advantages for s[tectroscopic 
purposes which attend this method of ])roducing the discharge; it is 
easily d<uie either by an ordinary electrical machine or an iuducti(m 
coil. An intensely bright discharge is got, and there is no danger of 
comi)licatiou arising from the spectrum of the gas getting mixed with 
tliat of the electrodes. 

[)isc]i(t >•{/(' ill 'hriK/cii. — l>y far the most remarkable ai>])earance is pre- 
sented when the discharge passi-s through oxygen, tor in this gas the 
Ijright dischaige is succeeded by a i)hosphorescent glow which lasts 
tor a considerable time; indeed, with a strong discharge it may remain 
visible for more than a minnte. When the discharges sncceed one 
another pretty rapidly, the phosphorescence is so strong that it hides 
the successive bright discharges, and the tube seems pernmnently full 
of a bright yellow fog. We can thus, by the use of this gas, convert 
the intermittent light gi\en by the bright discliarge into a continuous 
one. 

Perhaps the most striking way of showing this phosphorescence is to 
use a long tube, about a meter long and (3 or 7 centimeters in diameter, 
with a bulb blown in the middle, the primary coil l)eing' twisted round 
this bulb. Then, when the si)arks i)ass between the jars, a bright ring 
discharge passes through the bulb, from which, as if shot out from the 
ring, the phosphorescent glow travels in both directions along the tube, 
moving slowly enough for its motion to be followed by the eye. It can 
not, therefore, be produced by the direct action of the light from the 
spark on the gas in the tube, for if it were, the glow would tra^■el with 
the velocity of light. It is necessary to meution this point, for the 
light from these discharges has great powers of producing phosphores- 
cence. 

Tlie glow seems to consist of gas which has been in the path of the 
discharge, and whose molecules liave been si)lit up by it and i)rojected 
from the line of discliarge. This gas wliich, when projected, is in a 
l)e(;uliar state, })y a pro(;ess of chemical combination gradually returns 
to its original condition, and it is while it is in this state of transition 
from its new condition, to tlu; old that it phosphoresces. If this is the 
case we should expect that the period of phosphores(;ence would be 
shortened by raising the temperature. On trying the experiment I 
found that this took place to a very marked extent. A disclnnge bulb 
tilled with oxygen at a low ])!-essure was jtlaced o\t'r a iiunscn burner;

before the bulb got Lot each biiylit discbarge Avns .succeeded by ii briglit 
after- glow, but as the bulb got hotter midhotter the glow became faiuter 
and faiuter, and at last ceased to be visible, though the bright riug 
was still produced at each discharge of the jar. Wheu the Buiiseu 
was takeu away aud the bulb allowed to cool the glow re-ai)])eared. 

The spectrum of the after-glow is a continuous spectrum, in which 
I could not detect the super-position of any bright lines. The only gas 
beside oxygen in which I have been able to detect any after-glow is air, 
though in this case the range of x>ressure within which it is exhibited 
is exceedingly small; indeed it is often by no means an easy matter to 
get a bulb lilled with air into the state in which it shows the glow. 
The spectrum of the air-glow showed bright lines; I thought myself 
that I could see a very faint continuous spectrum as well. Some friends 
however who were kind enough to examine the si)ectrum, though they 
could see the bright lines clearly enough, were of opinion that there 
was nothing else visible. I endeavored to photograph it, but without 
success, so that the existen{ie of a continuous spectrum for this glow 
must be considered doubtful. 

When the discharge passes through acetylene, the first two or three 
discharges are a bright apple-green ; the subsequent ones, however, are 
white, and as the green discharge does not reappear, we must conclude 
that the acetylene is decomposed by the discharge. 

Phosphorescence produced by the discharge. — The discharge without 
electrodes produces a very vivid phosphorescence in the glass of the 
vessel in which the discharge takes place; the phosphorescence is green 
when the bulb is made of German glass, blue wheu it is nmde of lead 
glass, "N^ot only does the bulb itself i)horphoresce, but a piece of ordi- 
nary glass tubing held outside the bulb and about a foot from it ])hos- 
phoresces brightly; while uranium glass will phosphoresce at a dis- 
tance of several feet from the discharge. Similar effects, but to a 
smaller extent, are produced by the ordinary si)ark between the poles 
of an electrical machine. 

The vessel in which the discharge takes place may be regarded as 
the secondary of an induction coil, and the discharge in it shows similar 
properties to those exhibited by currents in a metallic secondary. Thus 
no discharge is produced unless there is a free way all round the tube; 
the discharge is stopped if the tube is fused up at any point. In order 
that tlie discharge may take place, it is necessary that the molecules 
of the gas shall be able to form a closed chain without the interposition 
of any non-conducting substance; indeed, the discharge seems to be 
hindered by the presence in such a chain of any second body, even 
though it may be a good conductor of electricity. Thus, when a tube 
such as that in Fig. 7 is used, which has a barometer tube attached 
to it, so that by raising or lowering the vessel into which the tube 
dips a mercury pellet may be introduced into the discharge circuit, 



DISCHARGE (JF ELECTKICITY.

the si)ark leiigtli in the piiniary circuit may be «o adjusted tli.it a dis- 
cliarge passes when there is a clear way round the tube, l»ut st()[)s 
when a pellet of mercury is forced up so as to close tlie 
yanjiway. I noticed a similar effect in my experiments 
with a lonji' va<'uum tube described in the ProceediiH/.s of 
the Ti'oi/al Socictj/ for .lanuary, 1801. 

I had another discharge tube })repared, of whicli a sec- 
tion is shown in Fig. S, a-, in which a diaphragm (AB) of 
thin cop])er plate was placed across the tube; the diaphragm 
ha]»]>ened to catch at the bottom of the tube, so that it 
divided the latter rather unequally, and left a luirrow pas- 
sage round its edge. As much of the discharge as thert; 
was room for went round the edge of the i)late; the remain- 
der was not able to get through the copper, but formed a 
closed circuit by itself in the larger segment of the tube. 
In aiu)ther tube, which is represented in section in Fig. 8, /i, ^"'- ' 
the copper diapliragm was attached to the walls of the tube by sealing- 
wax, so that there was no free way; in this case the discharge again 
refused to go through the copper, and split up into two sei)arate dis- 
charges, as in the figure. AVheu the tube was divich-d by copper 
diaphragms into six segments, as in Fig 8, ?/, no discharge at all would 
pass through. When the primary was slipped up the tube above the 
diaphiagni, a brilliant discharge was obtained. These four experi- 
ments all illustrate the difficulty which the electricity has in getting 
transferred from a gas to another conductor.

There is do discharge through the secondary, if it is of such a kind 
(hat, considering a closed curve drawn in it, the electro-motive inten- 
sity as we travel along the curve tends to polarize the i)articles in one 
half of the chain in onc^ direction, and in the other half in tlie opposite 
direction, the direction being reckoned relative to the diiection we are 
traveling round the curve. Thus for examjde if we take a tube 
whose axis is bent back on itself, as in the figure, the electro-motive 
inti'nsity Avill tend to iK)larize the particles in one ])art of the chain in 
the direction of the arrow, and those in the other in tlie opposite

kind. 




h'w. it. 

On the other hand, the molecules exhibit remarkable powers of mak- 
ing closed chains for themselves when not actually prevented 
by the action of the electro-motive intensity. Thus the dis- 
charge will pass through a great length of tubing in the 
secondary, even if it is bent up as in Fig. 10, where tlie ver- 
tical piece in the upper part of the secondary is at right 
angles to tlie direction of the electric force, and where the 
molecules will receive no help in forming closed chains from 
the action of the external electro-motive forces. I have c- 
ceeded in sending discharges through tubes of this kind V2 
to 14 feet in leuirtli. - F\a. w. 



Screening effects due to the currents in the tubes. — One very noticeable 
feature of these discharges is the well-defined character of the ring, if 
the pressure is not too low. If a large bulb is used for the secondary 
with the primary just outside it, when the sparks 
pass between the jars a bright, well-defined ring 
passes through the bulb near to the suri'ace of the 
glass, the gas inside this ring being, as far as can 
be judged, quite free from any discharge. If now a 
bulb whose diameter is less than that of the lumin- 
ous ring is inserted in the primary in place of the 
larger bulb, a bright ring will start in this, though 
at this distance from the primary there was no dis- 
charge in the larger bulb. Thus when the large 
bulb was in the primary, the discharge through its 
(mter portions screened the interior from electro- 
■Jb^a/^ motive forces to an extent sufficient to stop a dis- 
^'*''^' (;harge which would otherwise take place. 

The screening action of these discharges is also shown by the follow- 
ing exi)eriment: A, B, C, Fig. 11, is the section of a glass vessel shaped 
like a Bunsen's calorimeter; in the inner portion A, B. C of this vessel

;iii oxliiiusted tube is placHMl, while a pipe Iroiii tlie outer vessel leads 
to a mercury ])uiiip and enables us to alter tlu' pressure at will. The 
primary coil, L, M. is wouiul round the outer tube. When the air in 
the outer tube is at atmosi)heric })ressure, the discharge caused by tbe 
action of the primary i)asses in the tube I'] inserted in A, B, C; but 
when the pressure iu the outer tube is reduced until a discharge i)asses 
through it, tlu' discharge in the inner one sto]>s; the discharge in the 
out(n- tube has thus sliielded the inner tube from the action of the 
primary. It the exhaustion of tiie outer tul)e is carried so tar that the 
discliarge through it ceases, tliat in the inner tube begins again. It re 
(piires very high exhaustion to do this, and as on account of the joints 
it is uusafe to niaivc the vessel very liot during the ])umping, I have 
found it impossible ro keep a vacuum good enougli to show this ettect 
for more thau from half to tiiree (piarters of an hour; in that time suffi- 
cient gas seems to have escaped from the sides of the vessel to make 
the pressure too high to show this effect, and It then takes from two to 
three hcmrs' ])unii)ing to get the tube back again into its former state. 
An interesting feature of this experiment is that for a small range of 
])ressure, just greater than that at which the discharge first ai)i»ears in 
the outer tube, there is no discharge iu either of the tubes; thus the 
action of the primary is screened off from the inner tube, though there 
is no luminosity visible in the outer one; this shows that a discharge 
ecpiivalent in its effects to a current can exist in the gas without suffi- 
cient luminosity to be visible even in a darkened room. We shall have 
occasicHi to mention other cases in which the existence of a discharge 
non luminous througiiout the whole of its course is rendered evident iu 
a similar way. 

Another experiment by which the screening can be effectively shown 
is to i)lace the primary coil inside a bell-Jar which is connected with a 
mercury i)umi), the electrical connexions with the primary being led 
through mercury joints. An exhausted bulb is placed inside the pri- 
mary, the bulb being considerably smaller than the primary, so that 
there is an air-space between the two. Before the bell-jai' is exhausted 
the discharge passes through the bulb, but when the ])ell-jar is ex- 
hausted sufficiently to allow of the discharge ])assing through the gas 
outside the bulb the discharge in the bulb ceases, and the oidy dis- 
charge is tliat oHtside. I ha\ e never Ixhmi able to exhaust the bulb 
sufficiently well to get the discharge outside the bell-jar to cease, and 
that in the bulb to appear again, as in the preceding experiment. In 
this experiment, as in tiie ])receding one, there was a range of pressure 
when neither the bulb nor the bell-Jar was luminous, showing again the 
existence of currents in the gas which are not accompanied by any 
appreciable luminosity. 

A curious beiiding-in of tiie discharge which takes i)lace in a stiuare 
tube i)rovided with a bulb can, I think, Ix; ex])lained by the princii)le 
of shielding. The discharge in the bulb does not, unless very long

s] talks are u«ed, take as its course throu<ili tlie bull) tlie prolongation 
ot the direction of the tube, but is bent-iu towards the primary. In 
Fig. 12 the dotted line represents the course the discharge 
would have taken if there had been no bulb, the continu- 
ous line the course actually taken. This bending-in can 
be explained by supposing the currents started- near the 
j)rimary to shield off from the outlying space the action 
of the ijrimary, and thus make the electro-motive in- 
tensity along the axis of the tube smaller than it would 
Fiu. 1.'. have been if no discharge had been possible between the 

axis and the primary circuit. 
Before describing some further experiments on this shielding effect, 
it will be useful to consider the means by which it is brought about. 
Let us suppose we have a vertical plate made of conducting material, 
and to the right of the i^late a region A which it shields. This region 
has to be shielded from tubes of electrostatic induction coming from 
the left, which have to i)ass through the shield before reaching A, and 
from tubes coming from the right which have to pass thr<mgh A before 
reaching the field. The action of the shield in the first case is very 
simple, for when a tube gets inside a conductor it at once attempts to 
contract to molecular dimensions, and after a time i^roportional to the 
specific resistance of the conductor it succeeds in doing so. Thus if the 
shield is made of a good conductor the tubes of electrostatic induction 
will be triinsformed into molecular tubes before they have time to get 
through; so that the shield will protect A from all tubes which have 
to go through it. The way the shield destroys or rather neutralizes 
the effect of the tubes coming from the right is somewhat different: 
when a positive tube reaches the shield a negative one emerges from it, 
travelling at right angles to itself in the opposite direction to the inci- 
dent tube; thus, when the first few tubes reach the shield from the 
riglit they will produce a supply of negative ones, and the presence of 
these negative tubes at A concurrently with the positive ones which 
continue to arrive there will ^A■eaken the field to a greater and greater 
extent as A approaches the shield. At the surface of the shield itself 
the neutralization will be complete. A dielectric whose specific induc- 
tive capacity is greater than usual will behave in a similar way to a 
metal plate, but to a smaller extent. It will emit tubes of the opposite 
sign, but not so numerous as those incident upon it. Thus a metal 
plate, or even one made of a dielectric of considerable specific inductive 
capacity, will reduce very considerably the tangential electromotive 
force on either side of it. 

I have made several experiments in which this effect was very strik- 
ingly .shown. In one of these, two square discharge-tubes of equal 
cross section i)laced near and parallel to each other were connected by 
a cross tube, so that the pressure was the same in both tubes; a fine 
wire passed round the inside of one of the tubes, its ends being con- 



DTSiOHARrxE OF ELECTRK'TTY. 247 

nceted togetlier so that it tunned a. (closed circuit, the other tube con- 
tained nothiiiji' but air at a low pressure. When this double tube wsis 
placed outside the primary the dischari^c^ went, at the passage of each 
sjiar-k, througli the tube without a wire, while the tube containing the 
wire remained <iuite dark. A similar experiment was tried by taking a 
cylindrical tube and siis])ending in it a metal ling co-axial with the 
tube; in this case it was easy to adjust the spark-length so that no dis- 
charge ])assed through the tul)e when tlie primary Avas ]daced round it 
at the level of the ring, while a discharge passed as soon as the primary 
was moved above or below the ring. 

Another very convenient tube for showing this etiect is the one with 
the hollow down the midd]<>, Fig. 11; when this is pumped so that dis- 
charges can pass througli the outer tube the spark-length can be 
adjusted so that the discharge stops immediately when a metal tube, a 
test-tube containing a strong solution of an electrolyte, or a tube con- 
taining air at a pressure at which it is electrically very weak, is placed 
in the central opening. The discharge is renewed again as soon as the 
tubes are removed. On one occasion, when the large tube was in a 
peculiarly sensitive state, 1 was able to see distinctly the diminution 
produced by a dielectric in the electro-motive intensity parallel to its 
surface. The discharge stopp<'d as soon as a stick of sulphur or a 
glass rod sufliciently large almost to till the opening was inserted, and 
was renewed again as soon as these were withdrawn. It requires how- 
ever the large tube to be in an extremely sensitive state for the efitect 
produced by a dielectric to be apparent, and I have only on one occa- 
sion succeeded in getting the tube into this condition. The effect on 
that occasion however was so d<^tinite an<l regular that 1 ha^e no 
doubt as to the existence of the screening eft'ect due to the dielectric. 

When the tube is of average sensitiveness <lielectrics do not pro- 
duce any appreciable ettect, nor can the iniiuence of even comparatively 
so good a conductor as distilled water be detected, and it is not until 
after the addition of a. considerable quantity, 10 to 20 i>er cent of sul- 
phuric; acid or anunonium cliloride that the insertion or withdrawal of 
the tube stops or starts the discharge. 

A tube containing air at a low i)ressure is very eflicacious in stopi)iug 
the discharge, and the result of the comparison of the relative effects 
of an exhausted tube and a tube of the same size and shape contain- 
ing a solution of an electrolyte are very remarkable. I fimnd that an 
exhausted tube which contained air at a very low pressure (less than 
yL of a millimetre) produced as nuich effect on the discharge in the 
outer tube as a tube containing at least r>0,(K)() times as many mole- 
cnles of ammonium chloiide. This would be expressed in the language 
of electrolysis by saying that under the electro-moti\e intensity to 
which it was ex])osed in Ihis e.\peiiu)ent the mohnmlar conducti\ity of 
the gas is 50,000 times that of the electrolyte. The pro^jortion between 
the number of air molecules aiul the luimber of molecules of an elec-

trolyte, which produces an equal eifect in stopping tlie discharge, 
depends upou the length of spark intlie primary current, and so upon 
the electro-motive force acting upon the air. The longer the spark the 
greater is the molecular conductivity of the air in coinparison with that 
of the electrolyte. This indicates that the conduction through the air 
does not follow Ohm's law. This is what we should expect, as under 
large electro-motive forces more molecules are split up and take part in 
the conduction of the electricity. This great conductivity of rarefied 
gases in those cases where the electricity has not to pass from metal, 
etc., into the gas are in striking contrast with the infinitesimally small 
values for the same property which are deduced from experiments on 
tubes with electrodes. 

I was first led to suspect this high conductivity for rarefied gases by 
observing the appearance presented by the ring-discharge in bulbs; 
the ring, unless the pressure is exceedingly low, ceases at a distance 
of little more than 1 centim from the surface of the bulb, this thick- 
ness of conducting gas being sufficient to screen off the electromotixe 
intensity from the interior. From experiments which I had made on 
the screening effect' of electrolytes {Proc. Roy. ^Soe. xlv. p. 269), I knew 
that it would require a very strong solution of an electrolyte to produce 
screening comparable with this. To compare the screening effects 
more directly than by the method just described 1 tried the following 
experiment. The discluirge-tube. Fig. 11, was pumi)ed until the dis- 
charge passed through it very freely; an exhausted tube was then 
pushed down the central opening, it remained quite free from any visi- 
ble discharge; the primary was now wound round a cylinder of tlie 
same diameter as the discharge-tube of Fig. 11, and this cylinder was 
tilled with distilled water. When the tube, Avhich had previously 
remained dark wlien placed in the exhausted discharge-tube, was im- 
mersed in the water, a brilliant discharge took place in it; and it was 
necessary to add about 25 per cent of sulphuric acid to the water before 
the shielding effect of the mixture was sufficient to keep the tube dark. 
This experiment shows perhaps even more directly than the other the 
great conductivity of a rarefied gas under large electro-motive forces 
when nothing but the gas is in the way of the passage of the current. 

An experiment made in this connection illustrates the remark made 
before as to the large effects produced by discharges through the gas 
which are not accompanied by luminosity. A bulb A was fused into a 
tube B which was surrounded by the primary coil C, I). B was ex- 
hausted and then sealed off', while A was left connected to the pump. 
When A was at atmospheric pressure a bright discharge took place in 
B outside A; on pumping A a stage was reached in which no dischargi^ 
could be seen in either A or B. On letting air into A the discharge 
appeared again in B; on i)umping A still further a discharge appeared 
in A, but not in B. The appearance presented by the discharge round 
the bulb A (filled in this case with air at high pressure) is very remark-

On file effect prodneed by vonduciors near the discharge tube. — The 
intensity of the discharge is very much alfected by the preseiu-e of con- 
ductors in the neighborhood of the discharge tube, especially conductors 
which have large capacity or which are connected to earth. Let us 
take, for example, a very simple case, that of a bulb surrounded by a 
lu'imary which is connected to earth; in this case the approach of the 
hand, or any conductor connected to earth, will make the discharge 
Innghter and at the sanu' time less well-detiiied at the edges; touching 
the tube, thimgli this is already connected to earth, produces a very 
marked effect in increasing the facility of the discharge. We can, I 
think, understand the reason of this if we consider the behavior of the 
tubes of electrostatic iudn(;tion. When the spark passes, these tubes 
(see Fig. 2, j). 284) rush out from the jars and make for the primary; in 
their Journey to the primary they pass thiough the bulb and produce the 
discharge. Let us snp])ose now that there is a large conductor situated 
somewhere near t]iel)ulb; the tubes, as before, rush from the jar to the 
primary, but in doing so s<»me of them strike against the conductor; 
the tubes which do so lose the i)ortion inside tlu^ conductor, ac(piire 
two ends each on the surface of the conductor, and swing round until 
they are at right angles to its surface; they remain momentarily 
anchored, as it Avere, to the conductor, and if th(^ coiiductar is in the 
neighborhood of the bull), they will in general help to increase the 
maximum density of the tubes passing through the bulb. Though 
these tubes may not approximate to closed curves, and so directly i)ro- 
duce a ring discharge, th«\v ni:iy readily facilitate- tliis discharge indi- 
rectly; for even those tubes which go radially through the bulb may

produce a <i,low dischiirge from the glass into the bulb, and may thus 
furnish a supply of dissociated molecules through which the ordinary ring- 
discharge can pass with much greater readiness. For nothing is more 
striking than the enormous difference produced in the electric strength 
of these rarefied gases by the passage of a spark. It is sometimes 
difficult to get the discharge to pass at first, but when once a spark has 
passed through the gas, a spark length one- quarter the length of that 
necessary to originate the discharge will be found sufficient to main- 
tain it. 

It is sometimes convenient, in cases where difficulty is found in start- 
ing the discharge, to avail ourselves of this property by connecting the 
mercury of the pump to which the tube is attached with one terminal 
of an induction coil, the other terminal of which is i^ut to earth. When 
tlie induction coil is in action, a glow-discharge fills the pump and tube, 
and while this glow exists the electrodeless discharge can easily be 
started; once liaving been started, it will continue after the induction- 
coil is stopped. An experiment of this kind, which I had occasion to 
make, gave very clear evidence of the way in which dissociated mole- 
cailes are projected in all directions from the negative electrode in an 
ordinary discharge tube, but not from the positive. The discharge tube 
was fused onto the pump, and at an elbow two terminals, c and d, Fig. 
II, were fused into the glass; these terminals were connected with an 

induction coil, and the pressure in the tube 
was such that the electrodeless discharge 
would not start of itself. When the coil was 
turned on so that c was the negative electrode 
the electrodeless discharge in the tube at 
oace took place, but no effect at all was pro- 
duced when (' was jjositive and d negative. 
We may thus regard the effect produced by 
the i)resence of a conductor as due to the 
conductor catching the tubes of electrostatic; 
induction and concentrating them on the 
O discharge tubes; these tubes in many cases 
acting indirectly by producing a glow dis- 
charge through the tube, which, by diminish- 
ing the electric strength of the gas, makes 
discliargesof any other kind very much easier. 
Fig. 14. Though the presence of a conductor near the 

discharge tube will, in general, concentrate the tubes of electrostatic 
induction on the discharge tube more than would otherwise be the case, 
yet this does not always happen. When in some positions the conduc- 
tor may hold back for a time from the discharge tube tubes of electro- 
static induction which would otherwise pass through it, and thus 
diminish tlie maxinuim density of the tubes of electrostatic induction 
in the discharge tube, and hence tend to stop the discharge. I have

DISCHARGE OF ELECTRICITY. 251 

IVo(|iieiitly met with cases where the [)reseMce of a conductor diminishes 
the intensity of the discharge. One of the most striking of these is 
when the two jars are iusnlated, and a square discharge tube used. 
The si)ark was adjusted so that the discharge just, but only just, went 
round the tube. A spliere connected to earth was then moved round 
the discharge tube; in some positions it increased the brilliancy of the 
discharge, and the tube became quite bright, while in other positions 
it stopped the discharge altogether. 

The observation of the behavior of the discharges through these 
tubes is a very convenient method of studying the effect of conductors 
in deflecting the flow of the tubes of electrostatic induction which fall 
upon them; for the appearance of the discharge is affected not merely 
by the average, but also by the maximum value of the electro-motive 
intensity which produces it. Thus a high maximum value, lasting only 
for a short time, might produce a discharge, while a more equable dis- 
tribution of electro- motive intensity having the same average value 
might leave the tube quite dark. 

1 have employed these discharges to study the behavior of bodies 
under the action of very rapid electrical oscillations in the following 
way: In the primary circuit connecting the outside coatings of the jar 
two loops, A and B (Fig. 15), were made, in one of 
which, A, an exhausted bulb was ])laced, the spark- 
length and the pressure of the gas on it being ad- 
justed until the discharge was sensitive, /. c, until 
a small alteration in the electro-motive intensity 
acting on the bulb produced a considerable effect 
upon the appearance presented by the discharge. 
The substance whose behavior under rapid elec- 
trical vibrations was to be examined was placed in 
the loop J5. The results got at flrstwere very per- 
plexing, and at flrst sight contradictory, and it was some time before I 
could see their ex])lanation. The Ibllowing are some of these results: 
When a highly exhausted bulb was ])]aced in B a brilliant discharge 
passed through it, while the discharge in A stopped. A bulb of the 
same size, lilled with a dilute solution of (^h'ctrolyte, i)roduce(l noa])pre- 
ciableettect; when iilled wirha strongsolntioii it dinnned the discliarge 
in A, but not to the same extent as the exhausted bulb. A piece of 
brass rod or tube inc^reased the brightness of the discharge in A; oii 
the other hand, a similar piece of ii'on rod or tube stoi)pe(l the dis- 
charge in A at once. The most decided effect. Iiowever, was pidduced 
by a small crucible made of })lnmbago and clay: this, wlien put in the 
loop B, stopped the <lischaige in A com})letely. 1 found however that 
by considering the work si)ent on the substance placed in B, tiie pre 
ceding results could be exi)lained. When a large amount of wori< is 
spent in 1>, the dis(;harge in A will be dimmed, while no api)reciable 
effect will be produced on A when the work spent in B is small. Now 




252 DISCHARGE OF ELECTRICITY. 

let us consider the work done in a secondary circuit whose resistance is 
R, whose coefficient of self-induction is L, and which has a coefficient 
of mutual induction, M, with the primary circuit. If the frequency of 
the current circulating in tlie primary is p, we can easily prove thatthe 
rate of absorption of work by the secondary is proi^ortional to 

R M2 jj2 



Thus the work given to the secondary viinislies when 11 = and when 
R^ infinity, and has a, nutxiiuum value when R = L^>. Thus the con- 
dition that the secondary should absorb a considerable amount of work 
is that the resistance should not differ much from a value depending 
on the shape of the circuit and the frequency of the current in the 
primary. No appreciable amount of work is consumed w hen the resist- 
ance is very much greater or very much less than this value. 1 tested 
this result by placing inside B a coil of copper wire. When the ends 
were free, so that no current could pass through it, it produced no 
efit'ect upon the bulb in A; when the ends were joined so that there 
was only a very small resistance in the circuit, the effect Avas, if any- 
thing, to increase the brightness of the discharge in A. When how- 
ever the ends were connected through a carbon resistance which could 
be adjusted at will, the discharge in A became very distinctly duller 
when there was a very considerable resistance in the circuit. This 
experiment confirms the conclusion that to absorb energy the resist- 
ance must lie within certain limits, and be neither too large nor too 
small. 

We can now see the cause of the differences observed when the sub- 
stances mentioned above were put into B. The brass rod and tube 
did not dim the discharge in A, because their resistance was too low; 
the weak solution of electrolyte, because the resistance was too great; 
while the resistances of the crucible and the strong solution of ele(;- 
trolyte which obliterated the discharge from A were near the value for 
which the absorption of energy by the system was a maxinuim. 

The case of iron is very interesting because it shows that even under 
these very rapidly alternating forces, iron still retains its magnetic 
properties. A striking illustration of the difference l)etween iron and 
other metals is shown when we take an iron rod and place it in B, the 
discharge in A immediately stops; if we now slip a brass tube over the 
iron rod tlie discluirge in A is at once restored. If on the other hand 
we use a brass rod and an iron tube, when the rod is put in B without 
the tube the discharge in A is bright; if we slij) the iron tube over the 
rod, the discharge stops. 

To compare the amount of heat produced in the brass and iron sec- 
ondaries [calculations are introduced by which the author estimates 
that] for iron and copper cylinders of the same dimensions it would be 
about seventy times as large in the iron as in the copper, assuming 



DISCHARGE OF ELECTKRITY. 253 

that the iron retaiiis its maiinetic jn-operties under these very rapidly 
alternating- forees. The result explains the etieet of the iron in stop- 
ping the (liseharge. As I am not aware that any magnetie properties 
of iron under such rai)idly alternating forces have been observed, I was 
anxious to make quite sure that the <lifference between iron and brass 
was not due solely to the differeiu'es between their specific resistances. 
The first experiment I tried with this object was to cover the iron rod 
with thin sheet platinum, such as is used for Grove cells. As the re- 
sistance of phxtinum is not very different from that of iron, if the effect 
depended merely upon the resistance, slipping a thin tube of platinum 
over the iron ought to make very little diii'erence. I found however 
that when tlie ])latinum was placed over the iron, all the])eculiar effects 
produced by the latter were absent, thus showing that the effect is not 
due to the resistance of the iron. It then occurred to me that 1 might 
test the same thing in another way by magnetizing the iron to satura- 
tion, for in this state // is nearly unity; thus if the result depended 
mainly on the magneti(i properties of the iron it ought to diminish 
when the latter is strongly magnetized. I accordingly tried an experi- 
ment in which the iron in the coil B was placed between the poles of a 
l)Owerful electro-magnet. When the magnet was "off" the iron almost 
stopped the discliarge in A; when it was "on" the discharge became 
brighter, not indeed so bright as if the iron were away altogether, but 
still unmistakably l)righter than when it Avas unmagnetized. This ex- 
periment, I tliink, i)roves that iron retains its magnetic projjerties 
when exposed to these rapidly alternating forces. 

Another result worthy of remark is that though a brass rod or tube 
inserted in B does not stop the discharge in A, yet if a piece of glass 
tubing of tlie same dimensions is coated with Dutch metal, or if it has 
a thin film of silver deposited upon it, it will stop the discharge very 
decidedly. We are thus led to the somewhat unexpected result that a 
thin layer of metal when ex[)osed to these very rapid electrical vibra- 
tions may absorb more heat than a thick one. I find, on calculating 
the heating effect in slabs of various th.icknesscs, that there is a thick- 
ness for which the heat absorbed is a maximum. - - 

The slight iii(;rease in tlie brigiitiiess of the discharge in A when a, 
brass rod is placed in 1> is due, I tiiiuJi, to the dimiiuilioii in the self- 
induction in the i)rimary <;ircuit i>rodiu-ed by this rod whose condnc- 
tivity is so good that it absorbs practically no heat. 

We will now return tothe<;aseof bad conductors, where nn is small; 
here the absor])tion of eneigy is proi)orti(»nal to the conductivity, and 
we might use this method to compare the conductivity of electrolytes 
for very rapidly alternating currents. I tried a few experiments of 
this kind and found, as 1 did in the experiments described in the Fro- 
ceedhifjs of the Roi/al iSoeiety, XLV, p. 200, that the ratio of the conduc- 
tivities of two electrolytes was the same for ra]»idly alternating as for 
steady currents. I was anxious, however, to see whether these rai)idly 



254 DISCHARGE OF ELECTKICITY. 

alternating ciiireuts could pass with the same facility as steady cur- 
rents from an electrolite to a metal. To try this two equal beakers were 
tilled with the same electrolyte made of such strength that when in- 
serted in B they i)ut out the discharge in A. I then placed in one 
beaker six ebonite diaphragms arranged so as to stop the eddy cur- 
rents, and a similar metallic diaphragm in the other. The ebonite 
diaphragm made the beaker in which it was placed cease to have any 
effect upon the dis(;harge in A. I could not detect however that the 
effect of the beaker in which the metal diaphragm was placed on the 
discharge in A was at all diminished by the introduction of the dia- 
phragm. I conclude therefore that very rapidly alternating currents 
can pass with facility from electrolytes to metals and vice versa. In this 
respect electrolytes differ from gases, the currents in which, as we have 
seen, are stopped by a metallic diaphragm in the same way as they would 
be by an ebonite one. 

It may be useful to observe in passing that a somewhat minute divi- 
sion of the electrolyte by the non-conducting diaphragm is necessary 
to stop the effect of the eddy currents; a division of the electrolytes 
into two or three portions seemed to produce very little effect. 

Another point wiiich is brought out by these experiments is the great 
conductivity of raritied gases when no electrodes are used as compared 
with that of electrolytes. An exhausted bulb will produce as much 
effect on the discharge in A as the same bull) tilled with a solution of 
an electrolyte containing about a hundred thousand times as many 
molecules of electrolyte. The molecular conductivity of raritied gases 
when the electro-motive intensity is very great and when no electrodes 
are used must be thus enormously greater than that of electrolytes. 

Bulbs filled with raritied gas used in the way I have described serve 
as galvanometers, by which we can estimate roughly the relative in-

THE MOLECULAR PROCESS IN MAGNETIC INDUCTION.* 



By Prof. .1. A. EwiNG, F. R. S. 



Magnetic indiu'tioii is the name given by Faraday to the act of be- 
comiug magnetized, wliieh certain substances perform when they are 
]»laced in a magnetic field. A magnetic field is the region near a mag- 
net, or near a conductor c<mveying an electrics current. Throughout 
such a region there is what is called magnetie force, and when certaiu 
substances are placed in the magnetic field the nuignetic force causes 
them to become nuignetized by magnetic induction. An effective way 
of producing a magnetic field is to wind a conducting wire into a coil, 
and pass a current througli the wire. Within tlie coil we have a region 
of comparatively strong magnetic force, and when apiece of iron is 
l)laced there it may be strongly magnetized. Not all substances possess 
this property. Put a piece of wood or stone or copi)er or silver into 
the field, and nothing noteworthy happens; but put a piece of irou or 
ni( ke] oi' cobalt and at once you find that the piece lias become a mag- 
net. These three metals, with some of tbeir alloys and compounds, 
stiind out from all other substances in this respect. Not only are they 
capable of magnetic induction — of becoming magnets while exposed 
to the action of tiie magnetic field, but when withdrawn from the field 
they are found to retain a part of the magnetism they acquired. They 
all show this ])roi»erty of r(^tentiveness, more or less. In some of them 
this residual nuignetism is feebly held, and may be shaken out or oth- 
erw isc remo\ed without difficulty. In others, notably in some steels, 
it is very ]>ersistent, and the 1;ict is taken advantiige of in the manu- 
facture of permanent magnets, which are simply bars of steel, of proper 
(juality, which have been subjected to the action of a strong mag- 
netic field. Of all substances, soft iron is the most suscei)tible io the 
action of the field. It <-an also under favorable conditions, retain — 
w hen taken out of the fu'Id — a v^ery large fraction of tlie magnetism that 
has Ix-en induced — more than nine-tenths, — more indeed than is re- 
tained by steel; but its hold of this residual magn<'tisin is not firm, and 
for that reason it will not serve as a material for permanent magnets. 
My pur])osc to-night is to give some account of the mole(;ular process 
through which we may conceive magnetic induction to take ])lace. and 
of the structure which makes residual magnetism possible.

256 THE MOLECULAR PROCESS IN MA(iNETIC INDUCTION. 

When a piece of iron or nickel or cobalt is magnetized by induction, 
the magnetic state j^ermeates the whole jjiece. It is not a suijerficial 
change of state. Break the piece into as many fragments as you please, 
and yon will find that every one of these is a magnet. In seeking an 
explanation of magnetic quality we must penetrate the innermost 
framework of the sul)stance — we must go to the molecules. 

Now, in a molecular theory of magnetism there are two i)ossibh', 
beginnings. We might suppose, with Poisson, that each molecule 
becomes magnetized when the field begins to act. Or we may adopt 
the theory of Weber, which says that the molecules of iron are 
always magnets and that what the field does is to turn them so that 
they face morc^ or less one way. According to this view, a virgin 
piece of iron shows no magnetic polarity, not because its molecules are 
not magnets, but because they lie so thoroughly '^higgledy-]»iggledy" as 
regards direction that no greater number point one way than another. 
But when the magnetic force of the field begins to act, the molecules 
turn in response to it, and so a preponderating number come to face in 
the direction in which the magnetic force is applied, the result of which 
is that the piece as a whole shows magnetic polarity. All the facts go 
to confirm Weber's view. One fact in particular I nsay mention at 
once — it is almost conclusive in itself. When the molecular magnets 
are all turned to face one way, the piece lias clearly received as much 
magnetization as it is cai)able of. Accordingly, if Weber's theory be 
true, we must expect to find that in a very strong magnetic field a piece 
of iron or other magnetizable metal heronwi^ S(ifvr(( fol, so thut it can 
not take up any more magnetism, however much the field be strength- 
ened. This is just what happens. Experiments were published a few 
years ago which ])ut the fact of saturation beyond a doubt, and gave 
values of the limit to which the intensity of magnetization may be 
forced. 

When a piece of iron is put in a magnetic field, wt' do not find that 
it becomes saturated unless the field is exceedingly strong. A weak 
field induces but little magnetism; and if the field be strengthened, 
more and more magnetism is acquired. This shoAA s that the molecules 
do not turn with perfect readiness in response to the deflecting mag- 
netic fin'ce of the field. Their turning is in some way resisted, and this 
resistance is overcome as the field is strengthened, so that the magnet- 
ism of the piece increases stej) by step. What is the directing force 
which })revents the molecules from at once yielding to the deflecting 
influence of the field, and to what is that force due? And ;igain, how 
comes it after they have been deflected they return partially, but by no 
means wholly, to their original i»laces when the field ceases to act? 

I think these questions receive a. complete and satisfactory answer 
when we take account of the forces which the molecules necessarily 
exert on one another in consequence of the fact that they are magnets. 
We shall study the matter by examining the behavior of groui)S of 



THE MOLECULAR PROCESS IN MACNETIC INDUCTION. 257 

little magnets, pivoted like compass needles, so that each is free to turn 
except for the constraint which each one suiters on account of the 
presence of its neighbors. 

But tirst let us see more particularly wliat ha[)pens when a i)iecc of 
iron or steel or nickel or cobalt is magnetized by means of a tield the 
strength of which is gradually augmented from nothin g. We may make 
the ex])eriment by i)lacing a piece of iron in a coil, and making a cur- 
rent How in the coil with gradually increased strength, noting at each 
stage the relation of the induced mag:netism to the strength of the field. 
This relation is observed t(> be by no means a simple one: it may be 
represented by a curve (Fig. 1), and an inspection of the curve will 
show that the process is divisible, broadly, into three tolerably distinct 
stages. In thcflist stage (<i) the magnetism isbeing nequired but slowly: 



Sq 



MAGNeric Force 

Fig. 1. 



the molecules, if we accept Weber's theory, are not responding readily — 
they are rather hard to turn. In the second stage (b) their resistance 
to turning has to a great extent broken down, and the piece is gaining 
magnetism fast. In the third stage (c) the rate of increment of mag- 
netism falls oif : we are there ai)proachiug the condition of saturation, 
thougli the process is still a good way from being completed. 

Further, if we stoj) at any point of the process, such as P, and grad- 
ually reduce the current in tlie coil until there is no current, and there- 
fore no magnetic tield, we shall get a curve like the dotted line PQ, the 
height of Q showing the amount of the residual magnetism. 

If we make tliis experiment at a point in the first stage {a), we vshall 
find, as Lord Rayleigh has shown, little or no residual magnetism; if 
we make it at any point in the second stage (/>), we shall find very 
much residual magnetism; and if we make it at any point in the third 
stage (c), we shall find only a little more residual magnetism than we 
should have found by making the experiment at the end of stage h. 
That part of the turning of the molecules which goes on in stage a con- 
tributes nothing to the residual magnetism. That part which goes on 
in stage c contributes little. But that part of the turning wliicli goes 
on in stage b contributes very mnclj.

258 THE MOLECULAR PROCESS IN MAGNETIC INDUCTION. 

In some specimens of magnetic metal we find a much sharper separa- 
tion of the three stages than in others. By applying strain in certain 
ways it is jiossible to get tlie stages very clearly separated. Fig. 2, a 
beautiful instance of that, is taken from a paper by Mr. Nagaoka — one 
of an able band of Japanese workers wlio are bidding fair to repay the 
debt that Japan owes for its learning to the West. It shows how a 
piece of nickel whicli is under the joint action of pull and twist becomes 
magnetized in a growing magnetic field. There the first stage is ex- 
ceptionally prolonged, and the second stage is extraordinarily abrupt. 




The bearing of all this on the uK^lecular theory will be evident when 
we turn to these models, consisting of an assemblage of little pivoted 
magnets, which may be taken to represent, no doubt in a very crude 
"way, the molecular structure of a magnetizable metal. I have here 
some large models, where the pivoted magnets are pieces of sheet steel, 
some cut into short flat bars, others into diamond shapes with i)ointed 
ends, others into shapes resembling mushrooms or umbrellas, and in 
these the magnetic field is produced by means of a coil of insulated 
wire wound on a large wooden frame below the magnets. Some ot 
these are arranged with the pivots on a gridiron or lazy- tongs of jointed 
wooden bars, so that we may readily distort them, and vary the dis- 
tances of the pivots from one another, to imitate some of the effects of 
strain in the actual solid. But to display the experiments to a large 
audience a lantern model will serve best. In this one the magnets are 
got by taking to pieces numbers of little pocket compasses. The pivots 
are cemented to a glass plate, through which the light passes in such a 
way as to project the shadows of the magnets on the screen. The mag- 
netic force is ai)[)lied by means of two coils, one on either side of the 
assemblage of magnets and out of the way of the light, which together 
produce a nearly uniform magnetic field throughout the wliole group. 
You see this when I make manifest the field in a well-known fashion, 
by dropping iron filings on the plate. 

We shall first put a single pivoted magnet on the plate. So long as 
no field acts it is free to ])oiut anyhow— there is no direction it prefers 
to any other, As soon as I apply even a very weak field it responds, 



THE MOLECULAR PROCESS IN MACxNETIC INDUCTION. 259 

turning at once into the exact direction of the applied force, for there 
was nothing (beyond a trifling friction at the pivot) to prevent it from 
turning. 

Now try two magnets. I liave cut off" the current, >so that there is at 
present no fiehl, hut you see at once thattlio pair has, so to speak, a will 
of its own. I may shake or disturb them as I please, but they insist on 
taking up a position (Fig. ."J) with the north end of one as close as i)os-

Fiii. :i. Fig. 4. 

sible to the sontli end of the other. If disturbed they return to it; this 
configuration is highly stable. Watch what happens when the mag- 
netic field acts with gradually growing strength. At first, so long as 
the field is weak (Fig. 4), there is but little defection; but as the de- 
flection increases it is evident that the stability is being lost, the state 
is getting more and mcn-e critical, until (Fig. 5) the tie that holds them 



together seems to break, and they suddenly turn, with violent swing- 
ing, into almost perfect alignment with tlie nuignefic tbrce II. J^ow I 
gradually remove the force, and you see that they are slow to return, 
but a stage comes when they swing back, and a complete removal of 
the force brings tliem into the condition with which we began (Fig. li). 
If we Avere to picture a ])iccc of ir>n as formed of a vast number of 
such pairs of molecular magnets, each pair far enough from its neigh- 
bors to be ])ractically out of reach of their magnetic intluence, we 
might deduce many of the observed magnetic ])roi)crties, but not all. 
In particular, we should not be able to account for so much residual

magnetism as is actually found. To get that, the molecules must make 
new coniu'ctioiis when the old ones a-i'e l)rokcn; their lelations are of 
a kind more complex thau the (|uasi-matrimoniai one which the experi- 



260 THE MOLECULAR PROCESS IN MAGNETIC INDUCTION, 

ment exhibits. Each molecule is a member of a larger community, 
and has probably many neighbors close enougli to aflect its conduct. 
We get a better idea of what happens by considering four magnets 
(Fig 6). At first, in the absence of deflecting magnetic force, they 
group themselves in stable pairs — in one of a number of jiossible com- 
binations. Then — as in the former case — when magnetic force is ap- 
plied, they are at first slightly deflected, in a manner that exactly 
tallies with what I have called the stage a of the magnetizing process.

Fig. 8. 



Next comes instability. Tlie original ties break up, and the magnets 
swing violently round ; but finding a new possibility of combining 
(Fig. 7), they take to tliat. Finally, as the field IkS further strengthened 
they are drawn into perfect alignment with the ai^plied magnetic force. 
(Fig. 8).

We see the same three stages in a multiform group (Figs. 9, 10, 
11). At first, tlie group, if it is shuffled by any casual disturbance, 
arranges itself tit random in lines that give no resultant polarity (Fig.

9). A weak force produces no iiiore tliaii slight quasi-elastic deflections 5 
a stronger force breaks up the old lines, and forms new ones more fa- 
vorably inclined to the direction of the force (Fig. 10). A very strong 
force brings alxtut saturation (Fig. 11). 

In an actual piece of iron there are multitudes of groups lying differ- 
ently directed to begin with — perhaps also different as regards the 
spacing of their mend)ers. Some enter the second stage while others 
are still in the first, and so on. Hence, the curve of magnetization 
does not consist of i^erfectly sharp steps, but has the rounded outlines 
of Fig. 1.

Notice, again, liow the behavior of these assemblages of elementary 
magnets agrees with what I have said about residual magnetism. If 
we stop strengthening the field before the first stage is passed — before 
any of the magnets have beconu^ unstable and have tund)led round 
into new idaces — the small detlection simply disappears, and there is no 
residual effect on the (configuration of the group. But if we carry the 
l)rocess far enough to have unstable deflections, the etfects of these 
l)ersist when the force is i-emoved, for the magnets then retain the new 
gronping into wliicli they have fallen (lug. 10). And again, the quasi- 
elastic dclh'ctions which go on dnring tlie third stagedo not add to the 
residual magnetism. 

Notice, further, what hapjxMis to the gronp if after ai)plying a magnetic

till a stage is readied wlien instability begins, and then reversal occurs 
witli a rush. We thus find a close imitation of all the features tlui^ 
are actually observed when iron or any of theotlier magnetic metals is 
carried through a cyclic magnetizing process (Fig 12). The effect of 
any such process is to form a loop in the curve which expresses the re- 
lation of the magnetism to the magnetizing force. The changes of 
magnetism always lag behind the changes of magnetizing force. This 
tendency to lag behind is called magnetic hysteresis.

We have a manifestation of hysteresis whenever a magnetic metal 
has its magnetism clianged in any manner througli changes in the 
magnetizing force, unless indeed the changes are so minute as to be 
confined to what I have called the first stage («, Fig. 1). Eesidual 
magnetism is only a particular case of hi/steresis. 

Hysteresis comes in whatever be the character or cause of the mag- 
netic change, provided it involves such deflections on the part of the 
molecules as make them become unstable. The unstable movements 
are not reversible witli respect to the agent whicli produces them; that 
is to say, they are not simply undone step by step as the agent is 
removed. 

We know, on quite independent grounds, that wlien the magnetism 
of a piece of iron or steel is reversed, or indeed cyclically altered in any 
way, some work is spent in performing the operation — energy is being 
given to the iron at one stage, and is being recovered from it at another; 
but when the cycle is taken as a whole there is a net loss, or rather a 
waste of energy. It may be shown that this waste is proportional to 



THE MOLECULAR PROCESS IN MAGNETIC INDUCTION. 263 

the area of the looj) in our diagrams. This energy is dissipated; that 
is to say, it is scattered and rendered nseh'ss; it takes the form of heat. 
The iron core of a transformer, for instance, which is having its mag- 
netism reversed with every pulsation of the alternating current, tends 
to become hot for this very reason; indeed, the loss of energy which 
happens in it, in consecpience of magnetic hi/sfcresLs, is a serious draw- 
back to the efticiency of alternating-current systems of distributing 
electricity. It is the chief reason why they require much more coal to 
be burnt, for every unit of electricity sold, than direct-current systems 
require. 

The molecular theory shows how this waste of energy occurs. When 
the molecule becomes unstable and tumbles violently over, it oscillates 
and sets its neighbors oscillating, until the oscillations are damped 
out by the eddy currents of electricity which they generate in the sur- 
rounding conducting mass. The useful work that can be got from the 
molecule as it falls ov^er islessthan the work that is done in replacing it 
during the return portion of the cycle. This is a simple mechanical 
deduction from the fact that the movement has unstable phases. 

I can not attemjtt, in a single lecture, to do more than glance at 
several places where the molecular theory seems to throw a flood of 
light on obscure and complicated facts, as soon as we recognize that 
the constraint of the molecules is due to their mutual action as mag- 
nets. 

It has been known since the time of Gilbert that vibration greatly 
facilitates the process of magnectic induction. Let a piece of iron be 
briskly tapped while it lies in the magnetic held, and it is found to take 
up a large addition to its induced magnetism. Indeed, if we examine 
the successive stages of the x>rocess while the iron is kept vibrating by 
being tapped, we find that the first stage {a) has practically disaji- 
peared, and there is a steady and rapid growth of magnetism almost 
from the very first. This is intelligible enough. Vibration sets the 
molecular magnets oscillating, and allows them to break 1 heir primi- 
tive mutnal ties and to res])ond to weak defiecting forces. For asimi- 
lar reason, vibration should tend to reduce the residue of magnetism 
which is left when the magnetizing force is removed, and this, too, 
agrees with the results of observation. 

Perha])s tlie most effective way to sliow tlie iiiHuencc of vil)ration is 
to apply a weak magnetizing force first, before tap])ing. If the force 
is adjusted so that it nearly but notciuite reaches the limit of stage (a), 
a great number of the molecular magnets are, so to speak, hovering on 
the verge of instability, and when the i)iec(' is tapped they go over like 
a house of cards, and magnetism is accpiiied with a rush. Tajjping 
always has some elfect ol'the same kind, ev^Mi though there has been 
no si)ecial adjustment of the Held. 

And other things besides vii)ration will act in r. similar way, ])recii)i- 
tating the break-ui) of mole(;ular groups when tlie ties are already 



264 THE MOLECULAR PROCESS IN MAGNETIC INDUCTION. 



strained. Change of temperature will sometimes do it, or the applica- 
tion or change of mechanical strain. Suppose, for instance, that we 
apply pull to an iron wire while it hangs in a weak magnetic lield, by 
making it carry a weight. The first time that we put on the weight, 
the magnetism of the wire at once increases, often very greatly, in con- 
sequence of the action I have just described (Fig. 13). The molecules 
have been on the verge of turning, and the slight strain caused by the 
weight is enough to make them go. Eemove the weight, and there is 
only a comparatively small change in the magnetism, for the greater 
part of the molecular turning that was done when the weight was put 
on is not undone when it is taken off. Re-apply the weight, and you 
find again but little change;, though there are still traces of the kind of 
action which the first application brought about. 
That is to say, there are some groups of molecules 
which, though they were not broken up in the first 
api^lication of the weight, yield now, because they 
have lost the sup])ort they then obtained from neigh- 
bors that have now entered into new combinations, 
indeed, this kind of action may often be traced, al- 
ways diminishing in amount, during several succes- 
sive applications and removals of the load (see Fig. 
13), and it is only when the process of loading has 
been many times repeated that the magnetic change 
brought about by loading is just opposite to the 
magnetic change brought about by unloading. 

Whenever indeed we are observing the effects of 
an alteration of jihysical condition on the magne- 
tism of iron, we have to distinguish between the 
I)rimitive effect, which is often very great and is 
not reversible, and the ultimate effect, which is seen 
only after the molecular structure has become some- 
what settled through many repetitions of the proc- 
ess. Experiments on the effects of temperature, of 
strain, etc., have long ago shown this distinction 
to be exceedingly important; the molecular theory 
makes it perfectly intelligible. 

Further, the theoiy makes i)lain another curious result of experiment. 
When we have loaded and unloaded the iron wire many times over, so 
that theefiect is no longer complicated by the primitive acti<m I have 
just described, we still find that the magnetic changes which occur 
while the load is being put on are not simply undone, step by step, 
while the load is being taken ofi". Let the whole load be divided into 
several parts, and you will see that the magnetism has two different 
values, in going up and in coming down, for one and the same inter- 
mediate value of the load. The changes of magnetism lag behind the 
changes of load; in other words, there is hysteresis in the relation of 



2 160

ing a soft iron wire in

the magnetism to the load (Fig. 14). This is because some of the molec- 
ular groups are every time being broken up during the loading, and 
re-established during the unloading, and that, as we saw already, in- 
volves hysteresis. Consequently, too, each loading and unloading re- 
quires the expenditure of a small (juantity of energy, which goes to 
heat the metal.

Moreover, a remarkably interesting conclusion ibllows. This hys- 
teresis, and conse(juent dissii)ation of energy, will also hai)pen though 
there be no magnetization of the piece as a whole; it depends on the 
fact that the molecules are magnets. Accordingly, we should expect 
to find, and experiment conflrins this (see Phil. Tram.^ 188;"), j). 014), 
that if tlie wire is loaded and unloaded, even when no magnetic field 
acts and there is no magnetism, its i)hysical qualities which are changed 
by the load will change in a manner involving hysteresis. In i>artic- 
ular, the length will be less for the same load during loading than dur- 
ing unloading, so that woik may be wasted in every cycle of loads. 
There can be no sucli thing as i)erfect elasticity in a magnetizable 
metal, unless, indeed, the raiige of the strain is so very narrow that 
none of the molecules tumble through unstable states. This nuiy have 



^66' THfi MOLECULAR PROCESS IN MAGNETIC INDUCTION. 

something- to do witli tlie fact, well known to engineers, that nnmerons 
repetitions of a straining action, so slight as to be safe enough in itself, 
have a dangerous eflfect on the structni'e of iron or steel. 

Another thing on which the theory throws liglit is the phenomenon 
of time-lag in magnetization. When a piece of iron is put into a 
steady magnetic field, it does not take instantly all the magnetism that 
it will take if time be allowed. There is a gradual creeping up of the 
magnetism, which is most noticeable when the field is weak and when 
the iron is thick. If you will watch the manner in which a group of 
little magnets breaks up when a magnetic force is applied to it, you 
will see that the process is one that takes time. The first molecule to 
yield is some outlying one which is comparatively unattached — as we 
may take the surface molecules in the piece of iron to be. It falls 
over, and then its neighbors, weakened by the loss of its support, fol- 
low suit, and gradually the disturbance propagates itself from molecule 
to molecule throughout the group. In a very thin piece of iron — a fine 
wire, for instance — there are so many surface molecules, in comparison 
with the whole number, and consequently so many points which may 
become origins of disturbance, that the breaking up of the molecular 
communities is too soon over to allow much of this kind of lagging to 
be noticed.

Pig. 15. — Relation of magnetic inductive cai)acity to temperature in liard steel (Hopkin.son). 

Eftects of temperature, again, may be interpreted by help of the 
molecular theory. When iron or nickel or cobalt is heated in a weak 
magnetic field, its susceptibility to magnetic induction is observed to 
increase, until a stage is reached, at a rather high temperature, 
when the magnetic quality vanishes almost suddenly and almost com- 
pletely. Fig. 15, from one of Hopkinson's papers, shows what is ob- 
served as the temperature of a piece of steel is gradually raised. The 
sudden loss of magnetic quality occurs when the metal has become 
red hot; the magnetic quality is recovered when it cools again suffi- 
ciently to cease to glow. Now, as regards the first efiect — the increase 
of susceptibility with increase of temperature — I think that is a con- 
sequence of two independent effects of heating. The structure is ex- 
l)anded so that the molecular centers lie further apart. But the free- 
dom with which the molecules obey the direction of any applied mag- 
netic force is increased not by that only, but perhaps even more by

tlieir bt'iii,!;' tliiown into vibration. When tlie field i-s weak, heating 
consequently assists magnetization, sometimes very greatly, by has- 
tening tlie passage from stage (( to stage b of the magnetizing process. 
And it is at least a conjecture worth consideration whether tlu^ sudden 
loss of nmgnetic quality at a higher temperature is not due to the vi- 
brations becoming so violent as to set the molecules spinning, when^ 
of course, their polarity would be of no avail to produce magnetiza- 
tion. We know at all events that when the change from the magnetic 
to the non-magnetic state occurs, there is a ]>rofound molecular change, 
and heat is absorbed which is given out again when the reverse change 
takes place. In cooling from a red heat, the iron actually extends at 
the moment when this change takes i)lace (as was shown by Gore), 
and so much heat is given out that (as Barrett observed) it re-glows, 
becoming brightly red, thongh just before the change it had cooled so 
far as to be quite dull. [Experinu'nt, exhibiting retraction and re- 
glow in cooling, shown by means of a long iron wire, heated to redness 
by an electric cnrrent.] The changes which occur in iron and steel 
about the temperature of redness are very complex, and I refer to this 
as only one possible direction in which a key to them may be sought. 
Perhai)S the full explanation belongs as much to chemistry as to physics. 

An interesting illustration of the use of these models has reached 
me, only to-day, from Xew York. In a paper just published in the 
Elect riad World (reprinted in the Ulectric tan for May 29, ISDl), IMr. 
Arthur lloopes supi)orts the theory I have laid before you by giving 
curves which show the connection exi)erimentally found by him 
between the result polarity of a group of little pivoted magnets and 
the strength of the magnetic field, when the field is apidied, removed, 
reversed, and so on. I shall draw these curves on the screen, and 
rough as they are, in consequence of the limited number of magnets, 
you see that they succeed remarkably well m reproducing the features 
Avhich we know the curves for solid iron to ])()ssess. 

It may, perhaps, be fairly claimed tliat the models whose behavior 
we have been considering have a wider application in physics than to 
merely elucidate magnetic i)rocesses. The molecules of bodies may 
have polarity which is not magnetic at all — jxdarity, for instance, due 
to static electrification — under Avhicli they group themselves in stable 
forms, so that energy is dissipated whenever these are broken up and 
re-arrangcd. When we strain a solid body beyond its limit of elasticity, 
we expend work irre<;overab]y in overcoming, as it were, internal fric- 
tion. What is this internal friction due to but the breaking and 
making of molecular ties ? And if internal friction, why not also the 
surface friction which causes work to be si)ent when one body rubs 
upon another. In a highly suggestive passage of one of his writings,*

268 THE MOLECULAR PROCESS IN MAGNETIC INDUCTION. 

Clerk Maxwell threw out the hint that many of the irreversible proc- 
esses of physics are due to the breaking up and re-construction of 
molecular groups. The models help us to realize Maxwell's notion, 
and in studying them to-night, I think we may claim to have been 
going a step or two forward where that great leader i^ointed the way. 



CRYSTALLIZATION.* 



By G. D. LiVEiNG, F. E. S. 



There is something very fascinating about crystals. It is not merely 
the intrinsic beauty of their forms, their picturesque grouping, and 
the phiy of light upon their faces, but there is a feeling of wonder at 
the power of nature, which causes substances, in ])assing from the 
fluid to the solid state, to assume regular shapes bounded by plane 
faces, each substance with its own set of forms, and its faces arranged 
with characteristic symmetry; some, like alum, in perfect octahedra; 
others, like blue vitriol, in shapes winch are regularly oblique. It is 
this power of nature which is the subject of this discourse. I hoi^e to 
show that crystalline forms, with all their regularity and synmietry, 
are the outcome of the accepted princii)les of mechanics. I shall 
invoke no peculiar force, but only such as we are already familiar with 
in other facts of nature. I shall (;all in only the same force that ])ro- 
duces the rise of a liquid in a capillary tube and the surface-tension at 
the boundary of two substances which do not mix. Whether this 
force bo different from gravity I need not stop to inquire, for any 
attractive force which for small masses, such as we sup])ose the mole- 
cules of matter to be, is only sensible at insensible distances is suffi- 
cient for my purpose. 

We know that the external forms of crystals are intimately connected 
with their internal structure. This is betrayed by the cleavages with 
which ill mica and seleuite everybody is familiar, and which extend to 
the minutest parts, as is seen in the tiny rhombs which form the dust 
of cruslicd calcite. It is better marked by the optical properties, single 
and double refraction, and the effects of crystals on polarized light. 
These familiar facts lead up to the thought that it is really the internal 
structure which determines the external form. As a starting-])oint for 
considering that structure, I assume that crystalline matter is made 
up of molexudes, ami tliat, whereas in the fluid state the molecules 
move about amongst themselves, in the solid state they have little 
freedom. They are always Avithin the range of each other's influence- 
and do not change their relative places. Nevertheless, these mole, 
cules are in constant and very rapid motion. Xot only will they com- 
municate heat to colder bodies in contact with them, l)ut they are

always radiating, wliicli means producing waves in the aether at the 
rate of many billions in a second. We are sure that they have a great 
deal of energy, and, if they can not move far, they mnst have very 
rapid vibratory motions. It is reasonable to suppose that the parts of 
each molecule swing, backwards and forwards, through, or about, the 
center of mass of the molecule. Tlie average distances to which the 
parts swing will determine the average dimensions of tlie molecule, 
the average space it occupies. 

Dalton fancied he had proved that the atoms of the chemical elements 
must be spherical, because there was no assignable cause why they 
should be longer in one dimension than another. I rather invert his 
argument. I see no reason why the excursions of the i^arts of a mole- 
cule from tlie centre of mass should be equal in all directions, and 
therefore assume, as the most general case, that these excursions are 
unequal in different directions. And, since tlie movements must be 
symmetrical with reference to the centre of mass of the molecule, they 
will in general be included within an ellipsoid, of which the center is 
the centre of mass. 

Here I may [)erhaps guard against a misconception. We chemists 
are familiar with the notion of complex molecules; and most of us 
figure to ourselves a molecule of common salt as consisting of an atom 
of sodium and one of chlorine held together by some sort of force, and 
it may be imagined that these atoms are the parts of the molecules 
which I have in mind. That however is not my notion. I am para- 
doxical enough to disbelieve altogether in the existence of either 
sodium or chlorine in common salt. Were my audience a less philoso- 
phical one I could imagine I heard the retort from many a lip : " Why, 
you can get sodium and chlorine out of it, and you can make it out of 
sodium and chlorine ! " But no, you can not get either sodium or chlorine 
out of common salt without first adding something which seems to me 
of the essence of the matter. You can get neither sodium nor chlorine 
from it without a(hling energy; nor can you make it out of these ele- 
ments without sul)tracting energy. My point is that energy is of the 
essence of the molecule. Each kind of molecule has its own motion; 
and in this I think most physicists will agree with me. Chemists will 
agree with me in thinking that all the molecules of the same element, 
or compound, are alike in mass, and in the space they occupy at a 
given temperature and pressure. The only remaining assumption I 
make is that the form of the ellipsoid — the relative lengths of its axes — 
is on the average the same for all the molecule sof the same substance. 
This implies that the distances of the excursions of the parts of the 
molecule depend on its constitution, and are, on the average, the same 
in similarly constituted molecules under similar circumstances. 

I have come to the end of my postulates. I hope they are such as 
you will readily concede. I want you to conceive of each molecule as 
having its parts in extremely rapid vibration, so that it occupies a 
larger space than it would occupy if its parts were at rest; and that

the excursions of the ])arts about the center of mass are on the average, 
at a iiiven temperature and pressure, compiised within a certain ellip- 
soid; that the dimensions <»f this ellipsoid are the same i'or all molecules 
of the same chemical constitution, but different for molecules of differ- 
ent kinds. 

We have now to consider how these molecnles will i)ack themselves 
on passing from the lluid state, in which they can and do move about 
amonost themselves, into the solid state, in which they have no sensible 
freedom. If they attract one another, according to any law, and for 
my purpose gravity will suffice, then the laws of energy require that for 
stable equilibrium the potential energy of a system shall be a minimnm. 
This is the same, in the case we are considering, as saying that the 
molecules shall be packed in such a way that the distances l)etwcen 
their centers of mass shall on the whole be the least possible; or, that 
as many of them as possible shall be packed into unit space. In order 
to see how this packing will take place, it will be easiest to consider 
first the particular case in which the axes of the ellipsoids are all 
equal — that is, when tlie ellipsoids happen to be spheres. The prob- 
lem is then reduced to tindiiig how to pack the greatest nuinl)cr of 
equal spherical balls into a given si)ace. It is easy to leduce this to 
the problem of finding how the spheres can be arranged so that each 
one shall be touched by as many others as possil)le. En this way tlie 
cornered si>aces between the balls, the unoccupied room, is reduced to 
a minimum, Vou can stack balls so that each is touched by twelve 
others, but not by more. At first sight it seems as if this might be 
done in two wavs.

four-sided pyramid, of which each side is an equilateral triangle, as 




represented in Fig. 2. It will be seen that, in these triangular faces, each 
ball (except,of course, those forming the edges) is touched by six others. 
Again, if we start with such a triangle, as in Fig. 3, where each ball 
is touched by six others, we can place one ball — the shaded one — so as

ing it, as indicated by the dotted circles. In three of the triangular 
holes between the shaded ball and the dotted balls touching it we can 
place three more, so as to touch the shaded ball— again twelve touch-

iiif;^ it iu all. If we complete the pile, we shall get tlie triangular 
pyramid represented by Fig. -4, where each of the three sides is a right- 
angled triangle, while the base is an (equilateral triangle. It will be 
seen that in the laces of this pyramid each ball (except those outside) 
is touched by four others. In fact, the arrangement in these faces is 
the same as in the base of the former pyramid; and the two arrange- 
ments are really identical in the interior, only one has to be turned 
over in order to bring it into parallelism with the other. Fig. '2 rep- 
resents half a regular octahedron; Fig 4 the corner of a cube. Elli})- 
soids if they are all equal and similiar to one another can be i)acked 
in precisely the same way, so that each is touched by twelve others, 
l)rovided their axes are kept j)arallel to each other — that is, if they 
are all oriented alike. This, then, by the laws of energy, will be the 
arrangement which the molecules will assume in consequence of mutual 
attraction, in i»assing from a fluid to a solid state. 




^ext, let us see how the packing of the molecules will affect the ex- 
ternal form. And here I bring in the surface tension. We are famil- 
iar with the eflects of this force in the ease of liquids, and if we adopt 
the usually received theory of it, we must have a surface tension at the 
boundary of a solid, as well as at the surface of a li([uid, [ know of 
no actual measures of the surface tension of solids; but (»),uincke has 
given us the surface tensions of a number of substances at temiieratures 
near tlicir points of soliditication, in dynes per lineal centimeter, as 
follows:

The surface tensions of most of the solids are probably greater than 
these, for the surface tension generally diminishes witli increase of 
temperature: and you see that they amount to very considerable Ibrces. 
II. Mis. 114^ 18, 



274 CRYSTALLIZATION. 

We have to do, tneii, with an agency which we can not neglect In all 
these cases the tension measnred is at a surface bounded by air, and is 
such as tends to contract the surface. We have, then, at the boundary 
between a crystallizing solid and the fluid, be it gas or liquid, out of 
which it is solidifying, a certain amount of potential energy; and by 
the laws of energy the condition of equilibrium is, that this potential 
energy shall be a minimum. The accepted theory of surface tension is 
that it arises from the mutual attraction of the molecules. The energy 
will, therefore, be a minimum for a surface in which the molecules are 
as closely set as possible. 

Kow, if you draw a surface through a heajj of balls packed so that 
each is touched by twelve others, you will find that the surfaces 
which have the greatest number of centers of balls per unit area are 
all plane surfaces. That in which the concentration is greatest is the 
surface of a regular octahedron, next come that of a cube, then that of 
a rhombic dodecahedron, and so on according to the law of indices of 
crystallographers. The relative numerical values of these concentra- 
tions are as follows, taking that of the faces of the cube as unity: 

Octahedron 1. 1547 | Tetrakishexaliedron 0. 4472 

Cube 1. 0000 Eikositessarahedrou 0. 4083 

Dodecahedron 0. 7071 1 Triakisoctahedron 0. 3333 

We do know that the surface tension is exactly in the inverse pro- 
portion to the concentration ; all that we can at present say is that it 
increases as the concentration diminishes. 

If, then, the molecules occupy spherical spaces, the bounding sur- 
face will tend to be a regular octahedron. 




But we have another point to consider. If a solid is bounded by 
plane surfaces, there must be edges where the planes meet. At such 
an edge the surfjice tensions will have a resulr.ant (see Fig. 5) tending 
to compress the mass, which must be met by a corresponding opposite 
l)ressure, and unless there is some internal strain there must be a cor- 
respondent resultant of the tensions on the opposite side of the crystal. 
Hence, if one face of a form is developed the opposite face will also be 
developed -, and generally, if one face of a form be developed all the 



CRYSTALLIZATION. 275 

faces will be developed; nud if one edge, or angle, be truncated, all the 
correspond iiig edges, or angles, will be truncated. Were it otherwise, 
there would not be a balance between the surface tensions in the sev- 
eral faces. But there is another point to be taken into account. The 
surface energy may become less in two ways — either by reducing the 
tension per unit surface, or by reducing the total surface. When a 
li(piid separates from another fluid, as chloroform from a sohition of 
chloral hydrate on adding an alkali, or a cloud from moist air, the 
liquid assumes the form which, for a given mass, has the least surface — 
that is, the drops are spherical. If you cut off the i)roJ('cting corners 
ami plane away tlie projecting edges of a cube or an octahedron, you 
bring it nearer to a si)here, and if you suppose the volume to remain 
constant, you still diminisli the surface. And if the diminution of the 
total surface is not comi)ensated by the increased energy on the trunca- 
tions, there will be a tendency for the crystals to grow Avith such 
truncations. The like will be true in more complicated combinations. 
There will be a tendency for sucli combinations to foi'm, provided the 
surface energy of the new faces is not too great as compared with that 
of the first simple form. 

But it does not always happen that an octahedron of alum develops 
truncated angles. This leads to another point. To produce a surface 
in a continuous mass requires a supply of energy, and to generate a 
surface in the interior of any fluid is Jiot easy. Air maybe super-satu- 
rated with aijueous vapor, or a solution with a salt, and no cloud or 
crystals be formed, unless tiiere is some discontinuity in the mass, 
specks of dust, or something of the kind. In like manner, if we have 
a surface already, as wlieu a supersaturated solution meets tlie air or 
the sides of the vessel containing it, and if the energy of either of these 
surfaces is less than that of a crystal of the salt, some energy will have 
to be supplied in onler to produce the new surfa(;e, but not so much as 
if there were no surface there to begin with. Hence, crystals usually 
form on tlu^ sides of tlie vessel or at the toj) of the liquid. When a solid 
sei>arates from a solution there is gencMally some energy available from 
the changi; of state, Avhich su])plies the energy lor the new surface. 
But at tirst when the mass deposited is very small, the energy 
available will be correspondingly small, and since the mass varies as 
the cube of the dianu^ter of the solid, whereas the surface varies as 
the square of the diameter, tlie flrst separated mass is liable to be 
squeezed into liquid again by its own surface tension. This explains 
the usual phenomena of sui)er-saturated solutions. A deposit occurs 
most easily ou a surface of the same energy as that of the deposit, 
because the additiomil energy reipiired is only for the increased extent 
of surface. It ex])lains, too, the tendency of large crystals to grow 
more rapidly than small ones, because the ratio of the increase of 
surface to that of voluiiu' diminishes as the crystal grows. 

While speaking of the difficulty of creating a new surface in the in- 



276 CRYSTALLIZATION. 

terior of a mass, the question of cleavage suggests itself. In dividing 
a crystal we create two new surfaces — one on each piece, and each with 
its own energy. Tlie division nuist tlierefore take place most readily 
when that surface energy is a minimum. Hence the jmncipal cleavage 
of a crystal made up of molecules having their motions comprised within 
spherical spaces will be octahedral. As a fact, we tind that the greater 
part of substances which crystallize in the octahedral, or regular sys- 
tem, have octahedral cleavage. But not all; there are some, like rock 
salt and galena, which cleave into cubes, and a very few, like blende? 
have their easiest cleavage dodecahedral. These I have to explain. I 
may however first observe that some substances — as, for instance, 
fluor-spar — which have a very distinct octahedral cleavage are rarely 
met with in the form of octahedra, bnt usually in cubes. In regard to 
this, we must remember that the surface energy depends upon the 
nature of both the substances in contact at the surface, as well as on 
their electrical condition, their temperature, and other circumstances. 
The closeness of the molecules in the surface of the solid determines the 
energy, so far as the solid alone is concerned; but that is not the only 
— though it may be the most important — factor conducing to the result 
It is therefore quite possible that, under the circumstances in which 
the natural crystals of fluor were formed, the surface energy of the 
cubical faces was less than that of the octahedral, although when we 
experiment on tliem in the air, it is the other way. This supposition 
is confirmed by the well-known fact that the form assumed by many 
salts in crystallizing is affected by the character of the solution. Thus 
alum, which from a. solution in pure water always assumes the octa- 
hedral form, takes the cubic form when the solution has been neutra- 
lized with potash. 

To return to the cubic and dodecahedral cleavages. If we suppose 
the excursions of the jiarts of the molecule to be greater in one direc- 
tion than in the others, the figure within which the molecule is comprised 
will be a prolate spheroid ; if less, an oblate spheroid. Now, as already 
explained, the .spheroids will be packed as closely as jiossible if the axes 
are all paralled and each is touched by twelve others. Xow suppose 
the spheroids arranged as in Fig. 0, with their axes perpendicular to 




Fig. 6. 

the plane of the figure; place the next layer in the black triangular 
spaces, and complete the pyramid. The three faces of the pyramid 



CRYSTALLIZATION. 277 

will be equal isoscles trani;i('s; and if the spheroids be oblate, and the 
axis halt the liieatest diameter, the tliree angles at the apex of the pyra- 
mid will be right angles. The erystal will Inive ^ubie syninietry. but the 
relative eondensation in the faees of the cube, octahedron, and dodeca- 
hedron, will be as i -.{)%)" A -A)-! oil. Tlie easiest cleavage would there- 
fore be cubic, as in lock salt and galena. 

Again, if the spheroids ha\'c their axes and greatest diameters in the 
ratio of 1 : -/-. iii'<^l ^ve i)lacefour, as in Fig. 7, with their axes perpen- 




Fic. 7- 

dicular to the plain' of the figure, then place one upon tliem in the 
middle, and then four more ui)on it, in positions corresponding to those 
of the first four, we get a cubical arrangement, the center of a spheroid 
in each angle of a cube, and one in the center of the cube. Crystals 
so formed will have cubic symmetry, but the concentration of molecules 
will be greatest in the faces of the dodecahedron, and their easiest 
cleavage will be, like that of blende, dodecahedral. 

If spheroids of any other dimensions be arranged, as in Figs. 1 and 
2, with their axes perpendicular to the plane of Fig. 1, we shall get a 
crj'stal with the symmetry of the pyramidal system. If the sjdieroids 
be prolate, the fundamental octahedron will be elongated in the direc- 
tion of the axis, and if sufficiently elongated, the greatest condensation 
will be in planes perpendicular to the axis, and the easiest cleavage, as 
in pi'ussiate of i)otash, in tliose planes. On the other hand, if the 
spheroids ])e sufticiently oblate, the easiest cleavage will be parallel to 
the axis. 

If spheroids be arranged, as in Fig. (!, with their axes ])erpendicular 
to th(^ i)lane of the figure, they will, in general, ])rodnc(^ rhombohedral 
symmetry, with the rhombs acnte or obtuse, according to the length 
or shortness of the axes of the spheroids. The cubical form already 
described is oidy a particular case of the rhombohedral. If the ratio 
between the axis of the spheroids and their greatest diameters beonly 
a little greater or a little less than 1 : 2, tlie condensation will be great- 
est in the faces of the rhombohedron, and the easiest cleavage will be 
rhombohedral, as in calcite. if the spheroids be prolate, the easiest 
cleavage will l)e ])erpendicnlar to tlie axis of symmetry, as in beryl and 
many other crystals. Such crystals have a tendency to assume hex- 
agonal forms — e([uiangular six-sided prisms and pyramids. To explain 
this, it may be seen in Fig, (5 that, in i)lacing- the next layer Tii)on the 
spheroids represented in the figure, the three spheroids which touch that 
marked a may oc<rui)y eithei- tlie three adjacent white tiiangles or the 
three black ones. Either position is ci^ually probable. The layer oc- 



278 CRYSTALLIZATION. 

cupying the wliite triangles is iu the position of a twin to that occupy- 
ing the black triangles. So far as the central parts of the layer are 
concerned, it will make no difference in which of these ways the mole- 
cules are packed. It is only at the edges that the surface tension will 
be affected. If the form growing be a rhombohedron, a succession of 
alternating twins will produce a series of alternating ridges and fur- 
rows in the rhombohedral faces, which will give rise to increased sur- 
face tension, which will tend to i^revent the twinning. On the other 
hand, a hexagonal form and its twin, formed in the way indicated, are 
identical, and we have in this faet a cause tending to the production of 
hexagonal forms. This tendency is increased by the fact that, for a 
given volume, the total surface of the hexagonal forms is in general 
less than that of the rhombohedral. Indeed, such forms lend them' 
selves to the formation of almost globular crystals, as is well seen in 
pyromorphite and mimetite. 

If the spheroids be arranged with their axes in other positions than 
those we have been discussing, or if the molecules occupy ellipsoidal 
spaces, they will, when packed so that each is touched by twelve oth- 
ers, give figures of less symmetry. The results may be worked out on 
the lines indicated in the foregoing discussion, and will be found to 
correspond throughout to the observed facts. 

Bravais long ago proposed various arrangements of nudecules to 
account for crystalline forms, and Sohncke has extended them to 
further degrees of complication in order to account for additional facts 
in crystallography. But neither of them has given any reason why 
the molecules should assume such arrangements. To me it seems that 
only one arrangement can be spontaneously assumed by the molecules, 
and that the varieties of crystalline form depend on the dimensions of 
the ellipsoids and the orientation of their axes. Curie also has indi- 
cated that the development of combined forms, as those of cube and 
octahedron, will depend on the surface tensions in the faces of these 
forms, but he has not indicated how the surface tension is connected 
with the crystalline arrangement, or why the energy of a^ cubic face 
should be greater or less than that of an octahedral face. 

We are now in a position to understand the interesting facts brought 
forward by Prof. Judd in a discourse delivered at the Eoyal Institution 
early this year. However long a crystal has been out of the solution 
or vapor from which it was formed, its gurface tension will remain 
unaltered, and when it is replaced it Avill grow exactly as if it had not 
been removed. Also, if any part be broken off it, the tension of the 
broken surface will, if it be not a cleavage face, be greater than on a 
face of the crystal, and in growing, the laws of energy necessarily cause 
it to grow in such a way as to reduce the potential energy — that is, to 
replace the broken surface by the regular planes of less surface energy. 
The formation of "negative crystals" by fusing a portion in the interior 
of a crystalline mass is due to the same principle. Surfaces of least 



CRYSTALLIZATION. 279 

energy will be most easily produced inside as well as outside, and in a 
crystalline mass of course they will be parallel to the external faces of 
the crystal. We see the same thing in the action of solvents. Most 
metals assume a crystalline texture on cooling- from fusion, and when 
slowly acted on by dilute acids the surfaces of greater energy are most 
easily attacked, in accordance with the laws of energy, and the uiulis- 
solved metal is left with surfa(;es of least energy which are the faces of 
crystals. This is easily seen on treating a piece of tin plate or of gal- 
vanized iron with very dilute a(iua regia. In fact, solution is closely 
connected with surface energy. It is probably the low surface energy 
of one form of crystals of sulphur which makes them insoluble in car- 
bon disulphide, and this low" surface energy may be an electrical effect. 
I pointed out that the develoi)m('nt of all the faces of a form and the 
similar moditicationof all corresponding edges and angles of a crystal are 
in general necessary in order to juoducc equilibrium under the surface 
tensions. But avc sometimes lind crystals with only half the modilica- 
tions required for symmetry. In such cases the surface tensions nnist 
l)roduce a stress in the interior tending to deform the molecules. When 
the ciystal was growing there must have been equilibrium, and there- 
fore a pressure equal and op])osite to this effect of the surface tension. 
There are various ways iu which we nuiy sui)pose that such a force 
would arise. The electric field might give rise to a stress in op})osition 
to the aggregati<m of the molecules in the closest possible way, and 
then the crystal would grow such faces as would produce an equal and 
opi)osite stress. Inequalities of temperature or the presence of mole- 
cules of other kinds amongst those of the crystal might produce similar 
results. When the stress due to electricity or to temperature was 
removed by change of circumstances, that due to the surface tensions 
would pL'rsist, and the crystal would be left with an internal strain. 
Crystals of this .sort, with unsymmetric faces, generally betray the 
internal strain either by developing electricity of oi)posite kinds at the 
two ends when heated or cooled, or they affect polarized light, rotat- 
ing the plane of polarization. That these effects are due to the internal 
strain is shown l>v the fact that tourmalines and other ciystals which 
are pyro-electric when unsymmetrical sbownosu(;h i)roperty when sym- 
metrically grown. Also sodium chlorafe in solution, (piartz w hen fused, 
and so on, lose theii' rotatory power. Substances which in solution show 
rotatory power as a rule de\'clop unsymmetric crystals. This is well 
seen in the tartrates. The constitution of the molecules must l)e such 
that they will not with(»ut some strain form crystals; and e(iuilil)rium 
when t])e crystal is growing is attained by means of theoi)])osing stress 
due to want of syinmetiy in the surf;;ce tensions. In all such crystals

distorted so as to gi^'e in a convergent beam of polarized light elliptical 
rings and two eyes like a biaxial crystal. 



THE KEJUVENESCENCE ()E (HrVSTALS.* 



By Prof, John W. Jidd, F. M. S, 



Very soon after tlie invention of tlie niicrosoo])e tlie value of that in 
strnuieiit in investigating tlie i)lieiionu'na of crystallization began to be 
recognized. 

The study of crystal morphology and crystallo-genesis was initiated 
in this country by the observations of Robert Boyle; and siuee his day 
a host of investigators — among whom may be especially mentioned 
Leenwenhoek and Vogelsang in Holland, Link and Frankenheim in 
Germany, and Pasteur and kSeuarmont in France — have added largely 
to our knowledge of the origin and development of crystalline struc- 
tures. Nor can it be said with justice that this field of investigation, 
opened up by English pioneers, has been ignobly abandoned to others, 
for the credit of British science has been fully maintained by the nu- 
merous and brilliant discoveries in this department of knowledge by 
Brewster and Sorby. 

There is no branch of science which is more dependent for its prog- 
ress on a knowledge of the phenomena of crystallization than geology. 
In seeking to explain tlie complicated phenomena exhibited by the crys- 
talline masses composing the earth's (;rust, the geologist is constantly 
compelled to appeal to the physicist and chemist; from them alone can 
he hope to obtain tht; light of experiment and the leading of analogy 
wher(?by he may hope to solve the ])rol)lems which confront him. 

J>ut if geology owes much to the researches of those physicists and 
chemists who have devoted their studies to the i)li('nomena of crystalli- 
zation, the debt has been more than re[)ai(l through the new light 
which has been thrown on these (questions by the in\-estigations of nat- 
urally formed crystals by mineralogists and geologists. 

In no class of physical oi»erations is time such an important factor as 
in crystallization, and Xature, in in'oducing her inimitable exam]>les of 
crystalline bodies, has been unsi)aring in her expenditure of time. 
Hence it is not surprising to find that some of the most wonderful i)he- 
nomeua of crystallization can best be studied — some indeed can only 
be studied — in those exquisite specimens of Nature's handiwork which

282 THE REJUVENESCENCE OF CRYSTALS. 

have been slowly elaborated by her during periods which must be 
measured in millions of years. 

I propose to-night to direct your attention to a very curious case in 
which a strikingly complicated group of phenomena is presented in a 
crystalline mass, and these phenomena, which have been revealed to 
the student of natural crystals, are of such a kind that we can scarcely 
hope to re -produce them in our test-tubes and crucibles. 

But if we can not expect to imitate all the effects which have in this 
case been slowly wrought out in Nature's laboratory, we can at least 
investigate and analyze them, and, in this way, it may be possible to 
show that phenomena like those in qTiestion must result from the pos- 
session by crystals of certain deflTute properties. Each of these prop- 
erties, we shall see, may be severally illustrated and experimentally in- 
vestigated, not only in natural products, but in the artificially formed 
crystals of our laboratories. 

In order to lead up to the explanation of the curious phenomena ex- 
hibited by the rock-mass in question, the first property of crystals to 
which I have to refer may be enunciated as follows: 

Crystals i)ossess the power of resuming their growth after interrup- 
tion, and there appears to be no limit to the time after which this re- 
sumption of growth may take place. 

It is a iamiliar ol)servation that if a crystal be taken from a solution 
and put aside it will, if restored after a longer or shorter interval to the 
same or a similar solution, continue to increase as before. But geology 
affords innumerable instances in which this renewal of growth in crys- 
tals has taken place after millions of years must have elapsed. Still 
more curious is the fact, of which abundant proof can be given, that a 
crystal formed by one method may, after a prolonged interval, continue 
its growth under totally different conditions and by a very different 
method. Thus, crystals of (quartz, which have clearly been formed in a 
molten magma and certain inclosures of glass, may continue their 
growth when brought in contact with solutions of silica at ordinary 
temperatures. In the same way, crystals of feldspar, which have been 
formed in a mass of incandescent lava, may increase in size when sol- 
vent agents bring to them the necessary materials from an enveloping 
mass of glass, even after the whole mass has become cold and solid. 

It is this power of resuming growth after interrnption which leads 
to the formation of zoned crystals, like the fine specimen of amethyst 
nclosed in colorless quartz, which was presented to the Eoyal Institu- 
tion seventy years ago by Mr. Snodgrass. 

The groAvth of crystals, like that of plants and animals, is determined 
by their environment, the chief conditions affecting tlieir development 
being temperature, rate of growth, the supply of materials (which may 
vary in quality as well as in quantity), and the presence of certain 
foreign bodies. 

It is a very curious circumstance that the form assumed by a crystal 



THE REJUVENESCENCE OF CRYSTALS. 283 

may be eoinplctely altered by tlie ]>reseiicc of inluiitesinuil traces of 
certain foreign substances — foreign sitbstauces, be it remarked, wliicli 
do not enter in any way into tlie conipositioii of the crystallizing mass. 
Thus there are certain crystals which can only be formed in the pres- 
ence of water, fluorides, or other salts. Such foreign bodies, which 
exercise an influence on a crystallizing substance without entering 
into its composition, have been called by the French geologists "miner- 
alizers." Their action seems to curiously resemble that of diastase 
and of the bodies known to chemists as "ferments," so many of which 
are now proved to be of organic origin. 

Studied according to their mode of fornmti<m, zoned crystals fall 
naturally into several difl'erent classes. 

In the first place, we have the cases in which the successive shells 
or zones ditter only in color or some other accidental character. Some- 
tinu's such ditterently colored shells of the crystal are sharply cut off 
from one another, while in other instances they graduate impercei)tibly 
one into the other. 

A secoml class of zoned crystals includes those in which we find 
clear evidence that there have been pauses, or at all events changes 
in the rate of their growth. The interruption in growth nuiy be indi- 
cated in several difterent ways. One of the commonest of these is the 
formation of cavities filled with gaseous, liquid, or vitreous material, 
according to the way the crystal has been formed, by volatilization, 
by solution, or by fusion, the production of these cavities indicating 
lapid or irregular growth. ISTot unfrequently is it clear that the 
crystal, after growing to a certain size, has been corroded or partially 
resorbed in the mass in whi(;h it is being formed, before its increase 
was resumed. In other cases, a pause in the growth of the crystal is 
indicated by the formation of minute foreign crystals or the depo- 
sition of uncrystallized material along certain zonal planes in the 
crystal. 

Some very intei-esting varieties of minerals, like the C'otterite of 
Ireland, the red <|uartz of Cumberland, and the spotted amethyst 
of Lake Sui)erior, can be shown to owe their i)eculiarities to thin bands 
of foreign matter zonally included in tliem during theii- giowth. 

A curious class of zoned crystals arises wlien there is a change in 
the habit of the crystal during its growth. Thus, as Levalle showed 
in IS'A {Bull. Gt-ol. Hoc. Paris, 2""\ ser., vol. Yiii, pp. G10-i;>), if an 
octahedron of alum be allowed to grow to a certain size in a solution 
of that substance, and then a (|nantity of alkaline carbonate be added 
to the liquid, the octaliedral crystal, without change in the length of 
its axes, will be gradually transformed into a cube. In the same way, 
a sealenohedrou of calcitc maybi' found inclosed in a prismatic crystal 
of the same mineral, the lengths of the vertical axes being the same in 
both crystals. 

By far the most numerous and iiiq)i)rtant class of zoned crystals is 



284 THE REJUVENESCENCE OF CRYSTALS. 

that which includes the forms where the successive zoues are of differ- 
ent, though analogous, chemical composition. In the case of the alums 
and garnets, we may have various isomorphous compounds forming 
the successive zones in the same crystal; while, in substances crystal- 
lizing in other systems than the cubic, we hnd plesiomorphous com- 
pounds forming the different inclosing shells. 

Such cases are illustrated by many artificial crystals aud by the 
tourmalines, the epidotes, and the feldspars among minerals. The zones, 
consisting of different materials, are sometimes separated by well 
marked planes, but in other cases they shade imperceptibly into one 
another. 

In connection with this subject it may be well to point out that 
zoned crystals may be formed of two substances which do not crystal- 
lize in the same system. Tlius, crystals of the monoclinic augite may 
be found surrounded by a zone of the rhombic enstatite and crystals 
of a triclinic felspar may be fouiul enlarged by a monoclinic feldspar. 

Still more curious is the fact that, where there is a similarity in crys- 
talline form and an approximation in the dominant angles (plesiomor- 
phisni), we may have zoning and intergrowth in the crystals of sub- 
stances which possess no chemical analogy whatever. Thus, as Senar- 
mont showed in 1856, a cleavage-rhomb of the uatural calcic carbonate 
(calcite), when placed in a solution of the sodic nitrate, becomes en- 
veloped in a zone of this latter substance, and Tschermak has proved 
that the compound crystal thus formed behaves like a homogeneous 
one, if tested by its cleavage, by its susceptibility to twin lamellation, 
or by the figures produced by etching. In the same way, zircons, which 
are composed of the two oxides of silicon aiul zirconium, are found 
grown in composite crystals with xenotime, a phosphate of the metals 
of the cerium and yttrium groups. 

These facts, and many similar ones wliich might be adduced, point 
to the conclusion that the beautiful theory of isomorphism, as originally 
propounded by Mitscherlich, stands in need of much revision as to many 
important details, if not indeed of complete reconstruction, in the light 
of modern observation and experiment. 

The second property of crystals to which I must direct your attention 
is the following: 

If a crystal be broken or nuitilated in any way whatever, it possesses 
the power of repairing its injnries during subsequent growth. 

As long ago as 1830, Frankenheim showed that, if a drop of a sat- 
urated solution be allowed to evaporate on the stage of a microscope, 
the following interesting observations may be made upon the growing 
crystals. When they are broken up by a rod, eacli fragment tends to re- 
form as a perfect crystal; and if the crystals be cansed to be partially 
re-dissolved by the addition of a minute drop of the mother liquor, 
further exaporation causes them to resume their original development 
{Pogg. Ann., 1830, Bd. xxxvii). 



THE REJUVENESCENCE OF CRYSTALS. 285 

III 1S42, Hennaiiii Jordan sliowed that crystals taken from a sohitiou 
and nintilatctl uradually IxH-anie repaired or healed when rei»laee(l in 
the solution (MiiUrr Arrhir. fiir 1842, pp. 40-.j(!). rFordan's observa- 
tions, which were published in a medical journal, do not however seem 
to have attracted much attention from the ]>hysicists and ciieinists of 
the day. 

Lavalle, between the years l.S.K) und IS.jS,* and Kop]), in the year 
185.^, made a number of valuable observations bearing' on tliis interest- 
iuii' pr()i)erty of crystals ( Liebig Ann., 1855, XCIV., pp. 118-25). In ^S'^i} 
the subject was more thoroug-hly studied by three investigators who 
])nblished their results almost simnltaneously; these were ^rarbach 
{('oinpt. rcnd.^ 185G, XLiir, pp. 7(»5-7(>(;, 8(H)-8()2), Pasteur {ib'uL, pp. 795- 
800), and Senarmont (/7>/^/., p. 7!)!)). They showed that crystals, taken 
from a solution and mutilated in various ways, upon being- restored to 
the liquid became comi)letely repaired during subsequent growth. 

As long ago as 1851, Lavalle had asserted that, when one solid angle 
of au octaliedrou of alum is removed, the crystal tends to reproduce 
the same mutilation on the oi)posite angle when its growth is resumed! 
This remarkable and anomalous result has however by some subse- 
quent writers been exi)lained in another way to that suggested by the 
author of the experiment. 

In the same way the curious experiments performed at a subsequent 
date by Karl von Ilauer, ex])eriments which led him to conclude that 
hemihedrism and other peculiarities in crystal growth might be induced 
by mutilation,! have been asserted by other physicists and chemists 
not to Justify the startling conclusions drawn from them at the time. 
It must be admitted that new experiments bearing on this interesting 
(pu'stion are at the present time greatly needed. 

In 1881, Loir demonstrated two very important facts with reg'ard to 
growing crystals of alum {(Jonipf. rend., lid. xcii, p. ll()(>). First, that 
if the iujuries in such a crystal be not too deep, it does not resume 
growth over its general surface until those injuries hav'ebeen repaired. 
Secondly, that the injured surfaces of crystals groAV more rapidly than 
natural faces. This was proved by placing artificially cut octahedra 
and natural crystals of the same size in a solution and comparing their 
weight after a certain time had elapsed. 

The important results of this capacity of crystals for undergoing- 
healing and enlargement and their ap})lication to the explanation of 
interesting geological phcnoincna have been pointcMl out by many au-

286 THE REJUVENESCENCE OF CRYSTALS. 

thors. Sorby lias sliown that, iu the so-called crystalline sand gfrains, 
we have broken and worn crystals of quartz, which, after many vicis- 
situdes and the lapse of millions of years, have grown again and been 
enveloped in a newly formed quartz crystal. Bonney has shown how 
the same phenomena are exhibited in the case of mica, Becke and 
Whitman Cross in the case of hornblende, and Merrill in the c-ise of 
augite. In the feldsi)ars of certain rocks it has been proved that crystals 
that have been rounded, cracked, corroded, and internally altered — 
which have, in short, suffered both mechanical and chemical injuries — 
may be repaired and enlarged with material that differs considerably 
in chemical composition from the original crystal. 

It is impossible to avoid a comparison between these phenomena of 
the inorganic world and those so familiar to tlie biologist. It is only 
iu the lowest forms of animal life that we find an unlimited jwwer of 
repairing injuries: in the lihizopods and some other groups a small 
fragment may grow into a perfect organism. In plants the same phe- 
nomenon is exhibited much more commonly, and in forms belonging to 
groups high up in the vegetable series. Thus, parts of a plant, such 
as buds, bulbs, slips, and grafts, may — sometimes after a long inter- 
val — be made to grow up into new and perfect individuals. But in 
the mineral kingdom we find the same principle carried to a much 
further extent. We know in fact no limit to the minuteness of frag- 
ments which may, under favourable conditions, grow into i^erfect crys- 
tals, no bounds as to the time during which the crystalline growth 
may be suspended in the case of any particular individual. 

The next proj)erty of crystals which I must illustrate, in order to 
explain the i)articular case to which I am calling your attention to 
night, is the following: 

Two crystals of totally different substances may be developed within 
the space bounded by certain planes, becoming almost inextricably 
inter-grow^n, though each retains its distinct individuality. 

This property is a consequence of the fact that the substance of a 
crystal is not necessarily continuous within the space inclosed by its 
bounding planes. Crystals often exhibit cavities filled with air and 
other foreign substances. In the calcite crystals found in the Fon- 
tainebleau sandstone, less than 40 per cent of their mass consists of 
calcic carbonate, while more than (>0 per cent is made up of grains of 
quartz sand, caught uj) during .vystallization. 

In the rock called "graphic granite," we have the minerals orthoclase 
and quartz intergrown in such a way that the more or less isolated 
parts of each can be shown, by their optical characters, to be parts of 
great mutually interpenetrant crystals. Similar relations are shown in 
the so-called micrographic or micro-pegmatic intergrowths of the same 
minerals which are so beautifully exhibited in the rock under our con- 
sideration this evening. 

There is still another property of crystals that must be kept in 



THE REJUVENESCENCE OF CRYSTALS. 287 

mind if we would explain tlie phenomena exhibited by this interest- 
ing rock : 

A crystal may undergo the most profound internal changes, and 
these may lead to great modifications of the optical and otlicr i>hys- 
ical i)rop(ntics of the mineral ; yet, so long as a small — often a very 
small — proportion of its molecules remain intact, the crystal may re- 
tain, not only its outward form, but its capacity for growing and re- 
pairing injuries. 

Crystals, like ourselves, grow old. Not only do they suffer from ex- 
ternal injuries, mechanical fractures, and chemical corrosion, but from 
actions wliich affect the whole of their internal structure. Under the 
influence of the great inessures in the earth's crust, the minerals of 
deep-seated rocks are completely permeated by fluids whicli cliemically 
react upon them. In this way, negative crystals are formed in their 
substance (similar to the beautiful '' ice-flowers" which are formed when 
a block of ice is traversed by a beam from the sun or an electric lamj)), 
and these become filled with secondary products. As the result of this 
action, minerals, once perfectly clear and translucent, have acquired 
cloudy, opalescent, iridescent, avanturine, and "schiller" characters; 
and minerals, thus modified, abounded in the rocks that have at any 
period of tlieir history been deep-seated. As the destruction of their 
internal structure goes on, the crystals gradually lose more and more 
of their distinctive optical and their physical properties, retaining how- 
ever their external form, till at last, when the last of the original 
molecules is transformed or replaced by others, they pass into those 
mineral corpses known to us as "pseudoniorphs." 

But while crystals resemble ourselves in "growing old," and, at last, 
undergoing dissolution, tliey exhibit the remarkable power of growing- 
young again, which we, alas! never do. This is in consequence of the 
following remarkable attribute of crystalline structures. 

It does not matter how far internal change and disintegration may 
have gone on in a crystal; if only a certain small ])roportion of the 
unaltered molecules lemain, the crystal may renew its ycmth and re- 
sume its growth. 

When old and much altered crystals begin to grow again, the newly 
formed material exhibits none of those marks of "senility'' to whicli I 
have refeired. The sand grains that have been battered and worn into 
microscopic pebbles and have been rendered cloudy by the development 
of millions of secondary fluid cavities may have clear and fresh (piartz 
deposited upon them to form crystals with exquisitely perfect faces 
and angles. The white, (jlouded, and altered felds]»ar crystals nuiy be 
enveloped by a zone of clear and transparent material, which has been 
added millions of years after the first formation and the snbseiiuent 
alteration of the original crystal. 

We are now in jiosition to explain the ])articnlar case which I have 
thought of sufficient interest to claim your attention to-night. 



288 THE REJUVENESCENCE OF CRYSTALS. 

In tlie Island of Mull, in the Inner Hebrides, there exist masses of 
granite of Tertiary age, whick are of very great interest to the geol- 
ogist and mineralogist. In many places this granite exhibits beau- 
tiful illustrations of the curious inter- growths of quartz and feldspar, of 
which I have already spoken. Such parts of the rock often abound 
with cavities (druses), which I believe are not of original, but of sec 
ondary origin. At all events, it can be shown that these cavities have 
been localities in which crystal growth has gone on; they constitute in- 
deed veritable laboratories of synthetic mineralogy. 

Now, in such cavities the inter-penetrantcrystals of quartz and feldspar 
in this rock have found a space where they may grow and complete their 
outward form; and it is curious to see how sometimes the quartz has 
prevailed over the feldspar and a pure quartz crystal has been produced, 
while at other times the opposite effect has resulted and a pure feldspar 
individual has grown up. In these last cases, however much the orig- 
inal feldspar may have been altered (kaolinized and reiulered opaque), 
it is found to be completed by a zone of absolutely clear and unaltered 
feldspar substance. The result is that the cavities of the granite are 
lined with a series of projecting crystals of fresh quartz and clear feld- 
spar, the relations of which to the older materials in an altered condition, 
composing the substance of the solid rock, are worthy of the most care- 
ful observation and reflection. 

Those relations can be fully made out when thin sections of the rock 
are examined under the microscope by the aid of polarized light, and 
they speak elociuently of the possession by the crystals of all those 
curious peculiarities of which I have reminded you tins evening. 

By problems such as those which we have endeavoured to solve to- 
night, the geologist is beset at every step. The crust of our globe is 
built up of crystals and crystal fragments — of crystals in every stage of 
development, of growth, and of variation — of crystals undergoing change, 
decay, and dissolution. Hence the study of the natural history of crys- 
tals must always constitute one of the main foundations of geological 
science, and the future progress of that science must depend on how 
far the experiments carried on in laboratories can be made to illustrate 
and explain our observations in the field. 



DEDUCTION FKOM THE GASEOCS THEORY OF SOLUTION.* 



BY PROF. ORME ^lASSON. 



Before passing on, let me briefly recnpitnlate the chief points in 
Yau't Hoff's g'aseous theory of solution and the experimental laws on 
T\liich it is based. 

(1) In every simple solution the dissolved substance amy be re- 
garded as distributed thioughout the whole bulk of the solution. Its 
total volume is therefore that of the solution, the solvent playing the 
part of so much space; and its specitic volume is the volume of that 
quantity of the solution whicli contains I gram of the substance. To 
avoid confusion, it is best to s})eak ol" this as tiu' specific solution 
volume {v) of tin' substance. It is obviously in inverse ratio to tiie 
concentration. 

(2) In every simi»le solution the dissolved sul»stance exerts ;i (h'fiuife 
osmotic pi'es.siirc {p). This is normally independent of the nature of 
the solvent. It varies iuvorsely as the si)ecific solution volume (<u' di- 
rectly as the concentration), and directly as the absolute t<'mt)erafur(^ 
(T). We ma>' then write for solutions, as we do for gases, tliee(|uation

for dissolved matter in all cinaimstances. J)issociation often occurs, 
as it may occur in the process of vapcuization, thus causing a])i)arent 
exceptions, but apart from this there are and must be variations from

290 DEDUCTION FROM THE GASEOUS THEORY OF SOLUTION. 

the laws iu the case of solutions of great conceutiation, just as tliere 
are in the case of gases aud vapors of great concentration — for in- 
stance, in the neighborhood of the critical point. 

T wish now to ask your attention more particularly to the actual 
process of dissolving, and then to lay before you a hypothesis, which, 
as it seems to me, is a logical consequence of the general tlieory. 

Imagine, then, a soluble solid in contact with water at a. fixed tern- 1 
perature. The substance exercises a certain pressure, in right of which 
it proceeds to dissolve. This liressure is analogous to the vapor pres- 
sure of a volatile body in si^ace, the sjiace being represented by the 
solvent; and the process of solution is analogous to that of vaporiza- 
tion. As the concentration increases, the osmotic i)ressure of the dis- 
solved portion increases, and tends to become equal to that of the un- 
dissolved portion; just as, during vaporization in a closed space, the 
pressure of the accumulating vapor tends to become equal to the 
vapor pressure of the liquid. But if there be enough water present, 
the whole of the solid will go into solution, just as the Avhole of a vola- 
tile body will volatilize if the available space be sufficient. Such a 
solution may be exactly saturated or unsaturated. With excess of the 
solvent it will be unsaturated, and the dissolved matter will then be 
in a state comparable to that of an unsaturated vapor, for its osmotic 
pressure will be less than the possible maximum corresponding to the 
temperature. On the other hand, if there be not excess of water pres- 
ent during the process of solution, a condition of equilibrium aaIII be 
arrived at when the osmotic pressure of the dissolved portion becomes 
equal to the x)ressure of the undissolved portion, just as equilibrium 
will be established between the volatile substance and its vapor if tlie 
space be insufficient for complete volatilization. In such a case we get 
a saturated solution in presence of undissolved solid, just as we nmy 
have a saturated vapor in presence of its own liquid or solid. 

So far we have supposed the temi^erature to be stationary, but it 
may be raised. Now, a rise of temperature will disturb equilibrium in 
either case alike, for osmotic pressure and vapor i)ressure are both 
increased by this means, and a re-establishment of equilibrium neces- 
sitates increased solution or vaporization, as the case may be. 

Now, what will this constantly increasing solubility with rise of tem- 
perature eventually lead to? Will it lead to a maximum of solubility 
at some definite temperature beyond which increase becomes impos- 
sible? Or will it go on in the way it has begun, so that there will 
always be a definite, though it may be a very great, solubility for every 
definite temperature? Or will it lead to infinite solubility before in- 
finite temperature is obtained! One or other of these things must 
happen, provided of course that chemical change does not intervene.

reach a t('iii])oratuio at which it becomes iiitiiiitely vohitile — a tem- 
perature above wiiieli the liquid can iu>t possibly exist in the i^reseiu-e 
of its own vai>or, no matter how great the pressure may be. At this 
temperature. (Minilibrium of pressure between the liquid and its vapor 
becomes impossibh^, and above this ])oiut the substance can exist only 
as a gas. This is the critical temperature. And so it seems to me 
that if we cany our analogy to its logical conclusion, we may expect 
for ex'ery substance and its solvent a detinite tem})erature above which 
equilibrium of osmotic ])ressure between undissolved and dissolved 
substance is imi)ossible — a temperature above which the substance 
can not exist in i)resence of its own solution, or in other words a 
temperature of intinite vsolubility. This may be spoken of as the crit- 
ical solution temperature. 

But a little consideration shows that in one particular we have been 
somewhat inexact in the pursuance of our analogy, for we have com- 
pared the solution of a solid body to the vaporization of a volatile liquid. 
We can however do better than this, for volatile solid bodies are, 
not Avanting. It is to these, then, that we must look in the iirst in- 
stance. Xow, a volatile solid (such as (*am[)hor or iodine) will not 
reach its critical point without having .Hrst melted at some lower tem- 
perature, and a .similar change should be exhibited in the solution 
process. At some delinite temperature, below that of infinite solubil- 
ity, we may expect the solid to melt. This solution melting point will 
iu>t be identical with, but lower than, the true melting point of the 
solid, and for the following reason: Xo case is known, and probably 
no case exists, of two li(fuids one of which dissolves in the other and yet 
can not dissolve any of it in reliirn. Therefore there will b(> formed by 
melting, not the j)ure liquid substance, but a. solution of tlie solvent in 
the liquid substanc(\ Hence the actual nndting or freezing point 
must be lower than the true one, in right of the laws of which I have 
sp(>ken when discussing Haoult's nu'thods in the earlier part of this 
address. 

From this solution melting-point ui)wards we shall then have to deal 
with two liquid layers, each containing both substance A and solv<'nt 
7>, but the one being mostly substance .1 and the other mostly solvent 
B. These may be spoken of as the A layer and tlie B layer. As temper- 
ature rises, the proportion of A will decrease in the A layer and increastr 
in the /Mayer; ami every gram of A will occupy an increasing sola 
tion volume in the A layer (7> being absorbed there) and a decreasing 
solution volume in the B layer. At each temperature the osmotic pres- 
sures of .1 in Uw two layers must be equal. The whole course of affairs, 
as thus concei\ed, now admits of the closest comparison with the 
changes wliich acciunpany gradual rise of temperature in the case of a 
volatile liquid and its saturated vapor. Tlie liquid is like the substanc(i 
A in the .1 layer; the vapor (which is the same matter in :inother 
state) is like the same substance A iu the B layer. As temperature 



292 DEDUCTION FROM THE GASEOUS THEORY OF SOLUTION. 

rises tlie liquid diminishes in total quantity, tlie vapor increasing; but 
the specific volume of the liquid increases, while that of the vapor de- 
creases. The residual liquid is, in fact, constantly encroaching on the 
space of its vapor, just as the residual substance A in the A layer is 
constantly absorbing the solvent B from the B layer. Finally, in either 
case, the specific volume of the substance will become identical in both 
layers, which means that the layers themselves will become homogene- 
ous and indistinguishable. Our system will then have reached' its 
critical temperature — the temperature of infinite volatility in the one 
case and of infinite solubility in the other. 

So much for hypothesis. Are there any facts in support of it? Well, 
in the first place the hypothesis demands that (in the absence of chem- 
ical change) increase of solubility with rise of temperature shall be as 
genera] a law as increase of vapor pressure, and we find that this agrees 
with the known facts, more especially since Tilden and Shenstone {Phil. 
Trans., 1884) cleared up certain doubtful cases. Secondly, the hypothesis 
seems to demand some connection between the true melting points of 
salts and the rates of their increase of solubility; and such a relation 
has in a general way been established by the same observers. Thirdly, 
we have the fact, in complete accordance with the hypothesis, that while 
no case is known of a solid body having, as such, infinite solubility in 
any simple solvent, several cases are knowai of liquids of infinite solu- 
bility, and also of solids which, after they have melted in presence of 
their own solution, become at some higher temperature infinitely soluble. 
This last statement refers to the cases described by Alexeeft" ( ^Vicde- 
maiui's Annalen, 1886), of which 1 must say a good deal more directly. 
It would seem to apply also to the case of silver nitrate, which Tilden 
and Shenstone described as dissolving in water to the extent of 18.25 
parts to one at so low a temperature as 130° C. The true melting-point 
of the salt is 217'^, and I have seen it stated (but have been unable to 
find the published account) that Shenstone has himself shown it to be 
fusible in water, and of infinite solubility at quite reachable temper- 
atures. 

With regard to substances that are liquid under ordinary conditions, 
we have the well-known fact that some pairs are infinitely soluble in 
one another, while others exhibit the phenomenon of only i)artial solu- 
bihty. The hypothesis would draw no hard and fast distinction 
between these cases, except the practically important one that such a. 
mixture as that of ether and alcohol, which belougsHo the first class, 
is usually above its critical solution point, while such a one as ether 
and water, which belongs to the second class, is usually below it. It 
should be possible, according to the hypothesis, to cool mixtures of 
ether and alcohol sufficiently to cause separation into two layers, simi- 
lar to those observed at the ordinary temperature in the case of ether 
and water; but I do not know that this has yet been put to the test of 
experiment.

])hen(>l, salicylic acid, benzoic acid, aniline phenylate, and aniline, and 
to solutions in molten stdphur of chlorobenzene, benzene, t(duene, 
aniline, and nuistard (»il. All these afford instances of reciprocal i)ar- 
tial solution throughout a considerable range of temperature, leading 
eventually at a detinite temperature to intinite solubility. Several of 
them afford instances also of solid substances with solution melting- 
points below their true melting-points. 

Alexeeff experimentally determined the tem])eratures at which dif 
terent mixtures of the same two liquids are just converted into clear 
soluticuis; or, in other words, he ascertained the strengths of the satu- 
rated solutions corresponding to different temperatures. For each 
])air of li(|uids he found that when a particular strength of mixtnre is 
reached, the temperature of saturation is lowered by furthei- addition 
of either liquid. Thus a mixture of about 37 parts aniline to (m parts 
water requires a temperature of 1640-5 to convert it into a homoge- 
necais solution: but one of 21 of aniline to 79 of w^ater assumes this

of the two iugredients is nu accident wliicli does not characterize all 
cases. 

IsTow imagine a 50 jjer cent mixtare of aniline and water sealed up 
in a tube, shaken, and gradually heated. Let us assume that the tube 
is only large enough to contain the mixture and allow of expansion by 
heat, so that evaporation may be neglected as too small to matei-ially 
compli(;ate the result. The course of events will be exactly what I 
have already described with reference to the hypothetical A layer and 
B layer. There will be formed a saturated solution of water in aniline, 
which we may call tlie aniline layer, and a saturated solution of aniline 
in water — the water layer. Given the temperature, the percentage 
strength of each layer may be read oft' from the curve. As the tem- 
perature rises, the two layers will effect exchanges in such a way that 
the aniline layer will become poorer aiul the water layer richer in 
aniline, and at about 167° the two layers will have attained equal 
strength and become merged into one. Were we to start Avith the 
aniline and water in any other proportions by weight, there would 
still be formed the two saturated solutions, but their relative amounts 
would be different, and one or other would be used up and disappear 
at a lower temperature than 167°. To attain the maximum tempera- 
ture of complete solution, you must start with the exact proportions 
which correspond to that temperature. 

But it is possible to learn even more from Alexeefif's work than he 
himself has made evident. Let me call yi»ur attention to the curve 
shown in Fig. 2*, the data for which I liuvr* calculated in the following 
manner.

pure aniline (the latter drawn from Thorpe's data, Trans, ('linn. A'or.,

obtained, there was calculated the total volume of that (piautity of the

the experimeiita] data of Iliimsay and Young {Phil. Tranf!., 1.S8G). The 
reason that ah-ohol was chosen is simi)ly that the data were convenient 
to my hand. 

The two curves are strikingly similar in form and signilicance. In 
Fig. 3 we see the specific volume of litjuid alcohol increasing slowly 
with rise of temperature, while that of the saturated vai)or rather 
rapidly decreases. In Fig. 2 we see the specific solution volume of the 
aniline in the aniline layer slowly increasing, while that of the aniline 
in the water layer decreases more rapidly, with rise of temperature* 
In Fig. 3 we see that above the critical i)oint the existence of li(iuid 
alcohol in i^resence of its vapor is imx)ossible. In Fig. 2 we see that 
above the critical solution point the existence of an analine layer in 
jn-esence of a water layer is impossible. In Fig. 3 we see an inclosed 
area Avhich represents those temperatui'cs and spe(;ihc volumes which 
are mutually incompatible. In Fig. 2 we see an inclosed area which 
represents those temperatures and specific solution volumes which are 
mutually incompatil^le. In Fig. 3 we see that any two points on the 
curve Avhich correspond to equal temperature must also, from the na- 
ture of the case, correspond to equal osmotic pressure. In Fig. 3 some 
of the ])ressures are indicated, as this can be d(me from Ramsay and 
Young's data. In Fig. 2 the value of the osmotic pressures can not be 
given, as they have not been experimentally determined. In Fig. 3 
any jjoint outside of the curve and to the right, as at a, corresi)onds 
to the state of unsaturated alcohol vapor, whose tem})erature, specific 
volume, and pressure are indicated — the last by the isobaric line 
which passes through the point. In Fig. 2 any point outside the curve 
and to the right, as at a, must correspond to the state of an unsatur- 
ated aqueous solution of aniline, whose temperature and specific solu- 
tion volume can be read, and whose osmotic pressure could be indi- 
cated by an isobaric line, had we the data for plotting it. A little 
thought makes it evident, too, that such isobaric lines would follow 
the same general course as those shown in the alcohol diagram. 

Now, consider what must be the effect of gradually decreasing the 
volume of the unsaturated vai>or in the one case and the solution 
volume of the aniline in the unsaturated solution in the other, while 
temperature is kei)t constant. In the case of the vapor (Fig. 3) the 
point a will pass to the left across lines of increasing pressure until 
the vapor becomes saturated at />. Then, if the diminution of volume 
continue, a portion of the vapor will condense to the liquid state, or 
be transferred to c, while the rest remains saturated vapor at b. With 
continued decrease of volume, the proportion condensed will con- 
stantly increase, but there can be no alteration of pressure till all is 
condensed; and after that nothing but a very slight diminution of 
volume is possible without a lowering of temperature. Well, how are 
we to diminish the solution volume of the anihne in the unsaturated 
aqueous solution ? Clearly by depriving the solution of some of its 



DEDUCTION FROM Tlfl'; GASEOUS THEORY OF SOLUTION. 297 

water, so as to leave the same (iiiantity of aniline distributed tlironj^li- 
out a smaller spai^e. And what will be the lesnlt of (l()in.ij;- this while 
temperature is kept ecnistant .' Evidently, as in the other case, the 
point a (Fig. -) will travel to the left, aeross lines of increasing 
osmotii! pressure, until it reaches h — that is, until the solution is a 
saturated one; and alter that, if more water be abstracted, some of 
the aniline will l)e thrown out or condeused, not as [)ure aniline but 
as a saturated solution of water in aniline, so that two layers will now 
coexist — the aniline in one- having the specitie solution volume repre- 
sented at />, and the aniline in the other having that r(;preseuted at c. 
This transference from h to c, will continue, as water is abstracted, until 
the ratio of residual water to aniline is Just enough to give the whole 
of the latter the specitie solution volume shown at c. At this stage 
the water layer will disap])ear, and only a saturated solution of water 
in aniline will be left; and after that only a very small volume change 
can possibly result from further abstraction of water, as the specific 
solution volume is already not far from the si)ecific volume of i)ure 
aniline itself at the same temi>erature. 

To complete the C:>mj)ai"isou of the two curves, let me jtoint out that, 
Just as we can from Fig, 3 calculate the distribution of alcohol between 
its li(|uid and its vapor layers under givesi conditions, so can we <'alcu- 
late from 1^'ig. 2 the distribution of the aniline between the aniline 
layer and tiie water layer under given conditions. In the former case, 
if the total volume of a tube containing ii grams of alcohol, at, say. 
230^, be )t X ./', and if .r be mai'ked olf (Fig. o) between h and c on the 
line of that temperature, then (.r, />, and c standing for the volumes

If the actual Aveights of aniline and water in the mixture be given, 
the value of x can be calculated with a very fair approach to accuracy

with regard to the <listribution at any tem[)eratur(^ can l)c obtained. 



298 DEDUCTION FROM THE GASEOUS THEORY OP SOLUTION. 

Now, if it be reQiembered that this case of aniline and water is not 
an isohited one, but typical of many cases experimented on by 
Alexeeff, and if it be remembered also that there exists no direct 
experimental evidence to show that the law which governs these cases 
is not the general law regulating all simple solutions it must I think 
be granted that the facts do somewhat strongly support the hypothesis 
of a critical solution point which I deduced in the first instance from 
the general theory of solution. It may be summed up as follows: 

(1) In every system of solution which starts with a solid and its 
simple solvent, the solid has a solution melting point which is lower 
than its true melting point. Above this temperature the system con- 
sists of two separate liquids, each of which is a saturated solution. 

(2 ) These two liquids become one homogeneous solution at a tem- 
perature which depends on the ratio of the original ingredients. 
There is one ratio which demands a higher temperature than any 
other. This is the critical solution temperature, above which either 
ingredient is infinitely soluble in the other.

The brilliant presidential address of Prof. Orme ]V[asson at the Chem- 
ical Seetum of the Anstrahisian Association for the Advancement of 
Science marks a distinct advance in onr ideas of solntiou. The analogy 
between the behavior of a, lie] aid and its vapor in presence of eacdi 
other and of a pair of solvents capable of mutual solution is so striking" 
as to carry conviction. The resemblance of the liipiid-vapor curve, 
with its apex at the critical i)oint, to the solubility curve, with its apex 
at the critical solution point, appears to me to prove beyond cavil that 
the two phenomena are essentially of the same nature. 

There are two other phenomena, which, it ai)])ears to me, are made 
clear by the ideas of Prof. Masson. The first of these has reference to 
supersaturated solutions. The curves (i)ublished in N'atKre, February 
iL', p. 348) showing the analogy l>etween liquid-gas and solution curves, 
are isobaiic curves, or, more correctly, they re[)resent the terminations 
of isobaric curves in the region of nuxtures, where, on the one hand, a 
liqui<l exists in i)resence of its vapoi-, and on the other, one solvent in 
the presence of another (for both solvents play the part of dissolved 
substances, as well as of sohents). M. Alexeeff's data are not sulh- 
cient to permit 'of the construction of a curve re]U'esentiug a similar 
region ma])ped out l)y the termination of isothermal lines. l>ut it is 
obvious that it would be ]K>ssible to determine osmotic pressun^s of 
various mixtures by the i'r«'ezing-i)oint m(;thod, and so to constru(*t 
isothermal curves for snch mixtures of solvents. And there can be no 
reasonable doubt that, as the isobaric curves of li(|ind-gas an<l of sol- 
vent-solvent display so close an analogy, the; isotherimd curvets would 
also closely resend)le each other. 

(J ranting then that this is the case, w(^ may c(mstruct an imaginary 
isotliermal curve on the model of the curve for alcohol ])u])lished in the 
ritil. Trans, by Dr. Sydney Young and myself. Now, in one series of 
papers on the liquid-gas relations, we showed that with constant volume

rei)rcsentiiig' the contimious transition from the gaseous to the licjuid 
state (see Fhil. Mag., 1887, vol. xxiii, p. 435). It would be interesting 
to ascertain whether, if concentration be kept constant, osnioti<' i)res- 
sure woiild also show itself to be a linear function of temperature. 
But this apart, it appears in the highest degree probable that there 
should also exist, in theory at least, a continuous transition from solvent 
to solvent, the representation of which would be a continuous curve. 
In such a case, on increasing the concentration of the solution by elimi- 
nating one solvent, the other solvent should not separate visibly, but 
the two should remain mixed until one solvent has been entirely re- 
moved. The accomi)anying diagram (Fig, 1) will make this clear. The

gas to liquid along an isothermal on decrease of volume, oi' it may 
represent a similar continuous change from saturated solution to dis- 
solved sul)stance on increase of concentration. 

.Mr. Aitken's experiments ou the cooling of air containing water- 
vapor have shown us that it is possible to realize a ]>ortion of tlui curve

what (M»nditions determine sucli unstable states with solvent and sol- 
vent. 

Kegarding the i)ortion of tlie curve A B, I think that no reasonable 
doubt can be entertained. It precisely corresponds to the condition of 
super-saturation. In the liquid-gas curve the volume is decreased at 
constant temperature without separation of liquid; in the solvent-sol- 
vent curve the concentration is increased witlumt separation of the 
solvents. Dr. Nicol has shown that it is possible to dissolve dry sodium 
sulphate in a saturated solution of sodium sulphate to a very consider-

one sees no reason why it should not l)e possible. 

I hav«! sonn> hesitation in offering;' speculations as to the state of 
matter at the ]>ortion of the continuous curve D E. It may be that it 
corresponds to a syrui)y or viscous state. Cane su^ar at the moderate 
temperature dissolves water; indeed it is possible to obtain a solution 
of 1 per cent of water in molten cane sugar. And such a solution, if 
quickly cooled, renuiins a syrup. But it can be induced to crystallize 
by the presence of crystals. Thus, in such a mixture of sugar and 
Avater a few grains of crystalline sugar cause the whole mass to crystal- 
lize, and water saturated with sugar, and sugar, separate into two layers. 
Here agaiis a complete analogy fails us, for it is a soli<l which separates. 
As Me know nothing of tlie osmotic [)ressure of a syrup, the analogy is 
a defecti\-e one: but it is piobable that a dilute solution of sugar would 
pass continuously into a syrup of pure sugar by evaporation of the sol- 
Acnt, and analogy would lead to i\w supi)osition that the syrup coin- 
cid(^s with the unstable state of the liquid. I would therefore offer the 
analogy between the syrujtpy and the super-cooled states as a tentative 
one; it lacks foundation in both cases.

LIQUIDS AND GASES.* 
By ]*r()f. William Ramsay, F. R. S. 



Almost exactly twenty years ago, on June 2, IcSTl, Dr. Andrews, of 
Belfast, delivered a lecture to the members of tlie Jfoyal Institution 
in this hall, on ^<The Continuity of the Gaseous and the Liquid States 
of Matter."'' lie showed in that lecture an experiment which 1 had best 
describe in liis own words: 

"Take, for exam]ile, a i;iven volume of carbonic acid at HOOC, or af 
a hijiher temperature, and expose it to increasing- i)ressure till 150 
atmosidicrcs have been reached. In the process, its vohini<' will steadily 
diminish as the pressure auji'ments; and no sudden dimunition of 
volume, without the application of external ])ressure, will occur at any 
stage of it. Wlien the full ])ressure has been applied, let tlie tempera- 
ture be allowed to fall, until the carl)onic acid has reached rlie ordinary 
temperature of the atmosphere. During the whole of this operation, 
no break of continuity has occurred. It begins with a gas, and by a 
series of gi-adual changes, presenting nowhere any abrupt alterations 
of volume, or sudden evolution of heat, it ends with a liquid. I^'or con- 
\<'nience, the i)rocess lias been devided into two stages — the compress- 
ion of the carbonic a('i<l, and its subsequent cooling. But these opera- 
tions might have been performed sinuiltaneously, if care Avere taken so 
to arrange the ap]»li<'ation of the pressure and the rate of cooling that 
the ju'essure should not be less than 70 atmospheres when the carbonic 
acid had cooled to-'HoC." 

1 am able, through the kindness of Dr. Letts, Dr. Andrews's succes- 
sor at Belfast, to show you this exi)erimcnt, with the identical piece of 
api»aratus used on the o(;casion of the lecture twenty years ago. 

1 must ask you to spend some time to-night in consideiing this 
remarkable behavior; and, in order to obtain a correct idea of what 
occurs, it is well to begin with the study of gases, not, as in the case 
you have just seen, exposed to high pressures, but under pressures not 
differing greatly from that of the atmosphere, an<l at tem])eratures 
M'hich can be exactlx' legulated and measure<l. To many here to-night, 
such a study is unnecessary, owing to its familiarity; but I will ask 
such of my audience to excuse me, in order that 1 may tell my story 
from the beginning.

304 LIQUIDS AND GASES. 

Generally speakiug, a gas, when compressed, decreases in volume 
to an amount erpial to tliat by wliicli its pressure is raised, provided 
its temperature be kept constant. This was discovered by Eobert 
Boyle in 1000; in 1001 he presented to the Eoyal Society a Latin trans- 
lation of his book, " Touching the Spring of the Air and its Effects." 
His words are : 

"It is evident, that as common air, when reduced to half its natural 
extent, obtained a spring about twice as forcible as it had before; so 
the air, being thus compressed, being further crowded into half this 
narrow room, obtained a spring as strong again as that it last had, and 
consequently four times as strong as that of common air." 

To illustrate this, and to show how such relations may be expressed 
by a curve, I will ask your attention to this model. We have a 
piston, fitting a long horizontal glass tube. It confines air under the 
pressure of the atmosphere — that is, some 15 pounds on each s(]uare 
inch of area of the x)iston. The pressure is supposed to be registered 
by the height of the liquid in the vertical tube. On increasing tlie 
volume of the air, so as to double it, the pressure is decreased to half 
its original amount. On decreasing the volume to half its original 
amount, the i)ressure is d^mbled. On again halving, the i)ressuie is 
again doubled. Tims you see a curve may be traced, in which the 
relation of V(»lume to pressure is exhibited. Such a curve, it may be 
remarked incidentally, is termed an hypeibola. 

We can repeat Boyle's experiment by pouring mercury into the open 
limb of tliis tube containing a measured amount of air; on causing 
the level of the mercury in the open limb to stand oO inches (that is, 
the height of the barometer) higher in the 0])en lind) than the closed 
limb, the pressure ot the atmosphere is doubled, and the volume is 
halved. And on trebling the pressure of the atmosphere the volume 
is reduced to one-third of its original amount; and on adding another 
30 inches of mercury, the volume of the air is now one-quarter of that 
which it originally occupietl. 

It must be remembered that here the temperature is kept constant; 
that it is the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere. 

Let us next examine the behavior of a gas when its temperature is 
altered, when it becomes hotter. T'his tube contains a gas— air— con- 
fined at atmospheric pressure by mercury, in a tube surrounded by a 
jacket or mantle of glass, and the vapor of boiling water can be blown 
into the space between the mantle and the tube containing the air, so as 
to heat the tube to 100° C, the temperature of the steam. The tempera- 
ture of the room is 17° C, and the gas occupies 290 divisions of the scale. 
On blowing in steam, the gas expands, and on again equalizing pres- 
sure, it stands at 373 divisions of the scale. The gas has thus expanded 
from 200 to 373 divisions, i. e., its volume has increased by 83 divisions; 
and the temi)erature has risen from 17° to 100c>, i. ^., through 83*^0. 
This law of the expansion of gases was discovered almost simultane- 



LIQUIDS AND GA8ES. 305 

ously by Dalton and (ray-Lussac in isoi; it usually ,i;oes by the uame 
of Gay-Lussac's law. Now, if we do not allow the volume of the gas to 
increase, we shall find that the pressnre Avill increase in the same pro- 
portion that the volume would have increased had the gas been allowed 
to expand, the i^ressnre having l)een kept constant. To decrease the 
volume of the gas, then, according to IJoyle's law, will require a higher 
initial pressure; and if we were to represent the results by a curve, 
we should get an hyperbola, as before, but one lying higher as regards 
pressures. And so we should get a set of hyperbolas for higher iiud 
higher temiieratures. 

We have experimented up to the present with air — a. mixture of two 
gases, oxygen and nitrogen ; and the boiling points of both of these ele- 
ments lie at very low temperatures: —184° C. and — r.l.i'^.l C, respect- 
ively. The ordinary atmospheric temi)erature lies a long way above the 
boiling points of li<piid oxygen and licpiid nitrogen at the ordiiuxry at- 
mospheric i^ressure. But it is oi)en to us to study a gas, which, at the 
ordinary atmospheric temperature and pressure, exists in th(^ liquid 
state; and for this purpose I shall choose \Aater gas. In order that it 
may be a gas at ordinary atmospheric pressure, however, we must h(;at 
it to a temperature above 100'^ C, its boiling point. This tube contains 
water gas at a temperature of lOoO C; it is under ordinary j>ressure, 
for the mercury columns are at the same level in both the tubes and 
in this reservoir, which communicates with the lower end of the tube 
by means of the india-rubber tubing. Tlie temperature 105° is main- 
tained by the vapor of chloro-benzene, boiling in the bulb sealed to the 
Jacket, at a j)ressure lower than that of the atmosphere. 

Let us now examine the effect of increasing pressure. On raising 
the reservoir tlie volume of the gas is diminished, as usual, and nearly 
in the ratio given by Boyle's law; that is, tlie volume decreases in the 
same proportion as the pressure increases. But a change is soon ob- 
served; the pressure soon ceases to rise; the distance between the 
mercury in the reservoir and that in the tube renniins constant, and 
the gas is now condensing to liquid. The pressure continues constant 
during this change, and it is only when all the water gas has condensed to 
liquid water that the pressure again rises. After all the gas is condensed 
an enormous increase of pressure is necessary to cause any measurable 
decrease in volume, for liquid water scarc'cly yields to pressure, and in 
such a tube as this no measurements could b(^ attempted with success- 

Kepresenting this diagrammatically, the right-hand ])art of the curve 
represents the compression of the gas, and the curve is, as before, 
nearly a hyperbola. Then comes a break, and great decrease in 
volume occurs without rise of pressure, represented l)y a horizontal 
line; the substance in the tube here consists of water gas in presence 
of water; the vertical, or nearly vertical line represents the sudden 
and great rise of pri^ssure, where li(iuid water is being slightly com- 
pressed. The ])ressure registered by the horizontal line is termed the 
II. Mis. lU 20 



306 LIQUIDS AND GASES. 

"vapor- pressure" of water. If now the temperature were raised to 
110° C, we should liave a greater initial volume for the water gas; it is 
compressible by rise of the mercury as before, the relation of pressure 
to volume being, as before, represented on the diagram as an approxi- 
mate hyperbola; and as before, condensation occurs when volume is 
suflBcieutly reduced, but this time at a higher pressure. AVe have 
again a horizontal portion, representing the pressure of water gas at 
110° 0. in contact with liijuid water; again, a sliarp angle where all 
gaseeus water is condensed, and again a very steep curve, almost a 
straight line, representing the slight decreases of volume of water pro- 
duced by a great increase of pressure. And we should have similar 
lines for 12()o, 130°, 140°, ir>Oo C, and for all temperatures within certain 
limits. kSuoh lines are called isothermal lines, or shortly "isothermals," 
or lines of equal temperature, and represent the relations of pressure 
to volume for different temperatures. 

Dr. Andrews made similar measurements of the relations between 
the pressures and volumes of carbon dioxide, at pressures much higher 
than tliose 1 ha^•e shown you for water. But I prefer to si^eak to you 
about similar results obtained by Prof. Sydney Young and myself with 
ether, because Dr. Aiulrews was unable to work with carbon dioxide 
free from air, and that influenced his results. For example, you see 
that the meeting points of his hyperbolic curves with the straight lines 
of vapor i^ressures are curves, and not angles; that is caused by the 
presence of about 1 part of air in 500 parts of carbon dioxide; also the 
condensation of gas was not perfect, for he obtained curves at the 
points of change from a mixture of liquid and gas to liquid. We 
however were more easily able to fill a tube with ether free from air, 
and you will notice that the points I have referred to are angles, not 
curves. 

Let me first direct your attention to the shapes of the curves in the 
diagram. As the temperature rises the vapor-pressure lines lie at 
higher and higher pressures, and the lines themselves become shorter 
and shorter. And finally, at the temperature of 31° C. for carbon di- 
oxide, and at 195° C. for ether, there ceases to be a horizontal portion 
at all; or rather the curve touches the horizontal at one point in its 
course. That point corresponds to a definite temperature, 195° C. for 
ether; to a definite pressure, 27 meters of mercury, or 35.0 atmos- 
pheres; and to a definite volume, 4.00 cubic centimeters per gram of 
ether. At that point the ether is not liquid, aud it is not gas; it is a 
homogeneous substance. At that temperature ether has the appear- 
ance of a blue mist; the striie mentioned by Dr. Andrews and by 
other observers are the result of unequal heating, one portion of the 
substance being liquid and another gas. You see the appearance of 
this state on the screen. 

^Vhen a gas is compressed it is heated. Work is done on the gas, 
and its temperature rises. If I compress the air in this syringe forci- 



LIQUIDS AND GASES. 307 

bly its teinperatiue rises so liigli that 1 can set a })iece of tinder on 
tire and by its help explode a little gunpowder. If the ether at its 
critical point be compressed by screwing^ in the screw, it is somewhat 
warmed and the blue cloud disapi)ears. Conversely, if it is expanded 
a little by unscrewing- the seicw and increasing its volume, it is cooled 
and a dense mist is seen, accompanied by a shower of ether rain- 
This is seen as a black log on the screen. 

I "wish also to direct your attention to wluit ha|)pens if the vohime 
given to the ethtn- is greater than the critical volume — on increasing 
the volume you see that it boils away and evaporates completely; and 
also what hajipens if the vobime be somewhat less than the critical 
volume — it then expainls as ]i(piid and completely tills the tube. It is 
only at the critical volume and temperature that the ether exists in the 
state of bbie ch)Tnl, and has its critical ])ressure. If the volume be 
too great, the juessure is below the critical pressure; if too small, the 
pressure is higher than the critical pressure. 

Still one more x^oii't betbre we dismiss this experiment. At a tem- 
perature some degrees below the critical temperature, the meniscus, 
/. c, the surface of the liquid, is curved. It has a skin on its surface; 
its molecules, as Lord Kayleigli has recently explained in this room, 
attract one another, and it exliibits surface tension. IJaise the tem- 
perature and tlie meniscus grows liatter; raise it further, aud it is 
nearly flat and almost invisible; atihe (-ritical temperature it disap- 
pears, having first become quite tlat. Surface tensicm therefore dis- 
appears at the critical i)oint. A liipiid would no longer rise in a nar- 
rowcapillary tube; it would stand at the same level outside and inside. 

It A\ as suggested by I'rof. Janu's Thomson, ami by Prof. Clausius 
about the same time, that il'lhe i(l<'al state of things weie to exist, the 
]»assage from the liqnid to the gaseous state shcmld be a conlinuoas 
one, not nuMcly at ami above the critical i>oint, but below that t<'mper- 
ature. And it was suggested that the curves, shown in the (igure, in- 
stead of breaking into the straight line of \apor ])iessure, should con- 
tinue sinuously. Let us see what this conce})tion would involve. 

On decreasing the volume of a gas, it should not liquefy at the point 
marked B on the diagram (Fig. 2), but should still decrease in volume 
on increase of pressure. This decrease should continue until the pohit 
E is reached. The anomalous state of matters should tiien occur, that a 
decrease in vohime should be accompanied by a decrease of pressure. 
In order to lessen volume, the gas must be exposed to a continually di- 
minishing ]uessure. P>ut such a comlition of matter is of its nature 
unstable, an<l Inis never been realized. After volume has been de- 
creased to a certain point, F, decrease of volume is again attended by 
iiH-rease of pressure, ami the last i)art of the curve is continu<ms with 
the realizable curve re])r(^seuting the compression of the li(iuid, above D. 

J)r. Sydney Young and I succeeded, by a method which I shall

briefly describe, iu mapping the actual position of the nurealizable por- 
tions of the curve. They have the form pictured in this figure. The rise 
trom the gaseous state is a gradual one, but the fall from the liquid state 
is abrupt.

Fig. 2. 



Consider the volume 14 cubic centimeters per gram on the figure. 
The equi-volume vertical line cuts tlie isothennal lines for the temper- 
atures 175°, 180°, 185°, 190°, and so on, at certain definite pressures, 
which may be read from a properly-constructed diagram. We can map 
the course of lines of equal volume, of which the instance given is one, 
using temperatures as ordinates and pressures as absciss*. We can 
thus find the relations of temperature to pressure for certain definite 
volumes, which we may select to suit our convenience— say 2 c.c. per 
gram; 3, 4, 5, 6, and so on, Now, all such lines are straight — that is, 
the relation of pressure to temperature, at constant volume, is one of the 



LIQUIDS AND GASES. 309 

simplest: pressure is a linear fauction ol" tempcratiiie. Exi^ressed 
iiiathematieally — 

p = bt — a, 

•where h iiiid a iire eoiistants, depeiiding- on the volume cliosen, aud 
varying' with each volume. IJut a^ strai.ij;ht line uiay be extrapolated 
without error; and so, havinji' found values for <( and h for sueh a 
vohnue as (> e.e. i)er gram, by help of experinu'uts at temperatures 
higher than 195^, it is possible by e.\tra])olation to obtain the pressures 
corresponding to temperatures 1)elow the critical point 19.")'3 by simple 
means. But below that temperature the substance at volume is in 
practice partly li(juid and partly gas. Yet it is possible by such means 
to ascertain the relations of pressure to temperature for the unrealiz- 
able portion of the state of a liquid — that is, we cau deduce the pressure 
and temperature corresponding to a continous (-hauge from liquid to 
gas. And in this nmuner the sinuous lines on the figure have been 
constructed. 

It is i)ossible to realize ex))crimeutally certain ])ortions of such con- 
tinuous curves. If we condense all gaseous ethei- and, when the tube 
is completely tilled with liijuid, carefully reduce pressure, the pressure 
may be lowered considerably below the vapor pressure corresponding 
to the temperature of ebullition, without any change further than the 
slight expansion of the li(]uid resulting tVom the reduction of pres- 
sure — an expansion too small to be seen with this api)aratus. But on 
still further reducing pressure, vSudden ebullition occurs, and a ])ortion 
of the liquid suddenly changes into gas, while the pressure rises 
quickly to the vapor pressure corresiionding to the teuq)erature. If we 
are successful in expelling all air or gas from the ether in filling the 
tube, a considerable i)ortion of this curve can be ex])erimentally realized. 

The first notice of this appearaiu'e, or rather of one owing- its exist- 
ence to a precisely similar cause, is due to Ifooke, the celebrated con- 
temporary of Boyle. It is noted in the account of the Proeeedni(/s of 
the Royal kSovletii on ]Srovend)er 0, I(i72, that "Mr. Ilooke read a dis- 
course of his, containing his th<mghts of the cx])erinuMit of the <jnick- 
silver's standing- to]) full, and far above the height of 2t» inches, to- 
gether with some exi)erinu'uts made by hiju, in order to determiiK^ the 
cause of this strange phenomenon, lie was ordeied to prepare those 
experiments for the view of the Society." Aiid on November 13 ''the 
exi)eriment for the high suspension of (iui<'ksilver being called for, it 
was found that it had failcMl. It was oi-dered tliat thicker glasses 
slumld be provided iov the next meeting."' 

There can be no doubt tliat this behax lor is caused hy the attrac- 
tion of the nu)lecul<^s of the li<|uid for each other. An«l if the tenq)era- 
ture be sufiicientlylow, the pressure maybe so reduced that it becomes 
negative — that is, until the liquid is exposed to a strain or pull, as is 
the mercury. This lias been experimentally realized by M. ]^)erthelot 
and by Mr. AVorthington, the latter of whom has succeeded in strain- 



310 LIQUIDS AND GASES. 

in (J alcohol at the ordinary temperature with a pull equivalent to a 
negative pressure of 25 atmospheres, by completely lillini;- a bulb with 
alcohol, and then cooling it. The alcohol in contracting- strains the 
bulb inwards; and iinally, when the tension becomes very great, parts 
from the glass with a sharp "click." 

To realize a portion of the other bend of the curve, an experiment has 
been devised by Mr. John Aitken. It is as follows: If air — that is 
space, for the air plays a secondary part — saturated with moisture be 
cooled, the moisture will not deposit unless there are dust particles on 
which condensation can take place. It is not at first evident how this 
corresponds to the compressing of a gas Avithout condensation. But a 
glance at the figure will render the matter plain. Consider the isother- 
mal 175° 0. for ether at the ])oint marked A. If it were possible to lower 
the temperature to 100° C. without condensation, keeping volume con- 
stant, the pressure would fall, and the gas would then be in the state 
represented on the isothermal line 160° at G, — that is, it Avould be in 
the same condition as if it had been compressed without condensation. 

You saw that a gas, or a liquid, is heated by compression ; a piece of 
tinder was set on fire by the heat evolved on compressing air. You 
saw that condensation of ether was brought about by diminution of 
pressure — that is, it was cooled. Now, if h,ir be suddenly expanded 
it will do work against atmospheric pressure aiul will cool itself. This 
globe contains air; but the air has been fitltered carefully through cot- 
t(m-wool, with the object of excluding dust particles. It is saturated 
with moisture. On taking a stroke of the pump, so as to exhaust the 
air in the globe, no change is evident; n.o condensation has occurred, 
although the air has been so cooled that the moisture should condense 
were it possible. On repeating the operation with the same globe, 
after admitting dusty air — ordinary air from this room — a slight fog 
is produced, and, owing to the light behind, a circular rainbow is 
seen; a slight shower of rain has taken place. There are compara- 
tively few dust particles, because only a little dusty air has been ad- 
mitted. On again repeating the fog is denser; there are more par. 
tides on which moistnre may condense. 

One point more and I have done. Work is measured by the distance 
or height through which a weight can be raised against the force of 
gravity. The British unit of work is a foot-pound — that is, a pound 
raised through 1 foot; that of the metric system is 1 gram raised 
through 1 centimeter. If a pound be raised through 2 feet twice as 
much work is done as that of raising a pound through 1 foot, and an 
amount e(pial to that of raising 2 pounds througli 1 foot. The measure 
of Avork is therefore the weight nuiltij)lied by the distance through 
which it is raised. When a gas expands against pressure it does work. 
The gas may be supposed to be confined in a vertical tube and to pro- 
l)el a i)iston upward against the pressure of the atmospheie. If such 
a tube has a sectional area of 1 square centimeter, the gas in expand- 



LIQUIDS AND GASES. 311 

iii^i" ;i centimeter up the tube lifts a weight of iieaily 1 ,000 grants through 
1 centimeter, for the preissure of tin? atmostjjhere on a S((uare (;enti- 
meter of surface is nearly 1,000 grains — that is, it (h)es 1,000 units of 
work, or ergs. So the work done by a gas in expanding is measured 
by the change of volume multi]»licd by the ])ressure. On tlie figuic, tiie 
change of volume is measmcd horizontally, the change of pressure ver- 
tically. Hence the work done is equivalent to tlie area ABC 7> on 
the figure. 

If li(piid as it exists at A change to gas as it exists at B, the sub- 
stance changes its volume aud may be made to do work. This is 
familiar in the steam engine, where work is done by water expanding 
to steam aud so increasing its v<dume. The pressure does not alter 
during this change of volume if suflflcieut heat be supplied; hence the 
work done during such a change is given by the rectangular area. 

Suppose that a man is conveying a trunk u]} to the first story of a 
lumse; he may do it in two (or, perhaps, a greater number of) ways. lie 
may put a ladder up to the drawing-room window, shoulder his truidc, 
and deposit it directly on the first floor; or he may go down the area 
stairs, pass through the kitchen, up the kitchen stairs, up the first 
flight, up the second flight, and down again to the first story. The end 
result is the same; aud he does the same amount of work in both cases 
so far as conveying the weight to a- given height is concerned, because 
in going down stairs he has actually allowed work to be done on him 
by the descent of the weight. 

Now, the li(iuid in expamling to gas begins at a definite volume; it 
evaporates gradually to gas without altering lux'ssure, heat being, of 
c<mrse, communi<;ated to it (hiring the change, else it would cool itself; 
and it finally ends as gas. It increases its volume by a definite amount 
at a detinite pi-essure, and so does a definite amount of work. This 
work might be utilized in driving an engine. 

r>ut if it i)ass continuously from licpiid to gas, the starting ])oint and 
the end i)oint are both the same as before. An e(|ual anu>unt of work 
has been done: but it has been done by going down the area stair (as 
it were), and over the round I described before. 

It is clear tliat a less auu)unt of work has been done ontiie h^ft hand 
side of the figure than was done belbre, and a greater amount on the 
right-hand side; and if I have made my mcainng clear you will s<'e 
that as nuich less has been done on the one side as more has been 
done on the other— that is, that the area of the figure B E /f must be 
equal to that of the figure A F H. Dr. Young and 1 have tried this 
experimentally — that is, by measuring the calculated areas — an<l we 
found them to be equal. 

This can Ik^ shown to you easily by a simple device, namely, taking 
them out and weighing them. As this diagram is an exact represen-

and place one in each of this pair of scales and they balance. The 
fact tliat a nnniber of areas thus measured gave the tlieoretical results 
of itself furnishes a strong support of the Justice of the conclusions we 
drew as regards the forms of these cnrves. 

To attempt to explain the reasons of this behavior would take more 
time than can be given to-night; moreover, to tell the truth, we do not 
know them. But we have at least partial knowledge and we may 
hope that investigations at jiresent being carried out by Prof. Tait

PEESENT PROBLEMS IN EVOLUTION AND HEREDITY.* 



By Henry Faiei'ield Osborn. 



In the past decade of practii-al research and S])ecn]ation in biology, 
two snbjects have oustripped in interest and importance the rapid prog- 
ress all along the line. These are, tirst, the life history of the repro- 
ductive cell from its infancy in the ovum onward, and second, the 
associated problem of heredity, which passes insensibly from the held 
of direct observation into the region of pure speculation. 

As regards the cell it was generally believed that the nucleus was an 
arcannm into the mysteries of which we could not far penetrate; but 
this belief has long been dispelled by the eager specialist, and it is no 
exaggeration to say that we now know more about the meaning of the 
nucleus than we did about the entire cell a few years ago. At that 
time the current solution of the heredity problem was a purely formal 
one; it (;ame to the main barrier, namely, the relation of heredity and 
evolution to the reproductive cells, and leapt owv it by the postulate 
of Pangenesis. The germ-cell studies of Balfour, Van Beneden, the 
Hertwig brothers, Weismann, Boveri, and others, have gradually led 
us to hope that we shall sonu' day trace the connection between the 
intricate metamorphos(\s in these cells and the external phenomena of 
heredity, and more than this, to realize that the heredity theory of the 
future must rest upon a far more exact knowledge than we enjoy at 
present of the history of the reproductive cell both in itself and in the 
influence which the surrounding body cells lia\<' upon it. 

These advances alfe(;t the problem of lil'e and proto])lasm, whether 
studied by the ])hysician, the antiiropologist, or the zoologist, thus con- 
centrating into one focus o])inions wliicli ha\ e been formed by the 
observation of widely different (glasses of facts. As each class of facts 
bears to the observ(;r a diifei'ent aspect and gives him a i)ersonal bias, 
the discusson is by no means irenical, and it is our i)iivilege to live 
through one of those heated ]>eriods which mai'k the course of every 
revolution in the world of ideas. Such a crisis was brought about bv

314 PRESENT PROBLEMS IN EVOLUTION AND HEREDITY. 

t)ie iHiblicatioii of the theory of Darwin, in 1S58, and, after subsiding, 
has again been aroused by Weismann's theory of heredity, published 
in 1883. 

This is the situation I have ventured to present to you as Cartwright 
lecturer, not, of course, without introducing some conclusions of my 
own, which have been derived livmi vertebrate pahcontology, but which 
I shall direct mainly upon human evolution. 

So far as theories need come before us now, remember that Lamarck 
(1792) attributed evolution to the hereditary transmission to ottspring 
of changes (acquired variations) caused by environment and habit in 
the parent. Darwin's latest view was that evolution is due to the 
natural selection of such congenital vai'iations as favored survival, sup- 
j)lemented by the transmission of acquired variations. Weismann 
denies the transmission of acquired variations, or characters, entirely, 
and attributes evolution solely to the natural selection of the indi- 
viduals which bear the most favorable variations of the geim or repro- 
ductive cells. We nuist therefore clearly distinguish between "con- 
genital variations" which are part of our inheritance and "acquired 
variations" which are due to our life liabits; the question is, are the 
latter transmitted':! 

At the outset I would emphasize the extreme complexity of evolution 
by a few words upon variation, or in terms of medical science, upon 
anomalies. 

Wlien we sjieak of a part as "anomalous" we mean that it varies at 
birth from the ordinary or typical form; it may be minute, as the small 
slip of a tendon, or large, as the addition of a complete vertebra to the 
spinal cohimn. Wood has found that in tlie muscular system alone 
there are nine anomalies in the average individual. It is clear that 
the evolution of a new type, so far as the muscular system is concerned, 
must consist in the accumulation of anomalies in a certain definite 
direction by heredity. Thus the anomalous condition of one generation 
may become the typicial condition of a very much later generation, and 
we observe the paradox of a. typi(;al structure becoming an anomaly 
and an anomalous structure becoming typi(;al: for example, the supra- 
condylar foramen of the liumerus was once typical, it is now anom- 
ahms; the retardation in development of the wisdom tooth was once 
anoaialous, it is now typical. 

The same principle applies to races which are in different stages of 
evolution; an anomaly in the white, such as the early closure of the 
cranial sutures, is normal in the black. Now the deductions of the 
Weismann school of evolutionists seem to be founded ui)on the prin- 
ciple "■de minimis non curat /e.r;" that we need only regard such major 
variations as can, ex hypothesis weigh in the scale of survival. Against 
this 1 urge tluxt we must regard the evolution of particular structures, 
the components of larger organs, the separate muscles and bones for 
example, for the very reason that while iu some cases they play a most 



PRESENT PROBLEMS IN EVOLUTION AND HEREDITY. olf) 

humble role in our economy we ean ])rove beyond a doubt that they are 
in course of evolution. .Minor variations in foot structure, whicli are 
possibly of vital importance to a quadruped whose very existence may 
depend upon speed, siidc into obscurity as factors in the survival of 
the modern American. 

The evohition of uran in the most unimportant details of his structure 
promises, therefore, to attbrd a tar more crucial test of the Lamarckiau 
vs. the pure natural selection theory, than in the domain of his hij;her 
faculties, for the reason that selection may operate upon variations in 
mind, while it taxes our credulity to believe it can operate upon varia- 
tions in muscle and bone. This is my ground for selecting the skele- 
ton and muscles for the subject of the introductory lecture. Never- 
theless, let us review variation in all its forms in luiman anatomy be- 
fore forming an opinion. Let us remember, too, that congenital and 
acquired variations are universal as necessities of birth and life; they 
are exhibited in the body as a whole — in its proportions, in the compo- 
nents of each limb, linally in the separate parts of each component, as 
in the divisions of a complex muscle. Thus the possibilities of trans- 
formism are everywliere. What is the nature and origin of congenital 
variations? Their causes? Do they follow certain directions? Do 
they spring from acquired variations by heredity ? These are some 
of the questions wliich are still unsettled. 

But striking as are the anomalies from type, the repetitions of type 
as exhibited in atavism and normal inh(u-itance are still more so, and 
equally difllicult to explain. Tlicreforc our theory must provide both 
ibr the observed laws of repetition of am-estral form and thb laws of 
variation from ancestral form, as the pasture-land ofevoluti<m. Add 
to these, that for a period in each generation this entire legislation of 
nature is comi)ressed into the tiny nucleus of the fertilized ovum, 
and tlu' whole problem rises before us in its apparent imi)regnability 
which only intensifies our ardor of research. 

LKC'irUK I. — THE CONTEMPORAKV EVOLUTION OF MAN. 

The aiitinopologists and anatoniists liave enjoyed a certain monoi>oly 
of Homo .s(tjn(iis^ while the biologists have directed tlieir energies 
nminly upon the lower creation. lint under the inspiring intluenccs of 
the Darwinian theory these originally distinct branches have con- 
verged, and as man takes his i)lace in the zoological system, conn)ai- 
ative anatomy is recognized as the inlallible key to human anatomy. 

For our ]>resent pnrpose we nuist sup])ress our sentinu'iili at the out- 
set and state plainly that the only intei-pretation of our bodily sti'uc- 
ture li(;s in the theory of our des(-ent from some early member of the 
primates, such as may have given rise also to the living Anthr(>poidea. 
This is also the only tenable teleological view, for manj^ of our inher- 
ited organs ar<' at luesent non purposive, in some cases even harmful, — 
as the appendix vermiformis. 



316 PRESENT PROBLEMS IN EVOLUTION AND HEREDITY. 

From the typical mammalian standpoint man is a degenerate 
animal; his senses are inferior in acuteness; his upright position, while 
giving him a sni^erior aspect, entails many disadvantages, as recently 
enumerated by Clevenger,* for the body is not fully adapted to it; his 
feet are not superior to those of many lower Eocene plantigrades; his 
teeth are mechanically far interior to those of the domestic cat. In 
fact, if an unbiassed comparative anatomist should reach this planet 
from Mars he could only pass favorable comment uj>on the perfection 
of the hand and the massive brain. Holding these trumps, man has 
been and now is discarding many useful structures. 1 refer especially 
to civilized man, who is more j>rodigal with his inheritance than the 
savage. By virtue of the hand and the brain he is nevertheless the 
best adapted and most cosmoj^olitan vertebrate. The man of Nean- 
derthal or Spy, with retreating forehead and brain of small cubic 
capacity t was limited both in his ideas and his powers of travel; yet 
he was our sui)erior in some points of osteological structure. But the 
X^eriod of Neanderthal was recent compared with that in which some 
of our rudimentary organs were serviceable, such as the vermiform 
appendix or the panniculiis carnosus| muscle. These rudiments in 
turn are neogenetic when we consider the age of the two antique 
sense organs in the optic thalamus, the remnants of the median or 
pineal eye and the pituitary body, both of which were undoubtedly 
present, and probably useful, in the recently discovered Silurian iishes. 

I mention these vestiges of some of the first steps in creation to illus- 
trate the extraordinary conservative power of heredity (which is even 
more forcibly seen in our embryological development), partly also to 
show how widely our organs differ in age. Galton has com^iared the 
human frame to a new building built up of fragments of old ones; ex- 
tend this back into the ages and the comparison is complete. 

Development, balance, degeneration. — It is probable tliat none of our 
organs are absolutely static and that the apparent halt in the develop- 
ment of some is merely relative, as where a fast train glasses a slow one. 
The numerous cases of arrested evolution in nature are always con- 
nected with fixity of environment, an exceptional condition with man, 
and we have ample evidence that some organs are changing more rap- 
idly than others. 

Adaptation to our changing circumstances is mainly effected by the 
simultaneous development and degeneration of organs which lie side 
by side, as in the muscles of the foot or hand; in terms of physiology,

derthal skull, which were entertained by Quatrefages and others. See Fraipont

we observe the liypi'rti()i)liy of adaptive oii;aiisaii(l atioi)hy of iiiadai)- 
tive or useless organs. Thiscoiiiix'iisatingre-adjustmciit, whereby tiie 
Slim of imti'itioii to any region remains the same (hiring- re-distribution 
to its parts, may be called metatrophism. It is the " gerrymauder " i)rin- 
ciple in nature. 

In practical investigation it is >'ery dithcult in many cases to deter- 
mine whether an orgau is actually develo}»ing or degenerating at the 
present time, although its variability or tendency to ]U'esent indi- 
vidual anomalies indicates that some change is in ])rogress. I may 
instance the highly variable peroneus tertius muscle (Wood). Tlie rise 
or fall of organs is so constantly associated with tlieir degree of utility 
that in each case the doubt can be removed by a careful analysis of the 
greater oi' less actual service rendered by the i>art in (juestion. Apart 
from tlu^ ({uestion of causation, it is a fixed principle tliat a. ]»art degen- 
erating by disuse in each individual will also be found degenerating in 
the lace. 

Degeneration is an extremely slo^v proc(\ss; botliinthe muscular and 
skeletal systems we find oigans sf> far on the down grade that they are 
meie pensioners of the body, drawing pa.\' (/. c.^ mitrition) for past hon- 
orable services without performing any corresponding work — the plan- 
taris and pabnaris muscles for exani])le. ( )f course an organ without a 
function is a, disadvantage, so that the tinal duty of degeneration is to 
restore the balance between structure and function, by placing it liors 
df comhdt entirely. One symptom of decline is variability, in which the 
organ seems to be (lemonstratiug its own uselessness by occasional 
absence. As Humphrey remarks: "The muscles which are most fre- 
quently absent by anomalies are in fact those which can disappear with 
least inconvenience, eitlu^r because they can be re])laced by others or 
because they play an altogether secondary role in the organism.'' The 
stages downward are gradual ; the rudiment becomes variable as an 
adult structure, then as a fcetal structure; the ])ercentage of absence 
slowly increases until it re-ai)pears only as a reversion; linally the 
part ceases even to revert and all record of it is lost. This long strug- 
gle of the destructive power of degeneration, which you see is essen- 
tially an adaptive factor, against the protecti\'e power of heredity is 
the most striking feature of the law of repetition. (See Galton's simi- 
lar princi))h' of regression in anthropology.) 

A careful study of our develoi)iug, degenerating, rudimental, and 
reversional organs am])ly demonstrates that man is now in a state of 
evolution hardly less lapid. I believe, than that which has jn'oduced 
the modern horse from his small five-toed ancestor. As far as I can 
see, the only reason why our <'voluti(m should be slower than that of 
the ancient horse is the fre(|uent intermingling of races, which always 
temls to resolve types which have spc('ialized into more generali/ed 
types. Wherever the human sp(>cies has been isolated foi- a long jieriod 
of time, divergence of character is very marked, as will be seen in some 
of the races I refer to below. 



318 PRESENT PROBLEMS IN EVOLUTION AND HEREDITY. 

To lighten the loug catalogue of facts, gathered from many authors, 
I shall frequently allude to habit, but will ask you to consider it for the 
time as associational rather than causal. Pouchet says: "Man is a 
creature of the writing table, and could only have been invented in a 
country in which covering of the feet is universal;" he should have 
added the "eating table." From the average man our fashions and 
occupations demand the play of the forearm and hand, the independent 
and complex movements of the thumb and finger; the outward turning 
of the foot in walking. These are some of the most conspicuous features 
of modern habit. 

The skeletal variations* — In a most valuable essay by Arthur Thom- 
son upon "The Influence of Postiue on the Form of the Articular Sur- 
faces of the Tibia and Astragalus in the Different Eaces of Man and 
the Higher Apes,"t we find clearly brought out the distinction between 
congenital variations and tliose which may be acquired by prolonged 
habits of life. It is perfectly clear from this investigation that certain 
racial characters, such as " platycnemism " or flattened tibia, which 
have been considered of great importance in anthropology, may prove 
to be merely individual modifications due to certain local and temporary 
customs. Thomson's conclusions are that the tibia is the most variable 
in length and form of any long bone in the body. Platycnemia is most 
frequent in tribes living by hunting and climbing in hilly countries, 
and is associated with the strong development of the tibialis posticus. 
The great c<mvexity of the external condyloid surface of the tibia in 
savage races appears to be developed during life by the frequent or 
habitual knee flexure in squatting; it is less developed where the tibia 
has a backward curve, and is independent of platycnemia. Another 
product of the s(iuatting habit is a facet formed upon the neck of the 
astragalus by the tibia. This is very rare in Europeans; it is found in 
the gorilla and oraug, but rarely in the chimpanzee. We must there- 
fore be on our guard to distinguish between congenital or hereditary 
skeletal characters which are fundamental, and "acquired" skeletal 
variations which may not be hereditary. The latter are of question- 
able value in tracing lines of descent, if not actually misleading; on 
the other hand, the teeth, as shown by Cope in his essay on "Lemurine 
reversion in human dentition," have distinct racial patterns and are 
reliable indices of consanguinity, because their form can not be modified 

during life. 

The main features of present evolution in the backbone are the elab- 
oration of the spines of the cervical vertebra?, the increase of the spinal 
curvatures, the shortening of the centra of the lumbar vertebrae and

Cuimiughani has found that the division of the neural s[)iiies in the 
upper cervical vertebra' distinj;uislies the ]ii.i>her races from the h)wer.* 
The si)ine of tiie axis is always biHd, but the spines of the cervicals 
three, four, and live, are also, as a iiile, bitid in the European, Mhile 
they are single in tlie lower races. The same author shows that the 
bodies of the lumbar vertebi;e are altering, by wjdeninj;' and shorten- 
ing, to form a tii'inei- ])illar of support, with a com|)(Misating increase in 
the length of tiie inteiverteltral cartilages.t In the child, the vertebra*, 
inesent more nearly their primitive elongate compressed form. With 
this is associated an increase of the forward lumbar curvature (Tur- 
ner);! the piimitive (/. r., Simian) curve was backward: even in the 
negroes the collecti^"e measurement of the posterior faces of the live 
lumbars is greater than the anterior, in the proportion of KM) to 100; 
whereas in tlie white the collective anterior faces exceed tlu' ]»osterior 
in nearly the same i)roportion — 100 to 9(5. 

The lower region of the back is also the seat of one of tlie most inter- 
esting and imi)ortant of the ciumges in the body, namely, the correlated 
evolution of the inferior ribs, the lumbar vertebra', and the pelvis, — to 
which cnd)ryology, adult and com]»arative anaton\y, ami reversion all

interesting example of "correlated revei'sion," for as the jtchis shifted 
downward to its ancestral })ositi(/ii u])on the twenty-sixth vertebra, 
the thirteenth rib was also restored. The other ribs are in what the 
ancients styled a "state of tlux;" our eighth rib has been so recently 
floated from the sternum that, and according to ('uiiniiigliam,*] it re- 
verts as a true rib in twenty cases out of a hundred, showing a decided 
preference for the right si(h'. IJegarding also tlu' occasional fusion of

lose our twelfth rib. The upright position, aud coasequeut transfer of 
the weight of the abdominal viscera to the pelvis, may be considered 
the habit associated with this reduction of the chest; at all events, in 
the evolution of quadrux)eds there is a constant relation of increase be- 
tween the size of the posterior ribs and the weight of the viscera, until 
the rib-bearing vertebra' rise to twenty and the lumbars are reduced 
to three.* It would be interesting to note the condition of the ribs in 
some of the large-bellied tribes of Africans in reference to this point. 

The coccyx has naturally been the center of active search for the 
missing flexible caudals. As is well known, the adult coccyx contains 
but from three to five centers, while the embryo contains from five to 
six. Dr. Max Bartels has made "Die geschwiinzten Menschen" the 
subject of an exhaustive memoir upon cases of tlie reversion of the 
tail, while Testut records all the i)rimitive tail jnuscles in various 
stages of reversion. Watson reports that the curvatores coccygia 
(depressores cauda^) occur only in 1 in 1,000 cases. 

This suggests a moment's digression to consider the different phases 
of reversion. The thirteenth rib recurs by wliat Gegenbaur calls "neo- 
genetic reversion," t for it is simply the anomalous adult development of 
an embryonic rudiment. Under neogenetic reversions many authors 
also include cases of the "arrested development," or persistence of an 
embryonic condition to adult life, such as the disunited odontoid proc- 
ess of the axis vertebra, which happens to repeat a very remote an- 
cestral condition. I think such cases may illustrate a reversional 
tendency, although many cases of arrested development, such as 
anencephaly, have no atavistic significance whatever.^ More rare 
and far more difficult to explain are the " paheogenetic reversions," in 
wbich the anomaly, such as the supracondylar foramen, reverts to an 
atavus so remote that the rudiment is not even represented in the 
embryo. 

The features of skull development are primarily the increase of the 
cranium aud the late closure of the cranial sutures, in contrast with 
the more complete and earlier closure of the facial sutures. 

So far as I can gather, this seems to be another region where the 
white and colored races present reversed conditions; the early closure 
and arrest of brain development in the negroes is well known; the 
later closure among the whites is undoubtedly an ada]itatiou to brain 
growth. In his valuable statistics upon the Cambridge students, 
Galton says: "Although it is pretty well ascertained that in the 
masses of the ijopulation tbe brain ceases to grow after the age of 
nineteen, or even earlier, it is by no means the case with university 
students. In high honor men head growth is precocious, their heads 

predominate over the average more at nineteen than at twenty-five."

in a new Caledoiuau cliild (Deslongchamps) and in two (ireenlamleis 
(Cams). The orbito -maxillary frontal suture, cited by Turner as a re- 
version to the pithecoid condition, is believed by Thomson, a tier the 
examination of 1,037 skulls, to he merely an accidental variation, with- 
out any deeper significance,* The development of the temporal bone 
from two centers, observed by ]\reckel, (iruber, and many others, is 
consick'red by Albrecht a reversu)n to the s<^[)arate quadrate of the 
sauro-niamnialia. This 1 think is in the highest degree improbable (see 
"Limits of Reversion"). The open cranial and closed facial sutures 
are apparently associated with our increasing brain action anddecreas. 
iug jaw action; in one case the growth is prolonged and the sutures are 
left open, in the other, the growth is arrested and the sutures are 
ch)sed. 

Is tlie lower jaw developing or degenerating? This (piesfion has re- 
cently been the subject of a spirited controvei-sy between Mv. W. IMatt 
Ball,t representing the Weisman school, and Mr. F. ] Toward Collins, | 
.sui)porting Herbert Spencer's view that a diminishing jaw is one of the 
features of our evolution which can only be explained by disuse. Mr. 
C<>llins find that, relatively to the skull, the mass of the recent English 
jaw is one-ninth less than that of the ancient British and, roughly 
speaking, half that of the Australian. Fie appears to establish the 
view that the jaw is diminishing. 

Closely connected with this is the evolution of tiie leelh; how are 
they tending'?

wbicli are variable or absent in us (Abbott); moreover, in the macro- 
dont races a surplus molar t (m. 4) is sometimes developed. ]\Iummery 
reports nine such cases among 328 West Africans (Ashantis). As an 
instance of associated habit I may here mention that Dr. Lumholtz, 
the Australian explorer, informs me that in adult natives the teeth are 
worn to the gum ; in the iibsence of tools they are used in every occu- 
pation, from eviscerating a snake to cutting a root. A tour of inspec- 
tion through any large collection of skulls brings out the contrast be- 
tween the sound and hard- worn uu>lars of tlie savage, and the decayed 
and little-worn molars of the wliite. 

Upon the descent theory, the reduction of teeth in the progenitor of 
man began as far back as the Eocene period, for not later than that 
remote age do we hud the full complenuMit of three incisors and four 
premolars in each jaw; now there are but two remaining of each. 
Baiime, a high authority, believes he has discovered eleven cases of a 
rudimental reversion of one of these lost premolars | not cutting the 
jaw. Not infrequently both these missing teeth occur by reversion. 
It is difficult to conceive of reversion to such a remote period, yet it 
is supported by other evidence. An embryonic third incisor has, I 
believe, been discovered. As long ago as 1863 Sedgwick § recorded a 
case of six upper and lower incisors m both jaws, and appearing in 
both the milk and permanent dentitions; this anomaly was inherited 
from a grandparent, a striking instance of hereditary reversional ten- 
dency. We might consider that these cases of supernumerary teeth 
belong in the same category as polydactylism, or additional fingers, 
wliich are not ataAistic, but for the taijt that they do not exceed the 
typical ancestral number, whereas the fingers do. 

We owe to Windle|| a careful review of the incisor reversions, in 
which he shows that the lost incisors re-appear more frequently in the 
upper than the lower jaw (coinciding with the fact that the lower teeth 
were the first to disappear in the race); he considers that the ttst 
tooth was the one originally next the canine, and concludes by adding 
our present upper outer incisor to the long list of degenerating organs.^] 
He supports this statement by measurements and by citing cases in 
which it has been found absent. Yet the reduction of the jaws is ap- 
parently outstripping that of the teeth, if we can judge from the

The base of tiic scapuhi is widenin*;- in the hij:j,lier races, so that the 
•'index," or ratio of length to breadth, is quite distinctive, (lejienbaur 
associates tliis witli the development of the scapulo-luuneral muscles 
and tiie greater play of the humerus as a prehensile organ. 

In general, the arm increases in interest as we descend towaid the 
hand, both in the skeleton and musculature, because here we meet with 
tlie lirst glimpses of facts which enable us to form some estimate of the 
rate of human evolution. The well-known humeral toi-sion (connected 
with increased rotation) ascends from 1.">LJ^ in the polished stone age to 
1(54'^ in the modern European. The intercondylar foramen, or ]»ertbra- 
tion of the olecranon fossa, is exceptionally well recorded;* it is found 
in.'U) i»ercent of skeletons of the reindeer period; in the (h)lmen period 
it fell to 24 per cent: in Parisian cemeteries between the fourth and 
tenth centuries it is found in ~>.r} per cent; it has now fallen to ."{..j [)er 
cent. The condylar foramen, occasionally forming a complete bridge 
of bone above the inner condyle and transmitting the median nerve 
and brachial artery, is known as the "entepicondylar" foramen in com- 
parati\(' anatomy, and is one of the most ancient (diaracters of the 
mammalia; it reveits paheogenetically in 1 per cent of lecent skeletons, 
but mu(di more fre(iuently in inferior races (Lamb). In the wrist bone 
is sometimes developed another extremely old structure — the oscentrale. 
(Irubert reported its recurrence at 0.25 per cent ap])roximately. This 
is a case of neogenetic reversion, for Lebouc(]:j: shows that there is a 
distinct (icntrale in every human carpus in the first ])art of the second 
month, which iH)rmally fuses with the scaphoid l)y the middle of the 
tidrd month. 

The divergence of the fennile from th(^ male ])elvis is an important 
fcatuic of our ])rogressi\'e de\"eloi>inent; it is proved by the fact tliat, 
as w(> descend among the lower races it l)e(!omcs increasingly difticult

two sexes are nearly uniform. Here it seems to me is a most interest 
ing problem for investigation. Arbuthnot Lane's§ views oflhe nu-chan- 
ical causers of this divergence, whicth are strongly Lamarckian. may be 
weighed with the theory of survival of the fittest, for the large femah' 
pelvis is perha[ts the In^st <'xample that can be adduced of a skeletal 
variation which would be i)i-esei\-ed l»y natural selection, foi- reasons 
which are self-cnident. The third trochanter of the femur is believed

versiou (1 per cent) in onr lace and not an ac(j[mred variation, as it 
is very freqnently foniul among the Sioux, 50 per cent, Lai)l;inders, Gl 
per cent, and Swedes, -ST per cent; like the condylar foramen it is an 
ancient mammalian cliaracter. 

The foot is full of interest in its association of degeneration and de 
velopment with our present habits of Avalking"; the great toe is increas- 
ing and the litth' toe diminishing, causing the obli(|ue slo])e from witliiii 
outward whicli is in wide contrast with the scpiare toes in the infant or 
in tlie lower races, in many races the second toe is as long as the first, 
and the feet are carried [)arallel instead of the large toe turning out. 
If anyone will analyze liis sensations in walking, even in his shoes, he 
will be conscious that the great toe is taking active part in progression 
while the little toe is passive and insensitive. We are not surprised, 
therefore, to learn from Pfitziicr* that we are losing a phalanx, that in 
many human skeletons (41.5 per cent in women and 31 per cent 
in men) the two end joints of the little toe are fused. The fusion 
occurs not oidy in adults, but between birth and the seventh year, and 
in embryos of between the fiftli and seventh month. The author does 
not attribute this to the mechanical pressure of tight shoes because it 
is fonnd iu the poorer classes. He considers it the first act of a total 
degeneration of the fifth toe. 

Variations in the muscles. — The evolution of the muscles of the foot 
looks in the same direction. As you know, the large toe in nuiuy of 
the apes is set at an angle to the loot and is used in climbing. It is 
still employed in a variety of occupations by different races. Accord- 
ing to Treadett,t the celebrated great toeof the Annamese, which nor- 
mally i^rojects at a wide angle from the foot, is contemptuously men- 
tioned in Chinese annals of 22S5 li. c, the race being then described 
as the "cross-toes." The long fiexor of the hallux is apparently de- 
generating, showing a tendency to fuse with the fiexor communis; the 
al)ductors and adductors of this toe are also degenerating, the latter 
beingproportionately large in (diildren (Huge). The little toe exhibits 
only by reversion its primitive share of the fiexor brevis (Gegenbaur); 
more frequently it \aries in the direction of its future decline by losing 
its flexor brevis tendon entirely. Two atavistii; nuiscles, the abductor 
metatarsi quinti:}: (always present in the aj)es), and the peroneus parvus 
(Bischoff'). also i)oint to the former mobility of the outer side of the foot. 
In general the bones of the foot are developing on the inner and degen- 
erating (m the outer side, with loss of the lateral movements of the 
hallux and of all independent movements in the little toe. The associ- 
ated habit is that the main axis of pressure and strain now connects 
the he(d and great toe, leaving the outer side of the foot comi)aratively 
functionless.

TIk' variations in tlic imisciilar system mark oti' more clearly the 
re.uioiis of contemporary evolution, and therefore are even moreinstruc- 
ti\e than those in the skeleton. Muscular anomalies have however 
nev«-r been adeijuately analyzed. IWvw the remarkable memoir of M- 
'I'estut, •' Sur les Anomalies miisculaires," is defective in not clearly 
distiuijuishinn- between variations whii'h look to the future, those which 
revei't to the past, and those whicli are fortuitous, foi- the authiu- is 
stroufily inclined t;> refer all anomalies lo revei'sion. 

The law of muscular evolution is specialization by the successive 
separation of new independent contractih^ bands from tlu^ lai,u-c funda 
mental nuiscles, while the law of skeletal evolution is re(bicti(ni <tf 
])rimitive parts and the s])ecializatiou of articular surfaces. The num- 
ber of mus<'les ill the itrimates as ;! whole has therefore been steadily 
increasinj^-, while the number of bones has been dimimishinii'. In man 
the number of nuiscles is ])robably increasinii- in the i-e^ions of the 
lower arm. and diminishiuii' in every other reuion. Tiie analysis is 
rendered very dihicult by the fact that some muscles {e. </., those con- 
nei'tinn- the shonhh'r with tlie neck and back) rev<'rt to a formm- condi- 
tion of greater specialization when they were employed in swin.uin^- the 
body by the arms, and in (pia(lrui)edal locomotion; while (►ther nuiscles 
{(■. //., those connectin^y- the lV)rearm and tini;ers) revert to a former 
simpler arranj^'cment when the hand was mainly a liraspin;;- or.i:an, and 
the thumb was not o])i)osable. 

As in the skeh^ton, we fuul that muscular anomalies include (I) 
l)ala'Oi4'enetic reversions, or complete restorations of lost muscles; {2) 
neoiicnetic r<'versions, oi' revivals of former tyi)es in the relatior.s of 
existin;;- muscles; (.")) proj^ressive variations, which either by deueiuM-- 
ation or specialization point to future types; (4) fortuitous variations, 
which cannot be referred to either of the above. 

Duval observes that the tlexor lonjius policis re])eatsin reversion all 
ihc sla.ues of its evolution between man and the a.})es, in which it is a 
dixision of the tlexor ])rofundus. (Jruber and others lia\'e escji obser\-ed 
the absiMice of the thumb ten(h)n. This is true of all the new nuiscles. 
Of this Testut writes:

326 PRESENT PROBLEMS IN EVOLUTION AND HEREDITY. 

You have noticed the recent discovery that the grasping power of 
infants is so great tliat the reflex contraction of the fingers upon a 
slender crossbar sustains their weiglit; this power and the decided 
inward rotation of the sole of the foot and mobility of the toes are per- 
sistent adai)tations. Our grasping uniscle, the pal maris longus, is 
highly variable and often absent; like the plantaris of the calf, it has 
been re])laced by other muscles, and its insertion has been withdrawn 
from the metapodium to the palmar fascia. In negroes we freipiently 
find the palmaris reverting to its former function of Hexing the fingers 
by insertion in the metacarpals. 

The rise of muscular specialization by degeneration is beautifully 
shown in the extensor indicis, which, while normally supplying the 
index only, reverts by sending its former slips to the thumb, middle, 
and even to the ring finger. Testut* believes that the extension power 
of the middle and ring fingers has declined, as the cases of reversion 
point to greater mobility; the extensor minimi digit! is distinct and 
highly variable (Wood), often sending a slip to the ring finger. 

The entire flexor group of the hand, excepting the palmaris, is appa- 
rently specializing. The demonstration by Windlef and Bland Sutton, 
that the origin of the flexors and extensors is shifting downward from 
their original position, is evidence of an ada])tation to the short special 
contractions required of them. 

The abductor pollicisj is also i>rogressiv^e and variable (Wood); the 
reduplication of its inferior tendon, which is sometimes provided with 
a distinct muscle, apparently points to the birth of a. second abductor. 
The opponens of the thumb is well established and constant. Yarial>il- 
ity seems to characterize both the developing and degenerating nuis- 
cles; tlie latter are apt to be absent; it is rare that an important muscle, 
sucli as the extensor indicis, is absent, but such cases are reported. 

It is interesting to note that the lost muscles of the body are almost 
exclusively in the trunk or shoulder, and pelvic arches, and not in the 
limbs. It will be remembered that the human shoulder joint is excej)- 
tionally rigid, whereas in the quadrupedal state it was a factor in pro- 
gression. Some of the muscular reversions in this quadrupedal region 
are the h^vator clavieuhe (1 to GO, Macalister), tracln^lo-clavicularis, 
scalenus intermedins, acromio-basilaris (Ohampneys), transversns 
imcha^ (Gegenbaur). Api)arently associated with the former swinging 
of the body by the fore limb in the arboreal life are the atavistic coraco- 
brachialis-brevis (Testut), the epitrochlco-dorsalis (Testut), and ])ecto 
ralistei'tius (Testut). §

related to liuiiuiii (nolutioii. I call attention to se\cral iinptjirant in- 
ductions. First, there are several centers in which l)otli the skeletal 
and ninscrilar systems are hijihly variable, f^econd, that the most con- 
si)icuons variations, and therefore the most fre([nently iccoided. are 
leversions. Third, that structure lags far behind function in e\ oliition. 
The conclusions of Wood, antl of Testut,* are that vaiiabilit.\- is inde 
Iteudent of age or sex, of general muscularity, and of abnormal mental 
develoi)ment. Wood found 981 anomalies in 102 subjects: of these, 023 
were developed upon both sides of the body, while o.lS were unilateral. 
Of still greater interest are the statistics collected by Wood between 
1807-'(JS in the dissecting room of Iving's College, u])on Mi subjects 
(18 of each sex). These show that there are more anomalies in the 
limbs than in the trunk; that anomalies are rare in the pelvis; that 
there were 292 anomalies in the anterior limbs to 119 in the ])osterior; 
that in both lind)s the anomalies increase toward the distal segments, 
culminating in the muscles of the thund), where they rise to 90 jmh- 
cent, (mainly tlexor longus pollicis, and abductor longus pollicis). 
These facts seem to prove conclusively that while Aariation is universal 
it rises to a maximum in the centers where human evolution is most 
rapid; here are Herbert S])encer's conditions of unstable erpiilibrium, 
This has a direct bearing, as 1 slmll show, upon our theory of her<'dity. 

Fortuitous roiifiniildl raridtioiis. — 1 have thus far considei'ed only 
those variations which ai>parently have a definite relation to the course 
of human evolution. Ther<' is an entirely different class of congenital 
variations which ma\' be desciibed as fortuitous or indefinite l)ecause 
they do not occur in any lixed ]»ercentage of cases; they are liable to 
take any direction; they can not b<' considered reversional because 
rhey are not found in the hyi)othetical atavus, and there is not sufH- 
cient evidence to cause us to c<»nsi(ler them as inci)>icnt features of our 
future structure. 

Sonu^ ini'.y not be truly congenital (/. c. si)iinging direct fiom the 
germ cells) but may be merely deviations from the norinal course of 
development. I may instance the variations in the carpus recorded by 
Turnerf in which the tiapezium and sca])hoid unite, or the trapezoid 
and semilunar di\ide, or tlu^ astragalus and navicular unite (Ander- 
son). 

The best example of fortuitous congenital variations are seen in su- 
])ernumeraiy tingers and vertebra'. The eighth cer\ical \etebra, beai- 
ing a ludinientary rib,i is not a reversion because the most remote aii- 
cestois (»f mail have but seven cervicals. In cases whcie a rib is de- 
xcloped upon the seventh cervical, however, the reveision theory is 
perhaps applicable because rib bearing cervicals are relatively less re-

inot(>. The same distinction aiiplies to polydactylisin. How absurd 
it is to consider a sixth lin,i;-er atavistic, when we remember that even 
our Permian ancestors had but five lingers. 

We can not however class, as purely fortuitous a variation which 
occurs in a definite percentage of cases presenting twenty four differ- 
ent varieties, but oc<'arring in the same region. Such is the much-dis- 
cussed* musculus sternalis, a muscle extending vertically over the 
origin of the pectoralis from the region of the sterno-mastoid to that 
of the obliquus externus. Testut lightly applies liis universal rever- 
sion theory, and as this uniscle is not found in any mammal considers 
it a regression to the rei)tilian presternal (0]»hidia) ! Turner also con- 
sidered it as reversional in connection with the panniculus carnosus, 
the old twitching muscle of the skin, which plays so many freaks of 
reversion in the scalp and neck; this view is negatived by the fact that 
this muscle is innervated by the anterior thoracic (Cunningham, Shep- 
herd) which would c(mnect it with the pectorial system, or by the inter- 
costal nerves (Bardelebeu). Although the high percentage of recur- 
rence in the sternalis in anencei)halous monsters (90 percent according 
to Shepherd) sui)ports the reversion view, it is offset by the high per- 
centage (4 per cent.) in normal subjects, for this is far too high for a 
structure of such age as the reptilian presternal. Cunningham has 
advanced another hypothesis, first suggested by the frequency of this 
anomaly in women, that this is a new inspiratory muscle, having its 
origin in reversion, but serving a useful purpose when it recurs, and 
therefore likely to be perpetuated. 

These fortuitous \ariations, as well as variations in the proi)ortions 
of organs, play an important part in the present discussion upon hered- 
ity, for it is believed by the Weismann school that such variations, if 
they chance to be useful, will be accunndated by selection and thus 
become race characteis. 

The limits of rrverfiion. — There is such a wide difference of opinion 
upon tlie subject of reversions that it is important to determine what 
are some of the tests of genuine reversions. How shall we distinguish 
them from indefinite variations or from anomalies like the steriuilis 
muscle, which strain the reversion theory to the breaking i)oint? 

Testut, f Duval, and Blanchard take the extreme position that almost 
all anomalies reproduce earlier normal structures, and that the excep- 
tions may be attributed to the incompleteness of our knowledge of 
coini>arative anatomy. I may here observe that ])opular as the descent 
theory has recently become in France, neither these anthroi)ologists 
nor the paliTeontologists show a very clear conception of the phyletic 
or branching element in evolution, if they do not find a nniscleinthe 
primates they h)ok for it in other orders of mannnals. Now, since 
these other branches diverged from that which gave rise to man at a

niosl it'iiiotc j)('ii()<l. llic (lisuox cry ol';i similar iiiusclr may be iimmcIv a 
coincidence; it is by no means a jtroot' ot" reversion. 

The lirst test of reversion is llierelbre the anatomy ol the ata\us 
and this is dei'ived i)artly from the i>aLeontolo<;ical record oC the 
])riinates, partly from the law of diveri^ence, viz., that featnres which 
are common to all the livinii" ])riinates Avere ])robal)ly also found in the 
stem form which uave rise to man; linally, from the comparative anat- 
omy of the li\ iuji' antliroi»oidea. 

The second test is whether a strncture passes the limits of reversion 
as determined by cases of ata\'ism in which theiecan be no reasonable 
doubt. Two of these phenomena have recently been discussed, which 
seem to extend the ])ossibi]ities of reversion back to structmes which 
were lost at a very remote period. I refer to ]>apers by Williams and 
Howies. Williams* has analyzed lf>(> rec(trded <'ases of polymastism; 
he finds that sui)ernumerary nii)])les of souk^ form occur in two per 
cent, and that in all except four of the cases examined the anomalies, 
tested by position, etc., su]iport the reversion hypothesis. In the 
living" lemurs, whiidi form a ]»ersistent primitive group of monkeys, we 
find that the transition from i)olymastism to bimastism is now in 
progress by the degeneration of the abdominal and inguinal nii)ides; it 
is fair to assume that the higher monkeys also lost their abdominal 
nipples at a ]>rimitive stage of development, and therefore that cases 
of multiple nipples indicate reversion to a Lower Eocene condition! 
Howes t has recently comi^leted a most interesting study of the ''iu- 
tranarial ei)iglottis," or cases in which the epiglottis is carried up into 
the posterior mires, as in young marsupials and some cetacea, to sub- 
serve direct narial respiration. This has now been ol)served to occur 
by reversion in all orders of mammals, including the monkeys and 
lemurs. One case has also been reported by Sutton of its occurrence 
in a human fetus. This is api)arently a human revei'sion to a structure 
much older than the age of the lemurs. 

The third test is the inverse latio to time. It woidd seem, <i priori^ 
that the i>ercentageofrecunencei)f atavistic structures should decrease 
as the extent of time elai)sing since the structure disai)])eare(l increases. 
This law is api»arently established in the case of the condylar and 
intercondylar foramina, and if we examine all the ])ercentages which 
have been established we see at once that they bear a ratio to time; 
<;om])are the relative fie(|uenc3^ of the isc,hio-i)ul)ic (.">() per cent), dorso- 
epitrochlearis (5 per cent), and levator-davicuhr (!••><' p<'i' ecnt) mus- 
cles with the periods which have elapsed sinci^ their past service. This 
is why it is so imj)ortant to establish ]»erc('ntages for all our atavistic 
organs; fidler statistics wall not only bear upon heicdity, but I can 
conceive of their application to the extremely diflicnlt jjroblem of 
estinniting geological time. \N'e must, of course, establish as a stand-

330 PRESENT PROBLEMS IN EVOLTTTION AND HEREDITY. 

ar<l cases of congenital variation in wliicli llie fieqnenc^' of recurrence 
has been steadily declining in the siinie race between two known ])eriods 
of time — an available structure is the intercondylar foramen or su]n'a- 
trochlear foramen, as recorded by lUanchard, Shepherd, and others. 

The reversional teii<lency is hereditary. There are nniny cases, both 
of reversions (as in the teeth) and iiulefinite variations being hereditary, 
that is, re-appearing in several generations, or skipping a generation 
and recurring in the second. 

Siiininary. — There are clearly marked out several regions in the human 
body in Avhich evolution is relatively most rai)id, such as the lower 
portion of the chest, the upi>er cervicals, the shoulder girdle in its rela- 
tion to the trunk, the lower portion of the arm and hand, the outer 
portion of the foot. We notice that these regions especially are centers 
of adaptation to new habits of life in which new organs and new rela- 
tions of parts are being acquired and old organs abandoned. 

We observe also that all i)arts of the body are not equally variable, 
but these centers of evolution are also the chief centers of variability. 
The variations here are not exclusively, but mainly, of one kind; they 
rise from the constnnt struggle between adaptation and the force of 
heredity. Here is a muscle like the extensor indicis attempting to give 
up an old function and establish anew one; it maintains its new func- 
tion for several generations, and then goes back without any warning 
to a function which it had thousands of years ago. Thus the tVu-ce of 
reversion strikes us as a universal factor. 

l>row the singular fact about reversion is the frequent })roof it affords 
of what Galton has called "particulate inheritance.'' When the ex- 
tensor indicis reverts, all the muscles around it may be nonnal; there- 
fore we are obliged to consider each of these muscles as a structure by 
itself, with its own particular history and its own tendencies to deveh)X5 
or degenerate. Thus it is misleading to base our theory of evolution 
and heredity solely upon entire organs; in the hand and foot we have 
mimerous cases of nuiscles in close <'ontiguity, one steadily develo])ing, 
the other steadily degenerating, lleversion very rarely acts upon many 
structures at once; when it does, we have a case of diffused anomaly, 
some repetition in the epidermis, or in the entire organism of a 
lower type. 

Yet in spite of reversion and the strong force of repetition in inherit- 
.ance, the human race is steadily evolving into a new type. We must, 
it seems to me, admit that an active principle is constantly operating 
upon these particular structures, guiding them into new lines of adapta- 
tion, acting upon widely separate minor parts, or causing two parts, 
side by side, to evolve in o]>posite directions, one coward degeneration, 
the other toward development. 

1 may now recall the two opposed theories as to what this a«'tive 
principle is : 

The first, and oldest, is that individual adaptation, or the tendencies

establislied by use and disuse u])on })aiticular structures in the ])areut 
are in some degree transinitted to the offspring ;iiid thus guide tlu' 
nuiiu course of variation and adaptation. 

The secoud is that all iiarts of the body are variable, and tliat wher- 
ever \/ariations take a direction favorabh^ (that is, adaptive) to the sur- 
vival of the ])ar(Mit they tend to be preserved; where they take the op- 
posite direction they tend to be eliminated. Thus, in the long run, 
adaptive variations are accuuiulated and a new type is evolved. 

It is evident at once, from a glance over the facts brought forward 
in tliis lecture, that the first theory is the sim]dest explanation of these 
facts ; that us(^ and disuse characterizes all the centers of evolution ; that 
changesof structure are slowly following our changes of function or habit. 

But Avhile the first explanation is the simplest it by no means fol- 
lows that it is the true one. In fact, it lauds us in many difticnlties, 
so that I shall reserve the ])ros aiul cons for my second lecture npon 
heredity. Tlie Lamarckiaii theory is a sus])iciously simple explana 
tiou of such complex processes.

State of opinion . — The above quotation from one of the most eminent 
autliorities of our times represents the unshaken conviction of a very 
large class upon one side of the question of transmission of acquired 
characters, which is met by equally firm conviction upon the other side. 

Herbert Spencer, whose entire system of biology, psychology, and 
ethics is based upon such transmission, says: "I will only add that, 
considering the width and depth of the effects which acceptance of one 
or other of these hypotheses must have on our views of life, mind, morals, 
and politics, the question Avhich of them is true demands, beyond all 
other questions whatever, the attention of scientific nuMi." * This shows 
that Spencer considers the matter still suhjndice, and lest you may think 
I am bringhig before you an issue in which learning and experience 
are ranged against ignorance and prejudice, I have taken some i)ains 
by correspondence with a number of friends abroad to learn tlse pres- 
ent state of opinion. The two leading English and French authorities 
ni>on this subject express themselves doubtfully. 

(xalton's mind is still wavering, as in his work of 1S81> he says: 

"I am unprepared to say more than a few words on the obscure, 
unsettled, and much-discussed subject of the possibility of transmitting 
acquired faculties. - - - There is very little direct evidence of its 
infiuence in the course of a single generation, if the i)hrase of 'acquired 
faculties' is used in perfect strictness and all inheritance is excluded 
that could be I'eferred to some form of natural selection, or of infection 
before birth, or of peculiarities of nurture and rearing." t

oi)inion ''that ac(i|Uired characters can not be transmitted; - - 

that there are no i)roofs of such tr;msmission, that its occuirence is 
theoretically improbable, and that we must attempt to explain the 
transformation of species without its aid.'"* Besides Virchow t and 
Einn-r, t llaeckel has expressed himself strongly against VVeismann. 
My colleague. Prof. Wilson, writes me (.Alunich, Decembcn' 31, 1S!>1) 
that, while W'eismann's modiiitd theories as to the phenomena in the 
reproductive cells are pretty generally accepted, Hertwig, Hofer, Paully, 
lioveri, and others are pronounced advocates of the acquired-charac- 
ter-transmission theory. 

In l*aiis Brown-Seqnard, who v>as among the lirst to test this prob- 
lem experimentally by observing the inheritance of the ctfects of nerve, 
lesions, his assistant, ])upuy, (iiard, Duval, Blanchard, and others are 
on the affirmative, or Lamarckian side. 

Physiologists generally have fought shy of the <{uestion, although I 
thinlc in the end they will be forced to take it up with the mor])holo 
gists, and give us the physio-mor])hological theory of heredity of the 
future. Prof. Michael Foster, of Cambridge, and Prof Burdon-San- 
dersoii. of Oxford, l)otli write me that the question has hardly come 
into the i»hysiologica! stage of inquiry at all. Yet in England Weis- 
mann has found his strongest su])porters among some of the naturalists : 
Wallace, Laid<ester, Thiselton Dyer, Meldohi, Poulton, Howes, and 
othei's; while, cxcei)ting W'indle, tlie anntonn'sts, including Mixart and 
Lawson Tait, with Sir William Turner as the most prominent, nn^ all 
Lamarckians. Huxley, Pomanes, and Flower are said to be doubtful. 
In this country the opinion of naturalists is directly the outgrowth of 
the <'lass of studies in which each hapi)ens to be engaged. So f;ir as [ 
know every vertebrate and inverte1)rate pahcontologist is a^ Laniarck- 
ian,§ lor in this lield all e\(>Iution seems to follow the lines of inherited 
use and disuse: most of those engaged upon inveitebrat(» zoology in- 
cline to follow \\'cismaiin. 1 have conversed upon this subject with 
many ])hysicians, and find that without excejjtion t he t ransmission ol 
acquired (diameters is an accepted fact among the profession.

state most clearly what is and what is uot involved in this discussion. 
Weismann* does not claim that the reproduction or jicrm cells areun- 
iuduenced by habit; on the other hand, he admits that most important 
modifications in these cells may and do result from changes of food, 
climate, from healthy or unhealthy conditions of the body; also from 
infectious disease, where it is quite as possible that the microbes may 
enter the reproductive cells as any other cells of the body; from alco- 
holism, where the normal molecular acticm of the protoplasm of the 
germ cells may be disturbed, resulting in abnormal development, and 
there are some very interesting experiments which 1 shall cite on this 
j)oint; from some nervous disorders which profoundly modify cell- 
function in all the tissues: in other words, ornni mnum in corpore sano. 
But to accept all this, and even to iiichuh^ all our rapidly increasing 
knowledge of the direct relation between such phenomena as produc- 
tion of deformities and determination of sex, and the influences of 
environment u]>on the ovum; or the inliueiu'es of the mother upon the 
fcetus — this is all aside from the real question at issue. 

It may be stated thus: Given G, the ova and si)ermatozoa, the germ 
cells or material vehicles of hereditary characters; A', the body or so- 
matic; cells of all the other tissues conveying the hereditary characters 
of nerve, muscle, and bone; F, the variations in these body cells "ac- 
quired" during lifetime; given these factors, the real question is: Do 
influences at work producing variations in certain body cells of the 
parent so alfect the germ cells of the i)arent that they re-appear in cor- 
responding body cells of the offs])ring ? To take a concrete case, will 
the increased use of the cells of the extensor iiulicis nuiscle in the 
parent so stimulate that portion of the germ cells Avhich represents this 
muscle that the increment of growth will in any degree re-ai)})ear in 
the offspring ? 

This is what is reipiired of heredity upon the Lamarckian hypothe- 
sis, and r think you will see at once that while this hypothesis sim- 
plifies the problem of evolution it in a corresponding degree renders 
more difficult the problem of heredity — for we have uot the first ray of 
knoM'ledge of what such a process involves. There is no quality more 
essential to scientific progress than common honesty; if we take a 
position let us face all its consequences; the more we reflect upon it 
the more serious the Lamarckian position becomes. 

In the present lecture let us first briefly review the progress of the 
science of heredity which has led up to the present discussion. Second, 
let us examine the e\'idence for and against the Lamarckian theory, 
and inquire how far natural selection can explain all the facts of evolu- 
tion. Third, let us examine the evidence for such a c(uitinuous relation 
between the body cells and germ cells as must exist if the Lamarckian 
theory is the true one.

theories of heredity* •!• A. 'rii<)iii]»8«tii distiiijiuishes three <ieiieral 
])r<)l>h'iiis, which areofteii eoiitiised : 1st. \Vliat characters distinguish 
the iierni cells from other cells of the body.' I'd. How do the };eriii 
cells derive these distiii,uuishiii,ii' characters? '.k\. How shall we inter- 
pret '"particulate" inheritance, or the re-appearance of single peculiari- 
ties in the ortspringf 

The various theories may be grouped under two heads. •• I'angenesis 
of Gerni cells" and ••Continuity of (ierni cells" according to the 
dominating idea in ('ach. 

1. Pangenesis. — The idea ])ervading ]>angenesis was tirst expressed 
!)>• Democritus that the ••seed" of animals was derived by contributions 
of material jtarticles from all ]>arts of tlie bodies of both sexes, and that 
like parts i)i-oduced like. Two thousand years latei-, Button revived 
this conception of heredity in his ''Molecules organiques." In 1804 
Herbert Spencer suggested the existence of "physiological niuts," 
derived from the body cells of the parent, forming the germ cells and 
then developing into the body cells of the offsi)ring. 

It is interesting to note the course of Darwin's thought upon this 
matter in his published works and in his ''Life and Letters." He was 
at first strongly opposed to the views upon evolution advance<l by 
Butfon, by lOrasmus ])arwiu, his graiulfather, exi)anded by Lanuirck, 
and now known as Tianuirckian. Hut gradually becoming convin<;ed 
that his own theory of natural selection could not account for all the 
facts of evolution, he unconsciously l»ecanie a strong advocate of 
Lannirck's theory, and contributed to it a feature which Lanuuck had 
entirely omitted, namely, a theory of heredity ex]>ressly designed to 
explain the transmission of ac(iuired characters. Darwin's "provi- 
sional hypothesis of i)angenesis " f ])ostulated a material connection 
between tlie body cells and germ cells by the circulation of minutebuds 
from each cell: each body cell throws off a "geiinnule" containing its 
characteristics, these gemmules nniltiply and become esjiecially concen- 
tiated in the germ cells; in the latter tlu'y unite with others like them- 
selves; in course of development they grow into cells like those from 
which they were oiiginally given off. (See Fig" 1, Diagram ii.) 

(ralton, who has always been doubtful in regard to use inheritance, 
while advancing a theory of "continuity," partly approved Darwin's 
pangeiH^sis idea in the cautious statement: "Each c<'ll may throw oft' a 
few germs that find their way into the circulatif)n and thereby have a 
chance of entering the germ cells." j At the same time (lalton contrib- 
uted very important experimental disproof of the existence of "gem- 
mules," and in fact — of the popular ideaof the circulation of hereditary 
characters in the blood, by a series of careful experiments upon the

speiiiiatozoa were sharply (lirteicntiated.* (1) lie rei;ai (led the ovum 
as a cell especially desigiieil as a storehouse of hereditary (;hanicteris- 
ties, each characteristic being rei)reseiite(l by material i)articles of some 
kind; thus hereditary characters were handed down by simple cell divi- 
sion, each fertilized ovum j^i viuj>- rise to the body cells in which its hered 
itary characters were manifested and to new ova in which these ciiarac- 
ters were conserved for the next generation (this [ortion of Brooks's 
Ilieoiy is very similar to (ralton's and Weismann's). (li) The body 
(u'lls have the powcu' of throwing off ''gcmmules," but this is exercised 
mainly or exclusively wlien its normal functions are disturbed, as in 
nu'tatrophic exercise or under change of environment. (.")) These gem- 
uuiles may enter the ovum, but tlu' spermato/oan is their nuiin center. 
According to this view the female cell is rather conservative and the 
male cell progressive; the union of these cells produces variability in 
the offspring, exhibited es[)ecially in the regions of the offspring cor- 
responding to the regions of faactional disturbance in the i)arent. 
This hypothesis was well (considered, and while that feature of it which 
distinguishes the male and female germ cells as different in kind has 
been disproved, and the whole conception of gemmules is uow abandoned, 
the fact still remains that we shall nevertheless be obliged to offer some 
hypothesis to explain the facts disregarded by Weismann for which 
Brooks provides in his theory of the causes of variation. 

L'. Continuity of germ cells. — Tlu' central idea here is an outgrowth 
ol'our more m(jdern knowledge of embryogenesis and histogenesis, and 
is therefore comparatively recent; it is that of a fundamental dis- 
tinction between the "germ cells,"' as continuous and belonging to the 
race, and the "body cells," as belonging to the individual. Weismann 
has retiued and elaborated this idea, but it was not original with him. 

liichard Owen.t in L.S4!), naeck(^l,t iu 18()(), llauber,§ in 1S71>, in turn 
dwelt upon tlu^ distinction which Dr. Jaeger, now of nninufacturing 
fame, lirst clearly stated: 

"Through a gn^at series of generations the germinal proto|)lasm re- 
tains its specilic i)roperties, dixiding in every reproduction into an 
ontogenetic poition, out of which the individual is built np, and a 
})hylogenetic portion, wliich is reserved to form the rei)r(>ductive 
mateiial of the mature otfspring. This reservation of the phylogenetic 
material I described as the continuity of the gi^.rni protoplasm. - - 

Encai)suled in tlie onti)geneti(; material the i)hylogenetic i)rotoplasm 
is sheltered tVoiu extei iial influences, and retains its specilic and em- 
bryonic characters.*' Tiie latter idea has, under Weismann, been 
expanded into the theoi-y ol isolation of the genu cells.

hereditary organic units contained in the fertilized ovum. His con- 
ception of heredity was derived from the study of man, and he sup- 
ported the idea of continuity in the germ cells in order to account for 
the law of transmission of "latent" characters; it is evident from this 
law that only a part of the organic units of the "stirp" become "patent" 
in the individual body; some are retained latent in the germ cells, and 
become patent only in the next or some succeeding generation. For 
example, the genius for natural science was "patent" in Erasmus Dar- 
win, grandfather of the great naturalist, it was "latent" in his son, 
and re-appeared intensified in his grandson, Charles Darwin. I have 
eLsewhere* summed u]) as follows Galton's general results, which so 
remarkably strengthen the "continuity" idea: We are made up, bit 
by bit, of inherited structures, like a new building, composed of 
fragments of an old one, one element from this progenitor, another 
from that, although such elements are usually transmitted in groups. 
The hereditary congenital constitution thus made up is far stronger 
than the iufluences of environment and habit upon it. A large 
portion of our heritage is unused, for we transmit peculiarities we 
ourselves do not exhibit. The contributions from each ancestor can 
be estimated in numerical proportions, which have been exactly deter- 
mined from statistics of stature in the English race; thus the con- 
tributions from the "patent" stature of the two parents together co'i- 
stitute one-half while the contributions by "latent" heritage from the 
grandparents constitute one-sixteenth, etc. One of the most important 
demonstrations by Galton is the law of regression; this is the factor 
of stability in race type which acts as gravitation does upon the pen- 
dulum; if an individual or a family swing far from the average 
characteristics of their race, and display exceptional physi(;al or 
mental qualities, the principle or regression in heredity tends to draw 
their offspring back to the average. 

Now how shall we distinguish regression from reversion? Very 
clearly, 1 think; regression is the short pull which tends to draw every 
variation and the individual as a whole back to the contemporary typ- 
ical f(n'm, while rt'version is the long pull which draws the tyi)ical form 
of one generjition back to the typical form of a very much earlier gen- 
eration. These forces are evidently akin, and in the shades of trans- 
ition from one type to another we would undoubtedly find a constant 
diminution numerically in the recurrence of characters of the older 
type, and thus "regressi<m " would pass insensibly into " reversion." 

Weismann has carried the idea of continuity to its extreme in his 
simple and beautiful theory of heredity, which is founded upon the 
postulate that there is a distinct form of protoplasm, with definite 
chemical and molecular properties, set apart as the vehicle of inherit- 
ance: this is the germ plasm, Tr, quite separate from the protoplasm 
of the body cells or somatoplasm, S. Congenital characters arising in

llu' Lit'ini-cells ;ii'e cnlh'd blastouviu'tic, while jiccjuiicd characters aiis- 
in.i? in the body cells are soinatogeuetic. 

To clearly understand this vie\y. let us follow the history of the fer- 
tilized ovum in the Ibrniation of the embryo. It first divides into soma- 
to-plasm and germ-pl»sm (see Fig. 1, Diagram iii), the former supplies 
all the tissues of the body — m, s, w, dj r, nervous, muscular, vascular, 
digestive, etc. — with their quota of hereditary structure; the residual 
germ-plasm is kept distinct throughout the early process of eml)ryonic 
cell division until it enters into the formation of the nuclei of the re- 
productive cells, the ova or spermatozoa. Here it is isolated from 
'•iianges of fuui'tiou in tlu^ somatoplasm, and in common with all other 
protoplasm is capable of unlimited growth by cell division without loss 
or deteriorati(m of its past store of hereditary i^roperties; these prop- 
erties are lodged in the nucleus of each ovum and s])ermatozoan, and 
tliese two cells, although widely different in external accessory struc- 
ture (because they have to i)lay an active and passive part in the act 
of conjugation), are exactly the same in their essential molecular 
structure, and the ancestral characters they convey differ only because 
they come along two different lines of descent. When these cells unite 
they carry the germ-])lasm into the body of another individual. Thus 
the somatoplasm of each individual dies, while the germ-plasm is im- 
mortal; it simply shifts its abode from one generation to another; it 
constitutes the chain from which the individuals are mere offshoots. 
Thus the germ-plasm of man is continuous with that of all ancestors 
in his line of descent, and we have an explanation of the early stages 
observed in development in which the human embryo passes through 
a succession of metamorphoses resembling the adult forms of lower 

types. 

In order to emphasize, as it were, the passage of the germ-plasm 
from one generation to another without deterioration in its marvellous 
hereditary ])owers, Weismann added the idea of its isolation. Not only 
does he repudiate the pangenesis notion of increment of germ-plasm 
by addition of gemmules, but he bidieves that it is unaffected by any 
of the noriiuil changes in the somatic or body cells. As this contiiiuify 
and isolation would r(;nder impossible the transmission of characters 
accpiired by the somato-plasm, Weismann began to examine the evi- 
<leiice for such transmission, and coming to the conclusion that it was 
insuflicient, in his notable essay on "■Heredity," in 1SS3, he boldly a1 
tecked the whole Lannirckian theory and has continued to do so in all 
his snbse([uent essays. 

Being Ibrced to explain evolution witiuiut tiiis factor, he clainied 
that variation in the germ plasm \\:is constanly arising by the union 
of plasmata from different lines of descent in fertilization, and that 
tliese variations are constantly being a(;ted upon by luitural selection 
to produce new types. He thus revived Darwin's <'arlier views of 
(•volution, and this in jiart e\[)lains his strong support by English nat- 
uralists.

PRESENT PROBLEMS IN EVOLUTION AND HEREDITY. 



It will be seen at ouce that there are a number of distinct questions 
involved. 

The matter of tirst importance in life is the repetition and preservation 
of type, the principle which insures the unerring accuracy and precision 
with which complex organs are built up from the germ cells; the force 
of regression and the more remote forces of reversion all work in this 
conservative direction ; the theory of the preservation of these forces in 
a specific and continuous form of protoplasm is by far the most plausi- 
ble we can offer at present. 

The matter of second importance, but equally vital to the preserva- 
tion of races, in the long run, is the formation of new tyjjes adapted to 
new circumstances of life. I shall now attemi)t to show that the facts 
of evolution, while not inconsistent with the idea of continuity of the 
germ plasm, are wholly at variance with the idea of its independence, 
separation, or isolation from the functions of the body. This can be 
done by proving, first, that the theory of evolution solely by natural 
selection of chance favorable variations in the germ i)lasm is inade- 
(juate; second, that the inheritance of definite changes in the somatic 
cells is also necessary to explain evolution, and therefore there must 
exist some form of force or matter which connects the activities of the 
somatoplasm with those of the germ plasm. 

In the following table are placed some of the facts of human evolu- 
tion which we have observed in the first lecture, and as they are i)art 
of inheritance, they also constitute the main external phenomena of 
heredity :

What are causes of these various phenomena! 

Factors of evolution. — The term "kinetogenesis" has been applied 
to the modern form of the Lamarckiau theory, fi)r it is an application of 
kinetic or mechanical principles to the origin of all structures such as 
teeth, bone, and muscle. It would be fatal to this theory if it could be 
shown that the changes taking place in course of a normal individual 
life, under the laws of use and disuse, are inadaptive, or do not corre- 
spond to those observed in the evolution of the race. 

The relative growth of Organs. — Ball,* in his long argument 
against Lamarckianism, claims that such is the case, and that use

it receives more ])ressure. Some oriiaiis (like tiie heart, which is 
always at work) wouhl l)ccomc inconveniently or unnecessarily large. 
Other absolutely indispensable organs which are eomi)aratively pas- 
sive or are very sehlom used would dwindle until their weakness 
caused the ruin of the individual or the extinction of the species." 
lie later cites from ])arwin* tlie " Kepoi't of the ITuited States dom- 
ndssioii upon the Soldiers and Sailors of the Late War." that the 
loniicr leiis aiul shorter arms of the sailors are the reverse of what 
should result from the decreased use of the legs in walking and 
increased use of the arms in pulling. A little retieetiou on Mr. IJalTs 
])art would have spared us this crude objection, for whatever dititicul- 
tics may arise from theoretical si)eeTdation as to the laws of growth, 
or fiom statistics, the fact remains that activity nnist increase ada])ta- 
tion in every part of the organism; otherwise the runner and the 
trotting horse should be kept off the track to increase their speed, 
the i)ianist should employ as little linger exercise as possibles If the 
grow'th tendencies in single organs are transmitted, it is evident that 
the adaptive adjustments between these tendencies will also be trans- 
nutted. 

The T\M't. — In point of meehani<'al ada])tation, man, with the single 
excei)tion of his thumb and forearm, has not progressed beyond the 
most i)rimitive eocene rpiadrnped. The laws of evolution of the foot 
in the ungulate or hoofed animals, which have been especially studied 
l)y Kowalevsky, liyder, Cope, and myself, affords a conclusive dem- 
onstration that the skeletal changes in the individual coincide with 
those which will mark the evolution of the race. In the <>arliest un- 
gulates the carpals and tarsals are disposed, as in man, directly above 
each other, with serial joints, as in diagram .1, Fig. 2; in the course 
of e\-olutioii all these joints became interlocking, as in diagram B, 
Fig. .■>; thus producing an alternation of joints and surfacjes sinnlar to 
those which gi\-e str(;ngth to masonry. In studying these facts Coi)et 
icaciied a certain theory as to the motion of the foot and leg in loco- 
motion. In trying to apply this, T found it could not be harmonized 
with all the facts, and 1 w^trked out an entirely different theory.t This 
I found subsequently coincided exactly with the results ])reviously 
<»btained b> ^luybridge, by the aid of instantaneous i)hotograplis, and 
summarized by Prof. Harrison Allen, of the Uni\ersity oi" Tennsyl- 
vania.§

l>hy of our small toe is as good a parallel as we can find of the changes 
which were occurring in the eocene period among the ancestors of the 
horse. 

The Teeth. — But hoAv about the teeth, in which there is an absolute 
loss of tissue in c<msequence of use? This is another objection raised 
by Ball, Poulton, and others, which disap])('avs npon examination. 

The dental tissues, while the hardest in the body, and, unlike bone, 
incapable of self-repair, are not only both living and sensitive, but, to

a very limited degree, plastic and capable of change of form. Ex 
lu/pothcsi, it is not the growth, but the reaction tendency which pro- 
(hu^es the growth, which is transmitted. The evolution of the teeth, 
therefore, falls into the same category as bone.* In the accompanying 
figures I have epitomized the slow transformation of the single-fanged 
conical reptilian tooth, such as we see in the serpents, into the low- 
crowned human grinder. We now know all the transition forms, so 
that we can homologize each of the cusps of the human molar with its 
varied ancestral forms in the line of descent. For example, the anterior 
lingual or inner cusp of the upper true molars traces its pedigree back 
to the reptilian cone. The anterior triangle of cusps, or trigon, seen in 
the mesozoic mammalia and persisting in the first inferior true molar 
of the modern dog, is still seen as the main i)ortion of the crown of the 
human upjier molars {pr, pa, me). To this was added, ages ago, the

Upon the whole, witli some exceptions which we do not at pi-esent

dence derived from the skeleton that, whether any true causal relation 
has existed or not, the lines of individual transformatiou in the Avhole

The rise of new organs. — We owe to Dr. Arbuthnot Lane a most 
interesting series of studies upon the intiuences of various occupa- 
tions upon the human body. He proves conclusively that individual 
adaptation not only i)roduces profound modifications in the ])ro])ortions 
of the various parts, but gives rise to entirely new structures. 

His anatomy and physiology of a shoemaker* shows that the life-long 
habits of this laborious trade produce a distinct type, which if ex- 
amined by any zoological standard would be unhesitatingly pro- 
nounced a new species — homo sartorius. The psychological analysis 
wdiicli a Dickens or Balzac would draw, showing the influences of the 
struggle for existence upon the spirit of this little tailor, could not be 
more pathetic than Dr. Lane's analysis of his body. The bent form, 
crossed legs, thumb and forefinger action, and peculiar jerk of the 
head while drawing the thread, are the main features of sartorial habit. 
The following are only a few of the results: The muscles feuded to 
recede into tendons, and the bony surfaces into which they were in- 
serted tended to grow in the direction of the traction which the 
nniscle exerted upon them. The articulation between the steriuim and 
the clavicle was converted into a very complex arthrodial joint, con- 
stituting almost a, ginglymoid articulation. The sixth ])air of ribs 
were anchylosed to the bodies of the vertebne, indicating that they 
had ceased to rise and fall with sternal breathing, and that respira- 
tion was almost exclusively diaphragmatic. The region of the head 
and first two vertebra' of the neck was still more striking: the trans- 
verse process of the right side of the atlas, toward Avhich the head 
was bentj formed a new articulation with the under surface of the 
jugular process of the occipital bone, " a small synovial cavity sur- 
rcmnded this acquired articulation, but there was no appearance of a

Rate of inlieritance. — This illustiation serves als(» to emphasize the 
great contrast between the rapidity of individual transformation and 
the slowness of race transformation. No one would expect the son of 
this shoemaker to exhibit any of these acciuired malformations. Vet 
I )i'. Lane thinks he lias observed such effects in the third generation 
})}' the summation of similar influences. 

All pahcontological evidence goes to show that the effects of ncMinal 
habits, if transmitted at all, wonld l)c entirely im})erceptiblc in one 
generation. The horse, for example, has not yet completely lost the 
lateral toes which became useless at the end of the l"i)per Eocene ])eriod. 
This objection as to rate of evohition may ])e nrged with equal force 
against the natural selection theory. It is obvious thatthe activepro- 
gressive principle in evolution (whatever it is), must contend with the 
ciiormons conservative power of inheritance, and this, to my mind, is 
one of the strongest arguments against the possibilities of the rise of 
adapt i\e organs by the selection of chance favorable variations in the 
germ plasm. 

Apj)lication to human eroliifioii. — Principles underlying these illus- 
trations may now be applied to some of the facts in human evolution 
brimght out in the first lecture. They show that if functional tenden 
<Mes aie transmitted we can comprehend the distinct evolution history 
of each organ; the rise and fall of two organs side by side; the delinitc 
and purposixe character of some anomalies; the increase of vai'iabilit\ 
in tiu' regions of most rapid evolution; the correlation of de\"clo])nn'nt 
balance, and degeneration in the separate organs of the shouldei', hand, 
and foot. 

Vet even granting this theory there still remain ditfu'ultics. Tlie 
relation of use and disuse to some of the contemporary changes in the 
human backbone is lather obscure. 1 would hesitate to jnonounce an 
opinion as to whether our present habits of life are tending to shorten 
thclninbars, incrcuise the spinal curvatures, and shitt the pehis with- 
out nndcing an exhaustive study of Iiuman motion. Among the inlhi 
ences which Dr. Lane has suggested* as operative here ai'c the wear- 
ing of heeled sho(;s and the incr(!ase of the cranium, lie considers the 
additional or sixth lumbar vertebra as a new element rather than as a 
reversion, and works out in some detail the mechanical effects of the

presence of the fetus u})on female respiration {i. e., in the sternal re- 
gion) and upon the pelvis. Xow, if it be true that the pelvis is larger 
in the higher races than in the lower, I do not think that Dr. Lane can 
sustain his point, because in the lo^yer races the fetus is carried for an 
equally long period, during a much more active life, and in a more con- 
tinuously erect position. Therefore, if these mechanical principles 
were operating, the pelvis in the modern lower races should be larger 
than in the higher. On the other hand, the form of the female i^elvis 
in the higher races is one of the best established selecting or eliminat- 
ing factors, a large pelvis favoring frequent births and the i)reserva- 
tion of those family stirps in Avhicli it occurs. I mention this to show 
how cautious we must be in jumping to conclusions as to kinetogenesis. 
The transformism in all the external features of the skull, jaws, and 
teeth may be attributed to inherited tendencies toward hypertro})h>- 
or atrophy; but how about the convolutions of the turbinal bones or 
the complex development of the semicircular canals and cochlea of 
the internal ear and the many centers of evolution whi(di are beyond 
the influences of use and disuse? These are examples of structures 
wliich fortify Weismann's contention, for if complex organs of this 
character can only be accounted for by natural selection, why consider 
selection inadequate to account for all the changes in the body? 

])ifficulties in the natural-selection theory.—The answer, I think, is 
readily given: We do not know whether use and disuse are oj^erating 
upon the mechanical construction of the ear; we do know that the 
organ can be rendered far more acute by exercise; but even if it were 
true that habit can exert no formative influence, the ear is one of those 
structures which since its first origin has been an important factor in 
survival and may therefore have been evolved by natural selection. 
Now, the very fact that selection may have to care for variations iu 
such prime factors in survival as the ear, renders it the more difficult 
to conceive that it also is nursing the minutia^ of variation in remote, 
obscure, and uncorrelated organs. 

Even in the brief review of human evolution in the first lecture I 
have pointed out eight indei)endent regions of evolution, upward of 
twenty developing organs, upward of thirty degenerating organs. 
A more exhaustive analysis would increase this list tenfold. Now, 
where chance variation should ])roduce an increase in size in all the 
developing organs, and a decrease iu size of all the degenerating 
organs, and an average sizeiu all the static organs, we would have all 
the conditions favoring survival. But the chances are infinity to one 
against such a combination occurring unless the tendencies of variation 
are regulated and determined, as Lamarckians suppose, by the in- 
heritance of individual tendencies. But may not the favorable vari- 
ations in the body be grouped to either out-weigh or under- weigh the 
unfavorable variations? This would be jjossible if combinations oc- 
curred; but we can readily see that combinations, such as we observe

ill the sepui'iite elements of the loot aloiK', coiupletelN' neutralize eaeli 
other so far as "-surNivar' is eoncevned : how the loot would neutralize 
the hand, or the foot and hand wouUl neutralize the lumbar re<;ion.* 

It is this consideration of sinjile origans, the observation of their in- 
dependent history, the rise of new eompound or«4ans by steady g'rowth 
trom iiiiinitesimal beiiinniuiis of their sei)arate elements, the combined 
testimony of anatomy and paheontology which force us to regard the 
tluMiry of evolution by the natural selection of chance variations as 
wholly untenable. With the utmost desire to regard the discussion in 
as fair a s))irit as i)Ossible, the explanations offered by the adherents of 
Weismann's doctrine strike me as strained, evasive, and illogical.! 

We can however by no means undervalue or dispense with natural 
selcH-tion, which mnsr be in continuous o])eration upon every character 
of sutticient importance to weigh in th(^ scale of survival. I need 
hardly remind you that this selecting ]>rinciple was first discovered in 
I81.> by Dr. W. ('. Wells, of Charleston, in connection v\ith the immu- 
nity from certain tropical diseas(\s enjoyed by negi'oes and nuilattoes.| 

The eliminating- factor in selection is illustrated almost daily in cases 
of appendicitis. 1 regret I have not had time to ascertain whether or 
not this disease is considered due jjurely to accident or to congenital 
variation in the ajjcrture of the a])pendix, which favors the admission 
of hard objects. If so, modern surgery is only benefiting the individual 
to the detriment of the race by its efticient preventive o])erations; and 
(»very individual who succumbs to this disease can reflect with melan- 
choly satisfaction that he does so pto bono publico. 

Conclusions as to the factors of <'volution. — The conclusions we 
reach from the study of the muscular and skeletal systems are there- 
fore as follows: 1. That in<lividual transformism in the body is the 
main determinant of variations in the germ cells, and is therefore the 
main cause of definite progressive oi' retrogressive variations in single 
organs. 2. That evolution in these organs is hastened where all mem- 
bers of the race are subject to the same individual transtbrmism. The 
contrast between the rate of indi\'idual transformism ami ra,ce trans- 
formism is due to the strong conservative forces of the germ ]dasina. 
.">. That cNolution is most rapid whei'c variations are of sulhcient rank 
to l)econn' liictors in survival. Then selection and use inheritance unite 
forc(^s as actixc progressive })rinciples o])posing the conservative prin- 
ci[)le in the germ plasma. 4. That fortuitous and chancer variations 
also aris(^ from disturl)ances in the body or germ cells; they may be 
perpetuated, or disappear in succeeding generations.

till' horse. See ''Are Acquired Variations Inherited f" American \'atiir((}inl. Fel>-

348 PRESENT PROBLEMS IN EVOLUTION AND HEREDITY. 

Applying these vit^vs to variation there should theoretically ap- 
pear to be just those two distinct classes of anomalies in the human 
body which we have seen actually occurring: First, those in the path 
of evolution, arising from perfectly normal changes in the somato-plasm 
and germ-plasm: second, those wholly unconnected with the course 
of evolution, arising fortuitously or from abnormal changes in the 
somato-plasm or germ plasm; to this head may be attributed the whole 
scale of deformities. Thus tranformism and deformism should be 
kept distinct in our minds. Nevertheless the facts of deformism con- 
tribute the strong(ist body of evidence which we can nuister at i^resent 
to prove that there does exist a relation between the somatoplasm and 
germ-plasm which renders transformism possible. 

The relations hetireen the mmato-plamt and (lerm-plami . — We have 
seen reasons to take a middle ground as to the distinct speciiic nature 
of the body cells and germ cells, aiid thispositi<m is, I think, strength- 
ened the more broadly we extend our inquiry into all the fields of pro- 
toplasmic activity. 

There are three questions before us. 

1. What is the evidence that the germ-})lasm and somato-plasm are 
distinct! 

2. What is the specific nature of the germ-plasm? 

3. What is the nature of the relations which exist between the two? 

1. The separation of the germ-jdasm is in the regular order of evolu- 
tion upon the princijdes of physiological division of labor. The unicel- 
lular organisms combine all the functions of life in a single massofpro- 
toidasm, that is, in one cell. In the rise of the multi-cellular organisms 
the various functions are distributed into groups of cells, which spe- 
cialize in the perfecting of a single function. Thus the reproductive 
cells fall into the natural order of histogenesis, and the theory of their 
entire separation is more consistent with the laws governing the other 
tissues than the theory which we find ourselves obliged to adopt, that 
while separate they are still united by some unknown threads with the 
other cells. 

The morphological separation of what we may call the race ])roto- 
jilasm becomes more and more sharply defined in the ascending scale 
of organisms. Weismann's contention as to the absolutely distinct 
specific nature of the germ-plasm and sonmto plasm has however to 
meet the apparently insuperable difficulty that in many multi-cellular 
organisms, even of a high order, the potential capacity of repeating 
com]dex hereditary characters, and even of producing perfect germ 
cells, is widely distributed through the tissues. 

For example, cuttings from the leaves of the well-known hot-house 
plant, the begonia, or portions of the stems of the common willow tree, 
are capable of reproducing complete new individuals. This would in- 
dicate either that portions of the germ plasm are distributed througii 
the tissus of these organisms, or that each body cell has retained its 
potential quota of hereditary characters.

Among' the lowoi- animals we lind tlic samt' power: ilwccnt a liydia 
or bell animal('ul(! into a dozen pieces, eaeli may re]>i()iln('e a perfect 
new indivichuil. As we ascend in the animal scale the ] tower is coii- 
lined to the rei)roduction of a lost i>art in the proce8s known as recres- 
cence. As you well know, in the group to which the frog and sala- 
mander belong, a linil) or tail, or e\ en a lower jaw, may berei)rodnced. 
The only logical inter})retation of these ]»henomenii is that the heredi- 
tary powers are distributed in the entire protoplasm of the organism, 
and the capacity of icproduction is not exlniusted in the original for- 
mation of the limb, but is capable of being repeated. There has been 
considerable discussion of late as to the seat of this power of recrescen<'e. 
It seems to me not impossibh' that in the vertebrates it may be stored 
in the germ cells, and it would be very interesting to ascertain experi- 
mentally whether removal of these cells would in any way limit or 
affect this power: we know that such removal in castration or ovari- 
otomy sometimes piofoundly modifies the entire nature of the organ- 
ism, causing nuile characters to appear in the female, and female char- 
acters to develo]> in the male. 

So far as man is concerned it has been claimed by surgeons that 
genuine recrescence sometimes occurs ; for example, that anew head is 
formed upon the femur after exsection ; but my friend Dr. Y. P. Gibney 
informs me that this is an exaggeration, that there is no tendency to 
repioduce a true head, but that a pseudo-head is formed, which may 
be explained upon the ijriuciple of regeneration and individual tians- 
formism by use of the limb. 

Ptliiger's opinicm is that recrescence does not indicate a storage of 
hereditary power, that there is no pre-existing germ ol' the mend)er, 
but that the re-growth is due to the organizing and distributing power 
of the cells at the exjtoscd surface, so that, as new formative nuitter 
arrives, it is bnilt np gradually into the limb. This view would reduce 
recrescence to the level of the regeneration process which nnites two 
cut sections of the elements of a limb in their fornu'r order. It is jtartly 
opposed to the faints above referred to, which seem to prove th<' dis- 
tiibutiou of the hereditary i)ower. Y'et it seems to me (piite consistent 
toc(»iisider these tlirec processes— a, I'eproduction of a new individnal 
from every ])art; It, recrescence of a new mend)er horn any part; r, w- 
geiieration of lost tissues — as three steps indicating the gi-adnal, but 
not entire withdrawal of the reproductive power into the germ cells. 

1 have not space to cDiisider all the gronnds whicli support the view 
of the separation of the g<'rm cells in man. Some of the more i)romi- 
nent are: the very early ditferentiation of these cells in the embry<), 
obscrxcd with a few exc('[)ti()ns in all the h)wer orders of animals, and 
advancing si» rapidly in the human female that several months before 
l)irth the number of primordial ova is estimated at seventy thousand, 
and is not believed to be increased after the age of two and a half 
years. The most patent practical proof is that we may remove every

imj^aired. Among the many reasons advanced for pensioning the 
<irippled soldiers of onr late war yon never hear it nrged that tlieir 
children are incapacitated by inheritance of injnries. The strongest 
proof however rests in the evidence I have already cited from hered- 
ity of the extraordinary stability of the germ cells, which is the safe- 
guard of tlie race. 

1?. The specific nature of the germ-plasm must be considered before 
we consider its relations. Wherein lies the conservative power of the 
germ-plasm, and in what direction shall we look for its tra.nsformiug 
forces? You see at once that marvellous as is the growth of cells in 
other tissues, the growth of tlie germ cell is still more so. 

We find it utterly impossible to form any conception of the contents 
of the microcosmic nucleus of the human fertilized ovum, which is less 
than one twenty-five-hundredths of an inch in diameter, but which is 
nevertheless capable of ]iroducing hundreds of thousands of cells like 
itself, as well as all the unlike cells of the adult organism. We can only 
translate our ideas as to the possible contents of this nucleus in the 
terms of chemistry and physics.* 

Spencer t assumed an order of molecules (U' units of protoplasm lower 
in degree than the visible cell units, to the internal or polar forces of 
which, and their modification by external agencies and inter-action, he 
ascribes the ultimate responsibility in reproduction, heredity, and 
adaptation. This idea of biological units seems to me an essential part 
of any theory ; it is embodied in Darwin's '• gemumles," in Haeckel's 
" plastidules 5" yet, as Lankester says the rapid accumulation of bulk is a 
theoretical difticulty in the material conception of units. In the direc- 
tion of establishing some analogy between the repetition power of hered- 
ity and known function of protoplasm, IIaeckel| and Hering§ have 
likened heredity to memory, and advanced the hypothesis of persist- 
ence of certain undulatory movements; the undulations being suscep- 
tible of tihange, and therefore of producing variability, while theirten- 
dency to x>ersist in their established harmony is the basis of heredity. 
J^erthold, Gautier, and Geddes|| have s])eculated in the elaboration of 
the idea of metabolism ; the former holding the view that "inheritance 
is possible only upon the basis of the fundamental fact that in the 
chemical processes of the organism the same substances and mixtures 
of substances are repioduced in (piantity and ([nality with regidar 
periodicity.'' 11

I ]i;ive merely touched upon tliese speculations to sliow that the un- 
known factors in heredity are also the unknown factors in operation in 
living matter. All we can study is the external form, and conjecture 
that this form represents matter arranj>ed in a certain way l>y forces 
])eculiar to the orijanism. Tliese forces are exhibite<l or ])atent in the 
somatic cells; they are ])otential or latent in the germ cells. 

The last stage of our inquiry is as to the mode in which the action of 
habit or environment ui)oii the somatic cells can be brought to l)ear 
upon the germ cells. 

The nature of tJn' relation l)eticeen the body eell.s and (jerm eells. — I 
hav(! already shown that we are forced to infer that such a. relation 
<'xists by the facts of evolution, although these facts show that the 
transmission of normal tendencies from the body to the germ cells is 
ordiiuirily an extremely slow process. 

Virchow* says every variation in race character is to be traced back 
to the pathological condition of the originator. All that is pathologi- 
cal is not diseased, and inheritance of a variation is not from the intlu- 
enc*' u])on one indi^ idual necessarily, but upon a row of individuals. 
This is in the nornuil condition of things. In the abnormal condition 
the rate of transmissiou may be accelerated. 

Does this transmission depeiul u])on an interchange of material par- 
ticles, or upon an interchange of forces, or both? 

There are three phenomena about which there is nuu-h skepticism, to 
say the least, which bear npon the question of a possible interchange 
of forces between the body and the germ cells. These are the inherit- 
ance of mutilations, the influence of previous fertilization, and the in- 
fluence of maternal impressions. They are all in the quasi-scientitic 
realm, which embraces such mental plienomenaas telej)atliy. That is, 
we incline to deny them siin])l> because we can not explain them. 

Mutilati(»ns. — Siiu-e the ]»ub]ication of Weisniann's essays the sub- 
ject of inherited mutilations has attracted renewed interest. I would 
flrst call att<'ntion to the fact that this matter has only an indiicct bear- 
ing, foi- a mutilation is something impressed U])on the organism from 
without; it is not truly "ac<iuired;" tlie loss of a {)art by accident i)ro- 
duces a sudden but a less profound internal modilication of the organism 
than the loss of a i)art by degeneration. Most of the results are nega- 
tive; many of the so-called ''certain" cases i)rove upon investigation 
to be niere coincidences. Weismannf himself experimented upon white 
jnic(% and showed that 1M)1 young were produc^ed by five generations of 
artilicially mutilated parents, and yet there was not a single example of 
a rudimentary tail or of any other abnormality in this organ. The cases 
of cleft ear lobule have recently been summed u]).j Israel reports two 
cases of clefts in wlii(;h the parent's ears were normal. Schmidt and

Orustein report affirmative cases. His shows that an affirmative case, 
cited by V. Zwieciki, is merely an inherited pecnliarity. Tlie entire 
evidence is unsatisfactory, and upon tlie whole, is decidedly negative. 

Not so however in cases where the mutilation results in a general 
disturbance of the normal functions of different organs, as in the ex- 
l)eriments conducted by BrownSequard* upon guinea-pigs, in which 
we see "acquired variation" intensified. In these, abnormal degener- 
ation of the toes, nmscular atrophy of the thigh, epilepsy, exophthal- 
inia, etc., appeared in the descendants of animals in which the spinal 
cord or sciatic nerve had been severed, or portions of the brain removed. 
It was also shown that the fenmleismore apt to transmit morbid states 
than the male; that the inheritance of thel^e injuries may i)ass over 
one generation and re-appear in the second ; that the transmission by 
heredity of these pathological results may continue for five or six gen- 
erations, when the normal structure of the organs re-appears. These 
cases, wiiich are incontestable, at first sight appear to establish flrndy 
the transmission of acquired characters; they were so regarded by 
Brown-Sequard. These lesions act directly ui)on the organs, and the 
abiiormal growth of these organs appears to be transmitted. But can 
they not be interpreted in another way, namely, that the pathological 
condition of the nerve centers has induced a direct disturbance in those 
portions of the germ cells which rei)resent and will develop into the 
corresponding organs of the future offspring? 

Previous fertilization. — Consider next the influence exerted upon 
the fennile germ cell by the mere proximity of the male germ cell, as 
exhibited in the transmission of the characteristics of one sire to the 
offspring of a succeeding sire, observed in animals, including the 
human species, also in plants. The best example is the oft-iputted 
case of Lord Morton's mare, which reproduced in the foal of a i)urc 
Arab sire the zebra markings of a previous quagga sire. 

Some physiologists t have attempted to account for these remark- 
able indirect results from the previous fertilization or impregnation, 
by the imagination of the mother having been strongly affected, or 
from interchange between the freely inter-communicating circulation 
of tiie embryo and mother, but the analogy from the action in plants 
(in which there is no gestation but early detachment and development 
of tlie fertilized cells) strongly supports the belief that the proximity 
of male germ cells acts directly upon the female cells in the ovary. 
All that we can deduce from these facts is that in sonn' manner the 
normal characteristics and tendencies of the ova are modified by the 
foreign male germ cells without either contact or fertilization.

Lart.* ]\rost praetitiouers, however, believe in it, and I need hardly 
add that it is a universal. |>oi)ul;ir bi'lief, t supported by uumerous 
cases. 1 myself am a firm believer iu it. The beariug which the sub- 
ject has upon this discussion is this: If a dcAiation in the develoj)- 
meut of a child is produced by matermil impression, we have a proof 
that a deviatiou from uormal hereditary teudeucies can be ])roduced 
without either direct vascular or nervous continuity. 

We see an analogy between the experiments of Brown-8e(fuard, the 
influence of the i)revious sire, and the maternal influence. Neither, in 
mj' opinion, directly supi)orts the theory of transndssion of ac(piired 
characters, for they do not prove that normal chan.yes in the body cells 
directly react upcni the ,nerm cells; they all show that the typical 
hereditary development of single organs m;iy be diverted by living- 
forces which have no direct connection with them according to our 
present knowledge. 

AYhat the nature of these forces is 1 will not undertake to say, but 
I believe we must adnut the existence of some unknown force, or rather 
of some unknown relati«ms between the body cells and germ cells. 

A j^ear ago, recognizing fully tlie difliculty of advancing any theory 
of heredity which would exi)lain the transmission of acquired characters, 
I came to the following result : " It follows as an unprejudiced conclusion 
from our present evidence that upon Weismann's princiide we can 
ex])lain inheritance but not evolution, while witli Lamarck's principle 
and Darwin's selection jninciple we can explain evolution, but not, at 
present, inheritance. Disprove Lamarck's princi])le andwenuist assume 
that there is some third factor in evolution of which we are now 
ignorant."' 

In this connection it is interesting to (juoteagain from my colleague, 
Prof. E. n. Wilson. lie writes that the tendency in Germ.any at 
lU'csent is to turn from speculation to empiricism, and this is due 
l>artly "• to the feeling that the recent wondeiiul ad\ances in our

of a purely meciianico physical exi)lanation of vital phenomena. In

vital-force conception. - - - As J3uveri said to me recently, "Es

LECTURE III. — HEREDITY AND THE GERM CELLS. 

Accord iug" to the general law* the gerai cell was cousiderecl as 
matter potentially alive and having within itself tlie tendency to as- 
sume a definite living form in course of individual development. The 
nucleus must be extraordinarily complex, for it contains within itself 
not only the tendencies of the present type, but of past types far 
distant. The supposition of a vast number of germs of structure is 
required by the phejiomena of heredity; Niigeli has demonstrated that 
even in so minute a space as one one-thousandth cubic millimeter, 
400,000,000 micelhe must be present. 

The study of heredity will ultimately center around the structure and 
functions of the germ cells. The precise researches of Galtou show 
that the external facts of heredity, questions of average and of proba- 
bilities, of paternal and maternal contributions to the oftsprings, are 
capable of being- reduced to an exact science in which mathematical 
calculations will enable us to forecast the characteristics of the coming- 
generation. 

There will still remain however a large residuum of facts which will 
present themselves to a mathematician like Galton, as fortuitous, or in- 
exact, such as the physiological conditions of reversion; the course of 
pre-i)otency, by which the maternal or the paternal characteristics pre- 
vail in parts or in the entire structure of the offspring; the material 
basis of latent heritage upon which reversion depends, and which com- 
pels us to hypothecate either an unused hereditary substance or a return 
to an older disposition of the forces in this substance; the nature and 
determination of sex. These apparently chance phenomena must also 
be due to certain tixed laws, and by far the most promising routes to 
discovery have already been taken by Van Beneden, the liertwig 
brothers, Boveri, Maupas, and others. 

They have attacked the problem of the relation of the germ cells to 
the heredity on every side, and by the most ingenious and novel meth- 
ods, which are familiar enough in various branches of gross anatomical 
and i)hysiological research, but seem almost (mt of the limits of applica- 
tion to minute microscopic objects. For example, the Hertwig brothers 
have ascertained the intiuence of various solutions of inorpidne and 
other drugs of the alcohols, and of the various degrees of temperature 
upon the ovum and spermatozoon during- the conjugation period, witli 
results wliicli are highly suggestive of the causes of congenital mal- 
formations, anomalies, and double births. The Hertwigs and Boveri 
have succeeded in robbing ova of their nuclei and watching- the results 
of the subsequent entrance of spermatozoa. In order to further test 
the relations of the nucleus to the remainder of the cell, Verworn has 
experimented along the same Hue with extirpations of every kiml from 
the single cells of Infusoria. Of equal novelty are the recent studies of

in^" 118 a liost of ncwideas as to the cycl«^ of life, tlio nicaninji' of sex, 
and the oii.u'inof the sexual relation. 

In all this n'search and in the future outlook there are two main 
questions : 

1. What is the hereditary substanee ? What is tlu^ material basis of 
heredity, Mhieh sju'eads from the fertilized ovums to every (;ell in the 
body, conveyino- its aueestral eharaeteristics! Is there any substaiiei^ 
eorresponding' to the hypothetieal idioplasm of Niigiilil' 

2. What are its regulating- and distributing- forees ? How is the he- 
reditary substance divided ;nid distributed? How far is it aetive or 
passive 1' 

I may say at the outset that the idioplasm of Kiigeli, a purely ideal 
element of protoplasm which he conceived of as permeating all the tis- 
sues of the body as the vehicle of heredity, has been apparently mate- 
rialized in the chromatin or highly coloring materials in the center of 
the nucleus. This rests upon the demonstration by Van lieneden and 
others that chromatin is found not only in all active cells, but is a con- 
si)ieu(ras element in both the ovum and spermatozoon during all the 
phenomena attending conjugation.

Secondly, that while the chromatin is apparently passive, it is played 
n\)<n\ l>y forces resident in the tjlear surrounding protoplasm of the 
nucleus, bnt chiefly by the extra nuclear archoplasm, which seems to 
constitute the dynamic and meehanieal factor in each cell. This, un- 
like the chromatin, only comes into view when there is unusual activ- 
ity, as during cell-division, and is not eN'ident (with our i)resent histo- 
logical technique, at least), when the cell is arrested by reagents in 
any of the ordinary stages of metabolism.

I have borrowed from Parker, figures byCariioy, to illustrate the rest- 
iiij4' and active stages of the cell, and from Watase, a Japanese student 
of Clark University, figures representing the high differentiation of 
the cell contents during division (Figs. 8, 9). They bring out the active 
and passive elements of the typical cell. 

The phenomena of karyokinesis which attend the division and dis- 
tribution of the hereditary substance throughout the whole course of 
embryonic and adult development are well illustrated in Carnoy's fig- 
ures (Fig. 7). First we have the quiescent period, in which the chro-

clear membrane; the extra-nuclear substance, or cyto-plasm, is appar- 
ently undifferentiated. As soon as cell division sets in, however, ra- 
diating lines are seen in the cyto-plasm above and below the nucleus; 
these are called the archo-plasmic filaments by Boveri, since they pro- 
ceed from what is now believed to be the dynamic element, the archo- 
plasm (Fig. 8). As the activity becomes more intense the filaments are 
seen to diverge from a center — the archo-plasmic ce)itro,s<>mc^whk-h lies 
just Avithout the nucleus at either pole; this radial disi)lay of cell 
forces suggested the term "asters" to Fol, and ''spheres attractive" to 
Van IJeneden. The behavior of the chromatin, or hereditary substance,

lienee the term mitosis, and then more compact, until linally a number 
of distinct vertical rods, chr<mnitin rods, or clironiasomes are found. 

A remarkable and sioniflcant fact may be noted here, that the num- 
ber of cliromasomes varies in the cells of diffei-ent s])(H'ies, and even 
in the cells of difl'erent varieties (as in the tliread-worm of the horse — 
Ascaris mepahxrpJiala), but is constant in all the cells of the same va- 
riety tlirou|ih all stajies; thus the same number of chrcmiasomes ap- 
pear in the lirst segmentation of the fertilized ovum as in the subse- 
quent cell division in the tissues. 

Carnoy next indicates the veitical sjtlitting of ea<-h i-od into a loop 
or link preceding the horizontal splitting: thus we may conceive of a 
thorough re-distribution of the chromatin before it i>asses into the 
daughter-cells. The split loops are each letracted toward a centro- 
some, suggesting to some authors a contractile i>o\ver in the arclio-j)la8- 
mic tilameuts, each chronmsome being appariMitly withdi'awn by a 
single filament. But as tin' chroma-S(mies separate, the filaments also

really are. The chiomatin is now retra(;ted into two coiled threads, 
each the center of the daughter nucleus with a single centrosome lie- 
side it. r>ut as the line of cleavage is drawn hetween the two cells 
(Fig. !>), the single centi-osome in each cell divides so that each 
daughter-cell is now complete with its chromatin coil and two archo- 
plasmic centrosorm-s. This jnocess has been beaut ifull>' (lescrihcd by 
Watase.* 

rt thus appears thai both I lie chromatiiL and archo-plasm are perma- 
nent elements of the cell, such as we formerly considered the luu-leiis: 
the ai)parently passi^c chiomatin is divided with great jtrecisiou by the 
active archo-plasm, then the archo-idasm sim])ly splits in tw^o to resume 
the clea\age function.

of the well kn(»wn phenomena ])reparatory to the union of the germ 
cells in order to gi\(' gi'cater emphasis to the importance of rec<'nt dis- 
coveries. 

First, the o\um is a single cell, the typical structnic of which, with 
its nucleus and cytoplasm, is ;j;(Mierally obscured by a (pumtily (»f food- 
material, surrounded by a rather dense cell wall. The ovum is said to 
be ripened or "matured" for the reception of the spermatozoon, by the 
extrusion of two small "iiolar bodies," containing lioth chromatin and

liyaline protoplasm, and separating off by kaiyokinetic division. After 
mtituration is complete, a single spermatozoon normally penetrates; 
then a reaction immediately sets in in the cell wall of the ovum which 
prevents other spermatozoa from entering. The head of the spermato- 
zoon and the nucleus of the ovum now fuse together to form a single 
nucleus, which it is obvious contains the hereditary substance of two 
individuals. This is the starting point of the segmentation or distri- 
bution process above described, and it follows tliat the fertilized ovum 
at this stage must contain its typical complement of chromatin, archo- 
l>lasm, etc., for the whole course of growth to the adult. 

How shall we connect these phenomena of fertilization with the 
facts of heredity? The most suggestive enigma in connection with 
the fei'tilization process has been the meoning of tJie two polar bodies, 
especially since Van IJeneden demonstrated that they contained chro- 
matin? ]^\)r twenty-five years, speculation has been rife as to why the 
ovum should extrude a portion of its substance in two small cells; why 
not in one cell ? why not in a larger numl)er? Thanks to the intense 
curiosity which these i^olar bodies have aroused, and to the great va- 
riety of explanations which have been offered for them, we have ar- 
rived to-day at a solution which links the higher animals with the 
lower, breaks down the supposed barrier between the sexes, and ac- 
cords with the main external facts of hereditj'. 

It seems to me best to disregard the order of discovery, and to state 
the facts in the most direct way. First, a few words as to the specu- 
lations upon the meaning of the polar bodies. 

The early views of fertilization* were naturally based upon the ap- 
parent significance of this process in the human species, in which the 
sexes are sharply distinguished from each other in their entire struc- 
ture, and the reproductive cells are also widely differentiated in form, 
the ovum large and i)assive, the spermatozoon small and active. Tlie 
readiest induction was to regard these elements as representing dis- 
tinct T)hysiological xninciples, corresponding to the essential sexual 
characteristics — in short, as male and female cells, the former vitalizing 
and rejuvenating the latter. Thus one of the earliest definite "polar- 
body" theories was that the ovum was hermaphrodite, containing both 
male and female princii)les, and that it was necessary to get rid of ilie 
male substance before the spermatozoon could enter. 

As Von Siebold and Leuckart had demonstrated that some ova re- 
produce parthenogenetically, that is without fertilization by spermato- 
zoa, Weismann turned to such forms for the solution of this problem, 
and Avas surprised to find that parthenogetic ova only extrude one 
polar body. This led him to attach one meaning to the first polar body, 
and another meaning to the second, which he viewed as designed to 
reduce the heredity substaiu;e in the ovum without regard to sex. 
iThus both this and the older theoiy conveyed alike the idea of reduc-

are certainly the most brilliant. After a most exact and arduous re- 
search, extending o\er several years, he collected his results in two 
memoirs, published in 1S89 and 1S!)(). 

His exi)eriments were first directed n])on the laws of direct mnlti- 
plication by fissicm, which revealed a complete cycle of life in the single- 
celled Infusoria and showed that after a long j)evio<l this mode of 
reproduction becomes less vigorous, then declines, and finally ceases 
altogether unless the stock is reiuvenated by conjugation of individ- 
uals from different broods. In other words, these broods of minute 
organisms grow old and die unless they are enabled to fertilize each 
other by an exchange of hereditary substance altogether analagous to 
that observed in the higher multicellular organisms. 

The cultures were made in a dro[» of water upon a slide, and feeding 
was adapted either to the herbiAorous or carnivorous habits of the 
species. Under these conditions it was found that the late of fission 
or direct multiplication varied directly with the temperature and food, 
rising in some species {GJaneoina ftciiitilUois) to five bipartitions daily. 
With the o]»timum of conditions this rate, if sustained for thirty-eight 
days, would produce from a single individual a mass of protoplasm 
equivalent to the volume of the sun. This rate is however found to 
be steady for a time, and then the offs])ring decline into ''senescence," 
in which they appear at times only one fourth the original size, with 
reduced buccal w^reaths and degenerate nu(;lear apparatus. This is 
reached sooner in some species than in others; Stylonichia pustulata 
survives three hundred and sixteen generations or fissions, while Leu- 
cophryH p<it}ila persists to six hundred and sixty generations. Finally, 
even under the most favorable conditicms of environment, death ensues. 

Not so where conjugation is brought about by mingling the offspring 
of different broods in the same fluid, as in tlu^ natural state, Maupas 
soon discovered that exhaustion of food would induce conjunction be- 
tween members of mixed broods. He thus could watch every feature 
of the conjugation process, and determine all the ])hases in the cycle of 
life. These differed, as in the longevity of the species. In Stylonicliia, 
for example, "immaturity" extended over the first oiu' hundred bipar- 
titions: "])uberty,^' or the earliest phase favorabh^ to conjugation, set 
in with the one hundred ami thirtieth bipartition; '-engamy," or (he 
most favorable conjugation phase, extended to the one hundred and 
seventieth; then "senescence" set in, characterized by a sexual hyper- 
a^.sthesia in wiiich conjugation was void of result or rejuvenesence, 
owing apparently to the destruction of the essential nuclear ai)paratus.

Conjugation begins with the approach of two individuals, and adhe-

growth and (li\i(U's by (Mmstrictioii. and tlic (iii) tiiicroiiKchus (paranu- 
cleus, nucleolus, of authors), uliicli i)r('sides over the preservation of 
the species. The hitter contains chromatin; it is the seat of vejuve- 
nescence, the hasis of liere<lit\', it divides by mitosis, sliow inu' all the 
typical stages of kav> okinesis <'xcepting the loss of the cell mendjrane. 

The trausformation iu each of these copulating cells first alfects the 
centers of hereditary substance, viz, the micro-nuclei ; they divide three 
times; thus the micronuclear substance is reduced to one-fourth of its 
original bulk. It is contained in two surviving micronuclei (the others 
being absorbed or eliminated), one of which migrates into the adjoin- 
ing cell: the other remains stationary. This migration is followed by a 
fusion of the migrant and stationary micronuclei; this fusion efi'ects a 
complete interchange of hereditary substance, after which the tw^o in- 
fusoria separate and enter upon a new life cycle. Meanwhile the me- 
ganucleus breaks up and is reconstituted in each fertilized cell. 

Maupas gathers from these interesting phenomena additional ])roof 
that the chromatin of all cells bears the inherited characteristics and 
that the cyto-j)lasm and nucleoplasm, or achromatin, is the dynamic 
agent, because the micronuclei bearing the chromatin are the only strnct- 
iires which are permanent and persistent, all the other structures — 
nucleo-plasm, archo-plasm, etc. — being replaced and i-enewed. The re- 
duction of the chromatin is purely (piantitative, the eliminated ami fer- 
tilizing micronuclei being exactly equivalent; after the chromatin has 
been quartered the cell becomes incapable of further activity until it is 
reinlcrced by chromatin from the copulating (;ell. 

No distinction between the sexes in heredity. — The three laws 
which underlie these iihenomena are: (1) That fertilization consists in 
the union of the hereditary substance of two individuals. (!') That 
before the union the hereditary substance in each is greatly reduced. 
(3) Tliat there is no line between male and female, the conjugating cells 
are simply in a similar physiological condition wherein a mingling of 
hereditary characteristics alfords a new lease of life. As iVIaupas says : 

"Les differences appelees sexuelles portent sur des faits et des 
phenoinenes ])urement accessoires de la fecondation. La fecondation 
consiste iiniquemcnt <lans la, r(''uuion et la (copulation de deux noyaux 
semblables et equi\ alents, mais provenus de deux cellules distinctes." 

In this coiu-lusion as to the secondary and sui)erficial, rathei' than 
fundamental, difference between the two sexes, Maupas sim[)ly con- 
firms the views of Strassbiirger, the botanist, Hensen, R. and O. llert- 
wig, Weismann, and others, namely, that sex has (^.volved Irom the 
necessity of cell conjugation; that even in the higher forms the cells 
born by the two sexes are absolutely neutral so far as sex is concerned, 
the wide difference of form of the germ cells is a result of i)hysiological 
division of labor — the mass and yolk of the ovum having been dilfer- 
entiated to supi)ort the early stages of development while the sperma- 
tozoon has dispensed with all these accessories and acquired an active

vibratile form for its function of reaching and penetrating the ovum. 
Tiie evidence of the Infusoria is paralleled among some of the plants, 
in which conjugation between entirely similar cells is observed. 

The causes finally determining sex may come .surprisingly late in 
development, and according to the investigations of Diising and the 
exj)eriments of Yung* and of Giron are directly related to nutrition. 
High feeding favors an increase of the percentage of females, while, 
ccmversely, low feeding increases the males. In Yung's exi)eriments 
with tadpoles the following results were obtained: 



Females. 



Males. 



Normal percentage 57 

High uutrition 92 



Geddes expresses this princii)le in physiological terms of metabolism, 
that anabolic (constructive) conditions produce females, while katabojic 
(destructive) conditions produce males. 

I think we may now safely eliminate the factor of sex from our cal- 
culations u])on the problem of heredity, and thus rid ourselves of one 
of the oldest and most widespread fallacies. We shall thus, in using 
the terms "i)aternar' and 'maternal" imply merely the distinction 
between two lines of family descent. 

The theory of reduction. — This leads us back to the significance of 
the polar bodies. Van Benedeu's discovery that these bodies con- 
tained chromatin led gradually to the view that they were not frag- 
ments of the ova, but represented minute, morphologically complete 
cells, liiltschli showed that they were given oif independently of, and 
prior to, the contact of the spermatozoon, and, finding in the leeches 
that the first polar body subdivides to form two bodies, ho considered 
them as tormed by true cell division, and containing both nucleoplasm 
and cliromatin. Giard indei)endently reached a similar opinion, as- 
signing an atavistic meaning to tlie pohir cells. Wiutman, in 1878, 
advanced the idea that they represented vestiges of the primitive 
mode of reproduction by fission, while Mark described them as "abor- 
tive ova," 

At this point speculation subsided until it was revived by Weis- 
manii's attempt to connect these bodies with his theory of heredity,! 
already referred to. The whole history is clearly given in E. Hert- 
wig\s masterly memoir upon Ovo and Spermatogenesis in the Nema- 
todes.! Taking advantage of Boveri's discoveries in staining tech-

of A. wefjrdocepJiaht each of the germ cells contains but two chrom;i

this maturation of the germ cells for conjugation is brought about is 
beiuitifully shown in these diagrams, taken from Weismann's essay, 
"Amphimixis." You observe that the nund)er of chromasomes in the 
primary germ cells is four (Figs. 11 and 12, A). Then are fornu-d by 
subdivision the ovum and si)erm "mother cells," in which the chro- 
matin substance is doubled, so that we observe eight chrounisomes

to two rods, or hall" the original quantity. These last clivisious take 
place by karyokinesis, but, as Hertwig poiuts out, they differ from 
typical karyokinesis in the fact that tlie divisions follow so rapidly 
upou each other that the vesicular resting period of the nucleus is 
omitted. Thus, he suggests, is prevented an overaccumulation of 
chromatin substance prior to the fusion of the ovum and sperm.

It is evident that the polar cells arc rudimentary ova, which do not 
possess the yolk nmss, etc., essential to development, and are divider 
off at a very late stage, sometimes after the egg has left the ovary, 
but are in other respects analogous to the spermatozoa. The reason 
these polar-cells have not disappeared altogctlier in either plants or 
animals is that they originally possessed a deep physiological impor 
tance. As the first i)olar cell subdivides and forms two, it follows that 
from both ovum and sperm mother cells four daughter cells are formed, 
each containing half the chromatin substance of a normal nucleus. In 
the ovary three of these daughter cells abort and the fourth forms a 
true ovum; in the sperm gland, however, all four daughter cells form 
spermatozoa. 

We may thus consider the polar-cell problem as in all ])robability set- 
tled; the whole process is probably an inheritance or survival of a 
primitive condition in which all four ova, like the four spermatozoa, 
were fnlly functional. 

The relation between the chromatin and lieredity. — We have just 
seen that the last stages in the preparation of the ova and spermato- 
zoa for conjugation result in halving tlie number of rods in the original 
germ cells. Now, as Hertwig and Weismann point out, one point is

still left ill doubt. Why is tlie cliroiiiatiii sul)staii('e doubled iii the 
mother-cells so that two sueeessive sul)-divisious are necessary to reduce 
it to halt the ori_i;inal ([uaiitity? Ilertwiy; has not atteuipted to answer 
this question, as he prefers to wait for further research. Weismaini, 
however, who is iiiifortuiiately cut off from research hy failing eyesight, 
has offered a spcu-ulative solution to this problem which he trusts may 
guide future investigation. 

This leads me to say a few words in regard to his conception of the 
relation of the chromatin to heredity. ( 1 ) His lirst i)remise is that in fer- 
tilization there is not a fusion of chromatin, but that a certain independ- 
ence is preserved between the maternal and paternal elements, based 
upon the observed fact that the two pairs of rods do not fuse but lie side 
by side, and upon the assumi)tion that these i)airs are kept distinct in 
each cell through all the subsequent stages of embryonic and adult devel- 
opment. If this is the case, the hereditary substance contributed by the 
father would remain separate from that conti ibute<l l)y the mother, 
throughout. (-) " Each of these ])airs would be made up of the col- 
lective i)redispositioiis which are indispensable tV)r the building up of 
an individual, l)ut each possesses an individual character, for they are 
not entirely alike. I have called such units ' amu'stral plasms,' and 
r coiicei\(' tiiat they are contained in iiunil>ers in the chromatin of the 
mature germ cells of living organisms, also that the older nuclear rods 
are made up of a certain number of these. - - 01>viously these 

units <'an not become infinitely minute; howe\er small they may be 
they must always retain a certain si/.e. This follows from the extremely 
complicated stiucture which we must without any doubt ascribe to 
them." These units are not, liowe\ er, ultimate, they are in turn ex- 
tremely complex, and are composed of countless biological units of the 
kind conceived of by Njigeli and otlu^rs. (3) The rechiction of the chro- 
matin only ac(piires a meaning when taken in connection with the 
above supposition of distinct ancestial i^lasms, and has no meaning 
if we accept llertwig's view that there is a complete fusion of nni- 
ternal and paternal germ plasm. This meaning is that redu(;tion in 
the maturation of germ cells is siii gcnerUs^ it does not divide the ances- 
tial plasms into two similar groups, but one daughter-cell receives one 
set of germ plasms or hereditary predis])ositioiis, and another daughter 
cell receives another; reduction is thus ditferential. According to tiiis 
view the four sperm and ovum daughter-cells would each contain a 
different set of ancestral jdasms. (4) The fact that the chromatin sub- 
stance is doubled in the sperm and o\uiii mother-cells, so that we ob- 
serve double the number of rods characteristic of the species, is to be 
explained as an adai)tation to the re(piiremeiits of natural selection, 
^or this doubling and subseiiuent double di\'ision render possible an 
inhnite numl)er of combinations (as many, in fact, as there are individ- 
uals) for selection to operate uixtii. 

This explanation of W'eismann's is an example of ids apotheosis of 



366 PRESENT PKOBLEMS IN EVOLUTION AND HEREDITY. 

the theory of natural selection. Every process is made to suit this 
theory, which, as we have seen in the first and second lectures, is, in 
his opinion, the exclusive factor of evolution. But this very high de- 
gree of mingling" and re-mingling of ancestral predispositions would be 
fatal to evolution, for after a combination favorable to survival had 
been estal)lished in one generation it would be broken up into a new 
combination, x)erhaps unfavorable, to survival, in the next generation. 
This entire essay upon "Amphimixis," or the theory of mingling of re- 
duced hereditary substance, will, I believe, mark a turning point to 
decline in Weismanu's influence as a biologist. His whole reasoning 
is now in a circle around the natural selection theory. 

The meaning of conjugation. — VYeismann looks upon sexual repro- 
duction as designed to mingle hereditary tendencies and to create in- 
dividual differences whereby natural selection may form new species. 
It is evident that these combinations nuist be mainly fortuitous and 
l)roductive of indefinite variation; but we have seen that evolution 
advances largely by the accumulation of definite variations, or those in 
which each successive generation exhibits the same tendencies to de- 
part from the typical ancestral form in certain parts of the body, and 
that these tendencies stand out in relief among the diffused kaleido- 
scopic or fortuitous anomalies. 

The fact moreover that variability and evolution by the accumula- 
tion of certain variations in successive generations is also observed 
in organizisms which reproduce asexuallij, both among plants and 
animals, shows that we must look in another direction for the under- 
lying cause or purpose of sexual reproduction. Weismanu rightly com- 
bats the old idea of " vitalization" of the ovum by the spermatozoon, 
and it is perfectly evident from the researches of Maupas and Hertwig 
that the ovum may as accurately be said to vitalize the spermatozoon 
as the reverse. Fecundation is simply the approximation of two 
hereditary substances of distinct origin and their incorporation into a 
single nucleus. The action and re-action of these substances may be 
considered equal and mutual, so far as we now know. 

The remarkably ingenious ex}>eriments of Hertwig and Boveri, above 
alluded to, strengthen this idea. Some years ago Weismann wrote: 
"If it were possible to introduce the female pronucleus of an egg into 
another egg of the same species, immediately after the transformation 
of the nucleus of the latter into the female pronucleus, it is very prob- 
able that the two nuclei would conjugate just as if a fertilizing sperm 
nucleus had penetrated. If this were so, the direct proof that egg- 
nucleus and sperm nucleus are identical Avould be furnished." Boveri 
succeeded in accomi)lishing a similar feat by depriving an ovum of its 
nucleus and subsequently causing it to develop by admitting a sperma- 
tozoan which fertilized the denucleated ovum and produced a complete 
iu dividual. 

In opposing the vitalizing properties of the sperm, Weismann how-

ever went ruitlier, and advocated the view tliat tlicrc is notliiiii;- in the 
iiatiiic of \ italizatiou or ''reiuveiiesceuce" in coiijiiuatiou — that, liiveu 
proiK'i- oii\ironiiieiit, protophisiu i.s immortal, and runs upon a course 
of undiminished activity. This we have seen is not the casein the in- 
fusoria, aiid, as recently remarked by Ilartog, there is only one class 
of organisms wliich. according' to our i)resci!t knowledge, are com- 
pletely agamous and immortal — namely, the Mouadiiia. It may in 
future ap]>ear that e\'en in the monads there is a cycle for the develop- 
ment in which conjugation plays its i)art. 

Maupas' experiments seem to establisli the i)rimitive, and therefore 
the true, interpretation of the purpose of conjugation as Avell as of sex, 
the latter being a ctmsecpience of the former, namely, that after a h)ng 
])eriod of direct subdivision of hereditary material from a single in- 
dividual, a limit is reached beyond wliich the forces of heredity are 
not reproduced in their original intensity unless cond)ined Avith another 
set of similar fin'ces of different origin. This combination restores 
the original intensity. It is objected to this that two sets of feeble 
forces can not constitute one vigorous force, but this is met by the 
observed fact that such union does start a new life cycle, and is there- 
fore rejuvenescent. ^Va may regard this as the fundamental meaning 
of conjugation, and the production of variations as entirely secondary. 

The distribution of the chronuitin. — We have now reviewed some 
of the main i)henomena of fertilization; there still remains the relation 
of the hereditary substance to the future develo])nnMit of the individ- 
ual. There is, lirst, the astonishing fact that, as the chromatin goes 
on diA'idiug, its mass or volume remains ai)i»arently undiminished; 
that is, there is apparently as nuich chromatin in one of the many 
million active cells of the body as in the original fertilized ovum, and 
there is still an eingma as to the nature of this cliromatin and its 
functions. Secondly, there is the x)i"oblem of the maternal and i)ater- 
ual elements in each cell; do they lie side by side or are the.\' Insed '. 

1. In plants DeVries* and others believed that all or by far the 
greater number of cells in the plant body contain the total hereditary 
characters of the species in a latent condition. Kollikert has fully 
discussed this question and called attention to ^Miillers early views that, 
in spite of the physiological division of labor ])roducing the tissues, 
the properl ies of all the tissues <*an be derived from the nuclear sub- 
stance of a single tissue, as ju'oved by experiments upon the lower 
animals. Weismann, on the other hand, has held that the course of 
development is marked by a constant qualitative disrril)ution of his 
germ-])lasm or hereditary substance, so that, so far as luu-lear content 
is concerned, there are thiee forms of cells: (1) with nucleo-plasm; 
(2) with nucleoplasm and gei'm-plasm; (.'}) with germ-i)lasm only.

368 PRESENT PROBLEMS IN EVOLUTION AND HEREDITY. 

Kolliker opposes this idea and maintains that the " idioplasma " passes 
into all cells, in which it divides in course of development. Step by 
step from tlie embryonic Liyers to the tissues, the constructive proc- 
esses are under the direction of the nuclei containing this hereditary 
substance. It remains in every nucleus for along period unaltered, in 
order to finally, here earlier, there later, impress its constructive forces. 
In certain elements, as in blood corpuscles, epidermal scales, etc., it 
disappears, as the last product of division. 

E. Hertwig takes a similar view. Since embryonic and adult cell 
division is differential, there must be a form of differentiation in the 
nucleus; but this does not consist in the total elimination of some 
qualities and survival of others, nor of a reduction in mass. The 
mass and the properties remain the same in every cell ; the differen- 
tiation consists in the activity of certain elements in certain tissues. 
Thus we may say with De Vries that different "pangene" may leave 
the nucleus and enter the cell in different tissues; or with Niigeli, that 
special '^micelhe" come into activity at certain points; in other words, 
the potential of the nucleus is differently exerted. Here again we 
have the idea of patent and latent hereditary elements, such as appear 
in the entire individual upon a larger scale. 

This is one of the most interesting jn-oblems for future investigation, 
but the direction of research will, I imagine, cover a larger area of 
cell content than the nucleus, as we are now swinging back to regard 
the extra-nuclear archoplasni as an important factor in the process. 

In the following paragraph Hertwig expressed his vie\v of nuclear 
control and cytoplasmic differentiation : 

"As I saw in the transformation of the nucleus during fertilization 
proof that it is the bearer of hereditary substance, I recognized a great 
advance in the fact that the nucleus leaves in the same form in every 
cell, and in its vesicular capsule is somewhat removed from the metamor- 
phoses of the cells. As JSTiigeli spreads his idioplasm as a net- work 
throughout the whole body, so, according to my theory, every body- 
cell contained in its nucleus its quota of hereditary substance, Avhileits 
specific histological peculiarities were to be regarded as its plasma 
products. " 

2d. The next question is the fate of the maternal and paternal con- 
tributions to the embryo. Here there is a wide difference of opinion. 
On the one side Van Beneden is the leader of those who regard each 
cell of the body as in a sense hermaphro<lite; as we have seen, his views 
of maturati(m and the significance of the extension of the polar bodies 
were colored by this theory, for he regarded the germ cells as hermaph- 
rodite until one sex was eliminated. But now that the researches 
of HertAvig have given the last blow to Van Beneden's theory, and it 
follows that there can be no nmle and female chromasomes, there still 
remains room for the analogous view that the maternal and imternal 
chromasomes remain distinct throughout the course of development, 
not as sexual elements, but as substances with the same racial and

specific bill (liMciciit iiulividual Iciidciicics. K'libl. an cmiiicnr oin- 
bryologist, shares this \ic\\ . and it is suitpoitcd by BoNcii iipou the 
observation that in each (li\ ision tlic paternal and nniternal elements 
are kept distinct, and in .iscdris. lor cxani]>le. two of the cluoinasomes 
of each divisittn Hjinre are paternal and two are maternal. 

In favoi- of tills hypoth(\sis Ave may jtlace the following,' facts: 1st, 
that there are an even nnmber of chroinasonie rods in all cells; 2d, that 
the number is constant throughout all tlie snbse<iuent changes in tlie 
tissues; 3d. that tlie iunnl)er is fixed for each si)ecies or variety; 4th, 
that the number is the same in each s<'.\. 

Against this replacement hypothesis we must consider the extreme 
complexity of the division process, and tlie hmg-resting, or thread 
stage, in Miiich the chromatin lies in a confused coil. Further. Hert- 
■\vig argues that if the elements are distinct we should find some evidence 
that the mateiiial or ]»aternal part is a troi)hied or replaced, or excluded 
from the nucleus, fctr botli parts can not share alike in the control of 
the ceil. These are llertwig's grouuds for supporting the ''verschmel- 
sungstheorie."' or fusion theory, also advocated by Waldeyer, to the 
effect that l)y the complete union of the maternal and paternal sub- 
stance a new product is formed; in this fusion the law of pre-j)<>tency 
may come into play", causing one or other of the parental tendencies to 
predominate, or there may be an even re-distribution, whereby, as ex- 
pressed by llensen, ''the hereditary substance of the son is not that 
of the lather plus that of the mother, but is his own, with a new heredi- 
tary form resulting from the combination."' 

While suspending Judgment between these two views as ro the sej)- 
aration or fusion of the chromatin, wo may appeal to the external 
l^henomena of heredity for light u]>on the probabilities in the <piestion 
First, 1 refer to the very decided opinion of Francis Galton in regard to 
])articulafe inheritance; he is so impressed with the fact that we are

stroiig:ly against this as a universal principle, for many maternal and 
paternal structures are preserved in their absolnte integrity for gener- 
ations without the least indication of mixture. 

Cell forces and heredity. — We have thus far been considering only 
the chromatin as the heredity substance p((r excellence, and have dis- 
regarded for tlie time the archo-plasm or dynamic material of the cell. 

If we advance upon the hypothesis that a typical cell contains the 
more or less passive chromatin, and the archoplasm playing- upon this 
chromatin in conrse of every phase of re-distril)ution, it seems a priori 
improbable that elements which are associated with every vital change 
should be dissociated in the phenomena of heredity. We might supi30se 
that the mechanics of karyokinesis are exactly similar in every cell 
of one individual, but it is highly improbable that they should be ex- 
actly similar in two individuals. We should therefore anticipate the 
joint transmission of the chromatin and archoplasm, implying by the 
latter the dynamic centers especially connected with hereditary function 
as distinguished from the general functions of metabolism. 

This leads us to look for evidence from the lite of the cell in its 
totality. We owe to Dr. Max Verworn* a fresh treatment of this 
subject, based upon experimental researches among the Infusoria, 
mainly by the extiri^ation method. As his experiments included only 
the phenomena of living- cells in which the chromatin substance was 
of course undifterentiated to the eye, he treats of the nucleus as a 
wliole without distinction as to chromatin and achromatin. lie con- 
cludes that the physiological importance of the nucleus is exhibited 
in its constant interchange of materials with tlie remainder of the cell 
body; only through this interchange does it influence the cell and 
control its life processes. The interchange is in triple currents, «, 
from outside of cell to cyto-plasm; b, from cyto-i)lasm to nucleus; c, 
from nucleus to cyto-plasm. These movements of interchange are the 
expression of life phenomena. He compares the role of the nucleus to 
that of a cell organoid, like chlorojjhyll, as not constantly present but 
as invaribly necessary to activity. Thus he believes even the most 
lowly organized cells have nuclear centers, and that even bacteria are 
differentiated into nuclear and extra-nuclear areas. Coupled with this 
idea of nuchvar control is the somewhat paradoxical statement that 
the nucleus is not a dynamic center, either automatic or regulating, 
and the conclusion that the nucleus alone cannot be the seat of fer- 
tilization and heredity, but both the nucleus and extra- nuclear pro- 
toplasm must c( >nstitute the material basis of heredity. This conclusion 
is in the direction of the general reaction of opinion which is now 
taking place against the centralization of cell-government in the nucleus. 

Vague as they nnist necessarily be, our ideas of cell forces are some- 
what further detined by the brilliant experiments of the llertwig

sugg'estiou as to the (causation ol" abnorinalities in inlieiitance. These 
were Iteyiin in 1884, and were first directed to the intlncnce of gravita- 
tion npon the plam^s of embryonic cell division, foHowinii- up the ex- 
periments of Plliiiier and Ifauber. In 1885 the conditions of bastard 
fertili/at ion were studied; in 1887 the causes of i)olyspermy or mul 
tiple fertilization; and in 18110 the effects of extreme lieat and cold 
u])on j>erm-cell functions.* In general the conclusions reached were 
that in the normal state there exist regulating forces in the ovum which 
prevent multiple fertilization or bastard fertilizations (/. c. by sperma- 
tozoa of other varieties), but these forces are neutralized where the 
life energy of the cell is diminished by reagents or by extremes of 
temj)erature. 

For example, in the normal state the entrance of a single s})erma- 
tozoon produces a reaction in the ovum wall ])reventing the eiitiance 
of other spermatozoa, but when the ovum is Meakened by chloroform 
solution two or more spermatozoa enter before the reaction aj)pears; in 
fact that degn'c of polyspermy is directly proportional to the intensity 
of the chemical, thermic, or inechaui(;al disturliance of the ovum. 
Double fertilization or over-fertilization has not in a single case resulted 
in tlie productiiui of twins, so that l^'oFs sup])ositioii is negatived, 
although other forms may behave differently. The cell function may 
be arrested at any stage by thermic intiuenccs; thus two pronuclei, 
l)aternal and maternal, alxmt to unite, can l)c held apart by lowering 
the tem])erature, i*olyspermy also results from a lowered tempera- 
ture. It is noteworthy that the conditions of bastard fertilization and 
polyspermy arc different; chloroform produces the latter but not the 
former. Ku])ffer has, I believe, smx-eeded in producing twins, or 
rather two headed monsters, by abnormal fertilization in tishes. 

These researches, although made with a different ol»jcct. i('-estal)lish 
the older views as to the inter-de))cndcnc<'of nucleai- and extra-nu(;lear 
activities, and show that no sharj) line oi demarcation of function can 
be drawn between the nnclcnsasa center !>f rcpr(>dnction and heredity 
and the cytoplasm, as the seat of tissue building and nutrition. In

l)hcnomena of heredity in the following manner: 

While the union of the nuclei in fertilization is the most obvious 
featun'. this union is dependent upon the archoplasm, which re-arranges 
the nuclear elements. If the spermatozoon contains no archo])lasm, 
this power can not come from the ])arental side; but Uoveri shows that 
this is probably not the case and that the si>ernuitozoon brings its cen- 
trosoine with it. thus entering the ovum with both the parental chro-

from the observations of Roux that the sperm cell is iio-w to be regarded 
as more than a mere nucleus, that it contains l)oth uuclein and para- 
iinclein. 

Intercellular forces. — The forces within the different ])ortions of the 
cell lead us to consider those which must exist between different cells. 
This is an obscure question at present; but, as I have observed in the 
close of the second lecture, it is an extremely important one in connec- 
tion with the problem of heredity. 

As Prof. Wilson writes: "My own conviction steadily gro\rs that the 
cell is not a self-regulating mechanism in itself, that no cell is isolated, 
and that AVeisman's fundamental j)ropositi()n is false." 

It is a long step between an a priori conviction and the demonstra- 
tion by experiment of a correlation of force-^ between the cells. This 
seems to me a most important lield of experiment. We have seen in 
Maupas's work that the cojitact of two infusoria initiates a rajiid 
vSeries of internal changes; we have only to c(mceive of analogous 
changes taking place when two cells are not in actual contact, as in 
the phenomena of previous fertilization leferred to in my second lec- 
ture. Hertwig and others have shown how gravitation is related to 
cell activity. Roux has destroyed half an embryo with a hot needle in 
the first stages of segmentation and followed the other half through 
the stages of subsecpient development. Another clever experimenter 
has turned fertilized ova u})side down during the early stages of 
develo])ment, and shown how the protoplasmic pole and yolk pole 
forcibly change places. Driesch has traced the connecti(m and mean- 
ing of the first plane of cleavage in the embryos of echinoderms, and 
has succeeded in raising a small adult from half an embryo artificially 
se])arated during the first cleavage stage. Wilson, in the larva of 
Nereis, has shown liow a <'ertain stage of division in one group of cells 
affects all the other groups. All these experiments are in the line of 
determining the relations which exist between internal cell forces and 
other natural forces. What we must now seek to deternune is the 
relation of cell to cell throughout the body, in connection with the 
phenomena of heredity. 

Convlutiious. — Perhaps the most impressive result of our review of 
recent researches in evolution and heredity is the uniformity of life 
processes throughout the whole scale of life from the infusoria to man. 
The most striking analogy is that seen in the laws of fertilization and 
conjugation, which are shown by Maupas's researches to have been 
established substantially in their present form at a very early period in 
the evolution of living organisms. Such uniformity furnishes a powerful 
argument for the advocates of the study of biology as an introduction to 
the applied science of medicine. Much that is now entirely omitted 
from medical education, because it is considered too remote, is in reality 
at the very roots of the science. To understand the disorders of life

we should tirst tlioiouulilN' uiuU'istaml the t'ssnitial plieuoineiia of 
normal life. Of course we shall never see life as it really is, because 
there is always something beyoiul our highest magnifying ])owers; but 
we come nearest to this invisible form of energy when, with such 
iiivestigat(n's as Hertwig and IVIaui)as, we strip the life processes of all 
theii' accessories and view them in their simplest external form. 

The problems of evolution are found to be inseparably connected with 
those of heredity. No theory is at all adequate which does not ex])lain 
both classes of facts, and we have seen tliat the explanations offered 
by tlu' two oi)posed schools — those who l)elieve in the transmission of 
acquired chara<'lers and those who do not — are directly exclusive of 
each other. We should suspend Judgment entirely rather than cease 
to gather from every quarter facts wliich bear upon the most important 
and central i)roblem of the transmission of acquired characters. 1 
have endeavored to ])oiut out the opportunities which medical practi- 
tioiu'rs enjoy of contributing evidence upon tliis mooted (juestion. It 
must not be forgotten that while the inheritance of individual adapta- 
tion to environment is the simplest method of e\i>iaining race 
adaptation such as we observe in the evolution of num, we know abso- 
Intely nothing of how snch inheritance can be effected through tlu^. 
germ cells. We can not at present construct even any form of working 
hypothesis for such a ]>rocess. On the other hand, we have found how 
untenable is the alteiuative theory offered to us by Weismann, that it 
is solely natural selection or the survival of the Attest which

At the same time Weismann's concei)tion of it continuity of germinal 
protoplasm, which we ha\-e fouiul to consist in chromatin i)lus archo- 
plasm, helps us over many of the phenomena of heredity, especially on 
the retrogressive side, and if it were not that we nuist also account 
for progressive and detiiiite transformation in heredity, we miglit credit 
the distinguished Freiburg natui alist with having loosened the Gor- 
dian knot. 

In summing u|>, the order of treatment (bllowed in the lectui'cs may 
be reversed, and we can begin with the germ cells, and condense the 
more or less ascertaincil facts. 

The germ cells: 

(1) The material substance of hereditary transmission is the liighly 
coloring proto]>lasm. or chromatin, in the nucleus ol' the germ cells, 
probably connected with a certain form of archoplasm. or dynamic 
protoplasm outside of the nucleus. 

(!') Before conjugation and i'ertilization the hereditary substance 
of both the male and femide cells is leduced to one-half tliat found in a 
typh-al cell. This substance is iu)wever hrst doubled and tlien (juar- 
tered, the meaning of which process is not understood. 



374 PRESENT PKOBLEMS IN EVOLUTION AND HEREDITY. 

(3) There is a difference of opinion as to whether the paternal and 
maternal hereditary substances, during- fertilization, are fused or lie 
side by side; also as to how the substance is distributed through the 
tissues, whether en masse or by qualitative distribution. 

Heredit.y : 

(4) No connection between the germ cells and body cells is knoww, 
but the facts of heredity seem to render such a connection theoreti- 
cally necessary. Several classes of facts connected with reproduction 
seem to support this theory. 

(5) The facts of heredity sujjport the theory of a continuous and 
specific form of protoplasm as the basis of repetition of type. 

Evolution : 

(0) The facts of evolution, both in x)resent and past time, point to 
transformism by definite progression toward new types of structure 
in succeeding generations, opposing the retrogressive forces of heredity. 

(7) The theory (natural selection) of definite progression by the 
accumulation of fortuitous favorable variations is found to be not only 
theoretically improbable, but not to correspond with the observed laws 
of variation. 

(8) The laws of variation (anomalies) lend support to the theory of 
hereditary transmission of individual acquired variations, but even this 
(Laniarckian) theory encounters many difficulties. 

1 think this is as fair a statement as can be made at the present 
time, and it rests upon a general survey of the whole field.

The annual nii<>Tation of birds has at all times attracted the atten- 
tion of thinking' men but in very different ways. Thus this ](henonieuon 
awakes in the simple peasant other thoug'hts than in the man of cul- 
ture: the poet and the naturalist look upon the returning flocks with 
other feelings than the hunter. Xatural philosophers hnally take up 
the migration as a very complicated problem for investigation. They 
regai'd it however from different points of \iew. and accordingly the 
(juestion is treated in dissimilar ways. 

Linnc admonished natural philosoi»hers to observe the migration 
of birds. But this colleeting of data could not be done methodically 
before the necessity for simidtaueons oliservations over greater areas 
ha<l nnide itself felt by the examination of geophysical questions, 
ami in this direction a program was practically carried out. Quetelet 
then in the year 1S41 asked that the changes in living nature also be 
noted in a compreliensive and regular manner, and his countryman de 
Selj's-Longc'hamps proposed to collect exact data specially on the mi- 
gration of birds. This repeated warning was now obeyed with zeal.

376 REPORT ON THE MIGRATION OF BIRDS. 

When the new impetus on the side of physicists and climatologists 
became felt, the inquiry assumed adequate form. The arrival data 
were considered like other climatological observations, and treated in 
the same manner as the notices on temperature, air pressure, etc., with 
the view of finding an expression for the climate of the corresponding 
regions. The bird of passage was regarded as a complicated ajiparatus, 
by the observation of which the climatological problems could be ex- 
plained in certain relations. 

Zo(>logists however could not permit the bird and its migrations to 
be regarded merely as a means to serve other purposes, but both con- 
stituted independent problems in themselves, dependent only in certain 
respects upon climate, etc. It was asked therefore how the question 
was to be examined in this regard; and, as may readily be conceived, 
methods were for the time being suggested which the climatologists 
had already perfected. 

Consequently the "climatological" material of data about the arrival 
and departure of the birds assumed the character of an avi-phenologi- 
cal material. By its proper treatment, it was desired to fix the course of 
the migration of the species of birds; and with this view first of all an 
efibrt was made to determine its tiuie, in order to judge first by that of 
the direction of the migration. Two means were now available: 

(1) Either data of arrival from one year only were to be used, because 
only such can be compared with one another (Kessler, 1852, South 
Eussia) ; 

(2) Or from as many years as possible, in order that the errors of 
observation, unavoidable in any case, could be mutually corrected. 
(V. Midden dorft', 1855, Russian Empire.) 

Both conditions were very difticult to fulfill, the former however, 
easier than the latter. 

At all events, both methods offered a good view of the gradual prog- 
ress of the bird species, as heretofore of that of the increase of tem- 
perature and similar climatological i)henomena, but hardly anything 
more. The conclusion that the migration takes place at right angles to 
the isopipteses seemed justified; but, with regard to the direction of 
the bird's migration to be ascertained, could not possibly prove more 
exact than the premises themselves, the methods of inquiry, and the 
material. 

As a reminder of the '-climatological" conception of the x)roblem 
and of the citrresponding methods, something medium, something of 
arithmetical mean values had to attach to the result, which however 
did not exist in the phenomenon itself 

For the migration of birds is by no means a meteorological but a 
biological phenomenon. The (piestion is about the advance of living 
individuals, who move according to their own will. Their paths must 
be investigated, and tiie result of this inquiry must be given much 
more exactlv than the advance of the spring warmth. For, since the 



REPORT ON THE MICiKATIOX OF BIRDS. 377 

iiidvidual cau ])ass over only one line of lui.uratiun, riie (|Uosti()n arises 
whether flocks of individals. and even the whole species, can not in 
the same manner foll(>^^' fixed rontes which snit tliem. Otlierwise, how 
does it happen that ceitain species appear in numbers ever_\ Near in 
fixed phices without showing- themselves in the neighborhood .' How 
comes it that the single individuals at last find tlieir way back to their 
old nesting places ? The climatological methods do not suffice to answer 
these questions; others must be applied. 

As in any comi)licated problem, tlie order in which the different sides 
of the question are taken up is not a matter of indifi'erence; for the 
knowledge of some of its sides indisputably" heli)s to an understiinding- 
ofcei'tain others. Which side of the phenomenon of nugration is to 
form the scaffold f Which must be understood first, in a measure at 
least, betbre the other (luestions can be pro])er]y asked, much less 
answered. 

In fact, a ]irincii)al problem of the investigation falls within the 
domain of zod-geography. for it must, first of all, be established irhich 
roiiie the species takes before the time required to travei'se this route 
and other circumstances connected with its passage can be considered. 

Sunderall pointed out emi>irically the course which the investigation 
had to take when, in the year 1871, he made known the routes of migra- 
tion of the ci'ane in Europe. 

With the conviction that only a systematically considered investiga- 
tion could explain the migrations, the writer examined the (pn'stion 
(Palmcn, i'lhcr /Ur Zu(/.strasscii dcr Vofjel, 187J:, 187<») with ])arti(nilar 
regard to oidy a small number of hyperborean s])ecies. It seems neces- 
sary to go into the (|uestion step by step, and first of all to fix the route 
of those species of biids whose migrations seemed i)roper, to place in a 
clear light the methods of investigation to be employed; for in this 
relation it is not possible to com])arc all species of birds nor all the 
regions penetrated with one another. 

In the choice of the zod-geographic, and therefore of the avilaunal 
material to be em[)loyed. two different gToujJS of facts es])ecially pre- 
sent themsehes. 

(1) Either the general migration of dilferent species would !ia\eto 
be investigatetl, which is known to ha^•e awaketied theniost intense 
interest of observers in many places; 

(:.') Oi" every individual s)»ecies is to be followed separately tlir(»ugh 
all the regions which it \ isits in its migration. 

The enormons masses of nugratory birds which j)ass through certain 
uarrow-bonnded regions long since attracted attention, for all descrip- 
tions from those regions are highly i)ictures(pu' and eiitertaiidng. 
Nevertheless, these rather touch onr sentiment than our i-eason. 'I'hey 
leave the cpiestions whence; f whither? why? un-answeie<l, simply be- 
cause each species can, proi)erly speaking, answer these <piestions only 
in its own manner, but we ourselves can not separate and undei'stand

the iudividual voices. The wliole thing must therein »re api)ear to us 
as a complication, though a very interesting- one. 

Here also, then, an average answer is of no use, but the whole must 
be closely analyzed. This however can not be attained by study of 
the general migration. Just as a tangle of threads can only be loosened 
by getting out the single threads, so out of the net-work of migratory 
routes, that is out of the "highway," the separate road of each species 
of bird must be picked out and followed. And this work pre-supposes 
the knowledge of the last named, which however can only be acquired 
where the migration assumes a simpler aspect. 

The existence of narrowly limited roads, ramilied in a characteristic 
manner for each species, was felt beforehand by zoologists avIio, in their 
investigations, depended upon the less productive climatological meth- 
ods. Thus in admirable manner von Middendorff compared the routes 
of sejiarate species of birds with the different forms of shrubs and trees 
which were drawn on the paper. The leaves correspond to the nesting- 
places, the branches are to compare with the routes, and the roots with 
the winter quarters. On the map the shrubs would bear their foliage 
not far from the roots drawn somewhat more to the south ; the trees — 
likewise ramified, but of lofty growth — would take a higher place; and, 
uuramified, some gigantic stalks would jut out, which on the map take 
root in Egypt, but with their branches shade the coast regions of the 
frozen sea, beyond the tree limits. 

With the indispensably necessary geographical determination of the 
routes of separate species of birds, all reliable local faunas, as well as 
smaller lists, must first of all be used as material for investigation, and 
moreover, all notices of isolated discoveries of a species of bird in places 
which the migration jjasses. Such isolated notices and minor works 
are indeed the extreme roots of the inductive zoo-geographic inquiry. 
Out of the entire ornithological literature therefore a comparison is to 
be made of all accounts of the appearance of a species of bird. Coun- 
try after country must make its contribution, and for each district a 
separate conclusion must be drawn for the species in question, and the 
result added to that of the next district. 

The writer's investigation of the migration of some birds breeding in 
the Arctic regions, carried out on these principles, yielded certain re- 
sults which need not be here considered in detail, but it may perhaps 
be well to note some of the main points. 

During the migration, these birds do not by any means take any di- 
rection they please, nor do they follow everywhere one and the same 
direction, perhaps a "general migratory route." They rather follow 
well defined, geographically bounded ways, whose bends depend pri 
marily ujion the topographical relations of the regions. Other not more 
accurately examined species of birds also act in the same or an analo- 
gous manner; since their migrations, taking place almost everywhere, 
are to be traced to extremely ramified routes. The routes of migration 
may be grouped into several categories accordiiig to their character. 



REPOiri' ox IHi: MKa.'ATION OF BIK1>S. 379 

Tlu' order of iiii.urarion of the iiidniduals iiia_\' !)»■ icdnced to two 
simple types: (1) wlieiv a miiiiht'i' of individuals move from one place 
to aiiotlier without <lianjiiii<;' their relative i»ositious (uaclieiuauder- 
zug); (2) where the relative positions are chaMu'ed, some moving- more 
rapidly than others (voriihei'-zug): with all transitions between the 
two. 

The irregular migrations also are to be distinguished from the regu- 
lar, and the stray visitors are to be considered in harmony with this 
princii)le. These stray visitors can essentially contribute in the spring 
in different ways to the extension of the breeding district. 

Theoretically the origin of the migration instinct beconu's somewhat 
more comprehensible tlian before; and the explanations found might 
be fit to cause a new discussion alxait the phenomenon of migration. 
This conception of the )>articulars of the migrations met with appro- 
val on nniny sides. Nevertheless the voice of ,Mr. E. F. von Ilomeyer 
was soon raised against it, from whose work ( />/f' Wditdcnnu/cii dcr 
Vogel, ISSl) 1 lune l)rought together tlie following lea-ding views:* 

Birds usually migrate in a fixed direction, — in the greater part of 
Europe essentially from northeast to south-west. The maintenance of 
this direction de])ends on the birds' sense of direction. 

The i)assage of a i)articular si)ecies extends over every single point 
within its migration district; for the birds fly so high in the air that 
the direction of their liight becomes independent of the topogra])hy of 
the ground. From this height they perceive suital)le resting places, 
where they can repose or stop. J>y combining such i>laces, the pre- 
tended migration routes are constructed, which by no means correspond 
to the facts. The birds do Jiot move along linear routes, at least not 
along coast ways. They move with an extended front, everywhere. 

(July in isolated places are the l)irds compelled ])y in.surmountable 
obstacles, lik«' high mountains, to deviate from the general direction, 
and to collect together in larger numbers at one point than at another, 

The erroneously so called stray visitors have by no means gone 
astray. They are simply rare birds, which, owing to the inconijth'te- 
ness of the obseivations, are overlooked in most ])laces. 

All theoretical speculations (m the migration are to be r<je(;ted. 
Tlu'y are not only useless, but directly injurious: because they oidy 
forestall the real observation of nature, and, instead of adv'ancing 
knowledge, merely oi>en the door to fancy. The tendency to construct 
hypothetical migration routes for the birds has sprung from the now 
l)opidar endeavor to trace everything back to the Darwinian doctrine. 

In later years llaitwig ibllowed E. \'on llomeyers conception of the 
course of the migration {Jonni. f. Ornlth.. bSSo, ]>. 127: comi)arealsoHar- 
tert, J.f. Ornith., 1887, p. ^ol and 1889, [). 234). 

The writer had already in the year 1882 published his "answer" to 

* This is done with all reservation, for there are still isolated places in the work 
where the above views, formerly snbscribed by the author named, are still held. 



380 REPOKT ON THE MIGRATION OF BIRDS. 

the antlior of the "migrations". That conception has at all events its 
authority as the personal opinion of the renowned author. It could 
however be fully accepted only in case it. were founded upon a material 
of communicated focts, and conclusions had been reached from these 
in a strictly logical and conscientious manner. Because, however, these 
conditions were wanting, a purely scientific examination of the views 
given could be made only with difficulty or not at all. The discussion 
could only take the form of a personal defense, wliich could at all events 
somewhat clear up the question, dulled by the manner of the attack, but 
could contribute little to the further elucidation of the problem itself. 

A little attention will suffice to show that the writer had neither 
subscribed to narrow ''linear'' routes for "birds" in general, nor the 
existence alone of coast and river ways. He maintained above all that 
the individual species of birds do not move irregularly, and also that 
each species is not obliged to follow a fixed direction in the sky. They 
act according to the local and continental relations of the ground, and, 
besides, each species according to its own nature. 

There are then also species whose routes go through narrow plains, 
and which spread out here as far as the space permits. The migration 
routes likewise often lead through regions where these species find 
am])le scope and can choose suitable roads within wider l»ounds. The 
migration lines of individuals and bauds group themselves then in 
bundles, which, according to circumstances, branch out and run to- 
gether again, and the individuals do not here confine themselves so 
strictly to fixed places, as in the narrow bounded sections of the route. 
In such wider roads, as may readily be conceived, a wider front is 
also developed. Even our opponents seem to allow that here also cer- 
tain obstacles situated on the flanks prevent the unlimited extension 
of the individual routes. How many species of birds exist, which are 
not at all dependent on the conformation of the ground and on the 
resting places, can not be decided beforehand. 

Every species, every variety, and every form ditfering in the slight- 
est respect must therefore, if possible, be treated separately. A com- 
plex of species are to be examined together, which in the migration 
agree somewhat geographically. Thus in certain respects a want of 
material in some species can be to some extent supplied by analogies in 
others. Accordingly an average treatment of heterogeneous species can 
not be justified in a special scientific investigation of n)igration, and in 
a region where the most dissimilar species are known to follow one and 
the same direction or road, this surely has its cause in topographical 
conditions which perhaps lie further and are only perceptible in the 
whole mass. The importance of such highways to the problem of mi- 
gration was discussed above. 

A "universal direction of migration," which perhaps all the sjjecies 
of birds in the expanse of whole continents should follow, does not, 
therefore, correspond to a well founded conception of the phenomenon 
of migration. It is likewise evident that in aH exact scientific discus-

sioii a special (leclaratioii for "birds'' in general can claim no scientific 
A'alue. Such genei'al expressions are to be avoided, becanse tliey may 
easily lead astray. 

As already remarked, the \ iew of Ihe existence of geograpiiically 
defined routes of migration began to prevail gradually, and almost 
simnltaneously with the completion of the writer's work similar state- 
ments appeared from the most a]>])roved qnait<'rs, for example, from 
^Vallace and A. von Midden(h>rff. The writer can not omit to mention 
that in a personal interview he received the fall approbation of the last- 
named veneral)Ie in\'estigator of Siberia. The ap])roval of Ang. Weis- 
mauu may be regarded as of great importauce with regard to 'MvMogj 
in general, and tinally, Radde's well-known statemeut "that every- 
where on earth the direction of the migration intinmtely depends, and 
is even dictatorially conditioned, on the relief of tlie laiul which the 
birds pass" (1884). 

For the continued investigation of the phenomenon of jnigration in 
the sense above mentioned, it seemed absolutely necessaiy to obtain a 
large quantity of obsei-vations from the most different places. For in- 
definite acccmnts of the oceniTence of the species of l)irds in greater 
districts permitted no reliable conclusions regarding the local extent 
of the migration routes. It rather seemed desirable to obtain immer- 
ous observ*ations on the migration, repeated eveiy year. Just as is done 
in the study of meteorological ])henomena. 

For these reasons Mr. Keichenow. at the spring me<'ting of the Uni- 
versal (xerman Ornithological Society in Brunswick, on May !il*, 1875 
{Journ.f. Ornlt/i., 187."), p. .'U7), ])(>inted to the necessity of collecting 
observations on the migration of birds according to a uniform plan in 
diverse regions. It was then referred to a committee to })romote the 
inquiry. 

The calling into existence of this committee for obser\ation stations 
ofthebiids of (iermany is known to the world; as also its annnal 
reports, which have appeared since tlie year i87(> in ever increasing- 
size, and whose editing has icllected the greatest credit on Prof. 11. 
Blasius and Prof, A. ]\eichenow. It is also fnrtln'r known how this 
example of (Iermany found imitators in Austria-Ilnngary, the observa- 
tions made there being first (1880, 1881) lecei vcd in the CJernnm 
reports, then from the year 1882, a])peai'ing indei)endently. 

Every ornithologist is also acquainted with the progress of develo])- 
ment of this question in (ireat Britain, where observations were begun 
from the year 1879, especially in the light-houses, and published an- 
nually. 

lndei)en(lentl\- of these elforts, investigations of faunas of dirCerent 
small ami large tracts, as well as of general migrations, were started. 
More will be said further on about these, as well as about the magnifi- 
cent arrangements in North Anunica,

distributed in most countries and observations collected, as appears 
from the following- short summary.

The first annual reports (1876-'81) contain only the special observa- 
tions. In accordance with J\Ir. E. F. von Homeyer's wish {Journ.f. 
Ornith., 1880, p. 357), a general volume lias since 1882 been sent in ad- 
vance, wherein, by bringing forward some examples, a picture has been 
given of the time of migration of the year in question. To this gen- 
eral description of the migration was added a short review of the me- 
teorological incidents of the year with reference to their influence upon 
the course of the migration. 

The observations were at first made for each species, mainly with 
reference to the biological i)henomena (arrival, breeding, dei^arture, 
wintering). The new impetus of the year 1884 brought changes in 
this respect also. Tlie necessity for editing in a simpler manner the 
increasing mass of observations became apparent. The geographic 
arrangement of the notices was chosen, by which at the same time 
local faunas were restored. To facilitate inquiries, the countries were 
arranged in alphabetical order, with all their greater political depend- 
encies. 

Since 1886 it has been the intention of the committee to construct 
maps showing the geographical distribution of the birds of Germany. 
Such maps have already appeared relating to three species {Corvus 
comix, G. corone, C. frufjUegus; prepared by iVIatschie). The committee 
also intends to establish the migration routes of certain birds in the 
German territory. 

At the annual meeting in September, 1888 [Jonrn. f. Oynith., 188J), 
p. 00), the instructions for observers were somewhat changed, and 
drawn up again as clearly and briefly as possible. The observations 
relating to this matter, especially m tlie KiiTgdoni of Saxony, are edited

REPORT ON THE MIGRATION OF BIRDS. 



From Iceland a rejjort has appeared (1886 ; Orw/.s-, ii, Grondal), wlierein 
28 species are designated. 

Giitke lias published three auniial reports on the migration of birds 
on the island of Heligoland, in the form of continued diciry-notes (Jan- 
uary, 1884 — December, 1880) on the weather and on the observed species 
( Onws, i-iii). Furthermore R. Blasius published (riitke's work "Die 
Vogelwarte He]ig<dand", wherein are i)reserved the results of fifty- 
three years' observations of the circumstances of the migration of the 
birds on this remarkable migration station {Ornis, yii, p. 132). 

Some reports appeared on the migration of birds in Holland :

Three numbers of communications of the ornithological commit- 
tee of the Iloyal Swedish Academy of S(!iences, })iepared by Sundstrom 
and Smitt, contain the observations made l)y 107 correspondents in 
Sweden during recent years up to 1886. 

From the Russian Baltic provinces, especially Livonia, E. von ^lid- 
dendorff has sent three annual reports, 188r)-'87 [Oniis). 

Abstracts of the pheuological observations made in Finland have 
been published by Ad. Moberg {Ofv. Finslca Yet. Soc. Fiirh.) for a num- 
ber of years; and in the years 1878-'80, arrival data in tabular form 
for 12 species of birds at 31-68 stations have been published. The re- 
mainder is still being pre])ared for publication; also a cxunpreheusive 
materia] of observations which were sent to the writer in reply to a 
summons of the year 1885. Out of this material, oidy a few local 
faunas have been published by way of ])reliminary. 

We may here remark that in most of the other countries of Europe 
and in some isolated states out of Enrope, it has been resolved in prin- 
ciple to join the above mentioned effiu-ts, and some observations are at 
hand ready for printing, while in others the way has been prepared 
for this accession only by a few calls to the friends of the birds. 

The investigations on the migration of birds in Great Britain have, 
as is known, taken a form consonant with the insular character of the 
territory. At the instance of the British Ornithologists' Union and with 
co-operation of the Britisli Association for the advancement of Science, 
observations were commenced at most of the British light-houses and

dividual observations in nine "■ Reports on the Migiati<»ii " ( \S70-1S87), 
as Avell as in a brief re])ort which lias been made annually to the asso- 
ciation. 

Alread.N' in 1881.' these notices pro\ed tne wonderful constancy with 
Avhich the birds of passage' year after year follow the sanu^ lin<'s or 
great routes when they approach or abandon tiie Britisii coasts, and 
this constancy points to a detinite law go\erning the wiiole plienome- 
non. Two se])arate migrations may ])e distinguished: tiie great periodi- 
cal Ava\es which sweep from the breeding places in the far northeast 
and return; and fiirtlu'r. (piile iiidei>eiideiit of these, a constant stream 
of immigrants, which moves from the continent toward the south- 
eastern and eastern coasts of Kngland, across the southern ])art of the 
Korth Sea in the direction of «'ast to Avest or from southeast to iiortli- 
west. On the other hand, the west coasts, and especially Irehind, are 
comparatively seldom visited by these birds of ]>assage. 

Nevertheless, the str<'am (»f migration (188(>) does not strike e(|ually 
all points on tlie east coast of Kngland, l)ut ai>i>ears constaiitl\' to 
follow fixed lines, l^'or exami)Ie, the Fame islands on the coast of 
Northumberland, as also the mouth of the ri\er Tee, apjx'ar to be i>rin

parts of the coasts further to the south. To the north of Xcu'folk, 
tlie migratory birds apjM-ar to ])enetrate through the \\'ash into the 
interior of England tow ard Severn, Bristol Channel, and still further 
westward. 

it is fuitiiei- pointed out tiuit the vertical lieight at which th<'- flights 
take place must be accurately noted*, and that the liglit ships api»ear 
to yield a l)etter s<;ries of obsei'\ations than the light-houses. It was 
also ascertained that only certain si)eci«'s were attracted by the light, 
and th()se in an unecpuU manner. The special direction and force of 
the wind (1887; ap[)ears to exert onl>' a small inlluem-e on the great 
autumn ruslies; but the direction of the wind which prevails during 
the passage in general, seems to i)lay a more important part. — the 
direction of tliejournex' and tiie angle of the route to the coast lieing 
to a great extent dejx'ndent upon it.

on the Atlantic Ocean. Observations on the subject are noted on the 
most fre([Ueiited lines of communication, and also made (»\er to the 
e(»mmit1ee. 

The moK' the pul>lisiied matciial accumulated, the more desirai)le it 
seemed to utilize the whole mass in forming conclusions. This was 
already referred to in the rejiort for Ihe year 1887. It was further pro-

posed, iu tlie year 1888, that the (•olle<;ting of observations should be 
stopped temporarily, tliat tlie immense mass of facts iu the nine re- 
ports, arranged in concise form, statistically, and in strictly scientific 
manner, might be treated as briefly and clearly as possible, in order 
to attain practical scientific results. This proposal was accepted by 
the British Association in the year 1888, and a member of the commit- 
tee, Mr. W. Eagle Clarke, charged with the duty of directing the com- 
prehensive undertaking. 

The British example exerted a deep influence on the First Interna- 
tional Ornitliological Congress iu the year 1884. Through the eftbrts 
of the authorities of the permanent ornithological committee of the 
Congress, the wish was communicated to as many state gov^ernmeuts as 
possible that the passage of the birds might be observed at the light- 
houses. The authorities of these institutions are also charged to ad- 
vance the question as much as possible, from the White Sea to the C'as- 
pian. The light-house officers on wide tracts of the coasts of South 
Asia, certain parts of Africa, Australia, and South America are in the 
same manner called upon to make observations. 

As yet, h<^wever, we have but few printed reports from the light- 
houses, except from Great Britain. These few are the ones above men- 
tioned from Denmark, 1886-'81), ami two reports on bird life at the Ger- 
man light-houses, published by E. Blasius (Orni,s, vi, vii). 

In Xorth America the investigations relating to tlie migration of 
birds liave assumed quite an indepeiulent form and reached considera- 
ble dimensions. 

In tlie year 188:2 Prof ^\ ^\'. Cooke took the initiative with a sys- 
tematic observation of the migrati(m of birds, at first in the State of 
Iowa, butlater in the whole Mississippi VaUey. Thirteen observers were 
at work the first year and twenty-six in the year 1883. But after the 
American Ornithologists' Union had been organized in September of 
the last-named year, it appointed a committee for the investigation of 
the geographical distribution of the birds of l^orth America, as also 
another for the in\'estigation of the migration of birds. The two were 
however consolidated later on. By the co-operation of this committee 
with Prof Cooke, the iuA'estigations were continued systematically un- 
der the direction of Dr. C. II. Merriam. The whoU' territory Avas di- 
A'ided into fourteen, later sixteen, districts, each under a superintend- 
ent; and for tlie year 1884 thousands of question-sheets and instructions 
were communicated to members of the most different social groups, as 
well as to all light-houses and other public institutions. 

As it was to be expected that the homogeneous territory of the 
Mississippi Valley, in consequence of its immense extent from north 
to south, and the absence of mountain range or great lakes, would 
aftbrd a particularly favorable field for the investigation of migra- 
tion, the observations coming from there for 1884 and 188.") were 
taken in specinl cliargc by Tiof. Cool<«'. 



KEPOKT OX THE .MIGKATIOX OF BIRDS. 387 

III the iiieaiitinie, tlie obscrvjitioiis collected liad reached such a 
quantity that it did not seem Judicious to expect the Union alone to 
elaborate the material. At its instance, a special DiAision of Eco- 
nomic Ornitholoji^y was i'stablished by the Con.uress ot the United 
States ill the Department ot Aiiricultur«>, at hrst under the Division 
of J*]ntomology, and Avith an annual subsidy of •fr),00(). Since the 
year 1886 it has operated as a separate Division of Economic Orni- 
tholoii'v and Mammalogy, with an annual a])])ropriation of $10,000. 
Economically supi)orted in this nnumer, and under direction of Dr. 
C. H. ]Merriam. the prosjterity of the institution is assured. 

In the year 1SS8 the Division issued a most excellent i)ublication 
on the mijiTation of birds: lleport <ni IJird Migration in the ^lissis- 
sii»i)i Aalley in the years 1884 and 1885, by W. W. C<K)ke. Fn this 
work are subnutted the data which 170 observers collected respecting 
.■)()() species of birds. The author also shows his method of investi- 
gating the relations of the phenomenon of migration to the prevailing 
meteorological phenomena, by which method he has extensively 
utilized the syno})tically grouped observations of the meteorological 
stations existing in the territory 

The old experience that weather exerts an impoitant intluence on 
migration was now definitely confirmed. Prof. ( -ooke proved that the 
atmospliericcentersof depression, moving from Avest to east inthespring, 
accordingtothelawsof mc^teorology, and which are characterized by cor- 
respomling phenomena of wind and tem))eraturc. produce in every re- 
gion changing relations <»f temperature, nanudy, alteinate warm and 
cold periods, whiidi changes are accompanied by dehnite nugrati(m 
phenomena. A ''warm wave"' in the atmosphere of the region in 
([uestion is also a necessary condition for the beginidng of a ''bird 
Avave," '•migration waxc.'" whose further progress is clu'cked by the 
occurrence of a cold ])erio<l until a new warm wa\<' again jtushes it 
forward and gi\es i-ise to otheis. 

Prof. C<»oke s]»ecilies the time of thes<' waves for Hie period cliosen 
(1884) and for the territory in (juestion. He e\i)ressly states tiiat his 
investigation, on account of certain circumstances, is not a complete 
one, and that smdi a series of observations must be well prepared, and 
carried out besides under favorable condit i(»ns. •' Pnder such adverse 
conditions no attempt would hav'(^ been made to study the bird waves 
were it not for the extreme importance of the subject. It is (hiring the 
nights of bird waves that tln^ bulk of migration takes place. To study 
migration successfully it nnist be studied when most active. More- 
over, it is on bird waves that the action of the weather is most appar- 
ent; hence thesis waves furnish the readiest nu'ans of studying the ic- 
lation between meteorology and migration. The greatest drawback is 
met with in the difficulty of ac(!urat( iy observing and re])orting bird 
Avaves. It is by far tlie haidest i)art of the iield \\(m1< in the study of 
migration, and re(|uires more time and more constant iiresence in the 
held than most observers can give,'' 



388 REPORT ON THE MIGRATION OF BIRDS. 

It is furtber pointed out by Prof. Cooke that the expression " bird 
wave " may be taken in a double sense, and consequently answers to 
two methods of investigation. First, a bird wave comprises a very 
large number of individuals of one or of several species, which extend 
at one time over a certain territory. In studying such a wave it is 
necessary to determine the species of which the moving mass is com- 
posed and the bounds of the territory over which the wave extends. 
Second, certain species of birds which are proved to move in company 
on the same day may also be regarded as a wave, whose progress from 
day to day and from week to week must be accurately observed. 

By a critical study of these points of view and by a conscientious 
use of the meteorological and ornithological observations which em- 
brace a precise time and a precise region, the rapidity of the migra- 
tion, on which so much has heretofore been written, can be calculated. 
Only by attentive observation and multifariims labor can the migration 
be folloAved until the moving flocks haAe reached their resting places. 

It is evident that Prof. Cooke's investigation of migration over a long 
continuous route, apart from all unavoidable sliortcomings, must be 
particularly adapted to elucidate migration with respect to its course 
and its outward conditions; and that it is very desirable that similar 
investigations may henceforth be undertaken in suitable regions. 

This course is opposed however by the difficulty of iintling a suffi- 
cient numbei' of capable observers. Prof. Cooke has beeu able to rely 
in essential degree upon one conscientious and expert observer, Mr. 
O. Widmann, of St. Louis, whose methodically arranged notices he 
submits in his work. In this connection the writer will only quote the 
words of a comitetent Judge: 

''A dozen observers like Mr. Widmann, scattered at projjer intervals, 
would give a fairer basis for generalizations than hundreds of observers 
of the grade on wlioni Prof. Cooke was obliged to depend for many 
of his data. This should stimulate the more experienced and well 
qualified fiekl ornithologists to contribute to the fullest degree i)ossible 
to the furtherance of this important investigation. — J, A. Allen, The 
Aid; 1889, vi, p. (>1." 

The continiuHl meteorological phenomena were rendered in the usual 
manner by synoptical ma])S, which alone made a view possible, and es- 
sentially facilitated the study of the influence of weather on the migra- 
tion of birds. It may not therefore be injudicious to here refer to an 
attempt to lepresent graphically the migration of birds and the com- 
jjosition of the avi-fauna, changing with the season, as Mr. AV. Stone 
has proposed (Aiili, yi, p. 139). 

Besides this material of observations, made chietly with a view to 
explaining the problem of bird migration, numerous faunal works 
have appeared — minor local catalogues, and comprehensive works on 
the birds of larger definite geographical areas, prepared with con- 
scientiousness and intimate knowledge. ]^o one perhaps can value 
these avifaunal works more highly than the writer, with regard to their

importance for the (Ictciiiiiuiition of tlu' nii.^iMlioii routes, l-'xteinal 
circurastanccs forbid us to uotice all these works here, althouuh they 
may be worth it, like those of Radde. I'leske, Olph-dalliard, Oustalet, 
Uresser, aud others, aii<l notwithstan<liuj;- they coutaiu mauy sin}j;le re- 
sults, many ^'aluabh' thou,i>lits on bird ]ni<>Tation. 

On the other hand, it seems proper to here call attention to some 
special investigfations on bird migration in certain i-ejjions, founded on 
avifauna! materiak 

Some i)laces have lon^' been known in the western portion of our 
eontinent where miiirating- birds collect in crow^ds because obstacles 
situated on the side, like seas, allow a passage here only; or, like 
mountain regions, only here leave the door open. Such highways have 
l)een examined farther eastward in regions which are impoitant for the 
migration between great districts. 

From his comprehensive observations in the years lS.')7-79 in the 
Aral-Thian-Shan region, X. Severtzow has given us (BnlL dcs Nat. Moh- 
coir, 1.S80,) a very brief view of the highways where the greatest 
numbers of birds of ])assage eongregate. lie designates cartograph- 
ically three gTou])s of such routes: A, through the Kirgheez steppes, 
from the river Tral to the Sir, characterized by the enormous number 
of merely passing birds; B, along the western border of the Thian- 
Shan mountains, distinguished l)y a tolerably large migration, and by 
the circumstance that the nati\ e summer birds give way to winter 
guests: and C, through the interior ])ortions of the range mentioned, 
known chiefly by the annual change of species Just alluded to. The 
wintering on the routes P> and (' is owing to the warm s])rings existing 
there. 

Severtzow mentions fuithcr the coniie<'tion of the i-outes nami^l 
with th(^ kiu)wu migration routes along the Irtish ami the Ol) on the 
one side; on the other with their pi'esumptive continuations in T'ersia, 
Afghanistan, IMiuJal). and in tlie region of the Indus, lie designates 
tin- Altai as a region whence tlu' migration rcuitcs diverge: in the 
southwest towaid llussian Turkestan: in the south towards the des- 
ert; and in the southeast towards Ohhia. The movement of the birds 
of ])ass;ige in a vertical direction from the highland of Thian-Shan 
and i*ameer towar<ls the low grounds is :ilso suggested l)y him. 

Ivcferring to the details to be s])ecified later, Severtzow here com- 
nuiincates sojue general jtoints of view (pp. 282-284). The course of 
the stepi)e routes depends on the existence and situation of the waters 
in them. On the other hand, the general extent of the lofty Thian- 
Shan range compels the flocks moviDg: at a short <listance from it to 
follow a general direction from <'ast northeast to west southwest; 
therefore, great masses of birds of passage are |»ressed together on 
the western border of the range (Tschemkeud-Tashkend), while these 
juasses can si)read out again to the northward, as also to the south- 
ward. 



300 IJEPORT ON VHi: MIGIUTION OF ]!IRDS. 

"Tliis divergence toward llie iiortli (mor<' oi- lews eousiderable) de- 
pends essentially upon the fact that each species has its particular 
routes, the direction of which is modified according to the nature of 
the localities which suit this species, and which it seeks also during its 
migrations, at least for stopping places; and for this reason the migra- 
tion routes even of a single species, starting from different parts of 
the region which it inhabits in snmmer, are not parallel, but for many 
species convergent towards the south, for many others divergent. 
This iip])lies much more forcibly to the routes of a luimber of species 
wliich, in the season of migration, concentrate in some locality i)ar- 
ticularly almndant in birds of passage." 

The author therefore categorically maintains that the individual 
species, according to their jjeculiarities, are dependent on the topo- 
graphical relations of the territory through which they migrate, and 
that the rontes of each species accordingly assnme a particular 
geographical form. 

In the same spirit Prof. Menzbier also reports (1886, Bull. Soc. 
Nat. Moscow) on the results of his investigations on the migration 
routes of the birds in European Russia. He unconditionally joins 
those inquirers who maintain that each si^ecies moves along peculiar, 
strongly marked routes, because during the migration they are de- 
pendent upon the condition of the country through which they happen 
to be passing. He agrees in dividing the routes according to their 
topographical character into categories, which, however, are compli- 
cated by transitions. 

He also lays stress upon the fact (pp. 333, 351) that the relations of 
the ground and the conditions of procuring food do not always suffice 
to explain the situation of these routes ; but that the routes mark 
fairly well the ways along which a species has once migrated, and 
tliat about the same ways are still utilized as a result of inherited 
tendency. (Compare on this sul)iect the writer's Zngstr., cap. x, as 
also Weismann.) 

Menzbier furthermore refers (p. 354) To the importance of the spring 
stragglers (comi>are Palm<''n, Ziif/str., ix, p, 238 -v^ .sr^/.), which under 
favorable circumstances may remain in a region where they have ar- 
rived by chance, and, nesting there, may chq^uge the bird fauna in a 
characteristic manner, Finally the author discusses the order of 
migration of the individuals, and appears to favor tbe belief that the>' 
change their relative positions (Yoriiberzug). lu conclusion, he de- 
clares that migration routes in the course of time, in consequence of 
geological changes in the topography, may pass from the compass of 
one group into that of another, 

To these results, which agree with those of the writer. Prof. Menzbier 
adds corrections of some of my statements and conclusions, which are 
worthy of acknowledgment. The conclusions reached in the years 
ISli-lO respecting the migration routes were founded on tacts which

eertiiiuly sullice in a mca.suiL' lor tlu' wcblcrn and ccutrul poitioiis ol 
Europe, but not for European and Asiatic Eussia. The more abundant 
iiiatcrial of observations now a\ailable from tlie latter contiuontal di.s- 
tricts shows tliat the coMclusions based mainly on the oro-hydro^raphic 
conditions in the West do not fully answer for the more eastern parts 
of the i)ala'ar('ti(' rej^ion, whei'e the ground takes another form, ^lany 
species of binls (for examph', Ihvnidtopus, Sfrcp.sihi.s, Totanns ralhlri.s, 
Jjimosa rufa, Phalacrocorax carho), which in western Euroi)e mi.<iiat(i 
alouft" the seashore, breed and miiiiate also in the interior of continental 
IJussia, along- rivers, salt lakes, and on the stepi)es. Jhnchhi (/lacialis 
moves regularly along- the Kama and the Volga, as well as behind the 
Tral, along- the lakes — is even said to nest here — and Avinters on the 
Cespian Sea. These l)irds belong, therefore, in the East, to the groui> 
.si(h)n<(rinoffuvi<>-I((cii.sf)rs. 

Accordingly, Prof. Menzbier distributes the birtls of passage in some- 
what different manner. He thinks that glacial littoral routes do not 
exist,* and g-r<mps the accepted routes als(> in another manner in the 
different categories. The following table shows the respective ari-ange- 
ments of the last-named Mriters:

After Prof. Men/bier lias in tliis way fOiisidere<l and group«Ml his mi- 
gration routes from the standpoint of their peculiar to])ographical char- 
acter, he dicusses them with regard to their geograithical ])osition. 
The author designates on two mai)s the rimtes of Kuropean Ilussia 
found by him, basing his work on his consid<'ral)ly greater material 
from that country — greater because new observations were at his dis- 
posal, and above all because he has brought nu)re southern species 
also within the scope of his investigation. 

The cpnistion therefore is less about routes of individual si)ecies, for 
the author himself says ([). .'520) he has i)aid little attention to such.

31)2 KKPORT ON TME MTGliATION OF JilRDS. 

tliiiii about routes of coiuniuuicatiou (highways), which lead certaiu 
iL>roiii)s of migratory birds from their habitats in EuiO]>ean Russia to 
their winter stations. This aheady appears froiu the names of the 
routes: Vi(( iK)rice</iea, Via baltiea, Via jxmtien, Via casjyica. These 
all follow, at least partially, greater bodies of water, but receive their 
supplies also from the interior of the country. All the ways on the first 
map correspond more or less directly to the routes which are settled 
u]^on in the writ<M''s work. 

On the other hand, Prof. Menzbier's representation contains entirely 
new assertions about tlie continental routes (map 2). According to 
the writer's method — but without giving fully the material of observa- 
tion, which is now indispensaV)ly necessary — he has studied the habi- 
tats of 13 eastern species of birds with reference to their geograph- 
ical distribution, and finds this explicable only by the assumption of 
certain migration routes, which he designates upon the n)ap without 
claiming to have thereby exhausted the question (p. 349). In the text, 
he completes their continuation towards tlie east. The routes are pro- 
vided with names in the same sense as those before mentioned: (1) 
Via sibirica begins in the northern half of European Russia and passes 
in an easterly direction through the Siberian plains, on one side to the 
sources of the Ob and Irtish, on the other side to Lake Baikal, along 
the northern slojte of the Ekta-Altai, <mt of Dauria in a straight direc- 
tion towards Urga, and through Gobi to the Ala-Shan. A branch goes 
besides to the Kuku-nor. Individuals for example of JiJw&^^myr a areola 
from European Russia might winter in southern China, and those from 
southeastern Siberia might pass through southern China to winter in 
East India. (2) Via turkestanica also leads from the northern half of 
European Russia, and from western Siberia, but towards the southeast, 
between the Caspian Sea and the Thian-Shan (therefore in part Sev- 
ertzow's highways), to the winter quarters in northwestern and central 
India. (3) Via fraiiscaspia, (partly coinciding with T". caspia), leads to 
winter (juarters on the southern side of the Caspian Sea and the stepi)es 
lying to the east of it, as well as probably to the ui^per Oxus and 
the sources of tlie Imlus. In eastern Asia this way might in part co- 
incide with the Ma siitirica. (I) Via anatolica leads out of the Kirglieez 
and ( 'almuck steppes to the Black Sea. through the Bosphorus to Asia 
Minor, Syria, Palestine, and northern Arabia. 

As a matter of course, Prof. Meuzbier has founded these assertions 
on the material which was at his disposal. The facts themselves were, 
however, as before stated, not laid before the reader in detail, but in 
short abstracts, accordingly all his conclusions relating to the posi- 
tion and the ramifications of these routes are withdrawn from all con- 
trol, and from any improvement in consequence of newly discovered 
facts. It is therefore quite impossible for the writer to judge scien- 
tifically these routes of Prof. Menzbier. Only personal opinions, formed 
according to analogies, can be entertained on this subject; and the 



KHTOKT ON rilK .MKJKATlUX oF r.lKl)S. ,'V.>.') 

writer will by ii<» iiicaiis pass oW liis oljjcctioiis as critically \vei,i;lie(l 
refutations. 

These coiitiiieutsil ways appear to iiic in a i^reat part very (loubtfiil. 
The routes from west to east esjx'cially aie of an enormous length, 
like that from the Dwiua to South China, lead entirely through the 
interior of a continent, without the guichMicc of a homogeneous well 
characterized conformation of soil, and touch alternately great forest, 
desert, and mountain regions. It is ditticult to conceive how birds of 
passage could liiul their way (ui this route. It seems much more prob- 
al)le that we know too little Just now about the occurrence of the species 
examined, some of which are difficult to distinguish, and that their 
winter stations are eventually to be sought nnu-h nearer, at the most 
in the regions whither Severtzow's routes lead. In the meantime, I 
will not venture upon a scientific Judgment in this respect until the 
author submits the facts on which his opinions are based. 

After this short statement of the developiueut of the question of the 
migration of birds, the writer takes the liberty to cast a retrospective 
view upon it. Tn the study of the migration of birds, two kinds of 
material for investigation present themselves — the avi ])hen<)logical and 
the avi-faunal observations. Since the hrst-named were collected for 
this very purpose, it was at hrst thought that the investigation should 
be commenced on this side. The avi-phenoh»gical material explains 
the times of migration, and from these results an attempt was made to 
infer the directions of the migration. Nevertheless these results a]t- 
peared too inexact to serve as a starting point for further investiga- 
tions. An attem])t was therefore made to take the op])osite course, 
first to fix the migration routes from the avi-faunal material, and after- 
ward to emi)loy the method Just mentioned with reganl to the times of 
migration. 

An attem])t to fix geographically the routes (►f souu' spe<*ies of birds 
l»roved that the (luestion could be advanced in this way. Tlie need 
for more abundant material now made itself felt, and new observations 
were zealously collected year after year in difiereut countries. 

It must be coiuicded that at present very considerable energy is 
devoted to the investigation of the distribution of birds and of the 
secrets of their migration. The annual reports, which contain obser- 
vations from numerous stations, are nudtii)]ying. This gratifying 
increase in the material of facts which are to extend and deepen our 
knowledge of migration, is characteristic of the ornithological in(piiry 
of the past years. It is to be desired that these efibrts may continue 
and may be further completed, and that in conse(|uence the (piantity 
of material shall go on increasing. Nevertheless the coiulitiou of af- 
fairs may also examined and judged from another side. 

In such investigations the quantity of observations will certainly 
not aloiu' decide the (piestion. The material is also to be treated 
scientifically. The inner coniu'ction of the facts and their litness to 



394 HEPOKT ON THE MIGRATION OF BIRDS. 

form a basis fur couclusious must be tested, in order that we may judge 
whether the method adopted is adequate or whether it can be com- 
pleted in any way. 

It seems liigh time to consider tlie matter from this point of view 
also, if the scientific cliaracter of the investigation, and with it its pur 
pose also, is not to be laid at stake. 

That this conception is shared by others we know from the fact that 
the result of nine years of British observations is now subjected to 
scientific treatment whose results will surely advance our question; 
further, from the fact that in Xorth America, in a region where the 
conditions of the ground offer only small difficulties to the judgment of 
the direction of migration, an investigation of the time of migration 
and of the relation of the migration to the meteorological conditions 
has been undertaken, which has disclosed new points of view. The 
systematic observation of bird migration along certain lines, started in 
Hungary in the year 1800, and a statement of which is expected on 
occasion of the Second International Ornithological Congress in Buda- 
Pesth, also affords proof that we are not now satisfied with mere obser- 
vations alone, l)ut want these used scientifically, and that hereby new 
demands will surely be made of the observation in future. 

Because therefore at present the existence of geographically fixed 
routes for the individual species is becoming more and more acknowl- 
edged, and these are to be determined from the material at hand, it 
seems timely to discuss the question according to the method to be 
employed. 

Two different methods seem to present themselves, both of which 
have tlieir advantages and disadvantages : (I) The migration routes 
of all the species of a certain district are examined by the investi- 
gators of that district and reproduced cartographically : (2) One species 
for itself is examined monographically in the largest possible geographi- 
cal area and reproduced cartographically. 

The first method ofl'ers many advantages. The workers concerned 
are masters of the language of the district, and the entire local litera- 
ture is accessible to them, even to the most insignificant writings. 
They can judge of the reliability of the observers at each station, exer- 
cise a final control, and complete certain points by correspondence. 
At all events the native inquirers will thus be able to more completely 
group all the facts from a given country, as well as to watch over them 
critically. In the second case the monographer can study more closely the 
species treated by him, then special variations, their nature, as well as 
also the specific peculiarities of their flight. He will perceive more read- 
ily the difference in the flight during the successive sections of the 
route, or on different routes; in short, the route as a whole can be 
judged in a more exhaustive manner. 

In the first method the following disadvantage becomes apparent : 
that in every country, unless it is a very large country, we get only 



KEl'OKT OX THE MKJKATKJX of P.lK'D.S. 395 

frag'ineuts of mij^riitioii r<mU'.s, wliicli peiiiaps can not lie bi(m<;ht into 
continuity with those of the neighboring" regions. On the other hand, 
ditiiculties will arise in the second case regarding the vise of the literary 
soar(;es of information. It would seem therefore the most ])raeti('al. if 
by a combination of tiic two methods the advantage of eac^li conld be 
kept in view. 

In a practical view, it wonld l)e advantageous if in every country 
all accessiWe data on the occAirence of all the species met with in the 
region should be brought together into a national avifauna, in which 
details also could be accurately specified in concise form. Although 
the writer by no means under-rates the imj)ortance of such a work to 
the poi)ulation of the country itself, yet attention must be called to the 
general advantage which science might deri\ <' from the transhitiou of 
such a work into other modern languages. As a model work of this 
kind. 1 take tiie liberty to nanu' Ph'sl<e\s Oniithtxirajtliia h'ossini. 

It would also be very much to the ])ur]>ose if at tin' same tim* the 
habitat of the individual species conld Ix' indicated cartographically, 
as has already been done in (rermany and iSwit/.erland. By such Mork 
the investigation of migration routes would be greatly facilitated. The 
morecomplete the material athand, the more suitable api)ears the method 
of determining the route of each species for itself. At least the Mi'iter 
would unconditionally give the preference to this nu'thod. 

Finally we come to the question of the distribution of the work. The 
writer takes the liberty to urge once more that a choice b(> made of 
species to be investigated, because at i)resent we art^ still at the thresh- 
old of the iuvestigation, and it seems advantageous to tii'st take up 
the less difficult species. Among all the categories of ]»irds of passage, 
the littoral without doubt move along tin- routes easiest to be deter- 
mined. .Vmong the continental, on the other hand, those which avoid 
high mountains, like the swallows and their congeners, might be easier 
to study, 

Oue more di\ ision of work ajtpears to me ad\ isal>h'. Since e\ cry in- 
quirer is specially iutereste<l in the species of his own country, it might 
be suitable tor the northerners to imcstigate theii- s|)ecies with regard 
to all their migration routes, the southerners in like manner theirs; fur- 
ther, that the eastern si>ecies of the pahearctic region should be taken 
up by thos«' who are masters of the literature rcdating to them. That 
the chief interest of the Americans is directed towar<ls tlu'ii' (»wn 
species, they have already proved by the fa<t. 

In ascertaining the migration routes of a si)eci«'S. it woidd be indis- 
jtensably necessary to record all facts whicii (contributed to the result; 
then only can the conclusion drawn from such premises, the migration 
route, claim real validity. The (;artographic representation of the ma- 
terial, when at all possible, is highly to b«' recommended. 

A model ]>rocedur(^ for the investigation of the individual species 
can not be prescribed. It is rather to be exi»ected that eacii in<|uirer will 



.'ii)G RliPoRT ON THE ISIIGlfATION OP BIIiDR. 

learii souiething from the practical methods of the otliers. The maimer 
of representation will then develop of its own accord. 

In conclusion, it is hardly necessary to call attention to the fact that 
a very inviting field of inquiry, in the same direction as tliat entered 
upon hy Prof. Cooke in America, is open to those ornithologists who 
are sufliciently versed in practical meteorology. It is however to be 
foreseen that the phenomenon will be much more complicated in Eu- 
rope, and that for this reason the investigation is to be commenced witli 
those species whose routes have already been fixed geograpliically with 
some degree of certainty.

AN OKNITIIOLOGR'AL HSSAV <>N THE FLIGHT OF LUKDS.

INTRODUCTION. 

If there be :i domineering, tyrant thought, it is the conception that 
the i)roblem of lUght may be solved by man. When once this idea 
has invaded the Inain, it possesses it exclusively. It is then a haunt- 
ing lliought, a walking nightmare, impossible to cast ott". 

If now we consider the pitying contempt with which such a- line of 
researcli is appreciated, \\a may somewhat conceive the unhappy h>t 
of the i»oor investigator whose soul is thus possessed. 

Many of these searchers, either thr«mgh pride or through timidity, 
have witlnlrawn themselves from human intercourse, and have found 
themselves paralyzed by attempting to carry on their ex})eriments in 
secret. They (piickly found themselves so cavalierly classed as dream- 
ers eras lunatics that they were compelled, under pains of complete 
discredit, to conceal from others this so-considered Haw in their intellect. 

It must however Ik; acknowdedged that this persecution has mucli 
diminislied (Uning the past decade. We are no longer classed with 
the seekers for the «piadraturc of the circle, or for perpetual motion. 
There has been progress since Charles, Janssen, (,)uatrefages, and 
other recognized scientitic authorities, have been l)o]d enough to atiirm 
that they believed that the problem can be solved. We no longer risk 
the lunatic asylum, but tlie general public still considers us as mentally 
unsound. 

The i)ublic understantling, mo\ ed by 1 lie asseitions ol' some scientists, 
has made some progress. There were tw** roads to possible success, 
tlie one broad, beautiful, smootli, and bordered witli flowers, but after 
all lejiding to no result: it was that of ai'rostatioii. of Italloons lighter 
tli;in the air. Tlie otlier way was contraryw ise. :i rough, narrow, 
rugged ])ath, bristling with diltieulties, but still leading to something; 
it was that of aviation, of ra]>id transit by machines hea\ ier than the 
air. jVlosl of would-be iuNcntois have taken the easy road, ;ind from 
the height they hav«' giiined. ])it\ iiigl\' look down upon the unfoituiiate

398 THE EMPIRE OF THE AIR. 

aviators still tJouudering- in the quagmire, with little thought that 
they may have to come down to this same quagmire in order to get 
somewhere. 

O ! blind humanity ! open thine eyes and thou shalt see millions of 
birds and myriads of insects cleaving the atmosphere. All these 
creatures are whirling through the air without tlie slightest float; 
many of them are gliding therein, without losing height, hour after 
hour, on pulseless wings without fatigue; and after beholding this 
demonstration given by the source of all knowledge, thou wilt acknowl- 
edge that Aviation is the path to be followed. 

It is therefore apparatus "heavier than the air'' which I propose to 
study ; and 1 mean to grasp the m<mster by the horns. I expect to 
have as a guide and as a support that potent creator of all prodigies, 
Nature herself. 

She has wholly ignored the principle of "lighter than the air" in 
designing her creatures, and all her flying animals are heavier, much 
heavier, than the air which they displace. We can not err if we faith- 
fully follow her teachings. 

There are two methods of investigating such an arduous problem; 
one may be termed the "closet" and the other the "open air" method. 
The tirst calls in the aid of mathematics, it applies them to some few 
observations, more or less defective or irielevant, and relying upon 
this li-agile foundation, it expresses by a goodly show of equations all 
that the observations teach — and generally a good deal more. 

Mathematics an^ doubtless useful, but they are less indsipensible 
than is generally believed towards the solution of this ditflcu It problem. 
Tliis arises from the foct that tlie basis of operation, the formula, is 
always erroneous. 

Nothing seems more simple than to say: " (liven, that we know that 
r, It, and /*, are equal to some other compound factors, then it nuist 
follow," — and then quadractic equations and calculus come in, and tlie 
student reaches a final result, which completely disagrees Avitli the 
facts. 

When we start from false premises, we arrive at some conclusion 
just the same, but it is not the object Simglit. But even if the foi-niuhe 
be correct, it is certain that for ninety-nine in one liundred intellects, 
including even the computer himself, a mathematical result will never 
be as convincing as a clear explanation of the phenomena, or what is 
much better a conclusive exi)eriment. 

Thus, I conceive mathematics to be an interesting instrument of re- 
search, but not a convincing argument. I will not resort to them as a 
means of persuading others of the probability of success, because I feel 
well convinced that 1 never will meet with anybody Avilling to hazard 
his life upon the bare dictum of a formula. 

HisforicaL — There is nothing new under the sun ; and lor the problem 
of flight, as ibr many others, this old [noverb is true,

been solved by Icarus. What is there absolutely impossible in tliat 
assertion? With close observation, good sense, and inventive faculty 
success may be acconiplislicd; Icarus, perhaps, had these marvellous 
good gifts. - - 

At a later i)eri()d, balloons came with their enormous bulk athwart 
the question; for eighty years they obscured the way to success. They 
led men's minds estray into concei)tions without issue, and inventors 
have all, one after the other, brought ui» against the impossible. 

Balloons. — At the first glance there seems to be a close connection 
between the power of ascending into the air, and that of progressing 
through it, and yet half a century's consideration has shown that there 
is a profound abyss between these two orders of ideas; they ])rove in 
point of fact to be directly opposed to each other. 

THOUGHTS ON AVIATIOIS. 

1 have already said that iS'ature, provident, infallible, always know- 
ing far more than the most attentive study can teach us, [>oints out to 
us the way to imitate her works. 

Let us not seek to be wiser than she: let us in all simplicity follow 
where she leads; thus shall we arrive at a result easily, without fa- 
tiguing our brains with that Chinese puzzle, — that mathemaiical com- 
jioimding of ./• and .// and c, which at thei)resent day invades all ardu- 
ous (piestions. 

r>y merely ol)S('r\ing witli close attention how the winged tribes jier- 
fonii their feats, by carefully reflecting upon what wo have seen, and 
above all, by striving correctly to uiub^stand the iiioilus ojxrandi of 
what we do see, we are sure not to wander far from the i)ath, which 
leads to ev(Mitual success. 

Mriho/ls of (H)srrr(iti(ni. — 'fo be really finitfnl, observation must 
possess several peculiarities and (jualities. in the first place, we 
must see accurately and then we must understand what we have seen, 
aiul then again we must apply our ac([uire(l knowledge to the de- 
tailed investigation of the performances of the great masleis in the 
art of flighf. 

To see aeeiiralfl\ . il is not only necess;ii> lo haxc good eyes, to know 
how to keep in the Held of the teieseo[)e a bird going at full speed, but 
still more, to know what to look at, what it is inipoi'tant to obserNC. 
I''or instanet', when :in amateur, little aeeustoin<'d to this kind of 
observation, hears an exi^Tt allirni. peremptorily, that the little black 
dot just i)ercei>tible in the sky is a male kestrel falcon (Faiicon 
er<;cerelle), he fancies the expert to be wool gathering, and yet the 
assertion is quite true. 

(liven the black <lot perceived by the expert, who has actiuircd skill 
HI such (»bser\ at ions, a kestrel falcon is easih' recognized in the air. 



400 THE EMPIRE OF THE AIR. 

whether in soaring or in tapping flight; its long tail is a sure index; 
there is no possibility of confounding it with a raven, a buzzard, a kite, 
or even with some other species of falcon; its peculiarities are too 
plain. Now, as to the determination of the sex, nothing is easier. 
One need only observe the bird for a few moments, the male discovers 
himself by the petulance and rapidity of his beats, by the energy of 
his movements ; the female is more supple and less ardent in her mode 
of cleaving through the air. 

As for the "Pharaoh's chicken" (Percnoptere), the case is again 
easy. Afar off it may be distinguished amid a flock of kites, which it 
often accompanies, by a slight peculiarity in its flight, a remarkable 
unsteadiness in its forward progress, also by the narrow width of its 
wings, and by their decided rectilinear set athwart the body, for they 
are partly folded or flexed only when the wind is very strong. As to 
the male bird, he may be distinguished from the female as far as the 
eye can reach by his color, for he is white and the female is dark 
brown. 

The great tawny vultures {Gyps fit If us) are to be recognized by their 
steadiness in soaring, by the amplitude of their circling sweeps, and 
by the majestic deliberation of their movements. 

The arrians {Yidtiir monaeJnis) and the oricous {Otoyyps auricular) 
are noticeable by th<? exagg(nation of all these latter qualities and by 
a darker i)lumage. 

As for the bearded grittin {Uypai'tos), its long tail, broad and rounded, 
easily discloses him afar oif ; there is no bird of similar outline among 
the large soarers. 

Here then in all its simplicity, is the explanation of a feat of dis- 
cernment which generally astonishes the inexpert. In order to deter- 
mine accurately the kind of bird seen afar off in full flight, it is simply 
necessary to have observed it long and well. When eagles have 
started ofl' within ."iO yards, and the eyes have followed them man\ 
times, the evolutions have become photographed on the memory; and 
later, on other occasions, when the same rhythm of movement is per- 
ceived, there is no longer need to concentrate the attention on the 
shape of the daws to determine whether the bird in view l)e an eagle 
or a vulture. 

Close ])roximity is greatly to be desired in studying the manceuvres 
of birds. I have been enabled to observe at very close range sexeral 
kinds: the crows, the kestrel falcons, the peregrine falcon, the kite, 
the Egyptian ^•nlture, the pelicans, the tawny vultures, etc., have 
J' i elded many of their secrets to me. 

I will not here aniplify on what I say as tt> the crow and the kite in 
the chapter devoted to them: in Cairo it is easy to touch the latter 
bird in full flight, by going about it dexterously, but the most stirring, 
exciting sight (the word is not too energetic) is to stand in the vulture 
roost on the Mokatan ridge, lu'ar Cairo, and to look upon the (ii/p.< ful- 
'vus, passing within live yards in full flight. 



TlIK EMPIKK OF TUH A IK. 4()1 

How useless to seek to deseiibe this spectacle I When tliese enor- 
mous birds rush by so close to you. an astouishin<;' rustling' may be 
heard; the great prinuiry leathers \ibrate like tongues of steel, and 
tlex upward to a (juarter circle und<'rtlie fitteen pounds of bird tliey 
bear. 

There the great vultures gather in hundreds; the •*l'jgy]>tian vul 
tures'' are uo longer to be reckoned, they are but a garnishing, while 
the kites creep in among the lot and make themselves small, and the 
great raven {CorcKS eorax) incessantly croaks against the invasion ot 
his domain. Beak blows are numerous; each smaller l)ird nnist keep 
his distance, for if he passes within neck length, a savage ])eek he 
gets from the vulture. The larger birds are scarcely more annable to 
their own species; if interference threatens in alighting, a shrill warn- 
ing cry is heard, a blow impends, and the weaker must dive away, to 
l>egin all over again the comi»licated eNolutions required to clu^ck the 
motion, and to alight upon the ]»erch in safety. 

One of the maneuvres which always asbmishes the observer is the 
alighting. The great vultures arise above the ])erch at the average 
height which they generally kee]) above the ground — that is to say, 
some 500 or (>00 yards above it. Having leached the terminus, they 
sweep artuind for a few minutes to inspect the toi»ogiaphy, and then 
they determine to descend. Tlu^ eagle comes down like a nu'teor; he 
is so powerful that he can control his movements at KM) miles an 
hour; but the great vulture has no such strength of pectoral muscle. 
He drops perpendicularly like the eagle, but Ik^ seldom folds his wings 
to gain speed. He wouhl come down too fast, and the descent is s<uue- 
times very great; for [ have seen birds which were already in full 
descent when first they api>eared at the zenith, say at a height of 
nearly 2 miles. If they had then folded their wings, and allowed ac- 
celeration to occur, they could no longer liave controlled their velocity; 
they would have l)een disabled, for their power would then have been 
inadequate to a change of direction. 

Next to close and accurate observati(»n a^ proi»cr uiulerstanding nnist 
be attained. This second stage is more dillicult to leach than the lirst; 
and this results because wennistdiscard many jire-conceivcd idea«^ which 
obscure the eyes of the mind. - - Then the observations must also 
be accompanied by accurate data. 

We can no longer accept the immense dimensions and the monstrous 
weights of guess-work. We must ha\e exact measurements and ac- 
curate live weight of birds in full health and in normal condition. 
Above all, it is indispensable that the observer shall be enough of 
an ornithologist to determine at once the speci<'s and p<'culiarities of 
the bird he is looking at; not merely on the dissecting table, but also 
afar off, on a perch, and especially in full (light. 

This knowledge is to be acquired neither from books nor iVom 
nmseums; it must be obtaine<l by much conning of the great volume

ot nature, by takiug accouutand thought of the various movements, 
operations, and evolutions of tlie birds, by becoming acquainted with 
all their niananivers, and above all by understanding them correctly, 
the how and the wherefore. Witliout all this information success is 
not possible. If the man does not clearly understand what the bird 
does and intends in a given position and a certain conjuncture, how 
can he hoiieto imitate its flight "? 

The observer must constantly set problems for himself, in the hope 
that occasionally the bird will demonstrate a solution. Thus, I was 
convinced, a priori^ that an expert soarer could, in a fresh breeze, 
rise directly into the air and advance against the wind at the same 
time. I felt sure that the feat was feasible. 1 waited for years before 
witnessing this evolution. At last one day in Africa, two eagles in 
love afforded me this spe<'tacle. One of them launched from the top 
of the ash tree which served as a perch, descended against the wind 
6-to 10 feet, was raised up by a gust of wind, and thus continued to 
rise, slowly, steadily, for a hundred yards into the air, while he also 
advanced some 50 yards against the wind, without a single beat or im- 
j)ulse of his mighty wings. 

Such convincing demonstrations are not to be seen every day; they 
must be persistently awaited ; the observer must burn with the sacred 
tire; he must be drawn to the study of flying creatures by that unde- 
finable enthusiasm which shall cause his heart to throb when he wit- 
nesses certain evolutions. - - - 

It is but rarely that a bird manteuvei' is absolutely incomprehen 
sible; for peculiarities and motives not understood upon a tirst demon- 
stration are explained by fresh observations made under happier condi- 
tions. In all cases, to learn the how and wherefore, the study must 
be a labor of love. 

All my life shall I remember the tirst flight which I saw of the Gyps 
fidvKs, the great tawny vultures of Africa. I was so impressed that all 
day long I could tliink of nothing else; and indeed there was good 
cause, for it was a i)raA'tical, ])erfect demonstration of all my precon- 
ceived theories coucerniiig the possibilities of artiftcial flight in a wind. 
Since then I have observed thousands of vultures. I have disturbed 
many of the vast flocks of these birds, and yet, even now, I can not see 
one individual passing through the air without following him with 
my eyes until he disa]>pears in the distant horizon. 

Fruitful observation requires that the model be well chosen. Ordinary 
observers are C(mtined to the bad examples which are found in their 
locality. They can only study the flap]>ing birds — the pigeons, the 
bats, the little insects even. What good is tp be got from studying a 
model which can not be imitated on a larger scale? It is impossible to 
reproduce an insect, a sparrow, even a pigeon, upon proportions which 
will carry a man. No material will bear the strains of wing beats as 
energetic as those of the sparrow. Steel itself is too weak in proportion 
to weight. - - - 



THE EMPIRE OF THE AIK. 403 

Common seuse indicates that the weak can only aspire to light tasks. 
Which then are the birds that expend the least energy? They are 
clearly the soaring birds, sweeping over great distances, by the vSole 
])Ower of the wind. 

The vultnre's needs are lew, and his strength is moderate. To earn 
his living he but needs to sight the dead animal from afar. And so 
what does he know? He knows how to rise, how to float aloft, to 
sweep the field with keen vision, to sail upon the wind withont effort, 
till the carcass is seen, and then to descend slowly, after careful recon- 
naissance and assurance that he m;i>' alight without danger, that he 
will not be surprised, and compelled to percipitous and painful dejtart- 
ure. And so he has evolved a peculiar mode of flight; he sails and 
si)ends no fin-ce, he never hurries, he uses the wind instead of his mus- 
cles, and the wing Hap occasionally seen is meant to limber u]» rather 
than to hasten throngh the air. And so the true model to study is the 
vulture — the great vulture, lieside him the stork is as a wren, the kite 
a mere butterfly, the falcon a pin feather. 

Whoso has for five minutes had the fortune to see the Oricou vul- 
ture in full sail through the air, and has not perceived the ])ossibility 
of his imitation by man, is — I will not say of dull understanding, but 
certainly inapt to analyze and to appreciate. 

ORNITHOLOGY; SURVEYED IX FLKIHT. 

And here I must deliver a little lecture u^jon ornithology, from a 
point of view vital to the question, that is to say, tlie acts of flight, — a 
point of view, (pieerly enough, which is generally ignored in books. 

Flight is the bird's chief peculiarity; it is his one good gift, so let 
us rai>idly review the acts of the cr(^atures which travel on the air. 

The lowest class is that of the insects. All of them progress by beat- 
ing flight; they are row^ers {rameurs), save ])erliaps some mid-day butter- 
flies, which occasionally glirte. Their wings are elastic, true |>lanes, 
altering their shape and acting on the air through flexible torsion <mi 
the up and the down stroke. 

Dr. Marey has given very interesting des< ii))tions and grai)iiic dia 
grams of insect flight. They are ])i(tnred motions, exactly re-^noduced. 
Xotliing better is to l)e desiicd. 

The reptiles — supposed to be the bird's original prototype— can now 
adays only produce that little East Indian lizard, the hntco rolaiis, 
who glides from tree to tiee. He can compass hut a few yards, — sa\ , 
from one branch to another. 

But i)ast geologic times altord much more interesting sjyecamens. 
Atthee])och of the Lias, nature i>roduced a \\ln)le family of re]»tiles 
whose li\('s must Inue been si»ent m tlu' air. The ])ter<»dactyls must, 
in order to earn their living. ha\e jiossessed t he faculty of mo\ing 
and sailing on the air. just as the large l)ir<ls do to-day. 



404 THE EMPIRE OF THE AIK. 

The class of fishes, as might be expected, presents few specimens of 
flying creatures; perhaps a dozen species can project themselves from 
the sea, glide a few air yards with great effort, and return to their 

liquid element. 

•* * * * * * * 

Flight progression is certainly the most elegant mode of motion given 
by nature to her creatures. But all birds are not equally gifted although 
each animal has modes of flight appropriate to his needs, for life depends 
on this. 

Which of all the birds is best endowed for flight by nature? A ques- 
tion often put, and answered many ways. 

Is it ihe eagle, with his majestic sweep f He is certainly great; the 
king of the air; but the humble pigeon outstrips him' in the sky, as the 
greyhound flashing by the mastifl. Is it the frigate bird, with his great 
spread of wings? Assuredly no, I answer: there are circumstances 
when the frigate bird can not rise from the ground. Is it the group 
of the great vultures'? These may be the best for man to imitate, 
but for speed, for endurance, for quick evolution, their vast wings re- 
quire too much space to produce modes of flight entitling them to bird- 
life primacy. A condor can not get under way and rise like a sparrow. 

May it not then be the charming swallow, so lively, so ([uick, so agile ? 
Alas! no; her great proportion of wing surface is the sport of a gust of 
wind. Her small mass is insufficient in great currents of air. The 
sparrows are after all the best endowed for bird flight and bird life. 
Speed, ([uickness in action, diflicult feats, constant readiness, all are 
compassed by them. And yet these birds during their whole year, do 
not flit as far as sea birds in a month. 

From these remarks it is safe to conclude, and to say to ourselves, 
that eacli bird flies perfectly, according to his needs. Yet, from bird 
point of view, the spjirrow approaches the type of perfection. As to 
speed, he may outstrip the pigeon ; as to power, he can rise vertically 
to considerable lieights; as to journeys, he equals other birds, for he 
also has his periodical migrations. 

This selection may at flrst sight appear curious; but it will be re- 
membered that it is only small birds which compass all the monstrous 
difficulties of flight. The warblers, the sylvias, the humming-birds, 
are constantly performing astonishing feats and gymnastics; they are 
athletes and acrobats. We may even at this point fornuilate an ornitho- 
logical law, and here it is : The proportional power is in direct ratio 
to the smallness of the bird. 

We do not generally appreciate this power ; and yet let us observe 
the metallic elasticity of the warbler's muscles, in its zigzag flashings 
in ]mrsuit of a fly; observe the wings' pulsation, vibrating like tongue 
of steel, and almost producing harmonic notes; and conceive of the 
energy spent in such rapid motions. A condor whose pectoral muscles 
could produce such lightning beats, needs have his wings of steel ; their 
roar would be as thunder.

Varieties iti forms of irinf/s. — Ornitholojuists ha^'e divided tlu^ <lititer- 
ent forms of winjis into two groups: thr aente wings and the obtusi' 
wings; then again these are sub-dividccl into the suix'r-acute ami sub- 
acute, the .super-obtuse and sub-obtuse. 

This elassitication, however ex<*«'llent it may be, is not sullicienr. 
In order to explain satisfactorily the numerous facts obserxcd couccrn- 
iug flight, we must have more data than are furnished by these divi- 
sions, which are too vague and general. Wenuisttake account of the 
amount of wing surface, in ])roportion to weiglit, of tlu^ length of the 
wing in relation to its width, and to tlie mass of the bird; in fact we 
must consider many circumstances, whi(;h render it necessary to study 
each family l)y itself, in order to reach satistactory conclusions. 

As a result of the study of all these conditions — a study to be found 
farther on, — \\v may now establish a series of principal divisions, 
which may be condensed under the rennirks following. 

It may be safely ailiiined: that a bird with long and wide wings is 
well (Mpiipped for soaring flight. A gift which go<»son increasing with 
the mass; that the bird with hnig and narrow wings is well equippe<l 
for gliding in great wimls, and that this gift also increases with the 
nmss; that short and wide wings (in jn-oportion to body) indicate and 
]>roduce a II ight of small extent: tinally that short and narrow wings 
denote great rectilin<^ar speed. We may even lay down the law: 
Velocity is in inverse ratio to wing surface. 

This, be it uinlerstood, ap]dies to birds whii-h lly, for else tin; ostrich 
and the ai)teryx would be the most rapid of l)irds: but we may say that 
among flying birds velocity, straitlbrward, increases as the propor- 
tional surface diminishes. It must be so to sustain the increased rela- 
tive weight. iMcry sportsman know^s the astonishing sixH'd of ducks, 
teals, loons, <'tc., and the slowness of herons, lai» wings, and barn owls. 

It is useless to enlarge upon these fundamental ])rincii)les, for we 
shall lind them C(mstantly explained and ap])lied in our studies of the 
flight of each feathered family. 

The tail of birds. — The tail, as an apparatus, serves to sustain, to 
direct, and to i)reserve the ecpiilibrium. - - - It is a useful organ, 
but not indispensable. A bird who has been deprived of its tail will 
fly, Avith its own i)articular mode of llight, alter some days' ])ractice, 
ami without much varian(;e or (hlliculty. - Many birds wliich 

are exi)ert flyers have scarcely any tail: the lienms. tlie albatross, the 
ducks, the teals, the pelicans, the gulls, etc., etc. 

Again, the tail may be larg<^ or snmll without api)arent reason. As 
witness the turtle-dove ami the Iigyi)tian <love, the magpie ami the 
jay, the vulture an<l the tumbh'r eagle. 



40G THE EMPIRE OF THE AIR. 

Griiiit .si/A' of tail always iiidicatt's Iceblc Hight, cspci-ially when the 
appendage becomes very large. 

We may neglect to consider this organ, as giving l)at vague indica- 
tions of its utility, yet if we must account for the final cause, for the 
necessity for this organ, j)articularly when it is well developed, we 
arrive at the following deduction: 

The tail of birds serves as either an ornament or as an organ for flight. 
The ornamental consideration concerns us not, it may here be neglected. 
As an organ of flight, we may be enlightened as to its use by the fol- 
lowing description of a manceuver witnessed. 

A kestrel falcon was skimming close along a hedge, almost at ground 
leAel; its speed was moderate and its direction straight; when all at 
once, — as if moved by a released spring, it darted a right angle and 
]»ounced upon a lizard. The angle deviated was precise and the action 
of incredible swiftness. To perform this, the bird used its tail; it 
absolutely needed this rudder, so ample and powerful. 

Here we see the use of a great development of this organ of locomo- 
tion; it permits surprising the prey by a sudden change of direction. 

It seems probable that the jjowerful tail of the gypaetus is destined 
for the same function ; his mode of hunting among the rocks, deliver- 
ing great body blows must be facilitated by its ample and powerful 
tail. 

In tine, the tail ])est serves in pursuing the prey, but is not iiulis- 
])ensable for long-continued flight, as indeed may be proved by remov- 
ing it from the bird. 

We then conclude that the tail's chief use is in producing rapid 
changes of direction; and curiously enough when the bird does not 
employ it, his flight is always straight. This may be formulated as 
follows: Aptitude for changing the direction of flight is in direct 
ratio with the amplitude and power of the tail. 

It is only from the theoretical point of view, from its application to 
artificial flight, that the utility of this organ is here disregarded. The 
equilibrium may be maintained ujion two points of support, as w^itness 
our legs, stilts, the velocipede, etc, yet we must acknowledge that 
in practice a third point of supi^ort becomes very useful; it introduces 
Mi^sointe stability, and minimizes that constant strain on the attention 
required to avoid falling. 

Therefore a third point of support obtains even among birds with 
rudimentary tails. For examifle, the pelican dazzles not with the 
development of his caudal ap])endage, but we may note that the gen- 
eral form of his body sui)plies the deficiency. When in full flight he 
presents the following attitude: (See Fig. 1.) 

It will be observed that his arm and his forearm form pronounced 
angles, like those of a flattened letter M, and that he may shift his 
center of gravity by playing these wings back and forth W'ithout com- 
promising his equilibrium. This leads, incidentally, to another formula : 
Birds without tails all have the forearm very long.

means to start. He is on the grcaind: he croucluvs to sjaing up. letting 
]iis wings liang <h)wn h»ose]y. 

Let us analyze this tirst movement. The wing is divided into three 
planes, one formed by the liumerus. another by the radius and tlu^ 
ulna, and the third by the hand. The result produced by the ])osition 
of these three planes is to otilei- no resistane<' to the air. 

But tliisdoes not exhaust the decom[)osition of this attitude: all the 
feathers, }>articularly those at the rips of the w ings, are so incline'-^ tliat 
the air is met by their edges instead of their broadsides. Still further 
we see that the wing is never raised on the ujt stroke at full S])i-ead, l>ut 
well folded on itself, so as to present the least possible surfac*' and yet 
ac^eomplish the movement with least i^lilbrt and greatest celerity. 

Xow let us note the seconrl mo\-ement : the bird's wing beating down 
the air. The action is simple; the wing is fully extend<'<l and ^titf. the 
feathers close its whole surface, and it is concaNc on the nnder side. 
There is therefore a, great difference in the result obtained between the 
lip and down stioke of the wing. This dilfereiice ]»i(»duces the lifting 
effe(;t in tla])i)ing tlight. 

Exactly to apju'eeiate this dilfei-ence, to feel it as it were, let the reader 
take the freshly severed wing of a large bird, grasp it b\ the humerus, 
and imitate the up and down stroke. This exitei-iment will give a bet- 
ter understanding of beating Might than all i)ossiblc descaiptions and 
explanations. It is proximate and plain, one feels the efforts reipiired 
by each nu)vemeiit, and ]»asses judgment on them directly. The upward 
spring of tlie legs, and the tirst Ijeat of the wings, have launched the 
bird in the air. He rejx'ats the beats rapidl>' and rises, n(»t vertically, 
but at ail angle within lo". To rise jierpendicularly the bird is com-

pelled to reverse liimself, ;i difficult uiaiHeuver, sometimes performed 
by pigeons in the pigeon house to limber up their Avings. 

To pass from this inclination of some 45° into horizontal course, the 
bird brings the tail into play. He depresses it, and produces through 
the jiressure corresponding to the velocity (sometimes aided by a par- 
ticular light beat) a <lecomposition of forces which results in changing- 
the course from 45° to the horizontal. Tf the tail is weak, he uses his 
deltoid mus(!les, which raise his body relatively and so produce the 
same result. In general, birds often employ both means simultaneously. 

Horizontal motion being attained, the manner of flight is slightly 
modified witli increasing si)eed. The wing no longer beats j)erpendic- 
ularly, but is slightly inclined in the direction of the course in order 
to increase the speed. - 

Soarhu/ JiUjlit. — Some naturalists have advanced most curious ex- 
planations of bird flight, especially of soaring or sailing flight. For 
their ])urpose lightness is the main reqiusite. They have pointed to 
the porous bones, to the spaces filled with air sometimes occurring 
under the skin of these creatures, as indispensable conditions for sup- 
port in the air. 

These are fallacies. Birds always exhibit corporal density, practi- 
cally the same as land animals. DepriAcd of their feathers they sink 
in water; their specific gravity is about J, as is that of inan, of mam- 
mals, and of fishes. 

To rightly explain the flight of birds, we must consider them as 
highly organized machines, which arc sustained through the reactions 
produced by muscular eftbrt; not as a balloon floating in the air, but 
as a stone glancing along the water, or a skater gliding over thin ice. 
All that apparatus described for distending the gannet, the pigeon — 
all those hollow bones of the pelican, the albatross, etc., serve flight in 
no degree. Their utility is different. 

After all, expei'iment is <'asy. Strij) a bird of his body feathers 
leaving him only the wing and feathers, and his flight will be in no way 
changed; he will get chilled, he will not be able to swim if he is a 
water bird, but he will assuredly not fly the worse. 

Let us now explain the flight of the soaring 1)irds, or as 1 prefer to 
call them, the sailers. Birds soar jterfectly in proportion to the mag- 
nitude of their sustaining surfaces and of the greatness of their mass. 
This is an unquestionable principle. A large bird, an average sized 
bird, and a small bird, all thi-ee having the same proportional surface 
relative to their weight, Avill soar the better the heavier they are. 

Let us consider, then, only the larger birds, for these alone can effect 
the decomjiositions of wind-force which produce flight without flapping 
of wing. As the sailing bird first launches out with fiaps, unless from 
a perch he plunges to get speed, we will suppose him in full action in air, 
and ])Ossessing initial velocity. He will then glide on rigid wings. If

always to liis surface, and above all, to his mass; theietbie an avrian 
vulture will ^lide farther thau a tawny vulture, and this latter farther 
than an Egyptian vulture, yet they are all constructed very nearly in 
the same ])ro]>ortions. 

\N'heu there is no wind, sailing- birds must come down: Higlil is not 
jmssible unless they choose to flap. This sore necessity rarely brings 
early birds, for the morning is usually calm, particularly in the tropics. 
But let there be a current of air, a circumstance almost always 
present at a certain height in the atm<Ksphere; at once the scene 
changes, the sailer sweeps in circles, he rises upon the air to great 
altitudes, and thence he glides downward where h<' Avishes to go, even 
against the wind. 

Let us try to explain this circling act. The bird glides in his sweej* 
in the direction with the wind, losing as little height as [)ossible, the 
wind imparting velocity almost eijual to its own by imi)act in the rear. 
This push is effective: there is a good hold against upturned feathers, 
whereas when the bird turns again against the wind all feathers are 
smoothed down snug against each other and preseiiting surfaces of 
least resistance. This difference in action is akin to the revolving (uips 
which serve as anemometers through the different resistances of the 
C(mvex and concave surfaces.* As the bird further sweeps around lu' 
faces the wind, Avith fr«\shly accjuired velocity, and utilizes this in gam- 
ing fresh elevation. 

In all soberness is this fraction of an exi)lanation ])resented; for this 
circling action is little understood and is evidently of great use to the 
bird. When he faces the win<l in the sweep h«' describes, the bird ad- 
justs his wings and tail so as to rise slightly, his own ac(piii'<Ml speed in- 
creasing the normal wind i»ressnre, he rises more than he has diopi)ed 
to develop his own speed. 

To sum it uj), there is a balance of benetit; tin* result, a lift ])ro- 
duced by the force of the wind, which does not act with equal etfect 
whether the bird's front or rear is presented thereto. 

The soaring bird repeats this circling sweep, and gams elevati<m at 
every la]>. The greater is the mass of bird and the more nearly con- 
centric are the sweeps, especially when the breeze is light. Vet even 
among those birds best able to produce those decompositions of force 
approaching theory, the sweeps are only exactly concentric in the sole 
case when there is no wind; Avhile he is awaiting the vivifying cur- 
rent the bird simulates the (tircling i-ise, he still sweeps around to sus- 
tain himself, but be gains no elevation. This action almost always de- 
ceives the ()l)server, and h^ads him to l)elie\-e tliat tlie bird is rising 
unless they are both placed on the same level. 

It is not well however to ascribe undue importance to the varying 
effect of the wind on the feathers, front and rear, and to rely on this

410 THE EMPIRE OF THE AIR. 

;is ;i sole explanation; tlie problem contains many mure elements. 
Tlie variations in the amount of wing- surfaces unfolded to tlie wind, 
in the different portions of the circles described, the variations in 
speed, and the shifting- in position of the center of gravity of the bird 
are all of them factors to be taken into account. 

The bird's elevation is gained by the skilfnll utilization of all these 
elements, and by the happy use of a number of casual circumstances, 
beginning- with those of ascending currents, which have been so much 
discussed of late, but which are not to be reckoned upon as a steady, 
sole cause, and ending with the utilization of the coming- puff" of wind, 
which the bird takes advantage of by breasting it at the best angle of 
incidence, just at the right moment; tinally, and especially, by the 
difference in length of course while sweeping with the wind or against 
it, the latter being shorter, and the difference being nioic marked, as 
the rise becomes steeper. 

The advantage obtained in rising- on circling- sweeps is easily ob- 
served and understood, yet it must be confessed that there is a weak 
point in the analysis, an insufficient exijlauation. This pertains to the 
stage when the bird is going with the wind. Is the acquired momen- 
tum, the velocity necessary to support the bird, sufficient to account 
for the subsequent phenomena? I scarcely think so, and I feel that 
the explanation is not absolutely correct, for observation shows that 
there is often complete arrest of motion. In any case, whether my 
analysis be good or inadequate, the circling sweep is much practiced 
by birds, and observation indicates that it is the manoeuver which af- 
fords easiest ascent, for it is the process always employed by the sail- 
ing bird when there is a minimum of wind. 

While still lacking a clear, convincing- explanation, we may hold to 
that above given ijrovisionally. Ifelying on the instinct of the birds, 
we may without risk accept the usefulness of the sweeping circle. 

Instead, a manteuver which supports analysis, and which is easily 
understood, is that of direct ascension against the wind, either by 
drifting- back, which is an easy feat, or vertically, which is more diffi- 
cult, or even while advancing- against the wind, the most difficult 
of all. 

When we note the conect angle of incidence presented by the bird, 
the adjustment of his surfaces, and his skillful utilization of the vary- 
ing velocities of the wind, advancing forward in the calm, and ascend- 
ing on the increased velocity, we understand his mananivers and find 
his solution of the problem easy to follow. 

But we remark that this particular process of rising in the air re- 
quires that the wind shall i)Ossess such speed as to sustain at all times 
an areoplane with no velocity of its own, while, if in circling sweep, 
this same areoplane would have an initial velocity, thus enabling it to 
utilize breezes too feeble to serve in direct ascensions. 

We must never think of the wind as a regular current of air — we

the fact is certain, for the irreyidar puft" is often ntilized: and yet liere 
a.yain is a basis it is not safe to bnikl on overnnich, for the lieavy soar- 
ing- birds seem to disdain to use these puffs of wnnd ; they a(;cept them, 
they store up, asit were, theaccruinii- momentum. l>uttliev iiev<'i' trouble 
themselves to profit fully by them. 

In order to <;-ain a sound idea of what is ,iioing on in sailin.y- tiij^ht, to 
understand and to account for it, we must separate two conditions of 
wiiul \\hich are usually confounded — the regular current of wind and 
the irregular gust. 

It would seem at first consideration that when in a regular current 
of air the bird sweeps a circle, he must lose, against the current, just 
so nuich momentum as he has received in going with the wind, plus the 
frictional losses, etc. But we have observed that this is not the case, 
and as we say because the bird breasts the wind with his smooth 
cleaving- shape, a shape more perfect as he excels as a sailer; which 
cleaving shape differs nuieh from the rear, which latter is arranged in 
(piite another form to catch the wind as a sail, ^ow to the difference 
in the coefficient of result upon these different shapes we must add the 
effect of the varying- angle of the incidence of different spreads of 
wing as velocities change, the relative short course against the wind, 
and finally that mysterious first cause which we call life, which exhib- 
its marveh)us wonders(»f equilibrium of rest and of motion and governs 
the active i)art of existence. 

Vet, as I said before, very large soaring birds do not seem to trouble 
themselves nun-h to utilize all these little accessories; the experts in 
the art, having adjusted their surfaces at an average angle, judged 
sufficient from their exjierience, do not readily modify their attitude; 
they know there is small i)rofit to them in small manonivers, such as 
the furling and unfurling the w'ing, to modify the extent of sustaining- 
surface in diifenuit ])ortions of the circling sweep; one might say that 
they adjust their areoplane up to a fixed notch, which they know to be 
practi(;ally good, ami trust to the wind gust for material uprise. There 
are probably minute changes in adjusting the eiiuilibrium which the 
telescope does not disclose, such, for instance, as movement of the head, 
which is a precious balancing i)endulum a<lmirably located; there are 
even unconscious movements of the whole body; but as to intentional 
changes in the size and set of the sails (that is, the attitude of the 
bird's tiight), they may remain for whole hours at the point fixed, with 
reasonably steady wind, just like the sails of ships. V\'e nuist there- 



412 THE EMPIRE OF THE AIR. 

fore examine the ]>rol)lem lurtlier, and seek a Jiiuie satisfaetory solutiou 
of tlie eireling problem. This we shall tind in studying' the effects 
]>roduced by irregular gusts of wind. 

The wind gust is the very essence of the uprise ; it is the magic w^aud 
which, striking the child's hoop, keeps it upright in rolling, drives it 
along, or raises it up to overleap elevations on its way. Supj)ose the 
toy to l)e placed on a steep inclined descent ; gravity wUl cause it to 
roll to the bottom. If beyond this an ascending plane follow^s, the lioop, 
urged forward by momentum of acquired velocity, will rise to a height 
equal to that of fall, minus the losses by friction on the soil and by air 
resistance. But if, instead of utilizing gravity alone, we accelerate the 
hoop with the wand, it will run up much higher than the point it 
started from. 

Let us suppose further, when the hoop is about to ascend, we can 
displace the ascending plane, in contrary direction to the toy's course, 
so that the plane shall glide under the hoop, then we would still more 
assist the ascension, by adding a supplementary force, independent of 
the others, and whose resultant would likewise be an uprise. 

Let us nc^w re-consider the action of the vivifying current of air u]>on 
the bird. 

If the gust of wind occurs just where the bird is going with the wind, 
its effect is akin to the blow of the wand on the hoop; it stores up 
energy and economizes descent, hence the bird profits to that extent. 

If the gust occurs when the bird faces the wind, then the sustaining- 
plane is gliding beneath him, and the resulting i^ressure causes him to 
ascend; therefore again profit results in an uprise, nowise connected 
with antecedent fall. 

If the wind gust occurs when the bird is on the quarter sweep, 
forward or back of the wind's course, it still exerts contributory rise; 
there is always, in each case, an impulse, a thrust from foreign source, 
which the l)ird profits by; or else a saving of acquired momentum, 
which the creature transforms into uprise. 

But, after all, these explanations avail only for the iiublic, curious to 
know why. They neither corroborate nor disprove the facts. Whether 
we understand and mathematically demonstrate the mechanics of sailing 
flight, or whether we fail in the attemjit, the result is the same. There 
remains always the demonstration produced by the Gieat Master, who 
in His wisdom has implied: ''If you understand it, it is well; if you do 
not understand, 'tis to be regretted; but in any case, look! that is the 
way 'tis done ! I exhibit it all day long, not in a dark corner, but in 
the blue; and if you can not eventually profit by the lesson, you will 
really deserve never to join me in the skies." 

Thus acts the bird ; he demonstrates. We see the demonstration ; and 
what more can we do with a formula which leads to no result? What 
testimony is an explanation more or less clear? Can there remain a 
doubt as to the fact of sailing flight, when the proof is evident and visible

every day? The bird works no magic, he does not viohite natural hiws. 
We have not as yet rigorously explained these multifarious dccomposi- 
tious of forces because they are all complicated by movement and by 
life; but they are demonstrated each instant, and they constantly invite 
us to imitate a mode of motion which can not be beyond our attributes 
any more than the feats of e<piilibrium which we perl'orm uiu'onsci(msly 
every moment of our lives. 

We appreciate well enough the acts of walking, of leaping, of gym- 
nastics, of the velocipede: have the manteuvers which maintain their 
stability been calculated mathematically? No, they have not. Our 
vital instinct suiSces for such action, not only accurately, but with all 
rapidity required by the need. Thus will it be assuredly for that remain- 
ing problem of ecjuilibrium which resembles the others so greatly — the 
sailing on the wind; for man's life, that wondrous reservoir of uncon. 
scious science, will certainly prove equal to this new achievement. 

The main requirement will be skill. The knowing how, and when, 
and why, each act is to be performed, to be expert in all possible njan<eu- 
vers required to produce various results or to meet contingencies; in 
tine, the man must thoroughly know his ])usiness — as a bird, a soaring 
bird, just as he knows in time his business as a swimmer, a skater, a 
bicycle rider, an acrobat — and, in short, as an expert in any gymnastic 
exercise. 

Si><(i<l of the trl)id. — For the sailing birds, the wind is the source of all 
good gained while sustained. Xo wind, no uprise, no sailing flight pos- 
sible; therefore, in a dead calm, they are all on the i)erch. Now, what 
least velocity of wind can support and upraise the most exi>ert soaring 
birds ? 

Observers may fancy they see kites and vultures as(;emiing in dead 
calm. 'Tis an impossible feat. There must absolutely be, at a certain 
height, a cnrrent in the air, perhaps indiscernible to the eye, but nev- 
ertheless revealed to the experienced observer by the bird's mameuvers. 

The sailing bird, rising during a calm, generally Haps his wings till 
he is up one hundred yards. At that elevation he begins to circle, 
]>artly gliding partly flapping; then he diminishes his beats as the ele- 
vation increases, and finally stops them altogether; this proves that 
the air is motionless only near the ground. 

It is w<'ll known that there is almost always a strong cnrrent of air 
at prominent altitudes; we leave the valley where absolute stillness 
reigns, and on the mountain top we find a lively bree/.e. A light /ephy r, 
fanning the sitring-li'vc day, which we can not miscall a w ind, is blowing 
however a hundred yards above, some twenty two miles per honr, as 
proved by accurate observations made by myself. l»y lueans of buisting 
lin'-works, bombs, whose smoke is most sensitixc. 

When the wind isde(;idedl> ])erceptil)Ie at the surface of the gronnd, 
it greatly exceeds twenty-tw(» miles an honr at an altitude of 1,0()(> 
feet. A "ood wind, a fresh sea ])ree/e, one in which the sailoi- t.ikes 



414 THE EMPIPvE OF THE AIR. 

in ii(» reef, but keeps an eye on his sails, is found to bloM' forty-four 
miles an hour 1,500 feet up above the sea. The great Xorth wind, 
measured by the transit of the cloud's shadow, blows from 67 to 89 
miles per hour, while a violent "Kamsin" at a height of 500 yards shows 
incredible speed. 

In this terrible wiiul, a tawny \'ulture moving with it, has a fright- 
ful velocity; in a moment it has traversed the field of vision, say (for a 
bird of that size) four or five miles. 

These are the tempestuous winds which expatriate the birds, which 
cause the creatures, after a day's journey, to find themvselves 3,000 
miles from their own habitat. 

These enormous velocities are j)roved by actual facts. The balloon 
"Ville d'Orleans,'* which left Paris during the siege at 11 :4:5 p. M., 
arrived next day near Lifjeld (Norway) at 3:40 p. m. Say 900 miles in 
15 hours, or 60 miles an hour. The balloon launched at the coronation 
of Xapoleon I, travelled during seven consecuti^•e hours at a speed of 
about 90 miles an hour. During a long summer's day, say 18 hours, a 
bird swept away by such a current of air, and rowing in the same 
direction, might travers 1,800 miles! - - 

What splendid journeys a powerful wind might enable man to make 
if he coitld navigate the air! But let us entertain no illusions; it will 
be the accident, not the rule. - - - 

Let us now consider every day winds, those of moderate velocity. 
Observation indicates, by comparing birds' progress with that of rail- 
way trains, that the slow flyers go at most 155 miles an hour, and 
that birds well endowed, such as the turtle-doves and the large sailing- 
birds, in full flight through si^ace, get over some 37 miles in the hour. 
So that, for general use, we may assume a speed of a little over a mile 
in two minutes, as a probable achievement, if man sails on the wind. 

If the problem can be worked out, if the skill be acquired, this is the 
rate of translation man may expect to compass, less perhaps, rather 
than more. But it is a fair promise. He may journey 300 to 400 miles 
in the day of 10 hours, with no expenditure of ])ower whatever, for the 
wind will do the work. 



Velocity of the bird. — The speed of the bird's translation, considered 
generally, especially for sailing birds, is comjiosed of the bird's ve- 
locity with that of the wind. With flapping birds the case is difl'erent, 
and the speed results from three factors; the speed of wind, the theo- 
retical speed of the bird (which is to be estimated as if he were a 
sailer), and the additional speed produced by persoiml exertion. This 
latter speed, already object of many exjieriments within doors, and of 
reams of calculations, nowise interests the obserAcr who watches the 
sailing bird in all the simplicity of its flight. We therefore Avill con- 
sider only the lesson to be learned from j)racticnl performances, 



THE KMI'IKE OF TJU: AJli. 415 

To ineusuie acc-ui-ately the speed of traiishition of the bird, \\v can- 
not survey liim in tlie air, for we have no reference points. It is to 
the bird's sliadow npon the ground that we niust direct our attention. 
This shadow is easily foHowcd by the eye; it may be g'auged by the 
speed of a liorsc. of a chance (hinkey, a dog', a carriage, or a railway 
train : ami t has w c get suie data and trustworthy points of comparison. 
For instructive observation it is well to study nniny models, ami to 
live close to them. 

For instance, as i write these lines two families of domesticatc(l 
raVens are within a few yards, awaiting for the food I am about to 
throw to them. On the mosque, in front, my ])et kites are perched, 
waiting my appearance to phmge toAvards me, at the least gesture I 
may simulate of casting meat to them. Thus I can closely view this 
expert at full si)eed, for there are two of them which snatch their ])it- 
tance from my baud. 

There are endless battles between ravens and kites and among kites 
themselves, and battle always brings the i)erformauce of feats; con- 
stantly does the kite turn over back downward, this being a favorite 
fighting ]>osture with all the eagle tribe. I often see two kites lock 
claws u\) in the air, clutched fast, and thus locked spin down hun- 
dreds of yards. 

When a great wind blows, the observation is wonderfidly interesting. 
To try to explain these complicated movements with mathematical 
formula; seems a farce. Their mere description is difficult enough; 
how then can we fasten within algebra's rigid rules the evolutions, the 
feats, the stratagems, which shift with each wind gust, with each 
fancy! It is like an attemj)t to calculate the foot pounds expended by 
a gymnast during his exercises, or the thermal units utilized inastrng- 
gle between two athletes. 

What is most knc^wu concerning the speed of birds is generally 
vague, for they do not lend themselves to accurate experiment. The 
speed of flapping flight is pretty well indicated by the carrier pigeons, 
who, by a dead calm, cover from 33 to •")(► miles an honi'. according to 
si)ecies. 

We know that the turtledove flies taster than the \\()od-i>igeon. its 
\<'locity being about .")() miles an hour. Ducks and teals have greater 
sw iftiu'Ss still, but it is dillicult to determine how mnch. jMoreovei-, 
the effective speed is governed by the force and direction of the wind. 
It is ther(-for<; almost imjtossible to be exa('t as to the s])eed of liapping 
birds, and the ((uestion j>ossesses snuill interest for liim who thinks 
the soaring birds to be the tru<5 model to imitate. 

The sailing birds affoid an occasional chance of nu'asuring tlu'ir 
speed of flight, which naturally varies with the wind, bnt which always 
illustrates the advantage of nniss. There often is a race IxMwceii llii'e(^ 
birds of diffei-ent si/e: the tawny vultnr<', the l\g.\i>tian \iiltiin'. an(| 
the kite. 



416 THE EMPIRE OF THE AIR. 

Near the " Abbassich" gate at Cairo, amid inoimtain.s of potsherds, 
dead animals are deposited by the scavengers. They are not buried; 
there is no need, for between vagrant dogs and rapacious birds, they 
are eaten up in a few hours. As soon as the carcass has been laid 
down and the knackers have finished skinning it, carniverous birds 
appear. They pass in the zenitli of the observer and arrive at their 
destination, all the time visible through the telescope. The distance is 
known, and only the time need be noted which is consumed in the 
journey. 

This trip is performed with the same velocity by the three birds 
named, but the force expended is evidently much less when the mass 
is great. The actual speed, of course, varies with the velocity and 
direction of the Avind. 

As a final result, deduced from such daily observations, I think that 

I closely approximate the fact when I state that a kite, soaring to 
survey the hunting ground beneath him, has a mean ])roper speed of 

II miles an hour when the wind blows also 11 miles an hour ; this is the 
sailing bird which seems able to obtain support with the feeblest cur- 
rent of air. The tawny vultures, in order to rise on such velocity of 
breeze, need to unfurl their entire i)ossible wing surface. For them it 
seems that the wind velocity should be at least 17 mihvs an hour to be 
in full accord with their faculties. 

Effect of speed. — Theorists frequently set themselves this problem: 
What is the power required to obtain support in the air! 

The lifting force, (ascensional power if you please so to call it), is 
under many circumstances so slight that it may be neglected, and 
is reduced to the force necessary to sustain the aj)paral:us. 

In soaring flight this ascensional power is only indispensable when 
there is no wind. The problem would be better stated thus: What 
velocity must be imparted to an aeroplane, bird or nuichine, in order 
that it may be sustained on the air and may rise ? Xow for this, as 
for all aspects of this ])roblem, we find a solution provided by nature. 

Birds whose pectoral nniscles have not power to raise them bodily 
are not rare. Sailing birds can, unaided, compass but little rise; 
especially the very large birds. A tawnj^ vulture can not rise 20 yards 
on a start of 45°; lie can not rise 10 yards vertically. So this king of 
soarers may be kept a prisoner in a roofless cage, ])rovided the sides or 
walls are 20 yards high and 20 yards apart. Among birds with nar- 
row wings this peculiarity is still more marked. 

The Swift, this wild, darting, rustic inhabitant of the air, can not 
rise vertically G feet. It is perfectly caged in a large box without a 
cover, and yet if any creature is thoroughly eciuipped for flight it is he. 
The same is true of the large sea birds. A frigate bird is impotent 
with less than a certain spaee to perform its evolutions, whereas as soon 
as the two birds I have named have acquired speed, or are launched in 
a current of air (which amounts to the same thing), they become forth-

with one the dasliiiii;- swift, and the other the tireh'ss frigate bird and 
this tells the wlioh' story. 

I may here formulate an axiom: No speed, no tliulit. 

T once had a curious |)rol)leni to solve, based on the above princii)le. 
It was years a.i;-o, and I was in Algeria; so far as I now rend)eniber, it 
was in 18(!4, in the si>rin<ii,-. T already understood the problem i)retty 
well, and with a li' hel[) ami better N^urrouTulings I might have suc- 
(•eeded in imitating' the birds. [ ap])reciated the possit)le results; i)er- 
haps the French collai)se of l.STO would have been averted, the Itusso- 
Turkish war might have remained in Jitnbo, nations might have gained 
freedom, or Asia might have invaded Kuropc^ with countless thiongs; 
who knows 'i lUit why specuhite ? Let us leave all that asi(h\ 

I was saying that one tine morning, in the port of Algiers, 1 Inid gone, 
to the harbor to h)ok over the fish caught over night. This was my 
way of studying the dogtish and the form of the great submarine 
swimmers, etc. There I ran across a peddler, who instead offish had 
some sea l)irds for sale. There were scune titty of them. 1 <lid not at 
first know what kind of birds they were, but after a while L lecognized 
tliem to be "procellariie," variety Pvffinus kiihlii, or stormy petrels, 
which I had already seeii at sea, but only afar oiT. As they were cheap, 
1 treated myself to four, and then J took the train at S (t'clock, and at 
10 I was at home on the plain of Mitidja. 

It was my object to examine and measure these birds, and then to 
set them at liberty when I was tired of them. I therefore deposited 
them on the water, in a little duck-pond, near my farm. Here T think 
it jiiay be well to give a short <h'scrij>tion of this bird, so that jtersons 
who are )iot acipiainted with it may fully a])preciate all my nushaps. 

The ])etr('l is a bird about the si/e of a small hen. l>y referring to my 
table, (The (lull type,) p. 433, it will be seen tliat it weighs 1.G5 pounds, 
tliat its spread of wings is 4.10 feet, by a width of oidy 5 inches. Thus its 
eciuipment for flight consists, as it were, of two drumsti<'ks, which only 
l)ermit its launching forth uiuler special conditions. We nuiy ibrm a 
fair idea 1)y imagining a pullet equip])ed with two flat rules, such as 
draughtsnuMinse, in lieu of wings. The legs are long, delicate, aiulfeebhv, 
the feet are webbed. The bird can scarcely walk ; it runs 8 or 10 steps, 
then stops as if fatigued. 

Myfoui- birds, seton the pcnid, did nothingin i)artieular; they seemed 
to Inne no notion of taking flight. I took up one, the weakest one, and 
I threw it into the air sufficiently high. It undertook to fly, crashed 
against a wall and knock<Ml its brains out. 1 was vexed; F took a 
second l)ird and cairie<l it upstairs; to the first tlooi'. This second 
bird was sick; it fell so stupidly that I allowed the dog to strangle it. 
So I took a third, and 1 took my oath tlnit day to see a stormy petrel 
in full flight. To biing this about, I went to the top of my observa- 
tory, which was several feet higher than the ])eak of the roof Thence

better luck than the others; he flapped his wings vigorously, sinking 
downward, and just as I believed him to be fairly under way, he struck 
a post and broke a wing. 

I must own that I was not pleased with my purchase, and there was 
good reason. To spend good money in conferring liberty on captives,, 
to rack my brain about them, to carry them nptothe roof of the house,, 
and then to fail flat, this was hard luck. 

There was still one bird, a forlorn hope. I had got it into my head 
that I must see this bird in full flight and 1 was determined not to 
miss my aim this time. 

I reflected a long while; at last an idea struck me, and Inn-e was the 
result. 

Less than a mile from my farm there was an open tract, naked, bare 
of grass, flat, smooth as a mirror. It struck me that these conditions 
were somewhat analogous to the surface of the sea in a calm. 

I carried thither my No. 4, who appeared to be Just as stupid as his 
three predecessors. 1 set him down on this extended area, and retired 
to a distance. The creature remained squatted down for a good while, 
then he turned, with his beak to the wind, and he stretched his wings. 
Then he showed me that I had reflected to some purpose. 

He started running and beating his wings, which were not hami)ered 
by any herbage, and ran in this way about 100 yards, carrying his 
weight less and less upon his feet, and fliuiUy all on his wings, but all 
the time skimming the ground. At last, with a single bound, catching 
the wind, he rose some 00 feet, returned towards me, and as he glanced 
l>y on his way, I thought he said to me, '' Remember hereafter, oh! my 
preserver, that success in jiight is all based upon speed.'''' 

******* 

Effects of Mass. — Among birds of the same shape and same nuiscular 
])ower mere difference of weight produces eftects (juite varied, and 
yet all of a piece. 

Let us note how a difficult exercise is performed by the eagle, by 
the falcon, and by the lark, all three being perfectly comparable as t(( 
their construction. 

The eagle remains motionless in the air, on rigid wings, using only 
his tail to balance himself; he is as fixed in space as if spiked to the 
sky. The falcon also remains at a fixed point, but he beats his wings; 
while the lark cannot perform this maneuver, under the same atmos- 
pheric conditions, without painful effort, as it is constantly carried 
away by the wind. 

This law of disproportional aptitude for flight between the smaller 
and the larger l)irds constantly deceives the eye and confuses the 
data gathered. An actual example will exhibit the law. 

The (piail, which everybody knows, i'S an especially heavy bird. It 
flies with meat effort. It is a round ball with two small wings which 



THE EMPIRE OF THE AIR. 419 

barely sustain it. Yet, actually measured ami weighed, it pieseuts 
the following' surx)nsiug- results: 

It weighs only 0.92 pound per square foot of sustaining surface, 
body and wings, aud this is less than the flamingo, which weighs 1.56 
pounds per square foot of surface, and yet this rosy wader is generally 
thought of as a mere i^ack of feathers. Or than the pelican, which 
weighs 1.3G j)Ounds i)er square foot, and which flies very well- Or than 
the stormy petrel, which weighs 1.17 pounds i)er square foot, and must 
depend upon speed for a living. Or, it wdl not be believed, the quail 
weighs actually less than the tawny vulture, which weighs 1.47 pounds 
to the scpiare foot of surface, and yet floats for whole days without a 
single flap. And yet how badly the poor quail flies! Its usual course 
is 200 yards, and it is then outflown, it pants for breath. 

I'rom the comi>arison of the rates existing between the weights and 
the surfaces of the birds which I have jueasured and inscribed in the 
tables of this work, \ may deduce a general law: The amount of ])ro- 
portionate surface re([uircd l)y a bird for a given mode of flight dimin- 
ishes as the weight of the bird increases. 

The exact proportion is yet to be deduced from more complete tables 
than those which I i)resent. and from experiments to be made upon 
the sustaining power of aeroplanes constructed upcm siiniliar models, 
but of difierent sizes, and loaded Avith ballast until they produce similar 
satisfactory results. 

The exact advantage obtained through large mass, while indicated 
by my tables in a decided and regular manner, is somewhat difticult to 
formulate. The manner of increase of the volume, in relation to the 
containing i»erij)hery, certainly cuts a figure; it is a factor to the credit 
of the larger mass, by diminishing the relative air resistance; this is 
un(piesti(mable. Increasing sustaining surfaces, on flie other hand, 
l)roduces increased friction and resistance, but the gains and U)sses do 
not iiHirease with the same factors, and hence result complications. 

We might reasonably expect that the area of surface required to 
sustain each pound of l)ir<l would be a. fixed and definite ratio; any 
<leviation should only be prodnced through gain in the ratio Ix^tween 
the volume and its enveloping surface, or through loss by increased 
resistance and friction of the sustaining surfaces. And yet it is not so. 
The tables I have constructed show that things are a ery difierent : they 
indicate enormous discrepancies. 

Thus the surface of 3.<)2 square feet required to sustain one pound of 
bank-swallow is reduced in the tawny vulture (whicli flies and is sns 
tained at least as well), to O.OS square feet per ])Ound, a variation of 
five times and more. 

If we seek an exjdanation for this ])henomenon, we find that a dis- 
turbing <'ause always ])rings advantage to the larger mass; it is the 
variation in the coefli<'ientof air resistances opposed to difierent masses. 
******* 



420 THE EMPIRE OF THE AIR. 

Coiitiuiiiug our study of the effects of mass upon fligiit, we shall 
notice in the tables that as the weights of birds vary between 15 
grains and 3,5 ounces, the peculiarities of their flight become very dif- 
ferent. From 3 ounces up to 10 ounces, from 1 pound up to 2 pounds, 
from 5 pounds up to 10 ijounds, and up to 10 pounds, there are as 
many steps in the increased economy of power and support in the air. 
So it seems at least from information furnished by the experts, by the 
birds. - - - 

It is probable thnt the benetits to be derived from large mass con- 
tinue to make themselves felt beyond the weights comprised in the 
tables, and that ui> to some 200 pounds the law remains the same, or, 
to express it in another way, the curve of variation which may be <'on- 
structed with the tigures contained in these tables would continue in 
regular sweei) beyond the points observed. - - - 

When we observe the sailing flight of the Nubian vulture, whose 
weight varies from 17 to 22 pounds, the one astonishing thing which 
strikes us immediately is the great steadiness in advancing. When 
the bird has set his course, accidental wind-gusts do not seem to affect 
his great mass, which appears insensible to them, and which continues 
its majestic motion without disturbance. An aeroplane, therefore, 
w^eighing 200 pounds with its load, ought to move on the wind with 
even more persistence and regularity than the Nubian vulture. How 
will it be, then, when from 200 pounds we pass to 1,000 or 2,000 pounds 
in artificial liight? We may rest well assured that unsteadiness and 
accidents of the flight, under equal conditions of wind, will diminish in 
a still greater degree. 

For weights up to 200 pounds, intuition furnishes us with a pretty 
sound idea of what manner of flight we can get on the wind; we have, 
as it were, bench marks to refer to; but when we shall come to weights 
of a ton or so we know scarcely anything, and as for 10 tons, we are in 
the dark unknown. However, until the contrary be i)roved, T shall 
believe that the advantages shall continue to grow in the direction of 
the heavier weights. 

EffecU produeed hy (ifigrcgaiion {in fioels), — Observation seems to 
show that birds (whether sailing or rowing birds), have mor(^ power 
to penetrate tlie air when they are congregated in flocks than when fly- 
ing singly, - - - 

It is a fact well known to sportsmen that a charge of shot so rammed 
as to scatter does not penetrate as far as when well rammed so as to 
act as a single b<ill, - - - 

Birds must know this property of aggregated bodies, for they fre- 
(]uently avail of it. Thus the pas.wrines make no long transits unless 
grouped in close order, beginning with the sparrows whi(;h have a well 
fixed order of flight. Pigeons, ducks, geese, swan, cranes, etc., never 
travel save in serried ranks, in always the same order for the same 
species. - - •

Pelicans on their travels arrange themselves m the form ol'u wedge, 
wliieli from a distance simulates the point of an arrow. Tiiey move 
with a curious sluggishness, and with the regularity of iron rolling- 
mill macliines. These enormous palmiijedes sometimes afford a most 
engrossing s})ectacle. I remember, one day upon the Nile, to have seen 
a tlock of them come sailing out of the sky, dropping from a height 
where first they seemed as swallows, alighting within liOO yards of my 
boat, upon one of thos<' islands of gelatiuous nuid peculiar to that 
river. 1 followed all tlieir ev(»lutions, through a telescojjc, and the 
specta(de lasted half an hour, ft was astonishing! How beautiful were 
these great birds in their wlieelin >s among the <'louds! From afar otf 
one could hear the hissing of theii wings cleaving the air, their hoarse 
cries, somewhat like the donkey's bray, and even the slap of their 
great feet as they struck the liquid mud. 

Tlic three supports. — I*]aeli family of dying (•reatur(\s presents in the 
air a particular aspect, w liicli it is intei'esting to stiuly. 

Tliere are birds with long arms and others witli short arms; some 
lia\"e long |)rimary feathers and others liave them short. Some birds 
have long nari'ow wings, otiiers ha\e them thin and short. Some 
wings are round, sonu' are sipiare. terminating in five feathers of equal 
length; others again run to a ]>oint in which either the third, the sec 
ond, or e\en the first, priinar.x' featlu'r is th«' h>ngest. - For 

what ])articular kind (»f weather and for what si>ecial uses were these 
wing forms intende<l .' 

When nature had to provide a large bird (and w<' need only con(;ern 
ourselves with such) with wings for rapid flight, she made these wings 
sumll and nariow. and ])ro\ided powerful pectoral mustdes, as witness 
the ducks. When the bird's success in life reciiiired if to nH)ve in high 
winds, like ocean storms, she in\ariabl.\' en(h)wed it with long and 
narrov\' wings, to avcnd friction, as witness the gull, the mew, the gan 
net, and the all)atross. When she determined, as in the case of the 
eagle, to pro<luce a powerful creature, to create a great hunter, she then 
endowed it with her best gifts; that is to say, with the a})fitu(le of sail 
ing indefinitely without fatigue Avhile surveying the field. I^'or this she 
gave it the wings of the sailing l)ird, and to these joined ]>owerful 
motor musch's, so that it nught flap vigorously in case of need. AVhen 
she determined only to i)rovide a biid with the faculty of remaining 
in the sky without fatigue, she endowed if with two things: a large 
mass and a large surface. 

As for other birds, her unfavored (diildren, the disinherited, she made 
rowers of them, and they drag their bodies through the air by main 
force, tlai»])ing and fatigue. 

Let us now impiire as to what i(dation there is between the mode of 
flight ol' a bird and the length of the radius and of the ulna in propor- 
tion to the liand. 

Before going further we should remark that the lengthening of the 



422 THE EMPIRE OF THE AtR. 

forearm coincides witli that of the arm; there is au almost constant 
relation between these two parts of the wing, bnt there is a decided 
divergence in the i-elation «»f tliese two parts (taken togethei-) with the 
liand. 

Each flying family is prox>ortioned somewhat differently ; Miese 
j)ecnliarities should be ascertained by detailed and minute measure- 
ments, but in their absence some general remarks may be made. 

We may cover all genera of soaring birds by the t\vo types we jiro- 
ceed to specify. 

(1) Among soaring birds the general posture of their wings at an 
acute angle of about lOCP (the summit of the angle being the beak) 
corresponds with the shortening of the arm and fore-arm, and the 
excessive lengthening of the hand. This covers rapid soarers, such as 
sw^allows, martins, and in lesser degree, the kites, tish-hawks, etc. 
Let us remark, by the way. that this kind of soaring necessitates a 
])owerfnl tail. 

(2) In the extreme ojjposite type, that of slow soaring birds with wide 
wingSj the angle mostly affected is about 200°, and sometimes more, 
and here we notice a diminution in the length of the hand, ami a great 
development of the arm and forearm. The best type of this genus is 
the vulture. In the latter genus the tail is generally small. 

There is however a family of sailing birds with narrow wings, 
which has an exaggerated length of arm, fore-arm, and also, generally, 
of the han<l. This is the family of the Pel lean Ida', comprising four or 
five genera which are constant, paradoxal sailing birds. 

The tropical phteton soars wonderfully. The P^gyptian pelican is a 
charming instance w'hich can be closely studied, for it is easy to see 
him in full sail over the w\ater. But the frigate-bird is the 7ie j^??/s 
ultra of soaring creation, the elief (Pceuvre of nature in that direction; 
in this bird the lengthening is general, the arm, the forearm, the 
hand, all are of enormous length; therefore the creature soars fast or 
slow just as it chooses. It is perfect of its kind but of no use as a 
model, for man can not imitate it. Let us therefore dismiss it in this 
essay. 

Thus we have reached the fact that the two extreme types of soaring 
flight are the martin and the Nubian vulture. The iirst presents its 
wings at an acute angle, and this produces instability of equipoise 
requiring great velocity, just like the velocipede which can not remain 
upright unless it is in motion. 

Vultures, on the contrary, can spread their wings at a re-entering 
angle. The two wings and the tail then furnish three points of 
support, upon which the system is balanced. The relative x)ositions of 
these three moveable sui)ports govern the motion and the speed. 
Thereftu'e the variable jnisitions of tliese three supports produce all the 
evolutions of those avian acrobats w'hich have been termed soarers or 
sailers . The variation of the angles between these ])oints of support 



I'Hl-i EMPIRE OF THE AIK. 42cJ 

I'ovoirs ail the types of sailing" iliglit, and produces all the mano^uvers, 
from that of absolute immobility iu the sky to that of vertical fall; 
from great velocity to the actual stopping, froiu going forward to going 
backward; for, from a theoretical standpoint, backward Higiit or back- 
ward gliding may be considered as feasible. 

VarioiLs niamenvers. — To write concerning the manceuvers performed 
by soaring birds is somewhat like attemiiting to descrioe a picture 
or a piece of music in words, — the l)est possible descri]»tion wU) never 
be worth the roughest sketch, or a line of notes. 

However, as we cannot rest content with always preaching observa- 
tion to those who can go where the birds are to be found, we shall try 
to say a few words con(;erning some evolutions of sailing winged crea- 
tures; for before man dare trusthimself to any apparatus, however well 
designed, he ought to know, approximately at least, what may be done 
in the air with such an apparatus, for else he can only be sure of the 
descent to the ground. 

Birds get their initial start in many ways. For most of them this is 
tin- easiest act. Those which liavc to vancpiish the greatest ditticulties 
are the large water birds, which in starting from water or ground are 
com])elled to run a long distance, using both feet and wings, in order 
to gain the si)eed re([uired for su])port. This applies to large sea birds 
with narrow w4ngs, and in general to all water birds: such as the geese, 
the swans, the ])elicans, etc. 

The rowing birds simply juni]) into the air to take flight; their ])ec- 
toral nuiscles are so ])owerful that they enable them to get sup])()rt 
without much headway; moreover this lea]) possesses great energy; 
this may be realized by watching the leaps of a large passerine bird 
deprived of his wing feathers, such as a raven or a magi)ie: one single 
lea]) sends them u]) three feet. 

The smaller the bird the greater is this initial leai> in i»roi)()rtion; as 
Avitness the blackbird, the lark, and that lile-spark, th<^ tomtit. Among 
the birds, the stiength of the legs follo\\'s the saine law as that of the 
pectoral mu.scles; it increases in ])ro])ortion as the weigiit diminishes. 
In fact, a niglitiiigale or a sylvia use their wings when iu a thicket 
only as an aid to (equilibrium and as directing power. 

The i)lovers, certain scolojtax, the tringas, etc., get into flight by ]>r<>- 
vious running. The larger number of the great wachMs, the larg<' vul- 
tures, etc., also get their start by running, if on the gionnd, but as 
soon as they can, they al)an(h)n the running steps for a- scries oC leaps 
whi(;li continue as long as their teet can touch the ground. 

lUids of ]»rey in general ha\'e two methods of glutting under way. 
When they start tVom the ground, with or without a |)rey (excej^l vul- 
tures), they always enter into action by a lea]) measuring a yard. 
When they are on the i)eich, being always at great heights, the\' sim 
l»ly launch into s]»a<'e and sjtread their wings o])e!i to get under full 
motion. 



424 THE EMPIRE OF THE AIR. 

C()ini!i<i to a rest is always a serious business for a large bird, and 
seems to become more so the heavier they are. (leiierally they manage 
to face the wind, and thus to extinguish in part their velocity. A 
l>igeou witliout experience, alighting with tail to the wind, is generally 
ujiset and tumbled over. In a state of nature, a wild bird knowing 
his business perfectly, never misses making a safe landing. When 
the wind is high, the heavier birds of large surface perform wonders 
in coming to a rest. An eagle alights with incredible lightness; the 
shock is no greater than that due to a 4-inch fall. 

When there is no wind, the winged experts who dislike to be jarred 
adopt another way. They glide ui)ward, the steeper the slant the bet- 
ter, and by thus opi)osing gravity to speed they completely extinguish 
the inertia of their motion, rising as high as may be required before 
conung to rest. 

When man comes to experiment with an aerial apparatus the bird's 
mode of alighting will needs be studied a outrancc. The man may add 
a lot of embellishments, such as elastic nets, beds of straw, suspended 
cords with elastic connections, rings for attachment, watery beds for 
floating machines, etc. 

The act of alighting is the terror of all winged creatures. There is 
especially one class Avhich dreads (and with reason) even the smallest 
fall; these are the waders. Therefore do they jiossess great propor- 
tional Aving surface, which perhaps may be intended to allow them to 
come to rest without the risk of breaking their long legs. Happy are 
the birds which alight ui^on the water. The reader doubtless has seen 
a swan come down to his liquid bed; it is a striking spectacle; they 
plow deep furrows with their palmed feet; the jets of water and the 
foam which they raise with great fuss attracts attention forcibly. 
This is the mode of coming down, simple and i)ractical; which num 
must ponder well, and try to imitate. - - - 

OBSERVATIONS OF BIRDS. 

I give in the following pages some data concerning birds, which, 
although scant in extent, have required from me many h^ng years of 
hunting. I now have but the later specimens; two-thirds of those I 
had gathered have perished in numerous removals — they have been 
lost, forgotten or abandoned. 

It is not enough to kill a bird : this must be done under favorable 
circumstances, that is to say, we must have two things which are not 
always at hand — scales to Aveigh the creature directly after death, 
and appliances for measuring and calculating its surface. 

Birds sold on the market in the towns of Europe are generally unfit 
to gather data from, be(,*ause they have been drawn or are dried up, 
and the exact weight can not be ascertained. Among fifty rare birds 
which have been sent to me, only three could be utilized; all the others 
lacked something or other and had to be rejected. One of the latter 



THE I'MPIRE OF THE ATK. 425 

was a cuiioiis hiid: it was l»i()U<;lir IVoni the Slioa coiuitry by the ex- 
ploHT AiiKtiis: but what could I (1<» with a buudh'of piiuiaiy feathers 
and a tew hirge secou(biries ' L couhl only say, alter exaiuiiiiug- them 
that it these were featlu^rs of the griffon, that bird attains an extraor- 
dinary size in that region, for the longest feather was at least as large 
as that of the condor and was -9h inches long. It may have belonged 
to a great unknown vulture of Central Africa, the existence of which 
I suspect from the accounts of Abyssiuians. If so, it must be u])on the 
old continent the analogue of the harpy of the Amazon River. 

I was in possession for many years of the most beautiful eagle which 
I have ever seen : neither Paris nor Geneva possessed, to my knowl- 
edge, anything its equal in figure and beauty. Vet I can furnish no 
accurate data of eagle measurements. 1 have killed over a dozen, and 
I can not ])resent on«' of tiieni to the reader. However, as tlie proverb 
goes, we can not give wliat we have not got: so 1 give the best infor- 
mation 1 liaA'c. 

All the birds 1 ]>resent w<'re weighed when IVesh killed. As to their 
surface, this is the way I pioceed: I sjtread out the bird, back down 
ward, upon ;i large sheet of pa])er, the wings being stretched out into 
the attitude of theii- flight when there is no wind; this being set down 
in the tables as •• wind. ])er second." Sometimes, when tlie wing 
hapix'iied to be stifl" and could ]iot be fully extemled, the attitude 
resembled that which the bird assumes when there is alight breeze; in 
such cases it is marked (ui tlie table as "wind. ."> meters per second''' 
(11 miles per hour). Finally, some measurements have been nuide with 
the birds' wings adjusted as when they sail on a good wind. In such 
cases they are headed, ••v.ind. 10 meters ]>er secon<l " fl'L* miles per 
hour). 

Once laid down on its back, well adjusted in ])roi)er attitiule of sail- 
ing llight, the bird is made inunovable b>' weights, these being plates 
of lead to fiatteu down ttnruly feathers, and two or three large masses 
of lead to hold the wings in ])osition ami to counteract the contraction 
of the muscles; then with a pencil it is easy to trace a precise silhou- 
ette. We thus get the total project<'d surface of the bird — wings, tail, 
body, head and feet, ^'ow, if we only measure the snrface of the 
wings, we would err; for when under way, all i)arts serve to suppor, 
weight, all goes to form an ai''r()j)lane, being more oy less effecti\e. ac. 
cording to its shai)e. Assuredly, we might neglect the feet of the 
waders, as being nothing but an imitediment which the creature trails 
beliind, but as to the l»ody, there (-an be n() thought of ignoring it, for 
it dei'ives mneh sui)[»ort from the air. 

We may now say, simply, that this gi\-es us the surface of the siiadow 
of the l»ird. 

in calenlating these surfaces we must proceed with ])atience, many 
figures, and much older. Ther(^ are a dozen triangles to com])ute and 
four oi' live i)arallelogiams. This is ^•ery tedious work. We ])luck up 



426 THE EMPIRE OF THE AIR. 

courage with both hands, as the sayiiij; is, and when the operation is 
ended Ave may say that this is another stake p]ante<I. 

When the weight and surface are ascertained, we next measure the 
spread of the wings (aLar dimension) and the mean width of wing, 
whi(;h two hitter iodicate the proportions of the aerophme of the l)ird. 
This relation is indicated in the tables by a simple proportional frac- 
tion, 5:1 for example, whicli indicates that the width being 1, the total 
spread is 5. 

In addition, I set down the amount of surface necessary to carry 1 
gram, also the weight sustained per siiuare meter, and finally the 
aggregate surface required to support 80 kilograms (176 pounds). This 
weight of 80 kilograms corresponds to the weight of a man equipped 
with a light aeroplane. The figures therefore indicate the total sur- 
face required for an aeroplane of that particular type. 

In order not to present at random (alphabetically) the different kinds 
of birds, they are groui)ed according to their mode of fiight. This 
produces strange groui)ings; all ornitliological rules are boldly vio- 
lated; the charadrius (plovers) are classed without hesitation with the 
vanellus; even classing the accipiters (night birds) with the passerines 
(sparrows, etc.), which is an infinitely more gi'ave departure. It will 
thus be seen that similitude in fiight has alone been taken account of. 

The Rail type. — Under this head are comprised all the birds which, 
in fiying, hold their bodies at an inclination of about 15 degrees, instead 
of spreading them.selves out horizontally, a position invariably assumed 
by the other birds. The marouettes (rails), the different rails, the water- 
fowls, and the domestic fowls, here compose this branch of flyers. 

The turkeys, the guinea-hens, the canepetieres, and the peacocks do 
not form part of this class, because they stretch themselves out hori- 
zontally when in full flight. 

The above class of birds (rails), although they fiy but rarely are some- 
times compelled to make long journeys; they probaldy then utilize 
strong winds of good sustaining force. These great air currents have 
indeed a power which human instinct does not reveal. 

During a strong sirocco, blowing at least 20 meters per second (15 
miles per hour), I have compelled Kabyle poultry, which, to be snre, fiy 
somewhat better tlian European fowls, to take extensive fiights, during 
part of which they soared in a way surprising. The guinea-hens were 
by this violent wind sustained in the air with an ease one would never 
suspect in a gallinaceous fowl. 

Here, methinTis, the good housewife will ask, were many eggs laid on 
that day? I confess that this did not disquiet me. I would have 
sacrificed the whole barn-yard for such a beautiful demonstration; for 
after all, when knowledge is sought, we must do all requisite things to 
arrive at that knowledge, even to the sacking of the poultry yard, if 
need be. 

My poor pigeons I what a time they had. They were adjusted in all

sorts of ways. Their wings were clipped short : their wing's were h^ngtli- 
ened out. Tliey were made semi-long, narrow and long, narrow and 
short. They were pieced out with i)rimary feathers from birds of prey, 
thoroughly fastened on Mith glue, and pressed on in the vise. 

This is Avhat happens when a bird's wings are altered; when the 
active surfaces are changed in extent and form, the creature being- 
accustomed to a particular mode of flight starts off in his habitual man- 
ner; but his organs are no longer adapted to produce their customary 
effects, they are shaped to i^roduce different effects. Thus the bird 
finds itself with habitudes and instincts for one mode of flight, and 
with a new arrangement of feathers adapted to another mode. The 
latter constantly impresses liim with the necessities of the moment, 
and these necessities com]>el him, willy-nilly, to fly as flies the other 
type of bird wliich has been forced upon him. 

Thus, a kestrel falcon, a good soarer, who had his nest near my 
observatory, has just one-half in length of liis primary feathers cut oft'; 
the result was forcibly to transform him into a rowing bird. I restored 
him to liberty, and as he remained on his hunting ground, I had every 
opportunity to observe him. Although nuich hampered the bird was 
not very unhappy, the prey sometimes escaped, but he made up for 
what he had lost by increased activity. He was easily singled out, for 
the mutilation gave him an unusual figure; his long tail seeming longer, 
now that it was not accompanied with two long wings, and it attracted 
attention from afar. And so he had to row constantly. Once in a 
while he would try gliding in the old fashion, but as he found himself 
dropping too rapidly, the instinct of necessity for support compelled 
him again to beat the air. 

1 have transformed kites into stormy petrels by clipping off' half the 
width of the wing for its whole length, and abolishing the tail. The 
result was to comiDel them, notwithstanding tlieir habits of soaring 
upon light winds, to await instead the brisk winds which alone could 
sustain them without fatigue. 

As will be seen, to succeed in such observations we must absolutely 
control the bird and have him at command. Experiments withincreased 
surfaces did not succeed as well; I tried them on pigeons, and on two 
kites who were old neighbors of mine. I only succeeded in jn-oducing 
birds which were exceedingly awkward in their movements. I ought 
to have practised u])on a goss-hawk, but how couhl I have afterwards 
obser^•ed such a mere lurd of passage, whereas the kites a have fixed 
habitat, they are well recognized, so that if there is an important 
feather missing iu one of the kites in your neighborhood, you can 

recognize liini, single him out, and consequently observe him.

the two divisions prol'ouiid dirtereiices; one may be callod laptorcs of 
long- tligiit aud the other of short fiiglit. 

Among- the eagles, the faleons, the kites, and tlie buzzards tlie i)rimary 
feathers are loug, the second and third being the k)ngest, the result 
being an acute-shaped wing. Among the hawks the fifth (inill is the 
longest, and moreover, the whole combination ol" primary feathers is 
remarkable for its shortness. They are not birds of extensive flights, 
either as regards elevation or duration; they frequently are perched. 
They comprehend three species — the sparrow-hawk, the goss-hawk, and 
the harpy, Avhicli has the same conformation as the two preceding, and 
must fly in the same manner. I do not know the manner of movement 
of the harpy, never having seen it myself, but I am sure of being right 
in saying that its gait is in general the same as that of the goss-hawk. 

Xature has meant this bird for a forest hunter, its life is passed 
among the trees. Its forte is not the attack of a hare or a duck in 
open field; it would n(»t succeed in that; but it is the chase alterother 
birds or after mammals nndei- the trees. The powerful tail of thisfani-

il}- of birds has Ixh'U given them to turn short corners; they needs nuist 
seize under the trees a pigeon or a turtle dove, and this vigorous lud- 
der enables tliem to thread the innumerable branciies and trunks of 
trees Avitii all recpiii-ed velocity. 

There is anolher bird which accomplishes tiie same results by other 
means, It is the great eared-owl {(indid (hie). 

Its life needs are the same; it is also in the verge of the forests among 
the trees that its hunting exploits are ])erforme(l. It has no tail to speak 
of; it cannot afford it; for in the hole wheiethe bird cowers in the day 
time a tail wonld be a nuisance. What, then, is to be done :' The bird 
brings into ])lay a iH'culiar aptitude, born of necessity ; this is a mobil- 
ity and an <^\tiaordinary power in the mod*- of presenting the planes of

its wings. Changes of i)lane against the air w hich change the diieetion 
of its tligiit Avith incredible celerity. No other tlying creatnre has this 
gift ei^nally developed. 

With what astonishment is the tiight of this enormons bird beheld 
u nder tlie trees ! I^o snch (h'xterity can be re-called. Theobser\-er's habit 
being to see birds generally proceeil in a straight line, it renders the 
flight of the great-eared owl fairly stupefying; it seems at every mo- 
ment as if it were about to dash against a tree, and yet every obstacle 
is avoided. It Hashes silently, horizontally, or even vertically through 
spaces where there would seem to be no passage; and this is done with 
absolute mechanical precision, without hesitation or slackening of speed. 

This is truly the most extraordinary mode of tiight, but it is a rare 
sight even to dwellers in the country. 

77/e Gull type. — This genus teaches one thing, namely, that in order

a-rophnie must be reduced to a mininnim. The si)read (»f wing is of 
h!Ssc(Misequence than its width. W'lu'n we think of it this is rational, 
but it must be confessed that nature did well to demonstrate it. for it 
was a difficult deduction to get at. The table shows that in this type 
th«i spreads of the wings is from (1 to 10 times their width. 

The albatross, which is not included, must greatly exceed this pro- 
l)ortion, foT travelers mention scmie 16 or 17 feet as the extreme s|)rea<l 
of wings, and as its width is about 10 inches we have for this bird a 
l)roportion of about 1*0 to 1. 

This teaching is of great importance, and should b<> borne in mind 
in the design of icroplanes with adjustable surfaces.

Teal and Duck ti/pe. — These birds are the represeutatives of rapidity 
in flight. They flap to excess, supplied with carbon as they are by the 
heavy layer of oily fat which covers their pectoral nniscles. This is the 
tj'pe to imitate for aviation with motors. These birds attord practical 
lessons as to methods of getting nnder way and of alighting, botli oi" 
them points of capital importance. 

These birds need, like the scolopax, to traverse o\er long distances, 
from one lake to the next, and as tlicy ar«^ weaponless speed is their 
sole safeguard. It is enough for their safety, for the.\' are never at- 
tacked in the air. 

The eagle, their chief enemy, abandons pursuit as soon as they are 
well under way. 

The Friicaii. — Here is a wag and a pliilosopher, a swift sybarite, 
mounted on two great wings. 

Where is his nest ? Whence does he come to us .' 1 confess 1 haidly 
know. 1 merely am aware that we see a good <leal of him in l]gy]»t. 
Great flocks of tlu'se birds are found on the inundated lands, upon the 
the Mareotis and the ]\Ianzalch lakes. There arc even s(»me in tlie city, 
domesticated. I bought one for a dollar in the Mouski. Every year 
they aie peddled in Cairo during November, December, and flanuary. 




Whal a droll crcatnrel 1 had two ot tlu'se tor my personal friends. 
They were more Indicious than will l)e credited. IJut I mnst abstain, 
foi' if I were to begin telling of waggish tricks of pelicans. 1 jiever 
would be done. Let humorists treat themselves to one, and have no 
fear of his bill, which is (piite inoflensive, and they will have their 
money's w(nth of amusement. Hut. droi»i)ing the humoristic feature 
of this cimrming animal, let us attend to his flight. 

The pelican possesses a i)eculiarity in his stru<*turc; it is an cxces- 

siv<- length of arm and fore arm. lie is without a tail. His centei- of

great flat /\f\ which is outlined by his extended wings and body. This 
is the disposition of parts which gives him that equilibrium, length- 
wise, which his rudimentary tail could not furnish. 

His mode of flight is magnificent. He rows but seldom, for as soon 
as the wind permits he becomes a sailing bird. 

The effect produced by great mass is always surprising. If a bird 
be large and has adequate surface, he practices sailing flight, as wit- 
ness the pelican, who has less surface, i^roportionally, than the teal, 
and yet soars to i)erfection, while the other only rows. The teal is 
l)ro])ortioned at 1 gram per 177 square millimetres (1 pound for each 
O.S(> S(piare feet), and the x)elican at the rate of 1 gram per 150 square 
millimetres (1 pound for each 0.73 square feet). 

When in full flight he does not stretch out liis neck a yard in front, 
like the goose, the stork, the swan, but he curves it back like the 
heron, and rests his head gently upon his shoulders, which attitude 
gives him a peculiarly graceful api)earance. He then seems so much 
at his ease, he appears so comtortably i)osed upon his two immense 
wings, set at picturesque angles, that once well launched he seems to 
glide through space without the least fatigue. 

Of all the large birds he is certainly the one which presents the 
juost elegant silhouette. The great vulture is rigid, and looks as if 
cut out of tin plate: the swan and the goose have an attitude as if 
already spitted; the eagle is stiff' and all of a i)iece, but the pelican, 
notwithstanding his awkward heaviness when on the ground, becomes 
as graceful as a gull once he has mounted in the air. The varied atti- 
tudes of his wings, the great length of their arm and forearm, offer 
every moment new aspects which the evolutions of other birds never 
present. 

In point of intelligence the pelican is among birds what the elephant 
is among mammals. Like the latter animal, a boundless curiosity 
attracts him to man. The doings of the sovereign of creation interest 
him profoundly. The attention which he bestows upon all movements 
is a sure sign of great intelligence. 

He will not, like the large birds of prey, morosely assume a gloomy 
state of sulks, beginning with his captivity and ending with his death; 
he will not go crouch in a corner and motionless ponder on his lost 
liberty — not a bit of it. After two or three days, if, without looking at 
him or apparently noticing him in any way, you are occupied in doing 
something, he will not let half an hour pass befoie he is between your 
legs, the better to observe ycmr actions. Every now and then he will 
stretch out that frightful bill of his, but there is no need of extra 
guard; all there is to do is not to draw the hand back, because it might 
be cut against the saws of his numdibles. AVhen he sees no reply to 
his overtures he will become almost troublesome in his familiarities; 
he will come into the house as if it were his own, he will i)ick fleas off' 
the dogs, he will ]>ui-loin a- shoe, he will make way with ;i l)all from the 
billiard table with an air of perfect innocence; and he Avill not even

cease his rascally tricks at night, for if he is allowed he will stay up, 
like the human biped. 

In the garden or yard, you must not expect him to fraternize with 
the other inmates; he has a profound contempt for these weak-headed 
winged creatures. He will not quit the neighborhood of mau's social 
gathering, but he will squat down all rolled up in a ball, in the middle 
of the group, rest his bill on his back, and from this vantage ground 
his intelligent eye will follow every gesture and every word spoken. 

He imposes himself upon man as his companion; he decides that his 
society will be accepted, and as after all he is not very troublesome, 
as — far from being repugnant — he is clean and stately, man gives in 
and becomes his friend. 

We have yet to speak of the pelican when in possession of his full 
wings, when he is able to fly; for up to this we have only described 
the bird whose wings have been clipped ; but the chapter would be 
endless. 1 will only add this, that his familiarity grows with his 
wings. Judge then what it becomes when his plumage is comx^lete. 

It might perhaps be possible to acclimate the pelican in Europe, in 
full liberty. He would find himself so expatriated that he might not 
attemi)t to escai»e. Should his wings be allowed to grow his first 
trials of flight would not permit liim to tliink of undertaking along 
journey; at most, he might visit the surrounding country the first 
year. Care being taken to keep him captive in September — the period 
of migration — we might in a country wherein hunting them was pro- 
hibited treat ourselves to the curious sight of the evolutions of these 
great water birds which are as amiable as the swans which we have 
are stupid and miscliievous. 

The Swan. — There are two cities where the swan is easily observed, 
Geneva and London. The foggy atmosphere of the Thames does not 
permit of keeping them in sight very long, moreover they look very 
melancholy on that foul stream. 

To observe them thoroughly, there is but one spot — the lake of Cleu- 
eva. There these beautiful birds are (piite at home, and act as if they 
owned the whole lake. 

They build tlieir nests in the moats of the city, and make the rounds 
to beg, or rather to collect their daily rations of bread, as far asVille- 
neuve. They even do more, they follow the steamboats and dip down 
to gather food thrown o\ev to them; then when the boat has gained a 
mile or two ahead, they resume their flight, catch up with the shij) aMd 
settle in its wake. 

Their flight is a composite of beats of small amplitude, alternated 
with rectilinear glidings. They do not wheel in circles like the pelicans 
and birds of prey; they always proceed in a straight line, like tlie 
ducks, the geese, and in fact like all birds which have but little propor- 
tional surface at their command.

The fircaf rared-Oirl. — T1k> ureat eaicd-owl is a curious creature, ainl a 
.painter's brush would better describe him than a pen. Those great 
horn-like ears, those large yellow eyes, that plumage spotted with crosses 
and drops, the noise wliich he nnikes when snapping his bill, wliich 
miglit be mistaken for that of a crackling bone; everything in fact, 
even its attitudes, give it a satanic air, little like anything in this world. 
But let ns disregard this infernal asjx'ct, and examine him in broad day. 

It is a large bird of prey; its talons are strong, its wings are power- 
ful; its beak, while almost entirely hidden beneath the hairy feathers 
protecting its nostrils, is nevertheless strong and with a force not 
found in the bill of most diurnal l)irds of prey. Its ears are very 
large; Ave see at hrst sight, that in consequence of the enormous 
develo])ment of this organ, the sense of hearing must exist in great 
perfection. This grouj) of brilliant (lualities, joined to a reckless 
courage, render this bird an animal of extraordinary power. 

The great eared-owl might dispute with the eagle the empire of air. 
The eagle is like the lion; he has the noble look of royalty, whilst the 
tiger, which has only a brilliant reputation for ferocity, might easily 
dispute for the prey should both meet on the same hunting grounds. 




Ul'p;it cared-Ou'l. 



Let us consider the bird further, lor we are confronted with a re- 
markable creature. His bony frame is robust, his feathers are like 
hose of all nocturnal l)irds, of velvet like softness; but this soft down 
covers muscles with a dilferent order of action from those of the eagle; 
they are shorter, quicker, and more rigid in their contraction; the 
lever arms are longer. Tiic tliglit is a marvel; it is excessiA'ely comi)li- 
cated in action. Jle soars perl'ectly well but rarely does so; he rows 
like a pigeon, and possesses moreover the faculty of stopping suddenly 
when at full sjiced, and of glancing off in another direction. This he 
does to avoid collision with tree trunks at every monuMit. The tiiglit 
is absolutely silent. We see these large creatures Hash under the 
foliage, and we do not hear a nuirmur. This silence results from the

THE EMI'IHE OF THE AlR. 489 

coiifoniiiitiou of the featlicrs, wlijcli ;ire not constructed like tbose of 
dim iial birds, aud the sliock of the <iiiills af>aiiist eacli other is dead 
eiied by an exeeediugly soft down. It is ouly at dawn, in the spring-, 
that the bird is to be seen liigh in air; tlien an occasional couple is 
seen wheeling- up high, but as the day advances they rapidly come down 
and make for their gloomy dens, Avliere they remain crouched till sunset. 
One evening 1 witnessed the setting out of two owls on their hunt. I 
had clind)ed with a young guide to a cavern high up, and we looked down 
upon the pine forest. The day was dying away. We were sheltered be- 
hind a large rocky shoulder which hid us perfectly, and there we waited. 
Five minutes after sunset an owl appeared, as if by enchantment, 
perched on a rock in front of the cavern. We had neither seen nor 
heard it come. A few instants later a second bird appeared, taller and 
larger than the first; this was the female, and it was huge; its height 
was at least 31 inches. They slowly turned their horned faces from 
side to side, then one awakened the echoes of tlie valley with three 
piercing notes, and yet harmonious, in the fashion of screech-owl melody. 
Tlie voice is strange and impi'csses much. Then the male descended 
to a rivulet tlowing from the glacier; the female followed; they drank, 
bathed their faces a little and re-asccndcd to the rock where first we 
saw them. There they dried themselves and smoothed their feathers, 
and then they began to dance. I had been told beforehand of this 
performance and it had been described in terms so excessive that I had 
not believed; but now I witnessed the most grotesque scene v*'hich can 
be imagined. Fancy two huge creatures, by no means elegant, S|)ringiug 
into the air alternately like jumping jacks. sua])ping their beaks by way 
of accompaniment. 

At this extraordinary sight a wild guffaw escai)ed me; the shepherd 
l^ut his hand upon my arm to beg for silence. 1 looked for the l)irds 
and they were gone, the rock was bare; they iiitted away as silently as 
theycame. I visited their eyrie; there was scattered aboutsome 400 orr»00 
pounds of bon(\s, cliieHy of the hare, of tips of ])artridges' wings, and 
of the balls of hair rijected trom the l)ird's stomach. 

1 possessed a couple of these biids in captivity. They were the 
young of the pair 1 have just described. During the ensuing year the 
little shepherd took them from the nest and brouglit tliein tome. 

These birds, althougli th<'ir wing s})rea<l is nearly feet across, 
flew ])erfectly well in a cage 1«» by 40 feet. They went in ditferent di 
recti(ms, making several wlioh' rounds without coming to rest, while 
the large diurnal birds of ])re,\- in th(» same cage c(»ntined themselves 
to single. journeys lengthways, passing over tiie space with three noisy 
b(>ats of wing. 

The Heron type. — This table comprises birds jxjssessing large sustaining- 
surfaces in proportion to their weight. Now what is nature's object in eii- 
(]<'>wingthem with such excess in thatdirection *. Itis]m)bably to enable 
them to soar in calm weather when the wind is light, and above all to

THE EMPIRE OF THE AIR.

aliuht without hrojikiiij;' their leg-s. It is <'U'ai' however that tkey are 
lianipered by this excess ofsiirtace; not one of them is remarkable as 
a Hyer, neither as to velocity — which is easily ex|)laiiie(l, noi- even as a 
permanent denizen of the air — which is more extiaordinary. 

They are in foct so well eqniitjsed for sailing,' on li<>'ht winds that the 
surlace resistance destroys all the other qnalities when the breeze 
fresliens. It is only when the weight becomes 4 ponnds or more that 
tlie mass momentum succeeds in overcoming the fri(;tion of the air 
against these over-feathered wings. 

The birds first named in the table Hy as unsteadily as the butterfly; 
the hoopoe, the armed plover, and the laj^wiug can advance against 
strong winds only by comj)letely folding- their wings. This deflciency 
diminishes with the increase in weight. The ibis flies better than the 
small heron, and both are distanced bv the storks. 




Kui. <i. — TliK urcy Horon. 

We tind proof in this type tluit the useful, active surface of the wing 
lies in the hand and the forearm, and that the arm remains almost 
quiescent in flapping. The demonstration is i)al]table, as is ever the 
case in nature. The feathers of the humerus have been simply sup- 
pressed in most of the herons, and only those of the covert remain, 
which latter feathers aic merely ornamental. 



Tite Ix-cslrcJ Falcon. — The kestrel is common in France. It inhabits 
our large cities. It is known by all observers, and they doubtk'ss have 
gathered their best knowledge from its evolutions. Its strength is great 
and it always rows when hunting; but when there comes a change of 
weather and the soutli wind sets in, then the creature climbs u|) soaring 
into the sky and exhibits its talents as a sailing bird, which talents are 
fully as great as might be expected from its mass. 

The peregrine Falcon. — A rare bird, and therefore dillicult to study. 
An astonishing rower, reaching at times a velocity almost unique; the 
IjigeoUj the duck are then greatly out-distanced. - - - 



442 



THE EMPIRE OF THE AIR. 



It soars well, but only wlieu at leisure. It weighs 1.32 pounds, and 
its surface amounts to 1.72 square feet, being in the proj)ortion of 1.3 
square feet to the pound. 




Fig. 



-Kestrel Falcon. 



Eagles. — With the fish-hawk {Pandion fltiinalis) we reach the heavy 
birds. We still find a bird which beats the air, but already the le- 
sults of inertia are manifest. When the mass is 2 pounds or more there 
appears a steadiness in flight not found among the 1-pound birds. 




Fig 8.— rcrcgiine Fakon. 

The small eagles of Europe and of Africa, the imperial eagle with white 
back (AfjniJa heJiaca), and the great golden e;igle {Aqirila chri/.sai-f(() 
found in the Alps, all liave the same modes of flight. Their talents 
as sailing birds increase with their weight. 

Tlie necessities of their existence require many different qualities : 
First, they must be able to remain easily in the air, in order to survey 
the field, to watch a possible prey for whole hours; therefore they 
must be able to soar well, and this they do to perfection. Once the 
prey discovered, there needs be great speed to capture it, for often it is 
a duck, and a duck flies very fast; or it is a hare to be caught on the 
run, and this is not at all an easy enterprise. To gain this great speed 
the eagle utilizes gravity; he lets himself drop 200 or 300 yards, and 
employs the velocity so acquired with great dexterity to catch the 
game. These violent hunting exerticms in catching other rapid animals 
require an enormous muscular power on the part of these birds. 



THE EMPIRE OP THE AIK. 443 

A few eagles are to be found in Savoy; they are tlie finest, i)ut they 
are rare. Some few are also to be seen in Egypt, l-'rom time to time a 
passing bird is seen with an unusual ligure; when it is far distant one 
remembers that it is jin eagle. In Algeria I was enabled to observe 
this creature close at hand. In winter there were always three or four 
stationed some 200 yards from my farmhouse. They were hunting 
for wild ducks on a drowned meadow. Sometimes they came to in- 
spect my barnyard, but from a distance, as they were not well re- 
ceived. Upon the whole, they kept nearly as far away as one would 
desire for a chicken's sake, for it does not take long to pick ui> a fowl. 
There is a tremendous outcry from the roosters, then a terribh', hissing 
and scuffle, and an unhappy egg producer is seen ascending into the 
air, strewing her feathers by the way during her dizzy rise. 

The tales which are told of the eagle letting his prey drop when a 
gun is fired at him, even when beyond range, are perfectly true. 
Only in this, as in all else, it must be done at the proper moment. I 
once caused the experiment to be tried by a sportsman who doubted 
the fact. He made such haste that the eagle had not had time to kill 
the duck before letting him go; the result was that the eagle went one 
way and his victim another. As both by that time were three times 
beyond range, we had to be content with looking on. 

Xot far from there, grew two great ash trees, where often in the 
spring eagles were seen in pairs. Here it was that occurred that 
wondrous tour de force of rising in the air, advancing against wind, 
an observation of prime importance already described in a i^recediug 
chapter. 

The (jreat golden Emilc. — Here is undoubtedly the king of the birds. 
He possesses strength and courage. Having no enemy his equal, he 
peacefully passes long days in the beatitude of uncontested autocracy. 
The eagle fears none but man, and even him he fears but little. IJrought 
to bay, he does not hesitate to liurl himself at his enemy. In captiv- 
ity he is at first exceedingly dangerous; his ferocious temper renders 
him an untamable animal. It re(iuires great skill to succeed in im- 
|)r(^ssing him with fear, and moreover he must not be excited, for then 
he will fight to the death. 

Nature has created liim to keep down undue increase. In this he is 
like tlie felin (tigers, etc.), the sijwtU's (<log-fish, etc.), and tlie esox 
(])ike etc.) This tyrant of the air is abundantly ])r(»vide(l with all the 
weapons necessary for his innrderous life. His arms consist in eight 
talons as long as a finger, <'urvc<l and shar[) pointed and mo\ed by 
terrible mu.scles. His much-iiooiscd l)cak serves him to <'ar\«' the ani- 
mal perforated by his talons. 

His wings are large and exceedingly strong. They arc i)re- 
eminently adapted to sailing flight. He rarely beats the air unless 
there is no wind, or unless he is loaded with a prey. Pen is i)owei- 
less to depict the majesty of liis gait, the amplitude of the immense 



444 THE EMPIRE OF THE AIR. 

circles wliicb. he sweeps in the air. At times he is a,l)solutely motion- 
less. He is examining" the field or watching a i^rey; then snddenly he 
drops hundreds of yards. He falls like a meteor with the velocity of 
bodies falling through space. 

The speed is such that it produces a sound difficult to describe. It is 
not like that of the bullet or of the cannon ball, but must be heard to 
get a tiue conception. Then, when within a dozen feet of earth, his 
wings' great sti'ength safely checks his descent; and this at once — iu 
half a second — merely by expanding his wings to their full spread. 

His skill is wonderful; never a miss makes he. His eyes are excellent ; 
trom high up in the air he spies out the rabit hiding in the thicket, or 
the inconspicuous duck swimming among the reeds. He uses his talons, 
the arms with which he kills, in a remarkably skillful manner. In cap- 
tivity, when he is hungry, he catches on the tiy the morsels of meat 
thrown to him with a single claw, and never misses them if they pass 
within his reach. His movements have all the precision of those of 
small birds. He is free, quick, sharp, and j)owerful in his movements; 
above all, his coup cVwil, the power of taking all in at a glance, is very 
remarkable. As the motor muscles of the eye-ball are but little devel- 
oped, he is compelled to turn his head whenever he desires to see any- 
thing sharply. His head then assumes splendid poses ; his eye, that 
brilliant gem set under a deep arch, darts out lightning glances; his 
curved beak, his savage air, his sharp head feathers bristling up and 
forming a diadem — all that ensemble of vehement sweeping outline — 
make the eagle a model of power and of audacity. 

He lords it over a territory which he always selects of vast extent. 
All the smaller mammals dread him; the young of larger animals fear 
to be seen by him; the young chamois crouches up to its dam, the old 
bucks call the herd and stamp their feet with fury. Man himself — in 
infancy — has been attacked by him. 

He is intelligent only from a hunting i^oint of view. A very interest- 
ing spectacle it is, that of a family of eagles making a hnttne in order 
to furnish the nest with provisions. 

The male is up 100 yards in air, quite motionless, the female is 
beating the thickets; her flight while doing this has an ease of gi?eat 
elegance; she follows the uiululations of the ground without effort; 
glides from one hill to another, descends and re-ascends the mountain 
slope; then when a prey appears the two spouses are upon it almost 
at the same time. It often happens that a hare starting up 10 yards 
from the female is caught by the male, who was stationed 100 yards, in 
the air; he dives head foremost, is upon the prey in four or live sec- 
onds, and picks it up on the fly; then, if he is in the mountains, he first 
plunges m the valley with his load, and with great wing-beats re-as- 
cends to his eyrie. There the spoils are divided, and this never takes 
place Avithout much dispute, spite of the charms of matrimonial bonds. 

Aside from this old leaven of ferocity, which constantly appears, the

446 THE EMPIRE OF THE AIR. 

family is perfectly well brought up, and above all abundantly sup- 
plied with uourishment. Duriug the education of their young, fam- 
ilies of eagles consume enormous quantities of game; the eaglets dur- 
iug this period require much food in order to furnish material for the 
growtli of their great feathers. Nature then inspires the parents with 
an activity, which, happily for neighboring hares and rabbits, has 
nothing in common with their usual indolence. During this time, this 
period of activity, lasting a month, there is no respite; the vicinity of 
the eyrie is generally encumbered with putrefying carcasses ; but luckily 
the crows have an eye out for everything which is spoiling, and possess 
the audacity to go for it even in the eagle's nest. All things con- 
sidered, the crows run little risk; they are so adroit that even in a very 
confined space they manage to escape. 

The great golden eagle, which I possessed for years, had always a 
magpie with him. There is no sort of malicious trick that this mis- 
cliievous little creature did not play upon his terrible and taciturn 
companion, but he received no more attention than the tomtits, which 
may be seen with the telescope ro^ang among the branches among 
which the nest of the eagle is built. 

The eaglets, after a month and a half, are as big as papa and mam- 
ma. Tlieir first flights are timid enough and the parents then follow 
rliem with peculiar solicitude; then little by little, as skill in flight and 
hunting increases, the family attection wanes, the eyrie is abandoned, 
and each by degrees becomes a hunter upon his own account. - - - 

Two eagles are rarely seen together when they have no young ones. 
Those shut up together in cages, all perish in the same manner, from 
a stroke of the talon, xienetrating the brain. 

Vultures. — Let us rest long in our studies of this type of flight, for 
it is full of useful instruction: this is the type which will lead man to 
navigate the immensity of space. 

This great family of birds solves the problem of remaining in the air 
with the least expenditure of force; we may even say, in other words, 
that it is that Avhich flies, or rather soars, with the utmost science. 
The life needs of the creature, here as everywhere, determine its kind 
of talent. The vulture, to make a living, must rise to a great height 
thence to gain a large field of observation, and he must there long 
remain without fatigue. 

I*^ow consider the construction of this bird. His weight is very 
great, his wings are immense, both in length and breadth; his large 
proportional surface sustains him, and his great mass stores u^) mo- 
mentum. So we see him after a few beats of wing, at once begin to 
soar, climbing up in the air and floating there with no expenditure 
of force, save for the start and for guidance. Certain sj)ecies of vul 
tures, particularly the larger, absolutely can, upon a windy day, leave 
their perch in the morning, travel many leagues, si)end the whole day 



THE EMPIRE OK THE AlK. 447 

in the air, and ,i;t'r back to tlu'ir ]>er('li at nij^lif wit hunt one single beat 
of their \viu<;s. 

In this family, velocity is only usefnl to the snialler si)ecies, which 
are, after a fasliion, the purveyors of the larger ; therefore the Egyptian 
vultures, the turkey-bu/.zards, the urubus, having to execute more 
varied movements exjx'nd much m(ue force. 

Now, here is the way a vulture s})ends his day upon one or the otlier 
continent. The hirger si)ecies Inne spent the night perched among 
rugged and inaccessible rocks, where they gather for shelter from tlie 
wind, if they have neither eggs nor ycmug ones. The turkey-buzzards 
and the Egyptian A'ultures have been roosting in tlu' lower regions, 
they are less tierce and much more intelligent. The sun comes out and 
dries the dew collected on their feathers; the vultures stretch their 
wings, limber u}> the Joints and trim the growing (luills with all the 
care that the maintenance of an essential organ needs. About 7 
o'clock there are many flappings of the great wings, but without <piit- 
ting the perch; then they sink their heads between their shoulders and 
resume their sinister, forbidding' look. Between 8 and 9 o'clock the 
hreeze begins to rise; once in a while the culture glances into the 
valley through those nuigniftcent eyes, unique in creation for their 
power, then with four or five great beats of wing he launches into space. 
Tie descends some 50 yards on rigid wings, and is tiien in full sailing 
flight. The smaller species, who are earlier risers, are already at work 
and searching for food. 

Tiie large vultures sail at heights which vary with the species. The 
tawny vultures, the Sarcoiami)hes or p<ip(( of South America, gener- 
ally keep at elevations of ."iOO or 600 yards in the air; they are scarcely 
visible from the giound. The arriaii vultures, the otogyps, the con- 
dors usually float much higher: they become (juite invisible. 

The arrian vultures surv^ey the movements ot the tawny vultures, who 
in turn ha\ <• an eye upon the Egyi)tian vultures, which latter again 
Avatch the doings of the kites, and esi)ecially of the crows. 

In America the urubus is watched by the turkey-buzzard, the latter 
b.\ the pojui, and this last by the condor. 

As all these great birds of prey thus establish a c(»ni|)l(Me net-work of 
()bservation over the earth, from the mere fact of mutual surveillance, 
just as soon as a meal is found all the neighbors close by start in that 
diiection, they are at once followed by the others, and thus they 
assendjle very rapidly. 

They scent the carcass, is the coiniiioii e\i)ression. In point of fact 
this is <piite im-orrect, being impossible if the birds are to windward of 
the dead animal. Their olfactory apparatus is so little deNcloped that 
it is <|uite insufticient to guide them to a carcass, even close at hand. 
This may be easily tested by hiding some tainted meat and attracting 
a \ulture to tln^ neighborhood. He will pass close to it withont find- 
ing the meal; his sense of smell will not have revealed it. 



448 



THE EMPIRE OF THE AIR. 



The attitudes of these birds in the air are particularly worthy of at- 
tention. Their aspect when sailing upon a wind of about 11 miles per 
hour, which velocity is best adapted to exhibit their faculties, becomes a 
most interesting: study of iiight without beat of Aving. 

It is clear that to rise upon so feeble a current of air they must 
spread all their surface. At this speed of 11 miles per hour the Egyj>- 
tian vulture holds his wings to an even straight line; the Gypoierax 
cathartoide slightly brings the tips of his pinions forward: the tawny 
vulture advances them so much that the angle produced in front is 
165°; the oricou or Nubian vulture goes much further, to make a sat- 
isfactory sketch of his attitude in flight, would require an angle of 

The (/red f tuinuj Vulture. — We are now face to face with our desi- 
deratum. Look at his beak! We might disregard his talojis, but the 
beak is terrible, of a force not to be imagined; garments are insuffi- 
cient to protect a man from this beak. 




l<'l(i. St. — Tli(^ tawny Vulliirc 

Once he is dead, your gorge rises, for the smell is horrible. This 
odious perfume is in no way fugacious, for it persists worse than musk; 
the whole body of the animal is impregnated with it. The room in 
which it remains for only a few hours will not lose that nauseating 
odor for many months. Then look out for lice; they are of good hg- 
ure. The tirst of the enormous parasites one sees, wandering over 
one's clothes, causes inexpressible astcmishment. However, notwith- 
standing its size, it is not dangerous, for it does not become accli- 
nuited to man. 

But, passing by these petty annoyances, what a magnificent animal 
we have before our eyes. Here we have alar spread of 8 feet or more 
of wing, a weight of Ki pounds for this admirable living aeroplane. 
Beyond him there are but three or four varieties which suri)ass him in 
size, but without causing us to forget him. In any case he is (piite 
their brother in sailing flight. 

Little need be said concerning the oricou [otomips)^ save that the 
closest attention is re([uired to recognize them in any group. 

As to the condors, inasmuch as tlu^ir confoumation is the same as

iug a mistake, that their ino(h' of perfonuauce in th(» air is ])ra('fi(*ally

category: they even exaggerate this tendency. ^Vll these lai-ge birds 
only beat the air when there is a di^ul calm, an atniosi)heric cinaim-

their support it is rarel\' the traiujuillity of the air which keeps them

omy of tlieir mode of iiiglit ; they are proportioned to sail well

wind where all aboard ship is clewed np yon will see them in full 
activity, chasing ardently and moving with ease — they are in tlu'ir 
element; there is no beating tln^ air; they are then, as it were, set on 
two rigid supports, much carved downwards, skimming the wave with 
astonishing i)re»-ision, lingering it with their wing tips, rising and 
descending with the billows without ever being overtaken. These 
same birds, in a wind of 11 miles per hour, a ligiit breeze, are com-

pelled to settle down on the water, to dabble aronnd like common 
ducks; while in this same wind the great land-sailing birds sweep 
with ease those great circles whicli transport them, without fatigue, 
up to (Uiormous lieights. 

Thus the vulture is the bird which can utilize the feeblest current of 
air in order to obtain sustaining power; he exaggerates the type of 
what we might call permanent rest in the air, 

I have already said — and I repeat it, a large vulture can make long 
flights without once beating the air. I have seen the following perform- 
ance, not once but a hundred times: At the abattoirs of oriental cities 
vultures are to be seen in great numbers, waiting a propitious moment 
to get at their food, and sustaining themselves in the air meanwhile 
without a single beat of wing. They nioTint up out of sight, they de 
scend within 200 yards of earth, advance against the wind, glide with 
the wind, slide to the right or left, cruising in a sin.gle hour over all 
the surrounding country to see if there be not a dead animal more easy 
of access; and they perform these maneuvers the whole day long, 
making twenty ascensions of 1,000 yards each, gliding over 100 leagues, 
and all this without one single stroke upon the air. 




l'"ii;. ] 1. — Oricou or Nubian Vulture. 

When you go still-hunting for a tawny vulture, take notice how he 
first comes into sight; he does not then appear to be a large bird. At 
the altitude at which he habitually soars lie a})pears of exactly the 
same size as the kites and the Egyptian vultures; he makes no more 
impression than they. You will however learn quickly to distinguish 
him l)y the angle to the front produced by his wings, by the absence 
of wing beats, and above all, by the slowness and steadiness with 
which he moves in space. This is an infallible sign by which to re- 
cognize him as far as the eye can reach. It is oidy nuu-h later that his 
true size will be understood, Avhen he is only L*00 or 'MM) yards oft"; 
and as he approaches within that distance lu^ will grow in ai>pear- 
ance much faster than other birds. You will further distinguish him 
by the peculiar spread of his wing tips. We may say that this is

Still anotlier ix'culiarity: th<' primary Teatlieis, instead of taperini^'

be implanted into the wini^' l»y the tlnn end; the onter tip being' mate- 
rially wider than the i)arl whieli seems to l)e attached to the wing, and 
wliieh prececU^s the main widening of the barbs. Thes<' hirge feathers, 
widest at their tip and s])read asnnder. ])resent a curious outline which 
would ])Iease artists greatly i1 tliey could observe this bird in his 
native habitat. 

To the ])eeuliar construction described wennist add theeffetds of the 
paitial rotation of the quills within their sockets, which action is ob- 
served only in these large birds. These quills uinst be wonderfully 
strong and elastic, for the birds put them to sev(n'e proofs. During 
the efforts winch he nnikes when starting nj) from the ground and when 
his pectoral mnscles are doing their ntmost. the tips of the feather 
point directly to the zenith. Tn short, from every point of view these 
great birds, when free, are exceedingly interesting to observe. There 
are altitudes, (ptite unknown to those who only see the bir<l in museums, 
which would confer success on an animal painter, il' he reproduced 
them. 

But there nuist be freedom; otherwise, we have only eagles motion- 
less as milestones, or ill-smelling \ultures worrying themselves to 
death, tlieir Iseads smothered between their shoulders: tw(» aspects 
which have nothing in comnnm with that of these kings of air ])roudIy 
traversing the immensit,> of the skies. The one circumstam-e Mhich 
frequently deprives tin* observer of the chan<'(^ of witnessing their in- 
teresting evolutions is the bird's alarm. At the slightest apprehen- 
sion these great creatures resort to rowing Hight, they desire to get 
rapidly beyond dang<H'. so tlnit de\('loi)ing all their powers with strokes 
of wing they (pnckly Hy away. 

Their ])ower of vision must be great ; we may safely assume this, 
because these birds, of all flying creatures, are those whose mode of life 
requires the most extensive views. 

A sparrow ihhhIs a tield ol" \ie\\ ol' but a l\-\\ hundred yards: a more 
powerful organ of sight would be needless, and therefore atro))hied in 
a few generations; the sea birds need to obserse the surface of the 
w-aves for only some dozen yards or so. It is not among' these creatures 
that we nnist seek Ibi' those ])ertect lenses. cai)able of collecting all 
divergent I'ays of light. 

The hunting biids of prey, such for instance as the falcons and the 
eagles, often scrutini/.e the surface of the grouiul from a great height; 
the latter birds, especially-, sometimes maintain themselves at an ele- 
vation of 4()(» or o(Kj vards while hunting; but what is that distance 



452 THE EMPIRE OF THE AIR. 

wheu coiuparecl with the -i or 4 miles required l>y the vultures to study 
their field of research ? 

We may safely conclude that the constant necessity for seeiug further 
than other birds has caused them to ac<iuire in tlie oi<>an of vision a per- 
fection not possessed by other birds. We must therefore be ourselves 
invisible to be able to witness their extraordinary evolutions when 
sailing-; or bettt-r still, we must seek tlumi in the primitive countries 
where tliey have not yet learned to be atiaid of man, and even there 
we should wear adress which shall not attract their attention, for other- 
wise they will not come down to a meal. 

In order to see these birds. French observers nuist leave home. There^ 
are no vultures nearer than the high plateaus of central Auvergne, the 
Al]hs, and the Pyrenees, where there may be found (very rarely how- 
ever) the (fyps orridcntali.s, which is — on a smalhn- scale. — the dupli- 
cate of Gyps fiilriis. (»r tawny vulture of Africa. 

If chance does not l»ring to us one of the latter master soareis, we 
nuist entice him : a dead carcass planted in some isolated sjjot is tlie 
l)est means to attiact him. By crossing the Mediterranean to Algeria 
one is certain, with a ]>ro])er bait, to see the bird, particularly in 
the autumn; for it is rather an uncertain enterprise to endeavor to lind 
him in northern Africa in <»ther months than Septeml)er, October, ami 
November. There are undoubtedly a few at all seasons, Init it is only 
during those three months that they are in considerable numbers; 
either in consequence of their annual migrations from north to south, 
or from other causes. In any case, even where there are many they are 
not uniforndy abundant. Sometimes we may chance upon a Hock of a 
hundred, and then remain for years without seeing them excejDt afar off. 

It is unfortunately an unknown bird to those interested in the prob- 
lem of tiight, for not one person in a hundred has seen it in the air. In 
Algeria, even in Cairo, (where there are some sailing over the city every 
day during three months of the year,) most of the P]uropean residents 
are unaware of their existence. But when tlui student takes the pains 
to go where the bird is to be found; when he sees this great animal, large 
as a sheep, ])aiufully rising from the ground with strokes upon the air 
whose hissing is heard 300 yards away in the silence of the desert; 
when he sees them afterwards describing their endless sweeps, he ap- 
X)reciates this most interesting sight; every human being is chained to 
the spot; even the Arab is stirred Avith emotion; for in this bird we 
have found motion under a new aspect; it resembles as to majesty and 
impressiveness the a(;tion of a locomotive at full speed. 

When we watch a martin Hashing through space we think of high 
speed mechanism; wheu it is a snipe or a partridge which flies off, we 
are reminded of the action of a released sirring; a gull suggests per- 
l^etual motion or the endless sweep of a pendulum; but the view of the 
great vulture in sailing flight inspires at once the desire for imitation; 
it is a dirigible parachute which man may hojie to re-produce.

THE EMPIRE OF THE AIR. 



THEOEY OF THE ABKOPLANE. 

Vertical and horizontal equilihriirm. — To clianjie the equipoise of bis 
aeroplane in the vertical direction, the sailing bird makes use of bis 
tail, which under the action of the imping air serves in all respects as 
a rudder; but be has a much more energetic means of displaying bis 
center of gravity, which consists in altering bis center of tignre; thiit 
is to say by changing the form of bis sustaining surface, and by dis- 
placing it in relation to his body. 




Fig. 12. — Winus in iionunl attitudr 



When the bird has disposed bis organs of sailing iligbt in proper 
equipoise, when bis ai-roijlane is set for efficient progress, as for example 
in Fig. 12, should any necessity whatever require him to ascend sud- 
denly, he will not enii)l()y bis tail for that purpose, especially if it be a 
feeble one, because it will not produce snfficient action, but be stretches 
Ills wings forward, Fig. 1.). His center of gravity and bis center of 
hgure thus recede decidedly to the rear, and upward gliding and ascen- 
sion must follow. 




Fk;. It!. — AA'ings jn-ojcctetl. 

If, on the other hand, the bird assumes the following attitude. Fig. 14, 
the center of gravity being carried forward produces downward gliding. 

These displacements, jn^oduced at will by the variable position of tiie 
wings and the guidance obtained by the action of the air on the tail, 
constitute the bird's directing })ower in a vertical direction. 

As to gnidance in the horizontal direction, it is very simply brought 
about. It is also almost always procured through the derangement in 
the equipoise of the a-'roplane, except with birds having very ample 
tails and tlius possessing an organ capable of •this service; these use 
it constantlv, as witness the naucler and the kite. 



THE EMPIKE OF THE All?. 



455 



When a t>ii(l is swecpin.u in a circle, the w iii:^' iM)iiitiii.i;- towa.ids the 
center of that circle is always less extended Mian tiiat wliich sweeps 
the circnnitereiice, so that when a sailin,u' bird is seen slightly to fold 
one of liis wings, it may l)e known that lie is about to turn towards 
that side. 




Fl(i. 14.— Wiiiiis ivtr:irte(l 

The whole l)ody aids in this movement: the whole bird bears itself 
to that side, the tail, even when rudimentary and heiu-e feeble in action, 
concurs in the execution of tliis maiuenver. It is an instinctive action 
among the feather<'d tribe, Just as with man. wlu'ii he uses his arms to 
equilibrate himself on his legs. 

The two wings never balance each other perfectly; one side is 
always heavier than the other, as the surfaces are not equally divided. 
Differences in weights and surfaces cause a tilt towards the side most 
lieavily loaded or exj)osing least surface, as the case maybe; hence 
aeroplanes, wliether machines or birds, always tend to sweep to one 
side or the other. To obtain rectilinear [)rogTession some corrective 
force must intervene. In the animated ai-roplane this force consists in 
life: in artificial flying apparatus man will needs i)rodiu;e this force. It 
might be i)0ssible to jn'oduce rectilinear progression automatically, in 
large aero]iIaues, by means of electrical apparatus, in which contacts 
wouhl be made through the use of nu'rcury which would seek its level. 

When we observe attentively a sailing bird gliding in a strong and 
irregular current of wind, we are struck with the lapidity with which 
the center of gravity is shifte<l in order to satisfy the needs for supi)()rt 
and for maintaining the course. A ])u1f of wind immediately results 
in a Hexing of wings, their tips swing to the rear, the center of grax- 
ity advances in consequence, and thus neulrali/.es the increased i)res- 
sure ]>roduced by tin* acceleration in the current of air. 

This adroit evolution, performed just at the right time, which at first 
sight seems to be an instincti"\(' action of the creature, is probably after 
all simply automatic. We may be assured that this change in form of 
surface, this alteration in the ecpiipoise is not jn-oduced by tlie con- 
scious vital acti(Ui of the ner\'«'s, but is simply a phenomenon of nniscu- 
lar elasticity. The bird receives the shock of the wind unconsciously, 
his attention is otherwise engaged, his wings ar<' stretched at their 



456 THE EMFIKE OF THE AIR. 

usual tension. When tbey encounter a pressure jj;Teater tluin usual, 
the tips yield, swinin' to the rear, and automatically perform the nec- 
essary manceuver. 

In mechanical aeroplaues it will be indispensable, and very easy, to 
iniitate nature in this act; two springs of calciilated strength, main- 
taining the wings in the i)Osition of ordinary equipoise, might very 
well answer the purpose. 

It follows from the facts just stated that it is probable that birds often 
sail unconsciously. This is the conclusion resulting from attentive 
observation. Whosoever has closely watched sailing birds will infer 
that during three-fourths of the time they expend neither force nor will 
power, that direct action on the part of the creature only occurs when 
he makes a decision, such as to change his gait or his direction. 

This line of thought leads us to fancy that the soaring birds sleep on 
the wing. Assuredly uo bird actually goes dead to sleep during flight, 
yet those sufficiently gift(>d to spend six or eight hours in the air for no 
particular purpose must reach a state nearly approaching slumber, and 
Avhich must be very restful. This may resemble the slumber of the 
horse while standing, in which he still retains sufficient control over his 
muscles to i)reserve the e([ui])oise on his four legs. 

How far will automatic mechanism permit man to progress with his 
aeroplanes! It is easy to foresee, at first glance, that he need take 
action only when first starting, upon reaching decisions, and in final 
alighting; the rest of the time his faculties maybe otherwise occupied, 
and it is quite certain that mere support will be attained without com- 
pelling him to intervene at eacli instant. 

MAIS -FLIGHT THEORETICALLY CONSIDERED. 

Is the reader then to infer that the author has dared to dream of 
surpassing nature in aerial evolutions'? It is certain that before talking 
of iml)ro^'ing upon nature, it would be more becoming to make an at- 
tempt to imitate her; not as a lord of creation, but as an humble adept. 
Yet, as the author has seriously contemplated producing a larger bird 
than any existing in nature, and as there may be some value in his 
thinkings, uotwithstandiug the deficiency of experiments, he will enter 
upon the question of possible man-flight. 

We are led to consider this question by nature herself; she occasion- 
ally lifts a corner of the veil through certain evolutions of her favorite 
children. In point of fact, when we continually observe the sailing 
birds, when we expend on this study nuich time, much action, and much 
thought, we are rewarded once in a while — rarely, itis true — by the sight 
of some mauttuiver which sets us to dreaming of its imitation. 

We say to ourselves upon observing it: But why does not the bird, 
instead of fatiguing himself by wheeling, rowing or struggling as he 
generally does, always employ his present evolution, so economical of 
force ? 



THE EiMPIRE OV THE AIR. 457 

The answer is simple. If tiiere be a ereatuie witli snpei-abiiii(laiit 
life, it is the bird. With liiiii, uioveiiieiit is not the r(\snlt ol' letlection; 
it proceeds IVoiii the i^reat excess of i)o\ver he possesses, and as lie 
knows no will bat his own, he can not resist the desire and follows 
it to the detiinieut ol' his force. 

The simple comparison of the ditferent modes of tli^ht is already a 
stt'i) towards success; we have been able to select one mode as most 
available to man, a.nd as best within the reach of his means of imita- 
tion. Let US take anotliei' step forward and consider which evolu- 
tions, anions' the numerous mano'uvers ])erfor)ned by our chosen type, 
the i;reat tawny vulture, it is most easy to re-produce, and what is 
most lu'otitalih' for our y)ur[)oses. Then, even while canvassing this 
selection, if we meet any hap])y thought, let us analyze it coolly but 
withont shyness; lor. by carryinj*' it to an extreme we may ]»erhaps 
tiud something' new. 

Assuredly, when man shall ha\e succeeded in utilizing the wind in 
tlight, he will bring to bear his ingenuity upon that art aiul it will 
enable him not only to imitate nature but to surpass her perform- 
ances. Thus it will not be impra(!ticable for him to prodnce a sailing- 
apparatus more steady and slow than the condor or the oiicou vnlture; 
or perhaps a motor machine possessing greater speed than the teal; 
this he will do by exaggerating the features of these different modes of 
flight. But he will excel especially in the profoujul study of the science 
of flight. He will not, like the bird, be constantly distracted by his 
necessities or by fear: every movement will be foreseen and provided 
for: every danger and contingency will be van(|uishedin advance, and 
he will need but to mind his evolutions — a duty which he will fulfill 
resolutely, with his characteristic science. 

As methods of getting about — not to mention tlie railway, the steam- 
boat, or the balloDU — man has invented, ont and out, two new modes 
of locomotion, complete in all theii' parts and with no analogue in 
nature: I mean the skate and the veIocii)ede: why then should lie not 
bring to [)iMfectioii a mode alr<'ad\' kiKtwn. which nothing warrants 
considering as having reached its utmost limit.' 

When the lirst dread has been coiu[uered, when the horror of empty 
sitace has been mastered through liabilude, intelligent man, after hav- 
ing re-produced all the ga.its of liie birds, will want to improv<' upon 
them. He will impure wiietlier there are not possibilities beyond them. 
Then with varied sustaining surfares lie will attempt to rise, advancing 
into the wind, or he will rise with a stern wind, both evolutions being 
performed without sweeping in circles; and beyond all this, he will 
attempt gliding-backward. 

With the wind dead against him, man will needs study whether it 
is most advantageous to rise direct, even advancing to windward, as 
in the case of the eagles already herein described, or to swee]) around 
in circles, thus driiting back and afterwards regaiuiug the lost ground 



458 THE EMPIRE OF THE AIR. 

at tlie expense of height. This last procedure is the one generally 
employed by the birds, but as we know that they can do better upon 
occasion, it might be well to experiment. Birds are like all inferior 
creatures: they do not like to tax their brain witli sustained attention, 
and the circling- sweep brings no tax upon their heads, while it enables 
them to search for food. Inasmuch as man will only desire to get 
forward over the ground, and possesses greater faculties for combina- 
tions than birds, the care in balancing required by direct ascension 
will be mere sport to him. 

With the wind abeam nothing is more simple. All there is to do, so 
to speak, is to allow ourselves to sail. The sailing l)irds while doiug 
this wear a happy look; the observer feels that they are laboring neither 
with body nor with brain, especially if the wind be brisk enough to 
sustain them well. If the breeze is feeble then they have to take to 
circling from time to time; but when it is sufficiently strong sailing on 
a quarter wind is certainly the most convenient, and it is the first mode 
which will be successfully employed by man. It will be the system 
causing the least difficulty, and which man will utilize much more than 
the bird, the former being always anxious to get to his journey's end. 

A brisk wind ought to permit of direct ascent, even if blowing from 
the direction sought; by fiiciug the wind and rising while drifting back, 
or even by receiving it in the rear of the a'roplane, that is to say by 
gliding with the wind during a lull, and turning an angle and descend- 
ing slightly during a puff of vrind. These two different mananivers are 
performed by the sailing birds, but they employ them so rarely that 
they nmy be said not to be in their line. With a good Avind, when we 
desire to ])roceed in its direction, both the ascent and the horizontal 
progress will be achieved in the latter manner. 

Summing up, even admitting that man shall invent no new manreu- 
vers, he will nevertheless have a choice among many, and their combi- 
nation will constitute what ought to be termed the human type of 
flight. We may condense our studies into a smaller compass and say: 
When the aiH-oplane enters into motion, its center of pressure varies in 
the direction of that motion and is displaced by an amount which 
varies with the speed. 

With machines ''heavier than the air" aerial navigation may be com- 
passed with two separate classes of apparatus: (1 ) By machines with 
propellers. (2) I)y aeroi^lanes without proi)ellers. 

The first class is (juite outside of my present design. Mechanical 
science will eventually furnish quite a number of different solutions; 
such as fiapping wings, propelling screws, rocket propulsion, etc. 

The second class — that is to say, the aeroplane without a propeller — 
it is the object of the i)resent essay to promote. What luis been stated 
herein permits me to affirm that in the flight of the sailing birds (the 
vultures, the eagles, and other birds which Hy without beating the 
air), ascension is produced by the skillful use of the force of the wind, 



THK EAiriHE OF THK AIK'. 451' 

and tliat the y-uidance is rlic result of skilUiil iiunidnivers; so that by 
a iiiodcrato wind a man can, with an ai'iophmc, un})r()vided with any 
motor whatever, rise ui> into the air and direct himself at will, even 
against the wind itself, ^fa-n therefore can, witii a rigid surface and 
a [)roperly designed a])paratus, repeat the niaineuvers of ascension 
and guidance performed by the soaring- birds, and Avill need to ex])en(l 
no muscular force whatever, save for guidance. 

As to the exaet shape to l)e given to the ai'roplane. it need not be 
discussed in this chapter, because there are many shapes an<l devices 
which may be e!n[>loyed; but all forms of apparatus, however dissimi- 
lar, must be based ufjon this idea, Avhich 1 repeat: ^Vsceusion is the 
result of the skillful use of the ])ower of the wind, ami no other force 
is required. 

It will doubtless be very difficult ibi' many i>ers(ins to admit that a, 
bird can, with a moderate wind, remain a whole day in the aii' with no 
expenditure of force. They will endeavor to sup{)ose some indiscern- 
ible pressures or souie imperceptible l)eats. In i)oint of fact the hu- 
man mind does not readily admit the above attirmation; it is astonished 
and seeks for all the evasions it can tind. xill those who have not seen 
the performance say, when ascension without expenditure of force is 
mentioned to them. ''Oh, well, there were some motions which escaped 
your observation." It even occurs sometimes that a chance or super- 
ficial observer who has had the good fortune to see this nunneuver 
well performed by a bird, when he tuins it over in his mind after- 
wards feels a doubt invading his understanding; the i)erformance 
seems so astonishing, so paradoxical, that he asks himself whether his 
eyes did not deceive him. 

Foi' observation of this manu'uver, in (nder to carry absoluti' con- 
viction, must bear ui)on the performance of the largest vultures, and 
ni»ou them alone, and this is the reason : it is because all the other birds 
which ascend into the air by this process do not i)erform the necessary 
decomposition of forces required in all its naked simplicity. 

if w(; observe small birds, we see (;reatures weighing only a lew 
ou)u^es, the martin, the bee-eater, etc., i)erform this nmnoniver in high 
winds and high, up in llui air. But even when carefully obseived with 
ate]esco]>e n doubt reniains, in conseiiuence of the enormous ]»(»wer of 
the mai'iin. wito can jn'o'ect himself forward more than a yard with a 
single beat of Ming. 

Th(? kites, buzzards, bustards, etc., when they rise, wheeling round, 
j)erlbrni such ci)iuplieate(l manoMivers as to permit a doubt. - - - 
To reach a vigorous, undeniable demonstration, we must discard even 
the great eagle, Avhose nnino'uver is not easily followed by the eye, and 
we must absolutely confine our observations to the vultures. Mere 
theorizing would never open up the conception of sailing fiight; more 
over, we may consider it a dead letter when human life is to be risked 
in experiment. The moral result of observation is inliiutelv more con- 



460 THE EMPIRE OF THE AIR. 

vincing-, but, alas, it is beyond the reach of most persons. It is not 
in Paris that tlie seeker will become couviuced, it is not even in Europe, 
where soaring birds are so rare that months; may pass without one 
being seen. 

In short, one nuist go abroad to enter tliis new path of investigation ; 
the path through wliicli I liave reached absolute conviction, and which 
must be followed by all who desire to know what can be done. If they 
will thus observe the soaring birds in their own habitat, they will 
doubtless witness all tlie performances which 1 have flescribed, and 
probably still others which have escaped me. 

But to be convinced a man must see; for to see, even only once, is 
better than a whole volume of explanations. Tlierefore, O reader, if 
you are interested in this subject, go and see for yourself and be 
edified. Go to the regions where dwell the birds which perform these 
demonstrations; and when you have beheld them for a few instants, 
being already initiated as to what to observe, comprehension will at 
once come into your understanding. 



Imperfeet maehiiies. — It is somewhat unfortunate that I have not suf- 
ficient space left for a little treatise upon ''paper arrows.'' This school 
boy's toy, simple as it may seem, is quite instructive when its principles 
are studied. The arrow may be constructed in various forms, from the 
acute triangle, which is the type of si)eed, to the broadside rectangle, 
the aeroplane type, proportioned like a stormy petrel, in which the plane 
is narrowest m tln^. direction of its motion. 

Moreover, we note that nature has not constructed all sailing birds 
upon the same model. If we compare the aspect of the great tawny 
vulture with that of the stormy petrel, who sails wonderfully in a high 
wind; or with the aspect of the tern, or the gannet, or the frigate-bird, 
when the latter assume their arrow-like forms, Ave shall licrceive that 
there is a great diversity of models; we might even say there is an 
antagonism in models, for we have noted that all of them are perfect 
in their flight as considered in relation to their life needs. But, not- 
withstanding these diversities, the gliding flight of each creature, 
whether supported on elongated or on square wings, is always based 
upon the same general principle; it results from the possibility of shift- 
ing the center of gravity by a change in the position of the sustaining 
surfaces, and this confers the faculty of maintaining equipoise in the air. 
Ai^roplanes, provided with the necessary sustaining surfaces, and 
equipped with this faculty, will be sufilicient to reproduce the sailing 
evolutions of the birds. We may now conclude, therefore, that a par- 
ticular, special shape is really not indispensable for aerial locomotion; 
all sorts of forms, even the most curious, may be utilized; only, they 
will produce the reipiired decompositions of forces, under the action of 
the wind, in the ratio of their individual perfections. 

Man may succeed in gliding on the wind with circular, triangular, 



THE EMPIRE OF THE AUI. 461 

or roctaii.uular forms, wirli ai'i'ia! rafts in the shape of an arrow, with 
irreguhii' forms even. pro\ ided always that lie can shift the center of 
gravity as retpiired; pro\ideil also, that the sustaining' snrl'ace be snlli- 
cient in extent, and that the si>eed of the wind, or the speed of the 
;ero])lane, shall be about -2 miles ])vv hour. 

The j)roblcm. thus broadly stated, leads to sonn^ curious conse(|Uences, 
Eventually, when success is achie\ed. we shall j)erhaps be <piite 
surprised to see some second-hand apparatus circulating;' in the air; 
some a'roplanes full of holes and rents, patclu'd u]), damai^ed and 
mended, holdin.u' together by the ^racc of Providence, and yet glidinjj;' 
along" after a fashion. These w ill n(»t be the best to resist the \icissi- 
tndes of the wind, but they will get along Just the sajue. >>()W. what 
is thei)roof of this :' 1 haxc conferred liberty upon kites and upon 
Egyptian Nultuies whose llying surfaces were in deplorable condition; 
some with wings almost [>lucke(l to bare ])oles, sonu' with a wing and a 
half only (this lack of counterpoise in their sustaining surfaces ti'ou- 
bles them greatly). I rt'memb<M' a particadar jxdican \\ ho glided upon 
an incredible ])aii' of wings, lie had lost six or se\ en ])rintary feathers 
at least, and the rest of his plumage was far from complete. Vvt, 
when the wind blew fresh, he launched out from slojjing ground and 
sonuitimes succeeded in getting under way. Once fairly u]) in air, In^ 
became most surprising. (Hiding upon his ragged wings he would 
skim within a yard of the observer, his ne<;k bent back, his head rest- 
ing upon Ids shoulders with an air ol' sn[)reme impertinence. He 
would go out for a tour over the sea, would come back to insj)ect the 
nuxrket, and comjilete his perigrinations by settling down on the 
waves. A most curious thing it was to see this creature, which was 
quite tanu', pass close at hand, very swiftly, near the spectators. He 
l)roduced a stiaiige sensation by gliding by with ease and no exertion. 
It was a foretastii of the pleasures of a-rial sj)eed — a sort of class-room 
gliding, in which the bird-jjrofessor was (eaching tin' beholdci's the art 
of sailing lliglit. 

After all these digi'essions, the main question which conu's up is the 
following: What is the least suiTace reouired to sustain a man and 
ai)paratus, weighing 17()])ounds? 

I'lu' exa(;t answer must be, ascertained by experiment : butwcnuiy 
even now say that it ])robably will astonish by its niedio(;i-ity. My 
own idea is that Sii square fe(^t will snlUce, as a nnninuim, to sustain 
170 jtounds in sailing flight.

ASprcKhifioii.s (IS to resiclt.s — Alter having discussed the bemdits to be 
derived from the conquest of the air. Ictus now consider the ])ertur- 
bations which it may cause. Let us see whether there is not some blot 
on the other side of the shield; tor so important an achievemeid as 
this new mode of locomotion can not take place without producing dis- 
turbances. 



462 THE EMPIRE OF THE AIR. 

Let us admit that tlie in-oblem is solved, and l<'t us sjx'culatc uitoii 
the effects upon society. Let us begin with property. Property will 
be riven with an enormous gap. With the patent insufiQeiency of in- 
closiire, with intrusion into the privacy of home, hedges, walls, will no 
longer be of service; the inclosure under the roof will be incom])lete 
and will need emendation. All this will constitute a curtailment of the 
privileges of possession, for a little consideration eA'ideuces the dimin- 
inished efficiency of barriers. AVe shall no longer be at home as here- 
tofore; there is no need to dwell <ni this, it is easily gras])(id. 

But what of the collectors of customs and tlie police in the ])resence 
of this new nu)de of locomotion ? They often fail to control existing 
ways of comnnmication which nevertheless are upon well-defined lines, 
wiiere all nuist pass and are easily inspected. What will these officers 
do when they must watch the air, that immense pathway some -L or 
5 miles liigli? During the day it may be ])0ssible to fancy some 
partly satisfactory surveillance; witli a large force, good telescopes, 
lust cruisers of the air, we might i)erliaps exercise some control, but 
it night, what is to be done? How can we bar the empire of air? 
How can we so much as watch it when opaque fog annihilates the ef- 
fects of ele(^tric reflectors? Smugglers will certainly have such facili- 
ties for plying their industry, that the only thing to do will be to sup- 
press the custom-house entirely. 

But then what will ])ecome of the revenues and the balance of the 
budget? These x>erturl)ations to property, to the customs, to the po- 
lice, are mere bagatelles when compared to the" perturbations which 
will result in political matters. After all there may be found in time 
means more or less sufficient to supervise the transportation of goods; 
men will become accustomed to the new limitation of privacy; but as 
to political matters we shall lind ourselves in the presence of such fa- 
cilities for confusion that the like has not been seen since the tower of 
Babel. 

What will become of the army, this new invcnti<m being successful? 
All will have to be done over again; the fortifications, the mano'uvers, 
the defenses of the frontiers, strategy, all is brought to naught. It 
will even cause, in a very short time, the sup])ression of uationalities: 
races wdl be rapidly commingled or destroyed, for there will no longer 
be efficient barriers, not even those movable barriers which we term 
armies. No more frontiers ! No more insular seclnsi(Ui ! No more for- 
tresses! Whither are we drifting? 

It nuist be confessed that we are face to face with the great unknoAvn. 
What will be the result ? Will society perish? Assuredly uo! 

As to the lu'ocedure that society will adopt to conform to this new 
uu)de of existence I have not the least idea, but it may be affirmed 
that society will emerge victorious from the struggle; that after the 
tempest caus(Hl by injured interests a period of restored equilibrium 
willfollow: and that in theend at the cost of a time of distress, humanity 
will enter into [)ossession of theem])ire of the air. 



THE EMPIRE OF THE AIR. 463

riiOGRESS Ol' AXTIIKOPOLOGV IX 1802. 



By I'loC. Oris T. Mason. 



Anthropology has busied itself with the multiplication of societies, 
journals, congi-esses and other means of co-0])erative work. The bene- 
fit of this is seen in many ways; it prevents dn])lication; it puts ma- 
terial where it should be looked for; but, chief of all, it enables men to 
undertake enterprises that are entirely beyond the capacity and the 
resources of indi\iduals. The increasing favor of the science is 
observed in the fact that most of the leading governments have at 
great expense organized explorations and studies. '■■ The year 1892," 
said Prof. Macalistei- before Section H of the British Association, "has 
not be<'n futile in discoveries bearing on those great questions that are 
of i)L>pular interest." Indeed, there has been a growth of wholesome 
doubt on questions concerning which men's minds were thought to be 
settlcfl. This will be seeu most apparent in the arclueological area, 
es])ecially in America. The (examination of ancient corner stones and 
foundations, the clearing away of emMimbering materials, are i)repara- 
toiy t!> the strengthening of the sti'ucture at every i)oint. 

Tlie American Association for the Advancement of Science was held 
in Korhester, X. V. As usual, the science of authrointlogy received 
a larger aiuouut of attention, even outside section II. This fact is 
noticeable espei-ially in the large number of papers devoted to domes- 
ticated animals and ])lants.

The strong' point for anthropolo<j;y in the British Association is its 
eminent committees, which have guided exploration in many directions. 
In the French Association for the Advancement of Science, held at Pan 
under the presidency of Dr. Magitot, September 15-21, the following 
papers on the program are of interest to anthropologists in general: 

Affinities between the Basque language and certain idioms of tlie two continents^ 
Gharency, Vinson, Manouvrier, Azema, Guillibeau, Guido Cora, and Dodgson; Let 
Tziganes; Guido Cora; archseology of the Pyrenees, Cartailhac; depopulation ot 
France, Chervin; prehistoric finds in the valley of the V6z^re, Girod et Massorrat; 
anthropology and the arclueology of the Pyrenees, a discussion, proposed by M. 
Pictte; Le Tonkin, Barbier. The question of the Basques, their anthropological 
characters, their history, their language, their traditions, and folklore consumed the 
bulk of the time, 

Tlie tweiity-third annual session of the German Anthropological 
Society was held in Ulm, August l-'A, The following important mat- 
ters were discussed : 

Ein Bild aus Schwal)ens Vorzeit, E. von Troltsch.

Die Menschenrassen Enroi)as nnd die Frage nach der Herknnft der Arier, J. 
Kollmann, 

Anthropologisches aus Malacca, R. Virchow. 

The German Anthropological Society devotes all its time to this one 
subject. In their national (jcmgress of naturalists and j^hysicians, topics 
relating to inau are also discussed by German Anthropologists. 

At the eleventli session of the congres internationaux d'arch^ologie 
prehistorique et d'anthropologie, convened at Moscow, the following 
papers were read ;

Tlie lirst named uiidei' the eliairniaiisliii) oT Vircliow, reported at the 
meeting, as follows :

II. (ircal diametcrx. — The niaxiiimiu ]eii_i;tli ami llie iiiaximmii li-,iiis\ ere width 
according to the French method are adopted to tlie exclusion of otiier anahtnous 
diameters. Whenever these last are employed they nnist lie announced. 

III. FroniaJ diameters. — To the mininuim frontal widlli, adopted only in (iermany, 
is added the maxininni width, \vhi(di ought to he measured on tlie Stephanie ])oint, 
of Broca. 

IV. Total lieiylil of the sknil. — This measure siionld he [ire.sei\ ed, l>ut it ought to 
be taken or it will fall into disuse. 

The committee prefer for tlii.s puriiose the compass of N'irehow. W 
this iustrumeut is not adopted tlie h'gs of IJroea's sliding compass 
must be lengtliened. The utility of this modification is perceived in 
mensurations on the living. It is only with a coni])ass with long 
branches that the total height of the skull can be tak(Mi tlirough the 
auricular x)oints. 

V. The curves. — The curves must he taken with a steel metric ribbon. The hor- 
izontal should pass around tlie suj)raciliary arches and the nujst salient ]>()ints. 
The transverse by the auditory openings and the bregma. 

A'l. The face. — The width ouglir to lie taken no longer on the jugoinaxillary sutures, 
but upon the two points that givi^ tlie uuxximum width. The height of the nasion 
ought to be taken at the upjier alveol.ir ]»oint. The total height of the nasiou ou 
the mentoual jioints. 

VII. Tlie orbits. — The diameters of the orbits ought to be measured on Die internal 
borders. For the width tlie dacrion should be abandoned. 

VIII. The ophrio-Tiaso-ah eolar angle ought to betaken with tlie facial goniouH'ter 
of Kanke or with that of Hroca. In this, as iu all measures, tlie instruments ami the 
methods should be stat(^d. 

In his paper before the tenth congress of archteology and anthro- 
pology, Ernest Chantre made a report on the measurements of the 
peoples of the Caucasus, of which the following is the abstract: 

(1) Armenians, brown, brachycejthalous, luesoprosopic, leptoiriiiin-, and above the 
medium in stature. 

(2) Aderbeijanis, l)ro\vn. do]ichocc]di.ilous, doli(dio))rosoi)ie. h'litorrhimv and above 
the medium stature. 

(3) Kurds, generally brown, with elongated faces, eyes never l)ridged. doiielio- 
cephalons, ]eptorrhiin% and al)Ove the medium stature.

470 PROGRi:SS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1892. 

This is by far the most important assembhige of aiitliiopologists iu 
Euro])e. Through their increasingly closer co-operation it is hoped to 
unify methods of research that reports from one c«mntry may be taken 
np and utilize<l in another. This in some lines has been hitherto im- 
practicable. 

At the Australian Association for the Advancement of Science, held 
January 7 to 14, the ])resident of the section of anthropology was the 
liev. Lorimer Fison. The following is a list of subjects and nnthors : 

T]ie story of Ti*; aiul Rie, H«rvey Is., Dr. Gill. . 

The oineiis of preguaiicy, Maugaia, Dr. Gill. 

New Britain and its i)eople, R. Danks.

At the eighth annual meeting of the Indiana .Vcademj^ of Science, 
held in Indiamipolis, December 1*8 and 20, the following pai)ers of 
anthropologic interest were read :

Remarks on arclueological map making, by A. W. Butler. 

The preparation for the World's Oolumbian Exposition occupied the 
time of most of the American anthropologists in 1892. A classitication 
of the material was first made upon a purely anthropological basis, 
and in its completed form nnide full i)rovision in Department 31 for 
this subject under the topics: Ethnology, Arclueology, Progress of 
Labor and Invention. 

The exhibit was bound by the law creating the Exposition to be 
double — the Government i)ortion and the Exposition portion or depart- 
ment. 

In order to avoid all contlicts it was arranged that the first-named 
display should set forth the resources and methods of the Government 
in the prosecution of antliropological work. The com])letion of the 
great linguistic map furnished the key-note, and all the national ex- 
liibits were set up around the ideas there set forth. 

The area covered by the Department M was of a much wider scope. 
Somatic and functional anthropology were to have the widest range, 
and tribes of living peoples were to encamp on the grounds to give em- 
phasis to the exhibits. A separate building^ was provided for, in which

tliorized a rei)resentatioii in tlie Exposition of ^Fadrid to connneniortite 
the quadrocentciiiidal of the discovery of America. The vaiious De- 
partiiuMits aiul tlie National Museum were authorized to participate. 
In addition to this Government disi)lay, the Hemenway Expedition, tlu^ 
Peabody Museum, the ITniveisity of J'ennsylvania, the Academy of 
Natural Sciences of Phila<lel])hia took part in the exliibits from the 
United States. The South American republics were \xvU represented, 
as well as Mexico aixl ('entral America. The Exposition, lasting six 
months, was held in the new museum itnd library building in >radiid. 
It afforded the rarest ()i)i)ortunity of bringing together a great variety 
of art x>i"oducts from the two Americas. 



472 PROC4RE8S OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1892. 

A great deal of the material mounted in Wasliiugton for tlie World's 
Fair in Chicago was exhibited in Madrid, adding to tlie interest of the 
exhibit. The catalogne was prepared by Mr. Walter Hough, of the 
TJ. S. National Museum, and an account given by the same author in 
the American Anthrajwlogist for July, 1893, 271-277. 

Dr. Brinton assumed control of the current notes on anthropology 
in Science (New York), enabling the reader to profit at small ex])euse 
by a vast amount of research, especially into European literature inac- 
cessible to most. The method pursued is to devote short paragraphs 
to the comprehensive statement of the author's aim and a short analy- 
sis of the work. 

An extensive catalogue of anthropological literature is to be found 
in each volume of Archiv fiir Anthropologie, classified as follows: 

I. Prc-liistory and Arcliaeology : i. Germany; li. Austria; iii. Switzerland; iv. 
Great Britain; v. Denmark: vi. Sweden; vii. Norway; viii. France; ix. Belgium; 
X. Italy; xi. America. 

II. Anatomy: i. 1888; it. 1889; iii. 1890. 

III. Volkerkunde (1890): i. Sources; ii. Ethnology (1. Methods, liistory of the 
science; 2. General anthropology; 8. Inttuence of climate and environment; 4. 
General sociology ; .5. Special sociology). 

III. Ethnography: i. General ethnography ; ii. Special etlimigrajihy (A. Europe, 
with 15 subdivisions; B. Asia, "with 13 divisions, each with several subdivisions; C. 
Australia, Avith 1 divisions ; D. Africa, with 9 division8;E. .\merica, with 4 divisions). 

IV. Zoology: Account of zoological literature in connection with anthropology 
for the year 1890. (A. Mannnals and human remains from the diluvium and i)re- 
historic times; B. Mammals from the diluvium, with no near association with 
man; C. Mammals from the Tertiary and Mesozoic times; I). Recent mammals, both 
systematic study and distribution. ) 

There are many things to be said in favor of the classified bibliogra- 
phy, but the tendency nowadays is to a single alphabet. The title col- 
lection of the Archiv is excellently done, and frequently a brief review 
accompanies of great value. The only drawback to the handy use of 
such a biT)liography is the impracticability of carrying so long an 
analysis in the memory. The list is especially full by reason of its in- 
cluding only works that are two years behind the date of tlie Archiv. 

1. BIOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY. 

Dr. Friedrich Ratzel's Anthropogeographie at the close of 1891 
reached tlie end of its second volume. In the first volume the 
physiograpliical and the climatological differences were discussed as 
conditioning the varied forms of settlement and civilization and the 
endless varieties of mankind. 

The second volume is devoted to bio-geography, including a graphic 
picture of human distribution, a sketch of the peopling of the earth as 
a whole {the wlumcne of the Greeks) and the effect of position in this 
wlitmcne. In the second part of this volume some important matters 
are taken up, namely, the significance of the density and the distri- 
bution of poj^ulations, the want of progress in some peoples, their ex-

bnt with the new lijiht of modern science the books of (Vnyot and 
Ritter and Marsh may be re-written. Tlie anthor of this series has 
qnalilietl himself for this task by a series of lectnres, the repetition of 
which has made him (juite familiar with all phases of the snbject. 

Anihropometnj. — ])r. K. Collii;non, of Cherbouri;-, Fran<;e, issued a 
Projet d'Entente Internationale pour arreter un Programme Commnu 
de Eecherclies Antliropolog'iques. The object of this projet is to bring 
about uniformity everywhere in the matter of bodily measurements, 
fu reading up the action of the several national associations and inter- 
national congresses the reader will see that the old struggle for agree- 
ment concerning common measures and method goes on. The convic- 
tion is continually strengtiiened that no goo<l results can precede such 
agreement. 

M. Etienne Ilollct ]>nl)lished in Revue tScientifique in August (vol. 
50, p. 170-17.")) a tabhi of coethcients for deducing stature from the 
measurement of the long bones.

Multiply the lengtli of the long bone named by the coefficient in the 
table to obtain the stature. The worth of the i)ublication is greatly 
enhanced by a nniltitude of references to authorities. 

In his work entitled L' Homme dans la Nature (Paris, 1801, JJalliere), 
Paul Topinard makes the following resume of his studies:

In comiiaring woman's brain with man's, Prof, (Jrichton IJrowne con- 
firms the inferiority of the former, amounting to thirty grammes, cor- 
rection made of the coetlicient of stature, lie has pro\-ed that the 
frontal lobes are not so well irrigated by the blood, and that, on the 
contrary, the circulation of blood is more active in the posterior and 
superior iiortions. The ])osterior ])arts of the eiu'ephalon, cervelet, and 
occijntal lobes are more develojied in women, and that their left brain 
weighs less than their right brain. Tlie convolutions are less compli- 
cated than in men. The caliber of the internal and the vertebral car- 
otid present marked differences in the two sexes. Whence it results 
that the (listril)ution of blood m the brains of the two sexes differ

groatly. The internal curoted with its piincipal braiiclies (cerebral, 
anterior, and intermediate), Avhich are distributed among- the suborbital 
convolutions of the insula, of the Rolandic region, and of the first sphe- 
noidal convolutions, are larger, absolutely and relatively, in men than 
in women. On the contrary, the vertebral carotid, which is distributed 
among the occipital and temporo-sphenoidal lobes, are larger in women 
than in men, and the basilar trunk, which is only a continuation of the 
vertebral, is also larger, its mean diameter being 28"-'" in woman and 
2(jtuiii i^ man. •• 

II. PSYCHOLOGY. 

Prof. Ward, in his vice-presidential address before Section I of the 
American Association, says that tlie (loctrines of physiocracy laissez 
/aire and Spencerian individualism and the biologic economy gener- 
ally are not sustained, and that the facts which society presents are 
for the most part the reverse of those which were promised by them. 
The exi)lanation is that the old political economy is true only of irra- 
tional animals and is altogether inapplicable to rational nmn. Darwin 
modestly confesses that he derived his original conceptions of natural 
selection from the reading of Malthus on Population. But he did not, 
perhaps, perceive that in applying the law of Malthus to the animal 
world he was introducing it into the only field in which it holds true. 
Yet such is the ease, and for the reason that the advent with man of 
the thinking, knowing, foreseeing, calculating, designing, inventing, 
and constructing faculty, which is wanting in lower creatures, repealed 
the biologic law or law of nature and enacted in its stead the phycho- 
logic law, the law of mind. 

In the American Journal of Psychology (1892, IV, 491-502) communi- 
cations are made to the editor of courses in experimental psychology 
as follows: In London the present examiners in mental science are 
Dr. James Sully and Prof. Knight. In University College (Gower 
street) Prof. Croom Robertson conducts the instruction. King's Col- 
lege, Bedford College, and the City of London College affiliated with 
the University provide teaching in psychology. But there is no labora- 
tory in any of them for experimental psychology and research, indeed 
the only one in England is at the University of Cambridge. 

In Copenhagen there is at the university a psychological labora- 
tory under the direction of Dr. Lehman. The instruction in philoso- 
phy is under the direction of Prof. Harold Hoffding. 

In 1891, a chair of experimental psychology was created in the 
faculty of sciences of the University of Ceneva, but without a labo- 
ratory, Wladimir v. Tschisch presents a brief rejtort on the clinic for 
nervous and mental diseases in Dorpat. 

Yale University has provided a course of study in ex})erimental phil- 
osophy with reference to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. 

Three courses of psychological instruction were pursued in Harvard.

Prof. E. W. Scripture proposes in the psychological notes of the 
American Journal of P.sychology (IV, 581) a list of terms with dctini- 
tions for psychological use, according to the meanings attached to 
them: 

(1) Feelings are the indivisflde elements into which mental jilienom- 
ena are composed. Every fact of consciousness that has not been 
proved to be a combination of other facts is to be called a feeling. 

(2) Sensations are those feelings which are regarded as coming from 
without; they are passively experienced feelings. 

(o) Impulses are those feelings that are regarded as originated in the 
mind its(*lf: they are actively experienced feelings. 

(4) Ideas are comi)ounds of feelings of any kind. 

(5) Percepts are those ideas that are composed mainly of sensations. 
(G) Volitions are those ideas that are composed mainly of imi)ulses.

jiersonalities; amnesia the barrier which separates successive person 
alities. 'En iin mot, il peut y avoir chez uii menu individu, ])luralite

Ill La Revue t^clentifique (xlix, 797) M, Lacassagne, director of tlie 
faculty of medicine in Lyon, publishes a questionnaire on physiological 
psychology. The object is to stimulate statistical researches on the 
relations between the sensorial apparatus, the quality of memory, and 
the mode of functioning of the centers of language and of ideation. 
Mm. H. Beaunis and A. Binet follow up tins subject in the succeeding 
volume (L, 340-343) with a questionnaire addressctl to painters, sculp- 
tors, and designers relative to a visual memory of coh)r and form, the 
chief points of the inquiry l)eing the distinctness of visual recollec- 
tions, the qualities of visual memory, distinction between form ineniory 
and color memory, fidelity of this characteristic, the role of visual mem- 
ory in the art of design, peculiarities. Dr. Riccardi's ^AHfhrojmJofiia e 
Pedagogia is a study in the science of education founded on a basis of 
experimental psychology and anthropology. He has collected during 
the last seven or eight years, with the lielp of teachers, some hundred 
thousand observations on two thousand children of Modena and Bologna, 
and in this first part of the work he presents the data concerning this 
psychological and sociological condition. He divides the pupils into 
good, middling, and bad, and investigates the characters of these 
classes with reference to family life, number in a family, healthiness of 
the family stock, social position, etc., in each case first taking the sexes 
together and then considering boys and girls separately. Italian child- 
ren, to a large extent, live under bad conditions and are decidedly 
below the anthropometric standards of other nations. There is a 
marked contrast between the children of the jjoor and of the well-to- 
do classes, to the advantage of the latter. [Rev. in J. Anthrop. Inst.,

III. ETHNOLOGY. 

Prof. Alexander Macalister, in his vice-presidential address before 
Section H of the Britisli Association, regrets that there is not in our 
literature a more definite nomenclature for the divisions of mankind, 
and that sucli words as race, i)eople, nationality, tribe, type, stock, and 
family are often used indiscriminately as though they were synonyms. 
There are several collateral series of facts, the terminologies of which 
should be discriminated: (1) Etluuc conditions whereby individuals of 
mankind are grouped into categories of different comprehension, as 
clans or families, as tribes or groups of allied clans, and as nations, the 
inhabitants of restricted areas under one i)olitical organization — Eth- 
nology. (2) Individuals regarded as descendants of a limited num- 
ber of original parents, each person having his place on the genea- 
logical tree of humanity. As the successive branches were subjected 
to diverse environments, they have differentiated in characteristics. 
To each of these subdivisions, is applied the name of Eace. [Haeckel 
terms this study anthropogony.j (3) The third category is that of lan- 
guage, sometimes conterminous, but it is as absurd to speak of an Aryan 
skull as of a brachycephalic language. — Nature, London, 1892, August 
18, p. 379. 

The British Association appointed a committee to organize an eth- 
nographical survey of the United Kingdom. The committee, in pur- 
suance of the object for which they had been delegated by the Society 
of Antiquaries of London, the Folk-lore Society and the Anthropolog- 
ical Institute, and appointed by the British Association, propose to 
record for certain typical villages and the neighboring districts, (1) 
Physical types of the inhabitants; (2) current traditions and beliefs; 
(3) peculiarities of dialect; (4) monuments and other remains of an- 
cient culture; (5) historical evidence as to continuity of race.

The origin of the ]\[anchu race, to which the reigning dynasty in 
China beh)ngs (see yature, London, 1802, XLV, 523, quoting from North 
China Herald, Shanghai), is thus set forth: 

Tlie Tiiiigiis tribes, to wliicli tlie Maiiclm bcldiiji;, are scattered about, in Siberia 
and Mancliniia in rather small coniniuuities. They appear in history in the Chow 
dynasty. The Mongols as a race are probably an oti'shoot from Tnngns stock. The 
consanguinity that exists between Manchn and Mongol is greater than that which is 
found to i)rcvail between Mongol and Turk, and therefore it nniy be concluded that 
the Tungus, either in Siberia or in Manchuria or on the Amur, threw otf a branch 
which b(H'auii' Mongol. Genghis Khan and his tribe started on their conquest of the 
Asiatic continent from the neighborhood of the gold mines in Nuchinsk, and the 
Mongols are not tishermen by preference nor hunters of the sable, martin, and beaver. 
They are rather keepers of sheep and riders of horses and camels. Tliey might 
easily develop their language in the vicinity of the Altai mountains and the Baikal. 

As to the Manchus, they have forgotten their early occupation since coming to 
China, and they attend iu)W onlj^ to the duties of the public service or to military 
training. The language like the Mongol is rich with the spoils of autiiinity. All the 
various forms of culture, whether belonging to Shamanism, Confucianism, or P.uddhism, 
with which they have become successively familiar, have contributed a share. To 
these must be added the vocabulai-y of the huntsman, the hshermau, and the shep- 
licrd, and all the terms necessary to feudal relationship as well as those of the trades 
and occupations of the old civilization. 

EthnoUMi}! of Mahyreh. — Dr. Brinton proposed to adopt the Arab 
name, Mahgreb, for that iiortion of Africa west of the Nile Valley and 
nortli of the soutiiern boundary of the Saliara. l^'roni time immemorial 
it has been the home of the Berber, or Mamitic, or Protosemitic i)eoples. 
(For the i)rehistory of this region consult A. Chatelin, in Rouie Scien- 
tific, April 9, 1802.) Pala'olitliic man is said to have been here, suc- 
ceeded by neolithic communirics and megalithic structures, erected 
by ancestors of the Berbers. The same Berber stock has possessed 
^Nlahgreb from the very earliest times to the present day.

IV. GLOSSOLOGY. 

The Seventh Annual Eeport of the Bureau of Ethnology to tlie Smith- 
sonian Institution by J. W. Powell, director, bears the imprint of 1891, 
but was really made ])ublic in 1892. This is in one sense a jubilee 
volume, the crowning glory of American linguistics, commenced sys- 
tematically by (lalhitiu and ended by Powell. 

The names of American Indian tribes have been in very great con- 
fusion, each tribe having many names. This confusion, as for example 
with the Mohawks, arose by having the spelling in three languages, by 
having their own real name confounded with terms of reproach gathered 
from neighboring tribes, by imperfect and contlicting systems of translit 
eration. But in combining the North American tribes into one system 
rules were necessary, therefore Maj. Powell laid down the following: 

I. Tbe law of priority relating to tbe iiomeutdature of tlie systematic pbilology ot 
tbe Nortb American tribes sball not extend to antliors wbose 'works ai'e of date 
anterior to tbe year 188(5. 

II. Tbe name originally given by tbe founder of a linguistic group to designate it 
as a family or stock of languages sball be permaueutly retained to tbe exclusion of 
all otbers. 

III. No family name sball be recognized if composed of more tban one word. 

IV. A familj^ name once establisbed sball not bo canceled in any subsequent divi- 
sion of tbe grou]>, but sball be retained, in a restricted sense, for one of its constituent 
])()rti()ns. 

V. Family names sliiill 1ic distiuguisbcd ;is sucb by tbt; terminations "an"' and 
"ian." 

VI. \o n;ime sball be accepted for a linguistic i'iimily unless used to tlesignate a 
tribe or group of tribes as a linguistic stock. 



PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IX 18it2. 481 

VII. Xo family name shall be accopted luilfss there isnivcutlu- liabitat of tribe 
or tril)es to wliich it is applied. 

YIII. The original ortho.ijraphv oi'a name sliall be rigidly jiroserved except as 
provided for in Rule iii, and unless a typogra])hi<'al error is evident. 

As tixt'tl in Powell's lust revision tlie families stand thus: Algon- 
quian (Eastern North America); Athapascan (iSTorth west North Amer- 
ica): Attacapan (Louisiana); Beothukan (Nova Scotia); Cadchian (Three 
groups, northern, Arikara, middle, Pawnee; southern, (Jaddo); Chi- 
mukuau (Puget Soiiud); Chimarikan (Trinity Jliver, California); Chim- 
mesyan (British Columbia); Chinookan (Columbia Piver); Cliitimachan

(Missouri River); Skittagetan (Queen Charlotte Islands): Takilman 
(Rogue River); Tanoan (Rio Grande River); Tinuupianan (Florida); 
Tonikan (Red River, Arkansas) ; Tonkawan (Texas) ; Uchean (Georgia) ; 
Waiilatpuan (Wallawalla River): Wakashan (Vancouver Island); 
Washoan (Carson A'^alley, California); Weitspekan (Klamath River); 
Wislioskan (Eel River, Oregon); Yakonan (TJmpqua River, California); 
Yanan ^Pitt River, California); Ynkian (Round Valley, California); 
Yuman ((N)lorado lliver, Caliibrnia); Zufiian (New Mexico). 

Finm. — Dr. Theodor Kojjpen (Arcliir f. Anthrop., xx) defends 
the unity of the Finnic and the Aryan linguistic stock, alleging the an- 
cestral home to have been on the miihlle \'olga. Tin: scjiaiation into 
eastern and western branches took place on the river Don, at whicii 
time also arose the Aryan and the Ugro-I'Mnnic division. 

The ])ublication of Middcndorf's sixth volume on the Peruvian lan- 
guages completes a most valuable series. The languages considered 
are the Kechua, the Aymara, and the Cliimu (Muchik or Vunca), with 
an appendix on the Chibcha. The work was issue<l by Brockhaus, 
Lcii)zig. (Printon, Science, xx, G.) 

In Philadelphia has been established the de Laincel fund for the 
study of the graphic system of the jvncient Mayas, by collecting vocab- 
ularies of the language and its dialects and ]ihotograi)hs of the ruins 
and inscriptions and inanuscripts. ])r. H. T. Cresson haschargeof the

V. TECHNOLOGY, 

A remarkable contribution to the natural history of aesthetics, which 
the author of this summary has elsewhere called a'sthetology, is the 
address of William H. Holmes, as vice president, before Section H of 
the American Association. The science of the beautiful was exam- 
ined in order to study the x>benomena of the beautiful as the botanist 
studies the real llowers of the field. 

"The science of the beautiful nuist deal with actual ])henomena; 
witli facts as hard, with principles as fixed, and laws as inflexible, as 
do the sciences of bioloiiy and physics." 

The author takes up the subject from the phenomenal side and 
ignores the x>iii"tdy metaphysical element altogether, which is alleged 
to have woven about it a dense and very subtle web of transcendental 
fancy! 

The author's appreciation of the amount of tiine and energy given 
to this field of human activity is charming. "We totally fail to real- 
ize how much time and thought are given to aesthetic considerations, 
and what a large place they really fill in tlie thoughts and activities of 
the world. This would come home to us if by some sudden change in 
the constitution of things all that is aesthetic should be rudely torn 
from us and banished from the world. - - - To make this clear, 
let us suppose that some dire disease should destroy our perception of 
the beautiful, a world of useless things would encumber our existence. 
The fine arts would fall into disuse. Painting, sculpture, architecture, 
poetry, music, romance, the drama, and landscape gardening would dis- 
a])pear utterly. No picture would grace the wall of gallery or dwelling. 
Temples and halls would be without statuary and books without illustra- 
tions. Architecture would degenerate into the merest house building, 
without projections, moldings, carving, painting, frescoes, hangings, 
or carpeting. Churches would be but the 2)lainest barns without arch- 
ways or columns, or steeples, or towers, or stained glass ; the organ and 
the choir and the singing of hymns as though they had never been. 
All artists, sculptors, architects, poets, authors, composers, and drama- 
tists, and all the multitude that depend upon them, decorators, engrav- 
ers, carvers, musicians, actors, book-makers, manufacturers of all that 
pertainsto the polite arts, and all merhants who deal in aesthetic things 
would turn to other callings. The ships and railways that transport the 
products of a'sthetic industry, silks and rugs, and laces, and orna- 
mental goods, and furniture, and tiles, and paints, and dyes, and porce- 
lains, and brasses, would cease to plow the sea and girdle the land. The 
range of human livelihood would be reduced to a dangerous degree, 
and existence — a burden without art, would be overwhelmed with poverty 
and distress. Now, there was a time when this jiicture was a true 
one, and men had no great results in aesthetic art to show. From then 
to our day, Mr. Holmes declares to be a question of evolution. 



PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1892. 483 

By passing;" u]) through the scale of culture stajies fioni savai^ery to 
cnlijihtenmeut, we see that each succeeding period has a larger share 
of art aud a correspondingly larger share of the lesthetic, each stage 
being prophetic of the succeeding stage. The last stage, that upon 
which the nations of the world are now entering — the eidigliteiu'd — 
is also necessarily prophetic of a still more advanced stagehand by 
adding to the number of aesthetic groups those yet to be conceived 
and prolonging the exi)anding lines of each grou[) indetinitely, we are 
led to comprehend the true relations of the present to the marvellous 
future, and to form some notion of the magnificent sum total of the 
iesthetic that future generations will be jtrivileged to enjoy. 

VT. ARCHAEOLOGY. 

In the Frocecdingfi of the Royal Geographical iSocicty (Lond., 1892, 
XIV, 273-309) and in other journals will be found an account of the 
marvellous ruins of ]Mashonadand, in the water-shed of South Africa, 
between 18° and 2(P south, by Theodore Bent, the explorer. There 
are many ruins on the Limi)opo and elsewhere in this area, but the 
author confines himself to those on the Great Zimbabwe, situated 20° 
IG' South, aud 31° 10' East. They cover a vast area and consist of a 
large circular building with a network of smaller buihlings extending 
in the valley below, and a labyrinthine fortress on the hill, about 100 
feet above, naturally protected by huge granite bowlders, and by a 
precipice running round a considerable portion of it. The lower build- 
ing is constructed of small blo(;ks of granite broken with the hammer 
into uniform size and laid up without mortar. The encircling wall is 
30 feet high in parts and 10 to 17 feet thick. Tiiere is a long narrow 
passage between walls (;oudncting to what Mr. Bent calls "the sacred 
inclosure'' in which are standing two towers, one of them 32 feet high, 
a wonderful structure of perfect symmetry, and with courses of un- 
varying regidarity. 

The ]>iincipal ]>art of ]VIr. Bent's work and his most interesting dis- 
coveries took place on the hill fortress, the labyriidliine nature of which 
is explained in the ])lans. The approach is protected at every turn 
Avith traverses and and)uscades, and tlieu commences at the bottom of 
the precipice a fiight of stei)s leading up. In fact, the redundancy of 
fortification all over this mountain, the useless repetition of walls over 
a ])recii)ice itself inaccessible, the care with which every hole in the 
bowlders through whi(;h an arrow could pass is closed, prove that the 
occupants were in constant dread of attack. I'ottery aud iron objects 
occurred in abundance, but the most interesting find was connected 
with the manufacture of gold, crucibles, broken quartz, and furnaces. 

These ruins are in no wdy connected with the African race. They 
formed a garrison for gold workers in anti(]uity, who (;ame, doubtless 
from the Arabian peninsula, in the pre-Mohammedaji period. 

One of the results of the Congress of Arclneological Societies, in 



484 PKOGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1892. 

union with the London Society of Antiquaries, is the issue of an index 
of arch .geological papers, published in 1891. There is a list of 45 
societies and Journals in all, and 33 pages of titles, succeeded by an 
alphabetic list of places, subjects, authors, and societies with their 
publications. The secretary of this congress of societies is W. H. St. 
John Hope, Burleigh House, London. 

M. A. C. Chatelier contributes to La Bevue Scientifiqiie (xlix, 457- 
401) a resume of i)rehistoric studies in North Africa. To the work of 
codification is added a bibliography of 70 titles upon the same subject. 

M. Zabarowski calls attention to the doubtful antiquity of the Can- 
stadt skull. It was discovered in 1700, but, according to Dr. llerve it 
was really seen first in the vitrine of the museum of Stuttgard a hun- 
dred years after the digging from which it is supposed to have come. 
Dr. Brinton also reverts to the same question in Science. Indeed, the 
year 1892 marks an epoch of decline in the belief that man has had an 
exceedingly high auti(iuity in Europe or America. The result of such 
questionings will be a review of the grounds of belief, with a strength- 
ening of the foundations of knowledge. 

The article of Louis Theureau, in La Bevue SelenUfique (l, 304-369) 
on alimentation in India, calls especial attention to the fact that it has 
been from time imuiemorial a country whose food was essentially vege- 
tal, under the influence of an idea on which is fouuded a philosophic 
and religious system, belief in metempsychosis or migration of the 
soul. About fifty titles bearing on the subject aiT quoted, adding great 
value to the article. 

An epoch-making investigation for archaeolgoists was that of William 
H. Holmes upon ancient (juarries in the United States. The result of 
the first investigation into the quarry site on Piuey Branch near Wash- 
ington, is givenin t\\ii American Anthropologist, (iii, 1-26). Dr. Brinton 
calls attention sliarply to this work in a short paragraph on 'quarry 
subjects,' in Science (November 4, 1892). Since then a controversy, 
characterized by no little acrimony, sprang up between what might be 
termed the old school and the new school on this subject. Two distinct 
questions are involved in the controversy, namely, whether the objects 
are palaeolithic implements or the rejected pieces of the aboriginal 
quarryman; and, secondly, whether they are geologically situated to 
denote very great antiquity. 

The trustees of the British Museum printed an album containing 
autotype facsimiles of the Telel-Amarna tablets. A review of this work 
will be found in liature, vol. xlvi, pages 49-52. During the sum- 
mer of 1887 a woman belonging to the household of one of the ''an- 
tica" dealers, who live at or near Tel-el-Aniarna in Upper Egypt, 
set out to follow her usual avocation of digging in the sand and loose 
earth at the foot of the hills for small antiquities. The exact details of 
her search will never be known, but it is certain that in a small cham- 
|)er at no great depth below the surface she found a number of clay

tablets, the like of wliicli luid never l)otor(' been du.ii' up in F.gyi>t. 
There were over three luiudred of them, of which mimber the British 
Museum secured .S2, the Gizeli Museum 00, the Berlin Museum IGO. 
The Tel-el- Amarua tablets are uiii(iiie as an archa'ological -Mind," and 
they are also uni<iue as a means of weaving' together the tlireads of the 
histories of two or three of tlie .ureatest nations of anti<|nity at a crit- 
ical period. Tliey were ail written between the years 1. ")()() and U.")() 
li. C. Those in tlie Britisli ^Inseiim consist of a series of disi>atches 
written from Kinus of Babylonia, Alashiyah, Mitana, I'hcenieia, Syria, 
and Palestine to Ainenophis IIT, and to his son, Ameiiopliis IV. ^lany 
of them are also of a personal or private nature. 

Alfred P. Maudslay, who spent seven winters m Central America 
studying;" and ])hoto,u'raphino- the ancient ruins, announccMl the forth- 
coming' of a work on this subject, the g'ist of which is given in Xatmr 
of Aj)rill!!K A ina]) on page (>1S lays down graphically the limits of 
^[aya inscriptions. 

The orientation of buildings is considered by Dr. Briuton in tSciencr 
(XX, (!), and the ori<'ntation of the sides as in Egypt brought into con- 
trast with that of the corners as in Mesopotamia and Ziini. >\t Zim- 
babwe a series of ornaments on the walls of the great temi»le are so 
disposed that one group will receive directly the sun's rays at his 
rising and another at his setting at the period of the winter solstice, 
when these points in that latitude were respectively 1*5'^ south of east 
and west, while a third series of ornaments faced the full midday sun. 

Prof. W. (). Atwater, in the Fonim for June, discusses the scientific 
study of food as one of the most important problems in anthropology. 
At present the poorer classes the world ovei- are scantily nourished 
and the majority of mankind live on a low nutritive plane. The com- 
ing man will not buy as expeiisi\'e foods l>ecause sonui of the least 
expensive are most nutritive and ]>alatable. lie will \ alue foods for 
their nutritive (pialities. Much less food of the ])roi)er (pialitN' will be 
reipiired to keep a man in his best estate. There will be a revolution 
in cooking, which is both wasteful and primitive. 

Payne's History of the New World called America is a^ i)hilos(»]»hical 
treatment of a historical subject. It is a history of America written 
by a tiained anthropologist. In the author's own words, he has "under- 
taken the unusual couise of e\i)laining the facts under in\estigation 
by a theory of human advancement not (mly not genei-ally re(;ognized 
but not hitherto foiiiiaIl\ enunciated. Some ma\ liml it paradoxical, 
to assign to adxancemeiit no loftier origin than the organized [uovisiou 
of the food sui)ply on an artili<'ial as distinguished from a natural 
basis. The organization of food provision on the artificial ])asis has 
been combined with that of defense, and communities in which these 
combined organizations ha\e been fully elaborated have extended their 
boundaries at the exju'iise of others whoso social arrangements were 
less advanced." The author sets himself "to restore, if [)ossible, the 



486 PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1892. 

true features of the advanced communities of the New World, to 
analyse their social structure and economy, to measure by some definite 
standard the degree of progress they had attained, and to trace their 
history, so far as it can be recovered, distinguishing what can fairly 
be accepted as fact, from what can be shown with reasonable certainty 
to be fabulous." 

VIT. SIOCIOLOCIY. 

The Quarterly Journal o/"^J(*o«o?w/c.S', published for Harvard Univer- 
sity, in Boston, is valuable to the student not only for tlie papers and 
original investigations which it reports, but for its bibliography of 
economics. The titles are classified under (1) general works, theory, 
audits history; (2) production, exchange, and transportation; (3) social 
questions, labor, and capital (4) land; (5) population, emigration, and 
colonies; (0) international trade and customs tariffs; (7) finance and 
taxation; (8) banking, currency, credit, and prices; (9) legislation; (10) 
economic history and description; (11) statistics; (12) not classified. 

Native fairs in Alaska were reported to the ]SIumisinatic and Anti- 
quarian Society of Pliiladeli)hia by Lieut. Gorgas, U. S. Navy. Begin- 
ning at the south a fair is held in June at Port Clarence, just south of 
the narrowest part of the straits. It is numerously attended by 
Chukchis of Siberia, the natives of St. Lawrence Island, south of the 
straits, and by others from Cape Prince of Wales on the American 
mainland. The second fair is held at Hotham inlet, on the north shore 
of Kotzebue Sound. It lasts through July and August, and is attended 
by about 1,500 peoj)le, some Siberians, but mostly natives, especially 
from Point Ho])e, these being the principal traders of the coast. 

A third fair is at Point Lay, and a fourth at Camden Bay, not far 
from the mouth of Mackenzie Eiver. 

The trading boats make a regular round of these fairs, carrying 
articles in demaud from one to another; so that some from the far in- 
terior of Asia will in a few years be transported along the shores of 
the Arctic Sea and southerly indefinitely into the center of the conti- 
nent. (Brinton, I'^ciencCj xix., 287.) 

Galton's work on finger prints is thus briefiy reviewed in the Jour- 
nal of the Anthropological InMitute: 

The autlior considers the subject under the following divisious: (1) Introductory. 
(2) The previous employment of finger prints among various nations, which has 
been almost wholly confined to making daulis, without paying any regard to the 
delicate lineations with which this book alone is concerned. (3) Various methods 
of making good prints from the fingers are described at length, es])ecially those 
used at Mr. Galton's anthropometric laboratory at South Kensington. (4) The 
character and purpose of the ridges whose lineations appear in the finger print. 
(5) The various patterns formed by the lineations. (6) The question of persistence; 
whether the patterns are so durable as to afford a sure basis for identification. (7) 
An attempt to appraise the evidential value of finger prints by the law of probabil- 
ity. (8) The frequency with which various kinds of patterns appear on the differ-

(liistavo Ic Boil having' at'liniunl thai lii<;lioi' races can not impose 
tlieir civilization npoii lower races, undertakes, in an address before 
the (\niyTes international, institue par le (louvernement fran(;ais i)our 
Tetude des (piesti<nis coloniales {Rrv. ^S<■ie)lt., Paris, 1880, aout 24 and 
1892, Oct. 1) to show that to clnmne the civilization (»!' a ])eoi)le it is 
necessary to chan.ne their souls (anies). Centuries and not coiuniests 
cau accouiplish a task like that. The emx)iie of the world has always 
belouiied to the convinced, whose ."reat force consists in their slavery 
to an idea, and in their complete incapacity to retl<'ct and to reason. 
AVithout these, perhaps, no civilization would have, been born and 
humanity would not have arisen above barbarism. 

Lombroso and Ferrero discuss, in a work entitled "La Donna deliu- 
queiite,"' the subject of the criminality of women. To their view the 
crimes of men and those of women are two quite ditterent maladies, 
having' certain .symptoms in common but many more in which they 
differ widely. Women commit fewer crimes than men, all statistics 
are agreed on that. M. Guillat estimates the criminality oi' men to be 
six times greater than that of women and, according to (^uetelet and 
Tarde, the tendency to crime is five oi- six times more developed in 
men. 

Leaving out of view dift\?renco in legislation as to the sexes, M. Proal 
attributes the freedom of women to their greater religious spirit, their 
indoor life, the smaller number of employments wliich provoke to crime, 
like forgery and defalcation. Women go about less, and drink less, 
tlian men. 

From the evolutionist's standpoint, according to Fen( ro, the female 
has l)eeu less exposed to the struggle for existence. The sexual strug- 
gle does not exist for her at all and in higher civilization her degenera- 
tion produces crime in men. Ferrero sums up the causes of w^oman's 
smaller susceptibility to crime as follows: 

(1) Women are physically \V(;aker ami more timid. 

(2) Fee1)ler sexuality, strong maternity and ))ity. 

(3) The intelligence of woman is less.

pologisclie Gesellschaffc the subject of ancient commerce is discussed 
by G. Scliweinfurth and Merensky, the former dealing with the influ- 
ence of western Asia and India upon Egypt, the hitter Avith India as 
affecting- even the industries of Central Africa. 

The archteologists are also able to bring some noteworthy contribu- 
tions to this enquiry. In America certain types of basketry and pot- 
tery are known to have l)een lieculiar to certain linguistic stocks. But 
examples of these are found elsewhere in ever-decreasing numbers as 
they depart from this source. 

VIII. — EELIC+ION AND FOLK-LORE. 

On the 10th of April there was publicly opened in the Museum of 
Arch;eology of the University of Pennsylvania a loan collection of 
objects used in worship. It was divided into sections, that devoted to 
the religions of Egypt being in charge of Mrs. Cornelius Stevenson, 
that of India was arranged by Suamee Bhaskara Nand Saraswatee; 
that of China by Chinese scholars, and so on, each section being as- 
signed to some one specially fitted to the task.* 

The Ameri(;an Folk-lore Society was organized in I^ecember, 1892, 
for the ensuing year, as folloAvs: 

President, Horatio Hale. 

Vice Presidents, Alcec, Fortier and D. P. Penhallow. 

Council, Franz Boas, H. Carrington Bolton, D. G. Brinton, A. F. Chamberlain, J. 
Owen Dorsey, Alice C. Fletcher, George Bird Grinuell, Otis T. Mason, Frederick 
W. Putnam. 

Secretaries, W. W. Newell, J. Walter Fewkes. 

Treasurer, John H. Hinton. 

Curator, Stewart Culin. 

The organ of this society is the Journal of American Folk-lore, 
issued quarterly. In addition to the original papers and j^roceedings 
of the society and its branches contained in this journal, there is a 
resume of folk-lore throughout the world, and an extended bibli- 
ography, which is especially good in periodical literature. 

The fourth annual meeting of the American Folk-lore Society was 
held at the Thorndike Hotel, Boston, Mass., on December 28, and at 
the Peabody Museum of American Ethnology and Archeology, Cam- 
bridge, Mass., on December 29, Prof. Edward S. Morse presiding. The 
following papers were read : 

Two Biloxi tales, J. Owen Dorsey. 

Relation of the tales of I^ncle Remns to the animal stories of other countries, 
Adolph Gerber. 
Survival of fire sacrifice among the Indians of Maine, Miss A. L. Alger. 
Folklore of the Azorian Colonies, H. R. Lang. 
A modern oracle and its prototypes, H. Carrington Bolton. 
Tales of the Abeuakis, A. R. Tisdale. 
Chippewa tale of the end of Hiawatha, H. H. Kidder. 
Pawnee mythology, G. B. Grinnell.

The perinaueut results of the Folk-lore Oongiess held in London in 
1891 are given to the public in a vohune of 41 '2 i>ages, entitled "Pajters 
and Transactions/' The material is arranged under the four sections called 
Folk-Tale; Mythology; Custom and Institution; (xeneral Theory and 
Classitication. The i)resident of the congress, Mr. Andrew Lang, and 
the vice presidents of th<' sections delivered addresses, and papers of 
great merit were read. The most important discussion was that con- 
cerning the independent origin of folk incidents. Tinder the title 
"Bible(>theque de Carabas," David Xutt has issued seven volumes 
wiuch are of especial delight to folk-lorists, to wit: Cupid and 
Psyche, by William Adliugton; Euterpe, the Second Book of Herodotus, 
Englished by B. K., 1581; The Fables of Bidpai, or the iMorall Philoso- 
phie of Doni, Englished out of Italian by Thomas North, 1570, now 
edited by Joseph Jacobs; The Fables o: Esopas printed by W. Caxton 
in 11.S4, edited by J. Jacobs; The A-Jus of Cains Valerius Catullus, 
translated, etc., by Grant Allen; Plutarch's Komane Questions, trans- 
lated in 1603 by Philemon Holland. 

Plutarch's Romane (^)uestions, translated in 1603, by Philemon Hol- 
land, M. A., of Trinity College, Cambridge, has again been edited by 
Mr. Jevons, of the University of Durham, with additional dissertations 
on Italian cults, myths, taboos, man- worship, Aryan marriage, sympa- 
thetic magic, and the eating of beans. Plutarch's Romane (j>uestions 
is said to be "the earliest formal treatise on the subject of folk-lore." 
Plutarch was the first "to make a collection and selection of dates, 
and to give them a place of their own in literature.'' Plutarch's 
answers, however, are not in the modern vein, for tiiey are framed on 
the assumption "that the customs that they are intended to explain 
were consci<»usly and <lelibeiately instituted by men who jtossessed at 
least as much culture and wisdom as J'lutarch himself." 

The current literature on the scientific study of religions is to be 
followed u]) in the Annalcs du Mus<''e Cuiniet, and especially in the 
RevtU' de rHistoire (U^y^ Peligioiis, pnl)lished on the (luiinet foundation 
under the direction of .M. Jean de P/'ville, with the cooperation of 
l>arth, Leclerc(i, Decharme, llild, Lafaye, Maspero, Heium, and Tide. 

The volume of La IJevue for the year 181)2 contains the following 
original papers : 

Le dieu romain Janus. J. 8. Speycr. 

Les hymnes du Rig Vi^da, sont-ils des priercs. Paul Kcgnaud.

In each number is a review of books, a chronicle of what is doing 
along the line of the scientific study of religions, abstracts from peri- 
odical articles and from the transactions of learned societies, and a 
classified bibliography. For some reason the date of publication is 
omitted in every case, which detracts much from the value of the book 
lists ; but in the abstracts from periodicals an indispensable list of jour- 
nals and their contents will be found.

Till': ADVILNT OF MAN JX AMEKICA.* 



By AUMAIND DE Ql ATREFAGE8. 



OiM' of llic chief pntbli'ins of anthropologists in rogai'd to America, 
is that of the origin of its inhabitants. Were the original American 
IH'ople related to those of the Old World? Or were they indigenous 
t o America and without ethnologic relation to other populations ? IJoth 
these views, as you are aware, have had tlieir partisans. I have al- 
ready made known my opinion uj^on this subject, which is that America 
was originally peopled by emigrants from the Old World. I propose 
to give a brief resume of the grounds of this conviction. 

I recall two rules which 1 have constantly foUowed in the solution 
of questions sometimes so ardently contested, which are raised in the 
history of Man. The first rule is, to put aside absolutely every con- 
sideration borrowed from dogma or philosophy, and to invoke only 
science, that is, experience and observation. The second rule is, not 
to isolate man from other organized beings, but to recognize that he is 
subject (in all that is not exclusively human) to all the general laws 
which govern equally animals and plants. Hence no doctrine or opin- 
ion is to be regarded as tine which, considering man as an animal, 
makes him an exception among organized beings. 

Let us apply these principles to the (piestion before us, but more 
broadly; for it is but a special case of a still more general ])roblem. 
Man is everywhere now. Did he appear every where in the beginning? 
If not absolutely cosmopolitan in its origin, did the human race origi- 
nate at an indefinite number of points; or, originating at a single and 
limited sjiot, has it gradually taken possession of the whole earth by 
migration? At first thought, we might suppose the answer to these 
(luestions would be different according as we admit the existemie of 
one or many human species, but this is an error; for we shall see that 
on this point, at least, the Polygenists nuiy shake hands with the 
Monogenists without being involved in any contradiction with the 
facts. Let us take first the Monogenistic view. 

riiysiology, which leads us to recognize the unity of the human 
sv)ecies, teaches us nothing relative to its geographic origin; it is

514 THE ADVE>;T Oi MAN IN AMEKICA. 

otherwise with the science that is occui)ied. concerning the distribu- 
tion of animals and plants over the surface of the globe. The 
geography of organized beings has its general laws. ^Ailich it is neces- 
sary we should know and interrogate if Ave would solve the problem of 
the peopling of the world. 

The first result of this study is to show that true cosmopolitism — as 
attributed to man — does not any where exist either in the animal or in 
the vegetable kingdom. In support of this proposition it is proposed 
to cite some testimony. On the subject of the vegetable kingdom, 
Candolle says: "Xo phanerogamous j)lant extends over the whole sur- 
face of the earth. There are not more than eighteen of these plants 
which extend over an area equal to half the earth, and no tree or shrub 
is among those j)lauts wliich has the greatest extension." 

In my lectures upon tliis subject, I have cited the best scientific au- 
thorities respecting the principal groups of marine animals, either of 
salt or fresh w^ater. I have reviewed the fauna of the air, beginning 
with the insects, and I have dwelt to some extent on fishes and rep- 
tiles. Omitting all the rest of the birds I notice the Peregrine falcon, 
the area of whose habitat is the most extended, occui:>ying, as it does, 
all the temperate and warm regions of the Old and New World, but 
does not reach the Arctic regions or Polynesia. 

Anatomatically and physiologically, Man is a mammal, nothing- 
more, nothing less. This class interests us more than the preceding, 
and furnishes us with knowledge more precise. Permit me, then, to 
enter upon certain details, taking for my guide the great work of 
Andrew Murray, which became (Classic upon its appearance. By 
reason of their streugtli, their great power of locomotion, and by the 
expanse and continuity of the seas which they inhabit, the Cetaceans 
would seem to have both the greatest capacity and opportunity to 
become cosmopolitan, but such is not the case. Each species is 
restricted to an areamoreor less extended, from which afew individuals 
occasionally make excursions, but always soon return to their proper 
limit. Two exceptions hav^e been claimed to this general rule. A 
Rorqual, with large flippers [the ''humi)back"j, and a boreal Bahenop- 
tera ['^ finback" whale], natives of temperate and frigid seas, have been 
found, the first at tlie Cape of G-ood Hope, the second at Java. But 
even these are said by Van Beneden and (iervais, the two greatest 
authorities on Cetology, to be at least doubtful; but accepting tljem 
as true, it yet remains that neither species has ever been found in the 
seas that border America or Polynesia. Among other animals thnn 
the Cetaceans, there is nothing to be found approaching even a 
narrow cosmopolitism. Here again I am to spare you details. It 
is familiar to all, that Edentat(^s nnd I'achyderms have their respective 
countries clearly defined, and if the horse and the hog are to-day in 
America, it is because they were imported by Euroj)eans. 

The number of Ruminants Avhich inhabit the north of the two con-

tiueuts is vciy small. The IJciudeor and the Caribou uie geuerally 
regarded as only xarieties of one species. Brandt, with some reserva- 
tions, says the sanie<)f the Bisou and the Anroch, tlie Argali (Asiatic 
wild slieex)), ^^^^^ ^^^^ Bighorn (Eocky ^Mountain sheep). But none of 
these species are found in the warm regions of these two hemispheres, 
nor in all Oceaniea. The Garnivora, offer similar facts to the jireced- 
ing: but when we come to the Clnuroptera and the <^)uadrumana we do 
not find a single species common to both continents, or to the rest of 
the world. 

Thus among- all organized beings, whether ])lant or animal, there is 
not a cosmopolitan after the manner of man. JSTow it is evident that 
the area of the actual habitat of any animal or vegetable species in- 
cludes the center where that species first appeared. Ijy virtue of the 
law of expansion the center should likewise be less in extent than the 
occupied area. 'No i^laut and no animal, therefore, originated in all the 
regions of the globe. To suppose that in the beginning man a])peared 
everywhere that we now see him would l)e to make an exception of 
him which wouhl be unicjue. The hypothesis therefore can not be ac- 
cepted, and every monogeuist will reject the supposition of the initial 
cosmopolitism of the human species as a false conclusion. 

The Polygenists must accept the same conclusion unless they refuse 
to apply to man the laws of geography, botany, and zoiilogy that govern 
all other beings. In fact, to whatever extent they have multi])lied the 
species of man, whether they assume that there are two with Virey, 
fifteen witli I>er,\' Saint-Vincent, oi' an undetermined but considerable 
number with (lliddon, they have always united them into a single 
genus; and they could not do otherwise. Now a human genus can be 
no more cosmopolitan than a liuman species. t>peaking of plants, 
Can(h)lle says, '• Tlie same causes have born(i on general and on sj>ecies," 
and this is as true of an imals as of phints. 

Restricting ourselves to mammals, among the cetaceans, Murray 
thinks that the genera of the rorcpial and the <lol])hin aic represented 
in all the seas. Van Bene(h'n and (rervais dispute tliis. We will how- 
ever admit it; it does not all weaken our conclusion, for, excepting the 
cetaceans, there can be no (piestion of generic cosmopolitism. Of the 
ruminants, the genera of tlie deer, the ox, etc.; of the carnivora, the 
cat, bear, etc., ha^'(} representativ<'s in both worlds, but none in Aus- 
tralia or Polynesia. As W(^ examine the higlier gi'ouj)s, we see the 
number of these genera of large iuvn diminishing, until iinally not a 
single genus of monkey is known to be common to the Old and tlie 
New Continent; and the !Simian type itself is wanting in the greater 
part of both worlds and Oceania. 

Thus, whether we regard animals by s])ecies or by genera, tlie area 
of their habitat becomes mitre restricted as the animals are higher in 
the zoologic scale. It is tlu' same with the vegetable kingdom. Can- 
dollesays: "-The mean area of species is as much smaller as the class 



516 THE ADVENT OF MAN IN AMEBIC A. 

to wliicli Ibcy bcloug' hius a more complete, luore developed, or in other 
words a more perfect orgauization." 

The greater restriction of the area in proportion to the increasing 
perfection of the organism is then a general fact, a law applicable to 
all organized beings, and which is easily explained by physiology. 
iS^ow this law is in direct opposition to the hypothesis that there can 
exist a hnman genus comprising vseveral distinct species which have 
appeared in every quarter of the earth, wherever we now find men. In- 
voking the authority of Murray, and the universality of habitat which 
he attributes to the genera of the rorqual and the dolphin, polygenists 
might be tenq3ted to say, " non-cosmopolitism already presents two ex- 
ceptions. Why may there not be a third ? Two genera of cetaceans are 
represented naturally in all the seas. Why may not the human genus 
have api^eared at the start in every land?" This reasoning is faulty 
at its foundation. The rorqual and the dolphin belong to the lowest 
order of mammalia. Man, if we regard the body alone, is of the 
highest order. Unless we constitute them a single exception, they 
nnist obey the laws of the superior group ; consequently they can not 
escape the law of increasing restriction of area. 

It follows therefore that a human genus, as tlie polygenists under- 
stand it, must have occupied, in its origin, an area no more extended 
than that which has comprehended some genera of monkeys. But 
among the monkeys themselves all naturalists recognize a hierarchy; 
all place at their head the order of anthropoid apes, it is then 
from the secondary groups of this family that polygenists should ask 
for indications of the possible extent of area primarily accorded to the 
human genus; and it is well known how inconsiderable is the area 
occupied by tlie genera Gibbon, Orang, Gorilla, and Chimj)anzee. 

Whatever our point of view, we have either to assume that man 
alone escaped the laws which have regulated the geographical distri- 
bution of all other organized beings, or else admit that the primitive 
tribes were domiciled upon a very restricted space. Judging from 
present conditions, making the largest concessions, neglecting the in- 
contestable superiority of the hnman type over the Simian type, all 
that the polygenistic hypothesis permits is to regard that area as 
having been nearly equivalent to that occupied by the difiiereut 
species of Gibbons which range on the continent from Assam to 
Malacca; in the islands from the Philippines to Java. Monogenism of 
course tends to restrict this area vStill more, and to make it equal at most 
to that of the Chimpanzee, which extends nearly from the ( 'ongo river to 
the White Xile. I would be the first to recognize that we may perhaps 
have to eidarge these limits at some later time. I consider the exist- 
ence of man during the Tertiary geologic epoch to be demonstrated; 
and only the geographical distribution of the nujnkeys, his contempo- 
rary, can furnish more precise information upon the primary extension 
of the center of man's appearance. Paheontology has taught us that 



THE ADVENT OF MAX IN AMERICA. 517 

the area Ibrinerly ooctipicd by the Simian tyi)e was evidently more 
coiisiderabh' than it is now. It may have been the same witli the an- 
thropoid apes, bnt down to tlie present time, no fossil is connected with 
that family. The extinct dryopitheeus, long regarded as belonging to 
them, lias been shown by the examination of the best i)reserved remains 
to be nothing more than au inferior ape. The general laws of the geo- 
gi'aphie distribution of beings, and especially that of increasing restric- 
tion of area, with sni)eriority of organization, ])ermit ns to aftirm tliat 
man primarily occupied only a very limited part of the globe, and that 
if he is now everywhere, it is because he has covered the earth by means 
of his emigrant tribes. 

I am aware that this idea of the peopling of the globe by migrations 
has disquieted many persons. It puts directly before us au immense 
unknown; it raises a world of questions, a large number of which may 
api)ear inaccessible to our investigations. It has beeu often said, '^Why 
create all these difticulties? It is more natural to confine ourselves to 
the i)opnlar movement attested by history, and accept autochthonism, 
especially among the lower savages. How could the Hottentots and 
the Fuegieus reach their ])resent country starting from some undeter- 
mined point posited in the north of Asia ? Such voyages are impossible; 
these i)eoples were born at the Cape of Good Hope and at Cape Horn." 
These suggestions may be answered by an anecdote borrowed from 
Livingston, the bearing of which will be easily comprehended. Tliis 
iliustrious traveler lelates how in his youth he with his brothers made 
long excursions devoted to ol)servations in natural history. "In one 
of these exploring tonis," he says, "before the study of geology had 
become as common as it did later, we went into a limestone quarry. 
It is impossible to express with what joy and astonishment I set 
myself to ])icking out the shells which we found in the Carboniferous 
rocks. A qnarryman looked at me with that air (►f compassion which 
a kindly man takes on at tlie sight of a person of feeble mind. I asked 
him how these shells cajne in these rocks, he answered, 'When (Jod 
made the rocks, he made the siiells iuid ])nt them there/" Livingston 
adds, "What ])ains geologists might have spared thems<'lvcs by adoi)t- 
ing the Ottoman philosophy of that workman." It nniy be asked, in 
turn, where would geology have been if men of s(uence had adopted 
that philosophy ? I ask the anthropologists to imitate the geologists: 
I invite tliem to inquire how and by what way the most distant peoples 
have radiated Irom the center of the first api>earance of man to the ex- 
tremities of the globe. I am not afraid to predict brilliant discoveries 
to those who will set themselves seriously to the study of the numerous 
and well-established migrations. In this the past ])ermits a glimpse 
into the future. 

Some years since, when objectors used the language T have just 
recalled, they did not fail to acbl Polynesia to the list of regions which 
man, then destitute of all our i)erfected arts, could not have reached. 



~>1^ TME ADVENT OF MAN IN AMEKICA. 

It is HOW kJlu^\ 11 liDW ('om])letely .such assertions have beeii oontra- 
(licted. Adding- his pevsonal i-esearches to those of his predecessors. 
Hale Urst drew a mai) of Polynesian migrations. Twenty years later, 
aided by the documents subsequently (■ollected, I Mas able to com 
plete the work of the learned American. Xow, as has l)een said by 
the lamented (laussin (so competent to speak in all that relates to 
Oceauica), the peoi>ling of Polynesia by migrations starting from the 
Indian Archipelago is as clearly demonstrated as the invasion of 
Europe by barbarians in the Middle Ages. 

Like Polynesia, America was peojiled by colonies of emigrants from 
the Old World. Their point of departure is to be discovered and 
their tracks to be followed. The labor will indeed be more difficult 
and longer upon the Continent than in Oceauica, ])rincipally because 
the migrations were more numerous and go back to a higher antiquity. 
The flrst Indonesian pioneers who, departing from the Island of 
Bouro, landed in the Samoan and Tongan archipelagos, prol)ably 
made tlie passage near the end of the fifth century, or about the time 
of the conversion of Clevis. The peopling of New Zealand by emi- 
grants from the Manaias goes back at most to the early years of the 
fifteenth century. Thus tlie peoiiling of Polynesia! was all accom- 
plished during our Middle Ages, while the first migrations to America 
date from geological times. Two savants, to whom we owe precious 
discoveries, Ameghino and Whitney, have traced the existence of man 
in America ba<'k to the Tertiary age. It is true tliat this opinion has 
been contested by men of equal re])Ute; but I believe that the view of 
these men is confirmed by a comparison of tlie fossil faunas of the 
pampas of Brazil and the California gravels. 

Judging by what little we know, man reached Lombardy and tlie 
Cantal before he had penetiated to America. It is necessary here, 
without doul)t, to'make the most fi)rma] reserves in fiivor of future dis- 
coveries; but if the fact is confirmed, it would seem to admit of easy 
explanation. Everything leads me to believe that the separation be- 
tween America and Asia as now existing took ])lace before tlie (j)uar- 
ternary epoch. If it was otherwise the species of mammalia common 
to the north of both continents would have been more numerous. The 
men and land animals on the shore of the Bering Sea and Strait have 
been stopped there. But when the great geologic winter substituted 
the polar temperature for a climate similar to that of California, the 
ancient Tertiary tribes were forced to migrate in every direction. A 
certain number of them may have embarked upon the ice extending 
between the two shores, and thus have arrived in America with the 
reindeer, as did their western congeners in France with the same 
animal. From that time the era of immigration was opened for 
America: it has never been closed since. Each year the winter re- 
builds the bridge which unites East Cape with the Cape Prince of 
Wales; each year a road — relatively easy for the hardy pedestrians,

Quarternai y ])('rrod all neighboring reii'ions liaNc enjoyed a i)erpetual 
peace; but we all know that such apeace is n(»t of this Avorld. This sea 
may not have been the only route foUowM'd by American immigrations. 

The chain formed by the .Vleutian islan<ls, and Alaska iurther to the 
soutii, opened a secoiul route to tribes which possessed a little skill in 
iiaviiiation. The Aleuts occupy in I'rof. DalTs ethnologica] chart the 
whole extremity of the peninsula. 

By these ways, what we might call the normal j>eopliug' of America 
may have taken place. But bathed on .either side by a great ocean, 
this continent could not fail to protit by the hazards of navig'ation, and 
we can recognize more and more how it may have been done. It may 
now be said, that with Europe and Africa on one side, and Asia and 
Oceania on the other, these have sent t<» America a number of in^'ol- 
untary colonics more considerable perhai)s than might be supposed. 

Immigrations in America as well as in Europe have been intermittent, 
and separated sometimes by centuries. America has been peopled as if 
by a great human river, which, rising in Asia, lias traversed the conti- 
nent from north to south, receiving along its course a few small tribu- 
taries. This river resembles the torrent streams of which there exist 
exain])les in France. Usually, and sometimes tor years at a time, their 
bed is nearly dry. Then a. great storm comes and a licpiid avalanche 
descends from the mountains where their souiccs rise, covers and rav^ 
ages the i)lain, turning over the ancient alluviums, disturbing and ming- 
ling the old and new material, carrying' farther each time the debris 
eroded on its passage. Such has been the career of our ethnological river. 
Its Hoods moreover have often been diverted to the right or left, and 
it has ojiened new channels. It has also had its eddies ; but its general 
direction has not (dianged, and we can trace it down to the present. 

One of the most agreeable tasks for the students of American pre- 
historic anthropology will be to retrace this river up to its source; to 
determine the succession of its floods; to distinguish the origin and 
nature of the elements which it has swept down; to follow those ele- 
ments from stage to stage, and to thus recover the route each one of 
them has taken to the point of its arrival; in other words, to write the 
history of these migrations of the different people of America. The 
accomplishmcMit of this task, as has already been said, is indeed much 
more diflicult in America than in Polynesia. Those who undertake it

will eiicouiiter nothiug coiTespoudiug to the historic songs aud the 
geneologies composing the oriil archives and trnditioiis so religiously 
preserved in all the islands of the Pacilic. But modern science has 
resources, the power of which we are better and better coming to un- 
derstand, combining the data furnished by the study of geologic strata 
and their fossils, of comparative craniology, of linguistics, and of 
ethnography. We may hope to enter ui)on this group of problems and 
to foresee their soluti<^>n. Serious efforts have already been made in 
this direction, which luiv^e not been unfruitful. One can even now in- 
dicate upon the chart a considerable number of itineraries, even though 
as yet only partial and local. They are scarcely more than fragment- 
ary traces, similar to those which the predecessors of Hale found in 
Oceania. Possibly it will be a long time thus; nevertheless, the Amer- 
icanists should not lose courage; each new discovery, of however small 
importance it may at first ai)iiear, is some progress toward the general 
end. Year after year these fragmentary traces, now so isolated and 
scattered, will be consolidated and coordinated with each, other, and 
then will come a day when a map of American migrations can be con- 
structed showing the movement of early man from Asia to Greenland, 
and to Cape Horn, similar to the maj) already made of Polynesian mi- 
gration from the Indian Archipleago to Easter Island, and from New 
Zealand to the Sandwich Islands. 



l>KIMrnVE INDUSTRY.* 



By Thomas Wilson, LL. D. 



Tlic iiiodorn signification of ]iriniitive industry is the art work of 
]iriiiiiti\(' man, and as sucli is a test of liis civilization. As we know 
of tlie earliest man only by his industries, it is Justifiable undei' this 
head to consider man in tlie hij.;liest antiquity. The origin of man 
and his first known appearance upon earth have always been interest- 
ing subjects an<l have attracted the attention of all men throughcmt 
all time. It is mysterious, nnknown ; it awakens curiosity; it excites 
that portion of man's nature which desires to trace things to their 
origin, and to find a rational and satisfactory exi)lanation of the cause, 
and manner of man's appearing. It has been studied from various 
points; by biology, by paLneontology, linguistics, history, i)sycho-phys- 
ics, and by archaeology. There are vaiious branches of science by 
which the history of man can be studied, but they are all modern. 
The ancuMits knew nothing relating to the antiquity of man. 

Until the times of Copciuicus and (rallileo it was believed that the 
earth was the center of tlie solar system, and that the sun, moon, and 
stars revolved around it. Until the time of Michael Angelo, and Ber 
nard Pallissy, fossil shells found in the earth were believed to be the 
fragments of stars fallen fnmi the heavens. One hundred and fifty or 
two hundred years ago the science of geology commenced to be studied, 
and the formation of the earth, with its i)roper place in the solar 
system, began to be understood. At the beginning of the nineteenth 
century it was an accepted theory that man's appearance upon eartli 
dated only about six thousand years ago. This theory was accepted 
for want of any better; those who rejected it did so a priori, and not 
because they had another or Juster theory to propose. In the (nirly 
])ait of this century, the (iovernmeiit of Denmark organized a commis- 
sion, comi)osed of a geologist, a zoologist, and an arelneologist, charged 
with the duty of investigating that country on the lines of their 
lespective sciences, in the course of which they came upon the art 
Avorks of primitive man. They i)ursued their investigations foi' nigh 
thirty years before the first publication was made, which resulted,

after many disputes and much coiivSiiltatioii, iu tile establishment of 
th(^ I're-historie Ages of Stoue, Bronze, and Iron. This commission 
found various monuments and implements, evidently of human origin 
and manufacture, which being unlike anything belonging to the his- 
toric man of that country, were decided to be the evidence of an earlier 
and prehistoric man. The most important of these were the Dolmen, 
which was his toud>, and the stone hatchets. These discoveries were 
published in 1^>36 by Thomson, archipologist, and founder of the Pre- 
historic Museum at Copenhagen, of wliich he ccmtinued curator for 
fifty years. They were recognized throughout western Europe, and 
they accotmted for similar monuments and implements which theretofore 
had l)een unexplained, or if so, were attributed to supernatural means; 
the hatcliets especially Ijeing believed to have descended from heaven 
in a bolt of lightning or clap of thunder, and they were called by those 
nanu'S respectively, '"Lightning Stone"' or "Thunder Stone," and Avere 
guarded as amulets for the protection of property against lire. This 
was the first step in the discovery of primitive industry. 

In 1859 Darwin pul)lished to the world his theory on the Origin and 
Evolution of Species, and thus be sought to establish and explain the 
antiquity of man. OontemporaneoUs with this was the discovery of 
Paheolithic implements by M. Boucher de Perthes in northern France. 
The place of their original and first discovery was St. Acheul on the 
riv<'r Somme, but afterward they were found in other places, — Ohelles, 
on the river ]\farnc. near Paris, being one of the principal. Tbe latter 
station gave its name to the im] dements, and they have since been 
called Clielleaii. So far as can now be asserted with confidence, these 
implements are the earliest made or used by man. They may have 
served as axes, hatchets, or knives, spear-heads or what-not. They 
appear to have been a tool for every use, just as a sailor would use his 
jackknife if he had no other tool or weapon. Thej^ have been called in 
England ''drift implements" because they were found in the river drifts 
or deposits. Their positions when thus found indicated for them an 
antiquity equal almost to the river valleys themselves, and as belong- 
ing to that geologic period called by the French geologists " Quarter- 
nary," by the English " Pleistocene," and by American " Post-pliocene." 

There was a geologic period when the waters of the earth were en- 
gaged in carving out the ri\'er Aalleys, eroding and cutting them out 
between the blutt's on either side. In that time the rivers fiUed the 
valleys from the hills, pouring down their waters with a rush and carry- 
ing the greatest (piantity of water to the sea. As time progressed the 
waters subsided more or less and the current became slower and less 
powerful. At the close of the Pliocene and at the beginning of the 
Quarternary period, the sand and gravel which had before been carried 
out to sea, began to be deposited here in this bend and on that point 
until the deposit came to the surface of the water and formed what is 
now the highest terrace. Thus the river was narrowed and the terrace 
became a new river bank. This process was lepeated again and again

tmtli the liver finally jecedod to its jneseiit IxmI, Icaviug" sometimes 
three terraces, eacli one hiiilier, (lee})er, and more distant from tlie river 
than the other. These terraces may not exist on the rapid mountain 
streams of the Atlantic slope, but they are plainly to be seen upon the 
longer rivers of the western slope of the Alleghenies. They are ]>laiuly 
manifest in the Mississippi river and it^^ tributaries. One who luis had 
the opportunity for inspection of these gravelly terraces, can see at 
once how the material was brought down by the water and here de- 
posited* It is dependent upon amount and velocity of the water and 
the size of the pebble whether the deposit is of the finer debris or made 
up of pebbles only. Its layers or strata are plainly marked, and 
the volume aiid rapidity of the current can easily be surmised if not 
actually calculated. In France and England l)ones of animals belong- 
ing to that period, animals extinct in modern times, the mannnoth, 
even its ancestor elephas antiquus, the rhinoceros merlcii, the lii])popot- 
amus, the cave bear, the saber-tootlied tiger, had been caught in the 
whirls of water, carried doAvn and de]»ositpd with the pebbles. In 
these gravels, and associated Avitli tliese animals, luxve been found 
these chipped stone implements called chellean. If these implements 
liad been found as isolated S]>ecimens, only a few in number, they 
would not be nearly so convincing as when found as they have 
l)een in almost every river valley of Western Euro])e by the thou- 
sands if not the tens of thousands. They are there usually of flint, 
probably because flint was the material easiest procured and best 
suited to the i)urpose. In localities where flint was not indigenous, 
quartzite has been used, and there are in the U. S. ]!«J"ational Museum 
specimens of this material from Ijugland, France, and Asia. Tlu'y 
were made altogether by chipping, tliat is, by being struck with the 
hammer; it may have been another ])ebble; and so flakes knocked off", 
first from one side and then from the other, until the implement was 
reduced to an irregular but sharj) edge and point. They are made 
sometimes of a bowlder, whether of flint or of quartzite, and the crust 
of the original pebble is sliown and part left for the grip. They are of 
a size to be held in the hand and us(;d as tools or weapons. There is 
no evidence that they were ever hafted, but on the contrary, their 
form is such as to render them most difiticult for satisfactory handling. 
An envelo])e of hide, grass, leaves, moss, or something similar ijrol)ably 
served to ] >rotect the hand. They have two or three peculiarities, which 
it is proper to notice, other than being chii)ped and having a grij). 
They are always of approiu'iafe size for use; they are thicker in pro- 
portion to their width than any other stone-cutting implement; they 
are usually alm()n(l-sha])ed, and their cutting-edge is at the [)oint. 
The (conclusion that the implements were of human manufacture, and 
are evidence of the antiquity of man, was not admitted until after much 
discussion and investigation. The first of them was found in 1830. 
M. Boucher de Perthes soon after published his belief that they were 



524 PRIMITIVE INDUSTRY. 

evidence of what he called "Aiitedeluvian Man." It was disputed, 
first, that they were not of human manufacture. M. Mantel, an English 
geologist of some celebrity, once read an extended })ai)er before one of the 
scientific societies of London to prove they were not. The fact of their 
discovery was disputed, the location had to be identified and established ; 
and it was not until 1859 (thirteen years or more), that the conclusion as 
aforesaid was accepted, and then only after the investigation of a joint 
committee of fifteen prominent scientists, half from ]*]ngland, half from 
France, which met on the ground and were fortunate enough to find 
some specimens in situ. Since then the belief in the genuineness of their 
evidence as high antiquity of man has been accepted by all men. It 
was soon after the discoveries of M. Boucher de Perthes and those of 
M. Lartet of the caves of southern France, that Sir John Lubbock, 
noting the difference between this industry and that of the dolmens 
and polished stone hatchets of Denmark and other countries, and that 
they all belonged to the Stone age, took upon himself the division of 
that age into periods, of which he named the former Paheolithic, that 
is, the early period, and the other the Neolithic, or the later period of 
the Stone age. Thus it will be perceived that the existence of a 
Paheolithic period, the evidence of the occupation of that country by 
man in a period of time earlier than the Neolithic, was as much opposed, 
and required as long a time to secure a favorable settlement as has 
the discoveries of J)r. Abbot of similar implements in the Trenton 
gravels. From France and England the new evidence concerning the 
antiquity of man spread to other countries, and it was found that 
similar implements existed in nearly every country in the world. They 
have been found in Spain and Portugal. Mr. H. C. Mercer, a gentleman 
from Philadelphia, while at Madrid during the last exposition in 1892, 
visited one of the gravel beds of the neighborhood, San Isadore, where 
tliese implements were said to have been found, and he discovered one 
in place which he declares impossible to have been other than an 
original deposit. He secured all evidence by photographs, plaster 
casts, etc. So also of Italy. They liave been found in various locali- 
ties and are to be seen in the museums of different cities. Prof. H. W. 
Haynes, of Boston, found the same kind of implement on the left baidv 
of the Nile, not in the alluvial deposit, but in an eroded gully or water- 
way in the original gravelly deposits. Christian missionaries to the 
Holy Land have found and reported similar implements, and they are de. 
l)osited in the museum at Paris. Two great stations in Hindostan were 
also disclosed, — one near Madras, in southeastern Hindostan, and the 
other in Nerbuddu, on the northwest coast. In many of these 
cases such implements were deposited deep in the gravel together 
with the bones of extinct animals, accompanied only by their neces- 
sary debris of chips, hammers, flakes, etc.; and except certain im- 
l>lements, the hammer, scraper, and leaf-shaped blade, which, from 
their nature, belonged to both periods, nothing was found which

it lias come to pass thtit tlirougliout the world, whatever ditlerences 
there luayhave been betweeu the seientists as to the autiqiiity ofman, 
or the h)cality of his original appearanee, manner of his civilization, use 
of implements (and these difit'erences have been almost intinite), nearly 
all of tiiem have agreed ui)on the existence of this Paheolithic [leriod, 
and that it was anterior to the jS^eolithic period. It is not therefore 
for me to continue in this country a discussion of matters which belong 
to other countries, and which have been fully investigated for years by 
the scientists of those countries and been accepted as settled. If the 
c\idence as to Paheolithic man in America be develoi)ed, arguments 
made and investigations re([uired, it will l)e nothing more than what 
was rcipiired iu France and England at the time of the original discov- 
ery ; but I am not AvithcMit the belief that it will be finally acknowledged 
to be true in our country, as it had been in other countries. A series 
of l)ertinent questions may have already suggested themselves: What 
is the Pahvolithic age? What are its characteristics ? By what test is 
it to be known? Before the name Paheolithic was given to it, indeed 
many times since, it was called the age of chipped stone. It must not 
however be considered that every stone implement belongs to the Stone 
age because it was chipped. Our (»wn jSTorth American Indian, during 
all the time he has been known, even into the present century, has made 
— indeed prehistoric man has always made — his stone arrow and spear- 
heads by chipping. The term Paheolithic age, synonymous Avith chipped 
stone age (to be translated as the early Stone age), is to be regarded as 
descriptive of a certain state of human culture, — a stage of human civili- 
zation belonging to the antiquity of man, and as its name indicates, one 
of the earliest, if not entirely the earliest, civilization known. Sonu? pre- 
historic anthropologists believe there have been earlier civilizations, but 
this conclusion is disputed, and has not been generally accepted by scien- 
tific investigators. In this early state of culture luimitive num em- 
phned stoiui as the material for all his cutting implenn'uts. He was un- 
acquainted with the i)ro(^esses of pecking or grinding, and so, to reduce 
these stones to a sharp <'dge or point, he had recourse to cliipi)ing. This 
he accomj)lished by ]KM-cussion with a hammer or ])unch, or a [)usher of 
some kind, or possibly all three. With these he could knock off the 
large chi])s and tiakes, and could push and press oft' the suuiller ones. 
In this way he reduced his imi)lement to a cutting edge or point. The 
lirst epoch or ])eriod of man's civilization was characterized by these 
implenu'uts. This epoch was called by M. de JMortillet the <-hellean 
(qtoch, but by JNI. Keinach and others, the alluvial i)eiiod, because tin; 
implements W'Cre found in the alluvial dei)osits of the river valleys; while 
others called the age of the mammoth. 

As time progressed man made certain im|»rovements oi inventions 
and attained a highei- culture. Tliese epochs have been differently di- 
vided and differently named; by some they have been called the cav- 



526 PRIMITIVE INDUSTEY. 

ern period; by others the reindeer period; and M. de Mortillet made 
finer distinctions to which lie gave the names of localities in which the 
imiilements occur : Solntre, Moustier, and Madaleine. These were cav- 
erns or rock shelters, and they all rei^resent the cavern period, with the 
mammoth and the reindeer the most abundant, as the represent- 
ative animals. The flint implements of these epochs were changed in 
some degree, — the points become smaller, scrapers appeared ; bone, horn, 
ivory was used; harpoons and fish-spears are found along the river 
banks, and there have been already discovered about 400 specimens of 
engraved animal bones, some of which are only ornaments while others 
are decorated im]»lements, daggers, poignards, etc. It is coming to be 
somewhat tixshionable in the United States to deny the authenticity of 
these works of PahBolithic art; to denounce them as frauds, deelar- 
ing them to be too fine to have been the work of a savage. It is not 
my purpose on this occasion to enter into any defense thereof. Wlien 
ever these charges shall take proper form and appear over responsible 
signatures in the scientific publications of this country, and be trans- 
mitted to France and England, their people, who are most interested 
and best acquainted with these objects, will be abudnantly able to make 
resx)onse thereto. I'ntil that time, they will as I do — ignore all insinua- 
tions. 

It has been announced that new discoveries made by some of our 
local arclneologists, whose names were mentioned, had about demol- 
ished the Palaeolithic age in Europe as well as in America. I dissent 
from this opinion, but it is not to be discussed lierc. Wlieu the prop- 
osition shall have been ijublished, so that we may kno^^' exactly what is 
charged and what is to be combatted, then it can be turned over to the 
European prehistoric experts for them to detend their proposition, and 
no one will doubt their abilit>' to do so. The seeker after knowledge 
may properly ask, how it can be known that these different stages of 
culture succeeded one another in tlie order named, and why they should 
be classed with the Pahcolithic age, 1 can only upon this occasion 
state the facts which api)eared satisfactory to the various investigators, 
without attempting to argue or prove tlicm. In tlic alluvial period, the 
chellean e[)Ocli, these iini)l('ments have been found in various ])arts of 
Europe by the ten thousand, and always without the slightest trace of 
the association with implements of polished stone. A single locality, 
it is agreed, would be little or no value, but wlien it comes to be re- 
peated by the score of times in localities widely s(^parated, belonging- 
even to different countries, with never an exception, it has been ad- 
mitted as satisfactory evidence that there was a Paheolithic age inde- 
pendent from the Neolithic. Tliat it was earlier than the Neolithic 
seems to be established. The position in which tlie implements Iuiac 
been found, indicating their great age; the conditions under which 
they have been found, deep in the undisturbed gravels of the river 
valleys, and associated with the bones of extinct animals, wliich, in the 



riilMlTiVK IJS'DUSTUY. 527 

opiiiioji of till' iiiVL'stigatiug' geologists, proves rliat they belonged to 
a prior geologic jjeriod, tlie (j>uateriiary, or Post-])liocene. 

The progressi\e steps of eulture and invention mentioned as belong, 
ing to the cavern period seem to have been satisfactorily established 
by investigation nmde in the caverns themselves, where in nnmerons 
instances the gradnal filling np of the cavern has preserved the earlier 
occupation at the bottom, while the subsequent occupations have taken 
their respective places, each one above the other in their orders of 
time. For exami)le, at Kent's Cavern, near Torquay, England, the cav- 
erns investigated with all possible care during a period of twelve or 
thirteen years, in which as nuiny thousand dollars were expended, 
under the direction of a committee api)ointed by the British Associa- 
tion, where the strata of these early occupations were covered by layers 
of stalagmite spread over what was then the entire surface, sej)aratiug 
and sealing it hermetically from sul)sequent occupation. Under it, in 
various parts of the cavern, were found these same chipped flint imple- 
ments, Avhicli have been denominated chellean, and beyond the chips 
and flakes possibly the hammers incident necessary for their fabrication. 
No other trace of human industry was found. In the Grotte de Placard, 
in southwestern France, the same super-position was found, Mhich gave 
satisfactory evidence of this succession of human occupation and of the 
accomi)anying changes and iiiii)rovements of human culture. The strata 
containing Xeolithic and Paheolithic objects are distinctly marked and 
are vseparated by a stratum entirely sterile so far as concerns archaeology, 
made up chiefly of broken stones fiom the roof of tlie cavern, several 
inches in thickness. The ca>'ern of Paugeric Haute gives the same 
evidence and is even more positive, for the sterile stratum is about 4 feet 
3 inches in thickness. In the (Irotte de la \'ache the stalagmitic stratum 
between the Paheolithic and Xeolithic indnstries is about IS inches 
thick. The latest indications we have, occnrred in the summer of 1SJ>2, 
when M. Houle was called from Paris to visit the {»re-]iistoric station 
cavern of Schweizcu'sbild, near Scliafliiausen, in tlie immediate neighbor- 
hood of th<' cavern of Tliayingen, Tliiiringen, wliicli gave the celebrated 
<lrawing. engraxcd (m bone, of the reindeer biowsing. M. Bcmle has 
Jnst pul>lisiied a rei)ort of his investigations in the JS^ouvelks Arc/iivcs 
tics Missioihs, tome 111, and lie shows (pi. 3), the drawing which he has 
made of tin- debris left on tlie side of 1;he cavern showing the superposed

the cave nicu were iu tiuy way repiescuted by the Neolithic tribes wlio 
are the first to appear in prehistoric Europe. The former ])ossessed 
no domestic animals, just as the latter are not known to liave been 
acquainted with any of the extinct species, witli the exception of the 
Irish P^lk. The former lived as hunters, unaided by the dog, in Britain, 
while it was part of the continent; the latter ai)pear as farmers and 
herdsmen after it became an island. Their states of culture weie 
wholly different. We might expect on a priori grounds that there 
would be an overlap, and that the former would have been absorbed 
into the mass of the new-comers. There is however no evidence of 
this. - - - 

From the facts at present before us, we may conclude that they be- 
long to two races of men, living in Europe in successive times, and 
separated from each other by an interval sufldciently great to allow of 
the above-mentioned changes taking place in the physical conditions 
of Britain." - - - 

Sir John Evans, iu "Ancient Stone Imidements of Great Britain,'' 
page (il8, says: 

"There ai)i3ears in Britain to have been a complete gap between the 
river drift and surface-stone periods (that is to say, the Paheolithic; and 
Neolithic periods); so far as any intermediate forms of implements arc 
concerned ; and here at least, the race of men who fabricated the latest 
of the Paheolithic implements may liave, and in all probability had, 
disappeaned. at an ei)0ch remote from that when the country was again 
occupied by those who not only chipped out but polished their Hint 
tools, and who were moreover associated with a mammalian fauna far 
nearer resembling that of the present day than that of the Quatenary 
times." 

M. Gabriel de Mortillet, in "Le Prehistorique," page 470, discussing 
the difference between the Palieolithic and Neolithic periods, says the 
former belonged to the Quaternary geologic period while the latter 
belongs to the present or actual periods. "Between these two epochs 
there are differences every where ; there exists a veritable revolution." 
And he puts these differences, one against the other, in the form of a 
table. 

In the later epoch of the Paheolithic period the climate was cold and 
dry with extreme temperatures; while iu the Neolithic period the cli- 
mate was temperate and uniform. 

In the Paheolithic period were living many great fossil animals like 
the cave bear, the giant beaver, and, most plentiful of all, the mam- 
moth; in the Neolithic period all these were exti'.sct. Out of 48 well- 
ascertained species living iu the Paheolithic period in France, and 
Eughind, only 31 were continued in the Neolithic period. 

Of the animals living in the center of Europe on the plains, and as- 
sociated with man in the Palieolithic period, no less than 18 were cold- 
loving. In the Neolithic period, 13 of them, such as the reindeer, 
antelope, musk ox, blue fox and white bear, emigrated to cold countries 
by latitude; while five, the chamois, marmot, wild goat, and others 
have emigrated to cold countries by altitude, going up the mountains^

III the Paluiolithic period there were no (loiiiestic auiinals. In the 
Neolithic period they were abundant. 

In the F^aheolithic period, the i)(>piUation was nomadic; they were 
hunters and fishers, but not agriculturists. In the Neolithic period 
the population was sedentary, and agricultur<^ was well developed. 

In the Pahcolithic period tluMC was i»ractically no pottery in France 
and England; in Belgium there have been two localities where pottery 
has been found. 

In the Palicolithic period there were no monuments of burials, and 
a]»])arently no respect for the dea<l. In the Neolithic i)eriod there were 
many and great monuments, dolmens, and menhirs of great size, with 
elaborate burials. 

There is in the Paheolithic period nothing to show tiiat man had any 
idea of religion or a future state; in the Neolithic [)eriod these senti- 
ments and ideas were well develo]>ed. 

In the Paheolithic i)eriod man has an artistic sentiment; in the Neo- 
lithic period he apparently had none. 

So it appears that the revolution and contrast between the two peri- 
ods is at once physical ami industrial, natural and social. The changes 
in climate suggest clumges of equal importance in orography and geo- 
graphy which must have been accomi)anied by profound geologic modi- 
lication. All these changes in man's civilization, his surroundings and 
environnuMits, took place between the Paheolithic and the Neolithic 
periods, and this in addition to the nmrked change in his industry from 
chipped to polished stone. Thus it will be seen that the latter difter- 
ence is but slight, ami only one (»ul of a dozen, which equalled if it did 
not exceed it in importance and ctt'ect. 

Sir J<»lin Kvans, in "Ancient Stone inq)lements of (Ireat Britain," 
l)age 018, says : 

"The antiquity then that must Ix' assigned to tiie implements in the 
highest beds of river drift may be represented (1) by the i)eriod requis- 
ite for the excavation of the valleys to their i)resent depth; plus (2) 
the ])eriod necessary for the dying out and immigration of a large part 
of the quarternary or |)ost glacial fauna, and the coming on of the pre- 
historic; i»lus (.">) the i)ohshed stone |)eriod; plus (I) the bronze, iron, 
and historic periods, which three latter in this country occupy a space 
of i)rol)ably not less than three thousand years. A single c(|nation in- 
volving so many unknown (pmntities is, as already observed, not sus- 
ce})tible of solution.'' 

I resuuu' the discussion of the existence of the I'iila'olithic age in 
the United States. Theie have been found in the Trenton gravels, 
numbers of rndely chii)i)ed iiiq)lements of aigillite which have been 
called Paheolithic. Tln^y were originally discovered by Di'. Al)bott, 
who lesided at Trenton and who has been interested in pic-historic arch- 
a'ology, and was emi)loye<l by the Peabody .Museum, and who tor many 
years has been devoted to the jiursuit of evidence of early man in the 
Delaware \'alley. He is now curator of the muse'nm of ar<dueology iu

the Uuiversity of Pennsylvania. Dr. Abbott, like M. Boucher de Per- 
thes, was subjected to much investigation and had to stand under the 
light of iier(!e criticism from the opponents of his theory. Di'. Abbott's 
character or ability as an arclucologist, a naturalist, or an observer, is 
not at issue at the present moment. No person can now deny the fact 
that lie believes that he has found a number of these implements deeply 
iubedded in the original gravel deposit of the Delaware River at Tren- 
ton; the implements found at Trenton and otherwheres in the United 
States have the same general appearance of those heretofore shown 
from other parts of the Avorld. In addition to my own testimony on 
this subject, I may add the testimony of M. Boule, a noted French ge- 
ologist and student of prehistoric man, on the same subject, which has 
a|)peared in the last number of Anthropologies vol. iv, pp. 3G, 37 : 

"During my voyage in the United States in 1801, on the occasion of 
the International Congress of Geology, at Washington, I was able to 
see some of the cliii)ped stones of Trenton, in the collection of pre- 
historic arclnieology at the Smithsonian Institution, and in the Peabody 
.Museum. I could there study at leisure the collections of Dr. Abbott. 
That which struck me most forcibly was the similitude, I may say 
almost identity, of the form of the American instruments with the 
European palaeolithic implement. At Trenton, as at Amiens, Paris, 
in the collections of Dr. Abbott as of those of .M. d'.Vcy, there is, along 
with a certain nund)er of chips and unformed pieces, also a number of 
finished i)ieces showing careful work, and which could not be 'rejects' 
of fabrication. The most carei'ul and most competent archa'ologist of 
our country will ])e unable to distinguish otherwise than by the nature 
of the material the difference between the instrnments of Trenton 
(as well as of other ])arts of the United States) from tlie pre-historic 
implements (»f Europe. There is, in this fact, an argument in favor of 
tlie antiquity of these specimens AAliich will impress ])re-historic arch- 
aeologists of experience." 

The fact that other gentlemen entitled to ecpuil credit for accuracy as 
observers have sought at Trenton for these implements in 1893 and 
failed to find any, is no evidence that Dr. Abbott may not have found 
them there from 1S7<» to 1890. The gravel at Trenton speads over and 
fills up a saucer-like depression about three miles in diameter, and from 
35 to 12 feet in dei)th in the center. That these gentlemen should have 
vsought with all care and closeness these gravels in the great sewer 
which has been lately laid through the city of Trenton near the river, 
and have found none of these implements, is no evidence that Dr. Ab- 
bott may not have found them among the acres of gravels 10 to 30 or 
more feet in thickness that have been dug out a mile away from the 
aforesaid sewer by the Pennsyhania Ilailroad, during a i»eriod of ten 
or fifteen years past, to obtain gravel for its road ballast. 

Illustrative of my proposition, I may cite the depot of Chelles, near 
Paris, wliere thousands of these implements have been found. It is an 
immense gravel bank, much the sanu^ as at Trenton, 20 or 30 feet thick, 
extending over an area of a huiulred or more acres in the valley of the 
river Marne. It is located on a railroad, »ud was used as was the

giiivt'liit Tieutoii, luiviiigbeen dug out ;iud transported as railroad bal- 
last. I visited this station on tlie excursion of the International Pre-his- 
toric Congress at Paris in 1880, and there listened to an acrimonious 
discussion as to the precise locality in whicli the r<'spective kinds of 
implement had been found, as for example what kinds were found at 
the top, and what kind at the bottom of the deposit; and it was there 
made apparent notwithstanding that the ten thousand implements 
obtaiiu'd from that dejwt, the princi})al <lisputants, the leaders of 
opposing schools, those who had devoted their utmost time, care, and 
attention, to the investigation of these implements and the theory of 
antiquity and civilization to be based thereon, none of them had ever 
found these implements in place. jVI. Boule, himself a noted geok)gist, 
a close observer, and an ardent investigator, interested in this branch 
of study, makes the same declaration in the last number of the . 4n//<)'o- 
poloijlst. As it is made since his visit to the r'nited States, and bear- 
ing upon this dis(nission, I may be i)einiitted to (piote his opinion as to 
the want of value in the objection made that other i>ersons than Dr. 
Abbott have not found these implements when they sought them in the 
Trenton gravels. M. Boule says, in the last number of V Anthropolofiie, 
vol. IV, !>. 38, in reporting his visit to the United States during the 
last international geologic congress: 

"I did not myself find any of these chipped stone implements during 
my excursion to the gravel pit at Trenton, but there is a similar locality 
in the neighborhood of Paris, very rich in implements — in Chelles for 
example — where 1 ha\e been many rimes ami my searches liave always 
been infructuous ; but the deposit of gravel ])iesents entirely the same 
topographic and stratigraphic dis]»ositi(»n of the ])alaM>lithic alluvium 
of the noith of Prance and south of I'^ngland." 

This ])roposition will be bettei* understood when the conditions are 
once exi>hiined. Tiic <le]»ot at ('hellesisin the neighborliood of 100 
acres area, 4:4,(M>() square feet to an acre, 100 times that to 100 acres in 
surface measure. If the gravel bank be 1*0 feet deep, it would be twenty 
times that number, 88,000,000 cubic feet of gravel. I have said 1,000 
implements; there may have been 10,000 such implements found at 
Chelles, which, scattered among 88,000,000 cul)ic feet of gravel, will giv^e 
an average of one implement to (nvry 8,800 cubic feet oi" gravel. Some- 
times they are bunched so that oiu' may find a dozen in a single pocket, 
or a hundred in a single day, but this only decreases the chances of 
finding them Avithin any specified time. This exidains M. Boule's state- 
ment that a man may stay there and watch the diggers for a. week 
without tindmg a single inqdement — this too in a gravel bank which 
furnished 10,000 implements. I do not give these figures as exact. 
They are only to vserve as illustrations. I do not know that there were 
just 100 acres, and 1 only si>eak tiom remend)rance of its appearance 
when 1 estimate its depth at 1*0 feet, and I only <'stimate 10,000 imple- 
ments as having been found there. 

M. deMortillet has made ;i similar estimate with regard to St. Acheul, 



532 PRIMITIVE INDUSTRY. 

that other great depot of Palieolithie implements which furnished a 
greater number probably than any other in the world; and he has 
shown that the dissemination of the implements through these grav- 
els rendered it very unlikely that any person could find an imple- 
ment in any given length of time. On the other hand, Dr. Capitan dis- 
covered a deposit in the southwestern part of France during the summer 
of 1892, of which he said he found an implement or ;i bit of worked flint 
every five minutes. It was quite different from this in the workshop 
of Bois de Rocher in Brittany, discovered by MM. Micault and Fornier. 
That was a Avorkshop, and the implements were found all together and 
in a few days' or hours' excavation. Consider the comparative scar- 
city of these implements in the Chelles and St. Acheul gravel banks, 
and the comparative scarcity of these implements in the gravel deposits 
at Trenton will not appear strange, nor will the fact that gentlemen 
spend weeks or even months in the search through tliese gravels in 
what proved a vain attempt to find Paheolithic implements be evidence 
against their existence. Imagine the gravel bank adjoining the Penn- 
sylvania Kailroad depot at Trenton, extending by estimate, eastward 
half a mile, a quarter of a mile in width, the gravel 20 or even 30 feet 
in thickness, dug down and thrown into cars upon temporary tracks, 
which are moved each day or each week close into the bank — imagine, I 
say, this great mass of gravel, amounting to millions of cubic feet, with 
the number of Paheolithic implements said to have been found by Dr. Ab- 
bott, I care not whether we take the smallest luimber, 40, or the largest 
number 400 or 500, scatter them through this pile of gravel, and then 
consider what would be the chance of a person finding one of these, I 
care not what his ability as an observer, how ubiipiitous he was, nor 
with what attention and zeal he followed the shovel of the diggers and 
inspected the fine gravel they threw out. I <ui]y lepeat the sole con- 
clusion intended by this line of argument — that it is no proof these 
implements do not exist in these gravels that other gentlemen have 
sought for and failed to find them; while Dr. Abbott, who has lived in 
the neighborhood all his life, has been engaged in the search for twenty 
years or more, has invoked the aid and enlisted the co-operation of his 
neighbors, the diggers, and the public in general, and during all that 
time has found only the number suggested, I care not whether it be 
40 or 400. No attempt has been made by anyone to imj)each the ve- 
racity of Dr. Abbott in this matter. We must accept his statement as 
to the finding of the implements. The conclusions to be drawn from 
his facts are fair subjests for argument, and I would not pretend be- 
cause we uuist follow Dr. Abbott's facts, that therefore we must 
necessarily adopt his conclusions. 

It maybe said that in this matter Dr. Abbott has been deceived; 
that the implements to which he has attributed this antiquity have been 
fabricated, imposed upon him as genuine, when they might have been 
made by the workmen with intent to deceive. ♦This has occurred ia

other places. M, Boiichei- de Perthes himself was sadly deceived in 
several cases. One proof of the antiiiiiity of stone implements, or of 
some of them, is by the iHitlna or w<'atherin^- shown on the exposed 
surface. Any of the arjiillite implements tVom the Trenton gravels 
may be broken and thns show tlie ditterence of color between the in- 
side and the ontside. On the ontside it is a dnil gray, on the inside it 
is shining black; the bhick color is the natural appearance of the 
stone; this is shown when first chipped; the gray api>earance is ft^om 
the weathering, and it has been made by long exposure. 

Evidences of the ])rimitive industiy of man have been found in many 
other places of the United States besides Trenton. At Loveland and 
^[adison, Ohio, by Dr. Metz; at Newcomerstown, Ohio, by Mr. Mills; 
at Fedora, Ind., l)y Dr. Cresson, and at Little Falls, Minn., by Miss 
Babbitt. All (d" these localities have been attacked in late publications 
by disbelievers in the existence of Paheolithic ^lan. In order that 1 
may be fair in argument, and acce|)t fully the facts according as they 
are found by the observer, it must be conceded that the evidence of 
])ala'(>lithic occui)ati(>n at Little I-'alls has been successfully assailed by 
the investigations of last summer made there by Mr. FTolmes. 1 have 
ui)on another occasion complimented Mr. Holmes u])on the system, 
thoroughness of his investigations there; and his conclusions, so far as 
they are based upon those investigations, must stand until some subse- 
quent investigator, going over the same, ground, shall change the 
facts. 1 may have disagreed with Mr. Holmes in his comdusicms, but 
I concede his facts must staiul. 

Some years ago 1 made an ai)peal in the form «>f a ciicular from the 
Smithsonian Institution, asking for information, which was .s<;attered 
throughout the United States, concerning these objects, and I ac- 
companied this with <*uts and engravings of similar objects, some 
from Euro])e and others from Ameiica. 1 received resjwnses from 
nearly every State in the United States, and many States responded 
with great numbers. I do not i)ropose to follow the result of this 
investigation in all its details, but to say that ther(^ was rejxn'ted to 
the Smithsonian lnstitutioi» a large number ot im]tlements similar 
in every regard to those found in the gravels at Trenton and other

were not Paheolithic — did not res<'mble Paheolithic impleinents — many 
of them were bnt chips and lude flakes — some objects were nuin- 
ifestly Neolithic; bnt omit all these, still there was a. considerable num- 
ber of implements, representing pi'actically every State in the United 
States, which wonid (■<u'res])ond in every particular (save in some ca.ses 
material), with those from IOnroi»e. These identical imi>lements, had 
they been found in western Eurojte, and j>resente(l before any com- 
mittee of the best an^lueologists, they would l)e pronounced Paheo- 
lithic. In this connection, I refer again to the quotation made a little 
time ago fr(»m M. Boule, wherein he states the same thing. But these

implements were not found in Europe, and their value as evidence of 
Prehistoric Man in the United States has been disputed. 

You will ask what is my conclusion with regard to this matter. I 
conclude that this similarity of such vast numbers of these imj)le- 
ments from two continents and representing widely separated peoples 
is, as M. Boule has said, " an argument in favor of their antiquity which 
will greatly impress prehistoric archa-ologists of experience." It is 
to be taken as serious evidence in favor of Palaeolithic M an in Amer- 
ica, as it has proved him to have existed in Euroi)e. But it is only 
a single step in the ladder of prehistoric science; and is to be treated 
more as a working hy]iothesis calculated to direct attention and stim- 
ulate investigation. My conclusion is not announced dogmatically, nor 
will it be defended at jill hazards. It is expressed under all reserve, 
and subject to future discoveries. It will have served a good purpose 
if it shall promote the search of the river valleys for these implements, 
cause them to be gathered and savrd as of A'alue to science, to note 
well their associations with other subjects to be noted, and to discover 
their material and if possible the original deposit and the place of 
their ftibrication. By these means we may hope to arrive at the truth 
concerning these implements and their relation to Pre-historic Man, 



PKETIIRTORTC NEW ]MEXICAN POTTEllV 



By Henry Hales. 



In January, 1889, I received some ancient pottery from a friend in 
New Mexico. I was smprised to find that solittl«' was kiiowii of this 
description of ware among' collectors. Not a single piece was seen in 
the New York museums. I met Prof Frederick Starr in the Museum 
of Natural History, who took much interest in the ware. Referring- to 
several works on American antiquities I found fragments of this war*' 
illustrated in -John R. Bartlett's i)ersoual narrative as boundary com- 
missioner of the rrnited States expedition, 1850 to 185.'>, which he 
found in the Gila Valley. Although so man\ tVagments had been 
found, the whole ware had been seldom seen. All the information I 
could get about it was very meager. That it was found in the valleys 
and dee]) in the ground, accompanied by skeletons, also that nuicli was 
broken in getting it out. was all 1 could hear about it. With these 
few hints I determined to go to New Mexico to observe for myself, and 
gain information regarding this i)eculiar i)(>ttery. My route was by 
the Ivio (irande Railroad in Xew Mexico to Socorro, west to ^Fagda- 
lena. 1 then struck across the San Augustine plains to tlie Tale K'osa 
Canyon, which runs west to Arizona, in-ar the heads of tiie l-'risco and 
Gila riyers. 

I found the ruins conimenced in TuJe IJosa Canyon, which I followed 
for 20 miles, aud in two of its branches. All that can be seen to 
indicate ruins is a few loose stones on the surface of tlie ground, 
scarcely recognizable, which probably accounts for their lying so long 
tindisturl)ed. In most cases T found them when; the canyons opened 
into little valleys, with a bi'<»ok, or, more often, what had once been 
one, but now a dry guily. Between the, alluvial levels of these Avater 
courses and the foot of the uiesas or monntains, there is generally a 
slightly rising ground, which appears to be out of danger of floods; 
these were the selected sjiots lor building. Tlie earth is not as rich as 
the lower levels, and is composed of clay, a little saiul, and some broken 
stone, with a growth in ])atches, of pinon i)ine, junipers, a species of 
small walnut, and, in moist places, very large, tall ]>ines, varieties of 
cacti and yuccas.

1 toiiiid ill some looiUvS very large old dead Junipers that were larger 
than the surrouiidiug trees. Some of the ruins are uiiles from any 
water. They are scattered at short intervals of a hundred yards to a 
mile or more apart in different directions, as the ground lirs favorable, 
and at times on higher rising ground. From these conditions it w ould 
appear that the population was at one time numerous iii these vallej's. 

1 found some extensive ruins on a l)ran<'h canyon a long distance from 
water. The ruins I excavated in were <>() feet, plainly traceable, with 
appearances of extending 100 feet further, l)y 117 feet. The 60 feet 
was divided into the widths of tliree rooms — the first IC by 20 feet, the 
second 18 by 24, and the third 1.") by IS, which, with the width of walls 

2 to 3 feet, made the distance. There were three other rooms which I 
could trace, adjoining the ends of these rooms, as seen in Fig. 1, and a 
small middle room 8 by 8 feet, but the walls were not accurately laid 
bare. The outside walls were laid up with roughly hewed stone, worked 
into squares of about 14 inches and about 3 inches thick. Some of the 
partition walls were laid with uncut bowlder stones. The walls were laid 
in clay cement smoothly plastered inside; mostof the loose stone on the 
surface was uncut stone. The depth of walls was from "> to 8 feet, Avith 
clay floors at the bottom of rooms. In rooms 16 by 20, on the ol^t side 
wall, were two openings, one ap])arently each for door and window; they 
were blocked up with rough stone laid without cement. This would 
make it appear that the lioors of the rooms were once about the level of 
the earth outsi<le. Below these floors, mid close to or under the founda- 
tions, were skeletons of adults, but so far decomposed that only the 
large bones and skulls were geiu'rally traceable; very few of these can 
be exhumed Avhole. Nearly ;ill the teeth are very sound. 1 found in 
one room two skeletons iu ii doubled position, partially under the foun- 
dations, as shown in Fig. 2. There was a hearth made of four long 
pieces of scpiare-dressed stone forming the frame, filled up with cement 
ill the middle. Under this liearth I found the skeletons of two children. 
There were pots about tlie iieads of the adults, rnder the chin of one 
1 found eleven shell rings and ;i turiiuoise bead. All the skeletons are 
not accompjinied with pots; some h;i\'e nothing with them, whih> others 
have several i)ieces; some contain Ix'ad necklaces, charred corn, beans, 
punii)kiii seeds, fragments of woven fnbrics, cord, braids, ;ind liuman 
iniir, etc. Also bone im]>lem<',nts in ;i perfect state of i)reservation are 
fcmnd near the human bones that are so deciomposed. The ])otteiy con- 
sists of several kinds; there are the coil pots, as are found in mounds 
and cliff dwelbngs, but many are of a much finer ware. A red, smooth, 
glossy ware witlumt ornamentation, all of a bottle or vase form, ihit 
tlie chief interest centers in tlie white or riither light gray and black 
ware, finely decorated and glazed. Tlie designs ai'c unique, both iu 
form (which is various), and the styh' of figure in decorating, much of 
which is like steps in endless variety of changes, curves, and lines in a 
maze-like intricacy in some, with geometrical figures in others, but the

wliicli the Mexicans called moist stones, for after holding- them in the 
warm hand and using a little friction they feel moist. In some of the 
rooms charred parts of beams of pine were found ; all the raw wood had 
Undoubtedly rotted away. Many were the speculations of the inhabi- 
tants I heard expressed about the race of people, and why they left, 
none of which gave any solution to the difficulty. It is evident tliat 
only ;i very few bodies were buried under the houses, or they would be 
much more numerous after a long continued occupation. It seems a 
great mystery how these buildings became filled up and have tragments 
of pottery through the earth from top to bottom. The earth in most 
localities is quite hard, and can be removed only by a pick-ax. If an 
archieologisthadau entire building cleared out and laid bare inside and 
out, a better solution might be arrived at. 



RELr<JS OF AX INDIAN nUNTINU GROUND, 

IN YORK f'OT'NTY. PA. 



BY ATREUS AVANNEK. 



York County is assuiiu-d to b;ivc been only occasionally visited by 
Indians and reputed to be comparatively barren of relics. In a re- 
cently ])ublished liistory of the county, it is said that — 

'• It [York County] was, as it appears from the Indian com[)laints, 
])receding" its settlement, a hunting ground, or on the way to hunting 
grounds, nearly all woods, and claimed by the Indians to have been ex- 
pressly reserved for them by William Penu, The original settleis here 
found imnuMise tracts of land entirely deniuled of timber by the annual 
fires kindled by the Indians for the purpose of improving their hunt- 
ing grounds." 

Sucli a statement concerning the Indian occu])ation, .vithout calling 
into question its accuracy, is too general and vague It conveys to us 
no conception of tlu; extent, cliara<'ter, location, and nninber (»f Indian 
settlements in the territory. 

Desirous of learning moi-e about these aboriginal settlements, the 
author sele<;ted a limited area of the county and then proceeded to care- 
fully search the ground. The object was to ascertain just uhat evi- 
dences of Indian occupation could yet be found strewn over the fields, 
many of which ha\o been ciilfivated for more than a hnndred years. 
That the search was well rewarded isproxcii by the nninbcr and \ariefy 
of specimens collected. 

The region selected extends along the ('odoiiis Creek, lia\ing a 
breadth of two miles, and a length of six, with the city of York, (York 
County, Ta.,) in its center. The area flins located reaches from the 
forks of the creek, above tJu; city, to two high hills, between which the 
Codorus Hows. The surface of the, land is undnlatory and well watiircd 
by numerous runs. It is now a thickly settled and highly cnlfi\ated 
part of the county. All the relics described in this ])ai)er have been 
found along the Codorus and its tributary runs, since ISSi'. 

All the implements herein described were collected from the surface 
in various fields.

Leaf -shaped implements. — Whether the specimens illustrated were 
used as lanceheads or not is, of course, mere speculation. In addition 
to "the absence of a notched or stemmed base or both," by ^vhich Dr. 
Abbott separates lance from spear-heads, these specimens are of com- 
paratively great thickness. The accompanying illustrations will more 
clearly serve to point out the difference betAveen lance-heads and spear- 
heads, whether such differences are enough to warrant the inference 
that they were used for different purposes or not.

the other stone implements we have found. The shallow Godorus, Avith

seem to indicate a different use. Fig. 10 has on each side, just below

form. Other specimens not des<-ri1)e(l are like the ones illustrated. All

The base of Fig. M is broad, concave, aud not chipiH'd. The rest of 
its margin is cliipped to a cutting edge. Fig. 30 is a tiake of felsitic 
rock with a somewhat blunt, serrated edge. Fig. 34 has been chipped 
to ii remarkably good edge, with the excei)tion of the basal end and a 
small flat area at the convex margin. By placing the foretinger on 
this flat surface and the tliumb on the side a firm grip can be had which 
will enable one to make excellent use of the entire concave edge. This 
edge is decidedly tlie better of the two. We have notliing else from

tion resembles it.

unmistakable evidences of having been used to drill holes. The point 
is worn smooth and more or less even, whilst abov(^ it, on both sides, the 
serrated edges are sharp and angular. Figs. 38 and 39 have broad 
bases and can be easily and firmly held between the thumb and finger.

Axes. — The axes as a rule are small, with a groove extending around 
the stone. Most of those that come from the Susqnelianini, near the 
nu^nth of the Codorus, where numbers are found, have one ungrooved 
side. Fully three out of e\'ery four are thus fashioned. ^Moreover, the

by but a siugle specimen? The most plausible inference is that the 
two types were intended for different purposes; i)robably the axes 
found here were carried about for general use, whilst the heavier 
ones form the Susquehanna, often differently grooved, as stated, were 
designed for some special use as boatbuilding. One of the axes, 
weighing only one pound (Fig. 47), has two parallel grooves extending 
entirely around. Of course, it is hard to assign the reason for two 
grooves in such a light stone, when other axes weighing much more, 
as Fig. 48, are provided with only one. This ax is slightly battered at 
the bade, and has also a small piece out of one end of the moderately 
siiarp edge. Tlicre is one noticeable difference between the edge of 
this specimen and that of Fig. 48. Fig. 47 bears transverse strise on 
its smooth sides near the edge, which evidently were made in sharpen- 
iug it, whilst Fig. 48 is marked with rather coarse longitudhial striic. 
The latter looks very much as though it had been used as an agricul- 
tnral implement and had been scratched through such use. It has a 
blunt edge, and, being of tough and hard material and of a pointed 
shape, would have made a good digging tool. Fig. 40 is made of quartz- 
ite. It is well wrought, and with the exception of a slightly broken 
back, is without a flaw. We were not able to collect many axes, and 
we do not know of more than 14 from the region in question. Of these, 
the illustrated ones are the best specimens. The number found seems 
comparatively large when the circumstances are considered. Axes, 
being conspicuous objects, are amongst the tirst specimens picked uj). 
And in a region cultivated for more than a hundred years, such as 
this, it is quite i^robable that many of them were found and carried 
away. Moreover, it is the custom of our farmers to collect the stones 
from the fields and throw them into low and waste places. Several 
of the axes were picked up in the i)ublic road, where they had been 
thrown into mud holes along with other stones from the fields. Along 
the Susquehanna it is not an unnsual thing for the lishermen to use 
these axes, on account of their con venieut grooves, as sinkers for their 
tish nets! Of course, whenever the strings with which they are tied 
break, which often happens, the axes will be left amongst the water- 
worn stones at the bottom of the river. 

Hammers. — Fig. 50 is a water-worn and smooth sandstone. It has 
been slightly roughened on each side, near the center, by pecking. The 
marginal area is less smooth than the rest of the surface, having been 
evidently roughened, but not battered by use. The evidences of its use 
by the Indians, whilst unmistakable, are very slight, and show that 
this particular stone was selected because it naturally possessed the 
desired shape. No doubt other worn pebbles were used as picked up 
by the Indians; at any rate, we occasionally find a spherical stone with 
ii battered margin that looks exactly like a much-used hammer, only 
there are no pits pecked into it.

here the origin of such specimens, as given by one not accustomed to

from the Susquehanna. The imjyressions are evidently of two kinds, 
those made by a stylus of some sort in the hands of the ancient potter 
and those which resulted from the structural irregularities of some 
receptacle within which the plastic clay was first shaped.

Implements of iDikiiown K.scs. — Fig. 59 has been broken so that its 
orij^inal form is a matter of conjecture. However, it is vSo strikingly 
like another strange specimen (Fig. 58) from the Susquehanna, which 
is entire, that we have no hesitancy in concluding that both were 
designed for the same purpose. Both are nmde out of chlorite, and are 
not in the least battered. They could not have been used as weapons 
or as agricultural implements, since the stone is very brittle and is 
moreover so soft as to be easily scratched with the tinger-nail. These 
are the only specimens of this shape, or of chlorite, that I have ever 
seen from this or adjacent localities. We think they were probably 
used as ceremonial imjdements.

speculation. Among our implements of unknown uses, perhaps the

is a triangular prism of slate, with sides three fourths of an inch wide,

the ancient use of the stone for whetting purposes.

variety of specimens found is not so easily deterniiued. One thing is 
certain, that as the result of persistent search, almost a complete 
" series" of relics has been collected. Though the author found nearly 
all the objects here illustrated and described, yet any one else, had he 
as thoroughly and persistently searched the same region, would have 
been equally successful. This is i)roved by the fact that several others 
(Casi)er Loucks, George Miller, and John J. Frick) interested in the 
subject have found specimens in the same territory. The discoveries 
here made lead us to infer that other places, in the eastern portion of 
the United States, ncnv thickly settled, would be just as productive 
of specimens. We do not believe that this region is more favorable 
to the production of relics than other localities similar in natural 
features. Attention is called to a few difficulties that beset the care- 
ful searcher. Fields tliat now yield few relics jnay have them deej)er 
down. The building of dams lias materially changed our streams. 
Places that once were high and dry on the bank are now covered by 
every freshet. As a consequence, the sediment has accumulated, and 
the relics have been buried beyond the reach of the plow. Occasionally 
a field is washed bare of all the loose soil. In that event, you can not 
reasonably conclude that the number and variety of specimens found 
there indicate a mure dense settlement than elsewhere. Taking these 
and other circumstances into consideration, in connection with the 
relics found, the author believes that this region was oftener frequented, 
and longer occupied, by larger bands of Indians than the historian 
leads us to infer. This place may have been the site of a well estab- 
lished settlement; a settlement in which much the same primitive occu- 
pations were engaged in as characterized well-known and more exten- 
sive settlements along the Susquehanna. If this region is an average 
sample of supposed "barren" lands, may we not conclude that America 
was more thickly settled, or longer inhabited (perhaps both), by the 
Indian than is generally supposed 1

Tliese monnds, three in number, are, or were, located about 4 miles 
east of Til'lin (NE. ^ of section 4, townslii]) 1 north, range l."> east, 
Eden Township, Seneca County, Ohio, and on tlie west side of the 
Morrison State road where it crosses Rock Creek). (iMap, Eig. 1.) 

Concerning their origin, the Moliawk* Indians then inhabiting that 
section could give the settlers no information. The Indians had uo 
theory or tradition accounting ior the presence of the landmarks. 
Large forest trees covered these monuments then, and among them 
were cherry trees 20 inches in diameter. Before the cultivation of tlie 
soil after the removal of the forest had 
altered the i)roportions of the mounds, 
they were well rounded, and the largest 
was perhai)s (> feet or more in heiglit and 
about 40 feet in diameter. Two, the 
largest and the smalh'St, were near each 
other on the south side of tlie stream. 
(See map.) The former was slightly 
less than an eignfh of a mile from the 
bank, and the smaller otw about half 
tliat distance, Tlie tliird was on the otlu'i- side, about as far as the lat- 
ter from the cr<'ek an<l a thii'd of a mile fiom tlu> largest. It was but a 
slu)rt way beyond the culmination of a, giMith^ rise of about-.") Ceet above 
the creek \ alley. The b;inks on the south side weri^ rather steej) and oO 
ro 40 teet high. The large mound was located on the rounded border 
of ail elongated <Iei)ression tributary to the creek. 

The mound on I he noith side (»f the creek' was (U'ossed by the fence 
dividing' the road from a modern graveyard, and when a grading was 
made, not long pi ior to 18S(i, for the <;on\-eiiience of standing teams 
driven to the church, iiuiiian remains w (>re unearthed on the roadside 
of the fence. The other half probably si ill remains intact.

level with the general surface. It was tentatively excavated by one 
who had seen it before being plowed down and a small excavation, 
made in search of the charcoal and ashes, whose presence would con- 
firm the hypothesis of position, discovered human remains. These 
however had been once exhumed and were reinterred in a confused 
heap. They were preserved by the writer, but no further search was 
made then. It was at the largest of the mounds, and the one least dis- 
turbed, that the systematic, though partial exploration was under- 
taken. This was in the summer of 1886, and then the mound was 
hardly, if any, more than 4 feet above the general surface, and 60 feet 
in diameter. (Fig. '-i.) Hurried excavations brought to light the 
charcoal and ashes, clean shells, broken bones of animals^ and broken 
pieces of primitive dark pottery. Another unorderly opening resulted 
in the discovery of the two smaller human skeletons, but they were 
not secured entire. The skull of one of these "individuals" probably 
remains in the mound.* 




Human remains were found in all of these. The largest mound con- 
tained three skeletons (Fig. 3) that were uncovered, and a complete 
excavation might be expected to reveal more. 

Feasting accompanied the interment. Fires were built on the un- 
completed funeral pile, with which meats were cooked. Good sized 
pottery vessels were brought to the grave, probably for rise in the 
feasting, and at least .some of them were either accidentally or inten- 
tionally demolished and the fragments scattered with the ashes 
and charcoal and broken bones of animals over the half-built mound. 
The tires were probably burning during the burial. The feasters en- 
joyed the meat of the deer, beaver, raccoon, squirrel, hare ( ?), turtle, 
birds, fish, and clam. The marrow was a much relished portion of the 
meat; every l)one was ])roken so that the marrow was uncovered. The 
need of something with which to accomplish this breaking may account 
for the presence of moderate sized limestone bowlders a few feet apart 



* This description well illustrates the detriment and sometimes irreparable dam- 
age to science arising from ill-informed opening of mounds. A mound once dis- 
turbed is valueless to science. Its evidence as to tlie life history of its constrnctors 
is destroyed. Circular 49, issued by the Smithsonian Institution, No. 730, explains 
this and contains duections for mound and cave explorations.

and i)ottery were scattered promiscuously, with the ashes aud char- 
coal patches, through a vertical rauge of more than a foot. The lime- 
stone bowlders were about 6 inclies in diameter, and lay with a rude 
uniformity a few feet apart tlirougliout the layer. The underlying- 
rock of the section is limestone (cornstone), the boundary between the 
outcrop of this and the water line is near, and the southwestward 
moving glaciers have made this element strong in the drift products of 
the country. 

In the cliiircoal hiyer the most numerous bones were those of the 
" deer. A good number ol' only partially 

broken lower jaws were found, and a few 
decvayed horn fragments. Several speci- 
mens of fragmentary beaver .skulls, retain- 
ing the teeth, and a few raccoon jaws, are 
in the collection, bnt some of the clam shells 
were not broken; these showed the effect of

Making exception of the two small pot-

no entire specimens of pottery were discox-

could be imagined to have been impressed 
by bark. By i)rojecting the curve of one of 
the rim fragments, tlie opening of the jar of 
which it was once a ])art, was found to have 
been 8 inches in diameter. A dark bluish 
or greenish slate, hard, tough, and fine, was 
the nmterial of which the large pipe, buried 
with the largest skeleton, was made (Fig. 4). 
It is the same stone as that from which 
most of the fine mound ornaments were cut. 
Erosion revealed a kind of eimmel, perhaps 
due to chemical action on the surface. Tlie 
erosion occurred where the stone had been 
stained, ]>resumab]y by the acids of the dead 
body. The finish was excellent. The form 
might suggest that the inaker had intended 
the relic for a phallic emblem. The pipe is 
3f inches in length. Litth^ difference in size 
between the individual interred in the '' lev 
elled mound" and the i»rincipal male buried in the large mound, was 
shown by the remains. The bones of the two skeletons to the south- 
east of the latter were perceptibly lighter.

INDIAN REMAINS ON THE UPPER YELLOWSTONE.* 



By Col. Wm. S. Urackett. 



If you look on almost any laiii;e maj) of Montana and Wyoming' you 
will note tbo source of the Yellowstone lvi\er near a mountain marked 
on the map as "Youth's I'eak," ami lyini;- about 2") miles southeast of 
the Yellowstone National Park. The river Hows from an immense 
snow-field on this nujuntain, In a m>rtlnvesterly direction, and empties 
into Yellowstone Lake, which lies wholly within the paik; then it 
fiows out of the lake at the lower or northern end and leapini;- down- 
ward a sheer depth of 300 feet, <>ver the Great Falls of the river, it 
rushes still northward for a hundred miles — one of the most beautiful 
streams of the Rocky Mountains. The real name of the mountain where 
the Yellowstone rises is Yount's Peak, so called after a trapper who 
lived for a long- time along- the banks of the river in the early days of 
Montana's settlenuMit. Perhaps the fine new majjs of this region uow 
being- made by the Ignited States Geological Survey will not rob 
Yount's Peak of its true name. 

About 25 uiiles north of tlic park is a widening of the valley of the 
Yellowstone, where there are a number of fine ranches, and on one ot 
them, opposite P]niig-rant Peak, where 1 am writing, there are interest- 
ing remains lett by the In<lians who lived and hunted in this now fertile 
valley as late as the year 1S7(>. 

Just above our ranch house is a uu'sa. or tal>U'laii<l, fiom whose flat 
top can be seen the grecii lichls under irrigation along tlnM'iver, and 
the loft>' mountains hemming in the valley on every side. Only ten 
years ago there wei'c no cultivated Melds in this valley, ami the elks 
and buftidocs found here their favorite feeding ground. The plain on 
this mesa is almost rectangular in shape, and at the corner, overlook- 
ing the whole region, are stone structuies that w(^ have named the 
"Lidian Forts.'' We do not know whether the Lidians, who undoubtedly 
built them, used them as foils for defending their village or camp uj) 
on the mesa, or whethei- tlie.\ w<M-e used as watchtowers foi- their sen- 
tinels. Sometimes we think tin' Indian hunters used them to ci'cep 
into and to si)y out the lai'ge game feeding among the hills ami in the 
valley below.

These forts are semicircular in form, and are built of selected square 
stcmes, piled up in a j)arapet or breastwork about four feet in height. 
They are open on the inner side of the plateau, and have space for two 
or three men to lie concealed and protected within. The forts must 
have been built many years ago because the stones are now pretty well 
covered with moss and lichens, and these do not grow as rapidly in 
this diy climate as in the Eastern States, No one is permitted to dis- 
turb these monuments of a race now almost de})arted, and I hope that 
some careful student of American archicology may hereafter explore 
this region and explain the ancient use of these so-called "Indian 
Forts." 




fhikkMiki^ii^: S0MM 



Fig. 1 The Intlian forts, Park Coimty, Montana. 

Just below ojieof the forts and at the bottom of the cliff I found, last 
summer, a buffalo skull and horns, over-grown and almost concealed by 
a wild rosebush. Perhaps the buffalo was shot by an Indian lying in 
the fort above. This made me think the forts might have been used 
for watching large game. But when you are up on the mesa you can 
easily see how well adapted the phice is to prevent surprise and for 
nnlitary defense. The sides are peri>endicular i^reci pices of volcanic 
rock. At only one ])lace can you go up on horseback; there are only 
two or three places where you can climb up on foot. On the level top 
a thousand men could be placed in camp. The forts may have been 
used, like Vt^atcditowers on the corners of a feudal castle, by the wild 
chivalry once inhabiting these m(nintains. 

About half a mile from this mesa is a little sheltered valley, back in 
tlie foothills, where the Indians used to pass the winter one of the 
l)ioneers of this region tells me. The place is sheltered from the winds 
and the snow seldom drifts there. In a level spot in this valley are 
three circles of smooth liat stones laid on the ground, each circle being- 
about 15 feet in diameter. Washed by the rains of many seasons, 
these stones are now partly imbedded in the ground. We do not know 
exactly the purpose of these water- worn rocks laid so regularly in cir- 
cles, but one of our neighbors, an "old timer" in Montana, tells us the

Iiuliaiis used theui in winter to lay around the bottom or lower edge of 
their tepees to kee]) out the cold. Most Indian te])ees are conical in 
sha])eand circular at the bottom, with a hole at the top where the poles 
meet tor the esca]je of smoke from the fire built in the center of the 
structure. In the old days, when the buffalo and other large gaim> 
were plenty, the Indians made their tepees of smoke-tauued hides. 
Now the buffaloes are entirely gone, and other large game is so scarce 
on the Indian reservations that the tei)ees are overed with cloth, gen- 
erally tliin white calico. The Indians have but few skins left and their 
calico tepees are very cold in winter.

The most interesting of the Indian remains on our lanch is at Buf- 
falo Blutt", where there is a remarkable game drive. Under the cliff, 
which is about 40 feet high, the ground is white with the splintered 
bones of large game animals that have been driven over the precipice — 
buffaloes, elks, and deer. Above is a level i)]ain stretching back for 
several miles into the foothills. The cliff is only about a hundred 
yards wide at the steep i)art where the game was driven over. How 
did they manage to make wild animals run to this narrow cliff and 
leap over? You cau see at once how this was accomplished when you 
climb to the plain above. There can be seen two long lines, composed 
of ])iles of stones, stretching out on the i)lains, each line about half a 
mile long and diverging from the edge of the cliff like the two arms

stone Leap is 2 or 3 feet in height. When tlie Indians last used 
this game drive, which was about fifteen years ago, tliey set up wooden 
stakes about 4 feet long in each stone pile. From stake to stake 
were stretched lines of stout buckskin cord, like wires on a barbed

wire fence, aud from these cords were hung at short intervals feathers, 
strips of bright cloth, and scraps of white buckskin, fluttering in the 
wind. Of course this fence could be easily broken through, but the 
frightened animals always turned back from the fluttering rags, 
feathers, and other objects hanging from the long lines of cords.

A heard of burt'alos or deer was carefully siuroimdcd by the Indian 
linnters, and then gradually driven toward the opening' of the drive, 
which was over half a mile wide. Once within these lines, the hunt- 
ers drove the herd toward the blull". waving their blankets a^i they rode 
forward. The terior-strickeu animals rushed toward the ])recii)ice, 
keeping away and turning' back in fright from tlie lines of ''fence," 
which gradually conviu'ged toward the cliff. At last, in a wild staiu- 
pede, the frantic animals were driven over tlu^ edge of tlie ])re(*ipicc, 
where those who wei'c not killed outright wei'e dis)»atched by another 
party of hunters below. Only spears and arrows were used below the 
cliff, because the lunse of lirearms would frighten back the animals 
approaching the edge of the bluff. Among the mass of crunilding 
white bones beneath this Buffalo Bluff' (as it is called here), where so 
many wild animals have been slaughtered, you can to-(hiy occasion- 
ally find spear and arrow heads, beautifully formed of shining black 
obsidian, or \'olcanic glass, the material being found in large (pianti- 
ties OM the great i>lateau of the Yellowstone National Park. 



PEIMITIVK Nl^ir.KII SYSTEM^^. 



By Lett L. Con ant, Pli. D 



Among the speculative questions w liich aiisc in conneetion with the 
study of luatheniatics from a historical standpoint tlie origin of num- 
ber is one that has i)rovoked much discussion and has led to extensive 
research among- the primitive and savage languages of the human race. 
A few simple considerations will liowever show that such research 
must necessarily leave the question entirely unsettled, and will indi- 
cate that it is, from the very nature of things, a (juestiou to wliich no 
definite, or at least no final, answer can l)e given. 

Among the barbarous tribes whose languages have been studied, 
even in a most cursory and imperfect way, none have ever been dis- 
covered which did not possess one or more words indicating familiarity 
with the number concept. Some tribes ha\e been found in which 
knowledge of luimber was so slight that the statement has been made 
that their language contained no numerals. The Chiquitas, of South 
America, for exam])le, have no word even whicli we can accept as a 
distinct substitute for "one." That numeral they express by a word 
meaning nearly the same as "alone." Here the number sense appears 
at its lowest ebb, but still it does exist; and going lower yet, one 
would be rash, indeed, if he were to assert that the higher animals 
can not distinguish between 1 and 2. Xot a few tribes have been 
found who could not count beyond two; more yet with 3, 4, or 5 as 
their number limit, while 10 marks the boundary of the numeral sys- 
tems of a very great number of the primitive races of the world. The 
assertion would seem then to be a safe one that the number sense is 
never wholly lacking. It is evident also that numerals must be among 
the earliest words to l)C formed in any language. Tluiy express ideas 
which arc- wholly concrete, which ])recede liunmn intelligence, and 
which are in many ways manifested by the higher orders of the brute 
creation. The origin of number therefore must be conceded to lie 
beyond the proper limit of in(juiry, and the i)rimitive conception of 
number to be fundamental with human thought. 

Historical inv<'stigation must begin not with nund)er itself, but with 
modes of expression of number. Herein ])r('cisely the same, manner 
as in the expression of all forms »>f thonglit, desir«% and einolion, the 
sign language ju'eceded words. We are all familiar with the manner

in wliic'li a cliild when learning to oonnt makes nse of his tingers. 
Cliihlren have for ages done the same; and the cliildreu of the human 
race, the savages of pre-historic times, unquestionably counted on their 
ten digits just as the African, the Eskimo, and the South Sea Isl- 
ander do to-day. So universal has the finger method of counting 
always been that many investigators, prominent among whom is 
Grimm, have laid it down as an axiom that all numeral Avords arise 
from names of the fingers of the hands. Savage races employ, as 
might be expected, a great variety of methods of recording their count- 
ing — as splints, pebbles, shells, kernels of grain, knots, etc. Then 
come simi)le scratches, notches cut in a stick, Robinson Crusoe fash- 
ion, and other similar devices. But back of all these, and forming a 
common origin to which all may be referred, is the universal finger 
method of counting, the method with which all begin, the method 
which is too convenient to be entirely relinquished, even by civilized 
races. 

This universal recourse to the fingers often resulted, as might be ex- 
l)ected, in the development of a more or less extended pantomime 
number system in which tlie fingers wei'e used in much the same way 
as in the deaf and dumb alphabet, though the signs actually employed 
were very difierent from those employed by unites. A system of this 
kind was much in vogue among the ancients, by means of whicli any 
number up to 10,000 could be expressed : units and tens by inflections 
of the fingers of the left hand, linndreds by siniilar inflections of the 
fingers of the right hand, and thousands by a repetition on the left 
hand of the signs used to denote units and tens. The Chinese still 
employ a finger method of expressing numbers less tlian 100,000, and 
among nearly all Eastern jjeoples a digital arithmetic of one sort or 
another is to be found. Of so common use is this sign language that 
traders are said to communicate to each other the price at which they 
are willing to buy or sell, and at the same time to conceal their otters 
from bystanders, by putting their liands under each other's cloaks and 
touching each other's fingers. 

Recent anthropological research lias developed many interesting 
facts respecting the limits to which the number systems of the various 
uncivilized races of the world extend. As a matter of course, all races 
can indicate numbers as liigli as 10, the fingers serving as a means of 
showing what they have no words to express. In nearly all cases we 
find this limit extended to 20, the second 10 being told off on the toes, 
or on the fingers of a second man. But savages have in very many 
instances no words for numbers higher than 2, 3, or 4. The Botocudos 
have no definite number beyond 1. For 2 they say "urahii", many. * 
The Puris and the Watchandis stop at 2. The former express 3 by 
''prica", many, and the latter express the same number by the combi- 
nation 2, 1. 1 The Andamans have only two numeral words, though 



* Tylor : Primitive Culture: vol. i, j). 2iH. t Ibid. 



PRIMITIVE NUMBER SYSTEMS. 585 

they oount as liigii as 10 by means of tlieir lingers. * Teu they exi)iess 
by theii- Avord for '"all." The Bushnieu have the same number limit, 
expressing- any number greater than 2 by the (Miuivalent word for 
''many." The Veddas of Ceylon count ''ekkamai,'' 1, "dekkamai," 2, 
and then continue by repeating again and again tlie word "otameekai," 
meaning '';ind one niore."t 

Numerous as are the instances in which two stan<ls as the number 
limit for savage tribes, three is thus used still more frequently. The 
New Hollanders have no names for numbers greater than tliree.^ The 
low forest tribes of Brazil comiuonly express any number greater than 
three by their equivalent for "w/^n<</."§ The Australians of Herbert 
River do the same.|| The Fuegans are supposed to have counted for- 
merly to ten, but at the present time tlieir entire number system is com- 
prised in the tiiree words : "kaoncli,'" 1; "compaipi,"' 1'; "maten,"3.** 
TheCampas, of Peru, count: "patrio,"!; "pittem," 2; '^mahuimi," 3. 
Beyond this they can express no number except by some such expres- 
sions as 1 and •>, I nnd 1 and 3, etc., showing the total indicated by hold- 
ing up the i)r()per number of Angers. As a definite number anything 
beyond ten is to them inconceivable, and tliey refer to it as "to haiue," 
"many.-'tt The Australian tribe of the Wiraduroi have no numerals 
which enable them to count beyond 3. With them four is "many," and 
five "very many." Almost exactly the same statement may be made of 
the Dip]>il, the Kamilaroi, the Adelaide, the Turrubnl, the West Aus- 
tralia, the Encounter Bay, the New South Wales, and the Tasmania 
tribes.i:| Some of these indicate four by expressions such as "two-two," 
or "two i)air," and live by '• two-three," or " two-two-one." The Encoun- 
ter Bay tribe nses an analogous reduplication for six even, saying 
"kuko-kuko-kuko," that is, "two- two-two." The Yaucos, of the Ama- 
zon, express the mimber three by tlie astounding word " poettarraror- 
incoaroac," at which La ( 'ondemaine duly remarks : §§ "Happily for those 
who have dealings with them, their arithmetic goes no further." 

The general limitation of the number sense existing among the low 
races of the world now begins to become apparent. Specific words exist 
for one, two, three, etc., and beyond that anything is " numy." The en- 
tire number system of a tribe may be ''one," " many," or it may be " one, 
two, many." More numerous yet are the cases when^ the counting goes 
one step farther, and gives "one, two, three, many," as the s<'.ale througii 
wiiicli th''. savages' number sense can conduct him. In the same way

58G PRIMITIVE NUMBER SYSTEMS. 

we might expect to find the cases where counting stops with four more 
numerals than those where three is the iiiuit, just as three is a much 
more common limit than two. Such is not the case, however. Investi- 
gation shows that if counting extends beyond three, it is almost sure to 
reach five, the commonest limit among races whose number sense is very 
weak. A few instances have been found where tribal numerals extend 
to four without going beyond that point. The Tupis, of South America, 
have only the four numerals "oyepe,"!; "mokoi," 2; ^'mosapira," o, and 
"erundi," 4.* The Australians, of Lake Macquery, have no numeral 
beyond ''woran," 4, except the indefinite expression "kanwol-kanwol," 
which signifies " great-great. ''t The Tasmanians also have tour as their 
proper number limit, but they have a compound expression, "pagan-a- 
mara," 4 + 1, which they use for five,| A few other instances of the 
same limit are given by various authors, but tliey must be received with 
great caution. If a savage can count to four lie is practically certain 
to extend his system one step further, and to make his scale contain 
the number of steps which corresponds to the number of fingers on one 
of his hands. 

This brings us again to the consideration of the relation existing 
between the hand and its fingers, and primitive counting. Three com- 
mon number limits are found among savage races, 5, 10, and 100. A 
savage counts on his fingers until he reaches 5, and then he often 
stops, saying merely "'many," for any greater number. With a slightly 
higher degree of intelligence, or with an environment calling for more 
extended use of the number sense, others go on from this point, 
counting now on the fingers of the other hand. As a number limit 10 
is used almost as commonly as 5; and it is no infrequent thing to find 
the toes as well as the fingers made to do duty as counters, thus 
bringing the total up to 20. The last named number is rarely the limit, 
however. If a savage can count to 20 he is usually able to go on to 100, 
and often to 1,000. 

The manner of counting just indicated has given rise to a peculiarity 
in the names of certain numerals which must not pass unnoticed. 
Counting as he does, the savage, on reaching 5 says, not unnaturally, 
'' one hand." At 10 he says, following the same anology, "both hands." 
At 20, having completed the tale of counters which ^Nature has placed 
at his disposal, he says, "one man." Though by no means universal, 
these names for 5, 10, and 20 are so common in all parts of the world 
that specific examples of them need not be given. We also find 0, 7, 
etc., often expressed by "hand one," ''hand two," or "one on the 
other hand," " two on the other hand," etc.; and 11, 12, etc., by "one 
on the foot," " two on the foot," etc. So frequently are these equiva-

lents found that they are recojiiiized by competent aiitliority as under- 
lying- one of the most common of the methods of numeral formation.* 

Tn a (ionsideration of the subject of primitive number one thought 
must be kei)t prominently in mind. Savage races may have numerals 
hy means of which they count to 5, 10,20, 100, or even 1,000, beyond 
which they rarely venture. I>ut it by no means follows that, after 
passing" beyond the very smallest, they have any exact notions of the 
numbers they are using. As long as they can check off on the fingers, 
or by meansof i)ebbles, sticks or shells, they und<mbtedly have a fairly 
distinct idea of the totals they name. But want of familiarity with 
the use of numl)ers, and lack of any convenient means of comparison, 
nnist rt^sult in extreme indeliniteness of mental conception, and must, 
when recourse can not l>e hjid to counters of some kiml, inevitably 
give rise to great vagueness in the use of numbers. This has been 
noted and commented on by many observers, Hund)oldt among them, 
who remarks t that he never met an Indian who on being asked his 
age would not answer indiiferently 10 or UO. 

The statement has been made above that tiu', numbei' systems of 
savage races rarely, if ever, extend beyond 1,000. A single observa- 
tion respecting the development of the systems of civilized races may 
not here be out of place as showing of how universal api)lication is this 
statement. The number systems of tlie civilized world to-day are of 
unlimited «^xtent. But we need go back but a few centuries to tind a 
time when our owil systems were as diminutive as are those to which 
reference has just been made. Although in response to the demands 
of crmimerce and science our English system has been brought to its 
l)resent elastic condition, the evidence of language shows conclusively 
that our Teut(mic ancestors stopped at the same limit that has been 
named as the maxinmm for ?avage tribes. The higher numeral words 
of our language, million, hillion^ frill ion, etc., are all borrowed words; 
while the word thousand is pure Saxon, like the words one, two, three, 
ten, hundred, etc. The German, the Scandinavian ami other languages 
have borrowed their higher numeral words, and the same statement 
is probably true of the French. Other languages, like tlie (Chinese, 
Sanskrit, Aztec, etc., contain only native numeral words; but however 
higli these systems may be found to extend, there can be no doubt that 
they were at one time limited to a single tliousand, and perhaps less. 
In this connection it is instructive to obserAC the number limits of tlie 
half civilized nations of the ]n'esent day. The tribes of Arabia, the 
Persians, the Abyssinians, and most of theXorth Al'rican peoi>les imve 
number .systems terminating with eleph or alph (1,000). Tlie Lapland- 
ers and the Erse have no words higher than zhioette and <-iad, respec- 
tively, each of these words signifying 100. In ancient times the Latins 
were content with mille (1,000), and the Greeks with /j.np'.a- (10,000), as 
their number limits, and the Malays of to-day with ribou, also meaning

1,000. Ill general it may be said that in the childhood of any race the 
unniber concept is weak and the number system is correspondingly 
limited. As civilization develops tlie number sense and the number 
system are extended accordingly. To this law some remarkable ex- 
ceptions have been noted, but they are exceptions and do not in the 
least invalidate the rule. 

Respecting the bases used in the number systems of the various lan- 
guages of the world, no full and comparative account has ever appeared 
in Kngiish. From the earliest times in which arithmetic began to assume 
the dignity of a science and its history to receive serious attention, it has 
been handed down as a tradition, the truth of which was never ques- 
tioned until recently, that all races throughout the world used in their 
computation the decimal system. Aristotle indeed nienticnied one ob- 
scure Thracian tribe Avhich was said to reckon with a different base, but 
he seems to have regarded this solitary instance as the exception which 
proved the rule, for he taught that the universality of the decimal sys- 
tem ijroved it to have had its origin in nature. This tradition was for 
centuries accepted as true without question, and the naturalness of the 
decimal system was argued from the fact that the number of counters, 
the fingers, with which nature had equipped man, was ten. IJut the 
last three or four centuries have brought to the knowledge of civiliza- 
tion a multitude of tribes hitherto unknown, and among them a very 
great number have been found to use systems having some base other 
than 10. It was also pointed out by Peacock* and others that 10 was 
not the only natura Inumber base — that, as 5 was the number of fingers 
on one hand, and as liO was the numbei- of fingers and toes combined, 
either 5 or 20 constituted a base in all respects as natural as 10. Hence 
the use by any race of either of tliese numbers for that purpose could 
constitute no ground for surprise. Peacock indeed mentions many ex- 
amples of Indian, negro, and Mongolian tribes, among whom such bases 
are actually used, and his list can now be enormously increased, so great 
has been the energy and activity displayed in anthropological research 
during the last half century. That 10 has been, and is, the practically 
universal base of the world's number systems is indisputably true, but 
to this general law the list of exceptions has been found to be so great 
that a brief consideration of the subject seems desirable. 

Of all the numbers capable of use as a system base, 12 presents the 
greatest number of practical advantages. We have, through the 
familiarity which custom has produced, become so accustomed to the 
use of 10 in that capacity that the assertion just made seems unwar- 
rantable. But a moment's reflection will show that the ten fingers of 
the human species have entailed upon ns a number base decidedly 
inferior to 12. In the sim})le ])usiness affairs of life we deal most 
extensively with the three simple, familiar fractions, ^V, i, and 4, and 
the auxiliary fractions | and ^. Such being the case it needs no argu-

to the mass of mankind an enormous advaiitajic over 10 or any other 
small number as a base for eom])utation. With the growth of business 
in its many forms, the civilized world has lon<>' since come to recognize 
this faet, and in many ways to nuike practical nse of it. The word 
''dozen/' and its equivalent in other languages, has been coined as a 
noun to express the number 11*, and in a very great number of tlie 
eommercial transactions of the world the dozen and its s(piar(', the 
gross, are the common units of measui'e. So pali)able are the advan- 
tages of 12 from this ])oint of view that some writers have gone so tar 
as to advocate the entir<' abolition of the decimal system and the sub- 
stitution of a duodecimal system in its place. ( -harles Xlf, of Sweden, 
may be mentioned as an espeeially zealous advocate of this change, 
which lu' is said to have had in actual contem])lation for his own 
dominions at the time of his death. The adoi)tion of the duodecinuil 
notation would involve the introduction of two new symbols, for 10 and 
11, respectively. Twelve would then be represented by 10, thirteen by 
11, fourteen by 1-5, twenty-four l»y 20, one hundred ami forty-four by 
100, etc. No such change can ever meet with general favor, so lirndy 
has the deciuial scale become intrenched; but it is more than ])r()bable 
that the Avorld of trade and commerce will continue to use the dozen, 
its fractions and its multii)les in many of its transactions in the future, 
as it has for centuries in the past. It was thus used l>y the Jlomans, 
and it has been and is used among all TcMitoiiic nations at the picsent 
day. It is more than probable that the English divisions of weights, 
measures, and money were intluence<l by the ease with which mental 
com])iitation is effected when fractional i)arts of 12 are involve<l. The 
duodecimal is not a natural seale in the same sense as are the decimal, 
the (piinary and the vigesimal; but it is a system which is brought 
into use at a later day and at a higher stage of development, solely 
through its convenience when ai)plied to the everyday transactions of 
business life. IIund)oldt, in discussing the nund)er s\stems of the 
various peoi)les he had ^■isited in his travels, remarked Ihat no people 
had ever used exclusi\el\' that best of bases, 12. A possible exception 
to this has siiu^e Humboldt's time been noted by IJobert Flegid, in the 
Aphosof Eenui', who count by simple woids to 12, an<l then ])r()ceed 
with 12 and 1. 12 and 2, 12 and .'>, etc.*

in our own laugiiage we fliid an occasioual hint of the same thing in 
tlie words ''pair," •'l)ra(*e,'' '•coui)le," etc; obscure traces of a binary 
uuniber system api)ear on some of the early Chinese monuments, but 
w'C have no real evidence that such a system was ever definitely and 
exckisively used by the Chinese. Certain savage tribes, however, 
count exclusively or in part by twos. The Baccaraaibi, n, South 
American tribe of the Xingn region, count only to 0. But they call 4, 
2 and 2, 5, 2 and 2 and 1, and (>, 2 and 2 and 2. The least developed 
of the Australian tribes are in many cases found to reckon in the same 
way.* The structure of the Arikara numerals would indicate that this 
people counted at first exclusively by pairs, the odd numbers being in- 
terpolated afterwards.! The lowest of the native tribes of the East 
Indian Archipelago count upon a binary scale, if indeed they can prop- 
erly be said to use any.f Examples of this kind might be multiplied 
to a very considerable extent. But it should not be overlooked that 
these are hardly to be considered as tair examples of the use of cuiy 
system. The tribes mentioned have no form of noration other than re- 
peating scratches or piling pebbles: and their numeration is of the 
rudest kind. All that can be said is that, as far as any system is used 
among them, that system is the binary. Making the same (jualifica- 
tion, we may note that the Cuchaus of Colorado count Avith a mixed 
ternary and quaternary scale, expressing by the phrase "2 3's," 9 
by "3 3's," and S by '"2 4's;"§ and that the Lulos of South America, 
the Triton Bay and the Ende Polynesians count with a quaternary 
scale, expressing numbers as far as 4 by simple words, and then 
counting 4-1, 4-2, et<'. The last-named tribe gives a further indication 
of the use of the quaternary scale by using for 8 a word signifying 
"2 4"s.'''|| Occasionally we come, in the midst of some other well-de- 
fined system, upon sporadic traces of reckoning upon 4, 6, 8, or 9 as a 
base. The Wallachians, for example, say "den-maw," 2-9 for 18. The 
Bretagnes call 18 "trionche," 3-G. But otherwise these languages 
contain no trace of the senary or octonary scales. Pott states** that 
the Bolans of West Africa appear to use 6 as their number base; but 
aside from this solitary instance we know of no tribe w^hich employs 0, 
7, 8, or 9 for that purpose. The most remarkable example of tribal ec- 
centricity in this particular is that of the Maoris, of New Zealand, 
whose number base is 11. To that number they count by means of 
simple words; 12, 13, 14, etc., are with them 11-1, 11-2, 11-3, etc.; the 
multiples of 11, as 22 and 33, are formed directly on the word for 11; 
and the square and cube of 11, or 121 and 1331, are expressed by

trace of a base, the numhers, as lar as tliey extend, beiii<i' iiidepeiKleut 
of each other. Such cases are, liowexcr, necessarily rare. 

The only remaining example that need l)e mentioned of the use of 
an unusual iiuudjci' as the base of a system, is the Babylonians. As 
is well known, the base of their number system was (JO, the largest 
nund)er ever used for such a purpose. To the modern world, the fact 
that the Babylonians nse<l GO as their unit of reckonini;- is most im 
portant, for that fact has entailed upon us a sexagesimal system of 
astronomical com[)utation, 

^Vith the exception of a small number of isolated cases, such as 
those mentioned above, it may be laid down as a universal law that 
every language containing a number system extemling beyond 5 
reveals the use of one of tlie three numbers, o, 10, or 20, as the base of 
that system. Each of three numbers reipiires extended mention. 

One of the most niteresting j)oints to be met with in connection 
with the study of numeral words, is the resemblam-e found to exist 
in nuiny languages between thB words for ''hand'' and "'live.'' Count 
ing as they do, by means of their tiugers, savage races naturally use 
for tiA'e some expressicm like "one hand," or -'a hand linislied," or 
simply "'hand." Then, ])roceeding with their count, they begin to 
build on this as a base, using for ('», 7, S, etc., the ex])ressions, "hand 
one," "hand two,"' "hand three," et<-. In such a system, 10 is, of 
C(mrse. "two hands.*' Counting above 10, we find tMo common meth 
ods ])iactised. The tbigers being finished by the count uj) to 10, re- 
course may be liad either to the toes or to the fingers of a second man. 
In the former ease, 11 would be "one on the foot." Twenty, complet- 
ing the tale of l)oth lingers and toes, is called '-one man." ik'yond 
this i)oint there is less uniformity in the metluxl of counting than be- 
fore, ])iit examples are numerous of tribes which use exactly this 
method up to 100, calling 40, (50, so, and 100, '-two men," '-three men," 
"four men," and "five men," resi)ectively. Ibit, as will l)c noted later, 
the use of the pure (piinary scale above L'O is rarely il' ever found. 
A\'ith ti'ibes having a limited ninnl)er sense, !iowe\'er, tribes whosesys- 
tem.'< do not extend Ix'yoiid 10 or 15 or 20, this scale is almost as com- 
mon as the decinuil. The naturalness of this scale is \ cry evident, 
and, as compan'd with the decimal, the wonder is, not thai I lie (luinaiy 
scale is s(» very common, but rather that it is not more comnion than 
the decimal. The reason for this will apjx-ar when we come to con- 
sider the latter. 

lOxamples of the use of the (punary scale :\n- conunoii in all parts of 
the world.* it is the scale of many of the nati\ e North Siberian tribes, 
of the Aleuts, the Kamtschatkans, and at least three of the tribes of 
the New Hebrides. In Africa we note tlu^ Wolofs and Sbillorns,

Eifiks, and two tribes visited by Stanley; the Ki yaiis and tlie Ki- 
Nyassas.* These and a nnmber of otliers nse practically a pure quinary 
scale. The Dinkas, the Fulbes, the Pi<;inies,t and otliers use a mixed 
quinary and decimal scale, while the ISTupes and one or two other tribes 
employ a quinary vigesimal system. Among the Australasians and 
Polynesian islands abundant traces are found of quinary number sys- 
tems, but they are in almost all cases nothing more than traces. 
Throughout that i)art of the world the <iuinary system has been suy)er- 
seded by the decimal. This has been widely spread through the islands 
of the Pacific and Indian Oceans by the Malays, who in turn obtained 
it from the Hindus. But the home i^ar excellence of the quinary, or 
rather of the quinary vigesimal scale, is America. It is practically 
universal among the Eskimo tribes of the Arctic regions. It jtrevailed 
among a considerable portion of the North American Indian tribes, and 
Avas almost universal with the native races of Central and South Amer 
ica. So numerous are the examples which might be given, that mention 
will be made rather of the exceptions, that is, of those using the decimal 
base. It is interesting to note also that a considerable number of lan- 
guages show that the quinary system was once in use among pet)ples 
which, with the development of civilization, discarded that system for 
the decimal. The Greeks of Homer's time used a system in which 
traces of the quinary base are observable. The common lloman nota- 
tion shows clearly that the ancient Komans made at least a limited use 
of the same base, as did also the Persians. 

The exclusive use of 5 as a number base is never tbund in any sys- 
tem of any considerable extent. Whenever the ([uinary system is ex 
tended beyond the narrowest limits it invariably runs into either tlie 
decimal or the vigesimal. Touching- this point Ilankel says It that no 
race, even though it began its number system on the quinary base, ever 
expressed 10 by 5-2 or 2-5, but always by a simple word ; and hence that 
the system passes immediately into the decimal. This statement is 
only partially correct. The quinary in many instances runs into the 
vigesimal, no trace whatever of a decimal base appearing. Further 
more, even though 10 is never expressed by 5-2 or 2-5, it is often ex 
pressed by "two hands" or "both hands." Mungo Park observed tliis 
among the Yolofs and Foulkas of Africa; Humboldt and others among 
the Omaguas, the Zarmiscas, the Tainanacs, the Tonpmambos, and 
many more of the South American tribes; and Russian explorers 
found the same method common among the native Siberian races. 
Hence the statement as the (lerman historian makes it needs imjior 
tant qualification. 

Vigesimal-number systems are less common than quinary, but as 
the two are so persistently interwoven together it is difficult to sepa- 
rate them from each other, llie use of a base as large as 20 must 
necessarily be cumbersome, and it can constitute no ground for sur

prise that either 5 or 10 should in jieiieial be jnefeiTed for th;it purpose. 
It i.s a matter of some surprise, however, that the quinary should in so 
many cases merge into the vigesiuial rather than the decimal system. 

The vigesimal system is never found entirely pure. Examination 
always sliows some trace either of the quinary or the decimal system 
subordinate to it. Among tlu' native races of Anu^rica it is almost as 
common as the quinary and is more common than the decimal, l)ut it 
is there always found mixed with either the one or the other. The 
same commingling is ob.serve<l among Asiatic and Afric^an tribes. The 
elaborate Aztec system is the most i)erfect known example of the vig- 
esimal-number system, but it contained both the (piinary and the deci- 
mal scales subordinate to the vigesimal. The Muyscas of Bogota 
possessed an exceedingly elaborate and extended vigesimal system, but 
the decinml is used to supi>lenient it. The same is true of the Bas- 
ques of northern Spain. 

For some unexplained reason vigesimal-number systems are lare in 
the Old World. The only European example I am able t(> cite is tlie 
Bas(]ue system. The Ainus of northern Siberia reckon by twenties, 
and a number of the tribes of the Caucasus do tlie sanie. Tn Africa 
this mode of counting is almost unknown, only two or three examples 
of it being on record. It is oidy in America that vigesimal-number 
systems have flourished and h<dd their own. But it is a noteworthy 
fact that in ancient times 20 was the number base used in many ])arts 
of Europe, as is attested by abundant traces in the modern European 
languages. The lMi(enicians, and presumably the Carthagenians, also 
used this method of reckoning, and thnuigh contact with them the 
Celtic nations of western Europe gradually became familiarized with 
it. From using it in commercial intercourse with these traders from 
the Mediterranean they may have adopted it as their own scale. Cer- 
tain it is that the vigesimal-number system was a, strongly marked 
characteristic of all the Celtic i-aces, as their languages uneciui vocally 
prove. The liretons still say " unnek ha tringeut,"' 11 and ."> liO's, for 
71. The French say "(juatre vignt" for 80, and from that ]»oint to 100 
count u])on a ])ure vigesimal scale, as far as the names of their nund)ers 
are coiu'crned. The Welsh, the Erse, the Giclic, the Manx, and other 
Celtic races sliow in their languages similar traces of a forinei' use of 
the vigesimal base. Singularly (Miough. like traces ar<> to some slight 
extent found among Teutonic languages also, ])ut they are so infrequent 
as to indicate but little and to prove nothing. A hundred consisting 
of 120, and known as ''the great hundred" or " long hundred, " was 
formerly in use in England, and was legal for eggs, spars, an<l certain 
other articles. That this was a common use would appear troni the 
poi)ular old distich (pioted by Peacock:* 

Five score of men, iiioijcn. .'iikI pins, 
Six score of all other thinjrs.

594 PRIMITIVE NUMBER SYSTEMS. 

The very word '• score," and one or two happily i:>reserved expres- 
sions, as "three score and ten," show that an unconscious flavor of the 
vigesimal scale was to be found in the England of a few centuries ago. 
The Danish and other Tentonic languages contain words and expres- 
sions which indicate that the same was true of other north European 
countries. Bnt here the reckoning by 20's seems always to have been 
restricted to material objects rather than applied to pure number; so 
that the Teutonic number systems can not be said ever to have been 
vigesimal systems. Ancient Palmyra possessed a number system of 
great extent which was almost purely vigesimal. But scanty traces of 
it remain however. 

We have last of all to consider the decimal scale. However great 
the number of examples that may be given of races that have used 
or now use the quinary or the vigesimal scale, the fact remains that 
by far the greatest number of uncivilized people perform their reckon- 
ing by tens; and that, with five or six exceptions, all civilized peoples 
have done the same. The decimal scale is universal in Europe; in 
Africa it is almost universal ; in Polynesia the same is true; in Asia 
all civilized peoples and the great majority of the uncivilized tribes 
count with this base; in Korth America it is used by the greater num- 
ber of the Indian tribes; and in South America it is sometimes found, 
though the prevailing base is quinary or quinary-vigesimal. The sim- 
ple and undoubtedly the correct explanation of the origin of this sys- 
tem is the laying aside of the counter, or the scoring of one mark on 
the completion of each tale of 10 on the lingers. This develops into a 
perfect decimal system, and needs only the device of characters for the 
representation of number to become a written number system like the 
Eoman; or with value of place like the Arabic system of the present 
day. That it is jireferable to either the ({uinary or the vigesimal scale 
is a fair inference to be deduced from the numerous instances in which 
it has superseded the one or the other. As a number base 5 is too 
small and 20 is too large. Probably no single-number scale would 
serve the ueeds of mankind better than the decimal with the single ex- 
ception of the duodecimal. P)Ut the advantages of 12 as a base never be- 
come apparent until the arithmetic of a people has reached a degree of 
development such that a change in the scale used would be attended 
with difficulties so great as to render such a thing altogether impracti- 
cable. Civilization is a[)parently wedded to the decimal system; and 
though it may continue to barter by 12's and to perlbrm its astronomi- 
cal computations by (JO's, it Avill always continue to use the arithmetic 
of lO's in preference to any other. It seems probable also that the deci- 
mal scale, already in use among all civilized nations and among the 
native races of so large a portion of the world, will tend more and 
more to displace the quinary and the vigesimal scales, and to become at 
last in reality what it was in the minds of the ancients, the universal 
number scale (,»f the world.

l>y '•aiitlu'opolojiy oftlu' brain" we niideistaiul several distinct, bnt 
closely related, sciences, viz, tlie anatomy of the brain, its i)hysiology, 
])sycliology, ethnology, etc. 

In the short s])ace at my disposal it will 1k» impossible to do anything 
more than brietly mention the more important facts bearing u})on this 
interesting snbject. 

We will refer brietly, in the iirst ])lace, to tiic more salient featnres 
of the anatomy of the brain. 

This complex viscns may be- looked upon as a hollow bag, with sev- 
eral constrictions at ditterent places, whose wall is trilaminar, the inner- 
most layer of which is named epeudyma. the middle one the nerve tissue, 
and the external layer the pia mater. 

Tiie inner (ependyma) and outer (pia. mater) layers are (juite thin, and 
may be said to maintain a uniform thickness; but the middle (nerve- 
tissue) layer possesses very varying degrees of thickness at diflerent 
points in the Avail of this hollow bag — the brain. 

The nerve tissuelayer may be very thick at some ])laces. and it may 
be entirely absentiat other ]»oints. In this latter case the integrity of 
the cavity oftlu'.brain is maintained by'the ependyma and ])ia mater 
coming in contact, this.bilaminar portion of the brain wall taking the 
general nameof velum. 

In oi'drr to give you. a necessary outline, idea of the anatomy mT th<' 
brain, it will be best to refer rai)idly, but su(;cinctly, to the more salient 
features of the embryology of the brain. At an early stage of ]>re-

forward, backward, aud downward, aud more or less completely liides 
iroiii view the remaining- and, morphologically considered, more funda- 
mental segments. This great increase in size of the prosencephalon is 
due to the tremendous growth of its middle layer — the nerve-tissue 
layer. 

The cavity of the prosencephalon is called the i)rosencephalic cavity 
(lateral ventricles of adult human anatomy); that of the thalamen- 
cephalon, the thalamencephalic cavity (third ventricle of human anat- 
omy), the point of communication between the two cavities being- known 
as the foramen of Monroe. 

The cavity of the mesencephalon is called mesencephalic cavity (syl 
vian passage, or iter a tcrtio ad qtiartum ventriculum of human anat- 
omy). 

The cavity of the epencephalou is known as epencephalic cavity 
(pre-axial half of the fourth ventricle) ; that of the meteucephalon is the 
metencephalic cavity (pust-axial half of the fourth ventricle). 

The "fourth ventricle'' thus becomes a cavity common to two seg- 
ments of the brain. 

Along the "Hoor'' of the i)rosencephalic cavity (lateral ventricle), in 
the form of a double horse-shoe, is a portion of the brain wall in which 
the middle (nerve-tissue) layer is wanting. At this place the epen- 
dyma aiul ])ia mater come in contact, forming the prosencephalic velum 
(erroneously called, inhuman anatomy, "transverse lissure"), by which 
the integrity of the encephalic cavity, at thisi)lace, is preserved. 

Likewise there is a thalamencephalic velum (velum interpositum of 
human anatomy) in the "roof" of the thalanieucephalon : a metencei)h- 
alic velum in the "roof" (dorsal surface) of the nietencephalou. In the 
latter velum is found tbe foramen of Magendie, the opening by which 
the cerebro-spinal fluid in thC' encephalic cavities communicates with 
that in spaces on the outside- of the pia mater known as sub-arach 
noidian spaces. 

The nerve tissue-of the prosencephalon (cerebrum) consists of "inner" 
or "white matter" and "outer" or "gray matter," the individual ele- 
ments of which are bound together by a tissue called neuroglia. The 
gray matter, otherwise called cortex, is about 3 mdlimeters in thick- 
ness. Thecerebrum has numerous fissures aud convolutions on its 
surface — these for the purpose of increasing the area of gray matter 
without unduly augmenting the bulk of the brain. The sui^erticial area 
of the cortex is about 200,000 square millimeters. 

Two of the most important fissures of the brain are the fissure of 
Rolando and the fissure of Sylvius. In relation with the former fis- 
sure are found the great "motor areas" of the brain, and in relation 
with the "forking" of the latter is " Broca's center "' (the center for 
speech). 

In the adult the cerebrum is the largest portion of the brain. The 
I oxt largest portion of this viscus is the^cerebellum, which constitutes 
the great bulk of the epencephalou. • 



THE ANTHROPOLOGY OF THE BRAIX. 597 

III tlic brief space at my disposal 1 can bnt iiientioii two oftlic j;rcut 
l)liysioloiii('al processes (•oiinect<Ml witli tlie brain. Proba])ly two of the 
most eonspiciious activities of a human bein<;' are tliose of intellection 
and locomotion; and, in consonance with this fact, we find the two por- 
tions of the brain [(residing:: over these functions, the most conspicuous 
and bulky sej;ments of it. The cerebrum is the physical basis of intel- 
leetual processes and the c(M'ebellum of locomotion, in that the latter 
is the great coordinating (*enter of the brain. 

Whether we extend our studies along the lines of phylogeny or 
ontogeny, we will ol)serve that the rule is very general, almost uni\-er- 
sal, that those animals having the largest cerebra ])ossess the gi'eatest 
degree of intelligence, and those with the largest cerebella are capable 
of the most varie<l and complii'ated motions. 

From an ethnological standpoint the size and weight of the human 
brain are facts of great interest and importance. 

The size and weight of the brain are capable of Ix'ing estimated by 
two methods, viz, the direct and indirect. The direct method is to 
weigh the brain when it is accessible. The indirect is to ascertain the 
cubical capacity of the cranium, and tluMi deduce the weighty of the 
brain that once oc(;upied it. This latter method is ]>articularly ajtpli- 
cable iu the study of the brains of ancient i)eoples, the skulls of which 
have been preserved to this time. The a\'erage weight of the human 
male adult brain is 1,390 grams. That of the female is 1,250 grams. 

The average cranial capacity of any race can only be determined by 
careful examinati(m of a huge number of skulls classitied according to 
sex; for sex exercises a most potent intiu<mce over cranial cai)acity, 
often exceeding the difference of race. 

The following are some of the principal modifying conditions which 
influence cranial capacity and thence biain weight, viz, age, weight of 
body, stature, sex, race, vigor of intellect, and education. 

The earlier anatomists believed that the human brain attained its 
maxinuim development at 7 years of age. We now know that this is 
incorrect; yet from extensive researches it has been found that the 
male brain does actually reach live-sixths of its ultimate weight by 
the* end of the scNcnth year, and in the female ten-elcxcnths its ulti- 
mate weight at tht^ cud of the same jH'iiod. 

The a\erage weight of the brain nndergoes a [)rogi'cssive increase up 
to a ]>oint between tlu^ twentieth and fortieth years. Tiie gi-eatest ave- 
rage weight fdi- the male bi'am is reached at from '.'A) to 10 years. 
Women icach tlie lull average l)rain weight fiom tin- twentieth to the 
thirtieth yeai'. 

There is a slight diminution in weight from 10 to 50 years of age, 
and a still greater <liminution from 50 to <»0 years. The rate of 
decrease is much greater after (JO years. In tlie eightieth year the 
brain weight has <lecreased by from 80 to 00 grams. "'In the aged, 
brain weight and intelligence doAtvesbi^e pari passu " (Thiirnam). 



598 THE ANTHROPOLOGY OF THE BRAIN. 

It has been truly said that there are many exceptions to this general 
law, especially among people of culture and learning, "who often pre- 
serve to extreme old age all the fullness and vigor of their faculties. 

"The brain of such men, as the late Prof. Gratiolet observes, 
remains in a state of i)erpetual youth, and loses little or none of the 
weight which belonged to it in the prime of life" (Thurnam). The ratio 
of brain weight to body weight varies. In lean persons the ratio is 
often as 1:22 to 27; in stout i)ersons as 1:50 to 100. The human brain 
is smaller in comi)arison with the body the nearer man approaches to 
Ms full growth. 

As to stature, the weight of the brain, in both sexes, is relatively 
smaller in short persons than in tall ones. The difference between the 
two is about 5 per cent, /. e., the brain of a num of short stature being 
represented by 95, that of a tall man would be 100. 

The average weight of the adult male brain is about 10 per cent 
greater than that of the female. N^or is this difference due to the 
difference in stature of the sexes. The difference, as was shown by 
M. Parchappe, is greater than can be accounted for in this way. 
While the stature of woman is only S per cent less than that of man, 
her brain weight is 10 per cent less. 

In relation to this question of the difference of cranial capacity due 
to sex, it is very interesting to note the remarkable fact, pointed out 
by \^ogt, that the difference increases in favor of tlie male as the de- 
velopment of the race proceeds, so that the male European excels 
mucli more the fenmle than the negro the negress. 

In the words of V'ogt, " The lower the state of culture, the more 
similar are the occupations of the two sexes. Among the Australians, 
the Bushmen, and other low races, possessing no fixed habitations, the 
wife partakes of all her husband's toils, and has, in addition, the care 
of the progeny. The sphere of occupation is the same for both sexes; 
whilst among civilized nations there is a division both in physical and 
mental labor. If it be true that every organ is strengthened by exer- 
cise, increasing in size and weight, it must ecjually apply to the brain, 
which must become more developed by proper mental exercise." 

Le Bon has pointed out that the difference existing between the 
cranial capacities of the male and fenuile modern Parisians is almost 
double that whicli obtains between the ci'anial capacities of the male 
and female inhabitants of an(dent Egypt. These facts show the inti- 
mate, and mutually reacting, relations of civilization and brain weight; 
advancing civilization leading to increased development of the brain, 
and the enlarged brain making the people capable of higher and 
broader culture. 

The avei-age brain weight in diff'erent races of men has mostly been 
studied by the indirect method, /. e., by the investigation of cranial 
capacities. Skulls having a cranial capacity of 1350-1450 cubic centi 
meters are classed as mesocephalic; those under 1350 cubic centimeters

The above-named men have been among the Ibrcmost representatives 
of human intelligence. 

The list is very interesting, not only from the fact that it includes 
some very higii brain weights (which we would naturally exi)ect from 
their high intellectual attainments), but also from the fact that it in- 
cludes brain weights of four distinguished men which fall distinctly 
below the average (1390 grains), even when allowance is made for 
atro})hy consecjuent ui)on age. 

These facts, and many others that <;an be nuuitioned, naturally raise 
the question, "Is there any invariable connection between intelligence 
and mere weight <u- size of brain T' IJehu^e answering this question 
we desire to cite a few additional facts. 

Very high brain Aveights are not only tbiind among men of great in- 
tellectual attainments and culture, as noted in the above table, but 
also among \'ery ordinary sane individuals and among eijilejttics and 
insane persons. Dr. Biicknill records a brain weight of 1830 grams for 



600 THE ANTHROPOLOGY OF THE BRAIN. 

a male epileptic. This was the brain weij;ht, it will be observed, of the 
celebrated Cuvier. 

Dr. Spae records the heaviest female brain weight on record that I 
can find. The patient Avas not ei)ileptic bnt '• labored under a mono- 
mania of pride," dying at the age of 30. The brain had, for a female, 
the astonnding weight of 1743 grams. 

The heaviest human brain on record, as far as I have been al)le to 
ascertain, belonged to a man who was perfectly sane and healthy, but 
of very ordinary mental attainments. The man from whom it was 
taken was 38 years of age, a bricklayer, and died from blood poisoning, 
alter a surgical operation, in a London Hospital in 1840. Dr. James 
Norris says of this brain: 

"The weight of the brain, taken immediately on removal, exceeded 
1945 grains. This weighing was most carefully made, and was wit- 
nessed by several students. The brain was well proportioned; the 
convolutions were not flattened, though the surface was fairly moist; 
it only lost about 32 grains weight after the usual dissection and drain 
ing for two hours. The man's height was 5 feet 9 inches, and he was 
of a robust frame. It was difficult to obtain any satisfactory history 
of him — his wife and his landlady gave difl'erent accounts. It seemed, 
however, that he was a native of Sussex, England; that he had left 
his native village aiul changed his name on account of some poaching 
troubles; that he was not very sober; had a good memory and was fond 
of politics. He could neither read nor write." - - - 

How are these facts to be leconciled with one another? In this way. 
It is now universally held that it is the gray nerve tissue in the front 
l)ortion of the cerebral liemi-si>heres (prosencephalon) that has to do, 
more particularly, with the intellectual activities, the white nerve tis- 
sue consisting, essentially, of nerve threads that conduct impulses to 
and from the gray matter. The nerve elements, as stated above, are 
bound together and held in place by a form of connective tissue called 
neuroglia. The neuroglia has no connection, whatever, with the gener- 
ation or conduction of nerve impulses — it is merely a supporting tissue. 
If this tissue, in consequence of disease, increases much in ({uantity it 
jnay add very much to the weight of the brain — as occurs iu epileptics — 
without increasing tlie gray matter which is concerned with mental 
processes. In reality the increase of neuroglia decreases the gray 
matter and thus deteriorates tlic mind. 

Or, if there is no increase in the neuroglia, there may be, with a large 
brain, an unduly small amount of gray cortex on account of a compara- 
tively small number of lissures and convolutions. Or, again, the cortex 
of gray matter may not reach the average thickness. Or, the texture 
of the brain may be poor — its microscopic elements feeble andpooily 
related and correlated. 

Thus it may be understood that a comparatively small brain — one 
below the average brain weight^ — may be capable of vastly finer and 
better work than a nuich larger one. 

So, iu answer to the question, " Is there any invariable connection

between intellij^ence aud mere wei.ulit or size of brain?" we answer, 
decidedly, '• no." 

Should tlie (luestion be asked whether a larger nnniber of niega-ce- 
phalie brains is likely to be Ibniid among races (»f high intelligence and 
cnltnre, we have the answer of Le Bon emphatically in the afliiinatix c, 
and it is in this dii'ection, as Le IJon has tanght ns, that we must look

In connei tion with this table it is interesting to remember that Le 
Ijon says: ''The cranial capacity of the gorilla often reaches GOU cnbic 
centimeters, so that it follows that there are a large number of men 
more allied by volnme of brain to the anthropoid apes than they are 
to some other men." 

Among other things, this table reveals the interesting tact that in 
the course of seven hundred years of advancing civilization the aver- 
age Parisian cranial capacity has distinctly increased in volume. 
It may be well to state, in conclusion, that Broca estimated that a 
brain in the male, weighing 1,040 grams, is the lowest limit comi)ati- 
ble with ordinary human inte]lig<'nce; in the female !MH grams. Ihinian 
beings with brain weight's lower than Broca's tigures are idiots, etc. 



THE BIRTH OF INVENTION.* 



Bv Otis T. Mason. 



In this apotlieosis of iuveutioii uml iiiveutors, to me lias been assigned 
tlie pleasing task of leading you baelc for a few moments to the cradle 
of humanity. Those are happy hours to most of us when we recall the 
days of childhood. To trace the lives of celebrated men and women 
to the springs of their moral and intellectual power brings never-fading 
delight. To study tlie rise and progress of a nation or any social unit 
is worthy of exalted minds. But the most profitable inquiry of all is 
the search for the origin of epoch-making ideas in order to comprehend 
the history of civilization, to conjure up those race memories in which 
each people transmits to itself and to posterity its former experiences. 

Every invention of any importance is the nursery of future inven- 
tions, the cradle of a sleeping Hercules. But my task is to si)eak of 
primitive man and his eftbrts. 

It will aid us in prosecuting our Journey backward to orient ourselves 
with reference to the present. For two days we have listened to the 
eloquent papers of my i)redcces.sors, Avritten to glorify the nineteenth 
century. Through this faculty of invention the whole earth is man's. 
There is not a lone island tit for his abode whereon sonu' Alexander 
Selkirk has not made a home. Every mineral, plant, and animal is so 
far known that a place has been found for it in his ^i/stcma Nafura'. 
Every creature is subject to man; the wiiuU, the seas, the sunshine, 
the lightning do his bidding. Projecting his vision Itcyond his tiny 
planet, this inxeiitiiig animal has catalogued and traced the motion of 
every star. 

But his crowning glory (which always tills me with admiration) is his 
ever increasing comprehensiveness. After centuries of cultivating 
acquaintance with the discrete phenomena around him, he has now 
striven to coordinate them, to make them organic, to icad system into 
them. He has learned by degrees to comjjrehend all things as parts of 
a single mechanism. 8ir Isaac Newton and Kepler conceiNcd all objects 
and all worlds to b(i held by univ«'rsal gravitation. ^Vnd thus, in our 
century, von Baer and Humboldt taught that the world, in all its forces

G04 THE BIRTH OF INVENTION. 

and materials, is aii integrated cosmos. Anyone who is the least 
familiar with the progress of philosoi)hy will recall that since the dawn 
of written history the thoughts of men were tending to this unitica- 
tiou. Shortly after tliis tirst effort at comprehensive unity Mayer, 
Eumford, and Joule invented the methods of demonstrating the oneness 
of physical forces, the conservation of energy. Wollaston, Kirchoft", 
and Bnusen devised the delicate apparatus to prove the chemical 
identity of all worlds. Lamarck, Geoffroy St. Hilaire, and Darwin 
taught the consanguinity of all living beings. Heluiholtz and Meyer 
coordinated nervous excitation with mental activity. Comte and 
Spencer grasped the unity of all sensible phenomena. T^ewtou, Leibnitz, 
and Hamilton projected their minds beyond phenomena and invented 
mathematics of four or more dimensions, conceiving of worlds and sys- 
tems that under the present order of nature can have no objective 
reality. Over all this, into many great souls, have come the notions of 
infinite space and time ami causation. The idea of limitation to tlumglit 
or achievement no longer enters the imagination. The depth of the 
sea, the distances of the stars, the concealment of the earth's treasures, 
the minuteness of the springs of life and sense, the multiplicity and 
complicity of phenomena are only so many incitements to greater 
achievements. The daring souls of this decade are determined at any 
risk to answer the inquiry of Pontius Pilate, What is truth? With 
sympathetic enthusiasm we wave them on, bidding them God-speed. 

But, 1 ask you now to forget all this and go with me to that early 
day when the tirst being, worthy to be called man, stood upon this 
earth. How economical has been his endowment. There is no hair on 
his body to keep him warm, his Jaws are the feeblest in the world, his 
arm is not equal to that of a gorilla, he can not lly like the eagle, he 
can not see into the night like the owl, even the hare is fleeter than he. 
He has no clothing, no shelter. He had no tools or industries or 
experience, no society or language or arts of pleasure, he had yet no 
theory of life and poorer conceptions of the life beyond. 

The road from that condition to our own lies next to the infinite. 
The one endowment that this creature possessed having in it the 
promise and i)otency of all future achievements, was the creative 
spark called invention. The superabundant brain, over and above all 
the amount required for mere animal existence, held in trust the possi- 
bilities of the future, and stamped upon man the clivine likeness. Tiiis 
naked ignoramus is the father of the clothed philosopher, looking out 
into infinite space and time and causation. It may give you pleasure 
to know something about the connections between these two and the 
witnesses to these connections. 

There are five guides whose services we have to engage on our inter- 
esting journey. The first is liistory, who does not know the way very 
far back — not over three thousand years — with nuich certainty. The 
second is philology, the study of which in our own century has ena- 



THE BIRTH OF INVENTION. 605 

bled lis to Mild the ciadle-laiid of iiiauy ])e()i)les. The third is folk-lore, 
the survival of belief and eiistom among' the niieducated. The fourth 
is archa'o]o<iy, history written in things. The tifth is ethnology, which 
informs IIS that in describing tli is arc of civilization some races have 
only marked time, Avhile others have moved witli radii of varyiu<:f lengths. 
The result of this is that Ave now have on the eartli t.\])es of every sort 
of culture it has ever known. At the present moincnt, within hailing 
distance of yonder most beautiful dome in the world dwell all these wit- 
nesses — the relics of the stone age, the Indian village of Xacochtank or 
Anacostia, the folk-lore of both continents, and the literatures of the 
world. \Yhile you are listening to the encoininms of our decade, pahe- 
olithie man sends in the testimony of his handicraft, the Smithsonian 
Institution treasures the inventions of the most i>rimitive races, and the 
Bureau of Ktlmology unravels the mysteries of savage tongues. 

As the fragment of a speech or song, a Avaking or a sleeping vision, 
the dream of a Aanished hand, a draught of water from a lamiliar spring, 
the almost perished fragrance of a pressed llower, call back the singer, 
the loved and lost, the loved and WM)n, the home of childhood, or the 
parting hour, so in the same manner there linger in this crowning 
decade of the crowning century bits of aiK-ient ingenuity which recall 
to a whole people the fragrance and beauty of its ])ast. 

From the testimony of these five witnesses we learn that there never 
was a time when man was not an inventor — never a time wheu he had 
not some sort of patent on his invention. They aftiriu that every art 
of living- and all the arts of ]»leasure were born in the stone age; that 
graphic art, sculpture, architectnre, painting, nnisic, and the drama 
had their childish ])rototy])es in tliat early day; that language is one 
of the very earliest of inventions, the vehicle of savage oratory, philos- 
ophy, and science. They aftlrni that society has been a series of inven- 
tions from the first; that legislation, justice, government, lu'operty, 
exchange, commerce, have not sprung' (uit of the ground, but within our 
definition ai'c inventions. And even the creeds and cults of mankind, 
whatever view you may take of the divine element underneath tliem, 
have been thought out and wrought out with iniinite pains from time 
t(»tiine l)yearnestsouls, lluttheyhad theiiorigin in thec.radlelaiid and 
in the infancy of our race. What ween joy is only the full-blown llower, 
the i)erfectcd Iruit of which they possessed the germ. liCt me enforce 
this idea, as we glorify Ihe material |)rosi)erit\' of the nineteenth cen- 
tury, that many centuiies ago men sat <lown and with gi'cat ])ains and 
scnrow invented the language, the ait, the industries, tlie social order 
which made our machines feasible and desirable. 

There is no conflict between the testimony of 1 licse witnesses and the 
doctrine commonly taught that men do not inxcnt customs and lan- 
guages, but fall into them. Keflect a moment upon yoiii' own daily 
life and you will recognize two sets of acti\ity, those Avliich yon origi- 
nate and those in which vou loUow suit, .Vnimals can learn to follow 



606 THE BIRTH OF INVENTION. 

suit, and to a very limited extent can originate. But it is the spark 
of originality which underlies every thought or device in this world. 
As Oiie man invents a machine and others by thousands fall into the 
use of it, as tbe musician composes a song and millions sing it, .so was 
it in the cradle-land of humanity the inventor, touched with fire from 
the divine altar, set new examples to be followed. If we were to inter- 
rogate our five witnesses, particularly with reference to the ancestry, 
the family tree of the notable inventions of the nineteenth century, 
their answer would be somewhat as follows:* 

The ancestor of the steam plow is the digging stick of savagery, a 
branch of a tree sharpened at the end by fire ; the progenitors of th^ 
steam harvester and thresher were the stone sickle, the roasting tray, 
or, later on, the tribulum. 

The cotton gin and ])ower loom are among the wonders of our age. 
Yet in that day of which we are speaking human fingers wrought the 
textile from first to last. They gathered the bark or wool, colored 
them to suit the primitive taste, spun and wove them with simple 
apparatus, and left upon the fabric ])atterus that are the despair of all 
modern machine-makers — patterns that arc a pleasure to the eye by 
their infinite variety, re|)laced in modern fabrics by a dreary monotony 
that aAvakens pain instead of pleasure. 

The first sewing machine was a needle or bodkin of bone, with dainty 
sinew thread from the leg of the antelope, and for thimble a little 
leather cai) over the ends of the fingers. Coarse, indeed, the appara- 
tus, but the hand was deft, the eye Avas true, the sense of beauty was 
there, and so that needlewonmn of long ago wrought in fur from the 
mammals, feathers from the birds, grasses from the fields, shells from 
the sea, wings from the beetle, and skins of snakes with tasteful 
geometric figures. You do err who think those ancient needle- women 
had no taste. It would be hard to invent a pattern now that was 
unfamiliar to them. 

The first engine was run by man power, then man subdued the horse, 
the ass, the camel, and invented engines for those to propel. He next 
domesticated the winds, the waters, the steam, the lightning, but the 
first common carriers and machine power were men and women. The 
first burden train was Avomen's backs; the first passenger car was a 
pai)0()se frame. 

The poetry of to-day is the fact of yesterday ; the dream of yesterday 
is the fact of to-day. When the savage woman a century or two ago, 
upon this very spot, strapped her dusky offspring to a rude frame, hung 
it upon the nearest sapling for the winds to rock, or lifted the unfor- 



*We ought to rcnicnibcr, however, tliat .'in invention is not always a thing; but 
that it may be any series of actions conducing towai <1 some new end. We should keep 
in mind, also, tliat all our activities in^'ol^'e materials and their (jualities; human, 
animal, and physical forces; tools and machines; processes, and products; and that 
invention may take place in any or all of these.

tuiiate suckling iVoin the ground to w liicli it hm[ been liuiied by tlie 
bending of an unsafe bougb, tliat was a lact, a stage in the liistory of 
invention. In our Dow-a(bxys eouehes of (h)\\n, swung from gikled 
hinges, we ha\'e got far ahead of the papoose eradki, the memory of 
which we perpetuate in nursery ihymes sung to (iliiklren, who wonder 
why babies shoukl be hung in tlie tops of trees and think, doubtless, 
that the falling cradle was a just retribution on the silly parents. 

What is more beautiful than an ocean steamer, with skin of steel 
drawn o\ei' i ibs of steel and closed above against the intrusion of the 
waves? Have you never seen the picture of the Eskimo, still in the 
stone age, who, over a framework of driftwood or whale's rib. stretches 
a covering of sealskin and learned therein to defy the waves hundreds 
of years ago ? 

Only now and then tlie angry sky was ligiited lor the i)iiiiiitive man 
by electricity, and even then it tilled him with terroi-. Hut it was he 
that invented the api)aratus for conjuring from dried Avood, l)y a rude 
sort of dynamo, the Promethean spark. It was our Aryan ancestors 
that paid theii' devotions to the rising sun by kindling fresh lire eveiy 
morning as the orb of day flashed his first beam across tlie earth. 

Who has not read, with almost breaking heart, the story of Palissy, 
the Huguenot potter? But what have our witnesses to say of that 
long line of humble creatures that conjured out of ])rophetic clay, with- 
out wheel or furnace, forms and decorations of imperishable beauty 
which are now being copied in glorified material in the best factories of 
the world? In ceramic as well as in textile art the first inventors were 
women. They quarried the clay, nmnipulated it, constructed and 
decorated the ware, burned it in a rude furnace, and wore it out in a 
hundred uses. 

He had no printing ]>ress, but he could tie knots in a marvellous 
fashion and write letters on bark or on bits of raw hide and leave 
memorials of himself in the book of stone, lie made words and sen- 
tences, invented language, developed artistic forms of speech handed 
down to us in the eloquent harangues of his sages. He breathed his 
thoughts in poetry, a kind of childish rhythm. 

In the time of ^vhich we now are speaking the telegra]>h was a series 
of signal fires and a wonderful code of signs, which a distinguished 
scholar of our city has Just unravelled. 

Primitive man developed the art of wai-, means of offense and 
defense; weapons of ])ercussion, for cutting and thrusting; prdjjcctilcs, 
armor, fortification, strategy. 

^S^owhere has man pressed his hand so effectively ui)on nature as in 
the domestication of animals. It is almost incredible that ravening 
wolves and merciless felines should become faithful dogs and imrring 
cats; that the wild sheej) and goat should descend from their inacces- 
sible fastnesses, and yield their fleece ami flesh and milk; that horses, 
asses, camels, elephants, should be induced to lend their backs and

limbs to ligliteu the loads of the first common carrier. This process of 
impressing Lis own qualities on wild creatures began very early in his- 
tory, and has continued uniteLruptedly from first to last.* 

His affairs of state were managed tbrough his patent system. The 
great inventors were made the rulers of the people, and his highest 
title to nobility was a most puissant and ingenious one. 

He had courts of justice, heard witnesses, executed his laws. It is 
true that the methods were summary, when a. (chancery suit was settled 
by execution on the same day as the death of the devisor. But out of 
his struggles came our methods, and the greatest drawback to secur- 
ing justice now is the survival of his antiquated customs into our new 
practices. 

He invented philosophies and sciences, explained the universe and 
himself to himself. This seems puerile now, but it was the beginning 
of all our own s])eculations, necessary to us at present, but which will 
to-morrow become folk-lore. Over and over again, those who preceded 
me on this jilatform have pointed to James Watt as the true deliverer 
of mankind. Far be it from me to take one leaf from his laurel crown; 
but the inventor of the alphabet, of the decimal system of notation, 
of representative government, of the golden rule in morality were 
greater than he. 

For the dream in stone and carving and decoration called a (cathedral, 
"Where, through long-drawn aisle and fretted vault, 
The pealing anthem swells the notes of praise," 

that early day has only to offer wild shouts in unison undei- the starlit 
dome, touched by the first childish aspirations after the divine, or 
hopes of immortality. 

While you look with admiration ui)on these panoramas of progress 
you can not have failed to observe on the canvas that the art, the proc- 
ess and rewards of inventing itself, have undergmie the very same 
development and improvement as the things invented. There is in this 
a marvellous similarity to the life processes of animals and plants. The 
homogeneous yolk of the egg during incubation becomes wonderfully 
complex and heterogeneous ; but all of these diverse parts come together 
into a higher unity, in which each organ ministers to the good of all. 

*Iu a Saturday lecture delivered in the National Museum, March 18, 1882, the 
author sought to combine the result of Morgan's culture stages, being seven, with 
the work of Klenini, Tylor, Lane Fox, and Spencer, who had treated separate arts 
from an evolutionary or, I should say, an inventional motive. This any one may 
re})eat for himself hy ruling n broad sheet of paper into eight columns. At the top 
of the several colunms Avrite the words of Morgan, or, l)ett(U-, the first.seveu Roman 
numerals. In the.. lines down the left-hand margin write any words you choose to 
examine, say music or wcapovs. The seven stages of music or of weapons would 
appear by reading across the sheet from left to right. Care should be taken not to 
confound the species of the same thought, for example, bruising, piercing, or slash- 
ing weapons; or string music, with reed music or horn music. A table made thus 
for all activities would be an index of all culture in all time. 



THE I5IKTJI OF INVENTIOX. 609 

Tlic eailit'st imeiitioii was a single liomogeiuMtus act, an original sugges- 
tion, a liappy tbouglit. Tlie patent on this was an immediate and indi- 
vidual benefit. A sharper knife of fiint, a Ix-tter scraper, a h)nger 
spear, a stouter tliread wrought better and the reward was more exe- • 
ention. Now, the man who made tlie best wea])ons killed the most 
game, from that game he got better food, that food made him st longer, 
that strength made him chief, that chieftaincy gave him more wives, 
more children, mon^ cohorts to sn])port his tlirone. The best woman 
to cook or sew or carry loads got the best husband ; that was her pat- 
ent. From these simple methods of inventing and rewarding invention 
we co'neon to the Olympic games, the mono^xdies, the patent system. 
And now, in the inventor's lab(mit<ny of Graham, IjcII, or Edison the 
climax is readied, wiici'c one machine is the co-o])erative result of any 
number of trained minds, and the reward is meted out to each by the 
uianufacturer; or, in this Tateut Congress itself, we may have a still 
more highly organized unit, wherein the inventors of America l>ecome a 
body social, and together shake hands under the sea with the P^mperor 
of Germany, who s(nids liis congratulations to-day on the o(;casion of 
our meeting. 

The law of ))rogress in the dcNelopment of tin' thing invented, of the 
process of mind and hand in the act of inventing, of the reward i)aid 
to the in\'entor, of tin* (changes in society itself through the invention, 
is from the homogeiu'ous to the heterogeneous, as Herbert Spencer has 
well indicated. This applies to tiie uses of materials, the conquest of 
natuial Ibices, the d(na^loi)nuMit of the (pialities of things, the perfec- 
tion of the instiiiiiients and mo(h*s of a|>|)lyiiig tliem, and the wants 
which are gratilicd ami to lie gratified b.\' tin* finished prodru'ts. 

Tlie great chisses of industry that you are trying ever to serve are 
one and all your i)er])etual (h'bt(U's. l*roducers, like farmers, fisher- 
men, lumbermen, miners, briM'ders, or hunters, have passed through the 
foregoing s<'hool of <'xp<*ricnce. 

No less indebted to you for lifting tlieir burdens are the coiiimon 
carriers of tlie world, since you have trained the winds, the waters, the 
animal kingdom, to undertak*' for mankind journeys that Avould 
have utterly discouraged them. It is easy to show, in fac^t, that the 
common carrying organizations are as much an evolution or elaboration 
as the tools they use. 

But what shall 1 say of the nianufactiirer — Ids methods, his rewards, 
his guilds, his inteiest in ))olitics? rari passu with those efficient 
tools, that complicated machinery iu his hands and about him, he him- 
self has been invented. He is no longer bke the primitive artisan Aviio 
struck the first Makes from britth^ stone. He is in touch with many 
others, who together with him constitute the higher unit of an o]-ganized 
factory or association of factories. It was once said that it takes nine 
tailors to make a man, but, suiely, it takes niiu^ hundred men and 
w'ouuMi to make a suit of clothes, or a house, or a lo(;omotive. The

co-oidiiiatioii and organization of these industrial cohorts, 1 afliriii and 
repeat, is invention of the highest order. There are no hitters patent 
on them. They enjoy natural patents, that is, by selection and the 
• survival of the fittest; tliose who do the best and work together the 
best, get the reward. 

Tlie commerce of the world is an excellent example of invention 
affecting men as well as their tools. Merchants and bankers, ex- 
changers of goods and exchangers of the ])rices of goods, have been 
also invented. It would hardly be affirmed that this world-encircling 
current of activity called trade had come about by merely following 
suit or following the fashion. Were that so, Wall street bankers and 
A^ew York merchants wonld now be standing naked on the shores 
of Manhattan Island bartering i)eltiies for clams. Patent Congresses 
would never have been thought of, and this essay would not have been 
written. At first eveiy man was his own exploiter, carrier, manufac- 
turer, merchant, banker, and customer. But now all men are servants 
of all men. By a system of credits only one one-thousandth part of 
the world's business is done for cash or barter. The human species, 
regardless of race or langnage or education , has become a universal com- 
bine for mutual helpfulness. And this combine has more parts playing 
into j)arts and wheels working into wheels than may be seen in a vast 
cotton factory. All this is the result of excogitation, of invention. The 
trader is the son of the trapper, the storekeeper is the son of the 
trader. In the direct line come the retailer, the wholesaler, the firm, 
the importer, the trust. The gatherer of cowries is the father of the 
wamijum maker, and the son of the latter is maker of metallic slugs 
bearing the stamj) of a domestic beast 5 his son issued the first coins, 
and the family tree brings you straight down to the llothschilds, who 
have handled at least once all the money of the world. 

Now, what have I to say abont the consunu'r, who, after all, is said 
by doctrinaires to pay all the bills? The consumer also has been 
invented, from my i^oint of view. The first consumer wore out little 
clothing, dwelt in an inexpensive habitation, and his bill of fare was 
limited. His service, equipage, variety of enjoyments, were circum- 
scribed. Can you think of any one so bereft ? In our cities, if we found 
wandering about a person so poorly endowed, our hearts would be filled 
with commiseration. Now, from that man to any successful modern, or 
more correctly to our whole modern time combined, is the road along 
which consumers have been invented. The kinds of wants have been 
refined and increased in number. Each want has become more exacting 
aiul discriminating. Intellectual, social, jiesthetic, moral, and political 
wants have been <a^eated. And these, n.ot in single persons only, but 
there have been composite wants, world- embracing wants and ambi- 
tions thought out, whose gratificatiiui come to Inunan beings in families, 
clubs, guilds, corporations, cities, congresses, nationalities, and interna- 
tionalities. And these, C(msmning what they have produce<l. Hud that 
the earth is inexhaustible. 



THE jnilTIl OF INVENTION. 611 

We arc assembled to glorify the tirst century uC American ])atcntvS. 
A few months ago the disc-iples of Dagnerre met in our city and set up 
in the ISTational ]\Iuseum a monument to the inventor of i)liotography. 
I do not know that there is another memorial in Americai to an 
inventor. There is no bettei- way to insnre for posterity the recollec- 
tion of this day than by stimulating among the great industries tiie 
desire to continue this good work of memorializing their founders. 
Perhaps you nniy not build your monument of stone or bronze; you 
may set n[> a library, yon may solicit a corner in the National ^Mnsenm 
or Congressional Library, or you nuiy secure a better Patent building. 

In our public i)laces we set np statues of the destroyers of mankind 
and erect monuments in our national cemeteries to tlie anonymous 
dead. When we go to hang garlands npini the eulogium-beariug 
tombs we do not forget to scatter flowers npon the mansolenm of the 
unknown. 

We can not gather from the fonr corners of the world the bones of all 
the great inventors and honor them with a costly burial. Even their 
names have j>erished from the records of mankind, but their works 
endure. What better can we do than to gathei- these and guard them 
in our great museums, mute witnesses of anticjuatcd arts. I can imag- 
ine these anonymous inventors looking upon us to-day and glad of this 
tardy recognition of their vicarious suflerings.

AMEEICAE INYENTIOXS AND IHSCOVERIES IN MEDICINE, 
SUEGERY, AND PRACTICAL SANITATION.* 



By John S, Billings, M. D. 



In connection with this celebration of a century's work of the Amer- 
can x)ateut system, I have been requested by the advisory committee 
to prepare a brief paper uijon inventions and discoveries in medicine, 
surgery, and practical sanitation, with si)ecial reference to the progress 
that has beeu made in this country in tliese branches of science and art. 

It«won]d be imi)ossible to present on this occasion such a summary 
as would be of any si)ecial interest or use, of the progress which has 
been made in medicine and sanitation during the century, either by 
the world at large or by American physicians and sanitarians in par- 
ticular: and T shall therefore confine my remarks inainlyto the progress 
which has been made in these branches in connection with mechanical 
inventions and new chemical cond)inations devised l)y American 
inventors — whicli will re(|uire much less time. 

The application of the ])atent system to medicine in this country has 
had its advantages for certain ])eople, has given employment to a con- 
siderable amount of capital in ])roduction (and to a nuicli larger amount 
in advertising), has contributed materially to tlu^ revenues of the Gov- 
ernment, and has made a great deal of work for the medical profession. 

So far as J know, but one complete system of medi(;ine has been pat- 
ented in this country, and that was the steam, (Cayenne i)e])per, aiul 
lobelia system — commonly known as.Thomsonianisni — lo which a patent 
was granted in ] 83(1. The right to ])ractice this system, with a book 
describing the methods, was sold by the i)atcntee for *20, and perhaps 
some of you may have some reminiscences of it connected with your boy- 
ish days. I am certnin I shall ncAcr forget the effects of "composition 
powder," or of "number six," which was essentially a. concentrated 
tinctnr<' of Cayenne ])epper, and one dose of whicli w;is ciMMigli to make 
a boy Avilling to go to school for a month. 

From a rei)ortmadeby the Commissioner of J'atents in ISl'.t, it ai)])ears 
that 86 patents for medicines had been granted up to that date; but

tlie tspeciticatious of most of tlioso is.sue(l bcfoic ls;>(j liad been lost l)y 
(ire.. Tlie greater iiuiiiber of i)iiteiits for medicines were, issued between 
IS.IO and 1860. The total number of patents liranted for medieines 
during- the last decade (KSS(>-1,S!»0) is 540.* 

This, however, applies onl>- to ''•i)atent medicines," jnoperly so called, 
the claims for which are, for the most iiart, presented by simple-minded 
men who know very little of the ways of the world. A patent requires 
a full and unreserved disclosure of the recipe, and the mode of com- 
l)ouuding the same, for the public benefit when the term of the patent 
shall have expired ; and the Commissioner of Patents may, if he chooses, 
require the applicant to furnish specimens of the composition ami of its 
ingredients, sufficient in quantity for the purpose of experinu'ut. The 
law, however, does not recjuire the applicant to furnish patients to be 
experimented on, and this may be the reason why the Commissioner 
has never demanded sami)les of the ingredients. By far the greater 
number of the owners of jianaceas and nostrums are too shrewd to thus 
publish their secrets, for they can attain their purpose much better 
under the law for registering trade-marks and labels, designs for bot- 
tles and ])ackages, and copyrights of printed matter, which are less 
costly, and do not reveal the arcanum. 

These proprietary medicines constitute the great bulk of what the 
public call "patent medicines.'' 

The trade in patent and secret remedies has been, and still is, an 
important one. We are a bitters-and pill-taking people; in the fried 
pork and saleratus biscuit regions the demand for such medicines is 
unfailing, but everywhere they are found. I suppose the chief con- 
sumption of them is by women and children — with a fair allowance of 
clergymen, if we may judge from the printed testimonials. I sampled 
a good many of them myself when I was a boy. Of course, these 
remarks do not apply to bitters. One of the latest patents is for a 
device to wash pills rapidly down the throat. 

According to the census of 1880 there were in the United States 592 
establishments devoted to the numufacture of drugs and chemicals, the 
capital invested being $28,598,458, andtheannual value of the product 
'$38,173,658, while there were 563 establishments devoted to the man- 
ufacture of i)atent medicines and compounds, the capital invested 
being $10,620,880, and the value of the product, $14,682,494.1 

A patent automatic doctor, on the princii)le of "put a quarter in the 
slot and take out the pill which suits your case," has been proposed, 
but this patent is said to be of Dutch sind not of American origin. The 
idea of this may have come from Japan, for an old medicine case from 
that country which I i)ossess has four compartments filled with pills, 

and the label says that those in the first compartment are good for all

The i)roblein is to indu(!e people to i)ay -.") eents for tlie liv'er-encourag- 
ing-, silent-i)erauibnlatini;-, family pills, \\ hicli cost 3 eents. Some day 
I ho\H' that the modern prol'essioniil expert in advertising- will favovns 
with his \iews as to the natni'e and eharaeter of those i)eo]»]e who were 
induced to buy rFones's liver pills or Slow's specific by means of a huge 
display of these names on the sides and roofs of l)arns and outbuild- 
ings, v.hich dis[day forms sucii a prominent fe.iture in many of our 
Amei'iean landse;ii)es, as seen by the tra\ell»n- on the railway. 1 sup- 
pose there must be such people, for I have a high estimate of tlie busi- 
ness shrewdness of the men who pay for these abominations. I slnmld 
also like to knov>' how nau-h a farmer gets for allowing his buildings to 
be thus defaced. He must behard-u]*; indeed such a display indicates 
that the ])lace is ]>rob;ibly mortgaged juhT tlrnt the i)oor man is heavily 
in debt. 

Eveu the soap ad\('i'tisers are not as guilty as the nostrum-iuakers 
in this particular style of nuisance, although they far exceed them 
in viciousness when it comes to ajtplyiug art to ignoble purposes. The 
connection between progress in medicine and soa]) advertisements may 
not be deal' to you; but it exists nevertheless, for many of these soaps 
make work for the doctors by ]noducing skin troubles. 

TT})on the whole. J siiould think that the number of people Avho woukl 
take some trouble to a\<)id purchasing an article which is thus adver- 
tised must be rapidly increasing, so that such displays will soon be no 
longer protitable. The great importance of advertising (hies not relate 
to the placard or chromo business, but to its relations to periodical 
literature — to the daily and weekly ])ress and the monthly magazines 
and journals. 

To tlie establishiiunit and support of some of our newspapers and 
journals, medieval as well as others, these iiroprietary and secret medi- 
cines, cosmetics, food ])re]>aiations, etc., have no doulit contributed 
largely. 

I am sorry to say that 1 have been unable to obtain delinitc informa- 
tion as to the direct benefits which inventions of this kind have con- 
ferred on the public in the way of the (aire of disease or preventing 
death. Among the questions which were not put in the schedules of 
the last census Avere the following, namely: Did you ever take any 
patent or proprietary medicine? If so, what and how much, and wduit 
was^the result? Some very remarkable statistics would no doubt have 
been obtaiiu'd had this inquiry been made. I can only say that I know 
of but four secret remedies which ha\-e been really valuabh' additions 
to the resources of practical medicine, and the composition of all these 



616 AMERICAN INVENTIONS 

is uow Ivhowii. These four are all i)owevtnl and <1aiigerous, and sliould 
only be used on the advice of a. skilled physician. Most of such reme- 
dies have little value as curative agents, and some of them are prepared 
and purchased almost exclusively for immoral or criminal purposes. 

lu Prance the sale of secret and patent medicines is not allowed 
unless they have been examined and approved by the National Academy 
of Medicine, and the samti general rule holds good in Italy and Sj)ain. 

The Japanese have followed the Frensh method, and their experience 
is interesting. The Central Sanitary Bureau established a public lab- 
oratory for the analysis of chemicals as a medicine. The proprietors of 
each of such meditanes were bound to present samples, and the names 
and proportions of the ingredients, directions for its use, and explana- 
tions of its supposed efficacy. According to a report in the British 
Medical Journal, during the first year there were 11,904 applicants for 
license to prepare and sell 148,091 patent and secret medicines. Per- 
mission for the preparation and sale of 58,(138 different kinds were 
granted, 8,592 were prohibited, 9,918 were ordered to be discounte- 
nanced, and 70,943 remained to be reported on. The great majority of 
those which were authorized were of no ctticucy, but few being reme- 
dial agents; but their sale was not ])rohibited, as they were not found 
to be dangerous to the health of the people.* I do uot vouch for these 
figures, which throw our records entirely in the shade. 

In 1849 a special committee of the U. S. House of Ite]u^esentatives 
reported to the House a bill to prevent the patenting of medicines, 
accompanied by a report. This bill ])rovided that after the passage 
o# the act letters patent shall not be granted for any article whatever 
as a medicine, provided that this shall not apply to machines, instru- 
ments, or apparatus. AVhen the matter came before the House for 
consideration the bill was laid on tlie table, t 

You are all aware that the great majority of the medical profession 
consider it to be improper and discreditable for a physician to patent a 
remedy. The medical code of ethics declares that it is derogatory to 
professional character "for a])hysican to hold a patent for any surgical 
instrument or medicine; or to dispense a secret nostrum whether it be 
the composition or exclusive property of himself or others. For if sucli 
nostrum be of real eflicacy, any concealment regarding it is inconsist- 
ent with beneficence and professional liberality; and if mystery alone 
give it value and imjiortance, such craft implies either disgraceful 
ignorance or fraudulent avarice. It is also reprehensible for physicians 
to give certificates attesting the efficacy of patent or secret medicines, 
or in any way to promote the use of them." Like all legislation, this is 
a formal declaration of the customs of the j^rofession, which customs 
are of great antiquity. The principle upon which it is founded is thus 
expressed by Lord Bacon: ''I hold every man a debtor to his profes-

The rule, however, is not always adhered to by pliysicians, the most 
uota.ble exception having- been, i)erbaps, the use of Koch's lymph 
before its comiwsition was revealed. As regards the patenting of sur- 
gical instruments and api)aratus, the opinion of the great majority of 
l)hysieians is in accordaiice with the rule just stated, but there are 
some who question its propriety, although they obey it — and there are 
few who would not use a patented instrument in a case to which they 
thought it was applicable. 

The total number of surgical iustruinents and a[)pliances patented 
during- the past decade has been about J, 200, the patents having been 
in almost all eases taken out by manufacturers. With these may be 
classed dentists' tools and api^aratus, of which about TKIO have been 
patented during the last ten years, and in this field of invention the 
T'nited States leads the world. The same may be said with regard to 
artilici;'.! lind)s, of whicli our great war gave rise to many varieties. 

As you know, the law inescribes that a patent may be given for a 
"new and useful art, machine, manufacture or composition of matter.'' 
1 used to think that the word ''■useful "in this law had its ordinary 
meaning, and therefore wondered exceedingly as to why the Patent 
Office examiners alloM^ed patents to certain things which came under 
my notice. One day, however, I received an article from the Patent 
Oflice, with the request for a report as t() whether it was usefnl in the 
sense in which that word was used by the office, namely, " not per- 
nicious or prejudicial to public interest — capable of being used"' — and 
then for the first time T understood one of the first i^rinciples of the 
l)atent law ot the United States, that is, that it does not take into con- 
sideration the degree of utility in the dcA'ice, or, in other words, that 
"useful '" means '^ harmless," 

If a patent is granted to a nn'dicine, it must be as a comixtsition of 
matter as a special article of manufa(;ture. The practice of th(^ Patent 
Oflice in these matters is not generally understood. It docs not now 
consider that medical prescriptions are inventions within the mean- 
ing of the law, or that a mere aggregation of well-known remedies to 
obtain a cunmlati\(', efl'ect is a patentable composition of matter. A 
certain number of claims for (iovernment protection in the form of 
patents or trade-marks are made for medical compounds or for ai)paratus 
under fiilse pretenses- that is to say, the claim is for a new rcimedy for 
rheumatism or dyspepsia or displacement, Avith a Avar n in g against their 
use under certain conditions, the real design being that they are to be 
used under precisely these conditions in order to i^rocnre sibortion, etc. 
These are sometimes difficult cases for the Patent Office to treat prop 
erly, for the law does not allow a large discretion for refusal on mere 
suspicion, and where there is ostensible and possible utility (in the 



618 AMERICAN INVENTIONS 

P;iteiit Ottioe sense) it can liaidly reject the claim on the iironnd that 
the invention might be usert for iinnioral i)uriioses. 

J said in the beginning' that I can not on this occasion give any snf- 
iicient account oftlie progress of invention and discovery in medicine 
and sanitation during the century just gone, Tlie great step forward 
which has been made has been the establisliment of a ti'ue scientific 
foundation for the art upon the discoveries made in pliysics, chemistry, 
and biohjgy. One Imndred years ago the practice of medicine and 
measures to preserve health, so far as these were really efficacious, 
were in the main empirical — that is, certain effects were known to 
usually follow the giving of certain drugs or the apx)liciition of certnin 
measures, but why or how these effects Avere produced was unknown. 
They sailed then by dead-reckoning, in several senses of this phrase. 

Since then not only have great advances been made by a continuance 
of these empirical measures in treatment, but we have learned much as 
to the mechanism and functions of different parts of the body and as 
to the nature of the causes of some of the most i)revalent and fatal 
forms of disease, and, as a consecpience, can apply means of preven- 
tion or treatment in a much more direct and definite way than was 
formerly the case. For example, a hundred years ago nothing Avas 
known of the difference between typhns and typhoid fevers. We have 
now discovered that the first is a disease pro})agated largely by aerial 
(contagion and induced or aggravated by overcrowding, the preventive 
nutans being isolation, light, and fresh air; while the second is due to a 
minute vegetable organism, a bacillus, and is propagated mainly by con- 
taminated water, milk, food, and clothing; and that the treatment of 
the two diseases should be very different. 

The most important improvements in practical medicine made in the 
I" nited States have been chiefly in surgery, in its various branches. 
We have led the way in the ligation of some of the larger arteries, in 
the removal of abdominal tumors, in the treatment of diseases and 
injuries peculiar to women, in the treatment of sj)iual affections and of 
deformities of various kinds. Above all, we were the first to show the 
uses of ansesthetics — the most important advance in medicine made 
during the century. In our late war we taught Europe how to build, 
organize, and manage military hosx)itals; and we formed the best 
museum in existence illustrating modern military medicine and sur- 
gery. Our contributions to medical literature have been nmny and val- 
uable; and our Cxovernment possesses the largest and best working 
medical library in the world. We have more doctors and more medi- 
cal schools, in i)roportion to the population, than any other' country, 
and, while this is not good evidence of progress, I am glad to be .able 
to say that the standard of acquirements in medical education has been 
and is now rising, and our leading medical schools are now being- 
equipped with buildings, with apparatus, with laboratories, and, most 
important of all, with brains, which enable them to give means of 
practical instruction etpial to any to be found elsewhere. 



IX MEDICINE, SUMGEKY, ETC. <)1'.) 

As icpjrds ])ievtMi1iAT public iiie<liciiic and sanitation, we liavr not 
made so many valualilc contributions to the ^voild's stock of know led, i;e, 
cliietly l)ccausc, until <|uitc recently, we have not had the stimulus to 
persistent <'lllbrt which comes tVom density of i)oi)'.!]ation and its com- 
plicated relation to sewage disposal and water supi)lies; nor have we 
had the iuformati(Ui relative to localized causes of disease and (h'ath, 
which is the essential foundation of i)nl)lic hygiene, and which can only 
lie obtained b\ a proper system of vital statistics. We can, however, 
show enough and to spare of iuver.tions in the Avay of sanitary a])[)li- 
ances, tixtures, and systems for house drainage, sewerage, etc.; for the 
ingenuity of inventors has kept i»ace with tlie increasing demands fbi- 
protection from the etfects of the (leconii)osition of waste matters as 
increase of knowledge has made these known to us. The total nundter 
of patents granted for sanitary appliances during the last decade (1880- 
1S90) is about 1,17."), If good tixtures necessarily involve good phnub- 
iug woik we could easily make our houses safe so far as drainage is 
concerned; but a leaky joint or a tilled trap makes the best a])pliance 
worthless. The im])ulse to imitrovements in this direction lias come 
maiidy fiom England, where most of tlie }uinciples of good work of this 
kind has been developed: but we have devised s(mie details better 
adapted to our climate and modes of construction, and while many of the 
})atent traps and sewer-gas excluders are only useful in the patent-law 
hense, and some not even in that, it is nevertheless true that the safety, 
accessibility, and good appearance of ])lumlber's work has been hirgely 
im-reased during the last few years by patented inventions. Much the 
s;ime may be said with regard to heating apidiances, including venti- 
lating stoves and fireplaces, radiators, etc., but I am unable to express 
any enthusiam with regard to what are commonly called i)atent venti- 
lators. 

No doubt the greatest progress in medical science during the next 
tew years will be in the direction of prevention, and to this end mechan- 
ical and chemical invention and discovery must go hand in hand with 
increase in biological and medical knowledge. Neither can afford to 
neglect or despise the other, and both are w-orking for the common 
good. If the American ])atent system has not given rise to any spe- 
cially valuable inventions in practical medicine, in law^, or in theology, 
it nnist be due to the nature of the subjects, and not to any fault of the 
system. 



ENDOWMENT FOll SCIENTIFIC EESEAKCII AND PIJBLI- 

C AT ION,* 



By Addison Brown. 



Twenty years ago Prof, Tyndall delivered in New York and in other 
cities of this conntry a series of leetnres npon light. The last of the 
series was an iin[)ressive ])leai for a mor<» tliorongh prosecution of 
original research in pure science; and incidentally, for the need of en- 
doAvments to maintain it. I was fortunate in having the opportunity 
to listen to tliat remarkable course of lectures, and to that plea for 
science. Its impression has never left me. The impression was the 
deeper, because Tyndall set upon it the seal of self-denial. Some $30,000, 
nearly the entire net ]>roceeds of his lectures in the United States — 
money for which he undoubtedly had abundant use in his own affairs, 
or at least in the prosecution of researches in his own country, and which 
by all precedent and the example of other lecturers he would have taken 
witli him — tills he lias given to the science of this country, endowing- 
therewith, in 1^S~) tliree scho]arshij)S for the ])rosecution of original 
research in physics, one under the direction of Columbia College, one 
under Harvard, and a third at the University of Pennsylvania. 

The truths utteicd and the example set by this self denying master 
have already many times l)orne fiuit. The late President Barnard, of 
Columbia College, who was a warm supporter of Prof. Tyndall when 
here, beiiueatlM'd to Columbia upon his decease a lew years since the 
sum of *l(l,0()O for the endowment of another fellowship for the enc(mr- 
agemeut of scientific research, niK)n substantially the same terms as 
those of the Tyndall scholarships. In other parts of the country there 
have been some other endowments for similar [)urposes. In tlie last 
year Columbia has also received $100,000, the munificent becpiest of Mv. 
DaCosta,for tlie establishment of the departmentof biology. Although 
this bequest is not primarily for the prosecution of original research, 
it is not restricted by hami)ering conditions, and Mill to some extent, it 
is hoped, admit of a direct and continuous support of the highest and 
most advanced studies.

622 ENDOWMENT FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. 

The appeal made by Tyndall has been (.tften renewed by scientific 
men ; by the heads of universities ; by the presidents of scientific asso- 
ciations, here and abroad; and by none, perhaps, more eloquently than 
by Dr. Edwin Ray Lancaster, in his address before the biological sec- 
tion of the British Association at Southport, in 1883. 

What shall we say to the call and the examides of such men? Was 
the gift of Tyndall based only upon an idle fancy? Or was it the result 
of a clear perception of a profound truth, viz, America's need of that 
money as a stimulus and sui)i)ort to more scientific research; the call 
on him being felt to be the more imperious, because the need of it was 
so plain to him, while obscure to others; and making his act, therefore, 
a noble instance of self-renunciation in an unappreciated cause? 

'^To keep society as regards science in healthy play," he says, "three 
classes of workers are necessary : 

'' 1. The investigator of natural truth, whose vocation it is to pursue 
that truth and extend the fieM of discovery for truth's own sake, with 
out leference to practical ends, 

''2. The teacher, to diftuse this knowledge. - - ■ 

"3. The applier of these principles and truths to make them availa- 
ble to the needs, the comforts or the luxuries of life. - - - 

"These three classes ought to co-exist and interact. The popular 
notions of science - - - often relate, not to science strictly so called, 
but to the application of science." 

The great discoveries of scientific truth, he continues, are "not made 
by practical men, and they never will be made by them; because their 
minds are beset by ideas which, though of the highest valiie in one point 
of view, are not those which stimulate the original discoverer." 

In a chance conversation, a lew weeks since, 1 received a confirma 
tion of these words, so direct and unexpected, that it may bear citation. 
I was talking with an electrical expert who had made several very in- 
teresting and iniportant inventions. I asked hiin of how much imi)or- 
tance he conceived that the scientific men of the closet, the original 
investigators, so-called, had been in working out the great inventions 
of electricit>- during th(» last fifty years — the telegraph cables, tele- 
phones, the electric lighting, and the electric motors; and whether 
these achievements were not in reality due, mainly, to the practical 
men, the inventors, who knew what they were after, rather than to the 
men of science, who rarely applied their work to practical use? 

"Not at all," he said, "the scientific men are of the utmost impor- 
tance; everything that has been done has proceeded upon the basis of 
what they have previously discovered, and upon the principles and 
laws which they have laid down. Nowadays we never Avork at random. 
Look at that electric liglit! Of the energy expended in producing it, 
only 7 j)er cent api)ears as light ; the rest, 93 per cent, is wasted, mainly 
in heat. We are all now trying to prevent this enormous waste. I 
want to reverse that i)roportion : but if I can reduce the waste to only

.'53 per cent, a patent of my invention will be wortli millions of dollars 
for Its economy in jjrodnction. In seeking this we do not work at ran- 
dom. 1 go to my laboratory; stndy the applications of the principles, 
facts, and laws which the great scientists like Faraday, Thompson, and 
Maxwell have worked ont, and endeavor to tind snch devices as shall 
secnre my aim." 

Tliis is but an expression, in another form, of what Tyndall said 
twenty years ago: '-Behind all our practical applications, there is a 
region of intellectual action to which practical men have rarely con- 
tributed, but from which they draw all their suj)plies. Cut them oii" 
from that region, and they become eventually helpless." 

Wliat is true in one department of natural science is, I apprehend, 
e(pmlly true ni all. The practical men do not work at random, bnt upon 
the basis of what s(uentific research aud publication have i»reviously put 
within their grasp. 

It is evident ther(^fore that not only the advancement of knowledge 
itself, but all possibility of any continuous advance in those great im- 
provements whicli are to mitigate the sorrows, aud promote the health, 
the conveniences and the comfoits of men, is vitally dei)endent upon 
the progress of sc^ientilic research. In recent years how marvellous 
have these improvements been ! Besides those that are most common 
and familiar to all, what miracles, almost, have been achieved through 
the photograph, the spectroscope, the microscope; by the discovery of 
the sources of fermentation and of putrefaction; by the discovery of 
ana'sthetics and the ai»i>lication of antisei)tic methods in surgery, and 
111 the treatment of other lesions! These latter discoveries alone have 
ameliorated beyond expression the sufferings of man; they save more 
liv<'s than war and pestilence destroy, suri)assing (^veii in that regard 
the safety lamp of ^SIr lliim()hrey Davy — an invention whicii, at the 
tiiiu^ it was made, was said to ha\ e exceeded every lu'cvious discovery 
as a means of saving human life, except, possibly, inoculation for 
smallpox. 

This\ital relation b<'tween the advancement of knowledge and the 
welfare of man fiirnislies an all-sntricient reason for the<'ontinuous and 
never-ending pros«><'ution of original research. Of necessity the original 
work (»f discovery must always lea<l; that must always precede the 
j>ractical apjjhcations. The lu'cessity for such research must, there- 
fore, continue, so long as science and human society end are. As there 
is no liiiiit to the ad\ance of knowledge, so there can be no limit to the 
benefactions it is capable of conterring upon mankind. The moie rapid 
the advance, the more speedy the enjoyment of its fruits. In this 
relation alone, the need of amj)le jirovisioii for scientitic; progress is one 
that addresses itself equally to tlui nation, to the state, to jdiilan- 
thropists, and to all who W(Uild advance the welfare oT man. on the 
broadest and most enduring lines.

gator of pure science does not work for profit. His discoveries are not 
marketable. Tlie law allows no patent upon a principle of" nature or 
the discovery of a new truth. Xewtou could not patent the law of 
gravitation, nor Volta the galvanism of the voltaic pile; nor Ehrenberg 
and Schwaniij the discovery of the widespread influence of bacteria; 
nor Faraday, nor Henry, electro-magnetism; nor Joule, his correlation 
of forces; nor Jackson, his anaesthetics; nor Lister, his antiseptic treat- 
ment; nor Koch nor Pasteur, their discoveries of the bacilli, the 
destruction of which may lead to the cure or amelioration of terrible 
diseases. To the practical men and to the inventors, on the other 
hand, who apply to the specific wants of men the truths and principles 
which the scientists have made known to them, the law, in the form of 
a patent, gives a monopoly of from fourteen to twenty-one years. They 
thus obtain, as a rule, a reasonable, and, in some cases, even an exces- 
sive, pecuniary reward. In this country ahme nearly 500,000 patents 
have been issued; they are increasing at the rate of about 25,000 per 
year. In the extreme multiplication of patents affe(;ting a large pait of 
everything we use, the whole world, it might almost be said, is ijaying 
tribute to the inventors and practical men; while to the original dis- 
coverers who have made so much of all this possible, there is no promise 
of pecuniary reward. 

This is not said by way of complaint. In the nature of things, it is 
scarcely avoidable. The aims, the motives, the methods, and the genius 
of the two classes of minds, are and ever must be Avidely distinct. Orig- 
nal discovereis can not be turned aside from their si)ecial work to be- 
come mechanics and inventors without infinite loss. Prof. Henry had 
one form of the electric telegraph in actual use some years before Morse 
conceived it.* But how great would have been the loss to science, 
without any corresponding gain, had Prof. Henry in 1830 turned away 
from pure science to do the subsequent work of Morse in adapting the 
telegraph to common and valuable use! 

Eesearch in pure science can never be made a self supporting pur- 
suit. It can never therefore be carried forward broadly, and contin- 
uously, and effectively, except through men sustained by some form of 
stipend or endowment. Occasionally, it is true, men of independent 
fortune, like Harvey, and Darwin, and Lyell, and Agassiz, have de- 
voted themselves to original research upon their own means, and have 
accomplished most important results. But these instances are rare. 
Many other persons, too, with aptitudes and tastes for research, though 
not following a scientific career, have carried on private researches ni 
the intervals of leisure, stolen from the exacting denninds of profes- 
vsional or business life; and these have, in the aggregate, added no 
small amount to the common stock of knowledge. 

It is no disparagement however of these subordinate workers to say 
that nearly all the great discoveries, and nearly all the great advances

along the lines of knowledge, have been achieved by men who in the 
main have devoted tlieir lives to the work, and have been su[))»oited 
througli institutions or endowments which made this devotion possible. 
Government ai)pointnu'nts, ])rol'essoriaI chairs, or salaried positions in 
seientilic institutions ol' some kind, have been and must continue to l)e 
our chief de[)cndcnce. And it is manifest that these can only be mam 
tained by (iovernment aid, or by the bount,\ of [uivate individuals. 
The former is mainly the European system; the latter, in the main, is 
ours. There, universities are founded by the government; here, chiefly 
by the ])eople. 

Ill Germany there arc twenty one universities maintained by the Gov- 
ernment. In each of tbese, as Dr. Lancaster states, there are five in- 
dependent establishments in the department of biology alone, viz, in 
physiology, anatomy, pathology, zoology, and botany. At the head of 
each of these establishments there is a professor, with two ])aid assist- 
ants, making altogether about 300 for biological research in Germany; 
and he estimates about oiie-(]uarter of that number in the same depart- 
ment in England. In all the sciences, therefore, there would probably 
be found in Germany from 800 to 1,000 persons of highscientiflc attain- 
ments, supported by the Government in the universities, who are regu- 
larly and systematically engaged in the discovery of new scientific trutk. 
For it is there made both the object and the duty of the ])ro6essors of 
natural science to carry on original investigations by work in flic lab- 
oratory. Their positions are obtained througli previous distinction in 
such investigations, and it is for this work that their small but fixed 
stipend is paid by the Government. 

In the College de France, also maintained by the Government, there 
is th(^- same requirement, though with a larger salary to the professors, 
and with the added duty imi)osed on them to deliver to the students 
aliout forty lectures yearly upon the subjects of the profess(n\s' re- 
searches; while in Germany the professors also receive from each stu 
dent who attends their lectures, a moderate fee, which serves to in- 
crease their meager sti])end, as well as to stimulate their activity and 
usefulness. lender this system, Germany has be(;ome the greatest 
school of science, and the resort of the whole world. 

In this country the ojiposite system prevails. TIm' colleges and uni- 
versities are mainly ])rivate fouii<lations, dependent on private gifts 
and endowments. The colleges ar«' unwisely muti])lie(l. All are more 
or less crampe(l for money. This limits the number of professors and 
assistants appointed for instruction, and crowds them with routine 
work. The result is that in all but a Jew colleges, and in these until 
comparatively recently, the duties of instruction have left to the pro 
fessors but little time or opportunit\ for the prosecution of original in- 
vestigations; and tlioe with l)nt i)oor equiimient :ind inadeipiate 
means. 

In not one of all our colleges and universities, so far as I luive been

able to ascertain, is there a single professorship endowed or founded, 
even in part, for the avowed object of original scientific research. In- 
struction, not discovery, is the only avowed object. It is to the great 
credit of American professors and teachers that, with so much routine 
work on their hands, and so little leisure for research, they should 
hav e accomplished by purely voluntary studies so mucli as is shown in 
their contributions to our scientific publications. 

To what is said above, perhaps a virtual exception should be made as 
respects our astronomical observatories, in which, the labors of in- 
struction being less, original work has been perhaps exi)ected, and 
has been accomplished with most signal success. To some extent this 
may possibly apply to our medical schools also. And in other depart- 
ments, generally, wherever time and o])portunity have been afforded, 
much original work has been done by our professors; some of it of the 
first class. This is attested, not to mention living instances, by the 
work of Prof. Henry at Princeton, Dr. Torrey at Columbia, Dr. Silli- 
man at Yale, Dr. Gray at Harvard, and many others that might be 
named. In a number of the States, also, and at Washington, there 
have been maintained by the State or Nation a number of scientific 
men, in connection with certain State or national interests, who have 
accomplished most important results ; of these. Dr. James Hall, of this 
State, is a conspicuous instance. At Harvard and at other colleges 
some noble opportunities for special study have been also provided in 
their scientific schools and museums;notably in the zoological museum, 
the Jefferson Physical Laboratory, and the Pejibody Museum of Archoe- 
ology at Cambridge, and also in the department of hygiene at the Univer- 
sity of Pennsylvania. But in most of these the great complaint is the 
lack of neccessary endowments to make possible the active advanced 
work in original discovery for which those institutions are designed. 
In the Peabody Museum there was in 1891 a gift of $10,000 by Mrs. 
Hemenway to establish a post-graduate fellowship; and also a gift of 
like amount by Mr. "VYolcott, for the general support of the museum's 
work. New York also has within a few years past seen spring up al- 
most as by magic, through the efforts of a single leading spirit, sec- 
onded by other x^ublic spirited men and women, and by municipal aid, a 
museum of natural history that bids foir to stand in the front rank of 
scientific opportunities; but the endownnents of fellowships ;ind pro- 
fessors necessary to make its opportunities available in active re- 
search are as yet wanting. 

England holds a position midway between the United States and 
Germany. Her scientific men lament her deficiencies. They are striv- 
ing to increase their means for scientific work, and are doing so yearly. 

If experience teaches anything, it is that no broad and general de- 
velopment of scientific work of the first class is possil)le, except either 
through independent establishments for special work, or else by the 
university system, in which professors in science and their assistants 
are first selected on account of their previftus distinction in original

research, and arc then a[)poiiited to (toiitinue that work, and in the 
teaching of students, to transmit to them the zeal of discovery and the 
true nietliods of advanci'. 

It matters litth' wlietlier tiie sui>j)ort ol' tlie university or of special 
institutions for research comes from tiie CTOvernmeut or from ))rivate 
endowment, jjrovided the provision is adeqnate and (constant. The 
ditticulty with us has been, and still is, that funds are insufficient, the 
means and ecjuipnuMit inade(|uate, and the time allowed to the pro- 
fessors for research insufficient. There has been too much of tlie 
schoolmaster, and too little of the real professor. Too great absorption 
of the professor's time in the work of instruction is injurious to both 
teacher and pupil. The most stimulating of teachers is he who by 
daily experiment is in vital touch with Nature, — he who brings from the 
fires of the laboratory the warmth, tlie illumination, and the inspiration 
of his own researches. 

This is now well recognize<l: and so far as their means will i)ermit, 
the leading colleges are by degrees relieving their professors of the 
work of elementary instruction, so that they may the better prosecute 
original researches, and at the sanu' time become l»est qualified for the 
highest work of instrm-tion. This system will doubtless demand 
watchfulness and discrimination. To prevent abuses, regulation and 
responsibility may have to be im])osed. l>ut it involves the appoint- 
ment of additional instructors. It re(inires added means. And this is 
in<lispensable as a part of the transition of our leading colleges to the 
university system. It is indispensable, also, if we are to have in this 
country any considerable systematic prosecution of original research. 
We must use existing instrumentalities and existing institutions. And 
all exi)erience shows that outside of the few (lovernment positions, and 
in the absence of special institutions for research, the professorial chairs 
are best adapted to such investigations. No greater service could be 
<lone to science than to make such endowments as should iiisnre sys- 
tematic and continuous resean^h by the professors as a part of the new 
university system. 

Endowments for the same object, and operating in the same line, 
might also take a difterent form, viz., the endowment of several pro- 
fessorial fellowships, each, say, of $1,(H)() annual income; to be con- 
trolled and awarded by some independent scientific body (such as this 
Alliance might afford) for distinction in active scientific investigations, 
either within the country or within the State. I know of no more 
quiclvcning impuls<; to original scientific research than sucli as would 
be given to it by thos(! means. 

How backward we have been in this country, through the lack of 
proper endowments, in making use of the best existing opportu- 
nities for research, may be illustrated by a single instance. Some 
twenty years ago a school was established at Naples for the i)ros<'cu- 
tion of marine biological research. Tt is most thoroughly equii)ped, 
and, being a general resort, is the most advantageous for study in 



628 ENDOWMENT FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. 

tlie world. It is maintained by a charge of $500 per year upon 
each table occupied, each occupant being entitled to all the ad- 
vantages of the institution. Of these tables, the German States for 
several years have taken thirteen ; Italy, eight; Austria, Eussia, Spain, 
and England, each three; Switzerland, Belginni and Holland, each 
one; the United States, until 1801, none, except one table supported 
by Williams College for two years, and one by the University of Penn- 
sylvania for one year. Prior to that time about fifteen other American 
students in all had obtained places at the tables taken and paid for by 
other nations. In 1890, this arrangement was prohibited by the admin- 
istration of the institution; and the right to a table in 1801, was secured 
to Americans, only through the private benefaction of Maj. Alex. 
Henry Davis, of Syracuse. For the year 1892, the use of a table has 
been secured through a subscription started by the American Associa- 
tion for the Advancement of Science, toward which the Association 
itself granted out of its scanty funds $100 and was the means, I be- 
lieve, of procuring the rest.* 

We have not however been wholly without some such means of 
study in this country through the marine biological laboratories estab- 
lished some years ago at Newport and at Wood's Holl, by Prof. Alex. 
Agassiz. The former has been now enlarged so as to accommodate 
eight advanced students, besides the i^rofessor and his assistant.! The 
Johns Hopkins University also has supplied some opportunities of this 
kind by its summer school, formerly at Beaufort; later, at Jamaica; 
but at present, as I understand, it is without any permanent location. 

Our neighbor, the Brooklyn Institute, has organized similar investi- 
gations, on a minor scale, during the summer months at different places 
on Long Island. But what is needed for the most effective work, is 
suitable endowments for jirofessors and advanced students, in eonuec- 
tion with an adequate biological laboratory, such as the Newport one 
enlarged might afford, equal in means and equipment to that at Naples, 
or at least to that recently completed, largely through private enter- 
prise, at Plymouth. England. J

tin liis address before the American Association for tlie Advancement of Science, 
in 1891, President Prescott, referring to this general subject, said: 

"To nurture investigation in science is the largest opportunity before the American 
people. Research, systematic and wisely directed, requires good organization and 
strong support, the support of many powers. It must have the support of able and 
persistent men. It needs the conference of workers, and the dissemination of knowl- 
edge in societies like this. It wants the interest and the confidence of the public. 
It asks and will always obtain the constant, helpful nsc of the press. It requires 
distinct provision in colleges, and in the institutions of higher education. It ought 
to be sustained expressly by the Government, both in the several States and under 
the United States, and sustained on broad and iiermanent foundations. Still, it 
needs private benelaotions. Research is the giowth of years. Let it be the demand 
of all, and let this call find utterance everywhere." — Proceedings Am. ^S80c.,1891, vol. 
XL, p. 440. ' •

II. 

Imiiiediately ooiinectod with onr colleges and universities is another 
liehl, in which additional endowments are greatly needed, viz: for fel- 
lowshi[)s in science for post-graduate studies. 

U})on the post-graduate Avorkers, the future ot science, and the re- 
cruits for future teachers ai;d professors, nuist necessarily depend. In 
that view the importance of post-graduate endowments in science can 
scarcely be magnirted. The great majority of the young men from 
whom all the new recruits must be drawn luive litth' or no pecuniary 
means. After graduating, often through many difliculties, they must 
face the question of their future calling. They must consider what 
promise of a reasonable and comfortable sui>port a life ilcvoted to sci- 
ence affords. If this lisk should not deter them, still there are many 
with talents of a high order who would be absolutely unable to proceed 
further in the advanced scientific studies necessary to qualify them to 
enter upon remunerative scientific work, or to obtain situations as pro- 
fessors or assistants, except by the aid of substantial endowments for 
their support, during the three or four years more of necessary assidu- 
ous study. 

In the stress of modern life, and in the allurements towards more 
certain pecuniary results, nothing but such endowments can avert the 
withdrawal from scientific ])ursuits of many young men of high promise, 
whose genius and tastes and ambition strongly incline them to science, 
and who would be secured to it if this temporary sui)port were afforded. 

The endowments of our colleges and universities in aid of ])ost-gradu- 
ate work in science are nuich less, I suppose, than is commonly 
imagined. I find no such suj)port for post graduate work in science, 
either at Cornell University, at the University of the City of New 
York, at Brown Univ<^rsity, at Amherst, or even at the Johns Hopkins 
University. No stalenient of the endowments (tf the new Clark Uni- 
versity at Worcester has as yet been ])nblished. I'riiUH^ton, though 
luiving a hundred undergraduate scholarships, lias bnt one j)ost-gradu- 
ate fellowship Ibi- science; Yale but two, — the Silliman and the Sloane 
Fellowships. 

('(tlumbia College iias two fellowships expressly restricted to science, 
viz.: The Tyndall l^'ellowship of ^(MS annually, and the Barnard Fel- 
lowship, before referred to, of about $500 annually. Besides these, 
however, twenty-four general uni\ ersity fello\vshii)S have been estab- 
lished, of $500 each, for post-graduate study, of which eighteen are in 
])resent operation. About one-third of these are assigned to science; 
making now eight for science at Columbia, with i)robably two more in 
189."> or 1894. In architecture, moreover, there are thr(;e additional 
noble i)ost-graduate fellowshi[)s at Coluud)ia, the Schermerhorn of 
81,300 annually, and the two Mcdvim Fellowships of $1,000 each, to 
sui)port study in foreign travel. In the Medical Department, also, 
there are five valuable i)rizes for proficiency. 



ri30 ENDOWMENT FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. 

The University oi Peimsylviinia lias the Tyndall Fe]h>wship, before 
referred to; and, m the Department of Hygiene, an admirable hibora- 
tory fitted up by Mr. Henry C. Lea, with a fellowship of $10,000 en- 
dowed by Mr. Thomas A. Scott, at present applied to original research 
in bacteriology. 

At Harvard, besides the three Bullard Fellowships of $5,000 each, 
established in 1801, to promote original research in the medical school, 
there are two post-gradnate fellowships restricted to science exclu- 
sively; namely, the Tyndall Fellowship of about $500 annually, and 
the income of the recently established Joseph Lovering Fund, the prin- 
cipal of which IS now about $8,000. There are also eleven other gen- 
oral fellowships, viz : The Parker, the Kirkland, and the Morgan Fel- 
lowships, available for promising graduate students in any branch, of 
which about five have been usually assigned to science. These fellow- 
ships give an income of from $450 to $700 a year. Harvard has also 
forty-six scholarships available for graduate students, varying in in- 
come from $150 to $300 each, of which about seventeen are assigned 
to science. During the last year, according to the report of Prof. 
Pierce, the dean, there Avere 193 applications for those post-graduate 
fellowships and scholarships, seventy-one of which were in science. 
Onh^ one-third of the applicants could receive the aid. The Dean adds : 

"The number of apjioiutinents is still very insujficient to meet the 
demands of promising students who wish to enter the graduate school 
and are unable to do so without assistance."* The tables i)ublished 
by him indicate that a considerable number of those not aided with- 
drew from science; and that many others who Avere entered for the 
first year in the graduate school, would, if not aided, afterwards leave. 
It is gratifying to observe the furthei' fact, so encouraging also for the 
young graduates who wish, if possible, to enter upon a scientific career, 
that all wdio had enjoyed these fellowships for the full term of three 
years, and did not continue their studies further abroad, at once 
received honorable positions. 

From the above synopsis it appears that in all these colleges (and 
I know of no other similar fellowships elsewhere) there are only about 
twenty-six adecjuately endowed post-graduate fellowships in science. 
As these should be continued for at least three years, there is provision 
altogether for only about nine per year — not one fouitli the number 
required to supply the annual loss in our 150 colleges, to say nothing 
of the in<'i<'asing demand through the growth and imiu^ovements in 
the colleges themselves. As it is from such specially trained students 
that the great professors of the future must be drawn, the need of 
much greater endowments forncM' recruits is apparent. 

In England the aids afforded by fellowships in their universities are 
familiar to all. Sir Isaac Newton, Avho is to modern science, what 
Shakespeare is m literature, Avas sustained from his student days suc-

On this sul)ject a most interesting" discussion took place last year in 
the French Academy of Science. On April 27, ISOI, the Secretary 
read the following extract from the will of tlie late M. Cahours, a de- 
ceased member of the Academy: 

"I have frequently had the opi)ortunity of observing, in the course 
of my scientific career, that nmny young men distinguished and en- 
dowed with real talent for science found themselves obliged to aban- 
don it, because before beginning they had no efficacious help which 
provided them with the first necessities of life, an<l allowed them to 
devote themselves exclusively to scientific studies. 

" With the object of encouraging such young workers, who for want 
of sufficient resources find themselves powerless to finish works in 
course of execution, - - - I becineath to the Academy of Sciences 
- - - 100,000 francs, - - - the interest to be distributed yearly 
by way of encouragement to any y(ning men who h.ave made them- 
selves known by some interesting Avorks, and more pai'ticularly by 
chemical researches; - - - as far as jiossilde to young men with- 
out fortune, not having salaried offices, and who, from want of a sufti- 
cient situation, would find themselves without the i»ossibility of follow- 
ing up their researches. These pecuniary encouragements ought to 
be given for several years to the same young men, if the Commissioner 
thinks their pnxhictions Inne sufficient value; - - to cease 

when they shall Ikim^ other sufiiciently remunerative p<isitions.'" 

M. -lanssen, tlien addressing the Academy, said: 

'•This affi)rds an examjde to all who hereaftei' may desire to encour- 
age the sciences by their liberality. M. Cahours, who knew the urgent 
necessities of science, had, like most of iis, become convinced of the 
need of introducing a new form of scientific recompenses. 

"Our ]n-izes will always continue to meet a great and noble necessity. 
Tlieir value, the dilliculty of obtaiuing them, and the eclat tliey take 
from the illustriousness of the body that grants them, will always make 
them the highest and most valuable of re<'omi)enses. But the value 
also of the works it is necessary to i)roduce in order to lay claim to 
them, forbids them to beginners. It is a lield oidy accessible to ma- 
tured talents. But ther<' ai'c many y()ung men endowed with ])recious

good to science. - - - These difficulties are increased every day by 
the marked advance of the exigencies of life. 

''We must hud a prompt remedy for this state of things, if we do not 
wish to see an eud of the recruitment of science. This truth is begin- 
niug to be generally felt. The Governuieiit has already created insti- 
tutions, scholarships, and encouragements, wliich partly meet the neces- 
sity. Some geuerons donors are also working in this manner. I will 
mention specially the noble foundation of Mile. Dosne, in accordance 
with whose instructions a hall is at this moment being built, where 
young men, having shown distinguished aptitudes for high administra- 
tion, for the bar, or for history, will receive for three years all the 
means of carrying on high and peaceful studies. Let us say then 
plainly (and in speaking thus we only feebly echo the words of the 
most illustrious members of the Academy), that it is by following the 
way so nobly opened by Cahours, that the interests and prospects of 
science will be most efficaciously served."* 

Huxley is said to have once stated that " any country would And it 
to its interest to spend $100,000 in first finding a Faraday, and then 
putting him in a position where he could do the greatest amount of 
work." It is the post-graduate endowments that must lirst find and 
retain to science the Faradays of the future. 

A notable instance of the need and value of such aid is found in the 
recently appointed head of a great university, who by such endowments 
alone, here and abroad, it is said, Avas enabled to prosecute his studies 
for ten years successively, reaching thereby the front rank in his chosen 
department of philosophy. 

111. 

Another department in great need of i>ecuinary support is that of the 
learned and scientific societies. Jn these England is pre-eminent. Our 
own societies ha\'e endeavored to follow, so far as they could, their 
English models. The English societies have rendered ti) science inval- 
uable service in three main lines: 

1. In providing ample means for the pnblication of scientific papers, 
showing the progress and the results of their scientific work. In this 
every society has taken part. 

2. In the direct maintenance of original research, in which the lloyal 
Institution has been most conspicuous. 

3. In the a^ard of prizes for scientific distinction; but still more 
important, in the distribution of pecuniary aid, for the prosecution of 
special scientific researches. 

(1) Of these, 1 regard publication as, i)erhaps, the most important; 
not only because it puts the world in possession of what has been done 
by investigators; but because the very fact that there are means of

piiblicatiou, is one of the jjn'utest incitements to eoiuplete and tlioiougli 
original scientific work. 

Of the I'^noJish societies tlie Koyal Society is the olch'st, haA'inii" been 
chartered in 1()(>2. It has jmblished 18L volumes of Transactions and 
aboufe 50 volumes of Proceed in y a. For these purposes, iu 1881 the 
expenditure was between *11,000 ami Jjsl2,0()(). It has property to the 
value of about two-thirds of a million of dollars, more than half of which 
is in trust funds, held for scientific uses. The income on the trust 
funds in 1891 was abont !^17,r)()0.* In 1828 Dr. Wollaston in giving* it 
slO.O()(> in 3 per cent, ccmsols "to promote scientific resear(;hes," 
charged ui)on the society "not to hoard the income parsimoniously, 
but to expend it liberally for the objects named." 

The Eoyal Institution of Great I>ritain was founded m 1779, largely 
through our countryman James Thompson, of Kumford, Vt., afterwards 
Count Rumford. In 1888 it had property and invested funds for general 
puri)oses to the amount of .*3r>0,0()0, and about s40,0{)9 of invested 
funds for the maintenance of its three i)rol'essors. In 1887 it expended 
about $2,090 in i)ublications, and it has issued about 40 volumes.! 

The Liinnean Society, now furnished by the (lOvernment Avith })er- 
manentaccommodations in Burlington House, free of rent, was founded 
by Sir James E. Smith in 1788, and is devoted to botany and zoology. 
Its property amounts to about 832,000, but it has no endowed funds 
for scientific investigation. For some years past its receipts, mainly 
from contributions, have been about ilO,000 a year, of which one-half, 
about $5,000, is spent on its publications, Avhich now number lu^.arly 50 
volumes of Transactio)i.s in (piarto, and as many more of its Journal. 
In 1888 87,000 were expended in publication.! 

Next in order of time is the IJritish Association for the Advancement 
of Science, founded in 1831. It is sustained chiefly by yearly contribu- 
tions. Its invested funds amount to about 802,000, Its income and 
coutributions are about 810,000 annually, out of which it approi)riates 
from 80,(M>0 to 87,000 per annum for the encouragement of scientific 
investigations, and about $1,800 annually for its yearly volume of pro- 
ceedings. Its publications now nnmber twenty -fiAe volumes.§ 

The Ray Society was founded in 1811. It was named after the liev. 
John liay, who lived IVom 1<)28 until 1705. Flaller, himself one of the 
greatest scientists of his time, Avriting in 1771, in the full light of Liu- 
naeus'fame, calls Ray " the greatest botanist within the memory of mau."|| 
The society has ]>ublish(Ml about fifty volumes of scientific works of the 
highest importance. I have not seen any statisti<;s concerning its means 
or acquisitions; nor have 1 found an,\- financial report of the scientific 
societies of Edinburgh or Dublin.

(2) Of these societies, only the Koyal lustitutioii (liiectly supports 
professors for scientific researcli. It lias two laboratories, one chemical 
and one physical. These were re-built ni 1872, "in order that original 
discovery might be more effectively carried on." The society was founded 
for the declared purpose of "promoting scientific and literary research." 
It has three professors, — one in chemistry, one in physics, and one in 
physiology. Bavy, Faraday, Tyndall, and others who have spent their 
lives there, have made its annals immortal. 

(3) In stimulating research by the api)ropriation of moneys for spe 
cific objects, the Eoyal Society and the liritish Association are the chief 
agencies. Besides some of its own funds, the Eoyal Society distributes 
annually £4,000, or $20,000, granted by the Government "for the ad- 
vancement of science." This has been done l)y applying it to numerous 
purposes; in 1891, for fifty-seven different scientific objects, in sums 
ranging from $25 to $3,000 each; not confined to natural science alone, 
but including ethnology and magnetic surveys. Most of the grants 
were in sums of about $35(> or less.* 

The Britisli Association has disbursed annually for the last forty 
years from $G,000 to $7,000 i)er annum, upon the same system of 
dividing it up for numerous specific puri)oses; usually from thirty to 
forty objects yearly, the grants being in sums ranging from $25 to $1,000. 
The grants are called for and expended for the specific purpose named, 
and under the direction of some prominent scientific man. Scientists 
like Sir William Thompson, and others of like renown, have had the 
administration of many of these grants. These have included for the 
last six years (save in 1890), the appropriation of $500 per year for a 
table in the I^ai)les Marine Laboratory.! 

We have no single society in this country, save the Smithsonian, that 
can rival in importance those that I have named in England. And the 
Smithsonian is not a society, but an institution, established by one 
man, and he an Englishman. This Institution, based uj)on the bequest of 
James Smithson, was founded by act of Congress of August 10, 1846. 
I doubt whether in any country or in any age the bequest of half a 
million of dollars has ever been followed by such beneficent results, or 
has ever so profoundly effected the life of science in any country, as 
the Smithsonian Institution has done in America during the last forty- 
four years of its existence. This has been owing (1) to the wisdom and 
the profound scientific insight of Prof. Henry, its first secretary and 
director; and (2) to the corps of able assistants and successors whom 
his spirit and policy have inspired. Its publications number 26 quarto 
volumes of Contributiotis to Knowledge, 40 volumes of Miscellaneous 
Collections, and 44 volumes of Annual Reports. Its Contribntions to 
Knoivledge rival, if they do not excel, in rarity and importance, the 
publications of any other society during the same period. Its expendi-

scientific work of the Institution, however, its intluence has been vevy 
great, especially in its relations with the other departments at Wash- 
ington, and as a medium for the prosecution of other scientific enter- 
jn-ises, under authority of Congress. Many of the a])propriations of 
Congress for scientific expeditions for researches in ethnology, pala'ont- 
ology, chemistry, and physics have been due to the presence and co-op- 
eration of the Smithsonian Institntion. For ethnologic researches 
alone, during the last twelve years, under the administration of the 
Smithsonian, C<mgress has appropriated $4:00,000; to paheontologic 
researches within the last three years, 8100,000; to chemical and ithys- 
ical research, 8(»S,000; and to astro-physical research, $10,000. Be- 
sides these, there have been for many years appropriations for main- 
taining the important investigations of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, 
ami of the Weather ]>ureau in Meteorology; and for the great scien- 
tific work of the Naval Observatory, and of the various scientific divis- 
ions of the Agricultural De]>artment and of the Geological Survey. 
Our (Government has been by no means inactive in science. 

The principal American scientific associations, omitting those of 
com])aratively recent origin, are the American Philosophical Society of 
riiiladelphia, originally founded in 1744; the American Academy of 
Arts and Sciences at Boston; the Boston Society of Natural History; 
the Academy of Natural Sciences, and the Franklin Institute, at Plul- 
adeli)hia; the latter founded in 1<S24 (see JoKviial, vol. T, i)p. 71, 120); 
the New York Academy of Sciences (a continnation of the Lyceum of 
Natuial History); the National Academy of Science at Washington, 
founded in ISO.'i; and the American Association for the Advaiu-ement 
of Science. Of these, the Philosoidiical Society has ])ublished 29 vol- 
umes of its Trmusactioois; the Ameri<'an Academy, 20 volumes of 
Tranmctionn and quarto volumes oi Memoira ; the Boston Society of 
Natural History, 2o volumes, at a cost of about $G00 per year; the 
Academy ol" Natural Science of Philadeli)hia, 48 volumes of Proceed- 
ings and 12 quarto volumes of its Jovrnal^ at an average cost of about 
$1,000 ])er year; the l^'ianklin Institute, l.'J.j volumes of its Journal; 
the New York Academy and its predecessor, about 30 volumes of 
Tro.nsaction.s and Annals; the National Academy, 3 (juarto volumes of 
Memoirs and some volumes of Proceeflings: and the American Associ- 
ation for the AdvaucenuMil of Science, about 40 volumes of Proceed- 
inf/s. 

The latter society had in 1S91 a "Eesear(;h Fund " of $5,2.14. {Pro- 
eredin</s 1801, p. 441.) None of the other societies, so far as I can find, 
lias any fund specially devoted to research, or makes any specific 
api)ropriations therefor. The National Academy and the Academj^ of 
l'hiladeli)hia have each some funds for their support, and the latter also

the Jessup Fund for students m science, on which the income is about 
$550 yearly. The Philosophical Society from time to time awards the 
prize established by John Hyacinth de Magellan in 1780, an oval gold 
plate, "for the most useful discovery or invention in navigation or 
science." One of the earliest awards of this prize was for painting 
lightning rods with black lead. 

The American Academy of Arts and Sciences awards a gold and 
silver medal from a bequest of $5,000, made to it by Count Rumford, 
who in 1796 made a similar bequest to the Royal Society. In 1888 this 
prize was most worthily awarded to Prof. Michelson for his researches 
in light.* 

The Boston Society of Natural History has a general fund, of which 
the income is al)out $0,000. It has also a small Walker prize fund 
and a grand prize fund, from which in 1881 it awarded a grand prize 
of $1,000 to James Hall, of Albany, ''for his distinguished services to 
science." It also administers the expenditure of about $2,700 a year 
for instruction in laboratory work, drawn from the Boston University, 
and $1,500 from the Lowell fund for the instruction of teacliers.t 

From this comparison of the voluntary associations, it ap])ears that 
the property, endowed funds, and equipment of the English societies 
named are nearly tenfold greater than the American, and their i)ubli- 
cations double; while for direct original research, our societies main- 
tain no laboratories and no i>rofessors, as is done by the Royal Institu- 
tion. The English societies distribute yearly from $25,000 to $30,000 
for from sixty to seventy-live di&'erent scientitic purposes, while ours 
make no such- appropriations, simply because they have no funds. To 
supply this deficiency there is need of large endowments. 

The publications of our societies are valuable; the papers have often 
been of a high character, rivaling those published abroad. But the 
funds availalde for publication are insufficient; it is always a question 
of means. There are a press and surplus of valuable scientific matter, 
which either is not printed at all, or only gets printed by si^ecial sub- 
scriptions for the purpose. This ought not to be. After valuable 
original matter has been produced with great pains and without hope 
of pecuniary reward, nothing is more discouraging to future research 
than that even publication can only be had as a charity. This I know, 
from repeated personal applications, is the condition of things in New 
York at this moment. It is not creditable that in a State and country 
like ours there should be practically nowhere adequate provision for 
even the publication of the researches of those who work for nothing 
but their love of science and its progress. There is very great need of 
a considerable publication fund, in the hands of some scientitic body, 
through which every valuable contribution to science, not otherwise 
provided for, might be ensured a speedy publication, after it has been

societies, after the model of the IJoyal Institution, should not in time 
be followed by results ecpially brilliant, and ('([ually l)enelicia] to nian- 
kiiul. 

I have cndeaxored to point out three main directions in which there 
is urgent need in this country of pecuniary endowments. 

(1) In relief of professors during the transition of the colleges from 
the school-master system to the university system, wlier«^by all profess- 
ors in science shall become actively enlisted in the prosecution of original 
discovery as a part of their duties. 

(2) In providing for the future recruits in science, by more endow- 
ments for i)ost-graduate study. 

(3) By endow'nu'uts of our scientitic associations, both directly to 
promote original research, and especially also to supi)ly larger means 
of X)ublication. 

It is gratifying to perceive what beginnings have been recently made 
in response to the needs of science. Only a short time since, in 1885, 
Mrs. Elizabeth Thompson, of Stamford, Conn., gave .|25,000 to a board 
of trustees of which Dr. IJowditch, of Boston, is president, for the 
'' advancement of scientitic research in its l)roadest sense." The in- 
come is annually distributed in sums of from two hundred to live hun- 
dred dollars. 

Mr. Ilodgkins, of Setauket, Long Island, has recently bequeathed 
to the Smithsonian Institution §2()0,0()0, the income of one-half of which 
is to be devoted to research into the properties of atmospheric air, 

Columbia College has, during the past year, received from Mr. I)e 
Costa's estate, before referred to, $100,000 for biology; Harvard, the 
Joseph Lovering fund, above stated; $10,000 from Henry I)rai)er forthe 
photogra])hy of stellar sjjectra; the endowments in arclneology, above 
named; and some smaller gifts for various scientific purposes. The 
University of Chicago and some otlun- institutions have also received 
important gifts, not to nuMition those yet to be realized toother colleges 
from the estate of Mr. I^'airweather. 

By a recent bequest of Charles Lenning, the Academy of Sciences of 
Philadelithia will, in time, receive §20,000; wiiilehalf a million of dol- 
lars will go to the ('niv<'rsit.\' of Pensylvania in aid of instructi(ni in 
theoretical and practical mechanics, and $200,000 to maintain scholar- 
ships. At this University, also, a superb structure foi- the"\Vistar

cost of about $200,000, including- endowments designed for original re- 
search.* 

Our reliance in tbis country nnist be mainly ui^on private endowments 
and an intelligent api)reciatiou of the needs of science. The national 
Government has douc, and is doing, niucli in certain directions. But 
aside from the dispositions of legislators, it is restricted by the provi- 
sions of the Federal Constitution, and by debated questions of constitu- 
tional right. State aid is not thus hampered; but State aid is difficult 
to obtain, to any adequate degree, on account of the previous habits, 
prejudices, aud political training of the people. ?^o doubt this ought 
not so to be. The State of New York ought, abstractly considered, to 
maintain one university of the first class equal in every department to 
any in the world. But the multiplication of institutions already exist- 
ing, local jealousies, and aversion to State taxation, make this now 
probably impracticable. 

The remedy is with the people, and through their own voluntary 
methods. It is the peoi)le who have made our Government, its insti- 
tutions, its methods, and the great aggregate, whatsoever it is, such as 
we see it to-day. Wealth is rapidly accumulating; much of it in the 
hands of those who, springing from the people, bear the love of the 
comnuinity in their hearts ; and when they and the peo]>le at large shall 
come to see that the cause of scientific advance and the discovery of 
all new truth are in the deepest sens<' their cause, responses will, 1 be- 
lieve, come to every urgent need; until the work of the people, by its 
own methods, shall, even in science, be able to confront, without shame, 
the best work of the monarchies of the Old World.

Mr. .Joliu D. Rockefeller to tbe University of Chicago, making $3,600,000 given by 
him alone to that institution within less than three years, a munificence hitherto 
unexampled in priA^ate endowments, some portions of which, it is hoped, will be 
available for the maintenance of original scientific research. 



THE INVENTORS OF THE TELECiKAPH AM) TELEPHONE.* 



P>y J'i(»r. Thomas (tRAY, l\ \l. S. E. 



Tlu' word tel<'.ui;i)tli was introduced about oiio hundred years ago as 
a name for a nnsnis ()(■con^cyin<;■ intelli^yence to a distauce by means of 
signs. Tlie signs were])ro(bi(*ed in a varic^ty of ways, as, for example, 
by the sliapes oi" positions of bodies j)hH'ed on liigh ])ok'S, or by letters 
or wurds of sutticient magnitude sindlarly ex)»os<'d. The meaning of 
the word telegraph, interpi-eted by its original use, wouhl thus be to 
write or make signs at ou^ place in such a way that they eould be read 
or interpreted at a distant place. It ai>pears, tlierefore, that so long 
as we coiitine our attention to early n)«4hods of telegrajjliing, tiie signs 
or signals were made at the sending station and read from the receiv- 
ing station. Modern usage gi\'es a slightly different meaning to the 
word, namely, a means of i)roducing visible, audible or written signs 
at a distaiu'e. That is to say, the signs are to l)e produced at the re- 
ceiving station. This was first accomjjlished on an extensive scale an<l 
at great distances by means of electricity. Methods of transmitting 
sounds, or even sp(!ech, to moderate distances by means of tubes and 
by means of what we now call string or mechanical teh^))hones have 
however been known for sevei'al centuries. 

^lethods of conveying intelligence to a distance have been known 
and used from very early times. Eires seem to have been the earliest 
means employed for giving signals, and we find such signs referred to 
in the writings of tlie Pro])het .Teremiah, of I'jschylus, of Polybius, and 
others. Schottus, in his Trchniea Curiosa, pro])Oses the application of 
the telescope to \iew posts er(^cted on an eminence at a distant staticm, 
and on which signs were to be placed. The Marcptis of Woicester, in 
his Cenfxry o/Jv/rew/y'oM.v, enumerates aday and anight telegra|)h; and 
Kessler, in his Concealed Arts, proposes to cut out letters in boards and 
nndve tliem visible at a distance by placing them over the end of a cask 
in which a light is burning; the letters or other characters being ex- 
])osed in proper succession any message can be transmitted. 

One of the earliest telegrai)hs of which we have now a direct repre- 
sentative was the Hag signals introduced about the middle of the sev-

640 THE INVENTORS OF' THE TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE. 

enteenth century by the Duke of York (afterward James II, of England), 
who was at that time admiral of the English fleet. This was the 
beginning- of the flag telegraph still used for communicating between 
ships at sea, originally introduced for the purpose of directing the 
man(euvers of the fleet. In 1684, Dr. TJobert Hook communicated to 
the Iioyal Society of London a proposal for a telegraph. In this 
method the signs were to consist of bodies of diflereiit shapes placed on 
high poles in an exposed position. Some years afterwards a similar 
method was proposed to the Academy of Sciences by M. Amontons, a 
Frer.ch natural philosopher. In 1767 Mr. R. L. Edgeworth proposed 
to telegraph by means of the arms of a wind-null, the positions of the 
arms of the mill to be used to indicate the signals. In 1784, the same 
author proposes to make the signals indicate numbers, and to interpret 
by means of vocabularies of numbered words. In 1794, tlie semaphore 
telegraph of M. Chappe was adopted by the French Government. This 
telegraph consisted of a high post and two bars of timber, the middle 
one pivoted to one end of the other, and the free end of this second 
bar pivoted to the toy) of the post, so that the whole of the motions 
could take place in a vertical plane. The positions, relative to the 
vertical or horizontal, of the two arms indicated the signal. These and 
other modifications of the semaphore have been at various times used, 
and are still used on railways for train signals. 

The chief interest of these early telegraphs — a great many forms of 
which might be enumerated — is in illustrating the fact that some means 
of conveying intelligence to a distance quickly and without a messen- 
ger has, from the earliest times, been recognized as of great importance. 
It is well also to keep before us the things that have been done in 
earlier times when we attempt to judge of the advances which have 
been made by modern invention. 

The telegraph of to-day is almost entirely electrical, and in its pres- 
ent form it is of comparatively recent growth. It may be well, how- 
ever, in this branch also to glance briefly at the early history of the 
subject. To begin with what we may call the fable i)eriod, we find in 
the year 1617 an allusion in one of Strada's Prolusiones Academics to 
the belief that there existed a sympathy between needles which had 
been touched by a species of loadstone, which caused them always 
to set parallel to each other if they were free to take up such positions. 
Two such needles, it was said, could be used to convey intelligence to 
any distance, because if they were pivoted on cards marked with let- 
ters or words and the card properly placed, so that corresponding 
letters occupied similar positions, when one needle was made to point 
to any letter or mark the other needle would immediately point to the 
corresponding mark on its card. The same belief is referred to by 
Galileo in one of his dialogues in 1632, and again by the Abbe 
Barthelemy in a work entitled "Voyage du Jeune Anarcharsis," pub- 
lished in 1788. So far this may be said to be mere fable, but it

Tlie discovery of Stephen (ira\. in 172'.>, that the eleetrieal intlnence 
conld be con\eyed to a distance by means of an insnlated wire, is ])rob-

a result of this discovery, and the investij^atioiis which followed it, we 
find a considerable nnmberof proposals to use electrical for<-es for the 
transmission of intelli<ieiic('. Tiie tiist of theseof which there is any

by Joseph Ijo/.oIus, a Jesuit and a lecturer on natural pliilosoi)hy in 
Iv'onie. (See a Latin i)oem, (Mititled ''Mariani Parthenii I^ilectrocorum.'" 
in \ 1 Libros, Koma, 17(57, p. 34.) In 1774, a telegraph on the same piin- 
ciple was established by Le Sage. In this system each wire t<'inii 
nated in a i>ith-ball ele<'troseo])e, and the .signals were read m accord 
anee with tin- indications of these electroscopes, of which twenty-four 
were used. This telegraph was improved upon by Lomond in 17S7, 
one wire only being used, and a code (»f signals Ibrining the means of 
interpretatio!!. A similar pioposal was made by Betancourt in the

.static electricity for telegraphic purposes seems to liave beeu lloiiakls, 
of Haraniersmith, iu 1810. In this telegraph the letters were printed 
on ;i disk which was mounted on the seconds arbor of a clock. One of 
the clocks avus placed at the sending an<l the receiving stations, and 
arranged to bring corresponding letters simultaneously opposite a small 
window ill the dial of the clock. When the proper letter was exposed 
a sigind was sent by means of a pith-ball telegraidi. This telegraph 
was more complicated than several which have been mentioned above, 
and re(|uired two clocks going synchronously. 

In the year 1767 an important observation was made by Sulzer. He 
found that when two plates of different metals were placed one above 
and the other below the tongue, a peculiar sensation and taste were felt 
when tlie metals touched each other outside the tongue. Sulzer failed 
to lind the explanation of this phenomenon, and no further advance 
was made until the Avell-known frog exijeriments of Galvani gave fresh 
impetus to the subject. The discoveries of Volta and the invention of 
the voltaic pile shortly followed. In the same year (1800) an attemiit 
to close the circuit of a voltaic battery by means of a drop of water led 
Nicholson and Carlisle to the discovery that water is decomposed by 
the galvanic current. 

This gave rise to the galvanic or electrolysis telegraphs of Sommer- 
ing. Coxc, and Sliarpe, and is the basis of all the chemical i)rinting and 
copying telcgiai)lis which have in more recent times been produced. 
Siimmering's telegraph was invented in 1809, and was similar in priuci- 
j)le to that of Morrison, except that the decomposition of Avater and 
conse(|uent accumulation of gas in a. series of tubes gave the necessary 
indications. To call attention, it was proposed in connection with the 
telegraph to liberate an alarm by means (»f an accumulation of gas. 

Prof. Coxe, of Pennsylvania, described a similar telegraph in 1810, 
and proposed to use either the decomiiosition of water or of metallic 
salts. Mr. J. E. Sharpe proposed a voltaic telegraph in l.Si;3, and 
exhibited it before the Lords of the Admiralty, ''who sp(>ke ajiin'ov- 
ingly of it. but added, that as war was oxer and nioiie\ scarce, they 
could not carry it into eft'ect. (See liepcrfori/ of Arts, Second Series, 
vol. XX IX, i>. 1'.").) 

Perhai»s the most iin]>ortant electrical disc(t\er\' in its iiiHuence on 
telegi'a])hy was made by lloiiiagnesi, of Treiite. in 1S(»5. but received 
little attention and no develojuneiit niitil it was re-discovered by 
Oersted in ISIO. This was the diseoNciy that a w ire conveying an 
electric current is capable of detiectiiig a magnetic needle. In the 

'lowing year Schweigger discoveie<l that the deliecting force was 
iiHM'cased when he wound the wire several times round the needle. 
These two discoveries formed the foiindatictn for the construction of the 
galvaiioscopes and gal\ anoiiieters since so much used in conne<'tioii 
with electrical api»liaiices and measuiciiieiil s. One of the most exten- 
sive applications has been to telegraphy^

telegraplis icsnlted vcr> shortly t'i<Mn tlu'sc <lisco\ cries. In iliis field 
ol" invention we find, prominent among the eail\ woikers, the distin 
liuished names of .Vin[K'i(', (iauss, and Weber. Am|»ei'e proposed a 
mnlti])le wire telegraph with iiahanoscope indicators in ISL'O. A modi- 
tication of Ampere's telegra])h was carried ont by Ititchic. and after- 
wards exhibited in Edinburgh by Alexander. In this telegra])h thirty 
wiles were used, twenty-six for the letters of the ali)habet, three for 
signs of punctuation, and one for the end of a word. The gailvau()Scoi)e 
needles eaoli carried a snnill screen wiiich in its normal i»osition cov- 
ei-ed the letter, but which, on the passage of a current through the 
wire, was drawn aside, ex])osiug the letter t(» \iew. The transmitting 
keys were arranged like the keys of a piano-lbrte. With the excep- 
tion of the use of galvanic instead of static tilectricity this telegraph 
was not much in advance of the pro])Osal of Morrison. A single cir- 
cuit telegraph was invented in tlie yenv 1828 by Tribaoillet, who also 
used a galvanoscopt^ as tln^ indicator. 

In 183U, a tive-needU^ telegraph was invented by Schilling, who also 
used a single needle and single circuit telegraph, using reverse cur- 
rents and c()nd)inations of signals for an alphabet. Models of this 
telegraph were made and exhibited before thi' Emperor Alexander 
and others, but Schilling unfortunately died before any pratrtical result 
was attained. In 183.), Schilling's telegraph w^as dexeloped to some 
extent by (iauss and Weber, who used it for ex[»erimental i)uri)oses. 
The cliief rnodilicat ion introdnce(l by these e\[>erinienters was the snb 
stitution of induced currents, pro<luced by the motion of a coil of wiie 
surrounding a bar nmgnet, for the galvanic cnrrejits used by Schilling. 
The following translation of a |)art of a report of the magnetic observa- 
tions of these ])hysicists given in Toggandorl's AhikiIcii. \xxii, p. 
5<58, is (pioted from Sabine's EU'ctrir Tclcf/rKpli: ••There is, in connec- 
tion with these ai langements, a great and until now in its way novel 
})roJect, for which we are indebted to Prof. Weber. This gentleman

town ((r(")ttingen) IVom the Physical Tabinet to the Observatory, and 
lately a continuation from the latter building to the Magnetic Obser\a- 
tory; thus an immense galvanic chain (line) is formed, in which the 
galvanic current, the two multipliers at (he ends being included, has 
to travel a distance ot' nearly !l.(MK» i Prussian) feet. The line wire is 
nH)stl\ of copper, of that known in commerce as •No. .'!," of whi(;h one

netic Obser\atory of copper, ■ No. 14.* silvered, and of which one gram 
measures L'. (I nn-ters. This arrangeim-nt promises to oiler oppoit unities 
for a number of interesting experinH'tits. We regard, not without 
ailmiration, how a single pair (tf plates, brongiit into contact at the 
furthei" end. instant a neonsly communicates a mo\emcnt to t he magnetic 
bar, which is deliected at om-e for o\'er a thousand di\ isions of the

scale." And further oil iu the same report: "The ease and certainty 
with which the manipulator has the direction of the current, and there- 
fore the movement of the magnetic needle, in his command, by means 
of the communicator, had a year ago suggested experiments of an 
application to telegraphic signaling, which, with whole words and even 
short sentences, completely succeeded. There is no doubt that it would 
be possible to arrange an uninterrui)ted telegraph communication in 
the same way between two places at a (considerable number of miles 
distance from each other." 

The method of producing the currents in (iauss and Weber's exper- 
iments was an application of the important discoveries of Faraday 
and Henry in the induction of currents by currents and by magnets, 
which have since borne so very important fruit in the held of dynamo- 
electric machinery. 

On the recommendation of Gauss this telegraph was taken up by 
Steinheil, who, following their example, also used induced currents. 
The important contributions of Steinheil were the discovery of the 
earth circuit, made while attempting to use the rails of a railway as 
telegraphic conductors; the invention of a telegra])hic alphabet and a 
recording telegraph. Of these the discovery of the earth circuit, made 
in 1837, has proved of great value. An interesting description of 
SteinheiPs telegraph, together with illustrations of the magneto-electric 
and recording apparatus used on the line erected in 1837, between 
Munich and Bogenhausen, Avill be found in Sturgeon's Annals of 
Eleclr'iclfy (vol. iii). This account, written, by Steinheil himself, 
shows that he had at that time an excellent appreciation both of the 
mechanical and electrical i)roperties wliich a good practical electric 
telegraph should ha^'e, and also that he was well versed in the knowl- 
edge then existing of electrical science. The relative merits of scopi*-, 
acoustic, and recording telegraphs are discussed, and the advantages, 
which experience has since brought into prominence, of the acoustic 
telegraph is pointed out. A very good discussion of the most econom- 
ical method of arranging signals for a telegraphic alphabet will also 
be found in this pai>er. 

Schilling's telegraph, which we have just seen, was the model on 
which Gauss and Weber's, and, therefore, also Steiuheil's telegraphs 
were based, was, as we shall see presently, also the basis of Cooke's, 
and of Cooke and Wheatstone's needle telegraphs. 

Previous to the date which w^e have now reached (1837), anotlier 
epoch-making diseovery had been made, which has had great influ- 
ence on telegiaphy. Tliis was the discovery of the magnetizing 
influence of the current. The discoNcry of Oersted was followed by 
Ampere in a long seri<'s of researches, in which, among other things, 
he establishe<l the mutual attractions and repulsions of wiies carrying 
<'urrents, tlie iact that tlu' voltaic element itself acts on a magnet like 
any other part of the circuit, and that a spiral of wire fiu-ming part

of a ciiciiit. would iiiaiiiicd/.t' steel iiccdU^^. In tlic saiiif year -M. 
Aia^d tomid tliat a w ire conveyinj^' an cleetrie current attracted iron 
filings, and in ISL'l, the law of the variation of niaunetic force with 
varyiiiii' distance from the wire was invcstigaled l>y I'.arlow. In IS2r», 
Stur<ieon found that a bar of soft iron was reudered teni]>orariIy iiiaj;-

law of the condnction of currents. In 1S31, Faraday in Enjiiand, and 
Henry in America, discovered the induction of currents by currents 
and by inajiuets. We see i'roni these h'adiiii;- facts that in the twehc 
years succeeding;' Oersted's discov<'ry the knowledge of electricity and 
of magnetism in tin- directions important for teh'g'iaphic ai>i)lication 
was \er.\ great, and we siiall see that it (juickly bore frnit. 

Schilling's telegiai)h was exhil)ite(l at a meeting of (ierman natu 
lalists held at Bonn in is;ij., and was there seen by Prof. Muncke, of 
Heidelberg, who, after his return to Heidelberg, made iiKxlels of 
the telegrai)h and exhibited them in his class room. These models 
were seen by Cooke in the early part of 1830, ami gave him the idea 
of introducing the electric telegrai)h in Knglan<l. Cooke iinmediat<dy 
set to work to construct a telegraph on a similar plan, and worked out 
a three-ne«'dle system of signals, which has been to some extent con- 
founded with the live-needle telegraph afterwards ])ateiite<l and 
introduced by him m conjunction with Wheatstone. While arrang 
iug for experiments on tlu^ Loudon and Manchester Railway. 
Cooke was introduced to Wheatstone, and afterward consulted him 
as to difliculties he had met with in his exi)erimeiits. A partnersldp 
soon followed, which led Wheatstone to devote considerable attention 
to the subject. The result has been the prodnction of a considerable 
variety of telegra[)hic ai)i)aratus of great value and ingenuity. 

Steinheil was anticipated in the idea of making the electric tele- 
graph self recording by Morse, of New York, who, according to a con 
siilerable amount of evidence brought forward by M(U-se himself, 
thought out some arrangement as early as l<s;>L*. Exactly what .Morse's 
first uleas were seems somewhat (hmbtful, and he did nothing till IS.'JS, 
when he made a rough model of an electro magin'tic r(HM>rding tele- 
graph. This telegraph consisted essentially of a pendulum, which 
carried a marking pencil on its lower end, and which could be detlected 
by an electro-magnet. The detiections of the ]>endulum were recorded 
on a band of ])aper, wliicii was moved forward by clockwork under 
the ])endnlum, and simple combinations of detiections were to rei)re 
sent numbers. The inter]>retation of the message was to be made by 
means of a telegraphic di<-tionary, in which the words. ])hrases or sen- 
tences were to be numbered. There was no hint at this time of the 
alphabet with which we are now so familiar as the "Morse Code" or 
the 'Olorse Aljihabet." This alphabet now almost universally used 
and which has ]>robably (hnie more than anything else toward ])erp<'t-

'' Morse System/' was not invented ]>y Morse but by Yail. who was 
assoeiated witb him in the <h'veloi)meiit of the teh\iiraph.* The die- 
tionary of nnmbered words pioposed by Morse Avas proposed by 
Edjieworth in 171>4:, in eonneetion Avith liis sema])hore telegraph. The 
model made in 1835 shows little meehanieal iugennity. The method 
of transmitting' the signals, which was by means of type moved 
thiongli a contact-making device, was somewhat crn(b^ and mnch less 
convenient than the simi)le make-and-break circnit devices of several 
previous workers; and the eleetro-magnet used to deflect the pendu- 
lum showed aluiost ccmiplete ignorance of the juinciples then known 
of electro-magnetism. Tiu^ chief points of interest in connection with 
the early history of the Morse telegra])h lie in the jnoposal to use 
electro-magnetism as the motive force to move the recording i)eiuhilum 
and the idea of nmking the telegraph self-recording. Morse made 
positive claims to have l)een the tirst to <lo both of these, and it seems 
proper that his claim should be examined. 

After the discovery of Sturgeon in electro-magnetism became kuown 
among scientific men the subject was taken uj) by Prof. Henry, who 
Avas then teaching physics in Albany Academy. An account of ])art 
of Henry's experiments was published in Silliman's Anwricati JonruHl 
of Science, for January, April, and -Tuly, 1S31. 

The following, among other things, were subjects of investigation in 
these experiments: The laws which govern the magnetizing effect of a 
helix under varying conditions as to number of turns in the helix, na- 
ture or arrangement of the battery, and length of the external circuit; 
the carrying power of magnets having different kinds of winding and 
different lengths of wire in the coils; the construction of an electro- 
magnetic engine. The transmission of power to a distance by means 
of his electro-magnetic engine. Among the a])])lications Avere the clos- 
ing of a distant electric circuit by means of the armature of an electric 
magnet, the coils of Avhich were included in another circuit passing 
through an operating or transmitting station, and the transmission of 
signals to a distance by causing the armature of an electro-magnet to 
strike a bell each time a current Avas sent through the coils of the mag- 
net from the transmitting station. Tlie latter of these a])i)lications Avas 
illustrated by nutans of a model ap]>aratus included in a long circuit of 
wire taken several times round one of the rooms in Albany Academy. 
The following claims made in this connection by Professor Henry are 
Avell founded, and dcser\-c ({notation :

It is to Henry, undoubtedly, that is i\i\v the credit m>t only of tirst 
pointiuii' out the application of electioina.iiiietism to tele.ui'aphy, but 
also of supplying; the recpiisite know lee li^c of how to make maj^iiets suit- 
able for the transmission of signals throiiiih lonji' distances, which ren- 
dered the ])ractieal application possible al that time. Hesides this, we

lirsl electro-maii'iiet ic sounder, which consisted of a ri'cei\ini; mai^net 
with a polarized armatuic. one end of wldcii was attracted by a ma.u-

The credit of in\ cntini;' the elect roniaunetic tele.L;iai»h was claimed 
by, and has usually been, popidarly at least. <;iven toM(U'se. There has

liowevcr. w lien giving' JMorsc due credit lor his oiigiiuility, to ignore the 
fiict that, althougli unknown to him, the seientitic part of the invention 
liad already been worked out by Henry, and besides that, through Dr. 
Gale, Morse actually made use of Henry's discoveries before he suc- 
cee<led in making his scheme practicable. Morse afterwards objected 
to Henry's claims, which were brought before the public by enforced 
testimony in the law courts, and not by any individual motion on 
Henry's part. The jtublic have lauded Morse aud have paid him liber- 
ally for the little he actually did, while it was with great difficulty that 
Congiess could be persuaded to inake a petty allowance to Henry's 
family, althougli he had been for man\' years a public servant, and 
besides had i)robably added more than any other man to the scientific 
reputation of the United States. Many people think that scientific 
men ought not to patent their discoveries. Which is the better known 
name, Henry or Morse? Would not Henry have gained both in popu- 
larity and in scientific reputation if he had patented and made the 
public pay liberally for his discoveries ? 

From the brief sketch Just given it will be seen that in looking over 
the history of the early endeavors to produce a telegraph many ideas 
have been brought forward as to codes of signals, alphabets, telegraphic 
dictionaries, methods of calling attention by alarm apparatus, methods 
of arranging and operating the circuits, and so <m, that only required 
an etficient motive force to render them ])ractical and reliable systems. 
In reviewing tlie subject, therefore, we are forced to the conclusion that 
the telegraph was not the invention of any man. but the result of a 
gradual growth toward which many minds, sonu^ of them the ablest 
tlie scientific world has known, have contributed. 

We have now reached a stage in the history of this subject when in 
ventors may be said to have had the fundamental i)rincii>]es of the sub- 
ject, as it now stands, before them and we have simply to look for de- 
velo])meuts. These developments have been great and of a very varied 
character. It is impossible in this address to do more than sketch a 
few of their leading features. 

As already stated, the telegraph of Schilling, through a model 
e\hibite<l by Prof. Muncke, of Heidelberg, gave the ideas of an elec- 
tric telegraph to Cooke in the year 1836. It appears, also, that Wheat- 
stone was aware of these early experiments, and had himself i)aid 
some attention to the subject. His experiments on the ^^elocity ot elec- 
tricity, made in 1834, are sufficient to show that he was at that time 
aware that signals could be produced at the end of long circuits of 
wir(^ by electrical means. The joint work of Cooke and AVheatstone 
led, within a few years, to considerable improvements in the needle 
telegraphs. The Aarious fi)rms of needle telegraph used l)y them, 
resulting in the final adoption of the single-needle system, for a 
long time extensively' used in P^ngland, were passed over in a few 
years. Various modifications of the needle telegraph were, somewhat

passed the jiohl leaf was detU'cted. and tlins s«'rved in pbiee of a>i 
index needU'. 

A patent Avas liianted to Wheatstone and Cooke in 1S4(I for improve- 
merits in givinji si.unals and sonndin>i ahuins at distant places by 
means of electric enrrents. In this ])atent the first form of the letter- 
showing, dial, or A, B, C teleiiraph. as it has been variously called, is 
described. Tm])ro\'ements were subsecpiently made in this api)aratns 
liy Wheatstone, and se\"eral modifications have been made by other in 
ventors, of which tlie best known are l!i"e({net's, Froment's, Siemens', 
Chester's, Kramer's, Siemens and Halske's. and llamblet's. The first 
ai)paratns devised by Wheatstone was actuated by voltaic electricity., 
l)ut in the later forms ma.iiiieto-electricity was ai)plied. One or other 
of these methods has been used in the other forms of apparatus for 
the same jinrpose. Wheatstone also worked on a type-printin.u' tele- 
ura})!), which Avas a modification of his A, !>, (' instrnment, but it 
ne\er came into practical us(\ Probably the .iixeatest achievement of 
Wheatstone, judjicd at least by its practical results, was his antomatic 
recording- telegraph, which is so largely used for press and other long 
dispatches in England, and which has attained to marvellons speeds, 
for a mechanical recorder. 

Morse's telegraph first came before the Patent Oflice in the form of a 
caveat tiled by him on the 3d of October, 1837. The following' iiiAen 
tions were specified: First, a system of signs by which numbers, and 
consequently words and sentences, are signified; second, a set of type,, 
adai)ted to regulate and communicate the signs, with rules in which 
to set up the tyi)e; third, an apparatus called the [)ort rule, for regu 
lating the mo\ement of the ty])e lules, which rules, b\' means of the 
type, regulate the times and the inter\als of the passage of electricity ;: 
fourth, a register, which lecords the signs i)ermanently ; fifth, a die 
ticMiary, or vocabulary of words, nund)ered and ada]>ted to this .sys- 
tem of telegrai)h; sixth, modes of laying (ronduclois to preseive them; 
from injury. 

This caveat gi\es a good idea of the invention by JNIorse (»f there- 
cording telegraph pievious to his }>artnershii> with Vail. The partner- 
ship was agreed upon in September, 1837, and accoiding to it Mr. \'ail 
undertook to construct at his own exi)ense and exhibit before a com 
mittee of ('ongress one of the telegraphs ''of the i)lan and invention of 
Morse;" that he should give his time and personal ser\ ices to tin- 
work, and as.sume the expense of exhibiting the api»aratus and of ])ro 
curing patents in the United States, In consideration. Vail was to re- 
ceive om'-fourth of all the rights in the invention in the United States.. 
Provision was also made for securing to Vail an interest in any foreign 
patents which he might furiush the means to obtain.* A large amount

gether with his conhdem-e in Morse's promises to do him justice, ]>re 
vented the matt«M- tVom being y)ubliel_v ventilated during the lifetime 
of the inventors. 

After se\'eral unsuccessful attempts to induce Congress to assume 
the exi)ense of building a line of sufticient length to practically test the 
])roposals of Morse, an appropriation of -t^O.OOh was made in March, 

1843. for the ])uri)ose of building a line from Washington to Baltimore. 
This line was com])h^ted and successfully (n»ened on the 24th of May, 

1844. The system practically introduced with the opening of this line, 
modified in some of its mechanical details, has continued to be the 
])rinci])al one nsed, and is the basis of umst of the recording telegraphs 
in all coTiutries. One important modification should however be men- 
tioned, that is the wide use of the click of the arinature for reading the 
message in preference to the recorder. This is a return to the electro- 
magnetic acoustic telegraph of Henry. It gives one of the simplest 
possible receiving instruments, and as was long ago pointed out by 
Steinheil, possesses the great advantage that it leaves the eyes of the 
o^ierator disengaged. Of other forms of telegrai)hic aj^paratus, the 
most important are the type printing telegraph. Among the early 
inventors of these we find Vail, who invented a type-printing' telegraph 
as early as 18.")7, and Wheatstone: but the fii'st instrTinient practically

.Another system of recoi'ding telegraph jnessages re(piires notice — 
that IS the chemical method. \\Clia\cseen that \ery early in tele- 
graphic history the decomi)osition of li(piids and of solutions of salts 
were made th(^ basis of telegraphs. [| was soon found that a ribbon 
of ])a]»er or cloth saturated with certain chemicals could be \-ery lead- 
ily marked by the passa.ge through tlu'in (»f the eh'ctiic current. One 
of Morse's tirst ])Ians appears to have been a chemical telegraph, but 
that, 1 belie\e, was nexer worked out. The first patent for such a 
telegraph was given in England to Edward l>a\y in is;>,s. l)iit the sys- 
tem never cann- into practical use. It was comi)licated in construc- 
tion and re(|uired four line wires. On«» interesting feature was the 
use of an (dectro-magnetic escai)ement for mo\ing the paper, an id«'a 
which had occurred to Cooke and to W'heatstone some years earlier. 
Tin' tiist successful chemical telegrai)h was due to Bain, (»f Edinburgh, 
and was patented in ISU;. In this system it wasproi>osed to transndt 
the message by an automatic transmitter, using a i>unched slip of 
]>a])er to regulate the contacts. Souw difficulties w ith the nu'chanical 
operation of ])rei)aring the lu^cessary stencil slips i)revent(Ml this l)eing 
very snccessfnlly nsed. but the chemical record was used for some 
years both in Englaml ami America. \N'ith the appaiatus in)W available

The chemical method of recordiuj; has been iiiostly used for copying- 
or autographic telegraphs, and of these a considerable number have 
been devised. The automatic method of transmission has been brought 
to a higli state of i)erfection. Among others who have worked at tlie 
subject are AVheatstone, Siemens and Halske, Gamier, Huniaston, 
Little, Edison, Park, Thomson. 

The next important step in telegraphy was the employment of one 
line-wire to convey moie than one message at the same time, A solu- 
tion of tlie problem of sending two messages, one in each direction, was 
attempted by (lintt of A'ienna, in 1853, and in the foll<»wing year by 
Frischeu and by Siemens and Halske. These methods were not very 
successful, but they Mere mechanically sufficient for the imrpose. 
They however left out an important item in the account, namely, the 
electrostatic capacity of the line. The ])roper solution of the ditticulty 
was given by J. B. Stearns, of Boston, in 1871, who solved the problem 
completely, so fai- at least as land lines were concerned. The same 
principle is sufficient for all purposes, but someimportantmodifications 
in detail are ne(;essary for submarine cables. These moditications 
were successfully made by Muirhead, of London, and at the present 
time duplex working is an ordinary accomplishment. The chief work- 
ers in this field were Fris<'hen, Siemens and Halske, Stark, Edlund, 
Gintt, Nystroin l^reece, Fur Nedden, Farmer, ]\Iaron, AVinter, Stearns, 
and jVIuirhead. 

Next the ju-oblem of sending two messages in each direction was 
worked out. This involves the additional problem of the simultaneous 
sending of two messages in the same direction. The solution of this 
problem was attempted by ])r. Wm. Gintt, of Aleuua, in 1853, and during 
the following ten years it was worked at by Borscha, Kramer, Maron, 
Schaak, Shreder, AVartman, and others. The first to obtain success 
was Edison, in 1874; and his method, Avith some modificaticnis, is still 
used. Systems of quadruplex were also invented by Gerrit Smith, in 
1875 and 1870, of the Western Union Company, and a modification of 
Edison's method was made by Prescott and Smith. Smith's 1876 
method is known as the AVestern Union Company's Standard Quad- 
ruplex. 

A system of nniltiple transmission w^as devised by M. G. Farmer, 
of Salem, in 1852, in which, by a commutation arrangement, the line- 
wire was ])ut snccessixely in contact with a number of local circuits. 
A similar system was exhibited by Meyer at the A^ienna Exposition in 
1873, and an improved form was introduced a few years ago by Delauy, 
which is in use in several countries. These systems are of use if the 
line-wire is capable of doing more work than any one of the stations is 
capable of sup])lying, and may be likened to one of the main wires 
from the central to a district telephone exchange, with this exception,

that all ilie corjcsixMideiicc iiocs (»ii siimiltaiu'oiisl_\ , and tlicii' need 
be no ditticulty as to precedence. Distinctive from these is the har- 
monic telejiiaplis of l^'Iisha Gray, Edison, and Uell. In this system, 
whicli has been 7nost comi)letely worked out. b\' Gray, any nnmber of 
messa<;cs may l)e sent simnltaneonsly. without reference to speed of 
transmission. In principle, the nn^thod consists in causing- «'ach of ;i 
number of vibrating- reeds at one end to i)ruduce pulsations of the cur- 
I'cnt flowing' thi'ough tlie line, wliich ha^e the same ]>ei-iod as the vibra- 
tions of the reed. A corresponding set of reeds at the receiving end of 
the line are arrangi^d so as to b<' acted on electro- magnetically by the 
(;urrent. Eacli of these recei>ing reeds will respond only to the i)ulsa- 
tions of its own natural i)erit)d, an<l hence only to the vil)rations of the 
corresponding reed at the sending end. The continuity of these vibra- 
tions may 1k^ broken up by means of a sending key, and thus a mes- 
sage transmitted iu the oi'dinary '']\lorse" al])habet. 

The autographic or writing telegraphic apparatus, which has been 
developed of recent years, is of great interest, both from the fact that 
the handwriting of the sender is reproduced in facsimile, and frctm the 
great ingenuity of the apparatus employed. The Avritiug telegraph of 
Cowper and the telautograph of Elisha Gray are good examples of this 
nn)de of transmitting messages. 

In Cowper's system two rectangular components of the motion of the 
peu are made to vary the resistaiu^e, and consequently the current, in 
two line wires. These currents act on two electro-magnets at the re- 
ceiving station, and the armatures of the electro-magnets are arranged 
to produce two rectangular comp(ments of the motion of the receiving 
pen. r>ands of paper are kept moving at approximately the same rate 
under <'ach of these ])ens, and hence tiie chaiacters traced by the nu)tions 
of the transmitting pen are reproduced with considerable accuracy by 
the recei\ing ])en in consciiuence of the varying positions of the arma- 
tures of the reccixing magnets, caused by the variations of tlie current. 
In Gray's apparatus t\\<> lectangular components of the motion of the 
transmitting pen s<'nd ])ulsatory currents into tlie line wire. These 
])ulsatory currents cause coircs])onding movements of the armatiir(\s 
of two receiving magnets, which are made to move the receiving ])en in 
corresponding directions, and through ])i<)poitionate distances. Sepa- 
rate electro-inagnetic arrangements lift tlie pen off the ]>ai)ei- l>etween 
the words and at the eml of tlie lines, and allow the icceiving jx'n to be 
moved backwards or foiwards withont marking the pajx'r. Still 
another electro-nnignetic arrangement is used to iiio\e the ])aper for- 
ward between the lines. The whole ap))aratus is exceedingly ing<'nious, 
l>ut iiiiich too exteiisixc iind coni|>li(at('d to admit of clear description

l)robleni!S weir of a nioie])urelyscientilif character than those preseiiteil 
in. the developments which had been in progress, and consecpiently 
tested the knowledge then existing- of the laws of electricity uinch more 
severely. It was very soon discovered, for example, that the rate at 
which signals conld be transmitted, and the l)attery power or other 
electro-motive force necessary to effect the transmission, did not, as in 
land lines, depend almost entirely on the size and length of the con- 
ductors used. The electrostatic capacity of the line immediately began 
to play an important ])art, and signals were found not to be transmitted 
so instantaneously as they were on existing- land lines. Again, there 
was no opportunity- of using' relays, so as to effectively shorten the lon- 
o-er lines, and the investigations of Thomson led him to point out that 
the rate of signalling- would be inversely as the square of the length. 

Such difficulties as these, cond^incd with the very evident difficulties 
involved in manufacturing and submerging a cable in deep water, were, 
to say the least, discouraging. Experiments on short lengths in the 
English channel and elsewiiere proving successful, faith in the possi- 
bility of longer cables grew, and very soon, through the enterprise of a 
few American and English business and scientific men, an attempt was 
made to hiy a cable across the Atlantic. The history of that undertak- 
ing and its various failures are almost common knowledge, but perse- 
verance concpiered all the diflfi<'ulties, and to-day no one thinks of the 
probability of failuie wiien a long cable is proposed. 

The laying of long cables brought out the fact that, as had been an- 
ticipated, existing telegraphic apparatus was not of great enough sensi- 
bility to render moderately rapid signaling possible. This difficulty 
was almost immediately met by the mirror galvanoscopic receiver of 
Thomson, followed some years later by his siplion recorder, which is 
undoubtedly by far the most sensiti\e recording telegraph known. 
Improved methods of working cables soon followed, among which, in 
the early days, probably the most notable is the introduction of con- 
densers between the ends of the cable and the earth by Varley. The 
successful duplexing of cables )>y :\luirhead has already been referred 
to, but it is somewhat curious to note that although the electricians 
interested in (;able working were familiar, as early as 185«>. and per- 
liaps earlier, with tiie difficulty which had prevented siTccess on land 
lines, no one seems to have thought of ai»plying the remedy. As early 
as IS.IS, a ])atent was taken out by Thomson, in Avhich he proposed to 
overcome the difhculity of (hiplexing <i cable by a. mechanical arrange- 
ment for varying the compensating currents at the same rate that tlie 
signaling current varies, lie lias since said that he did not propose 
the use of condensers, be<'ause a means of producing a sufficiently good 
model cable was not then known. Such a model cable was not avail- 
aide for nearly twenty years alter the above date, and was finally })ro- 
duccd by making pra<'ti<'iilly a copy of the actual cable, using tinfoil

The iii\enlion ol' the telephone constitutes one ol" the greatest a(l- 
\an(;es that have been uuule in telegTa]thic coiniuuiiication. This is an 
acoustic telegraph, which has tlie very inii)ortaut merit that the audi 
ble signals are si)oken words, and hence the instruments can be used 
1)\ anyone who can hear and speak and who undeistands the language 
in which the message is transmitted. 

It is well known tliat sound is transmitted through the air from the 
source to the hearer by waves of condensation and rarefaction, which 
affect the drum ol'the ear. Wheatstone, as early as 1831, showed that 
these waves could be transmitted from one i>Iace to another, at a mod 
crate distance, througli wooden rods and afterward conveyed to the 
ear by the vibrations given to the air l)y the end of the rod. Similarly, 
vibrations gi\-en to one diaphiagm can he conveyed to another, at a 
considerable distance, by connecting the two diai)hragius together by 
a stretched cord or wire. This appears to have been known for several 
centuries in the central districts of India, and a similar apparatus was 
described by Hook in 1(!07. .\ similar apparatus is now used and 
known as the nu'chani(;al telephone. 

To cause the \ ibrati(nis of one diaphragm to produce corresponding 
vibrations in another <lia])hragm at a distance, through the agency of 
an electric current, was the i)roblem of the electric telephone. The first 
to pro[)ose this seems to haxc been Charles liourseul, who, in 18r)4, sug- 
gested the use of two plates — one at the transjnitting station, which, 
by the varying pressuic of the air du<' to the sonnd waves, would oj)en 
and close an electric circuit; while the other was to be acted on at the 
receiving station by an electro-maguet, through which the coils of the 
electric curi'ent ]>assed. The \ar.\ing- strength of the electro imignet, 
(hie to the rapid succession of currents, was thus to ])e taken advantage 
of to give tlu^ ]U'oper succession of impulses to the receiving diaphragm, 
in ISCl Pliilij) ib'is. of l-'riedi-ichsdorf, proposed, in a lectuic deliNcrcd 
belbre the Physical Society of i'^rankfort. to use an instrument, w hich 
lu^ called a telephone, for tlu' n'|>roduction at a distance of nuisic and 
human speech. The a]»paratus consiste<l of a stretched nuMnbrane 
forming part of one side of a box, into which, by means of a mouth 
])iece, the sounds could Itc directed. This membrane w as made to open 
and close an elect riccircuit at each vibration. At the receiving end 
an electro-magnet, consisting of a thin rod of iion surrounded by acoil, 
was placed. The succcssi\-e interruptions and closings of this electric 
<-urrent was, in accordance with a discoxcry made by i)r. l*age. of Salem, 
Mass.. in ISMT, to jn-oduce sounds of the same pitch as those ol" the 
sound directed into the l)o\ of the transmitter. 'I'liis method failed for 
speech, for the simple reason that sjteech has more cliaracl«'rist ics than 
pitch; and it was only })artially successful tor musical soumls, froni its

inability to produce, with any approacli to iiccuracy, the necessary 
variations of loudness and (quality. 

To i)roduce not only the fre«iuency of vibration, but also the loudness 
and quality of the sounds evidently required a transmitter and a 
receiver which did not depend for its action on simple interruption 
of the current, but which varied it in an undulating manner, similar to 
the variations of ijressure to which the diaphragm receiving the sound 
vibrations was subjected due to the sound waves. Such an apjiaratus 
of a very x>erfect type was produced by Graham Bell in 187(!, who, in 
the descriptions of his apparatus given in his patent specifications and 
elsewhere, shows that he thoroughly understood what had to be done. 
We all know from actual experience that the instrument a\ hich he pro- 
duced did it. Since the publication of Bell's invention a great many 
modifications have been produced. Most of them have, however, been 
held to embody the same essential principle as that of Bell, the varia- 
tion being simply one of mechanical arrangement. One field of inves- 
tigation has, however, been fruitful of improvement. In the original 
patent of Bell, and also in a caveat filed almost simultaneously by 
Elisha Grayjit is pointed out that the variations of the current may be 
l)roduced by causing the vibrations of the diaphragm to vary the 
resistance of the circuit. This idea has proved of great value in increas- 
ing the loudness of the sounds given out by the Bell telephone when 
used as a receiver. A great many forms of these "-microphone" trans- 
mitters have been invented. Among those who have made im- 
j)ortant contributions we may mention Berliner, Blake, Edison, Gower, 
Gray, Huglies ami Hunnings. 

Another form of telephone has been ])ro})osed by Prof. Dolbear. 
In this telephone system one diaphragm of the receiver is made to 
form one plate of an electric condenser, and tiie varying electric force 
on this plate, due to the fluctuations of the charge, causes it to vibrate 
in res]>onse to the varying electro-motive force produced by the trans- 
mitter. This condenser telephone can evidently be used either as a 
transmitter or as a receiver, and, as Dolbear has pointed out, may be 
rendered sensitlv<' by keeping one plate of the condenser at a high 
potential. 

Another interesting discovery in this subject should be mentioned, 
namely, the transmission of speech from one place to another by means 
of beams of light or radiant heat. This was based originally on the 
discovery by May and Smith of the variation of the electric resistance 
of selenium when exposed to light or radiant heat. Many otlier sub- 
stances have since been found to have the same property in a greater 
or less degre<'. The experiments of Bell and Sumner Tainter have 
shown that if a beam of light be reflected fr(»m a thin mirror, and, by 
means of lenses oi' otherwise, made to pass as a i>arallel beam from the 
transmitter to the receiving station, and there received mi a bar or 
series of bars, or a coil of a substance having the pro])erties of selenium, 



THE INVENTORS OF THE TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE. 657 

the resistance of the selenium will be affected by vibration of the mirror. 
If, then, the mirror be used as a transmitting diaphragm, like that of 
a telephone transmitter, words spoken to the mirror will be repeated 
by a telephone in the circuit of which the selenium, is placed and 
through which aii electric current is kept flowing. 

In this address an attempt has been made to sketch very briefly the 
development of the application of electricity to the transmission of 
intelligence. Many important applications (as, for example, fire-alarms 
and railway vSigual systems, etc) have not been referred to, and a host 
of important contributors have, as a matter of necessity, been entirely 
iguored. To go into detail and do justice to everyone who has con- 
tributed to the present state of the electric telegraph was an imj)ossi- 
bility and has not been attem])ted.

EXPLORATIONS IX MONGOLIA AXD TIBET. 



By W. Woodville Rockhill. 



On the l.st of December, 1891, I left Peking for a journey in Mon- 
golia and Tibet, proposing, if possible, to traverse the latter country 
from north to south and reach British India — Sikkim or Xepah 

I was well provided with scientific apparatus, and very scantily with 
money, and so I started out with the anticipation of having to endure 
many discomforts, and possibly see my chance of ultimate success lost 
for want of a few hundred dollars and my collections poor for lack of 
funds and means of transportation. This is the one insurmountable 
difliculty a traveller can have to contend with; nearly every obstacle 
can be overcome or turned, but how to travel on an empty money bag 
(and an empty stomach, as it turned out in my case), in a strange land, 
is a more difficult problem for most men than the quadrature of the 
circle. 

I will pass over the first few stages of my journey, whicli led me 
through Chang-chia k'ou to the great emporium of eastern Mongo- 
lia, Kuei-hua Ch'eng, where I arrived on the ISth of December. 

This town was known in the T'ang period (a. d. 618-007), and how 
long before that I can Jiot now say. 

Col. Yule* thinks it was Tenduc, the capital of Prester John; but in 
this 1 can not quite agree, as I believe the latter town is to be identified 
wltli the i)resent Tou Ch'eng (in Mongol Togto), at the mouth of the 
I lei -ho, which flows by Kuei-hua and empties into the Yellow River 
(Huang-ho) at the former place. 

Father Gerbillon visited Kuei-hua Ch'eng in 1688, in the suite of the 
great Emperor K'ang-hsi. He describes the place as follows: "C'est 
uue petite Ville qu'on dit avoir ete autrefois fort marchande, et d'un 
grand abord, pendant que les Tartares d'Oiiestetoient lesmaitres de la 
Chine: a present c'est fort pen de chose: les muraillcs baties debriques

In 1844, Father Hue, when on his way to Lh'asa, stopped for a while 
at Kiieihua Ch'eug. He says of it: " With the exception of the la- 
maseries, which rise above the other buildings, one only sees an ag- 
glomeration of houses and shops huddled together without order, the 
one against the other. The ramparts of the old city still exist in their 
entirety, but the overllow of the population has been forced to cross 
them. Little by little numerous houses have been built outside the 
walls, vast quarters have been formed; and now the extra muros has 
acquired more importance than the city itself."* 

Fifty years hardly count in the life of an inland city in Asia, and 
Kuei-hua to-day is what it was in the days of Hue — an irregular mass 
of tumble-down houses built around a small central walled town. 
Dirty, muddy, unpaved streets, innumerable small shops, crowded 
streets along which loaded camels and mules and clumsy carts are 
moving, and where an occasional Mongol, very often much the worse 
for liquor, is seen accompanied by his women folk iu green satin dresses 
and much jewelry of silver and numerous strings of coral beads orna- 
menting their hair, neck, and ears. 

The chief industry of the place is, and has been for at least a cen- 
tury, the preparation of sheep and goat skins. Tallow is also an im- 
portant article of trade, and sheep and camels in vast numbers are 
annually sold here to supply the Peking market. The population, ex- 
culsively Chinese, of this place is probably between 75,000 and 100,000. 

On the 25th of December, having completed arrangements for con- 
tinuing my journey to Ning-hsia Fu in Kan-su in commodious carts 
like tliose which had brought me thus far on my way, I left Kuei-hua 
and in two days reached the Yellow River at Ho-k'ou,t where it makes 
a sharp bend southward. 

Crossing the river — here about 400 yards wide — on the ice, we first 
travelled over a country with sand dunes intersecting it here and there, 
and finally entered the vast alluvial plains which stretch westward to 
Alashan and are bounded to the north — on the left bank of the river, by 
a range of mountains of an average altitude of some 1,800 feet. This 
chain is called on European maps the Inshan (a corruption, 1 believe, 
of Ch'ing shan, a name given to the eastern part of it) and is locally 
known by a variety of names — as are all ranges in eastern Asia — Ta 
ch'ing shan, Wula shan, Lang shan, etc.|: 

For thirteen days we travelled through the sandy waste, now and 
then passing a small village of Chinese colonists settled in these Mon- 
gol lands, where they cultivate the soil after a great expenditure of 
labor on vast irrigation ditches, which are necessary to water the 
l)arched soil and which the sands, driven before the nearly incessant

westerly winds, are coiitiuually filling up. We saw but few Mongols; 
they live remote from the route, or when they have remained in their 
former haunts, now settled by Chinese, have adopted Chinese modes of 
dress and of living, and too frequently their vices. 

Some antelope, a few hares, and vast flocks of sand grouse {SyrrJiaptes 
PallasU) were occasionally seen; but what a sportsman's paradise 
these plains must have been in the days of K'ang-hsi, when Father 
Gerbillon came here with him to hawk and shoot, and the great Em- 
peror never failed to return to camj) with scores and scores of hares 
and other game killed by his arrows! 

Father Hue has so fully and graphically described the Ordos country 
that I will not venture to try and improve on what he has said, especially 
as one forms a more agreeable opinion of the country from his narrative 
than one would from what I might say of it. It has, I fear, changed 
for the worse since his time. 




Fig. 2. — Baron gomba or Hsi Knng miao Lamaist Tcmi>k" in tho Ordos country. 

The only place of any importance we saw was the palace of one of 
the Orat Mongol princes, the Hsi Kung or " Duke of the West," and 
near it a small but very handsomely built lamasery, the temple itself of 
pure Tibetan style. It is called by the Mongols, Baron gomba, and by 
the Chinese, Hsi Kung miao. 

On the 9tli«©f January, I reached the large Chinese Christian com- 
munity (some three hundred families residing in four villages) of San-tao 
ho-tzu, created and managed by the Belgi^ Catholic foreign mis- 



EXPLORATIONS IN MONGOLIA AND TIBET. 663 

sions. Here I remained two days and was most hospitably enter- 
tained by the bishop and fatliers of the mission. Tliis locality is in 
the domains of the Mongol prince of Alashan, colloquially designated 
by the Chinese as Hsi Wang or Western Prince, His people, so 
Ts'aidam Mongols have told me, inhabited in old times the country 
west of Hsi-ning Fu in western Kan-su, and are of the same stock as 
the Ts'aidam Mongols. This agrees with what Timskowski tells us, 
who says this tribe of the Eleuts came to the country they now inhabit 
in 1686.* 

Following the course of the Yellow River in a southerly direction, 
I passed successively through Shih-tsui (Hotun Jeli in Mongol), the 
first town on our route in the Province ot Kan-su, Ning-hsia Fu, 
Chung-Avei Ilsien, and finally reached Lau-chou Fu, the ca])ital of the 
Province of Kan-su, on the 31st of January, where I joined the route I 
had followed in lS88-'89 when on my way to Tibet for the first time. 

Xing-hsia Fu was the most important town we traversed before reach- 
ing Lan-chou, but it has greatly fallen from its ancient importance, 
having suffered terribly during the late Mohammedan rebellion.! 

Father Gerbillon, while journeying with the Emperor K'ang-hsi in 
1697, visited this city. He says it was then one of the largest and 
most famous along the whole length of the Great Wall. It was 
densely x)opulated, the houses built so closely together that there was 
no room even for court-yards. He also noted that '-building timber is 
here very cheap, because they go to get it in that chain of mountains 
which is to the northwest, some 60 or 70 lys from the city,| where it is 
so abundant that from the neighboring localities, more than 400 or "lOO 
lys away, they come to buy it at ]Sring-hia."§ At the present time not 
a forest tree is to be seen, only a few poplars recently planted along the 
irrigation ditches. 

The father says further on (p. 372) : " Tliey presented also to his 
majesty several foot rugs, resembling enough our Turkey carj^ets, but 
coarser; they are made here, and the emperor had the curiosity to 
have the work done in his presence, as also i)aper which is made at 
Ning-hsia, with hemp beaten and mixed with lime water." 

Now the town is, for half of its area, a desert of brick-bats, but rugs 
and paper making are still the chief— or rather the only — industries of 
the place. 

I arrived at Lan-chou the day after Chinese New Year and on 
the fifth of the first moon. I witnessed the ying.ch'un festivities, in 

"Op. cit., II, 279. See also Du Halde, op. cit., iv, 375, where we learn that the first 
Eleiit prince of Alashan had only the rank of Beileh and was named Batiiru Ts'o- 
nam. A Beileh is a prince of the third order, a Wanj; tiio second, and a ciiin Wang 
of the first. 

tThis city is called Irgd hotun by the Mongols, and is the Irghai of Mi)Ii.uiiinedan 
writers and the Kgrigaia of Marco Polo. 

t This range is called Hsi slian l)y the Chinese, Imt on our maps it is usually desig- 
nated liy the name of Alashan Mountains.

wMcli the local magistrates go outside the east gate of the city to 
''welcome spring" {ylng-cKun). A huge cow made of wicker-work 
and coated over witli mud was dragged along by scores of men, and fol- 
lowing it was the image of the god T'ai-sui. A man disgufsed as a 
woman led the procession on foot and folio sving him was another, in 
like disguise, riding a donkey. This one impersonated, I was told, the 
princess who introduced into China the practice of comj)ressing women's 
feet. Tlie cow was painted of a reddish brown color, a ]iortent that con-

flagrations would take place in the year now beginning, for the colors 
used on this occasion are symbolical, — yellow means ijlentiful crops; 
white, floods; black, sickness; and blue, war. In like manner, if the 
image of T'ai-sui is bare-headed it is symbolical of heat; with his cap 
on, of cold; if he Wears shoes it portends much rain and if he is bare- 
footed, dry weather.*

EXPLORATIONS IN MONGOLIA AND TIBET. 665 

Theatricals, a banquet at the magistrate's office, and merry-making 
followed. On the morrow the cow was broken to ])ieces and farmers 
began to till their lieUls. Tliis feast is-observed over most of China. 

Having engaged mules to carry me and my luggage to the lamasery of 
Kumbum, or rather the contiguous village of Lusar, some 20 miles 
south of Ilsi-ning, I left Lan-cliou on the 5th of February and follow- 
ing up the Yellow Eiver and the Hsi-ho, a route I had taken previously 
in 1889,* I reached my destination on the 11th, and took up my quar- 
ters in an inn in tlie lower part of the village and at once began prei)- 
aratious for the journey into Tibet. 

I secured the services of the men who had accom})anied me on njy 
first journey, bought six stout ponies and a supply of provisions — 
parched barley-meal {tsamha), rice, tlour, vermicelli, tea, etc. — enough 
to last, if used with economy, for about five months. While my head 
man, Yeli Chi-ch'eng, was buying pack-mules, fitting the saddles to 
their backs, and purchasing all the thousand and one little things re- 
quired on a long journey in a country devoid of every necessary of 
life save a few varieties of very coarse food, I went for a tour through 
the portion of country along the Yellow Eiver due south of Lusar, a 
region of great ethnological interest, inhabited by tribes of Tibetan, 
Mongol, and Turkish descent; those of the latter called Salars or 
Salaris, being particularly interesting, as they have retained their 
original type and language though residing on Chinese soil for the last 
four hundred years and surrounded by Chinese and Tibetan peoples.t 
They number some 40,000 souls and are the most fanatical Mohammedans 
in western China. The Salar priests (ahons) began the late jMohamme- 
dan rebellion in or near tlie little town of Bayanrong. Fortunately for 
the Imperial Government, dissensions arose among the Mohammedans 
and they were soon figliting among themselves. It was this way: One 
said smoking was permissible (he was a Ho-chou teacher), another said 
it was forbidden, and so tliey came to blows. At the town of Tankar, 
30 miles west of Ilsi-ning, these two factions fought so savagely that 
the authorities made use of this quarrel to rid the place of them. All 
the male Mohammedans were invited to the mos(iue to talk over the 
matter in the liresence of the colonel commanding the town. When all 
had assembled in the court-yard, there came men who called them out 
one by one, and as they issued out of the gate they were belu^aded, and 
in this way 3,500 were made away with. Their wives and daughters

tThe principal branch of this ]teopl6 forms now one of the Turkoman tribes un- 
der Knssian rule residing around Old .Sarakhs. It numbers a))out 5,000 families. 
"The three nations of the Salars are named Yalawach, Githara, and Karawan. They 
have an evil reputation even among Turkomans, and are said to be generally hated."

were sold or otherwise disposed of when good-looking, and Tankar, 
with a remaining population of a few thousands or so, enjoyed quiet 
once more. 

At Hsi-ning, for several years after the rebellion had been suppressed, 
no Mohammedan was allowed to enter the city (none of them could live 
in it) without having a stamp impressed on his cheek by the guard at 
the gate ; and even now, after twenty years of peace, none of them may 
have a knife, even the usual small one which is carried by all travelling 
Chinese in a little case with their chop-sticks.* 

On the 29th of February, I was back in Lusar, but though I used all 
diligence and expended a vast amount of energy, it was the 14:th of 
March when we made our final start for the Kokonor country, the first 
stage of our journey to Tibet. 




Fig. 4. — Chinese comjiosiiig Mr. Kockliill's iiarty. 

My party, as finally organized, comprised four Chinese, three of 
them frontiersmen from near Lusar, and one, a cook, engaged at Kuei- 
hua Ch'eng, and a native of Tung-chou, near Peking. We had two 
small blue cotton tents, and our saddle blankets formed the bulk of 
our bedding, for the very heavy sheep- skin garments we wore were 
enough covering for the coldest weather. 

* In the narrative of tlie journey of Benedict Goes (1603-1607) it is said that the 
Mohammedans at Su Chou (northwest Kan-su) were shut up every night within the 
walls of their own city, which was distinct from that inhabited by the Chinese. 
See H. Yule's Cathay and the Way Thither, p. 582. , 



EXPLORATIONS IN MONGOLIA AND TIBET. 667 

In oidor to keep tliei)ack-]iuiles in ^ood coiulitioii loins Ion;;' a time as 
possible, I liad tlie ,i»reater part of their loads carried by donkies from 
Lusar to the Muri-VVahon country, east of the Ts'aidam. Thence to 
Shaiii^', yaks relieved them, and in the Ts'aidam, camels did their work 
to a *;reat extent, so that when we started into the wilds north of Til)et 
my mules were still in fairly good condition — though very little fed — 
and stood well the terrible fatigues of the journey, but they finally gave 
out from foot-soreness and none reached the Journey's end. 

I began a survey of the road at Kalgan, north of Peking, and car- 
ried it on about L*,4()(> miles, to Bat'ang, in eastern Tibet, where my 
route joined that surveyed in 1877 by Capt. William Gill.* The method 
I followed in my work was to run the traverse by prismatic compass 
and aneroid, taking the distance between consecutive points by mj^ watch 
and controlling frequently the distances thus obtained by pacing them 
otf. 

Every day the altitude of one i^oint at least was determined by the 
temperature of boiling water, and all adjacent points, where aneroid 
readings were taken, were corrected by this and the one taken the day 
before. Sextant observations were made whenever possible for posi- 
tion, and thus the inevitable errors on my survey could not accumulate, 
but were divided over the whole length of the line. 

Besides the work of surveying I had to take pliotograj)hs, note the 
general characteristics of the country, keep an eye on the packs to see 
that they were not awry, and attend to innumerable details connected 
with the everyday life of the party. The animals gave me less trouble 
than the men (this is usually the case in this world, and how true is 
the saying, " Plus je vols les hommes, plus j'aime les betes'') ! 

In 1889, I had, wlien going to the Ts'aidam, taken from Lusar the 
route leading along the north side of lake Kokouor. This time I de- 
cided to follow a new trail leading through an unexjjlored country (that 
of the Panaka living south of the Kokonor), and thence directly by the 
mountains to Sliang, in the southeast corner of tlie Ts'aidam. I was 
most anxious to re-visit this place so as to be able to go once more to 
the Tosu nor (lake) and determine by actual observations its position 
and altitude. 

The nature of the country to the south of the Kokonor lake is more 
mountainous than that to the north, but the climatic conditions are 
the same — violent westerly winds, great dryness,' usually a clear sky, 
and though the nights are invariably cold, the temperature rises very 
high during the day. These peculiar conditions result from the high 
altitude of this region, which is over 11,000 feet above the sea level. 

The route we took was as follows: Leaving the i)rovince of Kan-su 
at Sharakuto, on the southern main feeder of the headwaters of the 
Ilsi-ho (which flows by Hsi-ning Fu), we traversed in a general west-

southwest direction the coiiutry of the Paiiaka or Panakasum, as the 
Tibetan tribes inhabiting these regions are called. These tribes, which 
were in past centuries located principallj^ south of the Yellow River 
all the way from the Chinese frontier to its sources at Karmat'ang, 
have within the last hundred years pushed northward and dispossessed 
the Mongol owners of these rich i)asture lands, driving them either 
into the foothills around the swampy Ts'aidam or nearer to the Chi- 
nese borders. The Tibetan tribes which first came to the Kokonor were

at the present time. The Arik (about 10, 000 families), the Konsa (2,000 families), 
the Bumtok (2,000 families), are the largest of these tribes living north and west of 
the lake; the principal tribes of the Panaka south of the lake are the Chamri, the 
Tubchia, and the Wutushiu.

the illustrations will enable the reader to form a better idea of tlieir 
camps aud general appearaiiee than could a long description. 

Crossing a high and very difficult pass in the southwest corner of the 
Panakasum's country, we entered the basin of the Tsahan ossu, an 
important river of the Ts'aidam, the existence of which Avas not here- 
tofore suspected ; and on the 4th of April I reached the Mongol village 
of Shang (or Shang-chia), on the upper Bayan gol (or Yogore gol), the 
main river of the Ts'aidam, which has its source in two lakes called 
Tosu-nor and Alang nor.

Sending the bulk of my baggage to the camj) of a former acquaint- 
ance, the chief or Dzassak of Baron Ts'aidam, I went with two 
men and a Mongol guide to explore the Tosu-nor, reaching that 
large vsheet of water (about i;i,oOO feet above sea level) on the 12th of 
April. 

Dowe, the Mongol guide, the same who had led me in 1889, by 
the sources of the Yellow Kiver to Jyakundo, told me one even- 
ing while we gossiping over the camp fire, that he had heard at Sa- 
chou of wild men {geresun Jam). Two had been captured by some 
IMohammedan Sifan (or Huang fjin), but one soon died and the other 
made his escape. These savages live between Sa-chou aud the

they dry. From this description I have no doubt these people are the 
half-wild inhabitants of Turki origin seen by Prjevalsky and other 
travellers in the marshes and canebrakes of Lob-nor. 

On the lith of April, I started back for Shang. Crossing the Yogore 
my pony broke through the ice and was drowned, I nearly sharing the 
same fate. The next day my saddle was recovered, also my notes and 
papers in my saddle-bags. On the 18th I joined my other men with 
the pack animals in the valley of Oim, where the Dzassak of Baron was

* See ''Land of the Lamas," p. 159. Douglas Forsyth, Journal Roy. Geo. Soc, xlvii, 
p. 6, says: "There are numbers of eucampments and settlements on the banks of the 
marshy lakes and their connecting channels; perhaps there are as many as a thou- 
sand houses or camps. These are inhabited by families who emigrated there about 
one hundred and sixty years ago. They are looked upon Avith contempt by true 
believers as only half Musselmans. The aborigines are described as very Avild 
people — black men with long, matted hair, who shun the society of mankind and 
wear clothes made of the bark of a tree. The stuft' is called "luff," and is the liber 
of a plaut called "toka chigha," which grows plentifully all over the sandy wastes 
bordering on the marshes of Lop." Wild men are said to live ou the lower Tsaugpo, 
in Tibet. The Mongol Lama Sherab jyats'o says that in Pemakoichheu (north of 
Mira Pedam) the Lh'opa "kill the mother of the bride in performing their marriage 
ceremony when they do not find any wild men, and eat her flesh." See Report on the 
Explorations in Sikkim, Bhutan, and Tibet, from 1856 to 1886, p. 7 ; also pp. 50 and 52.

camped. Here I was detained for eleven days trying- to make arrange, 
mentswith tlie cliief to supply me with pack animals and a guide to go 
to Shigatse, in Ulterior Tibet. After a vast and reckless ex])enditure 
of my limited store of patience, I failed to get more than four camels 
and a guide as far as Teugi'dik, a Mongol encampment in the marshes 
of the Ts'aidam, not a hundred miles away. 

On the second day out from Oim we left the village of Baron (or 
Barou kure) and travelling tlirough sand and mud and brush for four 
days came to the pools of Tengelik. Life 
in camp in this horrible Ts'aidam is miser- 
able indeed, and though I was used to the 
dirt and misery of such an existence, I had 
daily to use all my persuasive powers to 
keep myself in the belief that I would be 
able to stand it for six months more. The 
Mongols of the Ts'aidam have a saying that 
a Mongol eats 3 pounds of wool with his 
food yearly, a Tibetan 3 pounds of gravel, 
and a Chinese 3 quarts of dirt. Living in 
a Sinico-Mongolo-Tibetan style, I swal- 
lowed with my miserable food the dirt, the 
wool, and the grit, portioned by a harsh 
destiny to these peoples, and I verily be- 
lieve that I found enough wool in my tea, 
my tsamba, my meat, and my bread while 
in Mongolia and Tibet to stuff a pillow. 
The dirt and the sand could be easily swal- 
lowed, but the wool — nothing could be 
done with it, no amount of mastication 
could dispose of it. 

Leaving Tengelik on the 7th of May 
with four pack ponies, three oxen and a 
camel, the latter loaded with leather jars 
Idled with water, we reached the Xaichi 
gol in five days, travelling all the time 
through sand or swam]). 

On the Naichi gol 1 stopped for a few 
days to engage a famous guide of whom I 
had heard tell in Shang, and also to replenish mj' store of provisions 
as far as possible in this i)overty stricken country. We got a supply 
of fairly good tsamba, but the butter we here bought, made of sheep's 
milk, was the strongest smelling and the vilest 1 ever tasted in my life, 
but such as it was I had to eat it and be thankful till I reached the in- 
habited parts of Tibet in July. 

Leaving this place we turned south and following up the Xaichi 
River, entered the mountains which all along the south side of the 
Ts'aidam mark the northern edge of the great tableland dividing this

672 EXPLORATIONS IN MONGOLIA AND TIBET. 

country from Tibet, and is some 200 to 400 miles wide. Usually this re- 
gion is called Northern Tibet, and though physically it belongs to that 
country, from a political point it is a no-man's land, a desert waste over 
which at rare intervals wander some robber bands that prey on pass- 
ing caravans. 

It would take me too long to describe this part of my journey, in 
which we crossed four chains of mountains of an average altitude of 
about 16,000 feet. Between each of these, ia broad valleys running 
from west to east, flow shallow rivers over beds of soft sand or gravel 
in which we were forever getting bogged, we, our horses, and mules. 

Though we were in May and lovely June we had snow-storms and 
hailstorms daily, the nights were bitterly cold, and in the middle of 
the day the thermometer rose to the nineties. 

With no fuel but the droppings of wild yaks, with hardly any grass 
for our animals, to which we had daily to feed balls of our jiarched 
barley meal, it was no wonder we made slow progress, or that before we 
had neared the inhabited regions of Tibet our supx)lies gave out and 
we had to subsist for five days on tea alone. On the 7th of July we 
saw for the first time black tents and I learned, on sending two of my 
men to one of them, that we were among the Namru in ISTamru de, a 
dependency of Lh'asa at the northwest corner of the great Tengri nor 
(or, as the natives call it, Dolma Kam-ts'o). My plan had been to go 
around this lake to the west, and had our provisions held out a fort- 
night longer I have no doubt we would have succeeded, so sparce is the 
population of this region, and reached our goal, Shigatse, the capital 
of Ulterior Tibet. To accomplish my plan it was necessary to make 
detours around every camp we sighted, for I knew of the stringent 
orders issued by the Lh'asa government against admitting foreigners 
onto their soil, and I entertained no hopes of seeing them modified in 
my favor. Unfortunately our supplies did not hold out and so, when 
we made these first Namru tents and asked for food we got only a 
few haudfuls of tsamba and a little cheese. The news rapidly spread 
that a small, but very suspicious looking party, had arrived from the 
northern desert. The next day, after making some 12 miles more 
in a southerly direction and reaching a broad valley dotted all over 
with tents, we were stopped by the local headman and ordered to re- 
main camped where we were until the officers of the Lh'asa govern- 
ment, who resided about a day's ride away, could come and cross- 
question us. 

This was on the 8th of July. By the 13th it had been decided that 
I was to go under escort of a detachment of soldiers, not the way I had 
planned, but by a circuitous route (of considerable geographical interest 
however), to the higli-road leading to Lh'asa from Hsi-ning, joining it a 
little to the north of the first Tibetan station, IS^agch'u or Nagch'u-k'a, 
where there was a high official, a warden of the borders, who would 
settle about my further movements. 

For ten days my escort took me in a general easterly direction over 



EXPLORATIONS IN MONGOLIA AND TIBET.

the foothills of the great Dang la chain, which we frequently saw to 
the north, its peaks covered with eternal snows reaching for down 
their Hanks (the snow line in this country being at about 17,500 feet 
above sea level). We crossed a number of streams, all flowing in a 
southeasterly direction and probably forming the head waters of the 
Jyama-nu ch'u, the upper Salween, it is believed. The rain fell daily 
in torrents, the spongy, tnssocky ground was soaked, and dry fuel no- 
where to be found, so that tinally we had to burn our pack saddles to

boil our kettle. In an utterly exhausted condition, we reached, on the 
li2d of July, the highroad to Lh'asa in the Dang ch'u valley, a day and 
a half's ride north of JSagch'uk'a. 

Here the Namru men left me, but I was soon espied by some of the 
guards stationed along this road for the very i)urpose of arresting for- 
eigners, and requested to remain where I was till the officer in command 
at Nag ch'u could come and see me. 

Before this I had been obliged to give up all idea of carrying out my 
original i)lan of getting to India, and I had now solely in view reaching 
China by some heretofore unexplored route which would keep me in 
fl. Mis. 114 43

the inhabited parts of Thibet, so that my ethnological researches could 
be successfully carried on. 

While waiting- here on the Dang ch'u for the arrival of the Nag ch'u 
officials, I was visited by some natives from the left bank of the river, 
and I learned from them that they and the tribes to the east of them 
were not subject to Lh'asa, and that by traversing their country (called 
Jyade or "Chinese Province") I could reach the important town of 
Ch'amdo, on the highroad to China, whence I would be able to continue 
my journey commodiously to Tachien-lu in Ssil-ch'uiui. 

I at once made up my mind to follow this route, only waiting to see 
the Nag ch'u officials to satisfy my curiosity, and possibly pick up some 
interesting details concerning them, their country, and its customs. 

On the 27th of July, I crossed the Bang ch'u and was kindly received 
by the chief of the Pere band, who, on the following day, introduced 
me to one of the big chiefs or Debas of the country, Norjyal-tsan by 
name, who was about to start for his home, a fortnight's ride to the 
east and on the road to Ch'amdo. 

It was arrauged, after a short consultation and the presentation to 
him of some presents (50 ounces of silver, some knives, red lacquer 
rice bowls, etc.), that he would take me with him, and see to all my 
wants on the way. On reaching his home he would further supply me 
with a guide as far as Mer djong, the first locality on Ch'amdo terri- 
tory, beyond which neither he nor his people ever went; and he gave, 
among other reasons, for this that, while the Ch'amdo people professed 
lamaism, he and the people of Jyadt' followed tlie Bonbo religion, the 
modern and corrupt form of the old pre-Buddhistic shamanism, which 
has, at one time or the other, prevailed over all Asia. 

Since leaving the Ts'aidam in May, I had continually travelled over 
country with an average altitude of about 15,800 feet above sea level, 
frequently crossing ridges and plains considerably higher. On leaving 
the Dang ch'u we very gradually descended till we reached near 
the Eama-ch'u, the timber line on the 12th of August, something 
over 13,000 feet above sea level. At this altitude cultivation also be- 
gan, barley and turnips being the only crops. These are eked out by 
the use of seeds of several kinds of plants found growing in profusion 
on the hillsides. Above this altitude the people subsist entirely on 
what their flocks and herds of yaks can supply them, the neces- 
sary tsamba and tea, being ])rocured by tlieni at Lh'asa or from traders, 
who annually visit these regions. The principal article of trade of the 
Namru and other adjacent tribes is salt, procured by evaporation from 
some of the large lakes to the west of the Dang la and brought thence 
on the backs of sheep, each one carrying about 25 pounds. All the salt 
I have seen in these parts is of a brick-red color and very impure. 

On the 20th of August, we reached Mer djong gomba on Ch'amdo 
territory, having traversed the whole of Jyadc without any mishaps, 
and having met everywhere with the greatest courtesy and kindness 
from the chiefs and people. The country round Mer djong is, where-

vxer possible, well cultivated, barley and wlieat are the principal crops, 
and near each of the houses is a little ji-arden-patch, where we saw with 
<lelight cabbages, onions, i)eas and turnips, but we noticed no domestic 
fowls J these are found only in the Chinesitied portions of the country. 
From :\rer djong, we went to Eiwoche (a dependency of Lh'asa) <m 
the Tse ch'u. passing through some beautiful alpine country (along the 
Ke ch'u), the mountain sides covered with tine forest growth and the 
valley bottom a mass of flowers of every hue. Frequently we saw large 
bunches of silver pheasants (Crassoptiloii tibctanum, in Tibetan Saga), 
moving rapidly about in the thickets of rhododendrons and laurel-like 
plants, calling their young with a cry peculiarly like that of the guinea 
fowl. Very few varieties of birds were uoticed however here, or, in 
fact, anywhere along the route, singing birds being especially rare.

Eiwoch(i is a place of some importance commercially, but from a pic- 
tures(pie point of view it is especially noteworthy for its peculiar temi)le, 
Avith walls of wliite and red,;indgokl spires rising from its green-tiled 
roofs. Around the temple are the dwellings of some tliree hundred 
lamas, near which are the houses of iierliaps a hundred fainibes of lay 
men. The village is at the base of steep, forest-clad UKmntains, and 
])efore it flows the swift river. This place is one of the few in Tibet 
Avhich can boast of a wall around it; it was built by the Chinese, in all 
probability, about 1717. 

Two stages down the Ze ch'u valley brought us to Xyulda, a Chinese 
post station on the highroad to Lli'asa, where the soldiers supplied us 
with the first eggs and vegetables we had had for many a long month.

We were now about two and a half days journey from the town of 
Ch'amdo, which I was not however destmed to see, for when I had 
advanced towards it another day's ride, I was stopped by the lamas of

that place, and requested to take a cross road leading around the town 
at some distance and joiuing again the highway to China near a place 
called Puiig-de. 
1 refused to follow this road and tinal,ly obtained permission to take

another trail over the mountaius to the south, Avhich brought us out, 
after four days of travel through the most beautiful scenery T know of 
anywhere in Tibet, at the post station of Pung-de, the Pao-tun of the 
Chinese. 

The worst pait of my long journey was now over, for from this ])oint 
I travelled in comparative conifort, Avith an escort of ('hinese soldiers, 
relays of pack and saddle horses, and houses every night to put up in; 
though I still frequently preferred my tent, where I coukl enjoy some 
l)rivacy and escape the attack of the fleas which swarm in all Tibetan 
dwellings, to say nothing of rats and other vermin. 

The first town of any importance we came to after leaving Riwoch^ 
was Draya, or Chamdun Draya as it is also called, the capital of an 
ecclesiastical, semi-independent state, on an affluent of the Om ch'u, 
which flows by Ch'amdo. 

The town is prettily situated on a gentle slope, the lamasery, as 
usual, occupying the higher part of it, with a little plain in front, 
beyond which flows the Ombo ch'u, here met by two other streams* 
of considerable size. The crops were ripening and fields of barley 
and wheat covered every little patch of ground susceptible of culti- 
vation. On high frames, with which every country house is provided, 
grass twiste.d in cables was drying for the winter's forage, and in 
some places, where the high precipitous mountains did not over- 
shadow the fields too much and the crops were early, barley, wheat, 
and turnips, were already hanging on these frames, which are used 
everywhere in Tibet for this purpose. 

Though I was very roughly received at Draya — in fact, in lieu of 
fire-crackers I had a volley of stones let off at me as I entered the 
town — I remained here for two days and gathered a good deal of inter- 
esting information bearing on both the country and the ])eople, which 
it is not possible to convey here, and for which I must refer the reader 
to my complete report now in preparation. 

On the Oth of Septend)er, I left Draya, and after an interesting jour- 
ney of five days, up hill and down dale, reached the important town of 
Gartok, or Chiangka as it is called by the Chinese, the chief town of 
the province of Merkani belonging to Lh'asa. It is curicms in this con- 
nection to note that vassal states, governed by oflicials sent by Lh'asa, 
are found scattered all over Tibet; the Nyarong or "arable lowlands of 
the Nya River," the Tsarong, Riwoche, and innumerable localities in 
southern and southeastern Tibet belong to this class. 

These districts have frequently given in their allegiance to Lh'asa (or 
"tied their head," go-ta-tva, as they say) on account of similarity of re- 
ligious beliefs. Sometimes, however, Lh'asa has got possession of them 
through intrigues or open aggression. 

Gartok is an imi)ortant center for the musk trade, whidi of late years 
has taken considerable extension. It has a nati\-e jxtpulation of al)Out 
seven hundred, besides some two hundred or three hundred lamas. 



678 EXPLORATIONS IN MONGOLIA AND TIBET. 

From a liiiudred to a hundred and thirty Chinese also reside here, all, 
or nearly all, of them having native wives. 

Wheat, oats (wild?), and barley are grown here extensively, and the 
gardens supplied us with cabbages, turnips, and several other kinds 
of vegetables, one, called in Chinese o sung, I found especially pala- 
table. Cats, pigs, and fowls were seen in every house, and I was pre- 
sented by the Chinese officer in command of the little garrison here 
with grapes, peaches, and apricots (wild varieties, I believe), brought 
herefrom the Rongmi, or ^Herres chaades,^'' as the French missionaries 
call them, some two days' distance down the Eiver of Golden Sands 
(Chin-sha ho or Chin chiang ho). 

For the first time in Tibet I saw house sparrows {cheuha, in Tibetan) 
at Gartok. 

Leaving Gartok on the 12th of September, we reached Bat'ang on the 
15th, and here the geographical j)ortion of my work was at an end. The 
people between Gartok and Bat'ang are Chinesified to a considerable ex- 
tent, and have also a few customs introduced among them from inter- 
course with the tribes living south of them, Lissus, Mosso, and others. 
Among other things borrowed from these tribes is a peculiar jew's-harp, 
carried by every Avoman of this region, and consisting of three different 
toned harps of bamboo ; two or three women often play together, and 
to this accompaniment they dance a slow, shuffling step in which grace 
and beauty are conspicuously absent. 

I remained at Bat'ang four days, and then proceeded to Lit'ang, 
which I reached on the 24th, and finally arrived at Ta-chien-lu, on the 
Chinese frontier, on the 2d of October. From this locality to Shanghai, 
where I arrived on the 1st of November, I followed the route taken by 
me in 1889, and for a description of which 1 must again refer the reader 
to the pubHshed account of my first journey. 

Before closing this brief account of my journey I must mention that in 
July, when on the Dang ch'u (and even earlier, when in N^amru), I heard 
that some foreigners had passed through the country some six months 
previous, coming, it was supposed, from the west. In August I again 
heard vaguely of these travellers, and on the 18th of that month, while 
camped near the Ze ch'u at Lah'a in Nar peihu, I was shown by a native 
a note he had received from a foreigner commanding an expedition which 
had passed through here several months before. It was signed Capt. 
Henry Bower, of the Seventeenth Bengal Cavalry, and he had come, I 
learned later, from Lndak byway of the deserts to the northwest of Tibet 

Since then I have had the pleasure of meeting Capt. Bower in Lon- 
don, and we have been able to compare notes. From this compari- 
son it results that after the 10th of August (I had then reached the 
I ch'u Valley), our routes were very nearly parallel till we arrived near 
Ch'amdo, after which point they were identical. 

Finally, I would like to call attention to the rich fields of research 
China and its dependencies afford the explorer, be he geographer, bota- 
nist, geologist, or ethnologist. Though volumes enough to fill a goodly

maiustobe done. Our geotirapliical knowledgre of China is still based 
on the surveys of the Jesuits, executed in the seveuteeutli century, to 
which a few itineraries have since been added. Puinpelly, Eichthofen 
and a few others have only studied the geology of a i)art of tliis vast re- 
gion ; its botany is less well known perhaps than that of any other i)art of

dreds of writers, has never, as far as I know, l)een systematically treated, 
and the scientific study of tlie languages of China is only Just begun. 
Of the scientific results of my journey I will here say nothing; they 
Avill be submitted in the report which T am at present preparing, to- 
gether with a route map on a scale of KJ iiiiles to an inch, reduced from 
my original survey. The illustrations accompanying this paper are 
from photographs taken by me on the journey, and of which I secured 
some two hundred fairly good ones. 



PKOGRESS OF ASTRONOMY FOR 1891 AND 1892. 



By William C. Winlock. 



A review of the i)rog:ross of iis^tronoiiiy for the years 1879 and 1880 
was contributed by Prof. E. S. Holden to tlie Smithsonian Report for 
1880. and reviews for each succeeding' year were continued by hini in 
the annual reports of the Institution up to 1881:; the reviews for 1885 
and 1886, and for 1887-'88 and 1889-'90 were prepared by the present 
writer, the publication since 188(5 being biennial instead of annual. The 
arrang^enieut of the review for 18yi-*9i; is essentially the same as in 
previous years and, in its compilation as hitherto, notes in recent jour- 
nals have been freely drawn upon without specific citation. 

It should be borne in mind that the review is intended for tiu)se having 
a general interest iu astronomy rather than for the professional astron- 
omer who has access to a large working library. To the latter the 
bibliography ajjpended may be found convenient as a reference, and 
will supi)lement the text in giving- a general idea of recent publications 
on any special subject. Many very important papers are of such a 
nature that they do not lend themselves readily to condensation for the 
purposes of such a summary as the present. 

Within the last few years many new aids have been i)rovided to 
facilitate reference to the constantly-increasing volume of the litera- 
ture of the subject. The most comprehensive of these is to be found 
in the Bulletin astronomiqiie, i)ublished under the auspices of the 
Paris Observatory and the able editorship of M. Tisserand. In addi- 
tion to extensive critical reviews of important memoirs, tliere is a brief 
summary of the contributions to other astronomical i)eriodicals, and 
the whole is made easy of reference by an admirable index (wherein 
most journals are defective) at the close of the year, which, in fact, 
to a large extent, sui)plies a bibliography of astronomy for the year. 
The Journal of the British Astronomical Association contains a sum- 
mary of current periodical literature, the value of which to the mem- 
bers is abundantly vouched for. The rublications of the Astronomical 
Society of the Parifc contains a great number ol' admirable reviews or 
notes, and this department is receiving increased attention iu Astron- 
omy awl Astro}) hysics. The Observatory has perhaps the most com- 
plete notes, without an attempt at a systematic summary of current

literature, to be found in English, while the excellent reviews in Nature 
and the more popular notes of the Athenwum need no special comment 
here. The Astronomische Nachrichten and the Astronomical Journal 
contain occasional notices of important works. 

The '^iSTotes on some points connected with the progress of astron- 
omy during the past year" in the Monthly Notices of the Eoyal Astro- 
nomical Society have been increased in scope and fullness, and as the 
reviews in difterent branches of astronomy are furnished by specialists, 
these notes form a most valuable commentary on the year's work. The 
Vierteljahrsschrift der astronomischen GeseUschaft is, of course, the crit- 
ical astronomical review, and is the recognized authority for summa- 
ries of cometary and planetary discoveries. 

STELLAR SYSTEMS. 

The Milky Way. — The independent researches of Prof Pickering at the 
Harvard observatory and of Dr. Gill at the Cape of Good Hope have 
led to the conclusion that the stars of the Milky Way form a veritable 
sidereal system, separate and individual. This conclusion is entirely 
opposed to the views Sir William Herschel reached from his earliest 
observations (1785) which are still generally received by those who 
have not given much attention to this special question. Miss Gierke 
points out in the Observatory for September, 1891 (p. 302), that "the 
study of nebular distribution might alone, and long ago, have driven 
out of the iield every form of ' projection theory' of the Milky Way. 
For it showed the great majority of gaseous nebuhiB to be embraced 
within its circuit, and this alone amounted to a demonstration that a 
physical reality, and not simply a geometrical appearance, was in 
question," 

A brief statement of the arguments of Prof. Pickering and of Dr. 
Gill is contained in a lecture by the latter delivered at the Koyal 
Institution of Great Britain, May 29, 1891. Dr. Gill said: 

I pass now to another recent result that is of great cosmical interest. 

The Cape photographic star-charting of the Southern Hemisphere 
has been already referred to. In comparing the existing eye estimates of 
magnitude by Dr. Gould with the photographic determinations of these 
magnitudes, both Prof. Kapteyn and myself have been greatly struck 
with a very considerable systematic discordance between the two. 
In the rich parts of the sky, that is, in the Milky Way, the stars are 
systematically photographically brighter by comparison with the eye 
observations than they are in the poorer part of the sky, and that not 
by any doubtful amount, but by half or three-fourths of a magnitude. 
One of two things was certain, either that the eye observations were 
wrong, or that the stars of the Milky Way are bluer or whiter than 
other stars. But Prof Pickering, of Cambridge, America, has lately 
made a complete photograiihi(^ review of the heavens and by placing 
a prism in front of the telescope he has made pictures of the whole 
sky. . . . He has discussed the various types of the spectra of the 
brighter stars, as thus revealed, according to their distribution in the 



PROGRESS OF ASTRONOMY FOR 18i)l AND 1892. 683 

sky. He finds thus that tlie st;irs of the Sirii(<i ty])e occur cliietly in the 
Milky "Way, whilst stars ot other types are fairly divided over the sky. 

Now stars of the Sirins ty]>e are very white stars, very rich ri'lative 
to other stars in the rays which act most stioiii;ly on a iilioto,ur;i])hic 
plate. Here then is the explanation of the results of our photoj^raphic 
star-charting, and of the <liscor(lance between the photographic and 
visual magnitudes m the Milky Way. 

The results of the Cape charting further show that it is not alone to 
tlie brighter stars that this discordance extends, but it extends also, 
though in a rather less degree, to the fainter stars of the Milky Way. 
Therefore we may come to the very remarkable cinielusion that the 
Milky Way is a thing apart; and that it has been developed perhai)s in 
a difterent manner, or more probably at a different and probably later 
ej)och from the rest of the sidereal universe.* 

NEBT L.E. 

In a paper by Prof. Keeler, comnninicated to the lioyal Society by Dr. 
Huggius on March 19, 1891, the question of the position of the chief 
nebular line seems to be definitely settled. Prof. Keeler has not only 
made a series of sixteen complete measures, obtained on eleven nij^hts, 
of the chief line in the spectrum of the Orion nebula, thus defining its 
apparent position when corrected for the earth's motion, as X 5()0().22 ± 
0.014, but has supplemented these by ten measures of the green iiydro- 
gen line on seven nights. The latter show the nebula to be moving 
relatively to the solar system with a motion of + 10.7 ± 1.0 miles per 
second, and oblige us to fix the true position of the chief line at ^- 5005.93. 
The chief line is therefore 0.13 tenth meter more refrangible than the 
lower edge of the magnesium fluting, and as it has no resemblance to 
a fluting in appearance, and as flutings and lines of magnesium, which 
could not fail to appear at the same time with the fluting at A 5006.36 
are entirely absent from nebular spectra, the incorrectness of the view 
that the nebular line is the remnant of the magnesium fluting appears 
to be demonstrated. 

Mr. Rurnham has made a set of measures of the nebula in the 
Pleiades close to the star Merope. He remarks that it is one of the 
most singular and interesting objects in the heavens. With respect 
to its nearness to a bright naked-eye star (the distance between the 
centers is less than 40") it is unique. There may be other examples, 
but certainly no other has ever been discovered, and this close asso- 
ciation of a faint nebula and one of the prominent stars of the Pleiades 
is an interesting fact, whether such association is accidental or other- 
wise. The accurate measures made by Mr. Burnhani and Mr. Barnard 
will enable this point to be ascertained when others shall have been 
made sometime hence, and it will be p(>ssible to determine by comi)ar- 
ison whether the new nebula is drifting in space with Merope and the 
other stars of this famous group. We have, of course, many examjjles 
of large stars involved in widely diffused and extended nebulous masses, 



"Publications of the Astrouoinical Society of the Pacific, 19. 



684 PROGRESS OF ASTRONOMY FOR 1891 AND 1892. 

but 110 instance lias hitherto been known of a star bright enough to be 
visible to the naked eye having a small definite nebula within even sev- 
eral times the distance of this from Merope. 

ASTRONOMICAL CONSTANTS. 

The Constant of Aberration. — Prof. Oomstock, of the Washburn Ob- 
servatory, has been making careful trial of a modification of the method 
of determining the constant of aberration first suggested by M. Loewy. 
The essential feature of M. Loewy's method is the introduction of 
reflecting surfaces in front of the objective of a telescope, by means of 
which images of different portions of the heavens are simultaneously 
produced in the focal plane of the objective. By means of the microm- 
eter the apparent distance between the images of two stars thus pro- 
duced may be measured, and the angular distance between the stars 
determined from a simple relation involving the measured quantity and 
the angle included between the reflecting surfaces. It is obvious that 
great difficulties would attend the determination of this angle, and M. 
Loewy avoids these difficulties by measuring the distances of two pairs 
of stars and taking the dift'erence of these distances, thus eliminating 
the angle between the mirrors. Prof. Comstock has found it advan- 
tageous to place before the objective three reflecting surfaces instead 
of two, making approximately equal angles among themselves, and to 
employ successively each pair of surfaces in measuring the distance 
between two given stars. If the normals to these surfaces all lie in 
the plane passing through the two stars and the earth, the mean of 
the three dihedral angles formed by the surfaces will be exactly 120°; 
and by taking the mean of the results furnished by the three pairs of 
surfaces the distance between a pair of stars may be determined in- 
dependently of the angles between the mirrors. Prof. Comstock's pro- 
visional result for the constant of aberration is 20".494 iO".Ol7. 

MM. Loewy and Puiseux's work on the Constant of Aberration is 
summarized as follows in a communication to the Comptes Rendus for 
March 16, 1891. 

1. Struve's value 20".415 is very near the truth. It would, in our 
opinion, be premature to alter it. 

2. M. Fizeaii's result, that reflection does not affect the behavior of 
rays with regard to aberration, is confirmed. 

3. The new method for determining aberration can be regarded as 
satisfactory and definitive. 

STAR CATALOGUES AND CHARTS. 

The Star Catalogue of the Astronomische Gesellschaft. — The zone under- 
taken by the Harvard College Observatory +50° to +550 declination 
has been published as the fifth part of the great catalogue. The obser- 
vations were made with the new meridian circle in the years 1870-'78 
and 18S3-'84, chiefly by Prof. W. A. Kogers*, under whose direction 



PROGRESS OF ASTRONOMY FOR 1891 AND 1892. 685 

the reductions liave also been made. The riglit ascensions were 
observed chiono<jiriiphically over eleven vertical Avires, and the declina- 
tions also chronographically over an inclined wire, the circle being 
read by two microscopes. The probable error of an observation in 
1870-'78 is ±0.8054: in right ascension and ±0".~)ii in declination, and is 
rather greater for stars fainter than the eighth magnitude than for 
brighter stars. 

The fifth volume of the Annals of the Leyden observatory contains 
thesecondhalfof the zone observations between 4-30° and -f.'^oo — em- 
bracing ten thousand observations. 

The Faris Catalogue. — The second part of this work, containing the 
places of stars from 6^^ to 12'' of right ascension, has recently been 
issued, the first part having been iiublished in 1887. There are really 
three catalogues, the first comprising observations from 1837 to 1853 
reduced to 1845.0; the second, those made from 1854 to 1867 reduced to 
1860.0, and the third from 1868 to 1881 reduced to 1875.0. The stars 
are arranged in the order of right ascension at 1875.0. A valuable 
memoir on the proper motions of the stars contained in the catalogue 
has been prepared by Bossert. 

Second Munieh CatalogKC. — A second catalogue, containing 13,200 
stars for the epoch 1880.0 has been published under the direction of 
Prof. Seeliger supplementary to the larger catalogue recently issued. 
The stars are from the seventh to tenth magnitude within 25° of the 
equator, and were observed with the meridian circle during the years 
1884 to 1888. The positions depend upon Auwers's Fundamental Cata- 
logue. 

Pulkoica Catalof/ue. — The Pulkowa catalogue of 5,634 stars for 1875 
is deduced from observations made with the meridian circle during the 
years 1874-'80, and prepared for imblication by Herr Komberg. The 
stars are of various classes, including many of the Struve double stars. 
A comparison is made with the places of several other catalogues. 

Oeltzen's Catalogue. — A new editon of Oeltzen's catalogue of Argel- 
ander's southern zones, — 15° to — 31°, has been published by Prof. 
Weiss. Tlie total number of stars is 18,276, the positions being given 
for 1850.0 with the amount of the precession necessary to bring them 
to 1875.0. The places of stars north of —23° have been comi)ared with 
Schonfeld's Southern Dnrchmusterung, and south of that limit with 
other catalogues, thereby eliminating a considerable numb<'r of errors 
fronj the original ])laces. 

Ba;(1dic]cer\s map of the Milhy ^Vay. — Dr. Bteddicker, of the Karl of 
Rosse's observatory at Birr Castle, has been at work since 1884 upon 
an elaborate map of the Milky Way from the North Pole to 10° south 
declination, an<l has at lengtli finished this very laborious task. His 
plan has been to exhibit the ramifications of the ]Milky Way as it ap- 
pears to the naked eye, a necessary first step to the knowledge of the 
structure of the sidereal universe. No optical help has been used.

PROGRESS OF ASTRONOMY FOR 1891 AND 1892. 



STELLAR PARALLAX. 

Prof. Pritt'hard has continued in Part iv of tbe publications of tlie 
Oxford University Observatory liis work upon tbe photographic deter- 
mination of stelhir paralhixes. He has conchided "from actual and 
prolonged experience that an accuracy, amplj- sufficient in the present 
condition of astronomy, is secured by observations of each star made 
on twenty-five nights advantageously selected throughout the paral- 
lactic year, four exposures being usually made on each night." 

The general result of the investigations of the parallax of thirty 
northern stars of the second magnitude is that the average parallax of 
a star of the second magnitude is 0."056; and comi)aring with this 
the result of Drs. Gill and Elkin for the average parallax of fourteen 
first magnitude stars, viz, 0."089 we see that there is distinct evidence 
that the brighter stars are nearer — though it should be borne in mind 
that the heliometer was used by Drs. Gill and Elkin, and the photo- 
graphic method by Prof. Pritchard. 

Following is a tabular statement of the Oxford results. Two results 
a and h are obtained, from two comparison stars ; the j)robable error 
of each result is about zk0."025:

. Determination of stellar parallax tcith a transit instrument. — Prof. 
Kapteyn has published a paper of much interest, upon the determina- 
tion of relative stellar parallax by observations of the differences of 
right ascension between the selected star and neighboring comparison 
stars made with the transit instrument and chronograph. The compar- 
ison stars are selected of about the same declination as the star whose 
parallax is to be determined and symmetrically situated at slightly 
greater and less declinations. The differences of right ascension and 
of magnitude should be small. Special precautions are taken to elimi- 
nate all ordinary instrumental errors, particularly the error of clock 
rate, which has an important effect. 

The following are the results published by Prof. Kapteyn. The prob- 
able error given in each case is not far from i0."03:

Parallax of <J Herciilis. — Prof. Leavenworth has found a parallax of 
-|-0."05() i()."014 from his own observations of this star; and from a 
series of observations published by Dembowski in his '' Double Star 
Observations," -f-0."030 dL0."015. 

Parallax of P Ursce Majoris. — Dr. Franz finds from heliometer ob- 
servations of this star at Konigsberg from 1883 to 1800 a parallax of 



688 PROGRESS OF ASTRONOMY FOR 1891 AND 1892. . 

+0."10 with a probable error of 0."01. As the annual proper motion 
is 3", this parallax implies that the star is moving through space at a 
rate of 88 miles a second. Dr. Franz's result is considerably smaller 
than that obtained by Prof. Geelmuydeu from transit observations, 
7r=0."27 from differences of right ascension, and O."24froin differences 
of declination. 

DOUBLE AND MULTIPLE STARS. 

Gore's catalogue of binary stars. — Mr. Gore has compiled a useful 
catalogue of binary stars, for which orbits have been computed, giving^ 
besides the elements, date of computation, etc., the magnitudes, colors, 
spectra, hypothetical parallax, observed parallax, relative brightness, 
and the constants A and B for use in Mr. Rambaut's method of com- 
puting the parallax from the orbital motion of the star in the line of 
sight. The more recent measures are given in a series of notes. The 
catalogue was originally comumnicated to the Royal Irish Academy, in 
June, 1890, and has been reprinted from the Proceedings. 

Prof. Asaph Hall has made a further discussion of the relative motion 
of the two components of 61 Oygni and the question whether there is 
anything in the nature of a physical connection between the two. His 
conclusion is in favor of such connection, but although accurate obser- 
vations of the mutual distances and angles of position date from 1825, 
and Prof. Hall includes in the discussion those made by himself up to 
1801, it is not possible to reach any result with regard to the period of 
revolution, except that it is long. 

Two lists of double stars discovered by Mr. Burnham, most of them 
with the 36-inch refractor, have appeared during 1802, bringing Mr. 
Burnham's double star discoveries up to 1264. Most of his measures are 
of the more difficult or interesting doubles, a measurement of 0".l being 
apiiarently quite a simple matter. Mr. Burnham has also published a 
number of investigations of double star orbits, and collected lists of 
measures. 

Among lists of recently published measures of double stars should 
be mentioned the series of observations of 050 stars by Prof. Hall made 
from 1880 to 1801, with the 26-inch equatorial, of the United States 
Naval Observatory. With reference to the reduction and discussion 
of double star measures, Prof. Hall says: "The formuhie and corrections 
for personal equation of observation seem to me of doubtful utility, and 
a better way is to compare the measurements of the same star by 
different observers. " 

Discovery of double stars by means of their spectra. — In the review 
of astronomy for 1889-'00 attention was called to Prof. E. C. Picker- 
ing's discovery of the dui)licity of C Ursi? Majoris and fJ Aurigie 
through pecularities in their spectra which indicated differences in the 
motions of supjiosed components, ,

Of many douhle stars the briiiliter c<»mi»()neiit is red or yeUow. MJiih' 
the fainter conii)()nent is iireen or blue. The s])ectr()sc()]>e sliows that 
this is due to the fact tliat thesi>ectrnm of the brii^hter <'<)in})onen{ is of 
tile second type, like our sun, while the S])e(;trum of the fainter coiupo- 
nent is of the lirst type, traversed by shonyly marked hydrogen lines. 
If the stars arc ue;ir together the spectrum of the combined light re- 
sembles that of the sun, except that th<> hydrogen lines are all strong. 
Stars like /> Cygni give such a spectrum, but the components are so far 
ai)art that the separation of their six'ctra is clearly shown. Se\-eral 
stars hitherto supposed to l)e single have been found whose spectrum 
is of the class descrilx'd above, ami the ([uestion arises whether they 
may not really be double with components so clos<>that they can notI)e 
se})arated by ordinary means. In the detailed exaniination of the spec- 
tra of the brighter stars made by JNliss Ma.uiy upon the Harvard photo 
graphs, stars occui)ying all internu'diate grades from the tirst to the 
second type have been found, and it is diflicult to deternnne whether 
there are really two spectra or merely changes in the spectrum of a sin- 
gle star due to i)hysical causes. Tpon the hypothesis of du])licity the 
hydrogen lines would probably show a ])erio(lic dis[)lacement, and in 
fact an examiimtion of four photographs of the spectrum of l*rocyon 
does show a displacement of tlu^ lines which, if the ])henomenou is due 
to the relative mo\cinent of a faint <'omponent, would seem to indicate 
that it is receding at the rate of UO kilonu'ters per second as compared 
with the bright com[)()nent. Tln^ evidence of dui)licity is not con- 
sidered conclusive by Prof. Pickering, ]»ut, from an examination of ten 
other stars having a similar composite si)ectruin, live are w(dl-knowii

Z Auriga', and rJ Sagittarii, which it wouhl seem from the above (;onsid-

l)eiio(l of about 130 years. The size of this orbit around the common 
center of gravity is about equal to that of Uranus around the sun. 
Tlie phiiie of the orbit is inclined about 1*0° to our line of vision. 

Several interesting cases of variability have been detected in the 
examination of the photographs of stellar specti-a ;it the Harvard Ob- 
servatory all sliowing the bright hydrogen lines; the change in bright- 
ness exceeding two magnirudes. The director of the Harvard Obser- 
vatory has called for the cooperation of astronomers i)rovided withtele- 
scojjesof moderate i)ower and not otherwise engaged, for the observa- 
tion of a list of seventeen circnmpolar variables of long period. The 
methods to be followed are set forth in a circular issued by the observa- 
tory, and accessible to all who are interested. 

Nova Auriga' — One of the most remarkable outbursts of "new stars" 
or "7?o/Yf'" that lias ever been recorded, occurred during the year 1892 — 
a. phenomenon of double interest in that it afforded an opportunity of 
study under improved astronomical api)aratus. 

On February 1, 1892, an anonymous j)ostal card was received at the 
Royal Observatory, I']diid)urgb, announcing the presence of a new star 
in the constellation Auriga. It subsequently turned out that the dis- 
coverer was Dr. Thomas S. Anderson, an amateur astronomer living in 
Edinburgh, that the discovery had been uuide by the help of a star-atlas 
and a snuill pocket telescope, and that the star had been seen by him 
for some days previous to February 1 ; it was of about the fifth magnitude. 
Ill the first observations at Edinburgh it was found to be of a yellow 
tint and about the sixth magnitude, its position for 1892 being right 
ascension 5'' 25'" 3-^; declination -(-30o 21'. Very fortunately system- 
atic photographs of this region had been made for some time by Prof. 
Pickering at the Harvard Observatory, and the Nova was in factfinind 
to have been i)hotographed on thirteen plates taken between December 
10, 1891, and January 20, 1892; while it does not appear upon a plate 
taken at Heidelberg on December 8, which shows stars down to the 
]iinth magnitude. The outburst, at least above the ninth magnitude 
seems, therefore, to be ])retty well fixed between December 8 and 10, 
1892. 

The iSTova remained of the fourth or fifth magnitude till the end of 
February, then diminished somewhat rapidly, and by the end of March 
it was of the twelfth to fourteenth magnitude. 

In August it was again easily visible. At the Lick observatory it 
was found to be of 10.5 magnitude on August 17, and 9.8 on August 
19, and further fiuctnations in brightness have occurred. 

The spectrum was of the greatest interest. The chief characteristic 
was a brilliant array of l)right. broad lines, attended by dark compan- 
ions on the more refrangible sides. Numerous finer details were then 
added, dark lines crossing the broad, bright bands, and bright lines 
marking the dark companions. 



PROGRESS OF ASTRONOMY FOR 1891 AND 1892. 691 

Three lines have attracted more especial attention on acconnt of their 
intimate connection with the susi)ected physical constitntion of tlie 
star. '' These are (1) the bn<;h tureen line near h^, and the less refran- 
.iiible edji'c of tlie hydrocarlxHi band; (2) the line near the chief 
nebnlar line ATtOOd, and (.'>) tlie line near the pair of chromospheric 
lines A4:92;3 and A4i)21. When the wave length of these lines, as ([noted 
by the observers, are corrected for motion in the line of sight, and 
arranged in a table, the mean valnes come ont very close to the wav^e 
lengths of three notable pairs of solar chromosi)heric Hnes ; while mag- 
nesinm and the hydrocarbons, as possible origins of line (1), are ex- 
cluded by the absence from the lists of their inseparable companion 
lines and Hutings. 

Line (2) is claimed by four observers for the chief nebular line, but 
the weight of evidence seems to be against its nebular origin, and the 
outburst would seem to be a vast chromospheric disturbance, a view 
confirmed by Dr. Huggins' observation of the complete series of bright 
hydrogen lines in the ultra-violet — the same that Hale and Deslaiulrcs 
found in the solar chromosphere — but each with its dark companion. 

An interesting article advocating the meteoric theory in explanation 
of the outburst is given by Prof. Lockyer in Volume 31 of the IS'ine- 
teenth Century. The chromospheric theory of the near approach of 
two stars is given by Dr. Huggins in the June numbei-, 1892, of the 
Fortnightly Ifeview ; Seeliger's moditication of the meteoric theory is 
translated in Astronomy and Astrophysics for December, and a single- 
star chroinosjilicric theory is offered by Sidgreaves in the October 
number of the Observatory. 

stp:llar spectra. 

Dr((i)er vataloyne of stelhtr spcctrn. — Volume 27 of the Harvard An- 
nals contains a catalogue of the photographic spectra of more than ten 
tliousand stars north of 25^ south declination. The i)hotographs were 
taken with sm S-inch Voigtliinder lens, in front of which was placed a 
])rism S inches square, with a refracting angle of 13°. The edge of this 
l>rism was so (ixed that the star's light was dispersed in declination, the 
k'ngth of the spectrum being about a centimeter, aiul the star being- 
allowed to trail slightly gave the spectrum a width of about a millimeter. 
I^ach plate covered ](P s(pnire and the spectra of all stars to the sixth 
magnitude were i)hotographed. The S])ectra are divided, for conveni- 
ence, into a large number of classes — A BCD indicating varieties of the 
first type; E to L, varieties of the second ty])e; M, the third type; N, 
the fourth type; and O P Q S])ectra that do not resemble any of the 
preceding types. One of the most important features of the work is 
the method by which [)hotograj)]iic magnitudes have l)een assigned. 
''The (luantity measured in each case is the intensity of the spectrum 
in the vicinity of the ( J line. Accordingly, when stars having ditferent 
spectra are com])ared. the results will not be the same as if the entire 



692 PROGRESS OF ASTRONOMY FOR 1891 AND 1892. 

ligbt of the stars were measured. In the hitter case, tlie results will 
differ with the color of the star, according' to the method of measure- 
ment employed. This is a serious defect in the measures of the bright- 
ness of the stars in catalogues hitherto published. Since the present 
measures relate to rays of a single wave-length, the same result should 
be obtained whether the method of comi)arison was by the photographic 
plate, the eye, or the thermopile." 

Tlie Draper catalogue gives the ai)proxinui,te positions of the stai-s for 
the year 11)00, with their reference numbers in the Bonn Dnrchmusterung- 
and the Harvard Photometry; their class or' spectrum by letters; their 
photographic magnitudes and the differences of these from the magni- 
tudes of the Durchmusterung, the Argentine General Catalogue and 
the Harvard Photometry. A well arranged table gives the details of 
the measures of magnitude on the various j)lates on which each star 
ai)pears. The whole sky to 25° south declination was photographed 
twice with plates overlapping. 

Volume 26, part 1, of the Harvard Annals ^ives additional details 
respecting the photogTa])hs, their measurement and reduction not con- 
veniently included in the catalogue volume itself— a complete history 
of the Draper Memorial. A point brought out in the various matters 
discussed in this volume is the predominance of the first type spectra 
in the Milky Way elsewhere referred to, and tlu^ systematic underval- 
uing' of the brigiitness of the Galactic stars by about one-tifth of a mag- 
nitude, by the ''Durchmusterung" and '• Uranometria Argentina" as 
compared with the Harvard photometric and photographic magnitudes. 

A third volume is to follow devoted to the work of the 8-iiich Draper 
telescope during the years 1889 and 1892 and to the discussion of stars 
of i^eculiar spectra. 

A fifth ti/pe of stellar spectra. — Prof. E. ( '. Pickering has proposed to 
class in a "fifth type" stars whose spectra resemble those of the stars 
discovei'ed by Wolf and Kayet. In general, his photographic survey 
has confirmed Secchi's fourfold division of stellar spectra, but many 
stars in Orion and the neighboihood differ considerably from the 
ordinary first-type stars, the additional lines, instead of being- faint as 
in Vega, being nearly as intense as the hydrogen lines, while two 
classes of objects, the i)lanetary nebuhe and the stars, the spectra of 
Avhicli consist chiefly of bright lines, are left unprovided for. Prof. 
Pickering points out the close similarity of the grouping of the lines in 
these three classes and also the striking character of their distribution. 
While stars of the second and third types are about equally divided 
between the Milky Way and the regions remote from it, two-thirds of 
the first-type star lie in or near the Milky Way and of the Orion stars 
four-fifths are found in the Milky Way. 

A similar distribution of the planetary nebula* has long been recog- 
nized, and Prof, Pickering shows that, of thirty-three stars known as 



PROGKKSS OF ASTKONOMY I'OU 1891 AM) 1892. ('}[)?) 

the '' Wolf-Rayet," or us lie sug.uests the '• fiftli type," every one He.s 
within 10^ of the Gnlaetie cciuator, two-thirds within 2° of it. 

n Virginis. — Dr. Vo<iers more recent observations oH a ^'ir,iiinis at 
Potsdam aeeord with his earlier ol)servations of the same star, show- 
in.i;' that it is a close biiiaiy. The method of observation is quite 
iiiterestiii.ii' : The si)ec(rnni of the star and of terrestrial hydroijen are 
])hi)to<;ra])hed to<ietlier, and tiie <lisplaceniejit of the star lines on the 
l)hotof>rai)li in the neighborhood of 11 ;- is afteiwards measured under 
a microsc()])e. Stars with si>ectra of the second ;iiid tliir<l types j^ive 
results of consideral'.le accuracy, as the lines in such stars ar<' numer- 
ous aiid sharp. 

In the case of a \'ir<;inis tiie ditiiculties of observat ion were iireater, 
the hydroii'en lines being- broad and diiiuse, without any delinite maxi- 
mum of intensity, and there were no distinct lines in the vicinity of 
H K to which the measurements coidd be referred. Dr. Vogei's me;is- 
urements of twenty-four photograi)hs showed that the star lines were 
disjdaced alteriiately toward the upi)er and the lower end of the sjjcc- 
trum in a complete i)eri()d of about four days, the maximum disi)lace- 
ment toward the violet iiulicating a motion of the star towaid the sun 
of G.l.O English miles, and that toward the red a receding motion ot 
47.5 miles per second. These observations are completely explained by 
sui)posing that Spira is a binary star having a period of one comj)0- 
nent about the other or the common center of gravity of about 4 days, 
(the orbital velocity of the larger component being .">(). 7 miles per sec- 
oml) and that the system is approaching the sun at the rate of 1).2 
miles i)er second. On the assumption of a circular oibit, equal mass of 
the components, and the data given by observation, the mass of the 
system is 2.(1 times that of the snn, and the distance hetween the 
comi)onents (>,200,000 miles. 

In <:ommenting' upon Dr. \'oge]'s work Pi'of. Keeler says, ''A won- 
derful ])icture of stellar Jiiotion is presented to our mind, and one to 
which the whole visible nin\erse as revealed to us l)y oui' greatest tele- 
scopes otters no parallel. The spectacle of two great suns like our own, 
revolving around ea<h other in only four da\s, at a distance no greater 
than that which se])arates the sixth satellite of Saturn from its 
primary, is one whi<di the inade(imicy of our o])tica] powers will ])r<)ba- 
bly ever forbid us from actually beholding, but the indirect e\id(Mice 
that such extraordinary circumstances of motion exist is so complete 
that we must admit their reality." 

/j Aiir't(j(v. — The Potsdam obser\ations fuini.sh a complete <;on(irnui- 
tion of Prof. Pickering's discovery of the duplicity of this star. The 
lines in the sjn'ctrum of the star api)ear double on every s(>cond day, 
and thecomponent, in the line of sight, of themotion of the system can 
amount to nearly l.")0 miles a .second, while the v.hole system has a 
motion relatively to the solar system of —4.0.'} miles; that is, a motion 
of this amount per second towards the solar system.

torily confiruied. Tlie niaxinmm relative velocity of its two coui- 
poiieiits seems to amount to about 100 miles per secoud. 

a Booth. — Mr. Keeler's recent measures upon the D line of tlie spec- 
trum of Arctnrns show that the velocity in the line of sight is not 80 
kilometers per second, the value hitherto accepted, but 6.4 kilometers, 
which accords with the result obtained by l)r. Vogel. The mean of the 
measures at Potsdam from October 5, 1888, to May 23, 1890, is —7.1 
rt 0.3 kilometers. The Lick observations from April 20, 1890, to August, 
15, 1890, give — C.9 kilometers. 

ASTRONOMICAL PIIOTOORAPHY, 

The photographic chart of the sl'y. — The third* meeting of the perma- 
nent committee, appointed by the Astrophotographic Congress at Paris 
in 1887, was held at the Paris observatory from March 31 to April 4, 
1892. Admiral Mouchez presided, the menibers of the committee i)res, 
ent being Baillaud, Bakhuyzen, Beuf, Christie, Denza, Donner, Gill- 
Henry (Paul), Henry (Prosper), Janssen, Kapteyn, Loewy, Mouchez, 
Pujazon, Eayet, Eicco, Tacchiui and Trepied. The following astrono- 
mers were also present by invitation, Messrs, Abney, Audoyer, Belo- 
polsky, Bouquet de la Grye, Cornu, Knobel, Gautier, Maturana, Plum- 
mer, Scheiner, Tisserand, and Wolf (C). 

Drs. Bakhuyzen and Gill were elected vice-i)residents and Prof. 
Kapteyn and Trepied secretaries. 

From reports of progress made at different observatories the follow- 
ing notes indicate the advancement of the work: 

Some delay had been experienced in securing the plates containing 
the referen<!e lines or "■ reseaux,^^ but provision was finally made to 
furnish them at an early day, as well as the photographic plates which 
it was necessary should be of a specially good quality of plate glass. 

Algiers. — Instruments ready and only awaiting the plates and '* reseait." 

Bordeaux. — PLotogra|ihic installation has been ready for about a year; a number 
of experimental photographs liave been taken and the work can commeiioe as soon 
as a supply of plates is secured with the necessary "re'seaii." 

Cape of Good Hope. — Instrument practically ready. 

Catania. — The instrument has been completed. 

HeJsinf/fors. — The instrument lias been ready for several months and a consideral>le 
number of photogra})hs have been taken. 

La Plata. — Instrument ready. 

Melbourne. — Instrument ready and a number of experimental ])lates have bei'n 
secured. 

Oxford. — Instrument ready and a number of plates submitted to the committee. 



* The first meeting df the committee, for organization, etc., was held at the time of 
the Congress in April 1887, the second meeting or the first regular meeting for dis- 
cussions, in September, 1889 (not 1890, as stated by a misprint in the review of As- 
tronomy for 1889-'90).

Following is a sumin:iiy of the resolutions adopted at this lueetino-: 

(1) jSo change is made in tin' conditions of distance and magnitude 
of the stars that have formed the diffeieut parts of the catalogue ol 
guide stars. 

If, however, the guide star of the catalogue is not bright enough, a 
brighter one maybe selected up to a distanc<' of 10' from tlie c<'nrer 
of the plate. 

(2) The ^'■rr.scan"' is to be i)hotogra]ihed upon each i>late l)y \)araliel 
raj's of light. (To rei)lace resolution lo adoi)ied at the meetiug of ISS',).) 

(3) The orientation of the }>lates iu zones above do- declinatiou will 
be arranged for the ecpiinox of VMH)-. for othei- stars the jtaiallel will 
be referred to the api)arent ecptinox. 

(4) Tlie woik decided upon by the congress of 1SS7 comi)rises two 
series of negatives made with different exi)osuies. The committee, 
while urging" special activity in securing {dates of shorter exjxtsure 
(negatives intended for the catalogue), would suggest that the best 
nights be also taken advantage of for plates of l(»nger ex])osurc (for 
the chart). 

(5) Negatives from which the catalogue is to be formed will have 
two exposures for the same plate, one showing faintly the images of 
stars of the elev'enth magnitude, the other with an exposure twice as 
hnig, the distance of the two images being 0.1* to ().;; of a millimeter. 
(To replace resolution Uo of the meeting of ISSt).) 

(6) MM. Abney aud ('ornu are added to the coiinnittcc on reiuoibic- 
tiou of the negatives, 

(7) With reference to the prodiu-tion of the chart, purel\ piu>to- 
graphic methods will be used, to the exclusion of all manual interven- 
tion. 

(8) For the chart proi)er (long exposures) a series of negatives witii 
single exposure will be taken, having an cvf}! degree of declination iu 
the center of the ]»late. Further stud.x will show whether it is desir- 



696 PROGRESS OF ASTRONOMY FOR 1891 AND 1892. 

able that in the .second series (those with an odd degree at t)ie center) 
there shouhl be two or three exposures. 

(9) To make it possibh' to pass nniformly and with certainty from 
Argelander's ninth magnitnde to the eleventh magnitude desired i'or 
the negatives of the photographic catalogue there will be distribnted 
among the observatories line wire-gauze screens, absolutely identical, 
which, when jjlaced over the object glass of the telescope will dinunish 
the magnitude of a star by two units (adopting the coefficient 2. r>r2 tor 
the ratio between two consecutive magnitudes), li^ach observatory will 
from time to time mnke type negatives of certain specified regions. 

(10) The committee suggests forty minutes as the length of exposure 
of the i)liites for the chart (the series of c?'ew declinations) under the ordi- 
nary atmospheric conditions of Paris, and with the Lunnere plates used. 

Thecomndtteeon metallic screens will fnridsh the Messrs. Henry with 
a screen with which they will determine the time / for obtaining the 
eleventh magnitude stars of Argelander's scale. Then for each obser- 
vatory provided with an identical screen, the ratio 40 :t will be the factor 
by which to multiply the time of exposure necessary to secure satisfac- 
tory images of eleventh magnitude stars, in order to obtain the proper 
ex})osure for the chart ])lates. 

(11) The ([uestions of the number of reference stars for each nega- 
tive for the catalogue, the choice of the stars, and the necessary steps 
to secure meridian observations are referred 1o a special committee, con- 
sisting of Messrs. Auwers, Bakhuyzon, Chiistie. Elh^ry, Gill, Kapteyn, 
and Loewy, with lull i)oweis. 

(12) As soon as convenient each ol)server will prepare, «u- will have 
prej)ared by any observatory or bureau lie may select — 

{(() Measures of the i)Osition of each star on the catalogue referred by 
rectilinear coordinates to the nearest lines of the '" rr^mii." 

{h) Measures necessary for the detenniuation oi" the stars' magnitudes. 

The different observatories will publish the separate results of these 
measures and the Permanent Comndttee will undertake their reduction 
as soon as a sufficient nund)er(d' meridian observations of the reference 
stars is at hand. 

(l.'i) The work upon the chart will commence at each observatory as 
soon as the metallic screen reducing the stars by two magnitudes is re- 
ceived, involving probably a delay of two months. Each observer may, 
however, begin before receiving the screen if he is contidentthathe can 
get all stars of the eleventh magnitude upon the catalogue plates. 

(14) Without adopting a formal resolution, the committee would 
recommend as a separate and personal investigation, that a special series 
of negatives with long- exposuresbemadeof theregiou neartheecliptic

(l(i) Every year before the <mi(1 of January a re})oit upon the jiroji'ross 
of the work will 1»e made to the bureau of the I'eriiiaueiit Coniiuittee. 

(17) The thanks of the conference were voted for the eourte.sy of 
the Academy of Sciences in printing the bulletin, aiul the hope was 
expressed that the different goverunients would i)rovide the necessary 
means for the observations tliemselves and for the ])ublicati(Ui of the 
chart. 

The sixth lasciculus of the bulletin contains i)apers by rrof. Kap 
teyn and 31. Sautier (Ui the parallactic micrometer, ami ui)on photo- 
<ira])hic ma.uiiitudes by Profs. Wolf and Duner. The latter subject has 
also been discussed by Dr. Scheiuer in the Asfrono)nis<-ltc X<(clirichtcn^ 
by Prof. l*ritcliard in tlie CoinpU's Rcndnn. and by INFr. Christie in the 
Monihly Xoticcs. 

Phototjraphs of llic I'lriadcs. — liutlierford's photograi)hs of the Plei- 
ades taken in 1872 and 1S74 ha\'e been selected lor measurement by 
.Mr. Jacoby as ofi'eiiug- an opportunity for comi)arin,u- the accuracy of rhe 
pliotograplis with that of lieliometei' and micrometer measures, l^ach 
l)late contains two impressions of the cluster, both of which were meas- 
ured. Mr, Jacoby's method consisted of measuring the position angle 
and distance from the star 24 7>, and he linds the ])robable error of the 
mean of the twenty exposures to be about 4 ()."()3 in each element. 

A comparison between these photograjdiic ])laces and the ])laces 
resulting from the Vale and Kiiiiigsberg lieliometers shows that tiic 
lihotograjihs are fully entitled to be taken into con.sideration in making 
a study of the ])roper motions or in forming a <letiniti\'e catalogiu' of 
the group. 

Dr. Max Wolf, of Heidelberg, with a jioi trait lens of 2A inches 
ai)ertiire, has not only discovered new nebuhe on his long exposure pho- 
tograi^hs, l)ut new minor planets; several meteors which crossed the Held 
left perfectly distinct records. 



698 PROGRESS OF ASTRONOMY FOR 1891 AND 1892. 

COMETS. 

In a series of i^apers in the Bulletin Astronomiqne M. Schulhof has de- 
veloi)ed in an interesting' way tlie relations existing between the elements 
of a comet's orbit before and after it suffers jierturbation by a planet. 
That the periodic comets of our system have been captured through the 
perturbing action of planets apfjears established; and Mercury has four 
comets assigned to it, Venus seven, the Earth ten. Mars four, Jupiter 
twenty-three, Saturn nine, Uranus eight, Neptune five, and a- further 
group of comets appears to give a feeble indication of an ultra-Xeptu- 
niaii planet at a distance from the sun of about seventy times that of 
the earth. 

The search for new comets has been systematized by the cometary sec- 
tion of the British Astronomical Association under the direction of Mr. 
W. F. Denning. The aims of this section are to secure observations of 
comets, to discover new comets and nebuhie, to record telescopic me- 
teors, etc. It is intended to sweep the sky regularly for new comets, a 
definite region being assigned to each observer according to convenience , 
and choice. 

The following notes, relating chiefiy to the comets of 1891 and 1892, 
will comidete the list of comets published in these "Reports of Progress," 
from 1883 to 1892. It is hardly necessary to remark that the most 
complete and authoritative annual summary of cometary phenomena is 
that published by Dr. Kreutz in the Vierteljahrsschri/t der Astronom- 
ischen Geselhch ((ft. 

The arrangement adopted below is the order of i^erihelion passage, 
except in the case of well-known periodic comets, such as Encke's, 
Winnecke's, etc., which are arranged alphabetically by their recognized 
names. The table of elements appended is to l)e regarded as only 
approximate, but is suflicient to furnish an idea of the general form 
and position of the orbit. 

( 'Omet Encke: The return of Encke's well-known periodic comet; 

-=Comet 1891, III. j^^st found by Barnard, from the ephemeris, on Aug- 
ust 1, 1891. It was then exceedingly taint, but in September it had 
increased to a nebulous mass of ubout the sixth to seventh magnitude. 
The comet was unfavorably situated for observation after the end of 
September, the last observation reported being October 11. It is note- 
worthy that its ]iath at this return was almost the stime as in the return 
of 1858, and a comparison of the brightness on these two occasions 
would seem to indicate that it has not undergone any material change 
in physical condition during the interval. 

Comet Tempel. — Tempel's first periodic comet, and of rather unusual 
interest, was unfortunately missed at its return in 1892, being unfavor- 
ably situated for observation.

Jt was ori<;inally discovered byTeuipel hi ISIJU, was picked up a.i;aiu iu 
1880 by Swift, and again yi\nm this refurii by liarnard. At its iuter- 
inediate returns iu 187;> and 1885 it was so situated witli rel'erenee to 
tlie earth and sun as to have been entirely iu\isible. A very carefully 
]U'ei)ared ephemeris by IJossert, taking account of the i)ertnrbations 
from 188(>, enabled Barnard to lind the comet on September 27, 181)1, 
and it was imlejiendently Ibund by IJenniug at Bristol on September 
'•'A). It was <lescribed as a faint, shai)eless nebulosity, with slight con- 
densation about the center, but even at its brightest, towards the end 
of November, it was a difficult object for precise observation, a fact 
all tlu' more to be regretted as its position would render it of especial 
value for the determination of the distance of the sun. 

Comet \Vinnecke: Winnecke's well-known i^eriodic comet was picked 

=Coniet mj-2 IV. I ^p ^t this return, through the help o\' von [laerdtl's 

ephemeris, by Spitaler at Vienna on March 18,1892; it was then an 
exceedingly faint and small nebulous mass with stellar nucleus of the 
sixteenth magnitu(h'. It increased in brightness towards i)erihelion 
(on dune 30), and after perihelion was observed in the southern hem- 
isphere till the end of Septend)er. 

Comet 188o IV,* v.hich was discovered by Brooks on May 22, 188(5, 
was expected to make its lirst return to perihelion in the latter part of 
18!»2, but was not found. The orbit is somewhat uncertain. 

Comet 1889 V. — To quote from the lirst of a series of masterly papers 
on the oibit published by Mr. Chandler in the Astronomical Jourmd: 
"The vicissitudes in the history of this comet give it an interest 
exceeded, perhaps, l>y no other in astronomical annals; and the settle- 
ment of the problems connected therewith promises to illuminate our 
knowledge of cometary mechanics in various important particulars. 

While the manner in which the comet became vSei)arated into several 
l)arts, by its encounter with Jupiter in 188(1, may possibly recjuire for 
its precise exposition the observaticuis which will be obtained at the 
next ai)i)(nirauce in 189(», we ma\ hope lor an ai)i)roximate answer in 
the careful dis(;ussion of those made in 1889 alone. . . 

'Vo begin with, it is necessary to notice some of the ]diysical phe- 
nomena 1 (resented by the comi)anions. The notation used will be the 
letters assigned by Barnaid, />' (' J) and U in order of the distances 
from the main comet J. As is known, B and C weic detected by him 
on August 1, witli the 12 inch, /> and Eon Auv!:ust I, with the 3(!-inch. 
It is desirable to remark here that tlie reason for their not having been 
discovered in the i)revious month, on July 8, 9 and 10, can iH)t have 
been superposition by perspective, at least in the case of C aiul the 
more distant companions; for the orbit of C . . . shows that 



* See Smithsonian Report 1887, p. 123. 



700 PROGRESS OP ASTRONOMY VOli 1891 ANlJ 1892. 

such superposition occuired two mouths previous to discovery of A 
by l)i(K>ks, iiud gives for July 8 ;i distaui'c of 190" at 02°. 5 position 
angle. That the companions were not seen in July, may be naturally 
ascribed to interference of mooidight up to about July 20, aud after 
that either to the fact that the attention of observers was not suffi- 
ciently directed to the phenomenon, or to the fact that the objects had 
not yet become bright enough to be easily disceruible. We have the 
evidence of Spitaler that on July 30 and 31 uothing abnormal was 
noticed with the 27 inch; the slight elongation on those dates, seen by 
him in A having no relation to the matter in hand. Two nights 
after, at the time of discovery, Barnard estimated tlie brightness of C 
at about one-fifth that of ^. It tJien gradually increased in brilliancy, 
also becoming less diffused and developing a strong condensation and 
nucleus, until at the end of August it was actually brighter than A al- 
though only one-third its size. In early Se])tember it was about equal 
in brightness to A but from tlie middle of that month faded, and be- 
came larger and more diffuse until it disappeared, late in i^rovember. 
The faint nucleus of i?, in the beginning ai)pears to liave been a little 
brighter than thnt of (\ and its coma smaller and less diffused. A])out 
the middle of August it had grown to be larger and fainter than at 
first, later more rapidly so, being excessively difficult to see or measure 
in the first few days of September, and invisible immediately there- 
after. 1) and E were measured only on the night of discovery, and 
were seen only at rare intervals until the last time on August 29. 

Such, briefiy described, are the main features as to brightness aiul 
visibility of these objects. I beg courteously to dissent from the view 
which has been confidently expressed, that the diffusion and disappear- 
ance of />, while it was theoretically increasing in brightness, indicate 
'that it actually dissipated itself into space and absolutely ceased +o 
exist, if indeed it were not absorbed into the main comet.' Such a con 
elusion is inherently improbable, unwarranted by any knowledge we 
possess as to the process of cometary light development, and (;ontra 
dieted by inferences drawn from other cases, of which only the most 
analagous need be cited, namely, that of the two nuclei of Biela's comet, 
the capricious action of which affords a strict counterpart to the present 
instance. It will be recollected that fitful alternations of visibility 
occurred in 1840, and especially in 1852, when they repeated theui selves 
almost from day to day. The two comx)anions were not habitually seen 
at the same time, but sometimes one, sometimes the other; so that ob- 
servers could not tell which they were looking at, without comparison 
with the ephemeris. Thus, in the space of one week, for example, 1852, 
September 15 to 22, both nuclei were visible, then only the southern, 
then only the northern, then both together; again only the southern, 
iind, finally, only the northern, on successive nights, respectively. 

It may be added that there a])pears to be little reason for interpret- 
ing these remarkable variations of brilliancy as standing in any rela 
tion of efi'ect with cause wliich jtroduced theiflisruption, either in Bic

Comet 1892 I: ' Discovered by Swift on March 0. 1892, at 11^ 
=:Couie t a 1892. ; Rochester mean time, or 5 o'clock on the morning of 
March 7, in 30° south declination; the brightest comet seen in the 
northern hemisphere since the great September comet of 1882. At the 
time of its greatest brilliancy, which was at perilielion, April 6, it was 
as bright as a star of the third or fourth magnitude, with a bright, 
round head and nucleus of 10" to 15" diameter. The tail, on the other 
hand, was exceedingly faint, and was variously estimated at from 1° to 
20° in length. Barnard reported it on April 3 as double. The i^hoto- 
graphs of the tail were of unusual interest, especially those taken in 
March at Sydney and in April at Mount Hamilton. On the morning 
of April 5 a photograph, made by Barnard at Mount Hamilton with a 
G-inch lens, showed three main branches to the tail, each being sepa- 
rated into several others, so that in all at least a dozen could be counted. 
At a distance of two degrees from the head, along the northern side of 
the middle tail, there was a sudden bend southward. On the 7th "the 
southern component, which was the brightest on the 5th, had become 
diffused and fainter, while the middle tail was very bright and broad; 
its southern side, which was the best detined, was wavy in numerous 
places, the tail api)eariug as if disturbing- currents were flowing at 
right angles to it. At 42' from the head the tail made an abrupt bend 
towards the south, as if its current was deflected by some obstacle. In 
the densest portion of the tail, at the point of deflection, is a couple of 
dark holes similar to tliese seen in some of the nebulce." 

The comet was visible to the naked eye till the beginning of June, 
and was still under observation with the telescope at the close of the 
year. 

The .spectrum as o])served by Konkoly on April 1 and 2 consisted of 
a continuous spectrum and Ave bright lines, while Campbell, at the

lo, saw, in addition to the eontinuous spectrum, the tliree usual com- 
etary bands, the less refrangible sides of these bands being sliari)ly 
defined and the middle one, iu fact, terminated by a very bright line. 
The orbit of the comet is iind()id)t(Mlly (dliptic, belonging to the inter- 
esting group of comets with a period of about two thousand years. 
During this ap[)earance, as it was loi- aconsideral>le time in the neigh- 
borhood of Jupiter, its path may l>e considerably changed.

tion; it was then at its maximum brightness, small, round, with central 
condensation of from ele\-enth to twelfth magnitu(b', and no tail. It 
remained small and inconspicuous, but was under observation for sev- 
eral months. The orbit is i)arabolic. without specially interesting pecu- 
liarity. 

Comet 1892 I II : I I )iscovered by Mr. K. Holmes, at London, on Xovem- 
=Conict / 1S9'J. ber 0, 1S1>2, near the great Andromeda nebula, and 
=Hoh]ies's c omet. | .,1^,, independently on November 0, by I)avi<lson, 
at ^lackay, Queensland — a round nebulous mass 5' in diameter with a 
central condensation, but no tail: the suspicion that it was a return of 
liiela's comet was shown to be unfounded as soon as sufficient obser- 
vations were available for a determination of its oi'bit, though the orbit 
proved to be elliptic and of short period. A shoi't faint tail was .seen 
soon after discovery, and upon a photograph taken by Barnard, on 
November 10, it can be followed for half a degree, while about a degree 
from the head and beyond the tail there is a diffust'd lu'bulous object, 
apparently belonging to the comet, and this connection seems sub- 
stantiated by Cam[)beirs spectroscopic observations. 

The comet was visible to the naked eye to the end of November and 
in telescopes of medium power during the first part of December, and 
then dinunished very rapidly in brightness, not following at all the 
(;omiiuted scale of brilliancy, but showing a remarkable and inex])lica- 
])le outburst about the l^Jtli of January, \S\)3. The spectium was also 
l)eculiar in that it seemed to be purely continuous. 

According to the elements computed by Schulhof the comet i)assed 
perihelion on June 13, LS92, a!ul its jx-riod is (5.0 years; the orbit seems 
to lie entirely within that of Jupiter, the nearest jtossible ajjproach of 
the two beingO.4, (the mean distance of the earth from the sun being 1,) 
bnt since 1861 the two bodies do not .s<'em to have been very close at 
any time. The small eccentricity, not far from that of Tempel's first 
periodic comet, brings it quite near to the upper limits of the eccen- 
tricity of the asteroid orbits. But with such a shoit i)eriod, as it can 
not have experienced great perturbations since 1801, tiie reason for its 
never having been seen at a previous return, is a mysteiy which seems to 
be connected in some way with the very great and abnoimal variation

single case of the " Tewfik comet," shown near the sun on a plate exposed 
during the total eclipse of May 17, 1882. The present comet was 
detected as a suspicious looking object upon a plate exposed near « 
Aquila on October 12, 1892, by Barnard. On the following evening the 
cometary character of the object was confirmed by the 12-iuch refrac- 
tor. It was faint, V in diameter, and from twelfth to thirteenth mag- 
nitude, somewhat condensed toward the center. It changed but little 
in appearance and was last seen in December. 

Dr. Krueger's elements give a period of revolution of only (>.3 years 
and show a remarkable resemblance to those of Wolf's comet— so great, 
ill iiU't, as to suggest a common origin for the two, as in the case of 
Biela's comet and Brooks's comet, 1889 \. 

Comet 1892 VI: Discovered on August 28, 1892, in the constella- 

=(Jomet d 1892. | tion Gemini, by Brooks, a (piite bright, round nebula, 
with distinct nucleus and short faint tail; it was visible to the naked 
eye in November, and the tail could be followed, upon a jihotographic 
plate, November 26th, for 5° ; after the middle of December the comet 
was observable only in the southern hemisphere. 

The spectroscope showed a continuous spectrum with the three usual 
cometary bands. 

Comet 1893 I: , This comet was also discovered by Brooks, at 
=^Comet (1 1892. | Geneva, X. Y., in the constellation Bootes, on the 
morning of Novend)er 19, 1892 ; it was then ([uite bright for a telescoi>ic 
comet, but showed no tail, while its increase in brightness and north- 
erly motion made it an easy object for observation during the rest of 
the year.

of a susi)i(iou8 oltject detected by Prof. M. Wolf upon ])hot()graphic

is no reason to sn]>pose the elongated meteor current discontinuous, 
fully 500,000,000 miles in its observed length along the comet's path." 

SOLAR SYSTEM. 

Motion of tlir solur .sf/st<'iii. — Pi'of. Portei' has discussed the proper 
motions of 1,340 stars contained in publication 12 of the Cincinnati 
obser^•atory. Adopting I )r. Scluinfeld's method of di^ iding the stars into 
four groups, according to the magnitude of their proper motions, he has 
<'onlirmed Dr. >Stumpe's result that the proin'r motion of a star is an 
index of its distance fioin us. The mean position of the ■•sun's way" 
from his iigures is 281"^, 2 right ascension and +10".7 dediiiation. 

Dr. Vogel has also published the results <»f an in({uiry on this sui>ject 
based on the measured velocities of stars in the line of sight. The 
motion of fifty-one stars has been determined at Totsdain. and the ]>roba- 
ble error in the measurement is below 1.10 geogra])hical miles, but the 
resulting value of the ai)ex of motion, though the observations have 
been discussed in various ways, is ii(»t in very satisfactory act'ord with 
other investigations. If the stellar moti(Uis be treated cither with ecpial 
weights, or weights approximately proportional to th()se assigned by 
Dr. Vogel in his catalogue of jjioper motions, the coordinates <»f the 
apex are 20(>o.l i 12c.O in right ascension, ami + 45^.0 rlr0°.2 in dec- 
lination, with a velocity of 11.00 ^4^ l.So geogra])hical miles. 

SUN. 

Diameter of the sun. — A large number of heliometer ineasures of the 
diameters of the sun and Venus made by the (Ternum transit of Yenus 
])arties in 1874 and 1882, incidental to the more important deternuua- 
tion of the solar parallax, have been discussed by Dr. Auwers, who 
finds for the mean result of the sun's diameter (thirty-one observers) 
1.1>10".3, which difiers considerably from that adopted in the various 
ephemerides; the Berlin Jahibuch, for instance, uses 1,922". 4, the ("on- 
uaissance des Temps and British Nautical Abnauacl, 023". (i, and the 
American ]*^phemeris 1,924".0. Dr. Auwers remarks that if the value 
he finds is affected by irradiation it can only be too large, while 
the adopted diameters are larger still. He announces that a change 
will be made in the value used by the Berlin Jahrbuch in the volume 
for 1895. 

Teinperatnre of the .sun. — The numerous attempts that have been 
made to determine the temperature of the sun have led to the most 
discordant results, the figures varying from 1,500^ to .-»,000,(I00^. The 
method emph)yed, however, has ahvays been the same (that of Touil-

by the less hii;hly heated solar atmosphere, ami ])erhaps also (altlioniili 
this seems hardly probabh') because the endssive power of the sun may 
be less than unity. 

Solar act ir it 1/ in is'J.'J. — The development of the solar activity during- 
LS02 was no less marked with regard to prominenees than with regard 
to sun spots. On April (! Trouvelot reported au arched jn'ominenee 
extending some 90,000 miles along the limb of the sun and attaining a 
height of over r>7,oOO miles. Two days later an enormous i)rotuberance 
rose to a height of 71,!>70 nnles, extending in a little over half an hour 
to 10.),550, and a week later another extending over 2.-)r),00(> mih'S along 
the circuniferenc<'. 

Tlie great Sim sjxtt (fro up of lsi):j. — It appears that the original I'orma- 
tion of the group took place on the farther side of the sun, and it lirst 
came under obseivation on No^('nd)er 15, 1801. when it was seen as a 
si)ot of considerable size close to the east limb. On November \i\ 
the group consisted of thi'ee spots, and by]Srovend>er 18 it had assunu'd 
the appearance so tyi)ical of tliemoi-e important disturbances, of a long 
procession of spots of \arious sizes, the s]»ot in the van and that in 
the rear being the largest. During tlie I)ecend)er apjx'arance (De- 
cember 12-24) it was throughout one well-deUiu'd circulai' spot. 

One spot, roughly circular in shape, ah)ne appeared on .January 7. 
it is not (piitc clear whether it represented the |)riiici|)al groui> of the 
November appearance or the little group whicli formed in ad\ance of 
it and which b<icame prominent during Decembei-. It seemed to oc- 
cupy a position nearly midway between the two. though the two are 
practically to be regarded as one disturbance'. 

Befoi-e its a]t])earance at the east lind> <»n March 4 a gieat change 
had taken place. 'IMie group, which on l''el)rnary l.'i liad co\-ei-ed more 



708 PKOGRESi^ OF ASTRONOMY FOR 18!tl AND 1892. 

tluiii 3,000 inillionths of the vSuiTs visible lieiiiispheie, did not eover 
oue-fifteeutli of that area on ^larch 5, though it revived somewhat be- 
fore it was hist seen at the west liinb on JVIarch 17, but did not survive 
to make a sixth appearance at the east limb on March 31 or April 1. 

Accordinji' to Mr. Maund«'r tlic great spot, the largest on record at 
Greenwich, was 02,000 miles long and 02,000 miles broad, while the 
entire group of whieli it formed the j)rincipal ])art was 162,000 miles 
long and 75,000 broad. The area of the spot on February 13, 1802 
was 2,910 million sipiare miles, and the whole group 3,530 million 
scjuare miles. This is about eighteen times the area of the earth, and 
seventy globes as large as ours could have lain side by side in the im- 
mense hollow, Mr, Maunder thinks that the effect upon the weather 
of a spot even of such enormous size must be very slight, if apprecia- 
ble. The magnetic needle, however, undergoes violent disturbance upon 
their appearance. 

In an article in Knowledge for April and May, 1802, Mr. ]\Iaunder 
brings forward some important evidence in regard to the connection 
between sun spots and magnetic storms. The article concludes as fol- 
lows : 

In a period of nearly nineteen years, therefore, we have three mag- 
netic storms which stand out i)reeminently above all others during 
that interval. In that same period we have three gieat sun sjiot dis- 
plays — counting the two groups of April, 1882, together — which stand 
out with e(pial distinctness far above all other similar displays. And 
we find that the three magnetic storms were simultaneous with the 
greatest development of the spots. Is there any escape from the con- 
clusion that the two have a real and binding connection ? It may be 
direct, it may be indir(M*t and secondary oidy, but it must be real and 
effective, ' 

Consider that the period in question is practically some six tliousand 
eight hundred days, A magnetic storm does not last many hours ; a 
sun si>ot soon declines from its greatest development, or soon i)asses 
away from the center of the apparent disk. Suppose we take an out- 
side limit, and give a period of two days to a giant s[)ot to exercise its 
intluence or a magnetic storm to expend its violence ; what are the prob- 
abilities against 3 out of 3,400 of such periods of the one phenomenon 
agreeing with 3 (uit of 3,400 of the other, if they are not related ? If 
3,400 numbers were i)laced i]i one box and 3,400 more in a second, and 
one from each box were drawn at a time, what is tlie chance that the 
three highest numbers would be drawn from the one box simultane- 
ously with the three highest from the other, each to each, if the matter 
had not been prearranged ? Indeed, we might legitimately call the 
coincidence of A]>ril, 1882, a double one, and ask the odds against the 
four highest iuiml)ers from each box being so drawn. 

Between sun spots and storms of the second magnitude it is more 
difficult to make a satisfactory comparison, because it is not so easy to 
frame a satisfactory dehnition as to what constitutes a secondary dis- 
turbance. Nevertheless, the following brief table of large sun spots 
seen since the beginning of 1881, whicli were <;oinci<lent with consider- 
able disturbances, may prove of interest. The spotted area is given in 
millions of s(piare miles:

Some of the above, those iiiaiked with an asterisk, may fairly be

drawn from the correspondences between the greatest spots and tlie

tered, and storms as distinct have (^ccuired wlieii there have been only 
few spots, and those but small. n])nn the visible disk of the sun. The 
ta])lc is impoitaiit, therefore, not as adding to the weight of the evi- 
dence in favor of the connection Ix^wcen sun s])ots and magnetic dis- 
turbances, but as emphasi/ing a point which must not be forgotten. 
Though the diurnal and annual changes of teriestrial magnetism con- 
clusively i)rove the solar influence upon it, though the conclusion be- 
tween the general sun-si)ot cycle and tlie general magn«^tic cyle is 
clearly established, though even in minor irregularities the two curves 
closely correspond, and though unusually large sun spots are answeretl 
by unusually violent magnetic storms, we can not, as yet, ])roceed fur- 
ther and ex])ress the magnitude or character of the magnetic disturb- 
ances in terms of the sixitted area of the sun or of its principal groups 
at the time of observation. The conclusion to my own mind seems lo 
ix^ that though sun sjiots are the particular solar jihenoinenon most 
easily observed, wc must not infer, therefore, that their nnmber and 
extent afford the truest indication (»f the changers in the solar activity 
which prodnc(! the ])ertMrbations we remark in our magnetic needles. 

SoIkv inoHiiHciiccs. — f'spccial attention has been gi\'cn to the pho- 
tography of solar i»roininciiccs l»y Prof. (i. K. Hale ol' the Kenwood 
observatory, ('hicago. and by M. Deslandics of the Paris observatory. 
Pi(»f. Hale suggesteil two plans for the })iirpose; the lirst was to allow 
the image of the sun to drift across the radial slit of a powerful sjiec- 
troscope, tlie driving clock of the teles(;ope being slowed to produce the 
drift. Hthen there were a prominence (tn the sun's limb the length ol 
any bright line at the focus of the s))ectroscope would <letine the height 
of the ])rominenee. ainl as the snn drifted across the slit this line would 
continually change in length. If now the line in uscm ;'re made to pass 
through a slir ju -t within the focus of the obser\ ing telescope of the 
spectroscope cah 'd the ''second slit," so as to be in focus on a plate 
beyond the slit, all that is recpnred to photograph liie piominence is to 
uioyv the jilate slowly at light angle to the second slit, l-'icsh portions 
of the plate are thus e.xiiosed to corres])onding ])ortions of the promi-

nciicc, ;iii(l I lie |n<»iiii!i('iicc iiimj^c is l>uilt tip iVoii! a succession of bright 
line images of tlic slit. In tlie second iiielliod ])r(»])os('(l, the clock of 
the equatorial is so adjusted that the linage of the sun is kept in a iixed 
position. Tlie plate on the end of the collimatof which carries the slit, 
is then slowly )no\'e<l across the sun's limb at the point where the 
proniineuce is ])resent, and a second slit moving at the same speed 
before a stationary i)lat<' excludes the light from the specti'um on either 
side of the line in use, and reduces fogging to a minimum. 

In April, ISOl, Mr. Hale secured the first photograph of the sj^ectrnm 
of a prominence obtained without an eclipse. This showed two very 
strong, bright lines nearly at the centers of the dark solar bands Hand 
K. The same lines were photographed on subseqent occasions, but it 
was not until June 2.'>, that any new lines were discovered. On this 
occasitm four lines were obtained in the ultra-violet — a number since 
increased to six. Of these six, 5 lines belong, unmistakably, to the se- 
ries of hydrogen lines discovered by l)i'. ITuggins, in the ultra-violet of 
the sjiectra of Sirian stars. The sixth line forms a close double with 
one of these hydrogen lines {a) but its origin has not yet been accounted 
foi\ 

Mr. Hale's conclusion that 11 and K are not due to hydrogen, is abund- 
antly confirmed by Prof. A'oung and also by M. Deslandres, sinc^ethe 
measures have shown beyond a doubt that the "companion line to H," 
and not H itself, is the one really due to hydrog'en. Mr. Hale and ]\r. 
Deslandres ascribe these two giant bands of the solar spectrum to 
calcium. 

Mr. Hale has also met with considerable success in photographing 
the forms of solar prominences, some of the photographs showing a 
satisfactory amount of detail. In one instance a prominence photo- 
graphed at ivenwood was being sketched by Herr Feuyi at Kalocsa 
at the same nu>ment of time, and drawing and ])hotograph are in close 
accord. ^V suggestion by M. Deslandres that it inight be possible to 
photograph the entire chromosphere at a single exposure has been 
carried into effect by Mr. Hale, by means of a ''spectroheliograph," 
in which the slit of the spectroscope is made to travel across the image 
of the sun, and a precisely similar motion, but in an oi)posite direc- 
tion, is given to a second slit neaily in the focus of the view telescope, 
and so arranged that the K line of the spectrum of the fourth order 
falls upon it. Since the K line is always bright in tlie spectrum of the 
chromosphere and ])ronunences, it is easy, by shutting off the image of 
the sun by means of a diaphragm, to build up a complete jncture of 
the entire chromosphere an<l prominences, and so to produce what 
may be described as an "artificial total solar ecli])se."' The discovery 
Avliich Mr. Hale lias made that the H and K lines are always reversed 
in the facuhe has enabled him to extend the application of this prin- 
ciple. If the diaphragm covering the image of the sun be discarded 
a photograph will be obtained, not merely of the chromosphere and 
prominences, but of the disc of the sun itseTf, showing the spots and

a few minutes of time. 

The douhlv reversal of the 11 and Klines from faculae, a ]»henomen<)n 
shown upon ]»hoto^raphs taken at Kenwood. Paris, and Stonyhurst, is 
a discovery of special interest as bearing ii])on the interpretation of the 
enianiatical spectrum of Nora AvrUjw. and Prof, Hale has su])i)lemented 
this discovery by obtaining- a similar result -witli an integrating sjjec- 
troscope, the sun being treated as a star would be, its light as a whole, 
and not only from special regions of the disc, being subjected to exam- 
ination. 

M. Deslandres lias l»een making further exi)erimenTs ujton photo- 
graphing the corona without an eclipse. The ])rinciple upon which he 
])roceeds is to obtain i)hotographs of the sun from light of limited 
refrangibility, not by using eoloied media or stained plates, but by 
means of two ])risms, the second of which is arrange<l so as to reconi- 
pose the light dispersed by the first. i>ut only ceitain rays from the 
first prism are allow<'d to fall on the second: the resulting image of the 
sun is, theieforc, confine<l to those rays which can be sch'cted at pleas- 
ure. M. Deslandres" pnr])ose is, therefore, to find out foi' what rays 
the corona has the gientest l)rightness as com])ared with that oi" the 
sun, and to photograph the sun and its surroundings by theii' aid alone.

IJcUpses of 1891 and 1892. — In tlie year ISDl there were two eclipses 
of the sun, an annular eclipse on June 6, aiul a partial eclipse on No- 
vember 30-1 )ecember 1; and two eclipses of the moon. May 2.") and 
November 15, l)oth total. 

In 1892 there were also tour eclipses, two of the sun and two of the 
moon: a total eclipse of the sun April 26, and a, partial eclipse of the 
sun October 20; a partial eclipse of the moon May 11 and a total eclipse 
November 4. 

Eclipse of the vioon. 1891, May 23. — A total eclipse, visible throngliout 
the western )>art of the Pacific Ocean, Australia, Asia, Africa, and 
Europe. No observations of S])ecial importance. 

Eclipse of the sun, 1891, June (>. — Visible as an aninda-r eclipse only 
in the northern part of Si1)eria and the Arctic Ocean. A few observ- 
ations of contacts were secured in the western part of the United 
States. 

Eclipse of the moon, 1891, November i.->. — The total eclii>se of the moon 
on November 15, 1S91, was visible generally tliroughout North and 
Soutli America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. The whole of the eclipse 
was visible in the eastern and central parts of the United States while 
in the Avestern part the moon rose eclipsed. Dr. Dolleu selected from 
l)hotographic plates nmde at Potsdam some 138 stars to l)e occulted at 
established observatories, but the weather seems to have been gener- 
ally unfavorable. A few contact observatiims were secured.

Southern Pacific: no observations of imixntance reported. 

Eclipse of the moon, 18'J2, May 1 1. — The phenomenon of the partial 
eclipse of the moon on May 11, 1802, was studied at Greenwich and 
elsewhere, and the occnltation of a considerable numl)er (tf small stars 
was observed.

ui)on the 1874 transit is only ])artly (•onii)lete(l and consideraWh' work 
still remains to be done npon the reductions for 18SL*, tlioniili results 
for the solar ])aralla\ and certain (elements of the orbit of X'eniis. which 
are practically tinal, have been ])ublished. Some occuUations of stars 
by the moon, telegra[)ic determinations of differences of lon^yitude, tidal 
ol)servations, and pendulum experiments still remain to be reduced, 
for which, however, no funds seem to be availabh'. 

Dr. Auwers' result* for the Geruuin heliometer measures of the 
transit of \'enus in 1874 is a solar ])arallax of 8".877 ± 0".04;}, there 
being- in all •■>()8 measures at four different stations; in 1881* four sta- 
tions were occupied and 44(! measures were obtained, the resulting ])ar- 
allax being 8".879± (K'.(>37. 

J)r. IJattermanu. of the Berlin Observatory, has deduced a vahu' of 
the solar parallax from L'50 occultations of stars between A})rd, 1884, 
and October, 1885, having by careful observation beeu able to utilize 
the occultations of a consideiable number of faint stars near new moon. 
The resulting solai' i)ara]lax is8".704± 0".0]0. 

The determination of the solar parallax by means of nu'ridian (►b- 
servations of Mars at oi)])osition was attempted in 18()U, and again in 
in 1877, but the results obtained were generally considered by astnm- 
omers as too large, there being indications of a systematic error in the 
observations of Mars, or of the comparison stars, or of both. A slight 
nioditication of the previous methods of observation was suggested by 
Prof. lOastnum, and a circular was issued by the V. S, Naval Observa- 
tory re(iuesting' the coo|)eration of other observatories in tiie obsersa-

two ortljiee lioiirs liigli at the time of the tirst and second contacts; it 
liad set in most i)hices on tlie Athintic coast before tlie lirst contact, 
and in Washington was only ten minutes high. Reports from twenty - 
five observers in the United States have been forwarded to the Xaval 
Observatory for reduction. The whole transit was visible in China, 
Japan, eastern Silieria, and the Malaysian Islands, while in England 
egress took place soon after sunrise. No phenomena of special impor- 
tance seem to have been noted. In Euro])e several observers saw the 
''black drop" or ligament. At the Lick Observat(n\v a careful series ot 
observations was made, both visual and ])hotographic, and the planet 
was looked for, but without success, before it entered upon the sun's 
disk. 

For more than an hour after ingress The planet was also carefully ex- 
amined, with the Sfi-inch Lick telescope, by Profs. Jlolden and Keeler. 
It ''was perfectly round, and in the ))est moments sharply terminated 
- • - . Not the slightest trace of a satellite was seen; and both 
observers were confident that no such body could then be on the sun's 
face and esca])e detection unless it were exceedingly minute." 

Vent'S. — The conclusion readied by Schiaparelli that \'enus rotates 
very slowly ui)on its axis, in fact in about thesann^ tinu' that it rotates 
about the sun, has been challenged l)\ several observers. JMM. Niesteii 
and Stuyvacrt, of the Brnssels Observatory, have given the matter 
careful study, and .AI. Trouvelot has ]>ublished a series of observations 
and sketclM's from 1S76 to ISin, from which In^ concludes tliat the rota 
tion does not differ greatly from twenty-four lu)urs. 

An exhaustive discussion (»f recent i)ul)lications concerning the 
physical appearance of Venus is ]mnted by Dr. Wislicenus in the 
VIcrfeljaJir.sschriff, v. 27. ])p. 271-301*. It is (luite evident that further 
accurate observations are necessary. 

The value of the diameter of ^>nus. deduced by Dr. ^Vuwers from the 
heliometer measures l)y the (Tcrnmn Tiansit of X'enus parties, in 1874 
and 1882, is 1(5". 80. 

Thi-; Eabtii: \'<(rlati(>ii of icrrcsirinl hifiiiule. — One of the most im- 
portant subjects that has l>een under discussion during the past two 
years — important to astronomy and geo<lesy alike — is the variation of 
terrestrial latitudes, the strong suspicion of whicli has l)een confirmed 
by recent very accuiate observations, and when once admitted is 
abundantly fortified l)y the discussion of older observations. 

There seems to be now distinct (nidence of a rotation of the geo- 
graphical rcmnd the astrononnCal pole in 427 days. The problem has of 
course attracted the attention of the ablest astronomers and mathema- 
ticians, but the credit for the ablest discussion and the most satisfactory 
solution is undoubtedly due to Mr. S. C Chandler. The following sum- 
mary of his work is taken from a re\iew in the Monthly N^oUees (V. 53, 
No. 4j.

and Pulkowa. which sliowe<l changes in ai)])arent latitude, not only 
strikingly symi)athetic among themselves, but of the same range and 
l)eriodicity as those noticed in 18X5; and Mr. Chandler -'was led to 
make further investigations on the subject, which seem to establish the 
nature of the law of these changes, and proceeded (ISill, Xovember) to 
present them iji due order." 

The conse(iuent series of j)apers in the A.sfnmoniica} Jonrnal can 
hardly tail to take its ]>lace as (»ue of the astronomical classics. The 
following summary is made i>ui]»osely very brief because tlie seri<'S is 
not yet com])]ete, and no doubr mm-h still remains to be said on such 
an imi)ortant subject. But it will l»e seen that during the year ISIH' 
(including ]»erliai>s tlie end of lS!>l)a most imjiortant a<lvance has 
been made in fundanuMital astronomy. 

The first paper (regarding that already juentioned as preliminary) 
deals with the observations with the Pulkowa vertical circle (bSGo- 
lS7o), "which hav<' been juovcx-ative of so much in((uiry, so far without 
any solution of the anomalies which they show in regard to the <pies- 
tion of latitude variation.'' and the Washington prime \'crtical observa- 
tions (ISCU-ISUT), '•'the most accuiate determinations of declination 
e\er made at tlie ^'aval ()bser\alory."' which yet '"resulted in anomalous 
values olthe aberration constant in tiie different yeais and a negative 
]»arallax in all." Mr. Chandler tinds that a iL'Tday jx'riod in the lati- 
tude •■ furiushcs the true key to the troubies<tme discordances in the 
Pulkowa latitudes." and "traces to their origin the anomalies in the 
Washington obs<'i'\ations." Further, the comparison of tiie two seiies 
leads to the same <-onclnsion as that ali-eady shown from the simul- 
taneous series at l>eilin and (yand)iidgc (rni1<'(l States) in 18S.^ as to 
the direction of the polar motion. In the lu'xt ]>aper it is mentioned 
that observations at Melbourne ( ISfJ.J-lSSI i and liCAclcn (ISJI.'UlStjT) 
are in complete accordance with thos«! made at the sanu' tinu' at Pul- 
kowa and Washington ; ami that the 427-day p<'iiod a<'counts for the 
contradictory results ()])tained by Di. Van licnnekelcr at Leyden. The 
jnotion of the eaith's i)ole tor the |)eiiod ls(i{)-| sjo js tlius fairly estab-

indicate it I'otutioii (»!' the l»uU' in little iiiori' than a ycaf and witli a 
lar.Qer ladius tliaii that of ISGO-ISSO, the ran,-;e beinj;- about 1". In tlie 
same paper Mr. Cliandler states that Biinkley's observations at Dub- 
lin (1808-1813 and lS18-bS22) are found to indieate a rotation in about 
a year, with range more than l'\ ''wherein lies tlie solution of the hith- 
erto unsolved enigma of Brinkley's singular lesults which led to the 
spirited and almost acrimonious dispute between Brinkley and Pond 
Avith regard to stellar parallaxes." The details were promised in a 
later paper, but have not yet been given, owing doubtless to the ne- 
cessity of attending to a vitally important point which will presently 
appear. 

In papers 5 and t! are i^resented the results of an enormous mass of 
reductions extending from 1837 to 1891, made at no fewer than seven- 
teen observatories. The w^hole is broken up into forty-live series, or 
short groups, for the purposes of this particular discussion; and the 
result of this minute inquiry, contirmcd (or ])erlia])s suggested) by the 
observations of Bradley and Brinkley above mentioned, seenu'd clear, 
viz, that the " instantaneous rate of angular motion of the pole has 
been diminishing during the last half century at a sensibly uniform 
rate, by its one-hundred-thousaudth i^art." 

Mr. Chandler was led to modify this statement in a remaikable 
manner and within a few weeks. 

Astronomers had hesitated to accept the 427-day period, even in face 
of the very strong evidence of the 18G0-1880 observations, owing to the 
difticulty in accounting for it theoretically. It had been iiointed out by 
Euler that, treating the earth as a rigid body, the pei'iod of rotation 
of the }>ole must be 300 days. Prof. Newcomb, however, happily 
X)ointed out that a (lualitied rigidity (either actual viscosity or the 
composite character due to the ocean) atibrded an ex])]anation of this 
longer period ; and after this suggestion Mr. Chandler's 427-day 
period was well and even warmly received. But the further elaboi-a- 
tion of this hypothesis by a changing period was a new difficulty. 

Prof. Xewcomb, who had reconciled the tirst article of the hyi)othesis 
with theory, was not slow to declare that the second was irreconcilable. 
Mr. Chandler's reply, in i)aper 6, is a model of controversial courtesy 
and skill. He says: ''It should first be said that in beginning these 
investigations I deliberately i)ut aside all teachings of theory, because 
it seemed to nu^ high time that the facts should be examined by a 
purely inductive ]>rocess: that the nugatory results of all attempts to 
detect the existence of the I<'.ulerian period probably arose from a 
defect of the theory itself; and that the entangled condition of the 
whole subject rc(piired that it should l)e examined afresh by i»rocesses 
unfettered by any precom-ei\'ed notions whatever. . . . The ap- 
peal to observation, treated irrespectixe of theory in the present 
series of papers, shows that a rotation of the i)oIe really exists, but 
{(() at a daily rate of but 00.85 (for 1875), and (/>) that this velocity is

not oiH' ntriiihlc rotation of the i»ole. but two cotistdul rotations (with a 
(pialiticatioii). one in 4L'7 da\sand the other in about a year. The(|ual- 
iticatio!i is that the (iniplitiHlf of the latter is appareiitl\' Aariabh-, not 
the period. The superj)osition of these two rotations is almost exactly 
e([idvalent. for the obser\ations a\aihible, to the law (or summarx ot 
observation, as it nH.nht fairly be called) pr«'\ioiisly announced. To 
make clear the no\elty of this discoveiy it may be remaiked that, 
althouLi'h tluctuations in zt'iiitli distances of annual ]>erio(l have loni; 
been reco.unized, tliey have iienerally been ascribed to temperature 
effects, in which case the maxima and niinima for all stations in the 
Xorthern Hemisphere sluuild occur at the sjiuie eixx-li — -sax , midsummer 
and midwinter. But this is not the case with the annual term now 
reveale<l. The epoch chaiiiies with the Ionf;itu<le, showing' that the 
pole moves just as in the case of the 4L*7-day term. 

It is somewhat remarkable that two formuhe differing so much 
in form should be fouiul to rei)resent the obsei\ations almost. 
e(pially well. Api)arently this is to be attiibuted chiefly to the varia- 
bility in am])litude of the annual term, and as yet this variability has 
not been accounted for. But to have advanced the work to this stage 
in such a short time is a great achievement, and much may conlidently 
be expected from Mr. ("haiidlei's future work. lie i>oiiits (»ut. in a 
paper dated January 2, 1893. that the discovery of these periodic in- 
('(pndities in the latitude makes it necessary to go over much old work 
afresh, and is himself leading the way with a discussion of the aberra 
tion constant. 

in the saiin- paix-r lie shows that the recent results obtained at Ber- 
lin, Prague, Strasbiiig, I'ulkowa, Ifockville, and Honolulu give a meai- 
correction to his tlnal forninia of only five days in the eiKX'ii; '"and tlif 
accordance of tlie separate values is high testimony to the skill of tlie 
observers, to whom astronomers owe a (leej) debt of gratitude tbi- their 
laborious and conscientious work."

ada Pailiaiueut has decluivd as legal the uoriiial hours from Green- 
wich adoDted since 1883 by railways and later by a great number of 
towns. lu England a commission iias reported favorably upon the 
system of hourly meridians, and the (rovernment has strongly recom- 
mended it to the colonies. In France, Paris mean time is used for all 
the country, including ^Vlgeria. In r>elgium a commission has recom 
mended the hourly meridian system, with (rreenwich as the starting 
point. In Holland the Ooveriiment has authorized the adoption of 
Greenwich time for interior railway service. In Prussia mean Euro 
pean time (mitteleuroi);iisclie Zcit or ^I. K. Z.) which is one hour greater 
than Greenwich time, replaced Berlin time from the 1st of June, 1801, 
for the railway service of the interior. l>avaria, W'iirtemberg, and 
Baden have also decided on M. E. Z., which will also be used in Al- 
sace-Lorraine. Austria and Hungai> ado]>ted M. K. Z. from October 
1, 1891, for lailway, i)OSt, and telegraph service, and there is a strong 
feeling for its adoption in civil life. In Italy, at the instance of the 
Academy of Sciences of Bologna, which favors the meridian of-leru- 
salem, there was a i^lan for assembling a new congress at Rome, but this 
however, seems to have been abandoned. There is here as well as in 
Switzerland a strong sentiment in favor of Greenwich as the standard. 

At the Cape of Good IIo]»e the extension of railways brought about 
the adoi)tion of a single-standaid time throughout the colony in Feb- 
ruary, 181)1*. Ihc meridia.n one an<l one-half hours east of Greenwich 
is in use for all i»uri)oses hi Cape Colony and the Orange Free State, 
and all time signals arc given at Greenwich noon. 

tSki/ </l(ii('s. — The after-glows that attracted so much attention in \Sf>3 
and 1884 showed some signs of return, though in lesser degree, in the 
early ])art of 1891. The tint and g<'neral appearance arc reported to 
have greatly resembled the auroral displays. 

The systematic study of these "luminous night clouds" has been 
taken up by Prof. Foerster and Herr Jesse, of the Berlin observatory. 

The Moon. — A valuable contribution has been made to the study 
of the moon in "An essay on the distribution of the moon's heat and 
its variation with the phase,'' by Mr. F.W. Very, of the Allegheny Ob- 
servatory — a paper Avhich gained the iirize proposed in July, 1890, by 
the Utrecht Society of Arts and Sciences. Mr. Very's investigation 
was made with one of Langley's " bolometers," and the principal results 
may best be described in the author's own words : 

First, that visible rays form a much larger proportion of the total 
radiation at the full than at the partial phases, the nmximuni for light 
Ix'ing much more ])ronounced than that fo" the heat. Next, as has 
been foreseen from the eccentricity of the heat areas, their greater ex- 
tension toward the western lind), and the greater steepness of the sun- 
set than of the sunrise gradient, the diminution of the heat from the 
full to the third (juarter is slower than its increase from the tirst (juarter 
to the bill. Finally, there <>; a fair agreement between these results and 
those of Lord IIonsc, which extends even to some minor details, such 
as the attainmeiic of the hiiiuest heat at little* before the full.

I-'oUow ing is Prof. Harnard's own ac(M)Uiit of his dis('ov<'ry, in describ- 
ing his search for new objects in the Astrcuiomical .lournal: 

N(»t hing of sjx'cial importance was encountered until the night of 
September t). when, in carefully examining the immediate region of the 
planet Ju))iter, I detected an exceedingly small star close to the planet 
ami near the third satellite. I at once measured the distance and jh)- 
sition angle with reference to sateilite ill. 1 tlu'U tried to get meas- 
ures referred to. hi) )iter, but found that one of the wires had got broken, 
and the other loosened. Hefore anything further could be done the 
object disai)peared in the glare about -hipiter. 'riiough I was ])ositive 
the object was a new satellite, 1 had only the one set of measures, w liicli 
was liardly ]>roof enough for aiinonncement. 

r rei>la(M'd the wires the ii(»\t morning. 'IMie next night with tli(^ 
great teleseoi)e, being IM'of. Schaeberle's. he \-er>- kindly ga\(' tlu' in- 
strument iij) to me, and I had the pleasure of veiilyiiig the discovery, 
and secured a good set of measures at <'loiigatioii. 

.lust what tlu' magnitude of the satellite is it is at present quite im- 
possible to tell. Taking into consideration its position, however, in the 



720 PROGRESS OF ASTRONOMY FOR 1891 AND 1<S92. 

j^lare of JLii)itei-, it would perhaps not be fainter than the tliirteentli 
magnitude. 

The satellite has been seen and its position observed at the University 
of Virginia, at Priuceton, at Ealing, and at Evanston; the 18.] inch re- 
fractor at Evanston ])eing apparently the smallest instrument with 
which it has thus far been seen, and it was then reported as being a 
much more difhcnlt object than Ariel or rmbriel, the satellites of 
Uranus, though Mr. Reed with tlie lio-inch Princeton glass found it 
an easier object than Ariel. 

The new satellite's orbit seems to lie sensibly in the i)lane of -hipiter's 
equator; the distance of the satellite from the center of the planet is 
probably over ll(),()(){) miles and its [)eriod of rotation about 11'' 57'" 37\ 

Diameter of Jupiter. — An admirable series of measures of the diam- 
eter of Jupiter, by Dr. Schur, with the (Kittiugen heliometer, is pub- 
lished in No. 3073 of the Astronomische Wachrichfen. The effect of per- 
sonal eqnation was eliminated by the use of a reversion prism eye- 
piece. Dr. kSchur tinds the disk a sensibly true ellipse with diameters 
37".4: and liry.i), a Hattening of l-15i. 

Mr. Burnham communicated to the November meeting of the Royal 
Astronomical Society, in 1891, a paper on the spots and markings of 
Jupiter as observed with the 12inch equatorial of the Lick Observatory. 
Noting the decided changes of color in the different markings on tlie 
planet's surface, he expresses the opinion that the red color is an indi- 
cation of age, or, in other Avords, when a spot or marking other than the 
white spots first appears it is dark or black, but after some time turns red. 
During the year 1801 the planet was extremely interesting, owing to the 
remarkable amount and variety of detail displayed on its surface. The 
two hemispheres were, as usual, strongly in contrast in their individual 
markings. In the southern hemisphere, besides the great red spot, 
new spots api)eared, and a great number of round white spots were visi- 
ble. These white spots are quite characteristic of the southern hemis- 
pliere, though individual white sjiots have at rare intervals been seen 
in the northern liemis[>here. In the latter a system of small dark spots 
appeared, with very short periods of rotation. Mr. Burnham reports 
that the great red spot liad regained much of its former distinctness, 
both in color and form. 

Saturn. — On September 22, 1891, the earth ])assed through the 
])lane of Saturn's rings. From the 22d of the month to October 30 the 
earth was above the plane of the rings, while the sun was below that 
l>hine and, consequently, sliining on the southern side of the rings. 
After October 30 the sun was again shining on the north side. Tlie 
phenomenon of the disappearance of the rings was described by sev- 
eral observers. 

Uranus. — A search ibr new satellites made by several observers at 
the Lick Observatory from 1889 to 18;) L has resulted negatively. The

Neptune. — Mr. Asapli Uall, Jr., linds that observations of the- satel- 
Hte with tlie L'O-iueh Wa sliiugton refractor from October, ISOl, to 
March, 1892, contirni the reality of the sh)w motion, nearly proportional 
to the tinn% of the orbit })lane of the satellite with respect to the orbit 
of Xeptune, to which Mr. JMartii called attention and which M. Tisse- 
rand shows may result from a slight tiatteuing of the i)lauet.

ered on November 14, 1800, by Charlois, at Nice, and subseiiuentl.x fouml 
to be a new one, has been named Clarissa. To No. r)23, ])hoto,i;raphed 
by Dr. \Volf NoYember2S (the tirst asteroid discovered by i»liotography), 
he has given the name Bruc^ia, in honor of Miss Catherine W. Bruce, 
who has contributed so generously for the advancement of astronomy. 

In JSitl t w^enty-two new asteroids were added to the group revolving 
between ^Mars and Jupiter, and photography now having become a 
powerful aid in the detection of these snnill bodies, tlie number still 
likely to be found seems almost limitless. The last on the list for 1891, 
No. 323, was discovered l»y Dr. Wolf u[)on his photographic i^lates. 
Another asteroid was, in fact, found upon the same plate, but it ]»roved 
to b(? identical with 27.") (Sapientia). 

I*alisa, on August 11, 1891, discovered what was for a time supposed 
to be a new i)lanet, but it was found to be identical with 149, Medusa, 
discovered in 1875; 275, which had not been seen since the oi)position of 
its discovery (1888), has been found again by the aid of photogra])hy; 
318 is interesting from the almost exact commensiirability of its ])e- 
liod with that of Ju[>iter.

Asteroids of 1892. — The further and very successful application of 
photography to the discovery of asteroids by Dr. Wolf, at Heidelberg-, 
and by M. Charlois, at Xice, resulted in such rapid additions to the list 
that the notation of these bodies was thrown into the utmost con- 
fusion. Hitherto the simple numbering in the order of discovery had 
been a rule easily ap])lied by the discoverer, but where several aster- 
oids were found upon a single photographic plate it was not always 
possible to determine until later observations and computations whether 
they were really new asteroids or not, and when the planetary char- 
acter of the object was recognized it was frequently found imprinted 
upon some earlier photograph. 

It was accordingly suggested, in Xo. 26C) of the Astronomical Jour- 
Hid, that as a temporary omission of the number is attended with less 
inconvenience than is caused by the employment of an erroneous one, 
the numbers for the asteroids after number 322 should be omitted 
until the dif&cult task of fixing a definite enumeration should be 
delegated by common consent to some one authority to which all could 
defer. 

Common consent seemed to point to the Berlin Kechen-Institut as 
the only j)lace actually in possession of the needful resources for 
solving the questions of identity coutiiumlly arising, and it was agreed 
that to avoid further confusion Prof. Krueger, director of the Kiel 
observatory, the European "Central-Stelle," and editor of the Astro- 
nomisc'he jS^achriehten, should assign to each asteroid a provisional 
notation (1892 A, 181)2 B, 18<)2 C, etc.) in the order of its announce- 
ment to the " Telegraphische Central-Stelle;" and that the definitive 
numeration should be subsequently un'dertaken by Prof. Tietjen, 
director of the Rechen-Institut, in Berlin. In this definitive assign- 
ment of numbers those asteroids will be omitted, for which sufficient 
material is not available for a determination* of the orbits. 



PROGRESS OF ASTRONOMY FOR 1891 AND 1892. 



72.-5 



The first asteroid to wliicli the new notation was assi<;ned was that 
discovered by Wolf, at Heidelberg^, on August 1*12, 18!>2; it was pro- 
visionally known as ISUU A, and subsequently received its more per- 
manent designation, number o-'JS, from Prof. Tietjen, and its name, 
Badenia, from tlie discover. 

In ISIH* tbirty new asteroids were announced; one of those, 1,S92 B, 
has already proved to be identical with Erigone, 1(>."); and it is possible 
that further study will identify some of the others. 

Some slight discrepancies are still found in the different lists of as- 
teroids for the year, but as the new system of notation becomes <'stab- 
lished they will probably disappear. 

In the following list all the discoveries were by photograi)hy except 
o24, 3-G, 327, and 331. lu the case of the pliotograi)hic discoveries the 
date given is that of the earliest photograph on which the planet ap- 
pears. It was in many cases not noticed on the plate till considerably 
later, which accounts for the departures from chronological order in the 
"date of discovery " :

724 PROGRESS OF ASTRONOMY FOR 1891 AND 1892. 



OBSERVATORIES. 

The chief sources of inforinatiou couceming tlie recent work of as- 
tronomical observatories are the Vicrteljahrsschri/t der Astronomischen 
Gesellschaftj for continental and a few American observatories, and the 
Monthhj Notices for English observatories; in addition to these are the 
reports of tlie observatories themselves — thouglr fewpul)lish independ- 
ent aunnal reports — and notes in current journals, chiefly the Observa- 
tory and the Sidereal Messenger. 

In the following resume the length of the notes is by no means always 
in i)roportion to the imj)ortance of the institution. The character of 
the work of the older observatories is generally too well known to 
leqniremore than the briefest mention, while for the new ol)serva- 
tories an eftbrt is made to put on record as much information with re- 
gard to the equipment, etc., as can be found. In most instances it 
has not seemed necessary to distinguish between the two years covered 
by the review. 

Among papers of interest on observatories is a series of notes on 
visits to some American observatories made by Mr. H. F. Newall, of 
the Cambridge Observatory, England, and published in the Observatory. 

Abastuman. — A new mountain observatory has been established 
at Abastuman (2'^ 51'" 2;> E, + 41° 42'.4). It is 4,5()(> feet above sea 
level and is equipped with a 0-inch telescope by Kepsold. 

Adelaide: Todd. — Eeobservation of Weisse stars; observations of 
Jupiter; weather service, 

Alabama University. — An astronomical observatory attached to 
the University of Alabama, near Tuscaloosa, was comijleted in the sum- 
mer of 1844. The building was originally 54 feet in length by 22 in 
breadth in the center. In 1858 another apartment, 40 feet in length by 
20 in width, was added to the east wing. The instruments consist of 
a 4-inch transit circle of 5-feet focus by Siiuins, the circle being 3 feet 
in diameter, divided to five minutes, and read by four microscopes to 
single seconds; a clock by Molyueaux; an equatorial, also by Simms, of 
8 inches aperture and 12 feet focus, provided with a filar micrometer 
and double image micrometer, the hour circle being divided to one 
second of time and thedeclinati(m circle to live seconds of arc, read by 
opposite verniers. As an accessory to the equatorial theie is an excel- 
lent clock by Dent. There are also two portable achromatic tele- 
scopes — one by Dolland of 7 feet focal length and 4 inches ajierture, 
the other by Simms of 5 feet focal length and 3 inches aperture — and 
reflecting circle by Trough ton, of 10 inches aperture, read by three 
verniers to twenty seconds. 

The observatory was built and the instruments pur(5liased and 
mounted under the supervision of Prof, F. A, P, Barnard. A woodcut 
of the building is given in number 15 of the publications of the Astro-

Columbia (Missouri) : Updegraff— The observatory of the University 
of Missouri (lat. + 38° 56' 50" ; long, l^^ T" G^4 west of Washington) 
was first built in 1853, and then consisted of a small wooden structure 
in which were mounted a 4-iuch Fitz equatorial, a 2ii6-inch transit by 
Brunner, a sidereal clock, and other smaller instruments. It was used 
for the i)urpose of instructiug students in astronomy, and few changes 
or additions were made till 1880, when a 7^-inch equatorial by Merz & 
INIahler was bought. The building was then removed to another part 
of the college grounds and enlarged by the erection of a l)rick tower, 
with a dome, for the newly acquired telescope. Soon after a sidereal 
clock, a chronograph, and spectroscope, all by Fauth & Co., were pur- 
chased. A 2-inch altazimuth, by Blunt, of jSiCW York, had been bought 
some years before. The director at tliat time was Prof. Joseph Fi(;k- 
lin, who died in September, 1880. 

Prof. Milton Updegraft" was appointed director in July, 1890, and 
while much of his time is taken up in teaching classes in astronomy 
and mathematics, he has done excellent work in the observation of 
planets and comets, besides a redetermination of latitude and longi- 
tude, the latter by telegraphic connection with the observatory of 
Washington University, St. Louis. The obseivatory building has been 
enlarged by the addition of an ottice room and a library.

Dudley: Boss. — Miss Catherine Wolfe Bruce, of New York city, 
who is already known for her muniticent gifts in aid of astronomy, has 
given 82.5,000 to the Dudley Observatory for the increase of its perma 
nent endowment. From various sources the additional sum of #31,700 
has been secured to defray the cost (►f rebuilding the observatory on a 
new site and of furnishing it with anew e(iuatorialof 12inchesaperture, to- 
gether with other improvements in its equipment. The cost of the 
telescope is provided for by Eobert C. and Charles L. Pruyn; it is to 
be of the most approved modern construction. The cost of re-estab- 
lishing the Olcott meridian circle (8 inches aperture), c<mstructed 
by Pistor and Martins, of Berlin, in 1858, together with a colliinatiiig 
meridian mark and other improvements, is also provided for. The 
old site is very unfavorable to astronomical observation, owing to its 
l)roximity to the four tracks of tlie New York Central Kailioad, which 
with a very heavy traffic, grou]) around the base of Observatory Ilill 
at a distance of about 150 yards from the instiuments. The new site is 
about 2 miles southwest of the present location upon a plot of about 6 
acres. 

DlTNSlNK: Bamhdui. — On February 20, 1892, Sir Pobert I Jail was ap- 
pointed to succeed Prof. Adams at (.'ambridge, and the vacancy in the 
directorship of the Dunsink Observatory was tilled 0(;tober 22 by the 
api)ointment of Dr. A. A. Kambaut. Dr. Itambaut's assistant is Mr. 
A. K. Lyster. The 15-inch retlector has been used for stellar ]>hotog 
raphy, principally for determinations of stellar parallax.

of iiebuliie lias been imdertakeii and some furtlier observations have 
been made at Duneclit, but little observing has been done pending the 
completion of the new buildings. The main building of the new ob- 
servatory is to be 180 feet from east to west, terminating in two towers 
surmounted by domes, or rather ^^drums." The eastern tower, rising 
to a height of 75 feet, will contain the 15-inch Grubb refractor, while 
the 24-inch reflector from the old site at Caltou Hill will be mounted 
in the western dome, A single range of rooms, opening on a corridor 
on the south, extends from tower to tower. The roof is designed as 
an asphalted platform, affording free communication between the 
towers. Beginning at the west there are a spectroscope room, general 
laboratory, electrical room, cleaning room, mechanic's workshop, chrono- 
graph and class room. Light and dark photographic rooms, as well 
as a computing room for tlie equatorial and photographic work, are in 
the eastern tower. A central extension of the building toward the 
south, 80 feet by 26 teet, will contain the chief computing room, hall- 
way, etc., director's room, and iire-proof library — 34 feet by 23 feet, 
with a light iron gnllery affording access to the upper shelves. An up- 
per story to the southern part of this portion of the building, 00 feet 
in length, is designed for optical work. In the basement will be placed 
the heating apparatus, a dynamo, and accumulators for supplying elec- 
tricity for lighting the observatory and illuminating the instruments. 
In the observatory there will thus be but one chimney. 

The transit circle will be in a separate building, with light walls and 
roof of corrugated iron, 80 feet west of the western tower, accessible by 
a covered way. The remaining buildings are the astronomer's house, 
two assistants' houses, and a gate lodge. 

Geneva : Gautier. — Col. Emile Gautier died on February 24, 1801, 
and was succeeded in the directorship by his son, li. Gautier. The 
principal work of the observatory is the testing of watches and chro- 
nometers, and meteorological observations, A number of observations 
of comets have also been made, 

Glasgow. — Meridian circle observations. 

GoTTiNGEN: Schur. — Observ^ations of asteroids, comets, andPra^sepe,

(tOODSELl: Payne. — The observatory of Carleton College received a 
new name, in honor of Mr, C. F, Goodsell. the founder of Carleton Col- 
lege, on June 11, 1891. 

The new Williams equatorial, costing $15,000, was installed in 1891. 
Its clear aperture is 1G.2 inches and focal length 22 feet, the lenses 
having been figured by Brashear upon Hastings' curves and the mount- 
ing jjrovided by Warner and Swasey. 

GoTHA : ifars-er.— Reduction of previous observations. The director's

latitude (in about 3G5 and 427 days, respectively). A successful lonj^i- 
tude campaign has been carried on with Montreal, and tlie diiference of 
louiiitude between Greenwich and Paris has been redetermined by 
English and French ol)servcrs. Some additions to the e(|nipment have 
been made and the details of a.n electric-light installation hav<' been 
settled.

Harvard College : PiclrrDiy. — Vvith the meridian circle the obser- 
vation of stars in the southern Durchmusterung zone (—9° oO' to — 14^

been emi>loyed on observations })artly ])hotometric and i)artly micro- 
metric, wliile the ])rincipal work done with the west equatorial has 
been the study by Argelander's method of the changes in the light of the 
variable stars of long ])eriod. 

Photogra])hic observations, provided foi' by tlie Henry Draper me- 
morial, have l)een carried on c(mtinuously, generally throughout every 
clear night, and with tlie aid of three telescopes. 

An attemi)t to secure a suitable location for tlui JJoyden I'und observ- 
ing station on Wilson's Peak, in southern Oaliforiua, proved unsuccess- 
ful, but an e.\pe<lition sent (uit to l^eru, under the direction of Prof. 
W. II, Pickering, lelt Cambridge in December, ISiM)^ and established 
a station abont .'J miles northwest of ^^i'e(inii)a. where a L'5-inch 
eipiatorial was mounted an<l observations were commenced. The 
station is over S,()()() feet aboxc sea level, and has a nearly cloudless 
sky during a large part (»f the year; t4ie thermometer rarely falls be- 
low M)^ F., and rarely goes above 70°. The brilliancy of the stars is

Kenwood: Hale. — The Kenwood Physical Observatory, the private 
observatory of Prof. George E. Hale, had its inception in a spectro- 
scopic laboratory erected in Chicago in the summer of 1888. The 
addition of a tower and wing during the winter of 1890-'91 brought 
the building to its present form, and it now includes a reception room, 
library, equatorial room, ''slit room," "grating room," photographic 
<lark room, general laboratory, and workshop. The grating room 
contains a 4-inch concave grating of 10 feet radius of curvature, 
mounted in the manner employed by Prof, Rowland. A shorter 
girder allows the use of a grating of only 5 feet radius in cases when 
the light source is too faint to admit of the highest dispersion. Sun- 
light is furnished by a heliostat on a pier some distance to the north 
of the building. Electrical power is supplied through a gas engine 
and storage battery and also from the main city wires. 

The mounting of the equatorial was finished in March, 1891, by

on the international chart of the heavens, and a considerable number 
of plates comprised in the zone assigned to Oxford have been completed. 
Ex})erimental work has also been done for the committee in charge of 
the international chart. 

A convenient observatory has been erected contiguous to the main 
building for the exclusive use of university students. This observatory 
isfurnished with two small transit circles, three telescopes, one of which 
is a retlector of 15 inches aperture, and subsidiary apparatus. 

Paris: TisseranfL — In the report for 1891 the director stated that 
the ('iam})ey circle had been ai)plied to the investigation of the latitude 
and the question of its variation; observations to deternune the con- 
stant of aberration were completed, and besides the usual i)lanetary 
and cometary observations, a considerable number of measurcMiicnts of 
double stars and mi(;rometric measures of nebnhc were made. 

IMiotograjtlHc work upon tin' great (rhart and nj)ou the moon has

proposes to erect an observatory at San Diego as a memorial to her 
husband; an 18-inch object glass has been ordered. 

San Fernando: Viniegra. — Capt. J. Viniegra has been appointed 
director, to succeed Capt. Pujazon. 

Smith (Beloit, Wis.): Bacon. — Sun-spot observations, etc. 

Stonyiturst: Sidfireaves. — Photography of the solar spectrnm and 
of stellar spectra; drawings of sun spots aud measures of the chromo- 
s I here and prominences. A new 15-inch refractor has been purchased 
with the fund raised to the memory of the late Father Perry. 

Strasrurg: Becl-er. — Tlie meridian circle has been used in observ- 
ing the zone —2° to —0°, and also the sun, moon, and planets. Some 
defects in the construction of the altazimuth were remedied and the 
instrument was used in a careful series of observations for the determ- 
ination of the variation of latitude, beginning in May, 1891, and ending 
in March, 1892. 

Sydney. — Transit-circle Avork, observations of double stars and of 
comets; photographic work for the international chart, photographs 
of comets and of Mars. Weather-chart service. 

Temrle (Rugby) : Double stars; uebuhe photography. 

Toulouse: Bigourdau. — From an account of the history of the ob- 
servatory by M. Bigourdau it appears that it was <niginally estab 
lished in 1729 on one of the towers of the rampart of the town. Gari- 
puy nuide some observations there, but afterwards erected an observa- 
tory on his own house and suj^erseded it by a larger and more commo- 
dious one in 1770. Darquier assisted him for a time, but afterwards 
erected an observatory of his own. Vidal had commenced his astro- 
nomical work at the observatory of Garipuy, which, however, became 
the property of the states of Languedoc after the death of the founder 
in L782. Vidal retired in 1807, and, after several attempts to improve 
the observatorv, it was decide<l in 1840 to erect a new one at the ex-

Tnited States Naval Observatorv: ^fc^<(i^■.— At t lie time of the 
last report of the Sui)eriutendeut, September 29. 1S92, the new buildinji's 
were not ready for occupancy. The usual routine obser\ ations have 
been somewhat interrupted by prei)arations made for the removal of 
the instruments to the lu^w site, advantage beinit;- taken of the iuter-

Vale. — Dr. Elkin's lielionu'tcr work constitutes the chief astro- 
nomical activity. In 1891 the seri(;s of observations to deteinune the 
parallaxes of the first magnitude stars of the iu)rthei'n iienusi»here was 
comi)lete<l. Observations have also been made of comi>arison stars for 
Victoria, and the comi»utations on the Iris series in 1888 have been car- 
ried forward chietly by Miss Palmer. Observations of comets and 
asteroids were made by Mr. Chase with th(; S-inch Heed e(|uatorial. 

From 'Inly, 18!)1, to .Ianuar.\, 1892. the helionieter was devoted to a. 
series of measui-es on the satellit(?s of ,Iui)itei' for the determiTuition 
of their orliits, and the mass of tlie i)lanet. A tier the coini)letion of 
this work Dr. Chase comjdeted a triangulation of the principal stars 
in Coma Berenices. A series of measnres of Algol has been made to test

the tlieory of a sensible orbital motion of the bii!>;lit component, and 
the theoretical parallax, suggested by Mr. Chandler. 

Yerkes (University of Chicago): Hale. — Through the munificence 
of Mr. Charles J. Yerkes, of Chicago, tlie University of Chicago is to 
have an astronomicar observatory of the first class. No definite limit 
has been assigned to the expenditure contemplated, but it is intimated 
that the eiiuipment shall be equal to any in existence. The principal 
instrument will be a 40-inch refractor, the disks for which were made 
some years since for the University of Southern California. 

The remainder of the equipment is still undetermined, but it will 
probably include a IC-inch lefractor, 12-iuch "'twin " equatorial with 
visual and photographic objectives, 6-inch meridian circle, and 20-inch 
siderostat. 

Zurich: B. Wolf. — Sun-spot observations; observations for deter- 
mining the variation of latitude; time service. 

ASTR( )NOMIC AL INSTRUMENTS. 

Brash('ar-}{asii)i(/.s objectives. — Three large object glasses recently 
made by Brashear are of more than ordinary interest, as they have 
been ground by Prof. Hastings' formula. They are the 16-inch of the 
Goodsell Observatory, the 12.2 of the Ladd Observatory, and the 12-inch 
of the Kenwood Physical Observatory. The crown glass was obtained 
from Mantois, of Paris, and the fiint from tipt' o])tical works at Jena, 
Germany. 

A new instrument has been devised by A. Becik, called a '^ ISTadir- 
Instrument," for the determination of time and latitude by observation 
of the transits of stars over a circle whose pole is the zenith. The in- 
strument is adjusted for a circle of 60<^ zenith distance. 

To amateurs a series of articles on the ''Adjustment of a small Equa- 
torial," in the Journal of the British Astronomical Association (Feb- 
ruary, 1892), by Mr. Maunder, will undoubtedly prove of interest and 
value. 

MISCELLANEOUS. 

Prizes. — The Lalande prize of the Paris Academy for 1891 was 
awarded to M. C Bigourdan for the work he has undertaken and 
partly carried out, of micrometrically measuring all the known nebu- 
he, about six thousand in number, observable at Paris ; this will be a 
first step to obtaining some knowledge of their proper motions, and 
ultimately, perhaps, of their distances from the sun. No memoir was 
presented to the Academy on the special subject proposed for the 
Damoiseau prize, " To perfect the theory of the inequalitTies of long 
periods caused by the planets in the motion of the moon." It was, 
therefore, proposed again for 1892, and its value fixed at 1,000 francs. 
Prizes were, however, adjudged, for their ] Janetary and cometary inves.-

TJie Donohdc Comet Medals of the Astroioinieal Society of the Paeijic. — 
The followin<i- amended rules for tbe bestowal of the medal took 
effect on February I'd, l.s'.U. 

I. A medal of bronze is eslablislied as a ])er])etnal foundation to be 
given for the discovery of comets, as follows : 

The medal is to bear on the obverse side tlie elligy of a l)right comet 
among stars, with the legend "Asteonomical Society of the Pa- 
cific" around the border, and on the reverse the inscri])tion. "Tins 

medal, FOl'NDEI) IN 18(10 EY .loSEPH A. DONOHOE, IS PEESENTED 

TO (the name of the discoverer) to comMEMOKATE the DIS- 
CO veuy or A COMET ON (the date)." 

It is to be understood that this medal is intended solely as a recog 
nition of merit, and not as a reward. 

ir. The medal will be given to the actual discoverer of any unex- 
])ected comet. 

II r. The discoverer is to make his discovery known in tlie usual 
way, and, in order to simi)lify the work of the committee, wliicii, in 
certain cases may lie calhMl upon to consider the merits of sevcial inde- 
pendent discoveries of the same object, he should also address a letter 
to the Director of the Lick Observatory, which should state tlie exact 
time of the discoxciy, the ]»osition of the conu't, the direction of its 
motion (when this can 1 c deteiinined), and thejihysical apiu-arance of 
the object, 

Xo aintlication for the bestowal of the medal isre(|uired. The letters 
received from discoverers of comets will be ]»reserved in the records of 
the Lick Observatory, Cable telegiams to the Lick Obseivatoiy are to 
be addressed to ''"■ Astron()m<'r, San Francisco." 

I\', All comnuniications will be referred to a committee consist ing of 
the l)irectoi-of the Lick ()l>servatory, ^.r o^c/o. and of two other per 
sons, mendx'rs of the Astronomical Society of the Pacitic. who are to 
be annually api)ointed by the Board of Directors. The decisimis of this 
committee are to be final ui)on all ])i>ints relating to the award of the 
medal. The ccmimittee will i)rint an annual statement of its oju'rations 
in the i)ublications of the .societ} ,

Under ordinary circiiiustaiu'es the comet medal will be awarded witliiii 
two months after the date of the discovery. In cases of doubt a longer 
period may elapse. The medal will not be awarded (unless under the 
most exceptional circumstances) for the discovery of a comet until enough 
observations are secured (by the discoverer or by others) to permit the 
calculation and veriflcation of its orbit. 

V. This medal is to be a i)erpetual foundation from and after January 
1, 1S90. 

The fourth award of tlie Douohoe medal was made to Dr. E. Spitaler, 
assistant in the Imperial Observatory of Vienna, for his discovery of 
a comet "in the morning- hours" of November IG, 1890. This was the 
first comet discovered by Dr. Spitaler. 

The fifth award was made to Prof. T. Zona, adjunct astronomer in 
the Royal Observatory of Palermo, for his discovery of a comet at 
9^ 31'", Greenwich mean time, November 15, 1890. Also, his first dis- 
covery of a comet. 

The sixth award was made to Mr. E. E. Barnard, astronomer of the 
Lick Observatory, for his discovery of a comet at 10 hours, Greenwich 
mean time, on March 29, 1891. This was the fitteeuth comet discov- 
ered by Mr. Barnard. 

The seventh award was also made to Mr. Barnard for a comet dis- 
covered at 0'' 55'", Greenwich mean time, on October 3, 1891. 

The eigth award was made to Dr. Lewis Swift for his discovery of 
an unexi)ected comet on March G, 1892. 

The ninth award was made to Mr. W. F. Denning, of Bristol, Eng- 
land, for his comet of March LS, 1892. 

The tenth award to JNIr. W. II. Brooks, of the Smith Observatory, Ge- 
neva, New York, for a comet on August 28, 1892. 

The eleventh award was made to ]Mr. E. E. Barnard for his discov- 
eiy by photography of an unexpected comet on October 12, 1892, at 
Mount Hamilton. 

The twelfth award was made to Mr. Edwin Holmes, of London, 1^'ng- 
land, for his comet of November G, L892. 

The thirteenth award to Mr. W. R. Brooks for his comet on Novem- 
ber 19, 1892. 

The Acton prize. — Once in seven years the Acton prize of £100 is 
awarded to the person whose scientific writings have been most ser- 
viceable to the cause of natural religiou. The last prize was adjudged 
to Prof. G. Stokes, of Cambridge University. The recipient in 1892 
was Miss Agues Gierke, author of the "History of Astronomy in tlie 
Nineteenth Century;" of the "System of the Stars;" and of "Studies 
in Homer." 

The Bruce fund. — The fund of !f(),0i»(5 placed by Miss Bruce in I'rof. 
Pickering's hands to be used in aid of astronomical work, has been 
api>lied as follows: To Prof. Newcoiub, for a discussion of the contact 
observalious of Venus during the transits of 1871 and 1882; Dr. I'lass-

national (leodetic Commission, dispatch of a party to the Sandwich 
Islands for a study of the variations of latitude; ]Mr. II. H. Turner, 
computation of tables for reductions of star places; Prof. K. S. Ilolden,

land, identification of metals in the solar spectrum; Dr. L. StruAe, 
reduction of the occultations observed during the eclipse «»f January 
28, 1888. 

It may not be out of i)lace here to note that a Ici^acy of 1()<>,000 
francs ($20,000) has been left by an old lady of Pan to the Institute of 
France, as a reward for the i)erson of any nationality who shall, within 
the next ten years, succeed in communicatin<;' with the inh.altitants of 
some other celestial body. Apropos of this le<>a(;y, Flamniarion has 
written an interesting artich^ in L'x^stronomie as to the jtossibility of 
onr ever being able to a(;complish communication m ith our neighbors. 

The Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters has awarded a gohl 
medal to Baron E. von liaerdtl, of Innspruck, for his memoir on a 
case of the problem of three l^odies proposed by the Acadamy in lS8i>. 

Aslronoiinj and aslra-pln/.sic.s. — With its one hiindi'ed ;ind lirst num- 
ber, the Sidereal Mcssciujcr, which has been edited by Prof. \V. ^V. 
Payne, at Xorthfield, Minn., since 18S2, takes a new name, and is 
enlarged, so that a considerable portion of each numlx-r is de\ oled, 
under the able editorship of Prof. 0. E. Hale, of Cliicago University, 
to what is now known as astro-iihysics. Prof. Payne continues as 
i-enior editor in "(leneral Astronomy," assisted by l*rof. IF. C. AVilson. 
Tlie bibliograjdicr will note that, though the journal has a new name, 
the volume and current number are continued from tlie Sidereal Mes- 
senfjer ; thus the initial numbei- of Astronomy and Astro-physics is 
"Number 101," forming part of ''A'olume xi." 

It is stated that there are to be erected in Berlin three huiulred 
"Urania i)ilhirs.'' These pillars will be nbout 18 feet higli, made of 
cast iron, and will each contain a clock, meteorological instruments, 
weather charts, astronomi<-al and geograi)hical annouucenu'nts, and 
also, as in the streets of Paris, a plan of the neighboring streets in en- 
larged Ibrm to enable strangers to iind their way. The instruments 
are to be regulated from the observatory. 

A stai- atlas by llerr Jacob Messer, of St, Petersburg, the page being 
about 4i inches by 8-i inches, will be found extremely convenient for 
amateur observers wliodo not care to burden themselves with tiie larger 
works. It contains all the stars visible to the naked eye (lirst to sixth 
magnitudes, inclusive), from the north iM)le down to 35'^ south declina- 
tion, together with a selection of the most interesting double stars, 
variables^ nebuhe, clusters, etc. 



740 PROGRESS OF ASTRONOMY FOR 1891 AND 1892. 

Much interesting light has been thrown of late on Babylonian as- 
tronomy by Fathers Epping and vStrassmaier. A series of" Inuar and 
planetary observations has recently been fonnd in the cuneiform tablets 
of the British Museum, and among others an observation of a lunar 
eclii^se, one of the nine used by Ptolemy in his Almagest. Another 
work of the same authors shows that the Babylonians were able to 
predict the rising and setting of the moon, and the hour and magni- 
tude of an eclipse. 

Mr. A. M. W. Downing, superintendent of the computations at the 
Royal Observatory, Greenwich, was appointed to succeed Dr. Hind, 
who retired from the position of snperintendent of the British Nautical 
Almanac office on January 1, 1892. 

The Astronomische Cxesellschaft held its fourteenth biennial meeting 
at Munich Augnst 5-7, under the presidency of M. Gylden. The society 
numbers 318 members. 

A neic astronomical society. — An association was formed in Berlin, 
in 1891, called the "Union of Friends of Astronomy and Cosmical 
Physics,'"' for the ])uri)Ose of securing co-oi)eration in the study of these 
sciences in the countries of central Europe. The strength of the new 
society is perhaps best indicated by the names of its officers, Prof. 
Lehmann-Filhes being president, and Ilerrn Forster, M. W. Meyer, 
Plassmann, Jesse, Welnstein, and Eeimann the presidents of its six 
sections. 

The question of the ownership of an aerolite has been referred for 
settlement to the courts, and the decision reached is of some interest. 
On May 2, 1890, an aerolite weighing 66 pounds fell on the land of 
John Goddard, in Winnebago County, Iowa. It was dug up by Peter 
Hoaglaud, carried to his house, and sold for 1105. Goddard claimed 
it as it had fallen on his land, while Hoagland claimed it as he dis- 
covered it and as it fell from heaven. In the suit that resulted the 
court held that the stone became part of the soil on which it fell, and 
that Hoagland had no right to remove it. The defense claimed that 
whatever was movable and found on the surface of the earth unclaimed 
by any owner was suj)j)osed to be abandoned by the proprietor.

ASTRONOMICAL BIBLIOGRAniY FOR 1891 AND 1892. 

The following bibliography or index catalogue is arranged upon the 
l^lan adopted in the review of astronomy for 188G, thus making this 
series of indexes complete from that year to 1892, except for the year 
1890, an index for which Was published in the Sidereal MesHenger for 
1891 (vol. 10, pp. 84, 350). 

The principal books, memoirs, and journal articles published in 1891 
and 1892 that have come Tinder the compiler's notice are here included, 
and there are also a few titles that belong to earlier years but were 
not found in time to insert in previous lists. References to series of 
observations, preliminary orbits of comets and asteroids, reviews, etc., 
are omitted, and to condense it into reasonable limits tlie bibliogiaphy 
has not been made exhaustive even to the extent of printing all titles 
that were originally collected. 

The subject headings are in alphabetical order, with a subarrange- 
ment by authors. The references to periodicals are by volume and ])age 
separated by a colon; thus: Obsry. 15:173-89 indicates volume 15, 
pages 173 to 189, of The Observatory.
